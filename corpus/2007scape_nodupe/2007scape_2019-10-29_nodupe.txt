This is fucking sick mate great work

Thanks for the advice friend, will definitely be thinking thrice.

Ahh, never forget the "Join party in daemonheim, cast tele to daemonheim which stalls your game, then your teammate enters into daemonheim and kicks you from party, forcing you to join a random instance on the world once your long ass teleport animation finishes" ol' paftaroo.
---

---
I did this a lot and the best ones were walking on the sea or joining other peoples dungeons and harrassing them. There is currently a mostly unknown smuggle you can still do in OSRS regarding a certain minigame and quest, but they made them a lot more difficult to smuggle as you can't teleport or walk without releasing the House Options menu. You can smuggle a few animations out of the same minigame by doing this as well (teleport out of minigame, press house options when the teleport animation ends).

Thank you that calculator helped a lot!

It’s a bar down the street from your place bro, look it up :) we could meet somewhere else though too, I have a friend from my clan in Burbank as well I bet he would be down to come, we both are lvl 120+
---
I’m with you on that one man. Spent the past week grinding it nonstop. I got to level 60, moved to Werewolf training in Caniff and fell a few times taking damage, no biggie I still have 30hp. Fall again for 30 damage. I sat there and stared at my screen for a good minute. Crazy stuff.

What if I told you pmods are actually just regular players
---
You're not funny
---
Just if u grind it make sure to have fremmy elite diary u will be guaranteed decent gp that way.
---
Ring of Odds: consumables have a 50/50 chance of having either a double effect or no effect (example: eating a shark will either heal 40 hitpoints or 0).
---
no lie its actually quite helpful, atleast at ZMI since the altar clickbox is so small, and is located right next to the clickbox of a tunnel that you could missclick on.
---
People over estimating how much we have to do. Then also tryna lecture me on what to do with my time. Fucking jokes man haha.

I saw a dude standing outside inferno other day on 169KC complaining about pet. Is that you?

What if I’m mobile only?

Never got anything off hards, but I got cape of skulls off an ez clue which is 21m. It's something.
---
if I ever get to a point where I need a plugin to help with an altar that takes up literally 15% of the standard clients window I'm just hang up my clicking finger bud.
---
We got the best OC in the land boys.
---
That's not nearly as bad as it seems, because the only advantage you get is 1 extra attack with 0 stats, compared to actual pid manipulation (that I think is most likely superstition, honestly) which is an extra attack with an 82/82 stat weapon.
---
Fire cape before dragon defender? Huh, I did it backwards. Gz either way!
---
Ya. 1 def pure of some sort
---
woosh
---
So so good
---
Someone should tell him uims can note pots now at decanting npcs
---
He also didn't have a ring of life. It won't save you all the time, but even if bosses average 30s on you (they don't), it saves you 1/3 of the time.
---
Honestly, Staking as a whole should be removed.
---
Dagger?
---
B0aty quit YT and RS back in the days to go back to school, but his friends and family convinced him it was stupid to give up that cash cow. Idk if he got back into it afterwards, probably did since he started doing more than just pking.
---
He attacks every 5 ticks, whip attacks every 4. 
---
Tick 1 you hit him, he hits you back. 
---
Ticks 2 and 3 you're both on cooldown. 
---
Tick 4 you hit him, he's still on cooldown. 
---
Ticks 5-7 you run under him so he can't hit you. You're still on cooldown. 
---
Repeat.
---
This way you trade hits 2:1 instead of 5:4.
---
Good God you are a champion
---
I killed 200 earlier and got zilch. I'm jelly.
---
Gratz! Did you get pet?
---
Source? This would be immensely helpful &amp; I haven’t seen mention of them anywhere
---
Hahaha no clue! Just felt like it
---
Thanks i appreciate that!
---
Thanks so muchh
---
personally I'd try to find friends to make a group iron with since it is a 'big commitment'. I wont trust strangers to not quit when we are already deep in.
---
Bots that auto accept whip stakes if its in their favor.
---
probably rendi lol
---
You look like the Ice King
---
you need a redirected tab, made using the redirection scroll from nmz
---
noosi
---
[deleted]
---
lol you don't have to be a good dude, this is the normal and expected behavior of an adult. this sub is too much.
---
At least he didn't remind you about Hughes.
---
Regular house tab doesn’t work. Has to be a redirected house tab. Use one of the scrolls from NMZ on a tab to create one with a “P” on it
---
There's probably loads of streamers who don't enjoy the game they're playing but do it anyway because its the game they're known for.  If they don't stream it they take a big loss to viewership and therefor money.
---
Are you using a redirected house tab. Because a normal house tab wont work. You need to use a scroll of redirection from nmz and use it on a house tab. That makes a redirected house tab.
---
Ranger boots
---
90
---
Edit Sorry that’s for fossil island
---
I’m not 100% certain, but I thought you have to use a scroll of redirect on a house tab for it to count.
---
A ring that gives 1 additional xp when burying normal bones.
---
Good stuff! I too enjoy the guardians. Although can only do a few kills every so often.
---
Not you though kiddo
---
They may be 10x more expensive but the thing is you get 80% of them back. So they may cost 1.2k to buy but in reality they cost 20% each time you attack.
---
Generally it normally always works out to be more profit to use bis when bossing as you make much more gold over time as you get faster kills
---
but even entering your house from polnivneach (ironman way) doesnt work either... so i need to do NMZ for a medium diary? thats a quite something
---
I’m not one for beating women 
---
But
---
When's the bounty hunter beta end so we can get back to regular bounty worlds?
---
It's actually only 5m
---
Are you a btw if not then you do nmz its less than 1k points. Really simple
---
Make bank tabs on runelite for wilderness clues. Makes gearing up take seconds.
---
I am assuming the checkered ground is from Falador party room?
---
Yep that's definitely the solution to this
---
Sounds like exactly what I’m looking for! I’ll definitelu stop by there
---
I restart once in a blue moon, i get to endgame, get bored, take a long break then restart...that way its fun to go through the game again. idk how some of these people restart every fkn month.
---
Possibly. [He left a month ago](https://twitter.com/Jay_Wilton/status/1178610468749037568)

hey man don't worry you'll get them one day! just make sure:
---
* you have exactly at least 97% reward potential
---
* kill all 6 brothers in either this order: k, a, d, g, v, t; OR a, g, v, t, a, d (any other order won't work)
---
* your first kill must not be with prayer
---
* you talk to oziach before your trip
---
* must be holding a full barrows set in your invent (you can wield it if you want)

drop rate is dependent on PID and position on the mayan calendar. you got this, bro!

You did the fight caves like the devs imagined it!
---
I need this...

I would find my friend and WC with him all the time. Tell him how good a friend he was even though he can’t respond.
---
I unlocked and extended basilisk for boss just to realize I have to quest for them lol

(Not quest for the task)
---
Imagine being a dem in current year
---
He was my best friend. He knew my password and stuff. To be fair his family took me to Disney and out to eat all the time so worth wise probably even lol. He wasnt like a bad person he just was legitimately addicted to staking lol.

[Sorry bro](https://i.redd.it/2v4y45c8l0m31.png)

no one wants to be turned against Verf like that tho

i had it custom made

Are you ok?

I got my first Zenyte at 1361. What motivated me to keep going was my friends setting goals for me to reach. I still got depressed at times but you'll get it eventually!

I had my first unsired at 360kc...

Whaaaat??

Noooooo...

Can anyone confirm what color the middle bar on his stats tab is?  This is key to getting the bank pin

How afk is the walk to the soul alter as opposed the the blood alter? Night swap to souls at 90!
---
Yeah but a bil tho
---
just remember

houses don't give firemaking xp

No skill comes anywhere near the GP rates of PVM, if you skill for money you're doing something wrong.
---
Bro you're arguing semantics.
---
Youre arguing for the sake of arguing
---
Nope
---
It took me 15K goblins to get a Champ Scroll, more details: 35K cannonballs and a whole weekend of crying.
---
15 and 30 for me
---
Tough luck with the claws. Still, very nice. Bank was definitely made 👌
---
Also had to do 67-70 Construction + Herblore and lost like 5M with it, I hate losing money like that; most hated skills :(
---
I'm arguing because some guy that worded it in a way that made it clearer than the other guy was getting low key shat on for doing so. It means the same but it is different information. It's literally not literally the same. Words matter, language matters.

This just reminds me of how dead rs3 is

Fyi you can turn the button on and off in the bank settings
---
The guys just saying that wildy clues wre really easy, but the regearing makes them such an annoyance.
---
melee can make or find weapons as a drop, you can even get a free bronze scimitar in rimmington
---
Why clue box?
---
The whole point of bringing 3 items is thay you don't need to spend money on a clue box/give the pker money(the clue box drops gp)
---
If you're bringing a clue box you might aswell bring dhide and food and try to anti-pk or get away.
---
The set up is to bring a spade, clue, wep, tele(seed pod)
---
Drop the spade if you get attacked
---
Flexing your abs when you’re skinny isn’t a flex
---
Can I just like grab one or is there a technique? Asking for a friend
---
We pay; we gay.
---
At least you can kill hundreds of goblins an hour lol
---
It’s accurate. The math was done by Oblivion. Assuming max gear using melee claws marginally beat BGS.
---
when you post your kc when you did it all before collection log for karma
---
I really really Like this
---
I feel like a recent update was shitting out elites. Gauntlet I think it is.
---
Yeah same, asking for a friend.
---
I had something similar when I was on the main raiding. It had something to do with the client i was using. My laptop at the time was not as good as it should have been (single core processing power). You may need to use a different client or turn off some of the plugins. This also may have nothing to do with your problem. Mine was only during Olm.
---
Easiest 99 is mining. You don't even have to move from 20-99 if you don't want to.

First, I was not defending it's position. Also, Honestly pretty much everything you've said could be applied to any niche community.
---
My main point in this entire conversation is that opinions aside, objectively speaking, the duel arena is and has been a pretty big part of the game for pretty much it's entire history. Again, I'm not making any pro/con, good/bad statement. Just simply saying it's a noteworthy part of the game.
---
My personal opinion on it: I think it's fucking cancer. I really do. But that doesn't change the fact that literally thousands of players spend time there in some capacity. You can't deny it's a pretty strong presence in the community.
---
Now, I'll actually argue ONE point that I think stands strong about it: the duel arena is by far THE largest gold sink in the entire game. It probably outweighs the next two or three combined by a long shot. Now does this make gambling okay? No. But hey... Your point that removing the duel arena would
---
&gt;Hardly have any impact outside that community
---
Is false.
---
Also, I made no commentary about jagex saying gambling is part of the game so IDK why you even included that.
---
50%/2 = 25%

No. We have seen this dance done by animators who post here on Reddit though. They used some generic looking version of the default character.

I would say this post isnt relevant to this sub at all though. So downvote from me.
---
You can only use this once, right? I sent in an appeal with the "I think you made a mistake" option. Logged into the account page a few days later and saw the macro ban was after like 10 website advertising mutes. Now I feel like after I quit someone hijacked the account and that seems the better option to select.
---
How much do you get paid?
---
Group ironman rumored dates?
---
I’d buy bis gear (not including bow or scythe - but instead lance, Dhcb, sang staff, ancestral, boots, zenytes, bandos, armadyl etc.)
---
This will give you about 300-400m leftover (assuming you sold for 1.2 and change; also depending if you get extras like arcane, rapier, kodai) to train construction + prayer + other skills with plenty of gp for supplies. 
---
You’ll have everything you need for efficient pvm content (obviously not MAX efficient) including raids/tob (whip tob is kind of gross but you’re pretty far from that content anyhow and will likely make enough to get a scythe additionally by then), slayer, General bossing etc. 
---
Congrats on the rng!
---
Construction is much more worth it than herb. The money you'll make grinding to 83 and buying all the upgrades more than  pays for itself in the long run
---
The only people reliably making money off the duel arena are scammers and cheaters.
---
Ok, thx for the advice :D

The reason I’m Republican is because I went to see John Wick 3 and I was snuck three cans of baked beans in for a snack and I start eating them and a black kids like “yo look this dude eatin baked beans”. Then everyone pointed and laughed at me.

hey at least he requires more evidence than jagex's banhammer
---
This has been going on for years. Twitch are powerless and don't give a fuck. Jagex claimed they were talking to Twitch about the problem, but naturally, nothing came of that.

Except jagex

Probably not for around a year

It was hamatchi that they thought was a virus when I tried to play private servers back in the day.

What about runecrafting, everyone’s favorite skill?
---
I'd count that as Skilling. You're training. Your combat stats which means you are allowed to kill bigger game for higher profits.
---
only 112 kills to go until you get the tattered head! Keep at it man!

Where is this solider?
---
Not even close.

Ring of reference: keeps your camera locked when teleporting. Efficient banking at castle wars

Haha that funny, my wife HATES osrs
---
There really is a curve with jad. The more you fight him the easier it gets and less nerve racking it is. Yes the nerves are worse because you spend an hour getting to him. I was only just able to get the cape today with 70 def, 82 range, and 70 prayer. I think biggest thing was def with Guthan a switch for sustainability. By jad I wasn’t worried about suppliers  and could focus on the fight and keeping my prayer near full the whole time. I could never have done this when I had 45 def, and I can’t imagine how low prayer pures do it. Shits hard but nerves calm a bit after awhile. 
---
Note: I have 2 kc on jad, first kill I didn’t get the cape because I messed up a switch and died with jad lol
---
I think you unlock double fires before getting nature RC unlocked but I gotcha meaning chief

I learned the hard way that if you’re not second reborn yet and you don’t play for 3 months your character gets deleted. 
---
Also fuck the lucky7 economy.
---
You're obviously doing it wrong then. This is especially true at lower levels when you're too weak to fight higher level monsters which drop more expensive items. Most skills get you profit in game unless you power level to max cape and join virgin town. 
---
Plus, people who tell you to boss or do slayer are doing bosses early when they're first released and thus make more profit from drops. Later on, you're gonna be going broke just from spending money on gear and potions and food to fight bosses. The. Rng factor is not a a solid bet that you'd get a good drop. Slayer doesn't net you good income untill 65+ as most would tell you. Others Would tell you it's not profitable at all.
---
This is huge. Taking your time tagging off healers was I think the main reason Jad got easier and bearable for me. When he repeated an attack I already had prayer on for, I moved and tagged while keeping an eye on him
---
I wouldn't call it abuse to be mad over it. It takes more than just that for abuse.
---
ahh not quite, im guessing you've heard me talk to pugger, im no stranger, especially when i made a scene at RF when i found out who weath was.

I use it when it uses a ranged attack. Or when you know a solo tanz phase is coming eith no snakeling spawns. I see a lot of people use it before going in but im confident in saying itll probably be used by a snakeling before a ranged attack hits
---
One of the many great easter eggs in the game

Im so hungry rn

Probably around just over an hour if you've done it before, 2/3 hours if you haven't

collect daily sand from bert

I was in the same boat. I bought eclectic implings and did medium clues for the 1/30 for a master. Wayyyy easier to farm than elites and managed to get a couple rangers along the way to help make it worth it.
---
I'm at 62 masters and 137 elites.... still no music cape...

So I can buy ancestral bottoms and not be a pleb at Cox anymore

Do trawler until you get a piece then do aerial  and see how slow the pearls come in. Make a decision from that. I recommend trawler

Aw man maybe I could change your mind haha

DWH has basically the same attack bonuses as a rapier/blade of saeldor.

As a proud owner of several spades, I respectfully disagree and approve of the amount of worlds, and think we should add more
---
That's a good way to think of it man
---
Gonne put this as an event in my clan discord. 
---
My clan has over 300 active discord and rs members. Think we will show up with a decent amount!
---
Just make adamantite chestplates.
---
Either that or blast furnace.
---
I will bite
---
Idk man its a phone
---
I guess it is what you make it. I usually spent my time in the game playing with friends and meeting people so I actually see it as quite positive in my life. Sure I spent a lot of time playing but I don’t regret any of it.
---
I would appreciate it since i got hacked a week ago for the second time #FML
---
Muh sexism
---
Sorry to hear that
---
These are the types of questions that get you *accidently banned*
---
Doesn’t surprise me tbh - what with the whole Ku Klux Klan themed Halloween event this year.
---
Can get sand while doing farm run
---
What if we remove all player killing from all worlds but 3? Boom problem solved.
---
well actually ultimates suicide hespori now since u can pick and choose which items to take out for only 25k
---
I dont think removing pvp worlds is the way to go since it has its charms and can be fun, but ik up for Just adding the crater as a "minigame". Make a world or 2 for of to have fun in there
---
100% degree dependent
---
I have a question about a type of lure, I haven't figured out what the point of the lure was yet. 
---
So, a guy meets me at GE, is being friendly but not asking of anything. He's got a Zik pet and full raids 2 gear on, so it's no burner account. He invites to teach me raids 2 while me and a friend leave for a Sara run.
---
He messages me, says add me on discord so we can learn the raid over discord call etc. etc. I was on mobile, so I told him in a bit. He then mentions he's super hyped because, wow, he just got a 3a bow! Some pkers were trying to lure him out of a safespot with it and get him for his raids setup. So what does he do? He gets a friend to that exact spot and the friend logs into the pvp world, without anything on, and grabs the bow. They split the bow. 
---
The obvious of why this is a lie: dropped items don't appear for accounts that weren't logged in when they were dropped, and why tf would you have your raids gear on in a pvp world? doesn't line up. He also messaged me saying "do you have discord? I can send you a screenshot of it" accidentally, sent to the wrong person, before ever having offered for ME to come help him out. 
---
Because now, he's being taunted by the same pkers that he took for a 3a bow? Makes sense. And it's in the same spot? So will I just go outside catherby bank and grab it? I don't need any gear after all, so what's the risk. When I tossed him onto my ignore list he pretty much immediately hopped onto another alt and got offended and did the classic scammer "why would you do me like the bro" barrage. 
---
So, it's clearly a lure, but... why? What does anybody have to gain by pking a bunch of nakeds outside a bank? Or is this some weird way to try and get a discord out of me, but then again, what's to gain there?
---
Lol okay
---
Dam bro let’s link up an do zammy. I got rng that will rub off on you! Thanks for sharing this post! I literally love log collection post
---
Not true.
---
Lmao
---
You should start commissioning work and framing etc
---
How do you know how many?
---
New crystal equipment is like 900k
---
True but that money can get you soooo much stuff if you alched all of the rune.

i mean, dems still kinda suck, but republicans suck more, also, who the fuck cares, this is a runescape sub
---
If you're using that little amount of cannonballs then you're doing something wrong mate.
---
it might fix it for some, but mines stuck in .....weird looking letters too, and i cleaned up, nvr use vpn. i am also talking about rs3website.
---
hopefully op can get it fixed
---
Problem is that uim want to die? It’s part of their banking solutions.
---
Uh yeah dc can be server side lmao...
---
Don't worry it's probably banned by now anyways.
---
Rice
---
What about npc indicator, with respawn time?
---
You could make it pregnant. Nah jk but set goals for yourself thats how i do it, or just take it easy and play other games whilst u afk skill, if u play it too much it gets boring but thats with everything
---
Yeah and sometimes you won't sell it for 2 months and you start to wonder if it was worth it tieing up all that money for so long to earn 2m.
---
Medium boat plebs!
---
This guys a phony
---
Haha i was more making fun about how posts like this create more people doing that same thing, that the post originally tried to stop. 
---
When i actually want to russtle some jimmies, ill head down to the yannile sand pit on a pvp world. Ill camp there waiting for helmies. The salt from all the ironmen i kill is soooo fucking good :')
---
YASSSS KWEEN SLAAAAYer tasks would be much more fun
---
In the time spent complaining you could have just learned  a new language. Your generation doesn't want to work for anything they want it given to them.
---
Apparently, people are being banned for not doing anything (except for the legitimate ones).
---
Their detection software has false-positives that they know about.. and it happened on stream.
---
Sorry man, I don’t really like Ironman mode.
---
What would you say is a resonable goal right now. Im thinking MM2 as i've done all the other big quests this is the only one i've not attempted.

Why I oughta
---
just because you have to share a spot for a slayer task doesnt make the game literally unplayable
---
Bro how can a person be this deluded?
---
Oh so it's even lower then, could very Well be. I just know it isn't 1/100 :)
---
For training purposes obby.
---
what for bossing?
---
It’s useful at sire and hydra
---
You could log in - with hopes to get banned... surely that will ignite the flame for you to keep playing.

I love the pet panel

I would use the we do raids discord, and would just team up with people in the same situation as you guys, you don't really need mentors, you just need people to stick with you guys... That's what I did for cox, I waited a few hours for a mentor, there were another 30 people in there doing the same, so I just asked if someone wanted to team up and learn without a mentor and we did it... I suggest you try to do the same

Thenks for educeting us on Proper Grammer.
---
/u/chewierulz Just saying that this is likely the best advice in this entire thread, please for the love of god follow through with meesrs' comment. It will absolutely set your account up perfectly. Just be sure to go hard in the questing too to get Barrows gloves and Ava's assembler from vorkath.
---
The only reason runescape became popular so quickly was because every kid were playing browser games around that time
---
Do you have the time to play? I know for me I usually get discouraged because I know I might only have an hour or so to log on and I won’t really be able to accomplish anything satisfying in that time frame. So I usually end up being really de motivated and I put it down til I can give it some decent hours.
---
Totally off topic but how did you find studying Physics? i'm thinking myself of going back to University to study Astrophysics.
---
Theres a name I haven't heard in 6 years.
---
I have a big office chair, haven’t found a gaming chair I like for a decent price.
---
fuck man lets just build a bank in our house too while we are at it
---
I really want 83 con. And better gear than barrows and a whip. :p
---
Tbow 77 prayer rigour and 83-86 construction for a maxed house. You should have enough for an anguish &amp; pegasian boots left over. Then get basics back like your whip/fury blowpipe trident ect.
---
Hey man i wanna tell you why i deserve the 45m ; i currently have a fulltime job and 2 kids i dont have much time to play... Tho i really like pking but getting my range lvls without having money takes ages... Would u be so kind?
---
Only works if you're making stackable like darts, plus you lose an inventory spot to the notes
---
Moving a character's field of vision around is not the same as clicking at various points on the screen.
---
Source: DMG in CSGO (when I last played), so at least average.
---
Great idea!
---
Learning to do the cave before jad effortlessly helps a LOT with the progress so you don't waste more time having to reset because you died during pre-jad waves or wasted too many supplies
---
Get a task and use dark bow spec.
---
First thought was of my infant son lul
---
Make sure to give her the whole loaf
---
I got the pet on 388 kc never went back, they aren't bad money to be fair the the dust is a big help when adding it to cannonballs.
---
Bis slayer melee weapon is rapier, its really worth the investment
---
Fucking nerds
---
? unagi is bbq eel unless thats what they also call a salmon skin roll, would be confusing in a restaurant to have both of them named the same lol
---
D
---
The armour is BiS at hydra
---
with ok levels, gear and skill u can brute force ur way through for 1 kill with 0 points
---
Oh. Yes. I retract my statement as it does not fit context.
---
I went 2k kc dry, and just got my first whip last night... then another 20 kills later. Keep it up!
---
We even have the shield for it
---
l^(0)l
---
Feels bad i got the head before the whip lol
---
Didn't know dwarves can read :o
---
If it's a brand new card, sometimes it needs to be "activated" before use. Checking your balance at a cash point (or making a purchase using your PIN) can do this.
---
I think the spot loss is worth the 10 darts as banking is I think 1 tick at that point. Idk. But its definitely less clicking.
---
Your nearly half way there!
---
Very true, it's not mentally healthy to get attached to a status which is so easily lost and  sometimes not even depandant on the player (dc)
---
Having hc is cool, but don't make it the only reason to have that account
---
Can the key to unlock the bosses even drop from gargoyles in the basement? I've killed over 450 there (obviously on task) without a key drop. I'm assuming I'm just unlucky.
---
arent you losing 2, one for the noted bars, one for the already made darts?
---
I'm a new player who's getting ready to do barrows runs and questing. I've been playing consistently and 45 million would really help me get on my feet to get ready for harder content with higher requirements.
---
Why are you using firegiants for Rune Scim, it's easier to kill Zamorak Warriors since it's only a 1/50 there
---
Would you say 500 total would be a good place for it to be mems
---
Appeal it
---
We apply lots of these each day
---
is there a name for that fallacy where someone claims fletching is good money if you chop the logs yourself? or cooking is double the profit if you fish the items yourself. or cannon is free to use if you smith your own cannonballs.
---
in relation to this, i've heard people saying they only plant seeds they get from slayer, as opposed to the logical way of just selling those seeds and buying and planting efficient ones.   
---
this does not apply to ironmen
---
Can skills crafts nature runes just wondering lol
---
He
---
Job Snow and Myth on the right looking fuckin yoked
---
Mobile isn't the best for this as it logs if screen locks.
---
If you can, nmz on your home pc and use the teamviewer app to dial in and click every 20 mins.
---
Easiest would be use guthans on controlled and super att/str pots.
---
Every 20 mins just repot and click once. Most afk way there is for sure and what I did. Set a phone timer for 19 mins.. if you go a little over it won't logout and can tank for awhile.
---
Easy rumble with kendal, count, me, roald, snake. Can also use tree spirit
---
You can 20 min afk dharok nmz and range but requires more clicks to reset hp/absorbs and won't let you get the full 6 hours on an inventory
---
Splashing is the same, click once every 20 mins
---
never would've thought jmods browse /new here...

god cant change their chromosomes

No chance lmfao I botted 99 rc, wc and mining
---
With bow??
---
Appeals are appeals. Depends how long it has been since you were banned no matter what you botted to receive the ban.
---
EvScape’s Group Ironman series with the boys is a decent entertaining series to get in to, gives you an idea of a layout to use
---
You can still get the mimic without talking to the chest. Just can’t open it.
---
J-Mods can edit their stats. I saw one go down to level 1 in RS2
---
Set written short and long term goals. Tick them off as you go. Mix it up between fun and less boring grinds, same for afk vs sweaty tasks. Or just become a full time pker in a clan. Having a comunity that you talk in voice to daily will help you through the burnout periods. 
---
I have the same burnout thing as you but i playbfor longer and burn out for longer. Also same available scape time.
---
Didn’t hide screenshot date. Good luck account
---
Yes but I’ll advised
---
I would’ve assumed so too, but so far 25 virgins have downvoted you
---
I mean they get paid either way
---
Nice vid, I too am in the process of finishing my 60 attack zerker. How often do you solo pk in the revs caves and is it viable with all those pure clans roaming around.
---
Feels bad man
---
There is only one trading server for all normal worlds.
---
If you sell something on any world it can be bought on any world.
---
The problem is that one would have to buy every pot and bowl that is cheaper than your offer. (Since it always buys the cheapest and not the closest to your offer)
---
Buy limits on those items are probably too low for one person to clear out the market. So nobody can do that, no matter how much gp they have.
---
Anavar give up
---
Baby nh pure hands down takes the cake. I think purpps guide from a couple years ago is still quite relevant. 
---
Personally though, i like making level 30 to 40cb accs with like 60 range and mage. Ive killed looters at 44 single fights, big clan wars and rev caves. Ive pked many people at chaos alter that had mils worth of bones on a level 5 or 8 acc lol. Kill those dang scout bots in the rev caves for braclets. Its takes less than a day to quest and level an acc like this and if you do it with someone or a group you can do some funny stuff.
---
Lol there is RuneScape addiction and them the next level of am addiction to a person who streams runescape
---
I rermember training and dying, rushing back to grab whatever was left of my shit and when you get there the other guy you were training with trades you and gives you back all your shit. You felt so damned thankful.
---
That and having to actually *rush* back because there wasn't a tele to every inch of the map.
---
Pass me the garlic dipping sauce, king
---
Second this.
---
Nice.
---
Step into it, grab your genitals and see if it sends you home.

So good.

Is it advisable to bring an msb (i) for the early levels and then a rcb for the later ones? Just to clear out the weak rounds quickly and conserve prayer

yep. my Halloween costume

Solid comment

Adam Weebs. He is a amazing streamer at twitch television. If you ever feel down and sad then i recommend you to tune into his stream! And when he isn’t online watch his past broadcast. This guy is funny, humble and awesome

Lol yeah I feel you. It’s a major bait

"They dissed us for playing RS in High School..."
---
The person you gave your solid advice to botted recently. This wasn't some childhood mistake - they knew it was wrong and they expected to get banned. You don't know if they learned a lesson or that they wouldn't make the same mistake, the first thought that came to your mind was to try to get a cheater off the hook.
---
Why are you getting downvoted you're right lmfao
---
Ok so my first short term goal could be to complete MM2, while a longer term goal could be 99 str and 4 zen shards. i also still want to get my hands on a D pic. Also pking kinda off the table im a BTW lol.
---
&gt; shitty stuff
---
That's not very descriptive...
---
&gt; full of chemicals
---
**Everything** is a chemical. Water is a chemical.
---
&gt; the calories are the last of the problems
---
When it comes to gaining or losing weight, calories are the only thing that matters.
---
&gt; i talk as a nutrition university student and fitness lover
---
Appeal to authority doesn't make an argument more convincing, especially with how readily accessible medical studies are on pubmed
---
Pizza, absolutely pizza
---
This is a pretty cool idea, i think there are quite a few i can do already that i havent done do i may do this. see whats is easily do-able then just work on doing that then pushing my skills a few levels if needed.
---
Start working up to getting all of the hard diaries. While maintaining the rest of your skills. That's what I'm doing.
---
Go for hard diaries, 77 rc and all skilling outfits.
---
Who is the guy on the front right he is hot.
---
They think it’s just an rs3 hate circle jerk.
---
This is why a, an RS3 Player, use Retro Legacy Skins...  
---
I mean shit, the newer style armors are REALLY bothersome when playing a female character as they do a wonderful god of masculinizing you as much as possible, causing other players to mistake me for a dude.  
---
It's especially worrisome when tiers above Dragon DO NOT have Plate Skirts
---
I know there are plenty of guides out there and I've read/seen several, but still wanted to ask for my specific situation.
---
What armour setup should I use at fight caves? 
---
I've done it before on my main (20 def, 75 ranged at the time) but it's quite some time ago and now with other stats. I am 61 ranged and 60 defence, I want to do it with rune cbow. Money is not much of an object (e.g. I could buy ranger boots if necessary) and I will not have proselyte, nor do I have access to ava's due to 'account restrictions'. 
---
Helm: archers?
---
cape: vestment cloak?
---
necklace: fury?
---
ammo: adamant bolts and diamond (e) for jad?
---
weapon: rune cbow
---
body: red d'hide body
---
shield: odium ward
---
legs: ranger tights/dlegs/red d'hide chaps?
---
gloves: ranger gloves/red d'hide chaps/regen?
---
boots: ranger boots/holy sandals?
---
ring: archer's ring?
---
:\^)
---
That chair spooked the fuck out of me

No it couldnt have. Me stating bluntly op worded his post like shit was an important part of how that reads, along with the "good idea but do it right" part. Read ops post and then read the tone of my reply. Yeah i am a cunt on this sub sometimes but not in this thread. Ty for noticing me though.
---
same! back in 2005 when i got runecrafting to 50 using only fire runes.
---
Virtual level 126 requires 188.884.753 xp though.
---
"should it be something small and unofficial... Okie something large and official" you forgot the third option, nonexistent.
---
Haha! I’m sure I’ll see you again! RSN is same as here!
---
ay thats well proper innit
---
&gt;also fiber is exelent for intestinal cleance
---
To an extent, soluble fiber is beneficial. To eat 1000g carbs from fibrous sources would involve 300g fiber or more, which could easily land someone in the emergency room pending bezoar surgery.
---
&gt; mantain the glucose levels balanced instead of having glucose peaks
---
Spiking blood glucose is not always bad. It's highly beneficial following an intense workout. Insulin is one of the primary hormones involved in muscle protein synthesis.
---
If I'm a HCIM can I go to beta worlds to test fighting bosses and the like without losing my hardcore status?
---
pick those bananas boy
---
Exactly like that :) it's way easier to get motivated to grind a few lvls if all the other task in the section is already completed
---
I’m giving an option to someone. If they didn’t learn their lesson then they will be banned again and unable to appeal
---
didn't ask
---
Na there being realistic you know how many women you see walking about with there phones almost dropping out of there back pockets must be the same with ham women 😂
---
Pretty sure he’s actually a slayer master
---
Alright you got me, still need an acc + tbow tyvm, you can msg the details to me here if you like
---
I finally got around to the Varrock medium after a year the other day and man, idk how I went so long without that GE tele
---
Well i appreciate your input kind stranger.  ill for sure give this a go.
---
 Не ну норм туса а хренли у них нет футболок?
---
I think its OP but also don't think its fucking up the game mode. It IS the game mode at this point. Its funny too, because I'm pretty sure most of the people complaining don't play the game mode (I also don't). So why do they care so much?
---
the gilded chad is stuck on the brawler, i love it.
---
Yeah you call it opportunity cost. Another interesting one (but not the case here) is sunk cost fallacy. 
---
Example (if your only objective is xp): If you've done a lot of motherlode mine to unlock the upper area and the large sack for better rates, you could argue that you've already done that investment and should not change to blast mine because of it. 
---
However looking at it **now**, blast mine still gives better rates and thus you should do that.
---
and they already shit themselves as compost
---
It's either a 0 or a fucking 80 lmao
---
Yes and you can't reach 127 with 200m XP but other people in this post already explained why the cap is 200 mill.
---
yeh sure but remember that once the peak of insuline falls the metabolism starts to use gluconeogenesis to create sugar using proteins and fats .. so u are losing muscle .. this depends obviously on the type of training too
---
DOOR STUCK! DOOOOOR STUCK!
---
Just get google Authenticator

Do you mean you only speak 'murican?

98rc, no pet :( I got 4 mining pets and 3 fishing pets but none of the other skilling pets, I'd gladly trade a heron for one of yours.

You can always easily check these things on the osrs wiki, very usefull if you about to keep playing the game. :)

Enjoy
---
I can carry you through later today if you want. (It’ll take about 35-40 mins)You could pretty easily solo it if you wanted to though, it’s just going to take you a while, especially since you’re not familiar with mechanics.
---
Maybe you just got a lucky break then. Because normally if you reach out to Twitter support you will get a round robin + same links and being told well you shouldn't have botted then.
---
Think it would be more like the blowpipe/scythe/sang where it has to be emptied before being tradeable

I hope you find a permanent solution. That website is always German for me. There's a flag in the bottom right corner of the website that allows you to change the language, but it only lasts untill you reload the page.
---
Firstly, thank you for responding. I’m glad I’ve broken through!
---
I already have but I fear it’s absolutely pointless as I’m just going to receive an automated response. I’ve spent hundreds of hours and £ on this game over the years and I have a right to know exactly what I’ve been accused of doing with an actual human looking into the problem.
---
Can you guarantee this will be dealt with fairly?
---
Can you guarantee I will receive a detailed report of exactly what my character has supposedly done?
---
Can you guarantee that this won’t simply be dealt with by a bot?
---
Are Jagex mods capable of admitting mistakes? Or will selecting the mistake option chuck my appeal in the bin?
---
Can I speak to someone over the phone to resolve this like at any other mmorpg?
---
Can I receive more than copy and paste TOS?
---
Again I’ve been playing for years including pre-OSRS. I feel that as players and customers, we all have a right to have these questions answered.
---
Ayeee, either these or gonna but a little white cone on my red suede 5s for D boots

Thanks!

If you’re up for the challenge you can do an obby mauler. And to further that do a 10hp obby mauler. Then, there are staff of the dead pures which can be expensive but very strong. Next, Ive seen 75def pures wearing stuff like justiciar. Also I’ve seen 14 def and 42 def pures also. For certain gloves and other equipment.
---
I will as soon as I figure out how to copy the original format.
---
Btw btw, btw btw
---
Basically this game has so little interactivity between players for most stuff we do (besides bossing, few minigames and trading that's done through GE now) so all we do is just "nice"...
---
Excuse me wtf
---
Christ
---
And another 10-15ish for some herblore levels and supplies to start learning. Not bad at all tbh.
---
How does that actually happen? I understand perfectly what the claim is.

Could hardcore ironman achievement page on website be updated with information displaying when it was last time updated?
---
Enter pvp, get pvp'd. You can't tell someone is HCIM until they say something which is often times not until you've already attacked them. Gl
---
And if you needed a law rune to teleport out you better be prepared to pay 1k
---
Torso is great. I have a shit ton of raids kc using the torso before I had enough to buy the BCP
---
Nothing is preventing another mining skilling boss from being incorporated, so mining wouldn't be made redundant in regards to essence gathering. Even if not a skilling boss, it could at least be some form of skilling activity, instead of another gathering method that requires a mindless 10 second loop for 30 hours.
---
Some questions about Nightmare of Ashihama:
---
At RuneFest you called it a group boss like Corp, but is the difficulty/time to kill comparable to Corp too, or is it more like Nex and the raid bosses Olm and Verzik, just that you can fight them whenever you want like Corp? Will it be possible to solo the Nightmare, and if so, is it like Olm where it's designed to be solo'd or Verzik where it's possible to solo, just with a lot of tickeating?

But the problem is that pvpers are forced to kill pvmers so forcing all wilderness activity into less worlds just means pvmers have to fight other pvmers to get the things they need while pvpers still mostly only have pvmers to kill.
---
Doesn't fix the problem at all, just condenses it.

Okay I had that happened, they removed the ban, I still had a form of a keylogger or they somehow knew my password anyways I had an account banned for Account Hijacking, when I recovered it said Account Hijacking (quashed) I then changed the info then like the next day it was perm banned for the same thing. I contacted mods on Twitter and got a response it was looked into and actually banned for botting. Yet when I tried using the new appeal system I cant because it says account hijacking.
---
Exactly, I love the concept of making use of storage options most accounts don't bother with or even know exist, like the clue scroll storages for some weapons and armor. It's being clever with what you have available, which is pretty much the entire point of the game mode.
---
I am also at 0 TOB KC waiting for mentors in wdr. Learning COX in wdr is super easy but I haven't been able to get a mentor yet and I've been trying the past couple weeks now.
---
Generally accepted is 90+ combats except for prayer but you dont need great gear, maybe like 50m total inc dwh
---
This makes me sad
---
Great memeing 🏅
---
No voter for what ? Everything? It’s also useful for pvmers..
---
I feel like they could do this at least for untradables like if you used the item on the book. Would be silly for main accounts to have that work for tradables. So for ironmen it would just work for all of the items presumably right?
---
Can you please update the clue reward storage in POH so that each piece of a set is storable as a bit stored/notstored for collection log? Nobody is going to store full 3a lol.
---
Also UIM barrows sets when?

Can we get priffdinas agil pet rate

I really wanna do the elite fremmenik diary for noted Dagganoth bones but im a loooong way off

Exactly lol. FINALLY training prayer in the the damn wildy😂

pick those bananas ~~boy~~ matey

Can you look into changing the crystal pickaxe to only use charges when mining and not when attacking? Right now it punishes you for upgrading your pickaxe when you do the guardians room in cox.

Yes

You ever have dreams where you're far away from home and you're stuck and don't know how to get back then you just think "Oh yeah, I can home teleport!"

I love how much it all subtley relates

Can we have the stats of both versions of the Hunllef for the wiki? We can't monster examine it, and the gauntlet has been out for a while, so I don't see the harm in it.
---
Could we get a unique teleport animation for the Quest Cape? I've really enjoyed the tp animations for the diary items and I think it would be a nice addition to the game.
---
Contracts did make herb easier, they were however needed pretty significantly. I wouldn’t say they’re op. Grinder and seaweed on the other hand is still significantly slower xp/hr than charters
---
I dont get it, what's wrong with pvp? Why does pvp need to be done consistent form of money making? It's not and was never meant to be. You make money pking from the stuff people drop when they die. Why is this such a hard concept for people to grasp?
---
I imagine not many people want to sponsor relatively small/niche youtubers like OSRS channels and they just have to take what they can get, hence why we always see the same sponsors over and over. I could be wrong though
---
Hard pass

They could buff Shades of Mort'ton, which is a interesting way of training, but it's not really that afk.

Lol the set effect isnt that useful anyway, just wear you skillcape anywhere. When youre standing still for more than 1 minutes, put the graceful cape on for the effect
---
Idk I feel like the newbies might feel good about it as well
---
My best advice is to get a small group of trusted friends (id say 4-6 people) around your lvl and try to lock down a world at the southernmost point in revs (below 30 wilderness). We usually do that and we pk a lil bit too, so we can skull to access the rare drop table at revs. We almost always insta teleport at the first sign of a big clan. if you stay to see how big they are, you'll likely be TBed and die, maybe even get smited. after tping out, find another world and kill revs and pk there with your boys until you get rushed by another clan.

Then there's the fourth which is a 10hp account fixing the barricades and dying in one hit every twenty seconds

Mage zone is always better than splashing on a normal main.

Try using less effective prayers like Clarity of Thought, or if you're feeling frisky Mystic Might is a good choice. DWH spec accuracy seems to skyrocket when lowering your own accuracy.

&gt; You can't tell someone is HCIM until they say something which is often times not until you've already attacked them. Gl
---
Can easily tell with 3rd-party clients. The least-offending method is right-clicking them and examining them for a quick high-score lookup. The worst methods are plugins that literally point it out in real-time on-screen.
---
Got tassies from minions like 50 kills later, not worried about the undies
---
Nice!
---
The way it currently works is the way recoils work. If the traded version works the same way as it currently does(based on what Jmods have said) it would be an issue.
---
Money is zero time. I'm not even joking, cml assumes you have alts or other accounts providing all the money you need since you can theoretically just have 3 rune dragon alts making you tons of money while you train low intensity skills.
---
The EHP rate for rc on cml is lower because people complained about the difficulty of finding 4 runners just after zmi was nerfed. It's not an accurate representation of how much xp you can get per hour, just how much people felt was a fair amount when it was difficult to find runners. If you're talking about actual maximum xp rates, they're as high as 250k/hr.
---
Just click pixel perfect every single time lul
---
What's that?
---
Not really that many activities that require full graceful anyway, and even for activities that it's BIS for, the difference is often minimal.
---
If Rune pouches are tradable, will a separate tradable version be added in order to prevent trading pouches to have different runes. The way Jmods have said it works in the past has been that if you had multiple rune pouches they would all contain the same rune count.

I wonder what percentage of viewers actually download and play raid.
---
Because I know for me personally the more I hear it the less likely I am to download it. I would even say I would pay a small fee to never hear the ad again.

But it has to be working at least a little because raid still pays people to promote the game.
---
Extremely wicked, shockingly evil, and vile
---
Gj❤
---
I mean you're not wrong about going to forums and whatnot, but even then we still had things like runehq.  I'd say it's just more of the fact that many QoL things are able to be implemented, unlike when it was a clunky browser only game already pushing the limits.
---
Even though the lost feeling was something magical back then, that was kinda how a lot of games were.  Nostalgia aside, personally I would have really preferred to have most QoL things we have now back then, I think I would have loved the game even more!
---
I quit rs because I didnt know how to get out of draynor manor. No home teleports back then and I wasnt the brightest 8 year old

meanwhile, last night: https://i.imgur.com/aaRDWmE.png

And the fact that raid shadow legends is a straight asian market game it seems like a strange ad.

Are you using RuneLite? If so, reinstalling did the trick for me (something in the launcher was recently changed which fixed this issue I think)

Four lokos nowadays are just alcoholic toxic waste. Legit bruised my ribs throwing up after i drank two of them and there’s no caffeine anymore so it’s not even as good.

I feel attacked.
---
But you are absolutely correct.
---
You are the hero we needed.
---
Runelite does not allow you to one click offer bones or get construction xp like that or abuse any xp. It hasn't been able to in years. The only menu entry swapping available that will give you an advantage xp wise is making it so you can one click ardy knights. If you think people should have to right click and manually pickpocket every single time, you're just not a normal human being. Nobody wants arthritis in their wrists when they are 35 years old.
---
The runelite solving puzzles is the only difference between sitting the two. Again, that is just a nuisance and takes unreasonably long amount of time to do a boring activity for rewards that almost always arent worth it. If I didnt have runelite to solve those puzzles I would drop the clue. 
---
It failed the poll because it would not be included in pvp areas and runelite already had the plugin that worked everywhere at that point in time. There was really no need for people to vote yes to that poll. Again its not giving anyone an unfair advantage so I'm not sure why you would have an issue with it. 
---
The funny thing is, jagex 100% knows that thosw plugins you specifically listed exist. They are and have been some of the most popular third party plugins for a while now. If jagex didnt think they should be in the game, or considered them cheating, they would have included them in their ban list.... but they didnt.
---
Hell ya it is. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks would prolly net you 400m, w/o rare drops
---
Gratz man
---
Also right before killing the second Mager you shouldfully pot and I put dragon darts in the bp and restore prayer so I don’t need to touch inventory throughout the fight.  
---
I turn sound off and had a few beers and put a show on the background 
---
The biggest issue is being relaxed
---
This is gonna sound fucking crazy to most, and I know it's not efficient, but I had very similar stats to you and did Zulrah range only for at least 200kc before I even bothered with a mage switch.
---
Not only do you not have to worry about switches, it also gives you a lot more food space for when learning.
---
Kills are only about 20% longer in my experience, and I found it MUCH easier to learn :)
---
Recoils is an in-server non-item hard-coded issue. How it works is non-existant, but we can say the same as a dfs, but a dfs requires discharging before trading. Lets take a ring of suffering that requires an item charge, you have to destroy the recoils before trading. Name a single item-loaded item that can be traded with the items inserted.

Yea that's definitely a thing. I've never even been lucky enough to see a tbow in my 700+ kc, but I've had several friends and random people tell me it's happened to them. I just focus on getting as many points as possible and hope for the best. Tbh, I feel like I'm less likely to get scammed in that chat than in one of the random clan chats that exist. Even the big ones I'd feel less comfortable. Unfortunately, my irl friends are all either to low of a level or to incompetent to raid so those are the only options available to me.

Pm Spoontech#0001 if you ever want to set up a fight
---
because you bank more often and you dont get xp while banking
---
take the example to the extreme and i think its easy to see.
---
imagine having 1 inventory space and banking every time u filled it. that would be much less xp/hr than having 28 spaces.
---
27 spaces compared to 28 is a much lower reduction of xp/hr but it is still a reduction

Out of single item piece of equipment.

Inferno cape, Torso, Void, Fire Cape would probably be the more expensive ones.

Get a max cape then
---
Did they say what game or where he is going?
---
Yeah, but i thought they specifically said something about knowing when/where npcs respawn, since it gives an edge at contested npcs, such as basilisk knights at day 1. And yes, I’m aware that all the information in the plugin can be observed in game.
---
I'm curious why crystal armor is so heavy. It weights more than black dragonhide, karils and armadyl ranged armors. Is there a reason for this? Would it be good to decrease crystal armor weight to make it more useful at Sara boss? I personally always had the feeling that

I'll be the first one who quit the game if this happened.

Thank you for the replys boys! Much appreciated

Pvp is in the minority nowadays. So the people exploiting the wilderness with ragger protection just is a way of adapting for them.

Personally I think the pvp updates shouldn't be for the wilderness.

Im sure he can find another 30 yr old man disguised as a girl on osrs.
---
I kinda feel ya on that when im almost always the MvP. Seems like non mvp youll get fat 200-500k droppys and mvp u get 60-120k + the 10k mvp droppy
---
shut the gate noob
---
Yes but if it's tradeable, then said clans can just do a dozen torso and sell em for 50+m instead of 25
---
This topic is up for debate. You're more than welcome to come in cc and collaborate with us. I do not appose to meds joining I have a few buddies who are meds.

I would like a spec too which would add to some of the lesser damage buff. A spec similar to MSB would be nice as the set already has good accuracy

Oh, Bob himself. Purveyor of deforestation!

you can flinch kq at like 40 combat

Crystal armour really needs a buff
---
I have done a lot of zalcano hunting for pet. 99% sure he is right. But then again it might be due to me overthinking jt. But at this point I try not to get mvp because of it. Definately should be looked into.

I got my first whip at roughly 7k kc. It was before collection log (or at least before I knew what collection log was) I'm at 98 slayer, do all my tasks and I've seen 4 whips now though.

Can I do the Halloween event as f2p and get the skins and the poh stuff when I resub automatically or will I have to be p2p when I start it
---
What gear and levels would you recommend? I have maybe a 30m bank, base 85 atk str Def, 80 mage range, 70 herb 70 pray.
---
They've responded to this in the past by saying that they *could* update the poh storage systems to allow individual items instead of sets, but performing such an update would create some risk of items that are in existing storage to disappear or be altered (e.g sets which currently have a plateskirt could change to platelegs). The problem isn't in the separation of the slots in the storage system, but rather the risk of making people lose items while performing the update.
---
I think there's a way around it though. They could add some kind of "final level" storage for the treasure chest, armour case etc, which has individual pieces of sets instead of needing the full sets, and is independent from existing containers. Doing it that way would mean players could manually transfer the individual items to the new storage system if they want, in doing so guaranteeing that the exact items they had stored are not changed or lost.
---
I'd attempt to, but I'm a shitter so would probably lose
---
How can you agree?? He disagreed with you.
---
So I just finished the restless ghost quest still had it equipped. It took me a lot longer than I would like to admit why I couldn’t start the Halloween event.
---
Yeah, it really is. I have over 90m slayer xp, what about you?
---
I don't even understand why Hydra is task only in the first place. Even with t bow and maxed gear, on task, Vorkath and Zulrah are better cash. Literally only reason I like Hydra better is because it's not as tedious as Zulrah and T bow actually functions at Hydra unlike at Vorkath. Task only is a completely idiotic game mechanic that just wastes people's time and slayer points.
---
Lmao shut up boomer
---
Okay, but isn't the Wildy supposed to be for massive clan wars? If I remember right, back in the day that's all anyone saw there. It was the fun of it. Or I could be mistaken, because I was young and never PvP'd back then.
---
You can buy a lobster pot. I think you’re SOL for the bowl though

Bankstanding at lummy back in the day, you could get a random 5k every now and then from people trying to get a law rune.

I disagree. I am an IM but I don't think I need special privileges.

Sone ironman are entitled little twats and make us normal players looking for a solo experience like whiny kids

Someone suggested in my cc that I choose the "Unable to access your account" option when you login and it prompts you for the authenticator, I did that, and for whatever reason that worked without getting an error message. So it's all good now.

You can go and blame maxed mains for complaining that BIS items slaughtered a level 60 slayer monster.
---
And there's the tu quoque
---
i see that dog a lot south of varrock west bank (by the anvils), you could just world hop in that spot til you see him. i dont think he ever leaves the west part of the city.
---
I don't disagree, but a crucial difference is that the monsters that pvmers are using these tricks on don't get a vote. These individuals who choose to manipulate the system are making a choice that they have to know is going to impact the way their victims vote in pvp/wildy polls. They're contributing to the slow death of one of the most iconic parts of the game, for nothing more than their own short term gain.
---
I agree that it would be nice if Jagex would address these issues, but I also think each player needs to get their priorities straight. Play the game the way it was originally designed to be played, or be the driving force behind it's death. I feel bad for the pvp/pkers that actually want what's best for the game. They get a bad name by association, and have to suffer most the negative impact that these other "pkers" bring about through their actions.
---
Yeah you're right actually. I didn't think about switching the loot viewer to each kill/instance. I usually just keep mine as a collection of all drops from a certain monster. Good point.
---
Ooooh, interesting, thanks!

8 year old me got stuck in Draynor Manor for the longest time... good times.

There are so many places outside of the wildy that almost rely on having so many world and sometimes I still have to spend half an hour plus just to find a free world. I'm not a PvPer so I could be very wrong here but isn't the whole point of things like LMS and bounty hunter for that reason exactly to bring together the PvPers.

There is no way to get the bowl, no. Uimslayonly has been petitioning for a spawn to be added and it's a bit of a meme.

Can crystal ranging setup set bonus give 45 % accuracy bonus instead of 30 % ?
---
phostus is right.  Heard of random variables my dude?
---
6 numbers are clickable
---
there are a total of 10 numbers that can be chosen from, for each digit in the pin
---
so your chance of the first digit being clickable is 6/10
---
there are a total of six digits in the pin itself, so you would multiply
---
(6/10)\*(6/10)\*(6/10)\*(6/10)\*(6/10)\*(6/10)
---
which is equal to
---
(6/10)\^6
---
 = 0.046656
---
= 0.047 (rounded)
---
= 4.7%

No, she’ll teleport you to Karamja when you’re trying to go to edge

It does, you can check by trying to wear one in a tourney world.

I think it’s unfair to blame it all on ironmen.  The average player doesn’t talk to anybody else and plays this game alone.
---
I don’t know man I’ve experienced single way combat teams since like 2008/2009. Nothing really new about it. People have just become more efficient about their ways.

It's coming with the new morytania expansion but we don't know when exactly. Pretty sure the blog said it would be obtained with some vampire shit but you can check the blog to verify, I'm not 100% on that

I'm pretty sure it was just a picture of a dog with one of those little costumes on and someone put a picture of Olmlet over it

The countries that format with commas (1,000,000.00) are *all* English-speaking countries, not just North America. It is not too far-out to think that they formatted it wrong since this is an English-speaking subreddit based on a game made in England.

I feel like you just project your shitty attitude onto other people for the sake of making yourself feel better, you seem like a really miserable person. Get a grip.

Yeah frontline single handedly ruined bh 44s by abusing the teleport to target system. Clans that DDoS and dox should be held accountable by Jagex.

theyll let you "antilure" a zgs or something in the 1-10m range, then try to get you to swap roles and be the bait or some shit like that.

I enjoyed telling people to ready their buckets and spamming "bail bail bail" when it was time. Made the boredom pass by a little faster.
---
brother you can do it in  dhide top, bot, vambs and glory and a rune kite. you dont need things like archers, rangers, holy sandals, odium ward, fury. if you happen to have things better than a rag range setup bring them sure but dont bother buying stuff like that for caves.
---
The chance you get anything worth splitting at KBD is very small
---
That's just an excuse. I wouldn't criticise anyone for attacking an IM in the wilderness, I mean, that's the point of the wilderness. But don't pretend you'd do it for some noble reason.
---
Can you think about adding a pj timer all around the wild?
---
its annoying getting into a singles fight in deep wild, only to have a team of 20 people in void/ancestral login to spec trade u after you've used up half your food fighting a bait account. if this were to be implemented then maybe you could make it so player attacks take priority over NPC's. to prevent npcs from pjing as well.
---
My man wasted his time copy pasting zenytes just for some internet points and now you called his ass out.
---
Why you ruin this mans sweet internet points!
---
They had 5 years to say, "This is against the game mode."  
---
Instead, they continued to add various more methods of death storage.  Clearly, it's intended.
---
You're losing me. I definitely agree with your main point about riding solo wild PKing, but what do current death mechanics have to do with PvP? Ignore that idiot. Anyone with a brain, who genuinely cares about the long term health of the game or the economy, should recognize how important pvp is.
---
Kid just got smited for 1m

Could there be a No Skulling option in the Player 'Attack' options setting ingame? With the option you should become interrupted when performing something that would skull you. It would stop skull tricking and improve anti-pking fighting methods in deep wildy.
---
PJ timer needed
---
So to be clear, your thesis is that the number of pkers pking in the way you don't like is too high, which means the number of pkers overall will go to zero; and reddit needs to be the one to do something to prevent?
---
Why would the laptop ask to turn off as soon as it's unplugged from the wall? Sounds like a dying machine to me
---
Don't get me wrong I love these, but for the next one can actually make it into a greentext? Just go to one of the sfw boards.
---
It already receives most of it's comparable DPS from it's higher accuracy. Not sure 15% more would really make much extra difference but anything to make it viable
---
I wish actually good questions like this got more attention
---
Did she? Cause from what people said she unplugged his laptop trying to charge her phone lol
---
Want an actual unpopular opinion? PvP, even more specifically the wilderness, in RS has never been good and the better the player base gets as a whole the more obvious and flawed it becomes leading to needing all of these updates and people spite voting them down because many never had a good experience with it to begin with.
---
someone needs to make some bots that hop worlds and close this mans door
---
Easy rc xp is the varrock museum. Theres a few quests to turn in to the people for xp lamps. The mini quest for ghostly robes gives you a 10k xp lamp as well. Doing all that got me to around 55 rc adding diary lamps to.
---
Osrs streamers laughs at the mtx in rs3 being p2w and manipulating

This is not an unpopular opinion.

What’s that gold pickaxe?

The comment didn't rag on anyone, it ragged on CrossFit lol, so your high road response is just a thin veil failing to cover your saltyness.

I have it set to 57. The render distance is fine, I'm just curious if there's a way to render as you run, I stead of having to hit the black wall before rendering the next area. On mobile, when I zoom out fully, I can see the black walls rending one tile at a time while I'm moving. But on Runelite, it just renders one big block and you have to get to the edge of it before rendering the next big block.
---
Oh, come on, it's not a sign of extreme ignorance to be unaware of other countries' punctuation systems.
---
It’s not abuse it’s next level shit , I won’t tell you our method but it involves teamviewer and is more intricate than some some log in and out methods or bait and switch
---
Yes, cats are people too.
---
The rabbit hole does go very deep. Also, a war doesn't have to be just people shooting and throwing missiles at eachother; the Cold War didn't have much of that, for example.

I'd love to see the answers to this question! I'd put it directly South of Lumby Castle, bridging the courtyard and the swamp, for easier access to the swamp. Also lol 104 shortcut in Lumby

This comment got me crying in the club right now  
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
Just afk nmz and play another game for a month if you’re burnt out
---
It’s located in a PvP zone which inherently makes it at least partially PvP combat, as doing it will result in you being in PvP at some point
---
Easy guy. It's a game that can teach patience, Not the way of life
---
I love these because i follow the link on a separate machine and just shitpost into all the text fields
---
Oh ok. Best of luck to ya
---
Hm, I see your point but I don't think there's a lot of correlation between death mechanics and anti-pvp pvmers. I still play safe in pvm, cuz it's annoying as fuck to retrieve your stuffs. And by 2008 gravestones were basically the same as current mechanics. I think some people just hate pvpers for no logical reason.
---
This is why 420 is the best world I went to a different world saw someone planting a swastika flower pattern so I turned it into a square.
---
Fairly certain that in order to unlock the slayer task, you only need to do DT up until the point you unlock access to the smoke dungeon, so right after you finish enchanting the mirrors. But you should finish DT anyway because you can't burst dust devils without the ancient spellbook

You mention warrior guild tokens but why bother if you can just but the defender itself

No such thing

Dense essence blocks for that 300k rc xp/hr
---
doubtful tbh. people pay ~15m for a torso which takes *4 people* an hour to get. an infernal cape can be achieved by one person in an hour and a half, by more people than can do max efficiency BA.
---
i think it's very easy to say they'd be more as someone who has never done inferno and romanticizes its difficulty but it's a lot like jad in that once you have it figured out, it's pretty much figured out. if they were 20m+ then literally every single person who has ever successfully completed the inferno would just start doing inferno for money lol, it wouldn't stay that way for long at all.
---
They already showed that the bank and teleport arnt very close at all to the boss.
---
They've also expressed never wanting to introduce more poh method bosses in the pass.

If someone doesn't care about losing HC status, what is the incentive to ever bother starting a regular iron man? Since you won't have to restart your account if you die, wouldn't it be fun to see how far you make it on HC mode? Only con I can find is having your dead HC stats tied to your account on the Hiscores.
---
Mod gambit said he would provide the amount of gp coming into the game from effigies, can we get an update on these?
---
I've never been skull tricked but thanks for the concern.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;but at the end of the day, you’re the one in control of your clicks.
---
That's where you're wrong.
---
The bigger issue is this guy is using team viewer to take control of victims computer mouse.
---
We can never have the old death mechanics unfortunately. They very outdated
---
The fact is it's 2019 and any script kiddie can ddos.
---
I do however think they should update the death mechanics
---
Also the risk reward is super out of wack. To be able to fight back you need to gear for both pvm and pvp, so you’re already risking atleast double your opponent, who got the drop on you anyway
---
It's much closer to 2m/hr than 1m
---
Not everyone is so rich that passive 30k per day is useless.
---
Hi scapers
---
I mapped out the recently added Priff red chinchompa area. There are 9 spawns in total and I think they're the most densely packed in the game, but anecdotally I get much higher XP in the feldip hills cave (Hard Western Prov achievement diaries) due to the higher number of total spawns and more open area. A map of that one is here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/38rznt/red\_chinchompa\_hunting\_area\_spawn\_map/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/38rznt/red_chinchompa_hunting_area_spawn_map/)
---
Most of them yes. The 75 def pure is the only one that you’d want to protect an entire set of armor. That I can think of.
---
But if you went like 13/40/42 def you’d still change your attack based on what spec weapon you use.
---
I also forgot to mention range pures and range tanks. But even still if you were like 94range/94magic you’d still protect item on your Dragon Crossbow or like a Dark Bow.
---
Its based on "value", but high alch value is directly tied to this "value"
---
So it's far to say its tied to high alch
---
Addicted stakers lose their bank and buy gp to feed their addiction
---
Gp is cheaper through rwt than through bonds
---
Addicted stakers rwt lots of gp
---
Since there isn't really a point at which they stop (addicted), they eventually lose all their money again and the cycle continues
---
Because there is a consistent market for gp, gold farmers are a much bigger presence than they otherwise would be
---
Gold farmers create a large supply of gold
---
Not to mention the stakers who allegedly sell their gp for real money, contributing to rwt from the other side
---
First of all why does everyone think I do crossfit? I don't as I've said before but whatever moving on. 
---
Read up dude I clearly say it's not bad except for if they're bad trainers or you don't know what you're doing.
---
I don't even know what to do with this argument. So are you saying if you play a sport then you shouldn't workout because there is always someone stronger on the team at you and the coach is yelling at them and you get caught in the crossfire? Like I said you get hurt if you don't know what you're doing, but that can be said about anything. You go to yoga, oh okay she's telling that person to go deeper let me just pull my muscles to match. 
---
If you think crossfit is bad do you also think HIIT is bad? You ever played a sport at any point in time? You're literally doing what crossfit does every morning if you have played a competitive sport...it's just not at a sanctioned crossfit gym
---
I told my friends who r in a single team and they said the wildy isnt dying lmao
---
Thanks, the NEXT kills pretty much guaranteed to be it at this point :)
---
And Cuba developed cancer vaccines by not committing nazi-like war crimes. There’s no excuse.
---
Ayyyy vamos na osrs gente
---
It's too PIC to show the pic of the guy who uses that set
---
I see your point. When I go to the wild to kill monsters or bosses I go with “anti-pk” gear. The items I protect can be very expensive and give me that fighting edge over the majority of PKers in the wild as the majority are raggers.
---
^ That still isn’t a fix or remedy to the concern but it’s mine and many others solution.
---
I'm gonna stop reading at your first sentence. I never said you do crossfit or that I think you do. I'm not even sure if you clearly read my post at this point or not.
---
I’m not saying both sides are equally bad, I’m left as fuck. But literally the same bullshit you’re spewing has been said by people on both sides.
---
People highlight their sides merits and point out the other sides faults. 
---
You are heavily biased. I’m biased too but I also recognize I’m biased, and that people on the right have their own principles that cause them to think the way they do. 
---
Trump has done well in some aspects and completely awful in others, I could cherry pick and obviously you could too as evident by your comments.
---
Agreed, these aren’t even even actual mechanics of the fights, they’re just shitty side effects
---
\+1 worlds were pure cancer.
---
Some along the lines of 'oi cunt, you won't finish it'
---
Compared to most MMOs its pretty good
---
Same boat, once every couple years I can come back for a bit, but I burn out so much faster each time. No update would really bring me back though. I check the sub a lot still
---
Should have kept it to yourself.
---
oh my b, misunderstood
---
"people not jumping at the opportunity to talk politics in a runescape sub means I'm right"
---
True!
---
Who cares, though? It's not against the rules anymore unless you're doing it in a competitive game mode
---
65,535 isn't that much
---
/s
---
I don't disagree with you here but at the same time you should make it a priority to gtfo that clan immediately and get that guy banned. It will weed out all the idiot leaders and you can't really expect Jagex to be responsible for this. As a pker, if you see another pker using scout bots and generally abusing and breaking game rules, collect some evidence and report them.
---
One less idiot in the wilderness means there is room for some newbies to try their hand at pking.
---
aha
---
Say a wrong statement that made the game worse?  I mean yeah I guess
---
Actual reason wilderness PKing is "dead': there's no point to bring squat out there. Compare the stats of absolute cheap-ass "welfare" gear to the next steps up, especially in the ranged category. The "welfare" setups are 90% of the stats at one five-thousandth the price. 
---
No PvM content you placed out there could possibly worth gambling the extra thirty-eight million to risk an Armadyl top compared to a black d'hide one, for example. I can't even imagine what the rewards would have to be to make that kind of added risk worthwhile. I've seen proposals for "wilderness barrows" or other high-payoff PvM but I absolutely guarantee that people would be tackling it in cheap-ass black d-hide and glories. 
---
So yeah, that's how you get to where we are now: either people bring nothing, or welfare gear. Salad robes, dragonhide, and maybe a Dinh's because you can't skull back and lose it if you're not attacking. 
---
I have no suggestions for fixing it. I think it's actually hopeless.
---
That is a unique problem you have there friend. Is this a new issue or have you never been able to log in on phone.
---
don't mind him much. (He has a brain injury)
---
You can’t say “you guys” and expect a respectful response. I am and many many other people I know are not the ones participating in skill tricks and other shit tactics.
---
I thoroughly enjoy the pure(pun intended) excitement and thrill from the element of PvP.  I don’t want to prey on helpless pvm weenies. I want real fights in a “natural” setting and not in an arena or in a safe/protected area like the GE/lumbridge. I want to be in the WILD where anything goes. I want the risk. But when I take the risk and succeed I want the reward. Which there isn’t. When you remove PVMers from the wild and you make it profitable you will solve the majority of the issue.
---
Can we get a followup on last Q&amp;A's discussion about possibly keeping archaic emblems in the drop table for wilderness slayer?
---
Kieren made the point that old BH rewards (including cosmetics) have been available to ironman accounts for a long time, but if emblems are removed, then these rewards will basically become unobtainable.
---
This is awesome, thank you
---
Is there more than just this, the banker, and the master farmer ones? I love these things
---
I've written out this one, the banker one, and one about Phials - peep my profile for that one!
---
I skipped this question cuz I don’t have the slayer level and I don’t like making uninformed decisions. But yeah, I’ve heard this fight kinda sucks
---
Oh! I didn't realize. You're great dude! Please keep it up
---
Right?
---
You need to go further in the barbarian training mini quest. Once he tells you to make a pyre ship then you can hop in.

You ever see a squirrel run across a power line? I know I have. Have you ever seen a human run across one? I know I haven’t.

It's funny. I think the high risk worlds are held down by an Egyptian clan, a weird hybrid of American / Latin group holds all the 1250/1500s, and they have a mercenary clan they call/team with to clear and occasionally kill 1750 worlds. I think the 1750s team with another team as well

The cheapest pet would be the one that is most common.
---
If the bones” option wasn’t allowed then why is it still on the client? I really don’t think anyone is going to be banned for it. Runelite devs already removes everything that Jagex said to do so but honestly who the fuck knows anymore. 
---
I’m sure it’s all a conspiracy just so players will have to spend more time at the Wildy altar so that braindead pkers will have more time to kill people that aren’t going to fight back.
---
I'm confused how you got yourself in this situation
---
He’s the overlord
---
Clues say otherwise to that fact so..
---
Waaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa
---
same, if the average kill wasn't as profitable as it is i'd be more upset. but the money is just too good
---
Tar

You have the entire game, but this one made the entire game worse lmao
---
OP: "went pking today to kill non-pkers charging Glory's and training prayer and couldn't find any. Why don't pvmers come into wildy it's jagexs fault"
---
Does it matter?

It's like the old saying about trees falling. If no one knows it's a guy is it really a guy?

Yes, in a heartbeat.

And I could PM every person I could find in their CB bracket to assist in it.
