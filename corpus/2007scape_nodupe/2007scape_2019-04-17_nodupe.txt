Oh, honey...

Another thing to consider is that other players (mains) can help by tanking or luring or moving the boss for the ironman. So even though they don't do damage they help. For example if a main were to kill all the minions in GWD and the iron could attack the boss, or vice-versa.
---
Bro, I'm sayin'. Still listening to it on repeat.
---
That's the most scary thing to me. Our developers are thinking this is a good idea and ready to be shipped out (or at least polled). There are so many holes that need addressing before I would let this leave the drawing board.
---
I mean, I don't think you're wrong, everything could fit into other skills. But then again, a lot of other skills could fit into others as well.
---

---
Construction could be spread over wc and crafting
---
Smithing could also be a crafting sub tree
---
Firemaking could very well be part of woodcutting
---
Attack and strength could merged into melee
---
Runecrafting could fit into magic
---
It's not that a new skill is absolutely necessary to make those mechanics works, it's that it fleshes it out better and makes things not cluttered. Crafting already has a stupid amount of stuff in it, and relocating all arcane and magical things into "magical crafting" makes sense.
---
Being against a new skill strictly because it's a new skill is just fear of change, imo. Yeah it could be into magic/crafting/runecrafting, but that doesn't mean it's the best option to introduce those mechanics.
---
I don‚Äôt play anymore really and slayer is partly why.
---
  
---
It‚Äôs not a bad skill at all, Jagex just doesn‚Äôt know how to make the other skills get as much attention it does.
---
As someone who has been playing for a while and cannot kill zulrah but already has skrotizo pet, nah man, I can barely fucking get jad down, let alone inferno shit, its great you find this game fucking easy, but ALOT of people don't man. 
---
Add a new mechanic to raids for maxed only acc runs, versus various lvl runs. Let "max level" be considered lvl 121+, so anyone 121-126 would be in a higher grade/harder raid that could potentially drop better loot. In my personal opinion, add untradables to these raids, no matter if a person gets hacked, if they have the item insured for 50m (ya, if your doing endgame shit and you get BIS nontradeable OP item, 50m is a drop in the bucket to secure the item forever), they can get it back. 
---
They simply need to create new untradeable end-game gear in my personal opinion. The second it becomes tradeable, someone is going to learn how to optimally PK with these OP items, and they would change the pricing of other various things, scythe, tbow, etc.
---
Ideas on some items would be like: Helix staff (you can think of the design, lol), give it the ability to heal you, like a health drain from the opponent, would probably be one of the most op items within raids depending on its stats.
---
Corrupt Wand, skulls you, BIS, at the cost of 33% of current health, the next amount of damage would do double damage, but if the damage exceeds the amount of health points lost, the life is recovered. 
---
For ranged, I think they should add upgrade to crystal bow:
---
1 primordial/range/mage stone from cerberus + war (bando), holy (sara), unholy (zam) + crystal bow: 3 new intense crystal bow upgrades that are permanent making it the most cost effective and BIS bow, would be sweet af in my opinion.
---
For melee, they should do only one thing, allow claws to be poisoned, and allow items that can be dipped in poison, to be also dipped in a disease causing potion or something, that causes disease vs poison, giving the possibility to lower pure pkers prayer, magic level, defense, strength, etc. You could get luck or nah. 
---
ETC.
---
Now, is this a good idea, idk, I am not a pro, and I am not a large percentage of the community, I am just one burnout giving an opinion.
---
**TL;DR: Add non-tradeable end-game gear + a harder raid for lvl 121-126 teams, give them the option to do a "harder or brutal" version of the raid, higher farming req, herblaw req, etc, hell even add a potion upgrade or 2 within the higher tier raid. Allow these untradeables to be lost, not pkable, but must be insured if you want to use it. Have them require ANOTHER scroll, weapon enchantment scroll, worth 30-100m, which gives the untradable item the ability to be used in the wilderness/pking/rev caves.**

120 Slayer will pass in OSRS even without any new content.

The was when it stopped becoming popular. I pked every day back in the day and countless of my friends quit because of the ditch which is why I believe what I do.
---
Wrong about what?
---
Do like RS3 and let us use the skillcape on the hood to combine them for a model like this
---
Honestly that's how I feel about pretty much all armor/gear. Monsters should drop the loot and then skillers craft the gear. We get so much of our BIS armor and gear just from monster drops without even using skills.
---
As an ironman, AoE buffs and wards sound like a great way to never get a single loot drop from multi combat ever again
---
Crafting and Smithing could use a massive overhaul in general.
---
I can make Leather Chaps at 18 crafting, something useful for Level 1 Range.  THEN I can make Studded Chaps at level 44 crafting, for level 20 range.  It takes me 26 levels to realize, "Oh boy, I should add studs."
---
At least Smithing makes sense lore wise in metal tiers, but item wise?  Well I know how to shape this metal, but I seem to forget how to shape it into a Scimitar every so often, so I'll just make a dagger and med helm instead.
---
The current content could use a massive overhaul and make space for mage armor, actually allowing for skills to interact with each other.
---
We don't need a new skill that serves the same purpose as Crafting / Smithing, with niche activities like Conjuration thrown in to try to get it to pass.
---
The proposed skill is messy.
---
never even thought about it, can't unsee.

My arm's big adventure isn't a new quest.
---
Great brain Robert isn't a new quest, and the herb patch isn't a reward from it. It's an elite diary reward.
---
Hosidius favor isn't a quest.
---
Only ONE herb patch was added as quest reward since osrs release, and it's a sequal to the one quest that that previously rewarded you with an herb patch.
---
If you think there are too many herb patches fine. But blaming it on quest regards is actually retarded as fuck, because that's not what's been happening in os.
---
Battle wards = time to quit osrs on all my accs. 
---
Summoning wards = same as above
---
Can‚Äôt you just make the new armors an on use item similar to the kraken tent on whips. Use ‚Äúvenomous ward item‚Äù on ahrims or mystic to get 1000 hits with the benefits. Makes it more simple!
---
Keep it simple. Don‚Äôt get ahead of yourselves and excited in meetings saying oh let‚Äôs add this or that! Remember development principles.
---
also you may need to equip a shield that resists fire...
---
I imagine this is the approach they'd take, especially as this is essentially what RS3 did with trimmed masterwork armour, which requires melting down Torva and Malevolent armours, both of which come from high level bosses and can't be farmed in the same way d'hides or ores can be.
---
I love all the new robes ideas, they aren‚Äôt best in slot but I think they would all provide use, at some level or some situation, which is what I want out of Warding. It is a bit odd however that the dragon oriented gear for melee and ranged are weapons (crossbow &amp; Lance), but the mage version will be robes.
---
I feel like the genuine primary reason why people are voting no is simply because it‚Äôs a new skill and would mean another 99 before Max cape, which is really sad since I can see there has been a lot of thought and deliberation gone into this skill, and we are being worked with closely on it. Still not entirely sure I‚Äôd vote yes right now since the battle wards seem like genuine metabreaking for group PvM, but it does certainly fascinate me and a lot of the ideas are really cool
---
Lets hope they are doing a mazerunner and posting crazy shit in with the normal shit so people vote in the not crazy shit.
---
I would've hated it still. It wasn't fun lol
---
there are two mentor raids running right now for example.. are you looking in the right placE?
---
Are most players actually going to vote no to Warding?
---
dragon = elite

we do raids is, I find to be a bit unreasonably strict with their reqs, and wouldn't let him in without a dragon pick. They are super good though at teaching once you can get in.

I opened this next to my mom fuck me lol

Yeah no shit. I literally said you can tell the production value went up. Or are you incapable of reading?
---
I miss dungeoneering so much.
---
Original looks really good, only the new content is grey &amp; purple (Arceuus, Catacombs, you‚Äôre probably thinking there‚Äôs a lot of purple since you‚Äôre likely in the catacombs a lot) and the proposed version looks really similar to the thieving cape
---
Hahahahhahahahahahha
---
how do you know your not a vocal minority?
---
A lot of the updates that weren't Squeal of Fortune and Evolution of Combat were actually pretty cool. But people see stuff that is part of Runescape 3 and it immediately gets chinese telephoned out to "THIS PARTICULAR UPDATE IS THE EXACT SAME AS MTX AND EOC" and its really damaging for any kind of legitimate critical thinking towards updates and their effect on the game.
---
Voting yes out of spite
---
I disagree with most of this
---
+1
---
Please no warding
---
His production prior to the setup was good as well, that was my point. Smh my head
---
this is skillspecs, he literally suicides for content
---
Yeah, but you also don't have to do it if it's a minigame.
---
I mean, imagine if you need to sink quite a few CoX uniques to make Kinhunter armor. Or sink a shitload of scales to make Venemous Armor. And on top of that, combine ancestral robes with both of them.
---
It would be super expensive but it'd be suitable BiS for those bosses.
---
I mean you can use wards to summon things to fight for you...
---
Thanks a lot OP. Jagex are gonna see this and poll a new slayer master and 20 new slayer mobs at the expense of unique new pieces of content.
---
wow my feelings
---
dpick isnt an unreasonable req. learners/low kc raids do guardians very often and dpick is like a flat 9 or 10 max hit difference.

Wasted content

Im gonna qualify 50 alts now just to vote yes.

Ibans is same dps till 78 magic, and charging Ibans is easier than getting more enhancments from wildy slayer

VOTE NO TO WARDING
---
well thats mostly due to the fault of the new generation of games. Before runescape was one of the very few games that had an open world where you could interact with other players. However now people have like Fortnite, Overwatch, League, etc which give you instant gratification instead of extremely delayed gratification. The only reason people play osrs is purely for nostalgia.
---
Blaming it on quest rewards isn‚Äôt ‚Äúretarded as fuck‚Äù because you literally can‚Äôt use them without the quest. Yes the harmony island one isn‚Äôt a quest reward directly, but that entire area is useless without the herb patch. Again, it‚Äôs just annoying that new content areas (which typically means a new quest) are always brought in with an herb patch.

I see what you mean, but if anything, Magic shouldn't be the skill required for making it's own armor then. Farming might be a good fit (I believe the skill notes mention silkworm and flax farming of some sort).

But this still requires at least some level of crafting to weave fabric.

LOL

I'm also not at all seeing a need for a new skill. Like the other posters, I'm still catching up.

The nerf talked about 2 months ago in the q&amp;a stream

Oh the balancing! I‚Äôm sure this is an over site

It is pretty much the same anywhere yes. When rage streams got big for csgo cause of moe and steel everybody did that. When tutorials got big because of n0thing and seangares everybody jumped on that.
---
Usually there is 1-2 innovators. The rest follow
---
im responding to him saying that most of us don't want it.
---
Yeah it's pretty awesome
---
I think you severely underestimate how a bias affects results lol
---
Can't it be both?
---
I'm not against a new skill. Warding however is a cluster fuck of a skill that is acting like a catch all.
---
Look at melee. Mine ore, smelt ore, and forge.
---
Range? Kill monster, tan hide, craft.
---
Warding? Farm fiber, spin fiber, use hunter for silk, gather rune energy, rc soapstone, make ward, create clothing.
---
That is a dumb way of making mage armor that you can buy from a shop.
---
Problem 2. Look at mystic. Decent low level gear. Dark mystic is rarer than blue and there fore costs a little more. So now we can make different types of mystic? Or can we only make blue? If we can make different colors, we crash those prices.
---
Problem 3. High tier warding armor is as of right now only available from players making it. Now those players have the monopoly on it. That happened with RSC and rune platebody. Wonder why they added the ability to buy platebody later on.
---
Imagine a April fools joke gets taken more seriously than an actual skill devs been working on.
---
*Randoms see an extreme hyperbole from a 4chan brainlet using mod gee as clickbait*
---
"Oh shit, fuck warding"
---
not mutually exclusive.
---
with hunting rare drops, the GP/hr is almost always with the rare item factored in.
---
For example, doing Medium Clues is like 1.5 million an hour, but without ranger boots or other valuable rares like god pages, you're hemorrhaging 1m an hour.
---
I bet the only thing you've programmed is Hello World.
---
It maximizes profit because anything above 88% can give bolt racks
---
Gameplay time, total level, and XP are all perfectly rationale things to gate-keep on when you're trying to establish who has a more informed view of the game. Of course people with better accounts have more valuable opinions with regards to game balance. They've played much more of the content much more thoroughly. There's a reason voting rights used to be predicated on owning property in America.

---
I think this has been addressed. Because the music cape is revoked when new music tracks come out, they would also have to revoke access to the stash, but if they did that then players would have their items stuck in the stash until they re-earned their music cape. Ultimately it's just too many things to consider.

I want to see summoning rather than warding for sure. The uses for warding are niche at best.

---
&gt; You can pay ppl to run bones
---
You have higher APM doing that then just running bones yourself. You're not leeching. Dung or barb assault you can actually AFK. Join the floor/wave and literally walk away from your computer while someone else does all the work for you. That's a very distinct difference.
---
&gt; to have protection at rev caves, you can buy impling jars for clues 
---
Those aren't skills. They're money makers.
---
&gt; buy supplies for every buyable skill.
---
Yep, but you still have to do all the training yourself. You're skipping over the prep time, which is the nature of buyable skills that need elsewhere gathered supplies. 
---
&gt; Also im not sure why group activities are a bad thing for an mmo? 
---
Never said it was bad. I said it was a minigame.
---
&gt; They made solo DG way better through buffs and updates too.
---
They made group dung way better too :p It's still vaaaaaaastly better to be using a group, but that's still only 1 aspect of what makes it a minigame. You could technically play cwars by yourself too if you really wanted by starting with alts.
---
----------------------------
---
Try and come up with a definition of what a RS minigame is. Then come up with a definition of what a skill is.
---
Just try and come up with something that makes dung seem more like a skill, and all the other minigames not.
---
Nah, you‚Äôre just a douche.
---
THE GAUNTLET
---
do you read dev blogs
---
Will runecrafting ever receive an update to make it less of a teleport and run skill? You could possibly add some of the proposed warding ideas as a part of runecrafting instead.
---
Me agree
---
PvPers could vote yes for better PvP content offered by buffing Magic combat which would come from a magic rework like warding. So they can teleblock barrage in better stat'd gear.   
---
This isn't the same as a skill that lets you pick what logs to use to cook fish.
---
The type of person who'd send someone death threats over a reddit meme probably can't get out of their chair to begin with, not to worry.

---
Spamming this won‚Äôt change minds lol
---
I don't want to spend my time getting into it so very extremely simply imagine this.
---
Jagex wants yes, for every no someone puts in two yesses are added. We'd never know
---
Regardless of the reason people are voting yes, so long as they are, that new content still needs rewards.
---
100% agree. Pak-yaks are just horrible. Camping bosses like that becomes far to easy. IIRC the strategy with pak-yaks was to bring a backup because you would be there so long that your first would time out and you have to use another to hold all your shit. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt image what it would do to HCIM. Ezscspe times 10.
---
I don't understand this opinion. Farming and construction were just as foreign concepts seen from outside from people who never tried em out. Once you get used to them they're pretty easy.
---
I'm sure warding will be the same. It didn't seem very complex, just a few words we're not used to hear.
---
how did it shift the health of the game?  people didnt even use the dg items in the wild because everything protected over them, and the bis gear was just weapons and shields (shields which we are currently lacking in game as useful).
---
Summoning is painfully game breaking
---
Fair enough. I guess i can see that
---
People don‚Äôt give a shit, everyone is tired of the same people‚Äôs tweets getting posted constantly

---
Same :D
---
Why do we need new patches for flax?
---
We have allotments or hops that could just be literally re-purposed for the same thing (tweak the name if you REALLY need to).
---
Should be as simple as: grow the flax, make it into cloth, infuse it with something magical (whether this is the disenchant stuff or something you make from warding on its own), craft the fucking robe/gear.
---
The "something magical" part doesn't need 600 steps to stop mystic from needing its alch price changed (or people would just make bank every farm run with the flax).
---
It just needs to have a certain amount of effort or time into that ONE STEP (like taking something to the elemental RC altars maybe) and then you need xx number of what you just made to add to the cloth.
---
No need for the billions of tedious steps.
---
Hahaha
---
The clue step is literally the biggest pain in the ass out of every single clue step and half the time I consider just dropping the clue for it. Also, unless I missed something ZGS is only used by people skilling in the wildy.
---
I think it seems like a good way to jump start the skill. There is a ‚Äútangible‚Äù use for raising the skill that will urge people to do it regardless of whatever else they think of the skill.
---
The community actually wanted results hidden until the vote was cast and jagex to explicitly condemn 3rd party clients from conducting "exit polls" thatd be available before voters vote... but this is better than nothing. 
---
It is a bit fishy that they're pushing a controversial (and imo shitty) warding skill less than a week after completely hiding results tho hmm.....
---
Looking forward to our new skill, will be a nice way to add magic robes into the game, been looking forward to a new skill.
---
Sailing is the same thing as slayer given the following:
---
Slayer = get task to kill X monsters for combat EXP &amp; slayer EXP
---
Use slayer EXP to level up to access skill-exclusive monsters &amp; items
---
Use slayer tasks to train combat faster (black mask slayer helm)
---
Kill skill-exclusive monsters for valuable drops / Best in Slot (BiS) items / Task
---
Repeat for $$$ or EXP or Fun.
---
Sailing = build ship + make map + hire crew to go place for EXP &amp; Travel
---
Use sailing EXP to level up to access skill-exclusive areas with monsters, items, activities, and skilling nodes
---
Use sailing EXP to level up to build the new ships, host, voyages, and draw maps to go the places you unlocked
---
Sail to places and kill / skill / run around idk for valuable drops  / EXP / Fun / BiS items / the monsters / skilling / activities
---
Repeat for $$$ or EXP or Fun
---
TL;DR 
---
Slayer gives you better, structured (tasks), and more diverse ways to train combat and make more money
---
Sailing give you better, and more diverse ways to train combat, skill, and make more money

Contrary to what you and the autism on this sub believe 20% of someone's yearly hours while awake spent on a single game is in fact a lot of time. Just because there are a few brainlets that play 12 hours a day doesn't mean that is the standard for the vast majority of players. Get your head out of your ass.
---
Sure, but can we at least get a new method for imbuing?

The first guys point was entirely about mtx and I still think you‚Äôre wrong but I can‚Äôt be bothered to type up so much to tell you why I think so have a good night friend.

No doubt

Those damn morals and that pesky valuing customer input. Shame really
---
Everybody vote against this guy
---
Which can still happen either way being shown or not shown, regardless of 3rd party clients recording it lol
---
as u/Verdiss said, it's a new skill Jagex is adding, to create magic equipment among other things, a big one being deconstructing items to their basic forms.
---
I'd be fine if they removed the following:
---
* The summoning mechanics.
---
* The combat based wards.
---
* The skilling imbues.
---
That‚Äôs the problem I have too. I understand nostalgia - hell it is basically half the reason I play osrs. Keeping oldschool runescape as vanilla as possible is awesome. But the people that are literally saying no to new content just in general for close to no reason at all is pretty problematic and sad.

Who gives a fuck?
---
I completely agree.  They're trying to fill a gap that doesn't exist and no one asked for.  I feel like a huge percentage of the OSRS playerbase has never wanted to make mage armor.  The process seems very convoluted and for not that great of a reward.  It will be especially tedious if the new armor they introduce is Warding-only and not dropped by monsters.  
---
We don't need a new skill (except Sailing please god)
---
A guy named Chymestry teaches raids. Look him up on YouTube. His videos crack me up too.
---
as a uim going for an untrimmed herblore cape
---
Honestly fuck herblore
---
How about voting No because it's stupid, unnecessary, and makes absolutely no sense when we already have the crafting and magic skills?
---
Does it feel good trying to berate people
---
Care enough to mess with you, more like. Lol
---
This better not awaken anything in me
---
I started my first runescape account in 2002 or 2003 when I was in the second grade am I a veteran??
---
slayer good everything else bad
---
I mean there's going to be plenty of people with no friends that make 4 accounts, pay for 4 memberships, and multibox all the accounts at the same time. 
---
I support both uses of group ironman regardless.
---
\*cough\* just add the warding skill to Runecrafting \*cough\*

ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä JAGEX ARE POWERLESS TO CRABS ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Just get 69 warding you twit
---
It's impossible because of the community.
---
*"We want a new skill but we don't want the game to change in any way"*
---
These statements are mutually exclusive, you can't have new content that big without expecting the game to change a little. Also, people are adamant against things that make the game easier, except when it's done via 3rd Party clients or in small, subtle changes via *"QoL"* updates.
---
Reminds me of [Life of Brian](https://youtu.be/QereR0CViMY)
---
&gt;You have to think for yourself, you're all individuals!
---
&gt; We're all individuals!
---
Like i said in a previous post, DG was an awesome skill but people are delusional enough to pretend raids are a suitable replacement. Its also too inclusive and fun to ever make it in...
---
I just did an unofficial group with my friends. If it's a matter of trust that someone won't trade or use the GE, find people that actually want to play the mode.
---
Not what I'm saying. The are already skills in the game that could easily handle everything they have presented previously. None of that has changed, but now there's a bunch of new, unrelated, shit thrown in.
---
I mean, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable conclusion to me. :/ not being sarcastic in case I sound like I am.
---
You are actually 2 squares ahead when walking from where you're character is at if that makes it easier to understand
---
These could be like the base blue Wizard robes (i) or (e) or whatever.
---
I still have no idea why people voted no to having unopened clues themselves stackable.
---
&gt; but there's far too much involved with Warding for it to be in the game.
---
OSRS isn't even remotely the same game it was when it released, it is not RS2, it is RS2.5. Look at all the new shit that's been added to the game and tell me Warding is any worse for the game's integrity than what's already been done. How is Zeah not worse? How is Prifddinas not worse? All those bosses? Items? Raids? There's so fucking much that is worse than Warding, but just because **iT's A nEw SkIlL***(that's filling an actual gap in the game's design)*, suddenly people give a shit and don't want it? Be fucking consistent.
---
Sure. Make the current boss reward scaled as ultracompost. Then rewards decreases with lower tier.
---
The rewards are fine imo.
---
Okay, following that, combine strength and attack, magic and rc, crafting and fletching, smithing and mining, firemaking and woodcutting, and hunter and slayer.
---
Chuck sum stabberz at da ting
---
You don't need to follow their opinions ad verbatum lol. Listen to them, as many as you can and form your own informed opinion. I have a 2k total ironman so id say im fairly experienced with the game but im still gonna listen to people like alkan, sick nerd, boaty etc. before i form a complete opinion myself as they know way way way more than myself about the game.
---
I hope all you do aswell. The one negative of democracy is uninformed voters.
---
I'm all for an item sink. Skill or otherwise.
---
fuck yeah slayer is dope
---

My personal problem with bonds is adds a means to buy gold from Jagex. Back in the mid 2000s it would have been unthinkable that you can literally just spend money to get ahead Runescape. That was the sort of MMO people made jokes about- the Korean games where the top players were those willing to spend $10,000 on special potions and equipment. If you bought it from a 3rd party source you were *cheating*- the idea was that buying gold was like botting, it gave you an unfair advantage. 
---
Then Jagex flipped the narrative. The problem with RWT wasn't that people were buying advantages in game with real life money, it was that Jagex wasn't getting there proper cut. None of the players actually gave a shit (probably still don't) if the money goes to Jagex or Venezuela, but that's what Jagex decided to make it about. This way they could justify edging the game towards the pay to win model (which we see progressed quite far in RS3) without seeming hypocritical about previously banning RWT. 
---
At anyrate, what I have to disagree with is this:
---
&gt;they are a clever solution to RWT 
---
Bonds aren't a solution to RWT, they actively promote it. Just no longer with 3rd parties, but with Jagex instead. The problem with RWT from a classical perspective is that it unfairly favors players who have more money and can spend it on the game. This does not actually address that problem, it just legitimizes it.
---
I didn't say Slayer was good either. Slayer is the best skill at masking the fact that it's just as shallow as everything else.
---
Like 99% of Slayer is just as easy as the rest of the game.
---
Gpu mode and stretched mode makes it wayyy better.
---
All points are valid. Especially in regard to it being a counterpart to smiting and crafting.
---
Found the Warding Fanboy.
---
&gt; sounds like it will be dominated by clans like dmm
---
4 people no lifing group ironman would have no impact on 4 people that play only on weekends. 
---
You'd be just as likely getting crashed at GWD by a standard team as a group ironman team.
---
inb4 the entry requirements for skill level worlds gets bumped up.
---
Since restarting OSRS around this time last year, I feel like I made decent progress in the game and spent hours upon hours building my bank like everyone else. Unfortunately, I've been hit hard after each and every update that came with a bug. I'm fine if my bank loses value if it's due to an update since that's the nature of the game and merching but I'm not fine with my bank literally losing 50% of value due to something poorly implemented. I quit after the kebos update when the slayer drops were screwed. It's so demoralizing.
---
Lol sorry but you're really going with the 'I have no interest in this skill' argument? 
---
I have no interest in training Farming but I still need to do it to get the spirit tree in my POH (even though teleporting is not related to Farming). I hate training Agility but I still need it for a ton of shit in the game.
---
It's literally what the game is built around. Sometimes you have to grind a more boring aspect to unlock content that you enjoy.
---
Me agree.
---
Nice
---
Reminds me of Korg.
---
"Piss off ghost!"
---
Who cares Jesus. God forbid we get any updates because one guy makes a profit. 
---
Meanwhile people are staking bils at duel arena.
---
Scripts and bots are the exact same thing
---
Are you too stupid to understand that growing is needed in order to keep a game alive?
---
I fail to see how a new skill is RS3 content. It‚Äôs new. It‚Äôs not perfect, I concede, but I think it‚Äôs cool and engaging. I don‚Äôt see how adding something ‚Äúnew‚Äù will ruin the game for you, or anyone for that matter.
---
Just missed 85-90m lance spike smh wanna jump off a cliff missed ez profit lol
---
Sheep
---
sash wringing, trash thinging, mash flinging
---
Putting Charter Crew Members out of business haha
---
Considering crafting and fletching skills aren‚Äôt separate (they should be they‚Äôre the same damn thing) i can see the point but i also personally think its so damn stupid to have them split up so i cannot advocate for Warding.
---
Just because you think people who play the game for a living probably have a better idea of what's good for the game doesn't make you a sheep
---
Supply and demand homie
---
These combinations should've been done when they were first released. It's too late to do this now. 
---
I wouldn't combine Smithing and Mining though. Hunter and Slayer sounds interesting actually...
---
Are you too "mad bro" to realize this is posted in humor?  I can give a shit less if it makes it in game or not
---
Shit, now I need a skull sceptre
---
Mining is pretty different because it's isn't a time based node. But yeah, you're not entirely wrong.
---
I'd argue that it needs a combat aspect to pass, otherwise the argument would be "what's the point?". If it was an insular skill like woodcutting or firemaking, it would never pass a poll because there would be no real benefit to training it. I think that the current design adresses those issues, but I still think that actually training the skill is going to be the biggest problem. There's a reason smithing in Rs3 had a massive overhaul, it's because constantly making items over and over does not feel fun, and it means that the items being made will basically never have value.
---
All the useful ones are also bound to stupid diary reqs, which makes no sense.  I don't understand what the point of having agility is, if they're required to complete the diaries anyway. The wilderness ones are fine, but not for ones outside of the wildy. They'd rather just remove the level requirement and let you use it after you complete the respective diary.
---
It feels like the focus is more on how this is going to "benefit" the game than the actual amount of sense that the idea makes.
---
Shut the fuck up, people are allowed to have opinions
---
Let's all vote yes. But then say we voted  no so jagex looks like they rigged it
---
I wouldn't do any of it, the argument is just stupid
---
I'm all for that color palette, but they need to change the logo so it's not an infinity symbol in a POH portal. The symbol is fine, but the portal frame is ugly
---
Hiding poll results doesn't mean that the polls that were lost was because they weren't hidden. 
---
And sailing sucks, don't bother changing my mind.
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä00.11$ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
not an argument
---
All of this sounds awesome, though I would vastly prefer the necromancy over battle auras. Overall, really fun looking skill that ties in nicely to the game.
---
I locked my phone before she could clearly see the picture
---
Ill take that as a no
---
What breed is that monkey?
---
All I got from that was that we are once again going to see splitbark wearing pkers. Boosted damage while standing close to enemies? Get ready for someone to mage you right before AGS or gmaul spec. Too cool.  
---
Wondering if the materials for bloodbark, soul ark will be in morytania. Maybe Swampletics is going to have a new set of armor to work towards.
---
Mate this is gaming in general.
---
How much did you win
---
All they are doing is adding a skill for the sake of adding a skill.
---
This is the main thing annoying me about them comparing warding to smithing. No one is getting 99 smithing to make themselves full rune
---
I'm missing a way to do RC without killing myself. Mod Ash?
---
yes seems like a ploy that they brought this out not long after finally hiding poll results
---
Rebirth skills
---
Returning player here. Why is it that AGS is so cheap compared to SGS in osrs? Last I played it was even more expensive than claws. Did the stats get changed or something? 
---
Also, I feel like a see a lot more low level players with things like fire cape and super expensive items. Did the the game generally become easier or are the players just more knowledgeable now?
---
Jad as a slayer task, do I lose the task if I fail? Multiple attempts?
---
This is the 3rd day I‚Äôve been doing this consistently at barb assault. I know I‚Äôm not en close but damn I can‚Äôt wait to be done
---
No spades tho
---
Yeah I'm just going to wait for some breakdowns. Already saw a pretty good one.
---
This exists already. Had someone chase me through the wildy course with a gmaul. Was actually pretty fun and didn‚Äôt really mind when he got me eventually
---
Ahh okay mb
---
but if you have played runescape for a long time you will also know that jagex has a thing about going ahead with terrible decisions
---
His ass
---
Actually i can. Id rather so just about anything than combat in rs
---
I've played since 01 and hardly consider myself a veteran.
---
No one talks about Piscarilious theiving but it's more xp than pyramid plunder and the least click intensive method by far. Needs the favour and a quick set up on the guards but its easy just check out Woox's video.
---
I think he actually posted on here showing that he got 20 bonds for 20 bots to say this
---
well u dont really need money on f2p ironman because of ogresses
---
Shit good point
---
How did you do this? Trade it and run away and repeat?
---
they just dont wanna UIM grind any other skill.
---
What level construction gets you all the best items? People say 83 with boosts, but how about no boosts
---
Has anyone made a list or chart of all monsters where a twizzler bow is usable at? I'm not talking about it being "useless" because it's not BIS, but where I can maybe use it on slayer tasks as well while playing my Iron.
---
Being able to ward infinity ruins the point of mage training Arena as well. Items will fall in price, then they should nerf the stats because item is so easily obtainable.
---
Dust devils drain your stats
---
It's because it's called "coins" and not "gold coins"
---
This hurts me because i start this grind soon
---
That's an exquisite brainlet.
---
Fucking true
---
Could the speed of adding items and removing compost from the big compost bin in the farming guild be increased?
---
Currently it is quite slow and if you filling from the bank already involves a run across the guild.
---
Bought mine for like 173m and sold for 128. Feels bad. I did make like 220m profit from vork. But more like 175m after the losses on the bow.
---
I remember how with the initial introduction everyone found the proposed content "too lackluster" and "not worthy of being its own skill". So they make it a very in-depth skill with overlap into other skills and now it's too much.
---
I swear no matter how little or how much they introduce, there will always be groups of people saying it's either too little or too much content.
---
My experience with divination was getting to lvl 35 in an hour, getting bored, and quitting runescape.
---
those graphics look too futuristic for osrs
---
How to repost.
---
But you realise 1) you're the minority 2) this skill is no more boring than the other non combats.
---
Jamflex goofed the execution a bit on this but the immediate response on this sub is literally just pick a side and pump out memes. It's disgusting knowing how much content we'll never see cos kids wanna crab.
---
Even though I've enjoyed the game Ive felt like a way to craft magic gear has been missing since I first picked up the game....
---
Why do inbreds post shit like this
---
Exactly right. At the end of the day, it's still a game. We're all human. We get bored. It makes no sense from a business standpoint to not keep it fresh, especially when it's subscription based. 
---
Imo as long as the updates keep to the spirit of Oldschool there's nothing wrong with more content.
---
Please submit links using the [link submission form](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/submit).
---
I was on the fence about warding but now I am confident, that I think warding is fucking garbage
---
Give rs3 the new skills, leave old school alone
---
No. You are not the only one.
---
Yes, one attempt.
---
Your life is a yikes.
---
Everyone other than pvmers is a minority. Does that mean only pvmers matter? No. 
---
I never said this was good. Just pointing out your statement is wrong.
---
I completely agree. I'd love to see all the discussion posts somehow transition over to the RSOF or something, and also get dev input there. I feel like you would be able to get a much more clear voice and have actual discussions with community members/devs instead of "runecraft bad, look at funny swamp man"
---
I think that's what they mean by bloat, too much stuff leads to dead/pointless content.
---
Though I don't mind bloat, it gives players more options and a variety of things to do.
---
CF as in cystic fibrosis? Terribly sorry to hear that as well as gives me goosebumps because i myself am diagnosed with CF myself and im 21.. Much love for bloody and feels at the same time. Sounds like he was a awesome lad/husband/son! Sorry for poor grammar etc.
---
There are a lot of good idea in warding but overall poor execution. I'd like them to step back to the drawing board on it, but I understand how hard that can be in practice.

this was actually a thing and it was called Artisan
---
w428 is west coast, las vegas or something i think  
---
also my best ping time
---
This make me wonder if they haven't knowingly throw battlewards in to lessen the criticism over the rest of the skill as people will be to busy reaping this part of warding  in pieces.
---
Honestly though, I wish the processes to make armours and weapons were long and complex. I like the idea of making a few good things vs like 50000 of the same exact item. Feels a bit more impressive. And as for the simplicity and afk stuff, you just do it in chunks, like get a lot of material, then make a lot of items.
---
Truth is... game was rigged from the start.
---
But even things that are the absent of change, people somehow find a way to get mad about it. But when change is proposed, it is shunned. It's just frustrating I suppose. I just want a place where actual discussion can be had about updates instead of all this bandwagoning (don't know if that's a word, but you get the point).

Can the keyboard on mobile be not so easy to accidentally open? Such as tap username to open rather than the whole bottom of the chat box.

Can long press on mobile please be looked at how it could be made easier? Such as double tap maybe.

Probably a noob, or someone didn't heal enough beforehand.

Thank you for spelling ‚Äúgild‚Äù correctly. The number of times I‚Äôve seen comments like yours with ‚Äúguild‚Äù instead is waaay too damn high.

Gl man, I‚Äôm praying for the pet before 99 atleast
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck that's sext
---
Could do with a slight buff xp drop wise..
---
Currently you only get xp per kill, I think you should aslo get xp per hit, similar to how hp works, as well as the kill bonus. The per hit drops don't even have to be substantial, just enough to speed up the process a tad.
---
This looks kinda like a purple drape on top of the mining cape almost.

The worst part is these robes replace the two main uses for ancestral

Can the Stray Dog get his own quest? He Deserves it, and I think we should be able to have pet dogs

I find skilling much more enjoyable than combats tbh, and mining is my favorite.

I am playing it rn actually lol

Slayer 2 will just be slayer with a green pixel
---
Oh, I thought it was meant to be faster. Well the banking time for vorki is actually pretty quick compared to sire, hyrda, and cerb when you don't have keymasters. In fact I'm pretty sure vorki is one of the fastest banking times with fremmy elite boots. Yeah I'm just gunna sell it back.
---
I get 11 on 361.
---
yes jagex would do this but they make it obvious too
---
I agree with you. I would love to see what would happen within 6 months if we just gave complete control over to the devs or something. It just seems like all we do with the polls are find new ways to walk into a brick wall.
---
Add it to invention then add invention.
---
What does imbue do?
---
He could go full completionist. Getting pets, getting all minigame and miniquest rewards, etc.
---
the golem thinks thammaron is still alive because he's rolling in his grave

It‚Äôs literally crafting/smithing with a different name.
---
It should only be one place.
---
it‚Äôs worlds apart
---
Dungeonslayering?
---
What you have to realize is osrs is like restoring a old archelogical site that has half of it modern and livable. It's always going to be a give and take. 
---
While rs3 is like that priest that yolo'd and "restored" the jesus frescoe himself. Because nobody needs to listen to people who actually do this hurr durr.
---
Yea didn't say their opinion is absolute. But on the flip-side yea PvPers should be saying what's good for PvP, and PvMers for PvM
---
I guess I never thought about that. I just thought of the whole maxed everything being enough lol
---
200IQ
---
I think this idea has merit.
---
TBH I would be fine with the robes if they took the RS3 route and made it so that you "infused" the other high tier gear with upgrades to make "higher" tiered gear. Once you get to a certain point craft able armors need to always be weaker than armor that is dropped from pvm. You can loop back to it to "enhance" that armor with your skill as an artisan, but you should never be able to reach end game armor by just crafting it.
---
*reeeeeeeee*
---
After reading up on it this skill still seems pointless and more stupid than runecrafting. Duck that shit
---
&gt; Just a simple comment like 'I think the method for creating magic armor is too complicated compared to the existing methods of creating range/melee armor' would be great and get the point across
---
You have to understand that OPs comment was posted in a 4chan thread. Your summary of his comment is what his comment says but in a less humorous way and wouldn't have gotten as many (you)'s, aka replies. The OP was trying to make a point.
---
Also, I think that in a gaming community the devs have to be able to have some thick enough skin to read both positive and negative comments and understand what the comment is really saying. People aren't nice online and expecting clear constructive criticism from a 4chan reply is a bit of a high request.
---
oh okay, i guess i haven‚Äôt seen many of them that were in jest. if hackers was the bit i was gonna say lol that‚Äôs baseless
---
The healers should stop attack when Jas does. I guarantee you guys would all be bitching too if this happened to you.
---
Not really, even if you were constantly updating the polls, you probably have 10+ votes being cast in between you checking them. Jagex could easily double count some ‚Äúfor‚Äù votes and not count some ‚Äúagainst‚Äù votes. Even if we were to be suspicious, and do a reddit poll that isn‚Äôt riggable, you could still argue that reddit doesn‚Äôt represent the main player base or whatever.
---
Ty for the sperg post.
---
Because it looks ugly as fuck and clutters the interface
---
C A N C E R
---
Remember how confusing farming was on release day, or how much fun getting 40 hunter in a week after it was out and bragging that you could hunt with a damn falcon on your wrist. Best times of my actual old school gameplay was new skills.
---
I have hasta and archers ring. but never see anyone have it in their invent from what I've looked at for gear set ups
---
Or do what I did, and start it right away, then not actively seek out any bones.  It's been 2 months, and I have 12 of the bones from chance encounters.
---
This changes everything.
---
Makes it so the staff doesn't break when you use all charges. If it's imbued, you can refill it with any spare staff parts (like the skull half minotaurs drop). If it's not imbued, it will just break when you've used it 5 times, and I don't think it can be recharged.
---
But imbuing is easy and free, just talk to the guy next to the final Stronghold chest, and he'll imbue it as long as you have authenticator enabled.
---
Shit I started my Ironman wrong, time to start over
---
True.
---
Nice spec bar
---
What happens to people who have imbued sufferings with recoil charges? For players like UIM or Inactives that have thousands of recoils banked in their suffering, if they aren't actively playing the game when/if warding is implemented, or aren't able to get the resources to grind warding out before the nmz "Grace" period is gone, do we get penalized by losing all of our banked recoil charges?
---
They've been scratching the DG itch since CoX
---
yes! definitely
---
Conveniently my ultra powerful wizard happens to be one hell of a runecrafter
---
I don't use mobile much so I don't know how much data is used playing this game but I think it's worth it. Ton of stuff for you to work for in members. Doesn't seem like there's much you can accomplish in F2P at this point.
---
thanks
---
Oh yeah HCIM Alfie yourself and then start a new account
---
Yes, though if you missed it, its a lost cause explaining it to you
---
&gt;Extrem
---
I mean, I think hunter and construction are pretty trash skill tbh. I only trained them for quests, achievement diaries, and total levels. Definitely not something I really enjoy doing, I'd say even firemaking is more fun.
---
already paid for a month mems tho QQ
---
You probably didn‚Äôt want the GE either
---
It's really creepy trying to mine with a bunch of zombies just standing around me.
---
That‚Äôs how it was starting to feel, I‚Äôve done all the f2p questing. I don‚Äôt imagine there are any f2p bosses or anything of the sort? I don‚Äôt do PvP.
---
in the same solar system though
---
&gt; Players can further imbue the sceptre by showing Solztun, who is at the bottom of the Stronghold, their reward from the Cradle of Life while having the sceptre in their inventory and RuneScape Authenticator enabled, which prevents the item from being destroyed when all of its charges are used up and allows it to be recharged with sceptre pieces.

I really really dislike this pretend non-partisan crap "regardless of your position on this binary matter, I'm going to push you in the direction I support anyway, but do it sneakily instead of forthright."
---
Spoken like someone who's never played another MMO.
---
Seriously, of all the things to criticize, OSRS and even RS3 have objectively the most distinct and interesting quests of all the major MMOs by a fucking mile
---
I'm wondering, hypothetically, how long OSRS would last with no true updates and only server maintenance / QOL / bugfixes
---
Just because its new, doesnt mean its bad fellas..
---
FTFY second referendum
---
Hey, thank you!
---
nice
---
Yea, now that I think about it, crafting armour using the runic altars would be a really cool way to work it into Runecrafting. Maybe you imbue fabrics with the power of the altar and higher Runecrafting lets you bind higher level runes into robes etc.
---
Crafting basic mage robes can be done at any altar, but crafting rune specific robes like fire or death will give some special effect when wearing the full set, sounds awesome.
---
ye i dont like the way its changing stats of alot of things either its just like the beginning process of something bad i feel
---
Yeah of course you dont feel like anything is missing, but what if we didnt have slayer helms?  Or defenders? Or all of zeah?
---
You dont feel like its missing because youve never experienced it.  If zeah vanished tomorrow you would lose your shit that a core part of the game is gone.  Maybe give it a chance before you shit on it.
---
Also, mage armour is trash and has to be bought or slayered for, dont pretend thats not a problem and youve never thought "i wish i had more mage options" before.
---
Most of the time comes from cleaning and bones in inconvenient, unlikely to naturally go to locations, so that wont even help very much
---
Oh yeah my bad, forgot everyone has 1.5b+ laying around in their bank. Forgot everyone had a 1.7b + upkeep cost sythe they‚Äôre using at Bandos.
---
That‚Äôs fair - it‚Äôs a bit of a high request.
---
I hated farming so much on release, my angsty teen brain suffered with all the waiting for the plants to grow (Yet I'm pretty sure I was playing Ogame at that time too lol)
---
People hate it because they were forced to train it to access BiS content. During the grind to the first chaotic not many people really have a clue what is going on.
---
I too thought the skill was an absolute ballache until probably my second or third chaotic. Then once I got the hang of it, dungeoneering was the most enjoyable team gaming experience I‚Äôve ever had. I loved how high levels of team-work and communication were rewarded in a way that‚Äôs hard to find in a lot of games. It had an incredibly high skill ceiling and was very competitive in certain communities which meant for me it never felt like a grind to 200m xp. It was pure fun.
---
I agree with you, high level alone doesn't mean a lot of game knowledge, it just means you've spent a lot of time in game.
---
However I'd say that *usually*, the more time spent in game, the more you know about the game and what would be good or bad for it.
---
I think an issue is most of the jmods don't actually spend that much time playing the game. I don't blame them, it is probably not that fun for them to spend all day working on the game and then playing it in their free time, but I think they need to take on some high level community member's advice when deciding new content to add.
---
I am with you on the core point of this post, it's hard as hell to make good content with this game. You can't make new skilling methods be faster xp/hr than existing skilling methods, you can't make new best in slot gear every few months, you can't add bosses that have better drop tables than existing bosses, you can't buff anything to do with pvp or make anything in the game easier. I honestly can't think of very many possible updates that would be good for the game, I think they need to slow down a ton and maybe do one big update a year.
---
For example, I loved the kebos+ kourend update, farming guild and all that. I also really liked fossil island as a whole.
---
If they add one region like that once a year, really spend their time on it and not rush out updates, that's my idea of ideal content. 
---
My dream OSRS would be to finish fixing all the kourend houses, fill in all the black unfinished areas of the map (with quests and all that jazz), and then basically stop updating for a long time, just quality of life and bugfixes I guess. I really don't want them to add in any new best in slot gear anymore.

In my opinion dungeoneering is emblematic of what‚Äôs wrong with RS3 ‚Äî the ‚Äúwowification‚Äù If you will.
---
I don‚Äôt even play this game anymore but f u the original is good
---
The problem with doing what you suggested is the whole mess it would cause when the community ended up actually voting it through and Jagex had to step in and say "we're not doing this."  Can you imagine lol
---
Mobile uses surprisingly little data if it's just regular playing. Like less than 100mb even after extensive playing for days. Unless you download updates.

Works good for me. I do have an issue with yanillian hops though. Every run one sometimes two patches die. 92 farm with ultracomp btw

The real oldschool ended 5 years ago.

I don‚Äôt think warding is a good skill, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there should never be new skills.

Did you guys see that ludicrous display last night?

What did I miss

The science of breeding for and caring for farm animals
---
I loved Dungeoneering, Summoning, curse prayers, etc. Will we ever see that happen here? Probably not. People are so hiveminded that it makes discussions pointless, no one getting anywhere. I think Jagex just needs to ignore the community sometimes and just push out updates they want to see, not what one popular person on twitter doesn't want, so his followers follow the bandwagon.
---
I used to think that opinions were subjective but I think yours is just factually wrong.
---
No
---
Well then they can add a 2300 or 2350 world or a world you can only access if you got 200m mining while it was respectable. This is not a hard problem to solve.
---
Holy effin lava runners in here.
---
Sailing is a better skill than warding change my mind
---
I want my first 99 to be fishing since it‚Äôs my favorite skill, and I planned to catch monkfish and earn profits. However, it seems like the swag song quest is difficult, if I already satisfied all stated skill and quest requirement, do I need to have all 70 melee skills and 70 ranged skills and get the best armor to defeat the queen??
---
It devalues Ancestral, if the armor is good enough and not tradeable then high warding would be required for meta bossing, if the skill doesn't have great rates getting a ring imbue would take significantly longer than what it currently does, do we want pseudo-invention, do we want pseudo-summoning, etc.  
---
A majority of people not liking warding is that it doesn't have any focus in goal, it wants to be an item sink, introduce new BiS, nerf NMZ, disrupt the bossing meta, add summoning, and do what it was meant to do, allow for robes to be made. Look at smithing, you make armor and weapons. Crafting is a bit bloated, but it isn't nearly as bad as Warding seems.
---
THE MAGIC CONCH HAS SPOKEN

I feel sorry for jagex that the playerbase is so garbage.

Don't hide poll results? Hide poll results? Doesn't matter, you're going to get shit on either way. Can't win with this community.

Do you think any oldschool player wants a skill with more letters than they can remember from the alphabet?
---
Did you make this? I'm having trouble making sense of the first formula. Do you have any graphs or code/pseudocode implementations of this?

I feel warding should be crafting based maybe even more to do with rune crafting like fletching to woodcutting why make new rocks appear when there is huge essence mines dead content revamp that use the runes crafting system for leveling elements,nature, law, soul, blood, wrath
---
Maybe Imbue staffs, wand, IBAN,
---
Maybe have ward shield good at absorbing magic

Making friends with my arm was my favorite quest tbh
---
The rewards from it are also incredible.
---
How does this not have more upvotes?
---
At least firemaking has a clear purpose, make fires and provide an item sink for WC. Warding is just a "fix the game" skill.
---
Dude, we got slayer without black mask for a year. Then we only got a streak, slayer points and perks like 3 years later. It was definitely not great on release, lol
---
Maybe that's what you feel or what you project onto others, maybe it's true for comments but at least for posts, it clearly isn't true, otherwise well-formed opinions that go against the sub circlejerk would never make it to the front page.
---
I liked the new skill with the exception of the summoning and tile effects.
---
Been here since 05 ish and still think Warding needs some work as it reeks of things from RS3
---
The concept is good, it just needs some more polishing and scrap the powercreep nonsense.
---
Honestly konar kinda killed skilling imho. Between the key drops and the mat value tank due to the key drops there's not much point doing the gathering skills anymore.

It absolutely does, you just can' fix the favour or top up the cash or collect the returns

Death penalty being erased changed the game for me, and not for the better methinks. Being limited to 3 items + 1 really makes you pick and choose, and value your items. Hell, its why I like the wilderness sometimes. Running around with actual risk when you die adds a whole other element. I dislike how the game has changed, and I know most disagree with me, but I think that blowpipe-tbow-scythe and boss farming for constant drops has slightly dulled the experience.
---
So you‚Äôd be fine with damaging the integrity of the game just because it makes your life a little easier? That‚Äôs a pretty selfish attitude to have my dude.
---
I wasn‚Äôt really being serious. Thanks for doing the math though
---
I'm down for this. But why not both
---
Texas forever.
---
But raids 2 is an inferior version of raids 1. It's literally a boss gauntlet.
---
All I know is that if warding passes, I'm going to RWT my gold and account.
---
What do you mean by item sink?
---
Not trying to be rude but Summoning and Dungeoneering are two of the skills the OSRS community at large specifically voted against. I doubt either of them stand much a chance of making it. Plus raids are pretty much to replace dungeoneering.

terrible lmao, about 30k an hour for fishing/hunting if you're under 68 hunter
---
Lol he most likely hasn't been playing much longer than anyone here. Now how hard he plays is another matter.
---
at the end of the day, most people just want slayer/boss updates. outside of those two things anything new is either dead content or OP and re balancing anything devalues their lifes work.
---
no new skill will EVER pass a poll sadly, because people want to "preserve" 2007scape unless it involves more things like running around kourend with their blowpipe out or farming vork/snek/raids all day every day.
---
Those are my 2 most hated skills so yeah ima pass.
---
Or line them all up and shoot them all at the same time. *Pew....Pew...Pew*
---
I honestly enjoy the game and I‚Äôm fine with both. But I feel like summoning got the harsh end. It was def close enough to that time to be in osrs
---
Low-key got banned for botting
---
The last one wasn't a community thing; it is still using temporary unpolled mechanics that had no community influence. The middle one is also not directly a community thing since we often don't know what will be on the drop tables and tend to oppose them being full of resource drops when it happens.
---
Yup. I agree. The parts of Warding can be added into existing skills and would fit nicely there.
---
I think youve missed the point, without updates and new content the game would have already failed, the game almost died in under a year after its revival because there was so little content, a new skill opens the doors to unlimited potential for new content, and if you even bothered to read the blog postnyoud see they want to breath new life into borderline useless skills like hunter and farming in addition to adding a new skill.
---
You /s but you‚Äôre right
---
I‚Äôm weak üòÇüòÇ

Why would we bother critiquing it if it will never appear in game? Should we critique sailing too?

One of the coolest parts of the game is when low level accounts like skillers and def pures find unique ways to kill quest bosses

Pretty sure we'd be able to vote on the features individually, so that's not a problem
---
Id say general instability but its possible people are Ree'ing over warding
---
Which direction is the 'wrong direction' that everyone seems to assume we're heading in? The current meta, at least for PVM, is whip for slayer and blowpipe for pretty much everything else. That's not one that I'm particularly keen on preserving. Warding makes magic viable in certain situations, and adds some pretty interesting mechanics with battle wards. As far as pvp goes, I would imagine that having the same meta for years gets boring.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more with your first sentence. In fact, you put it perfectly.
---
Magical accuracy? Magical defense? Both largely based on the magic level. I guess new PvM encounters have to be designed completely outside the bounds of the game's existing combat mechanics because tbow exists but this is fine.
---
Remove construction, add it to crafting
---
Dungeoneering and that clay game that gave double xp items for use that degraded
---
I mean, every single account build trains slayer somewhat differently
---
Yeah wtf? I thought some things were not passing because... they're not according to the site.
---
Recoils are independent of imbues. You can have a Ring of Suffering (r) that isn't imbued (ri).
---
Though, I really hope the update doesn't pass.
---
Its almost as if the community is made up of literally millions of individuals and is bound to have people with differing and conflicting opinions about every facet of the game due to its size
---
More like do slayer or kill bosses for everything
---
your opinion is wrong and I'm letting you know D:&lt;

Right and now that game is currently rs3. And we see how that turned out

Least you only had 5m total xp. Better to go out early and learn from your mistakes than make it far and die to something you have no control over.
---
Not saying that the Jmods are necessarily doing this in this case, but it's definitely a lot easier to say "We can't" than it is to say "We don't want to" and then having people demanding an explanation why then being dissatisfied with the explanation because in reality they don't care about why, they just care that you're not doing what they want and just want ammunition to throw at you to try to get you to do what they want.
---
First decent slayer monster is 65 for dust devils, then kurask at 70, skeletal wyvern at 72, gargoyle at 75, brutal black dragons at 77, nechs at 80, abby demons 85, kraken 87. 40 is super early, I don't know if you understand what you've gotten yourself into just yet.
---
Get this man to the top.
---
New content is really fun and good for the game when done correctly, but we need to improve what we already have first.
---
Which shows why hiding the poll results was important. Many people who didn't actually care/know were just following the majority before.
---
It spawns a tbow

1. So what if new quests require Warding? Getting 50 mining for Heroes isnt exactly thrilling but people do it
---
2. How would any of the diaries require Warding? You can currently complete all of them without it. I doubt they'll add tasks and "uncomplete" everyone's diaries. 
---
3. Has the new BIS gear been confirmed to be untradeable? It's also subject to balancing changes and may not actually be BIS on release.

people don't know what they want

New skill what actually makes sense and has a place in game. Comes with new magic gear, balances to old magic gear. Replaces nightmarezone gear imbue. I think it's nice to have such a well-thought content in-game. Also would force maxed people to grind for their max capes again, which is good.

Hold shift and right click tiles to mark them.

For Christ Sake. LISTEN to your fan base. **L-I-S-T-E-N** !!!!

**IMPROVE THE OLD SKILLS**. Okay?

Dissolve this skill and incorporate into RC. Once done, listen some more. Fix up the very common problems with old skills. Then, and **ONLY** then, develop a new skill. When you poll or have Q&amp;A‚Äôs , don‚Äôt bloody incorporate every recommendation and improvement then tell us ‚ÄúWELL WE LISTENED‚Äù. 
---
Also. That NMZ nerf to imbue rings is a big fuck you to us all. It shows you guys are detached from impact and effort players put into every aspect of oars.
---
Disheartens me to see members of my clan say no to warding simply because they don't want a new skill. Personally, I think warding has design flaws, and that's why I would not vote for it in it's current state; but there are too many people that just don't want to see any meaningful shakeup outside of PvM updates.
---
Then shut the fuck up and go play on a private server. OSRS is no longer the game you want it to be and never will be again. Sorry. Either deal with it or quit.
---
No, she doesnt have a point, the point is fallacious. What is better, someone breaking into your email taking everything including your Runescape account and all assets on that game. Or, someone breaking into your email and taking everything except for your Runescape account.
---
I think the answer is obvious. Infact, many people make an email specifically for Runescape so the only thing of value on the email would be protected.
---
Imagine someone breaking into your house and they take everything but cant get into a room that contains TV, Computer, Tablets, Family photos because the room is secured with a lock, would you then also say its irrelevant that this room wasnt broken into because all other rooms were?
---
Did you even bother to read the dev blog?
---
Warding has nothing to do with invention not even close
---
Mm2 will take you like 2 hours. Easy
---
Quest wont be for another 3 months
---
No doubt.
---
I think if very low stats it can be worth teleing out.
---
For instance, I get 2-3min kills with 80 range. If I miss both specs, it can take longer/risk no getting the kill. Teleing to house and back is sub 1min. This is very anecdotal though, and for most cases it's probably not worth it.
---
I feel like new content is always fun, if it‚Äôs unobtrusive and plays well with older content. I just see more fun things to do.
---
voted no because adding another potential requirement to pk would succ
---
So is your point that a meta change, so long as it's a change, it's good, regardless of the nature and details of that change? The content of the change doesn't matter, so long as it's a change.
---
Otherwise I'm not sure what your point is. People have passed things in the past that changed the meta; the real question is to what extent the meta will change and how. If people like how it's perceived the meta will change, they'll vote for it. If it looks grim, they won't.
---
Overall I really like the direction that warding is going. 
---
I am not sure if I am a fan of battle wards as they would change things too much.
---
I worry about the armors that do more damage if you are closer. How much extra damage? Ancestral already only gives only 2% bonus, and I am not sure sure about having anything from warding outclassing Ancestral other than the unique enemy sets like undead or dragons.
---
I'm fine with it whether skill or minigame. But dung was such a big minigame, that it had to be classified as its own skill - hell, level 99 wasn't even enough to fully expand on all its content

Did anything change about how you operate Miscellania? I've been doing it for years and still use the same method of checking every 3 days, leaving some 750k in the bag and changing the workers around to whatever the spreadsheet says is most profitable at the time of withdrawing. Should I adjust anything or do anything different?

How do you know the quest will take that long? I thought it was supposed to be released in next week's update...?
---
How does this work?
---
&gt; In-game shows everything as passing
---
should answer that for you
---
1) how does it balance old magic gear? 2) i don‚Äôt think people who earned their max capes playing the game completing normal skills would be too enthused to see their max capes unwearable, forcing them to do content that‚Äôs unnecessary.
---
From what I see your issue is that Warding content could be put into currently existing skills. But the thing is, a lot of skills could theoretically be fleshed together. Fletching and smithing could both be incorporated into the crafting skill pretty easily. Yes, it would saturate the crafting skill, but the idea of 'level up your crafting to craft a bow' isn't too farfetched. Fishing and Hunter could be combined pretty easily as well. I don't think that just because a skill could be shoved as an add-on to existing skills, that it shouldn't be considered as its own skill. 
---
People care about 'nostalgia' in oldschool. So for a new skill to be viable, it has to have some overlap with existing content. If we look at the 4 new skills RS3 has implemented, Summoning, Dungeoneering, Divination, and Invention, none of them really tie in super closely with other skills besides bare minimum connections (source: Maxed in RS3). I would argue that if a skill were released in OS with very few connections to existing skills (Sailing), there would be a significant group of people who would say it breaks their nostalgia. But if a skill overlaps with existing content TOO much, people will say that the skill isn't expansive enough to be its own skill and should just be shoved into current skills. So if Jagex were to implement a new skill, they're damned regardless of the path they take unless they strike this perfect middle ground. We can update unloved skills (cries in Agility), but I think the next step for OSRS is adding a new skill.

Twisted bow -93m

You need a higher level woodcutting level to use that axe.
---
You forgot mining rune essence and then crafting the runes you need to enchant with.
---
Totally agree, Bake it in to crafting with a magic requirement, Please! ‚úì
---
Warding as a new crafting skill essentially isn't a bad idea. The problems arise when you introduce the summoning aspects and the new AoE stuff.
---
Legit said that today on the cleaned double up stake
---
might end up being a hover text
---
Things started going down 2 days before the dev blog
---
Dude it's the internet who cares about grammar. The F2P robes change F2P pking which has been an excuse not to introduce fletching as a F2P skill for the longest time, which makes me feel as if these robes are there just so some people vote yes for warding as if it's a good thing, when a month ago this exact thing was used as their reason to say "no" to a lot of shit. The scepter thing I don't care for, it can be added without warding but then again i'll never use it so i'm indifferent.
---
I really hope people develop their own opinions instead of sucking content creator dicks.
---
Osra was created from an Backup of rs07 for the people who want to enjoy the golden time of RuneScape. New Content like Minigames and  Raids is okay, but warding is Game changing. You can play rs3 if you want New Skills and Gameplay mechanics. Even New Engine work, but osrs is more static. Players still come back to enjoy the old RuneScape. It's not that I wouldn't enjoy a new Skill, i don't want to see RuneScape die again because of Bad ideas and mechanic updates. Never change a running system, osrs is based on the nostalgic aspect and they have to deal with it.
---
I‚Äôve done bird houses almost exclusively from 72-90 and I think it‚Äôs great since it‚Äôs basically farm runs plus free herblore xp. 
---
I do chins only when I‚Äôm going to arma because hunter xp and more profit 2 birds with one stone
---
It will never devalue ancestral considering Ancestral is obtained through raids, providing the highest tier gear possible. You‚Äôll never get the absolute BIS through skilling. It‚Äôll be like a way better smithing, 99 smithing lets you craft rune plate bodies for reference.
---
It‚Äôs worrisome how you‚Äôre so ill-informed yet have formulated such an opinion. You are correct with what you say, towards being and item sink, etc. However those are PERKS of the skill and not the main goal of the skill itself. Imbuing rings is a perk you get from the skill. Same way the higher your combat level the higher tier armor you can wear that all give different bonuses.
---
Warding is a skill that stays true to OSRS while providing strong overall health to the game, patching things up, making skills more defined and so other skills aren‚Äôt as cluttered and confusing while providing a lot of opportunities for new content. It‚Äôs great for all level players. The arguments I‚Äôve seen besides your now have never addressed warding on it‚Äôs own.
---
because you're imbuing objects with magic energy
---
This. Your attack level is high enough to equip that quality of weapon. But your woodcutting isn‚Äôt high enough to have the skill to use it for chopping wood.
---
So I can hold the axe but can't use it?
---
Well yea, but really it goes to -1/0. Or ya know, does not exist, which I think is more funny than going to zero

Hopefully whatever money it had should be gone forever though.
---
Did you miss the part where the materials are gathered from hunter and farming? How does that not also train many different skills? I'm assuming you'll also train crafting by making the un-warded robes before warding them. If that's a bloated mess so is crafting diamond bolts (e).
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the only way to do it, you can technically do Vork with a zammy hastae. It just significantly improves vork and the $$ per hour.

Nothing to do with chins. The monsters are attacking at different times so he just puts on a different prayer when each hits

I like some of zeah like the guilds and the new spell book. But really hate the catacombs and the runecrafting and how big it is
---
We played RS3. That's why we quit and went back to OSRS. Are you really that dumb?
---
I will vote yes to anything that lets me avoid nmz.

If you think about it, the RS community is basically like one of those annoying quests where the npc wants you to do something similar to exactly what you're talking about.
---
He isn't going to deiron, he's going to change the UIM to IM if i did read that correctly
---
lyre to neitiznot is going to be pretty nice for people without stuff like craft cape or eternal glory too
---
You raise a valid point, but I don't care about a spirit tree in my house so I'm not going to train farming. I hate training agility so I'm not going to do it. The difference is introducing warding is going to force me to train the skill to keep gear I already have.
---
You make a very good point. Reddit as a forum itself is actually terrible for discussion, especially in regards to getting "unpopular" opinions heard. Anyone who sees your post early on can downvote it and there's no chance that the majority will end up seeing it. It's much easier to post some crab emojis, downvote anyone who you disagree with, and call it a day then to actually discuss and argue.
---
The argument for how it would be a useful skill is that there are 3 combat styles and 2 style-specific skills for producing gear, causing an economic imbalance and inflated prices. 
---
Maybe it should‚Äôve been incorporated into runecrafting - but I think its tough to make a reasonable argument to keep mage-gear production out of the game..
---
Now you explain how its forced and unnecessary please

You seem pretty knowledgeable, how would I as an Ironman get enough gp to run the kingdom? I‚Äôve had Max 150k gp in my bank. How do people get that much money?

if there HAS to be a new skill, im completely fine with it just being a simple production skill like crafting or smithing which is only used to make some magic robes and maybe some other little buts but please dont make it affect the balance of combat in any way. Like most people here I completely disagree with battle wards and conjuring.
---
Wow thanks for the vid wtf is that shit.
---
I guess youd have to bring a massive team to clear the healers right? What assholes
---
Warding would be one of the skills that would help the game so much long term, its unreal. Hard for low iq players to realize that tho.
---
it's almost like this is a community of people that thing differently!? the fuck!?
---
Is this internetcommentetiquette's account?
---
And this 4chan post was posted here, making it essentially something more than the original context it was in
---
He just doesn't want to have to re-max his UIM let's be honest.
---
Thanks. Looks nice!
---
And if it was a picture of mod ash, or mod archie, would you have asked this question?
---
if you kept reading that article another three sentences you would have been able to read about the modern connotations of the word lmao
---
nice selective research dickhead
---
Combine dungeoneering with sailing, instead of delving into the same dungeon over and over you explore new uncharted islands, ez.
---
Yeah man, keep voting down PVP and other useful content updates because some streamer said so. Ride the wagon, boy.
---
https://youtu.be/Dhyc_sOImPs the one in this video, you fire every six ticks so it's inefficient. Walking on the edge and clicking on vorkath every fifth tick before returning to the edge is better but I like how braindead the first method is even if I'm losing one shot per acid phase
---
Ok?
---
I actually added him before just to ask this one question. He deleted me right after asking him :(
---
not the runecrafting?
---
Its almost like different people think different things.
---
I figured I would make a bastard baby of original warding, artisan, sailing, and that new construction minigame I keep hearing talk about.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be faster to have it hold shift and click 28 times instead of right click then left click in a menu
---
It really is just a bad fucking skill but keep coping warding shill
---
W349 UK 2k total world is fine for me so maybe they fixed both?
---
But everyone shits on the idea of updating outdated skills too. Can't have new skills can't polish up old skills all we can have are new slayer bosses.
---
Definitely a bummer, also his new idea for the series doesn't sound as interesting sadly
---
When is the stream about more in depth questions that get asked every week but are left out because they require a long answer
---
Yes i agree!!
---
I did, and general usage =/= definition. I used to word correctly but people incorrectly told me I "don't understand what propaganda is" because I didn't use it exactly how it's usually used. It's not selective research, it's understanding the difference between connotation and denotation.
---
So from what i understood this is just slayer with extra steps
---
Rigged pools started as a joke lmao, brainlets took it for real
---
honestly, yes. range has crafting and fletching. Mele has Smithing. Magic needs something besides runecrafting. at the VERY least, Warding needs to fall under RC
---
Meh i didnt care for dungeoneering but id still vote yes because the community seems to want it.
---
This is great feedback! Thanks for putting the time aside to write it up.
---
Your ideas and thoughts on the armours are really helpful. The intention wasn‚Äôt to step on ancestral too much but it seems the current effects need to be worked on further, which was to be expected. The idea was for them to be a degradeable alternative to ancestral, making it require ancestral is a fair compromise to assure that it doesn‚Äôt devalue it.
---
Your point on battle wards is also great, it does confuse the purpose of the skill a bit. These were just ideas for further tie ins with Warding to gauge interest in the idea but it very much seems they‚Äôre better suited for other content.
---
Thanks again :)
---
I don't play Ironman so I'd only know methods that are considered efficient. It depends on how much you play too because Kingdom costs the same amount per day of upkeep but people who play the game less will make less gp/day.
---
Typically you'd want to train crafting/smithing/fletching and alch the stuff you make. Wintertodt is an okay source of GP earlygame too. I think the most consistent at that point in the game would be Theiving though because Blackjacking is really good gp/hr for Irons at that stage in the game.
---
When you get into lategame/endgame stuff basically becomes the same as normie accounts. Vorkath, Demonics, ToB, etc., drop so many alchables you'll be swimming in cash. One of my friends joined a Revs Clan (I wouldn't know which one sry), and paid them money from a main account to farm Revs for supplies and money on their ironman, IDK if that's viable for you though. During King of the Skill, I'd kill the weaker monsters in Wilderness GWD for Ecumenical Keys to alch, it's okay GP/hr for irons I guess but not really viable for HCIM and risks losing money to PvPers.
---
As a player that had a very unstable net connection I was max cb, running chambers, and learning theatre, but random d/cs were common enough for me to not want to ever bother with gwd.
---
The death mechanics were the only reason I felt inclined to still try to enjoy end game pvm, and putting strict mechanics back in place would've suddenly taken me from being a regular in high end pvm gear to being terrified of the most arbitrary thing like camping bbds. 
---
Which was something I used to regularly do on days where my connection was particularly bad.
---
Don't do stupid shit just before a system update. That's what the timer is for.
---
that didn't help much
---
You say this, but the most popular skill in osrs is slayer. I think people are throwing a hissy fit but as soon as it's implemented, will enjoy that aspect of the skill
---
I want warding only cuz of Lunar armor buff :D I will cast nay vote to warding if they buff lunar armor anyway
---
Well, the game is amazing now, so it's obviously working.
---
thanks for the help
---
No problem! &lt;3
---
yeah.. so many worlds dissapear withour prior notice
---
I completely agree, the argument the other dude made about crafting is so fucking stupid. Just because there are already pointless skills in the game doesn't mean there should be more. It's a terrible argument.
---
It's scheduled maintenance. See the end of last week's update news article.
---
Huh. Well, since ImportantInternetPerson doesn't like it I guess it won't pass.
---
Mining suit from MLM
---
Huge yikes
---
Its called combat.
---
Same. I started playing shortly after RS so it was a while before a new skill, but damn if i wasnt hyped for hunter and summoning.
---
you think 49.5 is half of 99? no wonder you like this brainlet its just a mirror
---
Checks out, in times gone by, adding a shaft to a virgin bride drastically reduced her value
---
I did it with a kitten. Sure it took a little while longer but it wasn‚Äôt that bad. Y‚Äôall just impatient.
---
You're so wrong!
---
You're the Yee to my Haw
---
Even if it fails, they'll do the "re-poll until it passes" strategy.
---
Idk man I feel like they‚Äôre trying really hard on getting warding to pass but I‚Äôd rather get old content updated and fixed, plus the skill does not fit in
---
Really easy to prove that shit is fake on your end. All you do is keep giving racists this safe space to operate and every benefit of the doubt. But 50% of rs is racist anyways so I guess it dosnt really matter.
---
I liked stealing creation and fist of guthix. Probably best to not try and re-create the past and make new minigames, better suited to osrs though.
---
I don't think he passed middle school.
---
Yeah, that's what I was getting at with my second suggestion, that's  only a suggestion to make a concession to Jagex so the skill isn't entirely changed
---
Yeah I'd group agility with rc and hunter.
---
Oh okay! Any idea why it is one house and not "many hice"? ;) thinking of mouse and mice :)
---
I actually love this community. Not everybody is going to agree and it‚Äôs nice to see both sides have good arguments.
---
That‚Äôs why I think voting is so awesome. It‚Äôs what got me playing this game. If the votes upset more than a 1/4 the voters then it‚Äôs a no. It‚Äôs so great I love it.
---
The outrage has been good imo. Remember they were going to add an item that made it upgradable from rangers gloves? How dumb would it be if they actually straight up added that. Or the hydra gloves not having a requirement of ds2.
---
All shit that jagex didn‚Äôt think about before proposing the update. 
---
The discussion for this game is so healthy and fun. Fuck look at wow. Those devs do what they want and ignore the community and that game blows now.
---
Why do you care if you don't play anymore?
---
Believe it first started from targeted ddosing at god wars
---
i screwed this meme up in the 5th caption plz forgive
---
Wait, seriously? Damn now im way more intrigued. I guessed he would at least fuck around with pets or sumtin
---
Right? Lol
---
Not for longevity
---
It wasn't fun, It wasn't a skill it was a mini game.
---
Yeah i prefer it without you
---
Vote yes to every skill just because you said not to, just kidding! I probably wont vote anyways, I rarely do! But I could care less if its added, I think it would benefit more then any thing, but to say itll kill runescape is a longshot!
---
Ah so it doesn‚Äôt, those are down too :(
---
I feel the same way man. I mean shit has worked out well so far, honestly, I'm just so fucking upset that over like fucking *two decades* I manage to get everything above level 80 and then they're going to drop a new skill on me.
---
Like fuck man I just got back and got used to *all this other new shit* whew. I like the idea of all the QoL updates, and listening to the community for fixes and tweaks, but I also like the idea of Jagex actually having creative control again.
---
It **freaks me the fuck out** that this may in some way be a modern version of EoC, but given the history of the game and spirit of the developers/community I don't think this beast will every truly die.
---
it also means you wont be getting into raids without a high warding level which is annoying to everyone involved
---
Im trying to imagine the pulling in part graphically. Either one is fine for me
---
That doesn't excuse how bad warding is.
---
Been out of the loop, what is going on?
---
Keep your head in your ass. Fucking idiot
---
Did you smuggle him in a banana crate?
---
You make a brand new account just to post this, while using the same type of wording and grammar as the other post. Fuck off
---
Thank you!
---
Quote me: if warding passes, OSRS playerbase will halve in 6 months.
---
Ive been playing for years and not DCed once, you guys must be playing on dial up or some shit lmao
---
&gt; If you're wondering why I did it so early, its an account wide time saver to get firecape as early into your account as possible to get the max hits for when you train melee.
---
Just get 99 range first, then get fire cape and *then* train melee ;D
---
&gt;slayer
---
good
---
&gt;for skilling
---
bad
---
You dont even know what the argument is.
---
People will get to the point of usefulness in the skill and then drop it, just like almost every pvp/mer out there.
---
Bugger. 
---
Thanks for the update mate but it made me quite irate.
---
looks gay as fuck. can we have zuhaar back?
---
Yes.
---
I did that but at 61 range. ;)
---
Yea, but useful for who and where? 
---
If we're talking imbues we're talking pve, and most pvmers will get imbues and stop unless they massively buff the size on wards seeing as they're useless at almost every boss I can think of.
---
how long have you been playing runescape? i would call you naive if you trust jagex to do this right.
---
Rwt? It was for gp
---
New skills were always so much fun. I'd definitely not be against a modified version of summoning for example but warding just doesn't seem that interesting to me.
---
Respectful win
---
Ranged guild should give robin hood missions where you fucking post up and rob people tbh lmfao
---
&gt;sn‚Äôt an argument against the skill
---
I'm not arguing against the skill. I'm replying to the guy saying people will keep training past getting their imbues back.
---
Quote me: Nobody gives a shit what you think
---
No, it won't. They players that leave, if any, will be the toxic shits like you.
---
Fair play, but this is only one suggestion. Still plenty of room for combat oriented spells. :)
---
Literally just brigading your opinion as fact with absolutely no claim or reason and trying to manipulate people's votes
---
Nice.
---
One again, an idiot presuming that the same people are making all these comments.
---
You know there are a fair few people who use this sub right? And these people are likely to have different opinions right? And are more likely to speak out against something they don't like?
---
You‚Äôre the only one being toxic in this thread man. I posted an opinion. You come in here firing shots. Look at yourself in a mirror.
---
Could bringing in Dungeoneering or Summoning skill be discussed to be brought in to OSRS? The rewards could be nerfed, with Summoning familiars reduced to cosmetic pets if necessary. I think these would be well received by the community. Even if not as a new skill, these as mini games would be good.
---
We will see when it comes to a vote :)
---
^Tee ^hee!
---
This is the wonder of democracy.
---
Obviously not, even for a troll this is so low effort that it hurts. Some people just can't do anything right
---
see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bduh8u/warding_design_blog/el1ujx6/) comment

---
That doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with anything.
---
Please don't use individual people opinions on a single platform to make changes to updates, you are the developers not randoms on reddit. Make decisions between the employees of jagex then poll it to the ENTIRE community not just reddit. Thankyou.
---
Corsair Cave drops
---
Dragon slayer 2 should be a req to vote on polls.
---
Having ignorant opinions is free, and has consequences everyone else pays off.
---
As a mechanic the warding concept is very good, actually - but the team need to think \*much\* harder about design. Naming, colours, etc. Do some research (like the OG devs did) into British or Anglo Saxon stories and find some real thematic anchors. 
---
If we end up with the totally generic, glowing, particle-effect bucket of nothingness that divination was I'll be very disappointed...
---
But it does.
---
Dungeoneering was certainly fun.  
---
It was enjoyable even for me, who loves skilling and detests combat - which is why I want more skilling content, rather than see every single update be about PvM or PvP.
---
Lets put it like this; without skills, RS would be another dead and dull PvM/PvP game like every other MMORPG out there.
---
Hell, they should re-poll Sailing over Warding, as Warding could be more an update to integrate with Runecrafting and other skills.
---
Better than warding ngl
---
So it seems.
---
Thanks for the answer. X3
---
No. Adding more shit has nothing to do with our current shit. Fuck off with that stupid justification lmao.
---
I've returned from several years of not really playing, so it was an actual question.
---
Dude how can you expect multiple thousands of people to all think the same exact way?
---
id argue against that, osrs was dying with the initial minimal updates. number of players playing over time contradicts what you said.
---
You kinda can make a good guess.
---
Almost as bad as stonemake ):
---
Its laughable that you think hiding the poll results will lead to a rigged vote. Do you not think they could have manipulated the numbers in the past to get the result they wanted? Its what the community wanted... Yet no one is happy.
---
Hm, I never said the skill had to be perfect.
---
Warding has it's appeal, but due to the community, I don't think it will pass - just like Sailing.
---
I'm all for a new skill though.
---
Artisailing.
---
The bottom line is voting is the achilles heel of OSRS, it brings so much good but thoroughly limits the game, too. Any marginal update for smaller communities will never pass, spite voting, keep it oldschool voting, powercreep, basically fucking everything you mentioned.
---
Design by committee is no design at all, and its sad to say but Jagex‚Äôs sins in the past made the vote system necessary, I‚Äôd much prefer if the threshold for passing was less punishing (75.00001% is a lot), or just that jagex proposes development for the future and low polling things don‚Äôt get put into development, but without hard thresh-holds.
---
Voting just doesnt work in a community made up of thousands of sub communities, few players play the game the same, so theres no unification of ideas.
---
What? I believe you missed the entire point... and you do realise we are still adding more ‚Äòshit‚Äô as you put it? Did we not have the Kebos update adding more stuff? It‚Äôs an MMO, you **NEED** content to keep the game going.
---
or maybe i dont want to walk round for 2 hours doing a shitty running quest when i could be doing the best part of the game. grinding repeatedly. quests are shite they just lock the best stuff behind them.
---
Do you have a wiki link?

Hmm I think you're looking for r/runescapehentai

Literally the most requested thing by the community when they sent out a questionnaire to players a few months back was a new skill.
---
Don't make sweeping judgements with no actual evidence
---
Zero chance that will pass imo, its a kinda interesting concept but just so tacked on and generally a poor idea
---
lekker hoor
---
We got our hidden poll results they‚Äôll get their warding
---
Getting your progress reset to zero for a single mistake is no fun.

---
If you press down 1 and 4 (or 1 and 6 doing mahog tables for example) at the exact same time you won't have to press them every time. It will be like holding down space bar while skipping dialogue but works for deleting what you build (option 1), telling butler to get more planks (option 1) and building whatever you're building (option 4).
---
You know you did it right if you hold down both at the same time and it loops 14141414141414 til your chatbox is filled
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was just a magic version of crafting but there‚Äôs a lot of overcomplicated layers to it that also effects the game way more than a skill should. I.e the battlewards etc
---
I agree. Warding shouldn't be introduced as a whole entire new skill, it should be the items from warding implented in skills we already have. Or even new methods, just not a whole new skill for them...
---
Too much is in need of an update for them to throw a new skill in the mix.
---
As such, I will be voting no :)
---
Crafting with soap
---
Aren't there more polls nowadays? 
---
The OSRS team has grown a lot and requires more work to do. The problem with that is that there can only be one active poll at the time. Because of that they seem to have shortened the average time a poll is active, so they can squeeze more of them in.
---
(I also wanted to say that they could focus on quality instead of quantity, but there were significant bugs in the recent months...)
---
I think it's because it's mostly an unnecessary post - You're not going to hear people in a subreddit dedicated to a game trying to turn you away from playing it! 
---
The best advice is to try it out - the game has a f2p side after all, or to just watch videos about the game or read recent updates to see what it's like
---
I said shit because I was phrasing it to agree with you. Many skills are shit. That does not excuse adding more garbage to the game. 
---
Kebos update was fabulous. You‚Äôd have to be braindead to compare that to warding. This is a pointlessly framed line of debate I‚Äôm not going to continue with. Go educate yourself.
---
Black claws confirmed for new BiS at Skotizo and Zammy.
---
if you thought he was serious and not memeing you need your head checking
---
Some have around 2k$ worth in the game lul, and tons of hours.. also having +500 days of membership remaining and more than one acc p2p .. welp thats me xD
---
That's some stake and interest in not ruining the game long-term, most the player base stakes aren't that high (healthier tbh)
---
This game has been ruined more than once so
---
I wouldnt imagine anyone who plays it would, and everyone has different ideas of what it going to shit entails. 
---
Imo the Kourend expansion was a bit underwhelming, though it was significant, I enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) most all of it. Sure grinding favour was.. kinda just a grind. Albeit small compared to most the grinds in game. The change of not losing favour for each house and having to be locked into one at a time was my personal hatred towards it, but I kinda jump around everywhere so, my personal experience was probably different than those who enjoy knocking things out in one sitting, one by one.
---
Plenty of people still cook fish at the Rouges Den, out of convenience. Though doing so in the Hosidious area with Cooking Gauntlets is the "best" way to do so, and the only real way I personally considered leveling it again, I understand why someone wouldnt care and would use the rouges fire..
---
 Doesnt make the clay range the only good way to do it.
---
The only good way to play the game is to simply do so in whatever way you enjoy it and prefer to, is what I'm saying.
---
Yet more troll posts, can we stop with these please
---
people are seriously thick as pigshit. to any normal person its obviously just a bit of a laugh. some people here cant help but take everything literally
---
NZ too, 
---
I get 40ms to all Aus worlds, next lowest is US at 150ms. I cry ery tim.
---
And also people act like theyre forced to do warding. U can vote yes and choose not to do it
---
I see more people being downvoted to oblivion for not wanting it to pass because they can't get streamers opinions and dicks out of their head and think for themselves.
---
No please change imbues from nmz
---
Id rather sailing or artisan over warding tbh, or even dung.
---
Aside from the fact that DG would take, as it took first time round, an obscene amount of dev time, I think DG was a great griup **minigame**
---
No skill in OSRS should be impossible to train viably without a team. If you didn't do your highest floors in 5-player c6 dungeons, you were throwing exp and tokens away by soloing them. Soloing the lower floors for almost no DG exp was only remotely bearable because fishing and wc training meta was skilling in c2 dungeons
---
If you complete varrock medium diaries you can buy 30 battlestaves from zaff per day and make them into water battlestaves (water has the lowest crafting req; 54), you profit around 60/70k a day by alching them, almost enough to maintain your kingdom!
---
56 magic needed for charging the water orbs.
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Streamers know the game better than these devs who want to introduce a game changing skill that they call magic version of crafting when there‚Äôs clearly way more levels too it that is overpowered and just stupid for oldschool
---
Welcome to high level min/maxing. GP per stat isn‚Äôt really considered when going for absolute BiS.

Damn that sucks to see
---
I think I need a but more than just sustaining itself though. I'm still not BIS by any stretch. Maybe I should leave it till last, the longer time goes on the more profit I'll make from slayer either way.
---
Because the results have to be known?? 
---
Im going to bed, now.
---
Hopefully by tomorrow you'll figure out why I'm concerned.
---
Ye, i think the purpose of the poll was just to throw ideas out there. Those 2 have been heavily criticized and will likely just be scrapped,
---
People who dont visit the website and stuff probably arent the ones voting anyway
---
This looks like a mini game/skill idea you have had for a while and slapped ‚Äòwarding v2‚Äô on it to fit with what‚Äôs going on with this sub. This shares nothing with original warding or even fills the gap it is trying to fill. This just sounds like a mini game tbh.
---
I‚Äôd rather have dungeroneering:... 
---
And I don‚Äôt even like the bloody skill
---
I love it! This is adorable!
---
How I feel about this entire website tbh
---
Zeah is big precisely so that they can easily add in future content in time to come. Adding such content to mainland wouldn't be such a good idea as people are gonna cry 'muh nostalgia' over what you see as ghost towns
---
But the results are known?? You understand that by "hiding poll results" it means they are hidden until the end and then the results are revealed, fully including the number? See the recent results post for an example, the actual numbers are still revealed, so runelite could still compare them to its own collected data.
---
Yeah, because you HAVE to level EVERYTHING. Man you guys really have to conplain about literally everything.
---
Stop playing if it bothers you this much.
---
Haha love the Runelite notification
---
Why does everyone complain about this quest lmao, there is one mildly annoying part where you can just hop worlds to speed it up
---
Thanks for the helpful advice ma dude
---
which skills are currently dead? and how would you revive them?
---
Venezuelans getting desperate I guess
---
Couldn't the crumble undead spell be removed from normal spellbook and instead add it, and the new undead spells to Arceus to make that more useful outside of teleporting + Prayer
---
Stop complaining jheez
---
Interesting but we already have bounty hunter mini game, and honestly people would just boost the shiz out of this. Like just grind kill each other to 99. Also what would the progression and inscenrives be? If you gained combat bonuses for higher levels then higher levels would just grind on lower levels and never have a chance really. Don‚Äôt really think they could implement something like this.
---
No. I am British, I am entitled to complain when and as I please.
---
Ironically love you for this, No homo tho... JK all the homo.
---
voting yes just for you

---
I don't want a new skill, I understand it appeals to some but I play the game to achieve end game and boss because that's what I enjoy. I skill to obtain/unlock those things but I don't enjoy it. Adding a new skill such as warding is just going to eventually require me to train it to unlock something beneficial for my bossing and I don't want that. If it gets passed I will eventually train it, but it's not something I'd want.
---
As for what makes a skill worth adding is what helps maintain popularity in the game for a longer period of time, if warding is going to make the majority of players enjoy the game more or for a longer period of time then it's worth it. I don't feel it will though.
---
If you want to just burn the xp from them, there is lots of afk, sand crabs, ammonite crabs, experiments. If you want better drops then Hill Giants or ice trolls. Guess you could arch them for magic Xp if you have the RC level for Nats.

Yessir my note 9 runs osrs in background perfectly. Until the auto 5m logout timer anyways

@Zesinua
---
That's the problem, neither most of the community nor jmods get the logic behind a good update, which is fun, extra incentives to play the game and healthy integration with the rest of the in-game economy.
---
The problem with new items is that they're usually terrible designs that either make obsolete previous content or are launched as obsolete alternatives. Because little thougth has been put into it. Because lack of creativity, things are designed to be "new BIS against this or that".
---
The consequences are displacing previous conting from its previous niche of use, where it had value for players.
---
This doesn't happen if new content is used on top of previous items to make the upgrades, as it keeps the previous tier valuable. IE: avernic defender / tentacle whip, as examples of addition/degradation. Degradation works best for items that are prone to get to alch prices, and perma upgrades for already valuable rares (armadyl chest plate would be an example).
---
Warding doesn't seem interesting, fun, nor incentivices anything healthy around it with things that already exist. It's meant to add new things to do in hunter and farming as a resource gathering for it. That's not terrible, but it relies on adding extra stuff because it failed to integrate on already existing content from these skills.
---
The proposed +15% magic bonus compared to ancestral set +6% is outrageous, it will steal its spot at both zulrah and raids 1, that's a terrible way to design it as harming previous content  is 100% avoidable.
---
If you look the overal feedback from reddit it won't make much sense, you're right on that. Look to end-game player's feedback instead. 
---
I was one of the 5k players interviewed about warding for feedback btw
---
You‚Äôre complaining about me complaining :D 
---
And surprisingly the weather is brilliant today, I bet it won‚Äôt last though.... it never does.

A lot of worlds have them, all same armour. Even at blue dragons. These ones just appear 1 after the other.
---
F
---
It would be like adding leather armour to fletching.
---
For the record - this post is pure sarcasm mocking the majority of the people complaining on this sub.
---
Yep, this me.
---
I just make shit up to say something ludicrous sometimes
---
$11
---
yea I need xp to get my range lvl up :)  
---
Ammonite might be a good idea for some seaweed spores as well
---
Has to be troll post
---
Would be a good mini-game but putting it into the mix with is a little bit risky. Pvp already got a learning curve that puts most people off trying.
---
i'd recommend afk nmz to get your CBs up
---
smooth animations are unplayable
---
So what you're essentially saying is "fuck off the wilderness is for PvPers and so PvPers should have an innate advantage"
---
I thought PKers were all about their leet skill, imagine being such wuzzes about an even playing field.
---
Firemaking. 
---
Why? Minigame to 99.
---
Fix: Pyrowarding
---
just add the warding mechanics somehow into existing skills e.g. RUNECRAFTIGT, MAGIC... 
---
The warding mechanics make sense and are a potencial golddrainer. 
---
If nobody wants a new skill why don't improve not popular existing skills ?
---
You can't argue with people who refuse any change.
---
Yes, 2 days is too short a wait. I'd give it between a week or two.
---
Cause people are idiots and didn't want their firelighters dropping in price to 1gp
---
Imagine being this salty lol
---
Happy cake day!
---
Changing the other skills just devalues the work people have done in them prior to this.   
---
On top of that it would upset so many guides and systems.  
---
As an addition to an old skill , Warding becomes a mess.  
---
As a new Skill, it doesn't tread on anything's feet.
---
Boat upkeep (planks, nails, rope, cloth), hire a sailing npc or even a little crew package (different levels of npc's for further sailing distances), quests to unlock docks in certain areas, decorations for your boat.
---
Too shit to stand your ground then I take it?
---
You cant be serious hahah
---
More like 10 hours
---
Kill all 6 brothers and 3 skeletons. That'll give you like 88.7% or something. You don't have to actively search for skeletons as they are pretty common. But if you really dont see any, you cant force spawn them by repeatedly passing through a door.
---
I think the high level robes are fine as long as the silks are hard to obtain, they are all niche and even if ancestral gets devalued it doesn't matter, ToB has other good drops and ancestral will still be BIS for PvP. I agree on battlewards they are bad and gay, but I think wards that help skilling make significantly more money would be nice as skilling is underpowered and pointless at the moment.
---
&gt;pointless
---
Meanwhile firemaking and runecrafting (npc shops sell them) are just sitting there like "sup"
---
Well running into insurmountable numbers of inbred cretins in the wild does that to you.
---
Idk. I think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs on about. Who knows.
---
ok ty
---
Walking a chunk over and walking back is hard, I know
---
Otherwise they'd lock it under a tree stump and it'd make the game unplayable.
---
You're right they don't have to make sense.  Runescape Runescape comment warding meme. Chill out dude it's just a joke.
---
you could say you expand your magical skills learned from runecrafting combine them with the magic skill and tada you can craft magical weapons.
---
if you want to add some logic in a fantasy game?
---
It's only easy when you only display the results instead of the leadup. How many more people are going to fail to understand?
---
100% agree, although give a 75% pass rate, Reddit might be loud enough to stop it.
---
Getting 75% yes is a lot harder than getting 25% no, even the slightest controversy can halt an update.
---
You know the risk going into the wildy. Dunno what you're so salty about. Don't like being PK'd then don't go.
---
Only on site not in polls or ingame
---
When you can play that minigame with zero gear and little to no stats, yeah it's absolutely free. 
---
Arcane costs about 130m, running raids (arguably the best money in game, averaging 3m per hour) to get enough money for it you would have to run for 43 hours in basically max gear. Dungeoneering I could do at low levels and could literally just get carried by people.
---
Do you still not see the problem here? I don't have a problem with dungeoneering, but I absolutely have a problem with how it ruined the price of gear
---
&gt; It‚Äôs a funny meme
---
Yikes
---
Wilson is entirely right though. I always thought the time for a new skill would be either when the wider community was desperately spamming for one, or if the game were to dip in popularity and dev's needed something to garner the interest of the entire playerbase.
---
Not sure why this has been pushed out as a priority right now, the game is in a very healthy place.
---
I like the gameplay, there seems to be several ways to train and they are all simple and nice like skills should be.
---
Low hp or supplies? Always eat to full and bank before getting low supplies. There are plenty of options you're just not smart enough to think of them
---
Doesnt need to be better xp than current methods though
---
Anyone who dislikes looters at nechs is an arse, period.
---
Youre purposefully leaving the items for over a minute you deserve to lose them, it *doesnt affect* the stacking of the nechs to run out and grab the items, I do it myself when bursting
---
Yeah I enjoy the occasional rush because otherwise I get a bit bored!
---
Wet have reached our quality post limit for the year. Back to moving GE to funny locations posts
---
So change to pvp would then put more people off trying it?
---
it isnt irrelevant tho. it is a method to get the level how bad it might be.
---
&gt; But reddit speaks very loud
---
Too loud...
---
Maybe this has been explained elsewhere and I've not seen it, but I'm genuinely curious. If someone can enlighten me it would be appreciated.
---
If the poll is a yes or no vote, why is the 3rd option of being able to skip the question effecting the percentage of both yes and no votes? Based off the way its presented in the blog post, 'Yes' is off by 0.2% not because players didn't want it, but 19.4% of voters didn't have an opinion..? Does this cause this to fail because it doesn't hit the required 75%? Am I way off in this one?
---
Build a better account if u want an even field, there's a reason PK  accounts are usually pures. With all the different PVM content in game why are you so salty about PVM nerds vs Pkers? I've met plenty of players who don't have much issue pking in the wildy, learn to make friends, learn to anti pk man. I've gone to the wildy plenty, just for pvm. And ya know what? I've made tons of money off dragons. I've lost tons too but that's the risk. I don't think the issue is a level playing field i think the issue is players not being good and getting salty. People will cry and say it's unfair but runescape is a game of skill/rng/luck. It's a lotta numbers, just build a pure and stop crying man ü§î
---
You think PK‚Äôers should be on even ground with PvMers in the wild...? What?
---
That's what I say for everyone I swipe right in
---
15 years of RuneScape and I only realize this now.
---
But will the skill?
---
This is exactly how I feel about the warding blog too, and I swear I remember they said something like "ahrims and ancestral will still be relevant mage armors" which you like you said, the new robes will outpower even ancestral at some of the only few places to use them, ancestral will only be used in slayer and inferno after, cant really think where else it'll stay relevant.
---
That + it was polled before the 'skip question' option was a thing. They should honestly just give it (and possibly artisan too) a repoll if warding fails considering how small the margin was.
---
Which person are you referring to? The only person that comes to mind is M enzy and he said he does about 20 per hour.
---
*newb
---
what incentive is it to not be rigged? right lol?
---
Summoning should be integrated into prayer, it's on theme and it desperately needs something new, rather than grinding for protection prayers/vengeance/smite.
---
Me too. I'm a mobile noob, hunting players like OP are the only way I can improve lmaoo
---
Jesus
---
Hopefully runelite will add an option to hide it
---
Remove battle wards and increase the power of the skilling wards, skilling is underpowered at the moment. This does not step on ancestral too much as ancestral is still BIS in PvP. 
---
Also make keep it simple, I don't think you should need to equip some  random lamp to train the skill
---
Some things aren't aggressive.
---
You say you want people to explain the opposing viewpoint, but you're clearly not intetested in even considering agreeing with anything since you've already made up your mind. You're just here to rant and want to hear people tell you you're right.
---
As to the actual topic, the other comments have said enough. Re-evaluate your level of butt-hurt and come back when you've learned more about the game. Your viewpoint is naive and uninformed.
---
Well he's a god not a jmod.
---
Not my point, i'm asking why they aren't more penalized for being skulled than they are, and why world hopping can't be removed from wild.
---
100% did
---
The magic armours aren't the only content? Disassembly, splashing substituting, imbues and aoe buff wards are other contents of the skill?
---
Players who suggest this will never admit how true this is. They just want this skill to be buyable/faster.
---
Is it one of the worlds that they said would be under maintenance about a week ago?
---
Dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever read on here. And I don‚Äôt ever pk.
---
Like you would ever get slayer 99 a second time. Congrats anyway
---
Can you draw a naked version? thanks
---
Still haven't recieved anyone justifying why the 0 as opposed to 3 (or 1-4) on potential death and a measly 20 minute timer to get rid of skull is enough of a deterrent, or risk.
---
Also haven't heard anyone give a solid reason for why world hopping isn't disabled in the wild.
---
mini maps textures look different
---
What
---
Yes
---
All gear the chaotics replaced (there were other items also, but I can't remember all the names). Chaotics were free and were BiS in every single situation.
---
I Think the platform is more predictable when avoiding the monkeys, But it is a bit longer. If you go on the wiki, there is an exellent map of the platform with safe plages to stand.
---
Dad? You're coming home?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it stays active just like a sell offer for a members item would stay active, I‚Äôve personally left my members items for sale when I let membership run out.
---
What if the robes were reinforced with magic, stopping anyone trying to harm the caster with melee combat while being weak to ranged attacks?
---
There's a bunch of memes surrounding crab rave, it's peak was mid 2018 iirc and there'd be some text over it. A notable one is that it would say "OBAMA IS GONE" over the crabs as the beat drops.
---
You can boss across the whole map. You can only pk in a select portion of the map. Dragons are in many other locations outside of the wild. So are demons. There‚Äôs even a demon-only lair that‚Äôs outside of the wild. 
---
You can fight back quite easily. It‚Äôs called anti-pking. You‚Äôll need the appropriate gear, stats and your PvP skill level will play a big factor in your success. As much as PvMing is click and afk, it‚Äôs a much more hectic gameplay style when PvPing so don‚Äôt expect it to be a walk in the park like PvMing is. 
---
Either you‚Äôre quite salty and twisting the truth or you‚Äôre a new player and don‚Äôt have much game knowledge. Regardless, it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt have a basic understanding of the game.
---
I agree, just look at how letting stupid people vote ‚Äî&gt; trump
---
Korasi quest.
---
Rc good
---
!remindme 8 months
---
I know. Have like a cat doing some toy story level out of character things, and the player can't but notice it, and question the puss. Take like the amulet of catspeak, and make it enchant it to amulet of animal speak, with the camulet or something, then speak to the doggo, and have like some important stuff going on, that needs a brave adventure seeking blob's direct attention.
---
Make some crazy 'Cats &amp; Dogs' references all thorough the quest, and create some new quest series, that has all the weird animal quest series mashed up in the end.
---
All this leads to the simple and most important thing we need, and want into the osrs right now..
---
To have the option of having pupper as your follower.
---
V
---
Those players at the bottom half of the image are the type of people to facecheck enemy jungle at 35+ minutes when baron's up and throw.
---
The problem isn't the game design, the problem is you are underlevelled as fuck if you have 36hp. I'm sure my baby account with 27hp would get one-shot by Kree'arra, but does that mean the game design is bad? No; it means my character needs to raise her stats a bit more. I'm presuming you want to kill Lava dragons, yes? Those super high-level dragons that require safespots to kill? Yeah, they weren't designed poorly, they were just designed for people with a higher hitpoint level than 36.
---
Instead of a new old school styled skill, can we get OP RS3 styled prayers?
---
Your whole argument was about "easier total levels" then go back on what you said saying it's not because of total levels. What a joke.
---
Who said anything about exp rates? You realise lavas are a buyable right? You think people will pay money to get the same rate they can get at bloods?
---
Yeah same. And I did it very early game, like 56 Agility. Was one of the easiest quests for me. I didn't even know you could fail :o
---
TIL.
---
Guess it has something to do with the warding blog in the part of the dragon related mage robs?
---
RUNic Energy CRAFTING
---
I don't even see a difference.
---
Soul split will make sgs and guthans go worthless. And pking becomes more aids than it is now
---
I enjoy doing most skills but Warding in it's current state looks extremely grindy. :(
---
Rargh is good
---
but warding actually bridges the gap until 70 magic...
---
We need item sinks for??? Rune plate bodies??? Black dhide?? Mystics??? Said no one ever lol
---
"You can only do that in wilderness 20 or below".
---
Dead.
---
I'm also an ironman so quite literally none of your suggestions are applicable.
---
Flair your post so it isnt removed
---
Craft and make are synonymous.
---
We can't have that, it's my password
---
i would wait to sell till they release the dhcb recolours? might get up in price right before the update.
---
remove polling and let jamflex do whatever they want
---
Yeah you're definitely right and honestly with this recent blog my mind has changed a lot! I'm still used to thinking of warding as the boring, dead content it was first announced as. Now I think they've got the opposite problem with the skill being too complex and affecting combat and different parts of the game. I'm still on the fence but definitely more on board than before. :)
---
The map textures are different. Both screen caps were done on the original client with the same brightness settings and different characters. I don't think this has ever been pointed out by another player though I could be wrong...
---
They have said multiple times that they feel forced to always be creating new content because that's what brings in new players and interests the majority of old players too.
---
We have a vocal minority on here who want the game's oldest features to be revisited and revised.
---
I go there expecting to die and I'm 126
---
Every time i see this reposted....
---
A
---
I mean I get it's a joke but you gotta give shit like that some time to die down. Like wait till they start rebuilding first and can come back from the tragedy.
---
Where are these posted?
---
I'm fine with being guilty if it means speaking the truth.
---
Then you're under-levelled. Can't wait for you to try GWD or Corporeal Beast at fifty-seven combat and get emotional when the bosses start stamping on you.
---
At current a competent brid can really do a lot of damage and keep pressure up, trying to get you to dupe you to use the wrong prayer on their attack, using movement and the environment to their advantage. If all players can use these wards then they will just add it on the top. Unless there is a specific criteria for there use ( need parts of a set to use ) or specific glyth on gear etc
---
Noob
---
they already did for range lol, fletching, wc, and crafting are all needed to make range gear 
---
melee: smith and mining
---
magic: lol heres some runes gl
---
God damn everyone bums osrs, rs3 is much better with revolution.
---
Why would you want to make a new account just for nostalgias sake to get bored in a month?
---
so what about the part where i said he's talking about the reddit community regarding updates and how they react? how this sub lists points that make it to the front page saying exactly what he is saying. 
---
he even generalized his comment so u cant fuck up that one thing.  even the thing about RS3 ur taking the reddit community say on it, engraving it as ur own opinion when it has been said tons of times on this sub. have you ever played rs3? or are u just saying RS3 = BAD
---
That's a good idea. They should add funorb to the burthrope games room, and we can play arcanists as a minigame.
---
Them headphones are gonna eat him.
---
polls and dev blog posts aren't well advertised to people who aren't plugged into them imo, if you're not someone who's been playing for years and knows the shakedown you probably have no clue they exist
---
I'm a decently new player, i'm a CB level 41 ironman.
---
May be true, but i'm not an idiot and I can see the glaring fucking issue that mini sized fenced areas pose with fucking world hopping allowed in a PvP zone, and nothing from the game client to hinder PKers like quite literally any other MMO has.
---
Go take your nostalgia boner to an actual 07 private server if you want to play the game from 12 years ago so badly. All these updates over the past 6 years and yet you draw the line at a new skill. Fucken great mental processing right there.
---
Yeh you can still pay by card. You're defiantly on the correct website? Can you not buy the membership via amazon?
---
You will be able to do it easily
---
Sell offers will remain, not sure about buy
---
&gt; So... they can't/wont do both.
---
How does what I said imply that they can't or won't do both. You cannot literally get everything you desire all at one time in the game. It's impossible. They pipeline content as best they can with their team size, yet you still deny new content just because they haven't followed the priority you personally wish they chose?
---
&gt; That may be your argument, but mine is that it DOES.
---
If RuneCrafting is to Magic what Fletching is to Ranged, how does putting the proposed features in RuneCrafting fit?
---
Range - Fletching - Crafting
---
Magic - RuneCrafting - RuneCrafting???
---
I want to hear how RC fits wardings design other than you craft runes to use for magic, and warding creates magic armour? Where is the link that makes RC relevant for what warding offers. Granted I think the Rune Altars are much better places and can be re-used for what was proposed in the blog as the fit more theamatically to mage in general, but the general rewards and skill don't go much past this.
---
&gt; But they have never suggested anything. One of my big points is that they're forcing this new skill without actually fixing existing skills.
---
Meandering over this point is the most pointless back and forth in the world. If we fix skills now we get warding later. If we get warding now skills get fixed later. What is the purpose of saying 
---
FIX SMITHING NO SKILL BAD when it doesn't positively contribute anything? It denies content for no reason other than everyones subjective opinions on the priority of content being released. 
---
For instance, what changes if they say "We're stopping warding UNTIL we have given you some changes for smithing and runecrafting, THEN we will propose warding!". If you read that sentence, what changes in your mind that suddenly makes warding acceptable and fine? They can and have equally said they want to change Smithing and are hesitant about RC. We can see from other skills that they DO fix them and add a lot of content and methods to train, such as crafting, farming, fishing and to a smaller extent most other skills have received updates to make them SIGNIFICANTLY easier and more enjoyable than what original 07 provided.
---
Neither is
---
Beverley hills.
---
This game's all about short cuts, hell that's why the GE is there. All i'm asking for is quite simply that the PvPer need walk up to me, not spawn in my face to get a shot to kill me.
---
I'd not be able to world hop away either, but the instant fuck you of world hopping wild is flawed and fucking daft.
---
Yeah definitely using the verified site. Would amazon option come up on the sight or would I have to do that through amazon? I‚Äôm also curious if it‚Äôs this way because I have an old unpaid balance?
---
Yes I have played RS3, but your english is not very good so I cant make sense of what you say in the rest of your post.
---
I'm sure it did. But it was also so bad that a literal back up of the game had to be brought back and is more popular.
---
Holy shit this seems convoluted and confusing.
---
They still offer lower exp rates than most other skills, require more attention than multiple other methods, and cost a decent bit to level with. I hope you can tell the difference between that and a semi-afkable crafting styled training method.
---
I wouldn't, since I choose what monsters I fight and which ones I don't.
---
I don't quite get that luxury when it comes to the PKing cretins, in fact since they're able to spawn quite literally inside my character model I can't do much of anything againt them.
---
How will they ever recover from this tragedy? Wait, they already have over 400 million dollars in donations? Wait, Catholics are notoriously intertwined in wealth and won‚Äôt have a problem at all recovering? Weird
---
I like how the other comments are saying ‚Äúnobody knows‚Äù and getting way more upvotes than this correct answer
---
I guess time will tell
---
I think a new skill should wait until a few of the current skills get more fleshed out. Ex. Thieving, Hunter, Firemaking, Fletching or Runecrafting.
---
It‚Äôs still sounds easier than warding lol
---
The pass/fail percentages are objectively innacurate due to skip votes counting as no votes. If you look in game the final percentages are properly tallied and you can still see the total number of skip votes.
---
Yeh I'd assume they've stopped you making payments via a card because one has bounced in the past. I say assume because idk really üòõ but yeh on amazon you can buy the membership and it gives you a code. Not something I've done before if I'm honest, but I know amazon is legit and they sell em' on there
---
There's bots with tens of millions of xp what do you mean they won't last that long
---
Haha that's not what I mean. In Maplestory 1, if you used their version of the GE, you would end up remembering the max value because some items would be worth more than that, and if you put your item up there for anything less, it could be bought at that price and you'd lose out on the money. Setting it at absolute max (along with another trick) stops anyone from buying it, but is able to see it and express their interest.
---
After typing it tens of thousands of times, I still remember it after 10 years of not playing that game.
---
well you don't get access to a lot of teleports until higher levels, and you still can't teleport everywhere.
---
so if you're doing quests it helps to have higher agility
---
They should just throw a poll out there, ‚Äúshould we let you guys see our skill version of dungeoneering or would you rather us continue working on warding?‚Äù I‚Äôd love to have it back as a skill.
---
Warding for f2p
---
Weird to see myself in the chat of someone else's Reddit post
---
rs3 is always open if you want to max in 2 weeks
---
Stams is a high lvl pvmer who trolls all the time
---
inb4 jesus beam
---
I quit Runescape back in the day just shortly after dungeoneering came out, because it didn't feel "Runescape" enough to be a new skill. That said, I actually really like warding. It'll make magic less separate from the other skills.
---
I disagree. People used to think Runescape had no more combat mechanics to explore ofter Nex. We saw that wasn't true with the inferno and Raids 1 &amp; 2.
---
Not a clue mate, don't use this much, just thought it was mad.
---
&gt;Reddit - "Hide poll results" Devs do it Reddit - "Now everything is rigged, how can we trust the polls?"
---
I thought the point of hiding the poll results was to keep the hidden until *after* the poll was completed by a player. Are they completely hidden now, regardless of poll completion?
---
Heroin or meth would have been a better choice.
---
DVS' Twitter poll literally means nothing. Those who follow him are biased to whatever he says. 
---
So the poll and subsequent poll are biased. Also the sample size is too small.
---
Some feedback. I do want to preface this with I think the general concept/idea is super solid and like a lot of what I see but;
---
I do think whoever typed up the news post did a sloppy job constructing and explaining it (a video showcasing things, along with the text wouldn't have hurt either). Which i think really hurt with the communities reaction btw. First impressions/presentations are important. Some of it comes across way too convoluted. I'm going to hold off on judgement until I see some video of someone like no exp wasting training it, to see if the skill itself is convoluted or not (and if it is, then its up to you guys to improve that) but yeah, the blog post was confusing at parts and just messy/out of order in others. Like I said, not constructed well. 
---
And I think you're trying to do too much with it at the start. Save some ideas for 6, 9 or 12 months post release for a potential "batch 2", and send out another survey to anyone with high warding. Example i saw no content over level 80 in the concept screenshots (that doesn't mean there isn't any content higher, but lets just use 80 for example, this number could be anything, whatever level is the highest level of content that warding has to offer)  Send out this survey to anyone over level 80 warding and ask them the simple question of "Do you think warding lacks content, do you think it needs more". If the answer to that question is a resounding yes, then pitch a blog for ideas (like battle wards/conjuring and many more im sure you/the community has) for a "batch 2", leave that up for a few weeks, then poll those ideas and boom, you have final ideas to put in for a batch 2/expansion of the skill. Do a couple of previous community rounds to cut the fat sorta speak if needed. 
---
Keep the release simple/close to the concept/idea of warding (its solid). Expand more from whats currently there later if needed.
---
Thats my feedback so far, if you can call it feedback.
---
Can confirm that sell offers remain. At least I only need 3.5 mil this time. I really wish OSRS would stop lying to me about how much time I have left on my bond. Cut off a whole day this time.
---
Why would we need another sink when alching is more than fine?
---
Ok...so no direct correlation to Jagex/RS at all then. Whats with the pvp clans / jagex comment? $11 speaks for itself, so no explanation needed.
---
Currently we have something similar to Warding but it was an Add-on to crafting. As well as most other skill enhancements built into our elite skill "Invention"  
---
Warding shouldn't be in OSRS. Don't tarnish my nostalgia-scape with new skills &lt;/3
---
Usually I mute the login music but this time, I will let it play through in honor of Bloodi12341. RIP &lt;3
---
I wasn't talking about the people, I was talking about from a development stand-point. It was never stated that it must remain 2007 at all, or that it would. Just that it was going to be based on a backup of the game from 2007.
---
And for those people, they probably should've already left the game, considering things like graceful and blowpipe exist.
---
Exactly they weren‚Äôt good and calculated game design decisions. This why players do not trust Jagex.
---
It‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt like change. Me personally I‚Äôm not a fan of new updates which add new content.
---
Yeah they should definitely poll it all separately but I think then we'll be left with the skill having no rewards again and just being a dead, boring skill. :( I'm not too hyped on a new skill anyway so I'm not too bothered but it sucks for those that do I guess. :/
---
Is this a pasta? Because you sound pretty funny right now.
---
well that's the point, he does it himself.
---
We just need Tedious to make us a glorious spreadsheet that generates random skilling tasks!
---
The issue I see is that while yes, they COULD be added to existing skills, what's the harm in making a new skill? Do Old-School players fear change THAT much?  
---
This solution overcomplicates the update. What could be added in a neat little package called Warding will instead add content for so many other skills, including Magic which is already oversaturated.  
---
Trust the alt-right 4channers to hate new ideas.
---
eh, it's only existed as long as ZMI, and its only been viable as long as super high money makers became more common
---
VVKool Impossible
---
literally why old school exists
---
If people actually quit because they add a new skill, they are the regressive ones. We can make ranged and melee gear but not mage gear? It's a flawed system to begin with and thats undeniable for the fact.
---
However the skill should still fit the theme and mindset of the existing ones for the sake of integrity and lets say legitimacy. 
---
Just looking at it, it doesn't fit. Its way to a complex system and structure that just doesn't synergies with the rest. If you made making mage gear this complicated then you now need to change making ranged and making melee as complicated to fit the theme. 
---
Rs3 did this mistake, they now need to revamp almost every other skill system because of the mining and smithing rework; basically making runescape 4 in the process. Which is good but rs3 will die before it can happen.
---
nah that wouldn't have made sense
---
&gt; yet somehow people are against having a non-combat magic-related skill that isn't running back and forth between an altar and a bank.
---
except from the dev blog it's pretty clear that warding isn't simply going to be "smithing/crafting but for magic". There's a ton more to it with a ton of very powerful rewards and mechanics. If it actually was just smithing or crafting for magic I'd be more inclined to vote yes. As it is now it's just too much.
---
Abyss streams with one almost every day lol.
---
Yeah I agree, thanks for the feedback!
---
I definitely downvote people that have a shitty attitude, even if I agree with them. I feel that being a douche doesn't contribute to a healthy discussion, and that bad vibes are what lead to the 'hivemind hysteria' we get over stuff like Konar's drop table (which only needed a few minor tweaks)
---
Maybe this is a runelite thing, but I get an announcement when I log in when there is a new blogpost, can't recall if it also notifies of polls but I want to say it does.
---
Could be done well, unlike how WoW did it.
---
Really depends on the devs.
---
I‚Äôm flattered that you think it deserves 9k by now, but I‚Äôm excited that this has already surpassed my last art!
---
My point is smithing and crafting have more than one combat purpose. Warding is an amalgamation of crafting, runecrafting, hunter, farming, and magic. Just for the sake of making mage armor. Of course not! So to add more use for warding we want conjuring for combat (summoning) and battle wards. But we also want to take apart items. Ok add dissolve so now we can take apart smithed and crafted items using a completely different skill than what created them.
---
Well we can also craft weapons using warding I guess too. So now we make mage weapons using crafting and warding? 
---
It's a catch all skill that is a complete cluster fuck.
---
This hurt my soul
---
A lot of the things orange man does fall into that category but alright
---
As if gear can't ever be balanced before it's released, or after it's released, and we're stuck with the original pitch forever?
---
&gt;adding a new skill is less complicated than adding content to old skills
---
What? You want a new skill every update?
---
So without the DWarhammer comment this would not have made sense, but with it it does, allow me to explain.
---
Vorkah has lvl 214 Defence
---
Bgs hits away 1 lvl per 1 damage you do.
---
Warhammer hits a flat 30% of the REMAINING defence.
---
214√ó0.3=64,2 so 1 Warhammer spec hits away 64 defence, and 2 would hit (214-64)√ó0,3=108.94 so 108 lvls since rs rounds everything down (i vaguely remember)
---
Thus for a BGS to be on-par with a warhammer hit, you need to spec a 64 to gain the same defence reduction. But the second hit only needs to hit 44. 
---
But why do people use BGS at vorkath instead of warhammer if warhammer reduces by so much so easily you might ask? BGS is a lot more accurate than hammer.
---
Oh boy, reading some of the comments in this thread, it seems that's what everyone who's against this skill is screeching about, "this is old school, if I want a new skill I'll play RS3" 
---
I'll ask you a question in return, why can't we, after 6 years of OSRS being released, have a new skill FINALLY" is it really so bad? I think the amount of content can be justified by having it as a seperate skill, we have Smithing for melee, Crafting for range, why can't we having something for magic? Something that isn't just running from an altar to a bank and back again just as a money making method. No one uses runecrafting to actually craft runes to use, everyone just gets their runes from shops or drops. 
---
The only way to get most magic armour currently is through monster drops. Doesn't that seem a little off to you?
---
The battlewards I'm a bit sceptical about, but we haven't seen how they fully work in-game and what actual purpose players will use them for. 
---
And the main thing to have in mind, is this isn't even the final product, things will be changed if this does get released, and yet all I keep seeing is comments like "it's bad" "it's a bad skill" "it's unnecessary" without any actual reasons as to why. Not including people just downvoting because of some BS total-level elitism which is the funniest and saddest shit I've seen in a while.
---
&gt;Do you really want the first skill to be added just be an expansion on already existing content?
---
Honestly I'm glad that it will incorporate some use of other skills rather than being a stand-alone thing like Dungeoneering was. Crafting incorporates smithing, smithing directly runs off mining, and thieving is good for farming, which is good for herblore, both firemaking and fletching are based off woodcutting.
---
They mentioned how time consuming it is when addressing a suggestion for the toolkit you get from the Rogue's den maze. It isn't a simple addition to add a dig option
---
Honeslty runescrafting and warding should be combined.
---
Yeah I agree with that. OP just had quite the list of demands in regards to that. I would say that the Mods are extremely fair, receptive, and generous with the amount of things that are polled. And OP said he actually quit the game because A) they re-polled idea's after tweaking them B) An idea passed that he didn't like after poll results being hidden and C) I forget the last point and can't see the post right now but there's definitely a third.
---
Osrs is definitely a special case, but considering how much power the community does have compared to almost every single other game, assuming the fact that you genuinely do enjoy the game, that honestly sounds super bratty if that's the actual reasons you quit the game, does it not? sounds like a the spoiled brat of super rich parents who gets everything he wants and then one day doesn't get his way, despite the fact that he's super fortunate to get what he already does. And i don't think this super common phenomenon would occur as often as it does with osrs in other games because when an update comes out that you don't like, there is no point getting outraged in such a way because you know theres nothing that you can do about it.
---
\&gt;You cannot literally get everything you desire all at one time in the  game. It's impossible. 
---
Right. Which is why people want them to focus on fixing existing things instead of making new things that will cause problems. You're making the argument "well, they'll get to that down the line." It's been 20 years. Smithing still sucks. FM still sucks. I'm not interested in a new skill that will suck just so they can maybe eventually get to fixing existing skills.
---
\&gt;If RuneCrafting is to Magic what Fletching is to Ranged, how does putting the proposed features in RuneCrafting fit?
---
\&gt;Range - Fletching - Crafting
---
\&gt;Magic - RuneCrafting - RuneCrafting???
---
Magic - Crafting - Runecrafting (- Magic)
---
\&gt;Where is the link that makes RC relevant for what warding offers.
---
RC takes non-magical items and makes them magical. The only reason there isn't a link is because they chose not to make one in lieu of making a new skill instead. That's kind of the crux of my argument.
---
\&gt;Meandering over this point is the most pointless back and forth in the world. 
---
You say it's pointless, but you havent actually provided any reasons as to why it's pointless. It's a pretty big deal that they want to add in a new skill while there's still 20 year old skills that suck and/or could used in place of the new one.
---
\&gt;If we fix skills now we get warding later. 
---
Okay, sounds good. Lets do that. Maybe in the 2-3 years it takes them to actually come up with a solution, they can actually find a unique voice for Warding.
---
\&gt;What is the purpose of saying FIX SMITHING NO SKILL BAD when it doesn't positively contribute anything?
---
It does contribute something, because as you have pointed out, there is limited ability for jagex to work on something. Saying "oh, they'll get to that down the line" is insufficient when these are things that have been asked for for YEARS. They have chosen to work on a new skill instead of fixing old skills that are in drastic need of some love. That's problematic. That's basically like starting a camp fire while ignoring multiple raging fires nearby.
---
\&gt;It denies content for no reason other than everyones subjective opinions on the priority of content being released.
---
The new content isnt unique, it's just new. It could easily fall within currently-existing skills. There is no reason for a new skill to be created. CoX isn't dungeoneering because OSRS didn't need a new skill that could easily not be a skill. OSRS doesn't need a 24th skill if what that 24th skill brings to the game quite literally already exists within the 23 existing skills.
---
\&gt;For instance, what changes if they say "We're stopping warding UNTIL we  have given you some changes for smithing and runecrafting, THEN we will  propose warding!".
---
Nothing changes unless their proposal for what warding is changes. It's not a good/unique skill in it's present state.
---
\&gt;They can and have equally said they want to change Smithing and are hesitant about RC.
---
But they arent doing anything about it. Instead they're making an entirely new skill.
---
\&gt;We can see from other skills that they DO fix them and add a lot of content and methods to train
---
Okay, and? Their proposal for warding isn't good. It's a clearly top-down design intended to bandaid issues within the game instead of dealing with them in ways that dont compel the entire playerbase to grind out another 99. I don't want them to release a new skill that they'll then have to spend 5 years working on because it was implemented poorly. That's just creating needless work and a sink for dev time.
---
The conjuring, I agree, Arceeus spellbook suited and I love the concept. But the restorative, preotection, or buffing -wards- i think do make sense within the skill, almost bard-like
---
He and Suomi should just go ride off into the sunset.
---
Any quality of life options rejected is about as dumb as it gets.
---
It's more like half, honestly. Most are decent people that get caught up in hysteria and would rather parrot shitty meme responses than contribute to discussion
---
So like imbuing cloth to make robes?
---
Sounds familiar from a devblog post yesterday....
---
Complicated and grindy are both good things for a skill to be imo.
---
Different opinons.
---
Another way of spelling "iron man" is "fe male"
---
I'm kinda hoping we get dungeoneering someday.
---
I will vote no to warding but I would vote yes to keeping **some** of the warding features in the form of Runecrafting.
---
Saying "its so bad I'm gonna wash my mouth with buckshot" is not caring.
---
Honestly buddy it sucks but take it as a lesson and learn from it. 
---
Id delete this post as people can be pretty cruel on this subreddit and make you feel worse.

Add warding, move runecrafting to warding :)
---
Fucking hell captain obvious, that was quick...
---
I'm asking what those opinions are...
---
Its my home world too lol. Havent played on other world since i get 1500 total
---
Its like a reverse brainlet meme
---
Yes they're not all worth 30m, but the best drop ( spear) is worth 15m and is only 1/127 and thus decently common
---
Changing meta is fine. Making meta worse.  No good
---
People too tanky in pvp. Want higher dps. What jagex do? Propose cheap tank armor. Thats no bueno.
---
Well since magic is known to be the most expensive to train and maintain, id probably say that fits the mantra. 
---
It would also make sense given that melee and ranged have methods to make the armour but mage is significantly lacking.
---
13 health pot mordekaiser start was the best
---
Its the gamer kneejerk reaction.  Immediately call something shit, without really forming a basis for why or offering constructive feedback.  You see this all the time in frequently updated games.
---
The issue i have with this argument is that having skills not combined with others is poor game design. I agree that skills should have been combined at conception but what's done is done. This is NEW content that can very easily be slapped into EXISTING skills in the form of an update. Why should we use the poor game design of the past to justify adding warding as a new skill? 
---
I do understand the nostalgia perspective but i disagree. I would say 80% of the osrs playerbase is 18-30 playing a game that's been out for 6+ YEARS, which is quite a long time for a game to be still raising in popularity. I think it's sad that we refuse to add something to the game that is different than what's already existing for the sake of nostalgia. I bet you my entire bank that 95% of the people who started playing osrs got to higher levels then their rs2 accounts  in a SUBSTANTIALLY shorter amount of time than they did back in the day. Everything past that point is all "new content" to them and doesnt warrant a feeling of nostalgia. What's nostalgic about the game is the environment. Remembering "selling 5k lobbies 200gp ea" and "buying rune scim 25k". Remembering how stupid you were as a child. PKing with your friends. Trying to quest without a guide. Getting into world 1 or 2 gave you a rush because it was full 100% of the time. It was the innocence and vast unknown that created nostalgia. We are older and wiser and should be able to handle adding a new, innovative skill to the game without people going REEE NOSTALGIA. Nostalgia is a bullshit argument at this point of the game's lifecycle. New players who only played osrs would probably like to see a new skill that's innovative, not a skilling patch pushed as a skill.
---
There's currently 23 skills in osrs, some of them can be combined but should not because it's dumb to remove skills that people put effort into. Why should we settle for a skill, arguably what the game revolves around, that can EASILY be slotted into existing skills? 
---
As a side note, if this game was new today i would combine the following skills: woodcutting, firemaking, hunter into "scavenging" skill. runecrafting into magic. fletching into crafting.
---
what makes you think it couldn‚Äôt possibly apply here?
---
Why is that? As a new player (2.5 months in), Slayer is one of the main reasons why I login to the game. It's a big grind but I'm enjoying training my combat stats through slayer and also making some decent money. Just started playing about 2 months ago with a friend who has played OSRS way back then. He's power training through NMZ and whenever he's online he's in NMZ. 
---
Our stats were always near the same levels, 75 ish attack, 70 ish defense and 90+ strength. I've been at 92 strength for awhile now and about to hit 93 while he's at 94 about to hit 95 and I just wonder what he's going to be doing after he hits 99 strength and gets the stats he wants. His bank is broke since he's been only doing NMZ and I'm sitting at around 80 mill training through slayer and other things. It's also been pretty nice to be able to explore the runescape map through slayer and learn of all different kinds of monsters, bosses, and just being able to explore the massive PVM content while my veteran friend only knows about NMZ and PK'ing (which he is horrendous at and has lost millions already.)
---
In the 2.5 months that I've played, I've actually learned so much about runescape and other things because of Slayer that I'm telling my friends where to go to kill certain monsters or how to get to certain areas the fastest way. Guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm having a lot of fun on my journey to maxing and feel like slayer has been a good catalyst for this. I definitely don't regret doing slayer instead of power training in NMZ.
---
Do you only play rsps? Because then you have no say in what should or should not be added to the game
---
I'm neither for or against warding i simply don't care, i'm just not gonna do any warding if it is introduced, and i'm probably just gonna skip the vote tbh
---
Eh, I know it‚Äôs not necessary but I want to go in bis gear.
---
This is fucking retarded simply because the devs could've easily rigged poll results even when showing the numbers.
---
Isn't that why we're giving feedback now.
---
This doesnt go with the lore.  If you were to come up with an idea that came up with the lore maybe. But runecrafting already has its place in the lore.  
---
Its a decent idea just wouldn't be consistent. Love the suggestion haha
---
Let him listen to Sea Shanty 2 over and over again
---
Why can't they fix the website so it shows accurate results?
---
I agree. It always annoys me when people say ‚Äúthis community‚Äù is at fault but it can be applied to anything. Most Reddit and gaming community‚Äôs are the same. Lots of differing opinion and lots of contradicting because it‚Äôs just human nature.
---
Yeah that's not why people are downvoting, but you can keep telling yourself that.
---
Would have been perfect until "whats a warding lol"
---
The same thing could be asked as to why the meta should change?
---
This isn't League of Legends. It's a very unique grind-based MMO with grass-roots systems. It doesn't and shouldn't have these kind of changes without very, VERY careful consideration. We've seen first hand the impact of skills. We've RS3 to go on. Let me give you an example.
---
Summoning.
---
At first not too big of a deal. Cool concept. In the end? Every single PvM item was cut in half price wise and resources came into the game at disgusting rates. It turns out letting people have an extra inventory, or a healing unicorn or even just a pet that fights with them lets them last at difficult content forever. It also makes difficult content not that difficult. It even stepped on EXP rates of runecrafting.
---
What do we have with warding so far? Situational BiS boss armours that will step all over the current BiS mage gear. Massive buffs to mid and low level mage gear, despite the fact that magic pretty much already dominates in 1v1s pre-55-60 combat. Changes to BiS mage gear in F2P, which in itself hurts the PKing community. Especially (again) low level.
---
Then we've "battle wards" which seem to be able to be able to control/manipulate enemy AI or give you tons of sustain similar to old Summoning.
---
Why is situational BiS armour, AI manipulation and sustain during slayer/bosses coming from a skill that's supposed to be the equivalent of Smithing?
---
So... Metin 2?
---
Getting scammed is actually a good thing in the long run. It teaches use a valuable lesson about not trusting people on the internet. What better way to learn this than with some in-game items.

Fire cape has become incredibly easy thanks to the low price of brews and the blowpipe. Not sure what other expensive gear you're referring to, but a good number of low-skill players just buy bonds with IRL money to get better gear, and other players just play more efficiently at designated moneymakers.

yeah and if it failed your item could be destroyed for a nice item sink. would be fun haha

---
I mean yeah, the battlewards things are a bit strange, but they're not the finished product, still just as a concept, and I'm sure Jagex are willing to tweak/change that if it doesn't feel right. 
---
The imbue system going from NMZ, a boring minigame with little relevance to magic as a whole (which thank god they're wanting to change that), to being skill based with more options I'm totally for.
---
I don't see anything being necessarily OP or broken in terms of being too powerful, having better, varied, niche mage armour sets that incentivise people to use something other than Ahrims/Ancestral is always a plus in my book.

---
The way warding is presented is why I'm voting no.  I don't like battle wards, I don't like the armor sets being bis.  I do like the idea of the different staves/weapons and how to make it, but they're bundling up their good ideas with their garbage ideas, which makes it a bad skill.  I'd love to see a new skill in osrs, and I do miss the aspect of summoning of getting charm drops from various monsters, but warding in the state that it's in now is bad.
---
I did the diary at like high 80s with tent whip and BGS, rcb and diamond(e) you're more than fine.
---
It's not complicated, they just had to explain the whole skill and all its features and new items in one big blog, if you made a blog about farming and all its patches and locations and anima seeds and bluffs and compost and how the farming times work, etc, it gets complicated.
---
Basically, you get vis from either buying it or dissolving armor. You get silk by either buying it or farming it with silk worms. Combine the two, and you make armor. Not really that complicated, and the other features can be voted no (like the battle wards, they are unnecessary).
---
Oh God you mean you have to play the game with high levels to play high level content? Oh fuck oh no

I agree most of it is very solid and needed to fill gaps. but not in the form of a new skill. It's good to formulate your own opinions but you should be well informed of both sides of the argument. I'm not trying to pin you against a wall or anything but it's important people in general see both sides and understand what we are dealing with.
---
Meta stands for Most Efficient Technique Available, people often use it wrong but there is a point to it and it doesn't simply Refer to the state of a game.

Both or either depending on how they apply to the game.
---
I _want_ new content, what I don't want is new content that allows us to grief the playerbase on purpose outside of the Wilderness. Wild is Wild, anything goes in there IMO, outside of there though, there's a modicum of respect that I choose to watch. If the changes would negatively impact a sizeable portion of the community due to something as silly as poor coding, I'll vote against.
---
As for the skill itself, it _feels_ Like Runecrafting Lite. Most of what's offered feels more appropo under RCing and as a PVMer, it worries me. I _hated_ Summoning because it was the equivalent of training RC for Combat and it was REQUIRED because of how OP it was. I quit the game not long after.
---
Because
---
I agree with most of this, but I do think "crafting" skills such as Crafting, Smithing, Fletching, Runecrafting, Herblore, and even Cooking should be more useful to have at a high level. Having everything they make at high levels be tradeable and not profitable to make makes these skills practically useless to train (Smithing and Runecrafing being very profitable aside). 
---
The way I see it, a crafting skill should provide something that must be obtained by making them yourself, and this should not only extend to ironmen. RS3 accomplished this with Player Owned Ports, which introduced high leveled armor and weapons that weren't best in slot, but were still very good and better than Barrows gear. Scrimshaws I believe are a good addition as well, although I'd rather them stick to mostly skilling benefits to try to make gathering skills more profitable or better to train over influencing combat.
---
I have a big issue with devs being afraid to add armor obtained through Skilling or Quests that's better than Barrows. Barrows gear should provide unique bonuses that are situationally good, with other armors being available that provide other situational usefulness (i.e. Crystal Armor that gets boosted to be significantly better for defense than Barrows with high agility), or more general uses but aren't necessarily the best at anything besides providing strong defense than Barrows armor.   
---
TL;DR:  skills that make stuff need to give better high lv rewards that don't necessarily have to be BiS, but need to be very good, at least a bit better in certain ways to Barrows, otherwise the gear they give won't get used because why train x skill to 80-90 when I can just buy the stuff it makes on the GE or buy Barrows which is probably cheaper and better.
---
That's not how it works. 81 magic is good for a 38 with ovl and max gear. Max with 99 magic is 46.

I don't get it. It got a 87% yes vote.

This feels like a snarky comment because someone is salty they dont have a new skill yet. If we have to wait another year for a better, more fleshed out skill i truly believe that everyone would be much happier. I'm perfectly okay with most of this content being added to the game, just not in the form of a skill.

Personally I don‚Äôt like it. This is because I feel like the skill will just be another obsolete skill for creating gear. It will be better to just get gear from bossing or killing monsters. The other thing I believe is that Sailing, or even Artisan would have been a much better addition to the games skills. If they want to add in some ideas of warding they could just add them to a pre existing skill.

The important thing to remember is that **only the amount of brothers you kill effects your chance of barrows (single or multiple) pieces**.
---
&gt; The simple math
---
When you kill a brother, you get a chance at their drop table, as well as "adding" to a formula to roll for any (as in any which you have killed) barrows item. When you kill all 6, the chance is 1/102. Since you get 6 rolls (6 brothers killed), the rate is 1/17 (per chest).
---
It's late and I've been debating with a lot of other people on this thread, I'm kinda just over it. I'll vote yes because I'm a fan of the proposed ideas, you can vote no if you want to. That's all there is to it.
---
You see I have done a LOT of PVM and now I am more involved with PvP. 
---
Your trying to make things based on things you have seen and not don‚Äôt personally
---
The problem is the item sink. They want an item sink for basically every alchable slayer drop as well as all the stuff crafting and smithing shits out. That's why they are heavily pushing a new skill - to set up scaffolding for this big economic realignment. The mage combat gap, the nmz stuff, etc are almost secondary issues here and just sort of, not really "an excuse" but like some sort of gameplay deficit they can actually base their item sink around.
---
Personally I think they should take all this content, use it alongside some new stuff to revamp crafting/rcing/smithing/fletching, and come up with a new way to implement the item sink.
---
The problem with the items is that the only big item sink right now is alching, which causes massive gp inflation. And large sectors of the skilling economy are just dead. This way they can take all that junk and turn it into xp instead of money. 
---
I think they should just cave and do what other MMOs do, have something like a salvage kit that lets you salvage raw materials from junk. Not a 1:1 relationship or anything, it's usually less than what it cost you to make it. These raw mats could then be used for more xp in existing skills. And hell they could even solve the gp inflation problem with this too - just make the kits untradeable, buyable from an npc. And you've got yourself a gold sink.
---
Bless. Theres still so many more u dont know there are tiles on rs where u can drop things and become unable to pick up. He could have just got u with that one. As soon as u drop items, its over for u.
---
Go play RS3
---
you shut your dirty whore mouth
---
I'd rather afk it while I work and make go. It's a pretty easy 99 if/when I decide to wine tho, I know that. Also been farming vork and saving his grapes so thatll be a nice boost toward 99 on own.
---
Think it's only 16 hrs doing wines or something iirc
---
Do you mean 2013?
---
Agreed.
---
Sailing would‚Äôve been great if these stupid code monkeys put any actual thought into it
---
Yes, but arguably what you like about it is the boring parts. Personally, I enjoy four things about skilling; money, experience, and the ability to do absolutely anything else while I train it. 
---
Realistically, crafting skills are not engaging, many of them are unrewarding, and the more active you're required to be while training the more useless skills, the more aggravating it is. Basically the reason people hate runecrafting is only because it's the least AFKable crafting skill.
---
using the numbers the guy said in the vid 4-7m an hr you'd need to rev for \~40 hrs in 2 weeks *just to pay for the fee.* So if you were going to try and make money from this you're at a bare min doing revs as a part time job and probably have to do it as a full time job to make money lol.
---
meanwhile the pkers are picking their nose 80% of the time, ragging ez kills 19% of the time and doing what you paid em for 1% of the time
---
No I mean 2007, the back up used for osrs
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have this problem if you were a UIM btw.
---
Pleeease yes, dungeoneering quickly became my favorite skill when it first came out
---
Did I say constructive feedback doesn't exist?
---
When used in the context of training methods and techniques in OSRS(or any other game for that matter) it absolutely is an acronym for most efficient technique available.
---
I might post it right before they post weekly update to reddit tomorrow. Most people would be checking new for it i think and it would get more eyes on it. I want more people to look at the greater picture. It's going to be a meme with my ideas in the comments. I'll tag you in a comment.
---
what plugin?
---
6 months for me!
---
The players at the end are why I don't think Warding is as clearcut as some seem to think it is. If it were polled just to players who are discussing the Dev Blog right now it would probably fail. But after the Dev Blog gets revised and it is polled ingame, there will be a lot of players who just hear about it when the poll goes live and they may not be as opposed. Especially because they wouldn't have the stigmas of earlier versions and they'll be seeing the most refined version of all the concepts. It still very well may not pass, but it is hard to say which way it will go.
---
So, when overloaded your base level still counts?
---
under estimated achievement. Well done buddy. i'm 2 quests away (making friends with my arm &amp; a tale of hope)- All the best.
---
I'm gonna make a wild guess here. Those might be multiple different groups of people as opposed to one hivemind.
---
Devalues my Tears of Guthix RC only
---
It blows my mind that there are still people who will drop their expensive items on the ground.
---
I would agree, there is an inconsistency with the logic. I think thats because its more of an emotional attachment and emotions are a ways away from logical.  
---
Ive played since before the ge was brought into the game and so i can understand that. Because when they took the wilderness away I quit. I came back because im an runescape addict. but then left again with the eoc. I just couldnt make the jump. It changed the game way to much from when I started playing.    
---
So I think if anything as a community we need to come together and put together a sort of blacklist of things that need to stay the same that cant be changed in order to protect the integrity of the game. Kinda a "standard" that we are able to base every update on to see if it checks out or not.
---
Oh, I agree. I thought you were saying people getting ddos'd were the areas coming back with holes, and didn't need fixing.
---
Why is it crashing?
---
Me think, why waste time say lot word, when few word do trick
---
I mean adds more diversity to. I hate running backwards and forwards from altars or the abyss but having something to do as well as that giving the same xp would be great! 
---
Having armour to mix up how magic combat plays out sounds great
---
I wouldn't complain. As long as they use their brains and make it fun
---
This comment lacks so much foresight that I don't even know how to begin to respond
---
So you‚Äôre saying I should vote yes to see if it‚Äôs game breaking? Battle wards? That‚Äôs too op. Atomic that outclasses ancestral? That‚Äôs too op. Monsters that you can summon to help you? Too op. The training method isn‚Äôt simple, it‚Äôs very complicated.
---
Nah, don't tell him... they need to learn the hard way üòÇüòÖ
---
I‚Äôm fine with that as long as the proposed skill gets reworked into something coherent
---
You can call a backronym whatever you want, doesn't make it true.
---
" The reason the term gets used to refer to the best strategies in gaming is that the process by which the community discovers and refines them is a sort of 'metagame' - a second, larger game that surrounds the regular game. For example, the 'game' of Dark Souls is exploring locations, fighting enemies and finding loots. The 'metagame' is the process of specific builds becoming popular in PVP, specific strategies becoming more common and either embraced or reviled by different parts of the community. That sort of thing. It's a larger game surrounding and encompassing the regular game, hence a 'metagame'. "
---
But did you get an olmlet and tbow both on your 69th olm kill?

The whole rigging poll results is a meme/joke. No one takes it seriously.

Why is it surprising to you that you hear contradictory opinions on this sub? Is that not the point of a discussion? Subreddits are not unified minds that can only have one opinion, There are always people voicing their opinions on either side.

Combine Rune-crafting with Warding and name it Magikraft! A skill that creates all sorts of magical items from gear to runes and staffs
---
I like the idea of diversity but adding a whole new skill to do it doesn't seem like the best option
---
I'm a fan of the ideas being individually polled to be added to their corresponding skills. I'm going to make a huge post tomorrow outlining what i think they should do with this content. I can tag you if you want to see this side of the argument fleshed out.

The J-Mods have repeatedly said that on multiple Q&amp;As in the past. They've realised that adding imbues to a minigame that's already the best combat xp in the game and is fairly afk was a stupidly overpowered idea.

It's not so much contradictory opinions, I understand different people want different things. It just seems like there is no middle ground for discussion. Everything is way too black and white. "Either you want X content or you don't, and if your ideas don't align with mine? Fuck you, your opinion doesn't matter."
---
you take that back right now

It's funny how you keel selecting very specific things to respond to. Meta (greek word) is short for metagame. It's used in other context too, like metadata.

Idk if I like it cuz I‚Äôve never seen it in game ):

Before Warding, you could have probably said the same with just Artisan and Sailing. And in the future, you'll probably be saying it about those three plus a fourth new skill we're not thinking about now. There is a lot more that can be done with new skills than just those three things, even if some may overlap in some ways.
---
Check it out, this guy doesn‚Äôt know what a backronym is
---
Yep not a problem!  I find that up until early/mid 90s is where XP gets slower, so you dont have to power level up much past that (94 is useful for veng though).  You should be able to chin/burst mid 90s then let rigour+blowpipe gradually get you to upper 90s range!  you might be able to afford both rigour+leveling with the amount of cash you have

ü¶Ä  warding is actually just runecrafting magic and crafting updates that have needed to happen for years ü¶Ä
---
Working on it. I have 12 hard clue caskets
---
How can you be in-favour of artisan, but not warding? Artisan wasn't even a skill, it was a minigame. Warding is a proper skill with a purpose in mind, which makes it a great addition.
---
Prif was undefined content in both games and implementation is considerably different for osrs.
---
Chances of back to back nest falling from tree I beleive is 1/65k. I think.
---
How did Dung ruin pking?
---
But it is still new content instead of updating old content, which was your main argument. And it does come with a bunch of endgame content.
---
I'm pretty sure the people you sperg out at are going to continue to play the way they want, regardless of what you tell them. it's very likely that all of your melties and text walls aren't accomplishing anything
---
You say that like Warding has been polled
---
Its definitely uncommon but not extremely rare. Each log has a 1 in 256 chance of dropping a birds nest in addition. So each time you get a birds nest theres another 1 in 256 chance of another birds nest dropping directly afterwards.
---
The way probability works, the only thing that matters here is the second nest, since a single nest drop isnt an exceptionally rare occurance, so the odds of a second nest dropping after the first can be said to be 1 in 256 or 0.39%
---
A Kinship Skill?
---
I think you're confusing some memes and edge lords with the actual community.   
---
There are definitely people who are in the 'no changes' camp, because that is the nature of super nerds.   
---
But, just because those people exist that doesn't mean that the overwhelmingly negative response to warding is wrong.   
---
I feel like most people actually do want items rebalanced and fixed -- things like gmaul, black dhide, etc. So this is where I think you're confusing memes with reality. 
---
Warding is bad, in my opinion for a simple reason -- its new content instead of old broken content being fixed, which should be the pressing issue.
---
Oh no honey that's not possible, people in osrs never make jokes
---
Moving anything at all is grounds for voting no.  People's motivations don't need to match yours in order to be valid.
---
Just got my Barrows gloves, already have Fighter torso and Dragon defender, I think I should go for Fire cape next but im too poor to get a blowpipe. Whats a good way to get some gold so I can buy it? Or is there something else I should go for first?

you mean the item names, or what? that's runelite's "ground items" plugin, if you mean the options for showing alch and exchange prices those are in the plugin's settings

You need to download a third party client from runelite.net and it will be like that

Imagine clue hunting in the wildy when a whole calvary of mounted pkers come galloping at you

This is how the beginning of the end will start... This isn't old school by no means to add battle wards.. powercreep will begin now and change how the game is played entirely when it mysteriously passes the polls
---
Pretty sure my post was about not wanting warding to be added to the game.
---
I really don't like this way of thinking because you're making it seem like we have to vote yes to *any* new skill. I am not against new skills at all, I voted yes to artisan and would gladly vote yes to a skill I think would work. For some reason people seem to think that we should just vote yes purely on the fact that a new skill is coming, and not actually look into whether we like what's being proposed. A new skill would be cool to have, but in its current state I don't think warding would be a good fit for the game. People are making it seem like the question is "should osrs ever get a new skill" and not "should warding be added to the game". The former would be an interesting poll but isn't what's happening so I am not going to treat warding as if it were.

Fortnites updates sometimes aren‚Äôt what the community wants, and they listen to feedback and adjust accordingly, it‚Äôs not votes upon but they listen to community feedback and make things happen just osrs does. However, the problem with osrs and how the devs do things is it‚Äôs one game, it‚Äôs an MMO, if a new skill is added, there‚Äôs no getting rid of it. They‚Äôre not going to just get rid of it. Fortnite vaults things that don‚Äôt work or the community doesn‚Äôt like all the time. Or they try and fix it. Yes they make us play with whatever for some time but it‚Äôs not something that will last forever like a new skill will. 
---
That‚Äôs the problem in osrs. You vote on something or have something new enter the game and it‚Äôs staying, the only thing they will do is tweak it but it‚Äôll stay. If warding passes you have some new thing in the game that everyone realistically will have to do unless you make an ultimate fally locked 1 warding pure.... the difference in games is fortnite can take stuff out, osrs will only tweak things. 
---
The devs in osrs are going to push warding down your throat. Considering the fact I‚Äôve been having major urges to come back, I‚Äôm going to see what warding does in a poll and if it passes, there‚Äôs not a chance I‚Äôll be coming back even as a maxed main

This is so insanely stupid. They wouldn't have to include the fake votes in the count, so you still wouldn't know shit. There is no more risk of faking results now than before.
---
Dungeoneering was fun but seemed odd as a skill. Summoning was a lot of fun though, and has a lot of potential. 
---
Personally I think they should try going back the route of using the life rune for summoning - something about it feels more old school, whole still having the awesomeness that the skill offered.
---
Calling me an idiot and misspelling "once" in the same sentence. Don't ever change, Pooface.

Hey, your 3rd point already works. You can set attack options to right click and left click to run back and forth. I‚Äôve got around 1600 kc and did about half with this method. I prefer the right click walk here though to be honest. Point #4 I completely agree. It‚Äôs dumb af that I need to run back to the middle after 1 hit on a respirator. Point #2 I use a scythe on sire and more dps is always appreciated. IMO sire should be about 900-1k Xp per kill. Also let us dual wield blowpipes already JaGeX sessh.
---
They're moving the imbues over to Warding and then supposedly making you re-imbue them again.
---
However, that's the least concerning part of this proposed skill. As long as summoning lite and battle wards are attached to it, I'm voting no across the board on all of my accounts.
---
I only have a dragon crossbow, are dragon ruby bolts still worth? and do people bring ballistas to raids anymore? i saw in multiple guids to bring ballista for vasa/mutta but i dont see why
---
Lmao what are you 12?
---
What I am saying is there are far more interesting things that just bonus damage. You can make them stupid or crazy and then tame them back. 
---
Hell the effect could be if there are trees near by the give additional power to earth spells. 
---
Or a lava dripped staff makes your water spells into something different.

Or bird fucking Love you because your wearing there king as a hat so it makes them attack at your command or some shit like that
---
Base 70 (ignoring the fact that some skills like all combat, fletching, wcing, fm etc literally take a few days to get 99) is incredibly easy to achieve within a few months for someone with a life.
---
I've achieved way more than that with a 9-6 job and social life in under a year lol. And you're talking about 5-**10** years. Lol.
---
The main points that I take away from warding is this; 
---
The game needs an item sink to quell inflation (we knew this already)
---
There is currently no way to create magic armour in the way we can melee or range. 
---
Point number two COULD be a skill, but it would essentially be crafting for mage armour, which would make no sense. 
---
Point number one is a conundrum in and of itself, I do not think however that tying inflation reduction to a skill is the correct path. 
---
Divination in RS3 was a horrible skill, the perks were crap (I don't know how they've changed since) and the gathering of energy was more of a chore than an enjoyable experience.
---
Warding to me sounds exactly like divination, I've tried that, didn't like it so I'll be no voting warding too. 
---
I would MUCH PREFER to see old skills and content revamped than a game changing "skill" being added to the game. 
---
How about showing runecrafting some love and incorporating the crafting of magical armour into that? 
---
We have survived for 15 years without the ability to create magical armour pieces, I simply do not understand why it is only just now become a problem...
---
This would be cooler having it be an expansion to the skill since rc is shitty
---
Not too happy to have to grind level 70 to be able to continue using rings I already spent time making the money to buy and grind for nmz points to imbue. 
---
Imagine an ironman, they need to get to the point they can get archers ring as a drop, and have the requirement levels to attempt to get it, then go and get 60 warding for it. 
---
It just adds another layer of unnecessary grinding. Just add imbued rings to castle wars.
---
Voting no to warding won't stop imbues being moved else where, so yes, if you dislike imbues being moved out of NMZ, then tough, Jagex will do that at some point in the future without a poll. It is not a valid reasoning because it won't stop what you are opposed to.
---
Bloods is much more comfortable than other RC training, and so lots of people want to do it. Problem is getting there
---
use runelite there are a bunch of quality of life plugins
---
A backronym is still an acronym though.
---
no u
---
damnit why would you bring up such a divisive and politically charged topic
---
Then who would be warding? They won't make it best xp
---
Chaotic weapons
---
I highly doubt you can cover all the content that already exists in the game as a new player so why would adding even more be intently good?
---
Humble brag
---
Windows (Runelite, Facebook, etc) app notifications are always over my inventory. I have to close the notification before I can access the game. This has almost caused death at activities like Vorkath. 
---
Is there anyway (besides reassigning a primary monitor) that I can relocate these notifications?
---
I think people are dumb and don't understand half this stuff is for people playing inefficiently. Aggroing mobs / pulling mobs around does nothing for most players unless you're casually afk (and afk hurts exp rates) and the only time people use magic to kill stuff is usually Slayer in catacombs, where longevity isn't much of an issue. 
---
Conjuring is literally just trying to salvage as much as conceptually possible from the Arceeus spellbook. If they put it in there it'd be dead content and people would bitch and moan about it.
---
Literally read the last paragraph
---
I figured bones to peaches and infinity boots were cool, what else should i spend my early gp on?
---
It is a misconception because there is always 12 added to your RP if you kill all 6 brothers. More info on this if you go to the Wiki page.
---
You don't design something with the thought "this is going to be the meta". You tweak aspects of the games and the new result IS the meta.
---
At what point did I say I was for or against Warding? You seem pretty upset about something. Want to talk about it?
---
Good discussion.
---
Half of what you mentioned is completely insane speculation and entirely in your mind, and the other half is basic business practice and Jagex wanting to use their time efficiently.
---
Your first point: If they polled content with nothing to show for it, it would be badly received, so they develop parts to show for the polls. This is obvious to anyone with a little thought.
---
Your second point is the only correct and semi-reasonable one, since they do merge some polls that could be split easily and should be, but I highly doubt it's done for an agenda like you suggest.
---
Your third point: They do this because once they have spent a few weeks on developing some new content, they aren't going to abandon it the second it fails a poll, that would be ridiculous. The smart approach, and what they do, would be to modify it based on feedback given and propose one or two changed versions of the idea. If those too fail, or the idea fails by a large margin, they will then scrap the idea, as they clearly have done many times in the past (Sailing/artisan are relevant examples)
---
Your final point is the part that makes you out to be a blabbering fool. The community essentially harassed Jagex  non-stop to hide poll results so it is not something they wanted to do in the first place, and even then, they could have manipulated polls whether or not they were hidden, as nobody would be able to tell if they added a new 'yes' vote every 30 seconds. They have literally zero extra reason to, or incentive to, manipulate the poll results now than they did before. This point is why I mentioned tinfoil-hat, as both a little bit of critical thinking and basic trust would make your point seem ridiculous, as it is.
---
as many as it takes
---
I want warding so I can create magic armor, and I want to imbue things binding them to my character, so they can‚Äôt be sold, only destroyed, for a tiny tiny minor accuracy or strength boost.
---
Fuck everything else about it.
---
to me one of the most interesting aspects of runescape is that combat and pvm is based around such a simple combat system but has a lot of complexity due to how people have learned to utilize movement and other techniques - adding wards or some kind of AoE attack / buff you have to constantly maintain while PvMing to me adds a layer of unnecessary fluff onto a simple system where it isn't needed.
---
Triple Portuguese Breakfast
---
I vote NO to warding :)
---
Nieve or Konar i'm about hit be cb 85. Will nieve be too hard and what's the benefits of each one?
---
This, but warding sucks.
---
it would actually be kind of sick if you needed crafting and smithing for a couple of the armor sets. They could offer different bonuses for some solid hybrid armor. Hell yes, make a new medium lvl quest in the elemental workshop questline, probably fairly long in length and introduce the new items to runecrafting!
---
I can see it now, requirements like 20 runecraft, 20 smith, 20 crafting. Elemental beings like the ones found in the workshop have been acting strange and have been spotted communing with runestones around Gielinor. You have to investigate them, would fit in super well with osrs. Hits all the things I would want out of warding pretty well.
---
Yeah never mind you can keep em

what quests did you get 34 def with?

I hated Dungeoneering. Super boring.
---
That's extremely wrong lol. Even when Dungeoneering was just released people were pulling in close to 100k exp per hour (and it drastically increased the longer it was out)
---
50 hours of Dungeoneering is only averaging 40k exp per hour for 80, and that's low for extremely inefficient players
---
&gt;But why do we need to craft mage gear? 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Mage is a very low dps combat type unless you add in a bunch of stacking % damage
---
I just cant get you outta my dock ;3
---
MY NAME IS NOT BUDDY!
---
All votes passed, though. Skips aren't included in the vote, but still are included in the total percentage for whatever reason.
---
We have a dead necromancy spellbook that would love to be more than barrows teletab making and an impoverished man's 99 prayer. 
---
Summoning things could literally be part of arceuus spellbook, or better yet, just bring summoning into the damn game. People bitch about summoning but it was one of the most diverse and interesting additions into the game in years. Things could be a little overpowered like yak, but it was an ingenious money sink and skill buff that was easy to train alongside existing skills, without straight up ripping off existing skills like warding does.
---
Actually I‚Äôm doing everything, growing palms for Herblore, mahoganies take forever but worth the wait, xp goes so fast it‚Äôs like a level a day and Im at 86. I do grow magic trees too. And running herbs is decent xp too.

I‚Äôm sorry but a whole country is running the place. They‚Äôre targeting me and me solely and it‚Äôs harassment. Why am I the only one going in there and reporting this? What they‚Äôre doing is against the rules of runescape. I pay for this game and the content and should be able to play it sure with pkers but not every time I enter that particular area. It is legitimate harassment.
---
Content is broken relatively. If things in the game get stronger, but not so strong that it makes old content trivial, then we can start making new content balanced around the tools we have access to. Does pulling all of Arma GWD onto a ward make it easier? Yes. Does it make it so much easier that doing Arma is completely trivial? No. 
---
Things are going to get stronger as the game goes on, otherwise the playerbase who is endgame loses their sense of progression. Adding additional mechanics that will create more engaging and challenging content in the future is important for the game's longevity.
---
I really hope that becomes a thing. It would be a very OSRS way of adding summoning, and has interesting potential for interacting with other skills as well (eg you could animate clockwork constructs made with crafting).
---
People don't seem to realize how insanely game changing all the warding stuff is. New bis mage gear for raids and zulrah that will dramatically speed them up is enough by itself for me to vote no.
---
Why are you assuming the rewards would be the same, you're being naive.
---
Duradaddy it is
---
How do you plan to make in-game information available on how to Ward?
---
As a new player in the past month, I've really been enjoying myself but have been finding some of the newer skills opaque.  It was tough to find information on how to start Hunter, and I am stuck at 4 farming after my crop of potatoes died overnight.  Many of the comments and questions here focus on BIS items and end-game, but I know I'll probably never see that kind of content.
---
you're one of the morons yourself if you think they couldn't have already rigged polls before. they can put any fucking numbers they want up there and said "thems the results"
---
Isnt reddit the vocal minority of osrs anyways?
---
Except the Elven update passed with flying colors. People want good content, not to just add stuff to the game for the sake of change.
---
Aren‚Äôt konar tasks quite bad?
---
Yeah I know, I just don‚Äôt understand how it didn‚Äôt pass by a ton of votes, what‚Äôs the downside to knowing what type your weapon is?
---
I enjoy doing things that I know takes a lot of dedication. Call it snowflake if it makes you happy.
---
Getting 77 is no doubt the biggest struggle of the RC grind.
---
The spells are essentially zero cost and can be performed in zero time. Plus the spells are detailed to work on jewellery of certain gem types exclusively. The idea is to expand the concept of enchantment using more demanding ingredients and make it location-based like charging orbs is.
---
So you're assuming the rewards and impact would be the same? That's naive.

This guy posted yesterday, solid for setting up daily money makers early on.
---
Why not? You already use Magic to charge orbs which make Magic weapons, and armour like Splitbark is already enchanted by the guy in the Wizards' Tower. Why can't I learn how to enchant it like he does? Are you telling me the Armoured Wizard has been Warding this whole time?!

You're close to being half way, mate! Keep it up!

Thank you Kanye, very cool.

I should be done in about two weeks :)

No, dude. You‚Äôre probably meme‚Äôing, but 2007 is why I play this game. If I wanted a more complex mmorpg experience, there are literally a hundred other games I could play. I‚Äôm playing osrs on a $2,000 pc because of nastalgia. Is there a fan made game that exists that is purely 2007 with no buffs, nerfs, addons, or new skills? I‚Äôd pay 22.99 for it without question. Hate on me all you want, that‚Äôs the experience I want, and I‚Äôm willing to pay for it.
---
well you can "produce" it with clues, or buy it in a shop
---
dungeoneering is raids without the keys
---
It isn't a new skill doesn't fit in the game, Warding at a glance is too convoluted with its concept. They need to dial it back and release it as disenchanting and then slowly add stuff to it.
---
 I wouldn't be against a new magic related skill but there's no way I want Warding.
---
Imagine if they posted their backlog. I'm sure there are hundreds of things on that list that could be updated that would be better for the game than a new skill. But nope Jages wants a shiny new skill to entice new players. They could even work on a pvp update that they've ignored for years now. My guess is we won't see any pvp updates for the rest of this year.

I am portuguese and afraid to google that, tbh

It's standard protocol to always lie about your age anyways. I don't think I've once given my real age on the internet.

Lmao at people downvoting you as if your opinion is somehow less valid than all the people who just blidnly vote yes to every single piece of new content that gets polled. Maybe if you guys downvote him enough he will change his mind!
---
Yes, they even said in their RuneFest demo that the guy makes splitbark armour through an enchantment process comes from Warding.
---
Charging orbs only charges through specific elements.
---
No, it is you going into a pking hotspot and bitching about being pked. You are also now throwing casual racism into your tantrum. 
---
Being pked in a pk zone is not harassment. Play a different game without PvP involved if you feel this way. Oh wait, youd probably just say the AI is targeting with you and cry about that if you did.
---
Lmfao I know exactly what this guy is talking about. Too bad sissy, get over it. It's a tough world

Although I don‚Äôt play anymore.

I don‚Äôt think we need a new skill just for the sake of it.

"In the head" isn't a part of that quote.

In that case I really hope its no new skills

Why do u keep reposting these link; did u even read them lmao. Probably just a quick 5 minute google search skim.
---
Fucking poll it. We dare you to.
---
Doesn't matter. A new skill will never, ever pass. Doesn't matter how good of an idea it is, because it doesn't feel "old school". As if we don't already have shit like blowpipe, and bosses that get you over 2m/hr.
---
For me old school exists because no bullshit microtransactions.

I prefare they released NO new content yes. There's plenty in-game dead content that can be revived.

Did you even read them?

Can you list any skill that isn't buyable then?

Lmfao your a fuckin dishwasher.

Did 6 steps of a master clue on my Zerker, next step I need 78 slayer for, only at 60 since I was planning on doing all my quests/diaries before training up my combat (if I do combat first I‚Äôll never do the other stuff) so now I‚Äôm scrambling around trying to finish off torso, get Fire cape, rune defender, and some NMZ points to grind some slayer for likely best case a 200k drop, worst case my next step is to wield a god sword and I drop it. Either way I‚Äôm foolishly motivated to slay.
---
If warding passes with the changes expressed on the stream which would ultimately have a profound effect on the mechanics of combat, would you be open for the idea of polling "pre-warding servers" so we can escape before we have oldschool-rs3?
---
I'll dance if you vote no
---
All of them say why it is or list benifits, you illiterate fuck

This is fantastic! I'd love to see more iconic areas in this style.

Just have fun, explore and do quests imo
---
Yes the Reddit upvote/downvote system is not great, but every social media platform will have a hive-mind mentality regardless of a voting system. On 4chan, if you have a minority opinion, you are harassed, making you more likely to just leave the site. Not to say that minority opinions aren‚Äôt harassed on Reddit, because they still are. People on Facebook will just make groups or private groups that make echo chambers as well. Just a pick your poison type of situation.
---
You know the dogs they have on stream? They eat them. Im a cleaner in that building and I have to bury the carcass

No. You bad. warding bad. rs3 good

In other words it's basically invention from RS3 disguised as runecrafting.

I ain‚Äôt gonna‚Äô work on Percy‚Äôs farm no more

typical RS3 refugee here to ruin osrs as well. 'JAGEX knows best guys!'
---
yeah everyone is getting hung up on the name. Sure if we wanna go back in time to name it "runic imbuing" or something stupid, it would make more sense. But its called rune crafting, you are crafting with runes, you are imbuing runic energy onto blank essence. I just think the argument that its only for crafting runes is just people getting caught up in semantics.
---
Warding should be absorbed into runecrafting, it fits really well and wouldnt waste all that dev work if it doesn't pass
---
likesleague, I would argue it's the same amount of effort you put in at mlm even with an active role, it doesn't take a lot of time to fix things and then go back to mining. The difference being that you switch a lot more often in mlm than you do in vm.
---
just do oak dungeon doors or mahogany tables, quit being poor :~)
---
And while we're at it, please don't add fucking monoliths out of nowhere in iconic places.

Reuse existing assets such as rune altars
---
Finding a team when the content came out was cancer but I've never had problems finding competent teammates since the discord group for it came out. The money doesn't matter when you cut the time it takes to get 99 by like 150-200 hrs compared to MLM.
---
My issue is that it‚Äôs either going to be completely busted and be the new meta, and tasks like nechs and dust devils are now not the only bursting tasks. Instead you drop a ward and burst/barrage literally every task that is in multi. OR it‚Äôs going to be completely dead content and at that point why add it, it doesn‚Äôt seem like an integral part of the new skill and at best just promotes more afkscape, which good lord we know we don‚Äôt need more of.
---
Conjuring could be okay if they added that to the Arceuus spellbook imo, but it seems just like a summoning LITE and idk how I feel about that.
---
My numbers are assuming palms and a halfassed attempt at doing 2magic runs a day. And yes even new raiders can make 6m an hour and yes it will still always be better to do the better training metbods

rc is already ezscape with zmi and zeah rc

If you think battle wards are EoC, you have no idea what EoC did. Yes, it is a completely new aspect to OSRS combat, but no, it has no similarities to EoC whatsoever.

i genuinely believe polls should be open to 2k+ only. a bit like when only land owners could vote

You can also do 1t alternate when blob and mage or range are hitting you and you'll avoid all damage while taking no damage beyond the first blob hit.

Thanks for confirming what I had assumed.

It's a pretty spot on comparison. Artisan obviously wouldn't encompass all skills, like agility for example. Just like slayer doesn't encompass all combat skills,  like prayer. 
---
Also,  a direct counter to your argument "people will only train slayer or artisan" is the previous comment who also tried to argue his point-- he said he doesn't train slayer or even like it, he instead does nightmare zone and bossing to train combat. Similarly for artisan people like you or him would grind them out normally or do pve bossing like wintertodt.
---
Me thinks you don‚Äôt want to admit you didn‚Äôt read your source
---
i genuinely hope you're joking
---
Well the more times you kill the same boss, the less points you get per kill of that boss. Without the rfd ones in the mix the choice of bosses goes down quite a bit. Also, if the point are that low you‚Äôre probably missing the inadequacy and those other ones, I forgot their names. Like the unseeable or something like that. Those give the most

I would check it out on his yet channel bc I think it‚Äôs exactly what your talking about, but just in the full game

Summoning was the best skill added to the game.
---
That's the best picture of the king and deserves to be on a portrait. Someone with art skills higher than mine, please.
---
They have said it in multiple places that their goal is to add a new skill to the game that feels like it has been part of the game all along. Warding is an attempt to provide new content for specific areas of the game where there has been little to no content in the past. This also gives them the opportunity to provide updates and improvements to items and areas of the game that have needed it for some time. 
---
I believe part of the goal is to also help make small adjustments that can help stabilize the economy and potentially work on niche equipment improvements that don‚Äôt create excessive power creep.
---
What are your reasons for not having it? Most reasons I‚Äôve heard are the exact opposite of the complaints users had when they first proposed the skill.
---
There needs to be a middle ground for game growth and this proposed skill sounds like it can check off a lot of those boxes.
---
So farm watermelons and make compost with them? Or just sell them? And I have the Trollheim one but I cant do the next quest yet for the other patch
---
This looks impressive
---
I fail to see how the mind ward is even useful. Everyone that barrages can probably aggro the monsters faster via darts or they're getting exp in the MM caves. The death ward doesn't even really sound useful, maybe it gives a small boost to slayer exp/hr on barraging tasks.
---
not like you could if you wanted to haha
---
Runecrafting needs to be updated dont get me wrong..But creating magical Armour is a different skill than binding energy to stones.
---
below is a quote from the cannon lore about runecrafting. They are similar yes but are different skills.
---
"But these skills and powers were not the greatest discovery that we made. It was discovered that we could take these powers and magicks, and bind them into solid objects which we called rune stones, for each had been marked with the rune symbol of the Magick which we had bound into it.
---
These stones could then be given to someone who had not studied nor trained with our group - and the Magickal energies bound within them could be released at will."
---
https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-discovery-of-runes
---
Runecrafting has a very specific purpose and has been around since 2004. Thats why it hasnt changed much.
---
Because of that its the reason why its so cancer tho lol and why my Rc is only lvl 50.
---
Runecrafting needs more to it, but not warding.
---
why are you so unhappy :c
---
Gotta remember that this is specifically for mage, which reduces the viability of it for endgame bossing rather significantly. Furthermore it requires camping a 3 square box and costs inventory space, whereas summoning was a flat inventory increase.
---
I think people are really overestimating how good this is. For casual play it'd be huge, for efficiency-minded players it does little.
---
If you have a pet following you and roll a mining pet drop on the last ore filling up your inventory, you don't get the pet, right?
---
All I'm trying to say is that the word meta and the acronym Meta have different meanings.
---
Artisan was terrible as a concept. Sailing was purely a meme.
---
Could be a quest where you have to build (or help to build) a shelter for all the stray dogs. At the end of the quest the dogs would still be roaming around Varrock but they are now clean and flea-free, plus the "shoo away" option would be replaced by "pet". They would be happy that you petted them and walk away. How does that sound?
---
Commie brain short circuiting when confronted with facts

I spent most of my money on early mage training so I could get teleports, and save a ton of time.

You can also buy yourself some early combat gear, the Champions Guild sells Rune platelegs, Green D'hide, Rune Sword,

Sub-tables literally do not matter, because the resulting drop rate is a x/y fraction anyway.

Spectral and Arcane are 1/1,365, Ely is 1/4,095. End of story. If you get Spectral or Arcane, you didn't "miss" Ely, *you didn't get Ely*.

I did dps calcs on tbow the moment the stats were released, if you're not willing to do that you don't deserve the vote tbh

Considering I had to vote with membership along with 449k people to even make oldschool runescape come back; I pay, I say.  So, if I want to eat the cake and send it back to the chef, I will.
---
Just did it last night.  I was surprised someone didn't call the cops to check in on me from how loudly I yelled "NOOOOOOO!"
---
I think I can salvage.  Just go 93 HP instead of 94. Makes getting 99 range a little harder but what's OSRS without a challenge?
---
Oldschool exists because jagex directly and indirectly destroyed runescape. Like, fundamentally. Anyone who wishes to challenge this claim need only look at player activity in 2011/2012 to see that people were fleeing in droves due to power creep, EOC, and MTX. Rs3 is not the same game. There are arguments that it's a fairly decent game, but it is not the game it was. Comparing osrs and rs3 is like comparing rs2 and diablo 2.
---
And due to this, OSRS players who have played both games for years are justifiably hesitant to accept change, because jagex has had a horrible track record since the Gowers handed over the reigns.
---
Anyone who bitches about players just avoiding change as though there aren't completely legitimate reasons to do so is either a new player, or a moron.
---
You're doing the same thing though
---
Just decided to post this in case anyone cares/not on twitter. 
---
What‚Äôre your thoughts on Roq deciding to take on LMS, and on his free time? 
---
Personally I love the idea he‚Äôs going with, focusing on making LMS more tribrid/prayer switching focus, rather than prayer flicking focused. This seems like a cool new avenue for players to properly learn deep wild nhing as well. I just hope Roq deciding to do this on his own doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs because PvP is still gonna be on the back burner and delayed due to warding and other updates.
---
Because I had to grind rc
---
Spicy stew
---
Makes too much sense.
---
Fetching you make arrows and ranged armor. 
---
Smithing you make melee weapons and armor.
---
Runecrafting you make magic runes and NO Armour.
---
Plus if I start out with agility. I can go do agility pyramid and make 1mil to buy all of the runes Ill need for 70+ magic, all in the same amount of time it would take for me to get 30-40 runecrafting. Runecrafting is so unbelievably slow for the early levels its just such a useless skill. 
---
You know what would add incentive to having robe crafting added to runecrafting? If robes were craftable and tradable, BUT you also have the ability to enchant the robes, the enchant effect would degrade over time, but it would then make it useful to have high runecrafting even if you could just buy the armor from GE, you wouldnt get the full benefits without enchanting the robes as well.
---
ja

see you there!

Respecing as in getting back the experience you have and realocating it to other skills.

I see you've never played an mmo before.

---
What‚Äôs wild is you‚Äôve been off and on this subreddit for the past couple hours and still have this naive notion that there are no good points explain why battle wards are ‚Äúrs3, eoc dogshit‚Äù. Although I guess that makes sense because it‚Äôs clear you only care about defending your ass. If only deleting replies did such a thing.
---
I think warding could be utilized well in raiding, which is an extremely positive direction they‚Äôre taking the game.
---
Cool see you there! Unless I don't
---
I'm a hard NO for Warding.
---
This is really close to what real life sounds like.
---
15 years actually.
---
AE was literally correct about VM. its extremely op in its current state.
---
Complaining about complaining by complaining.
---
I'm not complaining about everything. I'm complaining about hypersensitive change-aphobe nostalgia freaks.
---
Runecrafting is fine. It doesn't need to be bloated with content that can go in an entirely new skill. Runecrafting isn't the end all be all of magic focused content.
---
Source?
---
2113 is half way if we count levels only. So I'd say you're pretty far still.
---
Negatory, the pet will go in your inventory, and one resource will be dropped to the floor to make space, so you good fam.
---
Exactly.
---
Do you think soloing could be done with all low 90s combat stats?
---
What raid bosses do you avoid because you're solo?
---
What the video game has a similar concept to your belittled bubble of a world?
---
Pls tell hm time left id love to come :)

I think a piece of leather would fit better tbh

K
---
So much this. Thank you. I‚Äôve been saying this all day. Jagex said they want to revive old and dead parts of the game. You literally have a skill already thematically around imbuing rocks into magical stones. Complete the skill by adding that ability to imbue robes into magical gear.
---
I wouldn't say that you're a pussy, but Damis is definitely the hardest boss, bring at least 12 prayer pots. He drains your prayer like a mofo, and it makes it that much harder.
---
Surely it should just be as easy as combining Magic, Runecrafting and Crafting Skills to make Magic Gear!?
---
Lmao.
---
Upvote for message, downvote for unironical shitty usage of Richard and Mortimer
---
That makes absolutely no sense
---
I'm sure there is a work around for this. If Runelite's plugins don't trigger a bot service of some kind than that's just crazy.
---
Wholesome

---
Runecrafting is at its core, the ability to imbue magic into physical items. This is represented by eternal boots, runes, tiaras, etc...
---
We are first introduced to the skill by rediscovering this magical ability. Would it not also make sense that along with the knowledge of how to imbue magic into ess being lost, so to was the ability to craft magical armor? This would logically explain why no one has had the ability to craft magical armor aside from a select few.
---
Warding would incorporate large magical monoliths to channel energy, Runecrafting already does this,
---
Warding would incorporate the ability to imbue magical essence into fabric. Runecrafting already does this.
---
Jagex wants to develop a new skill, almost everyone hates runecrafting currently.
---
Why not combine the two? If experience is an issue, simply cut it down to current or slightly better rates. This would give runecrafting more rewarding uses beyond simply crafting runes that most people just buy anyway.
---
EoC changed combat, regardless of the specifics it failed because people like combat the way it is, simple.
---
You say battle wards will add a new aspect e.g changing combat... That's exactly the problem. 
---
How can you not see the comparison.
---
Yeah, but even people who have done RC are asking for more viable methods of training (AFK or not). Adding in a single low tier RC method for people to get stat requirements for quests won‚Äôt change that much. It‚Äôs an issue if it becomes like NMZ and completely dominates the skill, but it won‚Äôt.
---
There was quite a celebration, memes and fun were had when it actually happened. 
---
Hint. It wasnt this week.
---
goblins or minotaurs are nice for them
---
Or maybe its 2 completely different groups with 2 completely different opinions on the suggestions.  The internet isn't composed of you and one massive hive mind, its you and millions of other people, all capable of having their own thoughts and liking/disliking different things.
---
Why can't they just give it trash rewards then...I like it a lot purely for the gameplay involved in it. Not everything that has to be efficiencyscape right
---
I agree I would love summoning even with bob/uni.  It was a great addition to hybrid pking.  Its not like pvm takes anyskill as it is now anyways and you could always bar it from inferno/raids.
---
Or just.. Dont add summoning? I mean Conjuring
---
Yeah, maybe if that cloth was a rune, and the energy was runic, then yes.
---
Woodcutting and fishing are the same! Combine them!

He addressed in a video that he never intended for it to be a truly stand alone account. He opted for a HCIM because of the hardcore, 1 life aspect, not the trade or player interaction aspect. 
---
If you wanted the series to be that way then make your own or pay attention before you cry about it
---
Please explain how you would tag warding to runecrafting.
---
All the new content would have to have dog shit exp rates or else the community would cry. Dog shit exp rates = dead content.
---
Them ice giants be savages
---
I did! by emailing them. because reddit is fuckin toxic and a great way to get your feedback buried by the echo chamber :)
---
\&gt;why did we need fletching when crafting already made ranged armor?
---
I don't know, I wasn't around back then. But if your argument is "well, this skill could fit well within existing skills, but may as well add a new skill because that's what we did in the past, despite it making no sense," then you have a shitty fuckin' argument.
---
I got you:
---
1) buy logs appropriate for your level
---
2) in your inventory, 4 logs, enough seeds for 4 houses (I use 20 wildblood seeds since I get a lot from contract farming, you can use others but you‚Äôll need 40) bring hammer and chisel
---
3) teleport to fossil island house and use mushrooms to teleport to option 2 the valley. There are two house spots there, dismantle old house build new one put in seeds.
---
4) use mushrooms to tele to option 4. Run north to house, then run directly south to swamp for final house.
---
5) literally the easiest money and hunter xp in game it takes 2 minutes a run tops
---
Until a certain post reached the front page. Then all of a sudden everyone was like "Yeah, what are you complaining about you homophobes!"   
---
Granted a lot of the time it's not the same people, but it's not exactly as if two completely different groups of people are consistently getting shit to the front page.
---
I wonder if they could make beta servers where the updates are released and get feedback based on players trying the skill rather than just reading about it and making assumptions?
---
Don't care voting no.
---
New additions can be added into the game without changing the fundamentals that made the game. New quests, skilling methods, bosses, areas is something that adds more onto an already thriving game to keep the customer satisfied.
---
I wouldnt like a new skill, not because it devalues what i already have achieved, but because it changes so much of the game that doesnt need to be changed. RC is a dead skill, why not match it with crafting to give those skills more depth, rather than make another mess of a skill?
---
RAT as in someone with malicious intent?
---
But my reply was to that commenter, I want him to explain why does he think those skills are bad, other than just saying it's from rs3 hurr durr.
---
&gt; We have survived for 15 years without the ability to create magical armour pieces, I simply do not understand why it is only just now become a problem...
---
Can you not say vapid things that can be applied to anything?
---
"We have survived for 15 years without a seed vault, I simply do not understand why it is only just now become a problem..."
---
"We have survived for 15 years without a farming guild, I simply do not understand why it is only just now become a problem..."
---
"We have survived for 15 years without raids, I simply do not understand why it is only just now become a problem..."
---
My thoughts exactly
---
What im concerned about is what we have in RS3, overcrowding.
---
The RS map is small and only thing that keeps the illusion of space is the draw distances. RS3 feels like a theme park because you have really jarring overcrowding of events and activity out in the game world.
---
Sounds like your picky and have unrealistic expectations.
---
There certainly is, but OSHD developers weren't willing to work with Jagex unlike Runelite developers.
---
Voting no on summoning 2
---
ngl I skip questions when I either don't understand the implications or haven't been swayed by the time I vote
---
Literally everything?
---
Just like how you can't burn adding a topping (e.g. meat, anchovies, pineapple) to a pizza, but it still gives cooking xp and has a cooking requirement.
---
True, I guess you could say those that are playing at max efficiency = dedicated to the game = stay subbed.
---
They don't have a script to do that automatically?  He has to be there and manually push the off button?
---
All magic on RuneScape is runic energy, so I dunno what you're getting at here. But that's completely beside the fact that we currently use RC to make inert silver tiaras into magical ones and dboots into prims through RC. RC literally already does what Warding is proposing to do.
---
It's not a rough first draft at this stage, it's a revised second draft with detailed community feedback already implemented. I don't honestly think they expect or even want all of it to pass, however. It feels like they selected the top 5-10 ideas from the survey and bundled them together for us to vote on. I think the skill is actually more likely to pass because of this, since those on the fence will be more willing to 'compromise' and just vote through the base skill concept.
---
This reads like someone who actually doesn't want warding and is trying to egg pvp'ers into voting no. 10D shit posting
---
They hotfixed the bug that stopped them from dropping. The previous dropping mobs should now be dropping them again. I can confirm gobbos do.
---
Because then it's DEAD CONTENT BEFORE RELEASE.
---
Jagex should just not listen to this reddit honestly, there will always be morons crying about something just force in a new skill watch people bitch about quitting and be back the next week.
---
Its a new skill not fucking disable free trading and removing the wildy
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄPOLLS ARE HIDDEN. THE PLAYERS ARE POWERLESS AGAINST THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WARDING.ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
;p
---
because the most common stakes are between people with identical stats, equipment (usually no equipment?), and no consumables. there is no skill involved, it is a 50-50 gamble. and just like a casino it the house (jagex) takes a cut.
---
So they just wouldn't release the code to them? Very strange, maybe they thought Jagex would steal it?
---
who chopping onions
---
Yeah I never understood the summoning hate. I loved the skill and think it did exactly what it was meant to, sink gold out of the economy and provide unique, interesting effects to the player.
---
Sub only, or sub incentive (IE, Subs get bonus entries) are against twitch's rules because it's against the law in California, counts as a paid raffle, which is a form of gambling.
---
Because the popular method is maxed combat and only a tenticle whip. It's basically 50/50 if you win or lose your stake. It's just gambling with your money.
---
&gt; Well look at RS3... That's why we have polls.
---
Which is why warding wont pass a poll. Ever
---
People hide behind this argument all the time to defend 2007scapes relentless flipflopping. While I admit that a lot of the contradictory views we see on this sub are likely coming from two different parties; Conflicting posts make it to the front page too consistently for there not to be a demographic that is constantly switching sides based solely on what's popular at the moment.
---
I hope that's true, because I would like this skill to pass. I don't believe adding parts of warding to other skills is a solution
---
My argument is that crafting is an old ass skill that is vaguely named and does too much because that's how the game was designed at the time. Then we had fletching added, construction added, etc., many things that could easily fit into the broad category of "crafting" if you want to be super pedantic about it. You're actually the one applying shitty pedantic arguments, I'm just pointing it out.
---
"max cape gatekeepers"?
---
Is that people like me who are close to max cape and adding another skill makes it unachievable this year?
---
Because yeah, that's me. Fuck your bullshit skill. Not everything needs to be a barrage task.
---
A new skill sounds great tho
---
I did and cant find anything. 
---

---
The keep going about it the wrong way. I know they want some substance to show us when proposing what the skill will look like. But when you have so many ideas up in the air, people latch on to ones they wouldnt like and it turns their 'maybe' into a 'no'
---
The polling process needs to be involved every step of the way. Jagex can take liberties here and there but there needs to be a community vote on: What would you like this skill to accomplish&gt;Which one of these methods do you prefer&gt;Which way would you like to accomplish A? B? C?
---
Im voting no because I think it better fits with runecrafting, and thats how I want to see this implemented.
---
Don't (Don't. Just don't.) = Do
---
If you eat at lunchtime you're eating lunch. If I eat lunch then fast until dinner, does that also make dinner breakfast?
---
what do you think gatekeeping means? i dont think it means what you think it means
---
Most unnecessary skill is slayer yet people love it.  This is by far one of the most effort put into a skill out of all of them.  I don't know what rose tinted window your looking through if you say this skill lacks effort and whats wrong with invention, it was great for the economy of rs3 and fixed item inflation.
---
Gave us up 
---
Let us down
---
Ran around
---
I‚Äôm not max, or anywhere near max, and I‚Äôm voting no.
---
Most aren‚Äôt opposed to a new skill, they‚Äôre opposed to a terribly designed and unbalanced skill.
---
If you‚Äôre voting yes just to spite these ‚ÄòMax cape gatekeepers‚Äô, then you‚Äôre a bellend and you don‚Äôt deserve a vote.
---
I missed the artisan poll, im so sad looking back and seeing what it could have been. My vote wouldn't have made a difference, but I would have loved that skill
---
Amen
---
I wouldn't rush it, the money can come naturally. And a blowpipe is only part of it. The supplies, scales and darts also up the cost. You may have to buy these multiple times if you don't get it on your first attempt.
---
Im almost maxed and im voting yes to warding. its noobs that botted there max cape or are poor and can't aford it.
---
They been doing this for a while now. I‚Äôve personally saw a handful of people fall for it all while telling them exactly what was gonna happen. You live and you learn.
---
ur like the 18 millionth person that fell for this LOL. its shocking how obvious it is yet u noobs keep falling for it
---
This was hilarious thanks
---
LMAO best reddit comment ever
---
It's part of the story of warding. It's how the jmods thought adding the skill into the game would take place.
---
Do you have a different suggestion as to how the skill should be discovered?
---
And most things will still pass whether you like it or not :)
---
Yeah not gonna happen how you‚Äôre envisioning... if you can‚Äôt recover it through their account recovery system, you aren‚Äôt getting that account back.
---
I'd be thrilled if the PvPers voted no. Enemy of my enemy...
---
Pretty much. But the same could be said for other existing skills. For example, Crafting and Fletching both work with wood, so you could argue that Construction should have been part of them rather than a standalone skill. The Armor portion of Warding could fit in Crafting as Tailoring, but Crafting does already do a lot and I wouldn't say it is wrong to consider it as its own Skill provided it can justify it.
---
A similar thing can be said for Archeology; it could be its own skill or it could be a Mining expansion with the difference being how fleshed out and in-depth the concept is. That is also why stuff like Sailing doesn't work well as a minigame; Sailing as a skill is far too big in scope and content to cram down into a minigame without cutting a bunch of the mechanics to simplify to something minigame size. So Warding could be an addon to Crafting, but that version of Warding wouldn't be as expansive as if it were its own thing.
---
With a hard R
---
I should look into what those do. That sounds helpful.
---
Lol failure to hide the 11 sharks in inventory - gf kid but your account is mine now.
---
Post suggestions, just dont do it! enjoy the dislikes.
---
These people don‚Äôt get banned is the point. I saw a guys pking for months with the name rigour niggour or something like that. No one is making fake screenshots of randoms saying racial slurs lmao. And if they come and say they pic was made up I‚Äôll believe them untill better proof is offered.
---
nty
---
This. Warding is supposed to fill the gap of how crafting relates to range and smithing relates to melee. If the battle spheres were to ever be added in the game (I don't think we need them) then I believe they would fit much better as a portion of runecrafting.
---
I can tag you in the post i make tomorrow to flesh out my ideas.  If you‚Äôre interested
---
why does wiki say 40, confusing :l ty for clarifying, calculated it aswell to 41 but had to ask to make sure
---
No, it's people with max capes who thinks that just because they struggled through the methods they trained with, everyone else has to as well.
---
There's literally no means of contacting them?
---
It my be a problem in the future, but I don't think that's an issue right now. Adding these monliths in could make the environment more appealing in some places and even bring more people to those places
---
No probably not, it'd probably need to be harder than olm for me to vote for it, so I wouldn't expect that til raids 3 or 4.
---
But thanks for assuming
---
Keep imbues at NMZ too
---
I think that the prayer restore for mage is fine. Like you won't save any gp by casting it but you can bring 1 less pray pot on a burst task maybe
---
ü¶ÄHOW DO YOU MISS BREAKFAST EVERY MONTHü¶Ä
---
Man, this post makes me embarrassed for you lol
---
they said they would add more total lv worlds lol..
---
I mean you definitely captured the best inbetween but for me personally I don‚Äôt like the idea of this skill being such a huge change to the way the games played
---
How much money are you willing to bet on that?
---
I don't call him god you guys are just weird.
---
Management 101: make people do what you want by making them think it was their great idea
---
Exactly!
---
On the contrary I plan to vote yes on warding but I'm afraid in its current state it wont pass, hopefully I'm wrong but it's too early to tell.
---
I like the non dps increasing wards
---
Ghrazi and Elder are both weaker than chaotic were at release. Blowpipe with rigour is already higher dps than chaotic rapier was.
---
Chaotic Rapier - 94 stab / 101 str

Ghrazi Rapier - 94 stab / 89 str

i use osbuddy to check my total bank sometimes, but i always feel like i have too much information to process properly and it just confuses me lol. i could probably get used to it, but frankly im too lazy and stockholmed by the default client to really try
---
The general consensus from polls given to the entire player base says they want a new skill... warding or not, a new skill will be added eventually.
---
I think if they remove battle wards, congure it will be fine.
---
Is there a way to get my account back to osrs? I have no interest in new runescape
---
Except make the EW3 of OSRS way different than the EW3 of RS3. I remember EW3 being straight up the worst thing I ever had to do on RuneScape.
---
redirected house teleports?
---
They said today on the stream that their mostly likely course of action now due to feedback was that anyone with the imbues will get to keep theirs as it is, but from the Warding release date onwards you'll have to make them through Warding.
---
I understood the idea, and it does make sense and would work, but some of the locations wouldnt work.
---
Oh I read that completely wrong before mb
---
&gt; I don't know what you're getting at. I quoted you and then riffed on that quote to demonstrate a point. None of that is contradictory.
---
If you literally can't remember your own arguments I guess it's a good thing you're giving up.
---
Once you hit all chaotics, there was nothing else
---
I recall the levels to hit your first chaotics was like 72ish then second 80-85ish and then around 90-99ish? But anyway yeah the final levels like 105-120 dung were pointless cause there was nothing new to unlock
---
i failed about 2 dozen times a couple months ago before i gave up, and a couple dozen more today trying to get it right. its super hard, but incredibly rewarding to get right
---
I'd vote yes on warding or better yet would be warding added as an update to Fm and RCing instead of a standalone skill
---
i didn't struggle i enjoyed the grind.
---
if you think skilling is a chore i would rather you quit.
---
Could you imagine being in mod ashes position? This game would be fucked if it were me lol. Thank God for that
---
how did i never know this!! Thank you!!
---
You forgot the other adjective.
---
I'm not trying to pose myself as some kind of a Samaritan that is "progressing" the community. I mean compared to the people I'm talking about, what I'm doing is productive. As in I'm not just complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
A lot of people did enjoy RS2, yes.
---
We only let well thought out ideas and quality content enter the game.
---
except there is about 50 pkers total in this game
---
Exactly. So making it it's own spellbook (Acreus) would be perfect. It doesn't need it's own skill to be added and implemented
---
They said it'd be based on new types of visage, so think 1/1000 droprates.

ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä THIS SUB POWERLESS AGAINST COMPLAINING ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä

People just want to be pedantic and eristic here.

There is no *real* concern for trying to be rational, because everyone believes that they are being rational.

Everyone here talks like continental philosophers arguing analytical concepts. It's exhausting to put in any real input because the knee jerk reaction on reddit is to do whatever is necessary to thwart the other person's legitimacy by finding the most influential hole in their statement.

Did they mention removing summoning lite and battle wards?
---
I like how certain aspects of summoning worked. I did not like that it was it's own skill.  Summoning should be added via the accreus spellbook.
---
See I want more skills like those. Warding feels like it could add a lot to the game, but if obtaining all the materials to do it starts turning into a buyable skill, itll just be a pain like crafting. Hunter has always been my favorite skill because of what you just described.
---
The subreddit /r/woosh (dunno the amount of o's) for people who don't get the joke.
---
It's honestly hard to tell satire here sometimes, osrs community can be fuckin loony.
---
That‚Äôs not true at all lmao
---
For all that hardwork he deserves his personal sandwich lady.
---
Interesting. Thank you
---
Honestly, it's incredibly stupid.
---
Like I can understand people not wanting warding, to me it just kinda seems like a stupid skill to begin and I have a feeling it's going to be absolutely HORRENDOUS to train, but they know it's going to be mostly useless without making it OP with the armor you can make so their fixated on attaching ring imbues to it so people HAVE TO train it to get their untradable imbues back.
---
Warding doesn't seem completely horrible but it's honestly like, 99% of the reason they're putting it in is they want to add a new skill and we got smithing/mining for melee as well as crafting/fletching for ranged, so let's just make something for magic! But no one wants a new crafting skill.
---
To be fair, I had just got off a 12 hour overnight shift and was cranky. I‚Äôm not completely opposed to some changes. That being said, I loved the experience of 07 scape. It just had something in its simplicity that seemed... complex? 
---
It was a game that almost anyone could understand, but had a deep complexity that if you worked hard enough you could be just that one step better than most everyone else. It really was a thing of beauty. As a 30+ year old I know things are never that simple, and with a game with a player base this diverse things get complicated. I just feel like this skill might be a bit too much towards what made me quit in the first place. Nothing good in my life cane after. Divorce, death, and endless tragedy followed rs3, so for me... it‚Äôs mostly nostalgia.
---
Yes they said all that would be polled individually, and whatever the community wants to axe or keep is fine.
---
I'm finna dipset

[Copy this dude for your diary kill](https://youtu.be/7iNlYh6BHX4)

I always found this mindset to be just straight up retarded. Being maxed is not the biggest deal in the world and losing the max cape isn't that big of a deal either. Sacrificing a max cape for more actual good content is a trade-off any maxed player would make. There's a shit ton of reasons to vote no to warding but acting like someone losing a max cape is a reason to ignore someone's opinion is retarded. 100% dumb fucking retarded.
---
Whether you like it or not, the majority of players want a new skill to be added. 
---
Eventually a new skill will be added regardless of if it's warding or some other skill.
---

I preferred to get the xp over marks, I always did the best xp rooftop course that I could. It was worth it for me as I rarely use graceful anyways.
---
The dedication shown by our Jmods, is something amazing. 
---
One idea for LMS is having stat increases in loot boxes. You have base level of 80 or so, with a chance for the individual player to instantly get 99 ranged/strength etc, to mix things up a bit. This encourages player to change tactics depending on the stats they recieve rather than searching for a specific meta - same could go for spellbooks.
---
Sounds absolutely awful. i hope they dont do this
---
The people who comment "Lol, complaining about complaining" are most likely the people this post is about
---
&gt; HIDE POLL RESULTS
---
also
---
&gt; Jagex is just gonna lie about poll results now that they're hidden
---
alching is an *item* sink. It removes items from the game, just like warding would. It is, however, a *gold* source as it adds gold to the game, which warding would not be. But conflating item sinks with gold sinks is wrong.
---
abby demons are bad in terms of xp but i do them every now and then for random whip drops, smoke devils best task in game and kalphites are pretty good too

This is a definition of "max cape gatekeepers" and doesn't necessarily represent how I feel about any of the skills. That said, you have to admit that some skills are tedious, and could do with some variety. i.e. If prayer got an update that made it more fun and interactive, you would be a "max cape gatekeeper" to vote no for the sake of people doing it the way you did.
---
Ahh gotcha, and yeah I understand, I should have put /s or something but it wouldn‚Äôt let me change the title, I made a comment like 15 minutes after I posted saying it was meant as a joke but oh well. You‚Äôre not the only one don‚Äôt worry haha

Does Recipe for Disaster really require 175 quest points to finish? I‚Äôve started the quest, freed 4/6 people, I have all the requirements to free the other two, and that just leaves the final fight. What exactly requires 175 quest points?
---
I remember having to ask someone how you get from Lumby to Varrock. Also one time I got lost and wandered into Falador and didn't want to leave because I was afraid I wouldn't find it again.
---
warding could bring rewards that are necessary to pk. Like how dungeoneering brought chaotics, that became another barrier for entry
---
Runescape is not a dating site
---
no
---
Shit, you right.
---
Pretty sure OSRS had a large influx of new players with mobile release didn't it?
---
I'm still undecided on how I will vote. If like to see the skill in action before deciding. Also I want them to load test wards being made in the GE. I don't really care one way or another though, I still have tons of untouched content to get to.
---
That's quite the leap of logic
---
i liked summoning but this warding shit is poopoo, i'd rather they actually add summoning but just dont have op shit like pack yak or unicorn
---
Read the main page post you 5 year old child
---
Sorry I missed it buddy, happy for you.
---
They said in the stream today they'll probably just let people keep the ones they already have, but after Warding is released you'll have to use that to make new ones.
---
Yeee
---
C‚Äômon my dude. We all know Ash is the king of ass.

 That man probably eats more booty on the daily than that one time your dad did 9 months before your b-day.

Thank you for your solidarity :\*(. But I  have to engage them. I am bent on using this as a platform for an actual discussion, and not just a meme!
---
All the upvoted posts against warding are shitty memes, barring two I've seen on the front page
---
Try it, it's a glorious moment when somebody trades you 100k for your milk
---
I did read the blog post. All they did was give us an idea of what they are considering without any stats or numbers. So how do you know without any numbers given that it's broken and overpowered?
---
This is my desk right nowüòµ
---
Louder for the people in the back
---
You don't throw out the baby with the bathwater
---
Show me a front page post that you think is edgy.
---
It's a shit idea in general, literally just a reward sink in rs3.
---
I mean it really isn't that much; especially since everything in the Robes except Arceuus Robes is existing content. Also, you'd expect something as big as a new skill to add more than just 12 robe sets. Granted, that is a lot of new Magic Armors, but it would be like if Crafting came out with only Leathers and not Jewelry, Glass, or such.
---
I find it MUCH easier on mobile. Set your shift function to 1 click drop, turn it on, start fishing, and just click once on each piece you wanna drop. It's easier on mobile because you don't have to drag a cursor to each item, just tap and drop
---
Nah. They need to clearly define what the Skill is before voting.
---
It was advertised as "Magic Smithing" as its core and the dev blog includes summoning. Until we get a clear idea of what the "core" actually is, they shouldn't poll it.
---
RS3 has this.
---
That makes sense tho. All the sailing based games have turned out like garbage do you really think jagex is gonna be the ones to pull it off
---
If I wasn't in the office currently, I'd have been there. Gz man.
---
Ya know as a new player I can confirm that the majority of the community acts like entitled jackasses. Warding could benefit new and older players and recycle loads of dead content.  But older "veteran" players are salty about new skills. Every new skill gets shot down the same way every time. Old school wont ever get a new skill because of this üò≠
---
because you essentially had to level it. If its optional and not overpowered I wouldnt mind it. I'd like to see the duration of the conjurs and their effects before I just say no altogether. But since they just gave us "will help in a variety of ways" guess I'm voting no...
---
Regardless of when or how long he did when he admitted autoclicking which is why they only temped him.
---
What is the scare of straight importing invention? Obviously shave the circle a little so it firs in the square hole of osrs but it seems way more streamlined than this convoluted proposal that is warding
---
Very good reasoning. If Warding comes out good and balanced and enjoyable and adds to the fun of the game - amazing.
---
But in reality the developers don‚Äôt have the resources to make a new skill properly. The community knows this, and hence it won‚Äôt pass.
---
It can only pass after the team regains the community‚Äôs trust. Which takes years of flawless and fun content to build. Not unrealistic, but from where we are now (meme-land), I estimate at least two years of updates with no bugs and no major content rebalancing before a change as big as a new skill can be on the table
---
Im trying to make gp by doing rc. Right now I am level 33 and have been doing mud runes. Its ok but I dont have 82 magic yet to imbue a talisman so I've had to buy a lot of them. Should I just spend the bank getting mage to 82 and then make money doing runecrafting? What is the best thing to do at this point for gp?
---
If you remove Hitpoints, would you just stop existing... Or would you be immortal?
---
this would really devalue my account :(
---
If it were to pass, that would mean that a majority of voters want it tho
---
It's stupid and arbitrary. There's no valid reasoning behind not wanting a new skill that can't be applied to any new addition to the game. If OSRS was still in a pure 2007 state it would be dead as fuck.
---
Gathering, Gathering (Marks of Grace, Pyramid Tops), and Combat.
---
You have Booger's signature. God Ash is #1

Check put clan soa
---
\&gt; I think what I'm doing is actually productive. 
---
Productive how? Do you think that anyone that's complaining on this sub is gonna look at this post and say "Holy shit, /r/ph1me thinks that I'm a **whiny manchild!** I better stop before he says something *really* mean and hurts my feelings even more!"
---
I thought your post was funny but now that I see you're actually trying to take yourself seriously with it, it definitely falls flat.
---
Pker will proably vote yes because that means it will be easier to get in 2k worlds. And yes I understand what you mean idk how the rest of these people don't..
---
I don't want warding because it will let too many people into the 2000 worlds. Maybe if they change 2000 world to 2080 or something.
---
Clues don't stack so they gotta solve to casket then go kill npcs for another. Quit over-exaggerating because you don't like 3rd party clients.
---
Ya nothing says edgy like crabs. Fuck off lol
---
Thematically a skill purposed for being the "smithing of magic" (despite there being all sorts of forms of creating magical gear through regular magic enchants and orb charging) it doesn't make much sense to tack on the idea of "regular armor sink" utility. It seems there for the sake of existing, and could easily be put into other skills.
---
(Firemaking + smelting = melting items back into bars, Crafting = taking armor apart similar to invention for pieces)
---
For instance if sailing were to become a thing, imagine to solve the issue of charter shops running out of valuable materials like seaweed, you could create and increase a private (perhaps discounted) stock to buy these supplies from by doing "cargo runs" on NPC ships.
---
THEMATICALLY that "bandaid to the game" fits with the idea of sailing. Sailing's prominence in the real world has a lot to do with access to precious foreign materials.
---
Item sink mechanics tied into "the new skill" *feels* like a shoehorn when it doesn't quite make sense. And since the new skill is a magical mguffin skill, it can get away with a lot of nonsense.
---
How is it cool, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense, the skill is all over the place. It doesn‚Äôt fit the game at all. I agree blowpipe is also silly for the amount it costs but just because that‚Äôs op why add warding. It‚Äôs a huge change to combat when they advertise it as crafting for magic armours. It is eoc level shit and is not needed in oldschool
---
Yeah, I've actually thought this for a while now, but I don't think they're doing it on purpose. 
---
Take the last Clue Scroll expansion for example. Jagex kinda pushed several controversial ideas, to which the community rightfully gave critical feedback Like on stacking Clue Scrolls. We ended up weird compromises like stackable caskets. I still don't get why that was necessary, but okay fine I guess...
---
I feel like a similar thing happened with the "X marks the spot" quest where Jagex moved Veos from Port Sarim to a new dock in Draynor Village. The community was upset about it ruining nostalgia, lack of information and the fact it was unpolled. Jagex offered a compromise by moving it to Port Sarim. However, instead of moving it to the old location they moved the Corsairs' ship from Port Sarim to a new unpolled dock in Rimmington. Barely anyone complained, but I'd bet they would if Jagex did that the first time.
---
Lol 3rd party software is 3rd party software.... NMZ is already afk. Full blown botting it is stupid. I just used my razer macro thing to set up a clicker for anytime I had to take a piss/get a drink or something. If you mad that's fine but I literally just openly admitted I got caught.
---
People who disagree with me are just too stupid to realize I know what's best for them.
---
But the skills are split into 4 categories: Combat, Gathering, Artisan, and Support. And you have to stretch it pretty far to call Agility a Gathering skill...
---
Yeah dude. Discussions are lame.
---
The only thing that Neive has over Duradel is a longer task list, so more variety. Otherwise Duradel &gt;
---
Diversity/originality.  It‚Äôs not very efficient, it‚Äôs pretty clear to say that 40/42/45 is better.  But at 35 def you also loose less money on death so that‚Äôs something to consider.  Oh and at 35 def, you can use mummy armor, which is great.
---
your character name was removed because of inactivity. You will have to choose a new one, old school runescape is not the same game as the runescape you played so accout migrations are not possible.
---
They basically said the whole things being thrown up and people will be able to pick and choose the components you do and dont like, akin to the ‚ÄúIf we add... would you want X‚Äù votes of the past.
---
Personally I think the battlewards are interesting but really suck as an idea and I hope they dont hurt warding on the whole
---
I will forever despise this community for letting something like TBP pass polls, especially so early in the game's life
---
This explains the tbow blunder
---
I loved having charms to collect. Half the reason I love this game is stockpiling supplies, but maybe I'm alone in that regard
---
Just play the damn game if you dont like grinding play a different game. Should of straight banned your ass.

Ok understandable
---
BDE
---
Exhibit A:
---
Unpopular opinion- I want slayer 2
---
Context, bud. I‚Äôm specifically criticizing one aspect of the mess. That‚Äôs another conversation if you‚Äôre talking about battle/conjuring wards.
---
No no, Zezima is a legend, Zezima is a god
---
out of curiosity, i calculated it out to quantify the difference. 2200/23 = 95.65. You'd need all skills at an average of level 95.65 to get into a 2200 world, a skill at 95.65 is about 9,367,002 xp. doing the same for 2250/24 = 93.75, eg 7,757,368 xp. 
---
multiplying the first xp amount by 23 and the second by 24 nets a total experience requirement of 215,441,046 for the first and 186,176,832 for the second. 
---
difference of 29m exp give or take, or 2.2 maxxed skills easier to get into a 2250 world, basically.
---
Stanley Yelnats is the stupidest name for a character I've ever heard. There I said it.
---
Except I haven't mentioned it at all, you're just pulling that out of your ass. Not to mention the fact that at the bottom of my page you see a comment made 29 days ago. Even if all I do is complain (which isn't even true lol) at least I'm not actually wasting much of my time on a website that's literally made for the exact opposite of a productive conversation, so you have fun with that shit.
---
Pro tip, sprinkle it with random bolded words so a JMod will 100% look at it.
---
Fairly easy, just unlock fossil island, the digsite pendant, and the three mush tree teleports.  It's fairly easy exp and decent cash, you can get 70 quick and low effort!
---
If you think the current iteration of OSRS is anything equivalent to 2007-era RS2 you're either willfully ignorant or dumb as a doorknob so pick your favorite. This game stopped being RS2 when Zulrah introduced the BP into the mix, and anything left after the inclusion of raids and Zeah is passing resemblance, nothing more. You say "the game is evolving into a different kind of rs3" but it already HAS evolved to RS3 in terms of combat. Did you know we have a polypore staff in OSRS? Trident. How about Hydrix jewelry? Zenyte. What about rocktails? Anglerfish.
---
No. You normie scum
---
Ring of wealth or that big book thing in poh
---
Are most maxed players against Warding because they don't want to skill again?
---
You look for a tilly bud?!
---
At least I'll finally be able to max an account
---
sounds right. its worth at least using 10% str pray tho
---
This isn't a single player game
---
I don't mind 3rd party clients, I just don't like they can solve clues and scout raids.
---
Also, you can get clues from implings. It's almost the same as having stackable clues.
---
I agree with what your saying. I'm just saying that for me the line is drawn at mtx. The other shit can be adjusted. Mtx kills it all for me.
---
armor sets arent notes
---
you wanna go ge lady&gt;item sets&gt;click your set or find it on list
---
Right click on GE and go to sets. You should be able to unpack the set in there
---
That's exactly what I used to bring and it was fine 90% of the time. Tbow definitely made it even faster though.
---
Alright I will attempt to give you every argument for and against.
---
Against:
---
Runescape doesn't need a new skill
---
It is an artisanal skill that will be potentially used in pvm
---
The current blog has suggested crazy craftable bis gear that will outclass current bis
---
Its overly complicated/trying to do too much
---
It will change nostalgic areas
---
It could be put into other skills
---
For:
---
It fits the old school design in an ideal way
---
It allows for new content based of warding in the future
---
It allows for the ability to bridge the gaps between mage gear
---
Some people want pvm to be changed up
---
Some people just want something new to train
---
Putting it into other skills would overcrowd those skills.
---
My own personal view:
---
I hate artisan skills (smithing, fletching, crafting). I hate buying (normal account) or gathering (ironman) supplies just to make 80000 garbage items (this is a little less annoying on an ironman since you will make useful potions and darts). I dislike when a skill is strictly time locked (farming) I think warding takes my least favorite aspects of skills and combines it into one. It takes the time locked aspect of farming and applies it to the supplies required then includes monotony of moving supplies to a location (runecrafting) and then makes a ton of garbage (artisan).
---
With all of that being said I probably will vote yes to most of it besides the pvm/summoning stuff. Just because I dislike aspects of a skill doesn't mean it shouldn't be added to the game. I personally feel like it does fill a gap and does fit with osrs overall game design even if I don't like the aspects that it fits with.
---
‚ôªÔ∏èüòç
---
Alot of us do, the servers are too unreliable to have the old death mechanics in place
---
You're such a free thinker broooo god damn wish I was you.
---
I think the majority arent blinded by nostalgia.
---
 We arent saying no to new content just no to warding.
---
The fact people think their vote matters on warding is funny. The resources put into this isnt going anywhere and will pass
---
For anyone who flames me for devaluing there 'insert meaningless video game accomplishment here'. I do realize what I did was wrong and will not cheat in anyway in the future. Just a cautionary post here. I feel like many people who are rightfully banned get on here to try and defend themselves to often. So I figured I would  do the opposite and do my best to enlighten some folks out there who may be doing what I am doing. If you have any questions ask away.
---
&gt;Blowpipe with rigour is already higher dps than chaotic rapier was.
---
And this is an issue, they need to nerf that thing already, choatics required you to grind out 80 dungeoneering levels are untradable, Elder maul you can buy or have to do end game content like Raids 1 same for Rapier. 
---
So are chaotic rewards that require you to grind 80 levels and break after a while really the issue compare to a 4 mill blowpipe that outpreforms prettymuch any other weapon.
---
The fact they dont get "representation" doesnt apply to a random online MMO. There is no reason to have it in the game
---
Engineering would be to similar to Invention.
---
Those people also wear tin foil hats
---
&gt; Removing Wintertodt
---
At what point did I mention Wintertodt? Multiple spells in the spell book revolve around generating fire in some sort of capacity. Wintertodt could very easily live on without firemaking.
---
Anything else you think of?
---
Well as long as you like it and don't take it seriously it's not edgy (the point of going over your head so far)
---
This takes some serious dedication. What do you do with the account now? Now that you can't train any skills
---
Imagine just spitting out what you saw on this subreddit 100 times. It isn‚Äôt true and you know it. Think of the raids, bossing and quests that are new to the game that have been super well received and loved. You‚Äôre wrong
---
nope; that's just another step closer to RS3-shit EZscape 
---
/s
---
STOP LISTENING TO STREAMERS! THEY'RE NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITY.
---
As the other guy said it isn‚Äôt that much, but the reason why is simple. When they proposed it with the amount you‚Äôre suggesting, it was laughed at for being ‚Äòboring‚Äô
---
Fuck anyone who calls you a noob. I'm psyched any time I see people excited about getting into the game
---
I hate you but when you‚Äôre right you‚Äôre right
---
I pretty much agree with this guy 100%
---
Not all keyboards have this feature so test it out first.
---
Yer just a git cunt mate who doesn't like anything. I enjoyed everything you whined about like a little girl. Revs, Konar, MA2, Zeah, etc. 
---
I suggest pulling the ship mast that you appear to have in your ass out of it.
---
World of Warcraft has a profession called Enchanting which is both basically ring imbuing and disenchanting (dissolving). I know they're not the same game, but in terms of fantasy they really are. I don't know why this retard doesn't think that a skill like Warding doesn't fit breaking down items into magical essence is thematically fitting.
---
That's simply not always true, and shouldn't be used to qualify and justify someone's answer over another.
---
&gt;[insert online community here] is one person
---
Easily my favourite meme
---
Tbh i would rather rework summoning then have conjuring.  I like warding as a whole but with warding/battle wards the skill is trying to be to many things.  It really should just be making robes and small  magical upgrades to items.
---
Well to be fair I doubt the blood altar used in warding is usable for runecrafting as nonsensical as that sounds.
---
Access to extremes
---
&gt; a whole new skill that will interact with many other skills in the game is just too much of a change to the fundamentals of OldSchool, and that's something I'm really just not looking for
---
That's what makes it the perfect skill though (imo), linking in with existing skills is how every other skill works. Something like sailing will just feel like a sidegame that doesn't properly link into the existing game.
---
whats so bad about it being a skill? The devs already tried dungeoonering as a minigame and look what a circlejerk it became for maxed players with 100m gears
---
Construction as well. However, more is more better
---
Gauntlet
---
Better vote no on a whole skill because the combat might get more complicated than click and watch
---
Yes! thank you so much for your help, I remember this!
---
Thanks for the account sweaty
---
I imagine the majority of people vote within the first day, and then the poll is decided or won't have much impact after that. If it was 6 days, the last two wouldn't be significant enough to justify it
---
Reported. You wrote it. He got it pmed to him. 
---
Clearly using your logic you're 1.73x more guilty than him.
---
What‚Äôs the sword comparable to cls?
---
Gratz, glad you enjoy the game
---
Eyy dude I'm a nerd, no hate. And if the intense knee-jerk reactions we're seeing don't resonate with how people react around here, most notably a controversial event that happened in 2017, then curse me for bringing it up?
---
Semantics. Items and money are the same to the economy; just in a different pixelated form.
---
Why is all of your counter arguments well this is better and that is better. It doesn‚Äôt fit oldschool and the things they‚Äôve proposed with battlewarding may sound ‚Äòcool‚Äô to you but sounds out of place and a big meta change and will effect combat which I don‚Äôt want to see not to mention all the other things that will come after it. I mean killing a monster and it damages other monsters around it? That‚Äôs a huge change which I‚Äôm not a fan of and is nothing like oldschools ever seen and the rest of them are a similar story. It‚Äôs not about things being better xp per hour it‚Äôs about changing fundamentals in which the games played and I like how it is now. I don‚Äôt ever want to see passive buffs from something you can put on the ground. Combat is strong enough as it and has nice simplicity to it which people love and I don‚Äôt want to see this change.
---
Put Slayer back in the mix and I think you've got it.
---
What changes in OSRS did some OSRS players over for?
---
Mod Acorn mentioned in May.
---
Yeah but that's extra clicks for doing the reanimation
---
I understand that's why lots of people like it, but that's also why lots of people won't like it.  It changes too much, whereas I'd rather just have more things added in like the farming guild, which keeps the fundamentals but adds more interesting ways to interact with the content.
---
Holy shit, you're so fucking cool, man. You don't care about anything, that's fucking amazing. You can come fuck my wife and sister, you're just that cool. Holy shit, man, you're the shit.
---
Scythe passed.
---
It could great you know! It's all here... in Mod Ash's head. And Warding will help you on your way to maxing! No doubt about that...
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Listen I can see how smoking can be an issue for some people, it smells bad to non smokers, the smell sticks to everything and smoke in general isn‚Äôt good for you. Vaping smells like some fruit or candy, not really an offensive smell, and it‚Äôs pretty much vegetable oil and flavoring. The smell and vapor sticks around a few seconds and is gone. I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue had it been on a ballot separately but they knew it would never pass like that.
---
Never once said I wasn't complaining. I outright admitted from the beginning. And I'm not complaining that people complain, I'm complaining about the kinds of things they're complaining about.
---
Clients can still track votes if they want...
---
I‚Äôm almost 2.2k total and I really like the idea of warding and hope it passes. Not as is, but the idea in general is great, some shit should be removed from it, some rebalanced. But yeah, looks amazing. I‚Äôd LOVE to not be forced to do NMZ...
---
All BIS gear is buyable with irl $$ through bonds.
---
I think artisan is the best of the 3 personally. I'm gonna probably skip voting for warding because I'm really not sure
---
Then I don't want to train warding to make skilling efficient in some way
---
That was my big issue with summoning; it seeped into everything and de-simplified a lot. More dynamic and complex for the sake of it isn't always better.
---
Battlewards would just be another click and more items to take while doing PvM how is that making it more complicated?
---
True and untrue.
---
This game as a whole is one of the biggest grindfests any gamer will come across. 90% (Conservative estimate) of gameplay is click something, wait for it to be over, then click it again. Repeat ad nauseum.
---
If you're a person that can't stand mindless grinding, I can't see how you can get past much more than the first handful of quests you ever do.
---
Sure, you can like and dislike different parts of the game... But if another mindless grind is something you would qualify as disliking, then you essentially dislike the vast majority of the game. In which case, you should reevaluate the kinds of games you play. RuneScape just may not be the one for you.
---
I get it! The osrs pker is holding the osrs pvmer at gun point in reference to the osrs pker casting his vote into the poll booth which is for voting on all content into the game. SO since pvmers vote no to all pvp update, except rev caves because they suck at making money. The pker will be... voting... no.. to.. wait noone wants warding... that means the osrs pker would be helping out the pvmer? Nvm I don't get it anymore. To confusing for me. Meme -10/10
---
ü¶Äü¶Ähidden poll results result in jagex adding what they wantü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Yeah thats pretty much the jist of it haha.   I read something a while back about if the majority of the skills we currently have were polled most of them would fail.
---
Like i said i'm not against a new skill, i just don't ever see it happening sadly.
---
EoC??
---
Add me (YaraGrayjoy) and I'll get you an os bond so you can live the good life while you save for a full month. Solid work!
---
I hate it because I also got that feel. I don't usually complain about ezscape, but Summoning really felt like that. One problem with that is that even if you choose to ignore such content, new content eventually gets released and balanced with that in mind, so you can't really disregard such things.
---
Yea, you can't draw any conclusions from this poll. Especially because it obviously had more hype as it was the first hidden poll.
---
Actually i'd say that 56k votes isn't a good sign at all and that hiding the results won't increase participation rates long term. For reference the clue scroll poll 1 month ago had 46k votes, so this poll only got 10k more even with all the buzz around it.
---
If you want the bank pin as well, notice that his ring of dueling has at most 6 charges
---
You do realize Wojacks aren't an OSRS thing right? Same with crabs? So when spergs see these memes on other reddits they actually think they're special.
---
&gt;  In the end? Every single PvM item was cut in half price wise and resources came into the game at disgusting rates. It turns out letting people have an extra inventory, or a healing unicorn or even just a pet that fights with them lets them last at difficult content forever. It also makes difficult content not that difficult.
---
Jagex balanced future bosses around Summoning so it's not a problem.
---
Oh yeah when it comes to tying it that's bs, it's just the issue in general I was talking about.
---
[best example i could find] (https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6ficya/loot_from_10_minutes_of_the_antigay_pride_rally/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
it definitely happened, comments like these may have been ironic but people were extremely upset about the whole thing
---
Damn I thought I was old with the X cape
---
No, they removed it. Just the 3 now :)
---
its the exact same thing but without a skill level to track how much of it youve done
---
which honestly was garbage design anyway
---
He‚Äôs not even a developer so there is 0 chance he would choose/be allowed to work on the core gameplay that underlies pvp. I think this is a great thing for him to be working on in his free time because there is not much risk of anything going wrong and it addresses at least one aspect of pvp that people complain about, which is that there is currently no good place to practice without actually having to build an account and risk.
---
Lol!!!!!!!!!!! U got em! DAE think FoRkNiFe is 4 KIDS????? **R3al** gamers play *osrs* üò©üò©üò©

Lol.

Sent you a PM that will maybe change your mind.
---
That's not hard bro. I just gotta commit the rest of my life to tears of guthix.
---
With prayer gwd, wildy bosses, zulrah, mole, kraken, raids 1, etc. 
---
Basically anything that doesn't require a spear(corp) or defense quest to access(vork/demonics/tob).
---
From what I've seen this is the general consensus if Dungeoneering was added
---
Niche memes are the best memes
---
Add a right click option for a menu to select which one to use by left clicking
---
That'd be $11
---
Thank you. I don't get why people making this suggestion that crafting magical gear should be under RUNEcrafting.
---
They removed yellow beads it's just the three now
---
So from what i gather Mod Ash is basically oldschools version of Mod Shauny?
---
They could also just add the skill without polling it then poll the ‚Äúqol changes‚Äù and be like ‚Äúwell if you vote no the skill is still in the game but it‚Äôs going to be garbage to level‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if they would do that but it‚Äôs a possibility.
---
Ooh wiki hasn‚Äôt updated maybe I should have started the quest first üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 1-21 range doing this LOOOOOOL
---
I too do things by doing them.
---
Based. You know there are too many youngsters when people are saying they want summoning and dungeoneering because that was when they started playing in the dark ages of rs2.
---
Yes thanks.
---
Don't worry too much about that, straight lines and rigid shapes are boring.
---
nah, veterans have been through some dumb ass shit from Jagex and deserve a lot of respect when it comes to their opinions on updates introduced into the game. Respect your veterans. We've continued to play this game when they ruined it with no trade, EOC, MTX, Broken recovery system, and countless other oopsies from Jagex.
---
The reason this game exists are because of the veterans, and the reason it is still alive is because of the veterans sharing their experiences with the mostly nooby dev team.
---
You aren‚Äôt obligated. Look how many people aren‚Äôt obligated to do runecrafting because they don‚Äôt like it. If you don‚Äôt like the skill, don‚Äôt do it. However just by design it‚Äôs going to be a fairly quick to level skill anyways.
---
I mean yeah you'll be able to boost to 99 that way, but there isn't really anything useful to build after 84 (+8) unless you want a complete POH.
---
I agree that a lot of the combat meta altering stuff is too much and I hope they trim a lot of it. But the idea of the skill itself just seems so great to me, with how it actually links into the game properly. 
---
I think there's a happy medium with making new better stuff (more than just bis like currently, or no bis at all) that make the skill more than just a skill for the sake of it. But if you hate the idea of a new skill at all then I guess there's no middleground.
---
I'm interested in seeing how the design changes with community input.
---
Buy vis, buy materials, craft it.
---
Get materials from splashing or disenchantment. Not complex mate
---
That's hilarious, wtf.
---
A new skill is a bigger change than pvm updates though. You can say a new skill won‚Äôt change nostalgia but at a certain point changing the game too much will lose that nostalgia. You can‚Äôt just take rs3, remove eoc and put back 07 graphics and say it‚Äôs the same as old school because all the updates have made it an entirely different game.
---
I feel like lms is a waste of time.
---
Ghrazi Rapier, kinda?  CLS never had that high DPS, Rapier was always the way to go.
---
Been playing since classic and I still dont understand what a veteran player is, some gay boi nerd shit
---
How do you guys go about playing two accounts at once on the same computer?
---
I've tried it by opening up two runelite clients, but its not a good experience.
---
magic armour with 50% melee damage absorption ability btw... possibly the worst idea ever proposed by jagex + many other horrible ones in the same post.
---
first comment in my life but I support conjuring with my everything bring conjuring to osrs sounds awesome however might be an idea to link it to a spell book.
---
Just... Stop, dude....
---
I'm 8 skills away from maxing after working on my account since osrs release and being dedicated towards maxing, using just about every second of my free time for the past year+. Warding makes me panic, thinking I might have to add another 200+ hours to the grind.
---
1 atk, 69 str, 99 def, 43 prayer (for protection obviously), 1 range, 1 mage

If you think this man has any say in how polls are handled you're sadly misinformed :(
---
i don‚Äôt disagree with that.. i was just chiming in to say ur 70K figure was wrong bc you can get 180K
---
i‚Äôm not sure why it got straw manned into what the methods were 15 years ago
---
The one thing Arceuus is missing is combat spells. Use ensouled heads to reanimate allies
---
I like using my cannon at Moss Giants. Snapdragon and Ranarr seeds are pretty nice.
---
You should've skipped your deep target and kept focusing on ones at edge bank.  That's the whole point of a skip.
---
There's the math. Good stuff
---
I think this would actually be a good change,for people using bh properly they would only have to hop the ditch to skip a target
---
Yuck no thanks keep that trash away
---
I know it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion but I absolutely loved everything about dungeoneering. Don‚Äôt think I have a single complaint about it, would love to see it return!
---
Actors talking about politics is like following a doctor talking abour agriculture.
---
Settled talking about RuneScape = an actual relation between the 2.
---
"How many times do you want me to tell you that?" Keep your cool mate, no need to get demeaning.
---
Another  stupid post. There is literally no need for a new skill right now there is so much content and content that needs fixed and upgraded ? Like holy shit lmao
---
Think the cash per hour is pretty good at higher levels mate, you'd be making a lot of runes
---
It would still be dictated by combat stats because there are other quests with required stats, the new lowest would be 71 or so
---
This is what I hate about RS3. They keep adding new skills which I'm sure makes people who've already beaten the game happy, but it just adds so much extra work for the majority who haven't. Same thing with 120s. Not only that, but DG is pretty much a forced multiplayer skill since solo XP is so much worse. Solo XP rates were buffed because lots of players complained and they also removed the XP nerf for F2P above 90 combat. It's still pretty annoying because DG is impossible to AFK even when leeching.
---
What OSRS devs should've done instead is fix all of the balancing issues like smithing rune requiring 90+. RS3's mining and smithing rework has been one of the best updates in years. 50 smithing lets you make t50 armor and 90 smithing lets you make t90 armor, just the way it should be.
---
Blurite sword is dope. I remember using that and the sword from the demon slayer quest just because they looked rad.

divination gave you sign of fucking life, what do you mean not meta changing ?

Must be racism. Looks like I‚Äôm not voting for jagex in 2020
---
On two separate occasions today, I've tried to log in to the game after having been offline for an extended period of time, and I've gotten the message of too many login attempts. Is this a bug on the current patch or is someone trying to hack me? I can't even log on to the main website without being blocked from logging in. Is there a way I can contact a Jmod about this?
---
It just gets to me maaan.
---
then why not make your **Discussion** post a text post?
---
This make a lot of sense.... they want more voters but keep reducing the time to get our votes in
---
when u had to go on the website to look at the map lmao
---
Whoa only 868 points per item? I see people with thousands of points during raids, they gotta be making bank loot!
---
Preach!
---
This guy is saying leak with no proof? Imagine if you changed konduit to runelite in his tweets, he has no proof.
---
Either way your a fucking idiot
---
No it wasn‚Äôt, if you were on here during the time, hundreds of people were genuinely fuming there was a gay pride event
---
Cause the alternative is your player model being 1 frozen frame when stood still
---
Why
---
True. He is pretty irrelevant now. And even when he was semi-relevant all of his opinions were elitist and biased, never was a credible source imo as far as opinions go. His skilling efficiency and videos were atleast good and informative though to be fair.
---
I'm not asking you to find an overlap of upvotes. A single example of a person who has posted twice on this subreddit with those contradictory opinions.
---
It‚Äôs been voted on in the **past**... so one snap shot in time = OSRS community forever. Unless the skill offers a lot of useful, relevant content (which jagex has historically failed to do in the past) I suspect it will be a flop or will get voted down all together.
---
I don‚Äôt really think you understood the question. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhy are there idle animations,‚Äù it was ‚Äúwhy do models behave in this way when idling?‚Äù
---
The issue is that they shouldn't have "more work" to do.... they should be investing more time in the same amount of updates we've received for the last 6 years... more updates / month is BAD NEWS, take a look at the update schedule for RS2 and you'll see when updates start flying in, the garbage content comes with it
---
Because I wasn't sure what method you meant and then you confirmed it was runners and I made the point that they've always existed in game as an option, technically you could have runners at lavas for example and do it quicker than running yourself. But ehp often takes into account viability as well.
---
Relax a bit and just have a conversation. That's all I was doing.
---
Experience yes, but that doesn't equate to knowledge about core pillars of game development. You're conflating two concepts.
---
Bro how is that a source
---
Did you finish it?  It gives you a fake quest complete message, then you need to go to the butler's room and find out he was the one who did it or something
---
Oh come one that was good
---
üòÇ
---
I think this particular still will be voted down but the community asked for a new skill
---
Who in the fuck is making the ‚Äúnew=bad‚Äù argument here? Are you okay dude?
---
Let me stop you right there, and ask: Do you honestly think it would be impossible for me to find one instance of a person posting contradictory opinions?
---
I think you could make a very similar argument for Prayer. I think it is premature to say you don't like something without trying it.
---
yeah you're right kids should start working at 9 like in china
---
The fat xp gains were the only reason i botted i mean trained it
---
That‚Äôs pretty much all of Reddit.
---
Lots of times devs and managers have to be present during maintenance or other important things. I have to keep an eye on our pages and servers every quarterly earnings report. It's literally come in at 5am and do nothing.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs all really quite stupid to be honest. The internet, for all its wonders, is definitely not healthy for society.
---
Is there anything stopping you from voting the base skill in but voting the meta shifting aspects out? They want to get the skill balanced and have made a blog post with preliminary rewards. Of course those rewards aren't going to be perfect straight away.
---
Hilarious
---
For real, just rename RC warding and integrate rune crafting into the new skill.
---
dont need dream mentor for veng
---
They aren't starting the warding poll though.
---
"[We expect to poll the skill in May, which means you've got plenty of time to tell us whether we're on the right track, or whether there are wider changes you want made](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/warding-design-blog?oldschool=1&amp;gsi=5r3vrn#_ga=2.65816233.646186810.1555535640-529189539.1555535640)".
---
Stop jumping to conclusions and spreading paranoia/misinformation.
---
Nice choice of meme though.
---
you speak the true true :'(
---
Replace top yes with no and we agree
---
I think it's just the absolute minimum they needed to make it look like it wasn't 1 frame is what i meant. As for the helmet, they only have a set number of polygons to work with, so detail is incredibly difficult in osrs
---
Nice post
---
runners would slow you down at lavas

but yeah sure i guess

Don‚Äôt get him addicted bruh. I love this game but it‚Äôs so unhealthy
---
I don't know dude, maybe try re-reading what I typed? Or get over yourself, or jerk yourself off. Any of those will work really.
---
2 minutes is everything going perfect.
---
Elite void/slave ei/archer i/God dhide boots with BP and BGS spec. Melee switch is drag boots/void melee/zerker i ring/fire cape. This includes woox walking. Decent BGS spec.
---
Getting pretty consistent sub 3:00 with BGS specs of 40+.
---
If I miss specs, it can take 4min+, in that case I usually tele house and try again. Going 4min+ I risk running out if food (80ish defence using monk/karam).
---
someone doesnt know the effect of quotations
---
Well holy fuck if it‚Äôs already happened who cares then? Let‚Äôs just implement eoc in that case!
---
I suppose that‚Äôs right. I guess people, including myself, are angry because it sets a bad precedent.
---
LMAO! xD
---
I don't like the skill as a whole. Sailing/Artisan would be much better.
---
Only Olm matters because it‚Äôs the most points and most time. Same logic is why people bring dh lance to CoX instead of a different stab weapon despite lance being worse at vasa than other choices
---
Haha bet Runelite is next
---
I'm not saying people don't do both. I'm saying that the reason they do both are different. People pvm for fun. It's entertaining. People skill for a sense of accomplishment or in order to reach a goal. For example, diaries, maxing, or unlocking other content.
---
Also, lets not pretend that the majority of skills aren't buy-able in some way or another. Therefore, making profit through PVM is the fastest way to level them. Doing 2k raids earns you 99 Prayer, Construction, Herbalism, Fletching, Cooking, Ranging, Magic, Crafting, Smithing, and farming.
---
It also allows you to pick training methods that emphasize XP rather than GP, such as 3 tick fishing, mining, and wood cutting.
---
They're not being polite they're starting a new timer so they can afk longer than if they stacked under you on your started timer
---
How has no one called you out on the irony of "I've been playing since '01" followed by "quit with the veteran flexing"

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even talk when I play‚Äù

You are free to do whatever you want, and all the other well adjusted people are free (and justified) to think less of you for it.

Q
---
Wait and try again soon
---
This. Dhcb is great but this even with just dragon cbow will help significantly. My first time on Ironman was like a 3:40 with runecbow and void with salve ei. In the meantime I've switched to dragon Hunter Lance now that I've gotten it though.
---
So I completed DS2 the other day, and I‚Äôm looking to get Vork‚Äôs head for the assembler, I only have 82 range with no elite void nor BGS. Obviously, I know I can‚Äôt efficiently kill vork, but I was just wondering if it would even be possible to get kills at all with my stats and gear. 83 defence as well. What do you advise my gear setup should be, or is it not even worth my time?
---
Complaining because we are depressed and just want to play our game without other people fucking with it and ruining our experience making us more depressed /s...?
---
Sick bro I still have mine. Once you can use better weapons its a cool icon to have as your quest items/armor tab.
---
Ah I still remember the first time I tried rs. I quit when making the bread on tutorial island because I didn‚Äôt know you could turn the camera. Good times.
---
If you're sick at the game you could do sara without any issues
---
TRUTH
---
Got in after 1hr 11mins
---
I partially agree. The issue I see is if no new skill comes the game will die and the community is too divided to vote in a new skill. Do I think warding is the end all be all in this discussion? No. But it does start the trend of the community is divided and a new skill could never be added causing the game to get stagnant.
---
Not useful at all for slayer.
---
Good for some monsters
---
Ya all 3 void sets

I‚Äôm broke and need a bond hit ya boy up. Through teamwork we can remove so much gp from the market. Daddy needs mems through 2030

My thoughts are a lot of the community asked to hide poll results and then the developers allowed it to happen. 
---
I honestly think the OSRS staff really do care about the game and listen to the community.
---
I don't think any are around like that. Most people don't view their sex lives as relevant to their in-game experience.
---
id like one too but i made a new acc when oldschool came out. if i could somehow get a jmod to transfer my character to my old account which is 100% never going to happen then id be down for vet capes

OSRS, the only game where people bitch and moan about new content being added. OSRS servers have been up for nearly 6 years now. Yes of course there is new stuff to do but are you seriously still leveling the same skills from half a decade ago?
---
I am not supermax and nor do I intend to ever be but how does adding a skill negatively impact your gameplay.  When farming came out. I never touched it, construction came out I leveled to 40 to see what it was all about. Haven't done much with it since. Hunter came out I maxed it and it was one of my favorite skills, summoning came out I couldn't be bothered to pick up the charms. Let them release content and play what you like..
---
That makes things more difficult you turd
---
Sick now go hit shit with it, brother. Lookin fly B)
---
It's called clipping the regular guide says it. But it's really convenient for sure.
---
FM would absolutely not pass a poll.
---
If your best counter is "u stupid" then maybe you shouldn't insult other people's opinions.
---
to spend on what?
---
you need it imbued to get the range bonus. Unimbued it only affects melee
---
Still makes it more interesting, believe it or not them 14 combat levels would make an incredible difference
---
I'll have you know, I am a Hardcore Vegan Vegetable Veterinarian Variety Veteran Virgin Ironman, by the way.

Another thing to mention, people with 99 Slayer and max combat are not going to like getting a bunch of charms from monsters they've already slain thousands of times.
---
Lynx Titan is a G, I‚Äôm not worshipping him but I respect the time and dedication he put into the game. I agree that playing that much runescape is not a good thing, and I don‚Äôt promote that lifestyle, but I sure as hell respect the fuck out of his patience. And shit, he was the first guy to 200m xp in all skills. That‚Äôs VERY cool
---
I believe it's considered macroing because it's no longer a rebind, but changing the function of the key to always be on pressed status. However, you're allowed to use the built-in windows feature of sticky keys to mimic it.

May not answer the question but I would love to see a ready player 1 reference since the whole movie was references.
---
Specifically a reference to the comment about the  orb lasting 10 minion years or what ever they said. Because let's be honest a lvl 99 magic artifact was an rs reference
---
Of course not. In an economy anything of value is an asset; whether that's a tradeable goods or money. Same difference. It's completely interchangeable. An unstopped increase in that (e.g. due to monster drops) leads to inflation.
---
There's a reason why in RS3 a bond is worth 20mil, even though it is worth exactly the same as an osrs bond (2weeks membership on the account). It's years and years of pvm'ing screwing with the economy. And RS3 even has a shitton of item/moneysinks nowadays.
---
The only thing that helps against this is for this money to just disappear from the game entirely, which currently happens mostly through Duel Arena Tax, and Construction (making planks costs money). However, more is better.
---
Yes, the person he's responding too.
---
Which is why the PKer‚Äôs vote will be important! Just like the people who blame Jill Stein for Clinton‚Äôs loss in ‚Äò16.

This thread is such a shit show lmao I love it

Shitty post bro who fucking cares. They‚Äôre hidden

I'm the other way, MTX can be ignored but EOC stripped the best part about RS away. I don't care about the graphics, either, but EOC is such a huge deal breaker.
---
Why didn't you anglerfish up you little noon?

Okay, genuinely curious here. How often does it come up that you're LGBT? If you just don't say anything about it, and I don't think there's ever a need to unless someone specifically ask, then you won't have any problems.
---
I don't get how so many people fail to understand this
---
Up you go for that cake analogy
---
Me to please
---
It‚Äôs rewind time haha
---
Can you elaborate on that? I'm getting up to 600 xp drops at once on adamant darts (they're 150 experience per action) because of the speed of my fingers. Is this still okay? Or do I deliberately have to do it slower to only get a max of 150xp drops?
---
For the love of god please make sure his chat profanity filter is on
---
Oh so your argument really is just "We don't really need new things at all" nice.
---
Raids have probably had a bigger impact on the metagame than any skill btw.
---
THE KING NEEDS NOURISHMENT
---
I just want summoning, i want cool pets to follow me around. The polls are a perfect watchdog making sure that now you can redo stuff like summoning and dungeeonering the right way. It's just impossible for this stuff to ''ruin'' the game because of how vocal the community is and how insanely fast we are to yell at them when they do make mistakes. (this is assuming the poll process is respected)
---
also vote no to warding.
---
Use void with salve ammy ei, and upgrade to dhcb for more chilled kills dragon ruby bolts first half then switch to diamond.
---
Just completed MM1 yesterday (good god) and bought a d scimmy. I'm kinda stumped on what to do now, my stats are quite average across the board but what's another good goal for me to get to? Trying to level to get better money making methods? I know skilling isn't very profitable anymore, so should I just rush slayer? At 34 slayer atm. Thanks!
---
i just spam click login tuil lets me in but gets locked again after logout
---
This is on the phone as well?
---
This is why ill be voting yes. Yes those new armours are bis but op has no idea how theyll be made, admittedly i dont either. But itd be polled. Want that bis at olm? 3sets of ancestral and a vissy for each piece. Zulrah? 3 of every drop plus an ancestral set. people dont seem to grasp the dissolving part of the skill. It wont devalue your ancestral itll be more valuable than ever, and still your best overall mage gear for bursting slayer and anything not zulrah or olm.
---
i'm pretty  good, issue is i'm a glass cannon vs these med levels, best i can do is ring of recoil their hp low enough to ags.
---
I remember there was a bug where you could plant then immediately dig up for the full exp. I still thought the skill was slow and was wondering what the fuck it was all about. When they fixed the bug, I thought the skill was impossible to level as a kid. Good times.
---
Lmao that fireball came ages late
---
What are we conjuring demons now? Satanic game, lol.
---
What is, with all of, the random, commas?
---
Flax prices are already dead, I'd be fine with fletching being moved to F2P, also adding yew bows to F2P.
---
That doesn't even remotely look like a crab
---
You are wrong.
---
&gt;ü§î Call it a catch 22 for them hiding poll results but its pretty suspicious that they push warding right after.
---
How much did you pay for your tinfoil hat?
---
&gt; Why are they pushing warding so hard, who asked for it?
---
Plenty of people want a new skill of some sort, including warding. I like the core mechanics of the skill, just not the rewards (right now). If Battle Wards/Conjuring are removed, it gets a hard yes from me. 
---
&gt;Why not put more dev time into reviving old minigames instead of a skill that will not have any uses.
---
Suggest uses then? Or if you're so against a new skill entirely, suggest methods of minigame revival that you can prove will work?
---
&gt;It seems like we have enough high level equipment currently and we can continue gradually adding new stuff in
---
Continuing to bloat what's already in the game isn't good design though.
---
&gt;dont make this into the invention skill.
---
It's not, and even if it were the economic benefits would be huge.
---
ya he doesn't want it, so its too much unwanted content
---
You are beyond me lol.
---
Magic tank armour? As if soul ark is going to be 10k and it‚Äôs worse than a tube plate body for def? You legit make no sense
---
zeah
---
To be fair spec pool wasn't a thing when construction came out
---
I also liked the idea a few people have said about needing ancestral to make the higher tier robes like Kinhunter and Venomous.  The Mystic cocktails are kinda stupid cause we don't need another chin/burst. Some other stuff like the Claw and Skull Scepter I'd have to see more about to really have an opinion on. 
---
The rebalancing and a lot of the new armors seem really cool.
---
Dissolving I could live without but I'm not really against it.
---
The different tiers of flax is a neat idea but the names are dumb.
---
Guess it's an obby or piety pure now rip
---
I'd love to see some art of that, just in full mage throwing buckets of liquid nitrogen at a pvmer
---
I'd like to think the whole Warding thing already has that locked up
---
No, but the more we meme about it the more flat earth believers will start thinking it's actually what we believe because they only ready post titles and no the actual comments.
---
So like 4-5 more weeks of these type of memes and the community will actually go full retard and start spouting it and saying those who asked for hidden poll results were duped.
---
The more intune you become with a subreddit and it's trends the more you just get exasperated at what is essentially an uncontrollable beast who works on the free will off thousands to make the disjointed mess we call OSRS subreddit.
---
Once Warding calms down this sub will probably become funny again, but right now its just sad.
---
imagine if they polled slayer. it wouldn't pass either.
---
"why do we need a skill? I already kill monsters. stupid. make it a minigame at the most"
---
Both shit sucked. all the nich small stuff ex:outfit that give a tiny xp boost? All of that is moved to Mtx.  Content is moved to Mtx and not in the game. But I agree. Eoc was a bigger deal at the start.
---
Any kid or his little brother could copy and paste from an online database leak. just trolls being trolls and jagex not doing the smart thing and doing sub only mode.
---
My boi loves teleporting leave him alone
---
The content was horrible the scalling was bad and it wasnt so much a skill, as a minigame or questionable minigame.It was literally a slower less rewarding easier raid with no new gameplay elements and the addition of a reward shop and reward tokens just compounds all this. It has nothing to do with its rs3=bad. Many people want it, just not as a skill. The new crystal dungeons coming with prif will be solo dungeoneering in a non skill form from what the devs shared of it so far
---
im voting no.
---
You're not wrong. Everyone is overly invested in this game, and everyone has a conflict of interest. We're not kids playing the game just excited to see content in general, everyone has an extreme opinion on how the game should flow. 
---
I'm no angel here, there's things I would vote no in a heart beat to ensure my favorite activities are undisturbed. There's practically an infinite number of ways to enjoy the game, so you're going to have a lot of opinions.
---
Yep, I've just had that also. Just try to login. I was able to login after 3 attempts.

Yeah, Wintertodt is my favorite skill too.

Doesn't help that rs turned so garbage most of the players quit. We got a 2nd chance and people are very vocal about the changes we want, and jagex tends to listen sooner or later.

It‚Äôs going back up

Vote no to daily content!
---
You realize that they know you're just joining to get a free pass at revs, so they're gonna scam or trick you lmao
---
No.
---
Duel arena tax has removed trillions of gp
---
Absolutely.
---
Range void is by far the most useful. Pretty much any time a monster has low defense AND you're not on a slayer task, you'd want to use range void.
---
Melee + mage are more niche. For melee, typically BiS str gear is better than void... But void is more accurate. This makes it BiS when you're trying to land DWH specs (Corp, ToB, etc.). It's also a viable option when you're learning CoX. Mage void is even more niche, since torm brace &gt; mage void not even counting the other armor pieces... But again, not useless. You can use mage void when learning things (Zulrah, CoX, etc.) so that you can bring less swaps and more food. The main use for mage void tho is in ToB, since you'll want void anyway and mage void saves on inv. Most people use mage void for ToB, you only really stop using mage void if you're the mager for nylos in high efficiency/effort runs.
---
As for slayer... Basically never. You'd only want to use range void for slayer (never melee or mage), and only if you're using a salve amulet on that task (Salve (ei) and slayer helm (i) don't stack, salve and void do). Otherwise, an imbued slayer helm / black mask are better than void.
---
I also partially support warding for this reason - 1750-2000 is the best for totals because there‚Äôs fewer people than 1500 and under but it‚Äôs not quite as smelly as 2.2k total
---
I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a jmod whose only job is to make sure climbing boots work

What‚Äôs up

"it's okay if I get hacked because if I log in every 3 days I can notice it!"
---
That's not really good enough. Just fix the recovery system and there's no need for a delay at all. And the delay alone wouldn't make it functional because you'd still keep getting compromised.

Tbow is not comparable to any chaotic weapon. One costs 1b gp, the other takes hours and hours of training and is not purchasable.
---
I‚Äôm willing to pay
---
I read the picture and knew immediately what sub it was referring to before even looking
---
Power Supply Unit? Idk what psu is other than that, lol
---
Jagex
---
I‚Äôm voting wombo
---
what a shitty script
---
This random guy is actually watching the new star wars trailer. I have never been this passionate about something I'm kind of envious.
---
Lmfao such a noob. It‚Äôs only takes 10 hours to get out of that gear bracket.
---
?????? Who said that?????
---
And also the Duel Arena is an insane money sink.
---
this is the truest thing that's ever been posted on this sub
---
why? Could be a case of the silent majority doesn‚Äôt care, and approves of it. The only voices being heard are the loudest.
---
We also had pak yaks and other monsters that carried items. It really disrupts the balance in the game. Probably a good idea to stay away from anything related to spawning allied minions
---
&gt;omg don't criticise or point out how retarded this new skill is, stop whining your input is not useful!! 
---
your only response to pointing out the detrimental flaws in this proposal is "oh but they are willing to remove every part of the skill" (read that back to yourself and realise how retarded you are to support warding). they could bring out mage gear that has 100% magic damage and idiots like you would be like "oh the % is not set in stone, they are open to re-balancing". 
---
Assuming they took out all the stuff i listed, this skill is still so unnecessary, because everything could be worked into already existing skills. Jagex for whatever reason seemed to be obsessed with bringing a new skill as oppose to actually fixing what's already in the game.
---
I didn't say 25 is impossible although 25 for someone who is just starting to do them is a bit of a stretch. From all the people I've heard and personal experience, they can do about 20 per hour at a moderate rate over long periods of time. The actual rate is lower than that when you take into account the time it takes to do the master clues from them. Besides Menzy, no one else on the top 10 med hiscores is that active so I don't know who else you could be referring to when you said they did 1200 in a week.
---
o.O if it works it works mate.
---
Everyone in every single one of these threads is discussing theory and theoretical changes with DND style napkin math. 
---
You make a very good straw man out of disassembly and then rag on them taking the initiative to have one skill fix multiple problems at once? So what you're saying is the skill covers multiple facets of the game, is indepth and well thought out, and enriches dozens of core features of the base game?
---
What more do we want out of a new skill. If you told me you don't like disassembly due to it reminding you of the Division or other games that use salvaging as a mechanic, I'd believe you. But to be mad that they are trying to do as much as they can as asinine.
---
If the skill was simplistic the opposite complaint would be "Not enough effort jamflex, wtf is this a 2nd graders project"
---
Formatting
---
Can we stop pretending that little timmy that's only played for 2 weeks due to the mobile release and things the graphics are "shitty" and wants the combat to be like WoW has as valuable an opinion as an actual OG?
---
Only good thing is the minotaurs at the stronghold for iron arrows on f2p. Thats about it lol
---
1 downvote = 1 vote for the bogdanoffs
---
Lol raids are not OSRS's version of dungeoneering. You can't buy your gear in dungeoneering.
---
is that "thank you very much" a brie larson reference?
---
Farming that ganja. Do varrock achievements for dailys and slayer.
---
I have a clan mate that literally votes no to every single update that adds something new.
---
no. you can have 99 ranged and mage under 70 combat
---
Which is fine, but IMO there absolutely should be things which straight up require a team in an mmo.
---
just add invention
---
The battlewards will be used for so much trolling and crashing i dont see how it could work
---
Thank you I've never done Tears of Guthix so I didn't know who Juna is.
---
Think of all the pirate gear we could get with sailing  :D
---
Oh man.  This really annoyed me on Zeah release, but you know what made me livid?  The fact that when brought up, Mod Mat K said that remaking the island wasn't "worth their time" now that it was out, and that they would prefer to make new updates.  It was at this point that I really saw the business aspect of the game, and I've been more pessimistic when voting for new updates since then, as they clearly showed they didn't actually care about the quality of updates, just the quantity.
---
My whole point is that not all of them are joking, you were being disingenuous when you tried saying it was all memes. And even those who were joking are still at fault for spreading hateful rhetoric, even in jest, because it normalizes their shitty ideas.
---
It shouldn't really be fundamentally different than with range, but I do wonder why you think magic is a better option?
---
My hand doesn't move when dropping items on mobile. Only my thumb moves and that's very slightly and with a very quick pattern that takes place
---
Make sure your time on your phone/authenticator is same as your PC could be the issue
---
Ganja? What is that? And thanks for the advice!
---
I‚Äôm all for a new skill, but not the way they proposed it. Feels too bloated with content
---
Were dungeoneering bots really a thing? Lol.
---
ZMI is lunars IIRC
---
I know that konduit database was leaked. Have you used it?
---
I don't have range lol. That's the only reason.
---
You haven't pointed out any flaws though. You've just whined without providing any logic behind how you think different parts of the skill would affect the game or suggesting how they could be changed so that they'd be balanced
---
Definitely made it much easier though haha
---
All they need to do is to change, remove, and add some stuff and bing bam boom warding is good to go, for the most part.
---
They could easily change the rewards and keep the general gameplay the same.
---
Yeah but like 90% of the player base has been playing the game since 2007 literally or close to it so everyone opinion is valid I think.
---
large icicle photographs?
---
Samee back in like 2010 finally fighting elvarg was EPIC
---
Mate they've literally squeezed about 3 skills, a minigame, and a new combat aspect into this. It's just shiny new shit for the sake of shiny new shit.
---
I just think warding is so much more complex than it needs to be. They should have made it similar to crafting and smithing.
---
Just to nitpick, restoration pools and the majority of poh teleports were voted in osrs. 
---
I don't think it's reasonable to make that assumption when they've only polled 3 different skills. Lackluster, mechanically uninteresting and forced skills at that. Jagex can do better and it's not wrong of the community to hold them to a higher standard.
---
Artisan is like the daily task system from pre eoc. Sailing had ass for mechanics, the dev blog said that one of the training methods was just paying shipmakers for afk xp like farming. Warding is intentionally boring SplashCrafting with way out proportion game changing rewards.
