Yes but OP linked directly to what I said and off-handedly referred to them as if they were QOL changes

I have a friend whose brothers coworker briefly dated Settled. She said that on their first date they went to a restaurant and Settled ordered two different bowls of soup and mixed them together one spoonful at a time before eating both bowls mixed together as one soup.
---
They should have opened the client, listed each one, and listed which are allowed or not AND WHY.  This shit is crap, leaves way too much vague shit.
---
Cheating is cheating man. With a test, game or a relationship there's a reason it's all the same word.
---
Just worth mentioning that the first 20 minutes is quite word rich as they talk about 3rd party clients, staff leaving, runefest/Q&amp;As, account security blog etc. I've tried to summarise those as best I could but you should really check the announcement post for full info!
---
I came here for *M E M E S*, not for feels!
---
True until proven you WEREN’T there
---
Nah, I'd rather risk a few deaths and have bored as fuck PKers completely wasting their time for shit PVM loot instead of actually having fun. Too much toxic firsthand experience for me to vote yes on any PVP content, even if it's something I actually really wanted.
---
[removed]
---
Ugh it's actually quite clear, and it essentially boils down to: every single 3rd party client has features that are bannable and you have been warned.
---
Doesnt need a level but requires a “head” drop from a specific mob to use and recolour the helm. Kbd for black, sire/abby demons for red, kq for green, hydra for dark blueish, vorkath for light blue and skotizo claw for purple.
---
No levels, but you need an item to color it. 
---

---
For example the KBD heads for a black color, after you unlock the option to do so.
---
And they proceed to give only examples of ones which affect skills and possibly xp rates, in particular the ones osb has recently released. If you really think they care about a bank swap or something similar and think they can detect it simply don't use it. Im simply explaining why people are interpreting it differently, not stating my opinion here.

1 click pickpocket is pretty dumb
---
Swampman shit
---
Cool thanks ! I already bought the red not realizing it took more kills than all the rest to obtain. But awesome. Appreciate it
---
Okay, have fun
---
I would love to see what they could do with a none “good guy” raid. Whether it be sara, arma, or guthix, I think it’d be really neat
---
If you're trying to say cheating in a video game is the same thing as cheating in a relationship then idk what to say dude, you sound like randal from recess rn
---
Regardless, the lack of new and engaging PVP content is self-inflicted. Several PVP polls probably would have passed if almost everyone voting no didn't have several firsthand stories of toxic creatures griefing them in the Wild.
---
Who the fuck keeps putting the barricades back up? The dagganoth? I don’t think so. There’s no reason for those to go back up after you pass through the first time. Maybe make them stay down after a quest or the hard diary?
---
He didn't get a single dragonstone drop! It's a shame, really.
---
To extend on this, here is how I'd add Level 80 Armor. For one, Bandos, Armadyl, and Ancestral are all the same tier; their levels vary and Ancestral is still rarer, but they are all equivalent armors so those would be what is upgraded to make Level 80.
---
Instead of just using an upgrade item on them, it would require Smithing or Crafting. So to upgrade a helm, it would be 1 Fragment and 90 Smithing/Crafting, Legs would be 2 Fragments and 93, and Body would be 3 Fragments and 96. (Side note, no idea how you deal with Bandos's lack of a helm.) This would make tradeable Level 80 Armor, but it would degrade similar to Barrows. However, that is not all. If you take the Level 80 Armor and 1-3 Fragments, you can upgrade it to a non-degrade version that is untradeable. That catch is this requires 1 level higher than what is needed to make the armor, so 91, 94, and 96. If you lose it in a PvP Death, it reverts back to a full charge tradeable version.
---
So overall, this system would fix a lot of problems. It provides a sink for Bandos, Armadyl, and Ancestral while keeping it relevant. The untradeable upgrades adds a bit more of a sink to the Fragments as well to help avoid a Pegasian issue. It makes Smithing and Crafting relevant to make the initial armor and worth leveling to make the untradeable armor without locking BiS stats behind high skill levels. And it even makes the POH Armor Stand repair discount more useful so you can benefit from Smithing even without the level to make the untradeable version.
---
I remember back in highschool we had a true and false section where we only had to write T of F. I ended up writing a mutated form T/F so the teacher couldn't tell.... I got zero on that section
---
tbh at that point it's just straight up botting so it'd be up to the bot detection to look for patterns if the client is trying to spoof input.

There is no other way

No, if you get 88 percent, you start receiving bolt racks. You DON'T want bolt racks.
---
My comment is written correctly.
---
I blame jagex for releasing an unclear article
---
MMOs like elder scrolls online have this. If setting up a web site is too hard for them websites like Nexus for mods could be used. Could probably make use of the Nexus manager too, but that's getting too third party for my comfort again if we're going down the 'official' third party plugins. Ideally they would have their own web page where you just link the plugin to your login.
---
In elder scrolls online the capabilities really only let you change minor things like displaying information in different ways, or modifying UI elements, or making a dps display tool. In osrs I imagine this would just end up being floor item text and the basics in a enviorment where they can control. 
---
Other nice thing about this way is they only have to work into the client maybe once or twice, instead of trying to make a new official client feature Everytime runelite thinks of a new plugin that gets popular.
---
If I was training at black chins it would only be for the XP and they would be released before the chin stack could ever go over 40-50. Fuck giving any of these creatures even 1k.
---
1, 10, X, All, something like that is what you should look for. That’s how you withdraw/deposit all. It came out on mobile first and was later added to the desktop version to keep everything equal.
---
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo

I haven't played Runescape in like 10 years but I still enjoy watching these videos so there is a lot of new (to me) stuff that I don't really understand.   
---
  
---
How does he go about managing his inventory? Is there some sort of bank he can use or is that not available in the area he is at? He talks about how important inventory space is, but it seems like sometimes he swaps around what he is carrying but I don't know where his other stuff goes.
---
Where’s your Woox plugin?
---
Duo Kalphite Queen was really popular back in the day. I remember being on rsnl dot eu(dutch runescape website) and seeing a lot of picture collage about people doing it.
---
I somehow did this puzzle on the first attempt (not row), just barely made it lol
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Mods: Kieren, JohnC, Sween, Gambit.
---
2.  This will be the last Q&amp;A before RuneFest.
---
  *  Thanks
---
3.  Announcements. Please see News post for 3rd Party Clients. Mod Wolf is Leaving. Fremennik Exiles was released last week. Currently a poll for BH rewards rework. RuneFest is coming up so keep an eye on that! This weeks game update will be Wednesday instead of Thursday to ensure that Jmods are able to attend RuneFest and be on-hand for the update.
---
  *  https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1 ------- https://twitter.com/Jay_Wilton/status/1178610468749037568
---
4. There will be a few updates on Fremennik Exiles, knights will be harder to kill with some bug updates.
---
  *  Thanks!
---
5. What took so long to get a proper statement and why was it delayed?
---
  *  Because it's a large and sensitive topic there are lots of people that need to sign off on any official comms around the studio. There was a lot of back and forth refining that. 
---
6. Have you been discussing this between the developers of the clients?
---
  *  There has been some discussions. Can't say what and who this was between but if you are a developer of a client please feel free to reach out to discuss this further.
---
7. If a certain feature is against the rules but thousands of players have used it for Months, why won't you b%FILTER%an them? How is it fair that they get to keep their advantage over players getting to do that content in the future?
---
  *  We apologise for the delay in statement/action and lack of clarity. With that said it wouldn't be fair to apply sanctions to players that used features when our stance wasn't clearer. 
---
8. In the blog you mention more clarity, how can we get that clarity when @JagexSupport links to help pages and your other staff don't reply or just direct us to Jagex support. How do I know what I'm doing won't get us ba%FILTER%nned?
---
  *  Keep an eye on the 3rd Party Clients announcement page as this will change as required. 
---
9. What will you do to players that abuse these features?
---
  *  We will take some time to consider how to enforce this and may apply b%FILTER%ans, in the longer term we will look at how else to address that.
---
10. What will you do to those that are developing and sharing clients that includes those features?
---
  *  In a similar note to above we are taking time to assess. We will communicate an update once decided however that may not be made public or only communicated to those specifically developing and sharing. 
---
11. You talk about other clients but don't mention yours, what are the plans here. Why don't you update the official client or partner with another unofficial?
---
  *  We want to work with you (players) to determine the right long term solution. We took some impulsive action last year that player base was not happy with - saying that RuneLite should be shut down. We don't want to discount any options but have a lot to consider, like what issues that may lead to. --- Partnering with a client has further considerations like what happens to forked clients or those derived from others? 
---
12. What's the status on the account security blog?
---
  *  We have identified work that we'd like to do with account security. Having read it (Sween) feels it handles all concerns and we are in the process of working out when you might see those changes. Want to release the blog when we know more on that timeline. 
---
13. What's happening with the OSRS team and everybody leaving? MTX etc?
---
  *  No, no MTX. Not downsizing the team either we want to grow! Have a new Executive producer which we'll introduce after RuneFest. A new dev started today and new product manager and a new QA manager! There are more and developer agreements with engine team plans too! --- It is sad to stop working with our friends, at the same time we will continue and new staff will come. 
---
14. Any chance of having the Jormungand as a repeatable mid-level slayer boss?
---
  *  Anything is possible from a technical point, it would need consideration and rewards/incentives to repeat it. --- Kieren; Feels like a reasonable idea and we've done repeatable bosses in the past. While doing repeatable bosses (Galvek, SoTE boss etc) is nice it doesn't see large engagement so adding value back and incentive is a nice idea. --- Gambit: From a Lore perspective it doesn't make huge sense so maybe could need consideration.
---
15. Are the following mobile improvements possible? Long-tap delay adjustable, portrait mode, items on ground indicator, ability to tap on the far side of menus of different phone sizes.
---
  *  tap-delay we can adjust but not sure if it can be player-dynamic ---- Portrait was explored when developing mobile and it was BAD, not really useable and you really don't want it. The User interface doesn't work in any real way and it would be a huge amount of work to make it useable in any way and still won't be good. --- Clicking outside the side-stones, that change will be coming on Wednesday with a toggle. --- Items on the ground; Something that would like to address and include but is not straightforward due to the way the game is build and the way the app works and interacts with the client etc. No idea what that will look like but something will happen one-day.
---
16. Can you make the Face-guard a little darker to match Ba%FILTER%ndos better?
---
  *  Really it's up to you guys but to avoid changing the helmet that it's based on (Neitiznot) it would be preferable to introduce this as a recolour option. Check out Mod Wests twitter and give feedback!
---
17. Is there a mod to contact if you have any ideas for OSRS improvements?
---
  *  Reddit, Twitter, any current Mod! Q&amp;A etc too! 
---
18. There are a number of questions about whether a specific plugin is ba%FILTER%nnable.
---
  *  We can't say specifically right now but we are monitoring it and will take action in the future if we need to.
---
19. At one point John C mentioned saving multiple logins on Mobile.
---
  *  This was something we were looking at, am not an expert in login Authorisation but believe it's possible. Not in the current immediate plan but would like to follow that up. 
---
20. Gambit: Just talking to ED and the team about the new Neitiznot helm and whether it should be Best in slot having +6 or +5 Strength bonus. This can change and we are looking at it. 
---
  *  Strawpoll: Should the new helm be +5 or +6 Strength bonus. 51% +6....49% +5.
---
21. Can we get Agility contracts to make agility less painful?
---
  *  Don't think it would make it less painful! Contracts for the right content can be really engaging and rewarding however feel that Agility could be changed in other ways if players want.
---
22. [IMAGE] Swampletics Fan-art. /u/JulianGyllene
---
  *  Wow!
---
23. [IMAGE] @JagexWest Pixel-art map of Gielinor
---
 * Cute! Check his twitter for different sizes too.
---
See, reasoning doesn't really have any relevance. Luckily PKers are still hated enough in general that we keep smacking down the shitty PVP polls.
---
Eww
---
24. Discussion on Strawpoll result for the faceguard.
---
  *  Will have to think about it further as well where and how the Serp. Helm fits in too. There is a bit of room at the top for a new BIS helm so please send through feedback on this (and any other rewards or updates too!). --- Longer discussion on long-term roadmaps for example polling rewards seperate to context of where they come from, what content would players expect to see new meta-changing things like t80 (instead of being announced as it comes up). 
---
25. Met last week to discussed opinion polls and surveys on existing content that players may want us to look at. That's going to be a bit more of a process to go through so that we know what should be addressed next and how (watch this space).
---
  *  Mod Gambit is working on this and will hear more on that soon and have a chance to provide feedback on that.
---
26. Death Mechanics. 
---
  *  Idea is an in-game poll or to address that specifically as the game progresses. We want to figure out how and what kind of work would be required here.
---
27. Could we get a way to select which game messages are filtered? Currently we can choose whether to filter messages but cannot choose which are filtered and which are not.
---
  *  Unfortunately not. That would be a big change to how the chat system works on that level. Could make it so you can toggle a few of them or specific ones, but not to have every message toggleable... 
---
28. Currently finding a PVM clan or group requires going to the forums to stumble across an old thread has has been bumped. Can the trading post be repurposed to advertise clans?
---
  *  No idea how exactly the Trading Post works! But totally open to looking at a solution in some way, an in-game thing like the POH notice-board or something. 
---
29. Can the success rate of cooking Zamorak wines scale, it's odd at the change of failing is the same from when you can make them all the way to 99. Maybe 50% at 65 cooking and 100% at 99? 
---
  *  We could look at that, worth consideration.
---
30. Do you feel that locking Zulrah behind a quest requirement is necessary?
---
  *  Kieren: Really there's two sides to this; bots and whether it's appropriately requirements for eng-game level items. Generally don't like changing game content that already exists like that, for the sake of bots. --- Sween: Some success was seen when changing things last year for the anti-botting measures like making Dragon-slayer start requirement for wielding Anti-dragon shields. --- Needs further consideration and discussing with appropriate team.
---
31. What are your plans for Raids 3? There's some burn-out in the high-level PVM community and recent content has been solo-oriented. A new challenge would be fun. 
---
  *  JohnC: Have been thinking and Discussing with ED about where and how a new raid would look like but that's all I'll say for now. --- Gambit: There are lots of places we could introduce new content like that.
---
32. What kind of room in the game is there for more Guilds? Runecrafting or a tanks guild?
---
  *  JohnC: Room for all of them! So long as the content matches and feels right. They're a great place for central content that fits. --- Perhaps for existing content survey etc! --- Gambit: The Farming guild set the bar quite high so would definitely want to make guilds have continuing content.
---
33. Thoughts on revamping Slayer bosses like Grotesque Guardians or Abyssal Sire?
---
  *  A lot of these tweaks are known and achievable but not currently in the schedule... Husky has taken on looking at Sire issues and there's nothing official planned or in the works but hopefully there will be something at some time! --- Guardians issues have been noted and are on the list to look at.
---
34. Following expansions, Treasure Trails soon become saturated with rewards. Could there be a new activity for cosmetics?
---
  *  Yes, it would be nice to offer more ways to access more content. 
---
35. Elves in Prifddinas have a rare unique on their thieving table, can other high level thieving NPCs get their own?
---
  *  Like this question as a lot of high-level thieving NPCs aren't engaged a lot because they don't have incentive. This would be a nice way to encourage that without impacting XP rates. If you have any ideas on designs please let us know! 
---
36. Can we please have a default option on the Jewelry box? This would be in line with other Jewellery in the house.
---
  *  Think so maybe? It would be nice and don't have anything against having a default. Will have to look into it further.
---
37. Group Ironman?
---
  *  The engine work required (for Clans too) is happening but we don't have anything to offer at this stage. 
---
38. Can you poll a minigame task system, this would encourage people to try out a variety of minigames?
---
  *  What do you see that being? Would this be to go play X minigames or tasks within the minigame? We've seen in a number of instances that anything that has poor design or doesn't directly encourage winning means that players just AFK or have other motives. Would be nice to encourage more activity through other means but some solution could be explored. 
---
39. PVP updates and how those are polled?
---
  *  We are currently running a poll and the last question asks why a player may vote no so that we can get a better idea on why players may be voting no. It's still in the works and planning.
---
How the fuck could I be banned playing mobile? Runelite on desktop and the official app on mobile. I work three shifts and sometimes im up all night playing mobile at work. How the fuck does this even happen? If you monitored my account it would have shown that every week is another playing style moving forward 8 hours. Your detection system doesn't basically eliminates the possibility that someone is able to play efter 00:00 when you apparently should be asleep. Im in GMT+1 time zone living in Sweden. I would love to believe that this is a joke. I demand an answer from anyone responsible to this action. I keep investing hours upon hours in this game to either get hacked, cleaned or banned. Whats the fucking point anymore?
---
Calling it. This next season he he get a pet or a cape of skulls.
---
You seem fun.
---
You're getting upset over nothing, chill.
---
rs3 uses c++, OSRS uses Java. Most of the team who converted rs3 -&gt; c++ have left.
---
why wasn’t he looking for obby cape R instead of god cloak?
---
but why not have them as treasure trail rewards?
---
Do people actually think this puzzle is hard, or is this just a meme?  I got it on my first try, these ate very simple once you know the technique.
---
It really is. I like memes, but every time I see a new one on this sub I roll my eyes.
---
Based on my math, he was in the ~92% percentile with that drop rate. Meaning 92% of players would found have that crossbow in fewer attempts.
---
Really unlucky.
---
I'm pretty sure you can, unless they've changed it.
---
3a cloak would be bis
---
vestment cloaks would probably be better than obby cape because of the +3 pray
---
**beat drops** *spawns in lumbridge walking like he gotta take a dump*

---
I think if you spent more time in the Wildy or pking you would change your opinion a little, but that being your experience is fair. I had the same opinion until I started pking and now I think it like 40% toxic. Which is still a lot tbh, but I’ve met some nice people in the wildy.
---
Wow, nice catch! This is big news! Prifddinas was heavily inspired by rs3’s version aswel so I wouldn’t be too suprised. The Menaphos expansion was one of the best additions to rs3 so far, so if this is true it would be a dreaming becoming reality.  
---
Also didn’t they confirm the next raid will be in the desert? That would mean that its tied to Menaphos and is closer than we might expect.
---
Probably between two and three. Mostly in the second column, but there are several "third column" plugins that are for more QOL than they are cheating, and create a game action that feels more like natural game design that's more fun and the way it should have been designed in the first place.
---
Left-click Construction is harmless to game health, and greatly advantageous to physical (wrist and eye) health without affecting the in-game economy or achievements (no change in XP rate). It feels more natural to train this way, and it feels like the game should have been designed this way. **Right**-click Blackjacking rewards effective players with EHP training rates, a reward that is taken away with the introduction of left-click Blackjacking. Construction does not share this system.
---
There is no reward for being able to right-click and then left-click in one tick, as it's the only way to effectively train the skill. It's cancerous carpal tunnel and eye strain for the sake of cancerous carpal tunnel and eye strain. For a skill that is trained (and enjoyed) almost completely in solitude and doesn't trample on the gameplay of other players, there is absolutely no place for a right-click. Blackjacking is cancer, but it's cancer because there are alternatives that still give decent XP if you don't want to do it that way.
---
I don't personally believe that a game, a game that is supposed to be played to have fun, should involve skills that are bad for your health simply for shits and giggles.
---
Is this not what the OP was not getting at?
---
It's gonna suck so much if I have to use the vanilla client... I'm way too spoiled with all the plug-ins that give me more information
---
If you understand the simple mechanic of it everyone should.
---
Green Tick right rune right spot. Red tick right rune wrong spot. The technique he used is how you start, and if you got some green ticks you change first 2 and see if green ticks stay or if new ticks arrive. It should take 6-7 moves to easily solve it, and there's a formula to follow to solve pretty much every solution in 5 or less moves.

He just needed a 3rd party client that flashes in the rainbow colours and makes a beep sound when he dropped below x hp.

One of many reasons I still play gw1 and not gw2
---
Jagex has something crazy like a 50% profit margin
---
So to be on the safe side dont use menu entry swapper or anything like it until further notice? Im not tryin to get banned.
---
Don't forget the good old "if you really need these features you should just quit the game"
---
Ignoring completely that the game would lose like 80% of the playerbase and go to shit if they got what they wanted
---
Please don’t leave :(.
---
But seriously good luck on your future endeavors! I’m thankful to have been a part of a game that you’ve worked on and put as much love and effort as the community who play it. It’s been an honour.
---
Nice
---
I'm a new player and I've been enjoying I'm just scared third-party clients are going to get a actually band
---
I've never cried from happiness before now.

yeah, this is my third task and I have only killed the boss. The alchables make every kill worth it, so it's easy to stay motivated.
---
No worries mate, a lot worse has been said on this subreddit :)
---
Don't worry guys, they're unable to deal properly even with gambling bots... can't imagine with third-party clients that have basically 90% of actual players. unless they're heading towards the direction of RS3 (massive ragequitting decisions), it is all good.
---
kC 325, off task, jaw
---
Oh no, he did the alternating caps, I must be wrong. I'm sure next comment he'll tell me to imagine something to really hammer it home.
---
You think that demonic guerillas are the same as the inferno lol. You're probably just bad at combat. Demonic guerilla plugin is closer to potion timers than your hypothetical inferno beating plugin. You probably shit your diaper at the thought of potion timers too, so that point may be lost on you.
---
Oof, right in the feels
---
I'm not exactly sure how ALL of it works, but you can only receive drops from a brother's armor set if you killed them that run. The 1/17 is the rate of receiving ANY piece is if all 6 brothers are killed, with each armor set having a different roll.
---
Double chests can be explained the same way, you just roll 2 different brother's armor tables in the same chest. 
---
Unfortunately I don't know how to explain the odds of getting a dharok helm and legs at the same time. If someone does, pls reply because I would like to know myself
---
Where did they talk about that? Just wondering. I only remember the ep where Settled talked about it, but couldn't figure out why it was there because he couldnt find any record of someone even suggesting it
---
There’s a meme about raking weeds like every 2 months and the top comment is always something about auto weed and the replies are always people who are really surprised... like come on y’all
---
After reading dev blog and watching q&amp;a I really didn't get this. What I got was you can use 3rd party clients just turn off plugins that go against what was explained in the dev blog (which is really just integrity on whether or not you do it at this point)
---
TierZoo has been around for a minute bro.
---
conditions were different. bad pc and bad internet would make the fight many times harder. now you just run away and afk until the demon is low hp.
---
Ayiza left because of IRL relating things though. A shame really, he grew onto me as one of the best Jmods
---
Nice comment history, u dont understand shit holy fuck
---
Hmm, yeah you're right, either way there's a lot of room for improvement in that slot
---
Third party clients could have it out in a week, but you may or may not get banned for it.
---
r/ThatsTheJoke
---
Definitely not the right response. Glad they didn't do that.
---
I'm fucking confused. Sounded and looked like he was just randomly clicking
---
Edit: nvm just saw a post with the actual streamer solving it. Lmao
---
the reality of it is its 100 percent because of the community, they find more and more to complain about and always just go back and forth with shit thats just contradicting, leaving the devs and employees overwhelmed with no options, the community is shit, has always been shit, and will continue being shit until the game is dead, period. im just gonna play in peace until its all over :)
---
There probably isnt a correlation of the 3rd party clients and him leaving
---
Hellboy med helm?
---
Nice.
---
Fair enough it just read to me like you shouldn't be getting 88% and you should be getting 100% instead but I get what you mean.
---
I hadn't played RS in years (7+) and this series has got me interested again :)
---
I saw Settled at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
---
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
---
OP said engine/client
---
7/10
---
I like this more than my idea
---
the technology hasn't caught up to osrs yet.
---
Exactly that’s where the line should be drawn, menu entry swap all your fucking way through the game no issues no game integrity hurt in my book but performing multiple actions in 1 click like altar and firemaking does hurt game integrity and I think is easily detectable and should be bannable just say it’s bannable to perform those actions 1st offence 1 day ban 2nd offence 3day ban 3rd offence perm ban. Since it’s really easy to detect whether players technically perform too many game actions in too little amount of clicks and should be banned quickly.
---
Look at the nose, obvs MJ
---
Lmfao that’s actually hilarious
---
The problem people have, is that you can't really take any rules seriously if they aren't enforced.
---
There wouldn't even be tests if everyone could cheat on them, without being caught 100% of the time.
---
It's pretty well known in NA
---
Haha it definitely seems that way sometimes.
---
99 craft but no Fremmy elite KEKW
---
You can go to the VOD and add messages later lol. Faux did the same thing when Muts died.
---
MMK is a true legend
---
Your criticism was shit, because the comparison was poor.
---
Rock highlighted, enjoy your permaban for game abusing mechanics
---
Damn that video brings back so much nostalgia. It was awesome back in the day when rs vids would just be clips of people wailing on shit with music in the background.
---
We need super camels
---
They do hurt players. The more people using OP plugins, the less valuable the rewards of those activities will be. People who 1-click blackjacked or construction farmed are gonna get an immensely easier 99, devaluing the cape. Overlays that make Barrows and bosses much easier are gonna increase everyone's efficiency immensely, lowering the price of the rewards, making it less worth it for those who aren't using those clients or plugins.
---
Favorite runescape streamer that sucks :(
---
Took me a minute
---
Somethings should have already been predict as early as 2013 when Orion client  (before name change to rsbuddy) was in full force
---
Hard drive full? Maybe it doesnt have read/write permissions? Windows permissions or anti virus could be messing with it? Just a few guesses but this is a weird one
---
Likewise.
---
Lol
---
Sent ya’ a friend request, TallyLove#9899
---
You must have some poor time management skills if you think it has to take up your life to play this game.  Honestly, the game has been out for 6 years now, it shouldn't be surprising that people are making it to end game, I have a steady career and doing great, this is just a hobby of mines.
---
He hit 4 hp before death so ring of life would have saved him 100%. Sad to see his account go, so soon after finishing GWDs as well.
---
Up to 92, so goals achieved.
---
So does this mean I can't use the menu entry swapper anymore? Was planning on grinding out some dragon bones on the altar using the left click thingy.  Is this not allowed now?
---
I think no to adding it to void(despite me wanting it for vork lol) voids already good
---
I think it being on the slayer helm would be an  awesome addition though, maybe you could charge it with scales to do something extra along side the protection? not venom though
---
Well if I win the lottery then I can pay the devs more and it will get done faster. It's a win win situation.
---
Oh wah. Bots are in the game, therefore I can cheat. Get the fuck out of here.
---
Jk jk not nice not nice.. but wut if?
---
Not sure if sarcasm
---
Queue*
---
hard no from me dawg
---
Fuck it.  Do it in assembly like a real man.  Roller Coaster tycoon did it, so can Jagex.
---
You can add a message after the clip was taken. He just saw the clip and typed it at the timestamp in his VOD.
---
?
---
I always use the vanilla client in fixed screen mode, if you don't you're not only bad at Runescape, but a plebeian
---
When it comes to programming the number of employees dedicated to a single project only increases the speed and efficiency up to a certain point, when a team gets too large and the workload is broken up too much then often a team would spend more time on integration and debugging of each individuals work than if just a smaller team worked on it, the smaller original team (In this case a group of jmods) gets the added benefit of knowing/being familiar with each others coding habits making it easier in terms of integration and debugging. 
---
Edit: I believe it's called "Brook's Law".
---
The fact he never left rs3 when it went to shit would disagree.
---
If you play the game you’ll consistently make money. Play like an Ironman tbh. Do skilling, PvM, herb runs, really just do everything.
---
Bad bot get out of here, you're ruining my sarcasm.
---
What kind of music do you like? Give me some recommendations please.
---
(I always ask this when people criticize streamer music)
---
Their comment was 4 hours before the other one.
---
They have said that wow classic is going to be stagnant though, done after naxx or aq40 or whatever. People are still so into it and as a huge wow fan I'm having trouble wanting to dedicate time to a game that wont evolve at all. 
---
I feel much more comfortable in the rs sandbox that almost never ends + new content quite often.
---
wait but both of those are pretty valid arguments. the client devs who implemented a lot of the MES features did so on the logic that to the server there's nothing to distinguish them.
---
Honestly, you have more than most on your screen even with this being a troll. Rs3 can get bad if you want to do the END game bosses (Telos, Nex Angel of Death, Araxxi, Virago, Raids) but at that point you are far more versed in using full manual so you can watch for phase changes and special attacks from bosses while still being able to dps enough.
---
When the analogy falls apart, it's a shitty one.
---
This isn't hard to grasp. Well, for most this isn't hard to grasp. I understand this is a little out of your depth, though.
---
I agree that it's pretty explicit, but it seems not a single client plans to remove stuff like menu entry swappers until explicitly told to (based on what I've read). Some clients flat out refused to remove *any* plugins, although they're the clients that are already widely considered to be "cheat" clients.
---
I'm a noob so this might be a stupid question, but why do people like this not wear a ring of life?

It's a long term thing. You won't get rich overnight unless you're willing to buy bonds.
---
NEVER stake. It seems like a shortcut to getting rich but you will always end up losing it all eventually. 
---
My experience? PVM and Merching. I'm far from rich but I have enough to buy most items I want.
---
Slayer: Once you get a decent slayer level, do the more profitable tasks like garogoyles, nechs, dust devils, etc. At higher cmb and slayer levels, do the boss variants like Demonic gorillas, Cerb, Alchemical Hydra, Vorkath, Zammy GWD, etc. I've easily made 500m from slayer alone.
---
Bossing: Similar to above. Sara, Arma, Zulrah, etc. etc. etc. Hit new content for those rare drops on day 1. If you're luck to get a new BIS item on release, it's almost a guaranteed 100m+
---
Raids: Get a group of friends and grind raids. Even better, learn to solo. Again, made 200-300m from solo raids (150ish kc)
---
Merching: Takes good understanding of the OSRS market but it's as close as you'll get to free money. Again, **you won't get rich over night** but even if you just find an item you can make 100k profit per day from (which is pretty low) that's an easy 36.5m/year. Multiply that by however many items you want to juggle.
---
Nothing has the toxicity of the GunZ: The Duel community. Some of the most frustratingly immature players with inflated egos.
---
They are not just toxic, most are proud and feel like their attitude is justified because it is a hard and dying game.
---
I wouldn’t mind it would keep me away from the plebs in the normal ge
---
It does more than just the bank, it also allows you to one-click harvest farm plants, use bones on the wildy altar without having to right click etc. Things like this give a significant advantage to people who use them so I can see why it can be an integrity issue. Jagex can always add in the more inocuous ones in the official client.
---
Took the words right out of my mouth. Really says a lot about the integrity of the playerbase which has never changed.
---
the cows name CmonBruh
---
You act as if Jagex couldn't POSSIBLY DO THE SAME EXACT THING.  For the amount of money that Jagex pulls in, you're telling me that they couldn't POSSIBLY have done more than a free client if they actually gave a shit?  They couldn't have POSSIBLY hired their own small team to build a new client from the ground up?
---
If a small team of people who built Runelite for free could do something 1000x better than the company that's taking our money from it, there's something really fucking wrong with that picture.  And being an apologist for them isn't helping anyone.
---
We all know damn well that Jagex could do more.  We have more from people that don't have a fraction of what Jagex works with in terms of source code and funding.  So why the fuck are you acting like the people who actually are in a significantly better spot to do more are helpless in this situation?
---
Computers cant really do "true" random, luckily it's not needed here.
---
I lost my debit card and you're telling me I need to prove who I am to get a new one? What is this
---
C++
---
Its pretty nice. I can max out at about 180fps with an R9 380 and a Ryzen 1800X according to the fps counter.
---
The wilderness is different, in pvp worlds most people bring angler, karambwans and can house telly at any point. In the wilderness almost all people tribrid since its the most effective way to fight coz you have no idea what you'll encounter and you have to bring a inventory of brews to be able to outlast your opponent or survive a team
---
Try log in into rs3
---
The problem they have with retroactively changing the requirement is that you will have people having something that isn’t obtainable anymore. 
---
Zulrah is locked behind one of the longer quest chains and then behind the combat requirements as well. 
---
Just because something can be accessed doesn’t mean it’s completable. 
---
A lvl 3 account can access barrows, should that be locked behind more?
---
A lvl 46 (correct me if I’m wrong on the level here) can get the bis melee cape. Shouldn’t that be behind a grand master quest by your standards?
---
A level 3 can get a twisted bow! Why isn’t that locked behind 120 combat and a quest cape!
---
I'm here for this
---
I would suggest the Holy Handgrenade
---
I mean they don't detect right clicks (or this seems to be accepted anyway, that it's all client side) . So if that's the case a left click is the same to them as a right click then a left click. Would apply to all the menu swappers stuff. Overlays are undetectable for obvious reasons of course.
---
Do we actually have to switch?
---
Just 3 BBD alts wouldn't, and you can run an alt while raiding too.
---
"We consider features which enable you to bypass gameplay mechanics to be unacceptable, like those which might indicate where projectiles would land, where NPCs might spawn, or which protection prayers to activate. The same can be said of features which might modify how you select actions in the game or change how you click on menus, players, or NPCs, especially where the feature leads to you using fewer clicks than you would when using our client."
---
This is so loosely phrased that could be said to include anything from puzzle solvers to scouting in COX. Both these plug-ins bypass gameplay mechanics, which they say is unacceptable. It goes without saying that they've given some examples, but the extent of this ruling is vague and confusing.
---
Also I posted that when i woke up to this shitstorm.
---
&gt; Account hijacking
---
That is probably what you're looking for.
---
Macros are essentially bots. If you only use it for a small amount of time it's minor, if you use it for a long time it's major.

He just forgot his /s you fucking walnut

Priff ge would be a place only high levels can go, wouldn't there still be a bunch of lower levels in varrock ge?

Oh yeah for sure by scamming, I guess he could be selling it for real world money or something. I think I'll stay in the 2k total worlds lol

"gone"

What a weird thing to say about someone most of us have never met personally, and can still continue to talk to on all the same platforms we did in the past.
---
He's still right there! I see him! Look ----&gt; u/JikkirWolf
---
This gives me nam flashbacks haha. I ended up fletching maple longbow (u) to 99 for the money. Never again.
---
*thinks about all the troll items in Tai Bwo Wannai Trio*
---
That’s odds of receiving it by that total. Not drop rate.
---
Because the default left click for unf potions and ingredients is already 'Use' but it's 'Bury' for bones? How are you even comparing make-all potions to MES wtf, are you saying it's the same as cook-all fish on a fire, smith-all bars at an anvil?
---
I know people defend MES but grasping ar straws by comparing apples and oranges is just really funny
---
Huh?
---
Per kill though on advg they're roughly the same.
---
Zulrahs uniques over all kc is the equivilant on vorks big unique.
---
....So tell me again why you would find someone getting hit by a car funny?
---
Also a great way to find gambling bots, beggars and trolls.

Should've just made the heraldry a giant L

im more into the hardcore stuff myself
---
all of them, I already knew them all
---
do you use last.fm by any chance?
---
&gt; the list of many many jmods jumping ship now does hint at something 
---
That the game industry has insane turnover. 6 years has to be waaaay above average, given that even most really popular games only have a 2-3 year production lifecycle.
---
Old projects ending also means new projects starting somewhere else. Makes it tempting to try your hand at one of those new things rather than spending forever at 1 company.
---
Microtransactions
---
I think you're on the wrong forum buddy. Alts =/= bots.
---
No, basically I've just listening to music on YouTube for the last 12 years.  A few recommendations from friends but otherwise I just find stuff on there.
---
You never seen a lvl 120 sell 6 cowhides huh?
---
LOL idk why ur getting downvoted, ur right. everyone is just biased in favor on RL
---
I mean to be fair gay pride/acceptance literally has no place in a medieval fantasy online RPG. To make an entire event out of it just to try and feel relevant didn’t sit right with a lot of people.
---
When a girl tells me that I am in the friend zone or that she will never see me “that way” something clicks in my mind that takes that as a personal challenge. Subconsciously my behaviour starts to change around them, almost working towards becoming the “gay best friend” within just a few weeks. After that roll has been established, I unintentionally start broaching topics like what they like, how they want to be treated, and the special “gay friend” card comes into play when they tell me their sexual preferences. While it’s not necessarily always an act, I start to portray their favourite characteristics. While I’m around them, my being changes into the type of person they want not only romantically, but sexually as well.
---
Most recently, I had a friend of mine [21F] tell me she didn’t see me “that way”. She is in a relationship but that didn’t stop the subtle changes in my behaviour to rise to the challenge. Within 4 weeks I was her best friend, and 2 weeks later I received my first nudes from her. I feel like I should feel some form of guilt around the fact that she is in a relationship, but when she starts begging me to mess around with her (and sometimes her and her friend [21F]) I feel nothing but pride and a sense of accomplishment.
---
Not regularly.
---
Those bots are unique very very very unique.
---
Agility has a extremely high ban rate.
---
Also 3 quests compared to what 200 quest points and a quest thats harder than the entire story line of the elves to unlock zulrah?
---
To unlock vork while needing high requirements.
---
Barrows bots exist already and are just combat but the stuff to speed up trips and boost rewards is locked behind a lot of content.
---
Seriously. Peoples' inability to comprehend the fact that it's *still an answer* are baffling me. Not every answer is going to be a "Yes everything is fine," or "no we are outright banning third party clients."
---
The level of density in this community sometimes blows me away.
---
if it's to good to be true it probably is
---
You can hit 48-48 in PvP. [Lagunarium/ThePureSeb hit 48-48 in PvP worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrLa1TJtAM) within a day of the release of the Basilisk Jaw.
---
i cant , the password was generated by the device and i dindt write it down
---
and that device(cell phone) is totally fucked
---
just go to a 1.5k or 2k total world, never any bots or spam there
---
I see those gold buying sites in your tabs 👀
---
The OSbuddy client started offering ridiculous options like one-click blackjacking. 
---
Jagex has released a statement about how these are not allowed and are bannable, but it's more toothless than the guy who got fifty loop halfs in a row. Community is pretty sure Jagex has no way to detect these things being used, so the sum total of that statement is basically "Please don't"
---
I'll see my way out.
---
Went to the house by the chaos elemental today. Forgot the clue. I just sat there for a second disappointed in myself.
---
I appreciate all the advice. I actually already have full armadyl dhide. I got the sweets and dragon darts but now I'm just really wondering; is Veracs helm and skirt going to be better than my armadyl? there's a pretty big tradeoff in range atk bonus.  
---
Also, I don't get why I'd use guthans if Im not getting the set effect?
---
It really do be that way
---
Ah, les sapeurs
---
Fucking hell that scythe wielding Cunt cut my nuts off more times than I’d care to remember.
---
That’s the point of it...
---
why have I seen several cats in mage gear on this sub but never range/melee
---
I guess people associate cats with magic?
---
Vanilla client is trash wtf are y’all on
---
I guess the difference is the Old School team have made it pretty clear they have no intention of introducing EOC or going down the same path as RS3
---
This is what Jagex intended with EOC.
---
  [https://runescape.wiki/w/Evolution\_of\_Combat#Intentions](https://runescape.wiki/w/Evolution_of_Combat#Intentions) 
---
&gt;Jagex introduced the Evolution of Combat for many reasons, some of which were:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;To balance out the combat triangle. Previously, [melee](https://runescape.wiki/w/Melee) was much more powerful in most cases when compared to [Ranged](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ranged) and [Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magic)[\[3\]](https://runescape.wiki/w/Evolution_of_Combat#cite_note-blogfinal-3)  
---
&gt;To make the combat system "more fluid, interactive and exciting for everyone"[\[1\]](https://runescape.wiki/w/Evolution_of_Combat#cite_note-11may-1)  
---
&gt;To refocus combat to be more about player skill[\[4\]](https://runescape.wiki/w/Evolution_of_Combat#cite_note-blogeoc-4)  
---
&gt;To encourage a variety in combat equipment[\[4\]](https://runescape.wiki/w/Evolution_of_Combat#cite_note-blogeoc-4)
---
The Old School team are facing those same issues and for the most part but they are trying to deal with them it a way that doesn't compromise the integrity of the Old School feel. 
---
If you look at some of the new bosses, there's a lot more mechanics invloved. Compare something like Arma where it's pretty much tank and spank to something like the Alchemical Hydra where you have more interesting mechanics to work with. Then something like Olm or theatre of blood where there's a lot more skill involved.
---
Balancing the combat triangle is probably the biggest issue they face but they have talked about ways they can fix it while still keeping the integrity of the combat system. E.G. thoughts of nerfing dhide.
---
The other thing someone else mentioned is the dev team is a lot more connected to the community today than back then. They **KNOW** if they did something like EOC, they would lose a massive part of their player base **again**. But if it ever did get to that stage, it's probably game over anyway.
---
if you enjoy bossing, you could make your alt into another main so that you can dolo (duo with yourself)
---
getting stats for DS2 would let you afk rune drags while you play on your main, or you could get 77 slayer for a brutal black dragon alt if you don't want to do that many quests
---
After the 3PC outrage Jagex decided to get back at us by removing the instanced Vorkath area from all worlds so now there is one spot (single) and you have to go in 1 by 1, get one kill and then back to the end of the line.
---
Running 3 alt accounts as a method but you're lazy... Hmmmm ;)
---
More like Jagex management is atrocious and that it's only a matter of time til osrs dies and everyone just plays wow classic
---
People offer 2147 tokens to think you're getting a max cash stack which is really 2147k for max
---
They won't have to ban anyone unless there's egregious abuse by certain plugins and players.  Their play is to simply force 3rd party clients to form around what they feel necessary until the vanilla client is updated up to the "standard" or issue cease and desist legalities to 3rd party clients if they don't work around what Jagex deems fair and even play for all
---
Damn, sucks that I play vanilla
---
That's not true at all plenty of auto clickers are fairly advanced. There are several that you can set the click to occur randomly in a specific area and also set it to occur within a time range. 
---
So it literally looks like a person clicking alch at slightly different speeds and a slightly different area every single time.
---
Some of it is a meme and some of it Is just being overly protective
---
instant 6 mil xp, but the drop is so rare that its practically impossible
---
Some games listen to their community, no need to call me ignorant or anything. Just chill man
---
he's keeping it for himself
---
This is an MMO. Better yet a top down point and click MMO that was originally a browser game. They live for lengthy grinds and worthwhile rewards with character progression. That's part of their design.
---
To ignore that and say "well you should just make the game fun and then people will play it just for fun and you don't need to 'ruin it' with progression and updates" is naive and short sighted.
---
Even games I consider incredibly fun only stay that way for a while. Eventually the magic fades and the core gameplay loop becomes repetitive. When there is nothing else to work for, you lose interest. There's always another game after all. That's a good way especially to kill an RPG. No long term goals and things to work for? My character never progresses and gets stronger past a certain point? I'll lose interest after that point then. Doesn't make it a bad game, but more likely a singleplayer focused one that will come out with a sequel in a few years. 
---
It will get 50-100 hours out of me and that's worth the $60 price tag. Now a $15 a month always persistent character based MMO pulling that strategy? It's bound to fail.
---
You seem to provoke this discussion but are turning your head and going "well actually" to people bringing legitimate criticism to your opinion. You're welcome to have your opinion by all means, as am I. But I'm glad our game is progressing and being updated, because it means it won't die due to stagnating. It very well will eventually become a game that's barely played or not played at all. Even the greatest games of all time hit that wall and start to decline (literally WoW is a great example). But I'll have had a decade or more of fun times before then, rather than a quick stint at a nostalgia hit and then disinterest.
---
It's only swapping one thing, the first knockout click. If you have attack NPC turned off then "pickpocket" is currently already a left click when they're knocked out.
---
Animation smoothing / rune pouch plugin don't belong in this list
---
But dc is just too strong. I understand for something like raids2 but not here
---
Green rock bad
---
*Imagine being that late game and not already 99 Cooking.*
---
Red chins are perfectly fine.
---
Minor Update : Missed a plugin called "Timers" includes potion/buff durations etc.
---
how do you manage 75 kills a trip? i can rarely get  50...
---
I think it should have some way of discouraging bots and be better money than vorkath. Vorkath is way easier to me
---
Not sure why cooking and fletching are separate from buyables
---
do I have to unlock basilisk task to get it from vannaka? or he has them by default?
---
You should at least give pking a go. Pking big loots from real players is alot more fun to me imo then just killing a monster that never deviates hundreds of times for an item you know you arw going to get eventually
---
weedcop420 is a known cutie
---
I didn't, that was more than one trip
---
&gt;let’s just be realistic 
---
No, being realistic was exactly what he said.
---
They already discussed this during the Q&amp;A, I think the one just before it came out. Iirc they don't want people being forced to try it and just leeching it like cw to complete the log.
---
Why in the god damn has the price of blood runes dropped? I swear every money maker I start turns to shit. I know Zalcano came out that caused them to dip but they've gone from 330ish to 300 now. Is it because of OSbuddy? Are there just loads more people crafting them?
---
I had the opposite thought, I was kind of ready to write off settled as post-peak since he had been putting out so few videos but this one with the rcb kind of reignited the spark for the rest of the series
---
Guessing the boss fight?
---
Or you can just go back to RS3
---
&gt;One click banker is nothing like 1 click construction.
---
It's the same thing.
---
You junkies keep bringing it up so i see no problem in me saying "dude weed lmao"
---
It's not that bad. It's got uhh.. a map
---
It would be that the RS3 NXT client is c++.
---
People here say it has its flaws, but it's also much less limited
---
Get this man a medal
---
What if the point of a C++ client? If they keep the graphics the same there would be no performance difference compared to GPU rendering (see runelite).
---
Thanks for the deeply thought our response!
---
Never cared for him. First time I'm hearing he's leaving. Thank you for the chuckle.
---
As someone whos main was on RS3 for 15 years before switching to OSRS this summer, do not do this, it will only fracture and create dead worlds, RS3 feels very very dead because the community flocks to different hubs, Ge, Priff, max guild, etc.
---
I gladly trade to spam to get everyone back to the GE in RS3
---
Not sad about this one. 🦀🦀🦀
---
Have you seen How all the trees around gielinor are swarmed in f2p... fuck this shit
---
They did that, it sucked and they scrapped it.
---
It wasn't that the client itself wasn't viable, but the very much required anti-cheating systems weren't capable of running smoothly on HTML5.
---
Rs3 Jmods already said they regret having a Priff GE
---
This is true, you can’t play the game unless your 1foot from the screen.
---
🦀🦀 JMODS WONT RESPOND TO THIS THREAD

what are you talking about just slap some hair on that bad boy and your done!

I actually forgot that smite was the best prayer until I saw this

What’s an easy way to raise ranged, magic and fishing?

not to scare you but i had something like this happen to me but with a reddit account. thats why i never use generated passwords. id try to correspond with customer support. best of luck!

ash leaves -&gt; game dies =/= game dies -&gt; ash leaves

Imagine voting no to something because "its easy scape" &amp; then playing on a third party client with a bunch of plug-ins, we didn't need them back then why does everyone feel we do now?

The problem is once you know the ticks and what can and cant happen, you only die when you make a mistake. The only place that needs what you suggested would be multi main pking
---
I'm sure atlas was very affected by the community
---
You know jagex can't detect any of it lol
---
No, now it ends!
---
Yeah I know, I was being /s

Player indicators for multi pking. I am not going back to right clicking 10 times a second.

Damn you even have sparc mac in the comments calling out these people

That’s definitely the answer I wanted, so some crazy grind paired with genuine enthusiasm and not having a brick wall personality, noted.
---
Lmfao hope I don’t have a brick wall personality
---
yall forgot the tree inbetwwen:/ (downvote)
---
So, guess I’ll be getting 99 construction and thieving now, since the rules haven’t changed. I may or may not get banned. It’s 50/50 chance.
---
What's a ninja team lol
---
If you have over 175qp do it, you'll only receive a 2 day ban.
---
A cold one and his gang of boys already did a Swampletics gear only TOB. Chriskies just did a solo in basically guthans only + ancient magic.
---
TOB is definitely doable with just ruby bolts.
---
As much as this is a cool post, you linked the worng wiki. The official osrs wiki is available [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) as it moved away from fandom quite some time ago
---
Just FYI, your reward % only affects how many runes etc you get.
---
Your chances of getting an item depend only on how many brothers you kill, it's not affected by killing skeletons/worms etc.

Menu entry swapper to bank/GE (and I only use it to bank/GE) is one of my favourite features. It's a much needed QoL - except in rare occasions to manage Pin features, nobody actually needs to talk to banking NPCs, and I would honestly like to know if it's being removed from Runelite and if you're going to get banned for using it/if it's detectable. Playing without it isn't gamebreaking, but it's just so much more frustrating doing general things where you're doing a lot of running around and if that extra one right click or trying to click exactly on the bank booth is nowhere near the same league as chaos altar bones or such.
---
I'm not too knowledgeable about technical things, so i'm trying to ask a legitimate question, not fearmonger.

I’m addicted to masturbation. I haven’t played rs in weeks tho

So make this spot rs3?

What's the point of using anything else when one thing is just the best?

What's the point if having a combat triangle when one of the three is just better than the other two?

But if EoC is the sole thing that killed RS3 why aren't we letting other things that aren't EoC into the game?

Ardougne Cloak farm teleport, Desert Amulet teleport
---
Well might as well ban everyone at Demonics, WE GUILTY lmao
---
Has there been a recent mass ban or something then? Tbh I dont take notice of bots/players
---
I'm on mobile and today they released the resizable sidebars that was announced yesterday, but does anyone know how to do change that? It's readjusted on my phone and looks horrible
---
So its okay to have ranged be OP and have the game's combat system be unbalanced but it's not okay to allow a new skill into the game?
---
That's where things get ruined.
---
Pre ToB content is literally just smithing and xp farming with a few clue attempts. It will be a very boring video compared to this one. ToB content will probs be one or two episodes.
---
I wanted to die after a day of the b2p grind lol fuck going back
---
Good then. Let the game stay good, don't let them screw it up like what happened with this one.
---
At 90 range, 300 kc, I had 1:15 as my best which was done with blowpipe. I'm now at 94 range, 1300 kc and majority of them was done with DHCB and just a few days ago I made a new personal record at 1:12. Both setups were BIS except ward and boots, so I would say it's extreme luck, especially with bolt specs as my new record was done without speccing ruby or dia, I just got lucky and almost all shots did hit with 60+. And yes, I drink and eat only inside acid/spawn phases. Average 4 kills per trip, but sometimes you get those 3 minute kills anyway.
---
Bring 1 guthix rest
---
FUCK NO

except that isn't runelite what is behind of vanilla client.

Yeah, sometimes I kinda forget and barely move out of the way.

Advg xp rates and time required.

But yes you could in a optimal situation complete it much quicker, but I'm unaware of the methods of bots so I went with advg xp rates.

---
 ##it is not hard to get your ip if you're in a Discord server
---
Guess we gotta keep our fingers crossed
---
ofc. a change like that would be huge. jagex has been aware of scouting and ashe specifically has said theyre capable of blocking clients from displaying the raids1 instanced map if they wanted to.
---
all functions are still aloud, they can't track what you use period unless you are sharing screen shots/live streaming using said plug ins.
---
I absolutely love the Mat K memes. They get me every time
---
american ownership is barely better than chinese ownership though
---
It's hilarious how they said it was impossible to have all the filtered game messages be toggleable and just shot it down. Anyone who knows even a little bit of programming knows that it is possible they are just lazy and complacent.
---
The annoying thing is that runelite will probably completely remove the menu entry swapper to comply with the announcement, whereas OSBuddy and most of the other third party clients will simply ignore it.
---
you can still use any plug in you like, none of the clients send packets from the client to a jagex server so they literally cant detect what you are using or when.  Dont take screen shots using said plug ins, dont live stream using said plug ins, that is the only way they could ban you.
---
Anyone have a  TL;DR for us who are working? Thanks guys,

That was hard as fuck

1. You didn’t mention social engineering anywhere in this post. 
---
2. As someone who “consults on internet security” to then talk about getting hacked is kinda sad that you lack the basic ability to secure a runescape account. 
---
Don’t bother responding you’re making yourself look stupid
---
No, people doing stupid things is funny when it's abstracted from misery. If you think it's funny because get severely injured you need to seek medical help.
---
I love how in other games people make fun of others for being less skilled but in OSRS people get made fun of for liking a different amount of frames in a choppy animation.
---
Literally who.
---
Lol bruh
---
Possible, but highly unlikely. It would be immensely controversial were they to do that
---
For real? Wtf

Everyone posting in this post is obviously all in the same clan working on removing GP from people's bank.

I hope no one falls for your awfully thought out plan.

You're way too serious lmao, do I really need to type /s to every obvious joke these days? Geez
---
Get the brestplate stretcha’!
---
Isn't it a bit rich asking for info about my rs  account after your previous names
---
I won't use OSB whatsoever, but I wouldn't say no if some of those features were polled to come to vanilla, particularly the construction one.
---
Same here. 1 month back into the game my old character got blown out of the water. I couldnt get to 60 combat stats before and I hit 80 ranged the other day just playing at work once in a while
---
I usually feel worse, seeing how the series has gotten progressively worse. It's insane that I can feel nostalgia for videos that are only a few months old.
---
10 hours a day of zeah
---
Reported for account sharing!!!!!!! (just joking)
---
I fucking agree bro 100%
---
No, the GE is a social gathering spot. Making another GE in a grandmaster-quest locked area serves no purpose. If Jagex would just do a better job at banning scammers and some spammers, we wouldn't have to get away.
---
I was planning to talk to you in rs... since you know we both play said game. 
---
And what previous names? Will da ork and Ghrazkul? What's the problem with those?
---
Unless my maths is cooked, this is actually 1/3,111,696 ... ouch

How the fuck is that an a? Always thought that when i see this meme i just cannot see it
---
Demonic Gorillas are awful even with the plugin, I can't imagine how bad they will be without it
---
i mean blood runes are almost completely afk.

I'm curious, he said in the video the dude who found it was getting 1B gp, did he actually give that guy that much???

Lol theyll have to ban me before i quit using it
---
'The developer of RuneLite has worked closely with Jagex before and  removed the plugins they don’t want, so (and this may be ignorant of me)  I’m trusting that relationship will continue amidst this outcome'
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
BTW, wouldnt depend on this anymore.
---
RL Dev has already said multiple times that since OSB Matt added his OP plugins and started this madness, that Jagex refuse to talk to him anymore and arent giving him the time of day.
---
He has pinged Jagex mods on Discord to talk to them and get confirmation etc but theyre just blanking him.
---
So who knows at this point.
---
the reward potential I see (might be a runelite feature) only increases after the death animation finishes, so I make sure to wait before looting
---
Dude that post couldn't possibly have been more vague about exactly what people should do/not do regarding third party clients if they want to avoid being banned. 
---
After reading the whole thing I have absolutely no fuckin clue what Runelite plugins are safe, which I should turn off, or if I'm better off just not using Runelite at all.
---
Lava dragons are pretty good nowadays. Safespot on the southeastern side and bring a looting bag. Be vigilant and log out whenever you see a white dot. If you have the hard wildy done and can boost up to 75 agility, that shortcut can save your life from pkers. However, they don’t seem to frequent that area too much nowadays. Just bank often

---
Wait... we arent all jarkal?
---
Can confirm it is, I'm a full on noob. Only ever had f2p and watched youtubers play and I really enjoyed this series. He basically baby steps you through what hes doing so nothing is confusing too
---
He deserves at least this much recognition for the amount of effort he put into the game. The level of determination to progress in the game locked in the swamp is borderline mind breaking.
---
read it then takes 30 seconds. wouldnt say it has anything to do with legality
---
I agree with you, just finished doing steams to 77, and I enjoyed that more because of how intensive it was. Felt really satisfying to make progress.

Ouff not a morning person are we?  Like I said just a thought that be cool
---
Should have made osrs black and white
---
The 1-click features have existed for something like 3 years now. The outrage came because the most known 3rd party client added them to the free version.
---
Bots not being banned != Barely having bots... Also, if suddenly all the bots leave your game following a significant decrease in player count over a few years that's a bit of an issue.
---
Except it does for people that don't know how to do it because it quite literally tells you where to stand and what to pray.
---
"easily"
---
No shit.

If there was no OSRS he would have nothing to do temple trekking on man

if you actually like him youre pretty retarded.
---
Humans click with a left skewed Gaussian distribution. this also goes for basically anything that people do, many devs make the mistake of thinking because it seems like a person randomly clicks something its random
---
Ie, the way a person clicks a bank wouldn't be a random distribution of the clickbox, but more likley a normalized Gaussian curve of the X pos / Y pos around the center of the visible object
---
What's your point?
---
It’s not a morning for me my dude and besides i love mornings
---
I use rl
---
that's true but to simply compare player counts is a bit disingenuous. No one bots RS3 because there's nothing worth botting since RS3 is pretty dead + they have very good bot detection. The creator of RSbuddy built the RS3 botwatch system
---
I think after you die you just turn into a normal ironman
---
Waterfall, tree gnome village, fight pit.
---
They check the source first and a Jmod probably watches Settled.
---
where is rol lol
---
Yeah man I guess we should thank Settleds dad for not pulling out aswell then.
---
Clip of matK saying that about menu swappers? Ive got a hard time believing they cant detect less clicks for an action. If he said about overlays thats different
---
He literally paid a $50M fine for a meme.
---
If you go by what Jagex states (i.e. that RS3 not detection is decent) then you'd also believe that most osrs bots are banned on tutorial island and the average life is less than a day. So the massive bot bans in osrs are pretty early (so they wouldn't influence the player count much at all).
---
There are a lot of bots in RS3, they just do it in instances usually. It blew my mind when I found out that there are high enrage Telos bots.
---
tbh they are stuck b/w a rock and hard place . ancient shitty code ,ancient engine ,ancient java.
---
I lost my 1 mil cash stack on my Ironman I earned from Wintertodt, logging out unsafely and accidentally dying and not checking back until 3 hours later

Ill add you bro im always down for bandos.

Does that include pets or do they not count pets when saying they completed GWD?

Dont you dare spoil anything. I am still on the Ringed City, I only beaten Demon Prince thus far, and if you ruin this for me I will devour your fucking cock.
---
Looks like an iron crossbow to me. Though I understand the reference.
---
whats so confusing in their statement?
---
if you have iq more than 80 you would understand what they mean and you would also understand that they cant tell specifically what plugins are forbidden, because people would abuse that information
---
98 Slayer. 5.7k Zulrah pre nerf. 1k CoX. Did ToB on release. Now I’m a btw since main was banned after swapping gold to my friends rs3 acc.

---
do germans always masturbate when creating names?
---
Sweet, I'm gonna keep an eye out for something similar! And grats on the exp helper haha
---
OP - think you're hearing him backwards..  
---
He's saying that he couldn't think of one that they couldn't detect.... As in they are all detectable.
---
Dude read between the lines. They dont like it, but they cant detect it, so they said 'pls don't', but it's effectively allowed.
---
You shouldn't be asking them to make allowed/not allowed statements, you should be asking them to add the functionality into the vanilla client.
---
It wouldn't, the Chinese are just ludicrously greedy because they have to pay debts.
---
Thank you, good luck!
---
How come you deleted your comment I just finished writing a reply to it :/
---
Why haven't you used the player support feature. Their response is much faster...
---
They also knew EoC and MTX would kill RS3 but they still did that.
---
It's perfect that Mat listens to dad rock on stream
---
they probably had no idea until the video came out.
---
i think this guy was referring strictly to RS3, and asking him to take out the MTX which is all that is keeping that game alive
---
Yet he died to fucking smoke devils.
---
rip
---
Because they cant ban them and simultaneously refuse to invest in ability to detect them, and refuse to add this demanded functionality into the vanilla client, so they are leaving it be because acting without suitable compromise with the playerbase will harm the game. 
---
For now we should be pressing them to add to the vanilla client to the point where it can compete, and then once the vanilla client is up to par, we should allow the 3rd party client debate.
---
Sadly, that’s common at many companies. 
---
I’m currently shopping around and the salary ranges for senior devs are wildly different compared to my gf in marketing.
---
So you run a lap, then wait 3 mins before you start the next lap?

But what's hard about right clicking that people need to essentially mod their gameplay

Guess we learn how to play an ez right clicking simulator.
---
Yeah but you know when u hop worlds cause your doing slayer or bossing or doing a clue step in wild and see a white dot. So when u go to the ge and you see "xXx\_RNGBOT6969420\_xXX" spamming his dice game it gets kinda annoying
---
he will die and will lose all his stuff... We've all been there.. He needs to go through the relevant processes to truly understand what Runescape is.
---
It's almost like he leaned in closer to a computer screen that gives off blue light.
---
This is not the first.

No diary cape yet. not paying for the extortion at barbarian assault since I don't do clues often enough

Best part about doing a few days of ZMI is not realizing all the random high level runes piling up in your bank
---
its against the rules to use menu entry swapper. it has always been against the rules, but most people in the know say they cant detect it so do what you feel is right
---

---
It's not crazy to see people in genuine distress lose blood to their extremeties. It's why you hear the expression "You're pale as a ghost, something spook you?". It's a real thing.
---
Aufrichtig means honest or trustworthy in German.
---
Since you clearly know what the statement means. Are they talking about the controversial "making lava runes by clicking the altar without having to use your rune on it" method?
---
Cause I think the altar part is about that. Not about using bones on an altar...
---
And this is only one thing. Do people have to test everything on vanilla first to know if it's a plugin on rl or osbuddy? I dont even know if the shift emty rune pouches is a plugin or a game feature...
---
It may seem like you’re broke now and you want to have money for gear now, but if you’ve got the basics of combat gear, you really won’t regret sticking with slayer, you’re getting close to where it starts to get fairly profitable actually. The slayer monsters you unlock later on will be way better for camping for gp than anything you can do now. If you are going to do dragons or something for gp for upgrades the only thing I would prioritize is black mask (imbued) if you don’t already have it, then go back to slayer. Also you might as well do Nmz too if your doing something else and can just afk it, but doing nmz during your “active” gaming hours is pretty boring. Higher stats means faster slayer levels so it’s always good.

Confusing double negative there

I was killing Basilisk Knights the other day and he was there ranging them. At one point he was killing two at a time and hogging them. Karma is a bitch.
---
Jagex doesn't get it both ways. They don't want people to bot, so they make the game a bit more bearable. Then Jagex is like nah, cancer training only. If you don't have permanent wrist and eye damage from carpal tunnel and chronic eye strain you aren't playing the game correctly.
---
Anyone using this client has just told Jagex to fuck off because the plugins are 100% unbannable anyway.
---

Any news if hes making a new HC?

Nope

Same but the boys seem to think its ight so i thi k im going to co tinue using they said they would give warning before ban aswell if i remember correctly.

Lol, I love how people think that if they downvote someone, then they must be wrong XD I still think priff ge would be a good idea
---
Absolute hero, I've been told by loads of people it's on the original client but I'm totally doing this when I get home, finally go hunting for zenyte numero 3
---
Gah damn that’s rough
---
This is pretty cool, I think it would be a lot of fun to have that experience with a son or with my father when I was a kid. My only advice is to limit his play time. When I was a kid I was addicted to this game and a couple of others. I would play for up to 8 hours a day when I could and that is my only regret from my childhood/teen years. Not saying you and your kid are like this, but I feel like I have to say this because of how much time we all spend on screens now. I still think it's super cool to have another way to spend quality time with someone you love.
---
It's a one out of 216 if you are looking for any combination of the same 4 runes, but it's 1296 for this specific combination of four
---
The only other thing I can possibly think of is that they have a bunch of macros they use and they keep using the wrong ones.
---
That didn't address the reply.
---
He could have just drawn a lucky impling with a Cbow. Not once did the post ever say he got it
---
Melee is terrible at Barrows, that’s why. Ibans blast absolutely wrecks them and you will definitely want higher magic for other content. I comment in another part about going back to slayer but barrows is a fun and profitable option for mid levels, 50-60 magic would be a good starting place
---
I don't play runescape anymore

There is a strange amount of variety in these...vices?

Love the guy who "on a random note" looking for friends to add :D
---
This account is less than two months old and just got its 7th skillcape. I would hardly call that a lack of progress. You can call me a brainlet if I haven't hit 2,000 total by the time my 6 month mark rolls around.

Instead of adding an ornament kit, they will add a breastplate stretcher

Things I dislike: having to right click every loot pile to see all the drops clearly, having to manually look up a players name if I wanted to see their stats, not having gpu acceleration with options to make the game look nicer. 
---
I mean you can play on the vanilla client just fine, but once you go 3rd party you can't go back, it's just that much nicer.

That’s literally what I said

Would also enjoy playing anything else besides a human, like a nerd cave goblin or a regular goblin, or even an orc or skeleton (as a shapdshift from makeover mage, not a race itself for lore and game play reasons)
---
I never botted i still even use vanilla client. I have no f@&amp;$ing idea how I was hacked. I can see on his cores that whoever hacked me is still playing my account and training strength. I’m an honest player I’ve never had a 99 on any account and I’ve been playing since 2006.
---
No it’s bold and we need people like that these days!!
---
Ah, an elitist efficiencyscaper. I guess it really bothers you to know that some of us play the game for fun and to relax.

So can we use Runelite?

Can you add that absolutely horrible Mammoth mask that was suggested ages ago?

---
I must've missed that... Got a link?
---
Upvoted. It makes zero sense for such a profitable activity to have so few requirements. I honestly don't see how anyone could be against this. As you said the time spent doing the requirements will very quickly pay for itself through the increase in profitability due to far less botting.
---
A thousand upvotes sirrah!

The true hero OSRS deserves and needs.
---
I wouldn’t really do ranarrs at a low farming level, it was hit or miss for me when I did it at low level. I would do a few cheap fruit tree runs and level up for toadflax then Avantoe  finally going to snapdragon or ranarr when you are 60+ farming with ultracompost and as many of the disease free patches as possible (hosidius, troll stronghold, Weiss, harmony island). As for hops, yanillian is pretty good. I actually pair it with a birdhouse house run with digsite pendant followed by giant seaweed and cactus to finish.

The boots and ring switch are overkill too, esp for a learner. I didn't notice it at first but he brought an 8-way range switch.

Calling all 3pc "cheat clients" is absurd. The plug-ins need to be assessed individually to determine whether they are "cheating". You can sit up on your high-horse all day long playing vanilla, but at the end of the day it's just a way of making yourself feel a little bit bigger than the next person. Jagex has not claimed runelite to be a "cheat client", so labeling it that yourself is half-witted arrogance at best. There are plenty of people using 3pc for tile markers, animation smoothing, and many other plug-ins that do not provide an unfair advantage. Most 3pc users I know are ASKING what is okay so that they arent breaking the rules by choosing to play on a different client. You don't get to arbitrarily decide what is cheating and what is not. You aren't jagex, you aren't a mod, and you damn sure dont write the rule book for the game.

Ahhh yes, the 2001 classic gameplay. Banks only store coins. And it's full world pvp, you choose to be a pvper or a safe player.

It's not so bad. It's boring, but it should only take you ~3 hours or so to be honest.

It’s slow and highly repetitive but can be done in about 3 hours. A silver lining is that you’re getting some mage exp on the side and it’s definitely worth it for the diary.

This response was not good, nor was it accurate, and it's something we flagged to the Support team.
---
There isn't a 14 day response time for account security issues. There looks to have been confusion here with the response time for [account ban appeals](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002238729-Account-Bans). 
---
The response time for account security issues is a matter of minutes to hours, not days to weeks.
---
About 5 hours of tedium... Lumby Diaries are pretty great though, so I don't regret it.
---
Wait, seriously?

I've been putting off lumby diary because I really really don't wanna quest and was using the (what I thought was an) abysmally long grind of getting bones to peaches to justify my unwillingness to quest... But it's only 3 hours?

You seem to have no idea how much effort it is to teach a new player all rooms, have them die 20 times etc completely for free. I get you just wanted to do the diary but I still don't see why you take all this for granted. Did you at least watch a proper guide?
---
some peopke pointed out d claws would b more beneficial for regular slay, considering this would u still say d hammer is better overall?
---
&gt;cheat client
---
I can tell you never trained anything but slayer lol
---
Rl had a menu entry swapper, you cant use that anymore
---
You must be a fun person.
---
4 dds specs is slightly higher dps than 2 claw specs + 2 whip hits against low def (eg. slayer) targets. Assuming you have at least cmb brace, glory, and drag def. Since no whip, pretty sure claws won't be worth.  
---
I would only recommend getting either if it's for bosses, with the warhammer generally having more uses. Is your other equipment already BiS for your stats?  
---
You'd probably benefit more from flipping with said cash than getting a spec weapon. You might also be interested in rigour at some point - rigour + bp is about the same dps as maxed rapier + piety at many places.

For ironman it's one of the better ways. Since you don't get God swords or wildy items nearly as soon as you can get veracs.

Unlikely, very unlikely, yeah. But you stated "no one", to which I provided an explicit counter example.

I don't know why people think the game has nowhere to go as if devaluing old content for the sake of progression can't be done. Bandos, armadyl etc doesn't need to remain bis droppers forever tier 80/85/90 etc gear can be introduced and gwd and such can become mid tier content or dead content without killing the game. Like you said the game is barely recognizable in comparison to where we started so why not.
---
I'd like to be optimistic and think they'd never add any MTX outside of bonds because that would tank the game 100% but I am getting the feeling they almost are that out of touch.

Haha
---
I guess in the sense that he makes progress videos of an account the comparison can be made, but you could then make that comparison to the vast majority of OSRS content creators since the point of the game is to improve your account. What Settled has going for him is he really puts his time and effort into creating a quality video rather than pumping out a 10 minute video every other day for the ad revenue, which a lot of content creators including A Friend do.

I do have 3rd age range and robe top, Imbued rings (all 3), torture necklace, neck of anguish, ds2 backpack, barrow gloves, fighter torso, no inferno/fire cape tho, but As I said I plan on using ds2 backpack or mythical cape for crush bonus. I also have imbued heart for mage if needed

Yes, they gathered it together in a pool and have been dispensing the GP with each catch.  It boggles the mind, but I suppose it's not surprising for what is currently the largest content producer in OSRS.

Your woox walk looks pretty amazing. No idea how to do that. Whenever he spits the acid i click 2squares away from me to not get damaged. I tried to do like you did but i always get hit when i move 1 square further. I guess it will come on its own with more practise. Im just over 200kc.
---
upvoted for visibility my friend. awaiting for Jmod smackdown. to the top!
---
wut
---
Can you actually ready what I said before assuming an entire argument? Most of the forks of RuneLite are malicious. RuneLite+'s entire point is that it adds plugins that jagex has asked RuneLite to remove. RuneLite itself might be fine, but that doesn't change the fact that there are malicious forks of it everywhere
---
OOTL - what's the new mechanic?
---
Watch a guide, I'll let you know what my tips are after I get good at soloing lol.

Stop, I can only cum so much
---
Desert vampires.. that’s some Blade shit and that shit was gud
---
You could actually gather enough of those seals, stick them on the ends of the dragon 2h and bench press them.
---
That's a good point. You would probably see the worlds thin out more evenly rather than end up all on the defaults, and people would swarm to all the banks close to a tele, like lunar isle
---
Fact
---
I think the game will last as long as they keep up challenging content and mitigate power creep.
---
Raids 1 and 2 each provide unique challenges with different strategies needed while also being able to be done in similar gear with slight item changes.
---
I’m a big fan of the idea of raid sets/items that would be untradable and provide decent bonuses outside of raids but buffs inside of them.  These would drop alongside tradable uniques so raids would still be worth doing for financial gain.  While these would make each raid “easier,” each raid would still be doable in bandos/void/etc.  Doing this would allow them to still be able to introduce new gear to grind for while reducing power creep allowing gear outside of raids to still be viable options.
---

Yeah, and RC let's you craft bloods and agility gives you shortcuts, but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful to train.

It would actually be 12,000gp an hour

Ditch zerker ma2 tassy peg for solos imo

Because anything much stronger than the current bis would have off the scale power levels and that’s too op

If you have a Razer keyboard you can download their software. It's very easy to configure the buttons and to hop between different profiles.

Nah, you worded it fine. Other dude's either joking or doesn't have any reading comprehension.

Not 1 click blackjacking that’s for sure
---
I don't want to hear someone who uses third-party clients complain about anything.
---
50% chance of being used per time aka every use uses 0.5 bone on average.
---
252 xp per dragon bone normally -&gt; 252 / 0.5 = 504
---
The drop was 12k iirc, 12/1.5 = 8k/hr.
---
Why would/do people go through all that for an osrs account?
---
I've wondered this too
---
still dont get it
---
Everyone saying 5 or 10 years but why how are you coming up with that number? Seems arbitrary give some reasons or something for the specific number
---
Didn't know btw.
---
Then I guess your memory is just bad? Early RS was people playing through the browser.
---
Just so you know, your run energy recharge rate only improves every 6 levels (6, 12, 18, 24, etc). That means that 77 is the exact same as 72, but 78 will make a difference (for example). Good to keep in mind when you're deciding what level you want to end up at.
---
&gt;iconic
---
 Well, yes, but actually no.
---
It's already negative QOL month with jagex banning menu entry swapper on runelite, wow left clicking a banker to bank is so op!
---
Yes, because you already mastered it? Did you even read what I wrote?
---
Good job you missed the point by a mile
---
Menu entry swapper is against the rules now but there's no way for them to tell if you're using one, same with overlays. Just keep playing like you always do. Runelite devs might remove the plugin but other clients will still have it.
---
Get it? Because the number 69 is funny
---
Why u stand in line? Its a instance?

I don't think I ever have personally

When they came out with COX, they probably assumed the randomness of each raid being different would add to the fun.  I'm sure they didn't intend for scouting to be a thing so that you could more efficiently grind it.  To be sure, I would ask a mod as I don't remember scouting being in the blog
---
Ok but only if it's BIS mass
---
damn lol my first abby task I ever did and I got 2 whips on that single task.
---
While I'd like to see higher HP pools, I don't see it happening. I've posted a suggestion about it in the past and people didn't seem in favour of the idea.
---
I've been thinking about a defensive alternative to Vengeance (sharing the same 30s cooldown so the player would have to choose), one that reduces the next received attack's damage by 30-60% (or reduces it to 1 if the attack was correctly prayed against). I wonder if that could work instead?
---
Why? It's fewer clicks for an action than someone who plays on the official client. Until they change the official client, what about that doesn't make sense?
---
Way to yoink this from West lol
---
If you're using oak planks the cost from 83 to 99 is equivalent to 131k tabs or with mahogany 276k tabs.
---
The average is 6 hours axtually

I used 4 when I did astrals from 82-86
---
Nah
---
I’m already 80+ RC. Those days of cancer are behind me. I was talking about the fill/empty options being (default) left click. I’m aware there are clients that can do this via... questionable... menu swaps.
---
When classic was still around there were maybe 200 (a good portion being bots as Jagex removed bot detection from classic) people playing at any given time. Super tight-knit community but otherwise kind of depressing because the game was so empty, kind of like RS3 now.
---
You responded to the person saying “many people probably haven’t even downloaded the default client. You didn’t have an option to download a client to play for a long time.
---
Make it require the pin each time
---
Max melee gear with V's shield, pray mage the whole time, bring maybe 10 prayer pots 10 sharks 2 scbs and a slaughter bracelet to swap to when finishing kills if you're on task (which you should be, the drop rate is ridiculously low off task)
---
In terms of weapon, Rapier/Saeldor &gt; tentacle whip &gt; cudgel/hasta (on crush) &gt; abyssal whip. Tent whip is slightly better than cudgel/hasta so it'll be up to you whether the cost of using it is worth it at basilisk knights. Cudgel outperforms hasta with certain stats/gear so you should ideally plug this into a DPS calculator yourself, but the difference is likely to be marginal so go with whichever one you have.

---
As others have mentioned below, Synq's guide is incredible. One thing I will note, when describing the tiles to use to kill the mage hand, he says something along the lines of 'start at the long-range tile' (melee side)
---
He says it this way as this is the place someone would stand in a 2-man or more raid if they are just standing in place long-ranging the mage hand.
---
HOWEVER, if you are soloing, your staff must not be on long-range or else you will not be able to make it to the other safespot in time to keep turning the head. The reason it works this way is that when you attack with a ranged weapon one tile outside of the max range, you start to get dragged towards the target. In this case you additionally click to the middle safe spot to continue the slingshot-esque movement.
---
I didn't realize this for a while (despite his XP drops in the clips not having Defence) simply because I was hung up on hearing 'long-range tile' and also because I normally duo and use long-range in those.
---
Once I realized my mistake it became very easy to keep a great rhythm for killing the mage hand.
---
It has levels and gear but all gear at launch can still be used for endgame at current day. There is no "you can get a better weapon if you do this boss"
---
There is no carrot on a stick. It's one of the biggest, most popular MMOs to date. It's playerbase is higher than OSRS.

The guy had already way too much to drink and smoke too. I had also recently reached my limit on how high I wanted to be when I saw him turn white. He looked at me from the bathroom floor when I happened to peer in and he called out "Help me." I thought he was dying. He also said he was on meds which made me freakout more until he finally said it was just Zyrtec.

I honestly couldn't care WHERE it comes from. If you care about price then it's the rate at which it enters the game, and I'm now up to 4350 dry, I'd say this is a slow rate. Now if yiy wanna argue the where, the neitiznot helm was bis, cost 55k, and came from a pretty easy low req quest

The more likely case is op sold it to himself meaning it would go right thru at any price he wanted
---
These posts r stupidly easy to fake
---
Thats a good point. People dont get how disgustingly greedy jagex is. They will make you buy certain plugins or qol stuff for sure, while Runelite keeps it free.
---
They kill you in case you're carrying a noted stack of bones
---
You can do it dude! Both of them! I believe :D
---
At work and gearing up to attempt solo Sara this evening for my Slayer task
---
would it also benefit for regular slay and some slayer bosses?
---

---
 what did they say about it in 2015?
---
No response from op either, yet he's responded after this comment was made
---
Where's the transaction history at op?
---
Just passed my Maths exam because of this, cheers lads!
---
Very impressed you solo-ed with those stats.
---
I'm not, I downloaded [https://rsbuddy.com/osb](https://rsbuddy.com/osb), I had to change my password earlier today though, I thought I had forgotten it, but maybe I was hijacked?
---
Okay, so according to the playerbase, centralizing the meta to a single weapon is okay?
---
Ahh another pierce of junk from clues.. why not aye
---
No. You can lure chaos ele like other Wiley bosses. Doubles your kills/hr
---
i was sick of the pkers, so i just started using ecto on the btw. slower but much more chilled out and planning is alot easier
---
I hope someone makes one with all the crazy cosmetics he got.  Glasses, briefcase, etc
---
You've been able to shift click to empty rune pouches for over 2 years now.
---
How is doing tob not progressing the account lol. No reason to make a hardcore if you’re not going to try to complete the game doing it. No one cares if you’re maxed on a hardcore if you have zero PvM items.
---
Literally only said that to one person who had no interest in discussion.
---
Just... get 74 more xp? It's not like you can't train more...
---
It was after I had to change my password, I thought I just forgot it, but maybe I was hijacked.
---
Also didn't happen.

mod ronan nice joke
---
I had the same first drop around 50 kc lol. It'll turn around.
---
Yeah I cant see anything at all, sometimes it does just go a lot darker but recently its going pitch black to the point I cant see if I'm even on the app or not. I also have a galaxy
---
the players wanted an item sink skill so we told them to eat shit
---
Fun fact: assuming average luck its about 1.05M kills on creatures that drop big bones to get to 99 con from 30
---
Nah I got nothing man sorry
---
We have enough junk from clue scrolls as it is and everything that’s worth anything already super rare

Hmm not sure as to that one then. I have the note 10+. Do you have an older model?

---
Rc bad
---
There's a reason so many activities are click intensive. 
---
Most methods of training have a way that's less intense and easier, but slower for exp, and then a very more intensive higher effort method for better exp rates.
---
You're basically saying you want the good exp rates without the effort that it was designed to be gated by.
---
It’s not about the cost, it’s because know that every teleport is 200-400gp, so I’d rather find a free alternative, even if it’s a bit more cumbersome. With a construction cape, I know I can teleport as much as I want, free of charge. 
---
Yes, I know the opportunity cost of free teleports is higher than that of tablets, and yes, I know fussing over 200 gp is petty.
---
Are you ironman and what’s your slayer? You could boost for smoke burst on dust devils using a magik potion and work your way up. Splashing is super afk. Or just use iban staff during slayer task if they’re weak to magic. Or high alchemy while doing agility. Or high alch+tele. Look up some quest rewarding magic xp too
---
Doesnt seem to awful old though, couple years. Not sure of the full answer here for you sadly
---
it's this normal? just like you start with a red helm and ends grey? it's just the irl version
---
I mean, technically it’s something you can do with your eyes, as the generation of the maps is very formulaic, so I hope they don’t remove it as an okay plug-in. If they did, I’d probably just risk getting banned or exclusively do cms tbh.
---
I never once said my job was awesome?
---
I think completing other diary tasks between kills reset that task. You don’t have to do in one inventory.
---
Yes, I am. It doesn't matter exactly *what* is changed, what matters is that *the task is easier.* It doesn't matter that the default left-click option is 'use,' what matters is that you don't have to click each individual potion or move your mouse at all.
---
I'm talking in terms of effort required, not specifics. The MES changes the left-click option. Why is that significant? Because it makes getting high XP rates easy; now, instead of right-clicking, then clicking use, then clicking the altar, all you have to do is left-click the bones and left-click the altar.
---
Make-all menus change the automation of the task. Why is that significant? Because it makes getting high XP rates easy; instead of clicking use, then clicking the other item, then doing that until your inventory is empty, all you have to do is click use and then the other item once.
---
Nearly all of the complaints about the MES involve the fact that it makes things easier. This baffles me because there are far more egregious 'EZScape' mechanics in the vanilla game that nobody bats an eye at.
---
His cb is too high for them to be agressive.
---
No one here talked about women at all, you thinking incels have anything to do with any of this is proof that you don't know what incels are, nor do you have a functioning brain. So get a grip and fuck off.

I use an omen laptop most of the time, but I also built a desktop I use for some harder to run games. Any newer laptop with at least an i5 would run OSRS just fine no GPU needed. If you wanted a desktop, an older one with a solid Intel CPU would work perfectly if you threw 8gb of ram in and a new graphics card, something like a 1050 would work. It's cheap and will run most games.

That sounds like something someone who doesnt know would say. (Btw seriously? 22 downvotes for a fucking joke? You guys are unfunny cunts)

---
Holy, I had to go this far down to see this. Bring this up people! 
---
There's alot of grey area here Jagex. Why cant you go through the quantity of plugins that are available on the most used clients and explicitly says which ones are ok or not ok. I'm sure that would take you less than a week.

To be fair, most weapons suck at level 70 atk and str

I’m still bitter you still have to use the seal of passage AFTER lunar diplomacy. I would have assumed part of the reward for finishing the quest is no longer needing it

You're seeing the result of the guy that pk'd you picking up your bones and dropping them back as a gesture to piss you off lol

If you combine Agility with other projects like I do with [**my project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bndshv/project_agility_in_game_and_sorta_in_real_life/)**,** it will become way more bearable to train. Use your imagination, challenge yourself and pull off other methods to train than just Agility and videos. :D
---
Just nerds basically
---
Does log not track corrupted?
---
exceptional content
---
&gt;How do you know how much they profit? How do you know their expenses?
---
to be fair this information is literally public for any publicly traded company
---
How many people use them though? The price reflects people gouging buyers because they know that if they need the tele, they'll pay a steep price for it.
---
After 99 RC, mining, and agiility I basically left the game. 
---
Will I come back? One day
---
Right but my point is that they wouldn't be killing it intentionally just that the updates over time would kill the playerbase. Like how EoC/MTX did for RS3.
---
Are you high or something? You wanna check out the beginning of this comment chain?

Even if I put an /s you still wouldn't get it.

You're literally showing me what I'm saying you are.

I could say all of these:
---
* Dumbass flies by you doing double the limit and flies off the road into a tree ... not a surprise
---
* Dumbass leaves stove on and leaves/goes to bed and burns the house down ... not a surprise
---
* Dumbass walks out into the street without caring and gets hit by  a car .. not a fucking surprise.
---
* Dumbass jumps/drives into a flooded river thinking "ahh it's not that deep" and then floats away .. not a fucking surprise
---
* Same dumbass drives over a "puddle" and falls into a fucking hole .. not a surprise
---
* Dumbass plays a game where you're supposed to always be paying attention, then doesn't pay any attention at all, and dies and loses his meaningless status on his video game character ... not a surprise.
---
&gt;I mean, I could just outright tell you that ... but you'd take offense to that (like you probably do to literally anything based on not getting the joke)

You know, if were actually capable of fucking reading anything, I wouldn't have to type this much. Zzzzz

And yea there’s clue to talk to Oneiromancer but I think that’s an elite clue and if you don’t have freminek elite done by the time you’re doing elite clues then wyd??

Are you sure? The only requirements on the wiki are paying 100 slayer points to unlock TzHaar as a potential task.

You get a cool cape to show how sweaty you are. Also not quite 99 every skill but 2200 worlds, where you can meet other socially inept individuals.

MES Is technically not 1:1 inputs, so technically it's bannable now (and always was)
---
I'm 56 days into my new account. Just passed 90m total XP and about to get my 7th skillcape. I almost can't believe it, because this also would have taken me roughly 7-8 years had I started back then. I'm probably going to hit Max cape faster than it took me to hit 1750 total for the first time.
---
Smart people do all of those things too. And a lot of times people I respect do dumb things that surprise me. And when I see strangers get hurt, no I don't get surprised. But I definitely don't find it funny. I still feel bad for them and their friends and family. On the road I have like half a second of self satisfaction then it goes away.
---
This would be soo nice !

Lunar allows you to share with a group and grants a free dose to caster.

Special attack:

**Shoo Pkers:** Instantly blocks all communcation channels of nearby pkers so they can't call their clanmates.
---
I did it back in the day because I wanted to feel like I had a special account. The problem is, it's really not that special or challenging, it's just different. Different doesn't necessarily mean good.
---
The only thing skills more challenging on a skiller are Slayer and Runecrafting. Besides that, they're just limiting themselves for no reason. At least, with pures, they're doing it with a purpose: to keep combat level low to gain advantage in pking.
---
So to answer your question, skillers are people that are too lazy to train all the skills available to them. Downvote me all you want but it's the truth. Or you can call them "novelty accounts" but not very impressive novelty accounts.
---
Yeah there's no way they'd have an actual team for the game client when they have all these 3rd party ones doing it for free. They might as well just go the WoW route. While I understand that they felt that something had to be said, this really wasn't it.
---
Now they just look stupid, and obviously they have no real way of detecting any overlays. It's either everything goes(short of botting), or nothing at all and they make their own shit. This is the worst thing they could've done, apart from banning all 3rd party clients and telling everyone to use the vanilla client.
---
This Chad makes 1 billion dollar deals
---
I believe that the way it works is you pay the slayer points to get tzhaar tasks. If you have a fire cape you can then instead get a jad task in place of a tzhaar task, and if you have an infernal cape you could also opt to run inferno. It's done this way because slayer helm makes the content so much easier
---
I'm just saying, for a community that is always talking about not wanting to devalue things, they sure do like to devalue things.
---
It's just common courtesy to tip. But to expect or even demand "donations" is a bit rude, to me.

---
People tend to comment or wonder, "Why in earth make such a bot?" The answer is generally one of two things.
---
* OP just wants to make a program and see it flourish in the world.
---
* OP wants to gain a bunch of karma and then turn around and sell the account for actual money. A user with over a million+ karma can be "worth" a lot to people, such as advertisers, that can wipe the history clean and start anew (deleting all your post/comments does not remove your karma), for example.
---
Many subs ban users for posting top reposts to that sub. If this post is one of them, you can report it and a mod would end up removing it.

---
How would you respond to a slippery slope argument? The more new content and minigames that are introduced, the less oldschool the game becomes.
---
I wonder if the unwritten stance that Conservative Scapers have is that boring and annoying grinds is what makes OSRS, OSRS. This sentiment is usually expressed as "hard work," and how much more you appreciate something when you work for it. Kind of how no one cares if you get a 99 any more, where people used to have parties for Cooking 99s.
---
But we do need to find a compromise - how can we champion the idea of hard work, and even have that make an impact on other MMOs and change the minds of the people who play those "pay to win" or "1 click 99" games; while still staying competitive in the evolving gaming market? There are other MMOs out there that younger gamers will switch to if they get bored with OSRS.
---
Wow nice

I see thanks for the help

Oh yeah, Skilling pets could be a little different I guess. But as far as bossing pets, I'd stick with my philosophy solely because if it were me doing it and I got my favorites out of the way, I'd have a lot less motivation to finish the list tbh haha

---
General Reposti
---
Thank you so much, though, does the post say removed for you?
---
I  don't know why things works that way, or the mechanics behind it. But the interactions are like this.
---
Chromatic dragons:
---
 Normal antifire potion + antifire shield grants immunity, protection from magic prayer does not affect damage.
---
Brutal and metal dragons:
---
 Normal antifire potions + protection from magic grants full immunity. 
---
Antifire shield does not help. If you use crossbow, a god book helps with accuracy and prayer bonus.
---
Vorkath:
---
Potions are always required. Normal antifire reduces his damage a little, and super antifire reduces even more, so they are recommended.
---
To finish your protection, you can either pray mage, which is recommended if you are using a blowpipe, or you use an antifire shield if you are using a crossbow, in which case you pray ranged.
---
All fireproof shield protect the same amount of damage, the benefit of the ward is to both protect and have ranged accuracy bonus.
---
 The exception if the mithril, adamant and rune dragons, which have unique mechanics, were you can't block all their damage.
---
and making amulets would slow it down? lol
---
Do you think a maxed med lvl (75/99/75/99/99/95 hp/77 pray - 108 cb) will have a noticeably harder time than on a maxed acc? Been thinking of starting the grind soon but have been pretty discouraged at how many tries some people have gone through. Ideally, I would hope I can get it down well enough that I can do in under 10 tries but I know it'll be very tough.

If you were actually training by using the stuff you collected the collection skills would be quite a bit higher than the resource using skills

yes but the price will still settle barely above 200gp. With it taking 2minutes to clean unlimited herbs at 200gp each if it went much higher than 200 you could make millions instantly and enough people would do it to crash it back to 200
---
Okay just read that and that's awesome, almost 99
---
This is kind of a shitty argument. 
---
The other outfits you mentioned also come from clicking. Everything does.
---
For some overpowered OSbuddy features you do have to pay, yes. RuneLite is free and doesn’t really offer anything that broken.

Depends on the stream, woox streams for example.

Where else would the profits go?

Ur either a hardcore nerd doing barb till 74 or ur a chad just trying to hit the highest xp/h cuz u need the rev shortcut or whatever to pk noobs which is wildy bars 10–47*.  Werewolf is higher xp/h but less once u factor in quest time and is also not doable at lvl 10.

That’s not a bad idea but the biggest issue is the iron is basically making the combat rooms scaled to a duo without getting help, and the other person could potentially get the loot plus there’s only like 1-2 rotations worth 1+1ing. So if anything the iron who’s doing the rooms would just be hurting themselves tbh.
---
I'll bet every GP I have that his next account has better RNG
---
Why build up such a nice collection only to sell it?
---
Reminds me of that guy who spend 17 years building a Lambo from scratch, only to sell it to some random person.
---
Why?!?! Its way cooler to have the collection than money
---
I tested P++ on my dragon dagger.
---
80m?
---
It's like 35m not counting the cost to get 84 Con unless you vastly overpaid some random dude.
---
3 rune pickaxes?!!?! I guess so!
---
Congrats!
---
See, I use official client every time.
---
I don't see why you would want a third party software, when it could easily be able to steal your information.
---
But im a 15+ year runescape vet. I love the game, and I'd be down asf for some quality changes to the official client. Things that would make my life less hellish, less click intensive, and more fun.
---
But on the same token, I'd rather third party software be banned entirely, so we all have the same set of tools to work with.
---
People will be a lot less likely to vote no on QOL if they actually had to use the official client.
---
100% agree, the mob just needs to be harder. Which is happening btw
---
ToB is PvM content. Predictable in its nature, but difficult. It also awards some of the best gear in game, which is useful to have (you can say he's maxed but maxing gear can help with XP grinds plus why do any of us play this game but to finish achievements and collections).
---
To go into the wildy is to essentially always roll the dice. Nothing stopping a dude running up and ags'ing a 70 then gmauling and your dead. No counter play, no nothing. You just get a bad roll of the dice and you die. Not to mention the hideous teaming and such problems.
---
Risking your hc status in order to gain some of the best gear in game in difficult pvm content is respectable because it's difficult, and he could just bankstand and skill for 5k hours and care about virtual leaderboards. But he'd rather push for cool gear on a no death account. That's why we respect it.
---
I did 50m prayer exp there only lost one invent of bones. Kept my main there and use my alts to run me bones. Was always funny using ely+staff+helm and black d’hide and watching them splash and cry about not getting kills while they are using salad robes.
---
I think just having a faster run helps too. It’s mentally exhausting going through the waves, and by the time you get to the end you make dumb mistakes cause you just spent 4 hours on the waves camping sgs or using justicar.
---
I’m praying for it
---
You just compare dynamic menu swaps to AHK?  You realize that shift dropping is the exact same thing as using bones on an altar with the osbuddy plugin??
---
If you have 3 accounts it's also the fastest way to train mage on a pure, just thought you might want to know
---
It also disables our authenticators just as quickly
---
spec makes you dig a tunnel to edgeville
---
Mate, if "good players" die in the fucking abyss, you can die in ToB pretty easily.
---
When you’re ready try it out, you’ll be surprised with how much fun you’ll have when you challenge yourself.
---
Stone slab or magical? Sword is good comparison
---
&gt;it's like my 3rd highest stat
---
&gt;
---
You being a noob doesn't change that lvl 60 is barely anytime.
---
&gt;so i think i've trained it a quite bit
---
You're roughly 2% of the way to 99. You can go from 1-60 in less than 10 hours of gameplay.
---
They should have been like Demonic gorilla's or a boss rather than an afk and hope it drops monster
---
Not for or against your opinion. But swampletics also does alot of theory crafting and finding hidden gems/statistic sampling of drops. Which most content creators dont do. And each episode does vary somewhat. But in general the theme of all osrs videos are the same and its up to the voice/commentary/quality.
---
Nah that's just 1 in 256
---
Sure, the Chinese holding company owns Jagex so you can choose to look at 46 million as the only meaningful number.  We’re talking about the allocation of profits. 
---
There was 46 million in profits from RS,  42 million went to the Chinese holding company.  Which would mean 4million went to Jagex.  That’s where the discussion stemmed from.

Can you imagine a world where there suddenly are no more maxed Ironman?
---
&gt;visible combat level affecting stats
---
So if everyone has the same stats from leveling alone, then the only determining factor in a "build" is going to be the gear, correct?
---
for a half year it is exciting then getting those end game items r annoying so i just went back to my main
---
support
---
&gt; and there's a censor for a reason 
---
I personally hate it when people say this. Regardless, a perm may be harsh. Lets see what you actually said though?
---
The whip vine looked better than the tent whip too
---
Yup. Not today. Lol
---
Dude this is literally the reason I won’t alt zulrah
---
remove non-BIS spade
---
Ah
---
hey look its someone who's having a really bad day because no one loves him and no one ever will because he's a fat ugly idiot :(
---
Sorry for doubting you. 
---
Grown.
---
10/10
---
26k from 99 ranged, and 50 more abyssal demons left on task. so probably sire
---
Can you give any example of an overpowered paid plugin OSBuddy offers that RuneLite doesn’t?
---
Fuck man... rolling in the dough with your three rune pickaxe fancy ass.
---
still.  Id personally be gaining a couple million xp a year.  Thats cool
---
My dad said if he found a player in RS3 he would come back. I'm still waiting. Dad we miss you.
---
Dude. Profit means after expenses. If I owned jagex personally I would get the profit because that's the money left over after expenses. Jagex isn't a person, and it is "paid" by the expenses being covered. What are you even talking about.
---
the spec lets you instantly dig to keldagrim and can be used only in the wilderness
---
Dragon boots need slayer as well...
---
This is a must we need more expensive items!
---
Not comparing the two but didn’t woox do it with no inventory too? Some people are just insanely good
---
Wait wait wait.  You’re telling me you can do the varrock agility course tick perfect without any falls for 13200 exp/hr and that is definitely faster than an unfailable method that can be spam clicked to never miss a tick and gives 13320 exp/hr.
---
Please tell me more.
---
Nice work! Where do you burn them at?
---
I think the only unpopulat opinion i saw was rc good
---
Yesn't
---
\&gt; The Angler's outfit is one of the most important skilling outfits   
---
\&gt; It makes zero sense how un-interactive    
---
Skilling? Uninteractive?  My god, we're doomed!
---
\&gt; The literal only benefit of this game is the Angler's outfit which grants a measly +2.5% fishing exp when worn. 
---
\&gt;The Angler's outfit is one of the most important skilling outfits 
---
Honestly I dont even need to commentate this, youre so assmad youre countering yourself.
---
\&gt; The mining outfit is bought with golden nuggets gained from mining, makes sense. 
---
Mining isnt interactive or exciting, and it certainly qualifies as just clicking.  By your own logic, why arent you furious at mining?  Having gotten both, prospector is much worse to get than angler - and prospector has a use.
---
\&gt; If you're not spam clicking like everyone else, you're late to patch holes and don't get credit.
---
Not remotely true.  Just being on alert allows you to sametick, same as repairing the wt brazier.
---
Does anyone have a guide on training Runecrafting without actually crafting runes. My goal is to hit 55 *eventually*, but I'm happy passively training it over a couple of months using lamps and the like.
---
Here's my plan so far:
---
* Complete the Abyss Miniquest, Eyes of Glouphry and Ascent of Arceuus early on.
---
* Unlock Tears of Guthix and keep Runecrafting as my lowest skill
---
* Get some extra Runecrafting XP from the Arceuus Library minigame
---
* Use all of my lamps from genies, quests and achievement diaries on Runecrafting
---
Am I missing anything else?
---
Lol chaos alter is far faster and far cheaper than ensouled heads.
---
Amen! This right here. I have a crazy amount of goals cause I love planning stuff out. But then I do whatever’s fun, while still working towards one of the goals.
---
be gone with ye easyscape scum
---
Actually i Prefer ZMI Over MLM tbh
---
They released a statement two days ago saying plugins like m left click construction were not okay.
---
Atleast he can play the game now
---
Gross
---
What if we do this for all 3rd party clients and only allow vanilla to have the one click clean?
---
Yes, the two that I was referring to have now been removed I’ve been told, but they were 1 click dragon bones onto altars and removing multiple clicks while training construction. Both of these go against OSRS AHK policy where 1:1 click ratio must be maintained.
---
I do this to a small degree, so I’m curious what your groups are.
---
\&gt; doesn't mean spam clicking on the same spot for 10 minutes is fun. 
---
You really dont need to spam click lol, just be ready to click when the water shows and youre fine.
---
What review?
---
Jiggleplex employees actively avoiding you xd
---
Thanks for the reply.i guess I'll aim for ham storeroom and agility. Ty!!
---
It doesn’t matter, it’s 0 time xp
---
Lmao that’s golden
---
I figured you were talking about those, none of those plugins were paid. But yes they have indeed been removed after Jagex released their statement.
---
Dude you're really good at this sort of thing.
---
Lmao you're a fucking sperg
---
Spec is d b axe but “Reeeee” text instead
---
Pro: gain 50% movement speed (equal to 120 agility)
---
Cons: leaves trail of feces and urine for pkers to follow
---
The great thing about a main is you can do everything a Ironman can do aswell.
---
Took me absolutely hours to get my angler outfit, sure I went well over the drop rate in the end and was considering ending it all after about day 3.
---
Definitely needs an entire rethink, the rewards are shit, the content is shit and the time it takes is shit
---
An Ultimate Iron Man account who never leaves Morytania, search ‘settled’ on YouTube and sit back and enjoy the ride
---
Then what’s the point of the wildy, it’s supposed to be a high risk high reward for PvMers. Some people actually enjoy the feeling of danger while skilling or PvMing in the wildy, and even then, if your smart, at worst you’ll probably lose less than 250k, which shouldn’t be much to people who are able to boss
---
And also because it’s an addition into the wildy doesn’t  make it instantly a pvp update, and I know you didn’t say that but a lot of people will and literally there’s no point in having a wildy if there isn’t content in it, you might as well just go on a pvp world or clan wars at that point
---
And give us irl marks of grace that we can exchange for healthy sandwiches at subway
---
Maybe
---
Rune Platebod
---
It depends sometimes I do blacks and risk it of the biscut and sometimes I do reds for safe money
---
I think nobody would have a problem with this
---
Each their own, i'm on the account build grind in f2p before spending $11 so I'll be able to maintain a bond.
---
Let me tell you, f2p rc bad.
---
Getting perm muted in a 2019? You said some pretty fucked up shit
---
No inventory is definitely easier, relatively speaking. Your DPS is WAY higher so you have to prayer flick for a much shorter time. Less window to fuck up. Xzact had to be almost perfect for 10 hours.
---
L0l dude have you seen the reasons they hand out perm mutes, it's fucking pathetic.
---
