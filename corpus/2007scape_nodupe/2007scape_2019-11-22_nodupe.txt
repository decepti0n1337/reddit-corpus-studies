Hato is guy who faked old solo chambers world record. Hai yo = op of this post, phoneman is his friend. Basically hai yo mad cuz hato faked the record (also worth noting Hai holds current actual solo wr atm) and physically threatened him. Lots of drama followed and led to an admin of wdr stepping down and a mod leaving because Hai wasnt banned because of his behavior (because hes friends with most of the other staff).

2.3M/hr at 90 range is awful though, which is my point. With things like zulrah, hydra and vorkath shitting out money for very little effort, you'd be insane to waste upwards of 13 hours at basilisks for a jaw that is worth a fraction of what you make elsewhere. 
---

---
All I'm saying is demand will far far far outnumber the supply because almost nobody wants to kill them.
---
Do you have any proof ironmen voted no? 
---
Also if you‚Äôre happy game integrity is damaged it sounds like voting against everything you want is in the community‚Äôs interest.
---
Please tell me this is OC
---
Who's gonna ever risk his zulrah storage while pvming on a uim though

By that logic should any trading on Ironman being allowed as long as it‚Äôs ‚Äúinefficient‚Äù?

It tells you that herbs are lost on death when you buy it

It doesn't really matter, they get their big audience introduced to the game and the money is well spent

They could leave the current robes but just make them 1/512 drops from wyrms drakes ect. Bc they are fairly cheap anyway

why do redditors always bring their makebelieve experience competition standards into scenarios where they just don't apply? lmao
---
yall forget it's possible to die, get skipped, get a shit bh task, take multiple fights to kill your target, run out of time killing your target, so on.  
---
point is, kills aren't guaranteed and not just a matter of showing up every 20 minutes. you might take longer than 20 mins to complete your task and thus completely waste one round. and thus this makes using estimated/calculated figures like this artificially bloated and just not a genuine representation of the real experience. not to even mention kill difficulty wildly differs at every combat bracket.
---
i'd like to see actual experiments with n&gt;25h for estimated figures.

hahaha, I‚Äôve never had such a big item drop in my whole time playing the game... guess its time to train my range up from level 1
---
My friend and I are a little competitive so we are usually one upping each other when it comes to stats. I was ahead of him in melee thanks to training combat with slayer. 
---
Then my friend found out about training at nmz and now just afk trains there whenever I pass him in any melee stat.

The efficiency meta is going to be the death of this game.

The duel arena could have been a cool place for people to do 1v1s and place money on their own pvp skill. Now its just a casino.

Should I fletch or not at WT? Currently around 70-75FM and I‚Äôm 95HP, so I presume I will take a lot of damage. Don‚Äôt care too much about the crate rewards, but if say it was only a few more hours difference between fletching and not and I‚Äôd receive (as an example) double the loot, would obviously go down that path.
---
All jokes aside, just make sure you hash your passwords with a good algorithm (bcrypt works fairly well).  And make sure your database is not open to the world, but only to the servers which requires access.  And send all your passwords though SSH, which you are not doing unless I manually type https in the url.
---
Good luck on the project
---
The best part is you are absolutely not aware of anything that goes on regarding the duel arena, or if you cared at all about PEOPLE or this game your opinion would be far different. But thats a common thing among being online isnt it

Being rich imo is just having fun what with you have. I'm sitting at a 260m bank (and have been for a while) and i think that's more than enough to do what i need. Of course having a twisted bow would be nice to have but its not a high priority for me since i don't really do raids super often.

I mean having literally one piece of content which iron men cant do is hardly bad. By putting revs in multi it was obvious this was going to be the case. 
---
By paying for a week of rev protection you are basically transferring wealth from your main to your iron man, because of the revs broken drop table you are guaranteed to make the money back. Its also unfair to iron men without mains that can drop mills on protection.

FWIW I think it‚Äôs great that you and your team are actively and seriously trying (whether or not any single attempt bares fruit) to engage and pull in new players.  In my opinion that‚Äôs one of the largest risks to OSRS by a mile; the game is simply old and honestly very outdated on just a conceptual level. Runescape rose to prominence in an era of gaming where MMOs reigned supreme, and it was matched up against other insanely grindy options Everquest and Ultima. That era is gone, probably never to return, and OSRS is among the last of its kind. Even WoW has strongly and permanently shifted away from grinding and toward being a casual playground. 
---
Good on you for continuing to try to connect with new players.

Hey fellas, I've been using a brimstone ring for a long time. I have a lot of NMZ points now, should I imbue the berserker ring for the strength bonus or the warrior ring for the slash bonus (since I'm training attack with a whip, 99 strength so I'm not focused on training that anymore). Also, should I be wearing the helm of neitiznot or the berserker helm? Thanks a lot in advance to any help!
---
I don't agree it needs to be repolled. What was there to misunderstand that involved needing to try it out. It's stackable clues. We got stackable caskets which solved a lot of the reasons why people wanted it that wasn't just a clear bias towards wanting it to be easier to farm clues, which is what you have 
---
I'm well aware imps are a source of clues. I've done nearly 2000 clues. I'm also aware that when you get a clue you then have to go and do it, and then come back to open more imps. And only medium clues are long term sustainable doing this.
---
If you didn't have to go and do it, imps would become even more ridiculous. I could open 10k eclectic imps and expect 400 medium clues and then just instantly go and do 400 in a row. That's a clearly insane buff to the rate clues can be done which devalues the milestone clue rewards and **will devalue the only remaining valuable clue items**
---
How does paying for kills on an Ironman help you? It‚Äôs your own slayer task. Unless I‚Äôm missing something?

Fershizzle, I appreciate it.

I was expecting something like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9K18CGEeiI

What I got was so much better.
---
There was something like this after free trade was removed in rs2. Tournaments that had a set gp entrance fee with set rules ranging from all out no rules to melee only/melee with food/range only etc. The tournaments were separated by level brackets and usually consisted of like 16 people. Was actually a lot of fun imo.
---
paying for bh target kills
---
Unfortunately, there's no way to get to 100 kudos. While Demon Slayer, Rune Mysteries, Shield of Arrav, and Merlin's Crystal are all completeable, none of the other quests/miniquests are without gaining a level in a non-attack stat. This puts you at 98 kudos.
---
Just hop worlds dude
---
The B ring would give you +8 str over the warrior ring, so personally I‚Äôd go with that as it will give you a max hit or two, and the nezzy for sure

Sounds like a purchased account to me
---
falador is clearly an extremely religious military state wym
---
Okay, I thought so. I‚Äôve seen where people try to stack the chance of the drop table itself with the items chance and I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was correct or not.
---
Runelite has this, it‚Äôs called bank tags.
---
Wait it only gives you those drops if you have the levels to make them. What's the problem here?

---
&gt;lot of people in this thread seem to be out of the loop that ironmen could play the previous rendition of bh since the gamemode's inception.
---
No. People just realize that *NOW* boosting gives resources instead of raw GP.
---
Resources are far more valuable than GP. Ironmen already get more gp than they'll ever need.
---
i was thinking about PTSD watching this
---
One could see even using the crates as abusing them. Especially when you have accounts like Solo Missions who can easily rack up points. It's important to clarify
---
B ring for sure and nezzy.
---
Super rare that only drops when it is sizable to you... vs semi common always smaller at least slightly
---
Boot
---
He gets you on his shoulders
---
yeah this is not at all what hes talking about haha bh could be 20m/hr in skilling supplies for pkers and op probably wouldnt even care. Its the fact that bh boosting is the most efficient way to get supplies (anglers, range pots, brews, etc) on an iron, a game mode thats supposed to stand alone and not get advantages from player interaction.
---

---
Just because something has more than two legs doesn't mean the subsequent limbs suddenly qualify as arms.

The wiki should have correct drop rates for everything. Dragon spear is 3/16384 on the gem table and (3/128)*(3/16384) ‚âà 1/233017.
---
Downvotes for death threats!
---
I was wondering why that was a video link lol

Just remember that's the drop rate to hit it for all monsters that have access to the drop table.

If you are going to respond read the entire comment thread. I'm saying i've seen tons of people quit because of it.
---

---
Whoops, fixed
---
Gratz! 
---
How laid back is your job you can "afk" MLM lol, I can get away with NMZ but that's about it
---
Ok, doing an actual test with a timer, the RS3 wiki is actually wrong about recovery rate. Credit where credit is due, I was wrong as well. I'm not good at keeping track of seconds. That's my fault.
---
It takes 1 minute 15 seconds to go from 0% run energy to 100% in RS3 at 1 Agility. I tested it right now and I am willing to record it for you if you want actual proof that I am not bullshitting you.
---
Run energy in RS3 also actually depletes at .666666% per tick, tested at 1 kg being able to run from 100 to 0 in 1 minute 30 seconds. Testing on OSRS, it's the same rate at 0 kg.
---
The interesting difference is the fact run energy does not replenish while running in OSRS but it does in RS3. That explains why I specifically could run from the Lumbridge Lodestone to Grand Exchange at 1 agility with 20 run energy remaining.
---
The wiki is way off about run energy restoration in RS3. It is definitely faster than 1% in 2.25 seconds, 3x faster even.
---
Lastly, and this is something I completely forgot about, there is a spa in Oo'glog that gives you endless endurance effect for 15 minutes which is easily accessible via lodestone teleportation. It is the meta for bossing. There is also the spirit terrorbird which has a spammable, stackable scroll that replenishes half of your agility level as run energy instantly and gives a 2 agility level boost. It's useful for low-mid levels with like 60 Agility to run infinitely in the Mourning's End II temple of light or something.
---
Then there are mint cakes which just give 100% run energy and people get a bunch from Prifdinnas Agility. I think they're tradeable. They restore 100% run energy straight up.
---
And, of course, rest, which gives like 3 run energy per second not with a musician and even more with. Again, tested it on RS3.
---
RS3 actually has a ton more ways to restore run and the Oo'glog pool's endless endurance is more busted than staminas. Even with staminas and graceful, you can run out of run. Happens to me when Runecrafting. Runecrafter bad.
---
With Oo'glog pool, you have at least 10 minutes of worry-free running.
---
Thanks for the tips. Django has a built in hashing algorithm for passwords and the security features are production ready out of the box. Would highly recommend toying with Django if you‚Äôre interested in Python, it‚Äôs a great web framework. Everything else is locked down as it should be, all traffic redirects to https automatically give it a shot :)
---
Thanks that helps! So let's say I my first kill really quick and then drop some food for inventory space. If I miss my spec on the second kill is it worth it to just try and go for it or just bail and try again.

theyre talking about bh boosting not playing bh haha why would you die, skip, or take multiple fights to kill your own account?

you can literally buy xp with $$ in RS3, I can't imagine playing a game like that

I more meant that it cant be a virus fromm my pc stopping it. Dunno what kind of virus would only stop runelite anyway.

Autohotkeys doesn‚Äôt press the buttons for you smartass. He‚Äôs talking about literally rebinding one key to = another key. People use this for fletching all the damn time.

It's no where near 3-6m an hour LMFAO. Especially not for a fucking venny. They make like 1-2m an hr tops
---
Dhl, dwh, blowpipe, blessed dhide is fine, trident of the swamp, zenyte jewelry (torture, anguish, torm), ancestral top/bottom, bcp, prims, pegs, bgloves or ferocious gloves, brimstone ring, faceguard/serpentine, assembler, dragon pickaxe, fire cape or infernal cape, mage arena 2 cape, and bring I.
---
That should run you under 500m. 500m in gear is not necessary for raids though. Sell your tassets. They‚Äôre junk and useless for raids unless you have scythe infernal cape and bring i.
---
If that‚Äôs over 500m, swap our ancestral top for Ahrims top. No reason other than Bcp looks ugly af with Ahrims skirt.
---
Go to lumbridge castle once lmao. 1000s of them its insane.

I can easily make 3m+ (99 mining) but no where near 4-6

When you hear the buzzer, stare at the art.

Usually you can but if your goal is time then it also depends on how far away the healers spawn. You can put dps them even when they‚Äôre close but it‚Äôs generally going to take a little longer.
---
They were offered with Warding; forget if they ever had graphics or just a plan. That said, I think these robes would be better suited to come from something Arceuus related like a featured quest than being in the Brimstone Chest. It is kinda the same problem players had with Dagon'Hai Robes being in a random chest in the Wilderness, even if there could be some justification for it.

We all appreciate some oc. This sub is so aids 99% of the time

Keep your crabs away from me.
---
You also get increased exp rates. So getting to a boss will be much easier and quicker to make money or get lucky for a normal account. This would cause botting in TL. To be honest, keeping the rewards at a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù basis is the best.
---
Lol saw wizard post this on twitter earlier
---
Why?
---
Also important for training mining/smithing with harvester since normal mining is ultra-cancer when 9 rocks fills your inventory
---
?
---
All bars sell stews that have an infinite supply. Super cheap and quick 11 healing food to get.
---
If future leagues have a defensive perk like resistance, perhaps it could complete some quests like legends quest or monkey madness so that items like the skills necklace or dragon scimitar which are available from clues could be used?
---
This would give players access to powerful midgame gear and teleports but probably wouldn't overshadow the top level gear (ie raids/hydra in zeah) available to dedicated players.
---
It‚Äôs the credits theme from Super Mario World.

---
Small brain strats: Kill the boss on your already high level account with far better gear so you can get one big item and all the smaller loot and other big ticket items that come with it.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Big brain stats: Stop playing your high level account so you can spend dozens of hours training an extremely restricted ironman account until it has the same stats as your high level account but with much worse gear, no access to the GE, and the requirement that you make your own supplies.  All of this so you go for the extremely unlikely chance you'll get one and only one big item which you can transfer.

It is very good. Good boobs for sure. It's good that the boobs are very visible because they are definitely my favorite part of the image.

Another thing to consider is that a lot of the people who actually have reached the 5th tier are probably streamers or hardcore PvMers. A couple weeks from now when more of the casual gamers get that far, the numbers could have a fairly large change.

No just mahogany planks to 82

I'd appreciate if you would pick one of two points to defend, either that I indicated I don't know basic stamina mechanics, which I did not you were wrong, or that graceful had no impact on the visual aesthetic of the game. I can discuss that gladly and make some valid points, but I'm a little too stuck on that insult to just change the subject.

If you honestly think it's the right you have deep-seated psychological issues that can never be truly fixed.

I also suggest: Witchwood Icon, radas blessing and the memoir for free prayer bonus. All are +1 though.
---
I'm sorry, I was referring to the original kalphite queen drop table. It was updated in 2014, I should have clarified that.
---
Could do a tier 1 relic that would make your account not an iron man...really good for groups but miss out on an actual perk.... just an idea
---
Wouldn't you need to regear anyway if you ever planning on using that set up, followed by just taking a screenshot and overwriting the old one? Not to detract from a tool like this, but that seems like about the same level of effort.
---
I genuinely enjoyed this and felt so bad for the mole
---
The main thing I did for money at sub 1200 total was make nature runes but it's not ideal for most players
---
I heard it from in-game.... i dunno where the other guy got his source.
---
But think about it, it makes sense.
---
That drop table was awful though, and it was updated because people asked for it. While not polled, These drop tables are designed with community feedback in mind, so that‚Äôs something to consider. Jagex knows people don‚Äôt like tons of resources and gold coming into the game.
---
picking slayer tasks, however on.va much smaller scale, maybe once per week

Check the same account but the bond pouch on the RS3 PROFILE

You are a hero.

Hi, I'm new! I already know that scimitar are better than longsword because it hits 25% faster. Ok, makes total sense. But is it still good for stab? For slash I have no clue that scimi are godlike, but if I compare the mithril scimitar and mithril longsword, the longsword has +15 stab and +20 slash while the scimitar has only +5 stab and +21 slash.  
---
With that in mind, in that specific case, is the scimitar better than the longsword for stabbing because it hits more often or these extra +10 stab of the longsword makes it better?  
---
I wanna level attack and strength together, so I won't use only slash.  
---
Thanks for your time haha

Just bonds, they removed the mobile free trial so bots are buying membership with bonds now

I was muted in 2017 for 24 hours for moderate, then again 2 years later in 2019 for 24 hours.

Fast forward 6 months, I get hit with a manual permanent mute and jagex will not show me the evidence.

I gave this account hundreds of hours of my time and it's just unfair to get permanently muted with no evidence.  
---
I've tried emailing, twitter jagex customer support, and now i'm here on reddit customer support.   
---
Release the chat logs or put me in contact with a direct line, I demand to see the god damn evidence. 6 months is just too fucking long to wait for customer service for a game i still play.  Please upvote so jamflex can do their job
---
The Oo'glog pool's duration actually scales with your agility level so you still need to train it to get the most out of it. It is also more inconvenient to reach to from the lodestone than just grabbing a stamina potion from a bank. Spirit terrorbird still requires players to train up to mid level Summoning before it can be used, unlike staminas which can just be bought and used. In these two cases, RS3 players still need to work for these benefits from questing or skilling before receiving these benefits.
---
You are right about the mint cakes. Those are way too powerful in RS3 for how little they cost. But are they really more OP than staminas in OSRS? 1 mint cake restores 100% energy for one inventory slot but one 4-dose stamina potion restores 80% run total with 8 minutes worth of 70% less run energy depletion.
---
Its not an rs3 quest but i get it, that's unfortunate, as it, and ritual of the mahjarrat were great quests to wrap up the lucien storyline
---
Adding ranged xp to barb fishing. I love it.
---
Save a head to use on the ranging cape gives if the same ammo effect as the assembler
---
East from land's end. They have a fenced camp, kinda the same as at Barb village. Chances are small tho, way faster to just do construction with teleport to house and then use nearest bank tele

Well your sample size is still grossly smaller than the amount you can watch in streams. You said he clearly has a mental disorder and you're clearly an idiot for thinking that. Entertaining only for 13 year olds? If you're an idiot who doesnt understand how people can have different interests and opinions than you without being flawed, sure.  He's risen quite a bit since he started streaming and based off the connection he has with his streamers I'm sure hell be around a lot longer.

There‚Äôs an optimal quest guide somewhere on the wiki that gives you the best idea of what quests to do early on to get the best items and skip early levels in shitty skill.

I mean, I guess I could understand that from the perspective of someone who has played since osrs came back but for me who started just 2 months ago I'm glad it is here. Like hell do I want to max ANOTHER account because my old accounts are now rs3 (trash).  I was able to afk nmz for a month and max melee which gets me closer to where I left off 12 years ago.

I'm only 650 kills deep and I'm depressed thinking about doing more.

the only thing that annoys me is that there isn't a female version of the clothing rewards. when are we getting high heels jamflex! vyrewatch heels are all we have in peak female fasion footwear.

what mini quest? i did rune mysteries and that was the only req right?
---
Iron btw
---
But really its not about that, first off, Taking out the arena, already instantly fucks china into a coma thats, probably what? 60% profits instantly because now you can't openly stake and have to backdoor gamble? Which probably is going to make detecting RWTers incredibly easier compared to how it is now? Yeah right dude, duel arena getting lost is the best thing to ever happen to this game gold sink or not
---
Because you give the best head.
---
Upvote for visibility. 
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat.

Happened to me too 1 month after a break. They stole 150m but also leveled my magic by 60 levels so that's cool
---
Because it doesn't

It said that you have completed all the display cases and cannot gain any more kudos. After pressing continue, I received the xp lamp for that display. Nothing else after that
---
I'm just saying that if the player is capable of putting the geodges/bottles automatically in their inventory, why can't we just make it the same for nests at this point? I thought I had a fair suggestion, but not getting anything but negativity (not from you specifically).

Why? Just don't go there and its as if its removed lol

So, statistically speaking, if you get a job for Uber Eats and you don't have a car, you are a homeless drug addict or a felon? I'd like to take a look at those statistics.

yeah i've been reading that for like the past 30 minutes making sure i didnt miss anything. i did rune mysteries, and came out to where he is supposed to be and he isn't there. swapping server does nothing. there must be another req to make him appear.

Why are you bossing on world 2
---
I think its fine the way it is. Definitely a challenge tho. As it should be for 15 min chance at 90m reward.
---
Took me maybe 15 tries to get it down. Then did it back to back.
---
Moved straight to corrupted and took about another 10 tries till I completed it (barely) and got that sweet, sweet cape.
---
I think corrupted mode is way more RNG based too tho.

you lose everything when you die but yeah some people really enjoy spending 2 months covered in greases and sweat. like i know this one kid who has is top 10 rank and he has no life no girlfriend weighs about 350 pounds and sill lives with his parents and he is 27 and never seen a girl naked. so just remember there are always people out there that have no fucking life.
---
i see your point. theres always a technicality when it comes to stuff like that. "Just because that guy looks like a bot, doesnt mean he is one!" so i dont really have an answer to your question, but i still think ironmen shouldnt have protection.
---
Bruh, you take a platter of shit in front of you and say: "This is quality food".

no

You can disable the challenge but it won't revert the mimic into a reward casket

Monkey Madness was the my first encounter with the puzzle boxes and I gotta say it took me a straight ten minutes to figure out how to do these things and another five to get it done.
---
A lil perseverance goes a long way learning puzzles I've found.
---
Lmfao you realize people could easily just die in the wild to someone if their intent is to RWT without getting caught.  I don't see why you even care if you're an iron.  Killing the duel arena doesn't hurt RWT nearly as much as you think, the game would become even more infested with gambling bots as there would be no option for gambling. What's next when the problem gets relocated somewhere else? Removing the wild?  Banning Twitch? Restricting free trade?  You're clueless
---
combat bosses are generally in a different category.
---
Ranged defence pure
---
it would actually make even more op for the other skills that way less things to roll as u couldnt do burnt pages for all types of fish/ores and gems
---
Where is my beautiful Rellekka
---
You mean like the Neo-Nazi artist that would literally make comics about denying the holocaust and race realism? I wonder why people aren't a fan of them.
---
Shoutout to all the people like me who aren‚Äôt on the 99‚Äôs list ü§ô
---
It only makes sense as all the resources you're getting are from the citizens of kourend for helping subdue the wintertodt.
---
You could, the burnt page amount will be lowered to compensate.
---
The burnt pages would be like Zulrah Scales.
---
What‚Äôs a rimmington?
---
I started gangsters when almost no one else fought em. Got that rune scim early and hot damn was it worth it.
---
You only use ranged attack on The final forms head, damage reduction is far too great to be effective
---
Everyone looks cute in an oversized hoodie. Same goes for massive armour apparently. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Thank you
---
That's what he is saying. Dont use stab with scimitar.
---
But why? You can't just say it is unfair a Firemaking Boss gives non-FM resources and then go "oh, but PvM can do whatever". At least Wintertodt scales those rewards based on your levels in those skills unlike PvM Bosses.
---
Shamans are a bitch to kill. Seriously has to be one of the worst grinds for ironmen lol. So much end game content is locked behind it
---
Best way to get a rune scimmy in tl? I haven‚Äôt tried gangsters since it‚Äôs probably crowded and fire giants would take 3 years to kill. I‚Äôve been prayer flicking skeletons in the shayzien crypts is that my best bet

Wait did they update NMZ again or something? Why do people dislike it so much? AFK exp

A combat brace would be much more useful IMO.

Im running Ubuntu 10.4.5 LTS, dont know what laptop this is other than a dell, very old. If I run hardinfo it just says %s on the processor part. Shows 2GB ram tho
---
I‚Äôm okay with not having access to revs drop table, but there should be another way for us to get the wildy weapons as they are BiS in a lot of scenarios and only REALLY lucky players and people who pay for protection can use them.
---
Aye good job man grats!
---
//u/rarghrs I am the opposite of super satisfied
---
Idk if I would either, but I like to believe I would? I have a friend who made an account after I pestered him, and despite coming from FFXIV he loves the game. To the point where at some point he dreaded raiding because it meant less runescape time.
---
Yeah but you get to hold hands.
---
I was under the impression that the cosmetics from each league were once in a life time?
---
Changing the game to cater to casual players in their first 30 minutes of gameplay is going to have no effect other than devaluing stamina pots and people who have earned full graceful. 
---
Teleporting to a house and getting full run energy along with a teleport back to lumbridge definitely involves the issue you're claiming. In the case that they're f2p, what are they going to do after sprinting around at maximum speed doing the first couple quests? Kill some chickens with the slow as hell combat system just to get 1/7 of a level per kill with a bronze sword? 
---
Not saying that this is how it should be, just saying this is how it is and is in the nature of the game itself. Being forced to walk makes you appreciate the size of the world and look around at first because like you said, later on travel becomes trivial. It's the same reason why in WoW they don't let you fly in new zones - because it takes away from the immersion of being in a huge open world when you can just ignore everything and literally fly past it. 
---
I play OSRS not because I want to be stuck in the 2007 version, but because the game is very unique and unforgiving. (Except maybe a little less unforgiving because of the death timers but that's a whole other can of worms). I enjoy QoL updates such as the smithing/fletching/cooking interface reworks because it makes the game slightly smoother but not necessarily easier. Increasing the amount of stamina players have to me doesn't seem like QoL, just a bandaid for an issue created by impatient players.
---
They're good they just completely and utterly determine the play-style you choose and limit what challenges you can realistically do
---
Pretty sure all the ironmen complaining about this used to boost for a rune pouch... The IRONy...
---
The issue isn‚Äôt that they improve, the issue is that they only improve because (usually) rich white people take an interest in the area. The subsequent increase in living costs in the area means the (usually) poor minorities that lived there are driven out. That‚Äôs why gentrification is a problem.
---
He's right, the majority of the playerbase does not pvp, but that doesn't mean we should cater to any specific group of players. The game should be balanced with integrity in mind instead of pulling a League of Legends and only releasing skins for the most popular 10% of champions.
---
See above.
---
Finally one done right where the joke is at the fucking end thank Saradomin
---
Imagine thinking a youtuber cares about their schedule.
---
I understand the folks standing up so the games doesn‚Äôt become super casual but that little bit of handholding got me deep enough into the game so I could figure out what goals I wanted to shoot for. 
---
The previous times I tried would have probably been better if I had been on PC, it‚Äôs hard as fuck to figure out the icons and travel efficiently on mobile if you‚Äôre new. The floating world map on runelite is huge QoL and made it a lot less painful.

There's only 2 locations with 2 silver rocks and none with any gold in all of Zeah. If you're fully invested in harvesting silver might be a little better but it's still an overall very slow skill.

Jarred
---
Also known as a comical exaggeration
---
Complaining about him here achieves nothing. 
---
If you truly want to crusade against him your best choice is to try to prevent him scamming others by warning the people in duel arena if he's there. 
---
Unfortunately Jagex don't take stance on this because it's your responsibility to check the duel options. 
---
Ignoring the subreddit rules will just result in you not being able to participate here in the future.
---
Add in that most people don't care about an individual getting scammed as it is frankly easily avoided and you can see why you're getting some of the responses you are. 
---
Just learn from this, it's really all you can do.
---
There are so many great designs in the game that would only need to be repurposed for player gear, but instead we just get endless recolors and shitty add ons for existing items. As much as I love my dual scoped repeating tentawhip and rainbow oscillating ancestral robes could we get some actual content one of these days?
---
Everyone chooses one skill to be 99 from the start.
---
I think the bounty hunter loot crate is a great idea, it inspires pvp orientated accounts to do some skilling to get the best rewards from BH crates and stops them bloody botters from farming supplies aside from Emblems. I feel the emblems could be added depending on the kc of the player. Currently every account needs 48hrs of gameplay before taking part. Then, if at 100kc you get a chance to roll teir one emblems, 200kc have chance to roll T1/T2 emblems and so on, a bot would be spending a lot of time per account to actually get to 100kc. 
---
Pj timer = 20 seconds
---
Lvl 3 bot killing another lvl 3 bot duration = 40 seconds
---
total time to get to 100kc = (40x100)+(20x99) = 5980 seconds/60 = 100 mins = 1hr 36mins on top of 48 hours to get one account to 100kc, to then only have a chance to roll a T1 emblem
---
If players then do not have a chance to upgrade emblems if they kill another with one, instead maybe having a chance to drop a loot crate or drop 75% of the emblem worth in cash it again would reduce bots profit.
---
When I was 15, I convinced my first girlfriend to try out RS. I made plans with my best friend beforehand and while I was showing her around south of Draynor, I had my friend come up and light a heart-shaped fire just like this one, with me and my gf in the middle. She loved it.

You can use [this calculator](https://www.calcusource.com/calculators/bestherbs) or the [wiki calculator](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs). I prefer Calcusource because you can choose to base it off OSB prices.

I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thought of this when I saw it haha.

Get punished for small brain decisions

That is definitely in my top 5 things I've seen this week. Thanks!

Also pay attention at the change sequence. sometimes it doesnt show the animation of his attack and it might have shot the first mage/range attack.

i died a few times because i didnt focus on that and got onebanged

Could probably make it a bit faster by using the 50k exp lamp on it?

I was under the impression that even buying was bannable, just not on the first offense.

revealing just a username isn't enough to hack an account lol

May being a better meme factor than Johnson is this year's disappointment in politics
---
I don‚Äôt really understand the lose everything meme. The trophy cup you get goes to the main game. This is a similar type of item to a cape of accomplishment. You‚Äôre essentially grinding for this item(or the other cosmetics if an iron). You don‚Äôt say 99 smithing is a waste because you lose all your money and bars for a cosmetic skill cape. 
---
I get it‚Äôs not for everyone, but I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt see the appeal at the same time. 
---
I‚Äôd rather spend 2 months grinding and get the dragon cup, than spend 2 month grinding to get 99 agility on the live game.
---
Tell your friend it's "tried"

In short. No

Long format.

Making a reward shop for pking points earned with each kill makes more sense. But even that would be abused, so no.

I have come to the conclusion that points don‚Äôt matter lmfaoo

I believe its part of Ghosts Ahoy quest

Yup pretty sweet, but the base 4x is all u need for todt imagine being a walker LUL

You know ironmen just don't get the pvm drops at all right? Like you don't get a bcp you can't pick up, there's just no loot
---
My black friend was the one who actually did a research project on this subject because he was curious about the effects that it had and had assumed that they were negative. He was surprised to find that there were actually many good things that gentrification could do for an area. Maybe you should do some research before talking out of your ass.
---
What about Medium format?
---
I strongly recommend skipping questions you don't feel informed about, that's the option exists.
---
Well it would be good with the crystal armor but archer i is too good
---
Twitch streamer got banned mid stake after winning a big community chuck, the guy doesn't RWT as we can clearly see his bank every day so either Jagex decided to take a stance banning community chuck streams without publicly announcing it first, or he got banned because of a viewer buying/selling gold traded to him.   
---
Can a J mod look into it and give a ruling?
---
Why would people do that? You can kill the regular gauntlet boss with no armor, let alone t3 armor. It's a complete waste of time to make anything past t1.
---
deserved
---
@JagexSupport or the official support page to submit an appeal.
---
Ban anyone who says v6
---
i was introduced to it by one of my dad's friend's kid's, he just described some of the skills and i was like eh im gonna get in on that. thought it was a cool game where you could do like crafting, thieving, woodcutting and all sorts of other skills than just beating stuff up
---
I'm having a really hard time deciding which one of these I should go for. Leveling smithing would become a lot easier with the gatherer perk but probably being able to choose your slayer task is even better than gatherer. It will probably become really repetitive though.
---
Always nice to scroll down the streamer list and see bunches of these "Chuckers" begging for GP to stake. No lost sleep over these lot getting banned.
---
True I guess, I was honestly going to give it a try because it does sound fun.. But just the idea of losing all the progress and no pvp or real competition kinda put me off.. They should at least put a safe minigame or like dungeoneering type teamwork for rare cosmetics but kinda feels like they didn't think it thru.. I'm already late I feel like it would suck to start now and there's already hundreds of people ahead of me playing 15h/d it'd be hard to catch up or feel worthful.. I guess it would be kinda fun for like 2 days tho just a waste of bond for me atm
---
&gt; But the game itself has plenty good content?
---
There a setting for it?
---
One common mistake most people make is walking through the spider, which will make it so the spider won't block the gas. Be sure to walk around the spider and it should work.
---
Pretty sure at 99 if you have double exp, artisan, and harvester you can get well over 6M exp per hour
---
They should add like a safe minigame for cosmetics literally feels no point to train without pvp. I'm not saying I'm good at pvp I suck balls but anybody can sit and kill a boss the thrill comes with some risk like wildy slayer
---
Plus it's one of the best ways to get started with random resources and cash

I love it! But if I'm being honest, the only way I'm using this (and I want to use it!) is if I can "Export Current Loadout to OSRS Loadouts" from RuneLite.
---
Also, being able to export my loudout as a bank tab format so I can then import into RuneLite would be dope.
---
Just never fight back ;)

do the one with the blast furnace dwarves

The problem is everything gets voted down and they have to do something. A bit of compromise would have completely avoided this.

I don't think you understand how this meme works at all.

Ye. Been this weird obsession with Yaks lately. It‚Äôs the new cabbage. Jagex saw that the RS3 fan base liked Prezleek and said, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs see if we can profit from that popularity some; players seem to really like Yaks.‚Äù

Never when they're a fucking pedo.

They can ban anyone at any moment for no reason whatsoever and are under no obligation to give reason. Also I love how we went from "this guy got banned" to "Jagex changed the rules" like wtf do you guys just blindly echo?

People will sacrifice millions on main accounts to get 100k, much less difficult to obtain items like sanfews and brews, it isn't uncommon to have this situation.

Ive legit been there for about a week now... never noticed the little gnomies
---
GP prices are currently at 0.39 USD/m because the Duel Arena DDOSer dumped over 90B in one day.
---
I don't think it'd kill the game off. I really don't think people who sell kills are keeping it alive
---
Theoretically if it‚Äôs a port they can stretch/expand it to a larger map size then it originally was.
---
Hell they vicious even mash up a couple rs3 maps into one zone and it‚Äôd still feel new to me
---
TIL there is a clock sound. #nogamesoundgang
---
What have you been doing for looting bags then?? Ive been forced to boost for pouches and bags.
---
\&gt;  That‚Äôs a lack of game knowledge on their part.

Been here since 2004, never knew that.

And just because there are no rules doesn't mean you should be an arse about it, we live in a society.

This is so fucking disgusting. I can not believe this is true.

I have bought over 1.000 vials of diarrhea

No worries I thought you meant in the first version that it cuts whatever fish you click on and not the top in your inventory, just a misunderstanding.
---
Honestly curious, what do you enjoy about this guy? He's loud, obnoxious and pretty fucking dumb overall.
---
I can understand enjoying High Risk fights when he actually did those because despite how much I hate him, he's a damn good High Risker. But do you actually enjoy his personality?
---
Just out of curiosity, do you also enjoy SparcMac and Ice Poseidon?
---
This needs to happen as an unpolled change. No pker would vote no to this.
---
Is this also the only way to skull up in TL?

Very nice, How did you go about it? I'm still around 20 crafting and haven't planned how I will level it up.

I have quit because every time I make money I end up staking it. If the duel arena is removed I would play again

I'd go back to the 80's and kill my mother so i was never born and have to experience 2016 when people dressed up as clowns and just stood there in the dark looking at people.

With bonds reaching 6mil+ unfortunately it isn't worth your time or very feasible to farm one out, especially on f2p. Plus, your account and gametime would just become a gp/hr farming simulator. I'd recommend just playing on f2p for a bit if cash is tight, or if not then just pay for membership so you can actually play the game

Also carry coins with you to chop down the normal trees/ or fruit trees (if u don't need the fruit), by right clicking and paying  the farmer next to the patch, saves time, took me until lvl 80 farm to realise this...

Smh, not the point of the post man, I find fun in both scenarios
---
Granted, but it doesn't appear in the log

What's your point? Turn on the profanity filter if naughty words offend you that much, like holy shit. Not agreeing with what the guy is saying at all, but stop trying to censor people when you can literally censor curse words in your settings.
---
BH has been that way since inception though? EVERYBODY, Jagex included, knows that's how BH works. It's not sketchy at all, did you want a rune pouch when iron came out? Buy an emblem. Well, you're already buying one, why not buy five more for some supplies?

Its always been this way, Jagex 100% knows that getting help, despite it being against the spirit of the game mode, is absolutely the best way to go.
---
Stone chests are fucking great! if you only thief the south western chest you always get sent to the same entrance so you will eventually drop aggro. also besides cutting the gems you can also chisel them into tips so they become stackable and you dont have to drop/bank them; also if you're accumulator gang you can high alch the robes for basically no cost, they only give you 70 gold but with 95% saved runes thats still a big net positive and "free" mage exp. Your inventory will basically never fill up since all drops are either fully recyclable or stackable!
---
You realize this is the Internet and you can ignore people?
---
Smart man right here.
---
It's not that. The gaming community has become so desensitized to this kind of language that people use it jokingly, they say it just to make themselves laugh/trigger the other person.  They get off to it. In no way is it right, but more or less you see this in any community. PKers specifically are gratuitously toxic "for fun". Unfortunately there's no point in trying to ban all of them because more will just pop up. 
---
Your best bet is to try and understand that these cunts in no way represent the community as a whole, and they are the 1% of the OSRS community in that in general, most people are better than that and agree with you.
---
"when you buy and delete 4chan"
---
"What did you expect? You know what they say..."
---
"Must be new to the internet lmao"
---
It just shows from replies that this community is fucked, you're allowing racism and Jagex is standing by idle with their hands behind their backs doing nothing?  This shouldn't be a thing being said within game.

You are now visually in one location, and actually at another.

I only recently discovered that too, appreciate the info!
---
Thanks for providing clear suggestions!  
---
And here I thought that Konar's Blessing would be an obvious choise over Treasure Seeker for me...
---
Tbf, an ironman that truly believes in the game type won't use this
---
Depends what you want to do, a lot of people went unnatural selection, I went 3x harvester. Pros: herblore is super easy (I have unlimited prayer/attack/etc pots already), so is WC (if I need planks for con or something) and any other gathering you can imagine. Also, the reduced farming ticks is actually really nice (sometimes it's hard to leave the farming guild and hosid patch because everything grows so fast!), and also affects hespori spawning. Cons: some things like aerial fishing are actually hindered by the 3x resources and makes it even more click intensive to constantly empty your inventory. Farming contracts without unnatural selection are fine, but you can screw yourself on slayer (especially if you set her to ignore your combat level); getting brutal dragons or something before you're ready. As such, I'm combat ~98 and still havent remove her level-check setting just in case, although once I have enough points banked to start skipping tasks that kind of acts as a workaround. Hope this rambling helped!
---
emerald should have been the lower tier gem, litterally unplayable.
---
Oh yea, thanks for the suggestion.

If u would have reported him ingame, something would have been done. But instead u wana share it with the world for attention
---
Hardest choice for me was t5, I took wisdom and now really want to try faster attack speeds, very tempted to make an alt
---
Ah yes, the old present a very extreme proposition so a not quite so extreme compromise seems reasonable tactic.
---
This sounds really good tbh. I just can‚Äôt seem to bring this to jmod attention :(
---
and now give that man 50k $ and tell him if anyone touches him he dies...suddenly hes gonna manslaughter them all... your argument doenst make sense
---
Doubtful, I have a bug which stops instances and I reported it back in 2016 and gave the video to a J Mod, it's still not broken.  I will release for attention soon.
---
Good.
---
Im assuming your comment is a joke
---
You have a funny feeling that you have been blessed by reddit.
---
But the probability of getting that role for the skirt is increased since killing all of the brothers increases the probability of getting a piece of gear
---
Play an ironman then.
---
Make it have a fletching req so fletching is actually useful.
---
There's a boss somewhere calling someone into their office with nothing but extreme disappointment in their heart.
---
"I gave you... One job..."
---
It depends what you want to do 
---
A lot of the higher tier tasks are pvm related though.
---
Skilling is just easy points for level 20,40,60,80,99 and base levels 30,40,50,60
---
thanks for this. I think the main drawback with picking harvester is that it slows down any grinds you want to do where you don't want to keep the resources. How impacftul as this been?
---
Also getting steel/iron dragons would suck but maybe the level cap takes care of that
---
For those interested in my YouTube series! https://www.youtube.com/user/szlindsaysd

You sound so pretentious lmao. Changing game code and responding to a report are two completely different things that require a lot of difference in the amount of effort. Runescape is riddled with bugs, they‚Äôll never get them all.
---
Wait... Standing next to the wall prevents them from doing the jump attack.
---
No we all just realise words are just that. Words. Get some thicker skin.
---
I‚Äôm surprised no one has 99 slayer yet.

What would the implications of this be?

How many times have you done any of the above? RS3 can be simplified and ridiculed in much the same way if you just want to be a troll about it.
---
Yes, pray flicking while gear switching while moving and counting boss attacks/tracking objects and co-ordinating with other players all at the same time on a per-tick basis is indeed fun.
---
How is OSRS movement even poor? RS3 has surge, and rarely escape, that's it. If you consider combat for autists, I'd have to assume skilling is for even bigger autists, no? Do you even play the game or are you just here to troll?
---
Ok? I'm just explaining the rule? I've had an account banned for a bomb threat but never received a single mute and I'm very loose with the words, and I know this dude isn't getting any punishment for what he has said.

Can you get anymore pretentious? What are you going to do? Ban the guy from the internet? Cut out his tongue or cut off his fingers so he can't say or type anything mean to you again? Your options here are to either a) put on the filter so your precious little eyes don't melt when you see mean words, b) stop playing the game, c) report him and get over it. Stop bringing garbage like this to this sub.

Saying you're going to lynch someone's mother is pretty harsh.  If Jagex actually read the report they will see it wasn't just ONE instance of racism.  It's multiple from the same user.

I mean is his comment wrong? Bh is more popular. Old bh was 10m + an hour boosting too, it still is, except now we can fill two worlds during peak hours instead of 1. The boosting is easy af to fix provided they want to.

What a good time for you in 2006 lol

exactly. at peak times those worlds are ~1000 players each

Implying that an ironman account isn't useless? Implying there is a use to any account?

The greatest feeling you can get in a gym or the most satisfying feeling you can get in the gym is the pump. Let‚Äôs say you train your biceps, blood is rushing in to your muscles and that‚Äôs what we call the pump. Your muscles get a really tight feeling like your skin is going to explode any minute and its really tight and its like someone is blowing air into your muscle and it just blows up and it feels different, it feels fantastic. It‚Äôs as satisfying to me as cumming is, you know, as in having sex with a woman and cumming. So can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like getting the feeling of cumming in the gym; I‚Äôm getting the feeling of cumming at home; I‚Äôm getting the feeling of cumming backstage; when I pump up, when I pose out in front of 5000 people I get the same feeling, so I am cumming day and night. It‚Äôs terrific, right? So you know, I am in heaven.

No xp waste

Does my boost have to last the full lap or just the start? My idea is to switch to Agility potions at 87.

Bath XP waste

Torag and Gunthan have the lowest accuracy so it‚Äôs common to save them for last because you can tank them without using ppots depending on your stats. 
---
Bloodworms are easiest to kill once you get in the crypt. You only need like 86% favor iirc. If you‚Äôre worried about taking too many hits while running through the crypt, bring a stamina potion. Maybe bring a DDS++ so you can use the special attack to quickly take out a few bloodworms.
---
If you don‚Äôt have a pool in your POH, bring house tele tabs and play in W330 so you can use other people‚Äôs pools to restore and quickly make a second trip or tele to a bank with their devices.

It‚Äôs pretty easy once you get used to the rotation. Don‚Äôt get discouraged if you don‚Äôt get any Barrows items from the chest. It took me like 10-20 chests to get my first. Good luck!!

Your rng is trash lol, only 15

lmfao, I actually thought as i typed that about the sparkles if it would make it to reddit.
---
It‚Äôs a common drop from a common impling. I was like you, got pretty lucky myself running across one.

It‚Äôs literally a 50-50 chance

You need it for the first half or so. You fail the second corner jump 100% of the time if you don't have 90.

Ye dwh basically required...as for crush weapons, you have pretty limited options. Could get a lance from hydra lol, pretty high req though. Probs just gonna need to whip it, which isn't actually that bad if you hit both specs. Just start a challenge mode, pot up, spec, and if you don't hit both then leave raid and reset would probably be best. May be doable with 1 spec it would just take a hot minute. Tek is in theory 0 damage though so you shouldn't need hella food though
---
This is Wizard my guy!
---
best tip i can give is scout so you can try and get good supply low damage bosses  and not have to prep so you can dive right in.

It‚Äôs kinda like a destroy option on torso, like wtf is the point

i agree king, but polite and inoffensive discourse should be the aim if we runescape players want to be accepted in society.

Battleaxe/warhammer are probably your best bet. Switch to r2h right after it webs you
---
In this case it probably wouldn't actually change much. The 10 minutes you get for regular gauntlet is more than long enough to prep, so removing it would only slow people down or do nothing.

Yeah but that makes for bad memes. I'm a quality over quantity guy

If someone drops something, yes. However, if ironmen get crashed at a boss where they did most of the damage there's just no drop.

I.. you actually.. what
---
Unnatural selection makes farming extremely easy, and makes sure you always have enough ranarr/snap seeds because of farming contract rotating, as well as irits kwuarm and torstols for combat pots.  It also really helps for Slayer since you can pick a task once for the points then never need to revisit it.  
---
Arcane courier is extremely good if you prefer to afk.  I use it on my alt while I'm playing my main, and it has a metric ton of logs ores and fish.  It's meh if you're planning on being extremely active, but if you love NMZ training method, then you'd like courier for fishing wc and mining.
---
you could probably make just as much/more from slaying, or doing something other than clues? I'm trying to say I don't think that treasure seeker clue grinding is max profits in twisted league
---
Well then my I stand by my first statement.
---
Surely you've never made a mistake in your life.
---
If it was TL op is super unlucky
---
I like fury at DKs or tanking GWD or skilling methods that use prayer. It's pretty nonessential though so get rid of it if you need the money
---
Tons of people got de-ironed for overstocking shops on their mains so they didn't have to hop. I think it was Bonesaw who got de-ironed for doing it at charters to like 50 crafting or something. 
---
If overstocking shops for a marginal EXP rate increase and to avoid the hassle of competing with bots is "against the spirit of ironman" enough for people to be de-ironed I think essentially transferring GP from a main to an iron definitely is.
---
I'd guess its something like below but cant check atm
---
    xp gained = bone_base x (base_alter + burners) x TL buff
---
    where
---
    bone_base = 15 (for big bones)
---
    base_alter = 1.5 (for mahogany)
---
    2burners  = 1 (0burners=0, 1burner=0.5)
---
    TL buff = 5
---
That doesn't explain why you're getting 115 xp though its pretty odd.

Someone explain this joke for us simple Falador peasents?

112.5 is correct with no burners lit

ACCTUALLY SCIENCE SAYS THAT PEEPEE POOPOO FART BALLS
---
Not a huge difference he does community chucks in those people fully expect money back.
---
I guess you‚Äôre right!
---
I'd also take an occult necklace before mage bottoms. You can't do a takeoff for magic damage, but you can for accuracy.
---
oh f\*ck, slot machines....
---
Both burners were lit I made sure of it
---
Wait, for 99 slayer, boss tasks only. Whenever possible.
---
Well the purpose of my comment was more as a general piece of advice, but just because it wouldn't change much doesn't make it good. For one thing, it negates the purpose of gauntlet, which is to be a time sensitive pvm challenge. The reason that t3 gear is so expensive is because they want to force you into making choices with your limited time.
---
Was before ironman mode was released. I wouldn't say useless. Made a lot of money during launch days.
---
It's actually the efficient setup to go with, unlike the noob next to him w/ fire cape/barrows gloves
---
I sent in a bug report. Hoping it gets fixed soon
---
That would be ballin, well basically every big fight you have from dragon slayer, mm2 and song of the elves you can use ranged if you don‚Äôt wanna get combat levels. Except the final boss in SOTE you need to use magic applies to not getting combat levels as well. Good luck man!

Not sure what you mean, a clue is a clue.

Now get that on an Ironman.

I work in IT and when I apply for jobs they always ask what got you into IT and how much experience do you have fixing computers and I always tell them I've been playing runescape as a kid and I would try to download stuff on my computer to help me in the game and it would give me a virus so I had to fix the computer my self since my dad refused to buy me any more computers after I broke my laptop he gave me.

Open a ticket with Jagex Support through the website and explain everything as clearly as you can, include relevant screenshots for proof. They should be able to help you
---
13 kills with one pie at 80 slayer? Teach me how this is possible...
---
Hit the report button right there...
---
Only doing 1 brother drops your chance of an item so low it's not even worth it. It's way faster to kill all brothers to get a specific drop.
---
Xp/hr and time taken?
---
aye, 45k is 45k
---
Well technically I had two boosts since there are two slices per pie. I just went to the catacombs and burst the abby demons there.
---
i hope it will be made bannable
---
Jagex won't care if you are not a streamer
---
Forgot about bursting. Didn‚Äôt think of that. I‚Äôll do the same when I eventually get to 80. Thanks!

Would it make you feel better to know I got it on my second kill? :3

Staking 2: The Sand Bellagio
---
You're framing the question to jagex- as if it is obvious that they should allow you to have multiple characters and somehow they've made an oversight. 
---
I would re-frame the question to you, a player. Why are you paying for an mmo that you can't even make multiple characters for? The answer is simple: it is an incredibly good game. That's why you're paying for it, because it's worth the money you spend. You get dozens of hours a month easily out of it. It's worthwhile. 
---
If you think that they should be giving you multiple characters for your $11/month (8.33/month with premier club btw), and that it isn't worth it unless they do, then the answer is clear- stop paying for it. The fact that you are paying for it means you agree, with your wallet, that the product is worth it exactly as is.
---
Yeah I was confused for a second, I only use wildbloods so I wrongly assumed that all seeds were 5 per house

Nope. Keep an eye on Odablock's account since he seems to be getting special treatment. Just wait for him to get banned and then we'll know.

Did you try talkong to Brindt outsidr of Relleka?

Are you talking to the chieftain? The guy you were exiled with. That's how I got my back

Try speaking to the other brundt outside of relleka head south out of the exit then follow the dirt track east.
---
If you dont want any bolt racks in your collection log kill 2 skeles and 1 bloodwurm.
---
Yeah, that
---
got it figured out it was the guy outside of relleka im just a little chopped
---
If you do something after jagex says they will start banning accounts for it then you shouldn't be shocked when people start getting banned for it. Its not a 'omg I need to stake this quick because it's going to be banned soon'. Its 'oh we shouldn't do that because it's not allowed'. 
---
Deserved to be banned.

At his combat 50 slayer shouldnt take much time at all with nieve.

Jagex is a UK company, 40% is a passing grade

I agree however you can use red spider eggs and harra to make stat restore pots and red spider eggs are a lot easier to obtain. So you're wrong in saying only use for harra is energy pots

But I still fully agree there needs to be more chocolate bars

---
&gt; It's pretty obvious this shit is against the rules 
---
Debatable. RWT/botting/hacking are obviously against the rules in every game, so Jagex gives no warning for applying those bans. Accepting donations for "staking content" is a much greyer area.
---
&gt; Anyone with half a brain knows not to do something that's obviously in  the works of being banned by Jagex regardless of the progress made on an  official stance 
---
No one stopped using 3PC in response to Jagex's announcement of an announcement.
---
Thanks! It is my first pet!
---
You can ban them case by case like for the general store.
---
if i could go back and change my pick, i'd change it to accumulator. it's part of the reason why my range and magic are still at 20 and 1 while everything else is approaching 60

The "obnoxious vegan" stereotype. They tend to be the ones who are vegan because it's trendy in their area and also aggressively preachy about it, even going as far as irritating other vegans.

Interesting. I personally am taking konar's blessing since I took abyssal and doing clues without run sounds awful, but I do think that not having the clue relic probably locks out a greater percentage of the clue points than not having konar's blessing does for slayer. But also I think the damage buff will also just be more fun for me than doing the same 5 clue steps over and over
---
That is true. However, if you use roe or caviar as bait, it drops two of the fish for you if you have an otherwise full inventory.
---
Lol nah it doesnt really seem like that looking at his other responses. You're definitely confused here lmao

It‚Äôs a cool idea. Gets newer content creators in a spotlight and shows off the new mode.

I agree with ironmen that can enjoy pvp but resource drops from pvp content I dont agree with.

Gear upgrades are definilty forthcoming. Currently using full Ahrim‚Äôs with toxic trident for mage and god dhide + blowpipe switch. I‚Äôm working towards buying a ring of suffering to enable multiple trips with no recoil replacement. Boots are either wizard or eternal depending on how much liquid cash I have on hand and I‚Äôm using an occult necklace and god cape 2 as well. 
---
I like to think I‚Äôm decent at eating between Zulrah‚Äôs form changes and getting in hits while running to a new location to increase dps but I am sometimes lazy after a long day at work and don‚Äôt try my best lol.

Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking too. The only reason why this stands out I guess is because his tweet got a lot of favorites? It would‚Äôve be way funnier if it was the athlete himself

I think it would just make him poor

It‚Äôs 5 minutes regardless of what you play on. Just get in the habit of moving the screen or changing tabs.
---
That‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt used runelite yet
---
get the lance and as someone else said obsidian platelets and fighter torso should be good enough.  
---
Could also downgrade serp to nezzy and change from guardian to dragon boots if you need some extra money to buy the lance.   
---
change the Dragonfire shield to a dragon defender + super antifire potion.    
---
You could bring a slayerstaff switch to kill the undead spawn with since it can autocast crumble undead but not necessary since you should not splash with that gear.  
---
And if you only get 1 kill trips definitely worth to restore spec in house and try again if you don't land good bgs specs.
---
Staminas = 3 tile per tick, energy pot = adrenalin pots.

Hahaha I love silly mistakes like this

ok kiddo, I was planning on having a bad day, but I guess I'll have a good one now just to spite you.
---
Jagex has caught onto private servers.
---
It can be hit with mage/range. I just found it interesting that 1) it‚Äôs allowed to tele in there, and 2) it can‚Äôt be meleed, as you can hit ducks in rivers and ponds if they are one tile away.
---
For Zalcano, 4 is the best size for effort/loot.
---
I don't see anywhere on maingame IM mode where you need to compete with 100k people on a mere 18 worlds for a single impling spawn, maybe that's just me though.  
---
This grind is the level of Swampletics/UIM Karamja getting Lucky/Dimps scouted, which is far from your standard IM.
---
... and the time commitment to it longer than any other skill. If I wanted to max rc I could get 99 just grinding for a month or two. 99 herb takes a being committed to it for multiple months just to gather the herbs

I rely on my skills to make new gear and weapons and my poh to store the rest. I also allow myself to use stash units. Im still in the skilling phase of my account but I‚Äôm getting pretty close to moving into combat and slayer. I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôm locked out of anything by not using death storage mechanics and the looting bag. It just forces me to better prepare for the content I want to do by getting the skills I need to easily regear should I wipe.

Put your levels in and the xp/h in thousands for the skilling method you use for that skill, then mess with the top right number (blue box) until the total is 2200+

It tells you what level to get your skills to in order to minimize time to total level

69. and Same.

There is a guy in Rs3 that is starting a new series "getting 1 99 at a time. He says he doesn't know about you but I'm almost certain he does and tried playing it off as if he came up with the idea. A few people commented about you tho so he can't deny it now.
---
Occult pegs anguish blessed d hide and justiciar helm would be good.
---
I don't see why not. It doesn't make the game any easier. Just more convenient!
---
Yea it is, like day 3 of twisted league I was seeing endurance gang memes on here and was curious if walk gang was available, and alas it was!
---
one of these messages is not like the others
---
Smithing, defense, herblore, thieving, prayer, firemaking, fletching, farming, construction, hunter to 99 will get you past 2.2k total. All fast skills.
---
fun is 0-time. The reason people care about efficiency is they don't actually enjoy playing the game, they just want the dopamine rush from "finishing" it to happen asap.

Haha holy shit, I saw your post and decided try my luck too :D

I was once in the fremmy slayer cave killing turask and this guy only had a leaf bladed axe and d legs and i started talking to him and he said he was saving for barrows armor and a leaf bladed battle axe so i teled to the ge and bought torags legs and plate and another leaf axe went bak to the cave and traded him the torags and leaf axe just for his dragon legs and dude was so grateful! Him being so grateful made my day foreal i wish i had 1bil go cuz id just spread the love foreal. I still have his d legs in my bank to this day lol

Get off this childish game and ***RUB MY BELLY*** human

I have nearly all bosses enabled, other than elvarg, rfd and sote bosses so really dont know whats not right

I think it‚Äôs intention was to help combat bots farming a particular mob, this helps retain the value of the uniques for legit players

I used fruit stalls in Hosidius all the way to 53.

I put off SotE and DS2 for something like two months, just so I'd still have quests remaining a little longer.
---
I've found that Clues scratch a similar itch, though.  Not quite the same, but still gathering items you might not for other reasons, traveling around, etc. is pretty fun.
---
Is this why the gem trader never has any gawdamn gems?!
---
it helps keep uniques valuable. it's how the dwh at shamans for example shouldve been.
---
blackjacking
---
This gives me anxiety. I hate those damn birds.
---
You have to pretty much enable all the bosses- even the annoying Desert Treasure ones.  If you disable those, your points/hr will drop 80% or more.  
---
You can get away with disabling a few individual bosses, but if they come as part of a set (Recipe, Desert Treasure, Dream Mentor, Elves), you must keep the entire set enabled.  Disable anything that can hit through absorb- should be only a few of them.  Keep everything else.
---
At your HP and stats, with the correct bosses enabled, you will be seeing 600k-1M points/hr.  I have done it many times with those stats.
---
This would make bow pipe have an average dps of 20, I wanna see youtube videos of this so bad.
---
I'm saying it's passive though, just like farming
---
Thanks for letting me know, I rushed this ready. It wasn't perfect but hopefully people know what to avoid now. Appreciate your comment and view.
---
I was gonna say he's blessed only getting T Hams once
---
Yeah I'm not playing TL because I know I'll just get annoyed if I get a good clue or pet on the TL servers. I'd also end up hating the basegame because of the xp rates and likely quit soon after tbh
---
Congratz enjoy SlayerScape now!
---
Ah Alright
---
Hey uh quick question why would you say that?
---
Why would you use &gt; 1, 3, 5, 7 instead of	 ‚â• 2, 4, 6, 8?
---
Well there's an idea for a new account then; one skill at a time then you're **never allowed to use them again** :P
---
As long as you enjoy playing it I don‚Äôt see it as sacrifice :)
---
It‚Äôs all in my Poh in the servants money bag.
---
What makes you think efficient people do not find enjoyment in efficiency?
---
holy shit I didn't know there was a gem trader. They're supposed to have 1 sapphire and 1 emerald. you're saying they never have that?
---
hey king, while I appreciate the willingness to make such a pertinent comment, and I do thank you for that, I would like to very kindly remind you that you mean you're in the first word of your sentence. I understand that your and you're sound very similar and that mistakes happen. please don't let this comment of mine hinder your willingness to post great comments such as yours.
---
Check to see if you can glitch into the crafting guild quick!
---
Is there another ‚Äúhelp‚Äù subreddit for beginners or is this the main hub for all OSRS content?
---
Never. I even play on worlds that have a skill requirement of 500 and there still isn't any gems.
---
I wonder if the hoppers are bots or real people hmmm
---
I like you have an upvote.
---
Thats the same argument people use when they say why should I turn off the lights to save the environment if my neighbor leaves theirs on 24/7. It would still make a difference you just dont want to be the only person to loose stuff on death. 
---
My main argument is that unless untradeables also get dropped on death, which wont happen because players wouldnt vote to have grind graceful, void, fighter torso and firecape back every time they die(doesnt even have to be their fault they died), it would not make that much difference to items  being lost. I would just get dragon boots ornament kit, fury/tort/anguish/occult ornament kit, only use imbuded rings, use barrows items like karils skirt instead of blessed d hide chaps, lava/frost whip. It would get to the point where almost all your gear is untradeables or cheap throwaway items like black d hide that will stay alch price. Maybe some players will think twice about bringing dragon claws as their spec weapon and use a dds instead.0
---
 Also with ironman mode, no iron man is going to vote for a system where they might lose an item they could have grinded hundreds of kills for.
---
For me the biggest issue with the death mechanics is that it makes suiciding supplies a legitimate method/the meta for bossing. It just kind of goes against the spirit of bossing if you can get out of food and would normally die/tele but now you can just pick up some sharks and prayer pots and be good to go. They should just have a system where an npc holds onto your items(food and pots disappear though) and you have to pay a percentage of the items ge value to get them back. So dying is still a gold sink and supply sink but not as savage as loosing it all.
---
fuck off go virtue signal somewhere else
---
Intriguing
---
I didn't know that. I know compost decomposes 5x faster. Do you know of any others?
---
Well theyve already banned someone doing it
---
This was posted like less than a month ago lol
---
Its 1/20k but you catch an average of 1k fish an hour there. Not a super rare drop
---
Ive literally never physically laughed out loud at a reddit post before this well played sir
---
The answer is yes.
---
From my understanding if you do a community chuck and lose it's just like if the viewer lost, the streamer doesn't repay them. With a loan the streamer must pay back the loan whether they win or lose the stake.
---
I thought this said Morytania at first glance.. oops.

You mean steve?

I mean on the flip side plenty of things that did hurt the game passed with 75%. Does that mean we should make the threshold even higher?

Yeah I have a screenshot of 4m hunter xp and I would not consider that worthy of posting

might not be updated for post-sote? try enabling those
---
I just got it 1kc on league, easy points
---
Assuming it's 8 irits (before harvester relic, so 24 per harvest in total) per harvest, and they use both spots fulltime, thats 47 hours of harvesting every 21 minutes.
---
This excludes entry to the farming guild, the starting herblore and farming levels, and eating and sleeping. So  its quite condescending to talk about this as if it's not too bad.
---
I‚Äôm like 99% sure OP meant the title as a joke. You don‚Äôt have to get so upset about it.

Oh god

Spin the flax to get the slaps boys

I did destroy my rune pouch, seed box, and herb sack. (UIM B T W) So I could have more space to grind chaos ele, since I was gonna lose it anyway. How do you get rid of it if there's no destroy and no drop?

holy fuck lol

Big grats

I've done it before trying to empty. Felt real dumb.
---
And it's on leagues. What the fuck.
---
Where is the sheild (jk). Sick clue! :)
---
I think a decent compromise would me "2 times rare offtask." That still gives very substantial benefit for killing on task, while keeping it feasible to do off task.
---
oh ok. the guide i watched the other day is waaay outdated then lol
---
Hard disagree on that.
---
Either you mean rare to the point of absurdity off task, or fairly easy to get on task.
---
yeh vambs lol that woulda been sick
---
Untradeable items aren't lost on death in OSRS
---
Then why is it so hard :D

Nah it was just updated maybe a month or two ago

Whats your approximate HP lvl when you've finished the account? Or is there a calculator somewhere I could use?

92*2=99
---
Unfortunately bots have started mining these rocks. All wearing Graceful and immediately hop worlds, don't talk, etc.
---
I think they're going off accounts created, and if that's the case it's accurate within that narrow description. Still misleading though.
---
yeah, i mean making it much more rare offtask so it isnt camped into oblivion. look at hydra uniques- hydra uniques have remained stable in comparison to zulrah uniques. look at dwh in comparison to jaw. etc.
---
dwh should be like /4k on task, /10k-15k offtask. something like that.
---
I wanted my t hammers. :o was excited when i got em.
---
Thanks guys. Don‚Äôt have a max house (yet),  but this might push me over the edge to finally do it!

Not if a hundred people with the same mentality are scouting the young impling spawns with alts.
---
bro what
---
It was a buff, though? Before if you got a clue while skilling, it would go to your bank and then you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get another, but now you can get multiple in your inventory. Unless I missed something else that happened
---
A league with 4 relics: N,S,W or E. From that point you can only travel in that direction. If you get stuck you can be sent back to a respawn point
---
The icon where the quest tab is located is the one from leagues.
---

I‚Äôd love nothing more then for Jagex to bring Keldagrim back to life! It‚Äôs such a massive area and it‚Äôs beautifully created, imo I think they should add another GE there. I think it would be sick and shine some light on the area.
---
Coz u been playing private servers with me
---
You joke but I‚Äôd play the fuck outa some blackjack
---
That makes sense. I think for guardians, rune pick is a no brainer. I assumed it wasn‚Äôt for that
---
Yeah but you'd get like 5 times the points you need for a pouch, spend the rest on sellable stuff and make the cash back.
---
That, and woodcutting.
---
I don't see any craps, imma vote no.
---
Gz yo
---
Craps table best table.
---
You just want them to build you the best pool and portal nexus for cheap.
---
No pickles! I mean vambs!
---
Drop rate is 1/65 so..
---
They both increase your damage though, so instead of maxing 30, you'll max a 33 for example
---
If the OG game is still new to you and you're having fun, than stick with your main. Leagues will be back. I wouldn't invest all the time in leagues since the account gets reset at the end. Once your bored with your main leagues is a great time sink.
---
I'm not sure how much work this takes, but is it at all possible to design just a new map for twisted leagues so we're all learning at the same time?
---
The most fun part for me is that it feels like I'm learning the game again, and I think that's cause zeah is relatively unused for its size, so we're all learning new methods.
---
I knew I had bad luck at battows but I just checked. In 859 chests, I only ever got a K coif and bolt racks.
---
This is always the exact reply to someone who links that subreddit
---
If you go fighter torso and legs, the torso is -40 mage attack, just make sure you stay above -65 otherwise you'll splash your crumble undead
---
why is this here
---
Yea only 10 houre per drop not rare at all /s
---
Holy shit

Our god has spoken. Rune pick it is lads
