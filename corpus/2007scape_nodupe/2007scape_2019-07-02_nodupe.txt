Some of these boys need to do monkey madness
---
Thanks man, guess I'll remember that and use on a case by case basis. Cheers.
---
I'd hate to see monthly new cosmetics that some people get to brag non stop about and when everyone gets it no one will care anymore. It would be quite demotivating to the existing players who dont take advantage of these deals. Not a fan sorry. Not to mention the hoge amount of bots the twitch prime deal brought in.
---
If I repost this in hydrohomie, will it link only the ggx post or the osrs on top of ggx?
---
they label it separately, no way to tell if more bonds are purchased on osrs or rs3.
---
If we start allowing new home teles could the uri transform emote be used as a home tele for those that have unlocked the emote?
---
Damn dude I literally got both of these items in my iron today too. Got rune c now on 8th crazy archeologists and black mask in like 159th cave horror.
---
Some people are born with superhuman abilities that aren’t quite sci-fi superhero level abilities but definitely are there.
---
No drama? What about the pmods that got their status removed?
---
thanks didn’t ask?
---
Lmfao Jagex release insane profits made ladt yeat
---
You’re a grump
---
Are we really still acting like cosmetics have no effect on the game? Go take a look at RS3 and tell me cosmetics don't affect the game. 
---

---
Are we also going to act like cosmetics don't have value? Just because they don't give you more xp/hr or a higher max hit doesn't mean they're valueless. Why do you think people buy third-age armor or dragon full helms or ornament kits? These all have value and provide very little or literally no use.
---

&gt;I don't understand the people likening this to MTX since they have also said that all partnership exclusive items will be made available to everyone at an appropriate time.
---
 
---
The fact that everyone gets the item/cosmetic later doesn't make it not mtx, if anything it confirms it. How is paying for something to get earlier access to it not mtx in your eyes?
---
Not to mention the fact that this has all the signs of Jagex just trying to get their foot in the door with mtx. Start small with things like this and soon the game will look just like RS3.
---
If the player base supports this now, the game will be near dead in no time. Two years from now there will be 5,000 players online, all using cosmetic overrides to look like clowns with glowing eyes, wings, and a purple aura they got from Twitch Prime.

I don't have dream mentor done so idk if I should do nmz before hand. Working on 99 thieving now

Hahahahahaha wilderness ass

Would you consider ely better than avernic?
---
I have a bank pin. :(
---
Lol, imagine complaining about this and calling it MTX when you can literally buy rsgp (without breaking the rules) through bonds. Literal MTX but everyone is up in arms about this lmao.
---
I think its so that you only have 28 extra inventory spots that need to be tracked. If you had 100 looting bags thats 2800 spots that could be full which wouldnt work, the game would crash.
---
they already set the precedent with forcing through f2p teleblock
---
yeah who gives a shit about a green pixel but expect this to happen more often with things that are a bigger deal
---
Bad thing is that the Tom user folder shouldn't be there.
---
Do you have placeholders?
---
I don’t know if this is a common opinion or not but when this shit dropped I absolutely hated it. I thought it made everything look so clunky and goofy. I much preferred the graphics we have now, especially for things like bronze-rune plate armor sets. It would be cool as a toggle though for those who enjoy the aesthetic more. that’s completely harmless to the game and I’m all for it.
---
Thanks for following up.
---
It's surprising to hear it's faster than the rest. I would have expected firemaking and combat to be faster. Get some strength levels first so you hit harder while you train attack and then defense. 
---
There are combat tutors just north of the castle in lumbridge that can give you some starting gear that should help a lot. 
---
Level 99 in a skill is 13 mil xp and rune rafting is sub 30k xp per hour for a loooong time. By comparison, you can reach up to like 600k xp per hour with construction.
---
Fear mongering.
---
Players: We don't want pay2win in our game.
---
Jagex: Uhh we already released bonds, making it possible for people to purchase oldschool runescape gold with real money 
---
Players: But thats different because we were already buying gold from chinese gold farmers
---
I understand the concern but I find it a rather big leap going from partnerships to actual MTX though. Do you genuine believe they will just implement things such as "get xyz item/bond" from twitch prime just because we voted yes on wallkits, emotes or colour?
---
I get that people are incredibly on the fence with just a mention of anything remotely in the direction of mtx. You have a fair point of partnerships not being polled at all, I honestly don't mind them partnering with things such as twitch prime because it spreads the word more on different platforms. 
---
I fully understand that people are completely against anything that doesn't get polled (integrity changes also fall under this, I think the concern is fully valid too) However, I also believe that the osrs jmod team deserves some credit regarding how they've handled osrs so far. 
---
Yeah I realise that there's been so much drama, I'm not saying we should sweep their fuck ups under the rug, hell no. But can we also take a look at the many things they've done right, owned up to and changed. I have not seen a single mod/dev team be this involved with a community that sometimes can be straight up unreasonable towards the point of being fucking stupid (myself included), the bar is also set incredibly hard for the osrs jmod team (due to previous failings: eoc, sof, etc.) I think the only dev team that is involved with their community off the top of my head is GGG (Path of Exile).
---
tl;dr - I get why people are so on the fence with anything mentioned towards MTX, but let's be real. RS3 is going to die, not this year, but in the close future. If these (so far) harmless partnerships are a way to get more revenue, why the fuck not? We still get to see blog posts, we still get to vote. They will literally lose a vast majority of the playerbase on the introduction of actual mtx. There's no way they will do it.
---
That is how rng works
---
Yeah top tier spell is crap ass gear is still OP. You can't stack a 130 w/o gmaul and an ags right? Means you have to bring an ags while with barrage you just need like 50k in runes. Mage doesn't have the same KO potential as range and melee but barrage can hit hard and has a long ass stun. You argue it takes RNG but doesn't stacking 100+?
---
It's standard procedure to only let people purchase a single instance of items that share their inventory.
---
"You have used your alloted transactions in the grand exchange for the day. Please watch this ad for additional transactions. *Coca-Cola commercial plays*"
---
yup, you can do one hops run and get all the protection u need for them too. instead of buying as theyre \~1k each
---
This was a shit update and made me quit to start playing wow again and private servers. The osrs graphics are a huge part of what make RuneScape, RuneScape.
---
Just did the quest with slayermusiq and it went fine. You must be doing something wrong

this is probably what i meant i haven't used it in forever. thank you for clarifying
---
[removed]
---
Made me laugh. Thanks.
---
It’s just that you don’t actually lose anything for free Alchs
---
engine work. anything that has to do with item storage is engine work
---
The general strat is to buy a few months and save hard. So you don't perpetuate the sub 10m struggle. I would plan it out so you get enough for two bonds at least. Blast furnace sucks ass but it's always profit. Most of your money will not come from f2p skills is the issue. Try to get a skill 70-80 before you take the free week, that'll get you more to work with.
---
Ahhh I seee
---
The ring of visibility is an item that even when its protected turns to coins in your inv on death
---
No paid cosmetics are acceptable. I don't personally don't think the promise of a rainbow tail is any real incentive to the majority of potential new players.  
---
OSRS has been growing steadily since it started getting quality content updates, MTX assisted growth leads to a playerbase that is more generally complacent with MTX, and the cycle continues from cosmetic to XP.  
---
Whatever it is they are doing now, is either incredibly insidious or genuinely misguided.
---
Oof, last time I read it I thought it wasn't there. Guess I'm just blind
---
which of these are actually rare?

They’re cosmetic and one was just for completing the halloween event, what does it matter if they’re rolled out for free

While I appreciate hundreds of different house styles, could you PLEASE address one QoL aspect of PoH regarding construction?
---
Teleport to house, click settings, click house icon, switch to building mode. Teleport out.
---
And the next time, same routine all over again.
---
Would it really be so difficult to leave the house in the last setting used i.e. normal / building mode?
---
Until you actually max out Construction, we spend more time in building mode than not, and this mode reset is the most annoying thing ever.
---
Any game that loses half of their entire playerbase to ONE THING should not have done that thing.

I can’t click it 🙈

I wonder if having an authenticator being mandatory for account creation would cut down on bots, making registering accounts more tedious.

Dusts and steams work out quite a bit cheaper, since you usually use 3 air combo runes per teleport. Dusts are like 3 or 4 go ea VS mists  nearly 100 ea (last I checked).

Phishing streams and bot farm owners taking advantage of twitch prime and mobile promos for cheap/free membership.
---
There needs to be some sort of hurdles in place to make this not as lucrative and worth it for farmers to easily take advantage of, while hopefully not being a huge pain in the ass for legitimate players to use. 
---
I know your chinese overlords need to inflate active users and sub numbers for the company sale, but this is fucking damaging to the game and needs to be taken care of already.
---
And twitch has been twiddling their thumbs and sticking them up their ass regarding the phishing streams for years now. 
---
Shouldn't even partner before these things get done. But thats not going to happen.

I already have full gracefull and 65 agility, so i dont think i'll have a problem with that, the thing would be coal bag which requires some grinding at motherlode mine and ice gloves, i know RC can be pretty good once you reach blood, because you can AFK but the thing is to handle grinding 44-77 running natures/cosmic for money or else lava runes  
---
I've been reading the blast furnace guide on OSRS Wiki, and apparently is really good money making, but i need to check it out a little more

No I haven’t , I’ll give it a try thank you!

---
So... you've gone from crying "Fear mongering." - saying the concerns of pay to win are completely unwarranted - to saying those fears have already come to pass? You're really not good at this, are you?
---
Guess it just goes to show some dumbasses'll say anything in hopes of sounding like they were right all along. Too bad you just wound up coming across as another fanboy screaming for all these horrible players to stop killing your favorite game with by subject poor defenseless Jagex to all this nasty criticism that just for some reason - any reason you can come up with - isn't at all warranted. Funny thing is, like I said, it's people like you who enable things like what happened with RS3.

I really would want to relive the HD era of 2008-2011. At first I didn't like the changes because it was so overwhelming. Then I got used to it and it was so pretty.
---
Also since 3rd party gp is so much cheaper it's actually cheaper IRL to buy GP from some shady website and use that to buy bonds. I would never recommend it because it could get you banned but it's much cheaper on the wallet and I do know people who do it.
---
I hate making bank while relaxing. Being able to watch Netflix and make millions is the absolute worst
---
I don't mean money I mean if the game stops attracting new players it would eventually die. I don't think it's urgent.
---
Call me an idiot but I loved this update. I wish current osrs would allow users to switch between the current graphics and thesr 2008 graphics, they can even bring back the nostalgic high detail/low detail screen we used to have.

Yeah I miss them all. I lost touch with the last one of them (Joe from Vancouver, where'd you go? ) early last year. 
---
I loved them all. Except for one of them. Guin (the guy dancing with the scarf and rune top) became a bit of a dick when he got famous. He made the main star finding cc in rs3 when those meteor things went out. It was and still is a super big and active CC. When that happened he ignored me and pretended we never were friends (even though he's clearly in the video for all the levels dancing in his rune armor and scarf). He then banned me from his cc when I asked in his cc why he ignores me. His in game name now is "navy". Super jelly he has that name.
---
But yeah the rest of the gang were some real bros and gals. Miss those days. Now it's all about efficiency and very little social interaction. The only social interaction I see nowadays is flexing on people on your friend list about how much dank XP you got. 
---
I guess we all just grew up.
---
I need this. This is what RuneScape really was for me.

with how militant and vocal a bit of playerbase is about much of ANY change, can you really blame people for shying away from active discussion about any topics on this forum?

Dude.... I guarantee you use all the ezscape stuff that is already implemented. NMZ, stamina potions, blowpipe, I bet you even use RuneLite. All these things aren’t that big of a deal. If you don’t trust Jagex to make the right decisions for the game, you don’t have to play RuneScape. You don’t have to give them your money. Polls are integrated for a reason. 70% of people who voted wanted the change. Just relax my guy.
---
Even if it's unlocked for free after an undisclosed amount of time, it's still MTX. Just because Jagex says this isn't MTX doesn't mean its true.
---
My hcim died last week, if I had known this they'd still be alive.
---
rs3 wouldn't be bad at all if there wasnt a million cosmetics, squeal of fortune and the new combat system. but then again... that wouldnt be very far off from being osrs with better graphics and more skills
---
Dwarven mine to Falador back to the dwarven anvils. You can even sell to the shops if you need money. I'm still looking for something faster than that

Barrows gloves and fire cape prob. Quest cape would be doable too.

No because they’ve been going on for months

The teleports have the potential to be the most damaging. The god teleports are actually pretty tame though. It's just the current animation but the book as a god book. Not a fan of the lunar inspired head circle one but sounds tame compared to the crazy cow we have currently. 
---
It begs the question what is the difference between crazy, outlandish, definately-not-Runescape  Easter outfits and these effects proposed here? 
---
Regardless, Im not sure if this qualifies as predatory mtx because it will be available for free to everyone after a period of exclusivity.  There's no pressure to buy now or lose out because if you don't buy you still get it anyway. 
---
In the end I'm not sure we will ever know the truth if this promotion is to bring in new players or merely a cash grab. 
---
And while I agree with the concept, I will still be voting no to any options that feel disruptive or that could interfere with game clarity.

what about fish level?
---
Lol..those 2 things absolutely killed the game. The fuck? Literally 2 of the absolute worst decisions to make for this type of game. 
---
Wildy/free trade is what had the game popular. In osrs now at least there is better pvm content to do, and PvP is the thing thats dead. But yeah from 01-07 only reason i played was for PvP. 
---
"Didnt kill the game" "only big things" 
---
You literally listed the 2 absolute biggest things besides *maybe* EOC taking over the mtx spot, but free trade and wildy removal was the dumbest decision by the company and theyve admitted that even.

Then go fish. Personally I’d rather do barbarian fishing which is more xp but gives no fish, then buy food.

"as a reward for a promotion, which you would have to spend money to participate in, should we add XYZ thing. This thing wont require any relevant quests or skills, and at some undisclosed date in the future we will make it available to you (possibly requiring lots of grinding or relevant quests and skills)"

SoF was out before EOC and wasn’t Mtx at that time you just got two free spins per day. Didn’t mind that. Good times were had up until the day eoc came out
---
No that would be mod husky.
---
you would definitely be better off throwing most of that money at training your stats. in general having higher mage/range is way better than having better gear.
---
A shit repost

I thought the sarcasm was obvious but I'll just add this here /s
---
There was a Jmod on hot ones?
---
when bursting/barraging slayer tasks (such as dust devils/ nechs) a lot of guides say to cast with defensive mode. 
---
First question is, For defensive casting, is the Mage+Def XP received equivalent to mage XP if i were to cast with mage only style?
---
And I assume they say that because mage training is "zero time" such as through magic imbue/alching while doing agility, however i enjoy training defense more than training magic, **so is it actually bad to not be defensive casting**?
---
An uninteresting title for an unoriginal post
---
Fuck that quest
---
not sure if rs3 or osrs
---
I would:
---
 replace dragon legs with obby legs because they have a str bonus.
---
Work toward barrows gloves. 
---
Get B ring and start doing nightmare zone for the imbue. 
---
I'm sure someone will come tell me I'm wrong but level all 3 Stats. Keep strength like 5-10 levels higher but imo unless you're pking 75 atk/def and straight to 99 str is silly. 
---
Have a whip for sure. Dagger is up to you and your money situation. Sara sword is a good, cheaper alternative for str training. Not the godsword.
---
If OSRS had a good clan scene I’d come back in a heartbeat. 
---
I searched clans for a while but it’s just people grinding XP.
---
One day you might be unfortunate enough to have to deal with crippling depression. If that happens, I genuinely hope that you lucky enough to not have someone who is like you are now around then.

I think you meant Tuesday.

I wouldn’t go for it all in one shot. Whenever questing burnt me out I switched to skilling or slayer or money making until I wanted to grab a few quest points to chip away at the requirements.
---
Imagine being mad at cosmetics that will literally not impact the game at all in any way.
---
Fally elite would help with gains
---
Because that's how it began on what was then rs2
---
Also, a lot of people don't consider bonds as bad as other mtx since it has the positive effect of allowing people to get membership without paying real money.

What are your goals?

If you want to max eventually, slayer now.

If you just wanna pvm, nmz all day everyday.

What use is 1 pair od tassets when you get the second one?

What use is a pair of ranger boots if you already have them?
---
It tends to be the thing with copies.
---
Honestly Im 23 but also started playing back in 05 or 06. And honestly the ge was a connivence when we got it here and quiet frankly i was sick of having an alt sitting in V West having to take care of trades while doing anything else on my main and surfing zybez. And honestly AGS being in the game is fine. Claws are meh. As for king no1 Pos anymore because you have two camps these days. You have your people who risk fight but once their out of food they tele out, and you have you're rushers and quite frankly no1 likes them. And you have these two camps because PKing has a huge skill ceiling and you're new players either rush or get smoked in a risk fight. Due to the death mechanic PvMers don't wanna get into king because PvM is safe af and people don't like actually risking shit anymore because their soft and spoiled by the death mechanic. But aside from that even the people who risk fight most people won't DM anymore hence a barren high lvl wildy these days as well as the addition of all the escapes and such locked behind diaries and skilling.
---
Can items from Scavenger beast loot be taken outside the mini game?
---
Although there are quite a few pvm bosses locked behind high level slayer.
---
The best time to start slayer was 40 levels ago. The second best time to start slayer is now.
---
God damn you are dense
---
That would require OSRS players to play RS3 though and RS3 bad
---
Hecc yea
---
&gt; Skilling actually had value
---
except not really because summoning and pack yaks made pvm/slayer &gt; skilling.
---
Which rares are those?

i hope we get something like this soon

---
people who are against this should band together and strike. cancel their memberships until we have clear communication that no in-game cosmetics will be offered. play f2p for a month and see what jagex says. in fact, ill cancel my membership right now. i'll see you in f2p.
---
Nothing intersting happens*
---
I honestly think it should be tied to both time played monthly or higher total levels. Gives a voice to people with weird builds but doesnt exclude the casual once a week veteran player.
---
Op is assuming falsehoods. Partnerships may require to contract free  third party trials, which if insubscribed, cost nothing.
---
So all that MTX cost will be to log in to other services to activa the the mixed promotion.
---
If its free mebership it only makes macroing/rwt worse.
---
If its fashionables  it doesn't really matter.

The quantity of updates and frequency would, I give you dat

Why does everyone pretend like bonds aren’t mtx? You can pay real life money for in game gold. That’s the definition of mtx. Bonds have cheapened every non Ironman account created, because nobody knows you didn’t just swipe mommy’s credit card for your bis gear and 300k xp/hr training methods
---
I most likely wanna max in the future but I was wondering if it was also worth it for the bosses it unlocks and that type of thing
---
Nor sure but i think cpu only is capped at 30fps.
---
OSRS by default only utilizes CPU.

---
Honestly RNG is a bitch. Unless ofcourse the attack animation wasn't happening? If thats the case there should still be a hit splat as these animations don't cancel each other and will wait for the animation to finish before starting the next one. if your hit already registered before the block animation finishes you won't get the attack animation, same as if you eat something in PvP to hide a weapon switch and stack specs.
---
I mean they did write that, but then the next section is about determining if a certain set of mtx is acceptable.
---
Seconded. I freeze up every birdhouse run.
---
Ranger boots can be made into the superior version if you got extras.  
---
Tassets can be sold for millions of gp.
---
A second jar is worthless on the ge.
---
lol all good. thats what really made me wonder like wtf
---
But also doing slayer will I  level up at a reasonable speed or will it be slow
---
What’s MTX? They didn’t mean Mex? Because if they did they fucked up cause I’m Mexican and I’ve already been added to the game
---
thing is, my weap did not do a hit animation or a hitsplat. opponent just hit twice in a row.
---
at least you will have a nice skin for your POH!
---
I don't remember much from the questline. It might be better that we are going into a completely new direction. Also, the reason why this is the least completed quest is because it requires 50 runecrafting.
---
Damnnnn nice find buddy
---
Literally incomprehensible
---
That's actually a good point. They need to set a maximum time limit before the cosmetics become available for everyone, and respect that time frame.
---
Makes sense. Runecraft bad.
---
Cosmetics are the business model of games today. It’s annoying as f.  Mobile games are pretty useless now adays. I can’t find one where you don’t have an ad every 30 seconds or immediately have to start paying for stuff to go farther in a game.  I hate gaming now adays like I’m happy with membership games now but it was such a bad rap 10 years ago.
---
Because it causes an underground market that spurs into the direction of rwt.
---
But they have in the past which is what I was talking about. What are you on about
---
You know, I think you're delusional.
---
Why?
---
Because they're polling this kind of thing.
---
Why does it matter?
---
Because we can just vote no on things that actually go overboard in the future.
---
But they could just ignore poll results?
---
Precisely.
---
About partnerships:
---
Will any future partnership will ever be locked behind a third-party payment instead of a free trial like in the past? OR Will we have early-acess paid MTX.
---
Will free membership promotions be available to newly created accounts in the tutorial island like in the past, with all the unintended consequences regarding goldfarmers?
---
Will you consider to add in-game requeriments like QP or total level to unlock the free membership from partnership promos just so it doesn't benefit goldfarmers?
---
You change your name in that month?

I have 70’s is my melee stats and prayer and 75 in both magic and range with around fifty in most other stats.

I just happened to get some alcohol on the keyboard which made my ALT key not work, which sucks.
---
Still the best keyboard I've ever had.
---
I understand where you're coming from but he's right.
---
Early game moneymaking is kinda ass and with the amount of time youd have to put in it might be easier and more time efficient to just save $11 and enjoy the game
---

---
The best keyboard.

By the time i had 99 slayer i got 97att, 99 str, 90 def, 90 mage and 97 range, now im just doing slayer while getting rest cmb stats to 99 and some good money from slayer doing mostly boss tasks if possible
---
Or a new player that spent his moms purse on bonds and was like yeah 5k of everything will get me enough to start pking just like my fav youtuber. I think atleast
---
50/50
---
So vote no on the things in the future if those things turn out to be going too far.
---
Oh, they could just ignore poll results?

There's cosmetics that matter, like champion cape, and cosmetics that don't, like PoH skins or hair styles or teleport animations. Who cares, other than people who should've quit 5 years ago?

You should be able to do barrows with a msb (i) and Ibans blast.  That’ll be your best money maker for a while probably.

Get ardy diary cape at least, shouldn’t be difficult even if btw. If you aren’t btw and have some money just buy obsidian cape. If you can do legends quest legends cape is also an option. If you have any 99s then skill capes have decent combat stats as well. In the long run aim for fire cape

If you have a laptop or smart TV etc, you could try finding a vid on YouTube of the jad fight, then have osrs on your phone and stand in poh or something and just practice changing your prayers in game to what the jad is doing in the video. Sort of like a real time simulation?
---
Dunno, might help you. I've never done it on mobile. Also dragon darts for Jad will help a lot, with 85 range I only need to tag 2-3 healers and then can out dps them easily. Just add in swapping the darts to when you're potting up on the orange mage.
---
Good luck!

With 73 range only it is literally impossible to kill someone unless they are not eating properly or lagg or are a noob

Gz on 96 fishing, narb

BWUK BWUK
---
Every boss is easy when you kill it 500 times. Hydra, Vorkath and Zulrah all punish you for not paying attention and doing stuff wrong. But ofc people wont struggle with those things after learning the boss mechanics properly.
---
Also turn off “private” to “friends” so they can’t add you and see what world you’re hopping to.
---
It's just discounted membership, nothing extra
---
That is completely false. I have killed plenty with 73 range. So shut the fuck up
---
Your question was "Can i be a good pker", and auto attacking with a bow to death is not that.The people you are fighting are noobs and a semi-decent pker would eat within max hit to make sure they dont die.
---
Yeah, RC bad. I understand

I WANT IT

Unlock other stuff first, superiors, slayer rings, maybe boss tasks, blocking very annoying tasks, etc. before buying a slayer helm. It's really only useful (over a black mask) for like 3 or so tasks

What if they had a clear distinction between accomplishment cosmetics and non-accomplishment cosmetics? Wouldn't you agree that offering more skin colors doesn't hurt the feeling of accomplishment in the game, since those aren't something you earn anyway? Or do you feel like even that wouldn't be acceptable?
---
I think as long as they poll these things before adding them, and as long as the polls are clear, then the playerbase will have the opportunity to filter out anything that undermines the meritocratic nature of the game. We might have a little bit to worry about in terms of clarity of polling, but I think they know better than to add something without polling it.
---
Where?
---
Zammy has a special attack, like all GWD bosses. Every so often, he will halve your prayer and hit you with a really hard, really accurate attack. He's supposed to use this attack every 7 attacks, but due to the bug, he checks whether he's supposed to spec you every 7 ticks, meaning he will spec you almost constantly if you face tank him, since he attacks every 3 ticks.
---
It was a bug in RS2 and has been in OSRS since GWD was re-released.
---
It's possible to take 86 damage in one tick, or 172 damage in about 4 seconds. https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/asu3ai/krils_special_attack_code_never_functioned_as/

You can do both ways.
---
If you're not going to get another master any time soon, then you may as well keep it and use the master clue as a goal (70 isn't too bad to go for, especially since you can boost from 65).
---
If you feel you don't like the specific grind, you can drop it in hopes of a different one at some point, but there's no guarantee you won't get a similar difficult step.

4.5k Hydra kc here. If you get the claw on drop rate, it averages to about 185-190k/kill. Without uniques, I still average 105-110k/kill. It's a lot more comfortable than Vorkath (easily 10+ kills/trip without TBow).

I'd say it's considerably better than Vork/Zul. Only issue is getting the task assigned.

I am just distinguishing between reasons to do Wintertodt (Axe, Tome, Pet), and items that are clearly not reasons to do Wintertodt as they are only useful in Wintertodt (Pyromancer).

''Complete Priest in Peril'' would be an entirely appropriate requirement for the Morytania theme though. You wouldn't even know what Morytania looks like if you haven't done it. Same for Regicide for Elven, or Lost Tribe/Death to the Dorgeshuun for Dorgeshuun. These aren't hard requirements by a long shot, but it still promotes playing the game.
---
It can reach the middle of my swamp ;)
---
I mean i think it’s a pretty cool idea, but i feel as if it would kind of ruin the game for a lot of players, atleast the part where you can adjust your stats. And if you have an arena like that i every world, wilderness would probably die out/no more wilderness pkers, and maybe that would mess up the osrs economy.
---
Thank you! Very good info to know. Unfortunately I ended up dropping the master, my farming is embarrassingly low so I figured by the time I get it up to at least 78, I'd luck into another clue.

Rare enough that if you go to the gate for the highest level area in the farming guild with it out and ask people how to get in they'll tell you to kill yourself.

If you had done the quest Underground Pass you could talk with Koftik right outside the entrance and he'd take you to the end of the cave where you fought Iban. Most players don't seem to be too thrilled with the idea that you have to go through the cave 2 additional times following Regicide (requirement for Prifdinnas btw), so the idea was making it so that Koftik would escort you to the well of Iban when you had finished Underground Pass. It would make Regicide less frustrating and new players wouldn't quit, but as you might imagine some older players weren't happy with the proposed changes.
---
I think the only way this will work is if a decent portion of in game worlds are made to be 'cosmetic-free'.  That is, all cosmetic items on these worlds are either just not seen by other players or not even allowed to be worn.
---
This is crazy and the JMod response here saying that there's a precedent for the weird skin colors is a prime example of how this is an actual slippery slope.
---

Runelite gives you a developer menu, which has a detached camera - all it does is enable the client code that gives you oculus camera. If all you do is turn it on and off, jagex can't detect that. If you use detached camera to walk and click stuff, they technically could detect it but in all likelihood they wouldn't bother.

I'll be voting no to everything, primarily out of caution due to a potential slippery slope. This is treading way too close to what I'm comfortable with

I had mixed feelings on this update. The character models felt so rubbery and shiny, which I really didn't like; however, the environments became really polished.

I remember how ugly the fire cape became for a while too. I think they reverted that fairly quickly though.

I’m on my way to my first 99 too, also in Farming. Such a relaxing skill.

But they will be meaningless. Even if you earn your own via in-game methods, it's the same item that other people simply bought by participating in the promotion.

Very few uses. Only worth getting prayer up for Rigour/Augury and either stopping there or getting 99.

*waits for players of light to act like OSRS is extremely diverse*

There are no black and NPCs in the game.
---
Didn’t know you can do that I’ll have to look into it. And yeah I always have my work caught up. Never behind.
---
This is exactly why the community would benefit from not being able to view poll results before voting
---
You just made the opposition's case for them. Most cocosmetics take time and effort to have, which is why adding promotional cosmetics would ruin the whole point.
---
Finaly! I have wanted to use my butterfly wings in OSRS for so long!

You’ve never been to karajama my bwana

It's either you make it a subscription based game or make it free to play aka Pay to Win but needs varied MTX(Xp Boosters, Cosmetics, Extra Storage, Pets/Followers, Gacha/Loot Boxes, Extra Character Slots) to profit off and sustain the game. You can't have it both like RS3, RS3 should be free because all the whales spending so much money on lamps sustain the game and subscriptions revenue on RS3 is just icing on the cake.

shes honestly fugly bro..her ass looks like shit

Was expecting a crab video to start playing
---
Unironically, imagine if firemaking and runecrafting had its exp rates swapped.
---
Imagine firemaking maxxed out at 70k exp/h using tick perfect magic log burning, but you usually averaged 30k xp/h burning maples. And imagine Wintertodt was a consistent 28k xp/h.
---
Then make runecrafting take like 2h to get from 1-40, and then ZMI like 70k+ xp an hour at the start, scaling up and up to 200k xp an hour. Bloods 180k an hour, abyss consistent 300k+.
---
Firemaking would become the nightmare skill while runecrafting becomes that easy skill that makes money without just being a boring bankstand skill.
---
And you’re a fucking asshole
---
Poh efficient
---
Congratulations! :)
---
You mean pegasians
---
Funny story about this! 
---
I remember trying to get my rune defender back in like 2006, I was like 9? I accidentally typed kkk instead of kk and it starred out, I was confused so asked a guy. He said something like ‘smh what are schools teaching kids these days?’ and explained what they are. 
---
I’m british and I don’t think the kkk is taught till later on due to relevance of it, or I just missed the kkk lesson in history back in my school days.
---
Well put! Never thought about it like that, but that's spot on.
---
I'd rather advertising billboards get placed around the ge than this shit. If you add these cosmetic items the ge is gonna look like shit anyway with everyone parading about in utter crap so fuck it why not just slap some advertising down and be done with it.
---
&gt;Is our playerbase just really dumb?
---
Yes. Yes we are.
---
I agree, I remember the 'just cosmetics' line from rs3 all too well... :(
---
You talk to Oziach.
---
Andd????
---
Definitely the rarest item in game though lol. That’s an insane accomplishment
---
(I agree)
---
And they said you couldn't make bank at sand crabs!
---
This is a really accurate reasoning - we haven't abandoned any quest line, but there are lots we just haven't continued yet.

The best part of this was when purpp told Mia to click the !jenna link and she actually clicked it
---
While that was true a few years ago it is no longer the case.  Jagex financials are public release you can check by yourself.
---
They gotta learn somehow
---
Well yeah, that is what i am arguing
---
A lot of people don’t like the idea of some things, albeit only cosmetic, being locked behind a pay wall. Members also already pay a subscription fee and personally if I’m paying for a game monthly I kind of expect to be able to at least grind for everything in the game. Also OSRS was resurrected with this feeling of grind rather than being able to purchase cool looking things for your character. It’s a bitch of a game and takes time and that’s what people like about it. Adding the ability to get things without puts a sour taste in people’s mouths. When I walk around and see someone wearing something really cool that I wanted to get I would look up how to grind for it and grind for it. If I found that you could just buy it that would completely ruin the fun for most people. 
---
In regards to the bonds being mtx that is hardly the case. People rarely use bonds for money (they generally use it for name changes/ membership) as there’s much better ways to get money in the game already and illegal third party sites that do it for a fraction of the price.
---
I hate having a good hit streak and full spec and hitting like 17, 16, 20, then spec 2 0s then go back to the high numbers

Runescape HD shills waking up from their slumber again, i see.

Nah man it wasen't like WoW at all. I just remember the new looking Rune full helms and scims and the blocky round heads and everything. It was so bad.
---
I’m sure they talked to the creators before creating this post. Pretty sure settled is there currently (or recently) testing SOTE. Pretty cool I’m my opinion. The content creating community has grown quite a bit, plus they’ve already got stuff in game hinting at content creators. 
---
Kind of a cool way to show appreciation, as well as provide additional support for them
---
Well I didn't think he'd actually do it
---
An apologist? First off you need to read clearly. I am saying that cosmetic and cosmetic alone arent bad mtxs. And my first post i said that usually this is more suited for 100% f2p mmos since its their only income. 
---
Im simply stating that cosmetic doesnt effect gameplay, it doesn't effect you, so why are you bitching about it? "Omg because it will lead to something else! It Will!" Says who? Because it happened before by a different team in whats essentially a different game? And it didnt just start off as "cosmetic" mtxs for the eoc/rs3 fuckfest. And again OSRS ALREADY HAS MTXS THAT ARE P2W. The only reason no one really complains over it is because it's quite costly. 
---
But seriously you sound like a fucking child crying over spilled milk acting as if its impossible for them to keep it at just a cosmetic. Which is beyond hypocritical when we already have mtxs in that of bonds rofl. 
---
For the umpteenth time for you because you're not seeming to grasp my point. If they have cosmetic only mtxs, there is no harm in that. It doesnt effect you or the fucking game. And no it doesnt mean it would automatically lead to some squeal of fortune type of garbage (which once again, you can literally outright buy GOLD from osrs).

Trust me when I say this. By 100kc 2-3 at a time, it will be the most effortless thing you do in the game.

I couldn't care less about the skin colors, wouldn't phase me if they were added or not.

The emotes are whatever, but it makes me wonder why now? And through a partnership no less. 
---
the teleport animation ideas seem like they would be better saved for something actually useful; zamorak teleport to chaos altar, guthix teleport to the center of the map, zaros teleport to desert pyramid, that kinda thing just spitballing here.
---
The poh styles should only be things players have to spend in game coins on without any influence on real life partnerships. POH have always been about being a gold sink and a way of showing off your in game wealth, and they always should be.

I really want to know who these partnerships are before voting on them as well.

Holy shit

Hey, if you want to take the exposure of OSRS to the next level I highly recommend collaborating with this guy to create short high impact trailer videos for the game.

Are you bringing /u/SettledRS to Seers' Village Courthouse?
---
The number a monster hits you for is almost always the same (except for things like justiciar). If you are getting hit by his magic attack, your magic defense and magic level will contribute to how accurately he hits. 
---
I believe your defense 30% magic lvl and 70% magic defense (or the other way around I can't remember).
---
Yes. Your equipment defense, your defense level, magic level and active prayers all count towards your mage defense
---
Hope people like it!

Amazing!

You deserve more my pathetic silver.

The lower the player base the great the amount of MTX it’s what happened with rs3, a balance is however you wish to see it. If you think the best balance is to not have them at all then that’s fine! Just take a look what happened to the player number of rs3 over time with they introduced and continued their MTX, it was only a very small % of people buying very large amounts of them.
---
its happening on many osrs websites
---
Lol where did this even come from.
---
Incredible.
---
Does anyone know how to get the character models like that? Or is the only option just roto'ing out of in game recordings? So much time!!
---
probably amazon server stuff, usually when lots of sites/apps down its that.
---
and? hes afking fire giants the keybindings are useless in this situation
---
It's obviously your provider if it's happening on multiple sites
---
I gave my friend starting out goals and rewarded him for doing them. I told him to do all f2p quests and get some skills up then the fun begins. After dragon Slayer I gave him a rune plate. After monkey madness I have him D scim and 100k. I just told him I got a whip drop from my Abby demons task and he asked if he could have it. Granted this was when he was still at like 45 attack or something. I told him if he got 70 attack within 5 days I would give it to him. Sure enough he grinded everyday and achieved that goal and got his whip. Big thing is to just talk to your friends and motivate them. Give them goal ideas and inform them of the rewards they get for it to keep them going. Eventually they will get themselves hooked and start getting their own ideas and personal goals they want to work for.
---
You're a god mate

How was this even done? Was most of that animated by the creator?

what bosses are you looking at and what gears you are currently holding heavily decides what you should spend money on next

Wowee

other people are experiencing it too check the new tab

It's definitely a possibility. We can't be sure because Jagex doesn't give details to how their bot detection works.
---
Avoid using a VPN and you should be fine if you're playing legitimately. False bans are fairly uncommon
---
OP troll as fuck mate, not worth.
---
Large if factual
---
Yes and the small number buying a large amount ruined the game for many players who didn't use them and was another huge factor to people quitting the game

No since the game takes place in medieval times and races were much more strictly confined to their native geopgraphy back then

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile.

As someone looking at the poll ingame, all ill see is that they want to add nice themed house skins based on ingame areas, sounds great to me.

The tone changes when my nice elf theme house tileset is locked behind some money transaction that wasnt in the poll itself.

Dude, you have some serious creative and technical talent. You are going to go very far in life.
---
Craws being that much was reasonable, nobody had one and it drastically increases your DPS. Df Ward is a very minor increase in DPS and the defensive stats are useless because you bank when you run out of invent space, not when you run out of food.
---
If you didn't already do so, focus on running back to wherever you died and get your shit back, unless you got pked then gg

Kind of funny how to anyone that isn’t familiar with old school RuneScape this probably  wouldn’t look that  impressive but to all of us it is some of the best editing we have ever seen.

Yeah, 1.45k xp. x6 plots = 8.7k xp, with about a 5 hour growth time. So, 3 runs a day = 26k additional a day. Which is like, 10 minutes of total work. Thats not including any special tree plots. Shit adds up.

They would be getting paid extra to develop something that doesn’t actually bring playable content into the game. Which means more developers most likely. I do not want the limited amount of jmods we currently have creating this shit for weebs who care how their house looks.

I do this exact same thing with a slightly different route and use Harmony Island teleport tabs instead. I think I’ll start doing what you do and using the Arceuus spellbook for that tele as it’s way cheaper. Thanks!

Sorry, uninformed, but was it on reddit? Ive heard that reddit can manipulate threads they want people to see/not see

Theres a dude basically making the game as difficult as you can make it in a weird area of the game for the amusement of us all it's been an episodic series well in 100s of hrs now we've been following religiously and this guy single handedly took him down for the fraud he is...
---
Absolutely incredible!! Had no idea!!! Nice high quality OC wow

No joke. Is not just the effort, but how it looks just like something out of the game engine. The set dressing and building are amazing.

Jagex announced a MTX scheme involving early access to cosmetics in exchange for doing business with their partners.
---
Since then, there's been quite a bit of discussion and criticism elsewhere on the sub.
---
This is really dumb
---
This must’ve taken ages to make,  I’ve never seen medals so well deserved
---
I disagree, game will die with MTX. It'll never happen. It would singlehandedly destroy osrs.
---
Trump, arch yourself buddy
---
To the top we go!
---
Yea ironically everyone was concerned that a Chinese company would add MTX since their market is so accustomed to it when they left it alone
---
You're not wrong, but that's a bit of a non sequitur. They said that the concept of free speech is applicable beyond government and you responded by saying free speech isn't that important to us anyway.

Just get the rune pouch through Slayer points once you complete your 100th task or something 
---
It takes extremely special and unique circumstances to get me to enter the wildy for any reason. No interest at all in losing a bunch of gp if a PKer comes along
---
There is a bit to unpack here. Essentially, a guy did the bare minimum and then "locked" himself to a certain portion of the RuneScape map called Morytania, which is this generally unused swamp area, hence the name "Swampletics". He plays on a game mode titled "ultimate iron man", which makes everything much more challenging as you cannot bank/store items like regular players can. He then puts in insanely ridiculous hours of grinding out skill levels, such as spending 600+ hours doing an awful in-game minigame called Temple Trekking.
---
Front page here. You’re number 3 on my app, despite only having 7k upvotes, and being surrounded by 18k and like, 20k.

---
Yeah I'm not sure how this spiraled like this.
---
Not appreciating Jagex being shady, and realizing the potential future problems it may cause doesn't me we should sit here and wildly speculate how the fire is going to start.
---
Don't get carried away
---
There’s a content creator settled, who has a character named swampletics, whose account is a certain mode that cannot bank items or trade other players, which is a very challenging and time consuming restriction as everything must be gotten from scratch, and instead of being able to keep 800+ items in a bank, you can only keep what you can carry.
---
He maxed an account already on this mode, so he created another and gave himself a rule that he must stay in a certain region. This has created endless content for him as what would usually be a short, simple task in the game takes him hundreds of hours, and he grinds out every goal he sets his mind to, creating a strong YouTube series in the process.
---
This video is a joke saying it’s all staged

I've never played runescape in my life, but for some reason i am subscribed to this subreddit (probably for the memes).

how about we unlock the option for non-binary characters via a Frankenstein quest? For his next bastardization of Saradomin's creation, the doctor is seeking to create a new gender, something entirely different than male and female. To do this, he requires the magic of the makeover mage.
---
After creating a magic potion, following thirty minutes of tedious running around collecting items and passing on messages, doctor Frankenstein tests the brew xerself, and develops features that could keep zuhaar busy for weeks.
---
Upon completing the quest, you are rewarded with the ability to create any gender you choose, along with high specialized non-heteronormative sexual favors by the new and improved doctor Frankenstein

Since you can't port soul wars. Can you create another game like it with xp/unique rewards. The game is severely lacking active pvp content that is safe. Being able to take max gear and go at one another. It's what made soul wars great along with good rewards.

Haven't seen a single positive thread about Drakes or Wyrms in all my searching. They're mediocre money by Slayer standards and mediocre experience in general. The uniques aren't worth nearly enough to non ironmen make them worth hunting.

That's not the point here, the ideas are cool, it's the execution that's wrong. For users that did not read this blog, how are they going to know these are all offered from partnerships? Are numerous company partnerships really what the players want? MAYBE. But Jagex is wording these questions in a way that does not show any sort of indication that these come from partnerships. It just says "Do you want us to add X skin color?" or "Do you want us to add X emote?".
---
It's the principal behind asking intentionally misleading questions that is the problem here, not the things being offered.
---
I think you are mislabeling "extraordinary skill" as "talent". Regardless of what you believe, the word "talent" has an agreed connotation to it, being that it indicates natural ability, not the ability gained from hard work.
---
Yeah exactly. Whatever the game I always rock the gear that takes forever to earn as a show of accomplishment and simply don't participate in MTX especially gambling loot boxes.
---
Because it's subjective. For someone who's ESL and from a different country learning how the US government works and passing an English exam is hard. I couldn't pass an exam on Spanish or French and I don't know anything about their governments and I took both languages in high school.

Getting employer sponsored isn't easy either. They have to be based in the US.

If I'm doing runs to the abyss and some try hard in bis gear decides it'll be fun to fuck up my xp/hr for a glory(2) what happens if I drop it mid combat? Will it immediately appear for them to pick up or will it stay on the ground for the normal amount of time?

It's still MTX, it's not "hardly MTX", MTX is binary, it either is or it isn't. You can make the argument that some MTX is worse, more predatory than others, and there are levels to it, but to call it not MTX or "hardly MTX" is disingenuous at best.
---
They are not polling whether they should do partnerships, but what rewards should be added. Partnerships are already a done deal, community has no say in that, its just what you get from them that the community has a say in.

Edited and added some clarification on this video

It can be annoying, but people being cautious on your behalf are the reason this game is still preserved so well.

Wow. This is next. fucking. level.

25k points is a 1/27 drop chance so obviously you're likely to go dry... Do some split raids with friends/clan members and you will have better results, raids is also just a stepping stone to ToB now where efficient trios are over 14m/h
---

I have seen the same thing and always figured that the pid did switch mid fight. Do you have evidence to prove that pid can not change mid fight?
---
What if I told you the green pixel never existed and it was a byproduct of the way the sprite was saved out many years ago and a recent re-save actually fixed the green pixel by accident so we just had to manually go back in and add a pixel which previously never existed.
---
But they didn't kill the game. That's what I said.
---
The game was thriving for most of the years I really started playing the game, which was 2008-2012.
---
The start of 2008 saw removal of free trade, and then micro transactions came in 2012. 2013 saw EOC, and that was what made half the playerbase leave.
---
To say the game is dead is silly, as you clearly don't even play it. but it has a thriving community, and still has new people playing it every day. And with the release of mobile coming up, more players will be joining the game.
---
This gives me anxiety

I really don't see the big deal if it doesn't affect gameplay in any way. If they drop stuff that is like "attach this to your bandos tassets for an additional +2 strength bonus!" for $$$ then there's a serious issue
---
Yeh, i do trios. Like 65k+ points per raid and never get shit. Those are just my personal points.
---
Garbage advice. Everyone knows you're supposed to smite superiors for better RNG.
---
Ah man, this is hilarious!
---
Schroedinger’s green pixel on the construction icon?
---
Not every slayer task is good money. Abyssal demons are beyond shit money and the xp isn't great, but everyone still does them for that slight chance at a whip. Drakes offer consistent cash per kill, usually 15k~ per kill I've found. DFS + antifire potion and it's pretty much 100% afk.
---
I understand that the cosmetics in the poll, should they pass, would likely be added in future promotions. I was more addressing the complaints OP had regarding the poll. The partnerships, as well as the length of time they would be exclusive, is not relevant to the current poll, as it is just for the cosmetics themselves.
---
Why tho?
---
Skip/block tasks you hate (for example, skip iron/steel drags; block spiritual until you unlock mages). Extend high exp/gp tasks. 
---
Kandarin dungeon when possible for totem pieces.
---
Wildy Slayer is an excellent source of slayer pts. I'd start that as soon as possible. Good gp and exp as well. Setup is key here so you don't lose your shirt anytime you get pked.
---
Focus points first on Slayer Helm. Then herb sack. Then slayer rings.
---
maybe i read the blog wrong but isn't it more that osrs is going to be basically promotion for promotion sort of advertising with other companies like they did with twitch? how is that similar to mtx?
---
Eyyyyyy, I'm doing the same as you: 85 Agility at the moment. Well, just adding indoor cycling to it, but otherwise in-game grind is the same.
---
I know the feeling how long it takes to train and how boring is to click the same spots and watch your character run circles. But now, your journey is over and you achieved something which many haven't reached. Congratulations! :D
---
/r/all here.
---
I used to play RS back in the day, but I don't understand this meme.
---
However I do recognize the sheer amount of editing and craftsmanship that went into this.
---
Minuscule if misleading
---
What program was used to make this??
---
While I agree with you that it is ultimately up to the individual to research, I disagree in this case as it should not up to the individual to stay informed when the host company is **intentionally misleading** them. Especially when Jagex *knows* a majority of players do not read the dev blogs. Jagex is using this to their advantage in favor of partnerships. And just to clarify, whether that is a good or bad thing is not the point.
---
Making a living playing a game you enjoy 8-12 hours a day on the computer = Bad  
---
Doing something terribly boring on a computer 8 -12 hours for a greedy corporation that pays you pennies on every dollar you make them = Good.

I bet you'd vote yes to mtx in a heartbeat, fucking robots man.

Depends on weather or not you perceive this lamp as yellow or orange I suppose. For me it's definitely on the red side

So we're all gonna vote no right

Holy shit this is a masterpiece

How do you even go about creating this masterpiece?

Could you explain? Isn’t it normal for streamers to have their own stream pulled up?
---
I was honestly expecting "now I only play sitting", given the nature of this sub.
---
For the record, you shouldn't expect any information now as to who the partnerships will be and how long they will last. This is a real business working with other real businesses. They don't know who they are and how long they will last. This is real life. They also aren't going to go into a meeting and seriously have money on the table with another company and say "this all sounds good, but we have to poll the players before we can close this contract".
---
That's what I was thinking lol, they make enough I'm sure so I doubt they'd care to scam that little. Who knows though.
---
the next update, so thursday
---
I dont care about mtx if it's in the state they are proposing. It's pretty fair that you get it even if you dont buy it. Plus its cosmetic so who cares. If it goes beyond this tho I'll be worried
---
But seriously though what brings you to this comment nearly 5 months later?

You think rs3's playercount plummeted overnight? No, it happened in baby steps..

i was getting 502's aswell today too, think the internet died
---
So will you quit playing runescape after this is implemented? Are you going to buy the promotional items that will later become free? If you answered no to both questions, you won't be impacted by this, and Jagex won't lose out on money because of you. Win win for everyone right?
---

---
Tipped you BAT, you can sign up as a creator to receive it!

Imo the style is quite unique from most other MMOs. We still have the tick based system which allow for some strange tech like 4TAA that I really enjoy. Not to mention I think rs3 pvmers user 3x more switches than OSRS.

Yes

---
Well
---
All you can do is hope someone trusts you
---
This is a common scam though, so i wouldnt trust anyone saying this
---
If i were you id go to a local game store (basically anywhere that nerds congregate) and ask if anyone plays osrs and can help you
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
Are you willing to drop $1750 on runescape? That’s not even comparable
---
I've never had an issue with fossil island, but priff has consistently lowered my fps despite having an 8 core cpu/rtx2080. What are your specs?
---
I was hoping for that, as the game doesn't have much going on for it visually that if would make up with content (and I'd take that over empty and repetitive visually stunning game everyday).
---
Speaking of relaxed gameplay, how's griefing like PK? I have faint memories of checking the game early 00s but being turned down by the amount of PKers, but I might be confusing it with some other game (Tibia?).
---
good ol' days
---
Jagex isn't going to help with this.
---
If you can't spend $7 to buy a bond to sell your ranarr weeds, you might be better off improving your personal financial situation before playing RS.
---
What is ad space?
---
Was just going to type this
---
Anytime mate
---
As would I. TBH.
---
Nice constructive reply
---
problem with voting no is that the questions aren't about whether they should add rewards for partnership purchases, they are about *which* rewards should be added, so even if every single question fails they're still on track to be pushing partnership rewards
---
I suggest finding someone in game to give you a bond and pay them back. Most will say no but eventually you’ll find someone
---
Your only other options is to make enough by yourself for a bond or spend irl money on membership
---
The overrides are part of MTX. The current state of combat in RS3 is quite good. Sure, *anyone* would agree when EoC came out it was dogshit, including rs3 players and jmods. But since it came out they have done a good job at fixing stuff that should've been fixed before release.
---
And yeah, while OSRS can sustain itself without MTX, it is never going to be able to sustain investors. I haven't looked at Jagex's last financial statement too deeply yet, but a large chunk of their revenue still comes from RS3 MTX, and investors will not be happy to see that go
---
I agree, however in this case Jagex is intentionally misleading players. Jagex KNOWS that most players who vote do not read the dev blogs.
---
So while it may be "on the player to stay informed", it also shows that Jagex is losing moral ground by omitting information that is being used to their advantage in polling.
---
Game developers have no business in misleading players like this.
---
You have 10m worth or ranarrs, but not 3.6m Cash?
---
Most likely not that much. Many people have coins they get for free either from their own subscription to Reddit premium or from getting gold platinum on their own comments and posts. Not to mention all the people who got tons of coins for free because they got multiple years of Reddit premium for free from the alien blue this g.
---
And bonds are mtx do you have a problem with bonds? They're still mtx after all.
---
i wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt instead of assuming he had the worst possible idea, but its true he could be thinking that.
---
these partnerships are happening anyway, we know this. theyre already happening and the fact theyre talking about making future ones better is a sign that more will definitely happen. given what weve had so far (twitch prime), its safe to assume theyll be for things that are likely to already interest you and not some shitty mobile game or whatever. and if it isnt for those things, well, dont buy it. sounds dumb, but jagex will know if a partnership was a bad idea because of not only crab memes but low engagement, and are likely to steer towards better ones in the future because thats good business. the only downside to you for not buying it is miss out on a morytania house for 2 months, which frankly i can live with
---
How tf did you do this?
---
Congrats! I did the same thing, it feels great running around with the untrimmed agility cape.
---
Make sure you have your tune defender in you inventory or equipped
---
you also need to remember NMZ is a thing lots of ppl max combat with ease and have no idea of basically anything in the game.
---
I have plenty of gold to cover bond costs so I see no reason not to use bonds. Otherwise I would just have gold sitting in my bank.
---
Will read when home :)
---
The goal of these promotions is to attract new players, you aren't expected to buy or subscribe to whatever product/service is partnering with them if you're already playing.
---
Early Access.. Not MTX. Patient people like me will not have to spend any money for all the new house reskins this could bring!
---
God Ash is our man.

How's it feel to be inefficient and not do 99 fishing at Barb first?

You captured the depth of thought in his eyes so well.
---
I played a LOT of runescape growing up but have been detatched from the game for well over a decade, is it worth getting back into it? what are some pros and cons
---
Ah figured it out, thanks
---
I have no idea what this sub is about or why this is awesome.
---
OSRS has been an untapped cash cow since mobile released with a vast amount of unrealized monetization potential. I am just surprised the Chinese owners didn't capitalize and took this long for them to begin introducing MTX.
---
Ah, I wish I had that problem. I'm still pinching pennies to afford stuff like a Tbow, so every little bit counts.
---
Someone give this man a bond
---
fuck off good thing I didn't have volume on &gt;.&lt; well played.
---
I have never seen more awards in my life.. holy fuck.
---
Well first of all, because of the algorithm.
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
Early Access is not MTX... Patient people like myself will have to spend no money for the same rewards you are getting.
---
Whereas my patient ass is still waiting for free awesome skins in league of legends, fortnite, etc.
---
so thats why it randomly turns on all the time. its cause i click there on accident
---
This IS my swamp
---
The details of individual promotions are business decisions, details Jagex themselves will only know once they start working out deals with partners.  They gave us Twitch prime customers getting the purple skin color as an example.  So we can imagine future promotions going somewhat similarly.  Participating in X gets you Y in OSRS.  It's not super difficult to imagine.  
---
Jagex is coming to us saying "this is is a thing we are going to do but to keep our goodwill we will not make any new items exclusive and you get to pick the items".  If you think for a few seconds its not that hard to imagine how these items will come into the game.  The more productive debate is whats acceptable?  I personally am fine with skin colors and about half the POH skins.  I'm not fine with any of the animations or emotes and will vote no.
---
this changes *everything*
---
Reddit account is 21 days old and this person already has earned: 21 platinums, 52 golds and 86 silver medals?  Hmmmmmm.....
---
Yea people aren't really understanding what's going on here. I can't blame them for being so worried; given the history of companies lying and scumming customers, they should be careful.
---
Dont say that I agree with Original commenter, but the new dungeon is mostly meant for Ironmen to get faster red spider eggs, and its relatively low lvl dungeon overall.
---
what about a possible warding reward where they would use their magical ability while warding, crafting different tiers of 'aura's (untradeable) maybe equippable in the ammo slot for example 75 range 75 warding would give range bonuses same with 85 magic 85 warding and 95 strength 95 warding giving bonuses in the other 2 styles it would give people a huge reason to train warding while still offering the lower level rewards but also rewarding higher level players
---
Pretty please. I want these house skins! (Although Elite Diaries is a bit much IMO)
---
This is phenomenal I want a feature length film
---
Little too generous, 3 fire would suit  his hell
---
I thought we wasn’t allowed irl GFs?
---
This is fucking brilliant
---
no one takes the high road when they look for a vote for something, just at the politics of the world, a bunch of misleading individuals asking for a vote and then not doing what they are voted to do.  The power comes from the person with the vote, not the person looking for a vote.
---
Hey r/all here why is this so highly praised?

The average person is not a reddit neckbeard who reads fine print. The majority of the audience can be manipulated easily by half-truths.

I am on the right side
---
TIL United States of Smash hits a 7.
---
It still would be very nice to have some assurance that we as gamers would be able to equally benefit from our new partners.  
---
Think Dollar shave club for example. Not everyone needs shavers...   
---
Spotify on the other hand is something everyone can benefit from.
---
why dhide?
---
Very well done. Those poor Palanquin Bots, they gotta have 99 strength to carry that much heavy content.

What the fuck

Are you happy with how skilling fits in the current economy? As someone who likes gathering resources at their sources, I find it super disheartening that the most efficient ways of getting logs (for example) is from killing monsters.
---
Dude are you being gaslit right now? I also don't understand what they think you misunderstood.
---
How the fuck did you do this
---
Ironman is fun but if you want high lever content like gwd, Cox, tob, 90+ in skills etc don’t expect to do that without Investing thousands of hours. 
---
But if you set realistic goals like getting a d scim or maybe even zulrah then it can be fun for you.
---
It works both ways tho, just as it is attracting people to OSRS it is attracting OSRS players to amazon prime. If you want the cosmetic as it comes out you will have to pay them money so it is MTX still.
---
The way i understand it these will be given out similar to how you could get purple skin for your character with a twitch prime subscription last year. so for example by having netflix and linking your RS account to your netflix account you could maybe have red skin. Stuff like this is what i think they are going for.
---
Holy shit that’s talent
---
What's a good kill time for your first attempts at Vorkath? Started farming him this week, no void or gp for a BGS, so I've just been using a blowpipe and full blessed d'hide with a salve ammy (ei) to get my first 50 kills. Best kill time so far is 2:35, usually average around 3:30 though. Is that around where I should be without having anything to lower his defense, or do I have some work to do to improve my technique? 
---
I'm sure once I get a BGS it'll shave some time off
---
I'll try to address everything.
---
&gt; Yet players often complain we're getting too many updates...
---
There will always be people who are overly conservative. It's impossible to please everyone, and there's already a mechanism that prevents too many/low quality updates from making its way into the game: polls.
---
&gt; Still, they've been steadily expanding the OSRS Team for years. A large spike of new J Mods would only be to the detriment of the game. It would slow current content to a halt since most of the current OSRS Team would need to train all the new hires.
---
I agree, what I'm advocating for is to keep slowly expanding the team. Change management is always somewhat destructive and inefficient, so that's not what I want. Despite this, achieving a core team of only 17 devs after *six years of stellar growth* is ***much*** too slow.
---
&gt; And then once they are trained, what should all that new staff be put towards? Like let's say they doubled the OSRS Team by the end of the year; would you have 4 massive updates like Kebos and Prif per year instead of 2? Or would you just want double the QoL polls (players have also complained about running too many polls and polls with too many questions).
---
An exact breakdown is quite above my pay grade. First, I'd want to have a team dedicated to implementing an optional HD version of the game. It's a better solution than just allowing third-parties to implement it in unofficial clients, because this way it does not interact with bot detection and proprietary content remains proprietary.
---
&gt; Another thing the "4x as many devs" ignores a lot of things. First, RS3 is a much bigger game with higher detail graphics and a lot of other things that make it require more staff for similar results. If you compared the pace of updates, OSRS and RS3 are pretty much on par. 
---
Of course RS3 is a 'bigger game' in that more work (overall) was put into it. My point serves as a reminder that, from a *business standpoint*, Old School Runescape is now the bigger game. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to pour so many resources into something that, by all metrics, is dying, especially when its main 'competitor' is flourishing.
---
&gt; And lastly, do you really want to just move RS3 Devs to OSRS? Because that hasn't always gone well in the past...
---
I don't have any precise plan in mind. I'm certain RS3 devs would integrate wonderfully with the Old School team given the proper framework. Keep in mind that Mod Ash (for example) was an RS3 mods before.
---
Have a pic of the rest of the loot?
---
The TWICE part killed me.
---
This is glorious. Well done!
---
120 rewards?! What the actual fuck
---
And that mentality is why this game is garbage now.
---
That's correct, the engine team is shared. I've edited my previous comment.
---
What’re the cosmetics and when will they be brought into the game?
---
That arrow is going straight into the ground
---
But they're still a MTX. Some players benefit off it yes, but every bond entered into the game, Jagex benefits from it
---
Any bond bought off GE doesn't matter, because that single bond wouldn't be on the game if somebody hadn't opened their wallet for it
---
Dragon crossbow or Heavy Ballista for COX
---
Just gotta drop it when you hit 99, and pick it up after.
---
Don't be sorry. We understand
---
why are so many people getting butthurt? if it is just cosmetics whats the big deal??
---
Oh.. in that case it's not rectangular enough :')
---
Ok so I went and read the blog after seeing this thread and I really don't see what's misleading?
---
It's just a bunch of poll questions asking to add certain cosmetic add-ons?
---
It's just like the twitch-prime purple skin, they had it for an extra day than us, then everyone got it for free.
---
garbage player
---
Google it
---
&gt;But there exists an already accepted definition of MTX
---
Says who?  Jagex clearly has a different definition and based on comments a lot of people agree with them.  
---
There's a dictionary definition of micro-transaction, and then there's MTX, which is something I've only ever seen in the RS3 community as a reference to SoF, Treasure Hunter, Solomons, etc
---
This is one thing we should be paranoid about.
---
It is happening as it happened in the past.
---
Do not minimize their actions, look at the facts.
---
Jagex is making less than they used to on rs3, Mod Mat k has left, a new corporation has acquired Jagex.
---
Jagex will need to show the new masters that runescape is still growing in income, with rs3 slowly dying and less people spending money on keys they need to do something with oldschool to keep the profits up.
---
When runescape started with SoF they all said they would never make it p2w. 
---
And then a few weeks later you could buy spins. And spins sometimes gave exp or money, even though it was so little amount that no one cared.
---
Although cosmetics would be preferred over other mtx, it still devalues other content that takes quests, and hours of gameplay to achieve.

MTX stands for micro transaction which means you pay for virtual goods with micro payments. This isn't a micro payment
---
I've never seen a reddit sub that doesn't have people like that. It's like the site culture is "treat every conversation as if it's a debate".
---
Superb editing skills 👏
---
It's all over for them now. Once you're in there's no going back.

Speaking strictly on the cosmetics being polled and not the principle and ramifications of it all. I love more teleport animations, I hate funky player skin colors.

Does watching this video technically count as streaming Likey?
---
&gt; But a game like RS3 is much more complex than OSRS, so it seems reasonable that they would need more developers to maintain and develop the game.
---
Yes, and RS3 is extremely inefficient from a business perspective. It essentially means the cost to update it and keep it running are higher than for OSRS, while also contributing much less to Jagex's revenue.
---
&gt; The ratio of developers is kind of absurd when you look at it but it doesn’t make sense for OSRS to have more developers, unless you want them to start completely reworking the entire game, which the OSRS player base doesn’t seem to want.
---
It would prevent rushed update and subpar testing. It would statistically increase the quality of every subsequent update and allow current mods to work on pet projects more often. It would also potentially free up enough resources to get a togglable HD redesign. Scrapped projects like the Fossil Island boss that was supposed to use up Rare fossils wouldn't necessarily be scrapped.

You can literally pay real life money to unlock characters? that's pay2win af.

But there is for certain items that they haven't released the drop rates of

The wiki has rates for monsters before their released by drawing from thousands of players drop logs on runelite.
---
Don’t fall for the phishing youtube scams at the grand exchange
---
I have a question about all of this. Will these partnerships result in more devs to specifically handle this content, or is this taking away from time that could be spent on other things, and just making the game more profitable for you?
---
If the end result is that other things still don't get done so the cosmetics can, but you guys just spent less cause dev salaries are offset, then it's still a negative for us.
---
why did he turn off his prayer too? I'm barely 50 slayer so forgive me if that's obvious.
---
If I fall for a Runescape scam at the age of 26 I probably deserve it.
---
Cosmetic locked. Pay money. Cosmetic unlocked. Mtx. Can't make it any clearer lol.
---
The partnerships are a business thing outside of the game though to help bring in more players, ya? Didn't they agree to only poll In game changes such as the cosmetics they brought up?
---
There are already too many devs on osrs.
---
Okay 😂
---
So how did they justify the recent TT expansion?
---
Oh man OP is a genius if this was all a ploy to get more streams for Twice. Should’ve used Fancy though
---
Lot of the loot is already used or combined with loot from other bosses in the bank. I did track some extra stuff:

---
Got 155k granite cballs and 161k normal cballs banked, but not sure how many came from corp (most of them though), and how many I used.
---
noob here. What's he supposed to be wearing?
---
I agree with you other than we're any better than 12 year old fortnite players.  Looking better than the next person is exactly what it's about for a lot of population, that's why you grind out the levels and the minigames and the quests.  To show it off and have pride in, and respect the dedication of others who've put themselves through something similar.  Look at RS3. 90 percent of their efforts are selling cosmetic MTX, because it worked for a long time.  We're degrading and undervaluing a critical foundation of OSRS if we allow this.  We were created because we had enough of it. I don't think we'll get another second chance at doing this game right.
---
But MTX is just an abreviation of micro-transactions. They mean the same thing, which is an exchange of virtual goods for small amount of real-life currency.
---
Jagex infamously makes bad decisions, with the RS3 player base declining there’s only one place to go when it does inevitably die. They will make OSRS their new cash cow and suck it dry just like they did with RS3.

It’s an old one but it’s more or less the same, red blocks being MTX promotions. Buckle up.

While you're absolutely not wrong, that's going to be true for literally any entertainment industry anywhere in the world. I mean just look at the whole Hollywood #MeToo movement. Or in sports you have coaches enabling drug use and allowing players to skirt around educational requirements setting them up for failure after their career is over when most will never go pro.
---
Kpop has a ton of problems beneath the surface, *especially* at smaller companies, but I think finding any moral entertainment industry probably wouldn't be an easy task.
---
Considering the decisions made by the executives team that had less to do with introducing new content (Wildy removal, trade restrictions, MTX, EoC) and more to do with changing the game itself and its business model, I don't think so.
---
When you look at individual pieces of content, such as quests, lore, arts, etc., you'll find that many players who tried both games admit that the RS3 team is way ahead of the Old School team on that front.
---
&gt;Are you safespotting Callisto? Probably won't work if he isn't engaging in combat with you
---
I am safespotting, yes. So it acts in a defensive way like recoil?
---
Look.. I love osrs and I'm not trying to put bias. I want it to succeed for a long time.
---
But the only reason oldschool came out on top was because of Chambers of Xeric at first and then mobile release.
---
Mobile release is the ONLY reason the active player counter jumped to 90,000.
---
But ever since its been consistently going down from there if you check the graphs. And rs3 doesn't have a mobile version yet. So how can you say clearly? I mean yeah its clear that the numbers are way higher now. But it took 3 years for the game to become more popular. Only raids 1 made it more popular.
---
Yes priff will keep the numbers high, and I could see raids 3 keeping it going for a while....But what after that? Twisted bow is already basically as power creep as any weapon in rs3. Theyre getting to the end of development. Why would they need a big team ? What else can they add after priff and a raids 3 area? 
---
IMO they really don't need a big dev team. May as well preserve the game before breaking it.
---
Third age is useless junk worth nothing? What are they teaching you out in the wildy?
---
This production value is insane.
---
Seems like it. Right from the wiki:
---
&gt; The chance for the ability to occur happens whenever an enemy attacks the player adjacently. The enemy must still have over half of its hitpoints and its skills must be at the base levels for them to be affected.
---
Dragon defender took me 12+ hours, good luck bud :)
---
sounds like a big xp loss to me
---
I just have a problem with getting 100 different cosmetics from one npc, the code doesn't make much of a difference.
---
Third age makes up less than 1% of the cosmetics, the majority is absolutely useless crap. Couldn't care less if a miniscule amount is useful
---
I have a workstation motherboard (ASUS KCMA-D8) with two Opteron 4386 CPUs; fantastic at multi-threading, but terrible single-threaded performance (which OSRS primarily benefits from); probably also not helped by playing at 4K.
---
With OSRS mobile and Android-x86 on this computer, along with the GPU plugin and Runelite, I average 60 FPS no problem at 4K; GPU rendering would benefit me nicely... if it existed on the official desktop client.

You just contradicted yourself. If people didn’t use the alter pkers wouldn’t camp there. Therefore if you’re saying it’s heavily camped it means people are using it. I think you undervalue the amount of bones saved by chaos alter. I personally know a lot of people that have used chaos alter to get rigour/augery prayer levels

---
That 5k RC exp reward was enough of a draw for me :)
---
&gt; Mobile release is the ONLY reason the active player counter jumped to 90,000.
---
Yes, from a 65k average. Without mobile, the ratio of OSRS vs. RS3 active players would still be 3 to 1, instead of 4.5 to 1.
---
&gt; But ever since its been consistently going down from there if you check the graphs. And rs3 doesn't have a mobile version yet. So how can you say clearly? I mean yeah its clear that the numbers are way higher now. But it took 3 years for the game to become more popular. Only raids 1 made it more popular.
---
Daily/weekly variations happen, true, but you can't deny that the trend is *overwhelmingly* in favor of OSRS. It doesn't even compare. 10-20% difference can be dismissed, but when we're talking about orders of magnitude like consistently having 3 or 4x as many players, it can't.
---
omg this is amazing

I'll post what I posted on twitter as I feel it is relevant. 
---
The question I always had about this which I could not answer with a good conscience was "what benefit does adding them as a reward from a partnership give to the community which isn't gained by just giving them to players?".
---
I cannot see a benefit to the community and I'd prefer to see content like this added through the usual methods that need adding. Finding rewards for content has always been an issue and here we have a handful of rewards which can be used in a better way for the community.

Fk im working on a mage/range only ironman and firecape is my best in slot for range cuz I can't get avas, least my firecaves will be easier with range but I can't even get avas.
---
Make sure you're speccing on stab, otherwise the damage gets halved. The max hit of each hitsplash is significantly higher than zammy spear, and like you said the cooldown is less than twice as long than spear. Saves about 1 second during the kill, but is best used at 50- hp because you'd have a big chance at KO-ing corp, and the weapon cooldown won't matter. That's when I use my c hally spec :)
---
I agree with you but the game is already pay to win and you can already obtain any tradable items by exchange of money outside of the game. RWT is a-ok as long as the money is lining Jagex’s pockets.
---
Just let them give a few dumb cosmetics to get people to play the game and not let it die. People need to chill a bit
---
In the middle of cooking 3.1k lobsters, I was actually thinking about posting something like this...but, like that lobster's girlfriend, it's already been done by other people.
---
The appeal of OSRS has never been its graphics. HD would likely attract some players, but so would other updates. It isn't "develop HD or don't" it is "develop HD or develop other updates" and those other updates are what they've decided is more worthwhile for the moment. For example, at the moment instead of HD they are working on a Player ID system to allow for Clans, Group Ironman, and such. Perhaps that won't bring in more players, but it also doesn't have nearly the same costs and it is far more requested of features by the existing player base.
---
That is not to say it will never happen, but the costs are huge compared to other options so even if they can afford it, it would cut more into profits than other choices. Also, one big reason I didn't go into with engine is that they cannot simply toggle it. It is current graphics or HD; the game cannot support both because of how it renders it. So finding a workaround to allow for both would make it even harder than the original 2008 HD update, which was a massive job out of the scope of the OSRS Team even if they expanded. And if you're choice is "hire 6 more artists and spent a year on engine and art working on HD" or "hire devs, qa, and artists to deliver more content updates while engine works on requested features" you can see why the former is hard to justify.

---
They are going to make the money one way or another, this seems like a sort of peace offering as opposed to the pay2win rs3 option.
---
That's a hell of an assumption. I'm sure they only need a small percentage to stay anyway for your precious game to not die. Just chill
---
You’re an incel serene help urself
---
Unless you are fine feeling extremely behind others, an Ironman whilst being to afk 1 hour a day is a bad idea. If you are fine being stuck early game for a long time then go for it
---
Yeah but 3rd age is far from being the only cosmetics in clue scrolls worth anything. Also similar to my complaint about diango, clue scrolls have too many cosmetics coming from one place.
---
animation smoothing plugin on runelite. Personally I'm not a big fan of it
---
I and many others vehemently opposed bonds when they were being polled. Jagex Trojan Horsed them into the game by holding F2P hostage with bonds. Bonds and F2P were polled together.
---
Fastest and most costly xp in the game is trees.  I get 54k every daily run (takes 5 minutes if I don't have to stop to do something) planting 4 yew trees and 4 papaya trees.  Herb runs are a great supplemental income for your account.

Grande se verdadeiro
---
As someone who just came back after a decade, I can't see anyone else playing except for nostalgia. The graphics are horrendous compared to modern games. I'm sad they didn't carry over the HD update, but unfortunately graphics make up a large portion of most people's gaming experience. Apparently the mobile version is seeing a lot of success, where you can get away with lower-quality graphics, but it'll be interesting to see how many people stay for the long haul.
---
You replied to a bot, saying "Good bot", so now you're being banned from RuneScape for supporting bots. Enjoy your ban, noob!
---
nba memes bleed all over reddit
---
&gt; The goal of these promotions is to attract new players, you aren't expected to buy or subscribe to whatever product/service is partnering with them if you're already playing. Hence why Jagex said the cosmetics would be available to all players after the promotion is over. Use your brain.
---
yes, but that does not make them not microtransactions.
---
I like the battleaxes too. Shame there are many cooler weapons than a scim but you get shit on if you don’t use one.
---
There are a few items worth something with like 90% being worth &lt;30k, never used and pointless. The ones that actually have a value usually aren't cosmetics in some way and have a use, e.g. gilded for f2p risk fights
---
Do forgettable tale and garden of tranquility to get those early levels.
---
you forget one simple thing.. some one still needs to buy the bond for real cash.
---
A big red flag in my opinion is that its getting forced in. Sure we can vote on the cosmetics that come with these partnerships but not on partnerships themselves, they're coming if you like it or not.
---
Bonds were introduced to help battle gold farmers.
---
The quality is impeccable, I’m honestly blown away. All the little genie lamps too, so fucking good.
---
Engine work means more mods. They just get tasked with the engine.
---
Ash said on twitter that if none of the rewards pass, the partnerships deal won't happen unless they offer cheap membership again etc.
---
&gt; Membership has one-time fees as well. 
---
Incorrect, every package they have auto-renews *besides bonds*. 
---
They have packages that make buying more than one months subscription at a time cheaper, but regardless of the amount of time you buy it's always on a subscription basis unless you manually cancel your subscription.
---
wow u really took that one personally, I apologize for hurting your ego so badly.
---
lmfao thats great
---
That was amazing.
---
&gt; achieving a core team of only 17 devs after six years of stellar growth is much too slow.
---
Is it? What data do you have that Jagex doesn't which would support that claim?
---
&gt;First, I'd want to have a team dedicated to implementing an optional HD version of the game. It's a better solution than just allowing third-parties to implement it in unofficial clients
---
Would the amount of players that the optional HD version brings in outweigh the costs of having to maintain it, or is it just something that you want?
---
&gt;My point serves as a reminder that, from a business standpoint, Old School Runescape is now the bigger game
---
It's a more popular and profitable game, but like you said, more work is put into RS3, which from the business standpoint makes it the bigger project.
---
&gt;Therefore, it doesn't make sense to pour so many resources into something that, by all metrics, is dying, especially when its main 'competitor' is flourishing.
---
If it's flourishing with only 17 devs, do you need more? Maybe adding too many devs would cause too many disagreements/communication problems/misunderstandings?
---
OSRS is their current cash cow.
---
You can make it swampletics themed if you WAIT until it becomes obtainable to EVERYONE regardless if you PAID OR NOT. Do you not have patience? It clearly specified that ALL cosmetics offered in partnerships will be available to all members at a later date. If the cosmetics were exclusive to the partnership then I’d agree with you, but they aren’t.

Where did you get these drop logs? Runelite? I see these posts a lot but haven’t been able to figure it out. Gz though! I got my dragon defender on first kill last night so hopefully I haven’t used up my RNG for money drops later 😂
---
So Jagex is going all "American Politics" for the situation, eh? Keep pushing until it gets through, like the penis of a priest against his son.
---
Lazypole like cabbage
---
Get out of here clown. Everyone know the only “customer support” Jagex has are Reddit posts with 1k+ upvotes or twitter replies.
---
I'm okay with PoH themes, but I feel like teleport animations people can use anywhere without a requirement is too far.
---
Aside from christmas event, nobody uses other event cosmetics (exception being wintertodt). Hell, from my experience people only use those items if they don't have something in that slot.
---
I personally prefer the things I find enjoyable to remain as enjoyable as I found them, or even more preferably, to be even more enjoyable in the future.
---
The fact that you consider being attacked in the wilderness means you're being "griefed" makes you an idiot and a piece of shit.
---
It's the wilderness. If you can't handle being attacked stay tf out. That's how that area works. If you don't like the way it works stay the fuck out. There is no point in ruining that part of the game because you personally don't like it. It's selfish and shitty.
---
I want that third age. I feel like mediums are more profitable because they’re obtained and completed quicker and they got the boots
---
When I went back onto RS3, it took me almost an hour to figure out how to hide the cosmetics I got a while ago so I could see my 15 year cape. Game could easily be renamed from "RS3" to "Clutter Simulator 2019".
---
I had to scroll pretty far for this, thanks for summing it up
---
Your caps are stupid and you're ignoring my point. Im not waiting for cosmetics, Low impact cosmetics/mtx are still mtx. No to MTX.
---
Your argument is that it's easy to immigrate and now you're moving the goal posts lol

It's hard, end of story.

To add, the difficulty in creating and editing a video like this at such a seamless high quality, in a game which is closing in on 20 years old, is absolutely insane. 
---
The talent required to make a video of this caliber using old school runescape assets and creating animations from scratch that feel true to the game is honestly mind-blowing - so much so that this sub is in utter awe, drawing comments from developers and creators of the game alike. 
---
Hence 28k upvotes and r/all status
---
what do you want them to be more transparent with? the wording? because, as ive said several times in this thread, literally every poll comes with text explaining the questions and contextualising them beforehand. id be fine with rewording the questions so that people can stop complaining about what, to me at least, is a nonissue. but genuinely, what else do you want to be transparent with? the things you mentioned arent really viable- how itll be sold (which presumably is with several companies that arent set in stone so they cant really talk about or with companies they havent spoken to so they wont talk about), how itll be available in game afterwards (theyve talked about how theyre up for implenting it through drops, quests etc. but this is undecided, presumably to be polled in the future), and the way its implemented in polls (again, bright orange text) are all not things they can really be more transparent about.
---
as i said to someone else earlier, trusting noone about anything makes you just as dumb about trusting everyone about everything. skepticism is one thing, calling it "fucking disgusting" is jumping to conclusions
---
I had that happen once a long time ago
---
nah b rich kids 4 life
---
I can't be outraged about time-limited cosmetics ruining the game when you can literally already P2W and buy as much GP as you want.
---
If this is a slippery slope, then it has to be something further down the slope than "Buy GP with real money".
---
Nice, I see Mod Ash has a 99 in Slayer.
---
I'd really like to see Desert Treasure II. I like seeing iconic and classic quests get sequels and this seems like a fitting way to open door for the Mahjarrat/Zaros.

Im in south korea, and the best worlds have around 150+ ping. I can literally do everything listed there no problem. Asia should get a couple of servers too tho. I support

Its not really a semantic if it entirely changes the meaning of the statement though?...
---
A cash cow product is called a cash cow because the usual path of action is to "milk it dry" (hence the "cow" as a fictionary image), whilst the path of action of a star product is to leave it as it is, because it is performing well both in market share and market growth.
---
This is a copy of my comment on the proposal of making the rewards proposed in the blog available as rewards for in game activities: Yes they should do that instead. In the blog they say they're doing this to bring in new players. IMO a much better idea would be to give a few days of free membership. That would hook 'em! Additionally, I think that if I was a new player who had the choice between a useless cosmetic that everyone has access to, or a week/few days of membership I would be much more willing to support both Jagex and their partners in the way they are hoping for.
---
That’s when the word “average” comes into play tho. He said 3 minute average.
---
Glad we can agree on this, because that's exactly why I vote no on pvp related content. I vote no so that non pvp'ers don't get forced even more into going in the wilderness against their will with updates that to no avail try to bring back a community that has long moved on to other toxic games like Rust. 
---
In my opinion, the community has changed/matured. The golden times of pk'ing existed when people didn't care about efficiency and maxing. It was alive with little content like wilderness bosses, Mage arena II, wilderness slayer etc. What you see now is the polarisation of both communities and it's turning against the minority and I understand your frustration about that. But calling people idiots, pieces of shit, selfish and shitty because they don't like to get pk'ed as they try to enjoy the game, minding their own business, is not going to solve this problem. Sadly, this type of behaviour is characteristic for the pk'ing community and reinforces the experience of being griefed. Nonetheless, I wish you goodluck in your future pk'ing endeavors and hope you understand the other perspective.
---
I have really high magic and rune crafting so I would bet that is what they used it for.
---
you shouldnt have botted, unfortunate
---
No specific release date?
---
Idk, community wanted it fixed, Jagex fixed it now the community is crying about it again. Can never be happy
---
But I'm not moving the goalposts. I'm asking you to explain yourself and your reasoning and compare it to other countries, which you are refusing to do. It seems like you know that you're wrong but won't admit it.
---
Let's say you got 30 Runecraft from quests alone which you didn't because that's not possible. That would mean you need 1466 Tears of Guthix to raise Runecraft from 30 to 50. Assuming you got an impressive 183 tears each time, that still requires 8 sessions at a minimum. Sit kid
---
When your meme has top tier production talent.  
---
Great job!
---
RS3 dead already, so the only logical thing to say is good luck to you all
---
Yes and that's beside the point.  It also had things like xp lamps, stacks of cash and godswords from day 1.  It was not "cosmetic only" like the slippery slope argument claims.  Idk why you're trying to argue this, you can go look at the original news post if you really don't believe me.  Then look 3 months later when they add the ability to straight up buy spins.  There was no slippery slope, no warming up the water while the frog got in the pot.  It was boldfaced P2W, and that's what Jagex is telling us will never come to OSRS.

APC stands for armored personnel carrier, tehnically it's not a tank because it doesn't have a gun
---
I’m ootl. Was he grinding off stream and editing it all together or what?

Where can i see the collection log?

I third this. TBH

We'll take the box.
---
Oh, hey bud. :)
---
Yeah you can just re-read it too. As many times as ye like! :)
---
I was thinking about this when I was driving to work this morning, it's almost hilarious to see how quickly they are bringing a minor form of MTX to the game right after the main guy against them left.
---
Splashing is gay
---
not to mention it's rather impossible to spin vertical without the shoulders and neck getting in the way...
---
Finally, some good fucking food
---
This is all a big joke.
---
I dont think moving camera resets afk timer, you can test though
---
It was but failed
---
Brazilians are usually a high number of MMO players. I'm surprised OSRS doesn't have Brazilian worlds already +1.
---
Well, they are only polling the possible *in-game cosmetic rewards from sponsorships* (which will be exclusive temporarily, and later be available to all members - **but without information about how long this "temporary" period it, or prices, or how blatant / extreme the possible cosmetic rewards will be**)
---
So... yes, it seems that cosmetic MTX itself is not polled - it is simply stated they will have partnerships (definite), that there will be in-game cosmetic paired with these potential partnerships (definite), but that the exact cosmetic additions will be polled.
---
you’re breathtaking!
---
holding a key down does not keep  you active
---
I would also like to be able to report for luring, phishing links and begging. Oh boy if begging was against the rules that'd be great.
---
Personally liked it better than the ratcatchers part. Tho its still aids.
---
They changed their name to "Ac Swap" and I'm pretty sure it's just one guy using multiple accounts (notice how he posts fake messages in the CC at the same timestamps from 3 ranked accounts in the CC):

Hell yea. Can it still squash cars tho?
---
Never use vpn's or proxies for tutorial island, they will 99% get locked straight away.  You can use it afterwards
---
Lol ok thanks
---
I'm sure he wouldn't respond to so many tweets if he didn't enjoy doing it at least a little bit.
---
Thanks for your input, always interesting to hear someone with first hand knowledge. I couldn't find any video of the official stream, and the vod is obviously long gone, so I had to write this off memory. I guess this is one of the cases which can be viewed differently. Btw I found this from the official newspost about the events. 
---
*The red island was warned repeatedly, and we reached out many, many times to them. Whilst we did appropriately warn players that failure to fight would result in disqualification, it ultimately did mean that we had to make a tough decision ‘in the moment’. In hindsight perhaps we could’ve opted to take a random member of the team through to the final area, but we stand by the decision we made.*
---
They said by late July.
---
What game do you think is worse?? OSRS has low-poly models with low-res textures, jagged lines everywhere, a myriad of z-buffering issues, etc.
---
post is a joke, swamp man is still legit
---
Its already changed back. Apparently, the green pixel was never intended, but caused by the way their files are saved. Due to saving it in a different manner as of the past update, the green pixel bug was gone - so now they had to manually adjust it in the system to bring it back.
---
Which actually means the green pixel is now **official**, and no longer a bug!
---
Use this
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragonbone_necklace
---
the player uses an account that is locked to one area of the game, in this case it is the swamp area.
---
Alright, and... I don’t know what to make of that. Is there much more to it?
---
so this basically is proof that swampletics fakes all of his vid???
---
support
---
Honestly I'm still disgusted by the fact that a) Ash felt forced to offer Woox a large amount of his personal money and b) that Woox accepted it.
---
Source?
---
??? Voting no to PvP content because you think being attack in the wildy is griefing isn't even close to "catering the game to 5% of the player base."
---
You're just an idiot that shouldn't be in the wilderness and unfortunately is able to vote on polls that you know nothing about.
---
At least you can accept fault and not make a post complaining like half the kids on the subreddit
---
May as well be July 2020 lol. I've been waiting on this since they announced the reqs several months ago.
---
How’s all that 24/7 pussy you’re drowning in dude

Oh for sure. If you can’t learn from your mistakes why are you living?

187 upvotes? Get in line son

\*definitely, not defiantly

there is a elite diary that requires 85 prayer
---
Idk why you’re downvoted you’re correct lol
---
Wtf how is this so high quality. Top tier content, have an upvote
---
My account was recently hacked as well, someone got it banned botting green dragons. They didn’t take any of my stuff and they actually wound up getting banned before they transferred the last batch of stuff from the green dragons so I wound up going from ~500k to 1.3mil! Hopefully that happens for you too, it sucks you got hacked
---
Rs3 is dying content. It's going to take a miracle to bring it back.
---
ahh TIL
---
For future reference always have the credit/copyright in the corner and smaller.
---
Here’s the idea that’ll fix the problem: Low lvl pking incentives.
---
Didn’t even notice for a kill or two. Guess I can start bursting these tasks now. First pet btw.
---
the only thing we know about it is late july
---
I also need to know the release date cuz im doing a [drop party in prif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C7ag45Bo7Y) during the first week
---
This is about to overtake Lynx Titan as the top /r/2007scape post of ALL TIME.
---
Holy shit.
---
I aim to please

“They’re surprise mechanics, not loot boxes!”
---
Exactly ? If you don’t spam click you wouldn’t equip the bolts
---
99 agility as the first 99? Thats impressive
---
lol
---
Good. Graceful has become a curse.
---
Things that helped me were tanning cowhides and selling the leather. Farm 27 cowhides and have a stack of GP(for the gate to al k, and tanning the hides). Then go to the tannery and tan all 27, put them in the bank and then run back to cows by limb ridge. Since and repeat and you can get decent money.
---
After that I tried collecting bananas. You might have to look up a guide but use baskets and you can net some pretty good profit for little to no time. It got me enough for starter gear until I could really get into it.
---
OSRS needs a better engine, new engine = 99% of updates not possible due to shit engine
---
Sure, most games start their mtx as a "bonus" feature, that's completely "harmless". Then they start turning the knob and it's boil the frog approach. 
---
I member playing cod when they first introduced lootboxes in them. They claimed they had "no plan to monetize them"... and then they said "at this time"... right.... It's been the same pattern for every other game.
---
The guy with the steel warhammer is clearly a Chad. He won't waste his time with Virgin efficient weapons.
---
Aren't like 50% of the clue steps locked behind quests to begin with
---
Support!! I needed feathers for a quest and i was walking near port sarim. Killed a seagull for feathers and needless to say i was very disappointed
---
If you are using runelite you can use the default world plugin. Otherwise i think the client uses the last world you were in.
---
This isn't just "the smallest shit". MTX was the main reason many people left the previous iteration of the game, it's very central to a large portion of the OSRS community's reason for playing Old School. Anything that risks and threatens bringing MTX to OSRS is going to undermine the reason a lot of these players left RS3 in the first place.
---
Ughh.. that would make the wilderness altar even worse than it already is.. no thanks..
---
It's pretty fucking disappointing how many people are accepting of MTX 2.0 being added to the game.
---
You will all be the death of this game, again. Jagex has never kept promises to stop MTX. This is just the first step in that direction.
---
The construction icon pixel fix goes to show that Jagex is no longer honouring the promise of keeping the game polled.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Would that sell all my stuff and change my password?
---
I made a typo in the title. It should say runelite plugins.
---
He's ironman.
---
What's MTX?
---
Absolutely amazing lmao nice dude
---
50 years ago maybe
---
Bran stark looking motherfucker
---
Jesus Christ that's awful.
---
Nice account!
---
To bot, or to not?
---
I do t think there’s a world one on mobile 😕
---
You can’t justify intentionally mislead someone. You don’t need deep context like you’re saying. We’re voting on MTX and yet MTX is nowhere mentioned. They know that if they were 100% transparent about this and included the words “micro transaction,” it would be nayed to hell.
---
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
---
Is there any chance a South American server can be explored as an option?  A few Brazilian folks posted a petition about it today, wanted to increase the chance you guys see this concern.
---
You cant revober it because your IPs dont match up. Thats the power of vpn for ya.
---
I’m saying they have your info and bank pin though the possible false client and then hijack your account yes
---
unfortunately true
---
If a HCIM dies like that they definitely deserve it. If you can't take the 5 seconds it takes to pull up the wiki page to make sure an enemy isn't going to randomly yeet you then you're just waiting for it to happen. Had a HCIM in our CC die in catas because he couldn't be bothered to check if high level superiors are any different and had an unfortunate run-in with a marble gargoyle
---
good luck man, my hardcore was recently hacked, it took a week after my appeal to get unbanned.
---
New Pepsi© Overload
---
Its world 301
---
I don't think the real runelite has a zulrah helper, only runelite+ which apparently hacked a bunch of people had it
---
Thx
---
I was so excited when i got 85 slayer that i extended them. Bad idea.
---
On his old JMod Reddit account, no less.
---
Haha runecraft bad am i right fellow redditors
---
What’s the 27 bottles of shit you got?
---
No
---
Runecrafting bad
---
Agility worse 
---
SMOrc
---
Your so awesome thank you where r u btw
---
Yeah, I just think you misunderstood me. What I meant is that osrs' playerbase is mostly comprised of people who have actively run away from MTX, and as such, there are much fewer whales among us. Just look at how rare it is to see someone talking about buying bonds to get a tbow or something. So if MTX was implemented in osrs, the surge in profit would be much lower than normal, and likely followed a lot more quickly about the sudden drop in subscriptions, which is by far the most profitable part of Jagex right now. So no, I don't think introducing MTX is a smart move, even for the most bloodthirsty investors out there.
---
&gt;And the mods have been known to tel people what they want to hear.
---
Not this team, they haven't. We have never had a mod team with such a close relationship to the community. There has been some dramas and let downs, but they always seem to be honest and apologetic for their mistakes. They reverted a tiny 2x4 dock on draynor because some people whined, for god's sake, if that's not listening to feedback and being customer focused, I don't know what is.
---
Now, I don't think they deserve blind trust, because that goes against what our relationship is built on, but I think they deserve at least our belief that they aren't lying through their teeth on a dev blog. At the very least because, if they are, might as well quit now because there's nothing we can do to stop MTX from coming.
---
Its an old quote from 2013? Anyways that ceo is long gone and so is the credibility of that quote.
---
what a idiot!
---
in a nutshell they want more money out the player base and that caused things to spiral out of control last time. Every one knows the term "people dont really quit runescape". Yes they bloody well will if MTX is added in some gross way without putting there core player base first and foremost.
---
Damn bro that gotta be the worst quality pic I’ve seen on here lol gratz though
---
Same with hasta
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
Ty lol
---
I think it should be down to personal choice, ofc there are integrity issues especially when veering into the inferno at other top tier content, but ultimately they will exist with or without Jagex's consent. People just gotta pick if they want to learn stuff themselves and maybe have a bit more of a challenge by choosing not to use client/features, or they can stay shit at the game and have the client tell you where to click. Either or.
---
I used to log into those worlds to go into the wildy since the populations were generally lower. Just could read the I’m game text lol
---
How if the “new” players won’t even know what the items are
---
Yesterday
---
Not sure what the fuck you're talking about.
---
This was polled. The community specifically voted against fixing the green pixel.
---
Literally any app besides the official one has ad free reddit.
---
I'm honestly shocked at how quickly someone noticed it. I was expecting this to have been implemented several months ago and only noticed just now. Who is checking on the green pixel every update?
---
If those extra Devs salaries are paid for with MTX than I'd rather a smaller team.
---
whats up with the imbued heart you use it for magic defense?
---

Kwolf throw your hands in the air if you a true playa
---
What about RC Cola?
---
Why did you have to boost for that
---
The upside it having the game grow and get new members. What are you talking about?
---
They already have ads, but this is reaching an even greater audience. Using only of the ways of getting the game out there is just handicapping your own growth.
---
Please Jagex :(
---
I had pin and Authenticator and lost my account to hackers recently because didn’t have 2-factor on my email and after they got my password wrong enough times, Jagex sent a new password to my email in plain text form... like are you fucking kidding me. I hadn’t played for a few days and now my iron man bank is cleaned. I’m done playing the game now, so I have more free time at least lol.
---
He is
---
im tired of these posts progress though the game and you make money regardless get slayer to 75 and bet you have atleast 10m if not more
---
Yep, this has been happening to me for a while now. Happens with both OSBuddy and RuneLite and tends to happen randomly about once every hour or so of gameplay. I love the oh so helpful solutions of not using a mac... smh...
---
Makes it hard to use my wife's Mac to play my hardcore ironman using one of these clients... afraid he'll die to one of these freezes.
---
I just started using the official client and so far it hasn't crashed. But I've only been using it for a few hours of gampelay so far, so I guess we'll see if that's just a coincidence.
---
At Least agility is useful. Grinding out agility kind of sucks but at almost every level theirs a shortcut unlocked.
---
I don't think using an addon to learn mechanics makes you shit at the game. It just makes it faster to learn. Once you actually learn the mechanics you can just disable the addon and still do just as well. 
---
Like, honestly. That argument ignores the fact that every world first raid team in world of warcraft's history has used addons to progress. Does that make them shit?
---
Wow this is the most awards I have witnessed and its badass that its for an RS clip!
---
Amazing work
---
Varrock courtyard :) im TycheMoirai in game if youd like to add me
---
A lot of people are smart enough to not use the same email for other sites. My game email is strictly for the game, I don’t use it for anything else. I didn’t have auth or pin for years either until I paid for my fire capes but that’s a whole different story in itself. Anyway, I did get security afterwards but beforehand I had no worries that anyone would guess my email
---
True it's definitely more rewarding, but I'm talking about which skill is more tedious / annoying
---
&gt;In Vanilla WoW, there were addons that told you where to stand during raids
---
I think these are way too far tbh, it goes beyond eliminating frustration and tedium, just turns raids into skill-less messes.
---
&gt;Why is OSRS so defensive of objectively obfuscating and clunky mechanics?
---
It's easier to attain perfect play in a game where you're limited to a certain amount of actions every 0.6s than a real-time game where things are always happening. No one can play WoW perfectly because of mechanical skill requirements, RS is mostly about navigating the interface and game knowledge, things that clients can remove, allowing players to achieve perfect play fairly easily since mechanics don't really matter for most of RS outside of stuff like 1t flicking and tick manip skilling.
---
&gt;If Zulrah helper is not okay, why is the Zulrah helper website okay
---
Having to look off the client is harder to look at the form and positioning is much more difficult than the game highlighting exactly where to stand and when to switch for you.
---
&gt;why does Jagex not seek to take down websites that do the same thing as these addons
---
They don't do the same thing
---
&gt;You can accomplish the exact same result with the wiki and with websites and video guides that you can accomplish with these addons.
---
Definitely untrue, anyone who's ever seen a new player do Zulrah can attest to this. Even with guides and videos, they'll still misremember or misread things and stand in the wrong place or do switches at the wrong times.
---
I just realised this is the guy who made the Pokemon RuneScape battle. Talented person
---
Sure go ahead open a layout for zulrah rotations etc on a side window eventually you learn it because you die to many times splitting your attention or your eating more than you have to for the same reason. Having it as an overlay removes any learning from it and at this point you aren't really learning idc. At that point the zulrah guide website is just like any strategy guide for any other game or a guest guide. But the moment it overlays the actual game it becomes an issue
---
Is it just me or is everybody on this sub a dumbass that doesn't know how to take screenshots?
---
Exactly, my email is strictly for the game. So I never had to worry about anyone guessing it, not until I paid for my firecapes did I finally get Authenticator and pins.
---
