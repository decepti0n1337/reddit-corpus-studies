Healthy and active are not the same thing.

Even then, I don't really mind it as much as it's like 4x faster than runecrafting/agility.

This is great

While true, not what we were talking about

People with higher total level and time played will vote no on early and mid game content because it isn't content that they will likely do. Having some peoples votes count more is a genuinely bad idea for way more reasons than just that one I gave though, and you should feel stupid for suggesting it.
---
I do think a quest point requirement is a decent idea though, as another anon suggested. 
---
Same boat! Didn't even reach lvl 120 before the realization. Mobile OSRS couldn't have come at a better time.
---
Por que no los dos
---
Thanks fam &lt;3 I'll be doing hard clues at some point :D 
---
depends, I've looked early enough and seen those kinds of percentages, but only like ten votes. 8/10=80%, but a no vote would be 8/11, 72%, actually failing.
---
poll results AND number voted should be hidden though 
---
because iron man is increasing the supply while having no effect on the demand.  To many iron man accounts and it would cause items to crash faster then necessary.  You either have no access or all access can not be limited.
---
It's a meme don't be so critical

Nice

Also got full graceful today!!

Damn that's a lot less than I expected.

1. Should Jagex implement an authenticator removal delay?
---
2. Should Jagex hire people to actually give player support?
---
Oh yeah these weren’t polled they’re just super f’ing obvious

Divine just failed because it was previewed to be op pre eoc.

Thank you for listening to the suggestion of moving Redbeard Frank. I think Rimmington will be far less altered as an iconic location. I also think it gives Rimmington added value as a F2P town, which is awesome. Potentially sounds like a really good idea, would love some concept pictures though.

Summoning was great, but there was a lot of really overpowered shit that wouldn't fit in osrs. It was also released in January of 2008, so it really only just missed being in osrs. 
---
Yeah I hate when my inv gets messed up with 3 way switches
---
You make a loss enchanting rings of forging.

Bro for real, hit that glory to draynor and boom back at the crabs.

I really hope so. It's the most OP shit in the game.

its not even the slowest skill lol

There are hundreds of thousands of players. A certain percentage of them will always be susceptible to lurers, and we shouldn't be making it easier for those lurers to scam them. 
---
Your suggestions are pearls thrown before swine. This is the same dev team that took 6 months to figure out that afk splashing for 6 hours wasn't a legit skilling method. I could name more than a few more such demos of their ineptitude but I don't think I need to.

Check if any of your cc members can spare you some coins to buy a bond, then sell the fury ammys and return the coins to them?

Sorry, cant help myself lol
---
Yea totally. Master loot had its pros and cons, and I’ve definitely been kind of fucked over from ML but that’s how it goes. The great thing about ML was that loot was obviously going to the person that needed it. Not necessarily the 1 time alt that gets the BiS TF 395 hammer from Taloc in one week. Vs 3 months of raiding and not getting it.

Just do slayer normally, why camp?

Man, after seeing late Legion I thought holy shit Blizzard have fixed the formula and made the grinding at least enjoyable and the rewards worth it (I mean who even cared if the artifact weapon was a straight line, it was cool as hell), just for BFA to make all of Legions mistakes they fixed and more and basing so much of the game around world quests. While forcing players to engage in content like island expeditions instead of rewarding AP from all activities. 
---
My question is why invest in herblore? The skill is basically useless since only 1 potion in the game is profitable to make
---
I’d go with either b ring (i) for specs or a dragon crossbow so you can 1 tick the gmaul.
---
The issue is at its base, when you filter the spell book especially on ancients, there is so much empty wasted space and it spaces the spells so far apart that it makes you more likely to missclick on them. UI Upscaling may be a nice thing to have added to the game but its not the solution to the spells not being a decent size in the filtered spellbook.
---

&gt;That would defeat the purpose of bonds.

&gt;What exactly is that purpose then?

It should never have been polled in the first. For the integrity of the polls, Jagex should have hidden. all polls until the voting was over from the start.
---
When it's a large amount of people close together, it tends to make rooms hotter.
---
Dude, we play OSRS because we tried RS3 and hated it.
---
The fact that we're OSRS players entails a pretty obvious and implicit answer to your question.
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** knib0o0! ^(hug)
---
Old death mechanics are garbage unless you are talking about the grave stones lol. They should just add rs3 death mechanics. It will be a good sink, and you won't loose 100m when you DC. 
---
Neither of those 2 previous votes results can be trusted because the results weren't hidden until the end.

Thanks for the response. I'm asking for the sake of pvp. I wouldn't mind losing a warrior ring but losing a berserker ring or treasonous ring would make me a bit sad :) so your answer is what I'm hoping is correct.
---
Also, I never really find myself wishing my dds hit a bit higher... At least not nearly as often as I find myself wishing it hit at all, so I wanted to try increasing its accuracy.
---
You don't have any evidence that those who did not like it are a minority.
---
This is just an attempted appeal to popularity without any evidence that those who didn't care are even a majority. 
---
Why drop it though?
---
Thanks Cave Johnson 
---
I knew that until recently. Back in the day (‘04-‘06), my naive 10-year-old self just thought they were a way to make skilling more interesting/rewarding
---
No they're not. PvP worlds are PvP everywhere. If you mean that it's a world where players PK in the wildy, then you're correct. But it's not a PvP world. I've been on the world many many times.
---
Please, I'll fuckin spam this thread till I have an answer. What is this app?
---
D
---
That's actually an efficient way of doing it cause trading the ore is faster than dropping it all. So you can trade to a noob who will make like 30-40k/hour on it for 0 stat requirements, and you get to go back to mining more quickly.
---
they ruined druids in BFA (again) and i quit after clearing uldir mythic once (took fucking forever to get a group) then made a 10hp ironman obby mauler. play it on/off alongside my main. I love OSRS because I always know what I'm getting myself into... guaranteed satisfaction every time.
---
Grats on full graceful!
---
By adding Veos to the suggested location there would be 3 relatively fast ways to get to Kourend for those who don't have any means to get there.
---
1. Minigame teleports -&gt; Pest Control -&gt; Port Sarim -&gt; Veos
---
2. Fairy Ring "A I Q" -&gt; Veos
---
3. House/Rimmington teleport -&gt; Veos
---
I miss him
---
i guess you’re iron? you can unlimited cheese from a teak larder in your poh. 
---
Im against the dock but I honestly thought that jagex wouldn't and shouldn't have changed it. It's cool to not like Jagex always listening to a few reddit posts which represent a small portion of the playerbase.
---
I equate no earmuffs at banshees to my girlfriend telling me about her day

Please continue to give us updates.  Glad you’re having fun and welcome!

Book of Darkness really isn't necessary for Barrows.
---
Just get an obby shield or blessed spirit shield.
---
Or - and hear me out - they realized the port addition was inconsistent with the way previous aesthetic content was added (i.e., polled).
---
An example of strictly aesthetic questions which have been polled in the last year or so:
---
* Should the slayer helm (i) be a slightly different color than unimbued
---
* Should the entrance to the grotesque guardians be changed to be more fitting with the environment
---
* Should the spikes on the dragon full helm be recolored
---
* Should the dfs change color when uncharged
---
Regardless of if you feel these questions should have been polled to begin with, they were. 
---
set goals 
---
but really, questing will really set up your account in a good direction. aim for quest cape and medium diaries and you will be on your way to a nice account 
---
this
---
Or add range and mage masks and require them to imbue the slayer helm.
---
Basically the veins last longer. It's based on a timer rather than a % chance for every ore mined. This also means multiple people can mine the same rock at the same time with less drawbacks, so crowding isn't so bad.
---
Whenever you go to get a drink of water while wearing a long sleeved sweatshirt with that itchy cotton material on the inside and as you drink from the cup, a single drop of water streams down your arm and gets the inside of your sleeve wet, causing a extremely annoying, but minor, itchy feeling on your arm where the sleeve is wet on the inside but not the outside.
---
And 75 range should be fine? Or should I go for 80+?
---
I kept think there was going to be 2 Veos and 2 docks to Kourend when they added the new dock.
---
Supplies - One super extended antifire, one antivenom plus, one prayer potion, rune pouch with laws dusts and chaos runes, around 5 karamwans and the rest of your space manta rays.
---
As for gear, if you can't afford a bandos godsword you will never kill vorkath effectively if at all with your stats so it is a must. So for your inventory for speccing the bgs you should also include switches - void melee helm, berserker ring I, fire cape, dragon boots, bgs.
---
If you do not have good just use your best available gear but good plus the salve amulet ei is best in slot. You should pre pot range, defence, strength and attack before your trip to save inv space. I would aim for a minimum bgs spec of 50 to 60 with your stats but preferably higher. If you don't hit that just telly out and try again.
---
Set your quick prayers to protect mage and eagle eye. When you bus spec you should activate piety if you have it or ultimate strength if not.
---
If you have any more questions feel free to ask and I'll answer when I can.
---
Could it help? Yes.
---
Will it? The chance is so fucking low. Honestly.
---
You can. 
---
* absorb to 1k with decent armour
---
* auto retaliate on
---
* come back in 20 mins to reabsorb to 1k
---
What is your hp and defense right now? 70 prayer is more than enough.
---
I personally used rune darts for the whole thing, but addy darts would be fine, and you could bring some rune or dragon darts for Jad if you wanted.
---
I thought the same as a kid too lol. I thought that if you killed them, they had a secret drop table that would give you Skilling resources but was always upset when they dropped nothing. Not to mention I can't even count how many times I was killed by the fishing troll at catherby fish spot. I miss when everyone used to fish there.
---
This is one dopa-meme
---
&gt; Similarly pvpers aren't actually there to pvm. So the end result is the pvm content is a bait for new pvmers who don't know what they are doing
---
Not true at all, gear correctly and you have the advantage over a brid, big clans aren't there to kill pvmers, they have bigger fish to fry like their reputation vs other clans that happen to be out at the time.
---
&gt; So the end result is the pvm content is a bait for new pvmers who don't know what they are doing
---
You could argue that wilderness content isn't for "new pvmers" just like inferno isn't for new pvpers but they're required to do it anyway if they want to compete, funny how nobody complains about that but just does it anyway even though it's infinitely harder than defending yourself while skilling in the wilderness.
---
&gt;It has nothing to do with the pvm. It's a pvmer bait to consequently attract pvpers. If you think otherwise you're dumb. You could put torvesta alone at revs in full pvm gear and he'd lose.
---
Multi is a totally different ball game and is meant for groups of players to contest and ultimately create fights for bigger teams, not for random pvmers to cheese and be safe all the time in welfare gear. 
---
Well, I don't have a skiller so...
---
Maybe look into getting items or outfits that improve your gameplay. Things like herb sack, seed box, bone crusher, graceful outfit, Rouge outfit, slayer ring can be obtained through skillimg, minigames, or diary completion.
---
Quest rewards like fairy rings, tree spirits, and the ectophial will vastly reduce the time spent to get to certain locations.
---
If making easy money interests you, look in to daily battle staff runs from the Varrock diary, herb runs, and bird house runs.
---
Who gets excited over a 1m chest anymore? I'm sick of these noobs posting their non-accomplishments.

how is gem mining compared to mlm, xp/afk wise? 
---
ive been 5 years now and only smelt a couple people in line that could for sure have used some deodorant 
---
If only there was a way to solicit opinions on additions to the game. Some kind of numerical scoring system where you could say how you felt about an addition the game? Then they'd know before content is added how people feel about it.
---
Ah well, a man can dream. 
---
oh yeah then why can you only get this cut in a third world country

Yea more than fine

I played demonology warlock in the first month of BFA and when I pugged my key the first week M+ was out to +10 and the tank I invited said I was trolling them in my own key for playing Demo, that was my BFA venture done.
---
Not really. The Dock wasn't moved as part of the Quest but to make Veos more visible instead of getting lost in the back of Port Sarim. For the purpose of the quest, they could have just as easily directed you to the back of Port Sarim or such. So they definitely could have told us about the Draynor Dock in advance for feedback or poll it even. Unless you mean the Corsair dock, which is a bit past the point since that quest is over a year old so...

DOWNVOTE THIS NOW AND DELETE PLEASE

yep nearly every tourney I've gone to has smelled like absolute shit, while college weeklies only really has one stinky guy (who usually doesn't even go to the college)

41 Runecrafting? Dang dude, you have more patience than I have xp.
---
are you new here? this isn’t a new thing 
---
 Bro this has been out of the game for years now
---
Is the Abyssal whip with d def viable for demonic gorillas?
---
Why? It is only useful if you are chopping the trees and it isn't that hard to just hold 9 Mushrooms to repair when you loop back around there. The only other thing in the Swamp is the Arch Boss, but the Mushtree is quicker and better than taking the bouncing shroom.

That and when Seers Bank in World 2 was the place to be to buy literally everything
---
I heard about a cc for f2p where smithers trade rune 2hs to alchers? Anyone know anything about this?
---
Would love your thoughts on this :D
---
Idk your stats but dust devil are profit and fast totens.
---
does kandarin headgear work as light if not equipped?
---
I think you mean seers village, falador is pretty bad iirc
---
so we should move the entire game to a dock in draynor
---
back in 08-09 i had so many people linking me 240p clips on youtube from the show
---
&gt; only a few people are doing it
---
This is wrong. people don't spend very long on thieving as a skill because of how fast it is. Five people at pp on each world is actually a fuck load considering how many worlds there are. Saying PP is dead content is just plain wrong.
---
A dock does not really fit Rimmington IMO.
---
I suggest this :
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/apmxg2/suggestion_veos_replacement
---
I didn't mean 'increase the ratio' I meant 'add more cool shit that a newb like myself can get'.
---
Do you have a source on that? If that's genuinely true I recognize your concerns.
---
Whats wrong with that guy? I know the name but i dont recall him saying any pretentious dumb shit like serene ever did
---
No that's haram
---
I don't wear guth to do damage, i wear it to heal. I don't expect the decked out t15 pally tank to out damage the naked ret pally with a t16 weapon.
---
Sounds like q a personal problem 
---
Nice backbone Jagex 🤔
---
Sounds one of many reason pvp polls dont pass
---
id like a bag to fill with the pyramid loot, alternatively, have desert ammy 4 make the loot from urns become liquefied into coins
---
Sometimes the real reward is not the gp you have in the bank but the friends you make and the adventures you share along the way. 
---
u can get quest cape in 3 weeks whats the fucking point ? literally none
---
Nice that they're removing veos from Draynor but uh...could we also not move the Corsair ship? ESPECIALLY to Rimmington? Just put Veos back where he was and leave the Corsair ship where it is.
---
Getting a d pick from callisto is actually pretty easy... I do it in full veracs which I understand us difficult in an iron man to get, but in probably the nearly 3k+ kc I have on callisto I have probably been pk'd 100 times. Almost always you get away. You could definitely do it with extremely low welfare set ups and 1 kill per run.
---
The concept of preparing lots of gear and resources to do  callisto on an iron man sounds like a really challenging and accomplishing goal to get a d pickaxe. I'd embrace it if I cared to make an iron man.
---
Maybe you should strive to it?
---
I mean c engineer has been doing a PK worlds only iron man with a 150m bounty on his head and he has yet to die...
---
Man 99 crafting was one of my firsts cause I wanted the super useful tele
---
Yeah I saw that, thanks, just not a fan of adding a dock to rimmington.
---
I have at least 7, but I started the game with a lot. Bought a few with the bonds package
---
yeah its giving me anxiety a very bad one too
---
Someone with a quest cape has engaged in a lot of content
---
How do you spell it “evrrytiem” twice in a row
---
It’s mobile so I can’t exactly right click, if you give me your username I think I can add you directly though
---
Im still at it with 120 callisto kills i just wish it wasnt a part of the wilderness and i know soooo many others share my mindset and like ive said once i dont want rs pvp to die it helps the economy a lot but nothing will pass at this rate
---
What are y’all doing?
---
Did u click on the giveaway streams mate. 
---
Is this vegan?
---
if i want to drop a useless quest item do i need other reason than it being useless to me ? what fucking reason you want ? i fucking got it not you... if i want to drop useless item to me why do i fucking need astronomical reason to do so ?
---
Yikes.
---
Just seems silly to need so much for a skilling item considering the d axe is soooo much easier to get
---
changing it back is the dumbest idea ever, gave more reason for draynor and it actually looked cool
---
Yep, this is the right answer. People need to realize they're reeeeeing over a video game 
---
I would have kept it and used it to set goals for your account but hey dropping it is also use full too... that was a big kappa 
---
yeah i agree lets lock polls behind quest cape
---
20th time posted today?
---
Agreed. Toon sounds fucking retarded
---
You too can save an ass crack life. I can see the commercials now. Sad music playing in the background. 
---
I dont get why other games call it pve
---
Be warned, big handouts can ruin the early game experience.
---
Then if you're already doing callisto and have yet to die (I'm unsure about that of course.) Moving it to a different monster put of the wildy and making it harder to obtain would be even more frustrating imo.
---
There are people who have gone 25k+ kc dry on dragon warhammers from lizard shaman... could you imagine that for a d pick?
---
Me! Exact same boat. Except you’re 7M exp ahead of me :P
---
Change email and RS password. Change PIN. Get 2 factor for your email too. 
---
That sounds like a better deal

I was in the wilderness the other day when I found loot like this. With nobody around I wondered where it all came from, so thank you for posting!

Wheres the best place to do agility at? For marks of grace, I am level 60 and have only 35. I do not have the seers diary done and am not even close to the req for it

I was getting tired of RS3s bullshit micro transactions. Switch to OSRS and swamped my coins. Haven’t looked back.

There was one guy here that calculated all the xp rates and cost, wasn't OP, why do u say it is, u have data?

I'm glad there are people out there who too have come from BfA, I started in october and used twitch prime 30 days of membership that was still on my twitch account after playing most of what f2p had to offer and I'm honestly addicted and more satisfied than any other time playing on WoW but I would say in a different way. I'm now just below 1700 skill total and loving it. Currently going for 83 construction as I just love convience and making travel better also prep for zulrah farm.

The mod who designed it was invested in ethereum, similar to how nieve was named after reach's gf, and a duck in falador was named after a female streamer

Somebody lost their spade.
---
All 4 ardy capes give stat bonuses.
---
Dude this would be amazing. 
---
True. However blizzard’s development process is complete trash whereas Jagex has the single best of any game ever
---
I don’t remember RuneScape being completely designed around PKing people in PvP gear... in fact if history wasn’t rewritten by angsty wangster PKers who use Eminem songs in their songs in their PKing videos it was completely designed around PKing in general, and the profit gained by killing anyone you came across in the wilderness. 
---
I strictly skill, but at least I don’t act like a 12 year old and try to pretend this game was not designed for(nor was its current iteration brought about by or for) skillers or PVMers.
---
Welcome to reality. Enjoy your stay

---
There's this volcano in the most northern part of the map, if you dig on the bridge with a spade it trims the spade.  Trimmed spade increases chances of clue scroll drops lately.  You'll need two people with you though, one on each side of the bridge to keep it from shaking.
---
Best way to find the mage arena 2 demons? Are the spawn tiles exact? Using default client btw.
---
What happened 
---
Woops, I forgot about ahrims. Yes you'll be needing the black dhide. Bring the legs too, if you can spare the space.
---
Yeah, that's because your response is stupid. It's not toxic when you reasoning is literally being too scared to risk precious pixels.
---
You're still going to get pked btw
---
There you go dodging the question again. But I don’t give a fuck if you want to drop it or not.
---
I merely want to know why you hate pets? Nothing more, nothing less. 
---
Let me repeat, I do not give one single fuck about what you do with the pet (including dropping it).
---
Can you answer the question, yes or no?
---
Running for wyvern campers would probably be more consistent. You bring gp and an empty inventory, and they trade you drops which you buy for a reduced price. You make money they get to camp longer without leaving.
---
&gt; While I'm on the subject, why enforce 7 days removal time on a brand new account?
---
Because you chose to have it that way. 
---
When you make your account you are given a choice on if you want a delay when removing status, and you choose to have that delay. 
---
I just finished nature spirit and jungle potion o my ironman now on to shilo village
---
How do u have it on tv
---
Edgeville
---
..what? The hell kind of analogy is that lol.
---
The point is, yes the wildy is fucking aids. I'm not even an ironman and i refuse to do anything other than my clues in wild because I CBA. The reason the wild sucks so bad right now is because pking sucks so bad..so now pkers are targeting the skilling players or 3 itemers not for loot but for the sake of pissing someone else off and just to get a kill. Seriously theres no benefit for them and its gross. Multi areas are just clanmanmode which is even lamer. Its complete fucking aids. Literally.

But you need to stop whining. You arent missing out on content because you dont have the best item in slot. You can still mine. And if you want the BiS then go do KBD. Theres no way youre running into pkers that often going to kbd..i do clues all the time and use the tele by ice plateau and ive seen a pker one time out of 100+ clues. Which i died stupidly cause i didn't log when i should have lol. Which goes back to the point of pking being so dead and stale that pkers literally camp the pvmers and 3 itemers..ita of no profit or benefit to the pker at all. But they do it to get some sort of satisfaction. 
---
And with that said still..if you dont like it, dont go in the wild. That simple.

I like bonds

Is there any hope for a sequel for the Cold War quest? As a quester, this was one of my favourite quests and because of its cliffhangar, I would absolutely love a sequel. 
---
There’s a place called the wilderness where this “community” will gladly run a train on you and take all of your shit
---
mainly through teleports and i was using it as my main combat stat until 55 when i alched all my fletching earnings for profit ofcourse :) 
---
hardly anyone gets banned for buying gold though 
---
That's not what I'm saying. Your comment history is what makes you a troll, idc you're a Trump supporter but why tf you bringing it up on the osrs subreddit. Just looking to start shit lol
---
Using Runelite's dev tools, I was able to find this strange NPC walking around the northwest corner of the Grand Exchange. It walks around, but you can't interact with it. Is it a glitch? Is it a deleted npc because it has a null label?
---
Even without Kandarin hard, for marks of grace Seers is going to be your best option. The absolute best course for marks is Canafis but you are at the cut off point of 20 levels higher than the requirement, meaning you would get reduced rates of marks. Between Seers and Canafis there is Falador, but the course is renowned for having a very poor marks return. Long story short, run Seers and don’t worry about getting Kandarin hard (unless you desperately want the higher xp rates). 
---
On a side note, you could bang out 75 smithing fairly easily if you’re willing to part with a bit of cash to do gold with gauntlets at the blast furnace - it’s extremely quick xp, so would definitely be a shorter grind than the 200 marks. I seem to remember it’s on the upper end off 300k xp/h (ie: close to 400k), but it may be slightly more than that.

I

Ok ill not going into the wild just like everyone else who slowly isnt just slowly waiting for it to die so much itll be a chore to even get pked. Good fix to the problem guy god why didnt i think of that.
---
The idea to just make the dock and boat smaller at draynor is not horrible 
---
Thanks!
---
Congrats! Mobile is the shit. 
---
A guy told me to avoid this area already lmao, thanks for telling me though
---
I’m pretty sure it’s just because the osrs market is heavily influenced by consumer speculation and market bubbles, in a very similar fashion to real life.
---
Should i still use Nieve at that level?
---
It is, cause you're fucking the eco by inflating. Stfu
---
Leveling a skill is easy if you can buy all of the best supplies for the fastest XP. 
---
Yeah that's Jagex customer support.
---
Eating gut, the new thing for all to see
---
Well yeah. If a pvper complained about being pk'd, they'd be pretty hypocritical. Pvmers just want to play the game on their terms. They should understand that the wilderness isn't their turf though.
---
This sub has to be the worst for people not knowing how to screen shot .

I love it

WoW would be a great game if it had 10% of the feeling of accomplishment that any one of these do; barrows gloves, fire cape, quest cape, diary tiers completed. 
---
Your accomplishments are never erased in OSRS. Maybe gloves were mildly devalued, but there never literally worthless when you come back. There's a level of reassurance that the effort has a real reward. 
---
In wow the best thing is to casually play so you can get casino titanforge.

Autism or 12 who knows at this point

amazing

This kid complaining about *several* hours lost and hasn’t even seen maxed HC Ironman accounts die. Poor thing.

Can you repost this? We need unidentified materials to be used for something besides the gauntlets. Even something small or cosmetic. Something

I'm against unpolled changes in updates but for unpolled removal of said unpolled changes. It doesn't make sense to have to vote on changing something that got in without being voted.

Ah, the Lumby Cow Farm. Probably the home for all the 10 yr old RS players back then. It really was beautiful back then huh?

Just got 70 slayer.   Kurask bots are ridiculous..however, they’re incredibly easy to fuck with and they provide endless entertainment
---
That's true but you don't need to safespot him. With your range you won't be able to outpace the 4 healers, so what you need to do is hoot each one once (maybe leaving one if it is on the far side of Jad). hitting the healer pulls it off Jad and makes them attack you instead. This means you can either kill them and then finish Jad, or just tank the healer hits and finish off Jad. Either way, Jad will be attacking you the whole time, and you will be pray switching the whole time 
---
Actually just came back😂
---
Isn’t this a YUGIOH monster already
---
true true i see what you mean
---
Basically, the moment you deal damage to a player in the wilderness(assuming 1v1 only), the loot is guaranteed to be yours even if a PvM monster deals higher damage than you. He just ice barrages anyone that gets too close at Callisto and let that frozen person get killed by the shockwave damage.
---
Check out f2p rimmington mine theres always like 10+ bots on one tile st iron

That’s funny lmao 
---
this video was very insightfull, 1m iq
---
Really reminded me of D2, ha
---
Bloodvelds really don't give any profit though..like at all. I get maybe 1-2 rune meds in a task lol. And maybe a few bloods. 
---
Use konar though for sure. I'm almost 80 slayer and ive been using her since she came out. Tbh I'm not to worried about the exp loss, maybe once i progress a bit more I'll change it up and go to duradel. 
---
Gargoyles are fucking amazing. Def extend them and dust devils. I should extend kurasks too probably but i rarely get them assigned tbh. Its weird for the longest I only got assigned hellhounds, Bloodvelds and fire giants or worms..but lately been seeing a bit of dust devils and gargoyles added in which is super nice. 
---
Hellhounds are still worth IMO cause they drop hella clues. Always do them tbh! If youre going for profit do every clue soon as they drop. Ive had 15 kills left on a task before got a clue and did it came back got another in those last 15 so its always worth doing. 
---
Then you don't need advice. Just go do it\^\^\^\^\^and get banned :)

3 ticking traps, with herb tar or teak log and knife where they put traps will break the bots, usually making them wander aimlessly and log, quite amusing to watch. A couple friends and I competed to see how many bits we could break, the winner broke 20 something in the first few hrs
---
DONT REMOVE THE CORSAIRS FROM PORT SARIM WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with killing people in the wildy, but the fact that sometimes you do with the intention to make someone angry and get a reaction is a pathetic way to live, I shouldn't have to explain why, now fuck off.
---
Now that’s something I never would’ve even tried if you haven’t told me. Thanks mika!

Bad bot

Post Malone

:(
---
I did use that, but I was just checking "very hot tiles" for like 1,5 invents of sharks until I got pk'd. Is there a more specific spot for each of them or some room for mistake is allowed?
---
Could actually be harmful to new players if npcs give outdated information. I can see how this would fly under the radar though.

121 bridding is so fucking boring though.

It’s designed that way because that’s the only time you can ever get that status. Once it’s gone you need a brand new account to get it again. It’s a big deal to some people, and it helps prevent hackers from deironing accounts that’s weeks/months of playtime were put into. I did the same thing as you, started off as an Ironman and I hated it. But it really does help you get a better feel for what’s going on in the game, and how to actually be able to do things yourself vs just going to the Ge

If someone is in the wilderness, they should have no expected right to immunity.  Being a pvmer is irrelevant if you are in the wilderness, you don't get special treatment, sad or not.  Don't enter if you are going to be a child and flame someone for killing you in an area which is meant for killing people.  The solution is for people to grow the fuck up and stop thinking that they are entitled to be immune in the wilderness.

---
Man thats awesome congratulations! But i will say rev caves was a really good update and i love that clan fighting happens there i just myself have a problem with pking clue hunters, d pick hunters, and things like that trying to obtain items they cant get elsewhere and then leave and never go back. People shouldnt have to feel like that. 
---
I would love to high alch this for money IRL lol..
---
Then again I might make a platebody from several parts and walk around the Renn Faire looking for GF...
---
Risk v reward. I loved risking my irons gear for that chance at the easy rcb. I understand some people feel forced to go in the wildy to get these items and get upset at dieing but without that risk these items would be a shit load harder to get.
---
All for just 10 lvls!
---
If you buy a dragon spear you can set it up yourself in the northern building. You’re going to need to youtube the exact technique
---
Or you can bank it 
---
hey dude, buy some steel armor with that money and trade it to me and I'll trim it gold for you.
---
Oh that was it.. Totally forgot about my old email. thank you for this 
---
I think they feel entitled to be able to obtain the content elsewhere. Such as d pick, clues, mage cape2. I bet if those things werent in the wild there would be less raging. Not saying moving them is the 100% fix cause its not but its just a thing people dont want to go into the wild but they want the few niche things it has to offer. That they feel like they should be able to obtain without pvp.
---
That's like saying reddit owns your browser because it's used to browse reddit. Your browser and reddit are entirely different things that belong to different people, even if they are meant to be used together, just like runescape and runelite. Jagex might decide you aren't allowed to use runelite to play their game, but they can't just suddenly decide it's theirs.

Damn why does everyone get early ikkle. 1300 kc here and still going, still off drop rate can't really complain yet tho lol

Also 2:44 pb? What bolts are you using with dhcb, seems to be long kill!!
---
Why not lol
---
Yeah of course
---
Damn that's like... slow, click intensive, AND not much profit?! Wow!
---
Medium diaries are the goal I'm working on right now. There's a lot of quests involved and also a good number of useful benefits. I'd do that and then try and finish up as many quests as possible.
---
Only if its polled; So that there aren't enough of them to vote no lmao
---
Both have solid rewards and you won't go wrong starting with either. I think the Grand Tree teleport from MM2 is amazing as is access to demonic gorillas. Plus if you're thinking about training range or mage, bursting/chinning in the caves is insanely good.
---
Myth Guild from DS2 is really nice for drag tasks, cooking, and recharging dragonstone items. Also the obvious unlock of Vorkath is a big benefit.
---
Fights are a little harder in DS2, puzzles are a little more annoying in MM2. Pretty much just pick your poison.
---
I feel yah and thanks bro :) my advice is most the people killing clue hunters are trash. Bring 3 good items and learn to anti pk them. There is a lot u can do to fuck with them or even kill and loot them.
---
Mess Hall is like 200k exp/hr or something like that and requires nothing 
---
Whatever you do, don't bend over when you pick up the spade.
---
Re-poll the resizing of the spellbook! It looks ridiculous when you filter something out.
---
There’s a monkey madness 2??
---
Thats understandable and i agree with that to a point i think items like d pick should be obtainable elsewhere such as rcb. Rcb is so easy and fast to get in wild but takes forever to get outside of the wild. But the d pick is only obtainable in the wild. Same mentality that got rune pouch a second method of obtaining. 
---
Price was inflated when mods polled the bone increase in price. You probably made a mistake.

At least you have great customer support on wow while you have nearly no customer support on runescape 
---
Never really understood why we  can't eat ham Men or ham women

Most people genuinely dont know how to pk and dont want to risk items to learn. I think being able to learn would help a lot. I also know skull tricking and such as steered a lot of people away from bringing anything.
---
Any updates?

That's exactly how i grind quests/skills lmao, never dropped a single clue.

You see people complain "omg it took me X hours doing this quest or get X lvl im this skill, but i got shit loot wow f this game"

There is plenty of content elsewhere, things like that being in the wilderness benefits pkers.  I don't see any space to complain when pretty much 99.9% of BIS items come from outside of the wilderness.  There are updates pretty much monthly that benefit pvmers as well so if they feel like they are at a disadvantage when there's a miniscule amount of drops from the wilderness, that's tough luck.  There is a grand exchange if they don't want to do the content, and inb4 "but ironmen"

You could continue a 50 atk pure..

This doesn't achieve the dev goals at all. The point is to make veos more accessible to f2p, not less.

his sentence was better than yours

The reason they got rid of randoms in the first place was because they weren't effective and only harmed regular players afking so bringing back aggressive ones is pointless

213 Quest Points later i can safely say i need a little break from quests hahahahaha

Can you give arguments for it? One of the hardest PvM content in the game should have an entry mode because..? Plenty of mid level content in the game if you don't have the stats to tackle the theater yet and if you have the stats it feels rewarding to learn it. :)

This ^ runelite.com is a phishing site
---
It's pretty much a cheese build for going after black chin bots (idk if good) or some laughs. If that sounds fun go for it, but the 1 pray granite mauler is pretty much the lowest investment build that does things to other pkers. Transitioning could work but the low hp might hurt.
---
I wouldn't mind them dipping into the RS3 lore a bit. The stuff around Nomad and While Guthix Sleeps were all really well done. I'd love a quest that's maybe not exactly the same, but touches on that aspect of the world again. Lucien and the Majharrat are some of the most interesting characters in the game and it's a shame they don't get much time in OSRS.
---
Worth a shot, Could I please have one?

Good luck everyone :)

So many delusional PVP only rejects in this post, the game and the world don't revolve around you, you pvp in a 2007 mmo you fat losers.

Use super set and locator orb. Get to 1hp. Afk for 15mins. In Hard mode you take a load of dmg cuz hp is not always 1. In normal mode u take next to no dmg. Either way u get 80k+ w. Dh and 90ish str.

Normal is more afk is the point. Overload/hard is “better” though.

Pro tip, once you get dragon throw the rest out but KEEP YOUR RUNE DEFENDER! Then if you lose your dragon defender you don't need to start from scratch. 
---
Wait are you serisouly saying that until 2015 there were less than 200 PVMers/skillers out of the 10's of thousands of people that played osrs?

I would love where you got those numbers, but don't want to see your ass.

---
Well RS3 has revo++ which is more laid back than traditional revo. Just get a revo++ action bar from the wiki and you are good to go for slayer or low level bossing in RS3.
---
I don't like pking because it's just not fair to be honest , as a mid lv main with 60 ish base combat stats lv 80 or so I have zero chance at killing a pker because of how the combat lv works in this game and get jagax real wants to push pvmers I'm to the wildy. So it's annoy to see all the stuff in the wildy but as soon as I step in it a get killed. 
---
I watched some of the (insanely long) first episode but he seems very ill-informed about the details of his run compared to Settled or Statistically Challenged. I expect him to miss a lot. But also, his goals seem very arbitrary. In Chunk #1, does he also have to light a Yew log on fire and fletch a Yew longbow (u)? Does he have to attain a high enough Magic level to cast every spell that he has the available book for using the runes found in that chunk? Is he going to grind his Attack to 20 for a Mithril Battleaxe from Bob in Chunk #1? I'm sure he explained some of these later in the video but it seemed far too sloppy for me to get invested in it.

About 7-8k of those are from view count phishing bots, so it's not as much as you would think.

---
The problem is probably a hardware issue then. If you’re only playing osrs and doing school work don’t go crazy. You can get a good machine for max $500 and that should be high end for what you need. 2.0-2.3 ghz processor, no more than 8 gbs of ram, 500gb harddrive and you should be set for quite a few years. Look on newegg, they’ll have what you need.

It's not worth it. Unless you don't have a full time job, you won't be able to put it the time and effort needed to actually have an enjoyable experience. All of the fun content is locked behind hundreds of hours of gameplay. Everything in the beginning hasn't changed in over 10 years. Early game is very boring and demotivating if you have a full time job, but if you are part time or don't have a job, it is possible.
---
check quest rewards before you do them, don't attack on defensive or controlled style?
---
can't think of anything major that you need to be aware of.
---
I see you weren't here for the pride event
---
boohoo? I mean you can always choose not to go in pvp. I find risk v. reward thing good like many people. And it shouldn't be changed just because some pussies die instantly if you look at them in pvp in their rune armor. Maybe learn to fight back/defend if you're doing wildy things? or don't go in pvp if you're like disabled or something
---
The way I do is 4dwh specs, 20 arc, 300bgs and I use probably 1/2 sharks per trip has to be in that order 
---
Did this, now I'm gay

Where did I go wrong?

ya I use that typically just annoying to recharge

Konar is bae.

2 claws, leather, full ring, pet, helm in 600 kills. Easily 200m+ in rare drops. Probably 30m from the common. Also variety in slayer locations is nice.

The issue is that the skill is very outdated and not rewarding outside of 10k gp per inventory. "Just do astrals or zmi" isnt fixing the core issue of the skill which is the fact that it's not fun, and is in fact, boring. Zmi/bloods/souls were the last update the skill has gotten. Slayer gets a new update every patch, and its everyone's favorite skill despite it being slow. There's a reason for that. It's simply good design. Banking, filling up rune pouches (should be done automatically), banking, then running for a minute to the abyss, finding your portal, clicking on altar, emptying your pouches (should be done automatically), and using a glory to bank and repeat is not fun and it is not a good design for a skill. There's no excitement outside of "will I get a pet this time?", only to be disappointed that you didn't.
---
I remember when I had my first beer.

Lmfao!! I remember these days when I was a little shithead kid. I swear I would never fucking learn. I would die 3 times before I finally made it to Varrock, then arriving I would realize I had no plan when I got there. I had no idea what I was doing.
---
Well yeah, they're not supposed to do things on their own. New content is supposed to be decided by polling, as stated on the original launch poll for old school servers.

Wtf do you mean you're going to buy one? He said he made it, what gives you the idea that he's selling them? Idiot.

You’ll need it for diaries and clue scroll. One of my tasks for an elite clue scroll was to create a Super Defence Potion (66 Herblore).
---
Just BS I got it without doing any research on how to play seriously 
---
Now I understand the basics
---
every osrs player should take some time to get to know the basics of pvp and the wilderness in my opinion, i feel a lot of the salt and spite from pvmers stems from a lack of understanding. 
---
go pk a few times, find some friends to practice with in clan wars, i bet you your switches, combo eating pray switches and movement will all get a helluva lot better and will help you get better at the game. 
---
i’ve played since 2005, i stopped when eoc came out and i really only started pking about 5 months ago on and off depending who’s online in my cc &amp; in those 5 months my general skill of the game has increased greatly. 
---
there is always a counter to everything in this game really unless you’re caught in multi by a huge clan, even then you have slim chances to get out if you play your cards right. don’t get mad at the pkers, they’re just doing what they like in the only part of the map they can (non pvp worlds), push yourself to be a better all around player. 
---
Not how RNG works but gratz!

This is good

Is this real or shopped ?

For real, people think every little thing can be posted as an achievement.

damn dude don't leak my new RC method

I'm not going to debate whether this post is fake or not, just speaking in general here. But these kinds of posts can be exactly like the whole "selling 13 trouts" deal at the ge. Make people think you're a noob and get showered in donations, more successfully than if you had just begged for them.

PvP: This activity require an ascended brain. You have to learn a ton of things, build your account properly and you need skills beyond the apprehension of any mortal human being!

This needs to be a thing the base olm is garbage.

take my upvote, given me the proper giggle s lmfao

That makes no sense but I'm happy it works that way.
---
Sadly no you won't see your stuff again, I think only times items have ever been refunded are 
---
1. When it turned out a jmod had been the one hacking them and 
---
2. I think one time they changed one of the normal worlds to a deadman world without properly logging off everyone who was on it and someone lost millions since people who die in deadman lose their most valuable items right from their bank or something like that
---
If they refunded items from being hacked it would be far too easy to fake being hacked and essentially double your money
---
nah. this is a pretty funny thing, lighten up. he’s dressed like a clown for god’s sake lol
---
Tbh a basic pure account risks like 100k tops. You bring some knives/msb and a gmaul. You stay 1 prayer so you don't even have to learn pray switches, you literally do msb-&gt;gmaul spec until you get the hang of it down and then build your account to learn more stuff.
---
Instead of making yet another set, why not get an item from PP to upgrade the Rouge's outfit? Someone mentioned as a set bonus to not being able to get hit during PP, could be a nice extra effect for the Rouge's outfit. 
---
Crossfire Ghost mode is this; 2 team, one with guns and nades and shit and the other team only has knives. BUT they are invisible if they dont move, hut sound like darth vader all the time. Its one enjoyable mode so far.
---
That's not a competitive shooter at all.
---
They refunded him in platinum tokens to the value of items lost, since he was not an ironman, and the bank key was inaccessible for the guy who killed
---
No, it helps you prepare for real life that way
---
Suck it up, buttercup
---
The problem is these nerds if overweight sweat buckets during the day so even if they did shower the sheer body heat from everyone else means they end up fucking stinking anyway shower or not

In PvP you don’t really want to risk expensive rings like that and the standard is usually just recoils

I shower at night and deodorant in morning

3. They refunded items to an ironmen due to a TOB reclaim item chest bug. 
---
Why do you think it’s other people’s opinion that drives me away from wearing these? I literally said i think the clothes look bad. That’s my own opinion.

800kc here same shit with that bitch of a blue snake

It's actually pretty awful preparations. Banks are often compelled by law to refund funds that were fraudulently stolen.

I camp kurasks on my pure for a long time and they don't even log out anymore.

People come in thinking they're gunna make it log like "haha, wanna see something funny?    Bot" and it just continues on. Same thing with reports. They don't care at all anymore cause jagex doesn't ban them.

I'm in the Netherlands and the USA and Aussie servers noticably lag. Especially annoying in raids, makes it impossible to consistently prayer flick.

Stay ignorant friend. What started as a mildly annoying maze and tough boss led to 2 hours of me complaining about aids monkeys, and then a week of combat training to actually kill the boss.

The other guy is right it's skullball agility course. Insanely slow, click intensive outdated agility course. I had a clue scroll step and decided to do it in the car.

That’s boosting and yes it’s against the rules.

ive read news articles that say applying it at night is more effective, something along the lines of it has the time to properly dry in.

not gonna tell you how to live your life but why would you have a 6+hour window of no deodorant anyways? Personally my arm pits would be swamp-like by the time I woke up.

Also yeah all your items are saved so your only cost is consumables.

What exactly does a High Risk World entail and does it change anything about the game if you're in area that's normally a non-PvP area?

Thanks my luck has been crazy at arma lol

They took tick-eating out of pvp a long time ago, as much of a god woox is, he's fucked lol
---
Or just a 2.5% xp boost like other skilling sets

YouTube mage only Zulrah kill for an easy first. Also go on the max world with a Tbow set up and no swaps. Just get used to running to each side of the island.

Why keep building new docks what the fuck.
---
Just keep them all in port sarim. It's a port. That's what it's for. It's literally been fine for years. It's not like you're adding new boats, just moving around already existing boats that already fit there for no reason at all.
---
Rimmington shouldn't have a port just like draynor shouldn't have a port.
---
Just leave this as they have been working fine for years.

Yes i'm clearly the one gatekeeping, except its PVP players with a retarded superiority complex that osrs exists purely because of there effort, shut your mouth cunt.

What's wrong with that? I have loads of fun anti pking when doing pvm. Plus you have the advantage of being unskulled, bring good gear and fight back.

Yes I forgot the options in runescape are tree clicking and pvp, twisting shit to fit your own narrative sure is a staple of every reddit nerd.
---
The whole reason people become Ironman is because they want to be getting all the supplies/gear/etc. themselfes. Removing resources from pvm droptables will make ironman skill more, which is exactly what ironmen should be signing up for.

Right now ironman is getting ur combat up and getting all bis-items from that combat..

Hey guys,

Was wondering if Vorkath or Zulrah is better currently for gp/h? Assuming i dont have Tbow for Zulrah. Stats are all 90+, comfortable aT Zulrah but barely done Vorkath. Elite void is owned too
---
Honestly even as is, it's not that bad. The real problem is that you are forced to do nothing but tithe for a solid 15 minutes at a time, and then after that you are forced to get more seeds from the front door. 
---
If tithe farm just gave you an unlimited seed bag and paid attention to how many you let die out of how many you planted and determined your points whenever you decided to deposit, it would be a lot less stressful and annoying.

But they haven't banned killing them. And if you know what you're doing, getting to start dragon slayer isn't that hard.

And I doubt the changes made it non-viable. But maybe slightly more profitable for the ones doing it.

Just make the account and farm for a longer time before you break the rules on it.

Yeah but they did brought osrs back.

So Wreck3d a rs2 pking youtuber started the initiative. And his audience (mostly pkers) backed him up.

&gt;Lol what the fuck? My first time playing I got invaded then one shot in undead burg by some guy with a top hat who shot some magic bolts. Literally  the definition of an easy kill. What's with the holier than thou attitude?  There's shitty people in every community, and vice versa. 
---
There's thousands of people who sit and wait for invaders with their 2 friends and then pile them 1v3 and spam the point down emote (like saying sit on OSRS for anyone who doesn't play dark souls). PVP used to be fun in the early days of each game but it's a shit fest now
---
Only 3200 hours to go, goodluck!
---
Atleast you left his name in so people can witchhunt him nice one :^)
---
k thanksbye.
---
&gt;Yeah twinks exist, but most serious pvp players don't even keep characters at a low enough level to invade at undead burg, the difference is, those twinks are the exception in DS, as opposed to OSRS, where pkers regularly camp clue spots, teleportation spots, abyss runners, and skillers, where they know that no one is gonna attack back 9/10 times.
---
You ever played dark souls 3? Good luck finding a 1v1 as an invader

just get to 77 runecrafting haha
---
Go to hell then.
---
I spent a few hours there to kill dark wizards and cut willows on my new ironman and Veos being there was NOT a big deal. It was actually convenient having him be easier to access from Lumbridge. I can't say I'm very proud of the community forcing this change because it kind of rewards everyone who was screeching in protest
---
Still my favourite till today, so fucking well made
---
i would recommend turning off roofs. good luck
---
Baa!
---
I worked it out as ~53 hours using 83 seconds of this vid?

Good bot.

Dark Souls is only as hard as you make it on yourself. You can do no hit runs or you can use all the summons and OP weapons. RC is pretty slow either way. So glad I never have to train it again.

My mum has fortnite

At the time he made that song he actually had only approximately 6M in value if I remember correctly. Fucker lied.

Hopefully they do something about it. I've seen more "runecraft bad" memes in the last week than I have about the docks in Draynor, and that's getting redone.

The Reddit outrage would be real. “Why should I have to deal with pkers when I want to use the looting bag. We should have double the inventory at all times for free!!!”
---
Noshit the ponds gunna get his crown removed? Why else would you post the witch-hunt to Reddit with his name uncensored? 
---
Wut? That was his whole fucking point all along with the post lololol
---
You do realize that Jagex didn't need to make a new dock with this quest, right? Veos and his ship already existed in Port Sarim. Jagex could have used that location. Therefore this new dock in Draynor Village wasn't needed and thus wasn't part of the quest. 
---
Jagex barely communicated anything about the quest, let alone making (relatively) drastic changes for this small introductory quest. So how could we have known about it when Jagex polled the quest?
---
No i want updates that makes the game mlfe enjoyable for everyone youre being ridiculous. 
---
&gt; Regardless of XP/hour, dbones still hit that sweet spot of price/gp/xp/hour.
---
IMO hydra bones hit that sweet spot now. They are far more affordable than Dagganoths and Superiors and offer a significant boost in exp.
---
Dragon bones are for people who need a cheap prayer exp. Anything less are for noobs. 
---
Squidward is that you? 
---
What was that shit again? Don’t remember ever playing it in rs2
---
fuckin rakins
---
and porkapips
---
LOL exactly, you do you my man. If you like big gold swords and shit fuck it
---
Engine team is busy with mobile
---
I remember it was like a see-through sphere with a splash effect after the first hit being the classic ice block. They handled that pretty badly imo lol
---
Demo was pretty awful at the start of the expansion. Now its pretty overpowered with the recent EP buffs. 
---
It's because your screen has curved corners at that point.

It's meant to protect people from having unusable buttons due to screen shape or notches

---
Respectfully disagree bro.
---
Osrs pvp has the potential to make an explosive comeback.
---
I really love this game, primarily the pvp aspect. It has tremendous potential. It's literally like jagex are sitting on top of a gold mine, yet not realizing it.
---
No pvp aspect in any other game that I know of has this unique combination of skill and luck.
---
Nh pking takes so much skill yet at the same time, it remains extremely exciting because of the inherent unpredictability.
---
If jagex provided a hint of care towards the (casual) pvp community, we would be needing way more pvp worlds due to over-population.
---
Hmm, I suppose that depends on personal choice.
---
In my opinion, a 52% XP increase is not worth double the cost (at current GE prices).
---
Le gnome kek'd
---
This is some pretty great stuff! I loved watching Cloud's previous 60 kills to learn Zulrah.
---
I've found in the past though, I get venomed from just being on the isle (not when being attacked at all by anything and no being in the clouds). Which doesnt seem to have happened to you once in this entire time?
---
Same happened to me, but here's some things you can do: get your favourite pet, get full graceful and other skilling bonus sets (if you don't already have that) maybe attempt inferno?
---
Rune alter 
---
roonieboonie no goodie
---
Motherfucking right, my inventory looking kinda tight, And I'm blessed
---
Yo, /u/Derboman let me get the vesta's chainbody.
---
&gt;Not true at all, gear correctly and you have the advantage over a brid, big clans aren't there to kill pvmers, they have bigger fish to fry like their reputation vs other clans that happen to be out at the time.
---
We agree, I think you just misunderstood me. Pvmers are just the initial bait to draw pkers there, and then the large activity of pkers leads to clan wars which becomes the actual primary activity.
---
&gt;You could argue that wilderness content isn't for "new pvmers" just like inferno isn't for new pvpers but they're required to do it anyway if they want to compete, funny how nobody complains about that but just does it anyway even though it's infinitely harder than defending yourself while skilling in the wilderness.
---
No see this is my problem with shit like rev caves. It isnt good and is not required to compete. Any good pvmer will just do vorkath or zulrah (assuming no raids cause thats a final feat). Thats why I call revs a bait. Its just there to bait badly informed pvmers which snowballs into making it a clan war area. If you are referring to content like the chaos altar or resource area thats not pvm so thats not what ive been talking about. That content actually has a real powerful benefit to skillers, so it isnt just a bait.
---
&gt;Multi is a totally different ball game and is meant for groups of players to contest and ultimately create fights for bigger teams, not for random pvmers to cheese and be safe all the time in welfare gear.
---
Then dont use pvm content? Thats the whole problem. Pkers dont give a shit about the revs, they are there for the clan battle. Pvmers dont give a shit about the revs because they will just get killed. The only actual point of the revs is to act as a bait initially which attracts bad pvmers, which then is a bait for attracting pkers, which then is a bait to attract more pkers until its a hotspot. But not for the revs. Its just a hotspot because it escalated to that point. No one there actually gives a shit about the revs at that point. 
---
You shouldn't get venomed unless you get attacked by zulrah or the little snakelings (or if you sit in the venom clouds).
---
Dungeoneering was the peak of the game, full stop. The way it was presented made me think it was the final skill ever.
---
Money from slayer depends if you do boss tasks or not. The xp is slower but you'll make a fuckton of money if you do demonic gorillas , Arma gwd, cerb, etc.. regular tasks don't rly give that much gp. If you want to make as much profit as possible I'd actually recommend not extending 'money over time' tasks like Abby demons and spectres. Just do all bosses you can do with slayer, way more gp and you don't waste time doing slower, mediocre profit tasks.
---
Netherlands- EU here and the show's on netflix if that makes you feel even better
---
Can confirm, am this guy
---
I'm sure I've heard this before too
---
Any more runecrafting exp that I get is great!!!
---
Yeah I know, but those activities require high skills and are thus not accesible to most people. Dungeoneering solved that and brought a similar experience to all levels. I feel there could be more content like raids for lower level players.
---
Stop
---
You gotta really get into the groove of a farm run dude, get 100% hosidus favour... It's easy
---
Get a xerics talisman and use the glade teleport for the hosidus patch...
---
Then you got catherby...
---
port phasmatys... do ghosts ahoy for the ectophial to teleport there...
---
Then you got the farming guild with the herb patch, you need 65 farming to use that part of the guild but you also have a cactus patch is the far northeast corner at 57.. I believe it's 57 farming for cactus.. You also got the cactus patch in al kharid which is south of the duel arena teleport...
---
Then you also have the patch south of the ranging guild, technically ardougne..
---
Then there's the falador patch... 
---
Those six patches for herbs and the cactus are all available to you before quests that have rather high reqs 
---
Look into the quest my arms big adventure and making friends with my arm for two additional disease free patches. And last there is another patch available only after completing the elite morytania diary on harmony island.
---
For birdhouses, I'll post a YouTube guide for you here in a minute... but you need to do the quest bone voyage, and get a digsite pendant...then unlock the teleports on fossil island.. It's not that hard.. look in the crafting guide under other for level requirements for birdhouses and in the hunter tab under birdhouses for other level requirements. 
---
You need a hammer, a chisel, 10 barley seeds and the corresponding log per birdhouse there are 4 spots on fossil island. Also, 4 clockworks, you can buy from g.e, you get them back and can reuse each one when you dismantle the birdhouse.
---
Also after you can harvest watermelons they make super compost,  the farming guild bin holds 30 and all the others hold 15...
---
Umm, what's wrong buddy?
---
They have problem with sending few prizes for over a year and we're talking about making new client… 
---
Uh what? That doesn't answer my question and makes no sense.
---
&gt;Im upset that these keys passed the poll, and lets be real its only so that people can make these videos.
---
something something dopamine rush
---
Get checked dude, you're showing signs
---
Imagine thinking runecrafting is worse than hunter
---
Also make sure you do diaries for specific farming teleport benefits,  primarily lumby and ardougne ... I'll post that link in a second 
---
If you can woox walk and have DHCB and can pay enough attention to Not get 1 shot by a fire ball, vorkath is better. If not Zulrah. They are both good.
---
Why not just use dh? 
---
Quests and diaries.

I don't know man, I think blue cape swampletics is gonna be the best era
---
What about the faster sprint energy regen?
---
in eoc something a lot of people hate but I actually liked was that the high level potions were locked behind having the herblore level to craft them yourself--and now (untradable) bis melee + a permanent recoil effect is locked behind having your smithing level high, etc. There's been suggestions about adding an extra higher level version of a specific fish that's very good because it doesn't make you lose adrenaline when you eat it, that heals more but is untradable.
---
I don't think overloads and red blubbers and armour spikes specifically would be good for osrs, but the idea behind it is something I like, but that might be because I'm having fun with my new ironman recently
---
Nope all it is is you cant use protect item anywhere. Its not full PVP itfs jsut a world that protect item is disabled. It used ti be a good world for finding pvm spots but now everyone knows about it so doesnt work as well.
---
Falador is BAD. I read around and people said fally, and there I got 2-3 marks every hour. Moved to seers and got 5-10 every hour.
---
Explain for someone that's never fought Zulrah? 
---
Stealth nerf to silly jester boots.
---
Bro nobody with 70, or 80 slayer should be bossing 
---
Even at 90s, it's an option like I said a million times to be efficient and boss after you max combat cause that's just beneficial overall in the longrun 
---
Please dont, I honestly enjoy tithe farm and having to alternate cans to keep up with the planting is fun. If you did that you'd remove a lot of the complexity from the minigame and it just wouldnt be worth doing imo :(
---
You can't provide evidence that the people who don't like it are in the majority either...

That's why i think they should poll it before moving it back to port sarim. I genuinely think it would result in it being kept in the same place.

I’ve been doing Lava rc for a while now, just hit 80 rc. Dare I say it, but the grind has been enjoyable so far. It’s not so the rhythm and racing other Lava rc’ers.

It is really daunting at first and it put me off until I was level 25 or something. Have a look at the wiki and they give you step by step guides on how to farm each herb, tree, fruit tree etc.
---
Most people farm toadflax/ranarr/snapdragon/torstol herbs. Toadflax has a pretty good return on your investment. Over a week i made 1.6m just off of toadflax herbs. I used to do ranarrs and made 3.5m profit in three days but that was taking up most of my time.

Birdhouses are really good for passive xp too. I've got from 31 Hunter (tears xp) to 64 in a couple of weeks just from birdhouses alone. Use the highest tier of birdhouse you can and each birdnest you get sells for ~2.2k. Grind them if you want for a couple hundred gp from each. And you'll get seeds like yew/magic which sell fir a decent amount too.
---
I needed a push to start birdhouse runs and I've never regretted the time it took to get into the swing of it albeit maybe an hour or two depending on your museum kudos.
---
Good luck! Check youtube out as well for quick how-to guides!
---
Thats because KQ has a special property of not missing with her ranged and mage attacks, its really not compsrable. 100% accuracry versus a fraction of 1%.

What is unskulling? I found a video about it but it doesn't actually explain what it is. Googled it and no explanation. I know basically it's you get skulled, then remove your skull (how) then come back and continue pking. My question is why even attack them if they aren't skulled.
---
BfA seems like a dress-up-character game imo. The most interesting part for me was exploration (which is awesome), and unlocking new races. But the gameplay itself is so bland and boring. Their quest system is such a repetive, pointless grind that I'd rather spend it on osrs where any time invested in any skill is beneficial to your account. 
---
Why grind for an item if it is going to expire in a couple of months.
---
Recovering from the flu so I might be crazy but isn't this graph crappy? It seems to be calculating gp/exp if you were to bury the bone. With the 350% and the effective %100 more multiplier from the wildly alter, the big base exp bones will be much more cost effective than shown here.

Why does reddit hate pking? I dont get it
---
&gt;You can't provide evidence that the people who don't like it are in the majority either...
---
The burden of proof rests with the one making the claim. I don't have proof that those who didn't like it are a majority - my point is the above poster doesn't have proof either and is claiming that he's in the majority while those who disagree are a minority, as a way to bolster his "side" - except it's completely baseless.

Zulrah's range form only uses ranged attacks, but the mage form can do range OR mage attacks. Zulrah is notorious for going into mage form then ranging 4x in a row for up to 41 each

If it's your first time at jad I would suggest bringing a rune cbow switch to tag the healers a little bit easier. Blowpipe all the way to jad, then switch to rcb with dragonstone bolts in your arrow slot instead of a blessing. The healers can be just out of range for bp which will throw your prayer switches off. Good luck!

I don't mind the wildy being the way it is, I've been arguing about the elaborate excuses pkers come up with to avoid admitting they're just salt farming when they camp clue spots. The other thing is I'm pretty sure the average ds pve character is vastly better equipped to take on an invader than a clue hunter is to a pker, just the fact that they get double the healing items an invader can possibly have evens the field considerably. But either way, in ds, if you choose to become embered or human, then you're opening yourself up to invasions in exchange for the advantages it gives you, that's just how the game is balanced. In saying that, it doesn't make you any less of a dick for stomping an obvious noob, who can barely survive the trash mobs.
---
Perfection has already been achieved.
---
Nope. I've played since OSRS release, because I'm a true fan. 
---
Yea the only issue is that a lot of these clue hunters who  are making the claim that pkers are 'only gonna get a spade' have never killed a naked clue hunters that accidentally brought their cashpile with them.  Solely because there are plenty of players that do that by accident, it makes all clue hunters worth killing lol

If you swapped your coins from RS3 to OSRS you basically bought a microtransaction due to inflation. Ironic.

Re-poll minus exp lamps please, would be a great money sink.
---
pro tip don't share the day your account was created because others can use that to steal it via a recovery attempt
---
Okay yeah those polls where 2k people said slayer was their favorite and the rest of the skills got 200 or less. Cool. Like I said, people like runecraft because everyone hates it. Have you seen all the "rc bad" memes and all the upvotes accumulated?
---
Also, there are other skills that everyone hates, and the fastest experience per hour in that skill is unlocked early on? This skill is busted, it's shit, and needs an overhaul. Sorry.
---
It did pass, but the data on the website is incorrect. It has been incorrect for years actually.

If you plan on doing wyverns, they drop unpowered orbs. Also if you plan on doing a lot of battle staff crafting then orbs till 87. Then 87+ it’s light orbs

If you're doing nmz for points you want to do hard, if you're doing it for XP it doesn't really matter though the monsters have more HP and hard so that's probably better xp too

It’s funny you say that because all the British people I’ve played with on OSRS have the most atrocious California American accent ever. Not saying all can’t do it because obviously there are actors who fucking nail them but some brits have a very hard time. 
---
How can they vote? Shouldn't even be allowed in the banks if you ask me. 
---
That's also another factor, but he can still move to unlocked chunks. In fact, according to his rules, he HAS to complete content in previous blocks as it becomes available. Had he unlocked the cows, he would have had to go back and complete Cook's Assistant, as drops allowed him 2 of the 3 items needed. Another example is that fact that since his starting chunk has a furnace and he can get steel ingredients  from HAM members he now has to craft a steel bar. This is why he's gonna be on his three chunks for a while.

Oh I know. Check the chatbox, some random dude danced for luck on that kill and it happened 
---
 Mean d hatchet can be obtained through todt, id suggest something similar would be nice. I just dont believe in skilling items being obtained from fighting especially when its in an area where more than half the player base doesnt want to go
---
But what if it's a very specific cat that likes lasagna...
---
Sure, but it is extremelly impractical. You would always forget it in the bank when going to farm runs, at least I would :D
---
Actually, I realise the bank PIN is not hack-proof anyways. But I just wanted the system to be consistent: any storage that hold valuable things is protected by the PIN. Now the Tool store comes into this cathegory, so why keep it out of the system? There are very few people who hold more than 2M in the servant's bag, and the prize chest has the limit of some puny sum - and is still protected. 
---
Just out of perfectionism I've suggested this.
---
Like rune pouch is pvm but was given another option to obtain outside of wild which i think is a good move.
---
fucking unplayable
---
Even boaty’s hcim dies at Zulrah occasionally, shit happens dude. Plus it’s a meme 
---
After recently maxing my ultimate ironman I decided to up the ante and forge my own journey from scratch
---
I remember watching someone die in full adamant in the stronghold of security and I took it. I contemplated messaging him and giving it back to him but maaan that was so much money for me. 
---
Oh, my bad. I assumed that those ranks you listed out were really high.
---
It's still dumb, but I thought that it locked out that top 5% (which the other comment saying something similar also implies, saying it locks out casuals and hardcores)
---
Can we at least consider a requirement to vote in the polls? This isn't meant to sound wrong or harsh however with a large influx of players since mobile release things may now pass that wouldn't of ever passed previous.
---
Some ideas to unlock poll voting;
---
* Quest point requirement
---
* Overall time played requirement 
---
* Skill level total requirement
---
This will at least secure the integrity of the game, this is not meant to come across as bashing new players however I find it hard to understand why someone would have access to potentially swinging poll results with very little knowledge or understanding of the game.
---
Fair enough on the Sara Sword. In terms of ranged, a rune crossbow is good enough until you have a blowpipe and even then you will probably use your rune crossbow for certain stuff. 
---
The Black Mask is currently around 1.7-1.8m and once imbued through Nightmare Zone (costing 1.25m points) it gives 16.67% accuracy + damage to melee and 15% damage + accuracy to both ranged and magic whilst on a slayer task vs the monster you're assigned. This is a massive upgrade and as I said, a must-have for slayer.

In my opinion pkers have gotten to the point where if you arent a dedicated pker yourself you stand no chance at all. They are going to have perfect stats, perfect gear, and perfect reflexes. I can try all i want but im not going to win.

Well now you know you might notice that some ironman streamers choose to wear mystic bottoms in solo xeric's because of the large amount of running despite owning the ahrims robe bottom. That's because it's so heavy
---
I can confirm this.
---
My account got Hijacked in Diablo and banned for botting, and figured it would be too much work to try and pitch my case and have the community tell me "nah fuck off, you were botting" or something like that.
---
I messaged them like 2 years after, and my account was unlocked in like 4 minutes after the reply. Their game design in WoW, with the soulbound gear, also makes it less risky of people "getting hacked" to RWT. Basically, as unintuitive and unrecommended as this is, you don't even really need to pay attention to your account because they'll just hit the rewind button.

I know many will not give the slightest fuck. F2P pking is a very niche thing within a niche game. But These guys do make it very difficult to enjoy.

How did this in any way influence the fact that you got a pet? Logic doesn't check out

Is it a actually going to be a Q&amp;A this week 
---
900 iOS core was really high at the time but you would ave to run your own keys that are given at random. You could have all +15 keys but 1 dungeon that the game just decided not to give you and be sitting at a low io score because of it. And if you try to run someone else's key they won't let you because of your low iOS core so you literally cant improve past that point until you get that specific dungeon key yourself and it can take another 20+ dungeons of either raising or lowering your key.
---
that's an instant KO
---
There are literally 23 other stats you still need to get up to 99. You think you can just get one and quit??? Pfft, nah homie you stuck in this for life like the rest of us.
---
How long til the combat update?

Lmao 8m isn't that cheap. Not all BIS gear needs to be 20m+

Almost 1m! Just to imagine what all Op can buy with it!

it was a halloween special event first i think, but it got voted to remain as an actual f2p quest, which is why its got so much content for what it is. They do typically put that much effort in for holiday events.

Nope;you just got r/whoosh

Are J Mods actively considering a Construction Skilling pet? Can the Construction pet be the chair that follows you around in Draynor Manor? (Including sitting on it? Similar to the Animation Hans had during the winter holiday event)
---
No pet?
---
I've seen pictures of people using a bluetooth mouse/keyboard, although I can't comment on exactly how well it works. I imagine it's alright.

As for something to do, if you're getting those peripherals then you're really not limited to anything. Without them, I just stick to skilling/slayer.
---
Column B for me lol.

meanwhile, i eat 10  fucking food every fight because of the snakelings and the random ass ranged attacks

Hi hi!

I'm surprised you've kept your 07Scape edge this sharp after all these years
---
4-5x? You can get around 3k buckets of sand an hour AFK with teleporting to house in Yanille then Seers bank. Mining the sandstone requires more quests, diaries and even then it's not going to be anywhere near 4-5x the speed.
---
I mean, I suggest you still do what he says
---
You actually fuckin dumb man, weak ass troll sort out your life mate
---
What you're complaining about has been around as long as I can remember and I've been playing since at least 2005. Considering the internet/game has a massive community in comparison to those times, it's only natural you'll come across more jerks.
---
But if you think osrs players are the worst, go check out WoW or League. 
---
I know it "isn't" but compared to all the other BiS gear then it actually is, and they are locked behind a 95 slayer boss so you would expect the price to be slightly higher - As I mentioned before I think the issue is that Jagex locked them behind these huge reqs just because they were afraid to upset the community. 
---
dang i bet you cam get through the gate to al-kharid now
---
May I have a look?
---
The money part is what gets me. Most of the PKers I’ve seen are people who already have established accounts and for whom losing 400-800k if they die isn’t a big deal. Meanwhile for me that’s like an eighth of my bank. Not going to “just try it” when the proportional cost is that much higher. Maybe one day when I’m richer haha. 
---
Could be a phishing attempt. Just make sure your email hasn't been compromised (check sessions and change password to be sure) and all security measures for your RS accounts are in place. If your email is breached, there could be a chance hackers are using it to reset the passwords associated with the listed accounts in the email.
---
I'd like to see your math on that.
---
Had a shower question if you will. Was wondering if it was technically within game rules to pay someone to level a skill to 99, or if not within game rules, does Jagex care at all.
---
I wonder this because Jagex does not care about fire cape buyers, though they do for infernal cape because their stance on account sharing is that they won’t take action unless it’s for competing in the high scores. Since so many people have 99’s that’s it’s impossible to reach front page or whatever, so it’s non competitive.

Ok let's look at cerb and gorillas. For cerb the chase drop is the prim crystal, for gorillas its zanyte, for Hydra it's the claw
---
The claw is just an extra goody, in this case the cost of the gloves isn't the price but the reqs. Not something anyone could buy and use, which is a good thing.

The data is correct, it's the way it's presented that's wrong. For some reason it includes skip votes in the percentage. Which would be incredibly effortless to fix, but instead the 'shared' web team hasn't looked at the osrs page in years.

Thats madness well done. But surely 1 defence would make no difference if you have 1 hitpoint?

Sound is only useful in multi pvp so you know when you're getting piled. And perhaps on some bosses.

But overall, shit stays muted.

Thats true i cant argue that but d pick doesnt need to be made easier to get just made available elsewhere. D axe is 1/10k from todt and super unrealistic to get unless you actually grind for it. Something like this in my opinion wouldnt hurt that much

So correct me if i'm wrong but a poll needs to pass with a margin of 75% yes or higher or the changes or feature won't be implemented correct?

Axe is the way it is more because they are on the DKs table and Dks aren't hard.  Neither is killing Callisto or Vetion and surviving.  Neither is surviving at revs. You kids just need to learn to tank, antipk, and pay attention.

Honestly if you're under 30 HP the difficulty of managing your health is about the same. Definitely keep the boxes if you can avoid the temptation of opening them.

You aren't entitled to survive in the wildy. It's time to learn than, quit, or don't go out there for the gear.  Just like mage cape.  Mage cape was always meant to be dangerous and the level 1 mage cape was literally placed in 40 wild. 
---
You have to do dragon slayer as soon as possible. Unlocks the most important gear until dragon stuff, which takes a while to get anyway.
---
Starting with an inventory of 18 giant weed and 6 10kg sandstone
---
Superglass make base multiplier is 1.3. Giant seaweed multiplier is 0.15 per seaweed used.
---
Giving total glass multiplier of = (1.3+(0.15*6))  = 2.2
---
108 base glass with multiplier 2.2 = 237 glass created per cast.
---
Using spell gives 10 crafting exp per glass made thus 2.37k exp per cast.
---
Spell is 11 ticks with, lets allow 2 ticks banking, giving 13 ticks total.
---
Thus we cast 461 times/hour for 2.37k exp each giving 1.1m exp/h
---
Restaurant starter pack with all those chef's hats and beers. You could start by serving ensouled goblin brains
---
It takes a longer time to make an account and prepare it for dragon slayer because of all the quests you need.  Not to mention if you're botting those quests is greatly increases the chance for bot detection.  It really does help.
---
The emblem farming issue is a greater issue than the "75k trick" was back before free trade. 
---
Yep. That is why it is a joke, because he doesn't really fit.

---
Can we make cannonballs faster? 
---
still BiS for melee.. and I also forgot to mention another issue with limiting trade-able items: at some point there will be more Ferocious gloves in game than actually players with DS2 completed, once again the no demand will force the price down even more.. don't you see the issue here? 
---
GOBORIN SRAYAH?!?!?!

Almost 99 agil and no pet yet :(

Clue hunters don't tend to bring a full set up of weapons or armour, so I'm not sure how pkers bringing less food with magic than without is even a close analogy to a souls pve player getting invaded.

Will we see another wilderness rejuvenation this year? 
---
Daily reminder OSRS still doesn't show on my Samsung SmartFridge™
---
It's not even getting reverted. It's still being changed from how it originally was.
---
I didn’t make this post because I have issue with competing with a bot for resources, but more so because this is obviously a large scale issue that needs addressing.
---
The slayer only area safe spot sucks btw.
---
YES. I love the content+run late but the voice kills it for me
---
The system is fine, the only thing that went wrong is that you had no bank pin or 2FA. You probably showed up in a leaked database, or use the same pass as your email/another account or something along those lines. Live and ya learn. It sucks but it's the best way to learn
---
I'll finish my task then ;)

Not a re-run, but can we get CC ranks to show up next to people's names on mobile?

Failed a poll was their thoughts

She gots a suspiciously large bulge

That’s why I hooked him up with more.  Unreal people think a player will last longer  having to pick up big bones and cow hides for hours on end go get a decent pair of armor.  Meanwhile being surrounded by bots doing it 100% more efficiently.       This isn’t 2004.    In 2019 people quit games for not making progress.     The first noob I helped. Was Casting on the caged lesser demon And Is now one of my best friends on there and has 1600 total level.       If they didn’t want any kind of help or way for others to help.  They would make an iron man.    These new players arnt swampletics. 
---
I believe it is from RuneLite, it has a tab for loot that you can reset and it keeps track of all drops from things you kill. 
---
why shouldn't BiS gear be buyable if you can afford to buy it? As a normal player you spend hours and hours making money so at the end of the day it's same as questing - unless you buy bonds but that's an issue created by jagex which can't be fixed. 
---
Well one of you is blowing smoke up someone's ass.  Is it 2x the gp/xp or 1.2x because that's a pretty huge fucking difference.

You can't light a fire here.

---
You got 70 mining and 99 fishing f2p? The fuck
---
One less backspace. Also makes it so instead of being happy 19 times, you get extra happy just once. There are way more pros then cons, but it does have cons.
---
How is that fun? That's like the most basic 'just being a cunt' behaviour with extra obnoxiousness, without a hint of creativity. 
---
I mean are you actually saying you would expect people to find it funny if you did this? 
---
Ironman btw
---
Yes, the Ironman community is getting soft as fuck
---
Wait you got 90 fishing and you don’t have enough cash for a bond?
---
Bro. Get with the times. No finger fucking before marriage.
---
Lol you tell me to calm it after you posted like 9 emojis, get a grip son.
---
It wasn't at all ugly. It looked like something out of fucking Runescape. 
---
Ok
---
agreed. he the type to rat on his own boys. 
---
What's the problem? I use a bludgeon there and without the fremennik shield I get kinda destroyed while praying range. I don't always have to bank but if I'm unlucky then absolutely. I can't think of a single other task where I need to bank due to food.

You don't actually think that pvpers just stop playing every 2 weeks right?

Gloves and boots now need to be equipped individually to infuriate tri-bridders
---
Erm, most pkers (who deep wildy pk) DO need to pvm/skill to pk effectively, agility shortcuts in wildy and wildy diary and quest requirements (albeit not super high ones) for ancients and royal seed pod/etc, as well as making money through pvm unless youre very good at risk fights or something
---
You can safespot the boss with a dark bow or something with similar range
---
No fucking clue tbh
---
So isn’t that more of an oversight than a glitch?
---
People fish together (going for 99, I did it with at least 6 friends) or pickpocket off the same thing together (did that with 3 friends) or whatever. Wintertodt exists as well. There's also bankstanding skills you can do together, like herblore or fletching or whatever else.

Apologize to the community for getting our hopes up /s

Just a note, it doesn't count skips.  75% of the yes or no votes need to be yes for it to pass.  So in other words, yes votes need to be at least 3x no votes to pass.

Let me wear 10 gold rings then

What is your mage level/def level? If it's high enough you could consider just killing rex.
---
RuneBurgers
---
Find the guy who cant eat right and only fight him.
---
What is bankstanding?
---
And what's wintertodt?
---
Yes, but higher reduction means you can carry heavier stuff. If you're just wearing the cape, the extra negative won't matter, but if you are carrying a bunch of Ores or such, it will.
---
Wish it was a feature. 
---
*holds up spork*
---
Can we poll noted hydra bones for a cost of 100 Brimstone Keys? Gives people more of a reason to do konar.
---
love dragon tasks. so it might just be a snatch then :)
---
Lol, any experience developing is still experience. Unless you don't use basic CS concepts &amp; data structures, then that's not an argument. Also I know the client engine is workable because I've worked on several de-compiled clients which is several hundred times harder to work with compared to the original source because of obfuscation and lack of documentation / domain specific information.
---
Honestly new to the game and not trying to meme. 
---
How can 3rd party clients have new features added very frequently but the official client does not? I only use the official client and I really wish they would provide consistent updates. 
---
It just means le gnome kek

Can all the color dyes be added to Herblore?it’s so weird that our character can mix ingredients to make potions with incredible effects. but they can’t dye something a different color without the help of an npc?

Presenting.... THE DEVOUT SHOE!

Just to play devil's advocate, changing this would be a serious buff. Could put shorter obstacles than trees there or move the ring further away to compensate though

If you think Ezscape is removing 2 seconds of time, you're dumb.

Hate to say it but you chose to limit yourself here, otherwise you can get that sweet sweet GP doing nothing at all.

Dr downtown here.  are you ready to go to pound town?
---
Make all PvP content optional.

agility pyramid and wintertodt
---
Suggestion: pee in this guy’s cereal
---
It seems like we’re in agreement then. I have nothing against PvP but I hate when one aspect of the game is marginalized against another, whether it’s PvP, PvM, or skilling.
---
I also agree PvP is much more varied. Whenever you have a human opponent instead of an AI, it’s bound to have higher skill ceilings. However, that doesn’t mean all PvM is easy either
---
Woah there
---
yes

Not how google works

As soon as people crash me I bring the other account with base 90 combat with full dharok, piety and super combat to join the party

&gt;aren't designed to go check for players Woodcutting in obscure locations or such; they are meant for PvP. 
---
are you saying looking for [killing] people who are skilling in an area where it possible to kill other people, is not pvp?
---
and also, don't you think the competition would be far greater on those worlds among the skillers since there's only a few pvp worlds compared to regular worlds? literally entices you to compete for resources by killing others.
---
the only features where carrying a LB into should be blocked, should be instanced areas and bosses.
---
When does the cocked go joke come up?
---
It is relevant. If you're in risk these days most of your time is spent trying to keep your hp high because of such high damaging items.
---
And magic damage has everything to do with it considering you can barrage ags maul. And stack them all a tick apart. 
---
Runelite good. Botting bad. 
---
I actually really find this feature useful for more than just finding someone in a crowd.

HURRAY!

As already suggested, you could probably reach rates of 300-400k/hr starting with just 74 ranged chinning at manical monkeys.

you don’t dislike pkers if you’re this new, you’re just following the reddit hive mind lol

They're the only thing post max/max gear that are rewarding. Unless you find 200ms rewarding.

Thank you to all of those who helped! My email hasn’t been compromised (pwned) according to haveibeenpwned.com and the emails I received are from Jagex and redirect me to their actual website. It seems that someone just got my email and tried to recover my account.

Osrs is the biggest we've ever seen. As someone who's been playing for over 10 years, everyday someone says "This game is dying" and every update "kills PvP" 
---
You dont stick your spare change in your pocket when you buy something?
---
I don't think it should be a thing. Knowing where/when to click is a skill gap that many actually enjoy as a challenge. It may help the below-average joe click easier, but for normal people it takes away the progress of becoming better at the game. And yes, clicking more accurately is something you get better at and is actually important to game balance. Tell any RTS player that making things massive to click on isn't making something easier.
---
fuck u you're a bit late
---
No we didn't. They're just moving the Draynor Dock issue to Rimmington. It is completely unnecessary for Jagex to move the Corsair's ship to Rimmington.
---
It doubles every seven levels, so you’re gonna be getting the exp + a little more of what you already have to get to 80

Also repoll hidden polls when voting. Reword it better.

As others already said, RuneLite friend finder only shows people that have you added too, for exact same reason you mentioned in your post (e.g to prevent people to just harras or target other people by abusing the friend system).
---
If you see someone with client that is showing also people who are not friends with person using the client, then that is custom modification of RuneLite, e.g it's not RuneLite.
---
who?
---
I'd happily trade in my 10 Zulrah uniques for the pet, it's because uniques are earnable with money and pets are untradeable.
---
these are the kind of things you should check out the wiki for: os.rs.wiki 
---
Look up every word you don’t understand while you play and your knowledge will grow. It’s a great way to become a knowledgeable player. Don’t just constantly ask, people will start to ignore the questions.

I've been getting a lot of drakes, wyverns, and such and it has worked out well for me.

What about my belly ring, nipple rings, and Prince Albert???
---
Just start with doing quests and figure out what you want from there. It took me a while of being overwhelmed, but when I got a sense of reasonable goals for my level, working towards them got a lot easier. Waterfall quest is a good one to start with
---
I'm currently in the middle of the 2 week trial they recently gave as a Twitch Prime benefit, and afterwards I have 2 bonds banked purely on f2p cash (mining iron and low-stakes flipping are my biggest money-makers in f2p).
---
Um
---
True...
---
20 minutes is pretty standard across minigames.
---
Why stop there, I want to wear one glove like Michael Jackson

Basically the world map consists of map chunks which are 64 x 64 tiles [(here is a nice example.)](http://i.imgur.com/opmAfho.jpg)

He starts in the Lumbridge map chunk and must basically complete all available content in that chunk to move to the adjacent next chunk, which is picked at random. For instance he trained to 60 WC to chop the yew tree found in Lumbridge graveyard before advancing.

On a serious note, has jagex ever responded or talked about hiding poll results while the poll is open?

*You don’t stick 2hrs+ of work in your pocket when you are questing in a prison in the middle of the desert? FTFY.

i did it with much lower combat stats and muchhhh worse gear, and it wasn't bad

Orrrrr just train your agility and you'd naturally gain more recolors?
---
so it’s getting more popular? that’s sweet, but i guess i should clarify that i understand PKing to be “exclusive” i guess; the PKers have such high stars and so much experience that why bother fight them if there’s no easy way in? 
---
lololl seriously. Just started this grind myself

Get the +1 for wearing the correct set.

Bryophytas staff buff ? Could be an imbue item dropped by hespori

I knew the masturbation joke was coming, but really I'm sure we all experience it, leaning back in your chair, resting your head on your left hand, etc.
---
I don't sit super upright with my hands on the home row when I'm relaxing watching a movie and doing some agility. If I'm playing Dota or an fps or something, then yeah, but that demands a lot more attention than clicking around in circles for hundreds of hours.
---
And to expand on my above comment: 
---
Runecrafting is an annoying mix of being nearly as mindless as agility, but harder to watch content (especially anything with subtitles) for one, because of needing hyper fast and accurate clicks when banking and filling pouches (Esp at zmi), as well as being an annoying mix of afk for a little bit (running to altar) then full attention and both hands for just a couple seconds and then back to afk.
---
Its harder to get into a rhythm with rc as well because of the constant fluxes in attention, which is why I think a lot of people don't like the skill (also the obvious repetitiveness and horrible xp rates) over other skills that are just as monotonous like fishing or wc.
---
People like skills that are either 10% or 100%. Pking and bossing are fun because they take your entire attention and are fun to play, skills like wcare nearly entirely afk (ignoring tick manip) and you can just chill while doing them, same with how everyone loves Slayer. Runecrafting is neither of these. The lulls aren't long enough to focus on anything else and the intensity of clicks you need for constant xp is annoying (zmi, lavas and banking at abyss) 
---
You can do that already lol.
---
Plz no guaranteed drops to cater for ironmen
---
F
---
If you PK, keep it in a PVP world and leave us PVMers alone 
---
PvP Worlds were meant for fighting PvPers, not to entice Skillers to go into a PvP Zone for added benefit so PvPers could kill them; that is what the Wilderness does. We don't need to turn PvP Worlds into a second Wilderness. Not all PvP Zones need to be useful for non-PvPers.
---
The worlds would be crowded and competitive, but that doesn't mean it should be a thing. I fully expect that is this is added, there will be some exploitative use for insane exp or profit or something. Also, it seems silly to allow everything but bosses. I'd say just require a PvP Kill to use the Looting Bag since that is the point of the worlds...
---
I kinda dont enjoy filling buckets for hours.
---
I thibk he means equivalent in terms of power
---
F2P teleblock for sure, and make ring of forging available in f2p through enchanting jewelry instead of using an npc
---
Fuck me, thinking about doing this f2p makes my brain hurt.
---
Congrats on not killing yourself I guess?
---
Its not that hard to get them. I have 6 colored sets on my acc w 90agil
---
Interesting idea!
---
Just fill it up my g or ask for some kind of item to imbue it 
---
LOL it isn't a "haslte." It's a 30 second run. It is already super overpowered as it is, man. A simple diary requirement to get unlimited teleports pretty much directly to a fairy ring when the next closest thing is a quest cape to Edgville teleport or poh fairy ring is absurd as it is. Clicking on the minimap to move is a thing.
---
I dont think anyone who isnt already familiar with osrs PvP will enjoy it.

Deadman tourneys get huge viewership when they stream and huge turnout when they go live.

PvP seems fine, and it's not going to die just because they don't get buffs and updates that benefit a new hybrid pure build all the time.

Right that makes sense. Thanks for the reply!

There is an old mmo from around the same time when rs was created that is called The 4th Coming. There you actually do talk this way to every npc and they understand your messages by the keywords that are in your message.

Dragonfire shield gives negative range anyways, not the best option even if you have the level.

That makes sense. I'm still very much on the stat / gear grind so I'm not overly bothered about cosmetics or fashionscape

I'm entitled to my vote of removing PVM from wild. We don't want to go pvming there in the first place brainlet.

Probably Andrew Gower.
---
Banking bones on Karuulm is a huge pain in the ass, especially Drake/Hydra bones. Their drops are more valuable so the bones get either crushed, buried, or left on the floor.
---
Please no, NA ping is incredibly shit for UK players. Either two worlds, or keep the rota.
---
It's only useful when all the fishing spots on the other side of the river too, which I don't think I ever saw during my time there. Even if it does happen, it's faster to world hop. So we're talking an elite rewards which saves ~5-10 seconds for an incredibly rare event.

That's fine vote how you want. That and your reasoning are still toxic.  Take it up with jamflex then.  You choose to go pvming in there.  Stick to something basic like gargoyles dipshit.

Yea agreed, I miss the old days of 1500+ players per world, one person per monster, packed resources area, competing for shit, nowadays everyone just whines about efficiency and forgot to have fun. 
---
Yeah technically they didn't break rules which is why I don't think they should get any bans, just have their sandstone removed/reduced to an amount they would've gotten from actually mining it in the Quarry
---
Would increase the value of my sneaker collecting ironmeme
---
I had the same issue for the longest time.  I started to BP snaklings as I moved from phase-to-phase which saves me about 1-2 food per kill.
---
I know this was just polled and passed. But most people *didn't seem happy* with the little **Prayer XP** that the Boss Heads will now offer at the Dark Altar.
---
As an extra option I suggest that, at Slayer Masters, we should be able to exchange our spare Boss Heads too, but for a task of the same kind of the head, though it'd be a "half-sized" task to prevent this mechanic from being too powerful. This means that you would get the corresponding task, but the amount assigned would only be half of what you'd normally get. E.g.: 1 Vorkath's Head &gt; 1 free halved Blue Dragon task. Meaning that, if you'd normally get assigned about 150 Blue Dragons, with this exchange you'd get about 75. If you happen to have a block on the task you're eligible for, the action would be cancelled.
---
Well big pvp updates will never be unpolled and pvp should be pker vs pker not pvmer vs pkers one sided fights shouldnt be a thing and farm the wild freely? Most of the money makers in the wild arent even better than non wild money makers. Its the uniques that make people mad. 
---
It's downvoted cuz he didn't read the title
---
I'm doing my part :)
---
I don't see how it isn't? I get 1v1 fights in edge, I get 1v1 fights in pvp worlds, I kill people all over the wildy on my main and pures, and have no problem killing wildy pvm content on my main.  All i see is constant whiny bitching you from kids who can't antipk or get away. Instead you guys are asking for and voting for stuff like remembering spells which will only make you worse at the game and in turn die more often in the wild. 
---
I know this was just polled and passed. But most people didn't seem happy with the little **Prayer XP** that the Boss Heads will now offer at the Dark Altar.

Can you light a fire next to your fishing spot and use raw fish on it to create tick manipulation?
---
So I'm trying to get to 77, I'm like halfway through 75... Runelite is telling me I still need to make 20,000 death runes before 77...   
---
I'm slowly dying in my mind right now... gonna take a break. 
---
What do you mean? There are days when every world has almost 1k players.
---
Do you not think that maybe some people would be totally okay taking that rebalanced gp hit if that meant moving the pvm stuff out of the wildy? I think that opinion is pretty reasonable tbh. I'm pretty sure adding dragon pickaxe drops to a nonwildy boss with a lower droprate is something that a lot of people would love.
---
It's a blank vote, like you saying "I don't have a position about this, I'll agree with both possible results."
---
Grotesque Guardians. This boss is cool and unique but not fun in the slightest to kill (in my opinion). The main reason for that is the amount of down time in each fight.
---
Could we please get to do SOMETHING in the transitional phase where they are spawning "energy" on the ground? It could be something like halved damage like with vorkath. You would still have to avoid the energy but it would slightly speed it up and would make it a nice optional mechanic.
---
The orbs you have to get to stop the healing are also annoying. Once again the idea it self is not bad but considering you take more damage the longer it takes to get to them, they are spread unfairly. Even if you have to be tick perfect you should be able to collect all 3 with time to only take 5 damage from each. It'd also be nice to be more easy to click on when spawning under the boss.
---
I don't mind the gp/hr or xp/hr of the boss. I don't think everything has to be better than the next. I just don't like the downtime where you do nothing but walk around a bit on a boss you have to kill back to back.
---
There's 3 unique Elite Clue Scroll rewards that the Treasure Trail Chest should hold but currently doesn't. Please add storage for the stuff that's missing (**Gilded Scimitar, Gilded Boots &amp; 3rd Age Cloak**). The Rangers' Tunic *used* to be missing but was eventually added, however the other 3 items, stated above, seem to remain overlooked.

Sometimes i'll have to hop 5, 6, or more times to get a spot for my slayer
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** General_Iroh1! ^(hug)
---
It’s part of the game mode.  If you don’t like it, don’t play it.
---
This is what turns me off pking. People are geared up to easily kill me 1v1 but even then you always have clans pking together making things even harder for you to pl when its 5v1
---
Alright sorry ill just forget about it and just let things be ill join my friends clan and just vote no to everything like 60% of the other players are doing 
---
Could you perhaps spend a month reworking/reviving some mini games like LMS, Trouble brewing, Fishing Trawler?
---
We can see that the Boss section of the 'Collection Log' is ordered alphabetically. Can the Bosses of the *Boss Log* also be ordered alphabetically?
---
Revs are good gp/hr and callisto/vetion/venatitis are decent as well especially if you duo. I've never had issues doing either and I also pk. If it's in the wild it doesn't matter all pvp is pvp.  
---
It's not incorrect, it's just the data of all of the players who responded to the poll. The ingame poll doesn't take into considerations all players. The website data is more general info. The website takes the percentages of every response out of 100%. The in game forgoes the inclusion of "skips" and the percentage represented is out of those who either voted yes or no. It isn't wrong.
---
Once you finally get membs, feel free to reach out.  Add 321belowzero and I can help ya acclimatize a bit. Good luck. :)

Can you allow us to combine each hood with its corresponding cape and receive a "hooded cape" version of that combo? Would also need to make these versions compatible with the Cape Hanger and Cape Rack in the POH.
---
Bro. Look at his skills. He knows a thing or two about bonds. His gathering skills aren't near high enough to pay for his other skills.
---
The miscellania one seems a bit OP especially for ironmen.
---
I get you'd need a lot of money for it but you could have 50 free days with no resource loss with your changes.
---
I agree about the XP point though
---
I got a trio tbow split at 9kc my rng is gone
---
I just stuck with the Training Sword, it's perfectly adequate for 90% of situations but if you want to waste money for a few extra bonus that's your call. 
---
And it would go the way of harpoon or axe and basically be worthless. 
---
God, Allah, 'the Maker', Shiva, also Shakti, Odin, or 'Wotan', whatever you want to name it. 
---
I believe he is referring to the genie lamp random. Still, OP could have put some basic effort into the meme. 
---
Filling up the Ectophial makes sense though. You pour the bottle and it teleport you, so makes sense to have to refill it. 
---
I would be down if they added some kind of way to imbue it, similar to bottom compost bucket.
---
Yes, do it
---
Dont go to the wilderness then.
---
Should we just make bosses instanced? And then reduce world count to create a better "vibe"?
---
And them being good gp/hr is fine and so is the risk its the uniques that makes it stupid i can honestly say revs was a great update
---
What would be a good setup for range training?
---
why did u stop
---
I mean idk how stable it is. If I can just buy it, use it and sell it for nearly the same amount then why not? I'll try the training sword for now.
---
Dozens! 
---
With the bank space limitation, why would you save 6 colored sets?
---
Where do you draw the line between poor UI that hasn't kept up with current technology, and skill? Would a single pixel spell that was almost impossible to click accurately be a high skill technique? Should new spells scale on their icon size, with higher level spells being more powerful while having smaller icons? Coordination, resource management, timing, and game knowledge are tested in content like inferno, raids, and PvP combat. Poor UI designed for old hardware is not a test of skill.

&gt; @DimOSRS @DeadBotting I’m not sure on the system side of things. It may be worth asking potentially in the next Q&amp;A stream or even asking someone from the support/moderation team. It could be both the FL side of things and moderation related for offensive names, RWTers, scammers, etc.

It's far far cheaper than the rapier etc setup and it's better xp/hr than DH if you have less than ~90 strength and hp. I tried DH with 92 str and 91hp and was getting around 3k more xp/hr than my obsidian setup.

Please no

I feel it is important to get the percentages of all participants, even if they chose to skip the question. Is still does not change the fact that out of every player who viewed the poll, only 73% of those wanted it for sure, and 14% didn't want it. If you ask me, it would be silly if they only showed the percentage based on yes or no answers only. I find it mind boggling how people don't see the value of this information or the reasoning behind it.
---
"It only takes 30,000 goblins bro"
---
It's the uniques that give it decent gp/hr.  I've done 100 Vetion kills and only gotten pked once in the past couple days.  Gotten a D pick too. The other time I almost got pked I got away. I bring black d'hide or freezes and freeze them back, stand under, and log.  
---
That is the biggest issues.  You guys don't know mechanics or realize how easy it is to get away especially with dhide and prayer. 
---
Oh RIP. 
---

---
You would still have to constantly collect soda ash/seaweed for proper Crafting, so what's the point?
---
Who hurt *you* that you seriously don't grasp that petty obnoxiousness disruption isn't generally going to be well received?

I can't imagine losing hundreds of hours of playtime from something like this. I hope Jagex fixes that for you. Good luck

theoretically... couldn’t we also wear more than one amulet?

Okay i’m sorry I said anything, relax! Am I not allowed to have an opinion? If someone did this to me I would laugh. i don’t give a shit if no one else would! Okay!?

s
---
It's a good point, I just mean they aren't needed to progress your account. But I totally understand wanting to do clues, and I feel like going into the wildy every now and then just adds to the feeling of reward for otherwise basically free gold. Just my opinion
---
Im a newer member so my Combat is only 54, is that enough?
---
Until a clan jumps you and there is literally nothing you can do
---
Absolute minimums are 75/75 for range/magic when learning.  However, since you've never done it before, I recommend getting as close to 85/85+ as possible.  It would save you a lot of frustration while learning to kill Zulrah from having the faster potential kill times.
---
Modern medicine really was a mistake
---
I agree. It's literally so hard to find someone in deep wild. I gotta hit login limit twice before I find a decent fight. Then I repeat the whole process to find another one after. It's so stupid. 
---
Not anymore. If you don't like it, don't play it. 
---
What the fuck is that music this isn't 2006
---
Keep doing that. That's toxic and spite voting. It only makes matters worse and ensures all pvpers will kill any pvmer.  I mean it is the original place to pvp and you snowflakes can't seem to get past that. 
---
Idiot, look at what I said 
---
Dude wtf are you on about? Fastest thieving xp in the game and a 7mm+ drop that is used in an end-game construction improvement... Buffing this minigame would be as dumb as buffing slayer by adding a new master with a broken drop table! On second thought this will probably be implemented.
---
Instances are bad for the economy and also kinda defeat the purpose of a mmo. Competing for resources is part of playing a mmo
---
I see what you said. You said like a little crier.
---
I think my issue with Pking is that to be on even ground with a pker account, you have to build a pure yourself and it drastically limits what I can do as a player in non wildy content. 
---
I pk every single day. Pking is not dead at all. I highly suggest you make a maxed main first to pk on and fund the rest of your accounts. 
---
pay attention and dip beforehand, fight back, or die.  It isn't unbalanced. If you are banking regularly then you won't lose shit.  The most I lose is 1k ether on the mace. It's pretty negligible when you consider my profit.  
---
I mean, I'm all for that. Like I said, locking it behind the diary would make sense. 
---
Bankstanding is kind of what it sounds like - standing at the bank (while doing a skill, in this case). Typically, people just buy the supplies for herblore/fletching/crafting/so on, and do it at a bank or the Grand Exchange to sell the items/buy new supplies.
---
Wintertodt is a skilling boss for firemaking and very minorly fletching/woodcutting/construction, and gives supplies for other skills like seeds or raw fish.
---
Like u/Tree_Houses said, the wiki will help a TON for things like this. So go to the site "os.rs.wiki" and explore to your heart's content to figure some stuff out, or just ignore this and go in as blind as possible and explore.
---
Thieving, cooking, fishing, fletching, crafting, mining all have super afk methods
---
Ahahaha
---
Remove all skills that aren't runecrafting
---
But seriously, some ultra late game content seems like would be fun to aim towards or even watch streamers do. Right now we have inferno (kinda late game?), tob and max cape, two out of three being pvm focused
---
Max guild, flesh out levels 85+ of most skills, some ultra high req quests... It'd be nice to see
---
Plant mith flowers till you pick a black one. Black/white are rarer than other flowers so u may have to plant a bunch 
---
Holy shit that emoji is pure cancer

Damn. I was 540 dry then a stranger danced for luck and that gorilla dropped me it :) 
---
Nothing as of right now. Engine team is working on mobile.
---
Part of the ezscape. I don't agree with the current death mechanic either. 
---
Stop risking so much stuff then. Losing your stuff on the death is one of the most iconic things about runescape. 
---
A good goal to get would be 70 Crafting for MM2. Could do that cheaply through blowing molten glass. Pretty afk, and pretty good xp/hr. 
---
NMZ for combats is solid as well
---
With so many new seeds being added to the game, pickpocketing master farmers has received an indirect nerf due to inventories filling up faster. Can we make it so if you pickpocket while having the tithe farm seed box in your inventory, seeds can go directly into your seed box effectively giving us 5 more inventory slots
---
ONE CHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNK

Only reason I asked was because even though the Serp helm buff passed even though it was only polled with a 72.9% vote to yes.
---
Why did you convert your total level to 1.17k..1170 is exactly the same amount of characters
---
Overreacting? Calling people disabled? Yep, they play the Runey

I bet you hate Tom Brady too, hate on greatness while you cheer on a soft qb who chucks the ball to the sidelines every play unless it’s a perfect touchdown pass 
---
65,70,72,75,80 are all good unlocks for monsters that profit.
---
I can tell you haven’t done much high level content. Most bosses, even most high level slayer tasks you have to hop a few times to find an open world. They simply need the worlds. And I doubt that most of them have less than 200.... maybe in the morning in the UK, but I hardly ever see the 2k worlds with less than 200 people let alone the normal worlds. 
---
They don't have a greater variant
---
Its also one of the most hated things now with more and more new players also hating it
---
&gt; tear it down
---
??? I never said that? I just think modern art can't be considered art.
---
Birdhouses for hunter, some cooking and Wintertodt for FMing and WC xp should get you there fairly quick.
---
Stick to runescape man. Cause you sound dumb talking sports 
---
They pk pkers when they finally find one after stalking pvmers
---
Good point
---
fuck

Practice makes perfect, GL!
---

Of course they do because it isn't ezscape.

Lederhosen hat was the best times. RIP
---
I almost only play on mobile and mine shows? I have a Moto z2 force.
---
It was just a quick flip. Like 2 minutes for 11k. 
---
False. They pk everyone. Often focusing on the pker first because he is a threat and potentially has more loot. 
---
That's not a rune pouch though. . . 
---
Loving the obby cape 😉
---
I have 80 fishing and got three noted mackerel during a Konar task. The trolls south of the mountain. 
---
Sure. Why not. Give the POH SOME kind of useful tele. Right now, it's got Edgeville, Lunar Isle, and Canafis, and that...is...it until level 85 construction where you get a fairy ring like 2s closer than the one at necklace of passage.
---
I’ll take you extra cash

6ix9ine snitching on everyone

---
No rebuttal to my comments on them yet I sound dumb lol. 
---
This or runecrafting, what do you choose? 
---
Got a feeling that the community is holding too much on to sentiment...
---
Yes, but the problem is that the cape is getting increasingly difficult to get, while the reward stays quite mediocre. PoH fairy ring is much better than a quest cape. Not to mention the diary tasks that require the Quest Cape emotes.
---
i like that idea man, monster weak to weapon types
---
So have a sook in the corner
---
YES
---
The more i read ur replies. You dont actually care about the pvp state. You are just butthurt about dieing to callisto once. Lul
---
Its mind boggling that you believe an abstained vote should count as a no. By your logic we should also include everyone that did not vote in the poll as a no vote as well.
---
"Peak" is a bit strong, but kinda, yeah.
---
Also, memes are the folklore of our time. It sounds retarded now, but I don't doubt for a second that a couple of centuries down the line there will be university professors specializing in researching and analyzing the memes of early 21st century

Yes. If you want to calculate it based on website results, just need a bit of math. yesVotes/(yesVotes+noVotes), so in this case, 35359/(35359+6978), or 35359/42337, which is 83.5%, which you can see matches what shows in game.

Fair point your name might be the most crucial aspect and they'll need a lot of stuff beside it but posting history is public, so if someone keeps dropping breadcrumbs with posts like this eventually they might get enough info.
---
It's not about the ironman not getting the loot it's about getting PKed by an iron have a consequence.
---
I appreciate the effort but since there's no way to confirm that someone is "mobile only" there's really no achievement for playing on a device exclusively
---
I did care until all i get is negative pkers trashing on pvmers saying the same thing over and over “get good” “anti pk” “dont go into the wild” and those replies have obviously done so much for the pk community in the last few updates. I made this to discuss possible fixes to the hate between both groups but all i get is toxicity its why the pvp community is so hated. But whatever i give up ill just keep on and enjoy my frequent quarterly pvm updates.

A RANKING SYSTEM???????
---
You play vs your rank just like in mobas and slowly learn. Yes there will be good players on low ranked accounts but they can counteract that by making high ranks actually rewarding.
---
Theres a lot of possibility its been mentioned before the hard part would be matchmaking. B0aty said he'd come back to pking if it happened and quite frankly if one of the biggest streamers switches over it could mean a lot for the community.
---
I check the guides for items needed (beforehand, not obtained during quest) and give it my best.
---
Besides Watchtower Quest, fuck that outdated quest with horrible directions.
---
No it wasn’t already back in the game? It was a shitty half assed version? Are you seriously calling ehp the same as pking? Are you seriously calling the trade limit the same as free trade? Are you seriously calling duel tourneys the same as staking? The game had 200-250k active players and NEVER reached that point again after the removal of the big three. After that point anything else is just a dying game dying. Eoc? Mtx? Who gives a fuck about the 50k players still playing around that period? The game was a fraction of its former self.
---
 A shame you’re too much of a newfag to remember the glory days.
---
Because polling bias?
---
Sailing got 68% and was highly criticized. Warding is way more fleshed out even at this stage and it will only get more detailed the closer it gets to the poll. Also more people seen to like polling over Sailing, I have no doubt that last 7% will vote yes.
---
Also Jagex is going all in on warding, I honestly think they will keep reworking it until it passes, should it fail.
---
Probably failed due to polling bias
---
Yeah ive died 3 times now and it's always because I get nervous and mis click.  I just really don't wanna have to go through the whole thing again lol.
---
Can we get the stamina potion timer to stack. Like can I drink an entire stamina potion and have it go for 8 minutes?
---
Con, cooking, and smithing is quick. You could also afk your melee stats or alch or burst some magic. 
---
I think this is the real problem. Players say "Please hide the poll results" and Jagex says
---
&gt; it is something they want to address but changing the poll system is not something they are going to rush out and it needs more time and thought than just hide results and call it fixed.
---
It's literally not more complicated than hiding the results until after the polling finishes. The only response I've ever seen as a counter is that third party clients could still tell you what the answers are, which is a non-issue since they can just ban those plugins like they've done several others, and also that the vast majority of players won't have a reason or known desire to look up the answers beforehand anyway.
---
No, no, no. You have it backwards. Only 14% didn't want it for sure, and 73% did want it. Meaning that 13% are alright with it, but couldn't be bothered to vote no. So really 86% want it in the game! ^^^/s
---
No 
---
Record profits, higher player numbers than ever before, lots of content updates for me, and the OSRS team is growing.
---
I sleep soundly knowing the content I enjoy is actually enjoyed by people, unlike PKing.
---
What are the consequences lmfao? Thats the dumbest thing ive heard to date. Get PK'd by a regular person, you lose your items. Get PK'd by an ironman, your items are gone to looters. Either way your items are gone. 
---
Ironmeme isnt a special mode where it punishes other players. Its supposed to only punish *you*. 
---
Get a normal account if you want to PK. But you get an advantage from being an Ironman in PK because you get no HP exp so you can keep your levels low. 
---
do you recommend F2P or Members low level PK for learning?
---
Nah. Gathering skills are afk braindead gameplay that require no gear or skill at all. 
---
Your right the only reason I didn’t sell it was because I saw the ge graph and saw the price going up ridiculously so I thought I’d keep it for raids since I won’t be able to afford it again if it keeps going up 
---
You are an impressive specimen.

I don't understand your comment. Most items don't have the same street price as GE price.

So that people will continue to afk like they are now?

Key update sucks idk why people voted an additional step to get their loot
---
Can we make it so that if you have an empty pot in your inventory, the bonecrusher will make bonemeal instead of burying bones?
---
Also, can the process of worshipping the Ectofuntus be automated? It would still be slower than manually clicking.
---
Can we look at the icons for the teleport spells. Currently the symbol in the middle is very tiny and difficult to distinguish which icon will teleport you to your desired location. Currently it is a double ring with a small symbol inside. Perhaps make it a single ring to increase symbols size

---
I'm not saying the current mechanics are sensible or shouldn't be fixed, but just as an FYI:
---
If you're using more than 1 wine per game you're doing it wrong. 
---
From 90-97 firemaking (my current level) I brought 2 wines to Wintertodt and drank one *once* during those 7 levels, and it was because I wasn't paying attention. I suppose a notable detail is that I was using a PoH pool between each run.
---
Most people don't seem to know that if you stand on the far south wall (when in the south-west and south-east) while cutting the roots, you won't get hit by snowstorms. Have redemption up and you'll be good. If you start getting low on health, watch the brazier for storms that break it - when those appear, step back one space. 
---
I don't think your reading comprehension up to par. Nowhere do I claim you don't know how to pk.  I am staying the simple fact that if you want more people pking, you need to entice new people to join by lowering the barrier to entry by some combination of making learning easier via tutorials or practice missions (just an idea) or lowering the skill ceiling by addressing some balance issues such as g-maul stacking.
---
You are out of touch with the situation of why PvP is dwindling and how to address it and not with the actual act of pking.
---
You can't tell me you think someone new to PvP gives a damn about a looting bag they likely won't fill or if they have a slightly higher ping. It's just an absurd notion.
---

why on earth would reddit, a forum with a clear upvoting system to get your posts seen, want to hide poll results? I just don't get it
---
If you read my post correctly i mentioned having a activity meter.
---
I guess it does give a bit of thrill going into the wildy but the toxic community of PKers is just overwhelming. The people who just sit there and wait for someone to come along so they can ice barrage while saying “sit”. Like what’s the point? Does it really give you such a dopamine rush to do that? I guess I just don’t understand why they do that. 
---
Some people cba to master flicking against 3 at the same time.. even 2. Justiciar alows to easy mode inferno in about 4-5 hours. It's either that or wasting 50+ hours on failed runs until you master flicking with dps only gear + flicks.
---
If we start using “nechs” in a derogatory manner, add it to UD and start complaining on the forums about how racist Jamflux is they’ll have no choice but to change it. But to what? Then we start seeding the name change once turmoil has been established. 
---
We make alt accounts to post on reddit and forums (make sure to **not**  upvote your own content or post links asking for upvotes and always use the np.reddit prefix. This has to be a calculated strike but is totally doable. 
---
I’ll start, fuck all you pussy ass nechas
---
Your so fucking stupid it hurts. 
---
So nobody is using the “that’s how it’s always been justification” huh? What about rune rocks you fucking retard? The original source of rune in the game circa fucking 2004 and wanna know where they put it? The fucking wilderness. What about kbd you fucking retard? The main highest pvm challenge in the game that at the time dropped the bis headgear and lo and behold the only way to get there? Through the fucking wilderness. 
---
The argument has been there before you have even created your fucking rs account, you’re just too much of a newfag to see it. It has always been risk vs reward since runescape was made, it’s just as of the last 5 years it’s been no risk and all reward. That’s how I know your a newfag, that’s all you are used to. 
---
Yea your right! Like the risk of 100k you risk every time you go to tob. But if you are LOOKING for REWARDING content that’s in the WILDERNESSS, you should probably expect that pvp would be accounted for in that risk vs reward equation.

120 capes when? Give max players something more to go for than just pets/collection log. 
---
Also, dungeoneering. We need it. CoX is nothing like and never will fill that itch that dg is. And to justify your blah blah op blah blah, let me remind you a blowpipe with addy darts and rigour, out damages a chaotic with turmoil and overloads.

Is it every Wednesday??

One if Runescapes

That's because Australian osrs servers are routed through Hong Kong. Not true Aus servers.

I'm combat 98 and can't even hurt him. Using Neitiznot, fury, fire cape, fighter torso, obby legs, d boots, barrows gloves and zerk ring. Swapping BGS to whip/defender, bring sara's, restores, super combats, and inventory full of karambwan/dark crabs, and I can't do anything to him. I hit him a few times, but I get hit 18-20 relentlessly until I'm out of food.

Lost my torso years ago to a DC so I'm replying the obby body/legs combo til I can afford nandos

Perdu doesn't have it by chance?

It's not just about the profit though, it's about making the skill have an actual use. 
---
An example would be zenyte jewelry. Demonic gorillas could just drop the jewelry as is, but they don't. As a result, there is a reason for people to have high crafting.

Anecdotal evidence taken from the extreme top end of pvpers is surely unbiased. Amirite?

No

Well, of course, everything is simple when you simplify it. But you say third-party clients are a non-issue because they can "just ban those plugins"... Just like how they banned those cheat clients that have come up recently? They've said it is bannable yet I've still seen tons of complaints about how they aren't banning them. So when it comes to something as important as the poll system, do you really want them to rush out a change without making sure they can follow through and without reviewing all the options and considering the consequences?
---
Either way, they have addressed the requests multiple times; you just don't like the answer. It is kinda like a kid asking for ice cream and the parent saying "when we get home", then the kid whining about how they want ice cream now the whole time out. But they have acknowledged it and they do have plans for it, so stop expecting them to do more just because you want it now.
---
Would be nice if there were time stamps - nice flip for 2min
---
Sure, but PvP is effectively locked off unless you play your account a certain way (aka-a pure) or have a secondary account.

It wasn't exactly a thought-out idea to be honest... the idea I had in mind was to do with some sort of bad luck protection but I wouldn't want to see OSRS go down the casual scummy path that WoW has gone down.

WHO DID THIS??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Nice.

Tru, for melee should prolly upgrade ring first, maybe helm

YOOOOO 😂😂😂
---
yes but they've been afk for so long, they either died within NMZ and got kicked out with their auto clicker still going, or they got disconnected and ended up like that
---
That’s what’s holding me back

See this is why I wouldn't go exploring in Chicago.

&gt;you choose the option to "withdraw all"

Of course if you manually do every piece by yourself it's not a big deal. He's saying that when you were to take everything out at once that it should prioritize armour. Learn to read before you start shitting your pants and spewing insults. Dick.

You actually play RS full screen?

Try going to dks for some money its fun if u bring a friend since ur kinda low lvl and might not be able to solo tribrid them yet.
---
I did it on a level 85 that had 76 range. I struggled with Robert the strong (he hits hard and i did not) but i found Galvek and Vorkath very doable. 
---
My deaths (maybe 2 for each dragon) were due to mechanics rather than my low stats. If you can learn those, it'll be more of a challenge of using items effectively (food,pots) due to being level 85. If you see yourself struggling and low on these, tele out and try again. 
---
If you want to try Galvek without risking paying 100k each time, go to the unrestricted worlds and fight Galvek at the myths guild pool.
---
Best of luck!

All we need is skilling raid, not a number to tell how good you wack that yew tree for hundreds of hours

What happened last week?

R/EZScape
---
Not all of us toxic folks are this toxic.. some of us are selective or... somewhat... toxic.
---
Pvmers will not vote no to pvp content that does not affect them. Every suggested pvp content so far negatively impacts them so they vote no to all of them. Jagex needs to make suggestions that does not influence non-pvpers if they want pvp content to pass. One example is a rework of LMS.
---
They nerfed birdhouses. What else can they do? Toadflax seeds are low tier and rightfully common. Whats your suggestion?
---
Smoke devil dungeon entrance has a right click option to turn off the smoke overlay.
---
Can we have a “last destination” on the various teleports in our POH?
---
"im not trying to tear it down! i just dont think it's good!"
---
thinkies
---
Why doesnt rs have pigs?
---
OSRS uses the supermajority; it is like normal majority but with a cape and 1.5x more. You don't see 64% yes and go "that option is winning, so I'll vote for that"; you see 36% no and go "that option is winning, so I'll vote for that". So the bias would be to vote with the winning option, not the most voted option, which is different in OSRS system.
---
Not a joke, it's a legit scam method that blew up after the video came out showing how effective it was.
---
Ahaha. What the hell. So when I’m voting in a ballot a skip counts as a no? What the hell kind of mentality is this? 
---
I just wish there were some more teles that don't get used because spellbook swapping is cancer. 
---
White wolf mountain from ancient book. Catherby  from lunar. Barrows amd fenkemstrain from arceeus. 
---
If people are ok with teletabs then why is it not ok to have it available for 100 casts worth of runes and the mage level to cast it anyway?
---
Yeah but I look soooooooo much better with Tassets :)

I support some sort of rework. The grapes/zamorak wine thing are completely not worth it
---
Scam?  Sir, if you'd like to pay me 50k for 13 trout, that's a you-problem, not a me-problem.
---
Hahahaha liquor snurf 
---
Trouble brewing needs some kind of reward worth going for. The healthiest rework I could imagine would be a rework of brewing altogether to give mature ales a purpose.
---
Competitive LMS needs to get rid of its betting system. It just doesn't work well as a form of gambling when the duel arena is right next door, more straight forward, and allows you to bet unlimited amounts of cash and items.
---
Fishing trawler needs to have its game duration reduced or to have much more interactive gameplay.
---
I think any of these would require some pretty major attention if the solution is not just going to be a band-aid one.
---
It's a drop from the boss.
---
They did make supplies less common; it just didn't have a considerable impact on the long term price.
---
So I should expect all pkers to have Inferno capes, right?
---
Oh, good to know! Thanks.

Bahaha this is funny af

So you're the guy that never got invited to parties.

Ooo that might be a good place to practice, thank you!!
---
Seems like a crutch for bad raiders
---
Disagree. They shouldnt be optional. These added life to the game, even if they made things less afk. I'm a hc btw and would love to have these back in the game.
---
83 cons will cost 40m give or take. Without actually building the pools/boxes/altars
---
Please check an mensage iv send for u guys , very important 
---
Personally, I think it would be nice to see crush attacks being better against armor and slash attacks being better against leather/dhide in pvp cases. Axes can be an inbetween for slash and crush. 
---
For NPCs, different creatures - different weaknesses. I know they have that now but it isn't really relevant.
---
Going to attempt it again with 62 agility and summer pies, wish me luck

Add a “Fill” option to the Rune Pouch?
---
If there are *not* any runes in the pouch, it would fill the pouch with the first three types of runes in your inventory. 
---
If there *are* runes in the pouch, it would add the corresponding runes from your inventory to the pouch (and fill any empty slots in the pouch with the first available types of runes in your inventory). 
---
Literally in the same gear. Except ring is imbued.
---
Devalues my blue cape swampletics. 
---
Some guy at Bloodvelds of all things became so upset about sharing that he would not let up and pushed me out with max gear. Friggin' *bloodvelds.* It was funny to watch him get mad though.
---
If that's the case, some need to be put on higher tiers as well. Free infinite teleports to the Ardougne Monastery, near a fairy ring, prayer restoration area and much more being on easy is too OP.
---
Can we look at unlocking the godwars door on the south side of the dungeon? 
---
Nex was an awesome boss, mechanic wise...drops could be different though lol
---
Skilling raid is all we need for lvl 3 skillers and for end game grinders, not a separate "skill lvl" on a skill on kids game. 
---
Applies to every game these days
---
Because extra storage is against the spirit of the game mode.
---
Gifs that keep on giving lol
---
Did Jagex start this rumor themselves?
---
I really just wish people would stop posting about it tbh, it failed the poll, its fine as it is, good updates get through, bad ones fail, whats to complain about?
---
havent played osrs in a while. is there a new tab thing somewhere to track loot? or is that in your bank?

The first 2 words...

Use your range and mage prayers at the correct time while on wave 63.

I just wish armadyl armor looked better 😪 the hyra leather colors would look so cool as an armor.

Doesn't she lick donuts and hate america?

The rates are out there somewhere but I don't think its really worth. If you use RL the RC exp is okay

Do we even play the same game? lol

Not really lol 
---
75 range for a blowpipe will make it a lot easier
---
Such contrasts compared when it initially was released, people could barely manage 1 kc
---
I found the maze very relaxed and probably wouldnt have cussed out the patrolling monkeys if the map I was using wasnt obscured and showed me where the 2nd gas tank was, by no means do I think its truly difficult but patiently waiting for the right moment to do something is not a skill I have. The week of training was probably overkill to fight the boss but I did beat him with only 1 food left so who knows.
---
He’s a pro streamer, pretty darn good at the games he plays. 
---
Da faq...
---
bossing for skilling supplies is kinda aids 
---
You need more fiber my guy 
---
Stick with Obby cape or w/e you have now, cheaper and better. 
---
Trust me when I say fire cape is NOT worth it. I know a lot of people say you have to get one blah blah blah, but once you get it you will realize how big of a waste and useless it is. 
---
If you've never done it before, get 75 range or so and a bp. Practice and you're good to go.
---
Ads are based on your search results buddy.

I recently started a new ironman account after reaching pretty high level main 1600+total and have been enjoying the game so much because of it.  It makes the early game achievements feel so much better and im trying all kinds of content that I wouldn't have touched otherwise.  Agility isn't that bad, i just banged out full graceful over the course of 3 or 4 days while watching standup comedy.

Problem is no other hoods have bonuses

What's the problem? Ton of people buy gold, in fact, majority of the player base does it and Jagex has said as much. Nothing wrong with RWT and buying gold buhbuh.

is this a /r/ChoosingBeggars/ reference?

Did you try to reobtain a bag and see if the items were there? That’s an odd issue, it didn’t delete my looting bag items when I did it 2 days ago.

It's a good thing for latency to spread out the population. You tried playing on 330 world? It's a lag fest.

This kind of puts in perspective how many goblins I killed for my first 1k cash. 
---
NEXT!

And improve the system used to detect autoclickers, it shouldn't be so attractive to use cheats or botting scripts in the first place
---
ur right, Im mostly a pvmer and my switches smoother than dittershitter im surprised that he gets any respect as a pvper xd
---
Really? Thought it was against rules, in real world trading, P2W
---
Think of it more like a party crasher, they show up and try to take whatever you were doing, whether a boss or a particular group of something you're training on.
---
Burning or making poison ones? There is an option when cooking to cook poison (1) or thoroughly cook (2) u gonna want to click 2...
---
Sure, didn't mean to say nobody gets banned, just that they aren't as good as the community is led to believe.

Try turning the heat down on the stove a bit or don't leave it cooking for so long dumbo.

The teleports get further and further away from Lumbridge as you progress in level. That's about all I can think of.

I don't think there's a canon reason for why the spellbook is arranged the way it is.

If it’s your first time you need 70 ranged minimum for blessed dhide. Otherwise you’re good to go.

Ahhhhhhhh! That’s hot! That’s hot!

A real man would have put the experience on fletching for the video

---
If they have a better weapon and want to get rid of the old one, like a whip, you'd either alch it for gp or drop trade to your main to get bonds.
---
If you want to you it later, you can use zulrah/vork, a STASH unit or a looting bag.
---
I love it how 4 of those upgrades are untradable unlocks... buy 
---
Good trade
---
I’m making poison ones. That option doesn’t show up. It just shows me the usual cook 28 raw karambwan
---
That's my main concern; I was a member for a few months way back when (birthday present from a friend) and I remember there being 10000% more content and being bored when my membership ended.  Even now with my own income, there's absolutely no way I'm paying such a high membership price (even being aware of the in-game membership bonds).
---
When are you making the HD graphics?
---
Would be so hard but I’ve always wanted to see it
---
I think your not doing cook option 2. 
---
What? He said his goal was ToB, not maxing. I don't even think maxing is possible in Morytania. There is no runecrafting altar.
---
have you tried turning the stove on and off?
---
I have no opinion on the matter as I’m very new and I would say low-mid level. The general consensus is that its very hard to strike a balance between rewards/difficulty and also the type of reward. 
---
Making low-mid content too rewarding either in alchables or in loot while great for people like me, makes it overpowered for high levels who can complete these activities much faster and potentially more rewarding to them than high level content. 
---
The lower the requirements, the more likely bots will abuse the content and make prices crash (if it drops items) or fuel more RMT (gold/alchables).
---
There’s a domino effect to these things that aren’t immediately visible unfortunately. Its a very tough spot to be in as a dev I would imagine. 
---
Not even addy platebody 4/10

Alright, mb. I thought he gave kc

With fossil island coming up to being out for almost 1 1/2 years now, will we see any more uses for rare fossils any time soon? Such as a possible demi-boss that was teased prior.

Go talk to tinsay again and he teaches you how to cook them.

Where does that option show up? I’m not seeing it in the “how many do you want to cook?” Menu when I left click the oven.

why make poison ones?

Then you haven't done the right quest.

every player is dry for some items and get super lucky in some some other way. took me a century to get defenders but then i got a wc skilling pet at lvl 26 chopping some oak. i recommend you to try barrows (do 50 run at least) and I feel you will get 3-4 barrows item. (lvl 43 prayer and lvl 50 magic is very helpful for barrows)
---
Absolute Unit in F2P.
---
Who actually barrages bloodvelds?
---
Dam. Reminds me when I told a shade to stop attacking. 
---
Swampletics is the best video series to ever exist. Prove me wrong 
---
And dont forget to wear ring of wealth to improve your chance hitting that rare table 
---
Didn't you know that Ironmen are entitled to everything and you get nothing? Lmao. That's shitty though, I'd hate that
---
Yeah theyll send out theese emails to your linked acc of someone trys to recover in game, id reccomend just googling your email and looking through pastebin dumps, youd be amazed at how much of your shit is available
---
IIRC a game tick is 0.6 seconds, so you gotta know exactly when the attack will hit you and flick prayer
---
Psshhht damn newfags probably weren't even around during the agility grind
---
f2p i guess? no idea
---
Give it a try sometimes, it's a lot of fun. Start with the highest total level world you can, there's always someone there and those people are easier to trash I find. A lot of them just hop after a minute or so while I found people in normal worlds more stubborn... 
---
THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON AHHH
---
Don't check his hiscores if you don't want to be spoiled
---
You have to barrage velds to get decent XP rates because Wyrms and Drakes are such horrendous tasks with 8 weighting on Duradel. You can get about 100k Slay xp/h but it's expensive, they drop nothing and you lose income because you can't really play alts because you're using 2-3 to help barrage.
---
In saying that your right osrs has already come to far I quit pre eoc and came back because of mobile and this is not the old school runescape I remember 
---
Tournament worlds are my favourite because I can go pk in the ffs portal at clan wars and not worry about losing gear. I don't have an account nearly good enough to pk so that's the closest I get

How are you going to change LB now? Delete people's entire looting bag? Why wouldn't it work on a UIM, anyways? UIM = no bank. LB just requires you to be in the wildy, the banking is a convenience.
---
Besides, while we're at it. There's 0 risk on a hardcore, if you die, you just change dyes. Why not update it to delete your account like on Rs3?
---
These aren't simply "game changing updates" this is changing the entire game-mode. A somewhat equal "game changing update" to normie, would be to remove free trade and the wilderness. 
---
If you want no LB/death mechanics ULT, make a HCUIM game-mode, if you want a delete-acc HC, make an extreme ironman... Why? Because people didn't signup for HCUIM when they made a UIM. You're not simply making a "game changing update" you're basically making an entirely different ironman mode.
---
Agreed it’s the hugest bummer they didn’t pass. Playerbase decided they’d rather protect looting bots than gone pkers some QOL I suppose. 
---
Why do thots performing illegal activities get pissed at you when you troll them. Just move on or risk getting reported to the authorities lmao
---
they said something about it being messy and weird for new(er) player who arent familiair with current bank limitations
---
until all the youtube/stream hype comes up around it lol

Shut up cape-nazi

Youre an idiot

Yeah. Iirc it's on the warrior's guild. Whip, slayer helm and dragon battleaxe?

"When you venge the first 41 and get hit with a 41 again"
---
On the kourend tab there's a box to check it on and off if I Remeber correctly. 
---
Why else would you give a shit? The boss already has BiS gloves, a very strong weapon, a pretty good ring and great gp/hr in alchables. It shouldn’t matter that one of its drops is pretty shit.
---
the rare table sucks, nothing on it is worth anything. just wear a ring that will improve dps instead.

I think you’re referring to a pub in Gnome Stronghold. Otherwise, that gnome child is far from home

Can F2P recieve some form of prayer potions? Currently there is no way to test no honor pking in F2P without running out of prayer quickly. Thank you for your consideration.

I don't know really :/

That's why he said "when you're ready to leave". Do your spec, get skulled up, leave immediately. Also, we weren't talking only about revs. 
---
Sorry, I missed the live-stream. Mind filling me in on what exactly they did to LB? I play a UIM, and I'm scared of suiciding now.
---
No, it looks nooby
---
Wtf is the point in playing ironman if you just cheat lol. I'll never understand this community
---
Sexian
---
Definitely check out Barrows. Can be around 1m Gp/hr with Morty Hard.
---
If you're lucky with drops you can make a killing at Barrows. I did about 200 runs which funded quite a bit of my gearing process for harder bosses like Zulrah.
---
The best is when he calls Julien Bluelien lmao
---
Wow, you sure seem like you feel superior
---
what I meant is can you play the minigame by doing the quest but NOT completing it, because I thought the minigame would be unlocked IN the quest, but I wasn't sure so I tried to ask Reddit which wasn't very helpful, sadly. 
---
c
---
If it was solely due to screeching the pub would be gone too.
---
Maybe people actually had a point about how it should be polled and how it looked ugly as fuck where it was. Stop being so arrogant that anytime jagex doesn't do things the way you want it MUST be because they are caving in to a bunch of bitching. Like does that not seem totally stupid to you. What if they didn't move the dock. Then there's be a bunch of people like you crying about how jagex caved into all the people bitching about how it doesn't need to be polled. Do you see the problem? It's just reductionist and dismissive to claim Jagex's decision was made because the other side bitched more.
---
Doesn't even make sense
---
Ahh yes, the condom cape. 
---
"I'm an art major and can't stand it when people think my art is soulless and doesn't invoke anything!"
---
False I’ve gotten several 99s with autoclickers and mouse recorders and never been banned. 
---
Make female models look more feminine
---
Exactly. OP, describe what you think this bug is. How did it happen and under what circumstances? Maybe it could be replicated on the no restrictions servers just to prove it's a real bug.
---
Mod Ian was working on it before he left the company. I believe he was pretty much our only dedicated engine man.
---
Wasn't he also in a movie or something 
---
you need to interact every minute to keep your HP at one for that, unless you mean you're re-entering every 20 minutes, you mean.
---
my personal nmz method is prayer. chug overloard/super restores with proselyte. i click three times every 5 minutes (2 super restore doses every 5 minutes works out for me just right), and that's an easy 3 hours or so of mostly afkable stuff at 75k melee xp + 25k hp xp per hour with base 70s. it's not free like absorption pots, but the 70k gp/hr cost for the super restores is worth it imo.
---
HIDE POLL RESULTS
---
I don't play anymore but I've gotten 94 magic on 5 accounts using a program that recorded my actions and replayed them, I would record myself alching for 30 minutes up to an hour. I had one account get a roll back the rest have been fine.
---
I once made account called I am roboting and ran f2p cow killer scripts on it constantly wondering how long it'd take to get banned. I eventually got bored, stopped going on the account and forgot the login details.
---
Which you can get a free trial of. 
---
All NA servers are shit compared to the UK ones. It may be better for west coasters, but it's a downgrade from the current ping. Downgrading worlds for ukers isn't a solution. Either keep the current rota system, or double up bounty worlds. 
---
She be a freak in the sheets 
---
There's some holiday item things I believe. One that makes snow or something. 
---
Probably a restricted IM working on his YT series bro leave him be.
---
We're all glad you are listening, but why do you feel compelled to make new docks everywhere? I really don't get it.... It was just fine before. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Just put Veos back where he was and call it a day. There's literally no need to force the corsairs out. I don't know what sort of fantasy games the current Jagex staff were raised on, but generally when I think of corsairs, I think of ports. Not random docks in the middle of nowhere... Stop overthinking this. Just put the nautical people in the nautical town. It's really that simple. 
---
Yesterday I got 3 keys from a nech task, and then the very next task I got 5 from fire giants, RIP my rng for awhile. 
---
clue caskets and barrows are some of my favorite content. The message in chat and pop up on the screen is a big reason for that.
---
It isn't a solution. Downgrading the experience for a lot of players, just so a different group can get a better experience isn't a solution. Rota or double up the amount of bounty worlds.
---
You’re being downvoted for other people being dumb. He can easily make 3m in 3 days looting pvp worlds alone. 
---
DAE time consuming and repetitive content = hard content?
---
Google it, That is where I came up with the answer.
---
The term crashing isnt limited to ironmen
---
“An issue with player dying with a looting bag in a F2P world and the bag keeping it's contents was fixed. Now the items are dropped to the ground as they do in P2P worlds. Existing items in unclaimed Looting bags will still be there.” 
---
That’s what was in the most recent news post on the site
---
&gt; Even knowing the lure and trying to beat it i failed!
---
That's how everyone gets lured.
---
Sounds like you were smart enough to bank your shit, so you didn't lose anything, but a lot of gullible people think they can outsmart the lurer by playing along for a bit.
---
So much dopamine
---
gz
---
Thank you very much for the offer :) already have a bond now though.
---
I will be going membs this saturday, I will definitly have loads of questions after that ^^ 
---
Damn, I knew nests were rare but wasn't expecting to get two from the same tree.
---
Got two black longswords from the easy clue though 
---
Damn I've gotten 4 scrolls just from bandos kc lol
---
When are we getting the promised Farming Guild Barn?  
---
When are you going to stop ruining nostalgia with bad ideas like the pub/barn?  
---
Who was the dev in the charge of the quest to ruin Draynor and Lumby with these two buildings?  
---
When are you going to hide poll results?  
---
When are you going to add Warding without a poll?
---
Tithe Farm is fine because players still get EXP while getting item rewards
---
Stupid, should have asked to runecraft for you!
---
But they're more susceptible to it because one hit on a monster = not your loot. They're not even geared to the point where this can be considered a crash.
---
&gt; there will be university professors specializing in researching and analyzing the memes of early 21st century
---
All right, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Sure, there would be a few researchers here and there specialising in it as a way to understand the social phenomena of internet culture, but you make it sound like it will be mainstream research with full-blown classes on the subject.
---
Somo of you teach cox in spanish? Lol
---
How do you equip a whip and a dragon battleaxe at the same time?
---
Gz man! That has to feel good
---
It's pretty crazy that there are almost no mobs with a very significant weakness to a certain Melee style. Even Dragons aren't  that much weaker to Stab than other styles.
---
But it does imply an attempt to steal kills. With that gear they’re just slightly speeding it up while giving Op and his friend something to lol about 
---
Wait how have you not earned 3m with those stats? Are you just dropping everything you get?
---
Why not
---
*Wooo* It's your **2nd Cakeday** RNGGOD69! ^(hug)
---
Would making leather with needle and thread do that?
---
Yeah, it seems incredibly inconsistent.
---
I went 3 tasks of hellhound, catacomb jellies, and fire giants without a single key, and then you see people get like 5+ each task lmao
---
Add a korasi cause pking is cancer atm
---
tell that to my cousin, averages 3-5 keys per task that lucky fuck
---
Yeah didn't want to go braindead from all the clicks so just did mahogany
---
This made me laugh more than it should have. Would give ya gold if I had any. 😂
---
Notice how they removed this mechanic, and the GP cost from aerial fishing, and people still don't really want to do it.
---
It's the auto attack on sanguinesti staff.
---
then dont play the game mode
---
Saying that modern art is not art is exactly what "tear it down" means in this context. It would be the same as saying esports should not be considered sports. This results in esports competitors/athletes not being granted work visas as a result of not being considered sports athletes. It's the same thing for art with cultural grants and the like.
---
I know somebody who auto clicked 70-99 magic and didn’t get caught 
---
Try harder, be faster and use a 3rd party client to see drops easier.
---
Better than a shot of meth+heroin 
---

---
I'm dead
---
It looks as thought they all got very high an decided to spread the joy lol
---
If you're going to argue that tons enter the game based on their economics, then looking at margin only is a pretty weak argument.  Ranarrs will pull in much more gp/hr over toadflax and can be done at the same farming level. 
---
Deleting my posts. Trying to argue about game integrity with Reddit was dumb on my part. 
---
It's a scam 
---
You can make a Catherby portal in your POH! :p
---
bones are used in a surprising amount of quests. A lot of people would rather pay ~100gp for a bone on the GE than go find something to kill. 
---
I'm not sure about the drop rate, but it's still crazy that every drop was not a repeat.
---
In that case, yes, absolutely. There's a researcher in my country who has spent 15 years researching mumbling when answering yes or no. Like "mhm" or "uh uh" and what the meaning is based on the tone it is, well, mumbled in. There are some very niche topics in academia.
---
The luckiest mofo alive who specced you is correct, you are a RETARD.
---
is not being able to use a bank not enough for you people? 
---
More like enjoy afking it in the catacombs with pray melee up, holy shit are you actually not using melee pray for hellhounds? No proselyte? Fucking yikes dude
---
He’s saying 1 hour of ~solely~ doing birdhouses. So each birdhouse run was 1:10 according to him so this was the result of 50ish bird runs. 
---
I'd wear a Peg and a Prim to Demonic Gorillas. Also bonus fashionscape points!

Ohh my sweet summer child. Have you ever heard about piercings down here?
---
currently level 95, any methods that yield alot of xp per hour?
---
The difference in those book droprates is wild
---
Nope, Trailer Park Boys.
---
Get questing and work on your slayer and con, pumping 10m in for a pool would probably be a good idea, if a few extra gear upgrades for slayer wouldn’t go amiss
---
What are they being rank for? Usefulness doesn’t make any sense nor does first 99?
---
Im just a real boy unfortunately! One day ill be a real man
---
I imagine it probably evens out over s large amount of tasks
---
Frig off Barb.
---
Agree 100%. I haven't voted in a very long time due to the fact that it's too discouraging when something is very obviously passing or failing. It makes you feel like your vote doesn't matter. I'm just stating why they've been ignoring us :)
---
Does the Slayer Helm (i) affect the cannon accuracy and damage?
---
Tibia was amazing 
---
This is an hour total cumulative time. In reality it took like a couple weeks of doing a few bids joise runs per day. 😉
---
Did you really create a new account to post this?
---
This! It needs to be fixed.
---
These are the most incredible F2P stats I’ve ever seen man. Gratz to you
---
Yea, I only want to use the official client with my account which is why I'm pushing for this.
---
Would definitely vote for this
---
You gotta get kudos, might cot down the flame
---
You cant have you even tried it? Its the one south east of polnivneah
---
If this is based on aesthetics, then why tf is cooking in rune tier lol?
---
what pool is 10m/what does it restore? the ornate is around 20m to get the levels to.
---
I think there are a few cases where we do see that kind of difference for Melee, but it is rare. I wouldn't mind seeing it done more for the occasional creature.
---
did you talk to oziach?
---
Maybe he’s just an old Everquest player. This is how you talks to npcs. 
---
At what part is op profiting? He hasn't linked any YT video, he hasn't linked his stream at all other than a bit of karma on Reddit. 
---
It's very easy for a bot to spam selling trout, then hop after a trade.

I'll give you mine for a few bucks

SWAMP👏LETICS
---
Highest hit with mage: 16
---
Highest hit with rune 2h: 31
---
Max stack: 47
---
So yeah. If I never let myself fall below 48 hp I am literally unkillable. 
---
Its an "integrity issue" either way regardless of whether you are for or against it. Visible polls keeps the poll itself honest from major manipulation from Jagex. Pushing through content that failed polls is an integerity issue. Repolling content until it passes is an integrity issue. 
---
That being said, you do realize that its mostly a meme, not a serious complaint right ?
---
Thank you!
---
Do you build one in-between houses while running? I see so many people burning time building at the spots but have never timed the difference, I'd imagine it's substantial.
---
Alkans so fuckin grateful for his ex (hardcore Ironman status)
---
That's just how the in game music is split and some extend 3 tiles if there's not a lot going on in the area, just didn't bother making 2 separate songs that people would only listen to once.
---
I don't think that you understand.
---
Tbh no
---
Glow2: WE PAY WE SAY
---
lol basically everything. i made super combats for a while, super antifire is pretty damn fast too - but I made ranging pots for most of 99 because its fast too - youre looking st like 400k/hr regardless of what you do so basically...  make potions.
---
She taught me love 💕 
---
Well on 1:50 it's actually 400kills but that's a lie
---
You have not answered the question. You have answered the question of “why do you want to drop the pet” with “because I want to”. That’s not even a real answer and it’s especially not the answer to the question I asked of why you don’t like pets. Is it really so hard to give a simple and clear answer in a single sentence with no other rant involved? 
---
Re-read my comment. I know. He's talking about the smoke dungeon in the desert.
---
Frig off my lahey 
---
I know :(, slowly but surely! This was just really suprising to get the item completion so early on :D
---
read the post again please, I feel like you didn't understand it.

Pay for the island, go to rock crabs, go to ammonite, or do the quest for sand crabs. 
---
It's really not, but ok if that's what you think
---
Pretty sure they answered this a while ago by saying it needs a new ui, but the art team is busy with other things.
---
Fuxkkkk yessss
---
Because the player-base voted against it. It seems a bit stupid to poll an update and then allow players to use it via 3^rd party clients even tho the community already rejected it.
---
He said ***OK***
---
That's hot! 
---
My bad I just did some quick math, guess I was way out, what I meant was pump 10m to get levels for ornate, tbf I’ve only got the pool up to run/spec restore and it works well enough for me
---
Poroususes
---
yup same here from belgium fucked up
---
gotcha gotcha 
---
thanks for insight brotha lol was confused for a sec
---
I think you need to leave
---
They do matter, hence why there is a rota. If they didn't matter it would be uk 24/7 no switch every 2 weeks. Hate how this topic is only coming up cos NA's 4 weeks of bounty world has ended. Stop being selfish.
---
Well no, the mode as it is now isn't like that. This issue he had is clearly not the status quo for what can be expected of using the looting bag. It should be more consistent. Im all for challenge, but completely altering the core mechanics of the game mode without polling it goes against what we wanted when we voted for oldschool all those years ago.
---
Seconded. Not possible if he is geared properly. Unless youre talking about 1999 level 3s then maybe. 
---
Yeah honestly I hate how everyone talks so much trash about the dhcb at hydra when i just got a new pb there after using it for like 10 kills. I am highly convinced that dhcb with dragon bolts is better than blowpipe with addy. It may not be as efficient to do that I'm nnot sure, but people act like the dhcb is total shit there.
---
that’s hot!
---
Sounds cool but im not really for adding stuff just to add it. Range is in a very good spot atm and I don't think it really needs anything right now.
---
Fort nite and Mark Ass Brown Lee
---
And with many strange memes, even death may die.
---
Yes. 
---
I think this would be an awesome idea (especially for those ironmen!)
---
Thurgo, ez. 
---
Hell yeah!
---
I didn't say paying for mantas is the only benefit. Everything you described relates to my description of "sandboxing", which is fine, but where's the npc that teaches you about NH bridding?
---
That’s fine with me. If you have under 100 kills you don’t fully understand how pvp works. 
---
All much too far from the bank
---
It's a scam
---
General Graardor, ez. 
---
&gt;tassies before tort
---
*scoff*
---
Well to be fair the effect stacks, so it's pretty useful.
---
You can try pure pking. Making a baby pure takes a few days (there are countless guides on YouTube from lots of popular YTers that cover expensive and inexpensive methods), and pures don't risk much each death--probably like 50-100k, most of which is just in supplies.
---
Why? It’s a great gold sink
---
Ohh I see, seems like it describes anyone with a cannon. 
---
Wow this looks sick! 
---
That's why there called noob capes and not seen as a worthwhile accomplishment
---
whats a Zeh-Zeema
---
Couple weeks ago I also learned DKs finally (also after 15 years of playing) and I got Rex pet on 58 KC ! Congrats man !
---
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING! 
---
literally every video lol 
---
If you like other grinds: work towards max
---
If you really like slayer: max it on a HCIM next 
---
Considering I did fly fishing to 99 back in the day (Shilo Village) there's no reason why it can't also be done in f2p I guess.
---
He only has the magic level to use 3 
---
&gt; I'd love to see how you'd draw something different; Runescape related of course but something in a different tone than what you've been doing lately.
---
I sort of made this account specifically for making female NPCs.
---
Osg :) 
---
I disagree. PvP is seen as a grind to many who don't enjoy that concept of the game.
---
PvM offers challenges that aren't grind based. Look inferno and such. And not everyone considers high level bossing grindy. Many consider edge pking grindy and fruitless. Personally when I look to fulfill a player vs player kinda urge i head to games that have a more intricate design based around skill. Something like Ranked Rocket League fills that part of my gaming wants far better than edge pking or similar. Rs mechanics just aren't too interesting to me and others to make PvP exciting. They are for other people. And that's the best bit of RS. you aren't forced into doing anything.
---
Get good

Netflix deal when?

Sell the ipad and buy a pc, theres your update.

Based on the data of everyone with lots of raids done that's way off.

15 hours later - did you get that dragon defender? 
---
Within the Banking interface would it be possible to have more than a single modifiable counter.  I almost never use the 5x or 10x inventory amounts, but am constantly changing the X amount.  Would be nice to have multiple presets and get rid of these unneeded 5 and 10 amounts.  
---
Damn I’m bored at 1500 kc! Props for sticking it out
---
What is it about the faces? I kinda got them looking the way i wanted now. Now i'm just figuring out which hair styles i like to use.
---
I went back and tweaked the hands earlier, shame reddit doesn't allow you to edit image posts though.
---
Nechs urself
---
Well mobile has been out for over 100 days, what changes have the ‘fixed/worked on’ with Mobile instead of working any of the things that they said was delayed because of Mobile. 
---
They always say *we’ll love to do this or that but it’s engine work*, and iirc they said would we rather have a year worth of content or an updated engine. 
---
If the content we’re getting is a pointless new pub to lumbridge and a dock that just gets reverted almost immediently from backlash of the community, then delay that shit to work on the engine. 
---
Why cant we just bling out with multiple gold necklaces while we're at it?
---
OSRS Advice is a friendly cc but they allow 0 profanity so that's a little dumb
---
That's not quite how probability works, mate. You haven't lost out on anything.
---
Poor people these days 
---
Jagex really needs to stop adding recolors though.  Starting to look more like power rangers than a medieval game.
---
Imagine cheating your account and still calling yourself an iron
---
Just don't go to any live streamers cc and most of them are pretty normal.
---
Ironmancc is the most chill without any mods telling them to be. 
---
Lol. If you want the same treatment as everyone why work so hard at making everyone know you're different?
---
99% of people in this game are fine with it and those people that can't take a joke about their sexuality when literally everyone else gets the piss taken out of them at some point or another need to relax and not force the fact that they want to be treated with respect.
---
You won't find a healthy level of respect in this game WHOEVER you are.
---
Wow that's awesome. What tech stack did you use to build it?  
---
Also, how did you post a link to a website without the sub-reddit flagging it as a potentially dangerous link? I made a site to check world ping for people who don't use 3rd party clients. Can't seem to share here.
---
osrs-ping.herokuapp.com

NPC Contact on lunar spellbook
---
Sounds like you also have 3k+ KC and no Kraken pet, I feel you. 
---
BP has a 25% chance of venoming, but with serp helm it’s 100%. So you tag all the bloodvelds and let venom do its thing while you focus one, etc... can’t remember if they switched to slay helm after venoming them or not. 
---
Never used that method, I had bloodvelds blocked majority of the way through slayer, but I remember some of the HLC experimenting with this method. Can’t find any tweets/posts about it now as I’m on mobile and cba digging any more.
---
Not bad from Noobine!
---
10/10
---
Not OP, but please I'd prefer a dedicated recap episode. Might seem kinda clunky to have a recap in an episode if someone is watching ten in a row or whatever. 
---
Ideally it wouldn't take the place of a weekly episode, but imo quality is more important than release schedules so whatever. The videos will be online probably for decades so a weeklong delay is nbd
---
A better title would've helped your post. Also, welcome to the Reddit karma lottery.
---
I've tried to uncheck and check again multiple occasions. I've tried redownloading the app... nothing seems to work.

Jokes on you, I found this by sorting by contriversial.

No thats David Guest

Someone on here last week reinstalled and it fixed it.
---
thanks brother
---
I did the following step on my elite clue scroll:
---
&gt; Surround my bones in fire, ontop the wooden pyre. Finally lay me to rest, before my one last test. 
---
And after killing the spirit my clue scroll disappeared and all that was dropped was 10 big bones. Wtf?
---
Hey man, I've been there too with the HCIM death, was nowhere near as progressed as you but it definitely hurts. TBH quitting OSRS is not a bad step in helping heal from the break up. Time to hit up the Tinder and get back out there!
---
I’m gonna re-watch episodes 1-10 tonight in preparation. What is my life. 
---
Well, fishing is more afk, but getting to 90 fishing takes longer than getting to 70 mining. I got to 70 mining in f2p as well (though I'm currently p2p since twitch prime gave out free membership)
---
Get bones off your mind pervert. 
---
Idk why you're being downvoted, you're absolutely correct.  If you willing give money for what is advertised and you are dumb (or generous?) enough to give more gp for what it's worth, then how is that a scam?  It literally tells you what the fish are worth in the trade screen.  People think they should be held on a pedestal for giving money to noobs and beggars even though anyway you split it, you're doing something that is only detrimental to yourself.
---
Tournament mode with friends really helped me last time it was out, pking on a baby pure is great practice too. I'd highly suggest tournament though 
---
Downvoted for not adding boost to attack stats.
---
^jk id never downvote u sempai 
---
No pet, or am I blind?
---
I didn’t know swampletics was only 17! Incredible that he’s already this good at editing/has built such a prestigious reputation. Well deserved though!
---
What? That's the whole point of the game mode, to make the most use of your limited inventory slots. Obviously that includes storing things elsewhere where possible. Do you think using the tool leprechaun is against the spirit of UIM? Should they carry a spade and a seed dibber at all times?
---

Does anyone else mispronounce it swample-tics on purpose?

No it must mean it's not a crazy place for a docks you complete doughnut

Ah, I'm really enjoying casually fishing as a F2P when doing other stuff

Casually buying 614k brews

Hahaha you know I’m hitting tinder, bumble and hinge! Shits going down already ;)

All the best with your Iron dude! 
---
Oh no, a typo! CALL IN THE NATIONAL GUARD!!
---
So there aren't any jar drops on any of the bosses? Would be cool to have those considering I attract so many jars
---
Will look into it. Appreciate it
---
I was using bp for about 240 of those kills so idk what to tell you
---
Don't you dare use that language in this holy sub reddit
---
&gt;Visible polls keeps the poll itself honest from major manipulation from Jagex
---
This is one of the worst arguments I've heard towards not hiding poll results. As if they couldn't do that anyways, as if they *would* do that, and as if the community wouldn't notice if something very controversial passed easily. 
---
&gt;Pushing through content that failed polls is an integerity issue
---
When has this happened ever? Or is your tin foil hat on too tight regarding the previous statement?
---
&gt;Repolling content until it passes is an integrity issue
---
I agree
---
&gt;you do realize that its mostly a meme, not a serious complaint right
---
At this point I'm pretty sure your posts are satire, but anyways memes die, legitimate complaints persist. Polls have been a constant topic for months but you don't see ridiculous spell icon Photoshops past the first couple days they were made. 
---
Some feedback is to add jars and pets on the log
---
Would never pass even though I'd agree
---
Have you ever watched someone play UIM? 
---
Good argument.
---
Eat a dick
---
In this circumstance it’s an acronym- although it is also a commonly used prefix.  It’s a prefix for many words as well as a stand-alone acronym with its own meaning.
---
It's a method to make money through deception.. Checks out as a scam to me. 
---
I stopped responding because I figured the other guy was too stupid and stubborn to be convinced otherwise. 
---
Both are there, they have their own section! use the search to find them
---
*please clap*
---
Wish I could do this. Somehow managed to drop my graceful set during a farm run without realizing it, no idea how that happened but I will say after farming 90 marks of grace that I'm not exactly thrilled or looking forward to the rest of the grind. And I want to color it this time too so that's an additional 90 I need. Fuck.

Just go into whatever CC you want and don't open the conversation with "I'M SUPER GAY (:"

May I suggest the great little cc deliveritems for all your forgetful needs. I've done quite a few runs into underground pass to give people the needed items and it saves alot of hassle for other quests as well. Just dont abuse it and "forget" everything to do a quest.
---
Did you get PK'd for that too?
---
Did you not use protection?
---
You are an idiot.
---
I'm not going to waste valuable development time to make ironmemes solve a problem that really isn't available.
---
You chose to play as an iron man and limit yourself. Dont bitch when you don't like being alone anymore.
---
Yeah it does. My membership is £3.20 ($4.13)
---
Glad you like it.
---
hmm not sure about adding the tasks for achievement diaries, I want to keep to focus on items/drops. But maybe I can add this feature in the future! Thanks for the suggestion
---
this is not swampletics soooo reeeeeeeeeeee
---
Can we stop doing this already
---
Oh ok thank you lol 
---
Ah I forgot about that haha- I stopped bringing one after 6k kills because it wasn’t really about the profit anymore and I just wanted the pet.    Save myself some clicks at the cost of ~2k in charges per kill.
---
My favourite anime.
---
Back in 08 or so I was grandfathered in and never had to pay more than the original price. Like a fool I let it go and now it's nearly 3 times as much lol.
---
Not OP but you could put them in a playlist called Recaps.  Make them 2 to 3 min max in length and title them Episodes 1-4.  Then post your new video linking to the recap.  Would be nice.
---
Yeah, i know about the cc but i have quest cape now :p, also last time i went there i got completely ignored while 4 people were spam arguing which didn't give me too great of a image of the cc
---
Trading in Iron Sheets at the Piscatoris Fishing Colony after the Swan Song quest currently rewards only 20 coins per sheet. As such, this activity seems a rather pointless inclusion in the OSRS experience. Could we see a modest boost in the either experience from smithing them or an increase in the gold rewarded? It seems like a quick way to bring in a small piece of content that currently is just entirely pointless. I had to check the wiki to see if I was missing something when it is mentioned during the quest.
---
Shut up serene
---
If you watched the original video, you'd know plenty of people paid exactly what the trout were worth.
---
Why not just do the entire quest?  Like is there a specific reason, you've got me curious.
---
^ass
---
free to play is literally like 5% of the game. You are gonna have an immense amount of stuff available to you.
---
That’s why I posted in all caps, I know it’s obnoxious but I’m trying to help 
---
if you give a shit, wear fighter torso and veracs skirt and buy primordial boots and torture instead. Once you can afford tassets buy them but I’d hold off on BCP until you really feel like you couldn’t spend 18m on skilling or something else. There are enough scenarios where you’ll be wearing a different chest doing slayer and bossing that you’ll find you almost never have it on anyway
---
You can swap out the veracs skirt for obsidian legs but I prefer +4 prayer over +1 strength for using piety 
---
 
---
How do I delete this post?
---
x2 bots are more profitable, and those are actual scams.
---
You are literally advocating pushing through an update that failed polling. And are claiming that I am a conspiracy theorist for saying you are asking for such? What logic are you using? You do realize that hiding poll results failed polling, right?
---
Sadly, you dont realize that 99% of the hide polls posts are memes.

FUCK I didn't check but now my mind is racing for what he could have possibly done, did he get his hunter up? Did he max something? FUCKKKKK... why have you done this.
---
Might get shit for this, but AHK for banking makes a world of a difference. Banking takes like literally 2 seconds and as soon as you're done you can take your hand off the keyboard. 
---
The point of the game mode is to restrict you from banking
---
Apples pies are European. 
---
Doesnt this happen in barbarian assault? Also while it sounds good to pitch it as bringing 3 weapons I feel like most people would just bring a hasta as it does all 3 styles well. Pretty sure its BIS for one handed stab and crush, and isnt too far behind the whip in slash
---
Oh I had a load of splits, was just personal loots over 600kc and nothing better than a hilt to me. :P
---
Devalues my range tank. I’m already disappointed I can’t do Vet’ion, Grotesque Guardians, and one of the daganoth kings. =( 
---
Why do you hate me so?
---
Are you trolling? The items getting destroyed or not doesn't affect an iron-man in anyway???? 
---
yeah im laughing my ass off at a brain amputee tbh
---
are you having fun?

I have the collection book.

if i wanted to see someone abuse a looting bag i'd go do cerberus

As soon as it dies I'm sure

oh wow 6k dry is rough... you ever get it?
---
I did. Whatever you want to call this, a scam or what, it's the same thing as saying you're doubling. Logically anyone would say if you fall for it, that you deserve it. Doesn't make it any less scummy.
---
Anyone can sell as many trout as they want but "selling 13 trout" specifically should set off red flags.

Just go to his house and watch the episodes he has stocked up while he’s sleeping

Does nobody in this game have a dedicated spot in their bag where their coins go? And if you're at the ge you have a banker RIGHT THERE to get money from. 
---
Best of luck with what you decide to pursue IRL. ❤️
---
Yes.
---
Doubling money is literally deceiving someone by telling them you're going to do something then you don't.

You're an idiot.

To explain: Its a good meme because he was a big star in YouTube rewind, even though as you say he has nothing to do with YouTube 
---
Did you just miss **in any significant way** or are you purposely just undermining the argument by neglecting points made. MLM is still slower than the F2P options, granted, the F2P rocks are usually more crowded by bots and such so it might be difficult for mining specifically but the points still stands. F2P rates can compete for the mundane skills like that.
---
I see people ask this now and again. What exactly is a "proper clan system"? I know the current system is just a glorified group chat, but what are you looking for?
---
False. It is only accepted by mouth breathers or people stuck in the 90's. &amp; I don't think anyone was trying to argue that runey is "accepted", the word sounds almost as bad but it's funny seeing retards freak out over it
---
Makes sense. Ill be buying them now since 99pray will be around 60m only and 800k xp/h.
---
I did it for the weed removal, never again

Welcome to the brotherhood brother. You pursue a noble cause, as Cold War 2 is a fight worth fighting for. Comrades, prepare the memes, we must do our duty and bring Cold War 2 to RuneScape.

who on earth still does sand crabs when Fossil Island is a thing????????

The autoclicks fell out of sync. True and proper 1 tick flicking the overhead will look static and as far as the game is concerned is, but you are double clicking your prayer as it turns on every  . 6 seconds. In the easiest way to explain it as possible. The prayer gets turned off during the system checks to see if your prayer is on for draining and them back on  until the next tick. Watch woox 1 tick flick jad with 1 prayer point. 
---
Really? Wow

Nechs meme!

You must be fun at parties

I've been watching blowpipe prices and they went up cause they were so good for hydra. The hydra craze ended a while ago so the price was in a bubble. Finally collapsed.

6.27m total, tomb at 365, and no fucking pet.

Keep telling yourself that combat brance obby cape

Don’t listen to these guys and just do what you do. 
---
I guess were the minority for thinking that way 
---
It’s 52 pray already so gotta make it a higher level build. Prob going to have to get 60 atk and start maxing strength and range. 52 pray at low levels will make him much weaker than others that just have 31 pray
---
Natural selection tbh
---
I like that guy 
---
Because then Jagex can claim the results are whatever they want. That seems painfully obvious to me
---
1 *major* bug PER UPDATE. I don't see how people don't realize how awful that is as a QA tester.
---
Have neither of those LOL
---
You got me!
---
Lol bandos chestplate and apron on at the same time? Nice try
---
That makes more sense 
---
i met a guy once who told me he was an undercover jagex employee and that he just received intel that i was gonna get banned in a week cause jagex thought i was botting at sand crabs. he said the only way he could save my account was if i gave him 3 mil. funniest shit ever.
---
No 1 core of an i5 shouldnt break a sweat. Its probably a heat issue and the core is automatically underclocking itself massively.
---
Secure your account and get some free loot. Make sure to change all your recovery questions, get a bank pin. Also you cant get banned for having your account stolen unless they did some rule breaking on your account...

I would watch an entertaining streamer eat their own shit on stream, but I wouldn't watch anything based solely on  the account level.

good luck my man! :)

I hope this is a joke :x

Now imagine your stats if you did as many hours in members.
---
F2p XP/hr is abysmal you probably did enough hours for quite a bit
---
Ammonites is packed with mains 
---
You're not being properly cooled. Maybe the heatsink isnt in contact. You core is powering itself to a lower state to avoid damage, hence a 100% reading
---
Thank you m8, I will have a look at it!
---
because i get caught up in all the high level content and my pride makes me forget that quest exist so if you see me whipping goblins in lummy say hi
---
But you can do that in your inventory too.

Loved it, runelite would make a noise and I’d go drop off the payload

You use these to smith into armour with a hammer

Amazing artstyle!

NO SPOILERS!! THIS IS BREAKING BAD 2.0!
---
I don’t think you even lock in houses anymore do you? Didn’t they just change that? 
---
This occurs when you kill it in its ground state as it resets states when safespotted every 20-30 seconds or so, so sometimes you get a 100% non-transitional kill that usually gives regular bones.  
---
ring of life
---
just tested it with normal seaweed as well. you're right. buy buy buy buy lol. EHP will be 1.3m an hour for crafting.
---
Hey I don't care that much but you shouldn't spoil it for everyone just browsing comments
---
I care
---
&gt;when you have no clue what you're talking about but you make a post anyway
---
XP/hr is good but it's one of the few minutes that feels actually unpleasant to play IMO. 
---
Why do your skill icons look like that?
---
Just go around saying btw
---
FOR THE CUNTS WHO PJ OFF YOU WHEN YOU ARE AFKING
---
i’m probably gonna go with the camelot tele after the hard diary for there
---
Devalues my shim myself between the log supports and redwood tree only ultimately zone locked ironman
---
Are there any plans on reworking/improving the skill cape perks? Almost all of them seem very bad and there is almost no scenario where you would ever want to use them. 
---
LOL? So you are bitching about the fact that you cant destroy items that you PKd? If I cant have them nobody can???
---
You legit picked a gamemode that means no trading or interacting with other players. So why should I care to vote yes when you shouldnt be PKing in the wilderness anyways??
---
Additionally, Ironmen have the PVP advantage because they can keep their HP low via PVP. I aint giving a quality of life to an ironman and wasitng dev resources on such a stupid suggestion. 
---
Just kill them like a man.
---
At least he got paid. Usually they take the kill and dip
---
This got weird..
---
The dragon slayer lance is strictly worse than the Zammy hasta against non-dragons
---
Lance= +85 stab, +70 str
---
Z hasta = +85 stab, +75 str, +13 mellee/range defence, +2 prayer
---
Whip= +82 slash + 82 str.
---
But it has a 20% accuracy and damage buff which makes it bis against dragon.
---
You can use z hasta against non-dragons slayer if you fancy a non-whip weapon. Dps is about the same.
---
Blast Furnace is the key
---
No you've got it backwards. You are still too low leveled to do be doing slayer.
---
I proposed an idea a while ago to hold a button on the left side of the screen and when you tap with your other thumb it instantly right clicks. Sort of like a hot key. 
---
Cold War 2: Wrath of the Lich King
---
LITERALLY unplayable
---
He can't wait to get his hands on his unbannable bot.
---
The only people talking about it are the people complaining
---
&gt;"Sit kid" am I right.
---
thats a meme dude. your entire argument is a literal meme. 
---
&gt;When pkers are consistently toxic and release that toxicity by killing you it doesn't really matter to you if it's fair, you just don't like them. So if you wanna start getting pk updates stop acting arrogant like you are in your comment.
---
buddy thats not how it works. you admitted the PVM community is toxic so you wanna fuck us over in the polls and destroy the game cause you lost your spade? does that not sound like what a hypocritical retarded baby does? you have *no right to be mad* because youre dying in a PVP zone so add entitlement issues to that too. you feel entitled to not dying for some reason because you risk nothing. 
---
&gt;Similarly teleblock significantly affects skillers in low wildly. To say they shouldn't have a say in what kills them in the wild is stupid. The same applies to the root buffs. Just cause you think it's a fair buff as the killer does not mean pvmers think it's fair to be killed that way. You act like that's pvmer bias and bitching but it goes both ways. Pvpers want buffs to help them kill, pvmers want nerfs to help them live.
---
problem is there are more PVMers and skillers than PKers. so the burning need to survive the wild while taking advantage of its content (while also being blissfully unaware of the warning message you get when you enter, which is that youre going to lose your spade if youre not careful) is more than the desire to have actual balanced spellbooks. 
---
&gt;You'll never win polls perpetuating that attitude.
---
i dont really have a word for how fucking retarded this is lol. you just admitted to being extremely toxic and manipulating polls because youre mad the rules of the wild apply to you. we will never win polls anyway, unless people voting on PVP (read: PVP, like players fighting other players, not wild PVM or skilling) are vetted for wildy PVP activity. 
---
you guys CONSTANTLY cry about morons and noob accounts voting in PVP polls when your favorite polls dont pass. you CONSTANTLY cry about hiding poll results. and now here you are again crying about losing your spade, and seriously threatening to destroy this community over it. 
---
of course were better than you lol. 
---
Massive L
---
he didnt actually get 40 rc, i’m pretty sure he has no physical way to gain runecrafting xp at all (outside lamping). i thought that was obvious, but then i realized that he’s done stuff that seemed impossible so now I realize that it could be taken the wrong way. sorry
---
This was never polled but can we please move the keyboard right side up when using mobile so typing is easier?
---
And can we move the more commonly used tabs to the right side of the screen? Or just move all of them to the right?
---
Could you make Hops patches more easily accessible and add one to the farming guild?
---
but.. if it can be efficiently killed with range and safespotted my lazy senses tingle
---
i really have to wonder if the people who compare rs3 to WoW have ever actually played WoW
---
Bots. Have you ever been to a f2p world? Especially barb village. It's crazy that they dont get banned straight away.
---
So balanced...
---
Would you agree that season 3 really has been a big step up from 1 and 2? Not all the way to the full top gear experience but is constantly getting closer. Fake 47's were a real let down though.
---
Holy.. how can I commission one?
---
you mean swampleticrabs? i'd wager no one even knew of the -55 ranged, but now it's a straight meme because of swampletics
---
Oh yeah it's the ghost flick or whatever right.  Makes sense why they died then lol
---
i think konar give the most points as well.
---
hellhounds and blue dragons both have available safe spots so they should be easy. I'm 89 combat and I've been using Nieve and have yet to be given a task I couldn't do, you can look up guides on good ways to do the tasks on youtube.
---
He saved up tomes for the ultimate dopamine rush
---
Do konar Slayer master at your level. If you have to look up YouTube guides on your task on where and how to kill a monster.
---
Sometimes things like pyrfiends look like they hit melee but hit magic.
---
A lot of people use cannon to speed up tasks but you lose like 200k per task. 
---
Start ranging tasks you find too hard for your level like black demons, or blue dragons. If you have to cancel the task. You'll be doing it the slow way but you kinda have to just put in the time with how low your level is. You'll get better Slayer Masters and tasks as you go on. 
---
If you don't want to slowly safespot with rcbow and broads you can learn to pray flick, or get used to spending like 80k a task on prayer pots. Most tasks you should just be able to use monk fish and telly back quickly with Slayer ring in the future. 
---
why do u play as a female character? that's gay
---
I was surprised to find no Green Eggs as part of the requirements for any H.A.M. quests
---
Almost certainly RuneLite with the "interface styles" option checked.
---
What kind of monster doesn't separate their private chat? 
---
Well, yeah, awful people exist, but that's no reason to join in on the mob mentality and shrug your shoulders like nothing can possibly be done about shitty people. I really hope you find some people who eventually don't make you feel like this, because this is a terribly cynical and sad outlook.
---
Yes! Please repoll this!
---
Seems a Jmod finished one log support and just copied and pasted the rest. Every end log does not actually reach the tree. 
---
Oh my God. This would mean the world to me, I can finally start my donation only ironman...
---
Yes there is no longer the need to lock in. It will not reduce if you decide to work on another house.
---
my OCD thanks you
---
You didn't hide your name in the top left btw, unless you're just hiding for a meme. (besides your HP)
