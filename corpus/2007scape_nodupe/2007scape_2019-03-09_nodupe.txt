Actually my bank allows me chargebacks up to an indefinite time as long as the company still exists. If it does not, then they would guide you or your lawyer to pursue in a legal way, at least that's how it goes in south east asia where I live. I surmise it's different in the states or europe.

- What is the solution to accounts being hacked through recovery? 
---

---
There's a lot of information in leaked databases and some people aren't cautious with their information. What if, somehow, the information that's needed for a successful recovery appeal is "out there"? I know these cases are highly unlikely and people should care more about account security. Most people I bet don't use bank pin + auth + 2fa together and many post information on forums which can get them hacked. Maybe start a campaign dedicated to account security? Explain how auth only works with 2fa, that a bank pin is needed and that people should be cautious wth posting information online and making themselves a target?
---
- Would it be possible to (temporarily) implement an optional authenticator delay?
---
If not, why not? I think an auth delay is only needed when it's possible to get hacked through recovery, which is possible. But then again those cases are so unique. In most cases something else happened, like owner sharing the account or a JMod that made a mistake when accepting the recovery.
---
- Would it be possible to get better customer support on the RS website?
---
Without having to post on social media, without having to post on any forums, without needing attention on reddit or youtube. I understand why Jagex jumps on top posts on reddit, but CS in general needs improvement. The CS mods on Twitter are useful in many cases, but sometimes you're talking to a wall. Also bans should never be unappealable. Of course I understand there's so many bots or RWTers that get rightfully banned, but what about the people that don't? They are doomed, unless they get lucky on reddit.
---

I‚Äôm not opposed to stackable clues. I often point out that eclectic impling jars are essentially stackable medium clues and yet ranger boots have remained relatively stable. Most people don‚Äôt want to listen to logic though.

The magic logs went super fast for me, just bring entangle runes and stand about halfway to the northwest corner. Then just world hop and grab any natures that are nearby. I didn‚Äôt bother chasing them down if they were far away. I got my 12 logs in 87 nature implings. 
---
Also grab eclectics while you‚Äôre there because they give medium clues and I shit you not I just got Ranger boots from doing this. 
---
It‚Äôs a boss fight area from Dragon Slayer 2
---
Rat Catchers is just a combination of a stupid idea for a quest, janky "stealth" mechanics, and all in all just feels like one of the most worthless quests in runescape.
---
True. Gotta choose your battles. If you want to be 100% secure you know how- make a new account.
---
Id just keep the stack limit low tbh. I dont enjoy doing clues and am a skiller so xD
---
While Underground pass did suck (well, if your agility is low, it does), it definitely felt like a long, arduous adventure with a fitting reward.
---
Dig Site... yeah, you're literally helping/bribing students so that you can take an earth sciences exam. 
---
dude had no bank pin and posts a tbow on reddit while his username on reddit is same as rs (guessing password too based on the little amount of care shown so far) dude definitely deserved to get hacked. how has he not learned that almost every single one of these steps is a necessity for anyone rich on runescape active in reddit

Also lost all my items, also got the run around with support, ended up getting told too bad so sad. Since then I have asked for refunds on membership time, and they have given the money back. I know it seems like a huge waste of time to just get 10.99 back, but I don‚Äôt want to support this indie development group that thinks we will believe they can‚Äôt give items back; even though it is due to their system, and they are playing favorites. I hope you are more successful in getting your items back. 
---
Gyazo is trash imo. It's the same as snipping tool but takes forever to load for anyone on mobile.

About a week ago in private I was muttering under my breath about having to re enter my pin multiple times. I thought you know what, let me talk to this goddamn banker, and sure enough I was able to change these settings. This is a good Postman Pat, kudos OP

I felt the complete opposite when I completed MM1 on my crappy low level ironmeme. The tunnels gave me plenty of practice with prayer flicking since I had zero prayer/stamina potions. The boss was terrible because I just kept splashing endlessly and he kept healing because the NPCs were getting the killing blow. 
---
The fat exp reward and ability to use the dscim from MM1 also helped.
---
Respectively, if you don‚Äôt have the stat requirements to finish all hard clue steps, I don‚Äôt value your input. I‚Äôd wager a decent amount of the player base doesn‚Äôt do clue scrolls, so stackable clues don‚Äôt affect them.

---
As a Teemo main I agree, all Teemo players should be publicly lynched and their families exiled to Siberia.
---
My main point is mainly that if a lot of people have hundreds of caskets ready to spam open on release day the item won't go for as much as it would if you could only prepare 1 clue like when masters came out. You have to get lucky and you could make bank, which i think is the main hype of doing things on release day. And all that gets ruined with stackable caskets imo.
---
If they indeed make it so stockpiling isn't a thing i'd be happy with stackable caskets

Yeah I considered this. I've come to the conclusion he strategically hacked me Friday night UK time so that by the time Jagex gets around to my shit on Monday, my bank pin expiration delay will have expired and he will have just enough time to move the wealth off the account.

Recovery system is fine, no authenticator removal delay is not.

His email would have been known by other people. If you make a new email with your account no one except you would know it.

---
\&gt; No it mostly for the loot someone could have 
---
  
---
I mean this clearly is not the primary drive tho. If it was, they could get way more loot from doing something else like pvm or even skilling. If anything you could say they maybe want the loot just because there is a satisfaction that they took it off someone else. Either way, the primary goal is definitely not the monetary gain. Its satisfaction from taking someone's stuff or wasting their time. And to me, that's just being an asshole. I don't think a clue scroller should get mad though if it happens cause its expected, but doing what is expected can still be being an asshole.  
---
H
---
pinky promise? I know you guys laugh, and obviously i know its never a good idea to give into extortion, but its kind of a fucked if you do fucked if you don't kind of thing. Because best case scenario i get the account locked and then returned to me before he has access to my bank, and he just tries to recover my account again 6 months later. Even if there's just a 5% chance he would take the 70 mil and keep his word, I would consider that, because I do not feel like playing paranoid and never keeping wealth on the account ever again. If you've never been in this situation, I'd hold off on the judgement. 
---
They're a mix. Pvm ones like brutal black dragons easily earn more. Something like amethyst or redwoods is less but probably the most afk training method for their respective skills. Cannonballs have basically no requirements and are decent profit and super afk. Darts are slow smithing xp for profit while being really afk.

I mean having more than 1 prayer and less than 43 is pretty pointless.

And if you do d bones at gilded altar you can get 43 in like half an hour.

Jagex don‚Äôt bother with them and you can‚Äôt use support for Osrs items as they have a no refund policy

I made this video back when mobile came out but I was too afraid to post it here

Yeah, theres a couple methods, but what I feel works best is to learn just one rotation and if you don‚Äôt get it, teleport out and try again. Expensive, but saves you a lot of time and supplies planking again and again.

Id also recommend minimising any switches where possible, more inefficient is preferable over more panicked clicking, you will fail your switches and die if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing

 No, he literally has a history with rwt. Almost exclusively with selling mind you. Way back in rs2 days he sold rares he gained through staking and such. I wouldn't be surprised if he hasn't touched the rwt scene on OS, since by this point he has no reason to, he makes enough through streaming.
---
Maybe, but I assume he wouldn't have any experience on the billing end of things. I'd love for Jagex to open up Work at home call centers so we could work in the US but that would never happen..

Favourite: One Small Favour. Its so much fun running all over runescape, and the dialogue is hilarious.
---
Least Favourite: Rat Catcher. I don't mind avoiding guards in quests if its done well, such as in Monkey Madness II. But I found the mansion part in Rat Catchers so frustrating. Whats worse is the guards can fall out of sync over a long period of time, so you have to hop worlds until you find one that actually gives you a chance of success.

From what I've heard, it seems to suggest it was some error with the map editor. It happened when the Artist went to map down the Hespori indicator and the wording suggested it wasn't just that they accidentally mapped down a T Bow when moving around or such. They also said there was a reason why of all items it was the T Bow specifically.

Yeh bro I ran with darius silve to counter icy shards and all the noob ccs

Probably not the worst, but one that comes to mind... So this was sometime after Brine Rats came out and I was like one 5 players there killing there for Brine Sabres (it was a different time, okay?). But someone else there died and I snag most their loot, including Rune Boots which were like 100K or more back then; forget exact but it was a lot. I forget it I added the guy or if he came back, but I ended up giving most his gear back and becoming friends with the guy... But I didn't give him back his Rune Boots for like 4 months. I mean he did lose em and I didn't have to give them back, but it is still kinda messed up to be friends with the guy for weeks but still go "nah, I'm keeping the boots".

This is funny, I was thinking the same recently. I‚Äôd just fear to end up on RS3 as I wouldn‚Äôt have the same passion.

Jagex, I work in HR in a canadian tech support company.
---
Mods, you heard me, If you hire this guy and he needs help, I am a CANADIAN customer service guy for customer services guys. I am an expert at apologies and I can fix all sort of bullshit. Hit me up for my resume, I‚Äôll do part time job.
---
Hell, I love this game, I would even do it for free 2-3 hours per week to fix your shit.
---
All I know is salve doesn‚Äôt stack with slayer helm. Idk about mace
---
Even a stack cap of 2 would help immensely for bossing/slayer. Perhaps you can somehow buy a cap of 3 from Watson after you've completed X amount of tier Y, Z, etc. clues.
---
Rs3 is also significantly easier to die in than OSRS. Almost every end game boss cannot be teleported from, and they almost all have instakill mechanics.

It's really all a gamble. You are lucky and had some teams with people who knew what they were doing. I recently got torso around 115cb and it took me around 6ish hours with 3-4 scuffed groups quitting before the queen. Sometimes you get lucky.
---
It's not really just about the derogatory stuff tho, its probably a lot of the general reactions to girls being online that makes girls uncomfortable. Can't go on a stream without people going insane like its the last female left on earth

Seemed like a prevalent piece of feedback I received with the kilt was that people would rather/additionally like to see a chestpiece that offered +1 strength to fill that niche, but unfortunately I couldn't get around to a proper design suggestion until after the poll blog went live.
---
That said, I really love the kilt model that u/Mod_West made and wanted to make a matching top to go with it, just for fun if nothing else.
---
That's about it.
---
But it seems you've hit my bastion host and those sweet packets are on their way to my metadata storage github account as we speak.

Tldr

I do not have an efficiency mindset. For all I care you could spin flax for your entire playtime. The discussion was "if youve pkd you would know that is a lottery", the other guy gave an analogy as a counter argument, and I informed him that using an analogy as an argument is a known fallacy so we can't go anywhere in our discussion with that. Him telling me he got 250k off some naked guy once does not do anything for the argument. It does not prove I'm wrong that it is a lottery and it does not prove me right that it is a lottery. That was why I brought up the barrows analogy. Not to flex some shit about how it is more efficient.  
---
Also I wanna say I find it ironic you are calling me the snowflake when I am the one just talking about how analogy does not help an argument but here you are cursing, calling me names, and calling my mindset poisoned.
---
Huh
---
I see you have 2k updoots

Grats on your new job

Lmao they only exist because of retards like you.

No.....
---
Have fun working for free, rs ain't paying for customer service.
---
Nobody is quitting cause they don't have customer support. RS has been around for how many years already and how many people have you heard quit for that specific reason? How many people have you heard play a game for their customer support? 
---
Answer to both questions: None.
---
Cool story bro. Repost about an AMA for International Men‚Äôs Day in November this year, and let women have their day.
---
You look at the big questions that the community has, except the ones that seem to be the biggest (i.e. hiding poll results). I imagine that most people would accept the answer you would give, but it's just that  you don't even acknowledge them being asked at all is what people get ticked off about.
---
This guy PKs
---
rsbuddy.com is the official osbuddy website but its highly recommended not to use it as Runelite.net is now the best third party client to use.
---
Nice

Jagex should add a literal skill called "Cleanup" where you ban bitchbots and if you're legit you get weekly xp drops
---
I just did grim tales yesterday. The dialogue is hilarious. I love how they straight up make your guy a moron in everything haha.
---
5 years of customer service 1 year of call center experience, I‚Äôll help.
---
I have no qualms about women having their day, but given that this comment was made today and was done in bad taste, it deserves to be addressed now. Not at the end of the year.
---
That first game I only fessed up because our healer that carried us was flaming the other attacker. I honestly thought the guy was trolling because called eggs wrong every time. I made sure to spam the correct egg call after him lol. 
---
So our healer is rightly pissed off. Other atk apologizes says its his first game. I chime in say me too. We literally had to wait in room 10 for this guy to watch a youtube guide on the queen fight, and we still agreed i'd handle the egg duties for atk. 
---
So we're both new...but this guys fucking clueless. I wish I had screen capped our healer yelling at him to turn auto off and just stand in the back lol. And still, we weren't ever in any danger of losing. I get theres games someones gonna afk or not remotely do their job, but damn they make this shit sound like fight caves.  
---
Lvl up a hc and then die to dc, makes quitting easy 
---
Ive been floating this for years. The community could police itself if given the tools 
---
bro move
---
Leave the game alone already... Especially cosmetics, especially the already beautiful ancestral
---
Favorite: DS2; reminds me of Nomad, which is the quest that gave me confidence in my RS abilities.
---
Least favorite: Haunted Mine; annoying maze, deceptively hard boss.
---
You‚Äôre a moron and inconsiderate. It‚Äôs international women‚Äôs day. Drop your own agenda. There are 364 other days in the year to ask about doing the same for international men‚Äôs day.

\&gt; They want money from pvp. It's not that hard if I told you I was killing gargoyles cause I wanted money, you wouldn't be justified to tell me "clearly you aren't killing them for money or else you'd kill vorkath.".  
---
Well actually yes I would. If your primary reason to kill them was the gp, id say why dont you do anything else. Even barrows would be better. How ever if your primary reason is slayer and your secondary is GP I would say that makes sense. If your primary reason is you just like killing gargoyles, and your secondary is GP that still makes sense too. However it is pretty logical to say your primary objective is not GP.  
---
\&gt; They enjoy pvp combat and they can get money from unsuspected people so they kill anyone they can.   
---
We agree then I think you just dont see what I am saying. As you said here, they enjoy pvp. That is the primary. Then the next part of what you said is the secondary, getting money from unsuspected people. The point of focus is their primary objective makes them an asshole to me. "enjoying pvp combat" against a naked person with GP gain only as a secondary objective is just a nice way of saying they enjoy "besting" someone and wasting their time, with a side of GP as a bonus.   
---
\&gt; You can make really good money pking.   
---
Sure you can, you can also make a lot of money off of master clue scrolls. Doesnt mean farming master clue scrolls is good for making gp. Again if money was the reason you are pking you are in the wrong place. Money is a secondary gain for pkers. 
---

YES!

Not even gonna lie. I thought the guy was fucking the mole for a second. Have an upvote though this is wholesome
---
Then say goodbye to this game you care about so much when Jagex won't be able to support server costs and employee costs. So people will have to be let go. So either you don't care about them or you just can't think further than your own wants.
---
&gt; Let me guess... you believe in the wage gap.
---
Yes, because it's an observable fact. [Just take a look at any of the scholarly peer reviewed articles on the subject](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=gender+wage+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart). 
---
&gt; Women are treated less because they allow themselves to
---
There's some classic victim blaming right there. 
---
&gt; I worked my ass off to get where i am today. And if a woman did the same thing she would be in the great situation ive found myself in too.
---
No, she probably wouldn't. Women with more experience, more education, better performance reviews, still get passed over for men for career advancement all the time. 
---
Again, there's about a million articles and studies on it. What it really comes down to is implicit bias. A man might have traits like confident, driven, passionate, but those are viewed in a woman as pushy, bitchy, or overly emotional. Women can act exactly the same as men, but their actions are interpreted vastly differently just because of implicit bias.

They‚Äôre the only boots, to my knowledge, that offer any prayer bonus. I find them especially helpful for slayer in the Catacombs, but otherwise I don‚Äôt use them that often. I‚Äôve gotten 3 in 400+ med, so it might take a while or it might not.

When you recover an account you specify an email and that becomes the email address of the account. They kinda have to do that for cases where you're recovering and you lost access to your email

Canadian. I speak french and english. Also willing to be a costumer service agent. Love the game :)

Always wished i could work for jagex to be honest haha
---
Oh wow, I watched his episodes today and he gave me some inspiration. Looking forward to taking it a step further as an UIM
---
How would the rewards be? 1 xp per 1k gp botted on an account that you bust? 1 xp per spam chat message, 1 xp per 1k xp earned on the bot account etc. That way it could be a f2p skill too, with slower xp/h. That actually sounds fun ~~and not at all similar to Slayer~~. Screw Warding, let‚Äôs get Bot~~Slayer~~Buster

you see women want equality but only the good parts they dont want the bad parts of it lol

Zilyana can't protect from ranged and Kree has massively accurate and damaging attacks.
---
Yeah definitely, and don't get me wrong, I like the idea. It's probably just more work than jagex wants to put into it to vet users and make sure they're not wrongfully muting people or whatever.
---
Is there a certain combat level or stat-line I should have for playing Barbarian Assault? It seemed like, other than the Attack role, you would mainly just need Def, but all the other players were way better geared/leveled than my 50 def rune-set self. Don't want to drag a team down and get called trash or whatever.

Mostly just wanted to go for the fighter torso, since I remembered it was a pretty popular piece of gear, but I haven't played since around 2007.

There was noting in there copy pasted, right above where i said "if you care to learn more" is the book you are looking for. 
---
By the way it was not a straw man argument i never attributed you're opinions, i said **If** you where to do X then Y would be the case **not** that you do it or said it. This would be what people would generally refer to as an example. The point of that was that the majority of normal people do in fact do X and it means Y, I assumed you where normal, my mistake.
---
I guess you are outside the norm and understand that most world leaders of the most powerful nations are mass murders, war criminals, and that the crimes committed under Stalin are nothing that dose not happen in many countries by many leaders. Pretending that Stalin was some how an anomaly or a special type of mass murder is silly. The point is when people frame one side of history as all justified and one as all un-justified, it makes it much easier to push propaganda that will go under the radar because off you're tacit assumptions that you never challenge.
---
Which in conclusion could only mean you would equally take umbrage when someone speaks about Donald trump. Obama, or Winston Churchill in any other way outside of condemning what they did like, the detention centres of trump, the drone strikes of Obama or the Bengal famine of Churchill. 
---
If neither of these assessments are correct then i fail to see what you exactly had a problem with.
---
As the problem you stated you had with my assertion that you have bad opinions was retorted with NO U.
---
Ah, I didn't know they added a farming guild tele to the cape.
---
maybe but is settled really gonna tome all the way to 85 slayer before ToB?

About half the comments on this thread are pretty good examples. Women's day is about combating inequality, you can't have a day to celebrate inequality from a male perspective without exacerbating the issue. 
---
Take it out of politics, we can promote and combat issues facing an endangered animal, but there's no need to try and do the same for pigeons. There's billions of those fuckers.
---
Someone saying, "it's only fair to spend the same amount of time trying to preserve pigeons", does not understand the point, and is just taking away from the work that can be done to actually combat inequality. 
---
&gt; I think it is obvious that there is a vast difference in having a weekly Q&amp;A discussing a video game, and a IAMA hosted by creators of a video game in recognition of an international holiday.
---
So what Men's day question would you like to ask then? If it's so important, and couldn't possibly be related to any other Q&amp;A outside of the day, I'm sure you have specific examples?
---
I want to say Cold War is my favorite...but MAN DS2 knocked it out of the park. Least favorite?...probably just about any quest on karamja. Running around that area is terrible.

they aren't the most useful thing, but they have some niches

One small favor is actually one of the quests I liked for the sole fact of how cognizant they were of the terribleness. The part where they brought up T.R.A.S.H actually made me laugh.

Let me know! Good luck

only item worth anything is the tbow which u prob got at an undeserved kc so i wouldnt be upset if i were u
---
Gz tho

I don't understand what you're getting at. Is getting harassed based on your gender not an issue we should address instead of telling the female moderators to "make themselves less of a target"? This is textbook victim blaming

---
Do a ton of quests and slayer. 
---
Also fyi it isn‚Äôt smart to post your account age since it plays a role in account recovery. 
---
I've always wanted this. Right now all it does is act as a perm light source. Good for a few quests and things. But otherwise useless. 
---
thats nice still does not change the fact females want better pay then men but want to do less work
---
Agreed. I always feel so bad for the female JMods. When Gee showed up it was like people had never seen a woman before and all the comments were super creepy. Pretty sure in the past we scared off some female JMods from the stream as well. IMO Jagex should just actively or post-stream ban any twitch accounts that make comments which clearly cross lines. Absolutely nothing of value will be lost. 
---
I stand corrected. I doubt using these would be worth a decrease in DPS for such a small prayer bonus though when OP could surely acquire climbing boots or rune boots much easier.
---
Foolish. Such a short term mindset. Even assuming he has 200b and 1 dollar per bill that's 200k. He's making more than that annually from twitch/youtube. Why would he risk that?
---
If they can call someone an SJW because the person they objectify doesn‚Äôt like it, we can call them incels. It‚Äôs all fair imo. Just ones a lot creepier and true to form.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say they‚Äôre the devil incarnate, but they‚Äôre generally pretty disgusting and them being allowed to marry is immoral and just plain wrong.
---
I'm lvl 89 slayer
---
Agreed
---
I would totally be down for this as well. If they would just try and hire some people from the community things would be so much better
---
With a black mask(i) it could be, depending on what you're fighting. Definitely less boring. Pures actually can't do fremmy trials because it rewards def xp so cannoning trolls is out
---
Yes. You not incorrect but you are not correct. If people are paying for a service and they dont like what the service is offering them (In this case paying for a product where dev time ^no matter how ^insignificant^ amount of dev time was used^ to promote something) alot of people have religious or strong opinions about it so its reasonable to oppose it.
---
Of course doing a KKK rally and spewing slurs is crossing the line and its fair to take action on it. I dont mind it myself as I have no feelings attached to it (I dont live in US or EU lol), but Jagex must know that its probably not wise to put in updates that the customers dont want (Jagex should know this by now)
---
But to be honest it was probably a pr stunt for publicity. MMK knows how a large minoroty of the OSRS playerbase acts.

Another vote for underground pass for me in terms of favorite! The first time I did it I'm pretty sure it literally took me an entire day. It was so hard but such an adventure. Me and a random stranger did all of it together because we happened to start it at the same time. It was a cool bonding experience because we would wait for each other to clear each trap and encourage each other. Great times!

Funny story: Haven't played RS for a couple of months. Logged in today surprised by an authentication code (didn't remember setting one). Eventually reset my password/disabled authentication and was able to finally log in. It said I had 14 days remaining on my membership (Did I forget to cancel my membership this summer I wondered? But I haven't been billed by Jagex?) I spawned in to what appeared to be a bunch of furnaces. I've never done smithing before, and all of my dragon armor was now off. I knew I've been hacked at this point, so I frantically went to Varrock to check my bank. To my dismay my armor was gone, I had about 15 mil worth of stuff but only a 4mil cash stack in the bank. I then checked my stats and saw I was now lvl 62 mining and lvl 82 smithing ( I was lvl 1 for both of these last time I played). this kid must have been using my account for himself, so now that I have it back, maybe smithing can be helpful? I'm hoping to use smithing to make some of my cash stack back but am completely lost. Does anyone have any tips? If it's helpful the kid who hacked my account is using an item called "ice gloves" and has a "coal bag", obviously assume they have to do with smithing. Thanks.

Best response so far. DS2 was so well made and hallowvale is so obnoxious

I mean there's no good way to answer.  I would bet they know CS sucks but don't have the resources to fix it.  The only answer is to stay quiet because anything else will start a worse shit storm

Jesus Christ. Its fun to meme about on Jagex support staff, but thats just sad.

I just got back into OSRS and decided to make an HCIM. Not far into it, should I just make it UIM and suck it up or no? Also, is it best to start off as f2p UIM or go ahead and go p2p for more quest variety at early levels.

Not very well. Saying "you don't PK" when you don't know me, or how I play is a shit argument. Anybody who PKs with a brain bigger than a lemon can tell you killing clue scrollers isn't worth it 99% of the time. Sure, there's still the 1%, but arguing that you get loot 80% of the time from clue scrollers isn't convincing anybody... everyone knows that's bullshit.

&gt; &gt; Do you know what the word holiday means?
---
Yep, pretty sure.
---
&gt; It's a stupid metaphor. 
---
It's not a metaphor at all. It's just 2 examples of holidays.
---
&gt; Christmas is a timeless holiday that predates christianity,
---
Uhhh... No, it does not. Christmas comes from the old english Cristes-messe which literally means the mass of christ, celebrating the birth of christ in christianity.
---
It was moved from early spring to late december around the 4th century CE by early christians to avoid persecution by blending in with the pagans who were celebrating the winter solstice.
---
Homosexuality FAR predates christianity :p
---
Pride isn't "a movement", it's a celebration of history of the lgbtq+ community, on the last sunday in june to commemorate the stonewall riots.
---
Just like christmas isn't "a movement", it's a christian celebration of the birth of jesus.

For raid, especially Xeric get bass 85 cb stats but get like 90 range as a min, since you use a lot of range especially at olm.

if he feels as though he's completed the game that would be extra evidence to point toward him rwting, being that he doesnt feel the need to continue anymore. However its just extra evidence and not proof. he could easily be lying about the whole situation or was just that stupid. I think he was just that stupid.

I'm not going to do that because I really don't care about the whole gender wage gap argument, I'm just saying you can't use the amount of terms used in a search engine as a basis of evidence. The amount of results returned does not imply whether they agree or disagree. If you decide to actually read them and see how many agree or disagree then go for it, drop some stats of how many of those 416k articles say there is a gender wage gap. 
---
There being a shitload of articles on something really only proves a lot of people are writing about it, which makes sense seeing as how so many people seem to be so triggered by it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just a username, but you will need to recover if you want to change your email associated with account.
---
I just stopped watching streams with the chat visible. It is fucking always the most childish, mean spirited racist and exist shit being spouted in every stream. I would love for just one streamer to not put up with that shit. But they all ignore it right up until the actual N word when they might have to sweat TOS. 
---
they left you your untrimmed HP cape. WHen i got hacked, they dropped my fucking fire cape and void sets. they literally wasted time dropping my untradables. 
---

Ya that‚Äôs what I meant speaking in terms economically and efficiently vs doing the fastest but spending tons of gp looting all four tiers

Hi jagex, to piggyback off of this I have 0 experience in customer service and I would also be willing to help. Let's face it, I can't possibly be any worse than the current system in place.

People do quit as a result of not getting the help they need though.  Like the situation where people lost their items because of how rolling back works.
---
This happens everywhere on the internet and in games, it sucks.
---
This guy's right, it's the cheapest option
---
Saw him at MLM a few days ago. Some level 60 asked him how he's played for so long yet isn't maxed and Sparc Mac just tore into this guy, it was one of the most childish things I've seen. Full blown meltdown. 
---
Shhh, go beg for attention somewhere else you incel
---
he doesn't take donations. other than "rares" Party hats etc for his collection.
---
Imagine the amount of basement dwellers you would deal with in customer service for rs. ‚ÄúUhh yeah hello jagex. YOUR FUCKING GAME CRASHED ON ME WHILE I WAS GETTING MY GRIND ON! I demand a reimbursement for my time wasted on woodcutting! Also nothing happened to my stats or anything like that. The game just crashed and restarted. Please do something or I‚Äôm quitting rs for a whole day!‚Äù
---
On the contrary, I enjoy questing *because* Slayermusiq makes them so efficient; almost automatic. What I wish I could do is re-play quests after I've gotten my quest cape so that after I have my unlockables that are pretty much necessary for the rest of the game I can go appreciate the effort that was put into them without having to grind the quest requirements over and over. 
---

how does someone type shit like this and unironically think "yeah that's a cool thing to say."

I doubt it as it has never been polled or anything, just an idea thrown around by the community

As I said "99% of people have dynamic IPs" I never said it's impossible to have a static IP. Regardless, unless you paid for your IP address (which you didn't as you just said "if I cancel my service and start a new one") You do not have a static IP address. That is completely idiotic for the ISP, as IP addresses are purchased in bulk, they sell IPs (Static) OR you are given an IP address at random when your modem requests one on bootup from the DHCP server aka Dynamic)

If you give that section a read, you'll see that untradable items, such as graceful and pouches in this scenario, will remain on the ground for an hour, even when you're killed through PVP.

That's not just the amount of terms in a search engine, it's specifically searching scholarly articles on the subject.
---
&gt;  If you decide to actually read them and see how many agree or disagree then go for it
---
They all do, that's the point. Because it's not just some guy's opinion, it's observable fact. There's opinions as to the cause, but not the effect. The effect we know, we can see it happening, we can measure it.
---
Scholarly peer reviewed articles are not just some blog post that can say whatever conspiracy comes to mind.
---
You do realize everything takes a minimum amount of hours and you literally have to spend that time. If Yu actually have a quest cape then you have put more hours into the game then me. I absolutely have a right to vote on something that will effect the game I play. So I can't complete a small amount of clues, doesn't in anyway exclude me from voting. Your arrogance is kinda cute though.

Just slap a quick edit on it and you‚Äôre good. Plus, I‚Äôm not inconvenienced. I‚Äôm just being a nazi.

Honestly, it's hard to answer, because since I was a kid way back and recebtly playing my first, main account, I really didn't like quests. I didn't hate them, but I definitely wouldn't do them. But, I did get my barrows gloves on my OSRS main. 
---
Then I did them on an ironman, and for me, that account really changed me. I don't know why, but doing them on an iron, I enjoyed them so much more. Most of my friends think I'm crazy for thinking so, but I learned that most quests
---
A) Really aren't as bad as people say, just like some skills (looking at you elf questline, was easier than people say.)
---
B) Made me pay more attention and realise the part they play and the life.
---
I've come to enjoy most quests now, in different ways. So I really can't fully answer, but perhaps a bit.
---
To my recent knowledge, Dragon Slayer 2 is an incredible quest, I urge all those who haven't done it to try and do it, the grind and frustration is so rewarding and worth it, MM2 as well.
---
But, I do swear by hating one small favour. It's not one, it's not small, it's spacebar stamina pot simulator. Very boring, very long in a sense, not a fan lol.
---
They'll never reply to this thread. Watch. 
---
If you're attempting to give validity to the advice of your post through the history of your experiences, some proof does fathoms. Otherwise you're just reframing advice everyone knows or should know, coupled with demands that have been asked of Jagex for months, if not years. 
---
all these kids mimic it claim they saw it on fortnite, my nephew and his friends + youtube vids
---
Yes, people can dislike the product they pay for, but if the reasoning is bad, then their reason to oppose that thing is bad. If people were upset about the pride event on the basis of it not being polled or very ‚Äúin your face,‚Äù then fair enough (I didn‚Äôt think the event was big enough to say it was ‚Äúin your face‚Äù). However, the issue with your statement is the ‚Äúreligious‚Äù reason. 
---
Now, for transparency sake, I‚Äôll let you know I‚Äôm assuming by ‚Äúreligious reason,‚Äù you mean ‚Äúopposing the event because they think homosexuality is wrong.‚Äù Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. 
---
By saying it‚Äôs ok to have this opinion (the one above) because of religious reason, then you are giving a free pass for discrimination. We don‚Äôt give black people free passes for being racist against white people, nor do we give women free passes for being sexist against men. In all these scenarios, people are discriminating on the basis of genetics, something they can‚Äôt control. Why should one be allowed if the other is not?
---
And yea, it‚Äôs definitely a pr move, but it‚Äôs better to ignore these pr moves. Otherwise, the outrage will just give Jagex what they want. 
---
If I already have over that amount will my next kill get me a tattered head?
---
Yeah, but I stopped questing to focus on skilling for xp lamps. I‚Äôll probably check out the rest of the Zeah questline.

wait, i've quit for awhile, just came back. I thought Dhide was always better than void post void nerf?
---
Invalid argument since it took me six years to get it and other people can rush it in about 2-3 weeks. It‚Äôs not being arrogant to say that people shouldn‚Äôt vote on content that doesn‚Äôt apply to them. Just like voting on changes to hydra, Vorkath, CoX, etc if you‚Äôre not at a level that can participate in that content.
---
Void is great for learning. Lets you work with fewer switches.

Yeah but his logic is faster kills = less damage taken and also more kills which would cover the cost of food anyway (bascially worth nothing)

As others have mentioned, some accounts are immune to the recovery system. You could try it if you really want - just go to the right jagex page and enter their username, I think b0aty is one and obvious other big name streamers.
---
VIPs accounts will get the message https://imgur.com/a/mKRFlix "YACCOUNT RECOVERY
---
SORRY, A PROBLEM OCCURRED. Due to your account status, you must start your account recovery from inside the game. Please launch RuneScape and click the forgot password link on the login screen to continue." (in which case they'd need to do so, which probably gives Jagex a LOT more computer info from the client to help them even consider the request, which would then be reviewed by CS or senior CS staff and possibly confirmed via direct contact with the account-holder).

If they were really going after the goldfarmers they could just go through all of them, give them the smallest amount they take (not take the real money) and just ban them and accounts linked to them straight after. It was probably just a really stupid mistake

You also still have to complete the clue, there is 0 time saved by stacking a reward casket so i doubt it will change anything. And rangers shouldnt be too hurt by it, more items in the drop table more rare the rangers.

the real question is why are you killing kq if you already got the head for the diary :thinking:
---
Why do you feel the need to make up bullshit to prove your point? Not too long ago the mods confirmed that nobody can change his password due to the large number of attempts done every month. Zezima has to personally contact jagex in order for them to make changes on his account. 
---
Good point. The pain was increased for me because i was overconfident and i never did the quest on rs2
---
The video does jagex customer support's non-existent job for them and also proves to the community that it actually happened. 
---
Why would they put effort into investigating an issue they can simply write off? A screenshot proves nothing hence the significantly less amount of community outcry compared to the first post. 
---
I like to imagine you talk like this in real life discussions too.
---
I need to catch up on him!
---
Or just have it not tele you on that side of them, but I agree that can get annoying.
---
I feel perhaps jagex‚Äôs osrs budget doesn‚Äôt cover a full time support team and the only way to keep the servers viable is to lack that component to keep the player base up. Somewhat of a calculated loss. Putting all the money into servers and devs. Leaving a mostly perfectly intact game that develops and grows to feed a demand  
---
Why?
---
Favourite: legends quest, because it feels so intricate and archaic with random messages coming up for doing anything

Least favourite: enlightened journey, that creepy hyperrealist bald old mans head will haunt me.

We need international laws requiring every single internet user use their real name, like in South Korea. We also need laws requiring that all computing manufacturers implement spyware into the bios, trafficking all data through relevant government agencies.

If you are caught posting subject matter deemed offensive by a government-accredited team of experts, on your first offense, your name will be added to a public database showcasing your hate-speech. Your second offense will result in a fine. Having not learned your lesson a third and final time, you will be placed in a re-education camp to learn how to property reintegrate into society.

For some reason, Jagex made me change the name of this account. Oddly enough, I still use my original account name to log in.
---
Wonder what else there is
---
I don't personally care about the story or anything in quests, so it's more so DS2 for its rewards after its over for favorite. 
---
Least is MM2 for that awful maze part. I put it off till it was my last quest for getting Elite Lumbridge done.
---
LOL that's fucking amazing. real geopolitical catastrophes affecting the price of dragon bones...
---
Yeah i really hate that tbh 
---
I really don't get why they aren't more Pmods. There used to be a lot of them and I think getting them back would really reduce the amount of spammers and spammers at the GE. 
---
My least favorite may just be Money Madness II. That boat made was absolutely terrible
---
I mean there will be instances of people just saying that because, well that's how people feel about certain things.
---
There will always be equilibrium in terms of stances like this because of the undeniable fact of the way people take on situations like this.
---
Some people take it ironically/satirically while others are serious and genuinely against whatever it may be. 
---
I personally think to those who are offended need to not be so quick to feel "personally attacked" but rather understand their viewpoints. Because it's in that situation people have irrationally thinking and overreact to something that they don't know the full impact of what it can actually do to those who are being "offended" and realistically are fulfilling those who are trying to make those offended uproar against them.

You should delete this. People can recover your account with this information 
---
[Meanwhile](https://i.redd.it/feasa3h69vk21.jpg)

I would like to add to this, ensure your email has 2fa and I just checked you cannot recovery questions which does suck.

Wouldn‚Äôt that be a shame? People want equality, then this is said.

Excuse me, sir. I've got multiple eyewitness reports that you've recently used the üÖ±Ô∏è-word. In compliance with this subreddit's rules and regulations, specificallt those presented in Article 4, subsection 14, I'm going to need you to present your üÖ±Ô∏è-word pass along with any other relevant documentation you may have on your person
---
the options are suffer in silence or say something, the idea is if you speak out it will eventually get better
---
Yup I have lots of wealth on my account and never been hacked. How do I do it? 2fa on account and email, unique passwords, bank pin. Easy as that. Never reveal my RSN on Reddit, don't fall for phishing links, don't share my account. Never get hacked with these easy steps!
---
What would happen if b0aty was threatened but decided not to give up his password? Is the streamer going to be OK?
---
So you're saying it's possible to login without the authenticator and then remove the authenticator?
---
I thought I would just waltz in and kill zulrah on my first attempt. think it took me like 10 tries
---
Can you please explain how someone can recover your account without you having posted all the relevant info online? I'm pretty sure it's not possible lol. I can't even recover my oldest account because I don't have enough relevant information and yet somehow all these people get their accounts recovered despite "never giving away information"
---
Please don't downplay the seriousness of this issue. Implementing that kind of system will just damage the website and drive users to harass Jagex employees' twitter accounts.
---
So why are hellhounds on every efficient block list? Hellhounds really aren‚Äôt that great of a task unless you want to do Cerb. You ideally only want to do Dust devils, smoke devils, Dags, Kalphites, Suqahs and point boosting tasks like Dark Beasts or Brutal Black Dragons.

&gt;Which is fine, but their primary goal as I said makes them kind of assholes. Its one thing to enjoy fighting people and getting a gp reward as a bonus for winning, its another thing to enjoy killing a defenseless person and getting a gp reward as a bonus for winning.
---
Explain how this makes any sense?  Their primary goal is to kill people, the only place in the game where this is allowed. It's baffling that someone would think people are assholes for playing the game as it was designed.  The wilderness wasn't made for friendly wager fights.

Very talented, nice job!

I'm glad i wasn't the only one thinking this. I don't know why OP thinks his involvement in rwting adds to the validity of his post. I'll eat my shoe if he posts even a sliver of evidence to back up this claim.

That being said, all the info stated in this thread is common knowledge to anyone involved in this community. OP literally just rehashed the exact same talking points, with nothing of value being added whatsoever.

maybe if we ignore the problem then there is no problem?

---
damn, alright thanks m8
---
Team raids are never no prep.
---
You need email access to do that. Thus, if you 2fa your email, or even just use a different password for your email, you won't get hacked unless they have enough info on you to use the account recovery appeal, in which case they will get in then be promptly stopped by the fact that it takes several days to remove a bank pink 
---
Do you really need to "celebrate diversity" by publicly playing identity politics tho?
---
How about raids 1 and 2 and use there? It already seems like need to get it.

You couldn't be more right - that there is an ABBSOOLUTE unit

Awesome, thanks.
---
What happens if your current phone breaks, gets damaged/stolen etc. 
---
Can you remove 2FA, and then put it on your new phone? Or do you need to remove it from the original phone first?

Yes. There's way of verifying his claims of being an account seller without giving out compromising information. 
---
And Sparc Mac is probably very careful about his details. He never interacts with the broader community afaik, avoids shady links/websites I'd imagine. Tends to result in auto-immunity.
---
Why is your hatred for women so extreme 
---
He wins/loses the same amount of stakes, how would he be able to win more than he loses? Why does he generally lose small stakes and win big stakes when thats always random. Even if he always double downs and eventually wins it back, he would surely lose if he goes on a big losing streak. And now with a 1% tax, he would have to have a system where that still makes staking profitable.
---
whos this? by god! its desert only with a steel chair!

Regardless, you have to be special to put out enough info into the internet that you can have your account recovered.

If it was as simple as seeing a username, no one would have t bows out in game or do theatre of blood or any end game content.

It‚Äôs a combination of poor personal security that gets people‚Äôs stuff recovered.

Your technical game knowledge is just ridiculous
---
All untradeable kept, some rebuild gear kept... looks very suspicious. Im not accusing you of anything BUT if i were to rwt my gear then id have kept all of the gear left in your bank for rebuilding.

Obviously its never worth it to rwt because the time spent isnt worth the little money you make, especially on an ironman, but you never know someones situation irl.

It's 'good' to see someone else dealing with the same as I have. I never share my account details and have all security in place (pin, 2fa, recovery email with 2fa) but my account still got stolen when i was on a break from osrs. It was used for 2700 zulrah kills before jamflex locked the account due to suspicious activity. I play it again now but im super paranoid it will happen again. The account will forever feel unsafe to me, which sucks since it is my first ever rs account (14y/o)
---
Damn he could get 200m all several times with that
---
Bro you literally gave your password to me
---
Source? Or memes?
---
"Couldn't be much more from the heart"
---
I was sorta wondering about this. Does this mean that they can still be used to recover your account, but you can't change them anymore? or does it meant that they're basically obsolete and cannot be used to recover the account?
---
To get the recolor and potentially a pet
---
Did not know about this. Just changed it.
---
&gt; So you expect them to list every single topic they are not willing or able to discuss instead of just avoiding the questions?
---
If the list is that long that its actually an issue...then why the fuck would it be called an "Ask Me Anything"?  Its pretty simple, if there are a few categories of things they are not intending to talk about in this AMA then simply post them or say what SPECIFICALLY they want "AMA" to be concentrated around. But if youre going to be very closed off about some VERY IMPORTANT topics that are at the top of many players list of concerns and have been for a very long time...thats a pretty bad look.
---
&gt; If Jagex had any updates to share on a Support revamp, an AMA is not the place to unveil them
---
This was actually so stupid it hurt my brain to read. Where the hell is the proper place to talk about them then with your player base???  I mean seriously what absurd level of mental gymnastics did you have to do in your head to ACTUALLY think this comment makes any sense whatsoever? Youve literally done nothing(and usually do) but try and defend Jagex and make excuses for them in this thread, which is quite pathetic and mind blowing, I mean seriously does Jagex pay you to act the way you do in this sub?
---
And the mere fact that Jagex DOESNT have ANYTHING to report on their progress with making very, very long awaited and necessary significant updates and improvements to their long running completely incompetent/useless customer support(and anything related, including account security) is telling in its own right. That indicates not only is there nothing that has been in deep development and has been a long time coming, but it also means its simply something that isnt at all high on their list of important things that need to be updated because they dont care. This level of **utter incompetence** has been this way for OVER A DECADE my guy, and youre sitting here making excuses and defending them...its incredibly pathetic, have a little integrity and stick up for yourself dude jesus christ. 
---
Not to mention, LETTING them dodge the questions is unacceptable in itself given how long standing and significant the issue is. They clearly need a full court press from the community to actually take the necessary action finally, so no they should be reminded and asked at every single avenue until they actually produce something proving they are doing what needs to be done. 
---
No way! as soon as I heard the audio, I knew it was you! Thank you for gracing us with your animation üò≠
---
I normally have private set to friends but I felt like messing with the dude cause he had a bunch of ppl that were going to get scammed trying to trade him. 
---
Kill lobstrocities or just wait for them to spawn at the seaweed patch area. Tho without runelite i can see it being v hard. Nice progress for a mobile acc!!
---
Just coming back from about a 7-9 month long break. 
---
Melee stats are mid 80s more or less. Looking for advice for what are best melee slayer upgrades. I have ~35-40M available keep in mind and am 88 slayer. 
---
Current gear is full bandos, whip, fury, d boots, barrows gloves + dragon defender. 
---
What is best to upgrade between:
---
Primordials or Torture Amy+ferocious gloves?  
---
I feel like the loss in defense bonuses from torture+ferocious could be scary but unsure would love some input. 
---
Or do I save for the new dragon hunter lance/ DWH? 
---
Thanks! 
---
I sure would have liked to see the post you refer to :(
---
It's a username for your Jagex account. 
---
exactly, but people who haven't played as much are getting scammed by this all the time. 
---
If they get a building to house their support time, I'd gladly work for their building maintenance. Can't help much with the game but osrs has been a huge part of my life so I'd happily be involved in some way or another.
---
Oh fair play man, not sure what your total lvl is but soon as you hit 1750 its scam free aha!
---
It's unlikely but yes, you definitely can just by clicking a link.  They don't even need to be .exe files, people can make viruses look like photos or videos.
---
If you know you're a target, like having a lot of RS gp, I wouldn't open anything anyone sends you unless they're a close IRL friend.
---
May I ask, what‚Äôs the satire or irony in the KKK cosplay?
---
O I see what he‚Äôs saying
---
I hear ya but I‚Äôm pretty sure others have played games with scammers in before and well as the saying goes if it sounds to good to be true it probably is. 
---
LOOOL GOT EEEM
---
Gz on 99 agility 
---
Be sure to report those fools 
---
What is the "correct" question(s) to ask, then? Only questions relating to "what's it like being a woman in a tech/male-dominant workplace"? Sounds dull.
---
Too much porn
---
my total is 1585 right now, getting there
---
Nice, good luck on the grind 
---
Loling irl at this troll post fucking skid 
---
Please don't take my gp pieces.
---
especially in this game, nothing comes without work or a grind... if you play honestly
---
you too my friend
---
check
---
I'd be happier that they saved who they could than let us all die lmao.
---
A better analogy would be if you and your neighbours house was on fire, you'd prefer both houses burnt down than having them save only one. Which just makes you a shitty person.
---
Yeah true unless you go buy your way in through bonds 
---
Anyone else just use recovery questions as second/third passwords? I've never used actual info there and only ever used just another 8 digit password.
---
This was after a childhood friend decided to borrow some items. Fortunately for him, he knew my first cat and his own name for "Childhood best friend"
---
Go back and read what you wrote. 
---
The link even looks legit is the part that confuses me.
---
I don‚Äôt share my account with anyone. I‚Äôve never had locked account issues. I‚Äôd rather not play for a week waiting to get help from jagex rather than get hacked. That makes no logical sense.
---
And All is Fairy in Love and War is one of the best soundtracks in OSRS.
---
Brother*
---
Motherlode Mine comes to mind.
---
That's what he's asking for. They're currently available on mobile, but not on the main client.
---
Who then fuck cares?
---
Damn, that's a lot of words to avoid answering a question.
---
Capitalization would only matter if your password could be bruteforced. 
---
honestly forgot about bonds. I think bonds, being microtransactions, are "honest" to the game in the sense that Jagex gives them out. So they aren't cheating, but don't give ppl legit gp either.
---
I think you've confused his satire with an earnest request.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal

Its hard to screen out the emotionally unstable people.
---
What's the story?
---
For slayer i would just use the points to get a herb sack, emblems for rune pouch , gold nuggets for gem back and tithe farm for seed box. As what the other one says about the slayer helm, dont wait for it, get it asap. Its the BIS for slayer.
---
Lol why would you dump it that low you can instant sell it to Chinese for .70 atm chinks are selling it like .90 last I seen
---
And it got upvoted, that's sad as fuck for this subreddit.
---
I swear, if you guys allowed working from home / remote working, I‚Äôd apply for a job in a heartbeat! I‚Äôm a fairly experienced Agile Product Owner at a multi billion dollar multinational finance company, based on the south coast of the UK, but couldn‚Äôt handle the commute each day and can‚Äôt relocate due to family! 
---
Will be keeping an eye out for if this ever changes though! 
---
Funny, I'm the exact opposite. I'm a dude but use a female character because I think most armor pieces look better on female models than on the male ones (except for Bandos but tbh I will never be able to afford Bandos so...:D).
---
yeah I'm for sure shithead when I won't pay you for playing a game on your work time 
---
Atleast you understand.
---
It‚Äôs a weeee but too saturated for this game though. Compare these colors to anything else and they stick out like a like a neon sign
---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** OzzyWozzie! ^(hug)
---
do you guys think ranarr weed will rise up in price in the near future? got a shitton of weed and i don't really keep up w/ updates so idk why the price is droppin
---
I'm not saying it's good pay or anything but ¬£20,000 isnt exactly nearly minimum wage
---
I understand you don't understand yes
---
My opinion on it is, stackable chests? Fuck yeah I'm down. Stackable clues though? No I don't think so. Like you said, it's a hassle to do them before getting another clue drop. Considering that you can luck out and increase your bank 100x it's value from one clue, a little hassle is not a problem. Why change it?
---
Great. 
---
Monkey Nuts is the next currency.
---
tell me there isn't one thing you could do to contribute to your workspace/coworkers somehow
---
Well that‚Äôs the longest wait time and is only for people who have been banned , the vast majority of which are absolutely correct. We do agree that it is too long though and you will notice we have now halved that response time to 14 days at most
---
Of course bots can read numbers. If you were the right kind of lazy you could make a script that inputs your bank pin
---
Lol I‚Äôm guessing you aren‚Äôt reading since you‚Äôre still here assuming the dumbest shit, I work solo, and there‚Äôs down time. It‚Äôs not rocket science, when my job is done there‚Äôs no more work. When there‚Äôs work I do my job. When there‚Äôs no work there‚Äôs down time. Let me make it easier for you. Job = me work. Down time = me no work have. 
---
Yeah, but with how smart this guy seems to be, it'll be regular ironman really soon.

/u/Mod_Stevew, how competitive are developer roles at OSRS team? I work in London in financial machine learning but want to know whether games studios are very popular. We hire around 10% of people invited on-site, many come from local Cambridge university. Do you have similar rates of hiring or are you even more selective?
---
boyfriend! :P
---
This is mostly true, but not entirely. All you need to do is run across a dodgy "friend" who will befriend you and slowly make small talk and get to know what your recovery questions could possibly be. Asking for potential emails, your birthday, and potential recovery question answers. This is especially more likely when you're an up-and-coming streamer who isn't quite protected by Jagex but is still public enough to be able to be taken advantage of in this way. We've seen it happen before. So what's the answer here? Don't stream? Don't talk about anything related to runescape or your personal life while streaming? What about those people who were proven to be hacked by an insider at Jagex working maliciously?  
---
Honestly you have to admit the system is archaic and very shitty. The burden of account security shouldn't fall on your shoulders entirely when their competitors do it so much better. It's their job to step it up.
---
Selling it wasn't the cause of the ban. Using gold from this for bonds was the cause of this
---
Lmfao 
---
And just to add to this, it's also checking to see if you're on the same device. So even if you're hacked less than 5 min after you log out, your pin will be active and your bank safe.
---
Yes it is. 
---
Current minimum wage in UK is ¬£7.83 (Will be ¬£8.21 in 21 days). ¬£7.83 wage * 48 salaried hours a week * 52 weeks a year = ¬£19,500
---
If you are unable to spend the time to explain something, it is obviously not that important. 
---
It only balances out if he does the same stakes, which he does not. 
---
Welcome in the world of favorism. There's a lot of players that have lost something due to the rollback (me included) but only a select few are lucky with their refund request
---
He literally begged for donations
---
&gt;you can expect a competitive salary 
---
Could you give us an actual salary rather than your opinion on the salary?
---
Because DUMB ASS. IM AT WORK. Lol I‚Äôm not sure you can read properly bro. AGAIN there is ALOT OF DOWN TIME especially at 5 in the morning. So yes I won‚Äôt be staring at a wall for hours. If you would just read (if you could) it would be so much easier to understand. I even simplified it for you and you‚Äôre still confused. At this point it‚Äôs much extremely happy you aren‚Äôt the boss with that comprehension level. You would probably run the company into the ground from not understanding the emails properly 
---
"at work" implies you're working mr smart
---
‚ÄúAt work‚Äù is exactly what it says. Whatever YOU think it implies is YOUR assumption. Smart ass. 
---
dumb much?
---
Well that's only for 25 year olds and the job advertised on the jagex site is 39.5 hours a week, so you'd actually have 7.83*39.5*52=16,082.82 and id say 4000 pound is more than a little 
---
Amazing 
---
Yes, yes you are. 
---
Can you find out? It would be interesting to know.
---
Minimum amount of time before 2 factor authentication can be disabled
---
This song is filthy
---
A delay on the removal of the authenticator
---
Right now, if a hacker obtains enough information to recover your account through the recovery system, Jagex will remove the authenticator protecting the account from hackers.
---
There needs to be a waiting period before that last line of defense is removed. The real account owner can still log into there account, and Jagex could ask them "Hey, are you trying to recover your account and remove the authenticator?" And they would say no.
---
Any reasonable person will doubt the whole 'being in the underground' thing because you provide zero proof but that's pretty irrelevant -- the information you provided is extremely helpful so thank you for writing this up. We all didn't know this info at some point, we've just learned how to be secure over several months to years of playing. I hope atleast one person learned something or went and secured their account because of this. 
---
Trying to remove it would trigger a wait time before it is actually removed from the account. Basically just like the bank pins.
---
The post is 39.5 hours a week so if it's ¬£20k/y it's considerably more than ¬£8/hour. It's probably something more like ¬£10/hr. If you're actually working nearly 50 hours a week you should probably quit before you get burnt out hard. 
---
Alright, thanks! I'll just stick to the optimal quest guide then.
---
Competitive is corporate speak for below market rate
---
Please don't fall for phishing links. Runescape never does 2xp weekends and twitch streamers are never quitting and doing giveaways
---
i was there!  i was the guy who was a rock :)
---
yo answer mr noobyy's question about twitter. (obviously jmods only come on reddit once in a blue moon)
---
nobody wants to use twitter 
---
Do recov questions even exist anymore?
---
Wow wtf lmao, thanks for clearing that up man.
---
No, individual salaries are negotiated on a person by person basis and relate to skills and experience offered by the candidness, within a framework we use to benchmark against similar roles in the industry.
---
So happy these are failing
---
Thats a lotta buzzwords fam gj
---
What does your quest guide day ? And can you speak to the gem trader ? 
---
Just as a sort of serious reply:
---
Jagex could very easily create a US-based subsidy(for payroll purposes) and pay someone in a low cost of living state(like mine or any of the ones neighboring me) $20-25k a year for a 40 hour a week online position. You could have most of the same CS qualifications as you already, and anyone with a dual monitor setup could potentially be available even more than 40 hours a week depending on incentives(maybe offer small bonuses based on number of tickets processed during off hours).
---
This would cost less than UK minimum wage(US minimum is lower, so even paying well over minimum here is cheaper than UK), which would allow you to hire more for the same cost while still retaining the same mastery of the English language that's hard to find elsewhere.
---
We are also pretty used to a 1st-2nd-3rd shift mentality in the US, so you could have at least a few people answering tickets at any hour.
---
I don't really expect anything to change, but just pointing out that the PR and CS nightmare Jagex finds itself in every other week is a self-inflicted wound.
---
Stevew, padding up your stats by only taking care of black and white tickets such as billing errors does not mean that your support is actually good. You're dropping the ball on actual issues, for which people have to beg on Reddit and Twitter hoping that you'll respond to save face once it gains traction. 
---
It is very transparent that the "amazing support" title is a lie and I'm sure that you're aware of it as well; we'd appreciate acknowledgement of your ill handling of those more ambiguous tickets such as ironmen being refunded items after the rollback.
---
Oh I'm blind. Yeah I support this
---
weird flex
---
&gt; Tends to result in auto-immunity.
---
Eh I think being one of the biggest and richest tends to result in immunity. Less than a minute or two of Google shows me a good number of credible results with his details, regardless of how careful he is... Doesn't matter what he does if it's already out there, like a famous person.
---
At a certain point the company decides that it's easier to shield these people rather than shielding everyone else - they are asked to protect themselves.
---
It would work like any other operation that involves management of anything. You have a team of say, 10 people with one team leader who reviews the teams mutes/bans, a group of 10 team leaders constitutes an area team with its own leader who reviews the work of the team leaders 
---
Your acc can get phished and then someone knows your password.. Maybe you use auth and 2fa but not everyone does. Also a week? When you recover an acc you get a reply within 1-2 days maybe max 3..
---
Especially because Jagex is notorious for shafting their software engineers, paying anywhere from 15-30% below market average. Even accounting for the troll reviews on Glassdoor, this is too widespread to be false. 
---
Even better
---
Go back to rs3.
---
This is just sad 
---
was probably a fake card they use to give sad nerds like you who want job at jagex because they can 3 tick lmfao
---
How does one turn on the valuable drop notification?
---
i think this one may be in part to me suggesting this to west when hati came out on rs3
---
i'm sorry everyone
---
They did have a lot back in the day. Not fully sure why the removed them
---
No, they don't count for the task or something. He mentioned it in the first episode.
---

Not at all, I stepped in when they were about 40gp each. Put them in GE for 90-100~ and let things be. Sold m all for 90 each so that was a small profit but still nice.
---
I noticed the high demand and played along to get a cut out of it :-)
---
Same with Cosmic runes on the recent automated enchant update!
---
It‚Äôs pretty common for the work I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm the general manager of a restaurant. 
---
How come? Stacking clues still increases the amount even if re-rolling wouldn't be possible. I could get multiple clues during a slayer task and pickpocket H.A.M members until I have five clues, both significally increasing the amount of clues I would complete.
---
Thanks for the in depth explanation. But yea, it is easy to understand why jagex doesn't refund items in RS.
---
What is your kc?
---
hax
---
Yikes... this is so sad man... did you really think this was worth posting on reddit?

There are a lot of streamers that heavily moderate chat to the point there's no racism, sexism, politics, etc.
---
It just depends on the game and size of the streamer. IE if you watch someone who encourages the behavior, obviously the chat will be toxic as shit. If you watch someone who just bans and ignores them instead of giving them attention or encouraging it, the chat is generally much more pleasant. 
---
With his following and the fact that his account is probably being watched very closely to prevent rwt, it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to me.
---
It's literally impossible to determine, unless it's huge amounts. 
---
If these accounts host a giveaway, partner with a twitch streamer, or give away something randomly, they'd falsely flag real players.
---
I really am giving this series a chance, and but wow it's really falling apart in the first two episodes. You are already arguing in bad faith or are just not very knowledgeable on the events that transpired. Yes, I have no doubt that there are insane psychopaths out there that will stalk you, bully you, and even threaten your death over the mildest things. I mean, I literally saw people threatening to slit Jmods throats the other day over making FTP2 a requirement for Song of the Elves. That being said, if you don't think these people are in the absolute minority of human beings I don't know what to tell you. These are deeply troubled individuals who have been given a platform thanks to this new age of the internet and social media. The majority of us human beings including the silent majority don't act or feel that way. 
---
I mean sure, a lot of people got angry when Anita Sarkeesian came in and started developing her series on misogyny but how many of those people were unhinged maniacs lobbing death threats at her? A few hundred people posting in a thread on 4chan? These people are deeply unhappy people in their real lives and have nothing to live for apart from internet drama so they are politically active through their trolling. Why do you think /pol/, an infamous board on 4chan, is always waiting for what they call, "a happening"? Because they want something cataclysmic to come along and shake up the sadness that is their existence. 
---
The majority of people who were angry with Anita were people who are entrenched in the hobby and saw past her surface-level analysis and wanted nothing more than to DEBATE her openly to put her research to the test. What better way is there to prove something right or wrong than to shine a big spotlight on it and use peer review? But instead of embracing the open conversation, she disabled comments, she hid from her critics, and she just kept on pumping out her videos and everyone outside of this "movement" took her word as gospel. Suddenly Mario was sexist, and people who had good arguments against her were marked as unbathed cave-dwelling internet trolls. How great would it have been for discourse had she done a live Skype debate with one of the logical "champions" of Gamergaters to get closer to the truth?
---
Not to mention the actual credibility of her motives came under fire when videos of her surfaced admitting she had never really cared or played video games much in the first place, after starting a Kickstarter stating that she loved video games having played them all her life. Pile that on with Zoe Quinn, the other big figure in the Gamergate debacle which accidentally slipped up and starting threatening herself on her own steam account on her Depression Quest steam page and you really start to question their motives here.
---
Anyway, I understand that your video series is less about Anita and more about the everyday, angry "Jack" that resides in all of us, but the issue is that you've already shown to be so misinformed as to blindly believe the (IRONICALLY) damsels in distress here, that it makes me wonder whether everything else you said is just a bunch of bologna here as well.
---
No, and below DH (94 HP/STR) you should be using OBBY/B-neck/Obby-sword BIS anything else.

This is satire.

Oh, all you had to say was "food industry." You guys are worked like slaves lol

Also to tak on. This kind of customer support isnt IT work. If you are interested in going further into IT you should look for positions that will grow your knowledge base in coding, networking, servers or something more specialized.

He was talking about question 7 and edited the comment.

I got my account back and it was there fault I almost started believing what you guys started to say shame on you :(
---
Yeah I got crashed @ Urinals the other day,
---
Ooh where's this located?
---
So thats why the price jumped from 194 to 211 gp each in 1 day
---
Easiest is coll, if you really insist on being a shitter you can literally just do nothing til wave 10 and it's fine. You should actually do it as well as you can cuz it gets everyone free points but it is theoretically the easiest by far. 
---
Def is hardest if you don't know what you're doing but use the "casual ba" defender guide and it becomes braindead easy. It is literally just formulaic rinse and repeat every wave. 
---
If you know how to def then heal is hardest. 
---
Yeah I tried to repress the memory of Jagex being dumb enough to hire anyone from a clan/community like RoT. They fucked up big time with that. 
---
Overall though I would rather have the exact "account security" that we have now and not have additional people access account information than to hire a bunch of randoms to try and quickly solve this problem and maybe leaking the whole RS database to some hacker/criminal employee who may try to get hired. 
---
Didnt know there were so many Jmods?
---
his bank is around 150b, but yeah, he got lucky on the big stakes
---
If someone gets done-over by buying an account from one of these guys, I have 0 sympathy. 
---
What do you wanna do? Chat filters? Mass bans? Twitch accounts are free, bro, if someone wants to spam shit they're gonna spam shit and if more people join in it's gonna happen until they're bored of it.
---
Yes #9 is only relevant if #8 passes. Still seems like most people vote no on both, ignoring the chance that #9 might pass.
---
This is but a drop in the bucket compared to what the Lumby/Al-Kharid gate guards are putting in off shore accounts.. 
---
That gate was originally free to walk through, the guards aren‚Äôt even from Al-Kharid and the money does NOT go to the government/Hassan. They‚Äôve just been running the scam so long nobody has remembered a time before it cost money

small correction: OSRS never does dxp weekends, and while rs3 has dxp weekends (for main accounts, never for Ironman accounts) there is no such thing as going to a stream or website link to activate dxp, it is automatically started at 1200 on a Friday and ends at 1200 on a Monday. 
---
The reason they are good against bruteforce attacks is they used to be done all the time back in 07 lmao
---
Completely depends on what content you want to do. 
---
Ba can be done on level 3's. Focus on learning how to play the game well and you'll be fine.

&gt;within a framework we use to offer a competitive benchmark salary against similar roles in the industry.

Didn't a JMod leave OSRS to stream because that would be better money for him then working at Jagex?

Yeah but eclectics could have risen due to the upcoming clue scroll update

That was an awesome swamletics pasta, it all made sense and didn‚Äôt feel forced

Yeah, but I guess that‚Äôd be the trade off for the satisfaction of working in the gaming industry

Yikes man....

Is your support team heavily subscribed? Bullshit..

Yeah, they should quit the jobs they're qualified to so because they have thin skin and are being verbally harassed for no reason. Literally flawless logic.

he could move it all in matter of minutes, its just the buyers are gonna lose it all

depends which server. some probably have better security than jagex, while others save them in plain text

Well there isnt anything wrong dont know why i need to refute something i was claiming . or did you just want me to say it wasnt wrong well there it is there isnt anything hypocritical qbout boting no if you dont use those spellbook swaps happu?

Quick questions (I'm new) 
---
I just hit 50 farming and I was wondering if it is worth planting avantoe over rannar? I'd know the xp would be better but does it outweigh the money gained?
---
Also do you cut down fruit trees after 1 harvest or do they get multiple "check health" over time? 
---
Thank you!
---
Check out we do raids
---
Yeah probably but there‚Äôs more younguns playing RS than you think especially with mobile out. 
---
HAM for easy clues.
---
Eclectic implings for medium clues.
---
Bonds are 6.99 so it's closer to 1250.
---
i thought my luck was bad with 150+ chests and 2 items 1 being karils coif, so it actually CAN get worse....
---
Google the slot you want to fill. The wiki page for each slot has a table which you can filter based on highest stat, so if you're doing something that needs slash you hit the slash button and it'll list from best to worst. It's not exactly what you're looking for but it's the closest you're going to get.

There is sexism all over the internet also. Youtube comments are really sexist too

About right, as a head chef of 6 years I can control my team's environment, so they will do their 35-40 hours no problem, and they're all happy with the salary I'm able to give them. 
---
My GM is good, partly because we get on well and he understands the struggles of working in the kitchen and staffing levels. Also partly because I leave him with little to no option when it comes to how many people I need in the kitchen at any given time. 
---
Since the ops manager is a university graduate with absolutely no experience in hospitality, it becomes difficult. 
---
My kitchen schedule is supposed to be something like this for an evening service:
---
5pm - 3 chefs
---
5:30 - 5 chefs
---
6:00 - 7 chefs
---
6:30 - 6 chefs
---
7:00 - 9 chefs
---
7:30 - 2 chefs
---
8:00 onwards - 1 chef
---
My budget allows for less than half of that, and I'm expected to have chefs come to work for an hour or less each night. Plus I'm only allowed to have 6 in total on payroll. 
---
I make the team happy, which is my main goal here, but it does leave me with a minimum 70 hour week for much less than minimum wage if worked out. 
---
I would rank them from easiest to hardest as:
---
Collector, Attacker, Healer, Defender.
---
Some people find defender easy, but I just find it frustrating sometimes.
---
You nearly fooled me...but not this time serene...
---
On a more serious note. This is awesome information for the community. Thank you for the effort you put in this post. 
---
You'd think. I commented this same thing elsewhere, but now that I'm working my way through my 20s, and have friends on either end of the 20 spectrum, and some in their early 30s.. it turns out it doesn't mean a damn thing.
---
I know people who are regular, go out and have a drink, come home to a wife and kids, raise the kids well, treat the wife right-type people. But the moment a video game or any sort of anonymity is involved online, they just become fucking shitheads. I absolutely do not get it.
---
I understand there's a slight disconnect when you're looking at text through a monitor, or someone on a screen, but people on the other end are still humans. And I say this as someone who was a giant fucking asshole-bully for most of my youth. It's not that hard to recognize the humanity of other people, but somehow, even the most down to earth, regular every day individuals fall into this trap of toxicity on the internet.

I don‚Äôt have recovery questions set up on my account. I tried to, but I don‚Äôt even know where on the website to set it up lol. Is it safe/safer if I don‚Äôt have recovery questions in place?

I got lucky, one healer got stuck somewhere so I only had to deal with 3, but I did miss a flick and got hit down to about 2hp with the healers hitting me, most ass clenching experience I had in this game.

I do I liked his trolling :( 
---
&gt; but in osrs you can easily make enough gp for a bond in less than 3 hours.

Even with the fastest money making methods in f2p OSRS it will take you 7 or more hours. And don't jack me off about you meaning flipping.

Quality meme
---
It's ok, the man children of this subreddit don't understand that a 'AMA' where the topic is women in the videogame industry, are obviously not going to throw the company they enjoy working for under the bus when it comes to their customer support.
---
Truth is, the only reason people need to use customer support is when they're being fucking morons.
---
Use 2FA, use a bank pin, use a complex password you don;t use on any other website, use an email adress you don;t use to sign up for websites that look shady or niche.
---
Hacking does happen, but it rarely happens on an uncompromised system and literally never happens when all of the above are in place. it's 2019 - You can't treat the internet as if it's 1999.

Why has no one mentioned anything about his name yet

Converted to usd with google. The official job description also says 39.5 hours. That strikes me as odd. Im in the American workforce for context. I am by no means familiar with Uk labor laws or wage standards. How ever as someone who hires for CSR reps I find it low.

I never even have the chat open unless they are posting a link to a strawme poll (which even clicking on their links is hard with all the damn spam).

Yes, perhaps :). Use bank pin auth and 2fa and if the acc gets recovered try to find all the old info you can
---
You can ask, but it doesn't mean they have to answer...
---
LMAO thought this was serious post at first.
---
&gt;So your point is that a game designer and a streamer make different amounts of money? It's literally an entirely different job.
---
Point is that if a JMod quit your company to pursue streaming because its make more money than working for your company, the salary you offering isn't competitive or similar to other companies. You don't hear about Activision, EA, or any other gaming company Dev leaving the company to start a streaming career for more money, yet a JMod did so because the pay was crap.
---
With a name like that, no surprise. /r/fuckramos
---
Chinning in Monkey madness 2 tunnels for sure
---
My god are you ever fucking dumb
---
On the development side of things I'd disagree. There are a lot of very talented programmers and designers at Jagex who could probably walk into most jobs with their skillsets, but it's the love for the job, the game and the community that keeps them there.
---
Imagine the merching possibilities. All you have to do is stock nature runes and then knock down the power-grid of Venezuela.
---
It was an AMA for International Woman's Day, not a general Jagex AMA. The place to unveil new company updates would be through their website or livestreams, not in this sort of AMA.
---
My bad
---
I agree with you.
---
However, I suggest to look into resolving your issues because it is not normal to worry so much over a game. Your obsession over issues like this is worrying, and this comes from a neurotic person as well. Tread carefully mate.

There really have been  a lot of new stuff so I'm not even sure I could remember it all right now, let alone give a proper description about every new piece of content.
---
The most important things: there is new continent (Zeah) and Fossil island and 2 grandmaster quests (Monkey Madness 2 and Dragon Slayer 2). There are few new minigames and tons of new bosses/monsters/skill training methods.
---
You can just add me in game and I will try to answer all your questions about new stuff and/or give you a tour of some things.

Nah, you're doubling down when you know you're wrong. Sad.

His comment had nothing to do with the women-only forum. He was making a general statement.

Ironic how you mention "fake outrage" when discussing a topic on women's issues.

Unique email and pass specifically for osrs and public always off, does wonders for acc security

It‚Äôs the olmlet pet with the dust you get from challenge mode, so they can change to the other monsters in raids

Gold hasn't been @ 0.8 in a bit
---
\+ he has **ultra bulk** gold so he'd sell at a huge discount
---
honestly he'd flood the (bulk buyers) market so hard he'd be selling at 0.2
---
bulk buyers buy a large amount of gold then instantly turn around and try to split it to smaller buyers they know. since there's not infinite demand, eventually no one would want gold. and of course, people talk, and many wouldn't want to touch sparc's gold

There's something in place for the crashed to prevent it - an instance. You run the risk of occupied worlds or battling for one. Explain why that's rapid retardation, when it quite clearly presents itself in you through the form of remarkably dense thinking.

Nice! I saw that guidance online to do that but didn‚Äôt have the patience to wait for 40 prayer. Prayer takes SOOO long to train.. I have like 3 more giant keys so I‚Äôll probably use them up when I get 40 prayer using that method.

They put all the gwd bosses and minions in one giant arena. Each boss is controlled by a player, battle royale fight to the death. Minion kills buff boss stats but only last hit gets the buff. It's a runescape moba.

---
I hate this and I love this 
---
Valid argument but not technically true, the companies know the risk too and even if they have the funds they wouldn‚Äôt drop 120K cash and risk having it deleted from existence. Besides most companies money is invested in their gold so they wouldn‚Äôt really have that much to pay anyway. Also forget about a competitive rate he‚Äôd be selling for dirt to unload a chunk that big, so he‚Äôd have to split it among several companies to get the best value out of it drastically increasing the chance of ban. 
---
10/8 me me
---
That‚Äôs complete bullshit, most companies certainly do not offer paid maternity leave and many Americans struggle to get more than another off work for vacation, it just doesn‚Äôt happen. The US also has inferior minimum wages to the U.K. and rest of Europe. 
---
&gt;If you are seperate from the content creator why do you both use W in place if all V's?  
---
Because it's a meme within his fanbase.  
---
Why would Michael type like that in the first place?  
---
&gt;To put it nicely, reddit is not like facebook or instagram. A subreddit's feed is a place for non duplicated submissions that only add value to the discussion. It is not for duplicated submissions without waiting a 'respectable amount of time'.   
---
You know this also applies to duplicate comments repeating the same shit over and over again? But yet you are unable to do it :-) do you see how easy it is?
---
Well you've come to the right place, welcome to Jagex's Reddit Service Desk, once the correct amount of upvotes have been provided a jmod may or may not turn up!
---
Didn‚Äôt black out that guys combat level, rip

---
I've done several demonic gorilla tasks. I feel like whatever your trying to show isn't explained well through this meme format.
---
I did that, but it doesn't mean it will work as it asks if the ban is listed as unappealable, which it is. I said no and submitted anyways. This was a long shot. I understand how the appeal process works and everything, but some people seem to get better results using reddit/Twitter. I dont think they'll unban the account. I wish they would, but from their point of view I understand why they likely wouldn't in a situation like this.
---
I would strongly advise doing RC in F2P above maybe level 20 or so. I think you are in a pretty good spot to go members now, it unlocks so much more content and leveling methods. 
---
If you really wanted to level your RC to level 70 in F2P the best ways are body runecrafting or water tiara crafting. The maximum xp per hour is somewhere like 25k xp/h and seeing as level 70 is 737k exp it works out to be 29.5 hours 
---
Youd be surprised. Email addresses. IP addresses which can be used to find your Facebook and address. Date of birth. Find your name etc. Where you live. Find old account names and old passwords.  Find the answers to your security questions. Aka name of your pet from your Facebook.  You can find almost everything you need to recover an account from a few leaks in the wrong places. 
---
Seems legit did you see how many are sold üòÇ

Can they use something more like AMAALAIDRTJCS

Ask me anything as long as it doesn't relate to jagex customer service

&gt; Can you define "rude and nasty" please? Many people, myself included, don't think any jokes are "rude and nasty".
---
Use a dictionary
---
Rest of your comment makes no sense
---
 '**Worry less about password complexity.** Jagex is surprisingly effective at preventing brute force attacks. My password is 7 characters and I don't worry about it. '
---
Dead wrong. Your password is send as a hash. In the event there is ever a hash leak your account will be the first one gone, they will break that in under 30 seconds and have their way with the account. Is a hash leak guaranteed to happen? No. Will it someday? Probably. Will a 20 character password protect you in this eventuality? Absolutely.

Quicker mage training methods are alching, tele spams, or jewelry enchanting. These can all be spammed and some methods can even be very profitable. 
---
But you do you, I train mage by combat too. Its just my preference. 
---
yeah I think its safe to say that after priffdinas/song of the elves that nardah is next in line since players have been asking/making suggestions about it for years. judging by reddit and the q&amp;a videos morytania, priffdinas, and nardah were the 3 areas that got asked about most and obviously jagex appears to have heard those requests

Shades of Morton is terrible xp/h, but it‚Äôs kind of fun once you get it down.

Yes it‚Äôs disgusting. Acorn is now getting that abuse and I‚Äôm not surprised that Gee doesn‚Äôt show up on stream anymore. Unfortunately for Acorn it‚Äôs her job so she‚Äôs going have to deal with twitch more often than not.

---
if you make a new gmail with 2fa for your osrs account which also has 2fa on it there is really no conceivable way in which youre gonna get hacked (assuming you dont get phished/ratted).
---
 the only way people get hacked is if they use the same alias everywhere and it was perhaps leaked on a database somewhere and they didn't bother making new passes.
---
If you're offended by this I have a bridge to sell you.
---
If you don‚Äôt already, add the 2fa on both your rs acc and email. 
---
just keep track of when 6hr log is coming noob. 
---
He created it over the course of 7 days and 7 nights

Wait really? From knowing he has 1711 runes instead of 17_1 runes
---
So did I. It seems like most people who voted no on the first one stopped reading after "if question 8 passes" and just voted no on that one too though.
---
Sadly there is a big difference between what one should have to do and what they do have to do. It may be frustrating playing in a system that is rigged for someone else but you're going to deal with it everywhere.
---
As Super Restores and Regular Prayer Potions are often preferred over Regular Restore it could be a case of "Zero Sellers and the only buyers had to drastically overpay." 
---
The daily limit enables you to sell those for 2.8b total however. So if that was a RWT item then I imagine the method involves an item like that.
---
I love it

Lol you‚Äôre an idiot, why would I bot or autoclick nmz? It‚Äôs extremely afk and I‚Äôm just wondering why I get autologged but I guess that‚Äôs how the system works. So yeah, like I said, it must suck for people who are doing challenging activities for several hours and get logged out

He doesn‚Äôt have to prove anything to you through personal anecdotes, it has been posted and prove time and time again on this sub. People have killed naked players in the wilderness that turned out to be uim for 100m pks, people have killed clue scrollers for 50m in tele scrolls because they forgot their book on them. It happens, and it‚Äôs been posted/reposted so many times that it only solidifys the fact that you‚Äôre a newfag. Every player you see in the wilderness is a chest waiting to be opened in a pkers eyes. Just as no pvmer in their right mind would ever leave a tob cox or barrows chest closed after completing a raid/run, no true pker would ever let someone escape. They just wanna see what‚Äôs in the chest too friend. It‚Äôs not about the immediate loot, just as it‚Äôs not about the salt and pure ess u get from cox runs.
---
The fact that you care about curses and name calling only validates my point snowflake :) 
---
Just let idiots circlejerk. Guy who doesn't even have a bank pin got hacked and I don't feel sorry for him because of it.

Yeah, Jagex doesn't pay too well compared to most other game companies.

Well, we don‚Äôt know what quests you haven‚Äôt done.
---
Don't tell u/JagexPoerkie about this meme

Right, and I've been using a different display name than my username since display names were rolled out. The problem is I used the same username on forums as my RSN, so it's out there all over the place. I was also a pmod for a few years, so my username is also on all the old pmod lists (which are likely targeted constantly) floating around.

Account sharing is against the rules, but Jagex openly stated that they don't care as long as you don't account share to do x. In other words, they'll look the other way unless you start doing stupid shit.
---
How people feel about the cape shouldn't affect whether or not people get banned for how they obtained it? If someone gets satisfaction from paying another to obtain the cape that's their life.
---
As far as quests go I only use slayermus1q guides on YouTube. Just pull up the guide on half the screen and the client in the other half. Man is the quest efficiency god.  
---
You're not allowed to account share for the purpose of creating wealth though. This many is making hundreds of dollars of these videos using another persons hard work and achievement.
---
probably username since people are dipshits and use the same password on every site which would lead to any database breaches involving their email to also give out their rs login information as a free bonus

That's good to know.

---
the reason was so they could sell display name changes for irl gp
---
Why are you the way you are? What is there to gain from this?
---
Sorry for your loss im gear, but O have to say that that kid helped a lot on your grind and Blast Furnace smithing is very profitable right now as a skill. Smithing adamant bars will net you a profit of 700-900k gp/h. When you can start smithing rune bars then profit surpasses 1m gp/h if done efficiently. Be sure to check some videos Blast Furnace to get an idea of how ot works and how to do it properly. Ice gloves and coal bag are definitely needed for blast furnace so don't drop them or destroy them. Good luck on your grind!

Ur not my dad

I mainly do motherload since I enjoy it more, and I make decent money, and I‚Äôm used to doing it on mobile, just wish that damn pet would drop
---
Caved in. Also the heart of gielinor and the swampy area with the mummies and scabarites got flooded. Rip in spaghetti telos
---
Are you talking down to the nipple king? 
---
Get 65 con
---
Say what comes to mind, I'll just see if I got it or not. If I have it all, then I guess all useful quests were done then.
---
Idk if this is something other people relate to but I couldn't do any tick manipulation or flicking at all until learning woox walking at vorkath... Took like 300 kills to master it. Went to do something else and realized I now had perfect timing on pretty much everything in the game since it's just about getting down the .6s cycle. Transfers really well.
---
When's it getting pmod?
---
Theres not enough context, how am i supposed to know if the people in the meme represent the player or the gorillas. Also even with the right context from other commentors it still doesn't make a whole lot of sense. If your protecting melee you're making a choice between two options in the moment where the person in the meme already committed to one girl before he knew the second girl even existed.
---
Stupid or just ignorant? Lol
---
3-4 sentences in a paragraph 
---
Demon Slayer 2? 
---
tbh i just do it to piss people off and it works alot 
---
Crazy 
---
Door should have said $11
---
Ds2 and MM2 have nothing on this quest
---
Don‚Äôt mix up those two varieties of lemon juice there.
---
Whatever, stay poor
---
Hey guy. Thanks 
---
High profile accounts are unrecoverable.
---
I remember (from the15 year video iirc) that zezima had to call jagex several times per week to unlock his account due to the ammount of people trying to access/recover it.
---
So basically if you are popular enough jagex will actually give a fuck about your account security
---
I'd love a high level quest expanding on the lore which gives access to the new area. If it was implemented today though I feel like they'd just overload it
---
As a 'solo' project of Ash, like with the troll quest, would be ideal imo
---
Tape over the lappy cam. Atta boy. 
---
Yeah I needed ultra compost and decided fuck it I don't wanna mine it. I check GE and they're listed fucking 95gp... I bought 1k in case prices go back up. 
---
Crazy, I literally just saw you in ge 2 days ago showing off my newly acquired golden chin and sire pets
---
Why do I need to gain something? What?
---
Thanks for the solid advice, sadly I am a Canadian. 
---
Sorry but I really don't care enough. I usually avoid this kind of community anyway. 
---
it‚Äôs insane how accurate this is
---
It's not inefficient, idk why they'd say that since fire giants have no magic defense. There's slightly better methods for getting purely magic xp like high alching but that also doesn't give hp xp so you could consider high alching inefficient in that regard.
---
I hopped like 45 world's on my baby pure and saw 5 people, this explains it
---
At least she's not making them FUCKING RAWWWWW
---
Is he winning because he has better ping? I‚Äôm confused on why only his character attacked in som of those last shots 
---
I think u need to step away from the game for a bit
---
Look up slayermusiq's guide on youtube and speed it up until he gets to that part of the quest. It's easier to see how it's done than it is to read it as it may be confusing at first.
---
North of werewolf agility
---
99 runecrafting before this quest? Damn I applaud you 
---
This was a request by somebody. 
---
Back to NPCs for me.
---
Am I trippin, or is the only thing different here some brush strokes? If anything
---
&gt;They can leave for better pay, but it's literally not even the same 'competition'.
---
I'm not saying it's a competition dumbass, I'm saying that a company that talks about paying their employees a competitive pay doesn't actually do it if they have devs leaving to pursue a career in streaming where the paycheck is uncertain and relies completely on viewer's generosity.
---
Do you understand now or you going to keep nitpicking like a shill?
---
Chicken thighs? Yum. Invite me pls.
---
I disagree, trying to put demonic gorillas pray switching in the context of this meme doesnt make sense if you actually think about it.
---
Monkey madness is easy
---
Idk where Jagex draws the line tbh
---
Never knew that. Interesting.
---
I know you're trolling, but maduro has the army blocking aid shipments at ports of entry with brazil and colombia. He denounces the aid as a trap as he uses state capture of the economy to finance loyalty from high tier army officials; allowing aid, especially US aid, into the country would disrupt his control of the army and therefore the country.
---
to be fair they‚Äôre lives are more important than yours, at least they can benefit society somehow and find ways to take care of themselves 
---
There's still loads of level 22 accounts at black chins. i did 350 chins in one trip on my main (level 125) yesterday and didn't see anything but pures though so no idea where all the main pkers went
---
Do you exist to ruin other peoples' fun or is it just a side hobby?
---
Try to claim any double exp? Go to any clan forums to sign up? Follow a link from twitch about your favorite streamer supposedly quitting? 
---
Dismissed
---
Yea basically it is at there discretion, it's technically against the rules but only enforced extremely rarely
---
Season them thighs
---
I bet there's no tape over the smartyphone cam though.
---
What do you get out of that? I get trolling people sometimes, but this looks like a full time endeavor  for you.
---
Ayy
---
I'm trying to gear my pure, and need ranger boots.  Is it more worth my time for my main to do Barrows (no diary), Infernal Eels, or collect + complete med clue scrolls?
---
My point was about other countries doing things better than the US does. I don't know if you're aware, but we might be on the same page here
---
This guy reddits
---
So now you wanna take his baby!? Damn I don't wanna imagine what cruelsome things you gonna do with that!
---
Sounds like a good trade tho, have fun :)
---
It's shaped kind of like Africa.
---
Did someone say memes? I like those.
---
You're gonna get baked beans all over your Macbook.
---
Can confirm. I know nothing but memes.
---
Didnt that one guy get told his package got put in the mail ‚Äútoday‚Äù like 5 different times on front page posts
---
Most battlestaff orbs too have shot up in price...
---
C-c-c-c-c-Crazy
---
And I just got massively downvoted in r/worldnews for daring say a post about Trump gets thousands of upvotes while anything about Venezuela rarely gets more than few hundred.
---
Think about that.
---
osrs.wiki 
---
I'd strongly advice to not dl any other rs related apps on mobile other than the game. 
---
Bro not gonna lie, got 101 CB. I‚Äôm 22 now and passed my ooooooold OSRS account CB by a lot. Sad thing is, as a kid when I played I got the firecape. I can‚Äôt get that fucking cape now?!?! I don‚Äôt have time to play as much because I‚Äôm always on 24/7 call, but man it‚Äôs sad lol
---
They wanted to go their own direction instead of just becoming an RS3 clone and I respect that. At least they've come back and started to get rid of the black tiles on the map, there's only a few left now.
---
I'll admit, minimum 30 minute conversation would ensue if she spoke Runescape back
---
Literally none of that. I barely even talk to anyone in the game
---
You mean Bus Jackson :D
---
tbh idk i guess the enjoyment of pissing people off is the only thing i get out of it like dont get me wrong i know its kind of wrong but i 
---
 like i said  its just the fact that it gets people mad 
---
That's bacon you idiot lmfao 
---
Initiate pures weren't weak in general. I remember Hiei the Pk was one of the best initiate pures from that day. I watched him slaughter people on the reg.
---
Yeah the babies work as well for dragon tasks
---
Quests for hard diaries
---
Darkness of hallowvale and taste of hope for ToB tele. 
---
My bet is they'll work on the final vampire quest and also finish the desert. Then 2020 will be the rest of zeah 
---
Was this really worth posting?
---
even crazier, that account only has chaos elemental. 
---
Anyone know what the fail levels are for Pollnivneach rooftop? I don't see it on the wiki. Only course where I can't find it
---
Why you have to get 200 QP is the better question
---
You aren‚Äôt allowed to buy any account assistance unless it‚Äôs bonds from Jagex.
---
I think you're right.  Imagine spending 160k on a lv 22 potion that doesn't restore combat stats XD
---
Silverlight, Darklight, Arclight, ???
---
If by kind of you mean 'not really anything like africa' then yeah.. yeah it really look kind of like africa
---
always the poorbies that bring up gold

I imagine they're being collected for wt botting

He doesn't take donations, but he's probably given away over 50bil to his viewers on stream. 
---
Im not the one posting cringey memes that all the sweaty neckbeards in here upvote, Im actually having sex with decent girls. Maybe you can try that out sometime once you get some real life social skills
---
Look up a caves calc. It shows every spawn and makes it a brainless cape
---
Don't bother. 
---
He just wants the attention. 
---
Ngl I thought the swamp area was in old school 
---
got hit by the ball?
---
I interrupted this guys skull trick once and he told me he was searching databases for my account and that he was gonna hack me and that I should just quit cause my account was his. He‚Äôs a fucking douche. 
---
Gus is cool af.
---
I would suggest a range or magic weapon effective at killing demons? Maybe a high fletching or RC requirement on the quest to create this niche demon killer. 
---
Black demons are the best GP task in the game. BI ww
---
He took 30m I believe and turned it into this. He's also given out probably close to 50bil to the viewers through his streams. I won 50m a couple weeks ago. Lost it at the duel arena 5 min later. 
---
Are you using the official website or a phishing website.. Are you sure you're on the correct email? Log onto the official RS website and check the few characters of your registered email that are shown.

2019 and you're still using rakes and compost buckets? ;P
---
Got em lol
---
You can't get Demonics with Konar
---
You're not allowed to pay for in-game content to be completed by someone else on your account
---
That is factually incorrect. Venezuela has accepted aid from various other nations, but refuses to accept aid from the United States as they have a history of "sending aid" and then funding regime change in Southern American countries as they have a reason to "protect" the aid sent.
---
What's the error?
---
Great design! I always come up with my own lore ideas while I play, I imagine you had a lot of fun making this and thinking about all the possible quests/activities you could do there. Ranoah agility course for a new graceful color would be awesome. Perhaps the demonic shrine could be a prayer training minigame, for example.
---
Na dude only pk when ur rly low stats. The fuck dick head???? Use ur brain?????
---
still a valid question to want to know how many people he's killed on the off chance OP kept count. 
---
Better shit on this guy though.
---
What's that program? Looks like music generator game from ps1 
---
I'm immensely curious how the "slightly decreased chance" of getting another clue makes it more rare than the "literally 0 chance" we have currently
---
Did you have bank pin, auth and 2fa?
---
Off the top of my head, there isn't any other MMO which is like Runescape that is still alive. The horizontal progression, the time it takes to skill up and the sheer variety of things to do make it extremely unique. 
---
What are the odds they don't reply to this thread?   
---
I'm going with extremely high
---
Nice chisel, I think i'll take it

Does anyone have a link to a music video someone made a few weeks back? It had a heavy beat the visuals moved to and I think was about big assess.  Zulrah was in it, a dude dragon claw speccing, the wise old man and Nieve.

Demon Slayer 2 - new anti-demon Magic weapon reward.

I‚Äôve tried it before with void and everything else max range bonus with 90 range and I just didn‚Äôt find that the hits were that great.

It's not the gorilla's prayer switching, it's the player switching his prayer when trying to guess the gorilla's next attack style.

But now that it's been explained it's no longer funny.

Depending on your + a partners stats, you probably wouldn't even need a group. My buddy is just about base 80s, and I'm around 70s for all mine, and we can 2 man clear Bandos for about 4 or 5 kills.
---
You got it homeboy.
---
Not vouching for the video series because I haven't watched it,  but defending Anita isn't disqualifying. She receives a ton of unwarranted and extreme hate. She's a critic, she critiques things and just because she critiques things that we like doesn't mean she's an evil person or deserves the treatment she's gotten.
---
Fuckin nit. 
---
Yeah but how are the shootings
---
That's a shame, let me know if you change your mind. &lt;3
---
the grinds just only started fool 
---
Well, it's a band-aid solution. A feature that MIGHT help temporarily when your account is already compromised. Mind you it does absolutely zero in the long run since, if someone recovered your account, they have sufficient info to make Jagex think they are the legitimate owners, so they can just recover it again and again until you're away from the pc for 3 or 7 days or whatever. Fixing the recovery system seems a lot more important.
---
Also, there are downsides to having it. People will get locked out of their paying account if they lose their phone or access for some reason. Literally no other reputable security service (Google, Amazon, etc) does auth removal delay, so it makes sense you should just follow their steps and fix account recovery instead. Stop the highjack, not the consequenses of the highjack.

Should be an insta ban or perm mute, reporting seems to do fk all

Well if you didn‚Äôt have 2FA on your email all they have to do is get into your email and turn off your RS 2FA. But it sounds like you died honestly lol

I take it you're angry because you don't understand the world around you. 
---
The term 'competitive salary' here means *within* a given field, in this case 'game designer', not 'game streamer'. Those are two different field, like 'Doctor' or 'nurse'. Both take an entirely different set of skills, to which they would be paid differently. In our situation that's coding (game designer), or entertainer (streamer).
---
There's a fuck load of no personality twits like you out there that could probably read a book and understand basic math (though problem solving I doubt), but there are very few people out there that can perform well enough at a game *and* entertain  an audience, so it pays more.
---
For a salary to be competitive, you'd need to be able to move through each field fluidly with no retraining. You could't pick a streamer out of a hat and make them a coder the next day without training them, but you could take an individual that knows code and plop him in a chair with a camera and if he hold the attention well he's suddenly a streamer.
---
&gt;Do you understand now or you going to keep nitpicking like a shill?
---
Did you eat too many paint chips as a kid? What product or company am I shilling right now other than common sense, which you could probably use some awareness of. 
---
It does restores combat stats.
---
Why do you carry your whole cash stack on you?
---
chivalry is dead
---
Yeah the cash stack was gone.
---
And it was an amulet of glory, my graceful cape, and boots of lightness.
---
What‚Äôs your budget? Wear tank gear plus trident if you can afford. Pray mage the whole time and keep going in and out (giggity) until they don‚Äôt Aggro you, and then run on the edge to Rex safe spot. Also, I‚Äôve found that most of my health (after getting to safe spot) drains from poison. If you need someone really bad message me and I‚Äôll try to help you this afternoon when I get home from work.
---
Yeah Vampire quest is next. They already released an entire town for it on the map that currently isn't being used. 
---
Interesting, I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!
---
Wow, this is a wonderful description of the game. 
---
I think this newer trend of players creating Ironman and Ultimate Ironman and accounts is great for the game. It will encourage more players to create those types of accounts and adapt to that play style; and hopefully that will encourage Jagex to continue making high quality quests and storylines. 
---
Please read the comment you responded to because everything you said was already addressed in it
---
Won't be the first time someone gets scammed this way.
---
Sorry for crap quality
---
my guess is another, but bigger, Zeah quest this September, Varlamore in January 2020, Desert(quest+map) in June 2020. There are three major updates per year in January, June, and September.

And the other clothes I was wearing was my graceful outfit.

Idk man if an Ironman or something happened to see, could be pretty useful

Yea unfortunately didn‚Äôt realize the bait until he replied to me again

The USA is the largest donor to the UN and other international aid agencies. The USA spends more on foreign aid every year than any other nation. It‚Äôs Maduro and the Venezuelan government who is refusing US aid, it was a joke my dude.

Favorite: Regicide. You go from what can be an infuriating area, that's bleak and annoying even when passing all the puzzles flawlessly, to a new bright area that until now has been completely locked to you. New puzzles and challenges, and still more to come. I literally did this quest yesterday, and can't wait to do the rest of the series! But work :/
---
Least favorite, rag and bone II. Tedious and annoying. Just doing slayer, and getting a bone drop every other kill. Have to waste an inventory slot if I wanna keep them from dropping.

Are you sure you're entering it on the real website?

Which Is understandable, but a highly upvoted question in an ama 9/10 will be answered. They can be considered either an important question, or a question that many people relate to in some way. It‚Äôs unfortunate that we didn‚Äôt have the right person make the reply, but it‚Äôs also good that that jagex is passing the message along to the right department (supposedly).

I would prefer a different combat style also as numerous people wouldn't wanna see another tier upgrade to Silverlight.

I mean the power jump from Darklight to Arclight was already drastic. It's even a common choice for a spec stat reduction at Corp Solos.
---
Maybe a Magic Weapon similar to a Trident. Fueled by either another Rune combination or a unique demon-related thing. Give it an Arclight-Similar special but don't let both of them be used together in a way.

Divine Staff, built in spell that has a max hit of 20 but has a special attack that halves demonic creature‚Äôs max hit for 15 seconds. Uses 50% of the spec bar and has no effect against K‚Äôril Tsutsaroth or any non-demonic creature. Same attack speed as Trident.

Some type of holy staff would be cool, and I agree it's fitting since OP placed a large church there. 
---
Based on other games I've played there could be two staffs the player can choose from, both auto cast like the trident. 
---
Holy and Unholy Magic? Maybe you get to pick a side in the quest and kill the demon or kill the prophet with the correct staff. 
---
Should evil Dave be included too, and what side would he choose? He's evil, but on shadow of the storm he's not "really, like really evil". Would he turn good or go back to wanting to summon demons? 
---
It might. Obsidian has roughly adamant level stats so an abby whip/rapier would pretty much connect every time. The extra def could actually help out.
---
Somewhat nonissue regardless cos the gear Settled can access is miles better then what Verf can get
---
There is literally no excuse on Jagex's part why there isn't at least an optional delay in the removal of authenticator. 
---
That character doesn't even exist though
---
Because there seems to be some confusion, the prayers displayed are the gorillas attacks. When meleeing there is a 50/50 chance that it will use range or mage. So to prevent damage you choose one and hope it's right.

Why do people still try to bargain with this dogshit EU trash company? I rwt $500 a month off this game for a reason because its the only thing its good for anymore. The game is not worth investing your actual time into because of all the problems it has. No auth delay, no customer service, mod abuse issues, no pay no gay, $11 a month for a fucking browser game. Get real. I'll be RWTing on this game till I die because of how fucking easy it is.

&gt;Not only this; but I remember MatK talking about this saying that they don't take strong action against account sharing as much if it's to do something like PK on or not do anything significant with the account. But if suddenly this second person gets a fire/inferno cape, or gets a shitload of exp training something or any other notable achievements then they do take action. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Nobody's fault but your own if you lose anything to buying a fire cape service of all things
---
They won't ban you for account sharing to get a firecape

I took those notes from a lecture but if you look up associativity and cooperativity there should be a lot of good info on it!

Blowpipe works pretty well if a DHCB isn't an optjon, but you'll need to take a BGS to reduce his def and pray magic instead of range or the dragonfire will ruin your day.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard, but didn‚Äôt know if it was more effective with the salve amulet ei. Thanks for linking the calculator! I messed around with it, but I think I messed something up. I input all my gear at stats and my karils setup was more dps, but then I changed my range to 99 and it was still better than void so I must have did something wrong. I also didn‚Äôt see an option for a bgs spec, just a dwh. I‚Äôll keep playing with it, but thanks! 
---
Not too surprising, I don't think it's gotten a graphical update on rs3 since it came out so you probably have it in your head as looking like an oldschool area haha
---
at this point why even play the game
---
Lmao this is absolutely hilarious. Of course you're the type of person who makes several throwaways to harass women online (only female contact I'd imagine), and you're also ignorant of IP bans. That being said, you're probably the type of person to use proxies to make multiple accounts from different addresses so you can make sure you still have some female interaction in your life. Imagine living like this.

I would assume they give these players a physical key fob for authentication so to gain the account password you flick a button on the physical device that it next to you and it supplies a password. Neither streamer have mentioned how it‚Äôs unrecoverable before, so I‚Äôm assuming an nda was signed so regular players dont get salty their accounts are less secure. #streamerfavoritism 
---
Have you ever talked to someone who loves to gamble? They'll tell dozens of stories, and in each of them they won huge, they were on amazing streaks, they could just never lose.
---
But they never talk about the thousands of time they lost money.
---
---------------------------------------------
---
That's kinda similar to what happen here. Sure, they might have gained access to an account that wasn't active in 10 years, and who didn't have an authenticator, and who's password was "password", but they'll never mention those details. They'll act like they could do it to anyone, any time, and place. They'll act like "they could just never lose".
---
Then people will act like the sky is falling and the world is ending. Because that's the narrative people like.
---
No. You‚Äôre commenting that because you think it‚Äôs a cute lil reassuring thing to say to OP. It didn‚Äôt happen. Sorry.

Aside from everything that's already said, which you should already be doing, be wary of social engineering. This has become a big problem. Even in real life.
---
People friend you, you both start talking, become good friends. Throughout the many conversations, they get some of your private information that could be used to recover your account. Information like where you live, where you made your account, how long you've been playing, your ISP, device information, etc. etc. etc. The more players can get off you, the more likely they will be in recovering your account.

Ive tested this to make sure im not making false claims, and it did not send me an email confirmation. Either way, i think email confirmation also is a bad way to go. It should reauire 2fa to remove 2fa

You'll be fine with those stats. Make sure to be aware of the mechanics, like has already been mentioned, and bring ruby bolts (e) with a diamond bolts (e) switch for the last phase. I think I bought about 400 ruby and 100 diamond, and that was more than enough for all of the attempts it took me (can't remember exactly, but pretty sure it took me between 5 and 10 attempts). Also, super antifires don't work against Galvek, so you need to have an antifire potion and a shield or you'll get wrecked.

This is why everyone continues to say your customer support is horrible. Because, you don't have near enough people to manage the workload for the company and it frustrates people when they lose their account/items and you take a month to reply to them and solve their issue. Also, having a workcenter in a foreign country instead of just Cambridge will enable the company to have a better response time and lengthed work time (roughly 15 hours since the time difference will mean more things getting done in a single day instead of coming back to it in the morning.

Never in my life have I read somebody as stupid as you make statements that have no backing at all. This is probably why you may want to avoid talking on topics such as this in the future.
---
First off I just want to see that Maduro is quite literally a democratically elected president. So that already removes a huge part of your whole argument.
---
Secondly, newsflash - this is how a big state like the US spreads their power. Through an embargo the US is simply attempting to establish control over Venezuelas oil (which has reserves twice as high as Saudi Arabia). You think the Venezuelan currency is quickly inflating due to it not being backed?
---
This is what happens when you listen to the mainstream media who only cover one side since they are paid (literally - who do you think purchases ad time?) to do so. You've probably seen anti-Maduro riots, but where are the riots that are pro-Maduro with 500,000+ in Caracas? More than half that country is Mestizo (a combination of african, european and maerican indian), yet the Guaidos entire party is white.
---
Maybe you really think Venezuela is starving too when most local supermarkets in Caracas are fully stocked, just [go look at a Max Blumenthal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbXqGiNlWWw). 
---
Imagine Nancy Pelosi randomly declaring herself president. That's pretty much the equivalent of the current political status of Venezuela.
---
So again, don't talk on a topic if you so apparently don't know it. 
---
Hopefully you didn't do it from the compromised computer...

I'd say it is a 50/50; maybe 60/40 or such. For following 2018's additions of the last of Feldip, Morytania, and Weiss, the biggest expectations were Varlamore to finish Zeah or Menaphos to finish the Desert. Instead, we got part of Zeah with Kebos and Prifddinas, which was filled in but not really.
---
So it is possible that next year we may see more with Zeah and Varlamore or the Desert and Menaphos, but it is probably more likely be the Desert. The a big reason is that 2019 did see a Zeah update so two years in a row may be seen as too much. But the main factor is that Mod West wants to address the issues in Kourend before moving to Varlamore and the Hosidius rework has been taking longer than originally planned; even if we do get it in March, he plans for a similar rework of Lovakengj and Arceuus and that may not be far enough along for them to be confident to pitch Varlamore for RuneFest.
---
But it is also possible that we will see both next year, like how 2019 has Zeah and Prif. Though I doubt they'd do the full Desert and the full Varlamore in the same year since both are massive region expansions. But we could get the full Desert and perhaps part of Varlamore; the entire Kingdom of Varlamore is probably a bigger task than the missing areas of the Desert so multiple releases wouldn't be a bad idea.

The only reason you need to block out your personal info in a screenshot is if you use the same email / username / password elsewhere, which you should never do. Database leaks are how you get pwned while never actually been phished or compromised in any way.  Don't use the same password or email for your rsn that you've used anywhere else.

I try to find ways to play that are fun, and this is something I‚Äôve stumbled upon that makes me extremely excited to play again.

I LOVED playing when I was going for my quest cape. When that was over, I didn‚Äôt really know what to do. But I found a way to play again, and I am beyond excited. Hope you can give the series a shot!

Can you give me one good reason why i would lie about it? It‚Äôs not a scenario of I lost my stuff please help, it‚Äôs not me upset that I got hacked, I literally didn‚Äôt lose a thing to this idiot of a hacker. I‚Äôm simply saying even though I had the security in place that everyone says to have, I was still able to get hacked via email. I‚Äôm also not making up some story off the top of my head here, if you care enough about it I‚Äôve probably told this story 5 or 6 times throughout my post history. If anything I‚Äôd just love to know how you get past email 2FA without it triggering, because that‚Äôs the security point that failed and negated everything else.

I am truly thankful that you watched it with an open mind. I didn't believe it was some magic world view changer just that it had impacted mine like when I posted it. After all if I agreed with everything in this video I would simply just be a sheep. It's just that there was enough in this video that really made me rethink my alt-right roots and move towards the center.   
---
I will tell you one anecdotal though because I always found it funny. When I was full on republican I was also called a SJW, white knight, libtard and after I moved to the center I have been called red piller, incel. I hate the reactionary ultra far end of both sides because they unironically feel closer to one another than they do the center.

 What built my current views is a combination of Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, this 'angry jack' series, Destiny (streamer), [Hbomberguy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8dfiDeJeDU), and recently [Contrapoints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2briZ6fB0), NPR radio. 
---
If you're wondering what I followed back when I was alt-right I guess I wasn't thaaat extreme because it was a combination of Christopher Hitchens, Rush Limbaugh, TheAmazingAthiest, Sargon of Akkad, Thunderf00t, Armoured Skeptic. 
---
I don't know what would make you think what I said is not from my heart but I am glad you gave it a good shot. I hope that small spiel helps you understand where I'm coming from now and why I like the 'angry jack' series. Finally, I recently had to do an ethics paper on "where your current views came from" since I've returned to college so the only reason I have this list available is because of that :P
---
Thanks for being respectful and I hope you have a good day.

Meh, I realized that after getting 74 prayer and using a dex scroll  LOL! all good though,  it may be a main eventually

You could try "ffdn36" (stands for fast free double nats). I used to run nats with them a few years ago but prices dipped to the point where it wasn't really worth it. And then ZMI became the main training method so the abyss isn't too busy these days.

I think the quest cape actually requires more xp than a single 99, which technically makes it more time-consuming than even the fastest 99s.

---
probably a database leak. you used the same password on runescape as some other account somewhere, no? target card, playstation network, anime website...whatever. their database gets leaked, it's the same password/email as your rs account, boom. this is why the advice "use unique passwords" is given. this is all assuming you are telling the truth in that you haven't touched the account in years.

This is no longer a private dispute when someone commits a crime by knowingly make fake police reports. A Friend would not be as underhanded as his ex if he turned her in as the crime really happened and he has evidence.
---
&gt; but the cops in my state in the US would laugh in my face and tell me to sack up.
---
There is no penalty in trying to report a crime as long as you have evidence. But you are letting the suspect get away if you don't report at all.
---
Well some items are so rarely traded like flatpacks that you can just buy every one that is sold so nobody is interuppting you from rwting
---
Tip: hold down escape key, so it keeps opening and closing. Then just spamclick(i suggest setting up 5 on numpad as left click) and you will automatically open every pouch you get.

If life in Venezuela is so good, why is gold farming better than most other jobs? You almost sound like you're trying to say Venezuela is fine and it's the fault of the USA that life there is shitty.

Yeah, so if you were selling a flat pack for 2m (or in this case a restore for 160k) it would have been bought 
---
Eventually it will serve as his downfall it might burn people out even if they enjoy the series
---
Jagex also tracks the computer you play from and off you it gives you a higher chance to recover the account iff you do it from the same computer. This test is not representive to a hackers attempt. Just saying
---
The law is about evidence. His ex cannot provide an single shred of evidence that A Friend assaulted or threatened to assault her, while he has evidence that she threatened to call the police on him for no offense whatsoever in the stream. It's not 100% clear but the odds are still on A Friend's side.

First, the method you just used is called whataboutism where you attempt to disqualify everything I said by using a popular viewpoint to contast the facts. Imagine if I made the same argument - a bunch of continental Europe has a minimum wage below 500‚Ç¨ a month which with current prices is around 700-800m gp aka easily achieveable. Nobody thinks the life there is good either, yet you totally didn't highlight that, cause it doesn't fit your agenda.
---
Second, it appears that you clearly missed the part where I said that the Venezuelan currency slid as a result of the embargo. When in October 2016 the minimum wage was increased by 40% to 67$ a month, just in January 2019 the minimum wage was increased by 300% to 6.70$ a month. In just over 2 years, the minimum wage decreased by 90% since the inflation kept eating at it. 
---
I don't understand people to understand this, especially if you have no economics degree, but I'd argue it's easy to understand how foreign currencies work, especially if the currency isn't fixed.

Ha ha PENIS LE
---
well i didnt say it was the cheapest to use, using tarromin tar with a red sally is 10x cheaper than harralander tar with a black sally (1gp/tar vs 10gp/tar) but the red sally isnt better gp/hr.
---
just punching everything with protection prayers up + using only home and minigame teleports and walking to get to clan wars and back to barrows anytime you ran out of prayer would be free. thats cheapest option but clearly not the best gp/hr
---
barrows are relatively low hp and def and most of the time is running around, the time saved by the trident/toxic trident/sanguestini staff is not nearly enough to make up for the 3 orders of magnitude more cost.

Wtf is a blood rain
---
sadly jagex is too busy drowning us with unnecessary QoL and unnecessary new continent 
---
Just because you aren‚Äôt buying it with real money does not mean you are not supporting them by buying the bonds for gp.
---
You‚Äôre right though, I am trying to prove my point, but if I was lying that means I wouldn‚Äôt believe ‚Äúmy point‚Äù is true anyway, and then I wouldn‚Äôt bother caring. I‚Äôve already admitted most every hacking is often due to the victim making mistakes, but there‚Äôs always going to be exceptions. 
---
The same goes for false bans, 98% of botting/rwt bans are going to be accurate. There will be exceptions and occasionally innocent people will be banned. I‚Äôve also discussed in the past on reddit how I was banned about 3-6? months into OSRS being launched for macro gold farming. It was a shitty account, it had minimal wealth - maybe 600k at the time. Less than 1k total for sure. I tried and tried but never got unbanned. Quit for a long time, made a new account eventually. Fast forward a couple years later and I tried logging into my old account to find it had been unbanned out of the blue for no reason. This one is more upsetting mostly because I missed out on some of the best days of OSRS all because of a mistake on their end. 
---
And no, you don‚Äôt have to believe that story either, though I assume I could screenshot the ban/appeals/unban if it would help. My whole point here is that Jagex makes mistakes sometimes, Jagex isn‚Äôt always doing their best, and innocent people who do nothing wrong will sometimes get hacked/recovered/banned and it isn‚Äôt just a meme or crying wolf. 
---
No i just can't deal enough damage before I run out of food because my RNG feels like it has aids
---
You‚Äôre making these kids fap with these drawings , great artwork.

honestly I can‚Äôt be mad, you called me squirt and that was funny lol
---
He most definitely doesn‚Äôt mean after taxes lol 
---
I also would like to know how to do this on iPhone 
---
Then what can Jagex do about Twitch? I'm sure they've contacted them before. It's really easy to make a twitch acc and buy a view bot.
---
Also these streams only phish. With auth you prevent these hackers from logging on your acc.
---
You seem to be hacked through MALWARE. Im not sure how many times I need to tell you that. Go look up what it is. Get an anti virus scanner etc
---
No, because the way they worded the title implies they made it recently. 
---
Maybe a good idea. Might try something similar to that tomorrow. Thanks for the inspiration. :)
---
When you get banned tomorrow and all your gp is gone don't be suprised.

Ah didn‚Äôt think of that. Man the gp wasted using that over occult tho haha. Guess you pay to afk tho

You get 20k attack xp from doing the Knights Training Ground after the quest, which is needed for Piety.
---
Seems trustworthy. 
---
So you're suggesting....?
---
The problem with that is, I have absolutely no idea how account recovery works anymore. I know I can't look at the questions I set ages ago and it is something I am slightly paranoid about. My suggestion would be to make a new email and link that to your account, perhaps message "support" and tell them that your old email was compromised
---
what cape is that?
---
I do it manually. I chose to limit myself. 
---
&gt; you can't stand letting the other side boost themselves up. 
---
That'd be because one side needs to be boosted up, and one side does not need to be boosted even further, as they're already vastly benefited. 
---
Think of it like a point system. If men start out with 100 points, and women have 80 points. If a day to promote equality for women gives them 5 points, how exactly does giving a day to men to boost their points by the same amount help equality? It doesn't. It promotes the status quo, which inequal.
---
Giving both sides the exact same thing when they start from a position of inequality does nothing to address the issue.
---
&gt; That's sexist and selfish.
---
Is it? Because I'm a straight white male, that supports advancement in women, gay rights and racial inequality. 
---
Care to explain how exactly that's "selfish"?
---
&gt; You're too dumb to realize the hypocrisy.
---
You getting angry and lashing out doesn't change anything.
---
According to Runescape historians, the definition for the term "hack" or "hacked" has been lost for centuries! Now the current inhabitants use it as slang from "I watched that YouTube vid" to "It said free firecape!"

No, it just means that you have higher chance for a rare

Both to be honest.  Ironmen can pick Poison Ivy for Calquat payments as well as Whiteberries for werblore xp.  Main accounts can make a lot of money too from exclusively picking the Whiteberries, especially if you have a patch in every spot

Yeah I loved gem mining, did it til about 72 mining and thought the exp was very decent. Profits aren't as high now, topaz and diamond were 4k, rubies 2k+ and emeralds and sapphires 900-1k. Shame the prices dropped so hard, was hoping to mine some after getting karamja gloves3 but haven't...

Scrap most of the new TT item suggestions, keep ones that are useful like the Fremennik Kilt with the +1 str bonus. Instead, make most of the new TT items ornament kits for existing items. People want these and will be valuable for a long time. Nobody wants useless cosmetic shit they will never wear.

Depends on how they do it. Back when they added elite clues they increased the chance of getting a rare so that the drop rate of any individual item stayed the same. I'm not sure if they did that when they released master clues too.

If men said no to an international women's day, there would be outcries all over the world of sexism against women.

So you're legitimately going to tell me that doing the reverse would not also be sexist? How can you possibly think that. Its ludicrous. An international mens day would not devalue women and to say that it can't happen would be extremely hypocritical and sexist.

In my experience, norm trident gets just about double the chests per hour that black sally does, and also makes killing brothers fast enough that you never need to use any supplies, no prayer pots or food. Its a difference of making an extra 750k gp/hr, at a cost of what, 100k to buy runes for 1 hour? Net gain of 650k.

Think about it. Spending xxx hours for gp on a game is actually playing the game and is a reward of its own. The other nibba bout to spend real life cash on a game to spend xxx hours to get 99 in a boring repetitve action skill. Whats more fun, bossing or bank standing 99 herb.
---
this is wrong it does impact the rate of other items such as ranger boots, just as it has in the past. 
---
you still get the same number of item rolls per clue, and theres more items on the table to roll from, so the chance of a specific item goes down.
---
delete this

You have a point. I see a lot if high rank people (like jase) spending tons of gp to train something like rc. While jase is make the cash on his alt. I‚Äôd imagine others would choose to ‚Äútake donations‚Äù like randy or even buy gp.

Using account recovery questions as a second password is a smart move to prevent social engineering from stealing your account. But what if you stop playing the game for a while and really forgot your password and want to recover your own account?

You can distill it and drink it and that's certainly doable in a desert

this isnt 1.6m/hr making the actual tabs is 1.6m per hour, but you need to factor in the time to get the blocks originally

Might want to bring 1 more brew over a restore imo, most of it is just prayer flicking anyway. You're going to die a lot so the best advice I can give you is to just keep trying and focus more on learning the waves so you dont burn out because you dont make it to zuk, because that'll take a while. Also dont be stingy with brews. Good luck!
---
You just ignored everything I said. The authenticator is AUTOMATICALLY removed if the account is recovered. I never need access to your email. 
---
What is this in reference to?

i got rune med first kill and dragon def 6th kill feels good man

Except that‚Äôs not how probability works - you could do the reverse and say you have a 25% chance of losing after your second bet when it, in fact, remains 50%.

I can't speak to the RS3 community, but OSRS has a pretty large bro-man-man-bro community that is unappealing to me as a male player. I can only imagine how women feel when trying to play or interact with the community.
---
Because if she didn't the entirety of the subreddit a would revolt over them not answering the question. Jagex is fucked by the community if they don't and if they do.
---
&gt;I didn't play on my zerker(the banned account) or my other 2 for months before the ban happened
---
Doesn't matter, they do bans in waves so chances are you were flagged way before the actual ban.
---
&gt;But unless if you're a streamer or rant on reddit enough you don't get shit and that's unfortunate.
---
Everyone who rants on Reddit about being unfairly banned end up just having their bans confirmed. Sorry bro you were botting and got caught.

It's worse than a non-response imho. They acknowledged they've known about the problem but still haven't said shit about it.

It's called PID, or Player ID - it pretty much determines who goes first when attacking. That's why you'll hear pkers or stakers say "it's my pid" or "pid swap" or something similar.

Nobody is arguing against it. I'm just saying the gif doesn't make sense

It‚Äôs not about micromanaging, it‚Äôs game integrity. It‚Äôs either you have what it takes to get the cape or you don‚Äôt. They need some elite equipment that isn‚Äôt locked behind mum‚Äôs credit card.

I know but everywhere I seem to look everything checks out possible 3rd party client issue maybe.
