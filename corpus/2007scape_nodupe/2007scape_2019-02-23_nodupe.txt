becvause isnt that apart of the appeal to UIM? having to manage the little space you have? i dont see ANY benefit to making caskets stackable besides  dopamime while they are a few negatives out there

If they do this Jagex should make some unique models for the other 2 gods. The basic reskins are kind of boring, Im sure the art team could come up with something cool.

What about rc tho

Bwana is what Karamjan NPCs call you, similar to how black people call their friends the n word, adding the r makes it a hard r
---
No.

---
The others must feel my pain.
---
Honestly that'd probably motivate me to do more clues, but I kinda like how accessibility works on clue scrolls. It forced me to do a relatively necessary quest at least.
---

Doubling. Your attention please! Everybody in this g.e come trade with me. Give me 10 gp, get 2 for free. I'm a nuisance, pmods, they mute me!
---
You see I don’t understand that, when I get a totem piece I bring it to my bank so I can make a totem and collect more but I still do the dark totem in between kills. I love the fact I can still work towards getting another totem if I don’t quite feel like using one right now.
---
If you feel like clues are a good break between stuff why wouldn’t you use dark totems between tasks?
---
I don’t want to have a massive stack of clues so I feel like I it’ll be a chore to do them, but I don’t want to do every single clue as it comes to me, just do a couple then go back to what I was doing. Like with the totem pieces. Let me finish what I’m doing then when I’m good and ready I’ll go do the other things.
---
I think you’re exaggerating the consequences  of making clues stackable.
---
there's literally no reason not to.
---
addy gloves were available to pures pre-eoc and it was never a problem back then.
---
Hey I get to finally use the word cuck 
---
&gt; whenever you want without missing out on getting them.
---
I'll hand it to you since you never know the mindset others will have. This would probably be a dream come true for the people who can stomach binging 2-3 hours of clues.   
---
However, personally I thought it was fantastic at first too(rs3btw) until I get a stack of 25 hard clues. Then with the mindset of 'well i hit the cap, should probably do them for fortunate components.' So then comes spending the next 3 hours mindlessly doing clues vowing to never do it again while sitting on a new stack of 25 hard clues.     
---
Gg rough go at things my dude 
---
Boglagold then chuck 3x at duel arena

I think you can always move on to better and other activities
---
I like any and all recolour options. Everyone running around in the same shit is boring. I would however like them to be untradeable and unlocked through actually playing the game. When someone has a rare untradeable cosmetic, people are supposed to look at him and think "Damn nigga".

Wait, resting was 2009? Dungeoneering 2010?
---
Time really warped... I thought these came at like 2012/13 earliest...
---
I'm actually shocked.
---
Sorry i was tired then i meant the bandos blessing  so youll have a bandos and a zammy item
---
I don’t honestly care too much, you should look the pk client thing up its pretty game breaking, as far as i understand its just an extension of runelite. You cannot really comment on my comment when its main point is about something you have no understanding of
---
i actually got a chill seeing eoc on the timeline. Practically the day the game died.
---
Tbh I love all of these
---
its amazing how people dont seemt o understand this. maybe I'm overestimating the effect it would have but i think it would be detrimental to the price of clue scroll items which are already in a pretty bad place.
---
Omg you’re right i forgot about the 3k slay experience you’ll get doing hellhounds for an hour at 50 range

making clues stackable is a huge change. this isnt some qol update. this drastically effects the prices of many BIS.

I actually agree. It's exciting to get one and knock it out. Now it'll just be another activity.

You don't need Runelite to see cache files, you dolt.

Oi bongaz mate
---
but if clues are already terrible money what makes you think this update wouldnt make clues absolutely worthless? you would no longer be doing clues because it would completely devalue clue scrolls.
---
To confirm, 
---
I have tested both the temple and shamans east of battlefront. Unfortunately neither work, we are stuck to battlefront brutes.
---

---

i rather have a small pp then no pp ;]
---
Yeah, I like this idea.  
---
It would make getting a clue during your task be nice, but you don't have to do it instantly.  
---
2-3 sounds perfect 
---
I've been playing a month and and so far ive made 2 friends, both of which are also returning to the game and I met them before eoc and another person whom I added while having to do shield of araav and heroes guild. No one ever take in this game anymore and if they do it's all just toxicity. On the plus side, at least party hats are cheap. 
---
That tracks. Still using my first account and stupid 9 year old me named it nxz8
---
You are a bold one

I didnt play then, but that 2010 constitution + bonus exp 2 week period mustve made people flip shit. Imagine OSRS releasing 2 updates like that back to back... shiiiiiit

Has there been any mention of adding the ability to equip from bank?  
---
Idk about everyone else, but I would find that extremely useful. Often times I'm setting up an inventory, I accidently hit deposit all gear, or my inventory is full and I realize I need to change gear. Wastes time having to deposit everything again.

---
Stackable clues is not a good idea imo. Often I find myself holding onto a clue just to finish off a slayer task, with stackable it just makes me afk or lazier. 
---
An idea I had for an alternative, if you have that current clue in the bank or invent the monster could drop a skip token rather than the clue? 
---
What would you think of having them stack to 2-3?  
---
That way you can still finish your task when you get one, but impling guys aren't as buffed.

I get this for sure, but the original post wasn't really about the economics of it. The value of clues would definitely change, and the rewards might need to be adjusted. It would be tricky, but not every convenience change is a slippery slope to RS3.

Do hellhounds in rev cave with a ring of wealth(i), you get like 6 clues per task and i think average for hard clues is like 200k

LiquidSpyder got my green mask when they were 500k. Prick.
---
YESSSSSSSSS.  It's so bloody annoying having to take off all the gear and deposit everything, get all your teleport items out and then go do a clue, and if you get a wildy step you have to bank again to deposit rune pouch and other valuables, then try to finish the clue with minimal teleports, and god forbid you get another wildy step.  It's too much.
---
Make clues stackable up to 5 would be enough for me.  It just feels bad not doing a clue right away but it's such a detraction from being able to do whatever it is you're doing at the time.

I also wish we had Great Orb Project. Such a fun and unique minigame. 
---
God damn, OSRS needs more Intermediate to master quests, I mean only 1 new quest of each? The grandmaster quests are fine and all, but feels like there's too many novice quests that don't really serve much purpose, don't have much of a reward and are over in 5 minutes like X marks the spot for example.
---
I literally did it last night and you have nothing to worry about. Just protect mage and you'll be fine. The boss is invulnerable to melee and ranged. You can bank in the safe area before the fight. 
---
Only have a slash weapon, pull Edgeville lever and walk there. Then access bank. Use your best staff, a god book, maybe mystic or d hide, and runes to cast. He's super weak. Maybe a prayer potion or two. You'll be done in 5 minutes tops.

Stackable clues would increase the rate that people do their clues. The drop rate is the same but getting multiple in a task would indirectly be the cause of the item prices dropping.
---
Why does everyone have to look the same lol?
---
Yeah I wouldn't be mad if they implemented dungeoneering. As much as it should be a minigame, it was nice to gain experience and unlock content that way through a minigame.
---
True, but those don't really require much attention, compared to fighting a boss.

Thought so lmao.

I remember the first time I ever killed bandos was with my boy wezx6. We didnt know shit, and could only manage 1 kill per trip. However, to this day, I will never forget that the 2nd ever kill of bandos ever, we got a tassets drop, and I freaked the fuck out. He couldnt see the drop so he didnt understand why. I immediately teled to varrock, sold it off and split it between us, 11m each. That was a good day.

Shouldnt something that is designed to be a break from what your doing allow you the convenience of being able to continue said activity without being penalized with no more clue drops because your in the middle of a vork trip? For something designed to break up monotony I find ungearing and regearing for a single activity monotonous and penalizing a player for trying to do things on their own time is a bit bonkers...

Actually you use to get them with just membership.

&gt;You're using the word "random" here with a negative connotation when in reality that's all anything ever is. People come up with ideas "randomly" and implement them. That's just how ideas work. 
---
Sure. For all intents and purposes all content proposed could be totally arbitrary in value and quality. What makes god wars "fitting content" vs any other piece of questionably authentic content? Well there are metrics we use to judge content such as balance, quality, scaling all of which are subjective, so I'd actually disagree. There is a sense of "randomness" to content and there is a sense of fitting to a piece of content and to me the rewards of chambers of xerics were scatterbrained, rushed, and not well thought out. But this also stems form my belief that these rewards would've been better placed on bosses similar to the old style of bosses over a longer period of time, **excluding the twisted bow which shouldn't exist whatsoever.** My argument for this is that we should now look at the place of chambers of xeric 2-3 years later and see how it effects the game over time raThings such as the prayer which to me shouldn't be expensive one time unlocks, but rather, difficult/expensive unlocks with significant disadvantages to using. But that stems from my belief OSRS should('ve) do(ne) its best to remain closer to the "vanilla" 2007 power levels, which almost everything about COX fails to do. This isn't me making the argument that new content shouldn't exist, but rather, it should exist in a much more tedious and more heavily thought out form. They shouldn't poll things several times with small incremental nerfs to make things pass. To polling items that don't belong (such as the dragon harpoon and dragon sword which were later moved THANK GOD), this to me, is "random". Or you could use some other adjective, nonsensical, thoughtless. It's bad content.
---
&gt;You even say "one minigame thing" because you realize that describing it as a minigame is incorrect, since it isn't. So what exactly are you saying here? By this logic, any activity where you enter a place and do different things are "minigame things", which makes up most of runescape. As such, its a worthless description.
---
This obviously wasn't a direct criticism. Obviously I don't inherently have issues with minigames so I have no problem with "any activity where you enter a place and do different things are 'minigame things'". I used "minigame things" to describe it as one of the oddities Jagex added post 2014 where they added bosses and the likes to instanced areas, which as far as I know was unheard of before this boss and zulrah, and is now a staple for most bosses. Which isn't inherently bad, I just used it as a descriptive term. Eg. not a direct criticism.
---
&gt;As far as rewards failing polls go, the update already added far more gamechanging items than any other update has. This is a valid point for things such as on-release rev caves, but Cox? No way. 
---
And like I said earlier, to me, this is not an inherently good thing. When we're talking about gamechanging items, we should be taking 10 steps back and examining them from every angle, scrutinizing how they fit into the game, what they'll change, what they'll add to the game, what it will mean to the name 
---
#OLDSCHOOL
---
Runescape. And once again because I receive the same response to this argument every single time I have to state that I don't believe that Oldschool Runescape should not receive content updates because it is supposed to be oldschool. Rather, the Oldschool moniker to me means that we should try to do better than we did the first time rather than slightly nerf content then port it to the oldschool version, which is what chambers of xeric did. People missed pre-eoc content and wanted it brought to the oldschool game. And how far we've come from dds/granite maul being BIS spec weapon to the double attacking 25% special usage extremely high strength dragon claws. How far we've come from doing moderate dps with rune crossbow/whip to increasing bosses killtimes by 300-500% with the fucking twisted bow.

Something that would be cool is if RuneScape had a dedicated chat client so even when you ~~quit the game~~ take a break you can keep talking to them.

😭😭😭

Np mate
---
Except the new rewards probably will be in new chests with a separate item ID assigned to the chest the same way they did with birds nests and the new seeds. 
---
Dungeoneering was pretty cool, but I didn't think it made too much sense as a skill. 
---
It'd be pretty cool if they implemented a Daemonheim-equivalent as a Raid or just as a location on the map where you couldn't bring any items in and had to put everything together from scratch. 
---
yeah it's not fair to take this months-old idea and force it into treasure trails, should have been a definite heads-only recolor from the start
---
Oh yea 
---
Alot of recommendations. Stop using suffering and fury. Sell that get a toxic trident, use void switch and glory. Use it on mage gear and spend the rest on ranged lvls as chins are cheap atm. Rune pouch, vengeance, Google bitterkoekje google docs dps calc on zulrah. 9 swap is ridiculous. Get your ranged up. Elite void VERY preferred and world 330 for banking until you can afford an ornate pool. Void ranged lacks dps but void mage and ahrim are neck and neck.  Get 76 agility eventually and use a dramen staff for quick access
---
Caskets can't be stacked unless this is a new proposed update that I haven't seen
---
stackable clues also create a high demand for efficient clue farming. I'm not saying being totally unprepared for a clue scroll step is a good thing. But feeling like you need to identify the solution to a clue step without google, choosing the fastest teleport out of 30 teleports in your meticulously planned inventory, solving sliders in sub 20 seconds, and then wasting no time between clue number 10 and clue number 11. It all just makes clues feel like a race that you are never fast enough for. 
---
I however wouldn't mind if clues became stackable up to 3-5. It does feel kinda bad when you either have to leave a slayer task mid assignment, or miss out on the fun of opening a bunch of caskets. If I could stock clues til the end of my task that'd be sweet. But that's not really the same as cannoning hellhounds for 25 hard clues, swapping into a clue speed running load out and burning staminas and teleport scrolls to save 12 seconds per clue step. 
---
Stop this

"bubblegum985" if you see this, please pm me :/ :'(

It’s healthy for the game economy and people want it. I don’t care abut cosmetics but I haven’t seen an argument to make me not vote for them yet
---
Since alot of people seem confused, to clarify the joke, more than a few contest winners have reported not receiving their prizes. To make matters worse when said winners got onto Reddit and got upvoted to the attention of jmods the jmods reached out and acted like they were going to fix the issue then never did anything. so basically if you ever win a contest don't expect your prize
---
We need more quests
---
if it's the same gp/hr and I can do them when I actually feel like doing them then yes... that's the whole argument.
---
he didn't have a full inventory of items he had a theory which he tested and it turned out to be correct. Everyone who was bitching and moaning saying he brute forced it are the worst part of the community.
---
He had a theory he tried it and he was right, he was surprised ofc anyone would be in his position 
---
&gt; I did not have 2 step on my account noir did i have a bank pin which i should of.  
---
Zombie dance is micheal jackson’s moves was this intentional?
---
Why?
---
D
---
As long as solo exp is competitive with team exp &amp; binds don't matter as much as they did, sure. 
---
You are still doing them just not all at once? Also you can just jar the imps and have them in the bank and you effectively have the same thing.
---
I only ever did it because I could sell the resources to players for like 1m per trip lol

Are you aware that Wikipedia is funded almost exclusively by donations? Apart from the founder and being wiki-based sites, the two have nothing in common.

Can you make a osrs dab pen? Hit me in PM's if you do anything like that, would definitely buy from you, thanks!

Just needs to be in the top left.
---
This is also how much Jagex charges if your account is hacked and the hijackers use stolen credit cards. $500 or your account is never unbanned
---
I mean when you are in the bank tab. The option to fill them within the bank is already available but I'm saying the choice to shift+click them while in bank to fill instead of right clicking or to avoid paying 20 more runes to do it the same speed or marginally faster. 40 runes in all is around 6 or 7 clicks, and right clicking is around 6 or 8 clicks. 
---
Thanks Im drunk.

One day perhaps. I'm only lvl 70 and my levels seem to take an eon idk if I'll be able to tough it out to 5 mill

yeah I noticed sometimes that I get kicked as well. usually not a big deal tho I just join right back with no issues. 
---
Great discussion lad :) 
---
Same here, absolutely love it!
---
I would agree with you. I have never played rs3 but I can see this becoming a chore. I still would like to stack a few at a time. Since when doing a task you're not going to get more then like 5 clues. 
---
It sucks, but i'm the one who assumed the risk. Let me tell ya, losing my legitimate 91 slayer and max melee was not worth the ill-gotten agility levels. Schedule started getting a lot more packed with going back to classes and all, but got sucked into that no-xp waste mentality. Made a pretty big mistake. I've learned my lesson for sure. Today has been a lot of reflection. Just really sucks, because a few weeks back I got my gf into the game, she's hooked lol we would quest together a bunch (something I used to neglect badly) ,0 don't know how i'm gonna explain that I won't be playing anymore, you know? But it's 100% I did a dumb thing and then consequences happened.
---
Congraaaatsss, whats your stats looking like?
---
It's already implied
---
I have a lunar but haven’t seen any difference. I’ll check later for right click functionality. Thanks!
---
Who are you tlking bout
---
The punishment is playing sub optimaly not doing the clues. This doesnt make anything easier. Youre still spending the same amount of time getting the clues and the same time doing the clues. You just now get to choose when you want to put that time in.
---
you chose not to protect your account, that shows a disregard for your account and it's contents. go start a new account now that you have been compromised, and this time, please protect it.
---
Darkonn995 goodbye bud
---
Jagex wont really do any of the checks you ask them as account security is down to you to keep everything secure, such as having a bank PIN, 2-step authenticator and 2-step verification on your email.
---
If someone gets access to your account it means that you haven't been careful with your information, whether that be by not having the aforementioned, changing your passwords every now and/or your bank pin, clicking on phishing links or downloaded a fake client which has keylogged your information; and with the screenshots you provided, you don't have authenticator which is highly recommended for you to use as that way, you need a code to log in.
---
All the best and sincere good luck with the rebuild.

That is disgusting.

I love it.

Polypore staff. That damn polypore staff is when the game started dying for me. Made Fight Caves an absolute joke and the armour let you tank Jad.
---
That being said, I have no defense for myself, but I just wanted to apologize to the Jagex team and the OS community for compromising the integrity of the game.  Just was hoping to call upon the humanity of the old school team, and maybe work out something so I can continue to play? Take my levels, clear my bank, temp ban me, but please, give me an opportunity to make it right. I just want to quest with my girlfriend again.

I'm an osrs pvmer, id like to be a pvper but I'm not. Am I afraid of the wildy? Hell no!!!! Should it be removed NO FUCKING WAY. Ik this post is mainly about rs3 but just a show to the pvpers there are pvmers out there that support their side. VIVA LA RESISTANCE!
---
You have a limited inventory space, therefore you have to keep banking the imps.  It's not close to the same thing.
---
It needs to be turned off on mobile 90% of the time
---
incested?
---
This reminds me of the pics you would see back in the day of some insane bank tabs with like 50k rune sets and p hats lol
---
Damn it, I wanted to make this comment! 
---
You can’t get pked. It’s single combat during the fight.
---
Using this meme format in 2019. Are you rsgloryandgOLD?
---
Had a good friend on here, Meandi1.. played with him daily. Great dude but I could tell he was a little anti social. I began to play less but still kept up with him through Facebook. I remember messaging him 4 or 5 times over the course of a year and got no response.. finally one day his brother hits me up and let's me know that he'd committed suicide earlier in the year (probably 2014 or so). Fast forward to 07 release, I hop on.. his account is still there, so I join his friend chat and there it is.. a gold star beside my name.. this shit hit me pretty hard.
---
I would like a dragon scimitar pendant this is a serious inquiry 
---
Why aren't any of their names on the minimaps?? It feels so empty with no names there.
---
i dont get it
---
Or just roll back the servers to rs2 hd... Lol would love to see the reactions of post eoc players getting their accounts deleted, then maybe they would feel the pain we osrs players felt when our game was destroyed.
---
I think it's down to your magic level, kills trips are increased by shortened times. Becuase you take a while to kill it you take more damage. 
---
Are you using the exact same bosses? Theres a few that give bonus exp per the damage you do 
---
Become a max player so your wife sees you as a real Chad and drops her boyfriend for you. Then as you two begin to rekindle your destructive relationship, whisper in her ear, "You remind me of RS3".
---
Drop the mic, leave, and remember the Chad you became. 💪🏽
---
Nowadays people quit RS3 cause of MTX not EOC.

Lol I'm 500kc 0 uniques 
---
Nice.
---
I had the name along time ago just never let it go, had several people offer me a lot of gp for it lol
---
When he looks at the screen to the comments lmfao
---
December 10, 2007 NEVER FORGET
---
I would be okay with a limit of 3 or 5 per tier.
---
Georgiaboy, are you out there?
---
I thought it was just the bosses like the rock golem dude where his defense negates your damage. So its not really bonus exp but rather its the normal exp you'd get for what you would have normally hit. I.e; hit a 20 on him but that 20 was really a 40 due to his defensive mechanics. 
---
I could be 100% wrong. I really dont know lol. 
---
Also to OP, im assuming just rng? Being off by like 3k exp isnt that much. 
---
Hey gimme that slurp bro 💦
---
I got 4 Clues on 120kc yesterday, not bad imo.
---
Oh it was absolutely worth doing for either the cash or absurd xp, but  the actual content/update itself was so dumb and never should have existed 
---
Is it possible to maaaybe open it to f2p? 😬 I’m not member but would love this!! Just to go and watch in the crowd haha I’m not funny 
---
Vote no to pvp
---
yeah math is for weirdos
---
 Indeed, rent is cheap in mom's basement.
---
Prices will go down a bit in items though if they do stack tbh. Also with being able to reroll steps. (The reroll may not be bad if its locked behind like 1 reroll per 20 completed) but youd be surprised how many people pick up a clue at the start of a task then hold it until its done. For example if im at hellhounds and get one i do it right away. i can get 2-3 hards per task sometimes but a lot of people would only be getting one. So essentially id say probably close to 2x more clues will end up being completed. Meaning prices will definitely drop a bit. 
---
gotta poll it
---
Print screen.
---
Good to see a fellow 2004er
---
Vote no to pvp updates
---
Whats casually?
---
Good bye.
---
Definitely make an announcement of when and where for the next one!! This is what I miss most about runescape- the social aspect that doesn’t necessarily have to involve skilling. Love it.
---
For the mods: S / Suggestion

Im amazed he has it as high as he does

Screw it. I just posted it...

https://i.redd.it/d76swmr2y8i21.png
---
Ah okay that's not bad, been a while since I rc'ed
---
Dont account share and dont trust your brother, also vote no to pvp updates.
---
I think there needs to be a limit to these stacks. Something like 3 or 5 per tier.
---
Smh who adds it to the end of searches
---
Imo, studying for massive amounts of time at once is absolutely terrible for actual memorizing the material. I do at most 3 hours at a time then take a break for the same amount of time I studied for.
---
I should have, but I was being lazy 
---
Looks like pp
---
I do this at work at least once a day.
---
People hated the grand exchange, but no one forces you to use it. People hate cosmetics, but no one forces you to change the color. You can just stick with the original gear. Is there any max players complaining about their max cape having too much cosmetics? 
---
Who else killed the vampres...
---
I bet stuff like god pages will drop in price maybe? Can go to entrana to open them all and get better chance at them. Though i think that will only be useful for ironmen since most want chance at the juicy cosmetics/rangers etc. 
---
Same feels my brother
---
Wah I’m so offended
---
I still can’t use EOC. I’m sure if I put the time in to understand it, but I feel there’s too much to it. Played legacy for a while here and there but I can’t see myself playing any more with the mining/smithing rework and other changes
---
F
---
nah theres some that give straight up bonus exp but i think its only worth using  Ice troll king (hard) 12.50%  Moss giant (hard) 7.50% cause the others that give the exp have annoying effects like knockback 
---
Support this because Golden Dragon will then replace money dragon vorkaphth and thats a good thing
---
Banking doesnt take that long at all and you can even buy them if you want from other players.
---
The chest rolls on the uniques table once per brother killed, so 6 rolls of you kill all 6. The chance per roll to get an item is 1/102, and 6/102 for all 6 brothers killed is 1/17.
---
This does not fit well with clue scrolls. NAH.
---
Sounds cool.
---
Neither. Alts r bad
---
6 rolls in 1 chest each containing a 102 chance cmon bruh. 6 chances per chest
---
its only worth 1gp tho so pretty much everything protects over it
---
Imagine if they just made Raids 3 similar instead?
---
Like you aren't allowed to bring ANYTHING inside and you have to craft/skill/fight with whatever you find each raid.
---
Thats what i thought too, but just seemed a bit weird for it to be consistantly off for like 7 hrs. Bosses didnt change or anything so just thought a 3-5k constant drop was strange.
---
Plus going up in levels wouldn't decrease xp so...
---
hunting was the most exciting update for me, i skipped school and played hooky at the library, got to black salamanders near first and made bank
---
If you didn't know imbuing the Slayer helm keeps the imbue if you craft if with an imbued black mask so you don't need to hold off on imbuing. 
---
Yea i remember hunter day one, that was definitely fun with everyone walking around feldip hills wondering what to do
---
I know venge and the imbued heart would help me a lot, unfortunately I just recently made the upgrade to torment bracelet and eternals. Im thinking of either getting ancestral hat or anguish next thoughts?
---
You’ll never get 86 RC so why bother /s
---
I mean still using king, tree spirit, kendal, khazard, and vampire. 
---
Havent looked to see if theres a better setup, just kinda what ive always used.
---
bot nuke day was the only reason i kept playing, but eoc killed that 
---
Just comment "S" it will be invisible to other people :P
---
((What you've typed wont work))
---
I held a hard clue for 3 months because i didnt want to do regicide. I did it the other night. Messed up the underground pass twice. Wasted both my coal-tar and had to go through again. Forgot food and was poisioned. Killed 40 rabbits to regain health. Had a antipoison++ in my inventory the whole time. Took me about 3 hours. And i was using a guide. Feels bad man. Hard clue was on step 4 already. And only made 68k. 
---
They're a chore because you have to do them as they drop.
---
Not because they'll stack to infinity.
---
I'd rather being able to get in slayer gear and do a hellhound task for example, instead of getting geared, killing 5 and getting clue and then having to do that. 
---
Only to come back after finishing the clue to have the same thing happen again.
---
That's more of a chore TBH.
---
Either way, I think the poll should decide it. It isn't going to kill the game either way.
---
This is actually my life right now, first attempt got wrecked on wave 49, last two attempts have gotten wrecked by jad, trying to get ready for disappointment on attempt #4 lol. 
---
KKonar makes them a really good task IMO.
---
Average 4-8 keys a task there.
---
Yes like why dont they just implement it, surely it wont do any harm lol
---
Good, but it should it should be longer. 7 days maybe.
---
Thanks!
---
I like the idea! I imagine it would be super rare an expesive, so maby more than 1m to bless each piece, just for some extra gold sink! 
---
Either way, big support from me! :P
---
2006-2007 was peak for me, i made more money 2010-2012 but i had so much fun on f2p as a pure in 06-07
---
No, not because it datk humor or anything. It's just not funny, he took two completely different topics, the protest in venezula and oldschool runescape. And connected them with the thin thread that some are gold famers, how can anyone call this a joke?
---
[Definitely get a lot of questing out of the way first.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) If you need guides, look up Slayermusiq1 on Youtube.
---
[Contrary to what the guide says, this quest can be done at a really low level. Having 43 prayer helps a lot tho. You’ll want to do this quest because it allows you to wield a dragon scimitar at 60 attack.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Monkey_Madness_I) Keep using your rune scimitar until then. Once you get a dragon scimitar, use it until you can obtain a whip.
---
[You’ll also want to get one of these for melee training.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fighter_torso) If you need guides, look up CrumbRS on Youtube. Until then, a rune platebody will do. You might want to train to base 60 melees before getting this because the monsters can hit hard.
---
[Once your attack and strength levels reach a total of 130, you’ll want to get one of these.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_defender) A rune kite or god book will do until then.
---
[The helm from this quest is very good. You’ll want to use it.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Fremennik_Isles) Until then, a rune full helm or berserker helm will suffice.
---
[This’ll be your best gloves.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows_gloves) These will take a while to obtain, so they’re a good goal to work towards. In the meantime, use a combat bracelet until you get to mithril gloves.
---
Use your rune legs and boots until you get to 60 defence, then upgrade to dragon. Ranged is similar, just upgrade dhide every 10 levels until you get to black. For weapons, use either a magic shortbow with rune arrows or a rune crossbow with broad/mithril bolts. 
---
Gamer juice
---
Man so many people who get "hacked" are "hacked" by their friends ,bot, or do something ti cause it themselves then post snd act like they didnt do anything and someone just magically picked them to "hack"
---
You’re looking to far into it.
---
I'm on a break from the defender grind, I got way too pissed off just burning tokens for nothing lol. 
---
Reeeeeeee
---
Team blue cape! 
---
Actual good suggestion. Support
---
I may be wrong here, but didn't they have a seperate team working on mobile?
---
LMAO at the HCIM dying at sandcrabs and wizard tower
---
I got wasted irl there.
---
It was fun.
---
I vomited later 
---
Probs cos you responded with "?" 
---
they do- the *engine team*. the most important team in the whole cast, i would argue (i think most would agree). meaning that if they wanna do this, they can't do other engine work instead. that is all the more reason to consider this kind of poll question carefully. these decisions matters more than they appear to.
---
I fear no god 
---
Sit, ya young whipper snapper
---
im bouta dds spec ur ass out with this twig
---
no pet, no good
---
That was the same with me about a month ago. Hadn't played in 6 years or more, but Swampletics drew me back in
---
Might be worth skipping at low levels, I wouldn't block them unless you're in the end game hunting for Hydra tasks and no longer in need of combat xp.
---
How did get he slayer labels with 0 combat? 
---
How about having to re enter my Authenticator every time I close out of the app, or having to reset my settings (rooftops etc). 
---
Tbh I'd play the shit out of a 2010-2012 server. Have some great memories during those times. 
---
Played since 2002 btw. 
---
11$
---
Both times I've done fight cave I've made it to jade with no issue both times I get 1 shot by jade immediately.
---
Absolutely prioritize imbued heart next. Makes a huge difference. 
---
lamps etc
---
Come on man you are better than that 
---
no way.
---
Should be against the rules to play two accounts at the same time imo 
---
"I'll keep it because it will motivate me"
---
Small work around Iban blast. Since staves remember your auto cast when you unequip just go into clan wars with it in your inventory, then once you tp equip the staff and it will be set to auto cast iban blast
---
Dunno why it still resets it. Probably something to do with clan wars being pvp 
---

Blowpipe and regular trident. Gl finding a team though without a bgs.
---
I need help beating the TzHaar Fight Cave. This was my first serious attempt at doing it; the only other time was when I stopped at level 31 for Karamja Hard Diary. I made it to wave 42 and subsequently died. 
---
My stats are as follows:
---
* Combat Level: 100
---
* Range: 85
---
* Defense: 75
---
* Hitpoints: 84
---
* Prayer: 70
---
My gear was:
---
* Helm of Neitiznot
---
* Amulet of Glory
---
* Guthix Vestment Cape
---
* Black D'Hide Body
---
* Black D'Hide Chaps
---
* Rune Crossbow w/ Broad Bolts and 200 Enchanted Diamond Bolts
---
* Toktz-Ket-Xil
---
* Barrows Gloves
---
* Dragon Boots
---
* Explorer's Ring (for run energy recharge if needed)
---
My inventory consisted of:
---
* Holy Wrench
---
* 200 Diamond Bolts (E)
---
* 3 Bastion Potions
---
* 14 Prayer Potions
---
* Falador Shield 3 to give full prayer charge
---
* Remaining slots were monkfish for healing as needed
---
A couple of things I noticed were:
---
* Broad bolts seemed very weak (read: hitting zero's on Mage monsters frequently) causing me to flick the range boosting prayer which ate up a lot of prayer potions
---
* Finding the Prayer birds was difficult due to their color blending with the environment
---
* Trying to hit-and-run the Prayer birds even when I set my crossbow to long range was hard 
---
* When the Range monster is too far away from the safe spots and I have to run out to it, I was getting hit too much from the big Melee monster
---
All that said, what should I do? Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks
---
It really be like that
---
Myrabbitpoo, Guardofwar, Tamengame, Captain Cook, Arialdragon.. I miss you guys.
---
So is it not worth getting any granite gear then?
---
I was banned for macroing, who ever stole the account used it to farm logs as a bot and then sold it to someone in Cali. I wasn’t banned for jumping IPs.
---
So no, that won’t cause Jagex to ban you.
---
Tf lol. Go boss for cash.
---
It would be so inconvience to get 28 that it wouldnt be worth it. But i dont mind making it work like that.
---
whats your instagram? im about to follow and buy a dabber bro!
---
Iron men are the vegans of RuneScape 
---
Ehmm I'd go with Anguish, I think it's generally a more useful item to have.  Think the boost you'll get is probably around the same. 
---
down side is they have been hosting them in in f2p and you cant use POH in f2p
---
You need whip trident blowpipe at bare minimum
---
Would say 10-15m is the minimum budget. A defence lowering weapon such as a BGS is highly recommend for Olm's meele hand. You wont be using regular armour at raids, it'll always be void since that'll be increasing your max hit and accuracy (assuming that you have low stats) as gear switches take up more space and and you want to save as much as it as possible for supplies for the final boss and for the rooms in general.
---
You'll need at least:
---
* Trident of the Seas
---
* BGS / DWH
---
* Whip/ Tent
---
* Rune/ D pick
---
* Salve amulet (ei)
---
* Blowpipe/ rune crossbow
---
If you don't have the listed, then it's pretty pointless for you to be going on raids.
---
Value is based off demand dude.
---
Blue cape best cape
---
The only suggestion ive seen that can fit the game and isnt power creep. 
---
I can’t believe I actually thought for a second you were gonna give a higher resolution image lmao
---
bbd are always packed and you need tbow for similar results to lance at rune drags
---

Wasn't this also proven to not actually be true and it just deletes the item instead of rerolling it?
---
Stackable clues will become a chore, which takes away from what makes clues so great in this game. Stackable caskets tho, yes pls. 
---
I’m fine with it being added via ornament kits, but I 100% agree that it just makes sense for them to be added via the boss heads 
---
You mean you were extracting every herb manually?
---
oh no
---
No need to be rude. I just pointed out affect that people did not think. Agree on that game does not need to be balanced around irommen. Making caskets non stackable but being able to hold on as many as you want is still viable for regulars. 
---
Replace all your armour with spades too.

Fookin legend mate

I wouldn’t make that trade bro

wtf u bet i was dds speccing nerds in the playground about 10 years ago

Wtf does freedom of speech have to do with dark humour?
---
Eric, we met by iron and steel drags in Brimhaven Dungeon, you were always kind, we bonded because I was called yodaboy and you were yodaman, hope you read this bud and everything is well!

P.s airact360 you’re a cunt you owe me a dragon 2h

I wanted it removed, but I never enter the wilderness to begin with. Pussy btw

You did not get it at all.
---
Wasnt that the date of the falador massacre or am I way off here..?
---
Your daily scape is ready.
---
If you had a full inventory *and* a pet following you, then you wouldn't of received it but would have  gotten the message.
---
But gz.
---
not a fan of stackable clues, rerolling, or mimic warning, but ftp clue scrolls should be fun :)
---
This looks pretty sweet ngl
---
Look at past polls. Obviously there's no way to know these things for absolute certain but if you look at the polls over the last year that seems to be the % breaking points: polls generally go ~95%-5%, ~85%-15%, or ~70%-30%, unless it's a true failure and lots of people vote no. Combine that with observations on social media (especially here on reddit) and it's pretty easy to draw conclusions about the motivations of each of those groups causing those splits.
---
THE GREATER GOOD
---
When I came back to rs after the Wild update, I was so glad to see my hp was glitched and I had insanely high xp. Went straight to wild.
---
You don’t understand. If I wanted to see my own shit I’d just look in the toilet 
---
It looks awesome! I can’t really see any downsides to it since it’s basically just a cosmetic change to the diary cape :/
---
Wha?
---
Lol and people say all pvpers are toxic
---
It was lol it was 6/6/6 for the date so like the devil's number
---
revision: no you can't. dammit! sooo sad haha
---
Are bwanas real
---
Don’t forget the River Eli’s
---
This is me currently lol. I'm doing Konar slayer, fletching with 92 fletching. Barrows is an option. I would suggest konar though, one wyrm task and I made 800k. 
---
The chad in the arma would be me
---
Currently to me cluescrolls are just a chore that you do if they drop. You feel obligated to do them because you lose out on them if you don't do them right away. To me, that's more of a chore. I don't necessarily want stackable clues, but that's just what I feel about clues in general, to the point where I've had all types of clues in my bank unfinished for a few years now.
---
&gt;#(little did she know he has dragon claws)
---
I miss zaniks crossbow and hand cannon so much 😭😭😭😭
---
Does it take screenshots for all deaths? I bet I have sooooo many screenshots of me dying at Zulrah because I take the risk of not eating at 41hp...
---
#repost #omg 
---
I want a high-res of the HCIM deaths. some of them are dying in places where there is nothing that can kill you lmao
---
bloodvelds have magic based melee attacks 
---
I think I'd rather it just be from the Clues like other Gilded items, but this is an option...
---
Can concur. I guess he needs more rings of recoil
---
Fuck you Jagex
---
&gt;ge value 5-11m
---
&gt;always drops
---
Hmmm
---
Stealing creation and dungeoneering were (imo) the 2 best things ever added to any iteration of runescape. Rewards are another subject (chaotics were the start of the power creep problem) but the content themselves were amazing. 
---
No
---
Why
---
This would make me finish getting the diary cape 
---
Ute66, redtiger354 if you're seeing this please come back 
---
I remember the day I quit WYD, it was my birthday and I got gifted Tibia premium that night. That was the last day I played WYD.
---
I did log once a couple years later because the game heavily nerfed available early game weapons at some point and the noob stuff on my bank was now worth a lot IRL money. But I can confidently say that I quit that birthday to never play again.
---
I could also pinpoint the day I quit Cabal Online with a quick search. I got banned in the huge ban wave they did to try and control bots. Everyone I knew who used any kind of voice with overlay got nuked along (Xfire being the popular one at the time, I used skype). I tried to appeal but got their automated message saying that every botting ban was always revised by a human and therefore no one could appeal as the ban was 100% correct in every case.
---
No they aren't
---
That's called a "d scim". The only people using d longs are the bots at Green dragons, d long, rune full, and rune Chain in full.
---
Wow, I wonder where you got that idea, maybe [the actual OSRS post that mentions gilded d'hide](https://i.imgur.com/FoNnDwo.png)? With a taste of bad design and forced jokes.
---
Some people get upset when you make dark or offensive jokes 
---
thanks man
---
what are you talking about?
---
At least you weren't mod wolf on stream. Poor man shat himself
---
Block task 
---
Barrows gloves look quite good with angler. 
---
27m
---
Same. My ideal RS has summoning and DG in it. I just want to be able to gain decent XP while solo dunging. That I do insist on.
---
every time I get them for a slayer task its always super easy to find a world with only one or two people. 
---
Tbh I wish all fashionscape was clues scroll rewards. It would be so much fun and there’s always a surprise to whatcha get. 
---
I don’t need random ores or items. I can get those everywhere else in the game. 
---
But fashion scape would create like a mini economy of just random clothes and outfits people could trade each other and it would be neat. 
---
Don't the ornament kits have the same issue though? They're all tradeable on the GE, so people can just buy the one they want and apply it to their DHCB.
---
how does that make any sense? they're creating brand new assets for osrs all the time cant they just recreate stealing creations? (honestly dont care about the other 2 but pls stealing creations)
---
RNG is RNG. Took me like 600 kills to go from bronze to iron and I wanted to off myself 
---
Try 7th.... Gonna go for number 8 in a month maybe if I'm up to it... 
---
100% agree. Never had a problem with binds tho.
---
It's really nice, but sad that rs3 does some good things because if it wasnt for mtx and eoc we would see them as intended instead of remade in osrs. 
---
i’ve got like 10 laptops at home, get good
---
maybe require both 
---
Maybe you could try upstairs in the falador party room? Another option, more theatrical, could be holding it in the duel arena. The comic matches up with a maxed main who takes them out if they bomb. Spectators can lean on the walls to zoom in and throw rotten tomatoes. 
---
Completely agree. This is a super unpopular opinion, but regardless of that it’s bad for the game.  
---
This man gets his runescape gf for FREE!
---
At 53 Slayer you can still do konar and have chances at brimstone keys. Not sure what your kill list would look like however. Magic longs are quick and give a few 100k gp per 100, so if you grind out 99 fletching you might make some money back.
---
Yeah cosmetic bloat gets bad when you get to the point where you can't tell what people are wearing
---
Bless you

I have a quality of life suggestion!

Since players already TP to castle wars to abuse the neutral portal to restore stats, can we just have a restoration pool at castle wars?
---
C engineer, is that you buddy?
---
I got declined/booted from **many** teams for not having a hexhunter, and some for not having a hood before everyone realized it wasn't good. Huge part of why I hate DG is the bind system.

Old meme 
---
Dude spend that money bursting your levels up. 
---
I'm confused 
---
actually i take that back, i got to experience 6/6/6 first hand 
---
Thank you for confirming for me that your stats were just general assumptions from yourself.
---
Because ppl are forced to hide certain jokes or there entire sense of humor because they are afraid to offend people. The reason I said that is because I respect people who say.... fuck it, if your offended that’s your own fault not mine. 
---
Not everyone is 13 or shares the same humor. I'm sorry that im in the minority when it comes to thinking reused washed up memes or beating the same dead horse becomes stale and annoying after the 1000th time. And yes typically I do ignore those posts. But i also dont fanboy over e-karma so making a comment that wont fit in with the fellow sheep doesn't bother me. 
---
Because alts are bad for the osrs economy. Yes this is an unpopular opinion but it’s true.
---
How about three lefts?
---
i dont remember what was the 2010 constitution update?
---
Oh. I just soloed for like 30k xp/h lol
---
They actually can’t be bothered to read any statement or post they make even once. Even in a want ad for developers they made a ton of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. It’s super embarrassing. 
---
Don't be so triggered you got called out. You're just a fucking retard, get over it. 
---
Tbh I’d love for RSHD but I understand why that isn’t a priority for Jagex anytime soon. Would be interested to see them poll interest in this just for feedback purposes though.
---
I bet hes using the old wiki too

Is that......is that a HSR in there? You romantic motherfucker.
---
i once wasted my TOG on fletching, made sure afterwards that that would never happen again
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DK-tztm6c
---
&gt; How you worded it though was a little aggressive. 
---
Yeah thats probably due to the fact I posed the question in a completely logical, fair and objective way in my original comment and had the dude reply with "fuck off" and "fuck you asshole" so..I mean yeah isnt that surprising I respond more aggressive after trying to pose a legitimate question for people to think about and instead of being responded to with other mature responses and discussion I get that bullshit not once, but twice.
---
&gt; I too think that it's fair to kill somebody that just got a pet if you were going to kill them for their loot anyway, however if you're killing them just so that they lose the pet, then you're being an asshole.
---
Yea like I said, if youre just going out to specifically do that, youre an asshole. But the problem is its extremely difficult to judge motive in a situation like that unless the person is literally saying it and because of that it means the idea of someone should be basically given 100% immunity and if you dont youre an asshole for PvPing in the PvP area is where it becomes a slippery slope and why you cant just expect that outcome. 
---
You being an offended pussy made me cring u left wing nerd
---
thats why their ex anti cheat team member have saggy tits.
---
Let's just remove every update, so there's not even a game anymore.
---
I only enjoy doing clues in bunches though. It's annoying as hell to have to bank all of my stuff after every Slayer task and then get it back after I get me 3k reward.
---
I never liked dungeoneering and I know there was a lot more people who felt the same way, however I feel like nearly everyone can agree stealing creation was the shit back in the day.
---
Added loot to the game. Don’t get me wrong i completely understand why people have alts. But In general it adds more loot to the game which is bad in the long run
---
Yes
---
an old friend and i used to do that when we were in 6th grade in 2004, we'd get a stick and start attacking the other in 4 ticks while making the noises from the game
---
But osrs has been out for 6 years today
---
It's exactly the same thing lol, you just switched the last 2 steps
---
But Runescape has been out for 18 years
---
I remember printing out the map of the brimhaven dungeon at my library so I didnt get lost trying to get to iron/steel dragons.
---
Though old accounts are now on runescape 3, how could it be 8 years old, when old school re released 
---
Back on rs3 my first black dragon slayer task, I decided to kill the ones in the chicken shrine in zanaris. THREE kills in and get a visage. Better than sex. 
---
I'll give you a bond pm me
---
Accounts are the same, your character was just reset
---
how about we start recolouring things with all the god colours not just sara guthix and zammy.  we need more armadyl stuff
---
stuff fluctuates pretty constantly, i wouldn't really worry about it tbh. most of the items you buy in osrs are items you don't really sell ever.
---
Ring of suffering imbued,
---
Double the agony 
---
LOL me having a discussion about freedom of speech signifies I'm a pussy? Jesus fuck lol
---
Thank you
---
Colors are the lame easy way, make each clue look more fancy than the last.
---
Dumb you really are that dumb. It's like you read the words I wrote and made your own conclusions that don't even fit. I can send you some reading comprehension help articles. Would you be interested? 
---
Meet Crossletics
---
I don't want to delete them from my friends list in the hope they will return some day
---
I think an easy way to dodge making it a skill while still making it a minigame that will have people consistently playing it is to require the next level to be unlocked by a certain amount of tokens. If they retain the "play unexplored dungeons to get bonus tokens, oh you've done them all? just wipe your progress and start over!" mechanic, you'll have people of all levels of progress exploring dungeons together so low levels would never be dead content.
---
Hours played, and account age, are checked at Hans in Lumbridge.
---
You can check slayer creatures killed via an  enchanted gem, slayer helmet, or slayer ring.
---
Bosses are through the Ring of Wealth, Collection Log, or Adventurer's Log.
---
There was a like a one year old thread of a few people that had been unbanned for macroing after appeals after 8-9 years of being banned 
---
Fucking devastating 
---
Did you see the alternate ending tho..?
---
So i forget exactly when this is but i miss when everything looked like complete shit. Does anyone remeber when every regular tree looked exactly the same? To me osrs fire giants and moss giants look weird and too "new". I'm used to them looking like hill giants that were painted red/green. Hellhounds looking like rectangles etc. Would it be impossible to have an osrs with shitty throwback graphics? I guess that would mean things like slayer, farming, construction and hunter couldn't exist because i still remember them being brand new skills. 
---
someone @ that nerd who a few weeks ago posted here but killed someone for the pet and then laughed about it so we can all grill him
---
That was the same one i had for my first master and my stats werent much higher and it caught me off guard how hard they were. If you do it, learn from my mistakes and 1. Buy a clue box on the ge and 2. In order of priority pray melee then range then mage lol
---
Rofl no if you were playing for a long ass time, EoC was basically the Nuke whereas MTX wasn’t a problem till a year or so later. Player numbers were still high and mostly unaffected when SoF came out. 
---
You could just go with baby blue dragons in taverley to avoid spending a lot of time on a shitty task

*Hey just noticed..* It's your **5th Cakeday** isn0w! ^(hug)
---
It's a complete eyesore, and it's nostalgic for those who played before it was implemented. There was something really organic about the way you just kinda walked north, away from civilization and it slowly became more and more dangerous. Now it feels and more importantly looks really ugly. I respect the poll results, but to say that only lurers want this update (even though the poll specifically said it would have a pop up warning sign before you entered the wilderness) is deceptive.
---
This is coming from someone who lost their santa to the sleeping cap lure back in the day.
---
Gz mate
---
yeah me too.  i name all my arboks, milotics etc. miia 
---
I like the name but I think they kept them low numbers on purpose.
---
You told me in direct message that you bought 500M, now you made 27M? Lol...

If its 8 and a half year ago wouldnt it be an RS3 accou t anyway. The oldschool servers was released in 2013

You know I had to do it to em.

I love that pet! Congrats!

Bring back gnomecopters!

Eat shit you autistic fuck
---
&gt; Stackable clues would bypass this, leading to more clues being completed on average, which would in turn negatively affect the price of rare clue drops.
---
That's just the consequence of clue rewards being useless. Raids are really nice for example because the gear that's good in Raids is used in Raids, so as long as there's more new players learning Raids or doing other PvM content than the uniques coming into the game, Raids drops will hold their price.
---
Anything that makes clues better/more fun/easier/increases engagement in any way will always devalue clue rewards because of how useless they are. And going to a more controversial stance, doing clues for money is a waste of time, they're objectively bad GP/hr other than maybe Mediums so it doesn't really matter if clue rewards go down because people do them for fun, the chance of getting mega rare drops is just part of the fun, and if they go too low, the prices will correct themselves as less people find them worth doing. Making them stackable just makes the content more engaging since you don't have to regear constantly doing them whenever you get them.
---
I tracked 1k rune drags and got 56 maces, seems normal.
---
That's only true at 99 because of the skillcape. Show me evidence that 98 has better yield than 70.
---
I’ve always wondered what could have been if fortnite was owned by a company that was willing to put in a proper competitive mode, sort of like a ranked playlist with fixed guns and focused on balance. As it is now, like you said, the skill levels and game balance vary so wildly it’s hard to genuinely enjoy other than just playing with friends. Getting into a small build battle with someone of equal skill is insanely fun, but having some guy play around with you and your squad like meat (tfue) just feels bad and is really discouraging. 
---
Like imagine playing dota/lol with your friends on a drunk Friday night and you randomly match mid against a Sumail/Faker boot-camping for an upcoming tournament. Like yea I know they’re way better than me but having them show me how much better they are while I’m trying to have fun would completely kill the mood. Soft SBMM is pretty necessary for a big game to have an enjoyable pub experience.

Big congrats to your friend either way.
---
Oh really? What's your gamer tag? I can almost guarantee from your statement you don't even have 10 kills in total.
---
Not sure which 'real country' you got your education from but im guessing it doesnt have access to the dictionary.
---
Math and maths are both abbreviations of mathematics and both appear in the dictionary, both are accepted abbreviations of the word they are abbreviated from.
---
Well dont you look silly.
---
If you use a blowpipe you don’t have to bother about having an item in the shield spot. I would probably aim for 2k darts and 2k scales just to be safe, you can uncharge it and sell back all the unused darts and scales along with the bp when you finish.
---
I would also get rid of the monkfish, as they are admittedly cheap but inefficient. Saradomin brews raise HP by 15% + 2 and defends by 20% + 2 but lower your attack, magic and range stats each dose which makes them a very very good source of healing. To counter act the stat reduction you combine every three doses of saradomin brews with one dose of super restore, which also restores your prayer. This lets you save a lot of inventory space because you don’t need to bring food, prayer pots and your bastion potion(s)
---
It's normal ancestral 
---
I hate the building. To each their own. 
---
@modash doing lords work 
---
Voted no out of principle. It's failed 4 times prior to this one, and 5 times in total now. Jagex needs to accept the results already.
---
[Looks at the camera]
---
What is this from?
---
You mean click dds, click player, then click specbar?
---
Im kinda dissapointed in some updates the way they were implemented, for example fire surge in rs2 it required blood and death rune with elemental runes, now it requires wrath runes and elemental runes with makes it that people risk less in osrs, also fire surge in rs2 was very cool and quite unique, in osrs its literally bigger fire fire wave with a starting animation, the dev team is trying to implement same things but in a different way and fucks shit up...........  
---
Why cant devs just add stuff the way they were for example dragon platebody, its literally virgin osrs dragon platebody vs chad rs2 dragon platebody....  
---
In the fight caves the wiki says to use 3 doses of brew before using a dose of restore. Does this mean that you should wait until your health can be healed fully from 3 doses of brew or do you use them like you would food and just carry on with the reduced stats until you've used 3 and then restore?
---
Wut. 
---
You dare wear his clothes in lumbridge?
---
When wrong better just repeat your wrong statement. 
---
Subjectively* not fun
---
I’ve played very frequently since season 2 and I still have a blast every time I jump on with some friends
---
"Imagine doing any non-slayer combat in SlayerScape. LUL"
---
Okay, I was being sarcastic, but still...
---
RIP Geckogirl665 you are missed
---
Not killing someone who just got a pet is a baseline normal thing that most people would do, don't jerk yourself off too much.
---
I've gotten 2 and they both had ahrim's saff and karils coif.
---
I like them all 3
---
Could attune it to the currently RS3 mentioned god [Xau-Tak](https://runescape.wiki/w/Xau-Tak) since its colour is Black. In lore its already got some references to it in OSRS as Cave Horrors for example are connected to it. 
---
Well who else would it be? Unless ur sharing accounts? So yes it can only of been u who botted, and u may be interested In that 1 account maybe because your gold / loot is all on that account. At the end of the day u botted and got banned for it and rightly so. 
---
Yeah, I reread the whole post, and kudos sir. A+, would be trolled again.
---
Unfortunately not. 
---
Ever heard of Ted Baker? 
---
No need to be a white knight just having some fun man
---
So glad I grew up playing a game that would turn into a crippling addiction for hundreds of thousands of kids later on in life rather than doing stupid dances in public when I was 8 haha right guys
---
I coulda told you this tested it yesterday vs both a player and monster https://gfycat.com/MeanBasicCormorant https://gfycat.com/ParchedOrdinaryAplomadofalcon
---
holy shit, I met that player on RS. She was soooo nice to me and my neighbor.   
---
I'm actually serious about this lol! I wonder if i still have her added on one of my old accounts.   
---
Damn lol.
---
Fortnite is with no exaggeration the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. 
---
I would rather go 1-60 on regular mobs in vanilla wow than play an hour of fortnite. 
---
Obviously Assassin’s Creed
---
Still better than sick nerd
---
&gt; Why are you labeling someone a piece of shit for playing the game exactly how its meant to be?
---
Because you are. If you intentionally try to kill someone who you knew just received a pet as a boss drop, you're a douche.
---
&gt; I dont think you should obviously go out and actively try and seek to do this but, you cant condemn someone if it does happen with them because theyre under no obligation to just let the person go.
---
Who and what are you trying to argue against? What are you talking about an "obligation" for? Of course there is no obligation, but that doesn't change the fact that if you kill someone who just got a pet - you're a tool.
---
I mean you don't have to do all the clues in one go, you can still only do one when you want a break, this update will just give us the best of both worlds ??
---
the lads and the ladies who used to woodcut for hours at the seers mages....well i hope you all are doing well. but honestly start playing again dammit! i'm pissed!
---
Wait, PVPers actually giving someone Mercy. 
---
That's my player model!!!!
---
I mostly play non pvp content, and have a decent g mauler that I get absolutely wrecked when I try to play it, rarely (just for context here). That said, I think pvp updates are important for the game even if I don't play it, especially because it keeps the game significantly less linear.
---
I don't know if the context to my point is even important at all, but I don't see why the ditch should be removed. I am generally in favor of pvp updates that don't impact **current** pvm content, but I don't see removing the ditch to be a positive change for pvpers, and the only potential outcome in my mind is a slight increase in the number of players who get lured. 
---
if you get less than 20-25k points expect it even more dry ;)
---
Iirc I think the clan chat rankings stay the same? So like I have few of those [ACU7362DX] etc kinda names as generals, so that narrows down the important ones but still, doesn’t go anywhere.
---
We didn't know about it. Until now.
---
Pretty sure it's actually 50/50. Either happens or it doesn't. 
---
After playing since 05 I just realized the construction icon is a saw on a plane. *facepalm*
---
sounds like you're a virgin kiddo
---
Excellent question but at least it's not too far.. 
---
Recolorings need to stop imo and they already said they won't do this. This is because they left the main land to avoid the gods so having ancestral recolored wouldnt make sense lore eise
---
Sounds reasonable. Oh wait, too many characters.
---
Unfortunately herblore prices aren't falling too :(
---
Have you heard of economy?..
---
People might be farming them with animas patch for increase yield down.
---
If only he got gloves 
---
One of the reasons I liked the concept of sail is it would cover a large level range of content.  
---
The first thing people argue why sailing isn't a worthwhile skill anymore since its a bit like dungeoneering, is because we had raids.
---
Getting raids ready as a Ironman or even normal account can take thousands of hours, its not a justification in itself as a replacement of that skill I think Sailing would be been an amazing skill plus I'd love to have seen more Pirate writing from Jagex, they do a pretty hilarious job writing that sort of content.
---
Anyone from purple 0wnzx CC in here...? miss u guys
---
better count the lift from under the arms and crotch as well if this is the case.
---
yeah u can send jagex msg to roll back the xp dig around reddit/twitter for the link/info
---
I cant fap to this /u/zuhaar
---
Doesn't make much sense to force people to bring anti fire with them on every clue just for the odd chance a random dragon shows up and fucks your shit. 
---
you're retarded if you think any botter would pay 200-400$ to have acc unbanned unless they have 400$+ worth of gp on there
---
You must have accidently logged onto my account where the only drops i get are so rare they roll a 0 on every table.
---
I mean if they were there and I'm walking in I'd hop. That's how I do it to everybody - that's no special treatment.
---
But if they're walking in on me they can fuck right off.
---
Could give it stats equal to Rune or something. Would be an awesome fashion scape set
---
l0l retard go ahead buy an acc and don't come crying when I recover it back from your dumb ass
---
Why did that make me laugh so hard?
---
Looks like Xandir from Drawn Together sorta. Nice.
---
Too bad there isn't a sun to praise.
---
Nice screenshot dumbass 
---
You could hit more accurately with 3 more attack levels.
---
Love this game and community! &lt;3
---
Explain things currently passing at 95% then.

Should've done drake amd josh when josh says I dont know who that is. And drake gets arrested.

Why would you do bronze over iron? I get they are easier to kill but no matter what xp is gonna be bad. May as well have a shot at getting the visage if you're doing a metal dragon 
---
Lets not forget the noted potato cactus drops from fungal mages letting you farm 5m/hr on release.
---
I was ice barraging my mates when it snowed, imitating the animations and hitting each otgers w8th sticks. Just like those dances it is stupid and looks stupud as fuck but as a kid its probably fun.
---
I dont like Fortnite but im not its intended audience so its ok
---
honestly problem with ancestral for me is that the mage arena 2 capes look horrible with it. Zamorak one doesn't match the blue, Saradomin one is too blue and guthix idk. What does an ancestral recolour hurt? It makes sense, as the BiS capes are aligned to the gods too.
---
F2p quests take no time besides dragon slayer but I get your point and agree
---
Dungeoneering no, at least not as a skill
---
@dazy_ no u
---
auutmn elegy probably xD
---
Thats just a tree
---
I wouldn't want dungeoneering but something similar. Maybe custom made adventures, not in a dungeon but in an overworld environment. Different encounters, decisions, different skills used and multiple endings etc. Kinda like temple trekking expanded. Would work like a mini DnD adventure.
---
"I don't have the balls to stand behind my godfuck retarded suggestion, so I will pretend it was a joke"

yikes

Is there a Jacob that used to skate around here?
---
Thats me now

A part... 
---
Whoa cool a headband
---
I don’t like it for clue scrolls honestly. I like the concept in itself though
---
Past tense is: yote
---
What about Salve river?
---
Someone would have walked past this guy swaying trying to get a good photo while giggling to himself, wondering what the fuck.
---
There's so many quests I speedrun in order to do diaries. Fuck if I know what goes on in Keldagrim or Tai Bwo Wannai despite doing the quests.
---
Don't you do kraken when you get slayer task that has like 150 kill count? It is very afkable unlike other bosses and with decent reward I think 
---
&gt; you probably aren't going to use Nexus Teleports 1000s of times 
---
Are you sure?
---
Are you done spamming / trolling my post?
---
I make a lot of money doing this and you just cant stand it haha.
---
I can still remember running after the bastard. 
---
Something to do with lower overall max hit which dramatically reduces the exp/hr (also affects accuracy roll) or something 
---
&gt;  (chaotics were the start of the power creep problem) 
---
Blowpipe and twisted bow is already WAY stronger than Chaotics+Turmoil ever were. Also, Scythe of Vitur is more DPS than Chatoic rapier+turmoil. We are past the pre-eoc powercreep already lmao.
---
Maybe because you aren't going to visit the dungeon 1,142 times
---
There is also 6k/h method that requires alts
---
Took me 3.1k kills to get the hilt BTW

make the med clue green cuz ranger boots
---
Holy shit swiftkit! 
---
I think that rerolling individual clue steps would be a good addition.
---
I get the point of, "Well it's incentive to meet those requirement and progress your account." While I fully understand that as someone who has experienced it many times on RS3 and OSRS, rerolling 1 step every let's say even every 3 clues will not allow you to skip EVERYTHING you can't already do and even if you leave it had it down to 1 clue you can't complete the odds that you'll NEVER get it without a reroll ready is very low and realistically you'd probably get it within a fairly low clue count.
---
Now the thing that I feel a fair number of people should realize is there are some just outright annoying clue steps and I don't mean quest or skill requirements but instead things like some of the Falo the Bard item requirements or even just annoying to reach locations on occasion that take multiple minutes even at your fastest.
---
I will also say, it'd be a potentially nice work around if maybe making it that when you unlock the clue milestone items a secondary effect of the item itself can be allowing you to skip X steps a day. For example: Heavy Casket from doing 200 elites and from then on you can use the Heavy Casket let's say 5 times a day to reroll an elite clue step.
---
I would like to see some sort of use that isn't simply cosmetic be given to the milestone clue items such as the clue bag and I could see an animation for each one possibly being added to each aside from the hard clue which IS an animation, that would in a way make a reroll make sense.
---
Easy gives you the Large Spade, can make it that you can "search" X times a day and find a "new clue" which would just reroll the current step on the one you have.
---
Medium gives you the Clueless Scroll which can have an option like "Investigate" that would of course reroll the clue step in your inventory by looking into the Clueless Scroll and figuring out a "different route" for your clue
---
Hard is a Uri transformation emote, honestly I'm not entirely sure but it does open a briefcase so it could just be that you pull a "new clue" out of it when opened which of course would reroll your hard clue step.
---
Elite is the Heavy Casket, simple enough can pry it open for a second and squeeze a "new clue" out which AGAIN would reroll the step.
---
Master clue gives you the Scroll Sack which is probably the easiest one. You dig through the scrolls and pull out, "a new clue" which of course rerolls your clue step and you go from there.
---
Honestly the only reason I really want a reroll system is that there is some really annoying to reach clues but it's not like it's a challenge to do so, it's just time consuming and annoying at times.
---
HE REALLY ONLY PICKS UP RANARR AND SNAP SEEDS

Hey man, it's a doggy dog world out there

Is that Brendan Frasier?

Facts too bad it’s been dead 😓😓😓😓😓
---
I've been waiting for rangers to stop being 30M+; about damn time. Fuck yeah woohoo stackable cloos!
---
I’m gonna need some evidence.
---
Trash.
---
Make it require sacrificing the relevant pet and I’m on board.
---
That's the argument of original commenter
---
What is this? A screenshot of a picture?
---
Felt like 2 years ago tbh
---
Vorkath
---
Because they are brawny instead of brainy
---
So you're saying that because person A is camping a certain NPC its bad because more items that person A gets, makes the economy worse. 
---
I don't understand lol what's the difference between alts and a higher player base? 
---
I love doing barrows for cash. You barely need anything to do it. And with Moritania hard diaries it’s pretty profitable 
---
This is true; and stackable clues wouldn’t really impact that method as much as they would the collection of clues passively through activities like slayer or nests/bottles while just afking woodcutting. I just think a lot more clues would end up in the game and get finished because of this update.
---
Legit not reading any of that. If you intentionally kill someone you know just got a pet, you're a douche.
---
And you seem to be one of them, you don't have to be hostile :) 
---
I used it as a reference. That is all.
---
It's a no from me. Trashy idea 
---
Idk Runescape has forced me into a life of celibacy. If I grew up on the other I'd be a massive normie and actually have a life.
---
Does it work if I already have membership or do I have to be F2P to claim it?
---
Just an advice, OP probably never heard of Runelite
---
To me it just seems like such a standard thing to do, and to see him making a post about it and pat himself on the back just comes across as self gratifying. Oh and link his stream, so we can catch him in the act again :'))
---
RIP :(
---
I was lvl 125 cb when those curse prayers came out and experienced that distinct feeling of dread that things really aren't the same anymore, the world is changing whether you care or not and there's no way of going back.
---
Pretty sure I logged out at the duel arena there and then and never returned.
---
Honestly Soloscape is probably the reason I play Runescape over other MMOs, and most other games as well. I don't have to worry so much about other players dictating how much fun I have.
---
I'll admit, I am fairly antisocial. But I understand people don't think/feel the way I do. I'd gladly support more content directed more towards the multiplayer aspect of the game. (As long as BiS items/Diaries aren't gated behind them heh)
---
We need miasma and vls
---
Okay so now any pker (skulled) at lava maze who gets hit by a team gets a free teleport to level 17 wilderness? Makes no sense at all
---
Found the slayallday player.
---
It's such a shitty opinion to have too, it does affect the game, because it's reflected in the poll results.
---
This generation of people with the mindset that they can't *just put up/deal with it.* smh.
---
Cooking fletching firemaking hitpoints 
---
I remember when the ditch came out one point people made was that it removed one tile of level 1 wilderness. This sounds like it would bring it back. 
---
Have it so that Jagex release the update in one world and only people who have spend x amount of time and did the update things are able to vote for it. I know this wont work for thinks like the spell resize stuff but it will work for bigger changes. 
---
first guy already said it
---
c engineer is that you?
---
I think it’s lowest ping that isn’t a total-level world. I’ve never had a total level world selected for me by default 
---
Apex has taken a ton of features from other games.
---
That can work both ways.  
---
If you're saying Apex has all the best features, what's to stop FN copying them as well?
---
I prefer Apex myself, but FN is still the more popular game and it's not going to go anywhere soon.
---
Maybe set the stack size limit to 2 so you still can finish your task or whatever and not have to leave
---
Yeah, found that out the hard way ;n;   
---
I think, from what I've read, skill 508 gets me in. We'll see, almost there! :D
---
I've had about 15 cannons at kalphite cave with a clan cause some noob got crashed by a pure lmao
---
Building is what made Fortnite unique imo. I loved build battles, being able to outsmart my opponent to give myself the advantage and outplay someone I could tell knew what they were doing made it really rewarding at times. I understand people’s arguments about the shooting mechanics, and I definitely agree that it desperately needed work. However, I enjoyed that Fortnite was more focused on building than shooting because that’s what set the skill gap and made it so diverse. You could completely shit on people, or be completely shit on and that’s what made it fun. I quit playing a while back though when I could tell the direction of the game was heading much more casual and the thrill I was getting from playing started to dim out.
---
pretty eye opening
---
But it was a huge upgrade compared to existing BRs.
---
You realize your account even it somehow gets unbanned will have no stats on osrs right? Just make a new account if you want to play.
---
Praise Geraldo.
---
Got my kbd pet on 59kc
---
Nevermind
---
*Woah!* It's your **5th Cakeday** mrprotatoe! ^(hug)
---
The Legacy Combat Mode came out in 2014, and you had pre-eoc on RS3 again.
---
Osrs really lacks in quests. But some of the ones we have gotten have been great (DS2 for example). 
---
I'm currently 80 attack / 82 strength / 75 defense / 84 ranged / 70 prayer / 71 magic
---
What should my gear be for barrows?
---
Yeah, i was super excited for it too. 
---
I've not played it, only watched gameplay, nothing seems "new" imo they're just taking parts from different genres and mashing them together
---
I got bored of battle royals a while ago
---
almost like it's a game for kids lol
---
Working good here. 
---
So excited! Ah well, managed to get 44 smithing so now I have a sweeeet steel 2h though :D   
---
b-but he said you did!!
---
You can still play on legacy-only worlds on RS3.
---
There were some massive database leaks recently so you were probably a victim of that (like I was)
---
seeing /r/gaming talk about fortnite is very funny. people hate a game so much 
---
Sounds like you bad at the game my dude
---
RuneScape trap remixes are fire
---
It’s not your world it’s jagexs world
---
Not every month has the same number of days mate
---
I think it's also a combination of not enjoying the game and constantly being confronted with it. Like I do not enjoy the game but will not obsessively hatetalk about it. I do however hate it more and more every single day because my nephews won't shut up about it. Like for real, all they talk about is fortnite to the point where my aunt had to forbid fortnite talk during dinner time...
---
Not anymore.
---
&gt;just taking parts from different genres and mashing them together
---
I guess we'll never see a "new" game of any genre then.
---
So a comp cape. That's a completionist cape.
---
OPs picture suggests otherwise
---
was more like 2.5 i guess
---
got 100k to start with from my friend then did waterwall witch house and the holy grail
---
go to a f2p world derp
---
They are really cheap and poorly made
---
A hunger games/fortnite style OSRS minigame would be hella fun though
---
Jhardy3891 (Lindz), JT, Adam, Brett, I miss all of you guys.  Especially Brett and JT.   I'd be an entirely different being if it weren't for you two.   And thanks Lindz for always being like a supportive older sis.  I love and miss all you guys.
---
actually im the derp. gg no re
---
The only way I know to be able to log in again is buying membership with your debit/credit card or if you have an rs3 account with enough gp to buy a bond. 
---
I have to be honest. I don't care for PVP content, but I don't see the point of having a ditch. It definitely conveys a message of going into the wilderness, but when I'm doing clues it annoys me going through that jumping animation all the time. 
---
As someone who only really plays for clue scrolls and slayer, I have to say this is the update I've been waiting for.
---
The break comes between slater tasks, you do your clues then. 
---
There is nothing worst than setting up for a cannon task only to get a clue on the first kill. 
---
You are putting this on you, if you leave your clues to stack up, that's your problem.
---
CRAAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIIN
---
Well I actually quit before that, but when I tried coming back I didnt like it because it didnt remind me of runescape that's all, i felt like they were unique with the 99 hp cap. Now it just felt like any other mmo
---
75-90 prayer - what is the most cost efficient way to do this? wildy altar?
---
Are you mad ?
---
I like osrs' artstyle, I'd be happy with just an update to the water personally.
---
I have been playing Runescape on and off since the Scythe (Halloween 2003), and I drank my first ever Saradomin Brew this month lmao
---
Shout out to Masors. Best drop parties in the game back in the day.

Someone, make a Runelite plugin to swap the Steve to Nieve if the quest is completed.

Best range weapon at 86 for XP while doing Slayer
---
Im not rich and have a blowpipe and drsgon cbow but only use the blowie when have a slow task. Otherwise d cbow with aemthyst broads is pretty quick. 
---
Is this the best method? Is cbow better than msb (i)
---
Please help 
---
it no longer says anything about 6 months and says I have bought the upgrade? no 6 months membership was received only 3and now there is no option for the 6? how is this my confusion? yes I am confused but at what was on my screen in the bond menu in game?
---
I'd love to try it, but it's nearly impossible to get a game going.
---
Faster than banking
---
I really like the idea of a low limit and being based on the tier. 5 for easy, 4 med, 3 hard, 2 elite, and 1 master seems perfect to me.
---
RUNESCAPE BEST
---
FeelsBootMan
---
The very first one does as well. I stood about 3 spaces away from it's spawn when I got my firecape as I got one shot once before due to Jad not visually being there lol.
---
Quality lol 
---
Wow, one man's opinion? Well that completely changes everything!
---
If you think people pk with a D long, outside of one little YouTuber, you're deadass wrong lmao. 
---
The thing is that clues are one of the few aspects of the game that is inefficient. If you want to be efficient xp wise you don't have to do the clues, but if you enjoy doing clues you can chose to stop your current activity and get a chance at a good reward for doing so. If they become stackable it will make clues just a passive bonus from the continuous slayer grind that you can cash in whenever you feel like.
---
I've never ever touched RS3 and I am underage so I can't make purchases online, also I have never bought bonds with real money...
---
It did nothing to the game besides make the numbers you hit seem bigger. If you were going to hit a 30 or 31 now you might hit a 302. It would just be like if your hits could have decimal places now. Bigger numbers are better I suppose.
---
She still in the cage? Hope you feed her...
---
I got it on my 3rd try using tank gear and rune darts. Definitely expensive, but it worked. I'd say the biggest challenge itself is being confident that you can do it. It's a pain in the ass getting all the way to Jad, but the hardest part about that is not falling asleep since you'll be there for over an hour.
---
Good meme but downvoted because of your autistic watermark

Tf do you want out of watermarking? Do you need attention that badly?

Amazing graphic this is really cool to see

I never going to win again. Cause I'm never playing Fortnite again 
---
-5 hey ma , i made it to the top of the most disliked comment! 
---
Girl that plays rsrs3? must be a pmod
---
Yeah, but we’re also playing a 15+ year old java game that was once thought to be for kids. 
---
as an RS3 and OSRS player the same can be said for RS3 borrowing things that OSRS has done, QOL stuff is a big one I remember
---
Generally if it gets added to the game they'll get a NPC named after them.
---
You're on a runescape subreddit critising someone's fashion choices. Ha
---
your title doesnt make any sense.....
---
No, the current situation is a balanced trade off. You do the clue immediately and take a break from what you're doing or you carry on without the need to bank with the trade off of not getting another clue. If you could get more than 1 of a specific clue type, there is no balance because the only efficient thing to do would be to wait until you were next going to bank anyway.
---
This has to be the shittiest flex in history. No one gives a shit about your wins lol. 
---
you literally haven't played it so whats the point of sharing your opinion
---
Saradomin has forsaken us
---
Stay salty kids
---
The game shouldn't be made easier for the sake of lazy people.
---
Just looked up my old usernames and yeah...nobody is looking for me
---
There was also a time where free runes spawned so you could pick up barrages and actually profit. I got 99 magic before that was done. 
---
Same feelstheworstman
---
Its for the coloured blind people.
---
Realm royale probably has a smaller playerbase than the RuneScape forums
---
Idk, bright cartoony graphics do work when they're done right. For example, Splatoon has a great visual style
---
Though it certainly doesn't hurt that it's also just a good game all around, which fortnite isn't :') 
---
But its not like u can fight him whenever you want ;)
---
no skill is thrilling lmao
---
I think you mean devils advocate, pedestal and bated breath my friend :)
---
I'm not reading what you said in your page long rant. We are talking about a specific situation, if you are talking about something different, go for it.
---
&gt; Clearly youre perfectly comfortable only seeing things from your own biased view though, and thats fine.
---
Yes, I disagree with your opinion - what bias do I have?
---
I'm not happy with the proposal. This is more money than any Karamjan has seen. I was ok with the alternative metal dragons entrance because it didn't impose on Saniboch's purpose and lore. That's the point I'm trying to make. But thanks for the concept explanation.
---
After Harry Potter's aunt said dastardly things, he got angry and lost touch of his telepathic magic blowing her up so large that her clothes and wig were blown clean off or her, and as she floats away she then decides to pleasure herself before becoming a weather balloon or getting hit by a plane.

From an oak larder in his POH probably.

Better than all those characterless karma farming recolor suggestions. Everyone keeps saying no but these brainlets somehow keep finding their way to the upvote button.

Trimming dragons 5k each.

Other methods include cleaning samples in the Varrock museum and delivering books in the Arceuus library. 
---
Sorry I had an "ahcktually" moment.
---
Solid advice for OP btw.
---
I'd imagine it's to not make it too OP. It would completely devalue a lot of the benefits from those spell books. Obviously Lunars/Ancients good for other things, but still.
---
I thought the same thing when I built mine too
---
And thats why they are going to be the rarest things on the beginner drop table if implemented. 
---
Get back to me when the OSRS GE is filled with people with gigantic glowing wings and fire particle effects coming out their arse.

Was reading the comments and apparently he's able to do it due to him having the max cape (which has the same perk as the smithing cape (acts as goldsmith gloves when worn)).
---
So without swapping between goldsmith and ice gloves he's able to shave a few seconds off of each run. 
---
Makes total sense, I was wondering why is ice gloves were also not in his inventory 
---
MSB(i) definitely beats Rune xbow w/ broad bolts against monsters with low defense, not sure about DCB.
---
However, imo Slayer monsters seem to tend to have some Ranged Def of some kind so I usually find myself bringing Rune xbow/ Broads.
---
I also like the bigger hits, what can I say
---
All I see are a bunch of dumbasses talking shit to you about your setup man. I’m sorry that the elitist community of this game are too proud to help you out and provide useful tips. Good luck on your runs. 
---
Yeah it happens when you click a pool and it moves nearby without despawning. Kinda worded that weird but hope I sound right

Really cool suggestion, support!

When you finish recipe for disaster buy all the chocolate bars from the chest every day that is a easy 100k a day so 1.4m from just that. Haven't played awhile, but energy potions need chocolate bars so always in demand.

I swear to god if anyone shits on Farming Simulator I'm gonna flip shit

I play with bad internet and I’ve been to jad like 6 or so times in the past month. It’s crazy how a spike to 500ms will immediately waste an hour and a half of your life. 
---
forsen1 ANY BAJS?
---
I just used Prossy Top/Verac Skirt/Nezzy Helm/ Mage arena 2 cape/ occult / trident of sea/ holy sandals / book of darkness or zammy book / barrows gloves / ring slot is whatever
---
Can do a 16 kill inv. if you reset stats before each run with like 6-7 ppots/ 6-7 sharks and bring space to hold all the runes so you don't need to bank or drop things
---
You can actually still do it like that even with glove switches but the timing is really hard to get down. I would say realistic rates are 320-340k and that just requires very fast banking. Chances are @op you aren't banking fast enough or you're not retrieving bars at the south side.
---
Now search for ‘peg asian’ on xnxx :)

Also do herb runs every hour, try to plant ranarr seeds and do fairy tale pt1 for magic secuturs boosts crop yield while wearing em.
---
aight! whats ac btw?  
---
This is the first time hearing this since the original plans for zeah if i am not wrong. 
---
for starters don't write every word with a capital letter
---
Idk how people don't get the reference but ye it do be like that
---
Not sure how good it'll be with 42 def, if you are maxing then you should get that up. Yes it is worth doing with no bgs but you might have to do like 1 kill trips. Use BP with addy darts
---
Not worth without BGS but fine without DHCB can use blowpipe instead. Blowpipe is better than Dragon crossbow.
---
That just reminds me of how awful 2007 was and it really was the beginning of the end. 
---
G.E. altough it is extremly usefull, it killed the W1/W2 community and merching.
---
Removal of free trade and PvP was just another nail in the coffin and a skill like summoning changing the meta for everything, making all bosses EZ as fuck. 
---
Only thing that I like from the other timeline is that they have more quests, but not a surprise if their team is much bigger and has some more creative talent on board then OSRS team has tbh.
---
Glad we have OSRS, it isn't perfect but it is damn close.
---
U can make pedophile jokes and get permed or die fall asleep and lose all your gear
---
I loved it though 
---
Thanks for this, I'll try lining the monsters up better and using my minimap more. I knew about the wave 62 orange mage spawn but not the level 45 spawn on wave 3; good to know. 
---
And no need to apologize for the wall of text as this is a lot of good info. 
---
Recolors for BIS gear should be a reward from a new nh pvp minigame.  Even the most die hard anti-pvp, pvm only players, will go try pvp to get a hold of some ancestral recolors XD 
---
ffs prayers
---
Use them on the banker and hold 1, its quicker than opening the bank interface, withdrawing and clicking back out.
---
Just play ever other FPS for that experience then
---
Zulrah &amp; void range nerf maybe?
---
Had this whole subreddit up in flames about how zulrah and void were now dead content.
---
Only if they add in game lore that says the man who wore the amour did indeed find his very own sun.
---
I’m aware of the feature but remove placeholders and adding them in tend to knock me out of tabs, as well as getting certain quantity of potions or food so once I initially put my gear on I stop using it. And the annoying part isn’t the fact I have to put the gear on, it’s that I have to setup my bank for quick banking.
---
Or you could just do whatever you enjoy most and not worry about what other people think :)
---
That Blowpipe looks a bit archlighty.
---
It still completely baffles me how hard the community got ignored despite the massive outcry. It's like they didn't want to let the amount of work go to waste and just said fuck it.
---
How about matching clue scroll color with gem tier colors?
---
Beginner - Sapphire Blue
---
Easy - Emerald Green
---
Medium - Ruby Red
---
Hard - Diamond White
---
Elite - Dragonstone Purple
---
Master - Onyx Black
---
That skill made me quit runescape back then lol. I just couldn’t get into it even though I had all the skills to do it effectively. 
---
HAHA YES I AM ALSO IN ON THE JOKE HAHA TWITCH CHAT OH MY
---
Zulrah was even better than it is now? hahah that must've been ridiculous
---
I don’t know, to be honest. Haha, I’m 50 con myself and I believe I just used Iron nails, but don’t take my word on those being the best nails to use.  
---
Thanks for this. Huh, so if I do get the blowpipe I don't need my shield. I may end up getting rid of it then if it isn't used elsewhere. As for the darts and scales I'll look into getting some. 
---
Thanks for explaining brews and restores as I will definitely do that for my next attempt.
---
Alright, I didn’t think of that yet. 
---
Yeah, good idea tbh.
---
Arclight is not op 😅
---
SEA SHANTY 2!!!!
---
I was but I realized that I basically described Deadman Mode
---
i mean there's good soundclown stuff
---
but then there's the shit you posted
---
Recently My chat has started to notify every 10th kill I have left on task, and it fills my chat with "You still need to kill x monsters to complete your current Slayer assignment". I have no idea how it got on and I have no clue on how to turn it off. Could someone please help me sort this out? 
---
Around 300k is also max for me. I dont ehp tryhard that much though
---
if your slayer level is high enough to get decent money making tasks then just use the blowpipe. the time you save will make up for any costs to use it.  
---
lets say you spend 10 hours doing slayer tasks with the msb or dcb, those same tasks would have been done with a blowpipe in 7-8 hours, and then now you have an extra 2-3 hours that you wouldn't otherwise have had, to make money to offset the cost of using it.  
---
if you're still not convinced on using the blowpipe, the other response is also correct, use MSB + rune arrows for lower defence stuff and DCB for higher defence targets.
---
lol effigyscape that was such a bad time for skilling

It's number of days after "day 0" (22 feb 2013 for OSRS, 10 aug 2007 for RS) where that item entered the game. So the table shows which game got the different items first. E.g. it took OSRS 1414 days to get d claws (Chambers of Xeric) while it only took RS 475 days (While Guthix Sleeps).

(actually, RS3 has clue scrolls too)

Maddox, is that you?!

Gilded isnt gold. Its gold plated rune.

STONEMAKE NOT FAST

Osrs quests make my eyes bleed but I tend to actually pay attention to whats going on in quests in rs3 as they got some cool stuff going on.
---
Damn. Chill with the hard R's.

Knight of the templar legion at your service.

hes a real life friend of mine so this is pretty awesome, my name on rs is/was lee thal, few others in our group who played were tonyballs, ollie osprey.
---
I know he went pretty hard on construction when it first came out!
---
Ones I've tried basically tasted like nothing... Then I'd rather grab a kiwi
---
I know there’s an alt method, which you can use a runner alt and get like 500k an hr if you really want to get it done fast. 
---
Or he's just speaking the truth.
---
Some trap music is ok.
---
But he literally uses so many of the same samples every single song.
---
It's really low effort, because the melody is already there he's just gotta brute force a "drop" in there and boom, shit track done.
---
you don't always need to drink 3 brew doses before using a super restore if you're close to full HP and/or need the prayer points, but a single super restore dose will restore all the stat loss from up to 3 brew doses, so it makes more sense to drink a brew 3 times then restore than say, 2 times, restore and then brew again.  
---
you don't need to wait for your health to be fully healed from 3 brew doses before drinking them because one, brews can heal you above max HP and two, you'll have way more than a restores than brews because you need prayer points far more than HP in the caves.  
---
it's very unlikely that you'll have brews left over but not enough super restores to counteract the stat loss from them - you could probably drink a restore after one brew dose and you'd still have restores left over. brew efficiency does not really matter in the fight caves.
---
i didn’t say it wasn’t faster. however, there are close teleports that only take a minuscule amount of time longer so they’re not really worth it. 
---
This subreddit taught me it's good to vote against stuff simply because it belongs to a content type I don't partake in and don't think other people should partake in.  I don't want Jagex to spend time on stuff I don't care about

I quit for a whole year after release of GE on osrs, Osrs felt much more fun and old school without the ge.

Must have been an added feature then, last I ran out of membership was years ago and I had to renew it manually, although there weren't bonds then either.

Yeah all other changes do come from BH or TT, but there’s nothing wrong with having the DHCB being like the slayer helm in my opinion

A name tag in the backpack would solve that to a degree, plus, they could make it so that each colour gets progressively darker or lighter as you go through the tiers so that you don't necessarily have to be able to see the colour to identify it. (Beginner would have a white binding, and master would have a black one) furthermore, they could just leak the colour pallets to the devs of third party clients to make a colour blind mode or just the ability to customize the colours of each tier.
---
You gambled it away and now you're getting all shitty because someone isn't comforting you??
---
That's fucking hilarious. Don't gamble, it doesn't suit you.
---
Quit being a queer he’s not that cool

DUDE. I can’t look anything up without accidentally typing “osrs” before whatever I’m searching. It’s terrible. I think about this a lot. I’m glad I’m not the only one!
---
just start flipping shit. 
---
I honestly think max capes should be way more customizable than they are. You beat the game you've earned a cape in your image.
---
Trap is a horrendous genre and they're an insult to the original versions. 
---
And this is why people who say they should release original servers and never update them ever are ignorant. All those small little things add up into making a the game feel good to play

i only really care about the imps. remember when the imps looked like little gnomes in a devil jumpsuit? i was pissed when they changed those in ~2006 and was disappointed when i came back to osrs and it had the updated imps
---
the demons and dragons used to look cooler and less cartoony too but i could live without those if we got the good imps back
---
Nah. Go with RuneScape metals.
---
Beginner: Bronze
---
Easy: Steel
---
Medium: Mithril
---
Hard: Adamant
---
Elite: Rune
---
Master: Dragon.
---
How do you know he killed himself
---
Oh honey no
---
you're right
---
Or a mix of both. (Also RuneLite is inevitably going to find a way to let you apply custom colours to the scrolls if that's what they go with)
---
Yeah Idk exactly what hoops YouTubers have to jump through in order to provide music without getting strikes on their channel. I won’t complain if someone uses osrsbeatz. I love it when people use Zelda, Mario, Metroid and other video game music haha

Mobile users = cucks confirmed.

Probably not interested to play anymore since theres no more XP left to gain.

Just missing monk robes

Follow dancers take note.

Don't see what the streaming part has to do with it

Oh well, I could care less about reddit points lol. I just feel like this whole swampletics thing is a huge bandwagon. I’ve seen his videos, they’re okay. But nothing to whine about for sure lol

I'd still do Seers. I personally hated Falador.

Buyers do get banned sometimes. If it’s a high amount. But it’s usually temp ban (rwt minor)

The white-fleshed ones are pretty bland but the red/pink ones are much better. Still subtle, though.

The cape should give the same stats... i dont get this company.

Quests unlock so many useful things in the game (such as fossil island, experiments, every dragon weapon, etc) for characters so definitely quests.

Why does this look like b0aty

I wanted to do something like this, but I have zero photoshop skills. So I figured I’d just post this idea which keeps the clue scrolls looking nostalgic like they did in our childhood, to get the community thinking about new ideas.

Hopefully better artists than me can read these comments and get some good ideas to post within the next few weeks.

Warding skill should allow us to combine max cape and ice gloves

I never gave a shit about watching anyone play anything. I definitely don't like being part of a bandwagon mass either.  I like his videos though. and the memes and nonsensical hype surrounding it I like just as much.

And very recently when they did the 45min countdown to hotfix the pures getting levelled by the combat style issue:
---
Guy 1: “Giving away T bowzzz”
---
Guys2,3,4,5: “OMG wtf thanks so much!!!”
---
Guy 6: haha yeah server rollback in 45 mins 
---
Guy 7: Give me your bonk
---
Then someone falls for it and gives him their bank thinking it will be reset in 45 mins
---
This is a really good point!
---
Learn the maps before you take any actual gear in, I just started out doing pistol runs on factory since it's the smallest map you force yourself into pvp situations.
---
Gear and armour is more important than guns early on, do the quests (tasks) that you can get from the traders to level up, sell the quest items afterwards on the flee market to make money

Watch a few YouTubers aswell, [veritas](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCkS33XH4KH0IqD2S2-f7ovA/videos) is one of my favourites

They make you login to the “forums” to comment on a post, but it’s a disguised site to steal your login info.

Says "You need to be within the mage training arena to enchant dragonstone jewelery".
---
They have phishing "forum" links in the description.
---
Skillcapes all have the same stats, no exceptions. The Ranged Cape only has the Ava's effect, not the stats. But the Ava's effect with tankier stats is useful for Ranged, but the God affinity with Tankier stats would be questionable for Magic...
---
This is a great idea!
---
The giveaway is you clicking a link on the video and then you get a free keylogger
---
the problem was... people played for over 5 years where the hits were  mostly between 0-35, so when you saw a 32 - your brain was like wow thats a big hit! Then after they changed the hit system you would hit 71, 154, 267 - everything felt big and there was no longer that feeling of "oh wow I just hit something special". You had to convert everything you saw. So, you hit a 267 and star thinking: Ok, thats like 26.7, round up, so thats like a 27 - but that thinking takes time and you have to be paying attention + convert to understand what you just hit. This was 1000 times less enjoyable than just sitting back watching hits and being able to see what you're hitting right the way. 
---
A good handful of idiots i see here, all this stuff is pre-eoc/rs3, its just when hd was getting released, people need to relax.
---
They had an open beta for like a year and no one played it to give them feedback.

So they put it in and everyone was surprised and they were like "we had a beta where you could have told us these problems... but barely anyone played it"

In my post I did level; Lumbridge and P2P has lots of blue in it, noobs show up as green, mid level players show up as yellow, max players show up as red, etc.

I’ve heard someone suggest colors; bronze, adamant, rune, dragon, etc.

And I’ve heard someone suggest gem colors:

Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby, Diamond, Onyx, Zenyte. (I like this idea). 
---
It says exactly: This spell can only be cast on dragonstone amulets, rings, necklaces and bracelets and on shapes in the mage training area. 
---
Except the fact that literally every element was based on your cb or skilling levels, which all allowed you newer/better shit within the dungeons, and also allowed training of all those various skills.
---
Im all for Void ornament kits, Void looks clapped af and im not getting it on my account just yet because of it

You can cast it anywhere on the first things except “shapes in the mage training arena”

Like I said, I would love to see both in-game because they are absolutely beautiful. Just had to point out that they go against what combined max capes are for. I would still vote a big fat yes if it were polled tomorrow though.
---
Thanks! It’s definitely attainable. I really wanted to get the cape at 85, which is the minimum cb lvl to finish all quests, but unfortunately, some quests give pretty decent XP that you can’t avoid 🙁.  I finished roughly my last ~12 quests at level 86.

Definitely ability to bring up images within the current page, and interact with it (i,e. zoom) and return to the page without issue.

&gt; having to constantly regear and find new worlds because I break to do clues is not fun
---
Then don't do it if it's not fun. The game is meant to be fun.
---
&gt;And no, 3rd Age wouldn't be alch value and rewards wouldn't all be ruined because players could have an extra clue or two at a time; that is just assumption and exaggeration
---
That's a slight misrepresentation of my point. I was referring more to d hide boots, pages, cosmetics, and some armour.
---
I think it's a cool mechanic to only be able to have one clue of a tier at a time. If nothing else, it makes them feel special.

Why would you think i'm triggered by telling you what I think? If you're directly linking people to someone botting i'm going to assume it's you aren't I.

Theyre adding his robes into the warding skill

No because that was me and your stupid arse fucking messed it up so I couldnt work out what one he was.

I am Dutch and it doesn't really sound Dutch to me lol unless it's a reference to Neckerman or something but then it still uses a word that has racist implications

Who is jojo3000

Are you that upset? Shut the fuck up kiddo lol as if he won’t get banned. BotWatch will find him, if you ever watched a Jagex live stream of them catching bots and had any sort of brains rather than a pile of ramen noodles, you’d know this.

You're retarded

None of the hoods have effects

There should be a reply button, usually when there is not that means that the "case" is closed, they do that when a problem is solved, It would surprise me if that was the case based on what you are saying, so maybe if you really cant find it, tag them on twitter or post a new support explaining this and telling them your option, they should be able to redirect you

Why would I link that if it would be mine ? Wouldn't I get banned from the game for doing that ?

Slayer is a buyable skill, it doesnt make you money unless you want 1000hours to 99.
---
I guess one odd reason could be if you're only like 60-70 slayer and still low Cb stats because you could train with slayer.. but if you're like me with your acc build done and slayer is still only 80s and you really don't seek to do end game slayer on the account til you're done with 45 def then that's perfectly fine....the second reason is i guess everyone assumes were all 99 slayer with Rc as or lowest skill

I'm not the one that thinks Jagex's bot detection is the best thing since sliced bread. It's fucking awful and they rely on the reports of players and timing of clicks, which with a good bot is easy to trick the "best bot detection agency" according to you.

---
Blast Furnace is not in Zeah, you don't need Lovakengj favour. The only thing you 'need' to be able to access Blast Furnace is completion of the Giant Dwarf quest.  
---
You need to supply your own ore like you would usually when smithing. 
---
While those are the requirements, there are a few things that make Blast Furnace easier: having ice gloves, 60 smithing and a coal bag.  
---
Ice gloves mean you can pick up the bars immediately after they get smelted, otherwise you either have to wait for them to cool down (like a few seconds) or get a bucket of water - there is a bucket spawn and water source at Blast Furnace it's just slower than if you had ice gloves.
---
To use the Blast Furnace on any world you either need to have 60 smithing or pay the foreman 2500 every 10 minutes to use it. It's not much, it's just annoying when you're about to deposit your ore and the time runs out meaning you have to go back to the bank and withdraw some money.  
---
This is separate to the cost of using Blast Furnace on the designated worlds, where there are dwarves that automate the process that actually let you smith bars there. It costs 72k per hour on these worlds but even smithing iron bars is profitable that it pays for itself.  
---
A coal bag more or less doubles your inventory space since you can carry 27 coal in the bag and 27 ore rather than just 28 ores, which lets you smith more bars per hour. Not necessary but it's really beneficial if you do.

Both, technically. I found out what all of the minimum levels to complete all quests were I set out to raise those before doing most quests, but as it goes, quests can give good XP, so some levels were accomplish along the way.  Additionally, I found out what quests would allow me to boost levels in order to complete them, and which ones wouldn’t.  For example, you need  72 mining to complete Making Friends with My Arm, but I got my skill to 69, then I boosted to 72 using the dragon pick’s special attack.  On the opposite side, Dragon Slayer 2 needs a bunch of level requirements, but you can’t boost any of them.
---
My guess is a one hour mute doesn't require case-by-case mute reviews. Less labor for Jagex, even if it's not as effective.
---
40% of promotions my ass...they all go to the useless old shits that have been there since 'Nam. 
---
Definitely good AFK method though can confirm.
---
Ikr. Looks great!
---
Pretty much every 6th age quest involving gods were whack too. I don’t like that the RS gods became a group of edgy psuedo-deep guys that have godlike powers but don’t have godlike powers
---
Is there a daddy set 😍
---
Sorry about your dad, that is insanely stressful. I’ve been in a bad place and thought “hey my luck has to turn up eventually” And i proceeded to buy scratchers/stake in duel arena - but life has a funny way of telling you, you can always lose more. My advice is to sit tight, don’t do anything rash and brace this bad storm, better days are on there way!
---
P.s ignore the hate, those who have never been in a tough position can’t relate till it happens to them 
---
Imagine justifying being a racist 
---
All I just want is that the tabs are moved all the way to the left or right - no gap please, it's wasted space atm... (since the gap is no click zone)
---
Agreed. I am always against cult of personalities. I hate when people overrate other people for some actions. No one's a god in here we all human
---
It's because it changed the names really. and i think the hitsplats looked different as well. Anything that takes a hit to nostalgia really pisses off RS fans.
---
Its called HC UIM
---
It’s not like the disconnections are Jagex’s fault though so I don’t agree with them changing it cause of people’s ISP’s.
---
If you want a max cape and enjoy all facets of the game then have fun with warding. Don’t complain about it. You think people enjoy RC, thieving and agility? You’re not gonna like everything in the world bud. 
---
Still didn’t crop it though 😘
---
 
---
Is this copypasta? If not, holy shit
---
Yeah.
---
Assuming they fixed the bugs that happened on release (pretty sure they did). 
---
There was no eventuality where eoc could be fixed for the players who didn't like it without it being removed completely. That was the problem. I don't want to go and put in feedback, and have jagex think "Oh, we just have to tweak eoc a bit and then they will love it", no, eoc was a cancer.
---
You should check out private servers then. I am sure you can find one like this 
---
Took me 1850kc

I would love to see a throwback museum ingame where you could see what things used to be like.
---
It's good content, but mostly because it's refreshing to hear someone be genuinely enjoying the game. It's entertaining because you can hear the passion he has for the game. 
---
Ya done fucked up

Lol.
---
Ah, I know the feeling. I think the biggest part that I couldn't understand about it was that you didn't need to stand watch over your crops for the entire duration. Herb runs really didn't feel like I was doing a lot of running.
---
Pretty nice for making some money in the mid-game with little requirements, though. It's a really fun skill to train!
---
i was hoping he wasnt tbh... crybaby over litterly all updates made by jagex
---
Didn't read because of non existent formatting.
---
They actually extended it until March 3rd 
---
Is this a joke? I hope it's a joke.
---
I’ll discuss osrs with anyone before I talk about irl news. I pretty much avoid it at all costs

Pretty sure all mutes by pmods get looked at by a jmod.

Lots of people feel that it isn't a real skill, and I honestly agree. Like other skills make sense but I sitll can't even really define dungeoneering in a way that makes sense.
---
Fair, I guess it was technically Runescape 2 back then. Appreciate the contribution!
---
Are you actually claiming you have a right to not be offended by someone? LOL dude you can't be this stupid. 
---
There it is.
---
Ouch
---
So those 2 guys are the reason you dont allow me to have new content to enjoy... The problem really does not just lay with those pkers iff that what makes you vote against pvp updates. Glad Jagex is finaly going to step up against those spite no voters. Iff you dont want those toxic texts then just put your text filter on dont leave me without new content. And believe me I agree they should be muted. But just go sand crabs for 1 hours. Toxic behaviour is everywhere in the game and not just the wilderness.
---
Premier Club was extended until March 3rd then it won’t be back until
---
later this year.
---
https://payments.jagex.com/#/store/oldschool/premierclub
---
I didn’t start until episode 9 was out. I binge watched all of them in one seating. It’s really good 
---
Dont sell things to shops, use the grand exchange
---
Dang. I didn’t play osrs until like 10 hours after the initial update. Seems like more people were affected by this than I thought
---
So this now means we need 3 sets of void to have sets? Rip
---
How is jagex going to stop spite voting? 
---
Average clue took me around 3-4 minutes I'd say
---
Is it better than an armadyl crossbow? 
---
To be fair, you're not showing us what you said to them. I'm not saying you did, but the way this is cropped makes it look like you said something to them initially.
---
also from elites and masters
---
Give all hoods the effects of the exp boosting helm for their skill. 
---
Yes to the robes, but no to from clues. Even if they don't come from Warding, they are tied to Quests and I'd rather see them drop from Dragon'Hai Monks post-quest than being thrown on Clue Scrolls.
---
I wish :( You have to get some decent god pages to even break even
---
I told them “really?” I cropped it to make it less zoomed out.

---
Jagex realises polling pvp updates simply does not work. They'll be looking into alternatives.
---
The goal is to get the opponent offended hehe
---
Is it really spite to vote against something that encourages people to make your own gameplay worse? Everyone who enters the wilderness at any point is affected by updates to the wilderness. The only reason to poll exclusively pvpers for a pvp update is if the update involves 0 interaction with people who don't pvp. Tradeable rewards affect the economy, high level untradeable rewards can affect the PvM meta, and the list goes on. PvP doesn't exist in a vacuum.

I’m 22 years old and understand

I mean, by your own example, that resources in OSRS example doesn't even hold. If they removed resource drops from everything resource prices would skyrocket. Once a magic log enters the game it doesn't remain forever.

Thats just how the wilderness is. I think its smart how those methodes keep developing. There is some serious money to be earned with some methodes.

I would be 100% okay with all hoods being added to their relative skilling outfit groups. Like wc hood gets lumberjack bonus, fishing hood gets anglers, etc.

I didn’t even report the other guy, that wasn’t bad. The the n word was random and uncalled for

nice NMZ pure
---
Playing the game the way it's meant to be played is kind of irrelevant when we're literally voting on things that determine how the game is played.
---
Don't really follow OSRS anymore but does he have the cape yet/already/on a different account? Seems perfectly calm in these clips, can easily get the cape if he wants.

They have to traverse the singaporean jungles themselves and make the ingredients first as well.

Most of us are using Runelite now, it's an open source client with lots of extra features. One feature let's you sort worlds (servers) by ping time. Try playing on a world with low ping.
---
It's true that dragons are known in lore for protecting treasure. It seems odd that OSRS lore has all these people hunting for treasure and they never run into any unexpected dragons. 
---
That's not what happened, it set people to accurate
---
So what if some players can stockpile more clues? The drop rate of clues is still the same so is the drop rate of rare rewards from clues.
---
All this needs is the music to go with it. 
---
Yeah, this game is just full of some really shit people. PKers tend to be the shadiest community, you can't deny that, but no community is free of these insufferable, toxic manchildren. If you want proof go no further than Wintertodt. The topic of choice this morning was whether or not Asians should be classified as human. Like, come on...
---
Same. But I wanted to put all ideas on the table for discussion.
---
I'm bad at math :/

Also using 8 coal and runite ore and then alching the bar is less profit than just alching the ore.

Nah it's not, just runescape ge being slow asf to update.

Level 50s gmauler
---
Decimals just feel messier than whole numbers even if they function the same in practice. TBH it would actually be a good thing for OS if +1 strength bonus was always an increase to your max hit, it could help slow down the power creep by making small incremental increases have an impact instead of needing to reach a specific break point. Multiplying HP/damage by 10 lets you do that.
---
&gt; but Im getting punished
---
that's fine
---
Stand where he is or rotate the room. Npcs move east/west before moving north/south. You’re either north or south of him in this picture, he’s trying to go north east/west to get to you but cant. Changing the way npcs react is a massive game update that is unnecessary and fucks with a lot of shit.
---
Thats the reason italy rock works in fight caves for example. Changing that has TONS of repercussions

True, that 20k hard clue is always a plus

Thanks. I do have the accumulator from the quest but didn't see it referenced in the osrs wiki to use for the ranged only method.

I was afraid if I went any higher than 1m people would be like, "Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"

He cares more about the lifespan of the game than pushing out updates that contributes to lowering it.
---
How about Blue/Green/Red/White/Purple/Black to match the gem colors?
---
My man that is not what quality of life means.
---
Lol. I don't understand why you would ask about their reactions?? Their reactions were hilarious, end of story. Wtf is this 
---
lmao I did Kebos hard a week or so ago and I didn't even notice that, thanks for letting me know
---
While I don't agree with your point about the Chasm of Fire b/c the Stronghold cave is easily accessible via Spirit Tree, it's important to note that this suggestion is less intended to add accessibility to hard to reach places and less intended to increase efficiency, but rather intended to keep the Slayer Ring at the same "power level" that it had on release by expanding the amount of teleport destinations in proportion to the amount of Slayer-relevant areas that have been added.
---
I don't think anyone really goes to Tarn's Lair, but if an area like Tarn's Lair has been added since the release of the Slayer Ring (I can't think of any off the top of my head, maybe something like Brine Rat Caves or Black Mask Dudes Dungeon) I'd suggest it being added.
---
He'll be back. And in greater numbers

Im not hoarding anything, i have slots for every gem, cut and uncut, every herd ive found so far, every seed, log, ore, and armour piece i need (that isnt alchable or outright worthless), i also have slots for every special weapon i have so far, and gear swaps...

Oh and im an ironman.

Ah I had a bit of a ldr with her for about a year in 07 I remember her logging back in around 2010-2011 when I happened to be checking on the game and we exchanged Facebook names but I never added her I just know her home life was awful and while we don’t live in neighboring states anymore or even the same country for that matter I was genuinely curious about her well being and how she’s doing in life 
---
I like my 75 attack 90 strength 44 prayer build. Keeps combat low and open to use any and all KO weapons.

I don't remember resting at all and I could've sworn dungeoneering was like 2008.
---
Im an ironman, i cant jsut not have those resources ready
---
Thanks. I did watch Silven's guide "fire cape for the runescape idiot" and combined it with what the wiki recommends. I did have the wiki up with the wave breakdowns so I knew when to expect the Prayer birds.

I logged in two accs to train att instead of other skills for an hour, didnt realice.

Hey guys,
---
I’ve been getting back into watching some Ironman series, and it’s motivating me to pick up where I started. I’d say I know a good amount of the game, my main is about 1900 total, but my Ironman is fairly new so i was looking for some advice on where to get started.
---
1: Is there any “must” do skills/quests when starting off?
---
2: What are some long, easy grinds I can do on my mobile while doing other things?
---
Thanks for the input. Add me! IGN:Agile btw
---
That's rough, all those hours gone.
---
I think the people spreading division in the community are the shitty PKers dropping N-bombs and telling people to "sit, f\*ggot" as they kill PvErs who are only there because Jagex had the genius idea of forcing people who have no interest in PvP to go into the wilderness against their will and classify that as "rejuvenation" instead of, y'know, improving PvP.
---
Oof.
---
[:(](https://i.imgur.com/0GFK9uB.png)

 I’m saying that it’s easier to to manipulate the concentrates with a dabber that’s not just a big stick. A cylinder makes a shitty scooping device. I mentioned it’s less aesthetic to have glass that way, it’s just more functional

Range gmaul pure is the best place to start, tons of guides out there for building them too. Pretty much cannon range to 70 (80 if you have the bank for it) then quest 50 attack, quest mith gloves and maybe train a couple of strength levels. Enjoy! You die a lot in the beginning but it gets easier!
---
You type ::displayfps to see your fps in game. If you have a remotely decent PC you shouldn't have problems in most places in game, but there are nasty perf bugs people have experienced in the past. The game is capped at 50fps, which can be a bit low if you're used to 75+ but it shouldn't really look choppy.
---
One solution is that you could try playing with a 3rd party client, such as runelite: 
---
https://runelite.net/
---
That may help with your performance. It has a GPU renderer (off by default), so if you have a decent GPU that may help. I've also heard reports that it just runs a bit better by default. If you're a new player you might want to turn off most of the features, while helpful they can be jarring and require tweaking.
---
While I totally agree that watching a hardcore played by someone so skilled with the balls to do dangerous content like this die to a disconnect is frustrating, the MAJORITY of the time it isn't necessarily due to server problems and rather their own connection issues.  This can fairly simply be fix by the player to give themselves a safeguard by making a secondary internet connection, the first thing that comes to mind is using your phone as a hotspot and since osrs uses so little data, it's really not that hard of a hit on the data plan.  Idk, maybe I'm talking out of my ass here, but it seems to me that if you have such a high leveled hardcore and you're doing such dangerous PvM, it would be worth it to look at all alternative avenues you can to ensure the most reliable possible internet connection.
---
Sucks tho.  F.
---
what does it look like when you're reposting?
---
t. weeb
---
Can we please stop with these posts about blindly voting no to PVP updates for god sakes?
---
You'd think with the demographic of OSRS being 20 something year olds that we'd know by now how to not be petty children.
---
Beg the mods to let us use them for rec exp
---
My thought process was along the lines of how ranger boots/tunic/gloves are BiS for pures and consistently retain value because of it. It's a niche reward space with high demand that avoids power creep by nature of being low-tier equipment overall. Pures get a new BiS item (with admittedly negligible benefit) that increases potential risk/reward in that bracket of PvP, and everyone else benefits from treasure trials having more rewards that are actually worth something.
---
I could be off the mark though, which is why I opened this as a discussion rather than just posting it as a suggestion. I'd like to get an idea of what sort of reward spaces people would like to see filled by potential new TT rewards.
---

I would like it if putting on your helmet automatically changes the appearance of your void gear.

e.g. put on melee helm, and your gear changes to look like that.

These are a yet to be polled shoe gear for pures, it would be cool to get a pair catered to mains aswell. (They are also considering glove variants)

Being restricted in a unique way, and being forced to do things differently. Most region locked or slayer only ironmen don't have access to a huge chunk of the game, which makes things interesting.
---
An ironman that can do both can probably access a majority of the game's content, but would have to get to most of it in a pretty roundabout way.

It's a good balance of having content available while still being a challenge.

I like the idea of tabs being exactly the way they are right now. Except anything you open on the left side always opens on the right side, or whichever side you choose.

I can't tell if this is bait. Osbuddy used to be a bot client the developer was employed by jagex because of his knowledge about botting.
