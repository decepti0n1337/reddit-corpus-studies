How much did you sell the ferocious gloves for?

---
---
at higher levels sure, it simply doesn't compare to other methods at lower levels at all. 3t fishing at 60 fishing is 4x the xp rate and half the clicking required. Just doesnt seem balanced. I honestly wouldn't mind the xp rates if the pearl rate was increased slightly. 5 in an hour just doesn't feel very rewarding for a few cosmetics. 
---
We out hear grinding for our iron and steel bars bröther 
---
&gt; You're saying it'll be a common drop because of excess herbs
---

---
No i'm not that's you applying your own meaning to my writings for nefarious purposes and I don't appreciate it. 
---
So many people do slayer that even though these drops are rare they are so OP they are still crashing the prices and making herb runs dead content. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! New content that kills other content on ARRIVAL? Ezscape fool, you don't care about game integrity and I won't stand for it. Meet me on the other side of the ditch with your entire bank. 
---
Yeeaah I'm pretty sure the wiki is right on this. The yield is noticeably bigger when I always forget to equip them and do it halfway through my farming run

I don't think naming 4 out of a couple dozen bosses supports that well, but it is used in a lot of places. Still, we have several high level and endgame places were T Bow and even Ranged isn't the to go or best choice. While it is nice when each combat style gets a place to shine, I don't think we need them to be exactly even. Like Magic is used in like 1/5th the bosses as Ranged and that is notable, but Melee and Ranged are both really good at a lot of bosses.
---
Also, if it wasn't the T Bow, chances are it would be the Blowpipe. And you remove both of that, it would probably swap back to being MeleeScape... Anyway, T Bow and Ranged didn't need another place where it is useful but I don't think it is a mistake to add more places where Ranged is good.
---
I love the fact I can finally do something like hellhounds and get something outside of hard clues for once, they just need to fix the quantities a bit on drops. 
---
Again, explain what you meant by those two statements I listed. Stop redirecting the conversation.
---
dang, no wonder my 2 ranarr weeds aren't selling, the market is crashing out from under me
---
Osrs players don’t give a shit, they want everything but reworks to existing content. 
---
It'd be sweet if we could get The World Wakes but no EoC or Treasure Hunter.  Jamflex pls
---
Very juicy
---
I'd asked in a jokey manner expecting a funny responce about maybe one of his friends being a duche, not getting blocked :/
---
I think every slayer boss hits partially through prayer, except Cerberus and idk about Thermy or Hydra
---
doesnt seem like its getting old anytime soon when osrs has 3-4x the playerbase of rs3 lol
---
Ash mentioned it'll be fixed next update. What I've heard the cause is, is disabling spell filtering. Try it with / without as if it is actually broken that bad it should probably be fixed sooner
---
Though this is free.

I literally laughed at this post thinking of Auston Powers poking the mole hahah
---
right? took a sick day on monday and worked on desert treasure, should have held off til today
---
It was in rs3 and I never got the drop getting 99 slayer, so it's probably pretty rare.
---
What? It has little to do with weapons. If a boss has a huge ranged defense and is weak to mage then you would use mage. How does that make mage bis for the whole game
---
People point to tob and say “oh look range isn’t bis there”. 
---
What... so we’ve had one piece of non range content (which btw still uses range a lot) and now we go back to blowpipey boi content where a 3-4m weapon can wreck every boss much harder than bis melee or Mage??
---
The point is that dragons and drakes and such have always traditionally been weak to stab - they even teased someone using a rapier at hydra so why on release are did they just chuck all that out the window and revert back to camping tbow or blowpipe from a distance. 
---
Imo having melee as the focus of tob made it far more interesting than chambers as you can’t just safespot, it actually requires attention because being up close to a boss is more dangerous. Just compare a room like bloat to Shamans, it’s way more engaging and fun. 
---
I just wish we could of had more niche combat mechanics for this boss as the diversity is badly needed in pvm, Mage in particular could have some really neat mechanics if jagex tried but once again another piece of content where it’s not even used and range is meta.
---
Rant over.
---
&gt; Tbh, I don’t care how rare that is it should be removed:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;—&gt; Jagex nerf birdhouses due to the hoe cheap brews became.
---
&gt;—&gt; Jagex turn around and give large drops of brews to Slayer content + 200 noted herbs like Toadflax too.
---
It sounds like you're thinking with your heart, and while that is admirable, it might not lead to the best results. 
---
As long as the drop rates are rare enough, it will be a unique, balanced kind of novelty drop. 
---
The fact that they nerfed birdhouses doesn't really matter in that regard and makes it seem like you're more personally affronted by that nerf, and thus not thinking with a clear mind. 
---
Because everyone is such a baby about “power creep” 
---
Shut up Serene
---
nice try, Jagex.
---
Thats quite the hot take friend
---
If that were true, then we'd never have any new drop tables. There are tons of drop tables with resources that don't crash the price. Alchs are a common thing on most drop table and a large part of the value of the current RDT. And You can't say that uniques would be worthless in a month when we've seen tons of value uniques. Even the RDT uniques were worth millions for years; they didn't lose value because they were too common but because they were replaced by better items. If there was something useful as a Mega Rare RDT drop or consumable it could easily hold a reasonable value.
---
Konar has a general “bosses” task, you should be able to do Vork for that, no?
---
I definitely agree
---
When RS3 comes out on mobile it will gain a huge surplus as well... if that’s still happening lol. Seams unlikely with how advanced the game is now. 
---
20 Torstols at 1/250 doesnt seem like much, but when theres thousands of people slaying at the same time the numbers add up.
---
They could've done that for this with each color/form being extremely tanky against two of the styles.
---
TBow is fine because of how absurdly expensive and rare it is.
---
Blowpipe is definitely too strong for how easy it is to get and it's not particularly expensive to maintain.
---
Getting a d spear at Zulrah feels rewarding. That's why. /s
---
Pretty sure its a max hit when overloaded at olm. Other than that they are just worse barrows gloves I think
---
Its a slayer boss. They are meant to be camped and killed hundreds of times and multiple times per trip. True tribrid boss would only leave a few spots for food and would be super click intensive making it not ideal for slayer
---
Because thered be no 'wow' factor.
---
u gotta tell us all what he said
---
PK’ers will often kill people doing clue scrolls , who often have spades in their inventory. 
---
Beats the point of Konars drop table and given the tasks she gives generally are lower XP per hour would be no use going to her unless you specifically want the new content. 
---
Apart from that the idea would be good.
---
Probably keeping it the same, but with bout 10x less for the herbs. This is suposed to be a nice surprise, 100-200k would be a nice surprise drop without destroying herb runs
---
&gt;You're just too busy with Abilities to bother with stuff like flicking now
---
Soulsplit flicking is still very much a thing
---
Because when everyone thinks this, that’s how you get “ezscape / rs3 / etc”
---
You shouldn’t look just at what’s good for *you* but also what’s good for the health of the game. This is unhealthy for the game
---
lmao apparently you've never been anywhere someone crashes. 
---
nice counterpoint
---
that ~1/10k drop rate on the torstols is economy shattering, you're right.
---
Drakes aren't especially weak to magic. You still splash a fair amount in ancestral with trident/sotd due to their magic level despite low magic defense.
---
Even casting flames of zamorak at the start of a kill to lower magic defense and using the new Brimstone ring which has a magic defense piercing passive, in addition to augury ofc, I was splashing at least every fifth attack.
---
Blowpipe is far more practical both in cost and effort. DHCB is probably BIS.
---
Now I feel dumb :(
---
They are in every way better than barrows gloves for melee....
---
I remember doing this on release day. Actually a fun little quest, and the weapons were amazing looking.
---
idk why you got so many downvotes but I appreciate your existence

---
Reddit is really over-hyping this.  You're not missing much.
---
I would rather not no need to spread his hate.
---
People babyrage if they aren't making money every kill.
---
Support, also make all the materials dropped by Slayer monsters in gigantic stacks
---
Hot take: I bet Jagex does this bullshit every update on purpose to get redditors to complain about OP drop tables, causing those who hear about it to rush to play the game before it gets patched out, thus making the release a "success" based on popularity. I can't comprehend that they would honestly think giving *200 noted herb drops* is good balance.
---
Maybe not 50/50 exactly, but I agree they should both be contributing. That said, it is probably 90/10 with the 90 being farming... Herb Runs bring in a ton of herbs compared to PvM and even a rare drop of 200 noted herbs likely won't sway that much. I mean it is not like every 50 kills players are getting 200 noted herbs; it seems to be one of the rare drops even if some got lucky with them. Still, I'd prefer it be a more common 20 herb drop or such or just less herbs in general since 200 does seem a bit much. But I don't think it is as damaging as the kneejerk reactions make it seem.
---
Their Defence is higher than their Magic so I figured that would probably have been close. Either way, Magic does seem like a good option and if it gets a Dragon Hunter weapon it would probably be undisputed best, but the existing Dragon Hunter weapons should rival it.
---

This is hydra boss right? I agree that's too many herbs but it's task only and only has 1 unique drop. We just don't have anything that really keeps its value unless its consumables or alchables.

It's the same thing.  You would see experiments and other stuff on pservs drop 10k/100k etc.  Very common.  You wouldnt see 100 dragon platelegs on any pserv really, because theyre not particularly useful.

You ever hear about this concept called real value? Btw you sound like a politician the way you’re spitting out buzzwords. Ahhh “skilling items from pvm” ahhhh “inflation” ahhhh “alchables”; I think you have absolutely no idea the *actual* effect any of these things have on the economy.  I’d really like if all of you people on this subreddit that *think* they know anything about economics to stop pretending they do. 
---
I find it funny that you deleted your previous comment and slapped this on here to seem less pretentious and more logical. Just wanted to throw that out there. Also, it makes absolutely no sense for a 2.5k brew drop, any of the 200x herb drops, or even the shark drop to exist with the previous statements Jagex has made. It has been explicitly stated that supplies and such should come from skilling content rather than from drops. 
---
How does it even affect the game?? People can click something slightly better, oh no! 
---
H
---
It’s never the drugs fault. Just the users.
---
&gt; "Let's see how long it takes you to get that drop again." "Judging by the crashing herb prices, not too long."
---
This was a sarcastic reply brimming with derision towards the person ignoring the crashing of herbs. Unfortunately you probably have autism and thus can't perceive this things. Mr. literal.
---
I have told you multiple times now that the title of this post is decrying the fact that herb runs are now dead content due to the OP drops of herbs from the new slayer drop table. Given that slayer is the most popular activity in this game even though herb drops are rare there is still too many coming into the game to make herb runs profitable or even break even. 
---
Carry on with the pedantry though and not the reality of herbs crashing.
---
In all honesty, all the other slayer bosses are melee and magic tasks kraken, cerb, thermo... this is the only decent one that's range oriented

For Herbs I am a bit questionable, but it can work if balanced right... But completed 4 dose brews? That should never be dropped on such a table, especially not in any bulk. That is the same as dropping 3.3K Toadflax and Crushed Nests, just without the Exp and mixing time. It would be like instead of 200 Torstol it was 150 Super Combats... It should drop the resource, not the completed product, and rarity doesn't change that.
---
Coins are a stackable item which come in bulk, it makes sense to have a stack of them. It is conceivable that a high level monster might carry a lot of gold.
---
It does not make sense for 100 dragon platelegs to randomly get dropped. 
---
How can you not see that lmao?

or 2 calquat seed and some 50 zulrah scale

Thank you! I will give that a go

After all these years on reddit you're the first person to ask and yes it does! Really a reference to Burger by Tyler. 
---
It's the new Konar drop table.

I guess people expected to Jagex to be able to make a good but not overpowered drop table. 
---
We should have known better after Zulrah.
---
Who cares lol. 
---
Reeeeeeeeetard. 
---
Imho melee should be the go to for most things. This is coming from someone with 99 magic an no other skill above 80 besides hp. Melee is accessible., has many items that have different damage types and outs the player in harms way. I dont think it should be opz just servicable. Magic should be the most versatile and generally more powerful due to cost and level requirements and range needs its gear weaker at the low end of the spectrum and slightly nerfed at the highest end. 
---
I am 2 hours, 3 tasks in. I've gotten 3 700k-1.2mil drops from the table, and 5 15k-40k drops from the table. This is like getting a clue scroll's worth of items every 50 kills without having to do the clue. 
---
Keep on telling yourself that's not broken levels of income from performing basic, no-risk, totally AFK slayer, but I know I'm making more money off this per hour than barrows runs with mory hard diary or mole runs at 1hp with dharok, the only PVM bossing stuff I've really done on this account.

If you don't think that devalues everyone's game, not just bots, I'm sorry but you're nuts. Also, who bots fucking farming?
---
&gt; Even if it was hidden until the end, you could just do your own poll to approximate results.

You really couldn't. The past 3 polls have had anywhere from 60k to 80k people voting. You're going to need a pretty big sample size, and that's assuming your sample is actually representative.
---
What say master? Is this for all slay masters?  Where were u killing FGs at?
---
I remember in real 07 when going dry at bosses meant DRY (losing money). That was the trade-off being a small chance of potenially getting a high value rare drop. 
---
The profit should come from the infrequent high value drops and the little drops should barely be worth picking up.
---

Not how it works at all. They only legally have to give you one hour of work a week.

Showing polls as is is a safety net against mob mentality, as it has been shown (on this sub no less) that players actual opinions of content are changed by seeing the results ahead of time.  Players start to like content for no reason other than it is popular and vice versa.  By seeing that the 75% threshold has been met players are likely to be cool with it.
---
Heard they already removed the brew drop
---
Where can I find the entire drop table?
---
But those herbs have come from skilling which has repeatedly been neglected with most PvM drop tables.
---
if you can put in 10 seconds of extra time to get a pixel thats keeping reddit busy though you did your job well though
---
It depends on the mcdonalds as some are overflowing with staff and some aren’t, a better example of this is Next as I got a 2 hour contract and only received 2 hours for about 3 straight weeks without many options to pick up shifts.
---
It’s too unreliable 
---
I'm referring to it being pserv-esque.  
---
It looks like a copy paste of the old RDT in RS3.
---
That has to be some insane luck... Perhaps the drop table is a bit too common and generous on top of that, but it can't all be normal.
---
Half of the bosses you listed don't even have TBow as the definitive best weapon, at best they'd be competitive for BiS as a more profitable option at the cost of kills/hr. Scythe is better at Cerberus and BP is better at Zulrah.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
big facts.
---
in RS3 you can have items appear over what you have equipped. Like with an Anger sword override, even if you were wielding a Dragon Longsword, it would appear as an anger sword.
---
We pay we melee
---
I sure as shit know a hell of a lot more than anybody crying about inflation, konars drop table, alchables, skilling drops from pvm, or any of the other bullshit buzzwords that get thrown around this subreddit. 
---
obor
---
If you add everything it seems to be still shit. The new dragon hasta is not OP at all, so it won't be really changing PvP spec weapons..
---
If you want to really evaluate konar, you have to dilute Hydra boss profits between all the time sink spent on the shit tasks that have to be done to get these hydra tasks (without the points saved from grinds months ago).
---
Or else dilute its gp/h with exactly these invested grinds in the previous months for points/skip tasks.
---
Then it's not that pretty.
---
This shouldn't gave been polled in the first place; game integrity issues aren't polled.
---
Vorkath is a case of DPS calcs not necessarily reflecting how good the items are. DHCB is worse DPS but because you're able to wear Dragonfire protection, you use far less supplies and have far longer trips (especially since you're no longer limited by BGS specs), resulting in DHCB netting more kills/hr and being BiS over BP despite being lower damage.
---
A similar situation could happen with DHL vs. DHCB as TBow vs. BP, where the DHCB would get more kills/hr but supply costs would make it less gp/hr.
---
So reskinning any knife or is the rune one different too
---
thanks
---
I mean it is not impossible because I managed to get one. But this kind of stuff is common day 1. It is unfortunate it happened for a lower tier diary, but within a day or two, it should die down as more players complete it.
---
I don’t think you understand my point as intended:
---
I don’t care that birdhouses were nerfed to their current level (I think it is in an okay position).
---
The problem is the reason birdhouse were nerfed is because of the price of Sara brews was considered too low for their liking. 
---
Then they turned their back on that idea and just said ‘screw it’ by putting Saradomin brews and noted toadflax in huge quantities (among other herbs) on Slayer drop tables no less. 
---
If they changed their mind about the pricing of brews they should have buffed birdhouses.
---
They should not have put it on a Slayer drop table if that was their intention (imo).
---
Either way, putting heavy drops like noted herbs like Torsol (up to 200) is way too much and nerfs the skilling aspects especially considering how much PvM drops skilling resources already.
---
Except the duel arena takes out hundreds of million out of the game every minute...
---
Most people just wanted rdt to be an additional drop instead of overwriting other drops iirca

How does someone use sarcasm in text? And how is that sarcastic? You replied but did not attempt to have it answer the question or even relate to it. This is what autistic people do. Someone asks question "a" and then the autistic person jumps to answer "b, c and d" even though that had no bearing on question "a". Redirecting need some work hombre. Of course I care about the herb issue but what does that have to do with question "a"?

"The bird nest drops have been removed from Vorkath and Zulrah. Callisto's bird nest drop has also been removed and replaced with 30 Dragon bones. This will reduce the number of nests coming into game while also contributing to our efforts to stop skilling resources being gained via PvM."

&gt;while also contributing to our efforts to stop skilling resources being gained via PvM
---
Then look at today's update.
---
Cir 
---
What jagex doesn't understand is that even if it's very rare, there are sooo many more players that do slayer and bossing compared to skilling or low-level bosses like mole etc. 
---
So even if it's an extremely rare drop, enough people will get it to the point where it affects the prices. 
---
You're right, I just checked the health and the message popped up in the chat box saying the contract was done. Thank you for your answer.
---
Then look at today's update. Jagex literally can't even keep their own statements in mind for 2 months.
---
The funny thing is this is actually true, they don't have drops stored in data filetypes it's literally hardcoded and someone wrote that code thinking it's a good idea. Oops.
---
Yea, you should really be abusing the extremely rare 7.5m drop, that will likely avg tens of hours of grinding to get if not more.
---
tourism... not gp/h due to uniques+hydra boss is the only incentive around this turd
---
Then make Skilling less afk and more rewarding...

Why would you ever need more brews on iron? I've used like none, and you get a shit ton of brews from herb runs+bird houses.
---
TBow has a damage cap, it's different depending on if you're in raid or out and about in the rest of the game. Zulrah even has a mechanic that caps that damage dealt to it. I'd imagine if they wanted to balance TBow, they could just change damage cap outside of raids or just add maximum damage taken to individual bosses.

Doesn’t help that they’re designing EVEN MORE content for the blowpipe every update.

---
That's just an opinion, the only thing that's guaranteed about Dragon Hunter weapons is that they're effective vs. Dragons, and the DHCB is pretty effective against Hydra. Nowhere is it guaranteed that a Dragon Hunter weapon would be the best weapon against all Dragons no matter what.
---
Especially true with the OSRS community. Give it a few weeks and it will be fine.
---
I had to watch it 3 times just make sure you didn’t die. That gave my anxiety as well, I wish I could glue the boots to my feet, I fear for the day that I get too baked and run back and forget

If I do the tasks in the achievement diary as F2P and convert to a member, do the tasks get counted as completed after converting? I've been trying to get F2P content done before getting membership.

Alright I'd like to take this opportunity to adopt your philosophy and let you know you're being an idiot.
---
I honestly thought that this is what Hydra was going to be. It has different heads so I thought you'd use melee/mage/range for each different head. But sadly it's just range for all.
---
I bet you correct people that Inferno Cape is BiS over Fire Cape. Technically correct, but not useful to most people.

They don't drop brews retard, don't mindlessly agree with Reddit

Except if you die to an npc your items stay for like 30 minutes or something. Just saw a guy die at barrows and he came back 10 minutes later and got all his stuff.
---
Yeah that’s pretty annoying and unfair

Looks like those Kunal from Naruto... But that you throw up your butt.

Awesome! thanks :)

I quite like killing metals. Haven't ever skipped a task of em, bolt spells and crossbows make life easy.

This is a troll, without a doubt.

I tried looking it pretty much shows like which quests to do

Not for melee anymore

&gt; The Hespori patch ..... The seeds for this plant can be randomly found while harvesting other plants (this can be toggled by talking to an NPC near the patch) or by completing Farming Contracts. 
---
&gt; The Anima patch ..... There are three types of seeds that can be planted here, which can only be obtained through fighting the Hespori and are untradeable. 
---
Everything else comes from the same place you get other seeds, nests and monster drops.

excellent contribution, super cheap and simple!

it’s unfortunate that you’re the first person to notice

to get it as a task you cant boost but to kill normal hydras you can boost just like abysal demons you cant boost to get task to kill sire i think

You’re getting proper worked up about some pixels bro

I felt like Dragon Slayer was written to combat this.

"Ugh, another so-called 'adventurer' *fine*, take an impossible task if you want my Rune Platemail, tardo."

Skip willow trees. Add in calquats and mahogany trees.

Can the OSRS team just add spells with cooldowns that does that, like Disruption Shield or Shield Dome?

More people kill hydra release than after a few weeks, so yes you see more. But im sure drop rate stays same. Got one myself aswel on 94kc :D
---
Oh I know. Its not even the beginning. Im currently starting on runecrafting. Sigh. 
---
Blowpipe has similar costs as a Tentacle whip does while being a whole lot better against most monsters.
---
haHAA yeah because inferno, zulrah, cox, tob, vork, and hydra are ALL great examples of bosses that stick to osrs' old click-and-wait combat system that everyone loved 1000%
---
This drop table is IN NO WAY broken, anybody who says so is just as bad as the pking brainlet that went into a tard rage about resizable icons. 
---
Forgot to censor your run energy, say goodbye to your account kiddo!
---
First of all, let it be known that I created a new account just to open this thread. I'm pretty well known around here and some of you may recognize who I am from the way I write, and that's fine. But I don't want any possible embarrassment this thread may cause me to carry on to my true identity on here, or affect the way others see me. 
---
So basically, what happened is I decided to tell my family and close friends that I'm into Anal Vore by having a "coming-out" party. 
---
I don't think it went very well, and that's why I'm here. 
---
Let me elaborate. I'm a male in my early 20's. If you were to ask me who I am, the 1st thing I would instantly say is "I am an anal vore fanatic.”  
---
It's who I am.  It's my identity.  Anal vore is my life, and it felt important enough for me to tell my friends and family. 
---
I decided the best way to tell them would be to have an anal vore "coming-out party,” though I didn't tell them that the party was going to be about anal vore ahead of time. 
---
I'm not stupid.  I knew they would look it up in Google and see a bunch of stupid things and criticisms by trolls about it, so I decided that to make the best impression of anal vore I would have to present it to them myself. I ordered pizzas, and planned a lot of fun activities we could do that would explain to my friends and family what anal vore is. 
---
It started when they came in through the door. I gave everyone a sealed envelope and told them not to open it until I said so. When everyone had arrived (grandparents, aunts and uncles, my parents, 3 of my cousins, and a couple non-family friends), I announced what the purpose of the part was and had them open the envelopes. I had commissioned a popular artist that I really like to draw sketches of each of my family members/friends anal voring me, and I printed these pictures out and put them in the envelope (he agreed to do the sketches for $5/each BTW so it wasn't too expensive for me). 
---
Everyone kinda laughed, and a couple of them were confused when I explained (my grandpa got kind of mad at me though). I basically explained to them that I'm into anal vore, and what it is. I don't think they took it very well though, because they joked a lot about it (they kept asking if I was serious or if I was joking). A couple people (my parents and grandparents mostly) seemed upset though, unfortunately. 
---
The next part of the party was I hooked up my laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable and I started showing them my favorite anal vore pictures on Ekas portal and other pictures that I had saved on my computer. This is where the party kind of took a turn for the worse. One of my uncles got really mad and started calling me names (I don't want to repeat them here) but my aunt defended me. We argued for a bit and most of my family left at that point...I kept showing them the anal vore pictures I liked on Ekas portal, but they started leaving and only my cousins and close friends chose to remain and look at the pictures with me. 
---
What did I do wrong?  Is this basically something that only younger people enjoy?  Because I'm pretty sure my grandparents hated anal vore (I still love them though, even if we can't see eye to eye on this subject that's extremely important to me). 
---
Anyways, the next part of the party that I had planned for so long and was expecting to be a bit hit was a kind of interactive anal-vore reading game. I had printed out one of my favorite anal vore stories from Eka's and I wanted to pass around the story and we would all read a part aloud, but that didn't really go as planned. One of my cousins said they thought it was "creepy"...?
---
I tried to convince her that it'd be cool, but no one wanted to do it.   I had to read the story myself, but when they started talking to each other about things NOT related to anal vore, I kind of gave up :( 
---
The party kind of fizzled out. We just watched TV for a bit, I kept talking about anal vore a bit (but not as much as I wanted) and after the party was over, everyone (the people who were left at the end, anyway) finally left. 
---
Did I do anything wrong? Should I try to do the party again, because I think they may have interpreted my interest wrong? 
---
It's really important for me and I want them to know, but how can I communicate my love of anal vore to my family members who are specifically picky about such issues &gt;.&gt; , such as my uncle who was intollerant of me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
---
It would make more intuitive sense if they actually require lvl 80-90 stats to wield. The lvl 75 bracket is already overloaded with gear.
---
They say that like we think that's the way the game should be played. They took their own words and turned it around on us to make it think that we wanted this. It's Jagex that wanted it this way since they nerfed bird nests.
---
But he called you an idiot, thus proving his claim
---
Elvargo, her Spanish cousin 
---
I noticed this today, why jagex why u do dis?!
---
Jagex starting early.. I like it 
---
Well it already does pretty well in my opinion
---
tbh I dont see why it couldnt just be a huge seed drop instead. Instead of dropping 100 ranar/snap/torstol or whatever why not drop 10 seeds. The PvM is still rewarding a huge drop in terms of cash but skillers can take those seeds and go do their skilling. The price of seeds and herbs drop a little due to the new influx of seeds but no one loses out along the supply chain.
---
That’s what a think too, better just sell em and change to a different method for cash
---
Sounds like you're planning on quitting the game. Can I have your stuff? 
---
not at all RS3 lmao did you even play pre eoc?
---
Stop trying to strawman. Skilling supplies from non-skilling activities. Potentially massive drops from almost any monster with only a 75 combat requirement. It's not obliterating the economy but it's still a dumb move overall. Slayer is already too popular, why make it even better?
---
But "dragonkin hunter crossbow" doesn't roll off the tongue as well.
---
i have been here, playing the game
---
this is very minor compared to what we have seen with previous events that made it to the calendar
---
or hopefully when he crashes it’ll be a minor rear ending and he’ll stop texting and driving? you guys are some serious artists on this subreddit
---
I love Zulrah and I don't complain about my experience with OSRS because it's simply for fun. Stop whining. 
---
Isn't he the guy who cheated during that one dmm thing?
---
That's not how averages work. The average intelligence of this subreddit is not by definition the same as the average intelligence of the people voting on the polls.
---
You can't complain that it's "literally done with a trident and a couple ice spells" when that is still much more than that range or melee equivalent would do. It's not like range uses different bolts/arrows that much. If you're literally referring to actual engagement with the attack style twisted bow is stupidly afk. 
---
S
---
In what world did they think "Hmmm lets give 2500 brews as a rare drop" was ok? 
---
I'd be interested to look at the formula of how this drop happens, how likely it is, and why it wasn't QA tested to the the extremes so drops weren't overpowered.
---
its why i use shift+windows+1-0 
---
look let’s just pretend this does not need a buff so 99 herblore doesn’t cost me my entire bank lol
---
Why though? How many OSRS players quit the game over the blowpipe, scythe, or tbow? Pvming can and will adapt with t80 gear. This isn't EoC.
---
Its not a change thats objectively better. The community has voted against it.
---
Give up friendo. 
---
HEY I ALSO DID THAT QUEST AND SAW THAT REFERENCE WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
---
I had brews at like 70ish combat lol, I just like skilling more than combat, and you can get brews on a lv 3 ironman if you want.
---
You're right 
---
Market crash sell sell sell
---
Glacors pre eoc were a really fun mage only boss back pre eoc. even just some monsters weak to a particular element similarly would be fun. 
---
Why do OSRS players hate reworks but love new content? This is the exact opposite of RS3 players.
---
Dude im looking up how to kill metal dragons as an ironman with shit herblore. Fuck me
---
Mate if u want pvm go visit nightmare zone and don't leave before you a 99 art,def,are. It's not that hard
---
That works too. If you convert some more powerful abilities to spells though, they'd have to be restricted in some way, like just being usable in certain boss fights
---
Fix it and roll back a day
---
Good
---
There's already an off task area that's actually more efficient than the Slayer only spot.. Canyon. Only downside is it's multicombat so Ironmen get buttfucked.
---
lol i would too but who is going to do all that? ive taught raids 1 for a year. they couldve came at anytime. i even have a raids guide

This is fucking terrible holy shit, why?
---
It failed twice. Clearly not enough of the community wants it. Get over it.
---
whats wrong with having metal dragons extended?
---
I also did not get it as a drop 
---
That didn't make the community happy when 100 dragon platelegs noted was a drop.
---
Rarity is irrelevant. Some thing should not be dropped. 2.5k noted brews is one of those.
---
They literally said it was to celebrate Pride Month 2017 in the news post. You're just being dense. 
---
If you want to fight the Hydra boss you'll it as a slayer task. The only person that gives it as a task is Konar. Seems fairly common.
---
Fight itself is pretty easy but has a lot going on and Hydra can deal a shit ton of damage quickly. May take a couple tries to get it but once you do it shouldn't give you any trouble. Range is best against it. If you can afford a Tbow, use that. If not, blowpipe works well. Make sure you use boots of stone, brimstone boots (Best for range), or granite boots (Best for melee) or you'll take a lot of damage in the dungeon.
---
Farming guild has 3 different requirements for each area. I think they're 41, 61, and 81? I haven't checked it out yet so can't say much about it.
---
Check out the Kourend Achievement Diaries. They have some decent rewards and a lot of it is fairly easy.

10m up from nothing ? Also requires like 30 more quest points.  The graphics are good and I wish they would go back update older models like bloodvelds.  I would like the monarch drop table to not be a thing though. 
---
Is there a catch with the new slayer master? It just seems like better drops, more points and lower requirements.
---
Someone delivered my friend
---
Just make them give no xp, that's how it works in rs3
---
Y’all speakin French 
---
I was so confused why i kept ending up in miscellania when i intended to go to the GE lmao, i didnt realize farming guild was added haha!
---
It completely makes the point of having a magic spellbook useless for PvM when actually using the spellbook outside of blood spells to heal is used 1% of the time with the other 99% of the time being Trident weapons. There’s a lot of potential with mage because it actually has utility and can have unique mechanics with it but it’s never looked at and used for new content.
---
"I'm retarded?" [ looks in mirror ]
---
I like this suggestion, have had the exact same thought myself!
---
Happens to often.
---
don’t scape and drive, brainlets
---
It's consistent 3-3.5m/hr with near-max stats/gear as well as giving BiS drops. It suffers from the same problem as Zulrah and Vork; if you're going to give out awesome uniques, don't also make the boss consistently profitable.
---
O 
---
Vote no if you actually don’t want warding. Letting their tactics influence your decision is just as dumb
---
10m up from nothing for the new bis gloves? Also they requires like 30 more quest points.  The graphics are good and I wish they would go back and update older models like bloodvelds.  I would like the konar drop table to not be eradicated though.
---
Legend has it, there is a spirit of imbalanced drop tables that goes from update to update, messing with the balance. They can catch it and shoo it away, but it will just wait to latch on to something new...
---
Welcome to RuneScape, enjoy
---
Just another easyscape update, great. 
---
And do you realize that it's possible to grow trees without payment?
---
And that with ultracompost the chance of trees dying is incredibly small. 
---
15M to guarantee the survival of a 300k seed? Or just to save a the hassle of casting a few geomancy spell?
---
At a place like this with constant new content being added, there's no time for tech debt to be removed.
---
I'm not going to lie, this drop table appeals to me. It's literally made me go from loathing doing Fire Giant, Hellhound, and Bloodveld tasks to actually enjoying them since there's always the potential of a random 100k+ gp drop. It's what the rare drop table *should've* been like from the beginning. It doesn't even happen all that often either. Maybe once or twice per task, and it can vary greatly from a simple 25k boost (5k elemental runes) to 250k in bolts/sharks, with the extremely rare chance of more gp in bigger drops. It makes me not feel bad for not slaying at 100% efficiency with bracelets, skipping any task that can't be bursted/cannoned, etc.
---
You get seeds randomly through farming. I got one checking the health of a papaya
---
Pretty much 
---
Where do you guys get this info? I cant even find what new weapons/monsters were released
---
Sigh. Using them both correctly means confusing them I guess. Yikes friend.
---
Yeah it's retarded how you can deal more DPS with ranged than melee, even if you can just stand still and have 0 downtime on meleeing. 
---
If you're willing to risk killing someone else's children, you don't deserve to have your own
---
Thanks bud
---
Definitely agreed, as someone who enjoyed when skilling was by far the best way to *consistently* profit and PvM and bossing were great for a chance at a huge, valuable drop with mediocre drops in between to cover the costs of supplies. 
---
 
---
I remember loving that I could virtually use my pure as a main not only for pking, but also making money with 99 mining/hunting etc. Nowadays if you don't enjoy bossing and slayer you're playing "inefficient-scape".
---
Don't get me wrong, PvM has its place, but I really only appreciate PvM that is actually difficult like the inferno.
---
Alchemical hydra is a joke for example.
---
Don’t be such a sook 
---
Konar has a global drop table. If you get a task from her you get the chance to roll this table on tasks. 
---
It bothers me how that poll is exactly a 2/3. 1/3 split
---
For the life of me I can't figure out where to unlock the "A Walk In The Woods" soundtrack to get my music cape back.. I feel like I've ran around everywhere.  Any help?
---
Yes. Using both correctly means not understanding them. Lol.
---
The 2.5k brew drop was removed soon after the update.

It's long, but there is a lot of content so it's well worth the read. 
---
The wiki has a lot of the stuff already up too, like that particular piece of information: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Redwood_tree_seed

I'm sure you could have been invaluable as a java systems engineer in 2001.
---
Unfortunately you're about 18 years too late :(

T
---
That’s honestly a great idea. 
---
That is when you outsource your whole game to Eastern MMO-mill company.
---
I think I died like 4 times before fully getting the hang of it. Died once before my first kill. It’s not too bad, just really make sure to count the attacks out and know what tiles to stand on and you’ll be fine. 
---
It especially helps to know how to run the fire from the corner, but I’m sure there’s a VOD somewhere of Woox doing it. 
---
Not at every slayer master in every world. 
---
What if it doesn’t 
---
Lol 
---
The level requirement is literally irrelevant
---
Dropping these items is similar to dropping gp since they replace items that would otherwise be created via a gp sink and dropping gp (or alchables) contributes to inflation.
---
It doesn’t say anywhere he isn’t. 
---
That’s horse shit and not true. 
---
If they didn’t deal with tech debt, interfaces wouldn’t get updates. They would release and never update or patch or take a second look. 
---
They do plenty of that, you are simply not aware of it. 
---
If you’re an It company that doesn’t deal with any tech debt at all, you won’t make it. It’s incredibly important to remove badly written or understood code and replace it with the version that not only works but works better. 
---
Except intelligence has normal distribution and a sample size as big as this sub is probably representative of the entire population. You can’t have an IQ or 400. Intelligence isn’t the same as salary for example where a person making 10bil a year raises the average of the entire world population dramatically.
---
like the idea but infernal eels are locked behind fcape, this would take that requirement away. just something to consider i guess
---
Nice
---
They just feel a little out of place on a universal droptable is all I’m sayin
---
Thats what you get with overpowerd shit like bp and tb. 
---
If you think this is dumb, just wait until you do the artefact task for the hard diary. I swear it’s impossible. Guess I’m never getting this diary done. 
---
Is it worth using the new slayer master rather than Duradel? I'm 200k xp away from 95 and the global drop table looks pretty good, same with task weights. 
---
No, the specific locations can be a big inconvience 
---
it restricts the option to do faster cannoning/barraging tasks. It also restricts the option to to boss tasks options as well. 
---
Good imo. The price of dhcb needs to chill. Its BiS for enough things.
---
Found the trash and salty ironman.
---
200k people in this sub and 20k votes on the poll is a representative sample.
---
Given that the first drop tables were probably written about when JSON was first created, not using it is pretty understandable.
---
I've read that but doesnt say anything about release of gloves, dragon knifes etc. Where do I find that info
---
so getting a spider task and killing venenatis for red spider eggs and snapdragons. same thing, right?
---
Still better attack bonus on top of the str bonus. 
---
i play iron specifically to avoid "pvm-for-money-then-grind-skills"
---
i dont want resource drops either
---
Yes money making for combat has gone up and so has skilling. But more clicking intense methods should always profit more than sitting afk at a tree
---
I made 2.6m from 300 Drakes. I actually got 2 Gargoyle tasks and made 1.75m from 291 gargs WITH 2 Konar drops(293k). 
---
Drake drop table is fine
---
I really should start doing that.
---
My worst fear culminates in a picture
---
Ok dude
---
lol you probably just don't remember training 40 levels
---
Just delete every single skill except for the combat skills and slayer. Make every monster only killable on task. There's the slayerscape that idiot wants.
---
I thought you could already do this by right-click using a spade on the patch?
---
Have to spend 30 more seconds travelling to task location = chance at extremely broken loot
---
Seems like a good trade to me 
---
I was just arguing semantics essentially, that's all.
---
Thank you! 
---
Thought it had a magic def ignore effect as well?
---
If you ask for an easier contract he will give you a medium contract, I get about 100k on average from the hard contracts, only done 1 medium one and got 75k 
---
They really aren’t that good. They don’t really offer a large stat boost offensively and you sacrifice defensive and prayer bonuses to use them.  The gloves also are only useful for melee so in hybrid situations like raids or dks they’re pretty trash. Also, the content that each come from is miles apart in difficulty. Hydra is a solo slayer boss.  TOB requires 3-5 skilled pvmers and teamwork. 
---
F
---
Ah, didn't realize you could get a different contract. Also didn't realize how long hespori took to grow 
---
\&gt;Not wearing BIS str helm
---
Aren't they only bis for melee, and barely better than barrows gloves? Avernic is quite a step up from dragon defender. Also the hilt is probably more uncommon of a drop I'd imagine?
---
Nope. Never needed customer support. Learn to figure thing out for yourself instead of expecting someone else to do it.
---
why risk a 108 hour tree dying though lmfao pretty sure most people will only use the fruits for the trees.
---
1
---
They can't do that on 07.
---
But, it works like that on RS3.
---
Yeah see, there's no real learners gap for the gorilla's or vork. I've died to vork twice post quest in 300 kc, and I've died four times to gorilla's in 1600 because I risked it for the biscuit
---
Yes it’s true Woox said on stream that he likes the boss but one thing he was disappointed with was that you can do kills without taking any damage if you do it perfectly. 
---
Same goes for Tzhaar city? It's a fantasy RPG man.. Just chill out lol
---
Close
---
Selling gold ore is more money than the bars. If you want to use the coal, use the blast furnace to make steel. Steel is commonly bought for cannon balls.
---
Game over man, game over.
---
Yeah cuz fuck that shit! We can all do it, but some of us contract HIV in as little as 4-10 ticks. 
---
Like I said, I've seen that stuff before and can't be bothered to go watch it again even if I could follow what was going on. But all the examples anyone can give is "go watch this; it requires more skill" without ever saying why it requires more skill. And it also kinda seems to miss my point of why I say it doesn't have a larger range of skills, just a larger range of buttons.

At least 3, that's the base amount you get from 1 seed then you start 'rolling' a dice to lose lives. We don't know the exact rate for Celastrus but the following is for Herbs etc, and it works in the same way.
---
&gt; Herbs, like allotments and hops, work as follows:
---
&gt; You start with 3 lives. Each time you get an item, you roll the dice. If you rolled unsuccessfully, you lose a life. When you've lost all 3 lives, the patch becomes empty. So if you roll unsuccessfully every time, you'd still get 3 items. In theory, if you rolled successfully every time, you'd get an infinite number of items. Your Farming level will affect the likeliness of succeeding each time the dice rolls.
---
&gt; If you use compost, you start with 4 lives instead. If you use supercompost, you start with 5 lives instead. Secateurs make you more likely to roll successfully, so you're statistically more likely to get more items, but not guaranteed.

Cop a rune cbow and safespot em or flick melee prayer . Either or is efficient

I’m sorry I didn’t see anything mentioned about a drop table. Idgaf about a drop table 
---
Twisted bow is rising with 10s of million a day
---
Fuck yeah my 99 ~~Wintertodt~~ Cancer agrees. 
---
hahahah and people actually believe this game isn't turning into rs3. give me the 2015 osrs community back not this cesspool of retarded ironmen who continued to play eoc for 6 years after it was dead
---
you are using brews and restores as your main food at zammy and demonics?
---
Also, if you're able to farm zammy but are 65 herb then you really fucked up
---
But how did it happen in the first place? That's some real galaxy brain shit right there. The near immediate removal is a clear indication that they acknowledge that it was a misstep, but the question remains...
---
How did this happen? 
---
This post is so low effort you couldn’t even put it on the calendar. 
---
How the fuck does anyone think that's a good idea? Same with the herbs. Why are they inflating drops so fucking hard.
---
You have to be an absolute dumbass to think this was a good idea. Doesn't matter how rare they are really, that's a fucking stupid drop. Even 100+ herbs is stupid. Seriously who tested this and went "yep, good." 
---
Awful.
---
I wouldn’t listen to some random dude in a cc, wiki says it goes to 193
---
At least Blues are really good profit
---
How do you guys keep getting 1 kc hydra pet 
---
This task I currently have would get me 44 slayer. There is about a \~30-40% chance with Konar to be assigned a task off of Zeah. Asides from doing tasks from her, my only other current method to train slayer is by lamping. So yes, the options I gave were a bit selfish, however I believe removing the requirements on the boots is solid option considering it's not a huge advantage to anyone. Also they aren't even listed in the gear requirements in the slayer skill guide.
---
You guys are both assholes
---
Thanks bro helped a lot!
---
We just got tob which has 1.33 tbow bosses though. Really everywhere tbow is bis theres a clear 2nd best right behind it, except for sara and inferno. Tbows massively more expensive and only marginally better in most places.
---
&gt;70 agility
---
Training agility makes me want kill myself. Training is not only incredibly slow, it’s probably the most boring skills to train in the game.
---
Look at the skill level required to complete the content they come from.  
---
I loled 
---
50 range is more efficient than meleeing with 70 base?
---
If you're new one can always safespot them.
---
Yeah but graceful and the QOL changes that come with agility is worth it.   I’m currently grinding graceful/70 agility 
---
Uhh, what the fuck did you just stay lol? You said melee is so over powered then u said it’s not. Game is balanced btw. Melee is for koing people, ranged is dps. Mage is for freezing. It’s kinda simple
---
Most brainlet comment in this thread.
---
Saw a guy named fhgit or something very close
---
It depends if you wanna sit there almost true afk and idk train that range up on some relatively weak monsters or divert all your attention to prayerflicking melee
---
wow 1600 total and 200 qp insane reqs bro damn 
---
How long will the boss take to grow?
---
What are you even talking about.  There is no possible way to ever lose money farming any seed other than Ranarr/Snapdragon/Torstols. Torstols are mainly for experience but you can still usually turn a profit off of them.  And you would have to average a little less than 6 herbs a patch to break even on Ranarrs/Snaps but you usually get a lot more.
---
At 99 Farming I average 65 herbs a run at worst and break 85+ often.  You have to be doing something seriously wrong to never make a profit doing herb runs.
---
I got to 50 agility and decided it wasn’t worth my life to continue
---
Classic scam. The other day I saw a level 7 saying "Buying rapier 380m tbow 1180m" and I just knew that's what he was up to. I would've offered him one of the items to see if he throws up a camelot tele or something but, ya know, I don't have such expensive items lying around 
---
They came as single unid drops, not 200 noted torstols...
---
ok but in 15 hours I saw literally 1 screenshot and it only came out like what, 9 or 10 hours in? This was not a common drop at all.
---
I think he meant that the idea of melee being overpowered is asinine
---
Well I used karambwan and sharks, but brews would be hella better.
---
Same with demonics, makes trips super long and afk w runelite.
---
Aaand, you can look through my post history but I farmed zammy for hasta at 77 slayer and 100ish combat. You can do it if you aren't bad, my herb was just past the point of super defenses so more like 66/67 which is perfectly reasonable for 77 slay imo.
---
Yes Saturday 4pmcst
---
I don't think it's a matter of "Blowpipe is good against everything" and more a matter of monsters not having weaknesses anymore.
---
The accuracy bonus for the item shouldn't feel like "Now you can kill this already easy-to-kill boss even FASTER!" and more like "He is resistant to range attack but if you have the DHCB you can use range".
---
slayer bosses with an equivalent lesser slayer counterpart. like he'll hounds and cerberus, kraken, thermonuclear dust devil, alchemical hydra, grotesque guardians, and whatever else I'm forgetting
---
2 more with scythe on olm with ovl+
---
Dds has increased damage Abby dagger has decreased. 
---
If you're taking pure efficiency then probably. I feel like bursting kalphites is a waste of money though 
---
Jokes on you I never remember what key to press anyway!
---
Dairy reward is pretty strong already imo
---
I shared a picture of the offense in my post, and there is no evidence besides check your messages on account page which that message is just them telling me I am permanently muted because I continued offend
---
The people here make it sound like you get a 1m drop every single task. I've done like 20 tasks with konar, Out of those thoudands of slayer kills, I've gotten maybe 5 supply drops total that were worth more than 100k. with the highest being ~250k.
---
For every person getting a 1m supply drop, there are 10 more getting a 5k rune drop or something like that. 
---
It's new content and everyone is doing it right now, so of course there are going to be tons of drops like this entering the game today. The rate of these drops entering will start to die down once people realize konar slayer isn't good for anything but hoping for that lucky drop. Sure the Brew thing was bad, but that was removed before the uproar even started.
---
That's always a possibility. I just wonder if there have been any scientific studies on polling systems where the people answering the poll agreed for open numbers 
---
So does a ring of wealth effect the crazy resource drops with Konar?
---
Then just use the same workaround they did with jad..
---
What if something morr dramatic happens before jan is over? Youre too early bud
---
The example was just a proof of concept and was in no way meant to be real, so I'm not sure what point you're making there. Also, a larger sample size does not in any way guarantee an even spread, although it does make it much more likely. You could very easily have a group of people heavily weighing on either end shifting the results.
---
Moving GE teleport from K to J has really messed me up. Its making me want to make a Varrock portal for an easy ge tp.

You may struggle to get upvotes needed to make front page. If that's it I'd suggest trying Twitter or reposting on here to try and get desired results.
---
He misspelt spice leave him alone
---
As someone who's thought about playing is, the more and more it looks like both ga,esmare just converging to combatscape with different combat systems, wish I got to keep my max melle pre eco in OS, but I'm too lazy to rebuild and don't want to grind the stats for PM again
---
Just don't get discouraged. It was hard for everyone at first and even the best players died a few times (i certainly did). But you'll get the hang of it! :D have fun and good luck with drops.
---
6-1 Atleast red chins, pretty sure it’ll get hotfixed though so 6 is PoH
---
Wtf happened to the drop tables? It’s konar tasks only that do this right? So if you do a black demon task with duradel the table is different that when assigned by konar? I’m just confused by this mess. 
---
Turn off gpu on runelite
---
Ibans staff is a good place to start. All the brothers except ahrims have a low magic defence. I usually skip ahrims because it feels like i waste too many resources ranging him at 69.
---
There are some good beginner guides on YouTube. I use roughly 10k in resources per trip.
---
You should just not say something is efficient when you mean almost the opposite 
---
Hardly drama. Just a guy trying to farm reddit karma. 
---
What kinda deadend job allows him to grind runescape at work all day?
---
Would it be possible to make OSRS bosses harder than Inferno but still doable for pvmers that are not Woox, considering how unwilling OSRS players are at voting in t80+ gear, Summoning, or Invention?
---
Cool story bro
---
Yeah it's rng. I just started my first task (dust devils in the catacombs :O) and got 149 yew logs, 405 iron ore, and 98 teak planks in like half an hour (about 150 kills).
---
Poison them with a dagger pray up and stab them with the best stabby well you got. 1-2 kills per 43 prayer 
---
O look dead fishing content 
---
Fuck Cancer, buddy. Gratz on the accomplishment and hope to see you online sometime! 
---
you mean blame the people who are right
---
2 bad
---
And I was one of those retards that bought it for 19m....and I still have it
---
Hell yeah baby!  Keep up the work, account looks great.  Grats on the 99 too! 
---
Is this a new pasta
---
Not true. They used a workaround for jad where he plays a preliminary animation before he attacks that corresponds with the projectile (the "true" attack animation) which determines damage when it appears. No other monster does this, all other monsters just have one animation where damage is calculated on the very first tick, regardless of when the physical "projectile" comes out.

rs3 has two new barrows brothers; Akrise the Damned, a male prayer centric guy, and Linza the Disgraced, who has a 1/8 chance to reflect damage ala zenyte ring
---
not really sure what you're getting at, guy
---
99 Slayer but you're quitting? I highly doubtful that. Do you know the drop rates of said items? For all you know it could be 1 in 30k.
---
Says the level 1 slayer account?
---
I thought this was a spics and specs reference 
---
Thank you.
---
Ah, the fabled leed rune
---
Gunshot wounds you say? Next time put the gun to your temple instead of under your chin.
---
I got 6 with mine
---
Is that 80k slayer xp/hour...?
---
Sure hope i do, only boss I've really ever done is bandos. Yes that is embarrassing and my chances of success at Hydra might be low but this one i definitely want to try out and get the hang of. Maybe even share in the glorious feeling that is receiving these bomb drops! Thx for the kind words and hope you feel better soon too bro.
---
Is your email secured with 2fa?
---
Kill the hydra and hush honestly, the drops will be nerfed it’s very obvious heaven forbid some of us low level plebs get some good drops to help us pay to gat our skills up 
---
Way to go bro!!!!
---
my entire clan have been slaying since the release. Each of them have earned over 1.5m per hour. 6 of them have gotten dragon harpoons. This almost beats zulrah and revs. 
---
Tumblr porn section gets shut down and suddenly reddit 07scape is filled with erotica artists.
---
what a mere coincidence I do say
---
Would increasing the drop rate on just blowpipe make sense or is what I said totally retarded
---
I've seen someone use it there but others including me outdamaged it a lot with BP. Their def is still fucking mental to both though &amp; the drops definitely do not make up for resources used. 
---
Yeah, you shouldnt be making any good gp per hour in a skill that you have not spent hundreds of hours training. What does my 99 slayer mean if you, with 5 slayer, can make the same ammount of gold as me?
---
That's funny because my clans been slaying all day and only a couple have actually rolled decent drops from konars tasks.
---
in a group as large as this you're going to have to find some pretty compelling evidence for why you think iq would trend either significantly higher or lower its not like your sampling doctors or lawyers or something here where theres a reason for an iq shift its a damn leisure activity, its in no way stupid to assume for conversational purposes that the distribution of runescape players would be roughly the same as a greater population.
---
Delete yourself from earth kid 
---
Runescape isn't made for mechanics it was meant to be a basic click and kill game. GDW was the most intense thing on release! Now it's a face roll
---
Is this a pasta?
---
Why would they want to increase the price of sara brews? Wouldn’t removing bird nests off drop tables make it harder for ironmen to get brews as well?
---
It really is a magic dominated meta though. Thanks to 4taa and vulnerability. It seems like that unless it's bad to use mage at a boss (araxxi because melee form araxxor is a pain to deal with) then mage is best at the boss. 
---
Honestly, even though it's not afk I'm still gonna use this because I absolutely despise Hunter and this will be the only way I could train it without wanting to alch myself.
---
The incentive was most pts per task....
---
I disagree
---
We can take a 20% decrease in new content to put that time towards engine work and cleaning up the codebase. It might even pass a poll.
---
Harvest everything first
---
Added to collection log at least. Always gotta look at the positives 
---
Did you get muted for scamming? 
---
This is why I chose to play an ironman it makes you do things you wouldn't normally do.
---
Yikes
---
I'm assuming this includes previous tasks which were probably a lot higher in xp/hr. You're right that 80k doesn't seem right for hydras alone.
---
should have done them before the update
---
More like H
---
Lowest ever is 13gp with just firecrackers
---
Thank you mang, time to grind for elites I guess
---
yes nigga and he fucking said he wanted updates
---
One is old seed nest, one is new seed nest. 
---
NIGGA IT'S BIS L000000000L
---
Well yeah, the update was today. Of course these places would be packed with people.
---
Is this a new update as of the last \~3 days?
---
Duel arena, money is never impressive as long as it exists
---
Honestly don't see a problem with it. We have item drops that are just as rare for 10m+, enough to buy a ton of brews. No difference really, just some drop to get excited about
---
Jmods are still asleep 
---
Even mods cannot individually give items out. They can do server rollbacks for emergency bugs that happen, but that's it. 
---
This has really gotten off topic from my original point and I feel like we're either misunderstanding each other and/or just not going to agree on this. My original comment was replying to someone who claimed that EoC added a "lifetime of possibilities to bossing mechanics" and claimed OSRS combat was limited to just Prayer Flicking and Movement. I see that kind of sentiment a ton and it is is kinda wrong. EoC was not needed and a lot of what it brought could have been done in other ways and even done better in other ways. Going "RS3 has abilities to stun and stun break so it makes its combat better" is silly because OSRS can do the same sorts of things without abilities.
---
Everytime OSRS gets some endgame PvM, I constantly see RS3 players talking shit about how OSRS has hit its limit and this is why EoC was needed... Then later we get another update that pushes OSRS mechanics even further and they find a new reason to complain about how limited OSRS is and glorify EoC. EoC was a bad system that got better over time, but the things it does isn't unique. You don't need abilities to have those interactions and mechanics; that is just one way to go about them. I've gotten dozen of comments saying "oh RS3 combat is so much more skill, go watch this" but no one can ever explain why. Just because it has more variations and is harder to understand doesn't mean it requires more skill to execute or make it a better experience.
---
I got 4 from the konar drop table
---
The consistency of drama that we keep up with month to month is amazing 
---
I don’t really understand the argument against this. How is clicking a potion every few minutes any different then changing radio stations or adjusting the volume on a radio? Do those things deserve equal hate?
---
That’s one way to make it instant dead content
---
Its a very nice looking place. I wish the farming cape tele put you by the bank/fountain/spirit tree patch. I love that are. I know why it doesn't though.
---
Still my new favorite place to use the bank/bank skill etc now though. 
---
Yep, same. Ended up selling mine for about 2.6m right after I got the drop, still more than I was expecting it to sell for to be honest.
---
Aww man still have yet to get any of her drops they will probably nerf it before I get any knowing my luck lmfao 
---
I actually don't get how they can consistently do stuff like this.
---
Yes ironmen are a very small minority there's no reason to listen to them. The game doesn't need to be tailored around there shitty obscure game mode.
---
Wholesome post. :) As a noob that started a month ago and definitely feel OPs pain with small bank problems the kindness is refreshing and an awesome part of the RS community. 
---
how do you function day to day? like do you have trouble brushing your teeth or what?
---
Hops are surprisingly profitable as well , they're not dead content. I remember gentletractor submitted new brewing methods when he came up with the farming guild too. Zeah could use it's own special brew like other places in rs.
---
Rarity is a fair argument to make, but that's exactly why I think their immediate reversal is a key piece in this puzzle. They didn't spend any time explaining why they made that decision, they removed it from the table instead. If there was a good reason, you'd think they'd at least mention it. And it's not hard to expect the community to react as it did, either. All facts indicate that they didn't think very hard about this.
---
See you in 2 weeks
---
Ruins ironman mode when they get the 2.5k drop, ruins the brew market if 100 people out of 10,000 people get the drop that's 250k new brews in the game literally from a drop..
---
The offence say: Manual Permanent Mute
---
Is it not normal to have two? I have two. I thought everyone had two.
---
Recent as the last 18hrs even. 
---
Yep that’s how I got muted... there should be a little message in your inbox, I got muted for scamming... I’m guessing the same for you ?
---
Agility is my favorite skill to train now. It's almost relaxing. I have a hard time turning my mind off sorta before bed but Agility actually helps a lot.
---
I just want antifires on my ironman and it’s fucking an eternal struggle
---
50 attack 55 str 50hp and 70 range 13 prayer 
---
So, you just are lazy and don't want to actually have to do anything in fights.
---
I visited places I haven't touched in years because of Konar's tasks and the chance at hitting her drop table. The drops are maybe a bit too frequent but they definitely invite players to go explore other places around gielinor instead of just going with the meta. 
---
What set up and inventory are you using to kill wyrms? Gz btw
---
Gotta fund the new slayer drop table somehow
---
I'm glad it's not *just* players on reddit who are upset this time. 
---
It's scary how some jmods genuinely think these drop tables are OK. Like why does slayer content have to be so stupidly OP on release all the time? 
---
Everyone downvoting the other guy but this is just completely nonsensical in terms of code. The game generates your nest ID from your mole skin? What?
---
The day will come soon my friend ☠️☠️☠️
---
That would be a hell of a flip if you got archers for 70k
---
Sorry for being such a noob (started the game about a month ago), but how do I configure a “Valuable drop: “ message to show up?
---
Lying to myself how? I was selling rune pouches for 1m, and players probably are clueless that you can buy a rune pouch. Are you trolling me or something.
---
he said those 3 were the only below 100k
---
Public beta for Kebos looking bad.
---
144 with just the g maul is theoretically possible 
---
Literally every new monster, including demonic gorillas which have their own unique attacks and mechanics already.  They usually don't even do it in an interesting way, you can just spam click anywhere else to dodge the attack. Instead of it mattering where or what you click. 
---
I hate that I understand this 
---
No I’m being damn honest boy. You were scamming and you know it, they won’t unmute you... even if it was not a mutable offense they can mute you and keep it that way 
---
Yeah boiiiiiiiii
---
Have you ever heard of Zulrah?
---
? there is no boss that drops a full max gear set 
---
If you support these heretical ideals, you belong in Rs3 not OSRS.  Who's side do you really choose?
---
Probably, i have it atleast
---
There's an incinerator that you can toggle for items like that.
---
You can incinerate stacks of items in your bank, hit the wrench at the top right to enable
---
&gt; There's nothing wrong dodging an attack and not clicking and waiting the whole time.
---
Does not belong in pre-eoc combat. End of story.
---
I second that. Gorillas are good money and pretty fun if you're actually in the mood to sweat profusely and pay more attention than you probably will anywhere else in the game besides CoZ/ToB
---
Someone that wanted drops to not be shit, I guess.
---
Don't worry, Reddit will ruin it eventually.
---
I dropped mine for 20m two days before the update. Phew
---
I'm not picking sides because I'm not a manchild.
---
Those exist, they're called alchables - random rune pieces, battlestaves, etc. That just introduces another problem though: inflation.
---
I was not scamming though? You need to stop jumping to conclusions. Why would I scam on an account that took 100s of hours?
---
99% of all streamer content that comes out of this game is either Ironman or deadman mode. At this point, mains are just a segue into the real game, which is some form of Ironman. It’s much more rewarding imho. 
---
People are acting like DHCB is useless at Hydra but if anyone has actually tried it (if you dont have a T-bow) theyd see its pretty much at least as good as using rune darts. Ive been doing MOST of my kills in max range with DHCB and then using BP with rune/drag darts for the last 30-35% and last phase. Ive been getting longer trips, more consistent kill times and my best kill so far has been done with this method over just straight rune darts. Dragon darts is better but it isnt insanely better and it obviously comes with a much greater cost.
---
People started freaking out and panic selling DHCB because an hour after release, Woox said BP with rune darts is better and that was because he put it into the dps calc that hasnt yet added them to their table and doesnt account for mechanics. The last phase, will probably be faster with a BP more often than drag diamond bolts and you should switch to a BP for it though. Something is clearly off or the entire story isnt being told in the DPS calc because so far in my experience my kills were not as consistently fast on average with DHCB ruby bolts w/ BP switch at end compared to straight rune darts. And a lot of my kills after the first few hours of getting a handle on the fight were being done with little to no mistakes and little to no food eaten so there isnt an argument for user error.
---
I encourage people to try it, I suspect its slightly faster than straight rune darts because of the ruby bolt effect and the fact with decent RNG you can hit some big numbers which will lead to getting through/skipping the Blue/Red phase which is pretty much the most important part to getting the fastest kills. Theres only a certain speed you can kill it without blazing through one of those phases or skipping it because of DPS. 
---
So I actually did a \*little\* tiny bit of skilling, getting herblore from 35-53 since it's stupid fast. I think I have like 55-56 banked still. Right now my goal really needs to be working on magic, I really need 70 to burst. Also since I got 51 agility today I'll boost to do Regicide, but I do want to get 55-56 anyways cause I got an elite clue in the bank on last step which requires seer's agility course. 
---
Oh - I \*will\* be training some hunter lol. At least to level 40 for now. Same with farming, I plan on getting it to 40. After 40 farm/hunter I will try and do 40 runecraft also, and I've got 40 construction banked just from long bones so I'll go trade those in soon. After those or maybe before those, I'm going to get 50 woodcut and 50 smithing so I can actually complete legends quest and then do a few more quests I want. 
---
But hey I'm pretty happy with how it's looking so far! Almost at 1250 too, and other than 4 stats everything is 40+ (almost 50+) and the only stat real far off is hunter. And RC I guess to since apparently it's slow. I've literally never trained RC in my life on this game, or hunter, or farming lol. Hell first time I did construction was on this account :D 
---
J1mmy is so good. Watch his according to J1m series. Best stuff on YouTube.
---
Absolutely not. People who disagree have never fought those bosses.
---
That's not what that means. 
---
Thanks I hate this
---
Toxic BP w/ Addy darts, Assembler, blessed hide, fury
---
Dividing by 80% would increase the value, not decrease 
---
I saw the guy who has the Queensland Zezima plate in my local town
---
I think there's potential to make combat more interesting than what they're doing now. For example for AOE attacks, making it matter where you click, what you click, and when you click is more interesting than just moving anywhere from splash damage spam.
---
God bless
---
Because scamming is easy money and bro it’s whatever you’re not gonna get unmuted so give up. 
---
Sell Arma and if needed ancestral for tormented brace for sure.
---
r/theyfuckedupthemath
---
If it is, I say good! When they poll something repeatedly they always make changes (exceptions are things they repolled after long periods to regauge what the players want) and those end up being constructive, just like with Raids Rewards.
---
The core black demon drop table is the same. You'll always get something from it when you kill a black demon, no matter which slayer master you use. When you use Konar, though, you *also* have a chance to get an additional drop from a special Konar-specific [table.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten#Konar's_drop_table)
---
Fuck tencent. Fuck em right in the ass.

Thank yall.

---
THIS. This is why they keep their bots online spamming GE.
---
and yes, it was a bot, lol
---
I'm exactly the same. I cannot stand the fact that the most efficient way to level most skills is by first spending hours *not* doing the skill, or by killing monsters to skip the skill entirely (farming, woodcutting, mining etc). Until now it has been pretty good to be fair to Jagex but ironman are out there pushing for these updates then they're playing ironman for completely the wrong reasons.
---
I read it on the wiki they gave another kind of bird nest or something
---
I was agreeing with you up until I read the fishing part.

i dont get it, is the joke literally that theres more than 1 thing called drake
---
Proof that Reddit needs to add a sad react
---
It's fucking hilarious when you think about it. People started doing Ironman to make the game harder. Meanwhile, it seems like every other update exists to make things easier for Ironman players. 
---
u get a third hitpoints xp of what u have in other combat stats just about so do a lil guessing thats what i do lol, i dont use combat calcs to check what combat level i will be i just use to to check how many range or melee levels i can get untill i become melee or range based
---
Depends on the task and the combat level of the monster. At nech's I noticed myself hitting the table more (stuff like 5k earth runes) and at lower level kalphite + ankou I never hit it.
---
like when people were afking nmz, i did it too but they should have just removed it, sometimes jagex is pretty unprofessional 
---
It deserves as much reee as it's been getting for the same reason the dragon legs did. If you want it to be a cash injection, make it drop 7m in flat cash.
---
By making it another item, it depresses the value of that item gained from other sources. If someone came into 2.5k brews, that's 2.5k brews someone else doesn't have to make to put into the market to satisfy demand, leading to an overall higher supply and lower prices.
---
Oh then you cant change it f2p but i dont think the type of boots you chose made them look any different when you equip a shoe. The only difference is when you are a male or female character
---
because standing under people is very skillful and changing your gear without your opponent knowing whether you're gonna spec with melee or get slapped with ranged.

The problem is that my fancy boots are default not elf shaped but my default boots are elf shaped. Elf shaped means they’re big and pointy. The other shoes are flat and not elf like. 
---
They emulate the better updates though which is fine. Just because it came from RS3 doesn't make it bad. There were good updates throughout the years within the piles of garbage that are worth adding to OSRS. Not everything has to be an original idea to necessarily be good. 
---
Plus it's probably easier for them to recreate old content so we can have more content faster.
---
You got down voted because it had no relevance to what was being discussed and this isnt an rs3 sub. Also PS rs3 is dying gg no re

Yeah was just wondering if anyone had knowledge from like twitter, or a newspost / Q&amp;A, or someplace that I don't know.

tech debt is great.  it's why tech companies have internships open

The problem with solving tech debt is that it's a lot of fun for the programmer, great for the longevity of the game, but you get a lot of shit from players who don't understand how anything works.
---
they need an AbstractMonsterDropFactory somewhere in there

Has anyone tried dark bow for the last hit on hydra at the end of a phase, like with Zulrah? Seems like it could be good but not insane.
---
Ok but explain why D'hide is used for tanking Mage spells, and Melee armor is for tanking ranged hits?
---
I am perma muted dumbass 
---
I agree with you almost 100%. However, the 2k and 2.2k total worlds make the grind worth it in the long run.
---
Tbf I got the same loot once but coifs were 7 gp early back then.
---
"Hydras", not "Alchemical Hydras"
---
It's called a debt for a reason: The cost of hiring someone to fix messy code in the present is far cheaper than the cost of doing it in the future. Because it never gets cheaper, it just keeps accruing interest.
---
The problem is many executives making the financial decisions either don't understand the burden tech debt can have, or they're don't expect to stay long enough to give a shit.
---
IT security has the exact same issues: Resolving a breach after it's happened is far costlier in time and money than preventing one from happening to begin with.
---
A ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
---
Sounds very expensive
---
more unpopular opinion. just like in American democracy - uninformed voters shouldn't vote.
---
When a new quest comes out everyone is doing it blind but at the same time so even though it might have a tricky part everyone works together to figure it out.  It's pretty fun doing them on release seeing all the people brainstorming and helping out
---
Why do you have a problem with this?
---
melee armor is used for tanking ranged and melee, dhide is specifically mentioned to be better at deflecting magic, while metal armor is explicitly said to be weak to it. robes shouldnt have tanking capacity better than melee tank armor, but i do think there should be a solution to mages being weak to being hit that arent safespotting, because that works on everything

Whats your strategy for avoiding the lightning orbs? I go to the middle of the room. Then I run to where the last orb will be before it's shot out and do a wide lap of the room. However I feel like I lose time here and it's very inconsistent. I get banged here a lot.
---
Lol i thought i shared the link, I edited the post with the link. Thanks for letting me know =)

hehehe funny
---
I dunno took me like 3 raids to feel confident in what i was doing, seems wasteful for people to just stand there for an hour while you roll at loot
---
They could possibly be done with the current melee BiS color-way. Perhaps they’ll match a later release in a couple years when there’s new best in slot melee, which fortunately, or unfortunately, is inevitable for the game to stay relevant in the long term.
---
I'm a lvl 3 skiller so I can't say exactly lol, but it does have a 'Whack' option on all other players like the rubber chicken.

Early in the day I saw on Faux’s stream that he would just run to the corner of the room (northeast I think? The one that you pull the blue form to). If you stand in the far corner, you’ll take one hit from the lightning so it’s not a ton of damage and it’s easier than dodging them. Downside is that you can’t pull it over to the next vent while you do this, so you waste a little time on the red phase pulling it over.

Dude, it's Osrs. You play this because you don't like EOC, which enabled Jagex to create a LOT of different boss mechanics that you need to use certain abilities to negate.. Osrs is very restricting in what they can actually do. And no, this isn't a RS3 &gt; OSRS post, as I actually play both and enjoy both equally.
---
Hey guys I just made my first OSRS NH Pking  video. I've really been inspired by the great content creators our  community have, so I wanted to try it out myself. Please feel free to  leave me comments on how I can get better if you do watch it. Thanks\~
---
Disclaimer-  I'm not a pro pker, part of the point of making the channel is to  connect with other players who are trying to get into NH Pking and other  content.
---
Who is that?
---
Yeah but those are different types of dummies. Those let you train your attack to level 8.
---
All this dummy does is let you see what your max hit is, and doesn't give any exp (would be pretty broken if it did lol)

Is there a reason for herb prices to stay up? Besides herblore being "too expensive"
---
Oh god forbid them making level adjustments. Op 20iq btw

Meh, i'd say everything other than the brews only requires slight tweaking, considering the rarity. People seem to be losing their minds over a 7m drop that statistically rarer than 3rd age.

Try go defensive for longer range
---
Sometimes you have to be bored to appreciate the things that are fun
---
Does it only work from the new slayer master or is it everything?
---
No, it’s the same mechanic as before, each brother is one kill
---
I didn't even think about that... Still doable maybe but not as simple
---
Herblore *will* stay the most expensive skill. Prices of finished potions will just crash with the prices of their herbs along.
---
Mooooooaaaan
---
I'm sure there is a safespot if you stand within the ore rocks. What you could try doing is manually cast the spell from the book. I'm sure years ago that was a solution also.

Nah it’s pretty broke, you get consistent 100k+ drops

Majority of reddit doesn't have 95 slayer either, they're just annoyed that they can't afford t bow and have to watch people make money. 
---
that was after hotfix
---
Sick screenshotting tool
---
If it wasn't obvious, yellow tile is the spot. Sorry.
---
have you heard about it?
---
What are you talking about? Slayer was already massively profitable.
---
They give -15 to range and magic attack. They're only BIS for melee
---
It requires 95 slayer and can only be done on task. Vorkath is slightly higher gp / kill, and you can do it off task?
---
The price seemed to have dropped because it wasn't as good as anticipated for hydra and with it being a pretty expensive item it made for an obvious sell for those who where a few 100m short of a twisted bow for hydra. Anyways, looking at the graph so far it took a node dive shortly after launch and even went as far as 265m. Then it bounced back up to 305m and back down to 295 which is sort of like the market reacting to abrupt changes.
---
Since then it seems to be looking rather stable at 295m.
---
I can't see the future but to me it doesn't seem dangerous to keep. The price is about normal, all that happend was that it shed some weight from merch inflation 
---
Clicking links in 2019, smh
---
U profit of slayer anyways on high lvs. But yea its pretty nice
---
That's what i was doing was manual casting but everytime my guy would run out from behimd the rocks in order to cast the spell
---
Sick looks
---
yeah i did, but i thought they would've allowed it since they're both planted in the 'cactus' patch.
---
Usually you can't access places by boosting, so I don't think you could plant the tree in the first place.
---
Seems to happen to me aswell. Tried warning the players of a phishing attempt ingame but my post gets deleted every time without explaination... Is there any info about some kind of limit?

&gt; KQ
---
Only made possible because of a new item. Doesn’t exactly make it a mage boss when it requires one specific item to do it.
---
How don't I know about this? What's the change?
---
He also allows you access to dropping visages.
---
Even so, I think the hassle of having to go to specific areas in order to kill the assigned is worth having more valuable drops. I couldn’t tell what drop table OP was referencing.
---
I guess on paper it's pretty ridiculous. But then I think about how its task only. Some people got super unlucky today burning through thousands of points to not get a hydra task. The fact that accessibility is gated behind your luck at getting a task makes it less offensive in my opinion. People post all the time about their loot from a weekend at vorkath or zulrah, but you can't really do that with hydra. 
---
So while it's more gp/hr when you are doing it, you're gonna be making less money while you do other tasks in between before you can get another hydra task. 
---
When I thought about it this way I felt like it was a pretty neat way to balance it. Especially since it's from konar only and you can't do the most efficient thing for every task. You might have to deal with a slow task that can't be cannoned or burst before you get another shot at rolling for a lucky hydra task. Maybe you have to sacrifice doing demonic gorillas for a black demon task since konar told you to do it at catacombs. 
---
Although I dont have 95 slay yet, I'm hesitant to switch to konar once I do since I really like the freedom to do my task where I want, how I want. I'll probably give it a shot and evaluate, but for now I'm on the fence regarding which is better. 
---
I guess to sum it up, the fact that hydra is a boss with restricted access via slayer tasks makes it a lot less efficient overall since it can't be camped. 
---
I got one doing my fruit tree run, planted it last night, It cannot get diseased which is good.
---
Doesn't seem worth to run around for so long to avoid a lightning hit since you are sacrificing so much dps
---
I love these
---
OSRSHelpMe - I'm usually doing slayer or some other mindless skill. 
---
And how does this affect YOU personally? Either you're 99 and butthurt cause "Oh No My AcHiEvEmEnT!" or you should be happy a notoriously long skill, with no real benefit of reaching 99, is a bit quicker.
---
Classy
---
Probably sand crabs. I’d suggest doing slayer though if you like variety. 
---

Thanks. I came by and got a KC today. Really appreciate you putting in so much time to help out the community.

Why are you calling gloves with defenses lower than leather gloves, BIS?

It's not Tencent. It's a company called Zhongji Holding. It's basically a venture capitalist company whose sole purpose is buying companies they think can be profitable and making money off of them. 
---
Is this drop table only available with the new slayer master?

Dang, just bought mine for 2.2m :p

Support. I was pretty disappointed to see all these new drops today. Just doesn’t feel right 
---
Wow so op
---
Catacombs of Kourend greater demon task also does not include Skotizo
---
Assuming you're not an ironman, use a cannon for every task you can. Not only does this speed up the task and xp, but it also makes it more afk so you can more easily watch a movie or what have you while you slay. And yeah, just keep yourself distracted while you afk it and it'll go by quicker and feel less grind-ish.

Jagex may intentionally screw with the rare drop table at every boss release to create a high high player count who feel the pressure to get in on it early. The economy of one or two items may break but it doesn't exactly break the game. Imagine trying to tell someone you quit an mmo because the price of a potion dropped

At 99 farming wirh all 8 patches i would make roughly 1.2m an hour i feel like.  If im playing a lot that day i can do 5 farm runs, each takes about 10mins if i only do herbs(usually to pet chance shit with these) and in 10 runs profit about 2-2.8m. I was using snaps for xp sake as well, toad was better money. Now i have no idea what rates are now

There shouldn't be such drop table.

What does entrana do for caskets?

What are you trying to hit on easy clues if not team cape?
---
I don’t think so, as you are not using zulrah scales upon attacking.
---
Yep, it really is dumb Konar gives more points than Duradel (despite needing you to be 25 combat levels higher) with the only offset being the location is determined by her. Which like you say is compensated for with the extra unique drops. There's no reason for me to use Nieve unless I really really want to choose where to fight my monsters.
---
Must be nice
---
It's pasta
---
If the only difference between konar and duradel/nieve was the slayer point difference then you would essentially be sacrificing kills/hr (and therefore exp+gold per hour) doing tasks in odd locations for a few extra points.
---
It'd still be worthwhile going there for streak tasks but otherwise, without the drop table, I don't think it'd be worthwhile at all. I don't have an issue running out of slayer points using nieve.
---
I went to put berserker on and fat fingered my attack style hotkey, one whack with the slayer staff leveled it. fml
---
They honestly shouldn't re-poll at all.  This isn't something that should be polled at all.  This is just the way it should be.  Voters shouldn't be able to make decisions in polls based on which side is winning or how close it is to a side winning, or anything of that manner.  People should make their choice completely based on whether or not they want to vote one way or the other, with zero possible influence from knowing the results.  Results shouldn't even show after voting due to how many people have multiple accounts.  Results should only show after polling is finished.

There's a lot to do together in this game but not a lot to do efficiently together, most things its probably better just to solo, but if you have some friends theres a million things to do or you could join a guild and do godwars dungeon/raids.
---
Yeah, it's tough when you're level 1 Farming and Jagex releases a large Farming themed update.
---
Except this rdt makes you do otherwise pretty shitty tasks all the time.
---
If they nerfed konars drop table there would be literally no reason to use her outside of getting a hydra task - and having to save 500-1k+ points to get a boss task without wasting a bunch of a time on useless tasks would make hydra a pretty shitty piece of content.
---
good news homie, check out a combat calc with maxed stats 99str/hp  u will see that 1 attack has the same combat level as 2 attack.  i know it looks shit but atleast it wont bother you pk wise :(  dont get 3 attack though xD
---
both the extra essence and the 10% more runes were in the poll, it's what got voted in so i don't know why it isn't mentioned
---
Spiritual creatures is the worst fucking thing

In the first guy's case you'd have to roll it infinite times. What Ash is trying to say is that you have a chance of hitting it on the first try. You can't agree with both as they are each making a contradicting statement lol

A male duck is called a drake. The wiki explains this accordingly. Sometimes, people use the word drake to refer to dragons, which is probably what op expected to see under the wiki page for drake.
---
Has farming been nerfed, I was about to start training it?
---
? vorkath and dragon slayer tasks is " BIS for enough things?" The boss is  a dragon. An item used SOLELY for killing dragons shouldn't be outclassed by an item that is 1/20th of the cost imo. I think you should need dragonfire protection for hydra and the problem is solved.
---
I like it actually maybe should've added more alchables tho and half the herbs
---
Oh boy.
---
This quest sucks ass. The only funny part is the hopeless creatures 
---
Do the same with mlm poll booth.
---
This was there already, even before the recent update. These exist north of fally too. Always been there.
---
I disagree, low level slayer tasks are easy as fuck. You’ll be fighting things that are level 10-40, training combat and slayer at the same time. Doing crabs to base 70 is more afk not more efficient.
---
Well it just kinda seems like the Konar drop table is a little bit uhhh strong? Like I was doing slayer in discord with some mates last night (first night of release) and I got 2.2 mil in an hour. My friend got like 1.5mil in the same hour and someone else in our discord got like 1mil. Idk if we all just got hella lucky but it seems odd. I guess we'll know for sure a little bit later on 
---
The skill is going to be good, you are uninformed and disconnected.

I planted mine 16 hours ago and it isn't done.

oh its Jagex we're talking about here. You got time pal

---
Why can't we have the option to toggle on and off experience gain so shit like this never happen again? 
---
I don't even think its the boss thats got the good table lol. The hydra seems okay but unless you hit a pretty rare item its not even worth other than to get slayer points. I got 2.1 mil on greater demons last night from the task. Like 189 grimy taskar noted drop loooool
---
For fucking real though. Broken glassed, mouth breathing, smelly chair douche bags that are mad because someone somewhere MIGHT get something a little easier than THEY ever did are the reason for 99% of game changes being vetoed or nerfed

50m for a herb cape isn't bad. According to the wiki (probably not relevent anymore with these drops) but it was a 4.01gp per exp making prayer potions. That's 52m loss for a cape which is pretty reasonable.
---
Saradomin would like to have a word with you, 
---
Why do you think it is an integrity issue?
---
Oh shoot I honestly thought the herb drops were glitches... 
---
And here i am 80kc just an eye
---
its literally almost as efficient as 3 tick barb and red chins. I mean its NOT as efficient but for people who despise those methods its a GREAT alternative for solid xp rates. 60k fishing and 80k hunter per hour is NOT dead content.
---
The problem is actually the "weirdness" or "private server feeling" that receiving 200 herbs from a random mob just because you have it as slayer master.
---
I think they should fix it by adding some sort of token from killing the mob on a task that she wants so you trade them in, and she gives you the resources.
---
Doesn't matter what they do, this sub will always found some sort of made-up flaw about Jagex and start thrashing them for it. The endless cycle!
---
And you have proof it isnt?
---
That's basically the equipment I've got on right now, save for the climbing boots.
---
I am wearing earmuffs for banshees, yeah, but it was more the fact that I couldn't actually *damage* them often enough to out-perform their self-heal. And since they *could* damage me, it was nothing but a losing battle. And I have to kill like 90 of them.
---
Im predicting one month will be taken up by a streamer/youtuber saying racist things on a video. 
---
Another month where Jagex reveal a long established character is actually gay and everybody freaks out about it. 
---
ISIS attack DMM. 
---
MMK gets into a physical fight with the creator of runelite. 
---
God Ash retires after microtransactions are introduced into the game. 
---
I can support this. 
---
Petition to rename it to "B0aty".
---
Yep, they definitely managed to get in to your registered email. The good thing is that you'll get their IP (or proxy..) and can get a good idea of who was behind it.
---
Make sure you don't recycle passwords, especially not for important stuff. Keep them unique and it will be a lot more difficult for anyone to gain access to other platforms.
---
Only piece of content released after Chambers of Xeric that twisted bow is BiS is inferno lol.
---
I guarantee you farming slayer tasks is easier than farming shamans.
---
his stuff is very clean and consistent, but my main criticism is that his poses often feel very rigid and unnatural.
---
Eeee mida, mis koolis sa käisid? Jätkuvalt pole taskaal sõna eesti leksikonis, tasakaal on.
---
It looks like you care 
---
It is, with a super rare chance to make the herb drop. On rs3 I legit have never gotten anything good of their rdt. Thats with 20m slayer. A person getting more then 1, let alone 2, in 13m slayer xp is and will be rare. In the meantime you could have done herbiboar or farmed herbs through farming and gotten 100x the herbs. 
---
Stop overreacting so much.
---
Specially if u seen it yesterday hahaha
---
I bet even with names turned off we could successfully tell Serene to shut up more than 50% of the time.
---
Konar is only good for gold, removing that incentive would make her so bad. 
---
&gt; "them"
---
&gt; is in the sub
---
:thonkging:
---
Tread carefully, you are clearly in the presence of an alpha male.
---
You forgot runecrafting. Maybe a rare chance to craft a negative xp tablet? 
---
MLM.
---
Have you used the player owned farm? Massive farming xp over there every single day.
---
That’s some sick ass fashionscape mate!
---
I got 165 Torstols on my HCIM 2 hours ago..
---
Was just bursting nechs and Boom 1.8m drop.
---
Someone said using the Sang staff for both phases which I guess is made possible because of it’s healing effect, but I’m not exactly sure.
---
Was that an attempt at a "Gotcha!" moment? I said "half of them" you fucking potato
---
Agreed, it adds a nice incentive for people to do slayer, i don't see any reason to take that away from people, slayer before 70 until this update has been worthless, adding this is a great re-vamp, and then to discuss nerfing it because some people got first day good rng? 
---
Where's my dagannoty queens
---
I don't think so. It's in an instance so I'm pretty sure it just doesn't even generate the drop of you die before the drop appears. 
---
Idk... Theres plenty of things to camp for alchables already. Balancing the game around ironmen is only reasonable to a certain extent.
---
Can you get a friend to poison it? No idea if that actually works
---
Sure
---
What laziness? I could of gained shedtons more supplies by not doing the tasks in inefficient areas. Your looking at at least double the time for some tasks. 
---
I personally think seeds or much reduced herbs should be the limit, not these big drops. However the rarity seems to dictate the amount being dropped.
---
25-30 Iron's in my CC all slaying happily with the new master. One of them got a herb drop in the entirety yesterday.
---
People are making this out to be a much bigger issue than it really is.
---
Get back to me when you know how to write code.
---
Copy pasting doesn't count.
---
Have a good day :-)
---
If Konar is not nerfed, other slayer masters will be dead content. Plus the economy will be screwed. 
---
I honestly don't get this attitude. Konar isn't supposed to be the best slayer master, she's the third highest slayer master and should therefor be the third best. 
---
The fact that she gives the highest amount of points outside the Wilderness should be more than enough incentive to use her regularly. The bonus drops should only be a relatively small bonus, not drops above 500k.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little shit? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.

in mm2 caves its around 400k/h

Berserker neck for negative def bonuses with recoils, sammy brew 0 def or venom it with main serp helmet blow pipe brewed to 0 range and punch witg flowers on skiller
---
New BiS melee gloves for added power creep, Replacing rapier as BiS for some of its Niche content with DHL, Going against ethos of Skilling drops from PvM isn't good, 70% exp increase on fruit tree patches, this feels like an update balanced for RS3.
---
you have to chase those fuckers around too much 
---
You can check the fight duration &amp; PB, if those are also the same I’ll gladly meet you somewhere so I can show him :)
---
Osrs history? Which ranarrs are u smoking
---
They mostly assign high-levels, mostly.
---
If you can get some combat XP, try to poison it maybe yourself?
---
I wonder how hard it would to break something that only prints hello 
---
Jesus dude, you want 5 torstols for a drop that you will only get literally once in your while life playing this game? 
---
talking to the guy in the cemetary was a nightmare with all the skeletons, same for the pirates/bandits ?
---
send me a screenshot of that :)
---
It's not nearly as OP as you think. Even killing just aberrant spectres bring in more herbs than the konar table
---
people don't care about the points, she gives the same points as Duradel, the only reason people are using her are for the chance of these drops, this isn't going to ruin the economy whatsoever, the chances aren't 1/128.. for the drops above 500k the chances are over 1/1k
---
the points she gives are certainly not an incentive
---
nice d chain :) best armour
---
DOULBING MONEYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!........wtf reddittttttttttt i got muteddddd
---
Exactly. And it’s locked behind 75 cb, and scales to monster. I don’t understand why people are bitching.
---
I mean that doesn't look bad imo.
---
There's a private server community thread filled with RuneScript snippets and an analysis of them, I'd link it but I'd probably get banned. lol
---
Big if true
---
Probably not because a lot of people have access to that compared too the 2k world 
---
Relax I don’t really care that much, gz on pet buddy
---
Yeah that's me in game, claptrap is a character from the borderlands game series. Guess you've not played it?
---
?
---
Ahh right.  
---
see you in lumbridge!
---
It is rare, but you have to remember that literally tens of thousands of players are doing this new content since it just released. Of course you’re bound to see people that got it. Drac visage is rare af too, but if enough people do it, you’ll see people who have gotten it.
---
It's me in game, I have primordials on mate look closely 
---
I'll take it as a challenge
---
It's bad because if you want to make changes to drops, you will likely have to recompile your code in order for those changes to take effect. If you use some sort of data persistence technology, you would likely just have to hot reload files. It's possible they currently have hot reloading because it uses RuneScript, but still, data like that should not be hardcoded and should be decoupled from source code.
---
Pot emerald pot
---
Look up *argumentum ad populum* you absolute incompetent person. Jesus christ the amount of idiocy on here is laughable. Thinking that a "ponit system" dictates anything. Lmao.
---
Range does more dps and is safer, not worth it imo.
---
The entire Hydra failed to deliver. I thought it wouldve been a boss requiring all 3 combat stats to kill after seeing the teaser.
---
I would say you can't really assume that a specific subsection of the population with one particular interest is representative of the general population. If you actually want a proper subsection to represent the general population you need the selection to be truly random. If you select on any criteria the results will most likely be skewed as it is very likely that certain activities are more common within specific intelligence groups.
---
Almost a neccesity in a lot of MMOS. Nothing more retarded looking than having mismatched armour trying to level up. 
---
While I do agree, that's just the way pvp works in this game. You are able to protect item and thus risk nothing while having high kill potential. There are high risk worlds if you want to fight people that might not use a +1. Its unlikely for item protect to be ever removed.
---
I've been refreshing reddit every 2 minutes for the past few hours for the same info :P
---
Not surprising that your pseudonym involves "vegan". Swine, you deserve a terrible 2019.
---
There’s people who go 20m slayer exp without an imbued heart. Nothing wrong with cool ultra rare drops, your argument just doesn’t hold weight dude.
---
:3
---
I like the idea but think you should place a boss fight between the player and the cache. Like a guard? Something to make it feel like your braking into their cache and it’s not just free loots from a fire giant
---
I’m hard 
---
25% Duality : Will throw 2 knives at once, looking to be quite good for pvp combos
---
Am ironman so limited weapons haha 
---
s
---
I never understood why people were against this idea either. Armadyl armor, which is a chestplate and plateskirt, is bis for both ranged attack and magic defense... while being plate armor. Why magic can't have armor to tank melee hits?
---
Nobody really hunts for the pet in such desparation. Not that valuable or important
---
Only thing I’m gonna point out is it takes a lot longer than 25 hours to kill 5k shamans if that’s when the average person gets the drop.
---
So what's the deal with exp until lvl 106? Is it that exp based you'd theoretically be 106?
---
No, dumbo. Block the user if you're upset over nothing. Now.
---
Das pech rng weg
---
it allows you to cast spells you dont have the magic level for is what i meant, mm2 doesnt work until 94 magic and this method works at 75 magic with ovl and smoke barrage
---
Konar is what ROW should have been. Keep it as is.
---
A q p
---
Only up till 50. Not 60
---
Buttmad 
---
You’ve been able to 1 tick with no spec bar to spec bar for a long time. It takes skill, but it’s possible. If you weren’t aware, do your googles, guides have been out about it for years. 
---
I'm pretty sure we should soon have the first trees grown and people will start posting how they ~~killed it~~ died.
---
Oh you know, the extremely basic feature of saving usernames in your browser.
---
There’s buffing the rdt and then there adding a 7m drop for killing a bog standard mob. Buffing something doesn’t mean making it ridiculous. Imo removing the 2.5k brews was justified and also the herbs and seeds can be reeled in 
---
It does have requirements.  You need membership, 300+ total level and 25 hours play time.
---
Are you retarded? If Jagex wanted that they'd already be doing it. How about you vote what you really want just in case? If the vote really was rigged, then voting No for reasons like that won't affect it either. It's a game, get some hobbies so you stop taking it so seriously.
---
It does. Implementing ez-esque features for mobile users will likely transfer onto the regular client as well and contribute into the flawed direction. Also, don't talk to me that way. That's low of you.
---
Did you play back when torva and turmoil was in the game, and what were your thoughts about it? Imo it worked perfectly fine. Torva giving players 120 hp for a crazh gp risk was justified. Has jagex said anything about their thoughts on turmoil and damage soaking?
---
honestly fuck reddit sometimes man
---
I was genuinely excited for this update and now Slayer is going to be boring again.
---
Dude you're a fucking moron delete your posts and don't post again this isn't a bugged script and you know nothing about programming
---
Yeah maybe I'm doing something wrong but trolls seem super quick, usually not lasting more than 20 minutes 
---
What's the problem??
---
A joke 
---
Yeh but that’s not enough hours you could rack that up in a weekend damage a vote and quit if you don’t like the game 
---
&gt;	But if they go blindly removing this without a poll
---
This was added without a poll... Jagex even lied when they first described the drop table. They said it would drop supllies like food to help extend your trips... Not just add 1m to every slayer task.
---
What does agility have to do with vorkath gorillas and zulrah?
---
Is the dh 1 hp with the salve ammy equipped? 
---
yeah they're a fast task and about 60k/h which is relatively good
---
is ascent of acreuus a new quest? if so, you're right, at one point the elder litterally quote Thanos "perfectly balanced, as all things should be". it's funny but as you said; memes
---
How'd you do it btw?
---
Konar &gt; others
---
My point still remains, maybe someone can dig up the script for old Q&amp;As and find what i am calling out
---
Mine looks pretty much the same.
---

It's beautiful. Life changing. I had it all wrong until I saw this.
---
I know this is a late response but the new diary item hard version can tele next to her 3 times a day. Forget if the easy or med one does the same though 
---
Oof
---
Interesting fact: my ironman’s name is nxx and I made a hardcore ironman that is xxn. (One letter off of your name) Gz on the rapier man!
---
Well I know it's possible if you practice enough, but in years of pking I have never seen anyone execute it properly, even once.
---
2500 brew was too much but ash did say it was being extremely rare herb ones idk I dont make money from farming herbs or selling my herbs drops I use them most of the times so it would be nice addition.
---
No that looks like an emerald
---
I remember spending 20+ hours a task ranging them at lvl 70. The thought makes me cringe
---
Its not the total value that is the issue, but the large quantity of raw resources. Skilling is already low profit as it is.
---
I don't want them to repeat the same mistakes as rs3. Where every boss and monster needs to be a loot pinata 
---
I killed an average of 200 shamans an hour when I got my dwh with cannon, blowpipe and Addy darts
---
I'm still somewhat of a noob in the slayer world but I give a giant sigh of relief when I get trolls instead of metal dragons 
---
Isn't it also BiS against Zulrah, Cerb, KBD, etc? Sure those came before CoX but it still means Tbow just facerolls the game
---
Hey so this is pretty much like vorkath gp/hr?
---
“It’s literally impossible” 🙄🙃🙄🙃🙄
---
I got 130 snapdragons... from someone else's kill. They were cannoning trolls and their wayward cannonballs took out distant trolls (Where I was). After a min, I freak out because a one mil drop appears next to me. 
---
You a 1 def pure?
---
Ash ❤️
---
2^31
---
&gt; She should fill a certain niche, but this OP droptable is the wrong way to go
---
Konar does fill a niche though. She provides a world building aspect that was previously missing from Runescape due to the efficiency meta. You will now meet random people all over Runescape while slaying, instead of seeing everyone concentrated in either the catacombs or Stronghold Slayer Dungeon.
---
And there is a trade off. She gives god awful xp/h, some tasks barely even break 25k xp/h since you can't cannon. In exchange, she offers decent gp/h. Getting Torstols, Snaps, and Ranarrs are extremely rare. You're more likely to end a task with about 200-300k~ in loot, or even nothing, than you are with one of those drops.
---
For comparison, Nieve and duradal Dust devil and Nechraeyal tasks bring in WAY more CONSISTENT gold per hour than Konar tasks. In fact, I would love to see the stats on Nech/Dust tasks which *profit even when barraging* compared to Konar's average task. I guarantee /r/2007scape is making a mountain out of a mole hill again. This is a stupid hill to die on and a knee jerk reaction. 
---
When you get to 85+ slayer you don’t mind the repetitive tasks as much if they are good exp.
---
The tasks that give slow exp and little loot are the ones that become sickening. 
---
This guy permanently looks like something just a little bit too big has slipped into his ass. 
---
It doesn't matter how long you play the game. There are people who have played for years who have no idea about game balance.
---
The current guidelines discourage bots from doing it.
---
And this: "Just so that you don’t get new players/pures/Ironmen/pvp only etc who don’t vote for something because it might slightly effect them etc." - Every vote in the world ever has this stipulation. It's how the system works.
---
Except I’ve never seen teams do that at all.
---
Maybe the top 3 teams or something do that but normal W416 raids are nothing like you describe.
---
You're also using confirmation bias by basing your post off of this guy's experience with 2 tasks lmao
---
!remindme 5 hours
---
Unless you're like me and go 750 clues dry
---
They already said that the value of the drops wouldn't change.
---
i tb
---
Yes, I’m aware hellhounds drop hard clue scrolls. But I cba to bank my gear when I get one as a drop from other monsters. I usually wait until I finish my task. So for me personally, I don’t like hellhounds because once I get that hard clue, I know I’m not getting anything else. That’s just my preference though. 
---
A meow sayer.
---
Yes and no. They made rs3, but they made rs2.
---
I’m thinking of the Spider-Man meme now 
---
You can because some tasks have a higher weighting. There is a thread somewhere on here that explains it I remember reading it a few years ago
---
Way to early to consider buffing, like 12 have been killed
---
What's that language you're speaking?
---
'round these parts, you actually have to *wear* your armor
---
1 kronos and 2 toadflax.
---
I mean, kronos seed is pretty damn nice but come on... 24 hours to grow. How much farming xp was it, I missed it.
---
So fuck everyone that grinded to high slayer? We were also casual at some point. We didn't get these drops. 
---
100 leaping salmon for each brew seems balanced.
---
&gt;isn't time worthy to kill Cerberus 150+ times
---
Lol.
---
Names of high level herbs u dumdum
---
I want those "drops" while skilling, rng is rng so don't complain if I get a 10 bandos tassets drop while mining runite ore. As it's all random right?
---
I like the idea of bringing head to her. That's dope.
---
&gt;&lt;&gt; lvl?
---
Honestly I'm more pissed that they didn't even let the update settle for 24 hours before making an executive decision to change things.
---
I understand 2500 brews is stupid but 200 torstol or 250 ranarrs is pretty interesting and made me excited to get on the loot table. I understand the value won't change but I guarantee it'll be less interesting.
---
Precisely what I'm doing. If you're defending the uncalled for hatred, you're on the wrong side. Objectively.
---
Yeah that’s if you already have 87 hunter and 91 fish. 
---
It’s 12kish farm xp, considering this is basically a daily there is no need for it to be high gp/attempt 
---
How much xp do you get even its done? 
---
thanks for the advice my man
---
my Hespori is ready, will update
---
agreed
---
This doesn't change the skill gap in pvp, this gives people a chance to get massive drops at only level 75 combat doing low level slayer monsters
---
Oh is this so?
---
I thought if it’s 1/50k chance and there’s 50k people then the chances would be... 1/2500000000
---
Is this not the case? If so then why not? I understand what you are saying, but I don’t comprehend it.
---
well you gotta remember that konar will never be meta for xp, due to the area only stuff it means you'll have a lot less chances of cannon and barrage tasks. There needs to be a reason for wanting to do her otherwise she'd literally just be a worse kind of slayer master.
---
Yeah it does like the best solution, make it a sensible trade off in xp/gp, without just throwing down a bunch of herbs. 
---
Have you tried killing it yet? I have one planted as well.
---
What normal viewer would do that?
---
And the 2500 brews were already removed, right? 
---
Like 12K xp, I can get that in 16 hrs by checking health of my palms.
---
Global seeds are nice yeah, but come on 2 toadflax or 2 maple seeds, I get that in few birdhouse runs already.
---
North wing of the farming guild, near the fountain. BTW the wiki has all of these listed at https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails/Guide/Coordinates
---
I was thinking Fire magic spells, but an axe or tinderbox would be smart too.
---
I feel like the massive hype is why people saw so many of those good drops.. usually when new content comes out a massive flux of people do it. 
---
OK, just killed him. (i used guthans)  
---
So He is cmb 284.   
---
Drink superantipoison.  
---
And before u starting killing him u need to kill those 4 flowers first (otherwise u will hit nothind to him) while protect from magic.   
---
After that hit him, after some hits, those flowers will be alive again, so u need to kill them again... At the end, i got 12.6k farming xp, 2 willow seeds and 2 attas seeds?!  
---
They're upset about my post frequency and certain opinions, and used that to initiate a hate campaign. It makes no sense, it breaks moral codes and guidelines, and is certainly not justified or tolerated by any regular person.
---
Coming from the guy having a temper tantrum over someone else getting a handful of brews as a drop lmfao
---
Smoke barrage them and it's a pretty quick task, finding a world is a nightmare though
---
I don't think people really care about the rarity. It's just the fact that it can even happen
---
Not an argument, incompetent swine.
---
i dont know you at all, but to be fair your rsn seems like a toxic pking void player.
---
I heard Woox once managed 2 graardor kills in a row before his supplies ran out, crazy right?
---
I thought the recipe called for a whole tuna slapped on to a potato
---
Nah, it's just that they annoy me when I catch them. I've never seen Monty Python, so I probably just thought they were shit inside jokes.
---
What's the going rate on barely fucked chickens?
---
There's so many methods of teleporting around that you can unlock, it's not as bad as you think.
---
Why is that different than any other major drop that any monster has? Does it make sense gargs drop dark mystic? Or wyverns dropping d platelegs? Say you get 150 ranaars from 160 hellhound task, thats still less gp overall than wyvern or garg task average, now theres just more incentive to do the task.
---
mmm, just my opinion. you get more farming xp by checking health of your fruit trees, you get more seeds by basically doing anything.
---
those global seeds will be nice but you get to kill this boss every what 26 hours... I have 10 seeds sitting in bank already and it takes 26 hours to kill one of them, by the time I get second kc I will have more and more of those seeds sitting in my bank
---
When you post 30 times an hour every day for three years it's pretty easy to get 850k Karma. 
---
But I actually got this one. I just don't care as much about references that I don't know, because they may as well not be references to me.
---
They should block /r/2007scape at jagex hq. Pretty sure the same people who kept shitty hentai on the front page for weeks are the same people screeching about Konar now. 
---
Absolutely, totally reasonable.
---
sit fgt
---
doesn't really matter to me how rare the drops are, I'll still call them lazy.
---
Agree. These abyssal walkers are annoying, had to skip my first ever abyssal task on HC :'(
---
It seems like kalphites are the "little loot" kind, the xp is nice though.
---
Dragonfruit pies: boosts fletching +4  
---
10 fruits can be used to create bottled dragonbreath, which can be used on a dragonfire shield or ward to fully charge them instantly.
---
zSkillers
---
yeah, I would like a little adjustment. Maybe little less time to grow or add more cheaper seeds as a reward.
---
I have done 2 Drake tasks, 1 Ankou task, 1 Black Dragon task and I'm currently 70 kills into a troll task and I have had a grand total of 0 drops from Konar's loot table.
---
Considering the main purpose of this is the Anima seeds which last for 3.5days (and atleast 1 is guaranteed from Hespori) being daily is absolutely fine. Consider your extra drop a bonus. 
---
It would take 5 weeks to get from 75-91 slayer if you play 5 hours a day at 30k xp an hour. The average person doesnt play that much so why would you say "just kill Cerberus " when it would take months for the average person to even get the requirements to do so?
---
LOL jesus christ.
---
How much is it worth?
---
Thx for the info! 
---
bandos tassels is completely different from a 2m drop of herbs, get a grip without this drop table its another useless update and waste of time from jagex, i think you're missing the point still though.
---
It's really easy once you figure out the mechanics. I'm still fucking up a bit but able to get 4 kills a trip consistently.
---
I just don’t want it changed much at most make it 18-20 hour growth 
---
It was ment as a Joke m8 There is no clue enhancement
---
No hard feelings, good luck on your konar drops. 
---
there's been a few, and some which haven't been documented no doubt.
---
The Karambw-man, if you will.
---
its literally minor difference for the price currently not even worth.
---
Man, if I went through the BS to do a Master Clue and got 27K, I would be so pissed
---
Anyone can donate under his name lol
---
Wildy slayer is 25 points per task, what is your point?
---
yeah, sounds good!
---
I think the main reason why I agree with that it should just be mobile is that jagex explicitly stated that mobile wouldn’t affect the desktop game. Not just that, but if we update all the UIs in the game to be more modern then we start losing the old school feel from 07
---
Just saying if you're after potential but rare money from a task, you already have the option. HH (brothers) are pretty good for that gamble already. 
---
I like it personally, the only adjustments I can think of is to Make the food drops cooked and reduce the amount of high level herbs, the other drops aren't too bad since Konar has a 75 slayer requirement anyways and the drops won't be too game changing for Ironmen which have that requirement.
---
People aren't happy with it because Jagex kinda contradicted themselves as they say skilling should give skilling loot.
---
How so? 
---
well choose one, im 80 slayer but would seem this slayer master would be a waste of time if its not without the drop table, and another pointless waste of time from both players and staff.
---
Lmao just got that, its cancerous
---
Defending this hateful idea doesn't belong in any civilized society. Bunch of scum who belongs in prison.
---
What stops them from doing ranged besides being a crybaby that they arent doing as much damage?
---
I'd be more fine if someone said "Maybe, just maybe" to me while making a good point rather than "you are condescending piece of shit" and "lol cmon bruh" while not making any points at all.  
---
But maybe, just maybe that's just me though.
---
I don't think people understand a few things:
---
The impact that it would have on the ease of being an ironman - redic resource drops that you'd normally have to work for a month to get.
---
The impact this makes on the regular games economy - Torts, ranarrs, snaps, etc are important items in the games economy. The same is getting a lot more high value herbs into the game, but without the new update having the means to sink them out.
---
The impact this makes in our hearts - Hypocrisy due to the tree houses being nerfed because they *"Didn't want massive resource drops to come from pvm."* So they add it to afk slayer tasks. Not to mention fear of what the future may hold with updates like these making their way in until angry backlash from reddit.
---
In light of the dumb drop table, the Hydra being another mag/range boss where Tbow (BP for everyone else) is BiS again has gone virtually unchallenged. To me, this is most upsetting.
---
Nobody is going to grow them? What do you suppose the people who buy the seeds from the GE will do with them?
---
Yeah this is some bullshit. OP please remake with entire tuna on uncut potato
---
You've got zero clue, gj on confirming that. Don't respond to civilized people with misinformation and aggressive idiocy ever again.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
You can do sub 2 minutes Hydra kills with ADDY darts and few venges. DPS is just insanely big.  This is why it should consume more scales per hit, so you can balance fast kills with higher usage cost. 
---
I got 137 ranarrs last night, but I'm only 14 herblore. I think I can get it to 38 pretty quick though. Buying p pots is expensive
---
OSRS is a grind, and the most efficient way to grind this game is to pvm to get money and buy skills which you don’t need to level, but we all do for some reason.
---
But the argument that it forces people to grow them is just weird. I understand the people buying them is but the implication is that you have to grow them before selling them
---
What's so bad about this? 
---
Doesn't her loot already scale in some ways with what monster you kill? This just sounds like a more convoluted version of what's already in place.
---
I got snapdragons 3x yesterday, 145, 157 and lastly 172 drops. So i doubt it's 1/2k chance lol
---
probably, but I also have no intention to ever learn a raid so I'll abuse stuff like this if possible.
---
Should remove the slayer master completely and just put hydras on other masters task list anyone with half a brain won't be using her once the prices of hydra uniques drop anyway. She is dead content champs just don't realize it yet.
---
Yup. Seems you can have all sorts of combos with dragon knives. Saw someone used knife spec into gmaul spec into dds spec, 1.2 sec of easily dealing 100+ damage potentially. Add a ballista after that too.
---
Have you tried killing it yet? Curious what you found most effective 
---
When I was doing the intelligence yesterday I had someone come in max melee with d claws and try to spec out the gang leader when it spawned. He had a crap spec on the first hit then misclicked a different gang person for second one. I still got the drop. He got all pissed when they all died and he didn't get any. I felt no remorse for him as he tried to crash me when I was there before him
---
5 tasks in here, raw sharks and raw monkfish drop so far. Also a few 5k elemental runes and one 4500 pure essence drop. Maybe 7 or 8 Konar drops I think in 5 tasks. Seems pretty balanced to me if the bulk of the droptable is shitty runes, not sure if it is though, might've gotten unlucky.
---
Ah. I got 2k abysssal demon kills got 4abyssal heads and 1whip lol... 
---
#👌
---
I didn’t know picking up noted fish and ores from dead monsters raised gave me fishing and mining experience, thanks for the info!
---
Isn't this the same with extra steps?
---
yes having a main and 2 pk builds with 69slayer after 5 years of playing totally makes you an ehp autist who cares about magic being "0 time" on the way to 200m all.
---
Check the front page therrd a streamer lrtti g peoplr leech for free
---
Tyty
---
People being really dense about this. If you get 1 Torstol drop in 250 tasks that's an extra 8k gp per task. 8,000 Coins PER TASK, my god the economy is going to die from this.
---
Flipside is those tasks will take 50-100% longer depending on where your instructed to kill them. So less items actually coming into the game vs normal slayer.
---
Play the freaking game rather than bitching on reddit all day.
---
Fuckin 5D chess over here :o amazing point
---
Hxh !
---
I think the idea is that if only seeds are dropping, the price of herbs is less affected because the number of herbs entering the game is less drastic. No matter how many seeds drop, someone (with the appropriate skill level) has to plant the seeds and harvest the herbs, and there are only 7 (?) herb patches.
---
must be weird having a brother as your moms man.
---
Ah how prayer is so freaking broken in this game. 
---
I banish thee, Serene
---
I know that, and statistic-wise I'm sure it's ok, I just don't like how private server-y seeing a drop like that feels.  
---
Here's a comment from someone else:  
---
"That's true, but it seems odd that you'd be able to get such a drop from a hellhound. I saw a suggestion that monsters on konar tasks could drop keys for konar's storage or something. That would make more sense to me at least, without making it less profitable."
---
I see someone on ur minimap tho
---
So my drops were 1 x Attas seed and 3 x Toadflax seed. Hopefully everyone can post their loot so we can get an idea of the drop table, as you can only kill 1 per day. I planted mine about 24 hours before this post. Mechanics are easy, I have monster examine screenshots if anyone wants them, but pretty much kill the four pods every-time they open, then attack the Hespori. I always 1-shot the pods, not sure if something in my inventory caused that.
---
woman btw
---
2 went through, 23k is in his account, last one still going through confirmations 
---
Honest question because I haven't used the guild yet: why?
---
Do you know about the Guam-Marr method? You can do Lunar Diplomacy if you're close to that level req and stop right before the dream. Then you can get as many of the vials as you want and use all your Guams and Marrentils on them for 84 exp each herb. Great for early Iron. That or I'd recommend grinding woodcutting and then cutting Sulliceps for fossils and lamping your herb.
---
Yo this was really mean you should apologize
---
Agree 1000%. Its very annoying to have to range everything and I’m 99 ranged. Its just boring. Oh, look a new boss! Better make sure I have my blowpipe ready
---
300 drakes killed on 2 seperate tasks and not a single drop. so aids
---
There’s 9 herb patches?
---
I'll give you a CI of 95% that they will still have a problem with is after.
---
Can’t be imbued I assume? Remind me of the Onyx ring from RS2, but that could be imbued which made the other rings irrelevant. Hoping that the brimstone ring can’t be imbued for that reason. 
---
I'm saying ironmen should be irrelevant in the decision.  Updates were never meant to cater to them, it should be like they don't exist.  You can choose how you play after all.
---
They aren't, no. Lurk moar.
---
This is true
---
I am sorry OP
---
Found the fool.
---
The areas represent the tiers which requires different levels to enter.
---
Upvoting this because I like seeing players ask "How did this happen and how can I do this" instead of announcing "This is overpowered" and demanding it be nerfed.
---
Yeah it's called luck
---
The vocal minority of OSRS Reddit fucks it up for everyone yet again 
---
No, foolish pig.
---
Not quite sure, never tried ammonite crabs. Sand crabs are located along the south count of great kourand. There's good videos on YouTube on how to get there. I find them to be over crowded however so another option is rock crabs in relleka or water birth island. The latter is more afk. 
---
No other reason to use her???
---
She's the only slayer master who assigns hydras lmfao 
---

The max hit of fire surge in pvp is 49
---
There are certain special attacks on some weapons that cane hit incredibly high, even up to 99. Some good player killers can “stack” a bunch of high hits at the same time and one hit KO a player if done correctly. 
---
Also, RIP.

This is now a way for skillers to get Xeric's talisman. They seem to have similar drop tables to Lizardmen, except for the addition of bolt tips. [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stone\_chest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stone_chest)
---
Hope it won't make Konar completely worthless after the coldfix and everyone goes back to duradel.
---
Duradel should be for XP, Konar for money.
---
Oh my God I thought I was just misclicking... Didn't realize it actually changed...
---
Yea that's how speed is displayed on the wiki since they use their own speed definition.
---
The crystal halberd is a 7 tick weapon (or 3 in wiki speed) 
---
so for it to display +3 in wiki speed on the hover text it would mean op was wearing a 0 speed weapon which would be a 10 tick attack which as far as i'm aware doesn't exist 
---
I know we cant see them here but I hope I'm not the only one who genuinely upvotes a lot of your comments dude.

What about the fact we need to use her to kill the Alchemical Hydra? 
---
What axe is that?
---
We're all autistic af
---
Yeah
---
Alchables at lower quantities. Yes they can have seeds/herbs etc on there just not insane amounts
---
good point, the profit you make from the effects of anima seeds are the 'prize' so to speak.
---
75 combat requirement*
---
Time won't matter because they don't hit often enough to out DPS their own healing. By the time they hit themselves for about 10 hp, they healed it all back up.

But in this instance if you swap to mobile it won't be the same.

''... but the rarer something gets (and the better the reward), the more we are just moving towards playing the lottery. ''

Guess we should remove pets then.

it's like on average 120k a kill and takes no effort, how is it bad?
---
1 kronos, 2 toadflax fml?
---
I understand you get off arguing with people and stating unpopular opinions, but what I can’t comprehend is why.
---
What patches are available there? Ie. Do i need to start going there on herb runs?
---
Whats the problem with people who prefer to combat and do PVM over monotonous skilling?
---
Revs
---
TBH if they just cut the herbs drop quantities down by 1/2 to 1/4 the table would be perfectly fine. Maybe reduce the magic and palm seed quantities too. 
---
Everything else is fine. 
---
Range wasn’t the BIS for the last huge update (raids 2) and before that the grotesque guardians came out where you have to use a mix of range/melee. I think the place where there is a serious lack is a boss built around primarily maging. 
---
I have played both. I'm Maxed on RS3 and I've killed most the bosses in T70-80 gear. There are some bosses that require more varied input, but I don't find RS3 bosses harder and in general, RS3 Bossing is easier than OSRS Bossing. It is harder to go to Graardor in OSRS and prayer flick everything in a solo than it is to walk into GWD 1 or 2 in RS3 and just Soul Split and AFK. The higher tier bosses get more difficult, but the same is true in OSRS.
---
Atleast that way everyone gets to do the content instead of needing hundreds of million gp gear.
---
Because the people who prefer one over the other are rewarded 10 fold.
---
Holy shit. This would've changed my UIM's world few months back. I accidentally got rid of my rune spear from TBWT, proceeded to get that shitty helmet as a reward from my next clue and then had to get a new spear from bloodvelds.
---
[Suggestion] Alch yourself
---
Wat
---
56 GP. 
---
Maybe spend less time sperging out on Twitch and posting Hydradicks and Gachi then? smh 14 year olds in 2019.
---
Only thing i can think of at the moment is the drop in coal prices due to konar drop table.
---
nerf ourselves hahaha, i love that! not the nerfing, but that sentence
---
Yes, pleb. Away with you at once, or else 10 years dungeon!
---
Definitely at least 9:

* Cabbage
---
* Ectophial
---
* Xerics
---
* Ice
---
* Stone
---
* Catherby
---
* Ardy
---
* Guild
---
* Pirate
---
Correct. The only reason why one would do Konar tasks is because of those drops. Personally, I have done 12 Konar tasks and have not received any of those drops yet, but I do sacrifice close to 10k exp per hour.
---
probably hacked account, hacker purposely wants it banned. Also, dont name and shame on Reddit, can get your account banned.
---
I always thought that it would be good idea with large updates to give some less used p2p equipment to f2p like boots up to addy, spears and so on
---
Is this Twitch?
---
I did 3 tasks last night - 145 Bloodvelds, 142 Hellhounds, and 15 Black Dragons. 
---
Loot from each...
---
Bloodvelds: 249 Raw Sharks, 259 Addy Bolts (unfinished), 50 Dragon Dart Tips
---
Hellhounds: Nothing
---
Black Dragons: Nothing (besides the typical stuff)
---
Manage your inventory better then
---
Ive never gotten more than just over a hundred herbs in a day. Id say im an average player. The fact that we can get a drop that is a days worth of herbs at max ehp from anything and you still dont see whats wrong with that Idk what to tell you dude.
---
I would love to have my own cattle!
---
&gt; Im 95 Slayer I havent profit from slayer unless I hit uniques which is rare 
---
boss more wtf
---
You're delusional if you think rare drops with a chance to be valuable from one specific master which half the time doesnt assign you catacomb tasks that youd normally do for totems, is more "broken" than zulrah.  
---
Why can't the rare drop table just have cash instead of herbs? If the point is to give people a valuable drop, then cut out the skilling supplies part and just give people the money. 100 dragon platelegs is a meme, but it's literally a stack of cash and makes more sense than a boatload of herbs or ores. People who want cash get the cash and the people who want skilling supplies can buy the skilling supplies with the cash. 
---
If the drop table needs to stay on Konar to make her the money slayer master that sounds fine with me.
---
Well, you said 1-2M, which is the Herb drop and not the now removed 7M in Brews. But those sort of bulk Herb drops aren't unheard of either.
---
It was extremely rare
---
I feel that! At 96 Slayer idgaf about getting the best Slayer xp per hr. The added chance at a fun drop has really spiced this shit up. I even did deviant spectres ffs. 
---
zerker would be your only good choice since you got your def too high. the questing alone takes you to 42 def so you’d be around 43 def after you’re done questing
---
Ironmen
---
Yeah I have the screenshot it just on my pc at home, at work currently so I just grabbed one that was posted in the Discord.
---
Why make something thats broken even more broken?
---
You're going to really piss off your successors. You really should be empowering your team to make cleaner code, whilst simultaneously explaining this to your stakeholders. 
---
Didn't they remove the brew drops? or is the wiki vandalised (wiki not wikia before the lynch mob shows up)
---
Also for the first time in a long time, I actually saw ppl slaying in forgotten places such as fossil island caverns and slayer tower! Brings more life and variety to the game for sure!!!
---
Tbf he's gotten like 4 of these 4 btc donations..... So ya close to 60k
---
How do you get Hespori seed?
---
Except it’s not 120k per kill 
---
No idea what you're on about 
---
Amen. I mean who the hell does troll task below the TOB? Konar that’s who.

I love contracts, the music the aestethics everything! the new seeds are cool, i've already gotten 2 hesporis (demi-boss). It rewarded me with 12k xp and an attas seed for the anima patch (better harvest)
---
LikE aLL ThiNgs SHoulD BE
---
Up.
---
What in the fuck
---
Some people have more money than they could ever spend themselves or on their family, so they give it to the people that keep them entertained and happy so that said streamer can continue to do so. Someone donating that amount of money definitely doesn't look at money the same way you and I do.
---
I agree the reaction was overkill, but Jagex definitely messed up here. They have said multiple times how skilling items should come from skilling, and then they do this. Even if the chances were very rare, these drops were absolutely amazing for players who do not slay in the most efficient ways (which is most players). It was just another update making Slayer the master skill while making skilling a little more useless.
---
Thats dank
---
Magic level 126 if that helps
---
I used monster examine but didn’t write it down.
---
alchables don’t crash in price like herbs, so giving multiple does nothing to the price 
---
Yes you did, easiest way of getting into pking is to be lv 1 defence. Look on youtube for pure making guides. As for that account id get members and level up and turn it into your main and start a new account for a pure. It doesnt take long if you get members for both accounts, and the stats you get will depend on the way you want to pk. GOOD LUCK!
---
This guy knows what's up. 
---
She has absolutely nothing going for her apart from a tiny chance to get a 1mil drop or so. I can do my normal Duradel tasks for 55k+ slayer xp per hour then spend four hours at vorkath instead of spending 5 hours doing Konar Bronze Dragon @ Brimhaven and Abyssal Demon @ Abyssal plane hoping I get lucky with a Ranarr weed drop instead of the 2000 pure essence or air runes most people are getting.
---
She's already worse XP, points, and GP efficiency than regular slayer masters, why make her worse? At least they way she is now gives some people a reason to use her. 
---
that would actually be fucking hilarious.
---
What about it’s range defense ? 
---
Do you think he donated everything he owns or what? 
---
Now that I come to think of it - *The Knight’s Sword* was a terrible quest.
---
Not only does it force you to run around Gielinor looking for people and items - it does so in the most inefficient way possible.
---
And, you don’t even get to keep the sword (by default).  The early smithing levels are nice though.
---
konar will be dead content as soon as the majority of the playerbase is done with their hydra pet at latest. konar is strictly worse xp as well as GP/h in comparison to the other masters.
---
Your comment proves my point. “At higher levels” please list more then demonic gorillas and gargoyles to your explanation in pulling over 700k a hour without these monsters? The point is that there is not enough monsters on the scale to actually validate the whole skill in itself to being profitable when there is only a select tiny few of monsters you can kill to make that. Sure every monster shouldn’t drop some bank item. But every slayer monster should have somewhat good drops in according to its level. Not just 2 or 3 that you need +75 slayer to kill. Point stands.
---
easy enough, use range or melee and attack the 4 things in the corner before u attack it, and again if u cant attack it
---
I've done 7 konar tasks and havent gotten a single drop yet, if they nerf this in any way shape or form im completely stopping slayer and going back to vorkath
---
You could pk on this account but it would not be extremely effective.  However, you are not too far into this account so if you want to you can start a new one for pvp.  We would probably recommend a 50 attack build.  If you choose to start over do some youtube research on how to quest and train a pure account.  It is very important you do necessary quests that give attack and/or prayer xp rewards before you reach your desired attack and prayer level. 
---
Yeah i've done around 300K and i have not rolled the rare table either don't think its worth the loss of xp per hour to use this slayer master on a main.
---
Tbh those 2m herb drops are as rare as shield left half’s and I can assure you unless you have god like RNG, you’re not going to get it anytime soon :/
---
Gotcha. I kind of like the idea that polled results can have room for dev creativity so things are still kind of 'discoverable' when updates come out, but you're right that there wouldn't be all this drama.
---
It's ironic. but that's exactly the logic they're using.
---
Herbs should come from farming, potions should come from herblore.
---
The lannisters send their regards.
---
"SHUT UP WOMAN!"
---
The drops are awesome for Ironmen. I have 7k pure ess and 188 Torstols so far. That's a ton of time saved. Also I don't cannon most tasks anyway so it's not a big deal to kill things in different places.
---
Too bad this was on a Kodak dude
---
I've done 10 tasks so far since the release and haven't received anything significant. But seeing all these drops had brought some fun back into slayer.
---
On the other hand, if it says "bring 2 just in case", I'll end up bringing like 8
---
We removed it and added a trivia section about it after Ash confirmed it did indeed exist and was removed shortly.
---
Someone needs to keep the updates in check. Otherwise mindless masses will destroy the game.
---
You're insane if you think it isn't lol. I did [this](https://imgur.com/3IavlQa) in around an hour and I've been stupid inefficient (trying out different kill methods/etc).
---
Yesterday I did a whole task of ~140 and I got around 17m not including uniques lmao.
---
haha thats what i was thinking. "It sounds stupid" but then i thought about, and this is Jagex logic 100%. Zulrah used to be the best way to get sharks. 
---
He should consider donating that to the English Government, a piss in the ocean compared to the amount his family has sponged from them over the years however, lefty twat
---
Anything to make hunter less aids gets my vote
---
Aw man this shit so wholesome 
---
Obviously not a normal viewer.
---
Oh boy!!!
---
That's the best way to do slayer imo. And tbh once you start to hit higher levels of slayer it's even more pointless to be as efficient as possible. You max out and then what? Might as well take your time and save some money.  Before this update was even announced I could do every slayer monster. Might as well at least enjoy leveling 
---
There aren’t any shamans in the battle front as far as I know.
---
wow, faux whinging about shit. Shocking. 
---
True but it's the same concept. Can't barrage in slayer tower etc
---
Wait the emerald looks the same... what am I meant to see here??
---
Try a kill and see
---
the wine tastes too good man
---
I was thinking about the dungeon under it. if that counts?
---
Pretty sure reddit complaining got Vorkath's drops buffed... jsing
---
Make a video guide
---
Give it a shot brotha, and update us
---
Well, it was cool for a day. Back to Nieve!
---
Nerf konan hellhounds
---
Some people think skilling is ruined, which is obviously false.
---
Skilling has been bad for a long time.
---
The new slayer master gives you a specific location you have to do your task 
---
True, but in which case you just buy better things to train herb for better gp/xp
---
I don't think anyone has ever said Hydra boss is too hard.
---
Got Greater Demons in Catacombs, but Skotizo doesn't count, is this intended?
---
So, more variety in the drops you're receiving... 
---
If you're doing slayer efficiently, you're not going to Konar!
---
You think 200 torstol is balanced? Even if it's rare it's still a stupidly broken drop
---
I'm happy for him! but why the fuck was it so hard for him to refer to the donator as a woman? 
---
I dont disagree, but remember it's only supposed to be a slayer boss.
---
the amount of people killing bosses at any time is way less than the amount of people slaying, you are completely missing the point
---
i wish. 
---
Jesus Christ his family were ill. You really want to resort to a system akin to America's, where cancer or even a broken arm can lead to financial ruin? 
---
Some people contribute more, some contribute less, some are a deficit. Doesn't mean they shouldn't get the same care from the NATIONAL health service. 
---
This is coming from someone who's a member of the conservative party, so don't reply calling me a "lefty" or whatever shit you try to drag out of your arsehole. 
---
It's a slayer demiboss, not meant to really be endgame content. It's no less mindless than Vorkath or Zulrah, and I would actually say it requires more effort than Vorkath.
---
Slayer monsters very rarely dropping significant sums of cash? Oh like superiors?
---
I fail to see the issue really, maybe alchables would be better than skilling loot, but other than that, fuck it
---
\*Looks at fight duration\*
---
Hope you enjoyed tanking lol
---
What is run scape? 
---
Should've sold when you could. I got 6 dragon fruit seeds last night after update. Got over 700k from em.
---
No, but the drops should have been skilling supplies already sourced from PvM. Bones, dragonhide, gems, seeds, significantly lower amount of herbs without removing them. That's what a PvM drop table needs to look like. Logs, ore, completed potions are ridiculous
---
Ughhh it is certainly possible to get enough data to run a hypothesis test and get an interval. You can run the test with 20-30 observations, which op actually has. 
---
I'm not the scrum master so I don't really have much control over the developers themselves. As I said, I'm fortunate to have a very experienced dev team who always deliver a great quality product, but that is driven by a veteran scrum master who runs a very very tight ship. 
---
My comments are moreso to comment that once to get to a large enough business, the expectation of writing good quality code isn't really there once it gets to leadership, mostly because they don't have code experience. 
---
In my team, I'm one of maybe 5 in a team of 20+ that has any code background. Big business doesn't expect it of product owners, only the coders and scrum masters and generally, they're less likely to speak up to leadership about deadlines as those are managed by product owners. 
---
I'm not saying it's good, just saying that's how it is in my experience. 
---
that doesn't affect my point about making money off raw drops

He said brews are useless now I said it doesn’t mention brews I.e brews are still useful u retard 
---
Ah I see. Thanks!
---
I mean, it's a bear, they're scavengers, I could honestly see it eating whatever it happens to find on the ground.
---
That’s 50k more than you would have got
---
*puts tbow on rdt*
---
Idiots - "Finally a good drop table! Don't listen to the superior nerds saying this will fuck up the t bow market!"
---
Pretty sure duradel is better for exp, higher weight for barrage/cannon tasks
---
I also didn't like it at first, but then I realized how nice this will be for mobile. And if its going to be on mobile then it needs to be on the main client for consistency's sake
---
Runes should come from runecrafting, herbs from farming, potions from herblore.
---
Skilling supplies should not come from pvm.
---
You don't see barrows pieces come from woodcutting, do you?
---
So? Do any other more profitable boss then buy the gloves. Let some other chump do the work.
---
I have little faith jagex will make the right decision. They seem to get frantic and dont explain their opinion on a choice well. All they need to do is provide statistical data sl the economy wont go bonkers
---
elite diary is already super good for hydra tbh
---
I panicked reading this, for a second there I thought I have to use the secateurs on the patch and I’d be doing it wrong this whole time
---
what about the 200 torstols?
---
Is there a requirement to use that weapon shop? Or in other words, can I just run right over to it without any pre-requisites and buy the spear?
---
2 tasks, got the dragon hasta but nothing else
---
I get not creating content specifically catered towards ironmen, but you can't just ignore the implications of content that affect a decent portion of the playerbase. 
---
why is it top tier skilling materials being rewarded from mindless slayer?
---
whats wrogn with a 2.2m cash stack drop instead? goes for revs too
---
Have you seen other slayer bosses? This isn't raids dude
---
They nerfed birds nests because brew prices plummeted...
---
Also more people are farming torstol for farming contracts.
---
I really like this idea a lot. The rewards are very reasonable - not OP, but good enough to make it worth doing, even at lower levels. Only thing I’d add is a pet chance when gambling points (kyatt cub maybe?)
---
I think it should be left as it is. Actually motivates me to keep doing it at a lower slayer level. It’s painfully slow and bleeds money until like 75+ especially if cannoning with the old drop tables. 
---
Yes but they said they want mole to be the primary supplier of birds nest
---
Its not becoming the norm lol. The majority of players are new or returning when mobile came out. Youre saying 10% is the majority when it's simply not the case. I guarantee there are 4x as many ppl under 110 cb than there are maxed. 
---
Farming: 1k herbs / day
---
Konar tasks: 1 herb/day
---
wow wtf jagex you are devaluing skilling
---
A Nice fun addition to Low-Mid and possibly high tier players a minority maxed high end content people moan like a bitch and they remove it
---
why did you reply to this one and not the other reply i had?
---
I feel like the fact that this was your second pet is also a small flex. 
---
Gambit said they're looking to keep the value the same and add uniques. I highly doubt if they keep it the same value it will be dead content. So much knee jerk reactions. 
---
Loot from a single warped jelly task lol. Went 5 tasks dry of a rdt loot though https://imgur.com/mU0mSaw.jpg
---
Yeah im definitely going to postpone my herblore grind a bit until prices bottom out.
---
As a "rs3er" I don't give two shits about your game but the memes and drama here are spicy, nice victim mentality though. 
---
For all 2 people who do that?
---
I've done a 150+ Drake task and a whole bloodveld task without hitting the drop table once. These posts are misleading 
---
I already stopped doing Konar tasks, the tasks she gives are so fucking stupid you gotta skip so many of them because they are just terrible locations where you can't use cannon.
---
If you want exp she is bad, if you want gold she is good. I personally want exp. There is better options to get gold like Vorkath.
---
no it doesn’t, people who pvm would just sell the catalysts. people who enjoy skilling would use the catalysts
---
And up until now we thought we were moving in the opposite direction in improving it
---
Source for getting rid of the brew drop? 
---
I got two doing farm run and fruit tree run.
---
Petition to also move motherlode mine poll booth away from the deposit box.
---
Why is that a bad thing?
---
Jolly R has always been my fav. Gnome Village Party is pretty lit too. 
---
Jagex is fucking stupid though. Make it 20 noted rannars but 10x more common and nobody would give a fuck.
---
Reddit just circlejerks the big drops idk how they didn't learn from revenants. 
---
RSN - Ironericc
---
Yeah I got those exact drops in 118 KC as well, pretty lucky. I’m keeping the dragon claw for now, not worth selling it for 60m when I’m thinking the lance will settle around 100m
---
What a VIRGIN
---
It is not a bad thing
---
Exactly, I think people shouldn't be so concerned about a super rare event. If, after a few weeks, there was still a noticeable drop in prices, you could decrease the amount on the DT, but right now so much confirmation bias is occupying threads.
---
you dont do mediums? i have every headband and duplicates from a bit over 300 meds
---
**efficiency** 
---
It doesn't need to be end game content, but it's mind-numblingly boring. I don't think having it start a different style would make it end game content. 
---
It requiring more effort than Vorkath isn't saying much; and even Vorkath has more inconsistency with the acid pools vs dead creepy crawly, first. This bosses only inconsistency is whether it will start with a range atk or mage... You literally don't need sharks at all if you do it perfectly.
---
Exactly, just because something doesn't seem super useful doesn't mean there can't be a use for it eventually...
---
What happened to him?
---
I was going to post this yesterday after thinking about it on the drive home from work lmao. This is gonna fuck with me for a while cause it was the first time I ever thought about it
---
“Feels stupid to get note planks”
---
Like why?  Why is it so weird to get huge supply drops.  Supply drops have been in the game since ever.  It’s not a “private server thing.”  I like how once people realized it’s not really that op in terms of gp/hr, they just started saying, “it’s just weird,” or “it’s so random.”  Like UHH? What is so random or hard to understand about a task-only common loot table that gives a nice little boost to the money you make on slayer tasks with one slayer master.
---
Also one thing to consider that might have buffed the initial results was everyone skipping tasks to get the good ones, since it’s scaled to the monster’s cb level.  Did several tasks under lvl 90 yesterday and didn’t get anything, not even a 50k drop.
---
I see that you made one of the rewards a fur bag which carries more fur, it could give people an incentive to grind out untradeable furs for the points to then make it more efficient. 
---
*What the heck?* **Everyone** is getting this pet! This is crashing the pet economy! Nerf Konar IMMEDIATELY Jumblex!
---
Me with your mom YHHEEEEET
---
1 guy showed he got the brew drop. 1. Stop it. Let us have a real fucking "Rare drop table" for once.
---
Sold it for 180k! 
---
While I think in principle it should be like this, what could they have as drops for mosters if its not made by a skill? If they removed all drops except from things like dragon items and rares, then doing activities like slayer would become extremely expensive. The only other option I see would be making all monsters drop only rares and coins, where the value of coin drops for higher level monsters goes up significantly. I just dont think there are enough low value items which do not come from skilling to change the drop table in any worthwhile way.
---
My point is that for one its completely safe and two that killing spiders and bears and earth warriors is shit xp. Konar will be the best master to use until you get up to the good levels. She isn't supposed to be the best slayer master in the game that everyone and their nan uses.
---
It’s purely an 85 hour grind for a cosmetic :)
---
Bloody hell 😂 sounds fun 😂 
---
I hope they paid you double time! 
---
The difference between the onyx bolts and straight Cash is that the onyx bolts also require nature runes in order to bring gold into the game.
---
This
---
no but I know way to many people with 2-3 accounts doing 8 of them a day, it surely would help make up for those players that aren't doing any of them
---
New Slayer Master drop table?
---
Yeah it's all chance at the end of the day, but I don't think it's too rare. I saw a bunch of people checking their Hespori patch progress during my herb runs 
---
It’s going to get nerfed. Reddit is in storm about how AMAZING it is. Even though jagex is one of the best in this sense, they are still completely out of touch. 
---
Which of the 3? Ill give it
---
Probably fell for a phishing scam
---
Every slayer master other than Turael and Krystilia have a requirement to use them.
---
sweet. how do I get to the new content place? where exactly is the quickest way with an account with very few requirements
---
I haven't seen anyone complaining about alchs from this update. The biggest issue I see is the herbs and complete turn around from their mentality over the past few months. They went from trying to remove/reduce some supply pvm drops to this. 
---
I think we can fix this by removing raw materials and items that people would normally purchase from the table. I have nothing against having a table of a few nice drops, but Jagex once again is screwing over the skillers in the game by offering drops of RM and consumables that could effect the economy.
---
The knee jerk reaction from this community is making me nauseous 😂
---
Didn't expect the osrs drama to be here as well.
---
Cmon, bruh. I like his streams, too, but who really “deserves” to have $73,000 just handed to him randomly for playing a video game?
---
THANK YOU FOR THIS INFO! I got a seed on my first seaweed run after the update and I was holding off on planting until I read a bit about it
---
Does DMM server allow you to select a name at the start?
---
Pretty sure it doesn't.  Something else fucky is going on.
---
I killed hespori its an easy boss just pray range and attack with rang or melee ( I did melee just a whip that is all). And bring 1 antidote
---
Maybe the ip can help ypu find who it was, prolly someone ypu or ypur friend knows.
---
127m xp by just fruit trees is a lot different than 127m xp by seaweed/cactus/Belladonna. Xp is a bad metric.
---
Yeah, a combat level requirement which konar also has. I dont see your point
---
You're angry and stupid
---
Do you think weed classifies as an 'average destructive drug'? 
---
1.5x and free food plus an extra paid vacation day.  
---
You should see the woodcutting guild
---
Realistically not a ton of people are going to go way out of their way to kill hydra, and id they do they will probably just skip their way to it
---
Someone came and chopped your oak bro
---
honestly what's the difference between 100 dragon platelegs (16,2m alch) and the Statuette worth 16m pure coins? At least the platelegs required 100 alchs, the statue is just instant 16m. Lol.
---
Anything worse than Twitch mods ?
---
I don't understand the point of this.  They did the same thing with Guardians. 
---
Long term 8 instances per world is going to be more than enough. It's not going to restrict the drops coming into the game. 
---
The only time it's going to affect anything is right now, when there's new-boss hype, which is going to quickly die down. 
---
OOTL?
---
Well first of all its on Zeah so if you havent been there before you would need to find your way there, I suggest using the osrs wiki, oldschool.runescape.wiki
---
New slayer master - https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten
---
Devalues my high level only ironman
---
Principality
---
If you're going to have an unpopular opinion to counter the popular opinion, you should at least characterize  the other side correctly.
---
People aren't complaining about Konar because it's too  "OP" in terms of too high gp/h, but because dropping 200+ noted herbs devalues skilling + lazy game design + makes the game look private-server-ish. 
---
Halloween all year!
---
Boots of stone look better even 
---
You can't just assume you think for the masses. Your utopia is boring.
---
Not a dmm server :/
---
that doesn't make any sense
---
Was sort of referring to that. Man, Jagex are fucking retarded.
---
THANK YOU!
---
I would like a good rare drop table, I don't want a crazy regular drop table. Jagex seems to be mixing those two up.
---
better yet put them all together into a new skill.
---
Those aren't nice things to say man
---
I felt the opposite when I tried iron. Progress is so much slower I felt like if I didnt play efficiently I would never get anywhere
---
It's because it's another drop table that makes Skilling less valuable. We have vorkath, Zulrah, etc. While the table isn't super broken it's another content that is dropping noted herbs. It's funny because Winterdot was nerfed really quickly (not saying it didn't need to be nerfed) but vorkath and Zulrah (well Zulrah was worse to be fair). My point is skillers get low priority and I understand pvm is more popular but perhaps Jagex can strike a compromise to avoid Skilling becoming more obsolete.
---
And make it multi
---
Fucking reddit crybabies smh
---
At the rate it took me to get to 2000, I’m guessing it will be another ten years or so
---
Book of spells my man
---
Just got a 1 mil drop from greater demons, 139 Ranarr. That's 1m from a once shitty task. A nerf seems to be needed if even greater demons are now considered good.
---
I got an extra 150k from dust devil thanks to her drop table. I fucking love this.
---
wouldnt mind this at all.
---
Ah fuck, will if it helps any I honestly didn't realise it'd been done before. Originality is dead rip 
---
Exactly, and its not like shes super amazing for money compared to something like smithing steel bars at blast furnace
---
I forgot my cat sheds everywhere because of its bad manners.
---
nah according to the hyper sweat ehp gods nieve is a bit better
---
Not at all if anything this is way less on the eco than alchable drops 
---
Plankkkkk
---
I had a hard clue that required it, so I dropped it. Next clue was an elite and required one as well. I received a new hard clue so I figured I'd try my luck for a bucket helm before dropping the elite. 5th step of hard clue required bucket helm. 
---
&gt;This game has become slayerscape, the only thing with good rewards is slayer and solo bosses so everything gets released is slayer and solo bosses, it's cyclical and it won't stop until everything good about this game is destroyed.
---
You just gonna pretend like raids don't exist or what? They have great rewards, aren't slayer, and aren't solo... so what exactly are you complaining about?
---
Iam angery!
---
Based on what exactly? 
---
Just for fun, let's assume this statement is true (which it isn't).
---
If people don't downvote as much as people upvote, where are the threads about why showing the poll results IS a good idea? This has been a relevant topic for months now and 33% of 303.000 subscribers is more than enough for a post to reach the frontpage.
---
You seem to imply that people just randomly upvote shit for the sake of upvoting shit. How come so many posts about hiding the poll results reach the frontpage?
---
Is being called mentally slow not reason enough for these no-voters lurking in the shadows to downvote this thread? Why do posts get downvoted at all?
---
You're grasping at straws at this point just to be a contrarian. Not sure what else to say.
---
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted, but okay. 
---
I think they intentionally used melee in the video to not spoil the method for killing it
---
Please explain what I am supposed to be looking at
---
i swear ive seen not very dated stuff (like less than a year) saying nieve is better
---
The only things you need to worry about are his initial attack when he spawns and his initial attack whenever he enters his last phase. Before his last phase, be KEEN on keeping count of how many times he has attacked with range or mage, and swapping every 3 times. The count carries over between phase changes. Start paying attention to when he does his special attacks too, as they're always at the same time too.
---
+2 str bonus and plus 4 to attack styles is almost the exact same upgrade as avernic to d def what do you mean
---
did 50 kc at boss, logged out of main went to farming guild on iron, loads of fun.
---
thank you, was looking for this.
---
Pretty much spot on with my thoughts on this one.
---
I'm glad Konar is profitable and I think it should stay that way, but I don't think skilling resources was the right reward to give, especially given the focus on making skilling resources come from skilling recently. 
---
PLEASE HOLY SHIT with farming contracts my bank is overflowing!!!!
---
Yea Duradel gave me a Wyrm task, and then directly after that he gave me a Drake task lol.
---
yeah, and duradel probably is better money, however it would be more intense.
---
You could literally do something else to make money or train
---
\- Farming, miscellania , herb boxes, flipping -&gt; all passive money makers
---
\- You could quest
---
\- You can train somewhere else at NMZ, crabs, bandits, 
---
\- you can make money While training as well 
---
So should I buy 1?
---
Pretty sure longbone is 1/5k so it’d be 2/10k which simplifies back to 1/5k.. 
---
Is there a req for it? Like can I take my iron in there just for the diary? 
---
I knew what smithing was before all of my other classmates in middle school purely because of runescape! Pretty cool!
---
at 2pm eastern a queue will open up in my discord. discord.gg/chymistry
---
simply post your runescape name in the queue when it's open
---
I take a lot of damage from not counting the three hits 
---
I have done over 9.5m slayer xp and have never gotten anything from superiors
---
he beat me too it. :p
---
simply post your runescape name in the queue when it's ope
---
Again, this is if you buy less amounts at once. You have to realize that the repeat customers for these sites are largely Sand Casino regulars/fanatics. These people are buying 500 mill at least usually each time. That goes for about $400 USD usually and good clients will get the $0.75 USD/mill treatment. They did rise a bit recently though so maybe $0.80 USD/mill is more fair for bulk(er) buys.
---
Real ni🅱️🅱️as know this card as F.G.D.
---
That's pretty scary tbh. I thought the lockout scaled with more failures. They REALLY need to up security measures soon, shame it's always ignored.
---
Could be a diary reward, Support
---
im sorry you had to wait so long hahaha more people showed up than i could deal with
---
If it makes you feel any better I smited an Elder Maul the other night and decided to leave it in the bank and lost nearly 2mil the next day
---
I had to get pked at earth warriors to do that dumbass quest
---
fair enough
---
exploring the world lmao
---
Except I'm maxed with a top page 200m and played for 14 years 
---
There are still many good few hundred k GP drops so i am fine with that!
---
Konar is worse than duradel for points though
---
Faux always complains about "ironman integrity" yet scouts out wildy on alts for his hcim and boosts emblems for his rune pouch lmao
---
I dont often browse this sub, just checking in and I see that alot of people saying it nerfs gp for lower/mid lvls. I'm just curious how did this update effect them making money? Doesnt the boss require 95 slayer? :s
---
You know what? Keep talking Serene. I agree with you.
---
Faux receives too much praise. Quite egotistical, doesnt seem to have time for anything in the game unless it has his approval.  Go back to the army bruh
---
duradel is better xp/task and better loot/task following this nerf. The only reason to do konar now is the points and that defeats the entire point of wildy slayer.
---
Not to mention the best non-wildy master for slayer points.
---
Looks like streamers got their way.. yet again. 
---
RIP Konar
---
Why come on to chat forums to act like a little boy? Why talk about someone sucking off their own father? You have serious mental issues. I would highly advise you to visit a medical professional for help. 
---
Better tasks, probably better pts/hr because you can do the best methods for each monster, and better drops on those tasks (eg. getting kurasks tasks and doing them quickly is better than doing all of konars shit tasks for KDT).
---
Went to reddit about to make this post and this the first thing i see
---
Lets make new content then nerf it into oblivion so nobody uses it anymore! Fucking idiots. 
---
Yeah it'd be a 2m cash drop every 100 tasks, but what about the tasks in between, the 100k cash stack drops that you get \~100 KILLS.  That adds up and fast.  Now multiply that by everyone doing those runs.  I would much rather have 2m in ranarrs drop over 2m in cash.  Thats not really healthy for anything in the long run.  2m in ranarrs effects farming, 2m in cash effects everything.
---
The knee jerk reaction in this community makes me sick. If this was the case, we might as well nerf/re-balance Hydra pet rates just because we see some lucky person getting 1KC pet??????
---
My biggest criticism of him was that to my knowledge, he never actually even tried Konar tasks himself (beyond for hydra) to get an idea of what it is actually like outside of Reddit
---
items usually don't go below their alch value, especially the expensive ones
---
so essentially its going to become coins at one point or other
---
That sucks. I played 12 hours yesterday and never had more fun than with the new global drops. At least leave some high value drops even if they were more rare than before, or even if they are just like 2m coins. 
---
Yes and herbs will lower the prices of herbs and seeds. Not everyone plants the seeds they get as drops.
---
This has been said multiple times, but Konar was shite xp, only reason to do it was for the loot table. Going back to duradel as well.
---
Considering how rare 200 herbs is, and that 200 ranarrs would only equate to 17k herb xp on my ironman, it isn't a lot of progress for how rare the drop is.
---
It's like these people who were complaining don't realize that they'll be able to find worlds a lot quicker with people spread out throughout the map.... 
---
It's a win win situation for everyone!
---
Maybe put a higher slayer level requirement on Konar.  That'd be the only TRUE change I'd make. 
---
Was screenshotting and bragging about it on discord servers, the boss respawned and killed me. When I looked back after getting pet i was in fally
---
price doesn't matter, it's mostly about not destroying people who skill for money sometimes
---
If you give seeds they can still farm herbs
---
if you give insane herbs then farming becomes pointless
---
mystic set is a fuckin joke lmao its 2019 who the fuck uses mystic
---
I'll be using Konar until nerf then back to Duradel. 
---
Sarcasm
---
Well said
---
Most certainly is.
---
And you are whining about him whining about whiners. In turn I am whining about you whining about him whining about whiners. Too much whining. 
---
It's true, they balanced dmm around streamers and now the streamers don't even play it anymore.
---
"Konar's Unique table is accessed at a rate of 1/100 for level 100 NPCs and 1/50 for level 350 NPCs"
---
Seems like the dude who reported 20 rolls in 500k slayer xp in that frontpage thread got pretty unlucky... :-(
---
Because she is in a location that is not convenient to get to and gives tasks people don't want
---
 It’s shit now . Duradel is better again since it’s More Xp and you can choose where to do your task . 
---
Yeah, Faux doesn’t realize that not many people, especially his Ironman community, can grind like he does. He fucked up a really good thing for iron men.
---
All he did was look at clips and pictures and never tried it himself before voicing his opinion. He's an idiot.
---
Gambling activities as a whole, using the *gambler's fallacy* into their own advantage. The average person is pretty much slightly irrational and likes to gamble, so there's always gonna be systems in place "abusing" these people as long as it isn't straight up illegal. Present in every corner of society.
---
Only 4 days? Damn better than I thought. Thank you.
---
Maybe look at it on a per-monster basis?  
---
For cannoning the drops were too good, but a bunch of monsters surely could use the extra bonus.
---
redditors, this is how you make dead content.. There was no need for a nerf.. Back to duradel.. Hello darkness my old friend..
---
Yep. I'm a casual player (full time job) and I feel like this game isn't for me. Thanks guys
---
As an ironman you already have more than enough incentives to do slayer though..
---
did about 15 tasks and only thing i got was 81 mahogany's 
---
&gt;for lower levels 
---
pls don't talk about army he doesn't like talking about it
---
\*starts talking about army\*
---
Oh well then I’d overestimated Jagex..
---
Imagine. Having the audacity to complain about a drop table when he is camping Hydra boss all day long 24/7. POS.
---
need some /s in these hostile times
---
if they add alchs they need to remove arena tax
---
Once again jagex fucks it up. 
---
Right but you're probably high combat with blowpipe and you destroy them quickly. Which, at that point you could do any boss and make similar amounts? 
---
Revs for lower levels means getting stacked by maxed salad robe pkers ~80 combat. It's not great GP hour when most of the hour is spent re-gearing and teleporting back 
---
thats cos youre still thinking about efficiency 
---
Low levels will have to skip a ton of tasks because of location.
---
I'd recommend GWD, callisto, venenatis and KBD if you got 2 people and also like money to some extent.
---
How have you already gotten 500k slayer xp in one day?
---
well i mean putting skilling supplies in drop tables is bad, because we need to chop trees or else the environment will die, also putting alchables is bad, so the only thing left are uniques, i say konar just gives you a random unique boss item whenever you hit the table, and a super rare chance at 100 noted bandos tassets, now pvm works.
---
300k drops are fine, 2m+ ( in resources are not). I'm fine with something like the hasta drop though. 
---
Shit, id kill my brother for 50k
---
What I liked about the first drop table was that the rare high value drops made slaying more exciting. With just mediocre drops there is less dopamine to be had.
---
Disappointing. 
---
RS mods; "heres a new cool thing!"  
---
Players; "holy shit this is fun!"  
---
RS mods; "no fun."
---
Players; "oh ok."
---
Back to Duradel. I'm not a low/mid level player and even I think this is absolutely ridiculous to nerf the one thing that made not only Konar, but low/mid level slayer even remotely interesting. 
---
Jagex, you have failed miserably yet again.
---
They straight up said all this time that Konar would assign tasks in specific areas and that this bonus drop table would be the benefit of choosing those restrictions. If you don't want to kill a monster in an assigned place, then choose literally any other slayer master.
---
Yes daddy inject more alchables into me pls 
---
He didn't even have to eat this one.
---
mhmmm
---
loving all the tears in this thread
---
this is unfair it seems that faux was screaming and boom drastic changes i agress changes to the herbs but you can keep the rest of the drops like they were adding uniques is a cool idea as well depending on the unique this fix is way too extreme i did many task barely hit the loot table at all. this is not cool
---
It's 200 prayer pots you did nothing to earn.
---
Everyone hated the brews drop even though it was crazy low chance.
---
It is a fucking joke. Faux tweeted shit and it got changed lol.
---
Dead content.
---
combat requirement doesnt matter though. look at wildy slay for example, look at nieve pre catacombs. cb req != quality
---
I haven’t had to skip a single area in any of my tasks. 
---
You can put those in your house
---
Good lord people... 
---
They already said the drops will be of the same value. Just different items. Relax kid. 
---
Uh, no, it's like if you sold someone full rune, but you scammed it off someone else first. The end buyer doesn't give a shit.
---
That was my point
---
Miscellania and monster drops give herbs. Monster herb drops predate the farming skill.
---
Let’s start nerfing some of the raid drop tables, they make way too much money
---
Cry more baby dick

I think that the community disliked the presence of massive singular drops of resources. I don't think they disliked the flow of resources though, nor their average value, the complaints were made prior to people understanding their frequency.
---
Herb drops are very much a part of combat, and replacing them with seeds isn't necessary. If instead you removed those huge drops entirely, and replaced them with drops of single unnoted bonus herbs (keeping the average herbs coming in from her table the same) it would be a lot more palatable. 
---
I'm posting to let my disagreement be known. Reasoning found in other users posts. Just adding numbers to the crowd.
---
it doesnt take long to get the slayer lvl for nieve, so lower levels is a waste of time.
---
the highest drop acutally would be the cele seeds, I sold 5 of them 4 mins after the update for 4m each, pretty sure
---
'In response to your feedback'...
---
Did i miss something to Questioner or a poll? ... Ohh Well woopies...
---
It’s shit for everyone now you can choose to just do cannon task to get to high levels instead of grinding slowly with Konar . 
---
This. The loot table was fine most people making maybe 200k extra per task. Konar is dead now good job faux you fucking idiot 
---
&gt;  99.9% of the community don't have the privilege of playing the game for a living where you can grind everything.
---
This isn't an argument to create ezscape updates. We don't want another RS3 flooded with devaluations and zero satisfaction after reaching an "achievement". RS should require a grind-esque mindset and a lot of time in order to succeed, that's the nature of it. Pandering to casual users claiming it's too "difficult" is gonna result in negative outcomes from a long term's perspective. Well-documented fact.
---
Annoyed that these streamers that are able to play for 12 hours a day have a say over everyone. This was great for someone like me that is in the 60s for stayer and was able to make some gp from it. I did 3 tasks and got 5000 earth runes... i think people that complained didn't even try it out themselves.
---
If my screen is off and the game is minimized, then no it's not active.
---
It's literally the same thing as if you had one of those idle games like clash of clans mining gems for you in the background or something 
---
I dont know. I still think having one skill that basically leeches off the other skills to train is kind of dumb. Adding contracts or something similar to the guilds I think would be a better implementation of some of the concepts. The way artisan was set up you would be practically required to train it first for efficency purposes, effectively tying all of the artisan skills together. Splitting things up and attaching them to their respective guilds would allow for more individual balance and keeps the skills seperated.
---
some of us have to work and dont play 23 hours a day.. dead content jagex. listen to the 90% of the playerbase.
---
I did 12 konar tasks yesterday and the best drop I got was yew logs you got lucky.
---
Not really digging the mystic but RIP Konar back to Duradel!
---
Seriously it's insane how quickly they jumped the gun and just decided to change it without even performing a single poll.
---
Nothing seems wrong here.
---
Yes, that may be the option I go for.
---
Me Faux Me big muscles Me not so big brain. Me complain.
---
[Suggestion]: implement a ~4 hour rollback so you can rethink this "fix" and don't fuck it up again
---
currently at 1k ven kills and afked all of them with no pkers killing me but thank tell me again.
---
Bored of Jagex making idiotic choice's like this,. Don't release content without checking it? this has happend EVERY time something has been released,. it's nothing new,. and it will always happen again,. The table was fine,. Now its pointless ,. The only reason that master is now good after this "re-release" of this content is the points.. CUNTS
---
Idk really how to feel about this. I want really good drops to be available, but should just be at a very low percentage drop rate. Why is that so hard?
---
They said it on the dev stream. Not fishy at all. 
---
The poison attack is always the 4th attack on the first and final phases, btw. 
---
What did Faux do? Might have missed something here
---
Don’t nerf the drop table, nerf the amount of slayer points she gives. This will still keep her worth using for people who want the supplies at the sacrifice of task efficiency and points. For those who do no prioritize the drops but want point/ efficiency they can go back to durradaddy!
---
This Konar drop table was actually the only reason why I ever went back to Slayer. The skill is extremely boring, and this at least brought some interest factor into it. 
---

---
Use this to check, usually prices are pretty consistent but sometimes you can actually profit from prayer potions and such. 
---
waste of time, not worth the xp hit 
---
New table still looks fine for Ironman honestly, but I'd sure like my Rannar drop before the update.
---
The whiny content creators that Jagex lives to serve are to blame as well
---
I think you missed the point I’m on your side...
---
you're
---
Oh you're correct, so slight error in the 1/100 number in the title. Although, that number would be pretty consistent with my testing in game anyway.
---
T-20 minutes until coldfix is in effect.  
---
Better be polled. 
---
yes, new herb patch
---
dead content because you cant pull 1m+ in resources for no effort, fuck out of here you lazy spastic 
---
I haven’t done normal slayer with konar yet so I can’t say with experience like you, just with images from Reddit and seeing the drops on the table it feels op to me, think about it from an Ironmans view, it’s a shitload of materials, and you weren’t the only one doing slayer, loads of lads were doing it and I believe torstols had dropped a hefty amount twelve hours ago. It just feels rushed, and very bad to me. 
---
Konar gives 3 more points, 5 more points with the elite diary I think. Probably a lot of faster tasks too. I skipped tasks to get hydras and got what seemed to be some extremely easy tasks that I could have breezed through in a matter of minutes so he seemed very good for points if you need them.
---
Are you a low lvl Ironman ?
---
just make a slayer master that assigns you trees and they have a chance of dropping birdnests which will always contain a zamorakian godsword 100% of the time.
---
Definitely not worth the time anymore. I did 4 tasks yesterday, hit thr table once for rune bolts, gingerbeardie hit it like 3 times on a kraken task and only got fire runes.its almost like... those herb drops are rare or something man 
---
Uhh...
---
A few lucky people post their drops and everyone gets triggered over MUH BANK VALUE AND DEFLATION. Konar is a nice alternative to slamming your face against the monsters Duradel gives you in the same locations weve been going to forever.  Reducing the value of the RDT reduces the incentive to use such a fun alternative. Why not talk to us before you all do such a kneejerk change? Polls are a thing you know.
---
Agreed, why bother doing some shit task like jellies or dust devils inside the dungeon outside Pollnivneach for garbage drops when you can go get better tasks from nieve or duradel and get decent drops and kill them where you please. 
---
hydra = deadcontent? 
---
k
---
If it wasn't such a major drop why are you crying about the original drops?
---
All the jokes and complaints aside please, I beg of you... Do not do this. A few players getting some high tier drops quickly after rushing the new content isn't cause for this. You're just punishing players.
---
Dude the issue isn't people whining about the konar table. If you really believe *this nerf* is what sent you back to duradel then you don't know what you're doing anyway. Konar was *always* dead content with the exception of being assigned hydra. They would have to quadruple the pre-nerf drop table to make her even somewhat compete with duradel. 
---
thats not what 'mutually exclusive' means
---
You mean right next to a fairy ring and the blessing teleport ? 
---
I had fun with runescape in a while but obviously here comes those 99 slayer mofos crying about how they CANT HAVE low/med level slayer earn gp until you get to high level slayer. Fuck you and your life without social interaction 
---
By that logic, RS3 and OSRS are the same difficulty, one just "takes longer"

---
So what you’re saying is...you have no idea what you’re taking about with your 68 slayer. 
---
It WAS good for low levels like you, not so much anymore. Yesterday was a result of a massive amount of people going to try the new slayer master resulting in what was still not a great amount of people getting 2m herb drops or the like, that was a still very much a MINORITY of people doing slay. It was selection bias AT ITS FINEST. And yet somehow Jagex couldn’t see through that selection bias or just wanted to appease their fan base like they always do like a spoiled child of a rich parent who gives their kid everything. 
---
At best they should have only adjusted how many herbs were drop very slightly. Remember you need to not only actually hit the RDT roll but then also hit one of the rarer, more expensive drops like the herbs that have the lowest weighting. That keeps getting them as drops quite a rare occurrence, but people were using examples of a few people getting really good RNG getting multiple of those drops on a single task as evidence that it needed to be fixed which is incredibly flawed logic since there were plenty of people who had not had 2 of those drops across many tasks. Should we also nerf people who did Hydra and got pet on 10 KC and then claw and then leather all within 100 kc? No, because that’s just really good RNG that is very rare to occur and it would be retarded to do so. Same exact thing applies to the RDT.  
---
No. He's establishing a traditional view of the game. We don't need another RS3 carbon copy. 
---
Thanks. I hear there are 9 patches in the game now though, harmony being the 6th, weiss 7th and farm guild 8th, what is 9th? 
---
just to appease the vocal minority.....:/
---
Giving me some tralfamadorians from slaughter house five vibe, great OC!
---
So, I'm currently lvl 72 CB. I have the means to make a ton of ppots, but do you think it's best to just stick with Zanaris until 85 and not bother with Konar?
---
Good to hear! Glad that worked out for you.
---
&gt;Konar's Unique table is accessed at a rate of 1/100 for level 100 NPCs and 1/50 for level 350 NPCs. This contains the broken Dragon hasta.
---
The Op is saying the Konar Table is 1 in 100 from a Level 100, but that was the Konar Unique Table with the Dragon Hasta. Also, the OP put the Fish in wrong.
---
Dont complain about loss if you do all task 100% efficient u mong
---
Not disagreeing that its rare or shady but Sick\_Nerd has been getting a lot more than 500 viewers on average.
---
Thing is, Even this update is better if you are higher level with a 1/100 roll chance on 100 combat enemies and 1/50 on 350 the higher level you are the better off you are. You kill things faster therefore you get rolls more frequent. Any end game account complaining about this content that have actually done the tasks themselves are experiencing different drop rates than low/mid level players.
---
Honestly it's complete nonsense that a 75cb slayer master can give hydra, most points in game, and tons of gp just for going to different locations
---
Making tons of gp just 'extra gp' and people think it's the end of the world. Alright. Go back to Chaeldar and waste more time getting slay helm w/out even getting the Konar drops
---
This is a temporary nerf too, but nobody read the article. They'll likely balance this w/ a buff after metrics come in instead of killing the economy even more with the OP drop table
---
She has dog shit xp rates. If you were doing slayer for money before the sonar update you were a scrub.
---
HUUUUGE FUCKING NERF.
---
There is a balance to be found between a table containing drops worth ~2m of skilling materials each, and a table with some crap alchables with seed drops that are worth about 1/10th as much at most. I hope we can find that balance. I don't think calling each other 'autistic' and 'whining pussies' is the way to get there.
---
Except things like RC I guess
---
Considering you can go straight from low-med lvl to high lvl in a couple of months of a few hours play a day, why would anyone care about low lvl content? Jagex should not cater towards people that only play an hour a day. It's just not the game for you. 
---
Back to your old slayer masters bois. 
---
Good. Slayer shouldn't give as much money as PVM, especially since this loot table hurts skillers directly.
---
Average value doesn't mean medium drops.  It means that if you rolled her loot table a million times pre-nerf, and a million times post nerf, you'd get (approximately) 30% less stuff post nerf.
---
Thanks for ruining my Game Experience because you listen to Cry babies Like faux and other streamers and high end pvmers only
---
Probably not, but it still doesn't change that the title is incorrect.
---
Yeah... but like... individual drops or notes of 10 max.
---
Not 198 Torstols, which is quite different.
---
People barking the loudest are the ones screeching about a 30% nerf
---
Reddit hive mind and whiny content creators win again
---
I'm glad Jagex took into account the feedback given about the fear of the drop table affecting the prices of the items on the drop table. Shows they do care about the balance of the game despite them only doing it after community backlash.
---
Bit hyperbolic to say slayer will be dead to you though. Slayer is already massively profitable above 70/75 slayer. If at this point you still don't consider slayer worth your time then you simply don't enjoy slayer. 
---
keep not playing this game retard
---
I think slayermusiq should become the new a friend. Start making videos like the old a friend used to
---
I knew they were going to nerf it, they pay too much attention to twitch and Reddit.
---
Ask the community as a whole, the nerf was too much, 2500 brews as a mega rare drop, something equivalent to getting a dragon chainbody from a dust devil would have been fine.
---
Have the table as it was just increase the drop rates.
---
He saw a couple people here post(out of 303k subs) ultra rare drops on the new drop table and cried all day yesterday on twitch and twitter on how its overpowered. The dude never went out and actually tried and tried to realize its RARE to get a RARE drop. 
---
Get with the times idiot.  Skulking outside of quest/diary/clue reqs is obsolete.  Get over it and start bossing and raiding. 
---
Its really not just few lucky OPs, I am pretty sure majority of the drops dont get posted here. Even atleast 5 members in my cc alone have gotten the massive herb drops in only one day.
---
And I don't see why no one would use the new slayer master anymore. She gives the best points outside wildy and even has smaller requirements than duradel. Also even after the nerf she will still give very profitable bonuses.
---
It means that we shouldn't implement an inflated amount of unnecessary content just for the sake of mass-producing content. Preserve the original OSRS aspects instead of developing the game onto the wrong direction into a pserver-copy.
---
And just give it some time to see how people feel about the table after a few days. Like this, you'll get into that nerfing-buffing cycle again
---
the drop table is kinda unbalanced and so if the update stays too long prices of certain items will crash or rise bye big numbers that's why they kinda should nerf it. 
---
Yeah I got maybe 200k extra loot over 5 tasks last night. Having a couple jackpot rolls isn't the end of the world when bosses shit out 3m+ an hour in other supplies. If people really care about the way that money comes into the game just turn it into alchables idk.

---
This is so incredibly disappointing. The adjusted drop table is not even close to the rewards of the original and instead it's a bunch of generic items like rune armor pieces and a couple of Ranarr seeds. Woopty-fucking-doo. I was having a blast doing tasks like Kurasks and Bloodvelds with the chance of getting a rare drop that MAY be worth 100-200K, maybe even a mil if I was lucky. 
---
Instead we're getting fishing levels tied to slayer drops  and the rarest drops on the table nerfed down to 10% of the originals...from yesterday... 24 hours ago.   
---
Fucking Reddit.
---
Grats beast!
---
"Funny how 5 years ago everyone hated something but 5 years later people like an aspect of that thing like wtf why isnt reddit one person"
---
Well, thanks for ruining something fun.
---
Well you stated 200m xp earlier. That doesn't necessarily dictate 16hrs a day for who knows how long. As an analogy, I've played dota 2 for about 4K hours and another friend of mine has for 7k. Neither of us has played 16hrs a day except on extraordinary occasions. Someone getting 200m xp is not a sign of addiction or any mental illness. 
---
Right? I'm killing Black Demons in Brimhaven Dungeon right now, I haven't said that phrase in like 10 years.
---
Yeah idk what drugs these people are smoking. I keep seeing people saying, "Finally Slayer has some good drops." They must be living on another planet. People just want to afk easy tasks and get 2 mil. 
---
no, because you just said that the odds of getting two drops back to back is the same as getting one drop
---
shut the fuck up Serene 
---
God forbid that streamers have their own opinions on the game. They're human just like you and me you know.
---
chad funscape does

ironman-free worlds plz

The unique table isn't shown. From the newspost: "Konar's Unique table is accessed at a rate of 1/100 for level 100 NPCs and 1/50 for level 350 NPCs. This contains the broken Dragon hasta and used to contain 2,500 Saradomin brews which were removed shortly after the update."
---
The OP is saying Konar's normal drop table is the same as the Unique Table, which is not the case.
---
Exactly. This is why people do skull-tricking too to lure people in wildy/pvp worlds. It's all about picking your fights to hedge your bets. 
---
This is the same as Skotizo pet release, everyone thought the droprate was too high.
---
If you check the jug it let's you empty it.

it is weird because why tf is a dog carrying 200 noted planks around

fuck me for wanting something more fun and diverse than duradel / nieve right?

Also, nieve and duradel are shit for money unless you're really high slayer.
---
Fuck off you hateful bigot

I didn't even think about that but you're right

Shut up serene

ye but the 10% who live on this game got what they wanted and the 90% don’t.

---
2.5k Brews as a drop, no matter how rare, is dumb as shit. I don't mind the value of the drop, just not the contents of it.
---
You could always just play a reg account and not think about eff
---
Bump
---
You are using konar who specifically chooses where you kill them. That's the point of konar.
---
Fuck you guys

---
/r/wallstreetbets is that way bud
---
Yes. They make your plants grow more for 3.5 days and then you need to plant more
---
What's RDT?
---
Counts as both for slayer tasks IIRC.
---
The drop table isn't really a big deal, but the argument "it's rare so it's balanced" is completely braindead. Make a lvl-2 goblin drop full bandos, but it's one in a million drop rate so it's balanced! Nobody is entitled to boss loot from simple slayer mobs. 
---
If anything, the loot table just makes Jagex look silly and takes away from their hard work. Unlucky. Liked some of the new ideas coming in with Kebos. The Hydra mechanics that weren't recycled (chemical fountains, phase change as heads were lost) were well done. Good attempt with trying new things. 
---
Bad luck 
---
There is definitely a middle ground; the issue is getting there. I don't like how the minority is the most vocal and driving the new content in the game (minority being strongly one sided in either direction). Jagex has made it clear that they are looking to continually alter this drop table as needed, but I think it's clear that the new drop table is not solving the problem of the old rare drop table. The old table obviously has the problem of introducing way too many herbs into the game, and I get that. I just hate seeing everything go to alchables and coins that are so common in intermediate level slayer.
---
While I disagree with the latest changes, this isn't really an argument for anything. By this logic, no one can complain about anything because someone spent time making it.
---
Level 3 skillets limit themselves to begin with no?
---
Pretty sure this is a repost, and I still don’t get the joke. And I refuse to google the lyrics
---
Did you miss the part where the Diary already offers a teleport closer to the Dungeon? Teleporting near the dungeon, skipping the Fairy Ring and shortcut, and then saving down 7 seconds inside would have a notable impact on how quick you could get to the boss. Players already POH tele for restore between Sire Kills and that is a decent trek and they intentionally made the Hydra further from a tele to prevent the same thing from happening.
---
Still can't do zammy lol. I have 4k brews banked. 
---
I killed over 2k worth of monsters yesterday from Konar and I hit the table TWICE, 5k fire runes and 5k air runes, of the several people I talked to yesterday in game none of them got anything crazy either. This is a huge over reaction, when a larger than normal amount of players are doing the same content you're going to see a larger than normal amount of super rare drops. The reality is these were rare drops and they added a cool incentive to slay in a different way and its a shame to see them go based on pure speculation and inflated day 1 numbers. 
---
Listening to a vocal minority with some people that hadn’t even played the content and rushing out a nerf less than 24 hours later is more important than polling the player base or making informed decisions.
---
It's reduced by 30%, on 1m+ drops, it's not a lot
---
I'd love to see 200-400 charged orbs (any kind). I hate making them on my btw, and they would make some good profit for non-btws too.
---
I dont like giving skilling materials for mindless slayer tasks. why not money so theres a reason to skill?
---
Yeah, I'm fully aware. Pet update and Iban Staff update didn't help it either. Thanks anyway. I was just waiting for a response from the guy who tried to prove a point thinking Wintertodt having a 1/10000 chance to drop a dragon axe crashed the price only to have his point explode in his face.
---
You killing hydra on mobile? Sounds like a pain
---
Oh boy
---
stop listening to retard streamers the drop table is literally fine. 
---
DO NOT NERF... The update gave new life to slayer. They main enjoyment of this game for most people is knowing that when fighting certain creatures you could get a great drop. It makes doing the menial tasks worth it. 
---
I am 96 slayer and the money is still shit unless you mean doing vorkath in place of blue dragons, which is so boring I want to die.
---
I did this just last night without any trouble. Are you sure you're making a coif and not a cowl?
---
Fuck everyone involved, especially faux.
---
Better?
---
Curry is the recurrent current currency. 
---
she's still better to do than nieve, but i understand you rs3 players like your op drop tables.
---
God I hate how his videos still show up on recommendations. Every time I instantly hide his videos ahd hide all from his channel and yet they still show up
---
shit take shit meme 
---
Except you're comparing actively doing konar slayer vs actively doing abby specs. In reality it's just doing slayer (exactly the same as you did before) but now you get a bonus for being special.
---
&gt; Nobody is handing anybody anything for free
---
It's literally the same thing you would've done but an addition to it
---
The game shouldn't be changed just because people don't have as much time to play as others. If everyone agreed with that we'd be getting double xp weekends, huge skilling buffs and drop table buffs which wouldnt be heathly for the game in the long run.
---
Yeah but you have to waste a shit ton of time doing inefficient slayer in order to get a hydra task
---
fun in osrs omegalul, all about efficiency 
---
Everyone had there strong points and weak points, your good with numbers, have awful people skills though. I’d probably be a lot smarter to if I didn’t have friends and just sat home. If you need a friend let me know, I’m here for you, friend :)
---
A little late to be learning that imo. More likely a 4 year old still using colorful placemats at the dinner table 
---
At least you can do Sire on that task if you are so inclined
---
Are you retarded? Everyone who stops for a second just to think about it sees how flawed Konar was/is.
---
I'm sure they know what they were doing. J-Mod are no different from any other trolls out there. 
---
That drop was likely deliberate.
---
It's not going to be dead content.
---
It gives the highest slayer points of any master outside the wilderness.
---
That is enough of an incentive.
---
That means they should fix drop tables of slayer monsters like blood velds. That doesn't mean an external slayer master should make them drop tons of skilling supplies.
---
I think it's fine as is, value wise anyway.
---
Change the Herbs &amp; supplies for other stuff. 
---
Shoot are they rare? I've checked one thing (tree) since the update and got one from that..
---
Damn guess I missed out while it was good I did 10 full tasks last night didn’t get shit. Don’t see why everyone is whining if the drops are so rare
---
Been spending alot of points cancelling tasks from Konar lately because i hate the location, wouldnt mind spending some points to change the location, might make konar slightly less annoying
---
Yep. All the rich maxed out people throw a fit and destroy fun content almost immediately. RIP.
---
Did you have a stroke while writing this?
---
Higher weighted tasks that make good money with fewer and lower-weighted tasks that suck.
---
you missed out on a lot my brother RIP
---
Support 
---
Doesn't matter, PvM shouldn't be dropping Skilling resources
---
shes the best master to go for your 10th task for points and the only one who can give you hydra as a task. far from dead content even without any unique drops
---
Does this have any relationship with binomial distribution
---
ITT: Kids that didn't even read the update.
---
Gunna have to disagree with the slayer level change. She's a wonderful master for mid level players which the game really did need. 
---
&gt; he is referred to as an idiot and wasting his money.
---
Haven't seen anyone say anything close? Maybe for other titty streamers (i.e. "Lmao what idiot donated $10k to a tity streamer") but who's ragging on this donation?
---
Lol so faux complains about slayer but does this boss the entire time. Good job faux 
---
It's not even an opinion. If you don't understand what he's saying then do what you never do and shut the fuck up, Serene.
---
going to preorder KH3 from EB Games before I do Duradel slayer tasks since Konar is over.
---
Pretty sure this required more effort than simply just cannoning tasks but sure, whatever. 
---
Oh i think you misunderstand, they meant that part about suggestions and opinions on the new table for content creators only.
---
GUYS! They want and are trying to balance her! Stop reeeeeing! Instead give good feedback so this wont become dead content because seeing people slay at so many places is fucking awesome!!!
---
faux, runescape's #1 crybaby
---
Woah. I honestly can't believe that you willingly made this dead fucking content...
---
Average value: what it was before  
---
max value: ~1 mill  
---
There are A LOT of trade offs for using konar, such as not always being able to do most bosses in lieu of the monster you were assigned (DKs instead of Dagannoths, for example), so I think the drop table will need multiple iterations to get right for the inherit trade offs involved.
---
The real point was that the drops were dumb to begin with. This was way way way more serious than the rev caves drop table.
---
No, the tasks are not faster at all.

Rare drop table. Some monsters have a chance to all roll on a rare drop table
---
Keep talking, Serene
---
i used full armadyl with a tbow. so i used 2 pray sips every kill… i can do it with take no dammage at all on this point
---
I'll still be using Konar. Her extra drops + the additional variety in locations is fun to me. I don't even think the average drop is changing much in value. It seems to primarily be the rare drops that have been changed the most. So I think in that aspect people are upset they no longer can get a lucky 2m drop for killing Hellhounds or something.
---
Anyone know if the alchemical hydra can give drops from the konar loot table?
---
Got 160 torstol with 2 minutes to spare 
---
so what about the higher cmb lvl nieve/steve?
---
Already been posted on this sub-reddit. 
---
No but calling out to someone to have a illness like this without knowing them makes me think less about you.  
---
can i get a ree
---
No! I've only done 1 task with konar and haven't even finished it. Damn
---
They don't poll balancing changes. It is usually done based on feedback, as they are doing now.
---
You didn't read the entire update. 
---
but duradel cant give alchemical hydra tasks. Also konar can give a generic boss task that lets you do vorkath.
---
also removed
---
No one is asking for that.  Giving medium level players a tiny chance for an epic drop is not a bad thing.  It encourages more grinding. 
---
Yeah ifkr. That'd honestly balance PvM completely. The whole point of iconic PvM duch as GWD and DKS being placed in remote areas was to punish death.
---
It's just better to not put yourself in that position regardless of the trust. It feels great to have someone to trust, I know. It feels great that he'd trust me with 1b+, and it feels great for me to return the items after I'm done using them. 
---
You're just too vulnerable, however. Better to be safe than sorry.  Just say no. If he stops being your friend because of that, then he was never your friend. Did you report him on RSJ? 
---
I did link him. 
---
Just a thought, but why does the drop table have to be completely filled with items to make money off of? Get creative and think outside the box, what about some non-tradeables like weapons + armor for the different combat styles that give bonus damage on task and make it so some of us actually take off our slayer helms for the first time in years? Make it so the new items decay that way you'll want to keep doing tasks with Konar in order to keep the items in supply for when they eventually run out of use.
---
Literally just the first thought that came to mind and I folded out on it while I was typing it. Not everything has to be monetary to be rewarding content.
---
Yeah buy some bonds to pay for my membership and stop complaining 
---
You sure about that ? Currently it is 2pm est on a Friday. There are currently over 100k people online. Most people who play this game probably don't have a full time job
---
I have been thinking this about Faux too, the worst part is he is just thinking about the value of his Ironman.
---
my bad, the term I was looking for was independent. Thanks for pointing that out. It didn't seem like the correct word but I was on my way to lunch and didn't double check it
---
then don't play? 
---
all games are a waste of time, some more than others. i never understood this "shame" associated with playing runescape, or being efficient in it.
---
no one cares if some kid plays fortnite or league for 40 hours straight but "omg bro u got 63 runecrafting lol fucking nerd how does it feel to have never felt a woman's touch, please die" "use those runes to alch yourself virgin"
---
But you probably also got some of the monster specific drops too so you didn't really lose any money. You just didn't make as much as you wanted to.
---
&gt; Or you play 3-5 hours a day over 5 years like 95% of the "higher level" community lmao. All you new players coming in and thinking that you deserve hand outs simply because you have a fucking job are idiots. If you're that strapped for cash buy a fucking bond. 
---
this^ 
---
so the game which is literally based on grinding is suddenly “not for you” after 13 years because it’s suddenly too grindy? 🤔
---
To clarify, I think that contradiction is an error in the design of the slayer master. It is confused in being a low-mid tier master, while at the same time thinking it is a high level master. They could have chosen better drops than the ones they went with for the RDT.
---
If what they were aiming for was for this to be a high level master (which the Hydra suggests), then it would be a large amount of these resources entering the game. As a low-mid tier master, I suppose it isn't quite so bad. Either way, it seems like it isn't fully what this master needs. I would prefer them just being alchables or something entirely different personally.
---
Well said. Now we’ve gotta wait another week/week and a half to play the content we were supposed to get on the 10th
---
It takes nothing but common sense to come to the conclusion that a 2m drop from mid level creatures is rare. 
---
A little because I seriously hate Konar’s ugly ass character model with her gangly fingers and stupid fucking millennial haircut. 
---
''more like runescape'' i think ur playing the wrong version buddy. stick to rs3 if u want ridiculous amounts of loots from doing nothing
---
Seeds should come from thieving and herbs should come from farming.
---
10000 people doing Konar slayer is a very high estimate, maybe for the first few hours after launch but not even close now.
---
What did you grind for your medium scroll drops? Haven't found anything i enjoy yet
---
50 would be a find drop imo. 
---
50 torstol 75 ranarr and snap or something
---
haha you too!!
---
english isn't my native language so i couldn't find the right words sometimes and how you just said it is exactly what it was/is, artificial inflation of big drops because of the popularity of the update. 
---
i like to look at all sides at all times so im gonna honestly say that i understand and hear the skillers, ironmen/women and even the rich people. but i'd urge them to also look at all sides and see the side of the lower leveled players, newer players, poorer players,... i have a 30m bank and seeing that its possible of getting a good drop actually worth more then 2k at a time from doing slayer makes me soooo hyped! even if i dont get it, its the anticipation of it as well that play's a big part at least for me.
---
and man haha exploring the world again its great! i purposefully don't skip tasks so i get to go everywhere :D its beeen sooooo long since i've traveled through brimhaven dungeon to greater demons omfg i had to look at the map :3 xD 
---
I think the majority of players want the Konar drop table to make her a worthwhile slayer master. The issue is that the way this RDT was implemented was poorly thought through. It was polled to reward players for slaying in less popular or efficient areas/methods. However, they made the RDT too dependent on 'hitting the lotto'. How does a rare chance at 2.5k brews or 198 torstols reward the average player for slaying in less efficient ways? The entire table should have been centered around a more reasonable median, and the range should have been much smaller. This is a level 75 combat slayer master after all, 2-7 mill drops will often double or triple the one lucky players bank (not to mention ironmen).
---
Additionally, the drops should have been more thought through. If they want the drops to be raw skilling resources (ignoring the large herb drops), then they needed to make the table much much larger. Having a large array of drops would spread out any possible negative impact and not drastically affect prices of particular skilling resources.
---
We want Konar to be worthwhile, but this RDT was anything but ' perfectly balanced, as all things should be.'
---
When you do, your character exclaims "Why would I want to dig up these healthy plants?" and does nothing.
---
That’s an exaggeration. 
---
nice to know ty
---
I think everyone made way too big a deal over this and it really shows. 
---
It's not about low levels making money you dunce
---
Because of the region it's placed in.
---
&gt; I'm however not fine with said loot being high quantity amount of resources that'll almost surely end up in lowering the value of said resources in the future given how many people are rolling on the KDT every day now.
---
This is very shortsighted as this is currently fresh content, and thus everyone is doing it. In a few weeks things will stabilize as the novelty wears off and people go back to their normal doings.   
---
Realistically this slayer masters perks vs downsides are only attractive to a small subsection of players.  
---
&gt; I'm seriously concerned for the future of OSRS seeing as how little people like OP and the people in this thread care for the balance of the game. 
---
You're concerned for the future yet can't see the big picture in the long run with updates appearantly.
---
It’s taking a long ass time I can tell you that . 
---
Because they buffed other areas of the drop table, by adding alchables and raw cash instead of the useless 3k rune drops. The average value of the drops were decreased 30%. 
---
Jagex: Nerfs birdhouses to bring value back to Saradomin Brews. Also Jagex: We should add in a drop that completely contradicts this previous statement and crashes brew prices again after they were slowly starting to go back up. 2500 Brew drop is not a balanced drop in any sense and even if it's extremely rare it's still not a drop that should exist, especially after a nerf to bring brew prices back up.
---
enjoying the content
---
Did 4 konar task and lost money, is not like you do a task and get 2m boo problem. I don't know why everyone is complaining. 100k people playing, 100 of them get good drops "nerf it! Nerf it now!!" Not to mention they adjusted the sara brews instantly.
---
To many people hoping on the bandwagon here are going to screw up an amazing update.
---
Right, because people who have busy lives, work full time, have families, are "garbage players". Get your head outta your ass.
---
Why Kieran? this is now dead content - I really hope you don't pull an  EoC and say "well 90% of players tried it at least once blah blah blah" - this was the first real update for mid levels, a chance at a big ticket item for low to med levels and a nerf shoots along.
---
It gave a reason to do content which was dead, a reason to slay things without going for exp because the chance for gold was a realistic option.
---
it's honestly disappointing. 
---
torstols lost 15% and ranarrs 7% value, yet here we are.
---
2m+ drops in high level herbs and skilling supplies are shitty as well.. it isn't just the one bugged drop
---
Listen, I've been around since before slayer was a skill and it was grindy back then too. I like all of the quality of life updates they've released and this was one of them - and now it's back to grindy
---
The people calling Faux a piece of shit should be fucking ashamed of themselves.
---
They should've given a lot more seeds though, 1-4 is what like 7-30ish herbs down from 200
---
This is the reasonable reaction. 
---
Exactly. The nerfs were needed. No one should care that much
---
Real question is "u hydra?"
---
I fully support changing out the herb drops for seed drops.
---
Regardless, 2500 brews has no place being a drop, no matter the rarity. Along with the amount of herbs that was on the table. IMO Jagex should have left the table alone, but replaced the herbs with an equivalent number of seeds, or a little bit less. It would still have what everyone wants without being too OP.
---
1. Faux is a strong influence in our community.
---
2. Yes faux didn’t personally choose the numbers. He did however push his weight into convincing people that the table was terrible. Convincing jaqex to change numbers/gp per hour.
---
3. Faux hasn’t been slaying normal monsters, and slaying the mils/hour boss.
---
4. He only stated today he did not want to change the gp/hour table of konar. He only wanted sara and herb drops changed which is like the same thing.
---
5. Konar dead now good job.
---
Why should PvMers be entitled to skilling resources then? Now you know how unreasonable and ridiculous you sound.
---
Man, I remember how many people were doing slayer all over the world. Now it’s just a ghost town in most locations. 
---
They almost look like wooden clogs 
---
cant wait for the screenshot of someone getting 4 celastrus seeds and everyone crying about it
---
BTC has been going up for 10 years, going through multiple cycles, why wouldn't you invest some money in it?
---
Actually, I think the last thing you ever want to do is *lazily* cater to a casual audience. Personally, I don't want drops that will enable me to buy bandos. I want content I can progress through without having to do 1,000,000 reps of it to get me to a point where I can raid for bandos.  
---
Like you said, you need a slow progression, but slow doesn't have to be synonymous with boring/grindy/repetitive.  
---
currently, I can keep farming barrows, but it's a bit boring and not particularly challenging. god wars or Jad seem way too high above my level. I'm legit just not sure what content is designed for players around my level. I've been doing a lot of questing working on RFD but idk if there's stuff less structured that I could be doing.
---
imagine spending months on an update and your QA team still okays it for release when half of the update is completely broken. 
---
I will always upvote top gear
---
honestly pray flicking does add difficulty to the game
---
just like pray switching and gear switching
---
How are they annoying to kill? You literally just have to dodge a slow yellow ball. They're kind of slow with sub-par drops, but they have some valuable uniques. Similar to abby demons.
---
Your attitude towards their decision is also a knee jerk. 
---
Fucking please
---
For raids 1 a dhcb is infinitely more useful. Lance isn't bad though.
---
Changing the herb drops to seeds is a killer, but I like the idea of more uniques with niche uses.
---
Do not nerf!!! Finally seeing areas full of people slaying monsters we would usually skip is awesome. Couple of people post some good drops but a couple autists who have a fuck load of money complain and its nerfed. Some fucking awesome content for people my combat level who dont sit around and play all day!!
---
So you expect an entire game to be balanced over the fact that some people whose lifestyle allows them to play 5 hours a day lets them be better at the game compared to somebody who plays 1-2. Mid level slayer has always been shit. Konars tasks are generally farther away, lower exp, and overall slower tasks compared to the rest of the slayer masters. The tradeoff of doing shittier tasks is the small chance (which is rng based) that you get a hood drop every few tasks. Without that, there is no incentive. There would be no reason to do hellhounds in catacombs. People freaking out about others getting very rare 2m drops. Is it imbalanced to get a visage drop from a wyvern? All it does is add variety to the game and give a gp boost to mid level slayer.
---
Seed drops are not exciting, they are dull and boring. For ironman sure. Having 5 torstols is nice but for a normal guy it is quite dull.
---
Konar isn't even max cash due to not being able to do tasks efficiently or swapping them out for bosses. It's literally just a nice change with some decent points and a tiny chance at a little bit of profit that's available to mid levels.
---
Cheers!
---
God so much anger.  Having a super rare chance at a lottery type drop encourages putting in the time.  How is it bad to give medium level players that opportunity?
---
Congratulations, you played yourself
---
Imagine being that stupid enough to donate that much 
---
zzz
---
I got Steel dragons twice before the update at base 75 stats. Fun 5 hours
---
I got 500 coal for 131k and 30 diamonds for 112k b2b to wyrm
---
Well before you got snapdragon (190) which is like 1.7m loot now you get 1-4 Snapdragon seeds work out the math
---
Play RS3. You can quickly max within a matter of hours and take part in any content you wish. Or better yet just log on for 30 seconds daily and just collect your spins until you eventually get maxed with zero effort.
---
But slayer is something :(
---
and i agree.
---
it's a tiny chance for a good drop. people here seriously think that just because they saw like 6 screenshots on reddit that must mean everyone is getting 200 ranarrs per kill.
---
Isnt it 50/50
---
No they haven't removed them yet. The wording on the post is terrible but I'm pretty sure they reduced the chance of hitting it by 30% (or the quantity by 30%?) and if the player feedback says it's still too OP they'll fully replace the drops later in the week.
---
Yep absolutely obliterated by nerfing the Konar drop table.
---
Lol the victimized gamer is a good look here 😂
---
Any gaming community on reddit is toxic like that. “Nerf this, buff that! My feelings should dictate everyone’s reality!”
---
so what's the point of Konar then? you don't even net more slayer points using her when you account for the terrible locations for some of the tasks 
---
I suppose you'd want Scepter removed from Agi pyramid, too?  6 mill is pretty shitty just for doing agi, right?
---
got 125 bloodvelds in god wars dungeon. lmfao 
---
hyrda isn't even a dragon.

seems like a poor design choice to me.

You're assuming that the subscribers of this sub represent a properly random sample of the population. It's not a random sample though, because there's a selection bias for people who are interested in this game. This doesn't necessarily mean that the people here are on average smarter or stupider than the population. It just means that you can't assume that the distribution of intelligence in the sub is exactly the same as the distribution of intelligence in the entire population, because the 50% thing is based on the entire population. It's perfectly possible that more than 50% of the people in this sub are above average intelligence, and it's perfectly possible that more than 50% of the people in the sub are below average intelligence. We don't know though, because we don't actually have the stats on that.
---
thats my point though, the game has always been about grinding, it sounds like this game has never been for you but this update isn’t the reason for that
---
See, this is why you deserve more than one downvote on many of your posts.
---
Literally the only thing I see wrong with them is the d mace is on their drop table as a rare.
---
The first donations totaled 35k pounds and all of them together totaled 73k usd. 
---
ladies and gentlemen, we have a rich memer.
---
I have been known to give new players gold at the GE (never a lot, since I don't have tons myself), but I'm not the person you're thinking of. I'm just a humble pure going for 2K total. 😄
---
Jesus, you're further up your own ass than serene
---
Well, you sound triggered so I did the job properly :)
---
What's your point? You're literally agreeing.
---
Was saying this in cc yesterday.   
---
It's always the same damn thing. Dev team is too quick to bend under pressure.  
---
Analyze the data &amp; make a choice accordingly. Instead we're hit with the endless cycle of;  
---
* New content released
---
* Streamers (especially) and community bitch &amp; panic about new "op" drops.
---
* Devs fold under pressure and nerf.
---
* Streamers (especially) and community bitch &amp; panic about new "trash" drops.
---
* Repeat.  
---
It's getting real old.
---
Yep, we all share the exact same opinion here ^^^^/s
---
There weak to melee too, especially if you have a lance 
---
It *isn't* worth doing. My point is that you don't need to tell people to not do something they aren't going to do anyway. 
---
Thanks for the follow-through. 
---
If PvM can get skilling resources. Then why shouldn't skilling get PvM loot?
---
Why does it matter?
---
the fact that u can get random giant drops while doing low level slayer is more than enough so idk why people have their panties in a twist over a drop table change. 2bh why on earth did jagex put such dumb shit on the table to begin with lol
---
I mean more along the lines of bait used to catch BiS fish that don't give great xp, but they are BiS for PvE and require bait that only drops from certain slayer monsters. I think shit like that could be pretty cool.
---
No, he's saying that Jagex can't release things that are more profitable by too wide of a margin. Which is true. Overly fast power creep is bad for casual players because it obsoletes the content they like to do, as well as the content they want to do in the future. Keeping power creep in check is in their best interest. 
---
Wintertodt is actually a good example of such excessive power creep, it's just that most people didn't care because Firemaking is a pointless skill anyway.
---
Someone sounds triggered and butthurt
---
I dont get why so many people are saying you must be retarded if you cant max your account when you have a life...? The sheer number of posts I see saying the same thing as you, some from myself included, goes to show that if theres a large number of us who have dedicated a lot of time into this game but at a much slower rate because we dont play the same video game for several hours a day every day, maybe we have a point? There is very little mid game content. End of story. As a casual, I would love for more additional stuff that characters between level 50 and 90 can do without having to pure. Why is that such a big deal? 
---
I mean konar gives the most points, has similar tasks to duradel, and gives bonus loot (whether its op or not). May as well use her unless you really want the slayer tower bonus xp or really want skot totems or whatever. People reeeeing way too hard, even without the kdt she'd be solid.
---
yeah but on avg the drops are only somewhat worse.
---
This, plus they're for sure gonna buff it again later on. They just nerfed it so shit doesn't get fucked over the weekend.
---
The nerf was a step in the right direction. The new items are much better and fitting, and don't devalue the shit out of other aspects of the game. The value should be brought more in line with how it was before though. I'm sure it'll be tweaked and perfected in the coming weeks.
---
Has nothing to do with streamers and players being jealous. I'm sure some are, but the vast majority of players are concerned with the overall inflow of herbs and other supplies impacting Skilling as a whole and the economy. And don't get me started on the implications it would have for iron men. 
---
Saying konar needed a nerf because of brew drops when they got removed almost instantly is retarded.
---
This comparison sucks 
---
Don't worry about him: you're doing the lord's work for lazy people like me
---
Why are those seeds 2m each lol.. they ovb can't stay like that 
---
LMAO "you're gettin slapped" proceeds to get slapped instead.
---
Every drop in the game devalues skilling with few exceptions. The point of this post is to show this barely makes a dent at all.
---
He keeps talking about how everybody should me maxxed like him, and how an infernal make sure him a "pvm god". He's just a troll. 
---
No, he feels that when he finally got an update with content that is actually decent for his level it gets nerfed within a day because high levels that probably won't even partake or be affected by it complain.
---
50,000 people used to visit her but now its a ghost town.
---
&gt; Konar's Unique table is accessed at a rate of 1/100 for level 100 NPCs and 1/50 for level 350 NPCs. This contains the broken Dragon hasta and used to contain 2,500 Saradomin brews which were removed shortly after the update.
---
It helps to read the full paragraph... The Unique Table is not the same as the main table. But it probably still is pretty rare.
---
If you’re a high level player then you don’t need all that cash because you already should have have alot otherwise you are just trash at this game relying on Vorkath.
---
Now you see how stupid you sound? Good.
---
No problem! 
---
use the costume room at your poh!!!
---
How many replies now have you ended by saying I'm crying now? Ya I think someone's projecting. I know you don't know what that word means but I'm sure you can Google it. I've got better things to do than raise someone else's child so you have a nice day. 
---
Dumb updates are dumb regardless how many hours a day you play. This was overtuned af. They over nerfed it for now and they'll fix it next week. 
---
Jad is really easy to do at like 60-70 ranged but he's not a boss you farm, he's a thing you do once to get the fire cape.
---
If you dont have a skip, you do the task. 
---
The WT world is full of a very special group of people. Winterdaddy? Like what..
---
It's a normal schedule..? Dude even gets to have only a 20min commute. Try it with an hour commute. That's how a large number of people live their lives and that's why we are asking for some mid level content. 
---
They are. If anything, rs3 is harder. Grinding is **artificial difficulty**. If it's fun to you, that's fine; you have every right to do the things you enjoy. I enjoy osrs because of a mixture of nostalgia and its charming D&amp;D-like combat and skilling style, so I play it on spite of the grind. But dont pretend grinding is anything but artificial difficulty just because you enjoy doing it.
---
Can't see a problem with this.
---
"if I use the word triggered enough, people will agree with me!"
---
Not how it works here
---
And that's the problem with EfficiencyScape, if something isn't the best way of doing something on release then it's considered dead content. The problem isn't with the nerf, it's with player's mindset these days. 
---
I just received 1 noted rune platelegs as a Konar drop. Which is not on the "current" table but is on the nerfed table. 
---
Agreed it’s like making a decision with no evidence 
---
&gt;The straight gameplay is debatable as a job, but commenting and giving your own insights on a game most certainly can be a job.
---
So recording a game and not commenting on it is up for debate, but from the moment you give your own insights and comments it becomes a job?
---
&gt;  Some people do guides or explain or teach others how to play/ or mechanics and the like whereas some people provide entertainment. 
---
How do you explain that this has been going on for a while before ads on youtube were a thing? So all these people were doing something they liked and didn't want anything for return. I define that as a hobby but not a job. 
---
Also you descriped a job could be: "anything if someone is willing to pay money for it"
---
Before ads those people didn't get paid, so according to your logic they were not doing it as a job until the moment you could get paid for it and thus magicly became a job? Like from one day to the next?
---
And are you seriously guessing my age to say I don't have enough experiences nor understanding? I think it's funny you try to guess my age, that you don't even know, to prove your point.
---
People are panic selling literally everything. 
---
Lol theyre worth less cut 
---
Good to hear.
---
Tell me your RSN
---
there's always been issues with drop table changes, exact same thing happened post-garg, nech, kurask, waterfiend slayer table buffs as well.
---
drop tables are kinda scuffed, nobody has a really good idea of what a good one looks like. 
---
max cape...
---
Jokes aside, I'd quit years ago if they never added IMM. I bet there's thousands of people who also would've, literally the best update to ever come to this game.
---
consider these changes:
---
0.01% chance of 200 herbs -&gt; 0.2% chance of 2 seeds
---
0.1% chance of 100 planks -&gt; 0.2% chance of 100 logs + 0.2% chance of alchables
---
0.01% chance of 2500 sara brews -&gt; ok lets be honest this one was stupid, replace it with literally anything else worth an average of 600gp/kill
---
this would have very little effect on the game's economy, konar's profitability, or the viability of using her as a slayer master. It would, however, preserve the integrity of ironman mode by not further reducing it to pvm-to-train-all-your-skills.
---
The complaints were that konar gave finished products as drops (herbs, potions), when it should have given alchs and precursors (seeds, coal, gems).
---
They did rebalance it in the right direction, but they also nerfed the raw gp/hour of the boss which really wasn't necessary.
---
Me too man. See you at the Guild
---
Holy shit, gz. Im on 2 ring pieces at 102 kc
---
You literally have used personal attacks from your very first comments. Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
---
Also way to inject politics into a video game argument, typical brainlet ledditor logic. I'm just going to block you now, anyone that uses politics for their arguments just aren't worth the time.
---
You know slayer monsters have dropped hens for a decade right? 
---
0/10, shitty trolling.
---
While I think some of the nerfs may be overkill, what you're saying isn't true. It's a complete overreaction to say Konar is dead content (especially while the team is still looking into her table to make proper balances).
---
Most players who do slayer do not do it to maximum efficiency, and for those player Konar is still a great option. She also gives a high number of points which is great for people who don't like to do Wildy slayer. Players need to remember that Efficiency-scape is not the only way to play the game, and just because something is not BiS, that does not mean it's dead content.
---
He Dead
---
And they didnt. Original konar was not more profitable by a wide margin. 
---
Rather save those as the Magic Prayer armor from Warding or future quests than throwing them randomly on Konar's table. Like the Dagon'Hai do exist in OSRS and they have no relation to Zeah.
---
How accurate is the pricing on the claw, I have a hasta just wondering if the lance is worth it or just to tough out my task.
---
Because he's one of the best streamers for the game with a great personality. His ironman content is top tier and his streams are all around fun to watch.
---
Rs3 doesnt have bank placeholders though so its unplayable. I just want some mid level content pls
---
I’m sure Jagex has a lot of perks and benefits that make it more attractive. For many that is considered part of the compensation 
---
"Lol PVMers are such brainlets they don't even know what they want."
---
You realize that you’ll probably make more money now? The odd of hitting the 2.5k brews was tiny. Now at least you’ll get consistent drops worth a couple hundred k.
---
I just don't understand this logic. 
---
If player X fishes for 5 hours in 1 day, and player Y fishes for 1 hour for 5 days, they both end up with the same amount of XP... It's even arguable that player Y came out ahead because of dailies. 
---
How is treating each hour a player spends in game independent of how many other hours that player has spent *not* respecting the player's time?
---
What about it?
---
Apologies, the official Old School wiki is usually a go-to source.  Looks like an update is needed on their side.
---
To be fair, I've not done any aerial fishing myself.
---
instead listen 2 reddit noobs who wont be happy until u get 100m drops for camping pve mobs
---
Yes!
---
Just hit the drop table and got one cooked swordfish, NERF IT NOW
---
"WAAAAAAAAH HE FOUND OUT TRIGGERED I AM WAAAAAH"
---
Basically what happened with your response.
---
Imagine someone that works a shit job for 20 hours a week saying he deserves to be paid as much as you because he doesn't have time to work a good 40 hour job. 
---
If you can't put some time in to reach your goals go play rs3 or any tripple a recent game that isn't the biggest grind ever.
---
"haha guys look what an asshole I am. I'm a troll, doesn't everybody love me?"
---
At least serene is sincere. 
---
This is very well done. 
---
Are you for real
---
Yeah, it didn't come from farming before farming was released, but now that it is, it should come from it
---
"Potions shouldn't be made via herblore because they were bought in stores before herblore was released!"
---
Get outta here
---
Your problem is using cannonballs. You shouldn't be getting max efficiency as well as making a profit. 
---
Lmao imagine being this hurt
---
“Game breaking” lmfao have you done a single konar task? Honest question 
---
I cant believe she won so much from it and didn't really know anything 
---
Perfect you followed the last rule of Trump style debating, run away and stop listening after everyone realises that you have no idea what you are talking about. Later snowflake. 
---
The changes went through already, there was an update timer and everything.
---
Haha y’all don’t have free speech so fuck that. 
---
What happened in short summary? Haven’t played in a month 
---
2nd? I'd say sick nerd and curtis were above him
---
Right back atcha since you started it.
---
Konar's drop table was nerfed too hard, but it wasn't fine, lol
---
Fuck the damn slayer skill, seriously. No other skill has damaged this game so much nor provided even a quarter of the drama. 
---
Is this not the subreddit for OSRS discussion? Am I not allowed to suggest that they avoid doing bad content? I have no control over these people. I'm sure loads of people will continue using her and they are welcome to if they want to, and I'm happy that they find something salvageable out of this entire mess.
---
I feel like you're very confused about what you're even asking of me. 
---
Nty.
---
\&gt;Anymore  
---
Literally less than 24 hours. Muppet.
---
Faux just wants what's best for OSRS. Leave him alone and go play RS3 you moose knuckle
---
Maybe I'm just a brainlet and just don't get it but why wouldn't it be camelCase like literally every other Java function?
---
&gt; That way your 1m drop is still 1m, but farming isn't taken out of the equation. Going from a 1m drop to a 250k drop is what makes a lot of people upset. 
---
just like everyone else saying it, the 1m drops were very rare and they added something on there that's currently worth 2m of, and you can get 4 of those.
---
Or make the 90% of current hunter thats useless and dead do literally anything
---
What a cunt. XAbysss / R3AL MAIN you can get fucked all the way to fucksville. 
---
Also new mystic looks sick
---
Honestly it's more of an integrity issue they shouldn't poll it at all. Their current excuse of 3rd party clients could still just show the current votes is bull since they've had clients remove features before.
---
Well yeah when you remove the change of a BIS drop the /hour has to be higher.
---
huh i think the tables fine tbh. idk why you think its overshadowed by zulrah. good base drops, great uniques.
---
the supply drops are very useful given its far from a bank. all bosses have throwaway drops, ever gotten 100 scales+ flax+tar at zulrah before mate?
---
At the end of the day it all depended on statistics, if a person killing turoths got a 2mil drop after like 30 tasks of not getting anything...that doesn't sound too broken. It was a small way to spice up early level slayer but i was definitely against the 2500 brew drop, as it seemed very out of place.  
---
Lol the pkers were quick to hop on you after you got it.
---
Yea the sub did a complete 180 from yesterday. I feel bad for the J-Mods having to put up with this shit. 
---
this happens to every older game with relatively small player bases
---
Seriously, I'm the exact same combat lvl and really the only things i can't do are raids/inferno/high level slayer bosses.
---
Lmfao mad cuz can’t pvm. Sorry that ur 56 slayer doesn’t drop 2m per task anymore you fucking brainlet, shame you actually have to learn the game like everyone before you 
---
&gt;confirmation bias
---
no it isn't. I'm simply stating facts, and that in my experience, they dropped easily. 
---
I'm completely unbiased and dont give a shit if they change konar or not.
---
Your comment sounds like the only thing keeping you playing was the new drop table... and of course the updates cater for mostly high level players because low and mid levels have still things to look forward to in the game. 
---
Also "gain money" in this example is weird since I don't think you'll get better money unless you hit those torstols and whatnot. If you think it was so crazy money beforhand that now after the nerf you're considering quitting I don't know what to say. Plus for all its worth they can keep the drop table as is, but change the skilling items to alchables of same value.
---
I think people have forgotten that this game is supposed to be fun
---
Good dog.
---
Jeez, can't ya'll understand that the majority of the complains was regarding the amount of skilling supplies that's obtainable through PvM, not the overall value of the loot. I'm perfectly fine with the value being the same, but I hate to see drops like the current ones. 
---
Skilling should not be devalued for the sake of slayer.
---
Skilling receives barely any love, some half-arsed updates like aerial fishing every now and then.
---
Why are her hands down to her shins
---
Are you a stand in for Serene?
---
shit is a goldmine today fucking hilarious 
---
You're missing the point entirely. It's not that they're expensive, it's that they're an herb and a secondary combined in a giant fucking quantity. Resource drops shouldn't come from bossing.
---
Feman
---
What's your rsn?
---
Yes you do
---
Btw
---
Yes. Konar is still the best money making slayer monster. The average drop table hit is now 150k, instead of 220k. It really isn't the end of the world like people want to pretend.
---
Lore heavy, basically zero reqs, new interesting areas, and all building up to something bigger, potentially the biggest osrs story line yet.
---
Honestly excited to see it unfold
---
Yeah I thought this was great. What a knee-jerk to a vocal minority.
---
It's still spiced up. There's still a lot of worthwhile bonus drops just not shit that wasn't deserved from the content that dropped them.
---
I mean after two years of friendship he had let down his guard likely. Also potential dissociation between the value of the items in game and real world. I couldn't have named what the bow is worth in real $ personally.
---
This is so fucking dumb it hurts. It's still better if you're a fucking scrub just killing gargoyles/abby specs/etc. It's always been the best money in the game skill wise. The people you're talking about actually lose money because of the price of potions/etc to stay efficient.
---
Nah. Konar is intended to be unique, not objectively worse just because the level requirement is lower
---
Lmao. People act like its fauxs fault the op drop table got nerfed. 
---
You must be mistaken my good man, dogs can't use computers or phones :( 
---
An easy mistake to make though so no worries &lt;3
---
Okay, tell me how planks would inflate the GP......
---
You don't need 75 slayer to use Konar. It is only a 75 combat requirement... she is a medium level slayer master
---
It's influx of rs3 players trying to make osrs into rs3. 
---
Fail
---
Fuck that.  Glad it got nerfed. Had a fat stack on ranarrs in my bank 
---
You sound triggered. Send me a video of those tears please? I even used the magic word. It'd be priceless to watch!!! :D
---
So is Duradel better slayer xp or profit per hour than Konar now after the nerf or are people overreacting?
---
Y?
---
I wouldn't be so sure just yet, it's still in the hype phase and will probably decline further
---
"Over the last 50 years" Mate Runescape is 18 years old now?
---
Tbf if you aint playing the game for your own enjoying then whats the point in playing at all?
---
Fuck this subreddit, you dont need BIS everything to enjoy the game, play it how you want to play it, thats the beauty of OSRS in the first place. 
---
You should try doing Clues. At your level you'll probably need to do quite a few quests to finish them. It's good motivation.
---
Nah if you study Serena’s comments you’ll discover he’s pretty alt-right and would agree with you 
---
Pussy
---
Delete this
---
Just like ur mom
---
Konar is trans.  She got a big ol' feminine dick.
---
As a level 3 from tutorial island you have more earning potential than fletching at wintertodt lol, don't sell yourself short  
---
Or just use melee or mage anyways, why does everything have to be max efficiency lol just play the game and have fun jesus
---
i wouldn't nerf it at all it would make konar dead content...
---
Hot take, Serene
---
Despite all the rs3 transfers throwing a hissy fit that they cant get 2mil drops at fucking turoth I'm glad jagex acted quick to fix the konar table. And anyone saying Konar is dead content now is fucking stupid. Getting a couple extra 100k drops during a task along with most slay points outside wild is plenty reward for using konar. I don't care how rare but hundreds of torstols getting dropped at mid level slayer isn't right. And herbs were already crashing. Planks?, unf bolts? a few seeds? that's a great extra incentive to use Konar. You noobs need to fucking chill on this. That's all.
---
Imagine being such an aids riddled piece of shit that you post smiley faces about my dead cat over some pixels. 
---
Spoken like a true normie
---
Eloquent. 
---
Yeah. At best they're break even, and thieving's profit is pretty eh. Hunting doing red / black chins (is that still the meta?) is ok but not better than RC has ever been and it's like the only skill
---
Your experiences does not mean that it's a "fact" these drops are common.
---
Because it still effects the rest of the game (e.g. economy) obviously.
---
or maybe the nerf went overboard and im annoyed that new content is already dead?
---
God you are a brainlet, Reddit: we want skilling to be a viable method for money also Reddit; REEE my OP DROP TABLE I DONT CARE ABOUT ECONOMICS OR HOW IT WORKS 
---
I don't think the games been out that long my good man 
---
Only play a few hours a week normally and still enjoy the game as much as I used to. The experience is what you make it 
---
Children in Africa could’ve smoked that Ranarr smdh
---
That is a good counterpoint. Hmmm idk what to think anymore.
---
do you know how planks are made
---
Exactly. Didn't really need a guide for them. It was more fun just to do them.
---
Reasonable difficult and not on that elemental workshop III bs with the hour long lender and gear puzzle
---
Damn, guess I haven't been playing since 2004.
---
Besides complaining, can you explain why wasn't the konar drop table was not OP?
---
It was completely geared towards ironmen so they could get a little jump on moving forwards instead of spending time gathering supplies and slowly leveling.
---
Everyone else at 75 combat would take these drops straight to the GE to get better gear. 
---
Past experience has shown they usually inform the whiners that the data shows something different from the whiner's observations. When the whiners are right according to the data Jagex usually just fixes the problem then later explains why they changed it.
---
Nah, you're just projecting. Most of us aren't untrustworthy shitbags.
---
Their is a guy that used to donate crazy amounts of money to streamers in CSGO that was pretty much that.  He had some kind of wealth in oil to point where it just wasnt anything to him and her took enjoyment out of making his favorite streamers years.
---
I can't wait for everyone to say this content is dead after a day
---
Can't be sure. Unfortunately you'll probably have to do some legwork to track down the problem. Trying different devices on the same network / different networks on the same device, etc.
---
Could you link me to where he says that, all i can see on his twitter is him making a fool of him self 
---
How is any of this a discussion when you are just blatantly telling people to stop doing something.
---
Oh my, it speaks runescape and autism at the same time! 
---
Now sit.
---
Hope you had every perk you could have ever wanted from slayer lmao 
---
Lmao, 3-5 hours a day. 
---
Please tell me that’s at least only 1-2/week. 
---
So I'm relatively new to the game (this time around). What happens to a quest cape if new quests are released? Do you keep it, or do you have to do all the new quests to get it back?
---
I'll tell ya who's to blame.  
---
A major influence in the community who DM'ed JMods, asking them all sorts of questions and berating them to fix it, coupled with his easily impressionable fans following suit and doing the same thing. Resulting in a 3 hour shitstorm on twitter sparked by some asshat who didn't even do regular Konar tasks and just camped Hydra while at the same time complaining that one guy got 200 torstols as a drop even though the chances of getting that drop were rarer than getting a DWH. On top of that and some dumbshit memes, Jagex's poor decision-making skills rose to the surface, and they implemented a knee-jerk bandaid fix that didn't take actual data into account, but the outcry of a vocal minority.
---
honestly you don't need high range/magic for stuff unless you're doing the real endgame bosses. Most gwd bosses you melee, barrows you do mage (trident/ibans staff/slayer dart), but even then the requirements aren't high. You can get 55 magic/slayer in a week of playing very casually.
---
&gt;no authenticator in 2019
---
Lmao
---
So... How was it..?
---
Can some one elaborate on this?
---
I'm done.
---
Fuck anyone who can't play 24/7 on release day. 
---
You are listening to the loud minority who post their sick loot for karma.
---
We should have a roll back to be fair
---
Sure, redeem it, buy bonds, apply it to your account and it will give you membership, both memberships are the same.
---
I like your suggestions, but the first two suggestions are a bit too out there and hard to implement right away. The blessing thing that you suggested seems like an item they may release for magic later down the line to make it more balanced as a combat skill or some form of that. Giving xp lamps is starting to hit the balance issue and could have unintended consequences.
---
The rest of them seem to be more on the point though and could easily be added/implemented.
---
 Nice try, I would never Brexit the USA for UK.
---
&gt;was the first thing I felt like I could do in a long time.
---
So level up your account to do end game content? You just seem lazy.
---
Ask for 1.2b worth of stuff. If they’ve been playing for that long I can only imagine he has some loot. May not be a fair trade but you know. It’s collateral at the least 
---
Hey, that's nice, but you're flat out wrong. Because 3 efficient tasks are going to make more money and points than the one inefficient task you could do from Konar in the same time. 
---
Yes I consume supplies not my brow now if the brow degraded to dust that would be different
---
see this is exactly what I figured was going to happen
---
it should have been tiered properly to be 76 fishing is always sharks unless 82 fishing then dark crabs/anglers
---
62 fishing=monkfish 50 fishing=swordfish. and it would actually scale. this is why im so upset with jagex rn
---
How do you know he DM’ed Jmods? 
---
Yea I’ll probably stick with nieve and go to konar every 10th task for the extra points 
---
Go play rs3 then
---
Can we buff the bone necklace to give glory base attack bonus's and 4 strength, I think that would make it actually viable and definitely not overpowered at all. The necklace is useless without any real benefit to wearing an item that will drop your dps by over 10%. Please fix this extremely rare item that is now an alching item...
---
Make melee special attacks more accurate to offset having to be up close and personal.
---
Or it could give more items value. People buy them to lend out, people borrowing and making money over time gives them more money to buy them later on and raises the price because of demand for them 
---
Ignore EoC for a moment and acknowledge that RS3's playerbase has steadily declined for years now because of how many "ezscape" updates they make that push players away and how terrible their new player experience is (because new players are expected to only do like 3 or 4 super efficient things opposed to being able to do anything).
---
Support
---
Loot from doing most things thats no mt slayer apparently 
---
No u
---
"surpasses zulrah." lmao. the highest i can think of is death rc at 99. or flipping, which is very arguable
---
Employees at Jagex who have ironmen accounts and who make updates based on their own personal experience with the game have too much influence.
---
2.5k brews? rly dude?
---
This.
---
Stupid is good. 
---
ahh my bad assumed you were referring to the hasta possibly being inflated because it was new hadn't checked price. Even those will end up tied to the value of the staves you get from em though. And also don't really have a negative effect on other skills as far as I can tell.
---
How do you know if something is an integrity issue?
---
Some of those specs are nasty. That kid trying to tb you was funny af. 
---
What’s happened? Haven’t been able to get on this week been with the SO. 
---
the new drop table is very similar without the jackpot loots, stop being autistic and ree’ing about everything 
---
Bluerite 
---
No one said anything about EHP. I'm willing to bring my slayer rates down to a quarter of what they usually are if I feel adequately rewarded otherwise what's the point? Why would I willingly waste triple my time and do double the work of moving from area to area for less rewards overall? That's just insanity.
---
She gives the highest points in the game simply to make up for how much harder her tasks are than Duradel, but if you do the math you end up getting much less points. I'll finish 200 Abyssal demons in the catacombs in under an hour with the added benefit of skotizo totem pieces and ancient shards, meanwhile it would probably take me three hours to finish that many in the Abyssal area. How are you not seeing the disparity here?
---
Also I'm getting pretty tired of hearing "she's the third best slayer master". No, she's not. Her requirements are the third highest but she also exclusively assigns the highest level slayer monster in the entire game. She is a challenging slayer master similar to the wilderness slayer master that requires a different approach but also needs a reason to justify that effort. I don't even care about the stupid herbs anymore, give her SOMETHING to make her worth using. Maybe even grant extra damage against your slayer task in that area. **Anything**.
---
You've been playing for a year and you're complaining? Lmao this game isn't for you bro. Please do us all a favour and stop playing if you don't enjoy it. Entitled loser.
---
Losses are lessons. Sorry for the loss. Hopefully Jagex can help you out. 
---
What exactly broke the game? The sporadic rare herb drops? The brews? Hardly man
---
Agreed. Downvoted 
---
Id like to see very few big supply drops or even alchables on the table but make it possible to grind imbued heart and eternal gem on Konar tasks. Alot of people get 99 slayer without ever getting those items.
---
2 options IMO:
---
1.) Increase amount of superiors that spawn during Konar tasks
---
2.) Add imbued heart and eternal gem as an extremely rare drop to the normal monsters.
---
I quit playing lol almost 6 years ago but I still occasionally read those. I fucking blog posts like that
---
OH GOD, YES PLEASE
---
None of the people complaining wanted this kind of nerf; it made little sense for a large quantity of skilling resources be on the drop table when it's fairly obvious that both the community and jagex themselves agree it makes more sense for them to come from skilling-based activities. 
---
Some of the more controversial drops could be changed but the overall profit can easily remain the same if other changes are made to compensate. For instance, nobody seemed to complain about the alchable drops.
---
Yes I would also like to know when you worked at Jagex. 
---
damn. can't wait until they hype blows over so it can go back to being a prod xp method. 
---
I feel like it is fine as it is.
---
What if we added tickets to the drop table that would be 1 time use and allow you to choose between 2 tasks once?
---
Okay, cool 🤘
---
Whats wrong with new content being best gp/hr? There is always going to be something being best gp/hr
---
You can interpret it anyway you want, but written as is he’s saying the OP works night shifts. 
---
Probably because today is Friday and they can come back to work on Monday and react more appropriately.
---
Lol k kiddo. Get out of your mom's basement and get a job. Then maybe you can understand half of the variables involved
---
usually have to level something other than slayerscape for that
---
I got mine at 37.
---
It will keep going up because Zulrah nerf means that Vorkath is superior golden peices per hour and therefore blowpipe supply is on the decline.  Eventually the price + scale price will make Zulrah &gt; or == to Vorkath and then it will level off there.
---
Cant make everyone happy; and the squeeky wheel gets yhe oil. Happens in ever game these days.
---
Hello is discord a must? This is my last req for tasks and would appreciate any help. 
---
Damn, thats a lotta money, thanks.
---
I’m level 89 starting to get good I’m looking to be doing some pvm once i level up abit more you can add me if you want 
---
And Jagex of course are fucking spineless and bend over and get fucked by the few loud brainlets in this community 
---
Oh shit! Guess I'm no longer gonna have a holiday tab in my bank! I should probably go through my quest items tab to get rid of things that I don't need anymore, too. Lots of old keys and scrolls. 
---
If it was 19 torstols that were 10 times more common everything would be fine, but up that by 10 times and somehow it's bad. Also more seeds on drop table would benefit skillers too
---
I strongly agree, that's why I mentioned scalability. Much like the wintertodt crates work, I think the drops you get from Konar should be based on your level in the relevant skill. For example:
---
69+ Fletching: 200-300 Runite Bolts unf
---
54-60 Fletching: 200-300 Mithril Bolts unf
---
61-68 Fletching: 200-300 Adamant Bolts unf
---
And so forth, for all drop types.
---
&gt;No delay on removing authenticator in 2019
---
Buzz your girlfriend, woof.
---
How about collecting some data, presenting it to the community, and then polling. 
---
I mean an average 30% nerf on an already rare drop isn't nearly as big of a deal as people are making it out to be.  It doesn't make it dead content instantly.  At the very least every 10th task is a fine place for a slayer master anyway.
---
And runescape isn’t even a US based game/company so why assume again?
---
What happened ?
---
top kek
---
Its an ad, I dont know who the guy is but is that not a smart time to run an ad?
---
This but a better anology would be putting a name in a hat than dice. Abyssal demons weight is 12 so he gets his name in the hat 12 times. Zygomites weight his 1 so he only gets 1 name in the hat. Then a name is pulled out to determine your task
---
No you wont, you would get 2 torstol seeds from a jelly and be happy as fuck saying thats an amazing drop from a shitty monster because you wouldnt have the retarded idea of a 2 million drop from a jelly
---
Clearly I’m not the only person who thinks this otherwise the comment saying “how do you know”wouldn’t have 2 upvotes and my response wouldn’t have 15
---
Time to gas the (((streamers)))
---
&gt; understanding of the game
---
Press x to doubt.
---
UH BUT THERES A 5M DROP THATS SO op!!!!!!!11!
---
I'm glad there's finally a post about how Konar's DT isn't OP, the amount of people saying that a 2.5k brew drop being OP without even knowing the drop rate is ridiculous. Seeing how few people go it, I'm assuming it's at best a 1/10k drop rate which adds a measly 600gp\~ to each kill
---
Also, why do you keep downvoting me cause I disagree?
---
Fuck yeah glad to hear. For real though I'm mad broke in game so depending on how cleaned you are I'm your rebuild buddy if your clan mates are ages ahead. Regardless boss gl on the rebuild, 1.3b is a fair price to pay to get rid of a fake ass fuck of a friend 
---
Also had no idea of the drop rate when he made his position known. What a champ
---
grow up
---
100-200 herb drops to 1-4 seeds is a joke!!!
---
Change 4-10 seeds.
---
Please please please listen to this guy, I never enjoyed slayer as much as this.
---
That’s easy in the Zammy dungeon.. zammy blessing and max range/blowpipe 
---
Dont know why you're getting downvoted, you're absolutely right
---
If you think its dead content there is no hope for your stupidity. Its still very worthwhile. Sorry your lvl 75 account cant get 200 torstols from a brine rat anymore though and ruin the game.
---
When did Zulrah get nerfed. I thought it was increasing cause people were trying to merch them for ancient hydra.
---
I saw the hanoi puzzle and got so excited i put all the discs on the right pole before realizing that they were supposed to go in the middle lol
---
Nice i just finished my 22 kill trip, iman btw.
---
complains about jagex nerf, calls most of the community lowlifes, demands change
---
???????
---
Indeed! It was nice finally doing a quest where a guide didn’t exist yet. When I don’t have 100 quests still left to do I actually find myself reading through all the dialogue.
---
You definitely seem bitter
---
You've presumed much about me from three sentences I posted on reddit, none of which were even directed towards you. I stand by my original statement; Serene is a hateful bigot and he/she can go fuck off.
---
Well I have 65 fishing and got sharks 
---
Serene... stfu
---
&gt; total level nearing 1000  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;but I feel that I'm unqualified for most of the very exciting content 
---
1000 total level is like a day of playing lmao. Of course you're "unqualified" for the exciting content.
---
Fuck off you Jew 
---
&gt; Slayer will be dead content to me
---
oh noo i can't afk literally any creature at 75 combat for 700k gp/hr game sucks reeeeeeeeee
---
go train a skill for once
---
I got very lucky and got sharks my first task woohoo.  But then only hit runes in the next 5 tasks.  Its not as insane as people make it seem.
---
No, please don't kill Konar already, i done one task and got a 100k drop from GREATER DEMONS omfg no way yada yada... It makes dead content greatish, since greater demons are very forgettable, but I will persist for a chance at the 200 torstals. Nobody will for 2 rune helms and a snapdragon seed. Well done Jagex for listening to naggers with 17 slayer and wasted your dev teams time on promisable content. RIP Konar...
---
yea, the best part is that, its their job to play runescape, so who cares how long it took you? you fed your family donig that, i play for fun lmao
---
I'm just barely getting 20k/25k fishing exp/hour whilst doing aerial fishing. From the wiki: "At levels below 70 you will receive around 35,000 - 40,000 experience per hour, while at levels 70 or above you will receive around 50,000 - 60,000 experience per hour." So yes, I'm definitely getting double the experience barbarian fishing.
---
Support.
---
I need to get around to watching Rick and Morty
---
!remindme 22 hours
---
imagine not liking lucrative drops
---
As the beginner step to my efficent hcim guide said that 99 fm at WT is the beginning, I just laughed and started doing the things that I enjoy.
---
Well... actually. If Herb markets crashed, potions would follow, herblore would devalue and farming would devalue. Additionally potions crashing could affect the prices of loot from bosses that use a lot of potions as they would become more gp/h and so would be farmed more and so the loot would crash.   
---
Now i'm not saying that would happen but your comment makes no sense. Ofc adding mid level content can affect someone of a high level.
---
Something like 1/100 to receive something from the new drop table. 
---
Extremely rare drops from specific monsters is cool, like draconic visages from dragons/kbd, or sigils from corp, or crystals from cerb. Extremely rare drops from every monster isn't cool.
---
Two years down the drain for not even 1 months worth of rent money in California.
---
Dontcha just love that?
---
It was kind of ironic that they added huge herb drops on the same exact release as the farming guild. Same for the brews after the whole birdhouse debacle.
---
I don't mind the good drops but it shouldn't be noted supplies. To me that's against the spirit of the game. We have enough of them as it is.
---
There's a middle ground between 2500 brew drops (which happened all of one time, by the way) and cutting gp/hr by a whopping 30%
---
The problem definitely is on both sides. Jagex released a drop table with a rare chance of getting insane amounts of raw materials, surely knowing this would cause a backlash, but they did it regardless because of hype. The community reacts negatively to a few people with good rng and then jagex decides to nerf said content to the ground. We're all to blame and need to do better for the sake of the game we love.
---
Just becouse you play casually, doesn't mean the game shouldn't be carefully balanced, to avoid future problems.
---
Apreciation will come trough numbers playing the actual game, sucking their dick on reddit won't hell at all. In the other hand, with proper testing this would not be a thing. Even if they made it rare, someone made the wrong decision to implement it.
---
Problems need to be discussed, and everyone should care about their own dicks.
---
If you don't feel good about the trends of the sub, avoid it, or make your own post sucking ass, but don't pretend for everyone to be blindfold and ignore what is going on.
---
imagine having game integrity 
---
Reddit is Literally  overreacting, her slay table is almost the same just gives you in different locations, doing it at a different location can net extra drops, that will still make money just not as much as people on Reddit want 
---
You totally ignored drop chance and additional drop table adds. I understand now the people rolling around screaming about their drop table here now. You don't actually understand what was changed.
---
&gt; were complaining that the gp/hr...were too OP
---
Nobody complained about the gp/hr, they complained that skilling items were dropped, and that the rare drops were too rare and too high. If they made rare drops 20 torstols 10 times as often I don't think people would have complained.
---
So where the fuck does it say to link your account to your reddit?
---
rubies are also still on the reworked droptable, ur a fucking mongol, cut vertically next time cancer degenerate
---
if you cancel your contract she gives you the next tier down. she wont let you cancel an easy one
---
I got 4 drops valued at 250k then like 10 valued at 25k on day 1, only did konar for 8 hours until I got the hydra task, probably should not have been nerfed except for sara brews I thought it was fair and exciting when I got those initial 4 drops lol
---
Do OSRS player actually like pre-EoC Nex?
---
Bullshit, you worked in a pub year ago and now you're suddenly working as a game developer. Also, posting to /r/borrow to borrow money from time to time lfmao. 
---
Yeah the wiki says 1 day so sweet I’ll have mine tomorrow
---
Wierd fletch but ok
---
87
---
IT'S RARE SO IT'S BALANCED! - All the brainlet PvMers.
---
**They didn't nerf ToB when scythe went for 4B initially and a few people got it**
---
So why do it now?
---
wait, how did you get the red hydra to only have 1 head?
---
Tbf I doubt Konar's drop table took hundreds of hours. I don't even think the entirety of Konar took hundreds of hours.
---
From what I understand, without preserve you would need to log in and out every 30 seconds to maintain the boost. I'm not sure if preserve changes that, but to be safe, anything before 30 seconds and you should keep it.
---
except once the bond supply dries of from no one buying them from jagex they then skyrocket on price and people buy them again
---
Are you unironically pointing out 1k extra per kill is large?
---
Have you measured how many kills/hour you can get in an hour?
---
It's not more than 200-300, Konar may end adding up 400k gp/h to a abby demon or nechy task for example...
---
at the cost of slowing the kill/h potential by 3 or 4 times (no barraging in multi)
---
So you tell me how you apply the maths, you don't
---
If this stuff doesn't stack with slayer helm then whats the point? 
---
And Veronica, who doesn’t do any damage, but her gossip cuts to the quick of your soul.
---
What do you mean? You're telling me your job is not to sit at your desk and grind runescape for 10 hours a day every day?
---
Fuck Faux. Just because 1/3 of your life is runescape so you have time to actually grind out thousands of hours, doesn't mean everyone can afford to do the same. 
---
They spend minutes creating it, hundreds of hours masturbating.
---
I used to work at jagex, the corridors smelled like cum
---
The moment you relog the timer resets
---
that's exactly his point? He is pointing his finger at those who are screaching "dead content" like fucking retards because there was a nerf to the drop table. It isn't dead content, and probably wont ever be dead content. No one here complaining about the nerf are complaining because they will have less fun. Its because they wont get stupid rich off of a pure lucky drop table, so that makes it "less fun" and "dead content" to them.
---
just remove the 2500 sara brew drop
---
seriously why is that even in there
---
This is such a trivial thing to make a fun of... I love it. 
---
Missed oppurtunity for this slayer master. Could have made it so that when you kill monsters on her task you have a chance to get unique items from that specific monsters remains.
---
Like the tail of a unicorn or a turoths eyes. And then you can give that to her to get a gp reward, or craft new items from it. Fits better cause it makes sense in a slayer master - slayer apprentice  system. "Try to kill this, use my tips, kill it, get back with the loot" 
---
if you log in and out a lot, it resets the cycle
---
Yeah i also dont like him as a streamer. Nor a fellow osrs player. 
---
Dude if you spent less time writing novels on reddit you’d probably have the stats to kill the Hydra like Faux.  A mid level slayer task shouldn’t be the best gp in the game, pretty simple.
---
BiS is scythe, also where are you using whip in the rest of the raid?
---
Reddit: stop pretending to know game balance when you're simply upset you can't make easy money.
---
I agree they should have posted konar's rare drop table and have a vote on it, but it is all ready in the game and should be polled to change it.
---
Valid points but a high level player with a bil and best in slot everything could probably care less. I dont see how konar drops are any different from any of the raids content in terms of the items that came in to the game. 
---
Mind runes are also the fastest way to RC pet iirc. 
---
Jagex not listening to the players is what killed RS3.
---
how many fish drops have you gotten?? 1?? you know what that means?? insufficient sample size.
---
Yet the low level plebs still think the RDT was good how it was. All it takes is 1 second of actual thought to realize the RDT was terrible for the game
---
Yeah okay im getting 38 wc xp/h because I just chopped 1 oak tree then went to continue on ardy rooftops so chopping willows is 1000 times better than this. /s
---
It obviously assumes that you arent doing the content wrong or afking half the time, lmao.
---
ahh yes, you are much superior to the other retards who play Runescape
---
In my opinion it’s a pretty knee jerk reaction based on a vocal minority.
---
I did 10slayer Konar tasks last night and didn’t get shit. Months of planning an expansion and a total overhaul within 24hours LMAO
---
Jagex targets the 70s range as mid-level, we know this because they released Grotesque Guardians as a mid-level boss that's supposed to introduce players to more complex boss mechanics.
---
i’m 113.65 rn and only 71 prayer, with 77 i’ll be 114.something and all i’ll need is one or 2 attack lvls
---
He plays an iron man dosent he? How does any input he has on the economy matter?
---
Congrats!
---
Korasi.
---
Me
---
That’s overly pessimistic thinking. Pushing their own agenda is bollocks given they live of donations, not in game currency. The general immediate outcry is a reflex, not a generally held opinion. Later people started to realise Konar would be dead content without it and the opinion shifted, as did the general opinion among streamers. 
---
I’ve gotten Konar tasks I can cannon... 
---
My problem with the herbs was that you can introduce the same table but with seeds. The logs and ores I don't love either, but as you said it's rare enough that prices won't really be affected by that
---
Higher level players are lowlives? 50 years? What the hell are you on, mate? You're about to have an aneurysm because an update needs to be rebalanced.
---
Fashionscape is never dead content
---
So from what I've read they've took of saradomin brews and that's it, what else that's important has changed?  Has the frequency of getting the drop table changed? 
---
So long as they support osrs and mobile, they can take my money. 
---
Konar wasn't even close to being the best gp in the game? I have no idea what you're talking about but thanks for proving my point I guess.
---
The overall buff if you had a full set is more than the slayer helm's buff.
---
Nerf raids, too OP.
---
Seriously though, crazy luck, congrats 
---
Yeah it's just rng, you've just got unlucky. Your time will come, friend.
---
Lololol
---
Exactly. People complain they took years to nerf OP content previously. Now that they nerf this promptly (and can balance from there.. it might not stop where it is which people ignore), they are whinging saying wait more!
---
Who is faux?
---
Fucking hell, I’ll actually up vote you today.
---
I've been getting told it's 24 hours, some tell me 32 hours. Take it with a grain of salt until I figure out the true growth time. 
---
My irl friend scammed me a 76k trick back in the day 😂
---
He’s a troll. His opinions are never consistent and clearly meant to trigger people. 
---
jagex did stand by their prior decision to not flood skilling products on pvm drop tables.
---
putting brews, torstols, and other high level skilling products in stupidly high quantities was not in line with that statement. 
---
clip?
---
Haha I went back to the Sorcerers Garden mini game for thieving XP, is it the best? No but it sure is fun as shit
---
I love how instead of answering the question you just give the dude your opinion lmfao stfu crybaby
---
Your an idiot.
---
Yeah, and then you need 63 agil to get up the mountain quickly or else you have to run the whole mountain.
---
yeah... it actually was only my 2nd raid ModPodcast was teaching me... sorry :(
---
Some people really do need to be chained to a certain set of rules to enjoy things. That’s where ironman comes into play for those type of players. In order to do things they will be forced to be skillers, do things they don’t want to, etc. because they have no other choice.  It sometimes *does* take being chained down to enjoy things.
---
I didn't say that anywhere, but if you want to spend your hard earned money on that then you sure are. 
---
i agree with him, the karma system causes a hive mind, the most popular initial opinions often become the only opinion. you can see this on a lot of subs 
---
Why even watch this fuckwit?
---
Thanks for the info. Do you think I should consider getting a stronger weapon like a whip? My only reservation with it is no dedicated strength xp, but it has like 16 more str bonus over d scimmy. Sara sword seems like marginally better dps than scimitar + defender so probably wouldn't go for one and dagger just seems like a luxury at this point.
---
Yeah, hope his stream takes a hit for his BS.
---
No wonder half of them leave 
---
nice repost smh
---
Yes big boi my apologies 
---
Keep the flowers, you'll be saying something very similar to Konar soon enough.
---
As a skiller you chose to limit your gameplay to just fucking skilling. That is your choice. No update should be hindered because of the way one set of players feels about its devaluing their choice to already limit themselves... *cough ironmen cough*
---
Feels bad that all everyone’s talking about is some semi overtuned drop table instead of appreciation for an honestly great update
---
Wholeheartedly agree, changing to an iron man revitalised the magic of this game for me.
---
I now have no option but to do everything myself, and acquiring items, killing monsters, preparing for almost any aspect of the game is a completely different activity than it ever was before on a normal account.
---
It’s tough, but for me, worth it.
---
What in that table wasn't Generic loot -brews which were removed quickly?
---
Retard trap. It's like fishing lobsters from 40 to 99 fishing or something.
---
You have my downvote
---
AbusLve
---
5 months of dev work and 5 dollars is enough to buy a cup of coffee
---
Or don't skip half the drops and really do the maths. 
---
Cmd + shift + 4 gives you the built in Mac snipping tool. Saves to desktop 
---
Please see the drama about Cuphead's tutorial 
---
And I feel you should see many aspects of something before critiquing it as broken. I am referring to Faux saying the whole table is busted and the slayer master broken while only farming Hydra. 
---
Or don't focus on one drop and work it out?
---
never liked the guy until now, but i'll throw my twitch prime at him for standing up for the game's integrity when no-one else seems to give a shit
---
Don't really think having a 230m bank means I've got the coin for it but I just might do it..
---
d
---
My browsing history is only filled with the bigger youtubers for OSRS, and woodworking videos. This is a separate account I have for youtube so it doesn't even get used for google. I've been watching a bunch of videos recently and this is the first add I've ever seen in regards to runescape.
---
And after several hours only 1 person got it implying an incredibly low drop chance. like one in a million low.
---
For medium level players it makes 1million times more sense just to go back to Nieve now, as Konar's tasks have a decent chance of forcing you into dangerous areas just to slowly grind out the task with very little incentive, versus Nieve where you can just do the tasks wherever you want and overall make more profit and xp per hour.
---
did we ever leave?
---
I agree they over nerfed. But a nerf was needed and getting a circlejerk over a streamer because Jagex over compensated on nerf is the problem with this community where we decide to hate over making good ideas.
---
yeah i am with you with a little boost. 10 ranars is still nearing 100k but having it be 100-200 just takes them money away from farming and puts it on slayer. either way a large portion of the player base will be upset. same reason they removed limpwurt root drops from kurask. in the end they have to make the drop tables healthy for the long term. this also has really big longterm ramifications outside of just money per hour, if pray pots drop really low they will be way more frequently used which makes slayer itself faster and so on. this is all without knowing the actual rates of the drops though, but even with just one day of these drops in the game ranarrs are down like 1k. it may stablize itself in the end but i dont think jagex can take that chance. in the end the smartest thing to do is put a pause on it and then tweak the drops to a more healthy state and put them back.
---
&gt;But now everything will remain as it was but additional to that Konra joined the dead content team. Maybe a second though Jagex?
---
What?
---
just who gives a fuck? its a game. its all entertainment at the end of the day whether youre efficient or not. that's how i broke it.
---
The game needs something other then skilling items for monsters to drop. Makimg other parts of the game dead content so new content can exist is something the community always wanted to avoid and is a contributing rs3 dying 
---
exactly my point, brother
---
You are more than welcome to find your way to the skilling methods discord and see for yourself. Anyone who can do bossing slayer, vorkath, raids, tob etc is not doing herb runs because its a waste of time and money for them. Are they not playing the game? Herb runs are only good money for mid level players who can't do any of that.
---
Nah, diary, slayer points and a rare drop is a lil bit too much imo. Besides theres too much in the slayer points list as it is (i dont liek herb sack being on there).
---
Oh god can you imagine, that would be pretty stupid.
---
Asides from my best friend who I've known my whole life, I don't think I'd give $1000 to anyone. Especially if I only knew them from the internet.
---
I think Faux did this with the Negative XP Lamps back when they were being polled. Told his viewership to vote no because he had a pure he ruined and didn't get the chance to fix his when he made the mistake. Don't really care about Faux spreading his opinion to his viewers a lot of people do. Kinda sucks one person can be given that kind of power just through popularity.
---
I had a question on a history test requiring the written defiention of a ‘Nomad’. Therefore, brought me back to the old soul wars Nomad, meaning ‘wandering traveler’. Oh man runescape teaches more than any parents would ever know 😊
---
A level 93 shouldn't be able to make as much off slayer as a level 126 just because they hit a broken drop table. Get out of here with the notion that you shouldn't have to work hard to get rich. Either get smart and learn how to make passive income or work your ass off and get some levels to get the consistant income you want.
---
It does devalue Skilling. Maybe not heavily but theres definitely an impact. The subreddit has been complaining about Skilling being replaced by pvm for years.
---
The fact that the drops were rare doesnt have any relevance here. I just think alchables always make more sense than mass resource drops 
---
The fact that it was even on there shows how little planning went into this drop table. You shut up.
---
Yeah probably took me 45 or so without guides and with reading all the quest dialogue. They were short and solid like my dinger
---
ya god forbid i get a lot of dlegs, that would rly fuck the economy over and devalue my dleg farming alt at wyverns. revs was super broken.
---
I actually did unfollow faux after all this. The guy acted all smug and high horse during his whole stream, while at the same time turning it into an even bigger echo chamber. 
---
go back to rotmg bro
---
4M per person
---
Lol stop buying gold and they will stop appearing 
---
Overreacting
---
Reddit: WTF this droptable is WAY too bad, DEAD CONTENT!
---
Also reddit: Yes, skillers should be a major resource income, not slayers.
---
Does the term “extremely rare” mean anything to you? 
---
Is this a meme?
---
To be fair, this meme was about his very open opinion about the RDT, not him causing it.
---
You're a legit retard.
---
the points and hydra task mainly. The drops are also still there and decently valuable
---
Yes, it does have an impact, but if the chance is low enough it should be like a drop of water in an ocean.
---
Sparc mac is my last hope (Please don't tell me he has iron men too)
---
Did you blur out the leprechaun. Also Gz
---
Explain
---
he dm'd one jmod (gambit) about confirming the brew drop (which was later confirmed by ash to not even be in the game anymore), and that was about it.
---
Thanks, would have been useful 3 days ago
---
But Jagex came up with that first drop table on their own. Despite that, you think they should stop polling players. I seriously doubt the contents of that first table would have passed a poll.
---
He does lol
---
1,300,000,000 in Bonds at 3,000,000 a piece is about 433 bonds needed, so at $7 a bond it translates to about $3,031 so if you wanted that much in bonds it would cost you around $3,000...holy fuck dude, sry man. I lost 14m to skull trickers in wild and was pacing my living room muttering so i cant quiet imagine how you feel lol
---
I’m confused... what happened?
---
The camera doesn’t focus on the fakes. Thank you :) 
---
Which one?
---
I was waiting for this comment
---
Y tho
---
I meant archeology as the next skill. 
---
I didn’t really read past the first few sentences but are you complaining about the fact the games growing?
---
Exactly this, they gave it a single day and only went by the couple of posts of people getting the rare drops on the front page. If 20,000 people start doing the new slayer master assignments we’re obviously going to see a bunch of rare drops during that time. Look at the Hydra for example, not that many people can do it with its 95 slayer requirement and still there were a bunch of posts yesterday of people already getting the pet. If it were more accessible to people and we saw that many posts of pet drops, everyone would think it’s so easy to get the pet. 
---
Also fuck Faux.
---
Q 
---
Celastrus seeds are now 400k each
---
Yeah as long as jagex are willing to tweak it, I don't think herbs are a good idea either personally I much rather would have had some unique items on the drop table and then there's not even a problem of it devaluing farming and prayer pots and shit like that. But either way, now I don't really have an incentive to use her so back to duradel
---
I can see your stand point from a normal account, but I look at it from an iron man view. So that 1m profit an hour means actually nothing to me. 200 herbs from a random slayer kill on the other hand is extremely op.
---
Same here! I had that task as well, it was cool to know about.
---
I have not noticed a massive change in gp/h before and after the coldfix. Y'all need to calm the fuck down 
---
Was waiting for that. The one without barrows gloves 😂
---
Maxed players who are disgusted at the thought of mid level content
---
Telling people to shut up on the internet like you're so much smarter. 
---
The issue is that it was on the table in the first place. Someone consciously put an absurd drop, agreed that it was a bit much when called out, and took the whole table into reconsideration. That is smarter than leaving something potentially broken in.
---
Just go in to enjoy playing the game.
---
If you're waking up going 'Oh man I gotta grind out those last 72 black demons for slayer' before you even touch your PC, you've already fucked up. 
---
Ah yes, let us replace 1 straw man, with another...
---
The argument was never "300k from hounds is too much!!!!" it was ALWAYS the brews/herbs drop being waayyyyyy too much RSS....
---
TIL farming runs are op and have to be nerfed /s
---
They are supposed to have progressive servers that will continue to add content and expansions. The reason WoW died is because it became so casual. I think it’s going to be like RS and you’ll see more people on classic. 
---
The points just mean she will be used for 10th task farming. Also unless you have thousands of points saved for skips you aren't going to cycle through her trash tasks for hydras. 
---
Mine have increased.
---
He shouldnt be getting swords at 81 fishing since it scales
---
Not so sure about that one my bro
---
I suggest only max accounts can vote in polls. 
---
The mid level argument is something I hadn't seen and honestly as a 84 cmb person she's such a blessing over that fairy bitch in fariyland. 
---
Explain why it’s dead content
---
But .. if jagex listens to us now screaming revert the changes, they listened to reddit AGAIN. They’re in a lose lose situation atm, change the drops they seem indecisive, don’t change the drops and they seem bad at balancing
---
So far I'm on 46 KC but not been lucky yet, keeping at it and rocking in Karils. 
---
exactly
---
Didn't read past the past few words, but we both know that you did.
