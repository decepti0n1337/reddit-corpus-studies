this has always happened, especially when jagex thinks a good idea to add shit like korasi

Pollnivneach and Nardah were added sometime after KQ, as was Sophanem itself and most of the quests south of Al Kharid.
---
It's still definitely a big area that has gotten no special updates exclusive to OSRS, besides the rooftop courses :/
---
I like it, what if you had some kind of stamina bar and you could chose the ability from multiple?
---
Gotta say, glad the golden gnome was awarded here. By Release is a great series and I feared it would be completely overshadowed by the swampguy, but both creators getting some recognition 
---
is even better.
---
Yeah exactly. And I don't know that I could enjoy another leveling grind from him in mory so no sense in starting over. I don't think he would anyway. Imagine doing the temple treks and hunter grind again.
---
i read your username and thought i posted this lmfao
---
Thank you
---
they’ll have a different symbol don’t worry your pixel recognition is safe
---
Ya, people suggest thieving as an afk skill all the time....
---
Thought that said r6 for a sec.  was going to rampage
---
Don’t think I saw that anywhere in the details though.
---
This changes everything.

You can't lose your skull at the minigame portals anymore. Quickest way now is to just suicide.

Do you play a regular Ironman?

You said that already, now you’re being a weirdo

they will. and even if they don’t. who cares ironmen play for themselves.

Will eventually be released when the Morytania League comes out in 2020.

Thanks wasn't positive on rate just saw that on the wiki!
---
Indeed, but still worthy asking/noting something if it devalues an entire groups accomplishments. That’s all.
---
It's silly but makes sense at the same time.
---
&amp;#x200B;

The biggest groups that this will be popular with is streamers and really hardcore players. The streamers are a huge source of publicity for them, and this basically gives them an excuse to restart and provide a wealth of "new" content. The really hardcore players will make 2-5 accounts of their own and play while multi-logging, which means Jagex gets 2-5 new subscriptions). In both cases, it's a win-win for all parties involved (Streamers get new content for their streams, hardcore gamers get a new way to play ironman in a kind of interesting way, Jagex gets publicity and a whole bunch of new accounts paying for membership).
---
For the average player tho... Yeah, it's not really adding much to the game since it'd be difficult to find a team of people where someone doesn't quit a few months in.
---
I agree. I suggested a Couriers guild to change up how agility works a little.

man i can proudly say i am. i’m currently in bed with youtube phenomenon, teenage sweetheart, PvP extraordinaire Framed, and my first Runescape Festival went really swell. Today, I went to the little place and met more people, and started the day off with an interview with Mod Gambo and Mod Kieran. I was a little nervous at first, but ended up making a funny punchline with the simple response of “sure” regarding the toxicity of the community. Also, I gotta be honest... RuneFest burritos? Dangerous game to play. Had one at around 1pm, had to make a pit stop to the hotel around 1:45pm for a wild ride. After that, the day went pretty smoothly. Met more people, didn’t get interrupted by the host again, had a Diet coke, and went back to the hotel. Then we went to the “Influencer Bar” downstairs, and laughed harder than I have in months talking with YouTuber EVScape. He’s one of the funniest people I have ever met and it’s a god damn shame we’re on opposite sides of the world. I sat around with Torvesta, Sick Nerd, and Framed and talked about PvP for awhile despite being dog shit at it, and then felt like I was dreaming given the situation I found myself in. I’ve had breakfast with Alkan/Mr Mammal/Soup, hugged B0aty, had lunch with C Engineer, roasted Skiddler to his brother, questioned DitterBitter’s accent three times, and told Mod Gambit about his alter ego, Mod Gambo, that only comes out after 11pm. It was a fantastic fucking day, and one of the best weekends of my entire life. Thank u for asking me
---
Kind of sad to sit there and say fuck rendi the sore loser, you can have your opinions but going out of your way to spread hate to him kind of makes you the sore loser
---
Wait i missed it. Did he cure cancer? Bring utilities to a 3rd world country?
---
Oh no he jus pissed in bottles for 9 months thats right
---
I think maybe you have that backwards. the community shoots down a lot of updates.
---
Good, 95% of them are bots anyway
---
Jesus christ, yeah, I'd say you're ready to be a member
---
Mmg also brought in mtx.
---
Because swamp man good! But seriously, the community knows what Rendi gives them, and we all respect his content, dedication, and emotions whether good or bad
---
Group ironman without a hardcore and different game mode which involves pking is dumb imo.
---
The best money maker in the game is basically group only (solo tob doesnt count lmfao) and group raids 1 is considerably more popular than solo raids 1
---
And what is wrong with that? Nothing.
---
I agree with this actually. Hopefully getting my black graceful will be more fun ^^
---
All margins ruined
---
That doesn’t answer my question though. What do you consider to be worthwhile new content? Clearly you have some preconceived notions about what that looks like. 
---
Saying the Leagues are just replaying existing content seems incredibly disingenuous as it disregards the fact that the fundamental rules of the game are being changed due to different experience rates and additional flexibility in builds/approaches introduced by the unlockable buffs and, in my personal opinion, that it provides a cool opportunity to do a deep dive on the content within a specific region and experience the process of building up a character under a slightly modified framework. 
---
Pulling up a guide and blasting through every new quest in 20 minutes with your hand clamped down on the space bar is on you - if that’s how you play you are voluntarily choosing not to interact with that content to its fullest extent.  
---
Why would we not be excited about a new and potentially more fun method of training one of the more boring skills in the game? Seriously, what the fuck do you think this game is? Monotonous training of skills *is* most of the content (or monotonous bossing or clueing or whatever). 
---
If you want dozens of hours of completely original content unlike anything that already exists in the game then maybe what you need is a new game to play. From your criterion (several hours of engagement, not related to existing content, novel gameplay changes beyond stuff like relics in Twisted League) what could possibly make you happy? A new skill maybe? EoC?

I think the fact the camera panned to B0aty &amp; co about 8 times when they were talking about Group Ironman just sums it up. I really don’t think it’s gonna be as good as people think.

A regular account owned by the ironman PKer can pick up the loot after the kill though.
---
&gt;Mods aren't experienced in public speaking and there's often awkward silence, a bunch umms, yeahs and repetitive talking.
---
But that's what I like. It's real. It's not some fake "YALL DRUNK YET?! LESS GET MOAR DRINKS!" bullshit.
---
Yeah I accidentally put an extra 0 in there, fixed it
---
You had me at bird eggs. Getting the evil chicken outfit done in the collection log is a ridiculous feat.
---
For real though, this looks like an interesting concept. I always thought Artisan was lackluster as a standalone skill, but working it into this would fix that.

Utilizing some of the cool decorative objects that already exist to lighten the workload. Interested to see some other reward ideas to add to this.

Thank you I love you

Started as a movement to help guys with porn addiction and turned into a bizarre cult that makes members think not cumming gives them superpowers.
---
I'm not really interested in any of the reveals :/
---
Don't get me wrong though; Morytania expansion is more content, people have requested a better clan system, and group ironman was also widely requested.
---
man i love that guy and he loves me

mfw literal mid level players are acting like they know what top level content is

Maybe if he would have spent 121 hours he would have won. 
---
lol oof
---
I got mine around 90 farming from seaweed
---
They did the right thing adding a group boss instead. I’m really surprised it’s just 1 though. As someone who plays both raids there isn’t need for a third one yet. CoX &amp; ToB still get regularly played, they’re both great. They will likely announce it next year which I’ll be fine with.
---
I think it’s gonna take our boy several more months to beat ToB
---
Then you can appreciate the grind it is, at least to some extent. The amount of work you do is significantly more as an Ironman for the same results as a normal account, so having teammates to reduce that grind is still greater than playing solo as a normal imo. I will say though that teams of 5 are a bit much. 3 should be the baseline min/max
---
Dream place bad. Swamp man good?

ur not a loser and if she ever thinks that leave her in the dust

This is amazing I hope you have as much fun as I and many others did when first joining members— I remember the joy of finally being able to tele to Camelot!! Best of luck :)

Also how many hours did rc take? You’ll probably really enjoy abyss/astral runecrafting (then arceuus blood rc at 77)
---
Deserter Treasure
---
And its sequel, Desertest Treasure
---
Do quests, so many quests. Waterfall, desert treasure, fairy tale 1, monkey madness, and recipe for disaster are all good kid level goals to work towards.
---
Well, if I'll ever be able to upload my mind into a fantasy world of my own making where I have a gf that plays osrs, then I'll be able to do group btw =D
---
Don't need a clip just a phrase
---
"you guys need more drinks"
---
Yes we do if we have to deal with you counstantly shouting
---
I like that idea, or have it be that the new account must reach a certain total level so they cant skip the early grind
---
So exactly like the dragonbone necklace which is dead content?
---
Not necessarily, if there's a shared bank it wouldn't be needed.
---
It'd be dope if they *shared* one house
---
What methods do you use to try to get the pet?
---
I think it should be something else, not torture
---
Bro I didn't even connect this thread chain to Swampletics until you said the name and suddenly it clicked. I was like "wtf are they talking about" and I religiously watch the guy. I think it's sneaky enough and super cheeky.

Upper level fixes that problem

I think you just articulated how I’ve felt for years about the desert. Just makes me feel weird.

This drunk guy insulted my friend so I cut his tongue out. That certainly isn't wrong of me because I was defending my friend from a drunk. Get some life experience, please. -You, probably.

At this point I only exclusively use bonds.

I thought his inferno services were pretty well known, but apparently not seeing the other comments
---
Well, I mean technically yeah.
---
I've got a random alt I mess around on now and then and it's only been a member 3 or 4 times but it's always been with a bond
---
I was thinking of making a group ironman with one friend where we both do 2 accounts and have a 5th one in the event that we find another person to pls rs with...

Don’t be so dramatic

I think you're being trolled because he's openly gay. He just doesn't mention it much.

I disagree, I've been playing with the same group of people for 4-5 years and if we all stay interested in the game I don't see how another 4-5 isn't possible

Buddy you're complaining about mid-high level content with BIS gear. It's 2019 you have plenty of time from now to when the update is released to train your account, do raids, make money train your stats to get the required reqs. I'm sick and tired of all these players complaining about every single thing. I completely understand you might not have the time maybe due to IRL stuff, work or whatever to level up your stats but then if thats the case don't even bother posting a comment like this. Just saying...
---
Hopefully once morytania updates get finished up with the desert will give them some content to work on in the future. I have a feeling thats going to be their next focus given raids 3 in the 2020-2021 range. I expect mid next year the desert will get a lot of attention.
---
same! OP seriously. this aact is something worth keeping as is
---
The trick is finding some engaging content to watch/listen to and then letting the agility grind fall in to the background of your conscious
---
Only 60 slayer for a bis helmet. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Everybody is a "sore loser" to differing extents. Nobody wants to lose, especially when it's something you put a lot of time, effort and skill into. I think all this situation shows is people should keep less of their thoughts on Twitter. Being mad about losing is completely fine,  but complaining about it publicly is where it causes problems.
---
&gt;ironman
---
&gt;trade
---
I think he RWTed. Only reasonable conclusion
---
Not giving the boss a pet ensures its dead content, and mid levels are just as entitled to pet chances as high level players, the uniques would have dropped to the current level nearly as quickly given the cudgel is far from bis and there were heaps of free worlds once the hype died down after a few days.
---
I tried to get it back. After another 1m xp, I stopped lol. 
---
I died going afk on a slayer task for too long
---
They needed upkeep with onyx’s to maintain the effect. These require nothing. Vote no
---
All fun and games until one person trains 4 accounts at once getting 4x xp rates.
---
all shit
---
I saw a few people at twitchcon wearing one of those fannypacks like a shoulder bag. Is it like a new fashion thing?
---
Is it better for me to save for Rigour or DHCB? On the one hand, Rigour is usable everywhere and will significantly help my ranged, but on the other hand DHCB can help be grind for Rigour at Vorkath.
---
Yeah, quests are a great way to introduce you to all the new kingdoms you now are open to adventure.
---
I know 1 guy who plays osrs and he plays half as much as me. Putting off OP's argument is dumb
---
What does "Corp like" mean?
---
Technically soloable of absurd amount of stat draining is applied, but ment as a group boss?
---
If it were up to most people everything would be a rare boss drop even if it's low level. There's more to this game than slayer. Also you can kill mobs to get blood shard too, it isn't exclusively thieving.
---
At this point, even a shoreline would be nice, rather than a giant hole in the world. That said, in addition to menaphos as a confirmed place that already exists in game and is empty, the desert area has rich lore with ample opportunity for expansion.
---
It’s always salty crying butthurt kid blah blah this is literally the most harmless pking meme I think I’ve ever seen on this sub and you still gotta get defensive lmfao
---
Reposts on Reddit? What is the world coming to!

It’s hard to require a multiple thousand dollar commitment for people who live overseas, and economically it wouldn’t make sense for Jagex to pay for everyone who gets nominated to come.

Most grizzlies are actually pussies.

Little known bear fact.

Edit: replied to wrong person lol.

I needed to hear this thank you
---
These dudes are nerds irl an a bit strange ofc they are gonna do weird shit when on the spot light, there nobodies in the scheme of things just some moderators devs to a popular game that they happen to get lucky an revive. Rs3 is dead osrs keeping jagex in business
---
That's the point of banning all 3rd party clients it's easier to verify one official client. Cheating will always happen but it's always going to be easier will stuff like this
---
You might say it’s a... content desert
---
You think group ironman is being polled? lmao.
---
It's not new game content. It's a game mode addition, not even a full new game mode. It's coming to the game and people have been waiting over 4 years for it. It was talked about so damn long ago but completely abandoned for at least 2 years until now.
---
If you're planning to camp vorkath, then dhcb. If not, then rigour. 
---
Keep in mind rigour is half the price, so you can get it earlier. DHCB is more expensive but you can actually sell it back if you decide you don't like vork.
---
A lot of them are buying mood accounts or renting them so they don’t get banned or they can ban the competition.
---
Corp is a group boss that doesn't lock out ironmen. But yeah I agree with you regardless
---
Good Post Jim, but get back to work on your next episode.
---
I need to hear the sweet lyrics you're cooking up for your next multi-platinum rap hit.
---
Because staking is terrible for the game, since it's one of the primary causes of rwt, which in turn leads to botting/gold farming.
---
REEE OTHER PEOPLE PLAYING HOW THEY WANT SOMEHOW DEVALUES HOW I WANT TO PLAY
---
If there weren't people buying gp to stake, a lot less gp would come into the game in the first place.
---
It gives 99 slayer? Guess I gotta get 55 rc.
---
Edit : are people really taking this shitpost seriously?
---
We have the best devs goddamn

YES, mad support for the birbs 😈🖤 love the shading 👊👊

Perhaps he didn't realise Rendi was being legitimate in being extremely poor taste.

Slower xp rates because you're hitting 5s against rocks
---
You misread that. You mine a stackable and untradeable thing, that is converted into essence. It doesn't say anywhere the essence is stackable, it says it gives 50% more xp.
---
The process of mining it, converting and banking it, and then using it for RC is essentially taking what made Zeah method popular and updating the rest of the levelling with a similar method. It won't be faster overall, but it will make the runecrafting portion of the training feel faster.
---
Read the suggestions a bit better, and plus they don't even come into game exactly how they suggest. It's polled content..
---
??? you can tell by how many upvotes this got that a majority of reddit users are not from the same era im from, no wonder i disagree with so much of the shit on here xD, anyone that played before 2008 hated the graphical change, if they even added this absolute dogshit as an option id dip out of:)
---
Very hot and dry place valuables

Thank you I'm dumb

Well yea, the uniques are shit though.

You just gave Jagex an idea...

2 are billing, 7 are Jagex literally begging him to join the Player Moderator team - if only he knew!
---
KQ sucks though. The only reason to do it is for diaries or pet, and the only reason to do the elite diary is to do more KQ.
---
If I'd known writing it out would have meant not reading your stupid ass comment I would have.
---
Literally the same here
---
Alright responsibility yeah. It sounded good until the last lines where he said

"But lil smokey did deserve the award"
---
He kind of regresses in his statement saying "I was wrong, but I am also right!"
---
You remember those old memes where it's like noon&lt;me&lt;no life. This is pretty much the same thing. 
---
"Can you imagine the gross nerd that plays more than 3 accounts at one time? No thanks, I'll stick to three accounts and actually have a life" - you probably
---
Is this because you have no friends to play with?
---
I can't wait to play! Just need some friends first.
---
i still wonder why at your 2nd channel at video titled REAL Swamp Montage had kid videos as recommended despite i was logged (and somebody else in comments seem to had same issue) https://twitter.com/Kiina_RS/status/1170592206115233792/photo/1 but it seems to be fixed now https://i.imgur.com/Yp9xkzQ.jpg not sure if you did anything.

You cannot stop people from buying/selling gold, at least with the tax there is a benefit for the game.
---
Pkers would actually want ancient curses to be added because it means there would be more people at the chaos altar and green/lava dragons. That would the best wilderness revitalization update they never asked for.
---
Actually annoyed the living shit out of me when she went on these random rambles. They've done it before, bring in some professional presenter for RuneFest that knows jackshit about RS, and it was a failure as well. I just don't get it, there's plenty of competent mods at Jagex that could have hosted this with Mod Shauny/Mark.
---
I started playing in 2007 and actually got back into rs 2 years later because of the graphical update. Not everyone shares your opinion.
---
Most of runescape aint a chllenge yet we enjoy it homie
---
hey you! you should add me, i am an Hardcore Ironman.. ill play with you though + i do have members.. whats your username?
---
hey jimmy did you kiss swamp man
---
A lot of people only buy gold to stake, so if you remove staking then you do stop people from buying gold lol
---
super random dawg but yeah i just added tags
---
That's the dumbest response in this entire thread. It wouldn't surprise me if you were thick enough to make that conflation for real. Kudos for that.
---
Streamer girl : Selling bath water
---
God Ash : Hold my teabag
---
My opinion: completely disagree. Me and my friend group I play with have all wanted group ironman mode since it was speculated. We all had mains before ever thinking about irons. And we've all started irons but relatively soon after dropped them because it removed any interaction we could have with friends.
---
This allows the best of both worlds. Saying no one will play it long-term is the same nonsense people said about how HCIM would be a dead mode in 6 months. People enjoy different ways to play the game, especially in official capacity.
---
If anything I see leagues as being more like this. I don't see too much joy in starting over and dedicating time on an account that will disappear, just to earn some cosmetics in the next limited mode. But streamers and content creators will eat that shit up.
---
🦀 remove non members items 🦀
---
I can't wait to play group Ironman with my friends and end up being a solo Ironman after they all lose interest
---
The lack of updates is a good thing. I wouldn't want to play a game that gets constantly overhauled.
---
I would make friends to play it if I didn't need to pay for another accounts membership yo do so.
---
What's meant by giving tree here?
---
Y tho. You could've gotten like 34 rc in that timeframe...
---
I agree because you just described me ;)
---
Please no. I would like some bosses to actually be free once in awhile not a fan of turmoil and soul split together.... aka lets just never leave a boss. pair it with justiciar and you may as well just kiss the inferno challenge good bye
---
Shit I was running through the desert for a clue today and had that thought. It’s so big and so empty. It would be nice to see some new content there.
---
But it wouldn't take that long for the **content devs** to release a new clan system and group ironman? I mean, most of the work behind these updates lies with the engine team and other departments. Maybe they rather want to focus on smaller/medium-sized content in between like revamping existing content or whatever player suggestions that constantly will appear.

&gt;It's not "pandering" if Jagex is giving the majority of players what they want?
---
They have done surveys/polls in the past and desert was always more popular than Myreque.
---
&gt;Besides, Morytania is unfinished, just like Menaphos is.
---
Morytania doesn't look like this: https://i.imgur.com/oLL0arI.png
---
I seriously doubt Jagex will issue any bans for using Runelite before Runelite has a chance to talk to the devs. They Runelite devs are currently unsure of which plugins are against the rules since there's room for interpretation.
---
That said, the official policy is that using third party clients is at your own risk. I will be.

If racism is bad and jokes that rely upon racist tropes are inherently racist, then those jokes are also bad, and I’m proud to draw that line and fight for more conscientiousness in our everyday parlance. But that is not a line that need be drawn, since it’s the only logical outcome of the facts, which anybody who actually cares to employ critical thought and empathy can conclude for themselves.

Sick nerd streams ironman for people, Sparc mac streams content that thousands of players join in on.

Damn dude you really should quit and go the fuck outside. Holy shit what the fuck do you do all day besides playing RS for 16 hours a day?
---
Yes it is. 100% dmg reduction from combat, 25% increase in accuracy/dmg/defense in Melee/Magic/Ranged, etc.
---
It’s huge for combat.
---
That mofo chinchompa. He cute af.
---
So you sold your account and wanted some free money, recover it and have some extra gp (from the acc buyer thats now on your acc) and your plan failed? Rip.

U know rs3 promised the world to shift the focus off mtx complaints right? Way to fall for the propaganda.

---
as someone still opposed to most of those. Fuck the "overloads" we have not a fan, bonecrusher is fine, rapier is pretty nerfed from what it was. and no we do not have subjugation and range turmoil we have rigour and augury from the normal prayer book as they exist in rs3. Subjugation and ranged turmoil are not what we have.
---
Probably already been said, but with Chambers of Xeric coming out in 2017, and the Theatre of Blood in 2018, I was really hoping for a new Raids-esque announcement. I have no doubt the proposed updates will be enjoyed by many, but maybe Jagex will see the requests and deliver sooner rather than later on a “Raids 3.”
---
That’s not even mentioning PvP and account security being kind of ignored in the big announcements..
---
What’s the point of adding the daelyt ore/essence, having it give %50 more xp but then the entire process being worse off than actual rc? Dead content before it’s even in the game.
---
Damn Jagex HQ looks great. I’m glad my $11 is going somewhere.

All of the troops.

Both sides.

Did they release a date estimate? Wouldn't be surprised if its not out by next RF.
---
Man, Jody taking OSRS accounts now. That monster
---
It just doesn’t make sense that they would steal all of my rune equipment and then leave more gold than my equipment was worth. I can go buy everything back and I’ll still have lots of gold to spare.
---
There’s plenty of content being added this year. It would be overwhelming to add menaphos as well imo
---
awful lot of us retards here eh?
---
i don't hate other players, i hate having to rely on and plan around them.
---
osrs used to be the game to pick up and play while making good progress whenever, without having to have a team available or plan around/make schedules etc.
---
I did natures through the abyss all the way to 77, never got PK'd once. Go on a total level world if you can, nobody wants your half-charged glory.
---
So you put in hundreds of hours, and your buddy afk/dc/suicides and everyone gets fucked? Thats the point of that?
---
No it didn't. Original design offered more tabs and item tagging
---
How about a desert oasis temple populated by men-scorpions?
---
hell yeah. 45k RC xp. nice, the buff we been needing.
---
Anyone who plays osrs has brain damage. Amirite fellas?
---
Still not too much to care about for ~~snowflake~~ sandcorn ironmen, which was the setting I meant. Also GP is irrelevant on a desert-locked ironman when the agility pyramid exists.
---
🦀 upvoted for potential mod smackdown 🦀
---
So I keep starting to play and dropping the game. I want to get into it and just enjoy it like I did years ago. Suggestions on getting me hooked back in?
---
Edit: Is the solution to go full Ironmeme? The more I watch UIM players the more it seems like a blast.
---
literally what do you prayer for other than combat
---
this made me laugh harder than it should have
---
Wine glass or really large meth pipe for the slayer grind?
---
Black graceful AND a new method of training agility that isn’t boring.
---
Rainbow because no homo
---
Also on osrs wiki membership bond theres a chart, april 2015 a bond was 1060k gp sold average, some sold for less some more.
---
Congratulations. Your videos are some of the best and most humorous content ever for me. You add a truly humorous narrative to the RuneScape quest line that I feel really drives home what I enjoy about this game. Thank you for every video you make. You're so awesome. Hell yeah!
---
I agree, most (if not all) of the rewards should be eastern-themed. This is a boss from the Eastern Lands, one of the most hyped areas. 
---
I disagree on the idea that this should have tier 80 gear. Instead, rewards should be filling niches in the game not yet explored. Making higher tier items encourages a constant evolutionary battle between players and content (think how the basilisk nerf was solely because high level players could kill them with ease) and makes it difficult to balance new content without making crazier, higher reaction-time mechanics.
---
That said, Dual wield katanas a la Torags would be really cool. Also, they would give the samurai outfit a new weapon slot for fashionscape.
---
Just out of curiosity, did you get an email stating that you had changed your email and in the email did it show you the email your account was changed too? In the same email it will ask if you were the one who made the change and if not to click the link to revert the changes, was this the email you got? 
---
If this is the email you received it's not legit and was a phishing email to obtain your Info. More or less was used to get your real Runescape password by redirecting you to an exact replica of the rs website but when you sign in it send the info to the said hacker. If your rs accounts password was the same as your email they likely logged into your email to accept any email change requests to actually changed your email then deleted the emails and left your email password the same to not indicate it was tampered with. 
---
I've been getting these emails for the past year and have been ignoring them. Jagex wouldn't disclose the email it was changed to in any form of email ever. Hoping this wasn't the case but thought I'd ask as I've been so close to falling for them.
---
I don’t know if you’ll see this, but I wasn’t clear on the news post? To make or join a clan does the account have to be freshly made or can you make one on an old account?
---
this was a wonderful thing to read on a sleepless night in a country i don’t live in, thank you for this
---
Hey there’s also people like me who play entirely too much for 2 months, burn out and quit for 6 months before being bored one day and getting sucked back in
---
Was that announced?
---
2018 was a huge year for OSRS. They don't need to put out big updates constantly; slow &amp; steady is healthy for long term growth. If Runefest 2020 is also slow then we have a trend and I could understand the worry, but considering Raids 3 will probably be announced then I don't see any issues.
---
Just make it so the action of linking accounts together in a group is a one time thing for each account. If you want to take part in a new group, make another account
---
It’s fascinating how stupid you are. It’s like you’ve been playing RS3 for a week.
---
Emails can be faked to come from jagex all phishing emails I get are coming from the same email jagex sends me updates and real password change/2fa requests from.
---
What are the fastest ways to make gp in the game today?  Bonds are almost twice as expensive as last time I was playing early this year but my moneymaking methods are about the same rate...
---
Lol I bet hes back
---
Nice.
---
I see no reason why we need a stronger version of a Blood Fury in OSRS. A Blood Fury would actually make more sense since then you'd have to trade some offensive stats to gain a healing effect.
---
The fact that you can have that much information about the account and still get your appeals denied is insane. I hope it all gets sorted out.
---
NGGHH Nghh...I'm gonna coom! IM COOMING AT LIGHTSPEEDDD
---
COOOMMIINNGGG IM COOOMMMIINNGGGG HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM GOING SUPER COOOOOOOOOOOOOM
---
That's because in the past there have been many people with convincing story's until a jmod came in and said otherwise.
---
Sounds dope tbh
---
Wrong. "Desert treasurer"
---
I actually spend some time in a clan chat but don’t pay attention to a lot of the conversation because I’m watching YouTube or Netflix or browsing reddit on my other monitor. It’s just so easy to not pay attention
---
The streamers he called out were because they helped ironman mode gain traction before it was an official mode. Pretty low iq to say group is catered to streamers in any way
---
He kinda does!
---
Ever since I made my iron, my main is a full time rune drags bond slave
---
A potentially worrying trend, indeed. Let's hope for a good 2020 for both games.
---
But its good if you want to farm capes for pet
---
Rookie mistake
---
I have over 1000 hours sunk into this game. It's a little fucking ridiculous that my stats are *still* not what all you twitter neets would consider good enough.
---
I don’t play HS, but watched that and read the comments and honestly couldn’t get if people were making fun of the dude or the host. If it’s him, I think it’s a bit mean cause he’s obviously very shy and might have social anxiety.
---
it just says  **EMAIL ADDRESS RESET COMPLETED**  
---
You have successfully changed the registered email address for your RuneScape and Old School RuneScape account.  
---
Your account log-in details remain unchanged but your registered email address for all future password resets will be (guys email here)
---
Sounds pretty bitchin actually.
---
yes please
---
I can do that also.... but opposite. 
---
My 3 hydras pet does it around me
---
i already hate going there enough as it is....
---
When he gives you that look
---
Can confirm. Not quite 2 weeks, but recently did a grind from like 50 to 70 at barbarian fishing, and it was hell. People complain about runecrafting and agility, but at least you can do things during that. The only saving grace is its AFK to an extent.
---
I feel like you made this meme awhile ago and just dropped it.
---
Jagex: what did you say? Even more treasure *hunter*? Right on it!
---
i must agree. i kinda feel like the time is completely wasted. although apparently it was gonna come with the clan rework anyway so maybe its not that bad
---
This madman brought mantas to mf bloodvelds
---
If you spam submit recovery attempts the account gets locked, it won't let you log in. Jagex never sends emails with the full new account email address. If you received one with that information, and then clicked it, you were certainly hacked via the email after they had your account locked.
---
LMAO
---
True, the rapier is nerfed from RSHD which is what I mean by taking old RSHD content and ADAPTING it to oldschool. Old Chaotic Rapier had a strength bonus of 101 which is on par with the barrelchest anchor and had the same stab bonus as current Ghrazi.
---
Also OS rigour is better than RS3 Anguish so...yeah. Current RS3 Rigour is +8 range attack and +8% range damage whereas OS rigour is fucking +20% range attack and +23% range damage. Current RS3 Anguish (level 95 ranged turmoil btw) is still only +10 range attack and +10% range damage. EVEN STILL, the new level 99 super ranged turmoil, Desolation is only +12 attack and +12% damage. So yeah.
---
Also Ancestral is basically Subjugation. Lemme lay down some numbers for you
---
HOODS| M Atk | M Dam%| Stab Def| Slash Def| Crush Def| Mag Def| Range Def
---
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
---
Sub Hood| 7| 1%| 12| 8| 14| 8| -3
---
Anc Hood| 8| 2%| 12| 11| 13| 5| 0
---
TOPS| M Atk | M Dam%| Stab Def| Slash Def| Crush Def| Mag Def| Range Def
---
Sub Top| 31| 3%| 35| 30| 56| 40| -6
---
Anc Top| 42| 2% | 42| 31| 51| 28| 0
---
BOTTOMS| M Atk | M Dam%| Stab Def| Slash Def| Crush Def| Mag Def| Range Def
---
Sub Bot| 23| 2%| 26| 24| 34| 25| -4
---
Anc Bot| 26| 2%| 27| 24| 30| 20| 0
---
Huh, those numbers are all awfully close to eachotherrrrrrrr. Ancestral is actually better in magic attack, stab defense, slash defense and range defense with subjugation only having slightly higher crush defense and moderately higher magic defense. To be fair, each piece of subjugation does have a +1 prayer bonous and I guess that's the line between broken and acceptable. Both sets have the exact same 6% damage buff, just spread out between the pieces differently.
---
What I'm saying is, we have a lot more RSHD content than people think we do (see also: spirit shields, staff of light, demonic gorillas, zenyte jewelry, trident of the seas, cerberus boots, ferocious gloves etc etc) people just get hung up on names and not realizing that previous sometimes OP things have already been adapted and changed to fit the current state of OS and anything else that is in that category would also get the same treatment.
---
Congratulations virgins, you have something to wank your daggers to now
---
It says 'training rc including the mining time' gives the same rc xp as currently available. 
---
But for all you know it also gives 40k mining an hour. Does not mention mining xp anywhere just that rc will be same/similar.
---
So before judging it to be dead content maybe wait for it to be released?
---
Lol. Both raids can be soloed. 
---
"Group content" my ass.
---
Make 1 and ask mod ash.
---
Legends say that it might possibly be in the morytania expansion according to jagex
---
take my upvote ya filthy animal
---
RS3 mobile is great! Love the new UI, love being able to flaunt it to my iPhone user friends + I can afk secretly at work.
---
Already have 120 herb from warbands and a couple of well-planned DXPs and 120 farm from POF pre-nerf.
---
Vorkath requires 3 levels of anti-fire protection.
---
Super Anti-fire potion = 2 levels
---
Anti-fire potion = 1 level
---
Anti-dragon Shield = 1 level
---
So you want to use an anti-dragon shield combined with a super antifire potion.
---
Anyone else hear the crab song? 🦀
---
&gt; Vanilla client has zero UI scaling support. 
---
It definitely does. I believe any scaling that occurs with OSRS automatically is handled via Java. Manual scaling is definitely done through Java.
---
The Java flag to control scaling manually is ``-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=#`` (# being 2 or above; 1 for no scaling); this works on Java 9+. This manual flag doesn't work with the official client (via msi installer) on Windows however since (last I checked) it's using an older version of OpenJDK (7 or 8).
---
On Windows and macOS, OSRS scales automatically with the OS scaling level. I believe this may require a minimal build of Windows 10, but unless you're running a severely outdated version (something older than 1607), this shouldn't be an issue. 7 or 8.1 I believe requires a registry setting to get automatic scaling, and can be accomplished by following some guide as to how to get Eclipse to scale on those Windows versions. Regardless of the OS however, the manual scaling flag above works fine as long as Java is 9+.
---
I know all about UI scaling with various toolkits across all 3 operating systems; OSRS wasn't really an issue. On Windows, I have the OS scaling at 200%, and OSRS respected it and scaled appropriately. On macOS, I scale from 4K to a 1080p framebuffer (basically the same 200%) and OSRS also automatically scales with that. On Linux, I have to explicitly set ``-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2``, which does 200% scaling.
---
context
---
Well, it's not efficient and I thought we're talking about efficiency
---
Can someone explain to me what GIM is? Is it just that now you can trade with a couple other ironman accounts?
---
I had a shit day thanks for asking
---
Why couldn't you just screenshot?
---
so we can agree that magic doesnt need a buff since it has multiple ways to lifesteal?
---
If this mode is for casuals then where does that leave regular accounts? Are they made for infants or is ironman mode (group or not) just a way for people to declare their love of repetitive actions that could easily be avoided by using the GE.
---
EDIT: there's a word for this, it starts with A but to avoid offending anyone I won't say it.
---
A whole area expanded and reworked, a real clansystem, and an emphasis on QoL updates?
---
Seems like a lot for a game originally not supposed to get any updates...
---
Would be cool except you’d be running through it with 15fps 😄
---
you got banned for playing mobile? ok LOL
---
idk man each update has its issue, take for example song of the elves, great update that was ruined by a horrible wannabe DG activity that is pretty much dead content at this point.
---
Mine was from the 2nd email you linked
---
Desertletics
---
Also GSP is huge
---
It wouldn't that complex, Runescape is already syncing things.  You could just use a lock on each item, or even the bank.  Plus they have to have some code for handling things like the general store or the GE.
---
 &gt; I can barely survive in the fucking dungeon itself, let alone the boss rooms.
---
Wear God related gear and you take zero damage from the enemies in the dungeon.
---
You will struggle at bandos with those stats, I'm not gonna lie. 
---
You can easily kill zammy for 1-2 kill trips or more depending on your mage level for blood barrage plus being on task. If you have a decent range level and learn how to do Sara you don't take much damage at all just kiting her so you could stay fairly easily for 10+ kills. 
---
With that low of a bank then you might want to avoid Arma. Chins are expensive in the short term but in the long term you will profit. If you don't want to use chins you can just bring a rune crossbow and diamond bolt(e)s and step under after every shot. Probably only get a few kills a trip that way though.
---
I say this from experience , I've done this shit underleveled, I'm not a "neet"  as you described me,i'm not maxed, I don't have full bis + whatever.
---
It would be nice if we got a bit of sophanem expansion before this year I’d put then a focus on sophanem and menaphos the next year
---
Name one place where players get their account details social engineered as easily as Jagex's. I mean they already admitted their account security is severely outdated.
---
Christ this is pathetic. We get new content that so many people asked for and y’all are still unhappy.
---
They are not comparable ? What spell are you using on kodai ? If you mention scales then you want to use the auto cast on trident so what are you trying to compare?
---
Who cares? It's not your obligation to decide what is and isn't worth the dev time. Jagex has done the R&amp;D and decided it's worth it, and if the community votes it in, then that's that. Not every piece of content has to be catered to every type of player.
---
I had the same kc as you on iron before I went to small ones and got it instantly, dont do your self in mate
---
No, it’s not the majority money maker, and OSRS will be fine if RS3 dies especially since the UK is starting to crack down on predatory business practices that Jagex use in their MTX.
---
Schoolgirl kebab treasure
---
Did they ever come out and justify why we roll with black void anyway? I mean I guess it's kind of dealing yourself in by making a definitive continent and then having ocean be your black void, but c'mon let's get this desert down to a shoreline.
---
Makes no sense. There’s no “middle ground” in this. Although, I concede I didn’t think about group bossing at GWD. That’d be nice. 
---
Being “self-sufficient” with friends doesn’t mean anything lol. If they didn’t like playing the game while they could trade with anyone or no one, why would they like trading with just some? Makes no sense. We’ll see once it releases, but I don’t see this bringing in players that originally had no interest.
---
Welcome to my morytania morytania locked ironman
---
If you make a group ironman you will never be apart of the normal ironman leaderboards this is made clear in the blog so that wouldnt be an issue
---
OMG this changes the whole game for me. I can't possibly vote for this in a poll! Even if it helps keep the game from growing an active playerbase! /S
---
Brrrr
---
Only content creators or NEETs do that. For content creators, it's their job to keep things fresh. As for NEETs, it's just for bragging rights.
---
The other two weren't directed at smokey at all just dumb arguments with others around the same time as I wasn't in the right state of mind.
---
Before I quit, the only thing I used magic for was metal dragon tasks and bursting. For bursting I was just using an ancient staff. I’d probably be using the 2nd highest level fire spell (not really sure what its called), if I was using kodai. Is there a big difference in dps between it and trident?
---
I mean this literally is the middle ground what do you mean?
---
Being 'self-sufficient' still has meaning, your boy isn't going to just sell you 10k dragon bones, you still don't have access to items that easily. The point is you're experiencing more of the game than a normie account but you get to do it with friends AND you can be more efficient with it.
---
Personally I love the ironman mode and its the only way I really care to play OSRS but this allows me to play with my friends in a more interactive way without completely getting rid of the ironman aspect.
---
So let's continue doing this until jmods decide it's time to support their customers themselves rather than have us clamor for it. Once they start helping people, the only ones who will make threads will be scammers.
---
mad?
---
Lvl 3 skillers are an unsocial bunch
---
Not every second of dev time has to go to something that's "for" you
---
Not really..
---
Osrs said they will never make them rare....
---
Camp SGS a bunch?
---
It'll need to be recharged with more shards, I imagine like the new saeldor blade and crystal shards?
---
u know that prnt scrn button on your keyboard? press it.
---
Getting loot on an Ironman with 10hp was impractical as it relied on insane RNG. Now 1 account gets all the xp, and the other PKs while the main picks up the loot.
---
This exact thing happened to my friend when he was deployed he ended up just making a fresh account
---
it’s almost as though it’s ridiculous either way you think about it
---
Kq is over 1.5 m an hour with reasonable attention
---
Trident is cheaper to operate and obtain, Kodai has a higher max hit.
---
Which is better though? Completely situational. Do you need something cheap, do you need poison, do you need freeze, do you need healing, do you need multi-hit.
---
Trident is sufficient for more purposes than kodai in my eyes tho.
---
If you sold a blue partyhat on RS3 for 19.5 billion coins and then swapped it over to OSRS at about 1:5 exchange rate which is about  3.9 billion coins and then bought as many blue partyhats as you could with the cash for current market price you'd end up with almost 170,000 blue partyhats. That is amazing if you think about it.
---
Hate to be that guy, but agility course will probably be less exp per hour than lvl 80 rooftop, same goes for new rc method it will be less rc exp. When you keep adding nerfed stuff like these behind endgame content it feels so cheap (dead content from prif, etc.) The only good anouncement is the group boss, which osrs desperately needed. Group iron and clan system, I don't consider them as content since it's basically infrastructure or support for other content.
---
I know this is a stupid meme but I've never seen a more appropriate application for it, **DESTRUCTION 100**
---
Nyes
---
69% of people make up their stats
---
,
---
So you deleted 3, got it
---
Man deleted his whole account what did he do lmao
---
That's so wholesome
---
What is the acronym btw??? I’ve asked this like 3 times on this sub no ones given me an answer it’s driving me bonkers
---
I dont see much succcess with group ironmen, jagex should have released pre ge-man mode, the only restriction is you cant use ge, it you can only trade between pre ge-man modes, new economy, people in west varrock bank buying gfs, since a lot of nerds complained about ge added to the game.
---
Thats better then my idea of lumbridge.
---
We will wait for the jmod smackdown to answer your questions.
---
Possibly, but it was probably said to emphasize how he was not even playing the game at the time
---
Thanks
---
you kind of touched it with desert diary, but nardah statue was HUGE before poh
---
probably around jan/feb 2020
---
Interesting.
---
That's the point,a blatant buff to the bis amulet is stupid
---
My advice is dont do it if you don't want to or dont need to. Getting to 90 was easy because there were things to unlock like kq shortcut and elite diaries but 90-99 was the worst and there is no point in getting it unless you leave it until the last skill to fully max.
---
Jesus do you not even read the wiki to start?
---
Probably still using the vanilla client too
---
By the way
---
Hope you feel better my dude
---
Da we play on deity so we just gonna let the AI build it with all their bonuses and then take it through conquest, what could possibly go wrong?
---
not at all really lol.
---
there's tob, running ess, ba, scaled raids make an absolute shit-ton, like 10m+ per hour depending on scale/efficiency. bosses like vork which are around 4m per hour, zulrah, etc. runecrafting is worse than all of these and more by a pretty huge margin.
---
All the big copy paste spam got you auto timed out. And since people would switch out a few letters etc they had to ban words like pog or swampletics
---
Buying gp creates demand for gp, demand which gets filled by bots/gold farmers, who generate the gold that people buy.
---
ironically the most boot comment in this thread.
---
True.
---
Just wanted to say I’m a huge fan of your music
---
Nah. It's just objectively poor game design to lock content behind multiple hundred plus hour grinds. Sorry no dungeon for you, you didnt left click 47 million rock crabs like twitter sweaty 74 over here. Want to play past mid game? Enjoy the multi year grind to get there playing normal amounts each week! It's bad game design.
---
Holy shit I chuckled so loud so just now.
---
It gives stats for level 60, but requires level 70. As in, it's more difficult to wield because of its unconventional nature. In return, however, it is more versatile.
---
&gt; They'd be disadvantaging themselves because they'd be competing as ironmen with a group of x when they actually have a group of x-1 and have to carry a new member to make up for the one they kicked
---
The person that is the most disadvantaged is the person who got kicked since they would be in a group of x when they are only one person and need x-1 extra members. You are right that kicking still disadvantages the team but I don't think giving players incentives to kick is a good idea which is why I think item tagging is a good idea. 
---
&gt; No incentive for the person being kicked to do so. Could lead to black market for account services and account selling but that'd be up to Jagex to deal with since it's against the rules.
---
What do you mean there is no incentive? They would be able to gather gear/stats nearly instantly with no repercussions and would be directly competing with people that would have to get things on their own. How is that not incentive?
---
&gt; Same as main game, they can ban your related accounts too
---
How do you distinguish between a group knowingly botting and one that has someone secretly botting?
---
&gt; Sounds annoying as fuck because it means the PvMers of a group can basically hold the group hostage if drama happens. Like the potions made by any skillers would be used by the PvMers so it doesn't matter if the skillers tag their items because they've already been used to get the drop that's tagged by the PvMer.
---
This is fair argument but what if you could give ownership to other players providing that they have been in your group for X amount of months.
---
The engine team that is doing the majority of the work is neither an osrs or rs3 team. As for its actual implementation into the game, that’ll be up to each games dev team. With that said, who cares if they were to get it too? Its an update we want. Its an update our devs have time for. Why would it bother you in anyway if it benefits rs3 at all.
---
Its "by the way", comes from an older meme, everytime there would be discussion ironmen used to say " I am iron man btw", which was then derived to calling all ironmen btw's, short version but you know.
---
revs is still great content, has the highest gp/hr in the game right now sitting at 7m a hour after costs.
---
Bold of you to assume the majority of the OSRS player base makes $22+ an hour.
---
Not faster means not &gt; than. Is English not your native language or are you just bad at interpreting it?
---
As far as using Zulrah, that’s guaranteed going to be considerably slower that this method, considering it’s nowhere near a bank and this method gives 50% bonus basically at a bank.
---
Happy cake day Sween
---
Why is this downvoted? He litterly only  just thanked him for his service. The fuck..
---
🦀Jagex is powerless against pledge bot farmm🦀
---
wait people find jody jokes unironically funny?
---
Actually good looking armor wtf
---
Imagine this shit with Slayer cape
---
Feel like she was aight. Maybe a bit over the top at times but overall it wasnt bad
---
Pretty sure this was from gameblast 2018 and not runefest
---
For sure brother. Tyfys
---
All quests that require rc also require the quest mate.
---
50/50... you either get it or you don't
---
Runefest was rendi-proof
---
All these situations is why it’s so damn risky to continue playing this game. All it takes is 1 bad thing to happen and it takes a fucking messiah’s worth of power to get it fixed because they have no damn value in customer support and have never had any in the beginning.
---
I really wish there was some way we could get them to attempt at building customer support...
---
Dungeoneering being a skill, Summoning ruining the combat triangle, Chaotics being untradable ruining PVP further, etc.
---
83 is one of the best investments you can make IMO. Nexus, pools, fairy rings, jewelery box etc. There's so much stuff in there I use every day. I have an alt that only has an altar + glory and I really notice the difference on that account.
---
Rigour is good but I wouldn't get it unless you plan on bossing or doing slayer bosses **a lot**. For general slayer and PVM, you'll burn through so many prayer pots using it - unless you plan on going full sweaty mode.
---
If you're planning on mainly slaying, I'd get a decent setup for all 3 styles. I'd have these items at the bare minimum
---
**Slayer helm**
---
**Melee: Torture, Zerker ring, Whip**
---
**Range: Anguish, Archer, Blowpipe**
---
**Magic: Occult, Tormented bracelet, Trident, Ahrims top and bottom.**
---
That's probably 80-90m. You can easily spend another 10-20m just on pots, food, runes etc for general use.
---
That leaves you with 100m.
---
I'd just rock barrows for melee armour and blessed hide for range. You could use Bandos or arma but you're paying a lot for very little extra.
---
From there you could get a few other things like SGS for slayer, DFS for tankiness when AFK slaying. Or put some in to skills. 83 Con is really the only useful one I can think of. Or maybe put it in to some chins for range, or burst for slayer tasks like nechs and dust devils.

aw man, now i gotta watch faux and boaty restart ANOTHER ironman account. how many times do i have to watch them do slayer and agility.

Seeing as he brought up Revs, clearly he wants a whole fuckload more PvM content added to the Wilderness to entice PvMers to enter the wilderness for his amusement.
---
They just overhauled and added a ton of stuff involving PvPers fighting other PvPers, a playstyle I'm totally fine with and hope flourishes, but there's a subset of PvPers who aren't interested in that and just wanna dominate people who aren't there to fight them and can't fight back. OP is clearly gonna be unhappy if he's not able to ruin someone else's day as much as possible to meet his spade quota

After a couple hours training it's so much more mindless than rc and mining that I didn't really mind. Seriously blocked it out and was watching a show.

Mining is also 3t granite so it involves a ton more clicking.
---
What isn't mentioned at all in this blog are the pvm achievements and the interface updates. I'm really hyped to see this, especially the interface-thingy. Sounded like we could get some nice client work going there.
---
Unfortunately it sounded similar to marks of grace just under a different name :/ so probably no new mechanics that make agility more fun and less of a grind while watching Netflix.

It sounded to me like a pyramid plunder type thing, but agility based with levels you unlock depending on agility lvl.  It does sound slightly better than rooftops, but we'll have to wait and see and could also be largely dependent on xp/hr.
---
Oh I thought you were talking about comparing to other group irons. Yea as others have said they won't be on the same hiscores as solo ironmen.

I’ve been screaming this from (agility course) rooftops for years.

Maybe read the full length apologies I put over 10 times on different platforms. I literally deleted my comment, publicly apologized multiple times. Then went on here and manually wrote on my phone I am sorry to every single negative comment because that is how bad I felt about the situation. If you don't think I am still genuine after that that is fine, but I know I am and that is all that matters to me right now. AND yes, I was definitely in the wrong here, other's didn't help though.

I’m not gonna lie, I’ve always hated the desert for some reason. Obviously an expansion can improve that, but it’s always been my least favorite area of the game to visit.

It’s still maxed mains in BiS gear. Honestly castle wars is where maxed mains go to retire once they feel they’ve done everything in the game already. At least that’s the general vibe I got from playing castle wars. Even if you are also high leveled or max, the people in the castle wars world pretty much play competitively so u’ll still get stomped.

While your idea sounds correct, just because I know how to work with bronze wouldn't automatically make me proficient at repairing steel things in real life, the materials are entirely different.

It's the same idea here, someone unfamiliar with godsword metal would likely end up not heating it enough to properly mend it and create weakpoints in the blade if they even manage to get it into one piece.

It's reddit. There's only ever a fuss.

i do agree that the poll system has drawbacks, youd be crazy to say otherwise, but its disingenuous to say that warding is why we dont have any huge updates. warding had 0 (zero) dev time put in, because its be a waste of time and money to begin producing something that may not even get in game. it had time and thought put into it, but ultimately nothing was actually made outside of a few items and animations.
---
id argue the bigger problem is that we will never be suprised any more. therell never be anything like the gravity  surge before dungeoneering because there cant be, and if there was wed instantly know what it was for and move on (e.g. CoX).
---
we also never get low-level content, because the devs are working so hard on making high-level content that can feasibly pass a poll, despite low level content being faster to make and used by a significantly higher percentage of players. 
---
but the thing that youre overlooking here is the obvious thing- its "old school" runescape. the main reason people start playing is for nostalgia, and the more we change (level caps, a new god wars dungeon or a new skill are perfect examples) the less people will play the game for its intended purpose. which is why we prefer to only add content like new bosses, new quests, and overhauls to systems that have always been bad since it wont take away from the new player experience.
---
tl:dr; well, yes, but actually, no

Yikes that's a lot of commitment to something that could have done way faster and more enjoyable with membership. Hope you have fun :)

horrible idea, you would crash the price of all armor from that because everyone would just use void to lowers how much it cost to get their shit back. Shit i died the other day at tob are you saying it sounds balance that i would have to pay over 75m to get my gear back?
---
I felt the same way. But only because I enjoy rs in shorter bursts. I got the 3 month mems deal and was burnt about a month and a half in. Once the 3 months is out I can enjoy some other games for a while and then come back ready for more.
---
Could give it glory stats, so it won't be bis, but a nice to have alternative imo

late game pvm is built around mechanics that can instantly kill you, changing death mechanics now would be like getting rid of 1/2 tick prayer, you just cant now that content is built around the mechanics.

Yeah, she's done a bunch of live streams for Xbox, not sure if she works for Microsoft or if she's just a contractor for them or whatever but she's definitely experienced. She was on the show when they announced Halo MCC was coming to PC.

120s in skills nobody wanted them in and a new skill that will surely disappoint. Can't wait.
---
Yes there is. You can train every F2p skill faster in members. And members quest skips the early grind for most skills, which is where a huge part of early time is spent, especially in F2p. It's optimal to start an account directly into members. Being F2p gives you no benefit. It just lets you try the game before paying any money / grindinf for a bond.
---
Well the number can always be changed but having it at 100k is a joke. At that point might as well be free. 
---
Make it 1% (or 2% or whatever works best) of ge cost.
---
My main point is how risk free it is to do raids and bosses and it shouldn't be.

Personally, I like the current mechanics.

the overwhelming majority of people don't want to pvp.

DA sinks more gold per hour than PvP in a week.

dmm was a spectacle to watch.
---
watching 1v1's might be fun the first few times, but when you realize the more skillful player can be killed thanks to rng, it undermines pvp as a whole.
---
items that aren't valuable in pvp hold value for arbitrary reasons as well (fashionscape etc).

China's means to power is to just buy up anything. Sense a lot of the companies are owned by the state the use them to buy other companies that they usually have no expertise in then just move the correct people over to work on the assignment. Their whole thing is just a big numbers game. 
---
They are a semi capatlist nation, just at a certain point you become part of the state. China has their hands in many affairs, and fund many smaller Nations and often gets access to a port, or a chunk of land for a military base with no restrictions. It's kind of interesting how they act as one and just start aquiring things through these weird round about means. They have their own internet, and app eco system. Like the only good quality mobile Pvp games come from Tencent if you look at it on a global scale. 
---
From my understanding Jagex was transferred from the previous company which was a failing ore mining buisness, to the current one now which is based on California or something that sounds normal. But what I remember reading was that they just did some buisness magic shook some hands and moved money around and it's essentially the same people.

Like another guy said, gnomes and such at 75 thieving still have a crazy low success rate. Just because it's 60 wouldn't mean you have a good chance at 60 before ardy diary/gloves of silence bonus. So even shifting it up 15-20 levels would be enough for it to be difficult.
---
More content... Like 10 times or more the amount of content. That's more ability to have fun for a longer period.
---
This kind of account was weeks and months of grinding the same methods. So sure.. fun is opinion based. But having more things to do and more skills to train undoubtedly allows more fun to be had.
---
Instanced area mate...
---
Still slippery slope fallacy, still not an actual counterargument.
---
People who build F2p only accounts are seeking a unique limited challenge. Same as area locked accounts.
---
F2p pking sure, it's simple at its core and thus abuses some more methods of staggering attacks etc. But no one has to build an account *in F2p* to pk in F2p.

1/300 not a big deal

Owo bath and body works
---
How many kills did you get per trip? Like 4-6?
---
Why should the exp be averaged and not just cumulative?
---
Averaging it would just make the worse people in the group look better and the good players look bad.
---
We just got super unlucky and got a TOC staff duty drop, this is gonna be minimum 12 hours grind.
---
revs do not need an expansion, they average above 7m per hour (that is with the fee of paying protection already taken out).  There should also be no EP systems put in place, you either kill people with risk or you dont, creating an artificial way to gain wealth off of those not risking just leads to bot farms.  no idea what you mean with craters, im assuming you mean the old bh crater?  wouldnt live for long, all you would do is pull the same crowed from edge/ge.  
---
If you want to grow the wilderness you need to find a way to grow it without trying to create a prey vs predator update (ex, add a boss in wild to lure in pvmers to feed kills to pkers, thats a bad way to increase who wants to take part in the wilderness).  
---
Honestly i think the only way to fix the wild is to bring back hugging (creates survivability with tanking), remove tick timing attacks to lower the learning curve (being able to stack 3 attacks in 1 tick), and to remove the ability to skull trick in the wild.
---
i’m all for giving pkers more incentive to fight eachother. i’m not for putting the best moneymakers and exp rates and stuff like that inside the wilderness though. Make pkers fight eachother, improve their bh system or something. But i’m not going to vote something in that would put me in the wilderness just waiting as bait over and over. Especially when clans literally have bot systems that can basically
---
know every single person on every world. make pkers fight other pkers and not pvmers and skillers.
---
streamers can risk big because they always have a group with them or they are fighting people they actually know.  you wouldnt see a random person running around the wild with a 500m+ risk (well not usually i should say).
---
Yes, it's a lot better now, but on release it really wasn't good and it took them a long time to begin going back and finishing it.

Specifically, 1 agility gives you 1% energy every 7.5 seconds. 50 agility gives you 1% every 3.75 seconds. Which is a *huge* difference. 72 agility is 3 seconds, 99 is 2.5 seconds. The difference between 1 and 50 agility is substantial compared to 50 and 99.

Lol that will never be done. Impossible to stay away.

Exactly what I meant by the membership is that I feel obligated to have to play all the time to make my membership "worth it", don't think I'm going to invest in another bond or monthly membership until the holidays or whenever I'm able to.

To be honest we could add that kinda lifesteal effect to something that isn't already the best choice for melee... Instead of just outright buffing the already best item to be better.

They have to poll everthing in osrs. Thats why they have so few things that 100% gonna happend

I’d delete your account
---
Not it's not hypothetical. Efficient xp/h is def higher but people don't seem to care to bitch about that unless it's under certain cases like underwater agility (that barely anyone did)
---
Smackdown. I'm still surprised why these posts are getting made and OP knows he is getting smacked by a Jmod.
---
Wholesome af thankyou for brightening my morning ❤️
---
I think you might be right about that, I've always had an addictive personality but runescape really takes it to a whole other level, and I'm not able to just life like a consistent life, I always find myself prioritising runescape over other things because it gives me momentary gratification with achievements that don't take so long e.g. questing, levelling, bossing etc.. 
---
I'm sure not everyone feels the same way I do but I just wanted to see how other people felt about it all.
---
There is a reason they do zero damage and that is the pkers, what im saying is setting very specific circumstances to discredit something is not ideal because not every player can access that, in fact very few player would be willing to pay 130mill for 2weeks protection. you could even hire players to help you kill revenants and then it would be even more profit/hour.
---
I'll jump on the bandwagon and suggest a Witchhaven only UIM for Settled so we can get a next Sea Slug quest
---
43 pray f2p is worse than getting 99 mage f2p change my mind
---
I feel like thats a good way to do it, just take like short breaks in between. Wishing they had weekly memberships or like half bonds so that I don't have to feel obliged to play a whole fortnight.
---
so then what are the consequences if they never pay? will some hitman hired by a creditor dox them and start breaking kneecaps?
---
Uhhh am i the only one who sees a giant flaw with group ironman? Imagine this. Group A gets a ton of excess bandos items. Group B has none. Wether they just arnt at bandos yet or maybe hella dry. Group a kicks player out. Group b recruits said player. Player brings bandos in his backpack to give to group b. Group b removed player and he rejoins group a. Thats just trading with extra steps....
---
Thanks bro, I knew someone felt the same way about this, I almost feel trapped in having to play the game.

Primary cause for rat lmaooo. Ever heard of botting?

That's you talking from your experience and this is me talking from my experience.

I recovered my account through their 'official channel' perfectly fine.  
---
I had one pure I was paying membership for 6 months for but never used. Finally decided to submit a ticket because I didn't know the accounts details. They refunded me the whole 6 months of membership because they saw I hadn't played on the account for the duration.
---
Jesus bud they're a level 60 slayer monster, imagine getting one as a task at 80 combat when it takes two minutes in max gear to kill ONE creature, pull your head outta your ass
---
If anything they should have a higher slayer req rather than just fucking lower levels
---
Lul. Read the j mod reply and maybe consider editing/deleting this comment
---
Yeh you aren't even reading my comments you're just insulting me and thinking that makes you have any point.
---
He didn't say "in his lifetime" in the joke. You're literally changing what the joke he said was to make any sense. I said a joke about breaking 400 bones isn't funny unless it was used in a similar context to mock a ridiculous statement.
---
If I said I deserved video of the year because the video I had was done while I had 3 broken fingers and that's why I deserve it, and someone made a joke the winner had 13 broken fingers.. then that's a similar joke.
---
It's not possible, and thus it's mocking my statement that my injury has any sort of impact on the quality or validity of a winning video

I mean hurrdurr I'm brain dead. Dunno why I'm bothering explaining humour to someone who hasn't got a clue it seems.

The average player is basically never going to run out of content in the main game already. I've played a few thousand hours, got quest cape, varrock elite and lumbridge elite, but I'm still not close to doing ToB. Even if I didn't like pvm there's still a bunch of stuff left for me to do, so I don't get why we need so much new content.
---
Like what? New skill announcement? The difference there is RS3 just adds those. No stopping process in polls 
---
Other than that there are 120 to skills people didn't want touched while ignoring reworks people did want, which the cynics can clearly say is to fuel Mtx purchases.

It was a way to garner additional trust/believability possibly

What do you mean? It affects both ironmen and group ironmen. Allowing ironmen to go in teams is a huge difference. Allowing group irons to go in teams that include players outside of the group is a big difference too indeed.

He didnt really insult your friends work at all though, he just vented his frustrations about not winning and how hard he worked to try and win. Not once in that original tweet did he mention any other content creators infact it was you who bought up smokey. That's not to say what Rendi did was right he should have kept himself to himself but you also shouldn't have engaged and pushed it further.

You can get 3000 attack charges per day from doing two crystal trees, charging the blade is a joke.
---
They may be a tad condescending and arrogant, but in a way they're right. In many countries the target recruitment pool for the armed forces is those who find themselves with few prospects for further education or a career. Additionally, generally armed forces prefer more malleable and less independent-minded recruits for their lower ranks.
---
Why not implement 2FA?
---
Corrupted gauntlet on release was actually probably harder than ToB. The nerfs made a huge difference though, now it's kind of easy.

Look.. if you have that attitude then you’re playing the wrong game and looking at the wrong subreddit.

I do good solo raids, nothing, I dc then die to head phase, my first purple.

This game is weird

3000 attack charges per day from checking two crystal trees. Keeping it charged is super easy unless you're camping blade everywhere and play an absurd amount doing just melee.
---
i have never seen that happend but if thats the case then submit a bug report then.

Some of the older ones have a lack of continuity between items required. Like you’ll get half way through the quest and magically need an item he forgot in the intro.

Perhaps the idea is that mining the essence is afk or gives mining exp. Then you rc with the essence for temporarily higher exp. This would result in an overall lower exp method but lets you mine for passive rc exp when you feel like taking a break from rcing. It gives more variety and revives the essence mining part of RC.

Because location and ISP are a fucking meme and everyone who thinks they are important recovery details is an idiot

This is pretty much the only data that matters and they have to match exactly, typically 3 is enough so you may have gotten them incorrect OR the passwords you offered might have  been removed from recovery because the account has been recovered back and forth using those details

It's crazy how little (if at all) account activity is taken into account. 10 year inactive accounts being kept locked because you don't have the phone number you used to pay by phone bill when you were 12, meanwhile you can literally "recover a lost" account that's currently logged in if you have the correct information

i dont want them to ever do something like the clan citadel thats just a pointless grind

they should give bonus xp for playing together but in lamp form based on time in -proximity

They shouldn't have to be told. This is just common sense. And in all honesty he should have had security measure in place anyway. It's not like they don't constantly remind you to set them up when they aren't. They even have an entire area of the game dedicated to account security.

We didn't have huge value items back then lol..

It's quite rare for someone to know what isp the account was created with, where it was created and when unless they made the account. If you cannot provide these details then it's extremely likely you are not the account creator or you started playing when you were 7 years old

I don’t get why people use video quest guides at all when the wiki exists
---
To answer your last statement, the engine is it’s own entity. The mobile and desktop clients read information from the engine and present it through the client.
---
A good way to explain the difference between content devs and engine devs is as follows. Content developers use tools created by the engine team to make new items, NPCs, quests, dialog, etc with some very light Java programming in between. Engine devs design and worry about, for example with the clan update, how to  design/debug a system that can run hundreds of clan chats that are now capping at 500 players at once without crashing all the worlds.

It wasn't his fault they fucked up basilisks, get real.

This has to be made up?

No joke if a dude did thay on my pure he better sleep with one eye open.

Making some fool do Rcing is one thing but ruining an acc is just not cash money of you.

Say sike right now.

Zenyte jewlet started rising before the announcement cause runelite got rid of the gorilla plugin.

TzHaar require 90 thieving but they made their failure rate pretty low

DESERT MAN GOOD!

I lost my account once and i just provided them with all information i could remember like where i lived when i created it, approx when i created it, all different payment methods i had used, isp used when creating it, different displaynames i had used over the years and things like that.
---
You need to provide as much info as you can as far back as you possibly can so there can be no doubt that you are the owner and creator of the account, if you can do that then they lock the account and gives it back to you.
---
No problem with them borrowing content from RS3. That’s not why I hate the game. I don’t like the combat or the graphics. If the RS3 devs made a good quest or piece of content I have no problem with them polling it =D
---
Or visage
---
Yes let me scry my brain for my membership purchase id from the first time I bought membership 14 years ago
---
you know thieving is harder to level than just combat? if it's 95 thieving than most people would rather just kill for the shards, besides having 60 thieving doesn't guarantee pickpocket chance, there's going to be a very high chance of failure.
---
Honestly this community is so fucked up. You're supposed to play this game to have fun, that's what games are for. Who cares what your hiscores are for group Ironman if you're having fun with the boys? The fact that people are thinking of exploiting this game mode is pathetic. If you want to trade don't make an Ironman, it's that simple.
---
This is osrs
---
I don’t disagree with you, at 30 I finally have all my passwords written down and stored someone where just on my phone or brain...  but when I made my first RSC account back in 03 I wasn’t thinking about all that. I just think asking for a pw from the beginning of
---
Account creation isn’t necessarily the end all
---
Be all to account recover
---
I mean logically it is. Had warding passed it would be in development currently. So due to it failing a lot of dev resources were available.
---
Lmao no way. After rag n bone man 2 there's no way in hell.
---
New worst skill ever
---
You shouldn't have to.
---
Yeah I’d rather actual content instead of a game mode for streamers
---
If weapons with the same bonus's came into the game but from an area that wasn't the wilderness they would pass a poll with about 90%. No one cares about higher tier weapons when they come from safescape pvm, they just don't want to have to go to the wilderness to earn them.
---
&gt; The contention is that since the unique earned from pickpocketing vyrelord/ladies would be part of a new best-in-slot item (the improved torture amulet), a requirement of only 60 thieving seems strangely low.
---
You can also just kill Vyrewatch for it.
---
&gt;Killing Elite Vyrewatch
---
&gt;The Elite Vyrewatch are more powerful versions of the normal Vyrewatch. They can be killed for an improved loot table, which includes the Blood Shard, and can count towards vampyre slayer tasks. Vampyres will also be included in two new Slayer unlocks which will extend vampyre tasks and allow them to be assigned by higher tier Slayer masters.
---
Why not just join a PvM clan? The mid tier ones do bandos/corp like all day
---
clearly they see the value in giving settled more content probably their biggest ad for osrs. imo the Darkness of Hallowvale
---
, haunted mine and myreque quests is some of the worst quests in the game i dread doing them on new accounts
---
Yes
---
I can only imagine all of the people who are HATING on you right now, would be soooooo pissed off if you guys gave an account to the wrongful owner because of a reddit post. Can you imagine the backlash??
---
Its paradoxical or hypocritical or maybe both.
---
We’re getting a new city tho lol
---
I don't think you need 14 year old ID's to recover your account, but I understand your point. Perhaps you've got some hanging around in you mailbox, since a lot op people don't clean them up.
---
Especially for a game you don’t know if you’ll play more than 5 minutes.
---
Wait is this a real thing? I'm guessing runefest? I didnt watch it this year but holy shit if this is true.
---
Fuck off beggar
---
Its still the same company.
---
I am in 'Team Paradox' and have been for years now since i originally began Pvming group content. It's Discord based small-medium sized pvm cc with chill members from a variety of time zones. You can apply for a rank on the discord; hop in the CC and ask a rank for the link if you're interested :)
---
I actually don’t know any.
---
We don’t, plus now I have some time to catch up and learn tob.
---
I mean... you're not wrong.. 
---
You just want anything to scream and bitch to a jmod about.
---
Tell me that you, as a kid some random 10 years ago, thought off doing all this lmao
---
It's supposed to be untradeable I think.
---
OMG this is awesome! Can we finally get skippy back on tutorial island?!
---
This man is trying to complete the fally elite diary right now

and then u sell those fuckers on same said ge
---
A group date for iron men.  We can start it now, and, sure you can get a head start, but i bet ill still finish first. (;
---
But what kind of system would you like to have in that case? Based on trust? I wonder what a 'good' recovery system would look like in your eyes.
---
&gt; or you started playing when you were 7 years old
---
But that's the thing. Lots of players are playing on ancient accounts and possibly made the accounts when they were kids so wouldn't know what the ISP was and if they moved a lot when they were kids it could easile be hard to remember what city it was made in.
---
Your system sucks. I don't get why you don't give accounts away if they provide vague information. Fuck jagex man.
---
National Desert Treasure
---
WoW!  Great points!  If only the Wilderness wasnt as dead as my great grandmother and PvP was actually balanced and fun!   The wilderness will keep changing until they can figure out how to make it something worthwhile compared to what it is now.
---
I think most players want repeatable content, so quests need to be tied to significant unlocks which means they have a bigger dev time. RS2's quests were about the experience of doing the quest itself, normally introducing or fleshing out 1 small area but these areas generally lacked meaty content.
---
There's a problem with games more generally with people judging them as good if they take a lot of hours to complete, not judging the quality of those hours. I think questing gets hurt by people taking that line of thinking.
---
You are a waste of fresh air
---
Can settled even do the whole quest line?  I dont recall him ever doing/going into that part of Morytania so idk if he just chose not to or if he cant meet a certain req for the quests.
---
my man
---
No I gave up years ago trying to get 007Agent007 back years ago.  Just want them to know their system is garbage and severely dated.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about.
---
Do people really have to put /s for folks like yourself? Sheesh, grow up.
---
Yeah look into my account too, I had maxed stats and for some reason now they're at scrub level?
---
This is really only sorta true. When my account was stolen (never recovered) I was told I wasnt the original owner of the account even though I had membership transaction information for around 9 straight years previous - leading to around 2 months before the account was created. Can't get much more traceability than that, but was still denied.

Thank you!

You do for the fast teleport.
---
I used to play RS2 and came back to old school.
---
When I started playing osrs, I tried to create an account with my email only to find one had already been created.
---
I searched my email history, I have no confirmation of this. I do not recognize the username and I had to recover the password.
---
It was only level 3 and just off tutorial island but still, I did not make that account. Now I'm nearing 99 Slayer on my account that's only ever been registered to my email address, and I would not be able to prove I made it.
---
&gt; You could argue that nothings going to change with an official game mode and youd be correct.
---
&gt; But you're completely out of your mind if you think the game mode isnt vastly different from the others
---
I mean.. Not sure who you're arguing with at this point.. me or yourself ?
---
I have no idea what you're talking about period.
---
You are aware that the chance a friend created the account and gave it to him is very small? This guy probably bought an account 2 years ago and the original owner decided to take it back. 
---
Even then, I bet he could contact his "friend", you are saying like it isnt possible to contact friends you fell apart with lmao
---
The guy in the post doesnt have the info to prove its his account because it isnt, wheres the problem? If it was his account he would already have the account back.
---
&gt;Telling him he can't get his account back until the origal owner asks for it, is only going push OP away from playing and funding the game any more.
---
&gt;**Telling him he can't get his account back until the origal owner asks for it**
---
no shit, only the original owner should be able to recover the account are you cooked
---
Thanks man! Becoming expensive with these damn magic trees haha
---
I can’t decide if I love him or hate him when I watch him. But I must say I usually tune in when he’s streaming.
---
I like to think of them as the people who inspired ironman mode, well them and born for pvm! Cant forget him, he was integral as well. Boaty is credited in game, and I dont mean to diminish that at all, but they were the OGs. They did group ironman 10 years early and i think that's tight as shit
---
You must have misread because that doesn't go against my point at all.

Fuck it, put in a bunch of f2p 1200 total level worlds so I can mine runite in peace

Your xp gains go way down when you get a gf. Between my gf, job, other games, household chores and other responsibilities, my latest xp dry streak was 88 days. Don't let this be you.
---
I misread that! Thanks for correcting me!
---
Edit: actually I'm not seeing where this is stated, unless you're interpreting the kicked out member "will have to recruit more members to your own newly-formed group." Means back at tut island
---
More likely because it's just not enforceable you nonce. Are you going to throw out temporary bans every time someone logs in from a different computer/IP address?
---
should have hired someone from the community.
---
Or don't use the same password you use for everything.
---
Bro all i wanted was a desert expansion too. Just memories from doing the quest that gave Ava’s alterter in rs2
---
bro 😎💪
---
Now you're just talking about ironmen pures...?
---
That original subject was that you, or whoever else commented above me, is saying itd be so OP to have a low level ironman in the group as a black chin bot hunter
---
What I mean is how the fuck does their logic shake out like that what am I missing??
---
No, they asked the community to think of rewards for it, the amulet add-on is from thieving in Darkmeyer after the new quest
---
&gt;This information would include creation location, billing contact details and earlier passwords. 
---
~~I'm not surprised Jagex doesn't store passwords salted and hashed.~~
---
~~It is 2019 get your shit updated to this century please.~~
---
I'm corrected, I miss understood.
---
Isn't that sort of the purpose of a desert?
---
There has got to be atleast 1 charming nerd out there willing to host
---
That's exactly the case for most other bosses too! So maybe YOUR argument is irrelevant.  
---
Jagex did do an update which fixed this for 95% at corp: ironmen with 90+ combat lvl go to a different corp cave than other people. Jagex could either make this the case for the new boss too, or make the new boss instanced.
---
If a 5 man group kick 1 member, both the new 4 man group+the 1 ironman will be on highscore as a 5 man group ironman.
---
The 4 mangroup can either continue as a 4 man group, but still be in the 5 man highscores, or add a 5th member. But that member must be a new account.
---
Same for the 1 player. He can continue as a solo ironman, but still be on the 5 man highscore, or add new members.
---
He can't join another good group. He can add 1-4 more members, but they must all be new accounts.
---
Atleast that is how i understand it
---
'' nothing is going to change and you'd be correct '' followed by '' it will be vastly different from the others/current modes'' 
---
For someone who uses a lot of ad hominem argumentation you're making very little sense to me at the moment.
---
No lets make it 99 cause that's my thieving level
---
You know members skills don't count towards the f2p total level
---
well i remember..

The 500 total worlds and the 750 total worlds are already very scarcely populated; as of the time of this post, each world is not even at 100 people. On top of barely anyone on these worlds, 1K total for F2P requires an average level of 66 across all F2P skills, which will be kind of hard to get. It sounds a bit like you want some retirement worlds for former P2P accounts.
---
I don't understand your point of a 1K total F2P world adding consistency to P2P worlds. You'll have to elaborate.
---
There are 4 skills I personally find more annoying to level up than Runecrafting.
---
Agility, Thieving, Construction (but this is due to me being poor), and Slayer.
---
I've seen this posted a lot, it's just not true. My buddies and I know each other in RL and will definitely be playing. The three of us have ironmen that are 85+ slayer so this will be a good change of pace. It'll allow us enjoy the game again. Also I have another friend that I've never met and he would definitely play, not scam or steal from the group. 
---
Note we are all older than 20 if that matters.
---
They said (I think) a new quest and area in morytania
---
iirc it's about 40k for bloods and 45-50k for souls

but it's afkability is worth so much more :)

It  has been a long week. My bad.

some one still pays for that bond it does not get there out of thin air.

It should put a giant Ash teacup in the PoH displaycase!

J1mmy, 9Rain, John Pickens, and One Kick Rick would also be interesting. So just J1mmy and 9Rain x2.

You are right, not sure where I was with my mind.

Probably doing coke
---
Yes indeed, my bad.
---
sounds like youre on the right track. download the addon questie (and if you dont know how to dl addons figure it out super ez) and itll tell you all the quests on your map

sounds like youre on the right track if you got the blue crescent staff. just download questie and do blue yellow and orange quests in whatever area youre in

once you hit lvl 30 head straight to Scarlet Monastery but beware its full of horde so you need to sneak in or get killed

Good for you. Alot of us had other things to do as a kid than a computer so unlikely to remember minor details like that. It wasn't the only ridicoulus question either my friends mom used to buy us members so yeah not going to ask for her paypal either lol. I've struggled with the recovery aswell so I can relate to how broken it is altho ive always been succesful in the end
---
Umm my recommendation its obvious u love the game i suggest either starting new ( i would go iron man) or buy another acc from a reputable site. I have a 99 ranger fisher i dont use..
---
how is this account in bh worlds etc? lets say that i want to go around and find my bh target?
---
&gt;I can however also see that the account isn't currently in the hands of the account creator so I've secured it.
---
Why does this need manual verification? You just admitted that anyone can recover an account even if they're not the original owner. How am I supposed to feel secure with that?
---
You are correct, my bad.
---
Adding that information as well as a general time period your IP became dynamic as information (even if it always had been) would be sufficient to get your account if you have the original password and account creation date.
---
I would strangely be okay with this
---
Woah
---
Invisible? Wtf?

Same lol

Referencing observable statistics is not /r/iamverysmart material. In fact the person didn't even say anything about their own intelligence, just remarked that armed forces recruits tend to (on a **general average**) be less intelligent. It makes sense when you consider that recruiters intentionally specifically target the uneducated.

Honestly you should head on over to /r/iamverydumb and chill there for a bit.

---
Not really - consumer VPN's were never really around when Jagex created this system - is using a VPN for Netflix and forgetting and playing RuneScape really worth banning an account? Jagex's lack of account recovery options are at fault.
---
Also you are aware that RuneScape Mobile is played on well... mobile connections... a good few of those are going to geolocate to the mobile providers city or country of origin (hmm abit like a VPN...) so should players get their accounts banned just for using mobile data?  
---
Also IP GEOlocation has NEVER been accurate, to base critical functions on that is stupid.
---
You forgot the other half of the section, view botted phishing streams.

Hope u guys r happy

She really made me feel insecure about playing this game :c

And also doing it on mobile helps a lot
---
Where do you see jagex ask for ISPs in account recovery? OP said he provided ISPs, clearly that hasn't helped him. I may be mistaken here, however if I'm reading the jagex mods comment correctly he asked for OP to provide details of the following: account creation (should be pretty easy), billing contact details (your info or your parents if you were a kid), or earlier passwords. The earlier passwords is the only hard one but if you can provide some passwords with one or both the others you should be good.
---
Oh really! I thought I was forced to play that mode. I am glad you came along and told me otherwise. I'm sure you know I don't have to shut up though. I am allowed to state my opinion.
---
It's true, if they figure out an account is not in the hands of the original creator, they will lock it until someone they can sufficiently say is the og owner tries to recover it.
---
Your situation is fine because you and your friend have a close enough location that Jagex would never know weren't the creator, from the data they see.
---
And YouTube music 😏

Is the internet still as shitty there as it was in 2015? Also I was locked into 2 devices at the time for the base wifi.

Ok im going to throw this one out there, i had an old account i created back in 2004 when i was 9 by the name of "Luisthe94uk" . i stopped playing the game around 2007(when i would be 12) and when i returned my account was permanently banned for "Account Hijacking" with no potential to be appealed. This is of course a RS3 account now however is there any potential to have that looked into?
---
My parents knew that would be a waste of money.
---
Because saving customer data is on a different kind of requirement list than increasing account security.
---
you know I'm right, those game modes didn't come out until 13 years after the games release. RuneScape wasn't intended to be played solo, otherwise those modes would have been released sooner. It's a MMORPG, the premise of the game was to interact with others, even if you didn't want to trade with them they were still there.
---
I use LastPass. Many of my passwords are randomized now but still have some accounts with my old pass. It's not a dictionary word and has caps and special chars so it's nearly impossible to brute.
---
You sound like a cunt - OP's post is about him being in the miliatry and provides that as a reason, and you're giving people shit in the comments for discussing their similiar experiences?
---
Did you piss off an old gf who knows your username?

You should take your own advice.
---
In no way shape or form is it better to lamp herblore.
---
Well I sure hope you can remember where you moved? You can list all those locations when submitting a request. If you list all those locations and turns out the account was created on the other side of the globe then thats proof enough.
---
Edit: not trying to be a dick but what is with these arguments? It pretty simple. Yeah jagex has shitty customer service sometimes and its something they can get better at. However they are the ones with the details on the accounts not us.

probably the same reason you didnt think to put more scales in

The hilarious thing is that this guy is posting this exact clip as evidence that HE is right lol.

Storing old password hashes is no worse than storing the current password hash, as long as it's not being used to authenticate access on its own.

I feel like I'm losing my mind. Did you even watch the clip? Mod Mat K says in that clip that you are allowed to get money from other plays, stake it, and then pay them back afterwards. He says that.

Wouldn’t say so- I know a bunch of guys who went active but never deployed to a combat zone, they never brag or anything, I feel like that’s the one factor that seperates boots from non-boots

Does it work straight off without starting at lv 20? And is it only download and boom its ready
---
more sardonic, but yeah- my comment was just pointing out the similar feeling complaints in mid level content being added.

Cooking because wines are f2p

We don't know whether the last user of the account recovered it or used login details

I'm not commenting in support of it bub.

i have never understood this reddit-fabricated assumption that menaphos expansion is somehow guaranteed to come to osrs. why would it be? rs3 got it but that doesnt' mean it's slated for osrs lol

Everyone got a fresh account for old school. You’re character is probably in rs3
---
Question wasn’t really about this situation in particular, just generally
---
Lmao maybe stop getting hacked y'all
---
It's a niche gameplay some people enjoy over the normal mode. Obviously it's not a fail considering it's decent popularity. However it was popular before the ''official'' iron mode launched. I remember multiple streamers having an unofficial ironman and people enjoying it that way. The little crown doesn't really add to the concept, it doesn't add new content (outside of an iron set cosmetic), you'll just be doing the same stuff you've been doing for years, but again from level 1, now with 5 people instead of 1. Which was always possible to do. You're not waiting for the mode, you're waiting for the little crown. Which is fine on it's own. I understand the appeal for people who believe runescape can hold a level of achievement. But it doesn't add any new actual content. It's just a reason to make a new account and play the game. Which you can do now. 5 years ago. or in a few months with a little crown.

These are incredibly dumb questions that have no right to be asked. It's like asking "what if a player just alches all their valuables, runs to die with the coins in the wilderness, and then just never plays the game" about the normal version of the game. It's so. fucking. stupid.

You are saying we are ignorant. Meanwhile you are posting screenshots and clips that say that loan staking is legit behavior but claiming those same screenshots and clips say that loan staking is against the rules.
---
Your screenshot says it is against the rules to STEAL the money and RWT it. You clip that you keep posting straight up has Mat K saying that loan staking is legitimate behavior.
---
What happens if they never pay people their gp back? Nothing?
---
Yes friends, clan mates, not randoms on twitch.  This was literally discussed to fucking death when the rule was made and it just sounds like you weren't here.
---
You're just looking to argue at this point lmfao. You'd have to be a fucking idiot to think I said it was just a single 24 hour session and not 24/7 account sharing.
---
Same thing happened to me with my account, but it was like lvl 70 so I didn't care enough to go past not being able to get it back through the website. Eh, I can believe it sometimes.
---
Faux should go over and pay his respects
---
My main on OSRS is my account I made in 2005 for the current RS3... so wrong.
---
Didn't say staking with loans is against the rules (staking for viewers is, should of separated the thoughts better, my bad) I would like to see loan/debt streamers be banned/become a bannable offense to advertise the shitty streams and ask for loans ingame
---
Or he sold it, tried to recover it back, failed, and is now bitching on reddit.
---
Doesn't mean it was recovered.
---
Yes. It tells you which area and what quests to do for each level(s). There is the basic guidelime download then you have to find a Horde specific version. I use the Alliance version. If you ask in r/classicwow they might have better instructions for you, or even YouTube. I’m terrible at explaining things. The downloads are all off the Twitch App on PC. Download them, move them to a specific file in your game folder and restart game then it’ll appear when you hit “Escape&gt;Add-ons”.
---
He never says that in any way. Did you even listen to the full clip?
---
He never mentions friends or clan mates a single time.
---
He just says "They get out there and get money from people". Then he says that the behavior is legitimate. As long as you are taking loans and paying them back. Obviously taking loans and stealing the GP should be bannable behavior.
---
How have I never noticed that?
---
yerp
---
Agreed, it's not impossible. Really would have to depend on the rewards. 
---
Of course, he could finish the series prior to the release of that content, so the point might be moot.
---
My account I currently play on was made in 05
---
Nothing says staking for viewers is against the rules.
---
Quit trying to regulate the behavior of players just because they are live streaming it. If they aren't RWTing or stealing, it's fine.
---
I'm not sure if that's entirely true.  Jagex may be using IP to determine whether the original owner is in possession.  If the owner moved at any point, the IP would change as well.
---
If the owner can provide info like previous geographical location, creation date, and billing info, then that would shine a light as to him being the owner.
---
Of course I can be speaking out of my ass if Jagex isn't using IP's to determine the owner in the current statement.
---
This is a pretty common scam though.  People will create an account with Recovery Questions.  Level them up for a certain purpose like Zulrah, and sell them.  Someone buys them, levels them up for you, and eventually the account is recovered and password changed.  Being the account buyer, you have 0 ownership over the account as per Jagex's TOS.
---
There's also the possibility that OP is an egghead and was phished or ratted.  It's not uncommon in this sub.
---
Usually with twitch its only download and go and im alliance too, guess ill try that. Does it include doing dungeons too ?
---
staking content is hype as fuck?
---
u/shaperka
---
 hmm... seems familiar
---
Yeah I was having crazy lag and disconnects. Weird stuff.
---
&gt;it’s literally what EVERYONE has been begging for
---
Yeah. No.
---
Vanilla client is doing it too. I use RL, but wanted to test both clients.
---
Everyone knows Jagex will reset your account if you miss a login requirement

1962 total with no pets. I feel you.

35 minutes later I can't even move in the bank.

Pretty sure that was just a rumour
---
listen here wqzu, i get that ur trying to make this whole post about ur opinion of Swampletics, but do me a lil favor and shut that mouth of urs for the time being. And i don’t know what a “bellend” is but it sounds to me like you’re calling one of my best friends a no-good stinkin’ dumb kid, which he may be, but you’re not allowed to think so, only I am. So check yourself before you literally wreck yourself pal!
---
The reason RC gets more hate than agility is you dont run out of stamina training agility, change my mind.
---
Yes, because i do
---
And i recovered sold accounts, i never moved house
---
I really like the 10 FPS experience
---
no we dont need any gear that boosts max hp
---
Nah. Fuck locking content behind relying on other people.
---
Seems like /u/MandaTohru has a bit more close on his mind than what I had written.
---
Bithc
---
They get SHOT.
---
Dont play the game mode then lol
---
I mean if you actually wanted to link any proof that'd back up your claim there'd be nothing to argue about.
---
Fortnite is #1 cause of all the kiddies and because it appeals to people between 5 years and geriatrics, OSRS is basically us old farts that played when we were 12 and never reached our goals.
---
Nah kick that bitch to death.
---
Or if you have 55 slayer, rune crossbow + broad bolts can work too.
---
I do raids on mobile
---
Yea I couldn't move in the GE and got dc'd after about 30 seconds.
---
Wtf
---
Hi Mod Weath, I was wondering, if I play on an account that someone gave me at ~500 total level and I played it to 2200 and it was hacked, would I need to contact the account creator to get it recovered? I realize that it's technically their account but surely it's enough mine that, as long as it wasn't the creator who took the account back, I could recover it? Or is that just too much of a gray area?
---
ban them all for rwt
---
You nailed, OP is trying to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes.
---
Obor humanized
---
You have lots of experience repairing magical swords?
---
That is some dedication, I’ll stick to my herb runs and afk skilling.
---
probably because the desert lacks content (ok it IS a desert so that isn't too crazy) and if you look at the world map, it is the last area of the mainland to now be fully released. People want to see what's hiding in the dark areas
---
Dragon cbow is under 3m? Cool I might pick one up
---
l0l
---
Invis spec to spec pool to rev caves tele. Also an entire clan logging in with it active and just decimating some poor bloke unaware. It would be completely broken and literally ruin pvp.
---
It cleared me across all of them including rs3 :( it was a sad day. Happened about 2 years ago I think. There was a deadline I had to log in by, was planning on taking some time to get on that weekend. Friday huge Ice storm pops up out of no where, 4 days without power. Oh well though.
---
Thanks for your account!
---
Level 50 rc requirement
---
As long as you confirm it with everyone who knows who you are on the game you should be fine
---
Yeah I feel the same way. Like I’ll basically just be playing another regular Ironman that supplies the rest of my group with stuff.
---
If it would be possible, this would be great. If not, oh well it will still be great.
---
Humble
---
I think you're treating Group Ironman like it will be some kind of Call of Duty style matchmaking with randoms when in reality it would be people who already know each other grouping up.
---
absolutely love the gertrude's one
---
His Wanted! One didnt tell you where the zammy mage is in Edgeville. Had to look in the comments to know he's in the wildy. Wasted 20 minutes looking
---
I've been playing Runescape with the same friends I met through this game for over a decade now. This mode feels like it was made just for us!
---
It's definitely not for everyone, though.
---
Lol can’t believe people still say this.
---
For me it was cheaper to rent by being in a frat, you get social experiences, and a lot more job openings for internships. But gl paying double the money for a dorm and being lonely whining about chad stealing your girl and how the Greek sys ruined colleges
---
You care that someone can build an ironman account the same way they can build a main account, just need to invest more time and effort? Not to mention, they still can't loot items from kills unless they bring a main and wait for the loot to spawn...
---
Why does the community never just accept that they're both great for the game and unfortunately only one could have been picked?
---
ive always been wondering how they do that tbf lmao
---
do they literally hash every string and run it against your password hash every time you type ingame?
---
$11?
---
Exactly. Hashing operations are designed to be fast and some can be done millions of times per second on even low-end rigs. Meanwhile, storing passwords in plaintext in any circumstance is inviting catastrophe.

You’re acting like an ID is some secret document meant to be protected from anyone else’s eyes. This just adds another layer of verification that would be 10x more reliable then a security question.

Skotos at 1kc, no other pets after bossing for yonks. Used all my RNG at once.

Basilisk rerework coming? Or maybe ANY comment on the situation?

REDDIT SHOULD NOT BE YOUR FUCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE U COCKS!

Oof check this big man out

Just get the pet lmfao, isn’t that hard got bandos at 3 kc and Skotizo at 5 lmfao they aren’t that hard lmfao ( crying inside cus I’m 3k kc dry on Garg pet and it’s my all time favorite)
---
Two things the Mods have repeatedly said they don't want to buff:
---
1. The POH
---
2. Teleport Tablets
---
They say they regret giving barrows a teleport tablet, so I doubt they'll add it to the POH
---
This and it's much better money, I prefer ranging them with bracelets of slaughter
---
Wish that was the price for the dragon hunter crossbow...
---
Yeah seriously, I had a similar issue but got no help but since this guy reached out to Reddit he gets the help.
---
A lot of banks regularly issue new cards. I'm on my 3rd debit card since OSRS started
---
You get 2 games technically.
---
never
---
Lol you people are sure salty at them, when you look at the gaming industry as a whole Jagex is doing pretty well by us.
---
No
---
Unironically this
---
Yet when certain BIS/2nd BIS items are only obtainable in the wilderness through pvm, that's when an issue arises.
---
Useless, boring.   
---
When we didn't have a ge, people just used 3rd party websites (that sold your ip) to do the same. Majority of people want ge, those that don't play ironman
---
Yeah I heard about that. The poor soul. Once I heard that I stopped complaining about how long it was taking lol.
---
If we switch the words a bit in your comment we got our answer
---
&gt; I didn't think
---
That depends on the person. Do you want to invest in resource and time for revenge or move on and get back to your no exp waste grind?
---
I got smolcano at 2.1k ttl 14 kc. Bout fucking time jamex
---
Is that even possible
---
What about a literal virgins convention?
---
so I can expect curses to be released around the same time as jagex customer support
---
If there are people playing ironman mode simply because they don't want GE, and not because they specifically want a solo experience, then that right there is the target demographic for this mode.
---
It matters because one area is complete and could do with an expansion and the other is incomplete and could do with an expansion. One needs one thing, the other needs two. Put your priorities right in making the game better for the community that currently plays rather than catering to new people. Besides, an expansion of the desert area would open up the possibilities of Desert locked Ironmen youtube series which could be just as popular if not more popular than Settled's Morytania series which would in turn bring in twice the exposure. 
---
As others have said, Morytania got Theatre of Blood recently. What was the last MAJOR update to the desert? Sandstone grinder? I wouldn't consider that major, at all. Look at your map ([click here](https://imgur.com/0Bqhj06)) and take note of the desert area and Morytania. The desert is literally surrounded by black area that needs to be filled and/or put some sea there and/or a new island and/or expand on the current desert. Menaphos expanded is what most people want there.
---
They did that w song of the elves, hopefully this isn't a continuing trend
---
With group iron man, wouldn't it technically be possible to buy resources. You can join a group, trade them something like coins for whatever bulk item you're looking for, and then get kicked from that group  type of thing? Wouldn't that really defeat the purpose?   
---
Edit: This system just seems like it could be easily abused for a variety reasons, that defeats the purpose of having an iron man
---
I wrote 3 short sentences and you didn't even bother reading the last one before making that reply. Why are you being so stupid.
---
There's a 1% duel area tax if they're trading gold.
---
pretty sure its the second rarest pet behined inferno lol
---
Yes.  you have to make new accounts
---
When I say billing details I mean the name and address of the person who subscribed.  If the person who was paying for your account fifteen years ago has the same name as, you know, you, then Jagex knows it's your account.
---
If it was your mom who was paying for it back in the day (thank you mom) then you'll have an additional couple of hoops to jump through but being able to give the name and (at the time) address of the person who was paying for your membership is pretty strong evidence that you didn't buy your account on ebay.
---
I don't think it's funny
---
Did you even read my comment? Where in the hell is it ever implied that I am acting like people are begging me to play? I am the one who is begging myself to play the game again you dunce. But I know the grinding that I put into my old account back in the day, and do not want to go through that again. I wasn’t asking for anyone’s sympathy, I was just airing my grievances. And what do you mean, I am claiming I am not into it? I just fucking said that I still follow Old School RuneScape news because I still love the game and still want to try and play again? Need to practice your critical reading skills bud, you were not even close to what was actually said.
---
is this Return of Wilderness?
---
Yeah Lilsmokey has good editing but literally rode on the curtails of Settled. Rendi definitely deserves that win.
---
Just use the craws bow lmao
---
Say what you will about RS3, the smithing rework that lets people smith rune starting at level 50 only makes sense.
---
nty
---
I have stopped playing for a couple years now but you better believe I'll be nolifing again the second group Ironman comes out, along with all my friends who haven't played in years as well. If you want our 60 bucks a month jagex you're gonna want to hurry this up
---
There are so many good streamers out there lol why would anyone give the mentioned streamer type here the time of day? And why would anyone post about it when you could be promoting a stream that you actually enjoy?
---
Is it just me that sees the uk and Ireland
---
If he actually had grace he wouldn't need to apologize in the first place.
---
Bot farm? So, breaking the rules?
---
Losing 3M : Worthless

Fucking over an Ironman : priceless
---
Is it just me that sees the uk and ireland
---
Can someone explain please?
---
Yea, there’s a really simple method.
---
Download Gary’s hood, auto click the same tile for 8 hours a day, wait for temp ban. Repeat to get perm ban. Abandon account guilt free since you’re permed.
---
Really gives that nostalgic feel
---
Bet you think pineapples are apples too, nerd.
---
There *is* a lot of mid game content, but people ignore it all the time for efficiency. Just as with the basilisk knights, don't put bis on a low requirement activity. I don't think jaw should have come from basilisks at all, but if it were to it would make sense for them to be more than 60 slayer. Also, why have a 60 thieving req for an upgrade to a 75 hp req item with 90+ crafting req? Balance things out a bit.
---
Maybe you’re right. I will admit I am out of touch with the game to an extent, and just think of the old methods I used to do in order to grind for levels back in the day. I loved RuneScape for the fun it had though. That is why I still follow this sub, and every time I see you guys still enjoying the game it makes me want to jump back in. But not joking, I ALWAYS scare myself away from the idea cause I tell myself “but the fucking grind man”
---
For me to get from 54 to 78 rc paying 2 runners (large) at fire altar for lavas, would cost me 290m. 
---
And 3/4 of my soul.
---
I don't get the impression that engine improvements require them to rewrite old content. They've mostly talked about adding new functionality and improving performance.
---
QQ cry more lmao
---
Yeah sure. Definetly ways to prove account ownership and maybe this dude is still suspect lol.
---
You're not wrong, but I believe the problem is jagex usually won't (or in reality, simply *can't*) review each and every recovery request like this. That's why they require you to have access to your original email and answer security questions.  
---
  
---
Not a great system, but I don't think they have the manpower to look at each case and go "well the billing name has the same last name as the account holder  -  it must be his mum."  
---
Sucks for some people who have been hacked but it's reality.
---
Yeah you’re actually just a fucking idiot I guess lol
---
&gt;when she actually does this type of stuff for a living, is just unnecessary
---
Model, whore, it comes down to semantics.
---
That's the ham logo
---
RS3 has yet to get half the content promised in 2018... oh and 2017... and 2016...
---
I did, and i will use this example.
---
If someone doesnt win an oscar and they're like "Wow, I was the perfect actor and put so much effort in, why didnt I win?" How is that not indirectly saying that the one who won was inferior?

imagine chillin with the boys with your diy paper party hats and blanket 99 capes then you look out the window and see protesters getting rekt and their organs harvested right there on the street lmao
---
Enjoy that kraken. Took me 13.5k kc for mine
---
According to my loot tracker I’ve made just over 14m. This makes me feel even worse. 
---
I’ve also gotten more 3k coin drops than I can count on my fingers
---
I'd be down for this
---
I'm guessing his logic is because of the relation with Tokkul and Onyx.
---
One sounds fair but just would be hard to say who gets like usa or germany or aus
---
I recovered my account after like 8 years via email. Just gave them information to prove it was mine and they were like "yeah I guess it is yours. Here's a link to change the password"
---
Nobody will fuck wid ya if you got your slayer cape on bro, they know you mean business, bring a bullseye lantern next time CYA
---
Skotos is my only pet too. Got him at 4kc
---
Thats a lot of bonds
---
Most of the time its shit that makes it easier for PVPers to kill PVMers so of course pvmers will vote against it.
---
My guy achtungl was just afk, hes usually a nice talkative chap
---
All this bit of information could help with account recovery if it matches what the Jagex mods have. You would not know any of that if you bought an account.
---
Happend to my friend. Happened while he was in discord with us. It's 100%
---
Mirages when your waterskins get low?
---
I really think the swamp can be put on back burner for a little bit for the desert, Before RS3 releases Menaphos I was saying we should make it OSRS' Priff.
---
Repost
---
Yeah I know its kind a of thing here. and the  more you defend yourself the more people jump on the train (hence my trolling =p) I wish it wasn't like that but that how it be sometimes. But yeah the game is a lot more streamlined now since its return and we are all older now, so if you ever did wanna jump back on the grind its really not as bad as you think it is to get to some really fun content.
---
Also got mine on 63, at like 1200 total lol. Luck is a strange thing.
---
It's good for CoX, for mystics and shamans. Yes, BP is better at those, but for mystics most the time you're better off using a crossbow so you don't aggro them all, and shamans is just a huge pain in the ass with BP, most people choose to use a crossbow. If somehow you were doing a budget inferno run, and couldn't afford ACB, it'd be a huge buff vs RCB. Also various safespot cases where you have to be far enough that you can't use BP, like basilisk knights or wyverns.
---
She really made me insecure for playing this game. Calling the mods nerds. Why not Mod Gee to host this event?
---
This is the true reason
---
Well I had to create 2 more recovery attempts after they requested it by email.
---
&gt;butt fuck no where
---
I will use this every chance I get XD
---
Hmm that just sounds like bad rng 1 mark of grace in 5-10 runs sounds really bad lol.
---
Eah I mean I stayed in a B&amp;B that was a 10 minute walk from the venue.
---
he probably will leave to do it, he cheated anyway by having a quarter of the players looking for implings for him. dude is over rated, props on the money hes makin from it tho
---
I have an erocktion.
---
As a non-pvm God myself I always appreciate perspectives from people who play like me. I'm leveling up herblore to 78 but I think I may need to level up combat a little more (89 att, 90 str, 80 def, 90 rng, 84 mg) before I can reliably solo but I'm going to give it a shot with my stats. Thanks for your advice, hope the RNG sways in your favor :) cheers mate
---
No but he DOES HAVE some of these emails. Just not the creation one.
---
Ita an archaic system and people should expect jagex to fix the system rather than circlejerking about 'JMOD SMACKDOWN' When a mod finally comes in.
---
God why rs player such losers. Not it wouldnt have. Jmods are awkward as hell. Same as rs players. Hence you need a socially adept person to get the flow going sometimes.
---
Yeah it was sad because he seemed like a smart guy. I really enjoyed all of his content. He used a lot of hardstyle music in his videos and he got me into the genre too.
---
Hopefully he got it together
---
This makes no sense.
---
Im not sure anything even exists above birmingham... let alone has running water. Jagex would be pretty irresponsible to move it. Love from a filthy southener ;)
---
Yabba Dabba Do me right here babe
---
That doesn't answer my question though. If information from 11 years ago isn't acceptiable, what should Jagex use to prove account ownership instead? 
---
I think this is a valid concern that you're bringing up. But what does the alternative look like?
---
I thought he was trying to imply Jad will only melee if you stand in rage, lol. My bad.
---
Oktober skeleton memes
---
W302 are bulk Sellers, prepare to pay more than ge price. Or just ask friends to all put in an offer for the buy limit
---
Then design it so PvMers aren't sitting ducks. Assuming two players equally skilled, the PvMer will always have the disadvantage because the loss of inventory space and taking certain gear that's not PvP optimal.
---
Seriously though, I'd love an rc guild.
---
I calculated it about 3 minutes before I started recording
---
Gary's doesn't get you banned unfortunately
---
Remember when people played for fun instead of 'xp-waste mentality'?
---
I share this viewpoint and while you weren't talking to me, I completely agree. This resonated with me and I don't mind investing a little more time if it means I can learn the in's and out's of CoX and not have to rely on others whilst also being able to pull my own weight and possibly more if I do ever do group raids.
---
Seems like Mammal is just casually sniffing his hair with that "what the fuck am I doing"- look
---
Lulz, "we don't need 500 ironman modes" 
---
&gt;says that after playing hcim 
---
Just because you're happy with your ironman mode, doesn't mean that we are happy too.
---
You're just mad because mithrilman mode or bronze man mode will de-value ur red little helmet xD LULZ
---
But increasing the risk of gear makes it a more fun game. When you have a whole hour to get your stuff back, it's becomes too easy and mundane to achieve higher tier gear.
---
I took the risk to get my imbued god cape and that was the most fun I've had on this game in a long while. Got pked a few times and lost a lot of runes. But I also had the runes to dish out some fire waves and fight back to the pker's surprise. Got away with purely the element of surprise once. Even though I lost about 300k it was *fun* because (gasp) it's just a videogame.
---
Fighting barrows when I know I have a whole hour to get my shit back when I die doesn't exactly get my adrenaline going like the wilderness does.
---
If you're not willing to take any risks then you have to come to terms with the fact that you're not going to achieve the same as people who do (just like real life).
---
It is an MMO game after all...
---
Can't be done anymore. There is currently no known way to reach level 2 herblore.
---
Support. 
---
My friends who came back from it said that whilst they enjoyed it the location choice was awful to the point they won't be going next year if it's in Farnborough.
---
The response said they responded with the same info through the legitimate customer service avenue. Only thing this did was bring it to OUR attention.
---
I think most people have never even used thrown weapons lol
---
And I'm quite sure ol' vorky fireballed you 20 times during that lag
---
weird, from 0 - 45 I got a total of 29 MoG, between 45-50 I got 21
---
Osbuddy sigh
---
Well if you were planning on risking it that's a good thing
---
Nah I think every one agrees she was out of place but just who to blame her or the people who hired her
---
If you're moving around a lot like some people do, it'd be hard to remember. I have a buddy that travelled with his dad for work because there was no one at their regular home to take care of him. He would be in anywhere from 6-10 cities a year. At that point, asking "What city were we in in 2014" could have several different cities as an answer.
---
ur mum is runecrafting ur mom
---
I got mine at 7kc too wtf is this
---
Too dumb to discuss with unfortunately. You come across as passive aggressive all whilst wearing your Jagex tinfoil hat. I'll let you talk with Eddie Bravo in a corner on your own, buddy.
---
You’re not replying to any of them
---
I don't really think this should be patched.. kind of a waste of time
---
Likewise with your comment. I get so many people that comment on my name and we go back and forward with jokes. Best name I've ever had in RS for sure.
---
Kill it with a rune short sword
---
Oh wow thanks for the enlightenment that makes things much easier to distinguish! Not really, again you need to make an automated program capable of figuring these things out entirely on its own with no human intervention and a very small false-positive rate. The bot detection faces the same issue. You could easily walk around lumbridge yourself on an f2p world and say yep that's a bot, ban, yep that's a bot, ban, but manually doing that by hand is just not viable.
---
There is no guarantee

Hmmm it hasn’t been shown how the banking system will work. It’s either everyone shares one bank, which would be hard to track. Or more likely it’ll be separate banks with shared bank like raids 1. In which case wouldn’t be too easy to steal since you could only put things in the shared bank your friend needed.

Usually events like these charter a shuttle bus to nearby accommodations. Seems really bizarre and unsafe to force people to figure things out in the middle of nowhere themselves.
---
$5/month gang represent
---
Haha so basically every boss becomes 3-4 high tier items and the rest shit you're willing to risk? You'll kill the game at this point.
---
&gt;a new boss with no rewards
---
They're not going to release a boss with no rewards
---
OR trade your friend, but yeah i wont be playing that sadly since i dont have friends, i would be interested to come back to RS for that but eh
---
Well actually £12.50 it would be $15.38
---
I have fury, and I have a BGS sitting in my bank- you were right about barrows, I finished mm2 and ds2 before finishing rfd, so i am literally half a quest (stopped midway through desert treasure) before getting barrows gloves
---
the fuckin' way of the road bud
---
Mystics you're better off getting them melee stuck, or if you're in a scale of like 3-8 you're almost always fine just tanking them. Having an extra brew instead of the crossbow will met you more hp through that room.
---
This type of post is much better than the brainlet pker meme meta.
---
However actually getting revenge and smiting a plus 1 item will net you only a few hundred upvotes, but a post making fun of a straw man pker splitting your spade amongst five others would net a few thousand.

&gt;Don't worry, everyone screaming about group ironman will drown out the reasonable concerns about lack of actual content updates for the entirety of 2020...

This game desperately needs huge overhauls of its core systems, they have to do this eventually and I'd rather they did it sooner than later
---
No its not fine. Settled chose to be a dick and needle the man just for fun, his input wasn't required and all he did was escalate it.
---
This is awesome! I love the quest complete scroll man- you found a good one ;)
---
Okay thank you :)
---
I guess that makes it fair
---
Shame we got to wait a potentially long time
---
Per trip
---
Get those barrows gloves my friend you won’t regret it, and getting ancients is worth it as well. Barrows gloves and fire cape and you’ve got the basics for melee dps bandos
---
What can’t we own in particular?
---
I got tangleroot at 28 farming
---
I love the reference to getting 200 death tunes for your cat lol
---
I never said ironmen are not allowed to complete it. Ironman content should be solo. Only if solo really isn't possible/viable, they should be allowed to go in team. That's why I proposed teaming ironmen to be polled like a month later, when it is known if solo is viable or not.
---
Which is a kill

Wanna get stabbed

The new osrs twitch meta. I remember the good old days when it was just viewbotting scam links and recordings of other streamers. "Going to quit read to find out why."
---
Name checks out
---
Along with the dollar store mouse click noises. Top tier production value in these videos.
---
Yeah but then I lose membership and bonds name swap and I like my login name
---
Well yeah duh the ones in priff lol
---
If they know your account details, turning off 2FA is very easy. You can also just disable the PIN and wait it out. Sometimes I go a while without playing depending on how busy I am. Lately I find myself periodically logging in just to make sure my authenticator is active and my bank pin isn't deleted/being deleted.
---
I think about that all the time... idk how people have time to make alts to get to that level when my main can’t even do that type of content yet
---
I didn't say I kept statements from when I was 9 and that's vital for a mortgage? I said from when I first had an account and worked. To show how long you've been with a bank, when you've transitioned between jobs, for proof of address, to prove your history of on-time payments to landlords. All of which can be vital towards getting accepted for a mortgage from a reputable company and for good rates. 
---
Okay, well that's different, jagex would then ask for the details from when you first transitioned to card payments, if you never did, they'd ask for subtle details on how you made your payments and from what landline etc. It's really not that hard.
---
Figured that's what it would be when I first heard about it due to Diablo. Was disappointed on release.. ):
---
I did, but still I failed
---
Was a lot of "multitasking"  
---
Switching prayers, gears it was a pain
---
I guess this is like PK
---
It took me about 30 attempts to kill her the first time. Another 30 to finally have it “clicked”. I just got it recently it’s a very fun boss
---
You can? you don’t even need to put your life on hold. You can pause and log out any wave you want. Stop making up excuses that you got a wife and 4 kids. You don’t need a high end pc or laptop either. Assuming you’re maxed you’ve put many hours in the game and I’m assuming you still do, so what’s REALLY stopping you from learning Inferno? Tons of guides out there aswell but ok.
---
It's not a moneymaker if the price falls. The price was inflated by Jagex because people complained about it thus the buffs to the knights.  There's no way you can justify a helm that gives +1 bonus over previous BiS and +3 over the more commonly used helm costing that much except "it devalues my maxed account if med levels can have access to 1 BiS item."
---
Btw, i don't think the drop should have come from them anyways, but that is where Jagex is adamantly trying to keep it
---
I actually really like that. I feel like mining essence and selling it is the Varrock east bank was so iconic in the early 2000s. At this point pure essence is pretty much useless, so I think it would be cool to bring something back that would incentivize people to mine essence (or something like it). It’d be pretty sweet if it gave like 30k mining xp/hr. If it was really afk id definitely do that to bank some increased rc xp while getting decent mining xp.
---
Everyone just goes out on weekdays for the student nights now.
---
Convert one of the f2p 750 worlds into 1000 (preferably w385) as a test, no member worlds affected. All contentions solved. I've been over 1000 total for a while, highest stat at 85 crafting, base 70cb, lowest at 50 runecrafting. I've been planning on getting 65rc and all other f2p skills to minimum hard diary requirements before members. I don't play consistently enough to justify the cost of p2p before knocking out these skills in f2p, although I'll be over 1100 f2p total by that point.
---
How can you disable the 2FA without logging in...
---
The second someone tries to sign on with a weird IP ill get a message
---
I hope beef flap stuck makes good progress
---
That was actually really good for first attempt. You brought out all healers quick and was pretty on point with pray switches.  My first 3 attempts I died a lot faster. Now I get Jad as a slayer task and try to beat my fastest time. U got next attempt for sure.
---
"No deaths" wym bro I see you get smacked around daily lol
---
Can confirm however they sold my bank and bought a mansion
---
THE ANTE

This is a robbery! handssssss in the air!

nice grats

Go try, nobody will do it because why the hell would you?
---
I’m interested you got more rubies than emeralds!
---
Oh ok
---
I really want Fist of Guthix, Runecrafting Guild and Dungeoneering in OSRS

Was gem mining worth it on an ironman? Whatre u gunna use all those diamonds for

What is loan staking? How do you get a loan on osrs gp?
---
What do they hold over you to take if you can’t pay them back?
---
I feel like staking in general is a really iffy system in the game.
---
Man of Steel mode. You get a little Superman symbol instead of a helmet.
---
This is the content I come to this sub for
---
I went 2898 bass dry, I was starting to think i was doing something wrong... But you took it to another level lmao im proud of you for sitcking through it
---
Right, but account security and account recovery are absolutely two different things - both of which need to be addressed.
---
This made me laugh so hard. Thanks OP.
---
Unless you have a use for the AOE spec like PC
---
:(
---
In late 2005 I managed to get to Jad not once, but twice. Each time took me about 6 hours. Because I used the meta of 'stand behind the rock and regen hp'.
---
I didn't get my fire cape until 2010.
---
An absolute WEAPON
---
is this designed to be a similar area to that of the one in rs3? I always loved this quest series in rs2/3 and the zone.
---
just looking at the map and seeing the bank and middle room reminds me of the old zone
---
Pfft 17 ain't nothing. I failed for an hour straight then rage quit for a year to do other crap
---
Yeah nothing to do with the actual robes SMH
---
What was Mod Weath's exact words? I'd like to know since I missed it.
---
Just discovered the joy of sulliuceps, got 70 fossils in one day and 77-79 woodcutting, plus 72-73 rc from the exp lamps
---
Years ago
---
at least he did cerb and got 4 prim crystals
---
I believe Canifis has a pretty high spawn rate of marks of grace compared to other courses. I think it has something to do with the number of obstacles or something.
---
Nobody said go stake except the gambling addiction in the back of your mind. And it's not 50/50 because of the tax
---
One of the boys was getting married so we all met up for the first time :) goes to show that not everyone in the community is toxic and you can really make lifelong friends on a video game.

Gee, didn't think I'd be doing this, but I'm pretty sure WoW has neither of those things though I haven't followed it at all for like 9 years.
---
the names
---
Likely tbow, in the pic say max hit 70 Like tbow except on huge massive raids.
---
On my Zeah only ironman I can get xp in RC through the Arceuus library without doing Rune Mysteries, not sure about lamps though.
---
Quest is master, actually
---
This devalues my cod to tbow pure
---
Congrats! I got mine a few days ago, but then a trimmed 99 fishing cape yesterday. So the qpc got a whole day of use out of me
---
It's pretty easy. Chaos ele is super easy to setup (safespot no flinch needed) and respawns really fast. Venenatis south lure is pretty good too and chance for treasonous/snap drops, but is a hotter place for pkers
---
Edit: Getting DP even with just dbolts(e) is like a 8-10 hour task with average luck. Hardly that bad compared to gem rocks until 99 mining.
---
Its called the abyss
---
Only npc who sell capes wear em tho
---
I thought U didn’t own a knife
---
Nice
---
Yea look sorry I forgot that OSRS was the only game with subscriptions my bad
---
nothing wrong with that. they do extra damage that can't be blocked, unlike dragon bolts (e)
---
I was in situation similar situation. Joining late to the party I had some pking anxiety. 
---
I made a 42 def 60 attack voider. 
---
It's a very OP pvp build but you have to risk more than 1 def making it harder to get into pking
---
I did my 69 slayer req all with Krystilia and made 30m learning to Brid at LMS. Now I'm very comfortable in the wild.
---
42 def opens up a lot of content, things like slayer and Zulrah are much more viable. 
---
They are also really fun to build, a bunch of questing and a few skill reqs but in general the least grindy build there is
---

Cool story bro.

You are a mind reader it would appear. Putting your own thoughts into OP's post.

Owen Wilson “WoW”.
---
Best is my pet luck, 14kc vorki and 4kc galvek on the main and 1kc jad on my 60atk med lvl. 
---
Worst is probably black mask on my iron, took around 3200 kills
---
edit: gauntlet not galvek
---
Skotos on 1KC BTW.
---
What happens if he dies?
---
I really didn't like the constant taunts and jabs at Kemp Q in Rendi's video. I think it shows the same lack of respect as his golden gnome Twitter response and is the real reason he didn't win. An 18 combat fire cape is an amazing achievement, sure, but making a video as a fuck you to another content creator isn't cool and shouldn't be rewarded.
---
Not sure if a joke or not but they did talk about it and said that even if they want to bring something that was back then they cant re-use the same code and have to write it all again and only refer to old code if they need help with understanding how stuff worked.
---
&gt;God why rs players such losers.
---
He says with shitty grammar, on the OSRS subreddit. Dumbass. I would rather listen to a slightly awkward Jmod than some obnoxious hire who knows fuck all about the game.
---
rc bad meme good

I heard his pants are sagging
---
Please calm down
---
RIP Cabin Boy Jenkins
---
I always found the abyss the pseudo Rc Guild. 
---
What more can you ask for than to have access to every rune alter and a "combat" minigame to get rune pouches.
---
Plus staking exists.
---
Agility is easier to maintain EHP rates. It also takes less time to 99.
---
Runecrafting is harder to maintain EHP rates, but offers much more afk less efficient (but still really good) exp/hr post 77
---
Don't make a f2p ironman. Thieving is crucial to early game.
---
I got farming pet at 98 farming. Sorry
---
This is the guy to kill you in the wilderness agility course
---
Looks like your gf needs some hides
---
The meta was to bring 2 crystal bows because of the stat degradation
---
That's why I found it disappointing when I read that they don't want to add new quests if it doesn't have some great reward attached to it. Why can't a quest just be a quest?
---
I think something that could be pretty cool would some kind of roaming world boss based in the desert. I know it’ll probably never happen but i always loved the idea of overworld bosses
---
Yeah it's not really something worth arguing for me, I accept that is just something different people have different opinions on. I personally would rather make rcing fun rather than faster or afk to keep both parties happy.
---
Yea at basilisk knights it makes no sense to drop 1 noted herb
---
Reminds me of the HD graphics.
---
Ohhh gotcha. But does it require a fresh account? Or can Ironman already In game to join?
---
mama mia
---
"my account got recovered  and im the original maker!"
---
As a normie acc, I can also confirm.
---
If a new cape came out that's as good as the inferno cape without a pvm challenge requirement as hard as the inferno I do think most people would be angry about it being devalued.
---
His plat tokens is going to be coin drops and alchs.
---
There's already a RC Update coming to morytania. It's essence that gives 50% more exp than pure essence. Was announced in the new Dev Blog.
---
Gertrude's is amazing but Desert Treasure really resonates with me. Been playing since the game was released but I suck and recently built up the courage to finish DT. Was so happy!
---
this is a mmo.
---
winter 2017
---
The game ABSOLUTELY needs discontinued items.  It's a level of gameplay on the pyramid that is almost impossible to attain, thus, it keeps the end game alive for much longer.  In-depth game theory, but it's necessary.  Imagine rs3 without phats/santas etc.
---
Maybe not really alt, but when you play on an IM/pure you can afk on your main
---
***(bETTER THAN EXPECTED)***!
---
these video titles for extra views are hilarious
---
It was possible which was why they fixed it. It was pretty silly for a while there.
---
Honestly, good.
---
Barrows tabs were a mistake. Barrows portal would be so OP it's not even funny. Keeping the Arcedus teleports as spells only would have been best.
---
live and die by the long con, you gotta respect it.
---
He did Sire, Kraken, and KQ from the looks of it, probably thermy as well.
---
How do i know this is a hcim?
---
I agree. The people who I was talking about would be against your opinion too. Any change in the xp or the "fun-ness" would go against their "If I had to suffer through it, you do to" world view.
---
Pretty sure he's talking about me as there was only 4-5 women in wheelchairs there and I was there the latest. 
---
Didn't get any offers of help, and while I had to wait a while I got a taxi home both nights, it wasn't impossible like the OP says. Speaking purely about accessibility I much prefer farn over London as it's much easier to get around inside, things are more spaced out so they can make queues wider and easier for me to use. I can get dropped off outside the door by a taxi instead of half a mile away like the last venue. Taxis dont cost me £50 like London too, and I don't have the "just walk" option to avoid paying it. Hotels around here are much more accessable with plenty of adapted rooms. I ended up in a hotel an hour's drive away last time it was in London as all closer hotel rooms only had 1-2 accessable rooms which were booked up right away.
---
I'd rather people don't use me as an excuse to push their own agenda. Already had someone falling on me used as a reason to cancel the balloon drop (which I loved).
---
incenerator. also double check on explorer ring, if u can get tier 1, do it on that instead of 4. (can u go back?)
---
Thats not how this works. The content and engine teams are entirely separate. On top of that, engine changes don’t affect existing content unless intended to do so.  The only time the content team is on hold for the engine team is when they’re waiting for new features.
---
That said there are exceptions to this but they’re rare and not true enough to stop a years content. The team specifically said they left time open to allow the community to propose major content and it not have to wait until 2020 to be worked on
---
Sitting of 50 Keys now. Would love it they have a chance for the uniques, but I give it a 2% chance that they will include a roll for it.
---
It just seems dumb to let somebody leech exp... also what if I joined a group, sat afk for a month and leech a ton of exp then left? Now I have super nice stats and did absolutely nothing to achieve them...
---
They do have a fair chunk of microtransactions in wow though tbf.
---
bro i got blask mask on my iron within 20 kills a few weeks ago, but i was almost 3x dry on brine sabre so it kinda evened out
---
But what if both sides of the border offer options? You stay on ur side, I’ll stay on mine
---
I did, yep.
---
;)
---
Tbh, you should just go member.
---
The quests and member skills are not crucial to money making early on but they speed things up a ton and getting slayer up ASAP makes end-ish game gp easy.
---
You can quest for a few days straight and easily hit 50s in most areas just getting requirements and rewards.
---
If anything, pay for 1 month of member and kick out the quests and specific content (like Wintertodt) and in that 30 days you'll easy be able to fund a bond if you're active enough.
---
False. Me and the boys gonna be going for max and we are just tryhards without a stream.
---
GREAT ORB PROJECT &lt;3333333
---
Can you imagine Barbarian Runecrafting? Rune Masters? Marks of Rune? 
---
Dare we imagine content that would make Runecrafting a rewarding experience?
---
The proposed morytania changes do highlight a new type of essence that can be used in place of pure essence for higher xp rates.
---
It won't be more efficient for ironmen or someone doing both the mining and rune rafting themselves, but would boost rates for those that are willing to pay, similar to essence runners now.
---
Edit: Just had a look back through this and I was wrong, the new essence will be untradeable. Suppose it makes runecrafting slightly more bareable if you prefer doing the mining to runecrafting though.
---
Best possible scenario Winter of 2020. Most likely date Summer of 2021.

I know mate, and it was funny don't worry lol
---
I was just being observational, as in there'd actually be an endless list of profiles &amp; names they could use &amp; I bet they'd be somewhat successful.
---
Still less exp per hour than current aids methods. Inb4 people commenting hurr durr you can pay runners to get 200k exp per hour.
---
Love it. I may need a season recap.
---
Blade isn’t bis anywhere, anywhere you could use blade scythe is better. It’s basically an item to fill a niche usage between tent whip and scythe.

Group Ironman house
---
Yeah that sucks. My friend group has been friends outside of rs it just happened we all played it back in 05-07. We all met playing lol, dayz, and csgo 
---
 years ago lol.
---
I'm saying if you were to face someone of equal skill, you would be at a direct disadvantage. If that guy fought someone who's just as skilled as him instead of salad robe pkers with a water staff and rune crossbow, he'd be losing more on average. If you do anything in the wildy, you know why that lost inventory space is important. If the odds were more even, then you'd have people who'll fight back instead of using Dihn's and black dhides to tank to safety.
---
It's untradeable so basically less exp per hour than current methods
---
Legally no.
---
Nah you just sound like you like the smell of your own shit? Also I’m not sure what mgtow is
---
you clearly don't have 2k+ raids, prove it please. You probably have like 20 kc doing 50min raids and don't even understand the problem of the current system.
---
you definitely could still avg like 80k an hour with blind solos just fine. i just do the first ovl raid i get for solos, takes like 30-50s for scout np. the update a while back definitely made scouting unnecessary if you dont want to do it. if you arent self scout solo/alt scouting you really should just do the first rope raid you get.
---
Nope, I never talk when pking and at the most on death/kill I just say gg/gf
---
I was wondering how long it would take Android to do that hahaha 
---
Yer I just worked that out myself and updated my post haha
---
Sure when I get home I’ll post my raids kc. I don’t know what CLEARLY says I don’t have 2k raids kc. You’re just making a issue out of something that really isn’t and now you’re salty.

Sandwich Lady's house. You're just the butler. Go make me a sammich.

&gt; killing off all bots at once would likely also kill the game tbh.
---
... No?
---
It was only revealed yesterday at RuneFest and has yet to be polled
---
It seems like shortcuts will be cool in the future but right now it’s pretty disappointing lol.
---
it is actually an issue, it's plain bad game design and I never said we should be allowed to pick and choose our bosses, only the size of the raid, which seems very very reasonable if you compare it to TOB where you can just go in and always get the same.
---
it's not downgrading though??

- Cannot support yourself from your RS content and are a NEET
---
- Your relationships, grades, and friendships take a toll because of your Scaping
---
- Ever needed to use a piss bottle or shat in your clothing not to waste potential XP
---
I don't mind people being into EHP, but you're sweaty if your Runescape EHP is the onlything in your life.

If you have the herb sack. What I meant was to the mobs drop table itself. Whereas just having all be able to go in would be a buff to the herb sack and not a nerf to the mobs drops (removal of noted herbs)

We get it. Someone posts this exact comment daily here.

No but rigour is very nice.

It was revealed in Runefest and isn't polled yet.

you can tell the layouts that are 5cs just from the start room though. just instaleave.

Runespan anyone? I legit enjoyed that shit back before eoc became a thing.  Prior to and after runespan I've never trained RC past like lv 20 but when runespan was around I think I got to 70 or 80 and didn't wanna cut my eyeballs out
---
Damn.. I used to play runescape back in ‘06/‘07 with like 2 friends I had then. I honestly fell in love with the game right away and my friend and I would wake up after “going to sleep” and sneak on our computers to play for an hour or few late at night into the morning. Don’t think I ever got caught.
---
Anyways, I just came back here to look into seeing if people knew of a question I have. I read your post of course, and I cried quite a bit. I’ve been thinking about suicide recently and that whole “see you all when I respawn in lumby” really hit me. I wish I could switch places with you man, I really do. And I wish you could respawn in the lumby that we all first discovered our love for this gem.
---
I’m not sure if I’ll be getting back into this game, but if I do, I will do my best to collect rune cbow for you. Honestly this whole thing doesn’t feel right, even though I don’t know you.
---
It’s been 58 days since you posted this. Almost 2 months.. I really hope you read this and are still with us. Damn man. But I’ll see you in lumby after that respawn. It’ll be nice to meet someone like you.
---
I don't get it, is this refering to something?
---
They want something on the same level of Ely so it'll be big
---
I'm guessing the quest will introduce a new crush wep that will finally overtake the hasta
---
Aww sorry that sucks
---
Players who have reached high levels in the skill feel it devalues their achievement if the skill becomes easier to level.
---
While I can understand that, I feel like it really puts a barrier on getting new content that isn't going to be dead on release.
---
New content is difficult enough to implement with powercreep and the likes.

Manchester would be good. The G-Mex convention centre is easily accessible by a train to Deansgate. I went there once for MCM Comic Con and it was fantastic.

I thought it worked with everything except for a couple of funny things like javelins
---
Personally I don't care that much. But I know the community would never vote for something that increased RC xp rates.
---
How is GIM not considered a lower IM? It's overall an easier experience than IM. An IM stepping down to a GIM wouldn't significantly affect the leaderboard just like a maxed UIM stepping down to IM doesn't affect the leaderboard in any significant way
