Nice video. You can also lure it to the bank. If you join "Splashworlds" Cc, we usually have one lured. It is all right next to a bank booth.

Just add the Twitter account to your Tweetdeck account. Even if the password of the account is changed, you'll always have access through Tweetdeck.

Unless they revoke the App access, which is somewhere deeply hidden in your settings nowadays, you can keep using it.  You'll still be able to Tweet, Retweet, Like, Send &amp; Read DMs, etc.

Jesus you twist things. I said people want to level up. Someone else suggested you can do that through pvp. I pointed out that's only combats which don't take long to max.  I never said you need 99 stats for pking lol.

You're referring to Boss slayer where you can get wildy bosses?
---
1. It's a toggle, you accept the risk of getting a wildy task when you toggle it on.
---
2. Krystilia assigns the wildy bosses much more often so I don't see an issue with Duradel assigning them very rarely.
---
3. Just skip them, they're so rare, or you can just choose the lowest amount and do that so quickly.

ok?

If the community wants it, sure.

He wasn't staking to stake, that's just gambling. He was looking for people that were attempting to scam and by playing by their rules gain an advantage against them. I guess a lot of stakers also RWT, but I'm not sure what that has to do with this instance...

I mean "ruining their experience" is a bit much. If I give some nub without a trident or ahrims camping barrows I might throw him 500k maybe a mil towards that upgrade. This entire game is a nonstop grind, and me giving someone 500k as a little bonus towards it isnt ruining their experience. It's not like people are handing out bandos chest plates to every nub they see using a magic shortbow in full rune... its like they got a double item drop from a barrows chest... unlikely to happen again any time soon but much appreciated none the less. How do you think that's ruining someone's experience?
---
He states this himself in that very antiscamming video. You ragging on a video you didn't even watch lol? üòÇ

The feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction is being replaced by short term happiness.
---
Imagine playing this game, learning how to do stuff and how to upgrade gear, and finally being able to afford full rune armour. That feeling of accomplishment is being taken away from many players because pelple give them 200k.
---
People who do barrows are not noobs and has likely been playing this game for a while already.
---
I agree that it is not going to be easy to fix, but neither are botting or bug abuse and they get a lot of attention, rightfully so because they bring a lot of money into the pockets of the wrong people. Scamming/luring does that as well while taking money out of the pockets of good players.   
---
1. I would like to be able to report people who are actually involved, a lot of scams nowadays happen with more than 1 account, whether it is the same person does not matter. But anyone who has not actually typed in the chat can not be reported for scamming and luring is not even in the report options.
---
2. The point I want to mention would be a customer support page where you can submit evidence , a lot of players have recording software or screenshotting tools to snap any moment in time and save it. A page on the osrs website to submit an account name to report with proof could be helpful. I'm not saying this will solve everything but imagine I record an actual discord call and screen where the guy describes for me what to do like in a lot of lures. It could help Jagex out a lot, but sadly since this is customer support related this will probably not ever happen even though they wouldn't actually need to reply just review the evidence.
---
3. Jagex has a bot busting/reviewing (not sure what to call it) team, they take out a lot of bots which the bot makers don't care about since they will just make a new account. But my question relates to high level scammers. Like runescapememe delightfully commented if you run into the GE with really valuable items sometimes multiple people try it on you. The accounts that actually try this are not made in a week, these are sometimes maxed accounts. The person who tried it on me was maxed and used a high leveled alt. Even if he bought the account a quick google search showed me a maxed account costs you over $1k. These people have something to lose by being banned and the person who tried it on me proved that with the quickness of his double name change.   
---
If you finished the game and wish to now spend your time scamming people and you actually get banned on your maxed account, do you do it again? I'm guessing a dedicated person or even a Jagex employee that does this once a week can make a difference. 
---
4. Patch lures, this one is pretty simple. Some lures are our there in plain sight and well known. Why is it we can still telegrab from safezones to inside the wildy? Or why are the safezones for Barbarian assault different in pvp and high risk pvp worlds?
---
I don't know if any of this would suffice or even work. But Jagex could maybe think of other ways that would be effictive. I'm asking if Jagex is taking the problem into consideration, already or in the future, and will try to combat it.
---

Well said - it‚Äôs not about what a person has done in the past, it‚Äôs about how they made up for their actions and how they act in the present.
---
These people arent baby animals that you feed for a few weeks, nurse back to health and then send back out into the wild expecting it to fend for themselves. They are human beings that just need time to learn how the game works. Giving someone 500k doesnt replace that "feeling" youre talking about. It gives them a short term boost of happiness that can actually act as motivation to keep grinding. The very next accomplishment they achieve isnt diluted because someone gave them some gp....

But if its 2.99 a pound that means one snapdragon @ .007KG = ~3 cents per herb.

Nobody on this sub is against PKers having a reliable method to make cash.
---
What peeps are up-in-arms about is the fact that literally anybody could have abused the rushed BH mechanics that were implemented by JaGeX with 50 fresh bots to make tens of millions of gp an hour. 
---
You're missing the point entirely. Just because it was good for your "average PKer" does not mean it's good for the economy of the game. Pumping millions upon millions into the economy will only deflate the spending value of the gp and cause everything to rise in price, which doesn't bode well for everyone else.
---
By all means, give PvP a way to make steady money, but fucking test it first to make sure it can't be abused by the botters out there. That's all anyone is asking for.

sold mine when it was crashing at 108, brought it back for 92 lol.
---
I also brought a lance for 91  to try out melee vork which was ass on my ping and sold it for 97...
---
.. it is exactly the same lol. Back in the day was less than 3 years ago that it was still a problem, i was playing and remember i also remember playing for a couple years on constantly disconnecting aussie servers. Also jagex have stated recently that they have been under sustained ddos attacks on their servers. 
---
Even a change like making so people loose items again but other people just cant loot, would be no different than the ddos risk people face now. Something needs to change and point out ddos for a reason to stay the same is a bad idea
---
I mean, it's not an invalid argument to make? Leave risks like that in the wild, I'd like to have at least a modicum of comfort doing normal PvM knowing that if I die, I can safely get my stuff back. It's why I like the idea of Zulrah and CoX where there's no real danger per se, but you do get punished for dying at CoX in terms of points. I wouldn't mind a system like RS3's death system where you have to pay GP to get your items back equal to a percent of the value of what you had on you. It'd introduce risk back into regular PvM, but not make it intimidating to approach.
---
Did you have a stroke writing that? Losing your stuff on death is bad design. Risk is one thing, but losing 30+ hours of progress because of a fucking lag spike is ridiculous. I cannot understand why people want that. If the servers were perfect and every death was on the players then maybe there would be an argument there, but given how shitty the servers and how bad Jagex is with fixing their fuck ups, you couldn't introduce archaic design like that.

I have 0 desire to have a bunch of cool gear I can't ever use because bosses are designed with 1 shot kill mechanics if I don't take 2 steps to the side and switch my prayer.

I didnt miss the point. You used to enjoy playing in a self sustaining style, and now that there are other methods of accomplishing the same tasks you dont like it anymore. You might not want to admit it to yourself, but its because you want your way to be the best way. Make an ironman, or just play it how you like it. I for one absolutely hate all of the gathering skills as they are completely brainless to me, id much rather make money then buy the shit i need from the ge. The huge playerbase explosion at ge release suggests im not the only one. Write it off as snarky or self reflect and just have fun with the game, your choice

where?? it's not on the minimap! I spent like 3 minutes running around West Ardy just to make sure I didn't look stupid on the internet and I couldn't find it!

that's not true. Fury is just better all around. it's an extra 2 strength and 5 (?) accuracy.

Who watches the watchmen...?

While that is a point, me and many others would like to kill mossy for a bryo staff or hilly for a club. Maybe if they added a fire giant boss it'd be fine.
---
right but then you have to buy the sword and the necklace.
---
To add to this, when they added beginner clues, they didn't want to decrease the drop rate of other clues and didn't want to increase the rate of nests, so they don't give a nest.
---
He's just poking fun at ya for not following the norm of "SLAYERscape"
---
But yeah seriously, train strength before the other combat stats. The faster you get a higher max hit, the faster you level up all combat stats. And the stat that raises max hit is strength. Then you train attack because accuracy also raises DPS, but not as much per level as strength. Then last you level defence since it doesn't increase DPS at all in NMZ

So, on November 5th someone sold like 337k eggs which crashed the market, but after that it went back up. It could be that the new boss is increasing prices before release.

How should i train 70-99 Fletching and Crafting, have about 25m in bank but I can do Vorkath for money to cover costs, looking to finish all my buyable skills and not sure how i should train these 2 skills
---
How come this community is so funny and self deprecating lol? Classic wow is the literal polar opposite. The contrast between /r/classicwow and /r/2007scape is insane.
---
Both subs are dense with autism, but the wow sub is like that 14 year old kid who says he fucked your mom in MW2 when you can clearly see it's some kid in his profile pic.
---
I gotta live up to the name.  But on a serious note this forum is negative af thats why im mad, tired of it.

Is joke

This would make farming med clue scrolls without a multi cannon really good

go to house party world?

Nice bro Gratz

If anyone cares:

Fang 1: 64 KC

Fang 2: 101 KC

I mean Zulrah killed the prices of everything it dropped (and was nerfed 5 times and is still some of the best money in the game), Zalcano single handedly dropped fury price by 1m (and crashed ores and chaos runes), and Vorkath just keeps getting easier. This meme isn't very true to itself as everything is botted it just happens to be that bh is easier to make an account for than Zulrah. Even still bh crates were op and the changes made mid beta weren't polled and were the part that made bh op for money.
---
You see bh was balanced around real people pking and taking 2+ minutes per fight, and dying and losing their streak occasionally, and then banking and regearing. Bots never die and lose their streak, take 20 seconds to kill each other for points and get constant targets their level, and they don't even need any gear to get the points. If you balanced around bots it would be like 10k/hr profit for actual pkers who only get 5-10 kills per hour.
---
I felt this in my lung.
---
L0000000l i cant believe you think the entirety of pvp in osrs is a noob pker chasing a wimdy pvmers. Tf out here with that bullshit. You talk about pvp meta, cat and mouse etc but have you ever actually tried that content??
---
Imagine grinding that out as an ironman, the horror.
---
And this kind of gets to the heart of the issue. Should changed be made with past people's achievements in mid every time, or does this mindset stifle good change for the game without even giving it a chance?
---
Bet he cant use the long range attack style on a bow.
---
I have one in Chaos Temple, it's open 24/7....  
---
Just let me know when you're coming and what world.
---
Anything dropped in public places is up for grabs. Usually people are dropping it on purpose to either just give away some of their wealth or more likely at the GE they are having fun watching people run from drop to drop as they become visible.

Why did you comment nine asterisks?
---
Accuracy is the same, but it also gives more prayer.
---
I blow my load if I get two superiors in one task, let alone two imbued hearts. Gz.
---
No they don't give a shit. You only hear about people that get banned - not the hundreds of people that transfer between alts and mains, friends all day.
---
What are u gonna do?  
---
Sell them both and buy a DWH?
---
*Amulet* of fury
---
Thanks for everything. Hope everything is going well for you.
---
No shit
---
there is really no use trying to get people to understand content they have never tried
---
Technically? Yeah, it's a player run game of chance.
---
Realistically? It's a clan. Just run the event over discord or something, the only way anyone's going to get muted is if one of your clan mates reports so if you don't trust your clan mates that much then it'd be just as easy to keep anything related to it just over discord so that way there's nothing to actually report.
---
He should hack them and give them an unappealable ban

Get off this toxic reddit is my honest advice. You will be able to make your own decisions on everything. Not influenced by people crying about things they don't like about the game

The game does great. That doesn't mean they pay the employees well.

fucking panzy i bet you fucking just took that photo you fucking liar

people stopped playing rs3.

woah woah i dont lie you fucker &lt;3

bind/tb

notice how both have their unique points, offering alternatives forcing the player to choose one.
---
 The one on the left looks like he broke all four legs and each one is in a cast lol.
---
That might be, I dont know every meme on the internet and Im new on reddit :D It just shows how weird the community sometimes is. You guys dont realize that there is life outside of the game.
---
I wonder how many lobsters he got tho

This is the content I have been waiting for. New falador castle boss confirmed.

Maybe if he gets lucky he gets the coveted 1k gp drop.

You're almost as nooby as Tinky Turnip

I have a Venezuelan friend whom I met alching whatever people leave behind bursting nechs in catas. We can't really speak to each other, but I give her money sometimes because I know it helps.

Well written comments that understand how a balanced economy affects player interaction is rare.
---
you're fine, i have 3 accounts (rune dragon alts) each have inferno.  one account i did die due to lag and got on my 2nd attempt, the other 2 i got on the first (my last alt i actually beat my mains pb which was upsetting since i have 37 completions on my main and it was a 4 minute time difference).
---
Berserker necklace literally gives negative stats lmao.
---
Feel bad for him but hey, if hes ever wielding obsidian weapons/wearing obby gear...
---
Watch (spellsey OSRS)video on YouTube about nmz. The dude above talking about fully obby is correct. It costs a few mill but so worth it if you want to afk. I went from 75 att and def to 85 In seriously 2 days by afking nmz. Even got mage from 76-83 in 2 days which only got 40k exp an hour compared to melee at 60k plus 20k hp.
---
I feel targeted here
---
As someone who works in IT as a User Access Administrator, I have to say that it is appalling that they hadn't changed them. It's not hard to change a social media password. Or any password, really. And if its changed, distribute it to those in need. It's not hard. In my industry, we get fined heavily for breaches of security like this.

When you buy bonds, you‚Äôre lining the pockets of Chinese shareholders who will eventually push MTX into the game

That's how I got 99 firemaking 10 years ago

That's my entire point? You may be able to replace everything else in RS with a bot, but a decent PKer will win every time.
---
It really is. Can you imagine what a nightmare access administration would be without AD or an equivalent?

this bs is why i use the private room

You can thank the GE for making raw materials more valuable than finished goods

Stinks

You posted this on a public forum except criticism. It is laughable when the triggered child lashes out after being challenged in the tiniest ways.
---
There is no 'right' way to get the set, and I never said you were wrong for picking the 3hr+ grind over the 1hr grind.
---
Might I suggest a therapist instead of lashing out online to help work out those issues you seem to be projecting all over me.
---
&gt;But I'd love to be enlightened.
---
I'm mostly speaking for myself.
---
&gt;Also a point of critique, I personally find your writing style to be over-engineered for the forum. This is reddit, not an academic paper. I think you might find it beneficial to discussion to take into account your audience and use plainer language.
---
Also what the fuck is this shit? Is this a trap? There's no way i respond to this without someone rolling their eyes but fuck it. Here i go:
---
The language is simple, and directly relatable to anyone who has played enough RS and thought about how they've played RS. That's because I'm talking and making points for myself and to relate to people who understand where I'm coming from (Hint hint, the interconnected world wide web is about mememe these days). It's not rhetoric meant to win people over, it's venting. If i wanted karma I'd check the state of things and play my response to whatever the current go is for the sub.
---
Why try to bring "the audience" down to knuckle dragger levels to make such a stupid point?
---
thanks :)
---
You‚Äôre a fucking mad man.
---
I'd like it if it was broken up a bit clues, boss log and skilling drops all being seperated.
---
Hey add me up, my ign is Swampletics
---
Right click on and only use single spells
---
haha hello w73 player ;)
---
so is that a yes or no
---
You don't even know the difference between except and accept. Why would I care what some illiterate ass hat thinks?
---
Actually not a bad idea. Would probably at least remove some bots from the huge bot farms around the wilderness. Having to risk 100k on 50 accounts which can easily be killed by other players would at a minimum make it rewarding for people to actually hunt them down - and punish botters a bit.
---
the problem went away when the demand for the game went away.  they didnt really solve anything.  All i know is that when the ddos attacks were happening i lost over 300m in gear due to dc's, boss mechanics are now designed around the current death mechanics, it cant be changed.
---
Fak u
---
I‚Äôm similar stats to you. My most consistent money makers are green dragons, looting pvp worlds, medium clue farming (killing falador guards for the clues), wintertodt. I‚Äôd also say that doing general slayer tasks, or other skipping often makes a bit of money, but what I listed above is consistently 300-500k an hour depending on luck, sometimes more

Have any tips for a newer bandos gwd boi? I usually dps and I haven't tried using guthans as well but I can imagine the utility saved.
---
Oh fuck, I've been dumping a lot of my mind rune stack to pay off the guy at the Ourania altar. Whoopsie poopsie.
---
I don't think any content necessitates the absolute BIS gear.
---
And I think you are being a bit narrow minded. It's just the last few years without death mechanic that the game has been purely about getting bis gear, in the older days PvM and skilling communities were larger aswell and the economy was more varied so people did more different things.
---
The death mechanics remove player agency and choice. When the game just gives you one ideal way of playing without risk you aren't really choosing anything yourself. The best methods should require skill to be viable, and that necessitates risk.
---
The bis moneymakers in skilling have more risk (though not much either) while giving less rewards even.
---
In total I think people have just gotten used to a way of playing where we get handed everything, but we used to enjoy the game in the old days as well. 
---
People have always been walking around with that much gear, even in old days. It's just that we had less coins. D chain back in the day was insanely expensive. It was not uncommon to use only 3 very valuable items, which again adds choice, strategy, player agency.
---
Current PvM beats all other playstyles, it has next to no variation and absolutely no risk, has good xp rates and even the afk content is good money. It has rendered most of the game useless, which is why people feel like getting gear is the only point and will vote against any fix.
---
Ass burgers

Yea how do you not link this??
---
1000 chompys for elite diary. Even at like 40 Hunter exp each, (seems reasonable to me, can't remember exact reqs for hunting them), that's 40k Hunter exp I reckon that'd be pretty sick bc as it stands it's a pretty big task with very little gain in the process, ignoring the diary rewards.
---
When the league ends the rewards will be discontinued fpr a while, they will be reobtainable later when they launch the next league. So you can get both Kourend rewards and whatever the next one will be
---
This is an mmo that's played by an average age of 23-25. Most people don't have more than 2 hours a day to play. They slowly removed the need for the least "fun" parts of the game like mining essence.
---
Sounds like g@y
---
I agree, but is it 25x easier? One zulrah bit brings in what 25 magic logs or shark bots do. I doubt it.
---
Also again, a lot of combat has like no requirements and is a lot better money that the skills. I'd say more bots camp random monsters than camp skills.
---
This whole "skilling can't get updates because of bots" kinda seems like wishful thinking from PvMers who know their playstyle is hurting the playstyle other people enjoy atleast. Though - the PvMers are the majority so don't take this as me saying they are ruining the game. I just happen to like other things than them to some degree.
---
You can buy rune pouch for 1.5m at any slayer master. Looting bag is like 30k.
---
&gt;e hell of 99 con and it took me 2 months of doing 20 mins per day roughly because the stupid skill just completely screws up your wrists with the 
---
I generally disagree with making skills easier. If the problem is wrist pain, and a lot of people would be okay with other, slower and less click-intensive methods of training construction, why not just train construction the regular way but at a slower pace? No one is forcing you to tick-perfect the methods. This would result in e.g 200k xp/hour instead of 490-500k xp/hour doing oak dungeon doors - still a fast xp gain - without hurting your wrist.
---
Am I the only one who thinks if an HCIM dies it's only their own fault whatever the situation might be?
---
Can you update existing bosses with unclear animations to make them more clear? E.g. cerb and sire have several similar-looking animations and it's hard to understand what's going on purely from visuals. Additionally, there are *many* cases of 1-square visuals that affect 3x3 grids, which is very unclear. E.g. olm falling crystals, cerb lava pools, sire poison pools... can those be adjusted to clearly communicate the area they affect?
---
I believe you mean expect and except, which my phone auto corrected, but okay haha.
---
Considering the hunter level you need for elite, this is the equivalent of 20 mins work..
---
Most of the "enjoyment" back the  is nostalgia. Truth is mining is garbage, most dont find it fun. We get cool pvm updates because they are more enjoyable than mining iron for 14 hours. No way i would have stuck with the game this long if my endgame was kbd in wellfare gear or mining rune ore and worldhopping. Additionally, skilling is heavily susceptible to botting so it wouldn't have been viable anyways
---
thanks!
---
So basically you're saying it's a shit money making method nowadays, even for bots.
---
appreciate it!
---
I think this should only work when already attacked by a pker. This way, pkers can still skulltrick people by having an account wearing the ring of stone. Then when you have been attacked by a pker, you will get a warning message when trying to attack someone else than the pker, that attacked you.
---
Definately a good idea though.
---
It‚Äôs likely that this happens with the same feature on Android products as well. Also, Apple has by far the best mobile device on the planet right now in the 11ProMax
---
yeah, i'll try to take it slow and learn the game at my own pace. Everything is really confusing at the start, but i'll get through it.
---
Because you'll train slayer efficiently regardless. By doing so you earn money, so a byproduct of training slayer is making hella stacks. Effectively it being 0 time spent. But ye I feel u, most ppl dont play this way. Also I guess most 'efficient' slayer tasks arent that great money either way.
---
Ah okay thank you I didnt know that. I really want to get on my old account for nostalgia reasons. Good to know if I ever get it back.
---
I've never really understood how other ironmen have big cash stacks: on mine, I've only seen a green stack once. Looking back, a large part of the reason for that is that I've always spent money immediately on skills, POH upgrade (that was a big one), bolt racks, and death runes for barraging slayer. If you take a slightly more laid back approach, it's easy to stack up money without "farming" actively (= you get the money "zero time" while actively grinding for other goals). 
---
That being said, now that I'm finally done with my house, the zulrah grind, and 95 slayer, I really can't see my cash stack going down quickly, outside of moments where I decide to get a buyable 99. Just my first Hydra task brought me up from 2M to 8M in raw cash. Zero time.
---
Y‚Äôall why is the Varrock guards like level 21 who tf were they kidding how the hell they gonna protect the damn city
---
Also definitely 2nd one I‚Äôm terrified of the first
---
Correct
---
In the wilderness. That's great if you get pked at Venenatis like me yesterday and you get it back on your first kill. It sucks if you use it to suicide at corp/cerb/kbd/whatever and have to get it back every single time.
---
Basic gathering tasks that have little to no reqs, yes. I also think it isnt a bad thing.
---
Saw that coming a mile away when he tried puncturing his hole with the can tilted down
---
Rock cake was to bring his hp back down when it healed.
---
He's not scamming though, he's fighting fair by not getting caught up in the scam. Guy turns off melee and on magic? He's (KempQ) got runes with him too so he can fight back, that's not scamming.
---
I'm assuming most of the people that voted hadn't played the beta and didn't realize this would be the effect.
---
You might want to switch to long attack range and tag healers. This way you not stepping into Jad's melee range. Other than that you are doing everything good. Just concentrate on prayer and don't panic.
---
Again, the issue is that smithing is still a loss of money.
---
The thing you don't seem to understand is you need a larger starting capital with smithing than you need with Fletching. Why? Because you're losing money.
---
If you try getting to 99 Smithing with only 10m gp, you'll often find yourself spending a lot of time running from the GE and back or waiting for your addy plates to sell.
---
With a skill like Cooking or Fletching, the method of training in itself is profitable. If you start fletching with only 1m, your cash stack will gradually increase on your road to 99.
---
Also, most people don't enjoy post 99 skilling. Source: most people with 99 in most noncombats also have less than 14m exp. Once you hit 99, the skill loses that sense of progression it had before and making your own goals out of the skill feels artificial... Source: I have 15m Smithing exp.
---
No.
---
The same way no one asked for your comment :)
---
The username does transfer over though...So that could be worth it to some people.
---
To be fair, the "little to no reqs" is the level to gather whatever it is. Shouldn't the skill to gather something be somewhat close to the best method to gather it? Even at 99 mining you're better off with pvm.
---
Hi I Cum
---
You can use Runelite and select the option to hold shift for drop.
---
What clothes are they?
---
Could there be 'Contracts' for more (if not almost all) skills added to the game?:
---
The contracts Idea for farming and Combat (that‚Äôs essentially what slayer is) are great concepts that could be taken into pretty much most other skills, and they would provide a feeling of purpose to many skills within the game, rather than 'Grind to 99'.
---
Random Contracts could be put into the game, with 'reasons for doing them', as well as make player interact with NPC's that they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily have much other interaction with.
---
Examples:
---
Thieving
---
Contract: 'NPC X' has asked the 'Thieves Guild' to steal 'Item Y' from various NPCs.
---
Explanation: The contract would be to steal from 1-8 NPC's scattered around the map, with extra bonuses for time, or not getting caught etc.
---
Reward: Small cash reward for completing the contract (maybe increased with ring of charos), and XP for contract completion.
---
Why add this: This would take away from the boredom (sorry) of either (1) Stealing from ardy knights and master farmers for 30 hrs straight (2) looting the same 3 rooms from pyramid plunder for 30 hours straight.
---
Smithing
---
Contract: 'Horvik Armour Store' in Varrock has put in an order for 500 Adamant plate bodies and 250 Mithril plate bodies.
---
Explanation: Make required amount of Smithing item (you have to make them and can't just buy them, maybe even need to make the bars?) and deliver them to required NPC.
---
Reward: XP and cash in the amount of the 'Alch Price' of the items delivered.
---
Why add this: Again, this creates variety and a feeling of purpose for the skill.
---
(other contract reasons for this skill could be enemy NPC's requesting weapons or armour for their battles, for example; god-wars bosses, goblins, etc...)
---
Ya this isnt one of those friends we have known each other for 23 years. He just didnt secure his account.
---
Ever tried this with Mobile?? Google passwords are impossible to type out lol.
---
Would cuddle with 10/10.
---
All I know is chat will full of whining message due to non-stop dog bombarding
---
I chuckled too much at this comment ü§£
---
your forgetting item collectors, they buy weird shit like this all the time,
---
Rs3 does deaths office now. When you die you spawn there and buy your items back for a % of their value.
---
If a whip is already better dps, it doesn't depend on the weapon. Unless you want to compare dharok to an iron dagger?
---
I dont even think he knows what dice bots are. Tbh neither do i. We are on the if it sounds too good to be true its a scam.
---
Ya ive know him since i was like 4 so.
---
1) What are "Google passwords"?
---
2) You can copy your password from the password manager app to your clipboard and paste them into your password field on mobile. No need to type anything out. Most apps even let you unlock them with biometrics.
---
Boy i sure am excited to click twice as many times to get my easy clues.!!!
---
Inspect element on browser let you swap out pictures and text (only on your screen obviously)
---
On PC if you slam the number corresponding to the travel to island button (can't remember exact number) then this will get you to the island before the crab hits you.
---
 However, I see your point with mobile, it's not ideal at the moment.
---
I'm okay with most of the items in the game being "dead" content.
---
What is more important to me is that the items that are used cover a wide variety of uses and fill interesting niches.
---
An example of when I thought a balance change would be beneficial to prevent items from becoming "dead" content is the gmaul nerf that was dominating PvP. Before almost every build at every level benefited more from a gmaul than any other spec weapon.
---
1.Google passwords, googles password manager. Combos of letters numbers and special keys etc.
---
2. You can't paste into old school RuneScape mobile app, just tried.
---
Now combine them, and it's a whole new type of cancer
---
Would require so much planning lol. Would be brutal.
---
See our accounts are so old we login in with a username. So im guessing some hacker has his username. If he would had a authenticator just on the rs account he would have been good. I myself have a authenticator on rs and a authenticator on my email. Highly recommend it.
---
Yes
---
Firstly, you need to know what account you want to make e.g. pure, zerker, main ect
---
If you plan to max or pvm that limets your choices
---
Also what do you want out of it? GP? The pures aren't your best bet
---
Take part in LSM it's safe and you can practice 1ticking ect
---
Famous in certain circles. My mum knows me well, for instance.
---
Jokes aside, if they paid me I would look into pros and cons of different password managers much more thoroughly than I have. Presently I don't feel comfortable recommending any specific implementation as I don't know how they compare. All I know is Dashlane works just fine for my requirements, but I'm sure others would too.
---
On the next post you have to edit in at least a salad hat.
---
By complaining on a FREE service. That‚Äôs why you are a miserable person.
---
Stuff you you made me laugh in a library now every damn person is looking at me
---
I'm 86 slayer, 80 crafting. I have 10m in cash. And already have 35k chaos runes, which is more than enough for one onyx.
---
You mentioned bonds, which is just jagex-sanctioned RWT. They never really banned gold buyers so I don't see how it's changed.
---
Though you're right about the meta shift affecting iron men too, I overlooked that.
---
I don't enjoy the feeling of wrist pain. Please stop trying to remove the features that make this game comfortable to play without affecting XP rates or the game experience of other players.
---
Didn't mention buying gp because it's against the rules. It's not a sensible discussion if we just throw out the rule book.
---
Zammy hasta on pound is good too
---
Or rabies :)
---
Killing blue drags for dbones is so shit tho wait for Lance at least and make sure to see how much xp you'll get from vork and Hydra.
---
What's the worst quest and why is it Ratcatcher? Discuss.
---
If i were to make a pure, what stats should i be going for? 75atk 99 str 99 range 99 magic?
---
It's a new gamemode starting this thursday. [Here's the announcement blog on it.](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/old-school-runescape-twisted-league?oldschool=1)
---
No the most efficient way is finishing zulrah and doing extra for scales...
---
Aim for 50 att 70 str 70 range 94 magic first. Try low level. If you don‚Äôt want that high magic just get 50 att 70 str 70 range and go bh. There‚Äôs so many builds and you can go from one build to another. After you get used to it you can eventually max with the stats you said
---
Yes.
---
Well I'm thinking pure since it's low risk, and I'm really only looking for the fun aspect of pvping.   
---
LMS isn't a bad idea to pratice while training my new account
---
Crudel&gt;SGS&gt;Hasta&gt;Bludgeon
---
Money.
---
What is this? A crossover episode
---
Maybe in the very last of days. Maybe.
---
Why do I like this?
---
SGS is worst than hasta with bludgeon being the best for cerb
---
And? There was a significant time cost in training slayer the way you have.
---
And Ironman isn‚Äôt like a main where money is 0 time because of alts, at least as far as I‚Äôm aware. Hence why I was asking.
---
F2P is shit just pay the $11
---
I didn't know that was a thing until nearly 30 mins of doing that quest üòÖ
---
Enough....
---
Yeah was referring to mains since I couldn't think of an example for ironmen
---
sirpugger made a vid about it, pkers are also aware of the gold problem
---
Hence my point. I don‚Äôt think money is 0 time on an Ironman.
---
/r/RuneScapeGoneWild
---
Very first mod, 10 seconds after they enabled it: nude mod. I guarantee it.
---
Doesn't make it efficient or anywhere close to.
---
And 3 more seconds after that, a furry nude mod (the tails take more time to animate).
---
Nature runes have alch value. Simple as that - if natures are low enough the bots will sell those too. But yeah infinite amounts of people can alch but only so many can sell to stores I understand that.
---
Clearly this man is drunk
---
people used to do this 1-click method a lot when oshd was out, last guide about this was made like what, 2009 or something? 
---
glad someone made it relevant again
---
Profit?
---
100% agree, some plug ins were op.  But the ones that make sense and SHOULD already be in game are being taken away because nerds.
---
there is no methods in f2p that will compare to decent p2p methods just buy a bond. it's not hard to make doing herb runs after u get ur first one

What a chad

1 karma doesn't mean that no one upvoted it

You're puting words into my mouth though. I never said that.

Yupp. Bots would not be a big deal anymore

Very very nice. Rngesus with ya today

Wtf... Get your spec bar to 69, you casual!

DPS calculators tho

Devious on suicide watch

This is perfect IMO

However i do think Lucky Implings seeds should exist but be very  very  rare and untradable.
---
&gt; Jagex seperated the monster from the context of the warning by putting it in the Kourend dungeon. 
---
Y'know what? I agree with this. Nieve's cave was bad, and we complained and got it fixed... and meanwhile the catacombs is a thing.
---
It takes significantly less effort than doing any other skill. Not sure what your point is. Click intensive doesn't = huge effort.
---
Explain how it will make it a stable price for me, that‚Äôs the part I really struggle to understand

r/2007scape is bringing out some good shit recently. These memes coupled with constant drama gives a lot to enjoy.

I've already recognized my mistakes from yesterday frustration in the cc, made peace, and talked trought and everyone was supportive to redirect common paid requests from campers to this marketplace cc instead, just like they already do in wyvernscc/ge bulks. I want a urgent service going on for Gp and not toxicity.
---
Well, sometimes you can get scammed. 
---
If you're a really nice person and someone takes advantage of that, it's cruel but there's lessons to be learnt. Now I'm warry and only allow my closest (IRL) friends to borrow things from me. It's just a game after all, I didn't really expect someone would do such a thing. 
---
Lessons teach you great things! Very helpful for real life as well. Same concept but it's with real money instead.
---
Imagine publicly saying this
---
I would gladly just put donation money to kickstart it and not be in charge of it.
---
Well ill explain shortly. I was doing cerb all night same room, same world.... anyway he just walks in take the kill and say "i left suicide supply here". That was def a lie cause, i was in there for a good 5+ kill just that trip. The funny thing was the guy dying while crashing me, then making a real "suicide piles".  But what made it worst, he came back and DIED AGAIN.
---
i like the idea if its like the plant ate/captured an impling and then u harvest the reward.
---
I don't think skillers need to get anything out of this, they already have the normal method of catching Implings, this is a more drop-oriented method of catching them.
---
Suiciding twice is pretty common, gives you enough to do the whole task in 1 trip
---
Your sheet is cool and decently useful but let's not pretend this is some arcane knowledge. It's highschool stats at best or 1 Kahan academy lesson at worst... Thanks for the effort the cunt like behavior isn't helping you.
---
Both work full time in IT, mined all the sand and farmed all the seaweed
---
These are the same people who had a complex AHK script for every skilling action in the game before it was banned. But they want basic QoL plug ins for the masses banned.
---
You will need another parchment
---
I'm at 154 no uniques.
---
I keep my rs passwords in keepass which does support "autotyping" of login fields - even to Runelite. On mobile, linking Google account to login works well if you only have one account :)
---
Was exactly my goal! Walked next to the Ardougne bush patch that i never touch(because who the hell farm bushes) while heading to the Fairy ring to get to Puro Puro and realized how cool it will be if you could "grow" implings in these "dead" patches.
---
I was feeling like that. I do have things to do tho, but I can‚Äôt really find the motivation. For some reason grinding lavas at a 45k xp/hr rate was more appealing to me (I was grinding elite diaries). I started to feel like my irl responsabilities and activities were fading away. Talking to hans in game Made me realize I spent 53 days in a a little less than 1,5 years, it sounded like a lot. I know I‚Äôll be back, but rn is not the moment.
---
An older suggestion was for Venus Impling Traps that acted like farmable birdhouses with random rolls on drop tables.
---
I think farming is very packed compared to other skills; hunter alone could work, just slap a birdhouse 2.0 in special spots.
---
He already did NMZ grind with 93 defense, 99 attack, strength, and HP now
---
You're exaggerating a ton here let's be real. Can you name three plugins you will miss from base runelite that weren't actually a bit too much? The ham pick pocket is fair imo, but the pvm plugins were fair game for removal. The only arguably qol pvm plugin was the Cerberus one for colour blind people, but that's something that can be worked around if you configure your display settings correctly or learn to just look at the ghosts. The ghosts have already had their models changed once and everyone was happy with it, people just got a bit too comfy with runelite I guess.
---
5% pleasure.
---
To be honest that Design looks really cool
---
Yes that is common, but it was not the case in this situation. The guy didnt get 1 flick right in every kill i was there lol
---
Colorblind to reds and greens when they‚Äôre next to each other... thanks Jamflex maybe have a random test where we can prove we are color blind in the settings to turn this back on?
---
Neat find.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zalcano
---
also your poop furnace makes logs
---
No. We don‚Äôt need new skills. Especially not that one.
---
Your comment does not make any sense, I said to revote all pvp updates would be absurd, then I went and stated to be more clear and less vague. You would not want all past pvm updates to be revoted on, its unnecessary.
---
Bots =/= people.
---
people who cheat are a demographic and magically excluding them would see a loss.
---
OK so in the... -
---
1st Clip - guy doesn't get directly hit? - barrage clump - 1 time opponent attack - does a few hits - skulls "randomly" (Notice how the guy skulls right after the opponent turns around to target him, doesn't attack, and then guy skulls, hmm..)
---
2nd Clip - can't tell what happened, but barrage wasn't involved (although the opponents friend did whip hit him right before the opponent hit back)
---
3rd Clip - a youtube comment says at [0:56](https://youtu.be/kKyXEwf-QiE?t=56) enemy stands beside you but does not attack you (busy attacking player under you) mage from afar (mage1) focus targets their barrage on their friendly teammate (close1) but this spell also aoe's your main character (cw6) while you continue to auto attack mage1, he now barrages his second friendly teammate (close2) as this player (close2) attacks you (cw6) while you continue to attack (mage1) this tells the game somehow you have auto retaliated to one of the players attacking you (clear glitch and not intentional)
---
4th Clip - not sure, opponent splashes barrage, in multi, on his teammate seconds before our guy skulls
---
Looks like barrage was involved in 3/4 of the clips. Not sure now what to make of clip 2.
---
Removal of the Cerberus plugin
---
Removal of the reorder prayers plugin
---
Remove "opponent's opponent" part of the opponent info overlay
---
Remove the pickpocket/talk-to swap from the menu entry swapper
---
Remove the minimap overlay from the barrows plugin
---
Remove the Walk here/Attack swap on the Corporeal beast dark core
---
Remove the demonic gorilla plugin
---
Actually pretty funny that you have an equal amount of claws and skins.
---
Tbow and cannon I assume?
---
You‚Äôre making the bonds useful though, if nobody bought them for GP, nobody would buy bonds in the first place.
---
So yes, you‚Äôre indirectly supporting Jagex even more by paying your membership in bonds.
---
True, but making f2p, standard spellbook bind spells essentially as effective as Ice Barrage had nothing to do with balancing.  It failed a poll, and they forced it in anyway to pander to the pvpers.
---
&gt; clearly being recovered and used on a different ip
---
Ahhh the old "I can use a VPN and claim I was hacked" trick.
---
To pvm the mass amount of skills is a lot harder since you can‚Äôt just ge items or skills up.  You have to grind items/levels the old fashion way before pvm kills Ironman
---
Coding is gonna be a lot harder than it might seem on the surface, compounded by the fact that we have no idea what kind of italian dishes jagex is working with behind the scenes.
---
Balancing is always an issue, even when it seems obvious. People also find ways to exploit mechanics that the developer/playtesters never dream of. 
---
In this case we have some precedent re: summoning. Can't say what it was like from the coding side, but in terms of balancing it kinda changed every meta in the game (granted, they weren't really trying to avoid that)
---
What i had in mind is that Implings like to eat the plant haha
---
Yes.  Why is anything you said confusing to you? You can use mechanics within the game.  You cannot use outside software to gain advantages.
---
Isn't that what machine learning bots do though?
---
Kills before the collection log was released
---
This is a sick idea, support.
---
Even better with that comment
---
Crazy really how much is being sent across. And how much potential they could have for growth!
---
noone is saying it needs to be that strong. My point is just that it should do _something_ at least mildly useful, which it won't do if pouch degradation is removed
---
Nice one xD
---
I don't see any logs on that drop table. What am I missing?
---
I don‚Äôt even think you read past ep
---
It got worse the more I looked
---
Mate I never said I had a problem supporting jagex... where did that come from? Theres literally no point in paying $11 for my account with almost 2B on the account
---
Iron is a bit worse since there‚Äôs no Varrock diary armor.
---
Osrs podcasts on youtube
---
Why doesn't Krystillia assign hill giants and moss giants as a wildy slayer task?
---
Would be faster to kill gargs and buy chaos runes lol.
---
No more patches. Please Jagex, please stop adding farm patches.
---
Guess!
---
-Cody?
---
Yeah dude!
---
Lmao. How do people fall for this? Come on...
---
Runelite with the 2010 UI skin
---
You're correct, 200m magic xp is 0 time / 0 ehp, even on an Ironman, btw.
---
Literally take 5hours of efficent questing and wines
---
Check out "Mercy CC" We do a bit of everything and have people active at all sorts of hours due to geographical location
---
Back when everyone's desk had 500 slice marks in them from when your bored woodcutting
---
Iron men
---
You could buy flax at the ge for 1-3 coins each. Spin them into bowstring and sell them back. You'll get crafting xp and they sell for a profit of over 100 coin each.
---
Congrats on 99 construction !!
---
Noob moment tho, what tracker did you use? It looks pretty! If it's runelite I think I need to do something because mine isn't working :(
---
Does the 4x hp regen from the endless endurance relic stack with the prayer hp regen and regen bracelet for a total of x16 hp regen?
---
Go kill hill giants for some bones and herbs
---
Is it really that bad tho? I know kids with "ass" and stuff like that in their name but my reference is so  offensive they force the name change. My name is still a reference to fecal porn and now it has jagex in it so let's see how long this last.
---
Ironman here, I'll still be using puro puro
---
I hope this is successful, good luck man :)
---
Not a fan of the piss cube. 
---
Os engine doesn't support particle effects.
---
I hate this game.
---
Lol goodluck with that
---
Splash
---
I was saying that they punish accounts that distribute gold, not the recipient.
---
all good man lmfao, i act like an ass too sometimes, it's just fun haha
---
Still dunno why i'm getting downvoted though. I said nothing but good things
---
Dragon slayer can be done with adamant, but it isnt easy. I would at least use a rune weapon if you're going melee.
---
Where you from bro! Its snowing in my town rn(not bad tho)
---
Segregate the membership models, then? Maybe it's time they do that anyway.
---
Yeah, puro puro still sounds more efficient
---
Wasn't the accusation made against the Jagex management and not their moderators?
---
I'm still pissed they blacked out the Barrows minimap.
---
‚ÄúElysium cc‚Äù just join that, then google it, apply and boom you‚Äôll be grinding my friend
---
advice: do not fear the giant mole
---
Aight thanks 8)
---
Dw, camelpiss was fine for 3 years, meanwhile goatpiss (a friend had that name) got banned after less than a month. About half a year later camel piss was also banned. It makes no sense lol
---
Nop, their service doesn't fit my category. I'm already getting lot of interest by just offering 300k to randoms in the g.e. Can have many ppl added interested and I can ask them one on one when I need the run to whoever is online.
---
Seems best solution posible for me tbh
---
Did you perhaps miss all of the outrage about the OP plugins on reddit?
---
Because implings like lucky are rare to come by, no matter how tradable they are. Adding a new way to obtain them will decrease their value by a shit ton. You actually have to search for these implings, adding these seeds would completely remove the need for ANYONE to search for it, removing another aspect of Skilling itself and just adding it to an npc drop table.
---
Does it?
---
Boy... .Did you just use "whataboutism" while also making up the comparing point?
---
Oh hey basically rs3
---
Who hurt you?
---
I gotcha, good luck sorry I couldn‚Äôt help
---
I‚Äôm glad you caught that hahaha
---
Sounds like the same thing here. A name that's borderline offensive and jagex bans it because better safe than sorry I guess. I mean they allow curse words nowadays so I thought jagex wasnt that thin skinned anymore.
---
You make a good point but it's not savory for the yung rs hopefuls.
---
I too read the original post comments
---
I did the same thing lmao. Tell him just buy chaos tune packs from Baba Yaga it will be like 3-4m gp but it‚Äôs worth it
---
You were downvoted because your post was factually inaccurate and you were smug.
---
Yeah I always found the eternal weird. Choosing between spending less than 100gp to make a ring with 8 charges and spending &gt;6m for a ring with unlimited charges is *kinda* a no brainer. It would only take 480k teleports to break even lmao
---
I know this post a meme and all, but still, I don't understand why this mode wasn't released before. Some say that it's too niche and would be dead, but I'm not so sure about that.  We haven't had a new game mode in 3 years.  There's always a lot of hype for new modes.  People are looking for new ways to play the game.  Streamers have new content to show.  HCUIM would have been perfect as it's a whole new way to play the game (uim without suiciding) and the development time needed for it is surely pretty minimal.  Now that they are focusing on group IM, it's most likely too late for HCUIM.
---
split please pl0x I tb'd
---
Youre not spending time to get money, you just get money passively when training slayer etc.
---
@ OP let us know!
---
Man i had the same experience but it took me 6 hours total over 2 days ... rip
---
I think Ben already did this almost exact same question as well?
---
I‚Äôm not responding to you?
---
I would vote yes for a blanket overhaul of drop tables. Too many resource drops make gathering worthless, too many 'finished products' (e.g. armor, pots, etc.) make resource processing worthless.
---
YES! THIS IS THEM! My naive self didn't take a screenshot -- but this is 100% it. Upvote this!
---
I tought you were, mb.
---
Oh look a toxic pker who streams. I'm so shocked
---
I think it would be ok to spam everything underneath Eclectics because they are very easy to catch at Puro Puro anyway, above it though should be hard to spam because the seeds would become much much more rarer to find, i think  getting a dragon seed should be like 1/1000 drop from a high level Npc and untradable. also i think 2 hours growth time is enough.
---
I guess it depends the price of these, but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the vambs with the rag bolting meta
---
Ooo ty
---
It's unfortunate but a lot of these social scams usually involves someone who's high level or near maxed. Would you believe a level 3 account more than someone with 90's across the board?
---
I have 7 with all spirit trees including POH planted. What do I even do with them now?
---
no. it gives 0 hp
---
Lol, this. Lance profit over crossbow is around 200k per hour. IIRC Crossbow also has higher DPS, resulting in faster kills. 
---
Basically the only reason you‚Äôd use lance over crossbow is 99 attack and you‚Äôre farming vorkath for hundreds of hours, and you‚Äôre also raiding. Otherwise 200k an hour extra is not a reason to sell crossbow for lance.
---
no max stack of cannon balls? nty
---
What if
---
Everything wasnt max EHP and you enjoy doing some longer grinds, while others can do what they want
---
**Torilla tavataan**
---
99 strength only training on rats
---
That could would work by making it untradeable! My thought was to make long timers only if they were tradeable.
---
start in f2p and work your way up from there
---
Thats pretty rare, sadly i have more now :(
---
Don't forget about the large numbers within the PVP community who aren't toxic babies... the few assholes who are will whine loud enough to make it seem like they are advocates for all people who are into PVP.

Berserker necklace gives a 20%? damage increase if wearing full obsidian plus it gives so much def that it allows you to afk as well
---
OsBuddy has done it for 6 years to be fair. I played with the official client up until 5 months ago but there‚Äôs some neat plugins like the ground items that‚Äôs kinda made me wish I had switched years ago too. Barrows one was weird for me because it showed a map and I don‚Äôt know if the map itself is bad, but showing the correct PATH is maybe a bit much. Oh well.
---
Must have been a weird kid
---
Keep planting the seeds in the patches that you use least often every few days if you're not 99 Farming yet.
---
The XP from them is super good. If you're 99 Farming then they're pretty much useless unless you're chasing pet or something. I CBA to do tree runs after 99 though.
---
yeah fuck that sunk cost fallacy you did 10k kills and you're closer than ever op go get em tiger
---
I know of people that dig up the ones they use less frequently and replant them for the xp, but that's all I can think of.
---
Jagex is aware and workkng on a fix. For now, try about every 30 minutes. I know it sucks mate but they are aware of it
---
All good. I was just explaining the logic to the other dude. No worries though.
---
HAHAHAHA
---
But league has clear and obvious objectives, so you can understand what major goals are. And combat, while you may not know what all the abilities do, is still much more clear than osrs combat. It‚Äôs complex at a high level, sure, but osrs pvp is difficult to understand at the entry point.
---
Looks like the HP notebook I have actually
---
Is either an Addy long or short sword better dps than mithril scim? I have a f2p uim I'm training right now and there's no way to get an Addy scim.
---
Probably got a legitimate ban that you think is ‚Äòtrivial‚Äô. MMK was one of the best jmods imo.

Awesome my time zone! I'll try to make it I'll be at work tho

Jeez this is just terrible
---
rune?
---
Dear Jagex,
---
There are services like LastPass that store passwords. They even have plans for teams, enterprises, etc. That way you can always change the password without hassle, use complex, unique passwords. Once an employee leaves you simply remove them from the password manager and change the passwords with a click of a button.

yeah, for pvm. go to bounty hunter world wildy and be silent for a second. you can hear the keyboards breaking and the gorilla screams from juiced nerds from miles away.

Well I‚Äôll be damned
---
Yeah, it caps at 64 which drains run twice as fast as 0 weight.
---
Probably a way to common question, but can we get a rough idea for the release of Group Ironman mode?
---
No specifics required, but atleast a heads up to what quarter of next year (assuming the release shall be 2020) is in your minds.
---
True I was too panicked lmao
---
That was the original reason i got it!
---
Its trading for 105m right now btw Mr panic sell.

This would go viral with captions

Lookup oak dungeon doors zero mouse movement on YouTube. Just went from 62 to 83 over the past few days and was getting around 450k even while taking breaks every ten minutes or so

---
This guy thinks he's all and mighty now even look at his premium tier censoring name - not like the rest of us black bar plebs.
---
200m Smithing is the easiest and profitable to get after 98, takes a lot of time though, which is why I don't care about doing it myself.

And good farmers
---
I Mahatma I or fear figment.  I'd say jojo3000 but that's my video so it'd be a bit conceited.
---
It is not just about MVP (cause anyone can get the pet or seeds without getting MVP), but the amount you contribute increases the general loot you get (50 of this resource instead of 30). 4 people is considered optimal because everyone gets pretty solid loot and the kills are fairly regular (3 cycles to kill). With 3 people you would theoretically get more loot per kill, but could have to go 4 cycles for a kill. So 4 people is best. 
---
Though 3 or 5 isnt really that big a deal, but some people complain.

God I have been asking for this for months, I don't know why they pretty much nerfed slayer block lists by adding these. Both are absurdly slow tasks, horrible drops, and insanely high task weights. I really hope jagex finally responds to this.

I read through your comment and am interested into how "clinical" he was initially in his handjobs, if I for whatever reason had to masturbate a male friend or family member of mine I would try to make my technique as uniform and devoid of "personality" as possible. It sounds like your father initially framed his offer as just fulfilling a basic physical need and things escalated gradually over time. Did he vary speed and pressure, focus on different parts of the penis, switch to just stroking your head or testicles etc.? Are you circumcised? Was it purely a "pumping closed hand" thing or would he ever just stroke one finger up and down the shaft and whatnot? I guess I mostly want to know how much "personality" and sensuality he initially put into your handjobs versus a purely clinical "robotic" approach, and how much of his technique involved communication between the both of you beyond the pure physical aspects. Beyond the pure physical sensation of being masturbated was there anything he did initially that was a particular turnon for you? I guess since you were too incapacitated to masturbate yourself this wouldn't have initially been the case but did he ever encourage you to grope him? Was he ever topless or nude during the "handjob stage"? Did any handjobs ever take place in the shower or bathtub? Would he increase the speed and instensity to get you to cum? How hard would you say you came compared to when you normally masturbated? Any vocal encouragement to cum after saying "just relax and let go" the first time? After cumming would he continue to masturbate you for a few seconds? Did he ever comment on your ejaculations in a way meant to turn you on? Did his handjobs start off clinically and gradually get more sensual after a period of weeks before progressing to oral? You said there was no "dirty talk" but that he was clinical in what he was doing in a way that got you off, could you give any examples? How turned on were you by the communication. Did either of you ever laugh just cause of the absurdity of the situation? Did you look at each other at all during this? If you did, did he try to turn you on with his facial expressions? A warm paternal smile meant to get you to relax and release or a dirtier sultry "eyebrow raised" expressions. I can only imagine how your face looked initially the first few times, do you think he was turned on by this? If you did look at each other would he maintain eye contact as you ejaculated and would he smile when you finally came? This is kind of dumb but my own personal fantasy surrounding your situation is me wearing pajama pants or sweats, getting a large and obvious erection and then walking to your grandpa reading on the couch and just kind of motioning at the situation and he puts his book down, smiles and says "ok." Did anything remotely similar to this ever happen? I think it is clear by how this progressed that your grandpa must have had some level of attraction to you, could you initially tell this was the case?
---
Shout out to all the mechanics that play this game
---
How dare you even THINK about putting down that poor abandoned good boy
---
Yeah there‚Äôs the hp goal obviously, but that‚Äôs the end goal. In league you have obvious intermediate goals (towers, kills, dragons, baron) that you can get excited about. Those are obvious even if you know nothing about league. I know nothing about osrs pvp so if I‚Äôm watching, I‚Äôm not gonna really understand what supplies or specs are being used and what they do. There are no intermediate goals to tell you who‚Äôs winning if you don‚Äôt understand the game.
---
This is a possible result of going for RNG goals

You‚Äôll want to use void. Can‚Äôt imagine building up a meaningful set of switches before then. If you can farm up magic to a high level, fire surge is an ok alternative to trident, but you‚Äôd also need wrath runes. Ibans is probably your best bet otherwise. So it looks like for the most part melee and mage upgrades are out of reach. I‚Äôd focus on just levelling your stats as high as you can and working on farming a blowpipe. It‚Äôs a really meaningful upgrade.

Once you get enough gp for BIS gear almost all pvm becomes borderline afk outside of raids.
---
Also I have no idea where this idea that there is a skill requirement to do any pvm.   That‚Äôs some new school shit. Bro clicking a prayer on tick doesn‚Äôt take skill, I‚Äôm sorry if your favorite streamer lied to you. It‚Äôs kind of funny that you can think fighting a literally repetitive boss is somehow skillful.  It‚Äôs literally easy as shit once you learn it once.
---
The idea that pvm should be the most profitable started like around 2015. And has killed the other factions of the game.
---
Grats, king!
---
I don‚Äôt think he would be furious though.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the issue. They‚Äôre mostly pretty responsive and will fight me for drags, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some bots.
---
H
---
I‚Äôm fine with the current layout, but I‚Äôm all for customization
---
Where are all the mid-to-high level tutorials at? Every YT video I watch begins at square 1 telling you to do the Knights Sword and shit, I need someone telling me how to train mid-level smithing efficiently on my Ironman
---
Gottem
---
if that could be an option then that would be even better!!
---
Point being?
---
Upvoted since you beat me in LMS and I said I would
---
Second post ive seen you begging for go for construction, make your own gold you begging scrote
---
I don't think you understand, it doesn't take an epitome of intelligence to know a probability other than 50% can exist lol. If anyone was that dumb they wouldn't even know how to use Reddit because they probably have a condition.
---
It‚Äôs mostly bots and people doing afk money without quest requirements for better dragons.
---
I think green dragons are still like 400k/hr, definitely with the diaries done. Pretty low risk for Wildy pvm and basically click and forget.
---
But most of them are almost definitely bots or gold farmers.
---
People panicking to save the sinking ship that is pvp are overreacting about how much it would effect the game if it did die.
---
So 
---
&gt;Those who are maxed, near maxed, at their endgame point, don't want to do anything on their account or just like to compete will be doing it.
---
Are all insane? 
---
You're actually delusional. You must be competing, since no "sane" person will? 
---
&gt;you're a normie account who's only grind you know is killing zulrah and vorkath for money
---
Or...They're a "normie" account who fall into one of the categories above.
---
you mean the 5 whole people that pk ? LOL have fun with pking spades losers lol
---
Good answer bro. What a bro answer you have bro
---
before I had the stats/gears/diaries for barrows I made money smelting mithril bars at the blast furnace, doing bird house runs, and herb runs. you should be able to do the varrock medium diary and the throne of miscellania + royal trouble quests for low effort daily income as well.
---
I would go with Duradel if he assigned Hydra the highest lvl Slayer Mob but he doesn't im forced to go Konar for Hydra since it's a exclusive task.I agree Duradel should give people hydra task,so players have unrestricted slayer and access to all high end slayer monsters.
---
Im not keen on the idea of adding even more value to combat. 
---
What if it were skilling exclusive?
---
Agreed they would have to be untradable
---
Compared to the low amount of work it would require and the non zero amount of new memberships it would create, I'm surprised Jagex hasn't already done this.
---
your dumb
---
yeah sucks its not very fair, but its all about the reports, be a ghost
---
They‚Äôll probably be expensive since not everyone will be doing leagues, and most people won‚Äôt be selling their rewards I‚Äôd think. If you‚Äôre only interested in one of the rewards, you can wait to see how many rewards points it‚Äôll cost and what the effort looks like to get that many points. I can‚Äôt imagine a single reward being THAT expensive.
---
Try Vpn, helped me when i had the same problem.
---
Grats!
---
you're a G
---
BIS strength bonus until BCP.
---
Alright! i try some konar. Any advice on what to bring during slayer tasks?
---
It looks like an awful mess youre on crack
---
Googled its some anime shit.
---
Life is about choices.
---
Yeah but just because they make up a small portion of the playerbase doesn‚Äôt mean they should be entirely neglected. Up til this most recent disastrous BH update and LMS (arguably), PvP has seen no significant updates to improve it. On the flip side, PvM sees high volumes of impactful and non-impactful updates. So yeah, they don‚Äôt need much attention but that doesn‚Äôt mean they should get zero attention/bad updates.
---
You need to unlock Bones to Peaches for the Lumby Hard diary :( I just did it a couple days ago and it sucks.
---
Ever consider that some people actually like pvp and want it to be enjoyable?
---
Such a cool idea man! I‚Äôm all for it I love hunting imps.
---
Similar scam that is an attempt to phish your account I believe:
---
A guy came up to me in BH claiming he was impressed with a clip he saw of me. I replied something along the lines of ‚ÄúOh someone recorded x?‚Äù He proceeds to ask to add you and claim he needs your discord, email, or Instagram to send you a link of the video. 
---
I just deleted him at this point, but it‚Äôs pretty clear the intent is to get you to a website or download I believe. When I just asked for the name of the video on YouTube or who uploaded it so that I could search on my own, he kept making excuses.
---
So yeah be careful out there.
---
Just a heads up. You just gave out a decent amount of personal information regarding the account with this video. Might wanna delete.
---
I don't mind if they're pures afking.
---
this is just all lvl 3s
---
ohhh are these accounts that are then sold to make pures? cos some of them had good names
---
Good call, thanks.
---
Ok, that's interesting.
---
Classic getting you to give the answers. He couldn't say a name until you told him the name to use.
---
Can always in the future do a non-obvious fake, like a different normal name than anyone you know who plays.
---
Who screenshots anymore? Snipping tool ftw.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt call those things pvp

That‚Äôs cool you can disagree with that.
---
If you think that not trying to have a competitive aspect of your game flourish to bring in new people is smart.
---
I guess all the top games are non competitive right? Csgo, wow, lol, mw2, smash,and the literal hundreds of other big titles that outperform jagex as a whole isn‚Äôt a market we should care about for the future of the game.
---
You are entitled to your opinion, even if it‚Äôs an uneducated  and shitty one.
---
I still think you are an inexperienced player or just a dumb person.
---
Either way. You are entitled to your opinion.
---
If you are dpsing you should try and use tassets instead of the skirt, turn your whip into a tent whip, get a serp helm, fury or torture amulet (torture preferred if you have the money) and a bgs for speccing. Bring guthans to heal.
---
Dunno. I was afk.

---
The map in barrows crypt is removed normally, and you aren't supposed to be able to determine where you are.
---
There is definitely a balance to be struck between providing content for players with many thousands of hours and content to entice newer/mid level players to keep playing (or old players to return). You can't just go full speed ahead on a new raid every 6 months and neglect the significant portion of the playerbase who realistically can't do raids at all
---
Loot from trying to karma farm. I saw literally nobody saying what you claim the pkers said.
---
Yeah, no thanks. I'm not even at the point of being able to do zalcano but when I get there, I am not going to "just wait like everyone else" because I could care less about max efficiency/max gp per hr methods. I play the game for fun. I'm not going to intentionally grief players but that "unwritten rule" is just dumb.
---
I lost my steel legs on my f2p btw

I want bots to be banned so skilling is profitable again. i hate bot farms, and love when the zulrah bot got the axe and scale prices went back up.

A dead mini game that‚Äôs existed for years but recently got a shitty update that actually just got somewhat nerfed, a mini game that had potential but 0 rewards passed and they took away the only non laggy world and forced everyone to play on an Aussie server, and 2 chests that are dead af
---
Yup that‚Äôs a lot of updates you‚Äôre right
---
Not normal, or at least not regular. I've seen exactly 1 in my life and that's at work to the supply room where the safe with cigarettes is in.
---
Lost a fury once to kraken boss, was talking with someone in rl and looked down just in time to watch him stack me out(mobile only player) was a little mad because it was when fury's were like 2.9m ea, but just laughed it off as it was my own fault
---
It sure isn‚Äôt put take the competitive aspect out of most games and the game slowly dies.
---
Most games/titles that  have some Longevity are almost always pvp orientated.
---
I think people heavily underestimate the influence that the competitive scene has in this game.
---
Just go to East dragons
---
So, I kind of see this as a multifaceted and complex issue, and I'll try to discuss why I think PvP content is a good thing for everybody.
---
First off, I want to establish that while wildness content like Revs exist, there's always going to be some level of PvP that exists, to balance out the moneymaking rates of PvMers there. High moneymaking rates with low requirements incentivize Pkers to hunt them, which I think is a fine trade-off.
---
But that gives rise to the issue of PvMers don't like to be killed in general, and there will always be collateral players caught in the crossfire, like clue hunters or people doing MA2, which again, is fine.
---
Now, general opinion _seems_ to be that the playerbase doesn't want PKing content to *exclusively* consist of Pkers hunting down PvMers, and that an alternative should be offered in the form of intentional PvP content. That opinion existed pretty prevalently while PvP homeworlds and Bountyhunter existed, so I guess the consensus was that the line should be pushed a little more in the direction of PvP. Especially so since a stagnant Pking community (without new players or metas) exacerbates the problem. I imagine fighting the same 4 or 5 players over ad infinitum isn't *particularly* engaging, and new players running into those 4 or 5 practiced players are going to be killed very quickly and be deterred from playing.
---
So as a result, Jagex incentivized new players engaging in PvP content, in a way where money wasn't a huge barrier to entry. Pkers get more fresh and diverse engagements, a positive-sum moneymaker (which is also conceptually fine), and PvP reduces "cat-and-mouse" emphasis.
---
As with all new systems though, there are problems that need to be addressed. Obviously farming the system is a pretty big one at the moment, which is made worse by the free 14 days of membership from Twitch. That makes it hard to gauge the extent of the problem, but at least it's *very* obvious what elements need fixing.
---
Were there other ways of addressing these issues, beyond doing nothing? I'm sure there were. I think new weapons that are PvP-viable is a great way of doing so; take Dragon Thrownaxes or Dragon Knives for example. But beyond that, we keep voting down a bunch of potential ones. I don't know the extent to which they'd change the meta, for better or worse, but we *are* limiting ourselves there.
---
Overall, I think BH2 was well thought-out, from a very high level. The community is effectively schizophrenic when it comes to "wants" in terms of new content, and that's normal considering the differing opinions that are upvoted on a day to day basis, but given those opinions, I think BH2 did a good job incorporating as many reasonable ones as possible.
---
From a *low* level, there's a few important things to fix, and I'm gonna be honest here when I say I don't have all the answers. I certainly don't think the points should be as farmable as they are, but I think Jagex has yet to attach a standardized GP value to them yet, then weigh them based on that, in a way that also continues to attract new participants.
---
It's obviously not perfect, but I think it's effectively adjustable in a way where it can fit healthily within the game, and I earnestly hope that it is.
---
11k black chins... I had no idea youd lose them upon death. I was at bandits.
---
Buy a fuckload of bonds to give functional lifetime membership to all 3 of my accounts. This wouldn't cost more than like 5-10bil though
---
Max gear on all accounts obviously. A max raid setup is like 2.5b atm, so like 7.5b
---
More potions than I could conceivably know what to do with. Same for arrows/runes. Maybe like 3 or 4bil here 
---
Probably shell out for a max raids setup for my regular raids buddies, maybe like 10 of them. Total cost like 25b. 
---
At this point I've still only spent around 56b...so I guess just hold most of it.
---
its really afk and an easy money maker when you want to watch netflix and do nothing. green dragon barely even hit you if you wear decent gear. so you can fill up an inventory pretty quickly without any food for decent afk profit.
---
Help our buddy out Jagex, come on.
---
Pvp was removed 4 weeks before. Its not like it was the same time. Wildy removed did kill the game.
---
No
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of wildy slayer
---
RuneLite questions for the RuneLite discord please
---
time to learn how to pk
---
They have someone working on a new pvp event similar to deadman mode. LMS was released bringing many people into tribriding. I think they are doing a lot to give life to the competitive scene you arent giving them credit for. My point is the pvp community gets all this and then still cries that it's not enough. It will never be enough.
---
And good job going to more insults to give yourself reasons to dismiss my points lol.  "This guy doesnt think the same as me, he must just be stupid". Goodluck with that approach to life.
---
You could also start focusing on some of your passive skills (i.e. dailies) like your farm runs, birdhouse runs, etc. It's a nice money maker for low levels and it'll help bring those skills up using small increments of time.
---
You're right, no one asked for my "impute."
---
At the same time, no one asked for this shit-tier suggestion, either.
---
Will Smith would smith as much mith as Will Smith's myth.
---
The secret is killing the boss way more than the drop rate.
---
You could just buy a membership but I'm guessing that's not what you want to do. Best thing to do really is kill ofress warriors and shamans while merching. Iron ore and gold ore have gone to shit so unless you have 85 mining or 99 smithingyou have quite bad money makers.
---
Yup.
---
I‚Äôve never had anywhere to ask about this but does anyone know why they took away world 317 lms? Currently forced to play on the Aussie world as it‚Äôs the only active one and I just dc every minute
---
200m because I fell asleep while slaying zygomites
---
its mainly since the bones are noted from green dragons. plus in terms of time/kill compared to hide cost. you can kill a green drag in like 2 hits, the blue dragons and up take a lot more since higher defence and health. Plus the difference between blue and green hide is like 300gp. not much when you kill them that much faster.
---
What the fuck are you talking about ‚Äúalready made up your mind?‚Äù Actually don‚Äôt answer that just fuck off
---
??? Have you ever pvp'd? Hundreds/thousands of people are in the wilderness/LMS/pvp/bh worlds at any time. Then they get 2 small updates and 1 big one and you're legitimately complaining?
---
People like you are the worst
---
Pvp is like 80% of osrs advertising which is really important.
---
I dont understand how making like 10x more bars an hour while barely spending any gold "is a waste" but okay
---
I'm maxed main I would love to do duos. I always wanted to do a little bit of revs and have dclaws to spec people out haha.
---
It's crashing because the price of air orbs are rising.
---
Free trade removal wouldn't even impact the vast majority of pvm players (presuming some variety of coin/shardshare was available). If you remove pvp from the equation, you could remove free trade rn and I wouldn't even be upset lol.
---
Gotta turn the can upside down and punch it ombr√©. Effort was there though.
---
The bottom pic is from the video where he gets the maximum weight possible. Ammo slots don‚Äôt have a weight (wiki says mith grapple is .001kg so technically not true, but redundant nonetheless)
---
Also makes prayer swapping and other activites on mobile more viable. Things like this make doing some things such a bear. i.e. doing Demonics on mobile kind of sucks for prayer and item sitching
---
Where‚Äôs that? Other than, well, East?
---
at 100 combat use duradel, before that nieve is generally better than konar if you use a cannon on top of meleeing. it can be a good idea to use konar every 10 tasks to get the most out of the slayer point boost as she gives the most points.
---

Cannon as much as you can. It seems expensive but it will drastically speed up your tasks if you learn how to position for double hits and ranged/slayer levels are both important for progressing your account to late game money making PVM content. You should be able to cover the cost of cannonballs with herb runs, bird house runs, daily battlestaves, and managing miscellania.
---
&gt;Most games/titles that  have some Longevity are almost always pvp orientated.

Because Morrowind and super Mario are top tier PvP. If you're going to make a claim like that I'm going to need sources.

I don't subscribe to the efficiencyscape mindset, so yes. Perfectly fine with that since the boss was designed that way. I haven't done the quests to do zalcano but when I do, I won't be terribly concerned with trying to wait who knows how long just so that rank 2 smith can get his gold ores for the next record run.
---
There's a difference between not putting any effort in to finding an empty world, which would be a dick move, and not wanting to wait for an "open world" because of some nerds. The guy might not have much time to play the game either, why should he waste time waiting in an imaginary line?
---
Xd nice edit mr quif mag

For practical reasons, it pretty much lets you save the cost of a Bandos Chestplate because it has the same strength bonus. You only  buy the BCP once you buy the rest of BiS strength armor (tassets, primordials, amulet of torture, etc).

Man you are a broken record of insults and dismissal. You are doing quite a bit of mental gymnastics to invalidate my opinions. Already explained lms and the upcoming pvp event being worked on (not yet announced) are doing a lot for competitive scene when it comes to viewership and something people watch. I look forward to new pvp events like dmm, but I don't see any good ideas for the main game, do you have any?
---
Because then if the original 4 are going for efficiency, they are forced out and have to look for a new world. And let me tell you, it sucks spending 15 minutes finding an open world just for some guy to crash your group 2 games later, forcing you to look all over again.
---
Crystal armor seed is 1/50. Blade of Sailing is 1/400.

That's like 1/20,000 I guess. It's more common than a smoldering stone from a hellhound.

To hijack this for GIM questions:

Yeah I mean I didn't even realize it was a social engineering attempt until he asked me to do something for him. Casually saying hi and just talking random nonsense is really not suspicious. His speech with me was similar, not entirely the same though. The second he "asked" for something though red flags came up, I mean I'm not entirely a dunce.
---
Now lets wait for Rendi to do it on a level 3 with a 5m setup.
---
So a little rarer than a smoldering stone from a hellhound.

Causing you to wait in ‚Äúan imaginary line‚Äù twice.

The wilderness podcast for just a good casual OSRS podcast. Almost 150 episodes, very well structured show and very mature hosts. More of your typical all around topic podcast that does the research. Can be hit or miss on weekly episodes but not too far off.
---
Hexis podcast is all members from a skilling clan. They can have very strong opinions, and sometimes strike me as elitist, but overall it‚Äôs a good show if you‚Äôre into more informed discussion. Very scheduled uploads weekly.
---
Old School Runescape Weekly is a few guys I would say are ‚Äúaverage level‚Äù they talk about finishing quests, grinding stats for SOTE, etc. They treat the show very casually if you don‚Äôt mind that. They‚Äôre very inconsistent in scheduled episode dates however, and can be missing major details of information or have the wrong information altogether.
---
There are a couple YouTube podcasts, namely OSRS weekly with Ricecup, Raiksey and MintMadCow. I rarely listen as they refuse to upload anywhere but YouTube. It‚Äôs a decent show, but they speak over each other very often, spend large parts of the episodes at times on tangents and just going back and forth over random small talk. They usually have a guest on the show, and do upload regularly.
---
I have a hellishly long commute so I listen to any OSRS podcast I can find. Hope this helps

Obsidian is better dps than Rapier in bandos by a significant margin even with 75 attack/str in NMZ. Unless you're adding in monsters with high defense it shouldn't even be close. 
---
You obviously either added monsters that have too high of defense or weren't attacking all the time. 
---
Check the DPS calcs or people with youtube videos. The stats don't lie.
---
Yeah, I usually do them, I was close to finishing a task and I had a friend ask me something about work and I messed up, looked down just in time to watch my guy hit the ground and poof respawns. But we all make mistakes at some point in the game haha

Apart from the specs, everything you listed come down to preference lol
---
&gt;My objection is that safety nets in the wilderness are stupid and only serve to make the game easier for no reason.
---
The reason is that players should have to risk losing their 3 protected items to fend off attackers.
---
Would you be in favour of a change that makes all worlds high risk worlds?
---
&gt;You can‚Äôt have the best of both worlds where you can attack people but have zero risk of skulling.
---
We can! The game is capable of identifying which player has attacked another and a new option could be added to the Player 'Attack' options drop down to allow left clicks only on such players.
---
Did the same thing for quite a few of my first runs
---
same with LMS
---
Fuck you blast furnace is fine

The Cerberus plugin removal was bullshit. There were legitimate colourblind people in the thread explaining how difficult Cerberus is without the plugin due to some of the ghosts being indistinguishable.

Like I never played WoW but I watched a raid video once to see what it was all about, and understood heavy breathing and raid commands are scary.
---
As long as they were quite advanced , I wouldn't see an issue. 
---
Would be a cool "fuck you" moment when the NPC spawns (bot indicates its being ran off the server), is able to spec twice, and actually win, and is able to carry on fighting until someone wins out against it.m, and gains an amalgam of loot from the pkers its rinsed out. Makes it's kinda like a random event for pvp.
---
P.s: it's been mentioned but change bot to npc as it's a completely different thing in context to osrs...
---
I don't think hardly anybody would take the time to grow anything other than maybe the occasional dimp or lucky imp... and most Oriole wouldn't even have the requirements for that.
---
But if Will Smith will smith mith, will Will Smith *sell* mith? If so, how much profit/loss will Will Smith have if Will Smith will smith mith?
---
I know these pov stories are going to be fucking hilarious whenever I see chemocamel's name at the top. Tell your copycats to take some notes. Never stop doing these, please and thank you.
---
Until you get a task in a shitty location.
---
yeah. being frugal is fun but at a certain point you gotta realize that in the 5 minutes you spent cutting trees in a farm run to save 1k gold you could have cut an inventory of magic logs and made 25k

Was it ever up?

No those with good names are a different bot owners farm, 2 bot farms running at LMS since Thurdays.

I don't hate pvp just pvpers

pls accept me

I've gotten my attack and strength up to 72 (was 70/65) and my prayer to 60 (was 43) since my last chest. My girlfriend has a ton of studying to do tonight so I'm going to do a few runs tonight. I use the ring of wealth as well to try and get better drops.

all the variants of 50/60 attack + 85-88-99 strength + 95 range and mage and 1/40/42/45/70 defense  are pretty much top tier in their combat brackets.

My set up is such, rangers, Robin, anguish. Snide chaps and vamps, diamond bolts e. I‚Äôm 1 def

I don‚Äôt think you understand how little this item would actually be used..

Weird flex but okay

Will Smith will smith as much mith as Will Smith will smith if Will Smith could smith mith

Bro my childhood dream was mining rune and making it into bars to make armor for my f2p friends in my elementary schools computer lab. Who tf wants 200m xp as a kid??

Castle wars is definitely up towards the top for sure.

you lose money when you buy them on rs3, if they've dealt with that problem for years i doubt the oldschool team will care

If we are talking technically, it's a plant that gives you Impling rewards, but lore wise it's a plant that Implings adore eating so they feast on it's fruit. It's a single game entity
---
Longsword will never be better due to decrease in attack speed
---
High how are you
---
I mean PKing is kind of staking, so it could be 1b/h if that's what your opponent is risking. But it shouldn't *generate* 20m/h into the game.
---
So guessing the defender roll might be the only one I have a problem with üôÑ the video guides on yt seem to be too in depth and not simplified enough ( or I'm just too simple lol) 4-5 hours seems like a worthwhile investment considering you get a max hit out of it. The BCP seems too far off (104cb ironman) so maybe the best choice for me would be to just go for it!
---
How?

They pretty much dif this with the [Baby Troll](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Baby_Troll) pet in 2012. Was always cool to see ‚ÄòChristmas Cracker‚Äô ones.

Chickens can hit. They just don't have the dps to kill you with 10hp

Use defender at dragons and a potion, still better.

I like this but something other than teleblock. Currebtly if you world hop teleblock goes away so the half teleblock eould do nothing at all. I would sugjest just not letting them roam below lvl 30 wildy

How much profit will Will Smith smith when Will Smith smiths the mith?

Cool? Not his problem. That just reinforces what I said.
---
Coal is actually \~145 each though so all of this math is wrong.  It's actually 695 RSGP/bar.  You tricked poor Will Smith into a myth about the amount of mith he could smith.

I had an aberrant spectre task yesterday where I got 3 superior and 6 brimstone keys. No drops but I was still hyped

Ah darn, you didn‚Äôt specify at first.

Except gauntlet is a comparison to CoX/GWD/Zulrah. It‚Äôs almost 3M/hr if your have the herblore level. Shards are valued at 18K EACH. (7 corrupt gauntlets/hr and zero supply costs)

Nothing happened :/ 10k upvotes and still no Jmod Smackdown.

For real?

you have to talk to oziach

It takes me 10-15 minutes to do a 7 herb patch run with all of the teles you listed above with 99 farming. The teles/walking isn't what take up time its actually harvesting the herb, planting it and composting it
---
You can usually make a profit alching rune items. There is a cc that trades them in bulk so you don't have to deal with buy limits I cannot remember the name but it was something like "w368 anvil" but a different world number.

Excuse me what? No no no no, we don't want skilling in the wilderness where the skiller can fight back! Only naked guys being hunted! Bad idea! Bad!

Bravo.

If Will Smith reinvests the money that Will Smith made when Will Smith smithed Will Smiths mith Will Smith could smith more of Will Smith‚Äôs smithed mith. Therefore the amount Will Smith will smith is dependent on what Will Smith smiths when Will Smith smiths Will Smith‚Äôs mith. Based on extensive research of Will Smith smithing mith Will Smith will smith mith sq shields when Will Smith smiths Will Smith‚Äôs mith. Will Will Smith smithing Will Smiths smithed mith into mithril shields make money? Well Will Smith smithed mithril shields will be only be smithed by Will Smith so Will Smith could smith more money by marketing mith smithed by Will Smith as Will Smith smithed mith. Then Will Smith will smith much more mith than Will Smith would smith if Will Smith sold mith as just smithed mith.
---
i'll throw in 12 billion usd but it has to be within the first 13 minutes of the game mode
---
You wouldnt have asked this question if you were out of the loop
---
Interesting.
---
Given his 700T RSGP, Will Smith will smith mith until Will Smith smiths away his bank. At a loss of 75/bar, Will Smith can smith  9,333,333,333,333 mith bars for 280,000,000,000,000 smithing XP, or  21,481,566 times 99 smithing.
---
At 99 farming with 9 patches, I usually get between 200-300k profit per herb run. A run takes about 5 minutes including banking. This brings the effective profit to 2.4-3.6m gp/h. So unless you're doing something that makes more than 2.4m gp/h, it's more profitable to stop whatever you're doing to do a herb run every 80 minutes.
---
Nope. I've only been back a couple of months but this has definitely been the biggest let down by far for me.
---
Look at this dude dumb enough to give corporations free advertisement. Good sheep, keep it up! Consume, **consume, CONSUME!**

I recently did it and it‚Äôs not too bad except the alch room. If that room gave you as many points as the maze room I think a lot more people would do it. I haven‚Äôt done the graveyard room yet though.
---
Was thinking of a new prayer from a fremmi quest for 45 def pures called berzerker I propose it would boost boost attack and strength by 20% lower defence by 15% if you wanted to ballance for pvm just have it so you can use protect from prayers with it on.
---
I‚Äôve got that one down. Definitely worth the time! I‚Äôll look into the wiki.
---
Now that's just a tongue twister ;)
---
Build up that str. Nmz and crabs are great afk xp. Since you have 53 defense, consider making a piety build and doing the associated quest for that. Needs 70 defense as well.

Adding demonic gorillas (a good profitable task) to konar is objectively a buff to konar

And therefore a buff to slayer

Thats not hard to understand

Tell your friend to get off his ass and get a job!
---
It appears you've calculated what will happen if Will Smith will **smelt** mith, if Will Smith will smith mith, Will Smith will get 50xp per smithed mith.
---
I dunno about this one. Even outside the wilderness, high-value implings are rare and the people who can barehand catch them aren't common either. 
---
If they're the only kind of impling that can appear at their (new) spawns then the rate will have to be quite slow and randomized. Current implings are somewhat mitigated by the fact that Ninja/Lucky imps are *not* frequently spawned. 
---
Could be a decent little bonus for a high hunter level in a dangerous place, but I'm not sure if it'd make a big impact.
---
You aren't doing 9 patches in 5 minutes. It's physically impossible.
---
Billing issues they will work with. Use the contact support page on the main runescape website.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs it.
---
For added reassurance, jagex recently specifically said RuneLite is 100% OK to use.
---
I've been complaining about this for ages, and someone from the reddit hivemind always argues with or downvotes me. The main difference why RS2 was an objectively superior game to OSRS almost entirely boils down to the fact that the guys in China who bought Jagex a few years ago are effectively starving the game into the ground.
---
We have some seriously fantastic updates, raids, Prif, etc, but they are so few and far between and the devs are so horribly overworked that it just drags the game down. Every update always ends up feeling rushed because the dev team constantly has a gun to their head to push something out every week. The updates end up buggy, or pointless, and people get bored and quit.
---
RS2 had a solid 2 updates per month that were at least comparable to frem exiles, and one comparable to prif every 2-3 months. We constantly had new stuff to play with because jagex bothered to reinvest the profits back into the game instead of funneling it into some Chinese billionaire's pockets.
---
Runescape IS a cash cow for the investors.
---
Will something be done about all the people begging at the Dueling Arena for lends of money to stake with under the "promise" to pay them back? This is even more a problem for streamers and content creators doing this and being multiple billions of GP in "dept". This is a problem and should be dealt with, especially when a lot of content creators are doing it, when they should be held to a higher standard. A similar approach could be taken as what was done with commission staking.
---
also, was mentioned a long time ago about Hardcore Iron-men dropping red bones on death, no benefit to it just a fun collection to have. Has there been any thought to that since it was last mentioned?
---
But you're not looking at the picture in the picture
---
Just letting you know that bottomless compost bucket and the fertile soil spell exist (just in case you are still juggling buckets for compost).
---
Is this an OC copypasta?
---
Actually I think Will Smith isn‚Äôt currently in the Tongue Twister clan. You may be thinking of Woodchuck, the Woodcutting 200m pure.
---
They alive damn it!
---
I'm gonna have to go do this. Fucking weeds have tick-perfect timing in a way I never will.
---
I think you may misunderstand the definition of random.
---
What ever that guy is actually saying must be the funniest thing on earth.

Cuz some reddit users are sheep so if the first couple of people downvoted it's just a spiral from there, I threw him an upvote cuz I dont think that should have been downvoted.

The fact that he says that this is "but it is a common theme people have noticed" is hilarious lol, I'd like to see the statistical analysis that isn't just confirmation bias.

When it comes to active players who enjoy playing it, yes. When it comes to streaming or youtube, no.

once you're at like 80+ slayer you'll be raking in cash, runes, etc. and you'll be able to afford construction/crafting/herblore/fletching/smithing
---
Memory reasons, a lot of the number caps are related to the data type used to store the amounts. For example, Zulrah scales cap at 65535 (2^16 is 65536, which is also the capacity of an unsigned "short". This data type is used to save space when memory is an issue).

OwO

All it says for me is "Evidence Type:¬†Jagex Moderator Comment"

I guess there is nothing technically preventing players from starting an insurance firm ingame tbh.

That deserves a purple

Im loving this new spin more and more every episode. Bring it on #TeamLink
---
Why in a store
---
Shred that Les Paul for us
---
I understand you polled to make runepouches/looting bag tradeable WHEN they were already tradeable. Now players that use dozens of looting bags and rune pouches a day need to play Bounty Hunter to get these items. I would argue Bounty Hunter remake hurt pvp even more. Could we poll to make tier 10 emblems tradeable?
---
It‚Äôs tied for the best-in-slot melee body with the BCP, which only offers better defense. It‚Äôs strength bonus outweighs its defensive shortcomings
---
They're trying to find justification for losing money when it's just maths playing out. Stake tax = projected loss, losses money **_SurprisedPikachuFace_**
---
So THAT'S where Torvesta got that sound effect from
---
Yes, everything is kept in the storage including untradeables
---
Because he probably didn't want to lose 600m for no reason when he has to fund prayer and construction.
---
someone ig told me jagex bans are always justified. I told him to fuck himself
---
You mean purple
---
Only way to keep the same username is via double bonding the first acc to change its name twice so its no longer linked to an account in game and then creating the next account with that username.
---
Works in hard too. Hard doesn't change the def level. Just look up each of the bosses the ones with low def you want.
---
It‚Äôs not even against the rules to crash irons.
---
Never said I didnt like the community. Objectively they are small and not as important as the rest of the community, thus deserve less updates. I disagree that pvp is required for longevity.
---
What child had this goal in 2007? All I wanted was a phat
---
I am very curious about this as well, it seemed extremely random and unnecessary. I'm forced to play on the american FTP world now which is filled with bots and about 200 ping, which is annoying.
---
Thank you m8
---
imagine being so sad you getting iron man that can kill kraken banned for telling someome to commit suicide
---
Originally there were only 3 spirit tree patches: Etceteria, Brimhaven, Port Sarim. 
---
That is why the progression is 83 -&gt; 91 -&gt; 99
---
I think you're taking this a little too seriously. 
---
Maybe it's just the lesson those people need, that loaning people money holds the risk of not getting the money back.
---
I mean, lots of situations where you loan money between friends and acquaintances hold no real legal obligation to pay back a loan, yet it can still be called a loan to your friend.
---
If you don't pay them back, you're probably out a friend, though.
---
So... you're basically take the item sink idea the troll pet from rs3 has and putting it into a cosmetic ring... that barely anyone will use since we already have cosmetic override rings in game.... good luck getting anyone behind that. lol
---
Nice man - catching up to Will Smith I see
---
Did you by chance say out loud 'brown apron' over a microphone? I know google tracks and shows ads based off what you say. It's always listening.
---
*Barrores
---
The twist is that OP is 14
---
So in other words, he pulled it out of his ass?
---
The bots have definitely been around for a while. Couple weeks back the FTP german world was completely filled with bots, then the US ftp world was filled with bots, so you could always farm free points if you wanted to (sometimes the guy running the farm would shut it down temporarily tho of course).
---
The difference now is that they've removed the main LMS p2p world, forcing anyone who wants to actually play the minigame into the FTP bot infested worlds.
---
Do you know why they removed 317? seems retarded as fuck.
---
So we just say fuck it and tank it more?
---
 I went 90 chests dry of any item. Delete this
---
making a joke and people don't understand
---
How exactly are you going through dozens of rune pouches a day?
---
You just put the guthans on when you need to heal, so not much dps sacrifice.
---
Holy shit you‚Äôre dense af
---
I‚Äôm making a guess here, but I think it‚Äôs because other dragonstone jewellery can be recharged outside of the wilderness. ROW can be recharged exclusively at the fountain of rune; the scroll probably doesn‚Äôt work on them to try and keep a reason for people to have to go there other than extra teleport charges.
---
Actually?
---
83 construction is worth it no matter what method you use, the ornate jewelry box and best rejuvenation pool are so nice to have
---
None of them are unique anymore.
---
Just bank them and cook on a range, less burn rate. Especially at hosiduis range
---
Can people stop fucking asking how rare their drop is jesus christ
---
That‚Äôs an oof if I‚Äôve ever seen one.  
---
If it makes you feel any better I got my squirrel back from insurance not 20 seconds before seeing this post.
---
It is. In fact the only time I'd say guthans is good is off task, without slay rings and unable to take the chains up. Otherwise using a good dps weapon, whip or better would be best always.
---
first one should just say "rs" tbh
---
Why‚Äôs he talkin like a road man
---
There's a general belief among players that introducing more money sinks is always a good thing however lately some have been arguing that the supply of GP is stable as it is and what we really need are *resource* sinks. From the perspective of your developers are either of these ideas true? How do you guage the need for money/resource sinks?
---
&gt;bank
---
What style of hair does your character have?

Thank you. :)

I dunno man I asked you a simple question and you didn't answer it, maybe you're the dense one
---
That hurts even more now. Im getting stacked out for 10hp constantly trying to get my cash back from the top of the pyramid. Heres my 4th trying to finish a lap. Fk me for doing this at 52
---
Because it takes forever to find people if you are a pker to the point that all there is are scout bots and baits for 20man ancestral teams to abuse the NO PJ SYSTEM and slap you. Not to mention this would make items go UP in price because there would be more demand and DANGEROUS to go for the items in the wilderness. Remember, the WILDERNESS is the only dangerous place left in RUNESCAPE. Pvm has no risk for dying with BiS gear.
---
Damn, TIL. It's like 800-1000 gp \*per rune 2h\*
---
My laptop decided to die so I'm not even sure if I will give it a shot...
---
Right? I totally agree, I mean even if I really enjoyed it or whatever, wouldn't you be embarrassed? Just look at the comments on the 1atatime post legitimately saying stuff like "this is sad" and "get help"
---
I mean shit I'd be self conscious wearing a max cape lol
---
Yeet
---
Shhhhh they'll fix it.
---
Anger
---
Crtl+w while at the duel area will grant you luck
---
They don't really exist with a 45-second pj timer. I could actually fight back then. They basically are overpowered because a solo pker has no retaliation. By the time I get 2 hits on them from auto-retaliate on a 20man fall in I get pjed by the next guy. PvP is dead because of them and the fact players can't fight back.
---
how about the first few people to lend him 100m, 200m, 500m? people who have supported him for years and donated tons etc? seen him pay back before now second time they get scam. why we victim blaming and not seeing how scumbag this is? u his sub? his mod?

You know you can just ignore content if you don‚Äôt want to risk anything, right?  Not that it matters anyway because this impling will never get made.

Customization would be cool, but doing what you suggested would make the left side UI utterly useless for nearly everything in game
---
Can you elaborate on what you‚Äôre trying to say, I‚Äôm confused over the context you‚Äôve put your statement. 
---
What are you trying to say here? I can‚Äôt tell whether you‚Äôre agreeing or disagreeing with OP.
---
That's like saying all mains are crashers because op is a main.
---
Lol for me a max cape at least is a goal though that has reasoning behind it. 200m exp in a skill holds no value. There are so many games out there worth playing, it just seems like a shame almost to waste all that time on a pointless thing in osrs when you could spend it doing something worth while. I get it if someone loves a game and wants to max out in it, or accomplish 100% or all achievements etc. But there is usually a reason behind that. 200m exp though like i said just has no actual value.
---
Well I didn't sell my dhcb nor my lance so I'm okay lol. I never have luck in these kind of situations so I didn't even try
---
I tried Kraken outside of an instance just once, after 20 kills some guy in maxed gear just strolls in and takes it over out damaging me (and clearly would every time if I stayed) so fuck that. Instance every time.
---
My only point is there's other issues that affect prices too, BH didn't ruin everything over a weekend. Also he was being a dick ig was my side point so
---
Lms is my favorite thing in osrs, the bots suck :(
---
Oh ok that would make sense if the wilderness was un accessable on every other world if thats what youre saying then id agree. However if they are saying that only 20 worlds have pvp and the rest are for pvm's to kill bosses without the risk of dying then id say that is a dumb idea
---
I bet you're not even region locked you casual scum. Ironman updates always ruin my even more hardcore experience
---
I was like you and just kept grinding Slayer.  Once I got high enough to do gargoyles and wyverns money was never a problem again.
---
The most impressive stat is runecrafting because he hasn't committed not living yet.
---
Mods and almost every single person here
---
If the Venezuelans gold farmers don't get banned despite people mistakenly reporting them as bots constantly then there doesn't seem to be too much to worry about.
---
It is definitely an issue but this subreddit can make things seem worse than they are sometimes.
---
Good point, it's just so immensely pointless, I mean some skills you've actually got to spend millions of GP to gain XP just for a leaderboard, it's insane
---
Too fat to type back. Lmfaooo
