I have heard so much shit about doxing, hacking, scamming, ddosing and every other way someone could fuck up someone else on the internet from people in big clans and dead man mode and stuff, wouldn't think it would be that bad in lms but I guess it carries over.

Please God let this pass. This would be great to see. Funny thing is when I was in Vegas I saw SGDQ live on one of the monitors they use for watching and betting on sports, wouldn't be shocked if they weren't betting because it was a banjo kazooie race.
---
It absolutely will. People didn't know what the hell they were doing back in 2004-2005. After a couple of months, people will be able to use the experiences of current Classic compared with what they learned the first time to hard-optimize.
---
Quests are a great way to start out. Good rewards, xp, and gets you to explore.
---
No you doodle, me spongebob
---
tbh it doesn't even matter because the sort of person to join a clan like this is probably shit, it would only matter if an actual pk clan decided to do this for some reason in which case hiding the dots wouldn't matter because they would be on discord anyway.
---
Fuuuuuuuck

I'm a little out of touch in the community, what was the drama in April?

Still don't get people who hate RC forcing themselves to do the least enjoyable and most intense method.

Just go afk zmi like every other person.

Because of the absolutely stupid idea of "Hey we know you guys have been asking for a lot of this stuff, like extra POH wallkits, but you'll only get them if we get someone to sponsor them!".

Honestly lavas have been pretty chill, been rewatching the boys and the clicks sort of become muscle memory

This is every community, not just PVP. The few times I‚Äôve been in PVP situations, words were not exchanged at all. Except this one time I was cannoning hellhounds by the deserted keep and some little level 80-something in monk robes tried me 4 times. I killed him every time and on the fourth one I asked ‚Äúwhy are you even still trying?‚Äù And he said ‚ÄúI really want that cannon bro.‚Äù 
---
 
---
It was on the ground lmao. I almost wanted to buy the cute lil noob his very own cannon, but I couldn‚Äôt find him again. Free monk robes tho :)
---
As someone who's not the slightest bit of interested in PvP, I'd vote for anything that would take PvPers out of my face and pit them against each other

Your guildies are correct.There was a blue pin post on the wow classic forums that stated in upping the total cap of each server.

Q
---
At Vorkath, what's the advantage of Void? I plugged it into Bitterkoekjes's DPS calculator and I don't see where Void beats god d'hide when playing with my stats. I'm using a rune cb, if that matters. Just curious because I always see people in Void armor at Vorkath and figured I looked pretty nooby with my current setup.
---
Not every realm is full.
---
The farming outfit is so much cooler on female characters. Also bankstanding in a woven top and short shorts with matching flowers is at least 1m an hour.
---
I feel you dude. I'm a med level account, all skills are 50-75 and the struggle is real. I've made most of my money by settings certain items to always be buying more at the g.e. and crafting all the nature runes to alch them. Turns out to be about a quarter mill per day of profit for 240 alchs. 
---
I basically just did it as a daily until I got my first 10mil, now I have like 50-something rc and I despise it with everything in my being. Just to unlock death runes which I want for mage training, id have to spend like 20-50 more hours making nature's. Ugh.
---
Apparently they didn‚Äôt agree with me lol
---
it's funny to see people not understand obvious sarcasm
---
Oml the way the  kid is sitting makes it look like your leg is the kids leg, I was staring at that for like a whole minute

Dingaling. Many project managers are rubbish and just hoisting the role onto someone will have it's own issues.
---
But given the spaghetti nature of Jagex's codebase, things like this will happen and they're quick to hotfix which is good enough. That's the nature of delivery complex change, you can try to mitigate it but it happens. Probably some difference between "test' and "prod" is what did it,   hopefully they add some more automated regression tests to prevent this from happening again.
---
Except it's the opposite...
---
Void is eventually better at a high range level.  If you're like below 90 range then it's probably right that d'hide actually is better DPS.
---
Take my upvote while your are knocking this poor man out, and rob him from his goldpieces

ALOT of stupid people go into the Wildy wearing things they don't want to lose.

True, but the rat is lower level. And has no ranged attacks. And there's only one of them.

And most importantly, I was in heavy armor- which, at that point, I didn't know would make me more vulnerable to magic.

The entire video they produce is an ad for osrs. A lot of these guys do this for a living and aren't making anywhere near as much as sick nerd and B0aty. They aren't advertising gambling sites like a friend so most of us who enjoy their content think it's absolutely fine.

This message brought to you by the OSBuddy Gang.
---
Oh, ToB risks 100k each time. Very very very punishing to die there, my bad. 
---
Pvm is lower skilled. ToB and the inferno are the only two exceptions and even still, I would say hybriding well is more difficult. Thats simply because all pvm interactions are predictable. Every single one. They all have patterns and once you know the pattern its easy to beat.  Pvp? There are zero patterns.  The goal is to predict outcomes like in chess or connect 4. But because you have a thinking opponent, its never predictable like a robot is.
---
But since you dont like the rewards, i can respect that even if I heavily disagree. What exactly would be a fitting reward in your oppinion then?
---
How about if items went straight from bank to being equipped? So only works with equip-able items ? Can‚Äôt think any immediately obvious way that would impact skilling?

Exactly, rings are for fancy boys anyway

You need to learn which items to flip. Some are scary to flip but it's part of learning
---
There are bots thay create bots. It's insane lol
---
Literally every single one!  Lmfao. Ags, claws, elder maul, kodai, ancestral, bandos, torso, zerker helm, ballista, gmaul, whip.  Literally EVERY SINGLE ITEM used in pvp.
---
(Meant pvp gear rewarded through pvm whoops)  
---
It wasnt an insult to you though, or an insult at all. It is the ONLY reason there is, to not want to pvp, if you do pvm. Its the same thing. Your killing an enemy. The only difference is that one fights back and thinks, and the other doesnt. So unless you can provide me with some reason pvp is bad outside of ‚Äòi dont like it‚Äô it boils down to pvmers being bad at it, and not wanting to get better at it.
---

I use Datmaker to convert it to a .mqo, then use Metasequoia to convert that to a .obj, and then open the .obj through Cinema 4D. I have to do all the texturing by hand, because some weird shit happens when converting it to a .obj file, and once I've manually painted on the textures I bake the object to get a UV mapped texture file so that I can use mixamo to rig the character models. It's pretty tedious but it's really satisfying seeing it all come together.

Getting the RC requirement out of the way for an ironman or even a normal mid level account would be massive for DKs alone.

It wouldn't have rolled back that far, just to right b4 the update

Thanks

Did the same once I got my first graceful at the rune later. Learned a good lesson that day

Perhaps we should alter the clue scroll thing a little so its like a chance at a clue scroll! I think that would make it more inline with imps
---
you guys are criticising the games someone plays... they're not required by law to constantly be on os and monitoring it, people have lives and enjoy a variety of games, thats why burning out of playing games is a thing.
---
Obviously WoW being a competitor, its a shame they choose that but thats just my opinion; and only because theyre mods for this community. I dont go out barking what i think as if ive got the better say. 
---
Let them play what they want, none of us would want to be hounded down by others because of the games we play. They're already being heavily criticized by a divided community, and if we go as low as to complain about the games THEY play, where tbe motive in continuing to love what yoy do and work for.
---
Rs isnt "just" a game i play, its where i go when i feel like shit, and the COMMUNITY helps me relax. We should treat our mods how we treat eachother, with love and respect, because in the end of it all who tf made this game. Not me, nor you, the mods and development team; and for that i thank you guys.
---
Undeserved but it's pretty impressive IMO that you're able to get 23k pts in a solo at such a low KC.

I loved that mechanic tbh. Loaning a phat for a mill for 24 hours was so bad ass lol

Yeah for real, you don't even have to hit half way to max to do everything.

Can you not understand how someone would think they don‚Äôt, given the glaring oversight presented in this post? It‚Äôs not hard to anticipate a mistake like this.
---
Yep, it still shows god d'hide as slightly better, both at 99 ranged and 77 ranged (my current level)
---
This is why you dont boost player stats to max for mini-games
---
These rewards need to be polled with the stipulation that you may only vote if you‚Äôve gotten atleast 5 lms wins.
---
Fuck this ‚Äòi dont even participate in this content but im going to tell you if you‚Äôre allowed to have fun!‚Äô Bullshit.
---
PvMers gunna shit themselves when death mechanics come back.
---
Tbh they fucked up by making a mid level Slayer boss attached to Gargoyles. By the time you reach 75 Slayer you have enough combat XP to take on bosses like Zulrah and Vorkath so who would ever bother with this shit.
---
When you put a lot of time into getting better at something competitive maybe you‚Äôll understand the joy of shit talking. I agree rs players take it way too far but like halfway in between OSRS players and redditors is the right amount of shit to talk.
---
If you end up not liking vork, you unlock runedrags after ds2 and they profit about 1.3-1.7m per hour and are pretty afk.
---
Probably not a waste of time as reports can be helpful in confirming someone is botting on top of the built in automatic triggers that detect bad botting programs.
---
A lot of these bots aren‚Äôt meant to last any ways. They bot as hard as they can then quickly dump their resources to another account before they get banned.
---
He‚Äôs single ladies
---
They might have even added that bit at the end of chapter 5.. I dont normally use exclamation points and that part just sounds weird

False, logging off is xp waste, closest i get to not being online is privite chat off and 6hour logs for a split second.

facts. it's not all about gp when you hate doing the boss cuz the mechanics are annoying

They also added that super condescending post after it failed

You guys are all very wrong for saying that I'm a creep for pointing out something that came off as creepy to me.
---
And it will STILL be slower than a main with 4 alts slobbering over their keyboard for 15m/hr at rune drags.
---
Just because they unlock at 75 doesn't mean you can kill them efficiently at 75.  I think GGs are one of the most fun and engaging bosses, and there are a lot of ways to optimize for faster kills and less damage taken.  The drop table just needs buffed to account for the difficulty and slower kill times.
---
Tldr: Git gud.
---
Would be funny if graceful had anything to do with movement. 
---
Hello downvotes
---
im sorry but I've never seen 1 second ping before that's terrible
---
I think the fact that I've played well over 100 LMS games and never seen a competent opponent use it a single time is a good indicator that it should just be removed.  I've died to GMaul combos a bunch, which I would argue is the second worst item.  But GMaul should stay
---
If you want help, I will personally teach you 1 on 1. There are alot of ins and outs to pking, and fundamentally, aside from the death mechanics change, the reason people dont like pvp, is because its a trial by fire. They dont start out good at it, and its discouraging to never get kills. So they stop practicing it and just do pvm. The  we end up without pvp updates for 3 years.
---
So, if you‚Äôd like some help, and some practice, ill help you get through your trial by fire so you can see how fun it is. Just shoot me a dm.

&gt;taking advantage of Jagex's mistake in the hopes to get away with it
---
He reported it and posted it on reddit. Its like having boosted stats and just trying something out to see if it actually works. Stop being a brainlet. I heard the gold price of ropes and chairs have gone down recently in GE. Look into that buddy  :)
---
Use mage instead, she's very resistant to range
---
Remember that was happening on every world too. It was an absolutely insane amount of gp flooding the market. People were hiding their bows by trading them to alts, dieing at zulrah/vorkath, and a few other ways. A rollback was inevitable which is why people are kinda skittish now when Jagex says they wont do a rollback. Even though what happened with LMS was far less dramatic.
---
hahahuffawhjkasjhaf SO FUNNY BECAUSE ITS THE SAME JOKE EXCEPT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AHAHHAHA
---
You're probably counting incorrectly tbh
---
&gt; Some of the main characters of the games were placed in big cities and early zones so players could say "holy shit it's that person! Wow that's so cool I can talk to them and stuff!"
---
yup that was me when I was like 10-12 after playing a shit ton of warcraft 3 and meeting Thrall
---
I've tried mage, the problem is that I'm only 67 mage and can't do enough DPS.

I thought you meant general graardor vs a black dragon or sth who would win lol.

What would be the better option to grid from level 80 magic to 82? High alchemy or string jewelry? Trying to get to 82 for magic imbue during runecrafting.

Get to 75 and use a trident. Range is not going to go well.
---
Wow.

Ya just for 99 agility alone it takes 10 days, which is the average time to hit 60 in classic wow (conservatively).

Also, yeah people are already playing super efficiently now. Just go into any major city and see the people running dungeons all day.

I‚Äôm glad the 47 47 DDs special attacks identity gives you enough reason to keep playing, awesome for u that Jagex also added the option to buy gold so you can all achieve the same unique weapons. Save that birthday money for a tbow!

Sadly yes. Part of it is how quick they make the accounts, hell the have the accounts already made. So once one goes down then they fire up the next one

They definitely should poll tridents to work in PvP. They only max like a 30 against players and are whip/scim speed. The d scim hits a lot harder, and even an msb on rune arrows has a slightly lower max hit but attacks at 3-tick.

The beeping makes it literally the most annoying song in that game.
---
Yes, but also because their room layout is kinda shit compared to Kalphites and Dagannoths which are good cannon tasks because they're in multi and the room layout lets you hit a ton of them with the cannon.
---
Haha Thanks! Pretty sure my landlord upstairs thinks much differently of me after hearing those noises come from a grown ass man
---
He's probably like me. Whenever I need to get somewhere, I click to reorient North. Then I start moving and keep it mostly North. Then if needed, I adjust whenever I get somewhere.

The zoom and angle off the ground aren't as important as the mostly North orientation.

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pet

Still only says 4, I don't think it's right

At the same time you'd have to ask, why isn't there a Demonics pet for MM2 but multiple pets for SotE, and Vorkath for DS2. It also sets a precedent for a Seren Shard and Glough pet since you can refight those too.
---
&gt;  now I'm gonna send this to my colorblind friend and annoy him with irritating ass questions about "what color is this to you?"

Am colorblind. Really not as funny as you think it might be.

My family is Venezuelan or has lived in Venezuela, and it's super depressing hearing about what once was their beautiful country compared to what it is now. The fact that my family's culture is the butt of the joke at every corner in one of my favorite childhood games really sucks too. Not that I get particularly offended or anything, but for a lot of people now Venezuela's legacy is OSRS bot/gold farmers. :/
---
(I suspect) the .objs aren't textured because 'scape uses Vertex Colours for most things.
---
at the end of the favor guides on youtube, they list off the rewards you get in most houses. but the general rewards you want are: 
---
hodius: this will grant you access to the woodcutting guild which gives you an invisible +7 boost and has really close deposit boxes, as well as tithe farm, which lets you train farming with constant xp/hr
---
shayzien: the ability to fight lizardmen shaman for a chance at the dragon warhammer
---
arceuus: the ability to craft blood runes at 77 rc, and a teleport striaght to kourend castle
---
piscarillius: the ability to catch anglerfish
---
and lovakenj: access to blast mining and the mine cart transportation system
---
You need to partner with the spiffing brit, I‚Äôm sure he would support this 100%. Would probably be sponsored - not sponsored by Yorkshire gold
---
Making the dust tradeable would potentially help the gp/hr. It is retarded that the gmaul add on is not being offered to go to GG, though.

Food stamps buy food, money buys iPhones. I am in no way a sociologist but I would hazard a guess that when a lower income person receives a reasonable sum of money they would rather spend it on something of physical value instead of spending it on bills and food.
---
You could re equip it 100% I'd bet my life on it. They might have removed that feature at a certain point or maybe you originally couldn't but I promise you at the point in time when I had that handle you could.
---
My man. Thank you for this. This is all awesome info. I just got everything to 100%. Will go into that woodcutting guild now. Thanks!

why should they never be in the game?

Monks of Entrana are Catholic confirmed
---
I only do GG for pet. As soon as I get put I'm going back to regular gargs which are somehow more GP/h than the boss
---
Really the only thing i agree with here is the loot table could use a bit of a buff. The boss has mechanics but nothing is particularly involved or punishing. You're not in any real danger of dying other then the last phase of dusk with the flame wall, and that's pretty easy to handle.
---
Thanks, got excited about nothing.....
---
Voting no because weebs are the worst
---
Why do people still pk abyss runners? It's in such low wilderness that the chances of actually coming across someone you can actually attack is slim. Just seems like a waste of time for the off chance you might kill someone who never deposited their runes.
---
Sounds like you bought an account and had the ‚Äúhacker‚Äù claim it back which is quite a common occurrence for bought accounts.  
---
Then trying in your comments to blame jagex staff as the hacker is just piss poor form. 
---
I‚Äôm glad people like you will be no longer playing our game.
---
I see, cheers!
---
Its a bit ironic to see a comment like this coming from someone who is commenting on a discussion forum about "a java-based point-and-click game from the late 90s"
---
Damn I wish we were all as cool as you and didn't care about this silly 90s game, wow what a role model, a round of applause for you.
---
Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, not something you say when someone is simply talking shit about someone in general.
---
Got mine at 63.8m. I farmed everything I could. Just keep farming
---
I always thought it'd be cool to have the exact same drop table as vorkath. Its longer and harder of a fight so theres no extra money coming into the game but at least theres some reward to fighting him.
---
No I did not, why would the email be my name if I had bought an account? I started from tutorial island with that account...

What? I just like cute noobs lol. People nowadays are too efficiency driven, so its a breath of fresh air to see newbies who just enjoy the game and don't take it too seriously. And whats truly sad is how insecure people are that they get offended by simple pictures of noobs, and have the audacity to write a rude comment for no apparent reason.
---
" because they make all sorts of very difficult builds / low combat stat achievements a lot more doable and remove their prestige. "
---
such as?
---
 "you also should get rewarded for not being a fuckup and getting 2 def"
---
this is sort of understandable but voting no because you don't want some kid who got 2 def to be able to fix his mistake because you're 1 defence and not a fuck up is pretty petty.
---
I actually literally have proof that I have had the account since tutorial island, I have streams from  back when I was on the island......
---
I doubt support would ever reply to someone.

Amylase crystals and lava scale shards are stackable

Nice

You literally don't think long enough to realize if this game falls under thanks to bots/gold farmers Jagex employees are out of their jobs and thus can't feed their families. Yeah its fucking immoral, and sure if I had to i'd do some immoral shit to feed my family but you think its perfectly fine along with these other morons.
---
Big oof. I'm still enjoying farming enough to keep grinding for it. Farming contracts make things a bit more enjoyable too.
---
Do you want a screenshot of their reply? I still have the email.

I was getting like 150k points per hour. Probably because I used only bosses who gives more xp.

Yea theres someine in game with that.

seems to be a trend a lot of hate but no actual valid criticism of the update.

What? That is exactly what was polled to the players.
---

Yeah, you can do it before a fight but not in a fight.

Or perhaps they're on food stamps because they waste money on iphones, if i were to hazard a guess.
---
I'm talking about buying things you dont "need", you might need a phone, but you certainly dont need a new iphone every year. 
---
Lending items in runescape makes sense if you want to borrow something that has a purpose, such as borrowing a SGS for slayer e.g. Paying a mill for a paper hat so that you can pretend to have money you do not have, however, is beyond stupid. But hey, if thats what makes you feel good, thats nice for you, but calling it badass is still idiotic.
---
Didn't ask

I'm currently in Seattle about 20 minutes from downtown on vacation! I'm from Florida and will be lucky to miss being there during hurricane but work in law enforcement so will have to work hard when I return lol.

It does, full graceful makes you run 1 tick faster /s
---
It's a reference to an old LMS bug, not the new one. Unless they also banned the guy after accidentally deleting his inventory
---
Um... To some people, I don't think that's a threat
---
yeah like you cant bring defence lowering weapon with dhcb.....
---
not my problem you are a poor scrub....
---
Remove the stage where Dawn shoots the orbs.  It's ridiculous bosses have guaranteed damage as a mechanic let alone a "mid level' boss.
---
I recently downloaded osrs. How can i make it fullscreen like this one? I only have a small one like a square
---
Yeah.
---
that might fix it
---
I feel like some people are misinterpreting the point of this post, or maybe I am. Guardians, once you learn them, aren't hard to kill. They are just ridiculously time ineffecient- unless you have nearly max dps, you take a lot of unavoidable damage during a really long fight that itself takes a long time to get to. Killing them isn't super hard, it may be a lot to remember but once you have it down its not too bad. But then good luck getting more than 7-9 kills a trip, without advanced prayer flicking and relatively good focus. Then there's the matter of getting there. Even with agility shortcuts you still need to burn slayer rings or get an eternal gem to get back to them quickly. 
---
I actually think that, as the first "boss" (post fight caves) I  learned to do, they were a really good introduction to more involved mechanically driven fights. It's why I enjoy bossing and slayer so much, they are an actually fun and challenging way to enjoy the game. But little about the GG timr investment makes it worth it.
---
I propse either raise the slayer requirement of the guardians and add major buffs to the table, and properly bill them as the bigger more involved fight they are, or major overhauls to how the fight plays out, both mechanics and length wise

Your best weapon would be a magic short bow (I) with the best arrows you can get(rune probably)
---
doing winterdot at low go is easy firemaking, woodcutting, fletching, and construction xp.
---
Before magic shortbow, a rune crossbow with broad bolts(55 slayer) or bone crossbow(dorgshun quest line,is incredibly cheap to use and is pretty good) 
---
Obviously getting some combat levels before slayer will make it easier(to stop getting rubbish tasks) konar is pretty good on an Ironman.
---
Good food to get is either karambwans or monkfish( tai bwanai trio and swan song respectively) are good ways to get some good food early on. Later fishing minnows for sharks and anglerfish.
---
Obviously doing herb runs is good for herblore xp,at miscelania full herb is good then  you probably want to do maples for fletching, hard wood for construction, and mining coal for smithing.
---
Getting some early cash is done by thieving or agility(at the pyramid) you will also want to get graceful early as you cant get stamina‚Äôs
---
I farm calquats, fruit trees (all have the same rate), mushrooms, cactus, hardwoods (both same rate), spirits whenever I have them, seaweeds(2 patches ofcourse), hespori and belladonna.
---
I use something called RuneLite which is a 3rd party client for it. It's completely fine to use, you're not breaking any rules with. Pretty sure Jagex works with them in some capacity. However, on the regular client I'm sure there is a resizable option in the settings. "fixed mode" should be turned off if that's the case. Good luck!
---
Mechanically I think this boss is fine, phase animations take a bit long sure but they're not crippling. 
---
The crippling thing is the drops. I can kill a couple regular gargoyles in a couple of minutes and make more in drops than I get spending 5-10 minutes on this boss which also eats up supplies such as food and pray pots making the drops even more worthless
---
Lol

I overheard someone on the bus saying they worked for Rockstar, that GTA 6 is gonna have a narcos feel to it and will be set in somewhere based on Rio de Janeiro. Could be bullshit, but I know a Rockstar office where they did a lot of the work for GTA5 is based in my city because I used to work on the floor below it. When GTA5 launched they had a big launch event there with all cars and girls and shit.

Dont worry we will see him when he stopped renewing his wow classic membership
---
The problem with the rock attacks that stun you are is that they are unintuitive. They appear exactly the same as the superior gargoyles attack but the mechanics for them are different (they don't go where you were when the attack started, it's random). Being stunned by a random, unavoidable (well it's avoidable, you just need to be lucky...) projectile is just poor design when it appears to anyone trying the boss for the first time to be identical to another attack when in fact it isn't.
---
"And now we... Where are my teleports?"
---
&gt; quests are mostly designed in a way that you need help to complete them
---
If you meant bosses instead of quests this is true, but all quests (aside from ones specifically marked as 3-5 player quests) are designed to be done solo.
---
&gt; It is really an experience about the world arround you, than the journey of your character.
---
The nice thing about World of Warcraft is exploring the world, but that doesn't mean that your character going from a little bitch, to literally killing an old god with 39 of your best bros.
---
Wow, now I really wish we could equip a hammer. It would be nice to have the extra inventory space for construction, and possibly birdhouses and questing.
---
Yeah, they were intentionally designed as bad fletching exp. Basically only used for the dhide shields. Maybe if you finished it, it'd be worth more?

For those that dont know this weapon balmung was pre eoc ... yea yea pre eoc =pre trash but with the new quest having to do with dagganoths and such this weapon had extra bonus on them.
---
slayer bosses should be doable off task, that's the first problem, not oldschool at all
---
keep this a sandbox, slayer's incentive is +15% eficiency boost on xp and profits /H, and should stay that way
---
for uniques to hold atractive prices they just have to stop with the fucking trash drop tables where most profits come from alchables/resources
---
if they main incentive is not the unique, the "production" of uniques is an accident and not the main objective, so there's nothing self-regulating its price, it will just drop to shit and won't make the boss worth doing unless resource/alchables are good enough by themselves
---
this doesn't happen with gwd tables after a decade

Probably takes a while to implement and test. Doesn't give them any right not to provide updates though.

Ah yeah. Took me a long time to grind it together, but i'll manage again. Teaches me a valuable lesson about interacting with scammers. But what worries me is 10 minutes after i was scammed and back at the GE i instantly got approached again by someone else with the same scam... Like how many people try this and get away with it?
---
Has to be careful full sending it on carpet lol
---
I agree with a few of these, I don‚Äôt find the boss that difficult, the balls of stone and falling rocks are a pain but only because I personally don‚Äôt bother to dodge them. The lightening is easy to deal with. Their HP drops pretty quickly, I‚Äôd fix the dumbass fire thing where Dusk occasionally drops you as far as possible and you have to click the one tile, it‚Äôs aids as fuck catches me off guard a lot (but then I should just git gud at that I guess). I‚Äôd like to see a buff in the drop table, but no too big as it will be impossible to kill because it pups be overrun. I‚Äôm purely doing it for the pet, not gp/hr or xp/hr because it‚Äôs better killing normal gargs for both. The pet is cool as fuck that‚Äôs why I grind this boss out.
---
I'm voting yes for a lot of the suggestions. Theres just a few i don't quite like, with the elder maul being one of those. I don't mind the imbue scrolls. Imbuing your rings from a fun minigame rather than an afk one sounds great. I like the sounds of the teleport, though i think its location needs some improving. Right now it literally just looks like "quickly and constantly gank Callisto safespots" teleport. As i've said i like Thammaron's set etc.
---
And heck i'm not even against the idea of buffing the maul. I just think if we want to buff it, lets buff it. Not make a reward from a minigame a buff. Makes buying the item involve also buying the upgrade scroll for the item. It just feels weird.
---
Absolutely needs a buff of some sort, it's so mindless waiting between phases, it's just wasting time watching them go through animations

Some skills really are worth investing... well mainly construction. If you‚Äôre focused on doing combat, pools and teleports in a POH are really useful, convenient and can increase gp /hr

That‚Äôs amazing that you have spent your 139 days straight playing time on this boss, your awareness and vast knowledge must be amazing.

It hasn‚Äôt been addressed at all, that‚Äôs why it keeps getting to the top of the qna questions. They keep dodging it.

Would be nice! I've heard some people talk about using a DWH for smithing

GG is the most complicated boss, apart from raids. All GWD bosses are easier to do (just require gear and cmb stats), zulrah is easier, Vork is MUCH easier and MUCH better gp/hr. There's no reason for GGs to be this hard at the moment.

TOB W416 has some of the most disgusting players in the game. They tend to be extremely fragile (leaving after 1 death or when they don't get their prefered role at nylo) and being extremely racist and aggressive.

\- **HCIM** (Fun at first, but i quickly realize there are a lot of things i cannot do simply for the fact i don't wanna risk dying, so i probably won't be getting a lot of end game gears..... maybe would be different if this were a regular IM)

Sir, I must ask, what is wrong with you?

at least he'll get some decent cuckoldry xp, i hear he's not far off 200m
---
Nah, at least the engine dev position is very hard to fill. They wouldn't get rid of their most experienced dev unless he wanted to leave himself.
---
We try, being efficient is nice and all but it makes the game boring. Much rather do all I can as fun as I can.
---
The thing with a rs dev though, is that their engine is not compatible anywhere else. It has no real transferable skill to another company.
---
Also you realize that pen ink starts fading after 5 years of so right? Notice how there is 0 fading at all. You can see how fresh the ink is.

For the ones just wanting to laugh;

HAHAHA
---
2.8k GGs kc chiming in:
---
&gt; Why do they have 900 combined hp? They're a "mid-level" slayer boss, unlocked at 75 slayer. Thermy has 240 hp, at 93 slayer.
---
Because they have rather low offenses/defenses. I agree that their HP should be slightly lower, perhaps 300-350 each for a total of 600-700 in accord to their slayer req. Thermy is a whole different story though. He probably the worst designed slayer boss of them all.
---
&gt; Why do they both hit through prayer?
---
Because they are slayer bosses. Ever other one bar Hydra hits through prayer or protect prays have no effect at all. At hydra you need to swap prays constantly to make up for that.
---
&gt; Why does Dawn shoot fastball stunning rocks that you can't dodge if they get yeeted right at you?
---
Completely agree, the fact that those stun spheres have completely different missile speeds without any indication where they land makes it really hard to dodge them, even when you are standing further away. **Proposal: Fixed speed+shadow on the ground to indicate their drop location**
---
&gt; Why does Dusk drop rocks from the ceiling that you can't dodge if you happen to get the really fast one right where you're standing?
---
Refer to the previous question **Make them a fixed speed**
---
&gt; Why do the lightning things deal 8 damage per tick and why isn't it possible to consistently never touch them, unless you use one of the cheat clients?
---
The damage is fine imo **if you stand directly on top of them. They should not deal damage to squares next to them**
---
&gt; Why do the lightning things deal damage when they are no longer lightning?
---
Completely agree, they tick 1 or 2 ticks after they disappear. This needs to be fixed.
---
&gt; Why does Dusk need to randomly hit with melee/range on the last phase? At least Hydra alternates, so that you can predict what to pray.
---
This mechanic needs to be here, for maxed players not to stay there indefinitely. Personally I do ~40 kill/1:30-2h trips most of the time after which the limiting factor is prayer almost all of the time and I have to leave some food on the ground. I take around 90% of the damage I take on the last phase.
---
&gt; Why are the drops like 50k for a boss that has 900 hp and takes ages to kill with these various annoying mechanics that you all need to dodge or you take heaps of damage?
---
This would be fine if kills were faster (less downtime between phases+slightly less HP) This needs addressing, rather than their drop table, which is fine considering the rather low req of only 75 slay.
---
My proposed fixes on top of those QOL stuff mentioned ealier in bold:
---
1) The main phase that acts as a low level deterrent is the Orb phase. Without a sufficient level to skip the mechanic rather consistently, it is just not efficient enough to do the boss.
---
**The orbs should not deal damage when deactivated. You interact with mechanics to avoid damage, not to take damage. On top of that, rather than healing Dawn, I would rather have them give a buff (damage/accuracy) to Dawn in the last phase if not deactivated. That way the player can decide between an easier last phase (better for low levels) or to take more damage with a slightly faster kill time by avoiding the orbs (high level).***
---
With that change on top of lowering their HP slightly on top of the the downtime between phases, as well as the orb/rock QOL, the kill time should come down to around 1:30 (maxed player avoiding orbs w/o scythe) and they should be much more enjoyable to kill.
---
After the LMS update, boosted stats remained. So people were able to complete quests (like desert treasure with 1 prayer) or do diaries without having any requirement.
---
I have rigour. I‚Äôm using sharks and doing all that. I get hit so hard when he uses his magic ability since I pray range.
---
I have a "lucky" world where i get all my lucky drops.  
---
Whenever i want a drop, i farm in that world... this inadvertently means i don't give other worlds a chance to drop rares and i keep believing in my lucky world.

Why should the game no be a carrot on a stick? Is there a reason because the same could be said that if that‚Äôs not what your looking for then maybe a different game would be for you.  And reason is everything my guy people love to try and perfect things and fill things out and collect things! That‚Äôs a reason I love osrs is to have such a huge grind to collect things!  But try and have a better view! Why not have a pet grind? Is there a reason, you just shot him down and your only reason was he shouldn‚Äôt need to have a reason. And let me tell ya osrs is not really a game for fun gameplay ... ya gotsta have REASON... gives ya goals and good stuff fam!
---
The wiki has gone on record saying they put their profits on the low end of what is possible to make it low level friendly. But truthfully we are both making null points as you can follow that link, click on money making guides underneath the title, scroll down and it says GG's are 800k an hour which is probably what most people make counting GG's aren't really that hard to optimise and is where i got my numbers from. Also that page is for regular gargoyles...

---
We need need to have a game for everyfreaking thing. 
---
It‚Äôs a game we don‚Äôt need reason to play, they made it because they could.
---
A large part of it is technique, such as knowing when to step away, timing switches, interface flicking etc. which will come with experience and time. 
---
Personally, I'd leave them until mid-80 combat stats, unless you enjoy them (I think they're one of the most fun slayer tasks).
---
Noon @ 183 KC. Haven't touched them since.
---
2 hours maybe. Wish I had more time though
---
I‚Äôm similar stats to you and just completed a task myself. A big difference I noticed was using piety and eagle eye when attacking to speed up kills, which in turn meant I received less damage per gorilla. This and focussing on switching protection prayers at the right time were a big factor in number of kills a trip. In the end I was getting around 10 kills a trip but I could have improved on the prayer switches

I've never played wow only rs, I jumped on classic too see what all the fuss was about and all I can say is spend 16.50 Aud on 1 month and give it it a go you'll either love it or hate it all for as much as a fast food lunch
---
If you start ironman, you will soon notice that slayer, implings and wintertodt are your main sources of skilling supplies. And you wont be making your own armours or weapons, smithing, crafting and fletching requirements for those are way too high, instead you will grind out monsters and clues hoping you get the desired items.

Bruh this comment should have lile 50 upvotes.. in the past month alone ive had to explain several times about how replaceable bots in f2p and easy access p2p content (mobile trial). Bots make bots. And once you nail a script or coding style the scripts just change.
---
I feel a big focus on f2p bots from jagex would really help player retention.
---
Dude. Delete this picture of me man. I didn‚Äôt give you permission to post this.
---
I mean it makes your run go down slower cos lower weight
---
I lost my ultimate iron man status to not wearing warm clothing in wintertodt. That's what I get for not watching a tutorial I guess.
---
Because OSRS bossing relies on Jads, and Jad-clones
---
Switch prayers quickly, run through safe tiles thanks to bot clients, and get one-banged if you miss a prayer switch. The pinnacle of OSRS bossing.
---
Thank fuck there is RS3 with its superior combat system for non-retards.
---
Please explain?
---
Not really sure how hard it would to implement from the coding side of things, would have to ask god ash or someone. But if it's not an overly daunting task I really can't see why it shouldn't be implemented for those players who would like it as it doesn't really have many negative impacts.
---
I think they could easily fix it if the unlock from Slayer was instead to get two loot drops. Give two xp drops from the start and have each kill drop loot. 
---
With them having so much hp and being so tedious to do I think it's a fair compromise. If the gp per hour became too high from this they could reduce drops slightly or even make it so that the last kill is the only of the two that drops dust for cannonballs
---
I think sockeyes would be pretty cool, similar color scheme to the Whalers (I live in Hartford, CT). Freeze is cool but definitely sounds like an AHL team.
---
He said PVM dead my dude
---
Yeah my ideal build will be base 70 skills, 99 mage/range/str/HP/slayer 77 prayer, 75 def/att 83 con (max poh), quest cape. I maxed on rs3 in 1400 hours so want to do my exact build in under that time then ill class my account as complete and can enjoy pvm/pvp
---
I was just messing, Vorkath is about the most non AFK boss going. Turn your head once and you're smashed a 90.
---
When people walk under you just spam click them.
---
I'm frozen usually tho.
---
Is fun not enough of an incentive?
---
?
---
No.
---
You'll go to jail
---
Unless you're going for the pet there is zero reason to kill the boss.
---
You could try a click intensive method such as tele-alching. 
---
At your level you could also do something similar to stun-alching. You can't cast Stun yet but you can use Vulnerability, and it'll be pretty cheap assuming you can afford a mud staff+tome of fire. (you can always sell these back afterwards). The only costs you'll have are soul and nature runes, and whatever item you're alching. Click intense but it'd be really fast
---
Different servers I imagine. At least it proves it's not my end having issues.
---
It is legal
---
Iphone is an expensive brand. I already pointed out that you might need a phone, but that you dont need to buy an insanely overpriced phone, and then replace it every year.
---
Reading helps, Einstein.
---
I know just spam click them and you will trade 1 hit
---
Have these achievements gained from the boosted stats been removed as part of the rollback?
---
I don't agree.  The art has same-face syndrome, perspective is non-existent, depth in their most recent piece is non-existent, and shading has barely changed since they started.
---
My issue with that is he only posts his art.  He doesn't even make an effort to participate in the community conversation outside of his own work.
---
Elder Maul is basically a watered down copy of chaotic maul. They just nerfed it and ran it through the bad graphics machine like most other things ingame
---
Why wouldn't it be?
---
Would you still recommend building an account around the gmaul, even after the 60% spec nerf?
---
i dont know what a kuriboh is but i suspect the name checks out
---
because of the los changes duh
---
Mix in something else every few trips and it's really not that bad.  Do a farm run, get 10kc at vorkath, bankstand a skill for 20 minutes, etc
---
World 420
---
I f2p pked years back, and there would be literally 100 loot bots with the exact same name, just different number at the end walking around picking up the stray addy arrows on the ground. They often were running on the same script, so often they would walk around in huge waves, trying to pick up that 1 addy arrow that spawned, and stand on that square, and wait for the next one. It was crazy, there were more bots than pkers back then
---
They literally already did and it failed miserably
---
Everything in RuneScape is legal (except scamming items in some countries)
---
I would pay huge money for Balmung back. Dks are my favorite
---
Correct.
---
Not to mention how old zulrah is and the fact that blowpipes almost never leave the game.
---
That's almost 600gp you wasted, could've taken that to the Sand Casino and made billions with it, smh my head...
---
Fletching is a pretty reasonable place to start the account. Get access to the wc guild. You'll be able to cut magic trees eventually, and you'll be able to Fletch rune crossbows and msbs. You'll also make some money once you can high alch the products.
---
Just do ardy knights fam, blackjacking is cancer
---
How does that logic apply to your crystal shield analogy, when crystal items degrade and blowpipe does not? That's part of the reason why crystal items are cheaper.
---
And yes, you're correct. I don't understand what justifies the item prices, which is why I asked this question in the first place. But thanks for putting me in my place I guess lol
---
RuneScape is already bangable, luckily enough! Have at it.
---
I mean if they just had +1 mage defence noone would use them in f2p unless they were 500gp. No monsters worth fighting mage and noone mages in PvP except in fire strike throwaway pures in multi.
---
Only acceptable answer
---
Pre-eoc I never had an account like this. I've played since 2006 when it was a miniclip game :)
---
It's in beta, aka not in the main servers yet
---
Siiiick loot!
---
Since this made to the front page might as well put my qa thread copypasta for discussion:
---
*P1  
---
The freezing attack, remove or rework it to make it predictable (like Vorkath‚Äôs fireball). This is the 1 out of 3 stun attacks this boss has and is 1 out of the 2 random ones.  
---
*P1-&gt;P2 transition  
---
This transition happens twice on the fight, its repetitive, too random and deals more damage than Cerberus lava pools. Remove this transition completely, rework it to make it less random (such as the flame attacks tracking you like Hydra), make them damage once every 2 ticks, reduce aoe from 3x3 to 1x1 and make them stop dealing damage 1 tick earlier.  
---
*P2  
---
The first stun attack is fine and unique, I like it. The second one is random and is not tied to the boss attack cycle (as In, let‚Äôs say, it bashes the floor and then the rocks fall and wont attack the player until after the attack ends). Either rework or remove the falling rocks attack (maybe tie them into the boss‚Äô attack cycle and remove the standard melee attack, making it a movement-based phase)  
---
*P2-&gt;P3    
---
Same issues as the first transition since they‚Äôre same exact thing but with more random aoe   
---
*P3    
---
The random freeze returns and the healing orbs also follow a random pattern. Alongside that, add fixed locations for the orbs to spawn so that the fight is more about planned movement rather than randomness (Just like Hydra and the vents)
---
The image shows Dawn‚Äôs spawn in P3 and the recommended locations for the orbs   
---
https://imgur.com/5SfCg7d  
---
*P4  
---
It‚Äôs the best phase as-is. Doesn‚Äôt need any changes to make it smoother or more engaging. If any, allowing the boss to be attacked earlier after it uses the first flame wall attack since it can‚Äôt be hurt with anything that isn‚Äôt melee.
---
Never played yu-gi-oh?
---
I had a steel dragon task from her, and it was talking for*ever". Eventually I looked down and noticed that the task was in Brim, and I was in the catacombs.
---
The rewards sucked tho. They should add decent rewards just like they‚Äôre doing with LMS
---
Powermining iron
---
Yes.
---
Boosted WC will theoretically cut logs faster than non-boosted wc at any level, resulting in more xp/h (tho the xp per cut will be the same). In areas like Wintertodt where XP is based on level, then it goes off the boosted level so you'll get more XP per action.
---
same location, same issue. makes bursting 100x times more annoying. havent found a solution yet
---
Ninja if you want to do the agility course, and Zombie if you need to create Zenytes.
---
Jus lol
---
Make a pure ironman maybe.
---
I think they're changing it so it's for PvP only so it won't interfere with any high tier PvM (like the Inferno).
---
This right here.
---
Thank you!
---
I got one in NMZ the other day and looked it up. Anything that drops big bones can drop long and curved bones. Since the ToB mob is a dark beast and dark beasts drop big bones this can happen.
---
Yep. And if you complain the response from people is ‚Äúhurr durr don‚Äôt go in the wilderness if you don‚Äôt want to get pked‚Äù
---
Good for you?
---
Powermining iron for top xp/h.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
MLM for AFK.
---
No, it applies to LMS only.
---
Because it only affects players in PvP situations and explicitly said it won't affect pvm duh?
---
I like the mechanics. You can avoid almost all dmg except the last phase random attacks.
---
Prayer, if you have the money, I'd do RC.
---
Alright! Good luck, feel free to add me "TwoPints" ingame
---
scuse me, neitiznot
---
&gt; them from the pipe i
---
Yup, im calling BS on this
---
That hasn't come into effect yet. I don't think it will. I doubt they will put it through as an integrity change but I can't say for sure. If that nerf does come in, gmaul pures definitely won't be as worth. Although when they proposed that it was proposed alongside an item which could upgrade the gmaul to give it 50% again. So you could still have a gmaul pure, just you would need to spend the money on an upgraded gmaul, it would have to be your +1 from protect item if you don't want to risk too much.
---
I would still reccomend a gmaul pure because like i said above, it could still work after the change, with 25+ prayer. But the thing is, with a gmaul pure, you can decide to go for 60 or 75 attack whenever you want, but if you start with 60 or 75, you can't go back to 50 of course.
---
The dude has worked there for 15 years!
---
Most people move on from their job after 2-3 to further climb the ladder. He's done his fair share of time at Jagex.
---
Oh no someone prove that I shouldn't copy the reddit give mind, whatever could I say to him?!?
---
It doesn't have to be in your bank, you can put it in the STASH unit.
---
EVO!
---
This is the definition of 'weird flex but ok'
---
it didn't even happen to you lol
---
'your loot is worth approximately 3k.'
---
Have you thought about maybe seeing a therapist?
---
got cheap thing but wanted expensive thing
---
Yeah true, but if you're not trying to get it to pay for itself, you can save money. If you buy it for 10m and sell it for 10m once you hit 99, you'd save ~2.7m. I'm not trying to say it super useful, but I think it is more useful than OP is implying
---
I really hope he wasn't leaving because of his salary
---
Fuck he was the guy that got most of the mobile stuff working as was supposed to be helping with resizeable interfaces and gpu rendering on desktop.
---
Same happened but I saw a white dot at the corner of the bank and my lure panic sense came up so I did not accept the trade. A clanmate fell for this but lost nothing because he only had a twisted bow on him.
---
I mean he probably didn't expect ian gower to leave and mobile to take such high priority all of a sudden.
---
That kind of helps prove my point, why does a game from 07 present the same computing load as a correctly optimized modern game
---
Blood runs deep was one of the best quests the Jagex team ever put out. Up there with WGS and ROTM. It was cinematic, felt like an actual adventure, and the lore was incredible. Getting deeper into the dagannoth back story and seeing the fremennik afterlife was awesome. We even got fuckint married. And it rewarded you with an incredible new weapon, niche for just DKs.  I didnt understand why they shoehorned in the death of your wife/husband but maybe we can get around that if we come to it in osrs. Please u/mod_wolf if your gunna dive into the fremennik story more, consider bringing back that amazing quest, or something similar in story.
---
Because its silly.
---
no because the players chose which version of runescape they wanted, and we decided we want the version that has the shitty engine from 2007 and refuse to improve on cuz "reee rs3".
---
anyways this is going to be a huge setback unless they decide to finally improve/change the engine the same way they did back in 08 which would also take a long ass time with such a small team.
---
? Is that supposed to be me? I don't think you read my post, did you?
---
&gt; The Rasteriser shown off 2 years ago boasted locked 50fps on "almost all platforms everywhere"
---
And yet, it's not out.
---
Press F for me i got one facing jad
---
Decent shotgun decent level decent lift
---
Sweet thanks
---
elysian ogre cock
---
World of Warcraft Classic for example, you get you're raid party lets say 5 people, each mob you kill gives a different party member loot. So I could kill 2x zombies for example but maybe only 1 of those gives me a drop, the other goes to a party member. When we kill a boss and get an uncommon or greater item it allows each member in the party to roll on the item ie highest roll gets the item.  
---
Those drops in WoW are different from Runescape as most of the gear you're looking for CANT be traded after you've equipped it, or given to anyone else outside the party that gotten the item. Runescape is heavily focused on Gold for Items, in WoW you also have this but most if not all of your gear is gonna be untradable and only obtainable by running the same raids over and over till you get a good roll.  
---
Not to say you can't buy gear in WoW it's just not as common as Runescape. I probs explained that shittily but I hope it helps.
---
Half way done maxing nice
---
I once played RS on ketamine and got lost in the Al Kharid rooftop course.
---
after 77, which is like 7/8ths of the xp to 99 (admittedly only 1% of the pain)
---
Global warming smh
---
Only in the woodcutting guild
---
Honestly tho mad respect for doing this as your first 99, you wont have any money problems for the rest of your skills and look at that mining and crafting
---
Woohoo! :)
---
but that might require effort.. and you know.. coding? they shouldn't have to actually do their job.. to get paid? what kind of backwards world is this where someone should do something to get paid? in 2019?
---
 They said after mobile release they would be focusing on that, and put the rasteriser on the "back log". Seeing as Atlas was the key engine dev showing this off, it's looking like we wont for longer still
---
Good for him, being a principal is usually a title that only happens if you rise internally. Sucks for the game but no one person is more important than the company.
---
And Kruk if you want to do maniacal monkeys.
---
You make a nice profit just farming; I don't think it's necessary to add anything to the drop table
---
that literally happens everywhere, your boss tells you to work one something and then things change and decides something else is more important, you're telling me we should be mad at him? really? you're going to tell me that you never told anyone you're going to do something and shit happens that forced you to not finish it on time? you guys are too fucking entitled.
---
Not the only one! I also haven't DC'ed yet \*knocks on wood\*. But that may be because some people play on servers far way from their location. I am from The Netherlands so I only play on german/UK servers.
---
wtf are divine pots lol
---
Are prices dropping again? And is it due to Lms update? I just can‚Äôt seem to believe that lms could impact the market
---
wiping is xp waste
---
Im going to go out on a limb and say that the map you have is some fan made bullshit. It looks like they just. Opy pasted some images together and took parts of the gta 5 map to do it. They even threw in gta 4 in the middle right.
---
ah interesting call. so just stick with ddef mostly?
---
How is that entitlement?
---
If I told you I could make a car that can fly, and then don't, you would rightfully be mad at me for promising you something I couldn't deliver.
---
Are you both in town for PAX then?
---
Petiton to change "Needs engine work" to "Needs Mod Atlas".
---
Yeah, I remember the post a few weeks ago taking about how they were only using magic. Only mage can‚Äôt be more than like 10-15 kills an hour. Still, 10 bots at a time would still be super profitable
---
yeah, no need to bug fix or anything else. just ship it.
---
also Google want really so much a thing back then...
---
Joker
---
Sometimes you just have to be bad to start being good. Its gonna take time for some people to learn, the main focus should just be keeping LMS alive as long as possible so people have a free chance (minus buy in if they choose) to keep practicing.
---
evolution of combat i guess.
---
You're asking an impossible question to answer and you know it.
---
Theoretically someone can do the Inferno first try.  Having or not having a tbow doesn't matter at all.  I just watched someone do the inferno the other day with an ACB and a blowpipe.   I think he just wore Armadyl armor as well.  
---
What it really comes down to is knowing what to do/where to stand/patterns, etc. The mechanical skill is the important part.  The tbow just affords you the convenience of a faster fight, you still have to know all the same mechanics.
---
Thanks. I appreciate your perspective
---
It is 3m now fyi, might be what OP is referring to
---
Beautiful.
---
They're really nice. I just finished MM2 and got salve (ei) and 82 con on mine this week, so I've been using it for Vork as well. How close are you to finishing yours?
---
this can never happen unless the weapon is Banned in PVP. It would be like having a permanent ags spec you could constantly 1tick from a  msb
---
In many ways, I would rather my colleagues see all the porn on my phone rather than a pixel gnome chained to a board haha 
---
The porn seems less weird in many ways haha
---
Powermine iron with murgaa mouse and keyboard recorder, record 30 minutes and play it 2-3 hours a day.
---
Lol, I focused more on playing RS3 (same account), believe me I have sunk thousands of hours into these games since I first started in 2001.
---
While these gloves lack a¬†Defencerequirement, they cannot be acquired at 1 Defence due to the levels required to complete and experience gained from completing the necessary quests to complete Recipe for Disaster. The minimum Defence level a player can have to acquire these gloves is 41 when all quest requirements and xp rewards are calculated.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows_gloves
---
Is making pots profitable at all?
---
Or what about an effect like turmoil? Take your first attack at 1/2 damage to "charge" or "Activate" the weapon to hit normally. Makes it impossible to hit real high after a fury of dragon knives.
---
What gan you do with the points?
---
And, does "broken" in PVP matter anymore when a lvl 78 gmaul pure hits over 150 dmg?
---
This may be what you're looking for https://youtu.be/Vs9KZ1QMRSE

While it can happen on your end, this happens on jagex's end often. Wouldn't matter if you had the best internet.
---
Song of the elves art style definitely does not fit osrs
---
Yes that's a use, but I think that's a poor excuse to keep it in the minigame.
---
I‚Äôd say about 2 weeks away, got fire cape and I‚Äôm 2 quests away from barrows gloves, got 83 cons, I haven‚Äôt gone mm2 yet it‚Äôs just an extra drop but I‚Äôll see how I feel when I‚Äôm closer, and I want to get base 85, I‚Äôm base 75 atm
---
üòê
---
That's some nice info. Further points to it being the result of supply and demand
---
If you do a ton of raids Rigour is ABSOLUTELY better than DHCB. The only place you use DHCB in raids over blowpipe is at olm (other places like vespula and shamans you can use a dragon crossbow if you need to). 
---
In fairly welfare gear (with rigour and anguish) addy darts in a blow pipe is 10.51 dps on Olm. Rune darts are 10.90. DHCB with dragon ruby bolts are 10.83. But if you can only have a DHCB and no rigour that goes down to 10.23. 
---
That‚Äôs means rigour with addy darts is easily better than dhcb with eagle eye. The only time dhcb is better than bp is when you lose bp hits on olm, and with practice that happens very rarely.
---
in order to not be absolute trash the second hit would have to be hitting 80+'s still. Would still be ridiculously broken in pvp cause you could be literally 1 shot by vengeance at any time so would never pass a poll
---
Dragon warhammer and rigour are pretty steep reqs
---
We, 2.147k platinum tokens. 2.147m plat is max cash.

How exactly are blood runes AFKable? o.0
---
Such a good game!
---
Buy touver parchment worth about 2.5m
---
Damn that's so weird lol, my bad for assuming. Just gonna go ahead and leave it as a 3rd party client-only bug
---
a spec you can pull of once with an inaccurate weapon thats only worth specing like that against low defence v constant ags specs with no cooldown. A slow weapon but viable dps can never exist without some sort of jankey scythe/tbow effect while pvp exists in the game, thats just reality
---
Yea that seems to be the one missed. Someone in the original thread mentioned that as well.
---
nono i seent it too,   then i click off the link and tell my dad about it but he no look. but maybe that still count as view since i told him about it atleast.
---
Buy land on the other side of the highway and make a sweet coaster. Should really up the traffic to your house!
---
Oh trust me, rot feeds all the other clans by suiciding and donating their torag sets for 5-6 hours. Even if they have only 1/4 of their opponent. RoT just want to say ‚Äòwe won‚Äô, but for them it is outlasting. 
---
Next to that, their 2k total world pvmers donate an average of 200m a day combined to the pk group that hunts them there.
---
Found the botter
---
Would got a Cammy tele to be honest
---
Song off the elves was fun to do this way but took me all day. And I looked up boss strats after getting my ass kicked.
---
Not sure which ones are better, I was only 87 deffence on the account so I wanted the extre deffence b gloves provide that was the logic I went with.
---
For a start...
---
-Make the stun rock speed consistent
---
-Lower the hp and make them attackable during the lightning phase
---
-Add Gmaul upgrade to their droptable, make the dust tradeable
---
-Change the phase switch animation from walking to a teleport
---
&gt;less than 1k
---
&gt;dry
---
Oooo, I love the idea of this tattoo
---
Yep I work in QA and can confirm that stuff like this is the first tests you right. Basically any way you can enter a scenario and exit a scenario need to be tested, and you should make sure all initial/final conditions are what is expected. 
---
This is pretty basic. Were the boosts visible or invisible? If they were invisible I could see it a bit easier. Someone just checked the stats screen each time.
---
His cash stack is so much higher than yours mate, get on that bossing grind with your new 99.
---
Shhhhhh
---
We don‚Äôt do that here
---
ah fair enough, depending on the gear it might not even give you an extra gear so tbf barrows gloves are good even if just for the defence at that level.
---
I fucking love this tbh. So many games point right where you go and you just do the thing. Runescape has so much adventure because not only are the quests so much better than just go here and collect the thing and kill the bad guy, but you actually have to figure it out through context clues which are 9 times out of 10 very well written and accessible with some thought.
---
S
---
The MEP2 quest guide doesn't update once between entering the temple of light and finishing it.
---
Let's look at something more reasonable since you wanna go deep into this. The Wiki GP/HR ratios are always vastly overstated because of the unique drop GP and how they divide by their drop rate. Ideally maybe you'd make that much gp/hr if you got uniques. The drop rate of their uniques is insanely high. If you're getting at least 20 at most 30 kills an hour you'll ideally see at least 1 unique being the Maul at 250 KC after about 8 hours of GGs. Take that into account for the biggest boost from the Wiki the core which adds 211k to the 813k/hr. You get that core 'every 1000 kills' or at least 33 hours of GGs. So in an ideal world you'll have made 813k/h only if you've done GGs for at least 33 hours. In an improbable lucky scenario you could make more. In a more realistic example you'll make much less than 813k/h at GGs.

"bro hop i was resetting my internet because my roommate's cat knocked over the router and spilled coffee all over it so i had to buy a new one i was here 3 days ago cmon"
---
AFAIK the WT crates roll when opened not when earned. Meaning you open a few to get starter cash and save the rest for higher level.
---
I think FM, WC, Herb, farm, and mining influence drops. Meaning there's no benefit to higher combat level.
---
I honestly think the bots are great, keep resources like cannonballs, zulrah scales all super cheap
---
Not bad status
---
As someone who did agility as my first 99, and rc second, I'm incredibly proud of you! And please, for the love of god keepbit untrimmed! I accidentally trimmed mine, and I regret it every day

If you complete Song of the Elves then you can add the crystal dust to potions for profit. Otherwise nope.
---
&gt;if you are bursting/barraging offtask and use a Tormented Bracelet, everything in this graphic still holds perfectly true.

[Not exactly.](https://i.imgur.com/fJFWaap.png) Off task with tormented is an extremely small amount better using set 1 but it's negligible. Kodai is honestly super strong though, it's crazy.

Staff of the dead is a good alternative.

Add me! Jutanious

Mmmmmmmm mainly because the best way to get Cwars points is literally to not play the game. They'd need to rework the whole thing. I'm not against that but I don't think it would be played that much.

Dayum, I forgot my log slave only has a limited carry capacity. Good point!
---
But yeah it would be really nice to reduce the need to repeatedly say yes take my 5k :) though I do doubt it will be seen or updooted enough. So for now me and log boy keep having the same 3 bit conversation
---
How long did it take to get eternal glory?
---
Lol yeah I totally forgot I was on a pvp world, had a glory on me could‚Äôve teled but I panicked. I had to laugh, I agree we deserved it. Learning lesson.
---
Two things:
---
1. When are you getting smacked for a 30 while doing things properly?
---
2. Still easier than a lot of end game bosses which can easily stack you out from close to full HP
---
Higher stats make a much larger impact than the gear you use. Id sell ancestral hat and use the gp to burst and raise you magic level. It will make learning much easier.
---
&gt;banking redwood logs
---
lmao
---
How many you got in the bank to merch?
---
Lmao fuck off
---
You mean the items lost on death?
---
She assigned me Trolls at Troll Stronghold before having done the quest
---
I've only been developing professionally for nearly 20 years what do I know :)
---
Good observation sir, did you derive it from past self experiences ?
---
I did MEP2 guideless, and you don't really need the questlog for anything. The quest is, if nothing else, straightforward. The hardest part of the quest, for me, was being colorblind. For no less than 6-8 hours across two days, I thought certain terminals on the final pillar were completely different colors than they actually were. 
---
Once my non colorblind friend politely corrected me the final puzzle took me 5 minutes.
---
I'm completely fine with weapons being balanced for their tier by not having the exact bonuses, It's just the Staff of the Dead (being +25 and having all of the other things) and Kodai (being above +25 without having downsides in a +25 tier) Wand are a little bit more powerful than their tier is all; It's just harder to see with there not being other things in that tier before them. I can completely see why It might seem like I'm arguing about something arbitrary. I also know OSRS isn't RS3, I've picked up "tier" from the OSRS community tbh as it's a nice way to explain the strength of something without referring to it's level.
---
Think of it like a toxic staff that can autocast.  Now it's not so op, just a QOL/luxury item.
---
Damn i finished guthans at 134 and i thought i was lucky
---
WOW that‚Äôs what runelite does for MLM???! Absolute cheat.
---
I know this is a "RC is bad meme" but bloods is about as easy as it gets and gives you a solid amount of money to fund skilling moving forward. Before all the PvM changes and alt scape, getting 99 RC as one of your first 99s used to be the "meta". Back when double Nats was actually relevant anyway lol.
---
I used my main initially to provide safe passage, but there was never anyone there so I stopped doing it
---
If you drop your untrimmed cape, get your next 99, then telegrab it, it will stay untrimmed.
---
I found out what colour the static crystal on the top floor was after the quest was done. I even did the first 2 doors not knowing what exactly I needed to do.
---
Spent about an hour going across handholds to put the &gt;!Blue crystal!&lt; in the place after the handholds, realised my solution was wrong so reset it, and realised that part was fine. I felt a lot of pride and accomplishment when finished
---
Considering Zulrah was best moneymaker and released 2015 the amount of blowpipes in the game is huge. Only thing holding the price up is the scales you get from dismantling it.
---
Ooooooof that's some RNJizzle right there boi. It's taken me 3400kc to get where you are
---
So then bp / tbow / scythe / sanguine must really trigger you huh
---
Don't remind me of that please xd
---
Graceful lad had the high ground
---
Prayer, range, construction. Roughly in that order at max efficiency.
---
#GAY
---
I can live with that. Im like 7k away from 75 tho
---
I've gotten the team cape x and zero, still missing the cape of skulls and team cape i
---
fuck you beat me to it
---
Someone turn this into the tough guy spongone Bob meme cuz holy fuck what a chad
---
Most people who have replied to me in this thread have the average iq of 40 or less, you however managed to be the biggest dumbass of them all. Impressive.
---
And I already agreed with you on the above, but I thank you for writing it out and putting time into it. I don't mean that snarky, nor any of my above replies. Thanks!
---
I do recall this, and I do hope you noticed the sarcasm in my comment lol.
---
Wow that sucks... I‚Äôm not color blind but even I think they should put in a color blind mode or something. SOMEONE POLL THIS.
---
Can't blame you tbh, I've said I do it to too many people to stop now but I did boost mining for legends quest which took like 20 dwarven stouts to work out what to do
---
It's unfortunate that it's like that. Fishing was my trade skill back in 09, when I came back this year I decided to go the mining route and got quite disappointed when i found out drop mining iron was the best way to gain xp.
---
Yes, yes you are.
---
Good exp at bloods is around 38k/hour, at 23.8 exp/essence thats roughly 1600 bloods an hour. They're currently 340each so 544k, realistically 500k ish if you do it not super super focused.
---
lmao say goodbye to your acc
---
You make me feel better for using strength pots but using attack style for nearly a full trip of green drags.
---
Do you know how much the boost is? I've killed about 6k rdrags on my alt but I hated mm2 so if its not a decent amount more then there's no way im doing it
---
Still man. Do you not cannon your slayer tasks? Range is the most op combat skill and you can safespot most things on top of that.
---
About to train prayer from 52-70 using ensouled heads. Troll heads give 64 more exp per head than ogre heads at the cost of being .5gp/xp more expensive. Theoretically this translates to more xp/hr, but at my stats do you think I'll actually be able to take advantage of that, or would it be faster to stick with ogres? 
---
I'm going to be at 70atk, 66str, 65def using neitz, glory, fighter, d skirt, d boots, and a whip
---
dont forget the fury and DFH
---
Blowpipe should be removed, Tbow is special like Arclight but I do feel like it's a tad strong; I'd like it at Level 85, Scythe is fine it's a niche and can be very powerful but it's a passive, Sanguine is fine I personally feel; It could be +23 for being that kind of staff but for what it is I don't think that'd be a good thing for it so I think it's balanced well enough.
---
I do feel like being colourblind is a fair time to use a guide
---
If you have only one cape then it's untrimmed. If you get a second cape then all of your capes become trimmed, including the first cape. There's a trick where you can obtain a new skillcape without trimming your previous one. It's mostly a point of pride when someone has an untrimmed RC/Agility/Mining cape because these are pretty rare to have
---
Your first cape is automatically trimmed when you get a second 99. You have to use exploits (I believe dropping it then telegrabbing it after reaching 99 works) to keep it untrimmed to show as your first 99. I got thieving first, but I thought it looked bad untrimmed so I just went and got cooking just to trim it.
---
Send em back to goblin town
---
Take me hooooooooooomeeeeee
---
Recruitment drive is easier than it sounds, although the transgender part would've been a lot easier closer to the release date because of Lord of the Rings. The chemistry part has books that you can read to help you solve it.
---
I used a guide, but I had 20 agility :D
---
It took me 3 days
---
Checking in
---
Bye
---
You can
---
You can only ever have one untrimmed cape, your first 99. Every 99 after that it comes trimmed automatically. But everytime you're about to get another 99, you have to drop your untrimmed came and telegrab it afterwards. You also can't pick it up normally ever, even if not about to get another 99.
---
If you ever pick it up, without telegrabbing, it trims itself and you can't undo it. Untrimmed Slayer/RC are pretty cool capes in terms of "prestige" but it's all just fashionscape in the end.
---
This is true for low mage def monsters because magic damage is boosted by your lvl, the weapon and the occult.
---
There doesnt need to be a sink.
---
Dude fuck arceuus library holy shit
---
Pretty sure the Santa hat guy was Sal‚Äôs realm of Runescape
---
That was such a great site
---
I did, hence why I begun my statement by acknowledging that your comment was a meme haha.
---
So when someone robs a bank to feed their family there's absolutely nothing wrong with that because the bank will be just fine after?
---
I switched convenience store with a bank because banks are multi billion dollar companies(most of them atleast).
---
yoo shit, we have REALLY similiar stats!
---
ign is Wg GurtJun ,look me up
---
To be fair, Jagex has had actual double XP weekends in the past. That's why the scams are believable to some.
---
Fire cape, fighter torso, barrows gloves, imbue that ring, amulet of torture, and so on. Of course the first 4 don't necessarily require money, but they're big upgrades for you.
---
Otherwise, yeah, your next upgrade would be torture then prims.
---
There's nothing wrong with this...
---
Am I missing something? How is kodai wand more accurate according to your percentiles whilst full ancestral has WAY more magic attack bonus?
---
All in the magic damage baby! People forget that magic accuracy is negligible vs slayer monsters. I would rather have the kodai and initiate w/ slay helm instead of ancestral for bursting.
---
College student spells "flies" incorrectly oh my lord.
---
Doing bagged trees is what I did on all my accs 1-30 farming super fast
---
Dude I fell for this scam after returning to runescape after like 10 years... I feel your pain :(
---
I did it up until the light puzzles because the library was so poorly optimized I had 60 seconds of time in it before it would log me out for being so laggy, putting me back at the beginning :(
---
Never sell it then
---
&gt;if you bring up the Strength bonus as an argument for tiering
---
I think that's what everyone else is trying to say, which is what I'm disagreeing with. I see Bandos as tier 65 because that is the requirement to use it, just as I would see whip as tier 70 and twisted bow as tier 75.
---
I didn't realize there was a prospectively subjective tiering system that was arbitrary from player to player.
---
What would you define bandos/whip/twisted bow tiers as if not their level requirements? Wouldn't that just be a random opinion?
---
Umm pls fuck off, he won the competition. If you get injured youre obviously not the strongest man. Being at the competition in good condition is part of the contest.
---
uhh..are those circular diagrams really necessary when mining at mlm?
---
r/SeattleScapers
---
Thanks for taking the time to do this.
---
Why do you not fletch? Don't you get more points which gets you more rolls/rewards?
---
easily ready, better stats always help
---
`Nuke them!
---
So can someone elaborate on why it thinks I have my pet out when trying to join a lms f2p game?
---
Tier is simply a term rs3 players started to use when their game got remade to be more like wow than rs.
---
In osrs armours arent (only) balanced around the level required to wear. 
---
There is no reason why you would talk about "tier x" unless you believe that the only factor for balancing should be level required to wear. And considering that in almost all cases people can only afford high end equipment much later than they can wear it it makes even less sense.
---
Dang man congrats! Go cash in on that Achievement Cape!
---
Not at all. I honestly dont remember ever turning the plug in on. But I guess for the ultra lazy it helps to click an ore vein without having to turn the camera
---
A [true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR7FC-h0Fb8) classic.
---
I think it's because the upper nodes work a little differently than the bottom ones
---
I didnt ask jagex to nerf demonic gorillas drop table cuz i wen't 2.2k dry for my third zenyte ... Rng can be a real bitch sometimes and keep in mind some people with your kc had a couple drops ;)  your just unlucky
---
I get it‚Äôs a joke but nobody could afford thousands of Kodai wands. There probably is only a couple of thousand in existence
---
Looks like an old witch. Explains the limited competence.
---
I'm more of an afkscape guy, autocasting fire surge with sotd and tome is mad exp
---
Damn imagine being such a fucking waste of a human being, that the only self gratification you can get is from begging spade boiz to say you‚Äôre a god after scoring a sweet 4.5 prayer exp from them
---
Give it gmauls spec lol.
---
For a second I was like, do you mean augury? Then I realized you probably meant rigour vs other similarly priced or more expensive upgrades.
---
At that point just use ancient staff TBH.
---
I'm going to kill the final follower (zammy) for mage arena 2 after work today and will be able to get the imbued God cape.
---
I wanted to get at least 1 of each cape. After I complete the miniquest, does each rollower respawn where I found him? I'm assuming I don't get another locator thing because after killing each follower they were removed from the locator.
---
The Justicar gave me the most issue and is in a pretty inconvenient spot so I'll probably get the Sara cape. Am I correct in thinking I can go to the same spots for guthix and zammy, kill them, and get the drop for their respective capes?
---
Who‚Äôs competin‚Äô
---
I am guilty of going to wildy agility course with graceful as a noob. Forgot I was runecrafting at the abyss right before that... so I lost everything
---
SIIIIIIICK OWNAGE BRO
---
More like running back to the bank a million times becuase the NPCs purposely only tell you a few items at a time that you‚Äôll need
---
Way too insignificant to ever be useful however.
---
According to the wiki around 46.6k/hr extra, so that's probably a close estimate. Definitely worth it for me given how many hours of rune drags I'll be doing.
---
Damn I‚Äôve been hoping that GTA6 was going to be set in DC for years now.
---
Not on an ironman who didn't pay for rev protection :p
---
Uh oh didn't say osrs, it said runescape. I dunno man.
---
Isn‚Äôt mort‚Äôton north of de Rott smh my head
---
Not true. I use a tanking setup with veracs and it has proven to be very effective.
---
Always press +2 when flipping/buying items.
---
lmao this kid asks me a question and i get downvoted just showing his account sarcastically saying i‚Äôm good :/
---
You need 60% to access the spellbook in the first place, make sure you account for that.
---
Yea there's a formula for success rate. Higher level is better success percentage: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Carnivorous_chinchompa
---
I was stoned off an edible like 2 weeks ago and i forgot i was in a pvp world and got pked for my Berserker ring
---
Had 2 dragon pick from kbd in 300ish kills while on task ... im happy i didn't kill vet ion like on my fist ironman . Pkers were so anoying and it took nearly 400kc to get it. i feel your pain man gl
---
I imagine this is the life of all the top page elitists even in their late 20s
---
raids. i only play pures.
---
LOL NICE HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
This is my setup: [https://i.imgur.com/2cMUyyp.png](https://i.imgur.com/2cMUyyp.png)  
---
Gets met 2-4 kills per inventory without any problems. If you remain around the droprate it shouldn't cost you a lot of supplies. For me however, it does. That's the biggest downside.
---
For?
---
if I didn't have the wc and rc pets already I'd still be doing rc when I wanted to afk-ish, but for now I'm nearly 40m fishing xp with no heron
---
Hard?  You safe spot one square for two phases, walk around some flames, and stand still again while you melee.  You don't even have to worry about the healing phase because she's dead before they pop.
---
Great post, I definitely see a lot of people opting for the "max magic" look rather than just buying a Kodai but maybe that's cause Ancestral just looks awesome lol.
---
As another user said, I'd love to see rigour. I know I've had a hard time convincing my friends that dropping the 65m or so is totally worth it. They just like having gear that they can actually see.. which I can understand to an extent. maybe the raw data would help sway them more
---
That would be a nice addon if your ip is from venzuela.
---
Oh thanks! Kourend Noob here except for farming guild, Mt Karuulm and Catacombs.
---
this is how it went for me but I got it done, grats on the dedication
---
ROS is useful in a ton of combat scenarios.  Especially for iron men looking to save prayer/food.  The +20 defense in all types and +4 prayer is extremely useful
---
sick account! most definitely take skill at 61 range.
---
Highwayman struck your email
---
I literally just explained it to you, you make a build you make sure you don't mess it up.
---
5.2k kc and all i get is a shity necklace. Fuck you
---
Well, it depends what you mean by 'joke'.
---
I haven't used a guide and have most of the quests done. I was dreading DT it's actually incredibly straightforward
---
Okay I guess I understand
---
In summary, people don't like the term "tier" here because it is assumed to mean the same thing as "tier" in rs3, which apparently is something that people don't like (I wouldn't know, I don't play that game).
---
Therefore, we will not use the term "tier" here, because it is opaquely tied to an external tier system that is frowned upon by the player base
---
IT‚ÄôS LIKE WHEN YOU JERK OFF TO YOUR CHARACTER
---
If i take a hit of acid now and again 3hours from now im pretty sure it wont make a difference. Ill still be tripping anyway.
---
Guess its not ‚Äòunderrated‚Äô but dont see many people talking about it - any of the 3 verzik themes. they just fit great into the environment and the vocals were perfect for the boss music
---
Lol, acting like someone came to your door and you talked long enough for the trees to kill you? Nice try neckbeard
---
Yeah, they do, and they decided that the slayer perk would be a 10% chance for a repeat task. There already is a balanced perk, you just want an OP one lol.
---
yes
---
The problem was avoiding spoilers/solutions while looking for that piece of information. I was pretty certain so I figured I didn't need it, lol. A lot of the accounts I had heard of the quest + time to competion of other people that did it guideless was relatively in line with what I was experiencing, so I didn't really think twice when I was having such difficulty.
---
Yea my OSRS account was meant to be mobile only (like 90% these days) but still suck at it. Usually did a bit better on mobile. If I could hit key my prayers and food I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue
---
Yeah I can't log in
---
Granite maul

Drink a beer or two in the waves leading up to jad that‚Äôll settle your nerves.

I would love a new quest in the Desert Treasure quest line. Actual good lore
---
It uhh....it does. What's your confusion here.
---
Is LMS playable on any world?
---
He‚Äôs also a millionaire...
---
barrows/gwd and others follow the same set of parameters.
---
It's basically a upgrade version of torags armour.
---
Varrock wins. Every other city sucks. 
---
Lumbridge is a shack. 
---
Draynor has no chance, 
---
Canifis is being held back by Varrock atm. 
---
Falador might be okay if they can align with the dwarves. 
---
Taverly is full of hippies. 
---
Camelot has a shot, but 0 army. 
---
Ardounge is in turmoil with a deposed king and no solidification of power. 
---
Al Kharid has a small, well trained army. They have potential but their gear is meh. 
---
Yanille is the best contender. Mage&gt;Melee so they would be solid. They would have to travel to Varrock &amp; through white wolf mountain. So unless they went through the mines of mor- the dwarven mine - then they would suffer.  
---
Priff would be insane. But geographical challenges would make it difficult for them to attack properly. Elves work best in the woodland.
---
I wish. I don't even own a set. Was just browsing the wiki and notice the stats are a bit off.
---
I'm trying to get a slayer task from Konar quo Maten for Vorkath. From my understanding, you can't get Vorkath itself as a slayer task, but instead, blue dragons. The places that Konar assigns you to slay blue dragons isn't on the island that Vorkath is on. 
---
If I get a Blue Dragons in the Ogre Enclave, would killing Vorkath still count towards this slayer task? If not, how do I get Vorkath tasks so I can get a Brimstone Key drop?
---
only w302 has this issue
---
Don't conflate "mage bonus does very little" with "mage bonus does nothing". Mage bonus does still increase your dps a small amount against targets with low mage def, it doesn't literally do nothing
---
We‚Äôll get it, I‚Äôm getting him down to the healers and taking them out. I think just the fact I have to redo the waves again give me anxiety and I misclick. I tried playing on a laptop but I‚Äôm so use to playing mobile that everything was a little different for me to do
---
I agree with you that it should be better than normal gargs, but I think if the mechanics are simplified and the fight becomes shorter, that will make it better than normal gargs. Making it simpler/faster might drive the unique price down though, so perhaps a small buff like you're talking about would be warranted.
---
He does say, specifically, that it's absolute max mage with Master Wand on a slayer task (with bracelet swapped for the better xp/h option) vs only the Kodai (and bracelet, cape, slayer helm). Mostly it's to show that Ancestral shouldn't be picked before Kodai.
---
Varrock has multiple ways to get in it, I feel like falador teaming with dwarves wud be amazing since they dwarves have blast furnace and fally has the resources, al kharid also is in the dessert so other city‚Äôs will have to adapt to it
---
&gt;	That hasn‚Äôt come into effect yet. I don‚Äôt think it will. I doubt they will put it through as an integrity change but I can‚Äôt say for sure.
---
It‚Äôs a confirmed [integrity change](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/bounty-hunter-rework-design-and-pvp-changes?oldschool=1).
---
Here are the relevant parts:
---
&gt;	**PvP Integrity Changes**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;	These changes will go ahead without a poll for necessary rebalancing to protect the health of PvP. Large amounts of feedback and ongoing discussion informed these decisions. While no single outcome will please everyone, these changes were decided with the integrity of PvP and fairness at the top of our priorities.
---
&gt;**Granite Maul**
---
&gt;The Granite maul is a weapon almost exclusively used in PvP. Despite being a low level weapon (requiring only 50 Strength and Attack to use), it offers huge KO potential with its special attack because it hits your opponent instantly, allowing you to stack high amounts of damage. On top of this, the Granite maul is low cost compared to other weapons with similarly high KO potential, like Dragon claws and the Armadyl godsword. 
---
&gt;	To re-balance the Granite maul, it‚Äôs special attack cost is being increased from 50% to 60%. We realise that this is a big change and affects many players accounts that are built around the weapon. To avoid making it unviable in PvP altogether, an upgrade item will be introduced that can be attached to the Granite maul, reducing its special attack energy cost back to 50%. 
---
&gt;	This upgrade item will be available from the Bounty Hunter store for 1,250,000 Bounty Hunter points. In the original blog, we suggested that this item would be always lost on death but in response to feedback, this is no longer the case. However, if the item is not protected, it will be converted to 375,000 coins on death and the Granite maul will be lost.
---
If you‚Äôre new to PvP, I think the 1.25M BH point requirement will serve as a pretty daunting barrier of entry designed to discourage you from using the gmaul right away. Unless you don‚Äôt mind the 60% spec cost. I could honestly see people recommending that you use a different spec weapon until you can get the upgraded gmaul though.
---
Having said all that, you have an excellent point about starting out with gmaul stats since you can always level up your stats for a different build, but you can‚Äôt ‚Äúunlevel‚Äù your stats if you decide you want a low-level pure.
---
That is a good point. I think shortening the boss fight by simplifying the mechanics and possibly removing long transition phases would push them above normal gargs though.
---
Haha friendly discussion here.
---
lmao who even plays rs3
---
Didn't that come with Blood Runs Deep? Exiles is the same spot in the series as Glorious Memories, so maybe the Grandmaster will bring back that axe.
---
I know these guys!
---
Slower casting speed in the context that the only advantage kodai might have is autocast ancients which is on a 1 tick delay when bridding.
---
I've done nearly all of them without one. The only tough ones I did with a guide were Frem Trials and Recruitment Drive, since I did those on release before I decided to start going guideless. Also because I had already done them back in actual 2007. 
---
The one quest that really stuck out to me as being too obtuse to solve without some tips was in Aid of the Myreque iirc. There's a part where you have to figure out how to have the citizens of Burgh de Rott let you in, and it's done by putting food in a completely un-noteworthy chest. 
---
I also used Runelites agility feature when doing the trek through Meiyerditch. The stuff you have to click on is so visually obscure that I honestly would have had no idea what to do without it. You spend years with the game with ordinary bookshelf's that you can't do anything else other than take books from, and all of a sudden you're expected to know that you have to climb on them in Darkness of Hallowvale. It was pretty dumb.
---
So why include a 150m arcane sigil. It's obvious you're making a point with a skewed system of looking at it.
---
Yeah because mage attack in this game is pretty trash, the max hit is all what matters
---
Also u gotta take into consideration gnomes and there planes
---
And with brexit around the corner who the fuck knows how much harder or easier that process becomes.
---
Its fun
---
Wait you mean they made a mingame store that rewards you with items worth a good amount of gp and it is being botted?  No way that is true.
---
They have giant castle walls though and a sustained economy. Falador doesn't even have an altar so they can't pray
---
I can't understand how 21 people have 200m rc xp.
---
Seems like they are leaving a sinking ship
---
Is the GP/XP for snape grass "worth" it? I'm trying to save up for a DHCB but also want to eventually get 99.
---
Gnomes are lvl1, their russian army tactics are meh against the elite Varrock force.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how foreign RS3 looks to me. I don‚Äôt even know half the words on that calendar lol.
---
Same
---
Try Motherlode Mine! It's basically like fishing but for rocks :)
---
90% of the time I get flamed I say nothing
---
Mutagen or zulrah pet :^)
---
Testing
---
Didnt know Oslo registered as joker on wow. Came prepared this time round i see
---
Back on now, that was odd
---
Dude, you're not gonna get people on your side with that big ass wall of text. Use some paragraphs and a little punctuation.
---
The wait time sucks.  I'm trying for the bottomless bucket, 33kc and hoping it drops soon.
---
I would use a vga, but my computer is kind of far away from the TV. I'll definitely try to remember that if all else fails though.
---
I don't know what you're trying to imply here, adding excessive quantities of new stuff is what led to RS3/ezscape.
---
Ripperoni
---
Serious question, how rare is the Bryophytas esence? I killed like 3 Bryophytas and got it on the firt one I think. Sadly, it was before the collection log update.
---
&gt;If I get a Blue Dragons in the Ogre Enclave, would killing Vorkath still count towards this slayer task?
---
No
---
&gt;If not, how do I get Vorkath tasks so I can get a Brimstone Key drop?
---
You have to unlock boss tasks
---
1.25m bh points is only 500k and the attachment can be protected so it ain‚Äôt that daunting
---
ok bye lol
---
Lol alching while doing agility isn't bad on desktop, I do it  occasionally. But regardless, why do they gotta be upset when people play the game differently from them lol if they want a linear game, they should not be playing RuneScape.
---
Key difference is that rigour is a sunken investment. Once you buy rigour, you can never sell it. That alone makes it inherently costly.
---

Couldn't they just put a examine option on it to let them know which color it was?

negative magic doesnt matter unless -64 on 1magic attack monsters
---
A lot of people would spend money on the gear on the left instead of buying a kodai. He‚Äôs showing that, even if you wear almost nothing else, the kodai beats out max mage. Therefore you should prioritise it.
---
I have almost 1k kills because I want pet and idk why you guys complain it‚Äôs really not that bad and if you can afford to use rune darts 99 range you never have to collect health orbs. It‚Äôs fight doesn‚Äôt need much work maybe skip the second phase with the lava spots would make it better but other wise it takes like 1:20 to kill on average less with scyth and dragon/tune darts
---
U just get to 85 and give up?
---
what's the difference
---
Do hunter if you can play 6 hours a day you'll be able to make money back for a bond np
---
I think its mostly fine
---
Because bosses should be able to kill you
---
-With less hp there would be no reason to pick up the orbs, because yoi could down dawn so fast.
---
-I like that you cant camp there forever and that you actually take damage even if using prots perfeftly
---
(You can block most of the dmg before dawn dies)
---
-light things should only damage while visible
---
-too fast falling rocks and stunball are op
---
-transition animations can be anoying but I think it gives you nicely time to heal and gear switch between phases
---
I volunteer. Especially if they add satsifying death animations for on-the-spot bans like in RS3.
---
They dont make sense if you don‚Äôt pk.  All of these rewards, every single one, are geared specifically for pvp (mainly pker vs pker pvp in edge or pvp world) so if you dont pk often sure they arent going to make sense. Like why do i need an extra 5 spellbook swaps with my mage cape? I have an alter in my house? Its used for pking.
---
Or why imbue/upgrade elder maul? Its a raids item. Well the item was designed as a godsword without a spec, but because of this godswords are still much much better. And with the gmaul nerf(while a good thing) the only useable combo with the maul (elder maul to
---
Gmaul) becomes useless. So if they upgrade it, making it cost more and therefor have more risk, it will be way more useful in honor pking.
---
If younhave any specific questions let me know id be happy to help guide you to a yes vote
---
I want to say gnomes, they'll have everyone who has done MM1 on their side.
---
right! maybe by delving into some dungeons by yourself or with a group? similar to the new elf quest dungeon but maybe in its own location
---
If your game knowledge is so lacking that you don't know how to make money as a pure, maybe don't make a pure?
---
Its tradeable because if you make it untradeable, pvmers will complain theyre being forced to pvp. Not only this, but it allows pkers to make money from their time.
---
Tbh I couldn't really figure out a milestone I wanted to go for. Noticed I was close to 2k and thought 85 would be a good baseline for most the stats. Few of em I did for diaries (agility, herblore)
---
Addy should be enough dps and rune is a small increase for the price once you‚Äôve reached 99 range. My advice is to buy a few hundred if your on hydra it shouldn‚Äôt be to much of a problem to throw some gp away. Try them out for a few trips if you like the faster ttk then keep them but remember the trade is price.
---
You cant one tick anything from a dark bow because of its fire rate.
---
What about the falador/dwarfs alliance, dwarfs set up cannons in fally, so falador can protect them. While that‚Äôs goin on dwarfs use blast furnace and make weapons so fally can mobilize
---
Well? Hopefully if it passes in lms, we can also add it to Bh. That being said i think they have a better chance of passing from lms than BH because pvmers hate risky pking.
---
Ha! Got eeeeeem
---
I was DC'd right as I stepped into corp cave... swear to god I better not have lost all my shit
---
Poll it, I'd vote no.
---
Oh, I'm sure that was their intent; it is just strange to upgrade something like a cape perk. The only cape that has anything like this at the moment is Ranged, but that is upgrading the perk to be on par with the perk as it exists elsewhere; not making a perk unique the cape even stronger. Using the Magic Cape in PvP is already a weird form of dailyscape so it would make more sense to try to break away from that then adding to it.

I think a motivated newcomer could really have a great impact, but projects like these usually drag on for a long time and can be a strain on developers. Usually the people managing the developers seem to not understand prioritization and projectmanagement. Or they don't want to finish anything and jump on the next problem in my experience this is what usually causes people to walk away. Developers usually don't have the ability to make decisions while they are the ones who can decide best. This is based on my own experience and I don't know how Jagex works whatsoever.

Compiled it from wiki. Restore vs sanfew and then put em together.
---
Exactly. To put it plainly if you‚Äôre wearing Prossy for those tasks instead of Vestments you‚Äôre just kinda handicapping yourself for no reason. People have this misconception that if a monster is 1 Defense your accuracy isn‚Äôt effected. You can still always splash.
---
Yeah, I can already see something about 13% and 50%
---
Yes, but Jagex doesn't really actually care. Only the OSRS team does.
---
Yeah but ur not playing it 10hours/day at that point, and u dont even need those gear drops. Might as well say osrs is grindier because u can grind for 45 pets. 
---
U also get to endgame faster on wow than osrs. 
---
Theyre both grindy af is what im saying basically.
---
Text and pic don‚Äôt go well with each other
---
Nice statement sir. You got evidence?
---
Systems like this can be set up in a matter of a week if done by a team who knows what they're doing. They should contract in some experts and just get it done. My guess is they aren't doing anything at all about it though.

Get your melee stats up and do the quest lost city
---
It‚Äôs about what they add. I‚Äôve been playing for years and I know a lot of other long time players that agree the game gets stale when compared to our other options in the gaming world. Without new content and concepts the same old grind and repeat eventually reaches max and you eventually get pretty bored.  We need new content if we want new items and weapons that are any different then the current set.
---
"I don't have fun playing that way so he must be really bored."

That way you can wield dragon weapons and can kill green dragons and that‚Äôs pretty good money

True

Is there a reason why they didn't just make untradable a like void be kept over 20 wild in the first place instead of needing an item?

This is slander. Take this down right now!

My avg considers uniques, the 1/500 tourmaline core adds 10k/kill alone. The avg kill should be in the 45-50k ballpark with those.

This is really good for a year, right? I haven't played OSRS since 2009 ish so I don't know if it's easier to achieve this success or what now. My new acc is a month old and  close to 1000 total, but I feel like getting 2k will take a lot of hours a day to get in a year. Do you play a lot?
---
How much of a boost in kills can it give? W/o elite void and at 90 range
---
Idk what game ur playing but wow has potato graphics too. The osrs graphics just look simple. Its like playing mario bros. Yeah golden eye has better graphics but theyre shit in todays day and age.  However, the art style of mario bros makes the simple graphics appealing. For wow classic i just feel like im running a game on low low detail.

Hated high school so much, it was a constant battle between us and the fucking faculty. It all ended when they finally blocked every website ever except the ones they wanted us to be in, instead of blocking individual sites. 'Course, then students started getting their hands on phones that had wifi hotspot capabilities, but then they took away our admin rights to change the network settings on the computers, which is pretty much where we left it when we graduated. One of my friends at one point managed to make a hidden folder on the teacher's server though XD I swear to god though, they just needed to fuck off in the purest sense of the phrase.
---
Stop lying
---
thought so
---
Not true. Am 52 prayer on pure and restores give 1 more than prayer and theyre usually cheaper/prayer point too.
---
The reason i say no is purely i am a dick. I have 99 runecrafting, i wouldn't profit from this one bit üòÇ

Because everyone would rag in it

I'm 2040 with no 99, but 300k xp for 99 hp sadly

Somebody (/u/JagexGambit I believe, I‚Äôll try and find a time stamp) on the QnA on 8/14 mentioned that the next blog would come ‚Äònext week‚Äô (as in sometime 8/19-8/23) and here we are two weeks later still with no blog. Communication is still poor at best. I understand that these changes and blogs involve a large number of teams at Jagex, but please at least let us know that the original date slipped so we can have an up to date timeline. Radio silence doesn‚Äôt help anybody. At least give us the courtesy of telling us the date has slipped.

F you right up the butt. &lt;3

Probably 1.5 efficient hours per day spread out over 3 hours of time where I'm fletching but occasionally forgetting about it and logging, etc.

I can grind bonds with vork pretty easily but after buying bonds for like 5 months in a row I found it had a pretty big impact on my net worth that I'm still not back from. 
---
Since then, I've stopped using GP for bonds and probably will never buy a bond again unless it makes sense from a time invested standpoint.
---
But everyone wants it to be ezscape. They might not say it but they suggest "qol" changes that are essentially ezscape.
---
My guess is that since it's super low volume, it's not very commonly traded so 50m isn't that big of a change. Also the way the GE works is the 5% change each day, not sure if that's relevant tho
---
This highlights how illogical the maths is behind how magic hit rolls are calculated more than how good the kodai wand is.
---
You can add 2 more rooms without it increasing load times right?

Any reason not to do so?

But do you have 99 agility? O.o

On top of all this u got to get approval. No one cares about lms but cw is iconic and nostalgic.

Does classic WoW have a botting problem?

Im seriously considering making the switch.

The price point is very similar.

You get MUCH better player support from WoW.

These bots are genuinely ruining the game. (Look at vork/MLM/zu any world any time)
---
And you actually get a decent game engine. 
---
I‚Äôve loved osrs but it may just be time for a prolonged break.
---
Prayer pot is 7+(1/4prayer level)
---
Super restore is 8+(1/4prayer level)
---
The only difference between them is +1 prayer, super restore always has +1 over prayer pot
---
:) great art btw

I'm just gonna guess and say Vanakka, since AFAIK he's the only tutor accessible off the island.

Is there a resource that shows more things like this? I'd like to know the best upgrade for increasing my dps for slayer for the best return on gp. If anyone knows please share.
---
Mostly air battlestaves. Chiefly on moblie.
---
How is this gatekeeping lmao
---
You're doing an incredible amount of assuming to think I meant a Jagex employee will lose a job because a gold farmer exists. No I think the consequences of gold farming/selling could affect the game and result in players quitting. If enough players quit employees will lose jobs if Jagex isn't making enough money.
---
Also you explaining to me how hard it would be to rob a bank means the point of my comment flew over your head.
---
Also a couple million is an understatement, they've lost way more than that. If they had that money how much more could they be expanding their company? How many more could they have hired? we all know Jagex has areas in the company that need to be expanded.
---
You're arguing against classic redditors man you won't get anywhere
---
Love these posts
---
That's really weird, I wonder how Sanfew serum calculates this
---
On the wiki it gives formulas for both prayer and super restore, but the Sanfew serum just says "same as super restore"  but the table clearly has +33 for 96-99 instead of +32.
---
I don‚Äôt think any jmod actually pk‚Äôs lmao. support.
---
????
---
That makes it the perfect time to give feedback lol
---
That's why people use super restores over a prayer pot
---
It equals a whole extra dose every inventory, that adds up. That's like saying 1 max hit increase is insignificant. It really isn't when it adds up over thousands of trips.
---
Interesting, here you can see how almost all of your ranged strength bonus always comes your ranged weapon/ammo, as these setups have the same ranged str bonus before counting prayers. Ranged is a very accurate style, where the difference in ranged attack between BiS gear like armadyl and welfare gear like black d'hide isn't that great tbh. And as you point out, against weaker enemies a slight buff in accuracy matters less and is where you want every max hit boosting items as possible.
---
Melee is a bit different as every BiS gear gives strength bonus, which adds up quite a lot. Gloves, boots and ring alone give +27 str bonus for instance, while for ranged it's +0. And the faster your weapon is, the higher dps increase you'll get from additional (ranged) str bonus. It's more substantial to go from max hit 30 to 31 with a 2-tick weapon than from 60 to 61 with a 4-tick weapon.
---

Wow I was actually thinking this morning that I'm almost ready to go membs and fulfill my dream of doing a Graador kill. 
---
My plan is to get stats for quests such as Desert Treasure, Recipe for Disaster, etc. (that I never managed to do when I was younger), and then go membs with gp and try to keep the bond with just gp. 
---
[Here's where I'm at right now](https://i.imgur.com/ckTrjDn.jpg). All that's left is 50 fishing and 50 mining. Got 25m cash in the bank too. 
---
I'll probably make a post asking for a mentor as well!
---
Because magic bonus is essentially irrelevant to DPS save for very very few situations.  Nearly everything you use magic on already has 0 magic defense, which makes everything past +20 magic bonus pointless.
---
wait what is going on here? its two tests ones using rigour?
---
It‚Äôs too good even with a repair cost. The cost would have to be in the mills to even be worth it.

me doing kraken in the bathroom at work today
---
&gt;Just get smacked out by people who have been doing it for years, and I know the response is going to be "well practice and you'll get better" 
---
Because there is no other method you can substitiute practicing with...
---
&gt;but there isn't really the opportunity to practice in the current mode, other than maybe splashing a few barrages on them or shooting off 1 bolt before getting stacked out and having to re-join...
---
Just attack them with bolts and focus on your own prayer switching to begin with, the only way you get stacked out regularly is getting specced while wearing robes with the wrong prayer up, which is very avoidable.
---
Are you using f-keys btw?
---
I went from sub 3hrs spent pking to getting 5 wins in ~150 games by spamming LMS during the beta, by no means fantastic, but definitely a massive inprovement, if you can just manage to keep at it even when getting slapped around in the beginning you're sure to improve.
---
They are good xp once you learn to kill them. They have low defence and very high hp. They are also 3m+ gp/h.
---
I did all black demon tasks there after i did mm2. I was 94cb by then and like 75rng. They were definitely worth it, bp and arclight is all you need. God d hides and fury is basically the best gear there too and bp as spec or bgs.
---
I did a 116 kill trip there once not too long ago, with a bgs spec (I am now maxed). Killing them is mostly skill only. You will run into a 50/50 on their first hit and after their melee, but other times you can just pray and count to 3, while keeping distance after the 3rd.
---
Yeah that's fair. Regardless that wasn't really what the post was about lol, the helm itself is fine

Same with tbow and scythe though you wouldn't use it on silly things as the upkeep is quite bad, the bpipe and the tbow are cheaper as you can sub ammo but scythe is a set loss I felt

When I was 200M, I sold my bank for dhcb setup to do exactly what you're describing. Per hour played, it's wildly efficient, but I've had to commit to do the same thing for like a hundred hours straight. I'm now at 365 mill with about 20 hours to go before I hit 99 ranged and will sell this setup.
---
I am the "grind Vork all day till I make it back" type so I don't regret my decision, but even for me, it's very taxing. If you're more casual, just wait until you can afford it. If I had to guess, I'll say that if you sell you're gear then you'll start not playing at all, so in real time it'll take you fucking forever to earn it back.
---
Also keep in mind, with my dhcb investment, I could always resell it at any time. I even did briefly resell it to buy runes and a kodai wand to grind up 99 magic. If you buy rigour, there is no going back. You are absolutely irreversibly on the hook for $50M before you can play the game normally again.

I work in management and the difference in a good employee and a great employee is when they come to me with a problem and give a solution. Even if the solution given isnt the answer to the problem it shows they care and gives me more insight one the situation as a whole.

Also if you do that as an employee you get to say I told you so when management makes the wrong call.
---
Because you don't need the streamers actual IP address to ddos the world offline.
---
I always take your food!

If you don't boss, you probably don't need rigour right now
---
See, this is for sure a pvmer's wet dream, it's sadly unrealistic though. There would be more pvmers in a rev world than in normal worlds with caves, and because of the size of the area of the wild people would feel safer to bring more risk, causing more people to lose more because there would be an equal increase of pkers in the rev world hunting the pvmers down.  
---
It would go live, all the pvmers would die, rage on reddit, and the update would be the same thing as normal revs after a couple weeks, so ultimately a pointless update.

Just imagine a mobile only PKing world...

Rc bad
---
It is marginal, but it: has better def, more accuracy, prayer bonus(not relevant if counting against blessed hides), weighs less. It's really only expensive as it's not a boss often camped (as opposed to bandos)

There's a plugin called "Mining" you just have to enable it
---
NMZ overloads boost melee stats identically to super potions. Both are +19 with 94+ melees. Supers just lose the bonus gradually rather than all at once. Repotting every 6 levels should be similar DPS to overloading every 6 minutes, because of the 1 minute with unboosted stats being about as bad as 6 minutes of an average of -3 levels each minute (averages -18 for 1 min, vs -19 for 1 min with overload). But as someone else commented, it is more important that the overload means you'll be damaged more through absorbtions whenever it wears off.

One task and you get 15m??? I have noted dag bones and the only drops I ever get are warrior rings, dragon axes, fremennik armour and the occasional seers ring. This is why I am still poor at 90 Slayer.
---
I had a 140m stack but only from Hydra, you alch between kills! greatly reduced cause of planking, 400k broad tips and gold ore
---
&gt;No infernal cape

What are the pk worlds do you mean bounty hunter or pvp worlds or just worlds where people go to pk,if sso which arr these worlds?
---
What‚Äôs near max strength gear? The math I saw on Obby vs just Abby dag + tort/torso/tassies/neitz had Abby dag at better dps at nmz
---
I wonder how possible it is to make a runelite client for export/importing bank templates
---
I imagine there is a forum somehwere where you can buy enough accs per day to return quite an exponential return. Or the bot makers are botting the account making and only doing captcha checkd checks manually, unless some bright mind has found a way to bypass it. Only thing jagex can do in run botwatch and pray it bans them before the money is muled away.
---
Puzzle boxes are easy.
---
I really wish we could just bring untradables above 30 with repair fees I think it would make pking a bit more alive

3 a day should do it, becomes really fast once you get the lumbridge and ardy medium diaries done.

Rune Essence

I tweaked, I thought it was casual (0), competitive (100k), and high risk (1m). I see that's not correct now.  
---
I played it during the beta, had no interest to play it in the main game when I saw the main thing I wanted was so pricey.
---
Yeah, I wish my mom would do this.  But corpses aren‚Äôt the best sandwich makers.

WASD camera! :) It's a game changer
---
What's the scroll though?
---
The ones marked pvp that show up in red. I don‚Äôt remember the number because I just search by category on my list.

The killers don't get the "risk" tho, that parchment disappears.
---
is for friends who do stuff together
---
I tend to go most places with rune pouch (law,dust,fire) for quick teles, but in this case I believe I had chaos in there from recent Vorkath kills.
---
is for you and me
---
is for anywhere and anytime at all down here in the deep blue sea
---
GE item prices are capped at a change of +/-5% a day to counter merching
---
In terms of exp per hp for slayer bosses I think they might be at the top of the list.  They have also been nerfed on the past(less hp I think) so I doubt they are on jagex's radar at this point. I am definitely ok with other changes though and some of yours seem fun.
---
Haha yea right bub
---
Lmao.
---
If you bought 200m why not jus grab a bond
---
Killers do not get the "risk", the parchment just disappears and there's no reward for killing someone in those untradables so it kinda makes the point of "more gear more risk" go out the window.
---
&gt;void melle + salve +piety+ super combat is better than any melle gear for spec
---
even, say, all that but also with bring, infernal, and prims?
---
I wonder what this Sandwich Lady feet smell like after a long day of sandwiching
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we have gathered here today to mourn the passing of another 07scaper but before we begin would anyone like to say a few words about the deceased?
---
Gz just need evidence friend

The boosting is already happening :\\, idk how that's avoidable tho

He‚Äôs such a wanker

As far as I remember you gotta finish a pretty good chunk of the quest. Pretty much to the point that you may as well finish the quest.
---
It would be an upgrade at kraken boss too, not that you really need it as it's easy enough as it is.
---
&gt;Bank sales at the GE
---
What?  Bank sales were before GE existed weren't they
---
good luck explaining that to people who make strongly worded posts tho
---
Actually, in the professional world this isn't entitled... I'm really inclined to agree with the guy here.
---
You don't publically comment on any projects you're working on if you don't know for sure it's happening. This is very common practice in the software development world, why do you keep shitting on the end consumer for misinterpreting a business statement? This is **why** it's common practice to not disclose future projects, demos or concepts that may not come to fruition, to the general public.
---
this wep was really nice but it destroyed the prices of the rings bec dks became much easier to kill.
---

---
Because it's shit and no other company does it.
---
if its his first time p2p, going straight into slayer is the worst possible thing you could do. its very inefficient, he doesnt have any proper gear, and itll take way too long to train. by the time his first bonds run out he wont even have made any money. to buy another bond
---
Not legit he is not quitting. B0aty's actual stream link is twitch.tv/B0aty.
---
You're comparing the difference between the two sets, but that's not the point.
---
The point is that, starting with nothing,  one setup requires 127.9m the other requires 68.8m for higher dps.
---
So your comment should be:
---
&gt;Holy fuck, a non-refundable 50M GP raid-reward upgrade is worth more than a resellable 111.1M* upgrade?
---
&gt;This game is so fucking broken.
---
And then the sarcasm is lost because it's obvious that rigour is the better choice.
---
^^*111.1m ^^for ^^Arma ^^+ ^^pegs
---
I always take a sandwich. She's giving them away! She just cares about you, surely to god you can just take the sandwich and make her happy
---
Wait, those are real sandwiches. Did you get one?
---
at max efficiency at 60 smithing i think steel bars was 1m/hr. probably less now cause of zolcano
---
why do i care you got hacked? also where did you buy the gold?
---
get out of here
---
just pickup ashs at the GE for 200M/hour
