He wants a reward - either being new monsters in multi  or being in multi and killing people with his friends ? Right? that's so easy and boring why build new content specifically multi combat areas when the same man claimed he doesnt leave revs. Lol theres a whole bunch of multi combat zones ! They arent as rewarding as revs but hey why does everything have to drop so much valuables now ? What happened to just having fun. Smh

Mouse movement is an input, if it cuts out mouse movement it's 1:2. If you are literally remapping a key to another key that is perfectly fine
---
lol 50 constr
---
No, I'm saying that as person who has played the game, including both rs2 and rs3, since 2004. It has nothing to do with being 3d or not... 
---

---
The game content did not meaningfully change. All the same content was there. The "rs3" update was an arbitrary change that really didn't change shit.
---
Changing the graphics does not make it a new game. Your save persisted, and all the old content sass still there. It was an update, not a new game.
---
Fuck how'd I miss that? You're right thats awful
---
[removed]
---
Cause those streams don't do anything to actually stop bots
---
if they get in legal trouble for putting them into rs3, theyll get in even more trouble putting them in osrs.
---
Argue the pedantics of my wording however you want, it doesn’t change the fact that ahk was seen by jagex as a problem when this prayer plugin is WAY worse. It’s not even menu entry swapper anymore it’s so far beyond
---
Mustache
---
Just remove ironman. It's a multiplayer game.
---
Pretty sure you can just wander back a bit and let Nieve do most of the work on those guys?
---
there are different sorts of lotteries. Small lotteries for like $500k are different odds than a $100m prize.

They cancelled like 2 important game updates, nerfed the hell out of a skill minigame, and then added mountains of micro-transaction events in all of that, one of which has Virtus in it.
---
Pking is simply too complicated for a casual player now. Back in the day everyone pked because it was fun and simple. Now everyone is so try-hard that it pushes most casual players away from pking. The more attempts to “fix” this problem just creates more and more decide between the player base.
---
Wilderness loot maintains its high value far longer than non wilderness loot.

The effect of these items being in the wilderness works.

-900k/h would be still bad
---
-800k/h also bad
---
It's time to abuse runelite+ now i guess. Cause with this, i feel jagex is finally gonna put a foot down on these super overpowered plugins.
---
I was on the fence, but now i'm gonna get myself 90 thieving finally at menaphites.
---
The craziness what made it fun for me. I also liked how lower levels can still help out your team by killing the npc for soul fragments.
---
It would bring back a fun and alternative way to level combat stats besides nmz or afking at sand crabs.
---
Never lucky
---
Yes, runelite removed it from the official release, but there are self compiled versions that have that and more. There is nothing on the technical side for Jagex to know what client you are using, let alone what plugins that client is running.
---
Did you set up two-factor authentication? Do you even recognize the value of your account after proceeding through the many levels of the Stronghold of Security? DO YOU WANT 10k???!!
---
Not sure what’s my humour here. 
---
The post or your photography skills.
---
You hit the nail on the head, it's a democracy and my vote should count because it's my game. Just because I don't PvP alot doesn't mean I won't when I get the stats I want either. The rs end game that sets it apart from other games that makes the grind seem worth it is largely the PvP benefits you get once you reach your goals. If the PvP community feels like they don't have much of a voice, it's because they don't, welcome to democracy.
---
Dude holy shit I was a forum mod for battlescape back in like 2011 lol. It was an awesome game tbh but it had a lot of trouble with getting ddosing, hacking, and getting shut down by Jagex. Same guy palidino was making it. It wasn't a scam, just another rsps. I don't know if that's changed since then.
---
You have no clue what average pker is, normie.
---
No shit it is lol
---
&gt;However, we can't determine *why* they vote the way they do.
---
so make a poll asking why they vote the way they do???????????????????????????????????????
---
which of the following would best describe your playstyle?
---
* pvp player
---
* pvm player
---
* skiller
---
* some other snowflake shit
---
do you vote no on pvp polls out of spite?
---
* yes
---
* no
---
* skip
---
do you think ganking pvmers is the proper way to revitalize pvp?
---
* yes im literally retarded
---
* no im big brain
---
* skip im too retarded to understand the question
---
are you sexually active?
---
* yes i vote no on pvp polls
---
* no im a pvper
---
* skip im gay
---
Engine work... I think they would say something about it being too graphically intense and would crash the world.
---
at my job if you would've taken the day off from the morning it would be counted as a personal day but if you found out the person died after you showed up for work it wouldn't count
---
No, after a round. But unless you're very unlucky you wont eat more than 2 food per. Bring 8 to 10 first trip and see how it goes.
---
Lol how is it wrong dude
---
Literally who downvoted this? For what reason?  
---
I hope this can be answered even with less people who could help
---
Range to dharok with 70 strength is gonna be trash, youd be better off just using a ballista.  Venge and rigour
---
Nah what they should do is make it so everything in the game is rearranged and different for every player so no guides can be used
---
Yes
---
Keep voting no to pvp updates boys. All we need is slayer.
---
Spoofing packets and telling the server you already clicked use
---
When I had this problem I just logged out and back in again and it worked...
---
Drink absorptions. Rock cake down to 1hp, or if using overloads use that first then rockcake down to 1hp.
---
That's literally it. Occasionally rockcake down to 1 again or flick rapid hp to keep hp at 1
---
You should make your own thread and go in more depth. This is incredibly well written and more people need to see it.
---
No we just hate this shit overused joke.
---
My opinion is the same as it’s always been. Any overlays are cheating. Any non-default menus are cheating. If you use third party clients for anything besides gpu rendering, timers, and hi-scores, you are cheating.
---
What?
---
Seers tele, bank, tele to house. No need for extra items.

rs3 has an ingame poll system, Jamflex hasent used it in like 2 years. but its there :/

I'm trying to say that I want the rounds to be as long as possible, for the max amount of points-- getting it low, letting it heal to 40%, to repeat

So Reddit thinks plugins that helps their braindeadlessness do PVM content are alright but when they affect clicking an altar everyone goes wild? Man ya'll a bunch of bitches

Just have like 6 wines in your inventory and youll be fine
---
Same. Getting 71 for Morty hard and I honestly just don't want to do this skill at all. It's stupid and boring and I hate it. Currently at like 67
---
Id agree with brews if youre going to solo which is what i assume youre going to do. Just cuz they have most health per inv slot. If youre going todt world and trying to stack as many as you can then wines would be cheapest option
---
The problem is that if the items can be used outside of BH and LMS, then the updates are effectively adding ways to kill PvMers easier and they'll all vote no.
---
Oh I didn't know that, I always participated through the events tab or whatever it is
---
Is my osrs membership also a rs3 membership?
---
I can completely agree with what you’re saying. My opinion on the whole situation is this though. I’d rather people bot their account purely for xp or items rather than rwt. I know the game is easy to bot but it’s also easy to not buy gold especially with bonds around. No demand for gp/items/accounts would mean people have no reason to bot unless it’s for their own accounts personal gain. Hence stopping probably 90% of all bots currently in game. 
---
TLDR: bottling for personal xp &gt; botting for gold and rwt 
---
Just my opinion tho
---
How do you get one
---
doesn't RL already do this or a different way?
---
It maxed out at like 6mb/hr

And that's really intensive play

Slickback? A pimp named slickabask wuld bea vaera disasdap
---
I agree but an osb mod said jagex was aware they were adding it
---
Rebrand PvP. For some reason Jagex has thought that baiting skillers and PvMers into the Wild for PvPers to consume was a good idea, but you've put players who didn't want to engage in PvP in a position where they're forced to engage in PvP. It's a fundamentally flawed idea. It can never be sustainable. To create lasting engagement in PvP Players have to fight Players who want to fight Players! 
---
By pushing a cat and mouse game you have ingrained a culture of victimization, which has created a hugely negative perception of PvP and the culture surrounding it. /u/JagexGambit I'm happy you're listening to this. I have preached this since the first wildy rejuve and John C just laughed and said it wouldn't hurt.
---
To be blunt I’m pretty much saying it’s the community’s fault bots and gold farmers run rampant in game. Just makes me sad to see it so bad lately. No matter how much work jagex puts in to alleviate it, nothing will change unless the community stops buying. Just my opinion tho
---
Done a few quests already. Think I'll try do waterfall next, get that head start
---
To be fair, the combat triangle in osrs is pretty fucked. Not saying that I wan't it to be changed, but the fact that the mods are addressing it through polling is a good idea in my opinion.
---
I think what he means is how are they gunna tell who's phone it is tho.
---
Especially if they have a generic phone like an iPhone.  They might know which device it is, but how are they linking that to someone? 
---
Then on top of that a lot of places have public WiFi so they'd have to tell if it's an employee or a customer
---
If anything they'd just block osrs, not try to find who it is playing it. They might have that knowledge but they're really not gunna act on it
---
Shut up black arm gxng for life
---
One time I was stuck on the shrooms... except I didn’t move for hours
---
hey, what stats would you reccomend to do bandos? im currently 75 attack, stre and def
---
I have indeed haha. And eventually when they realize it they're usually like "oh...So you think that too? Ok. Got it. Didn't understand what you were trying to say."
---
Nephew.
---
Think you replied on the wrong post entirely here bud.
---
It used to be a bot client or the sister client of a bot client or something, right? Wasn't it called Orion?
---
I'm pretty sure whoever owns a bot farm now also started botting for the same reasons i listed above and moved up from there.
---
The bot problem in OSRS stems from activities requiring mostly just time spent in front of your computer with little to no skill involved.
---
Lol, the "entitlement" is people realizing that the UI of Runescape was fucking atrocious and shit in 2007, and going to options that give them an actually not awful UI. Maybe if it wasn't fucking garbage, then the community wouldn't have so readily accepted 3rd party clients
---
You know thats not going to happen for multiple reasons. The community doesn't want more ways to grant combat exp outside of combat... that shit was botted to hell too
---
They also added 1 click blackjacking If you didn't see that
---
I think the wider community is super in favor of stuff like this, though. If Runelite put an autoclicker for thieving or alching in their next release I feel like a good number of people would hardly care at this point
---
What really needs to be added is a 10 second login attack timer. I’m sick of people logging in next to me and immediately hitting me with a TB. Totally don’t understand how this isn’t a no brainer already
---
Stop getting heads, then you might get a princess
---
Any guesses of whay items will shoot up for the new quest
---
This shouldnt even be polled wtf. "Hey guys, do you wanna go to this part of the game or nah? Nah? Ok". Why don't they ask me " hey pler, wanna grind for hours chopping trees, fishing, theiving, and other useless boring and mundane skills to acquire better prayers, soellbook, and gear for pking...
---
Yes I agree but again. If there was no one buying gold, items or accounts would said bot farmer have even made a bot farm in the first place? He’d have no one to sell to.
---
When are you going to get your 99 hunter? i dont play much now but would like to come to the party
---
There is no difference between someone who puts effort in to get good rates and a "normal" person. Imagine how entitled you have to be to think that you should get the same rates/rewards as people who are actually putting effort in
---
&gt;that one guy who hunters cbow glitched the head guard miniboss deep into the base and then teleported with him onto the airstrip
---
Idk, outside od Reddit this really doesn't hold that true
---
The thing is a large portion of people here don't play and haven't for a bit now. They stick around for the memes, but sure as all will inject their opinion about the game.
---
It's about a 50/50 chance if you ask the guy you're replying to here they'll say they don't even play anymore
---
Just wait til they're torn between biting the bullet on the cost of cballs or smithing them to 99 after the mining grind.
---
Thanks, the idea is a PvP is still on, but it offers a bit of a safe space all the same. I figure it could encourage more players to spend time in the deep wilderness rather than just running in and out/teleporting at level 20. There's probably a lot more you could do with the idea.
---
Swampletics ain't in the game for paper.
---
Well my whole scenario hinges on a quality official client with regular updates based on user feedback, so yeah, my idea is a little farfetched lol
---
Creating plugins that go beyond menu entry swapping is a completely different beast and discussion though.
---
It's one thing to have guitar hero inferno, menu entry swapped blackjacking and construction, and a completely different thing to one-click offer bones, light fires, and whatever is going on in the linked Tweet.
---
it was possible to worship every tick, but very hard to do consistently, especially for long periods of time. with this its trivial and anyone can do it. it removes the aspect of being reward for wanting to put in a lot more effort for a bit more xp.
---
if this is ok, why not just make it so when you afk use bones you use them 1 bone per tick?
---
&gt;this is a clicking simulator.
---
if you want to define the game this way, then reducing the number of clicks you have to do for a specific action should absolutely be considered cheating, since thats all the game is.
---
this doesnt make clicking easier, it makes it so instead of 3 clicks you have to do 1
---
TIL the countdown timer isn't in vanilla client
---
Oh, You're referring to the sire itself? I'm referring to the current pet model, which is a recolored black, red and yellow abyssal demon.
---
yes, its come full circle back to a bot client
---
yes but that's just a bot, not an actual client launcher. That's how bots work now. They load the client in a remote environment, then use an external program. but they lack a lot of the stuff normal clients actually have.
---
holy shit this might be the best post thats ever touched 2007scape reddit hahahaahaha
---
OSbuddy bad.
---
Runelite also bad but not as bad as osbuddy right now.
---
Lol? Jagex put the bare minimum into stopping it. All they do is try to maintain some sort of balance between bots existing and players not complaining. They dont want to eradicate it completely because it brings them money. They could easily make it so bot farming wasn't profitable if they wanted to, but they dont.
---
Small brain time

They litch-raly freed torvesta

This is anti democratic. We players must unionize!

Back to assuming shit you're clueless about? Cute, wonder how it feels to be a neet

Was the bludgeon ever 80m after release lol. Been pretty steady if I recall
---
If you get elite diary done, there's no point staying for more than 1 kill. You can bank, house, and get back to the cave before she respawns.
---
That's my point. Waiting until you're near max combat to get it makes no difference because you'll want near max combat for raids anyway.
---
Believe its coal first and then mahogany.  You can check the wiki, it's got a guide in it
---
Grinding isn't what veteran players played for, they played for the game (quests/minigames/bosses/pvp). It was easier to put up with the grinding back in the early 2000s because you didn't have to work for a living
---
That will be me in a month 90 farming right now while my other stats are around 70

Wow. U dick.

ahhh gotcha

---
What level did you start on? I was considering doing astrals over lavas from 70-77.
---
I’ve tested the Enhanced Prayer plugin myself and I can say it’s definitely overpowered. I think OSBuddy’s decision to release such a plugin serves two purposes: to reclaim market share (in terms of user base) and to push the boundaries of third-party clients.
---
While I don’t have any statistical data to back my claim, i’m going to assume that many players today use third-party clients, if not the majority. Jagex is in a lose-lose situation since they have delayed on providing an official stance on the matter.
---
Blackjacking is going to be the fastest xp.
---
Surely you mean maniacal monkeys.
---
Very cool post, Kanye, thanks for sharing.
---
I put my quest cape there for easy access to legends guild for clues
---
sounds like a capitalism problem at this point
---
I honestly do not understand how Jagex can look at features like this and not see the issue. Worse yet is that they constantly act on twitter as if they're "working on it" behind the scenes. Considering these features are pretty much given the seal of approval by Jagex I'm sort of confused why they dont just outright say so on Twitter.
---
I don’t think 600m is undergeared. More than enough to do an acb inferno
---
Where did anyone say Runescape is the sole source of our happiness?
---
I thought it was my hair for a sec lol
---
if you're a normal account, rogue outfit isn't really necessary if you're grinding thieving levels. You might miss out on a few hundred k but you save probably an hour or so going for the outfit before 80 thieving. 
---
Northeast building just outside the ardy marketplace usually has a knight stuck inside that only moves between 2 squares, just as low-attention as splashing and it's there way more often
---
its obvious sabotage by osbuddy, they going out of business and trying to take down all competition with them.
---
they will make more and more op plugins until jagex is forced to ban all 3rd party clients. it's not too hard to understand, just a dick move on osbuddy matthew's part because his client is shit and no one uses it and is just jealous of runelite lol
---
Where are you teleporting with only one air rune
---
you have the jewel box in the same room which teleports you to castle wars tho
---
True but even with TBow, a lot of people struggle, so it's better to get every advantage you can, and TBow is a huge advantage.
---
Then Runelite should also start adding these features
---
Does he sell them or what?
---
I think a accelerated problem is that it's beyond a solo mode cheating, but a clear high end advantage cheatiness in the wild that imo, will be just insanely broken since unlike 1 click blackjacking (Which while it could have been broken for afking and enabling autoclicking i heard), pvp 'quality of life' plugins to instause bones when it's damn near instant is absolutely BROKEN. It means that they can dump bones since there's no delay get up to 3-5x the normal exp rates with 1/3rd the risk using a full inv of bones in a matter of seconds vs minutes while other players risk while they could just instause bones and go "lol ty for speeding my 2 seconds of bones, hurry up noob", it'll create insanely unintended reward, no risk, in the wildy with cheaper exp and no risk and less intensity for what basically amounts to what nearly got rl removed for being a 'cheat client' when people coded one tick blackjacking. Now im not saying that everything should be as tedious as possible, if it's accessible and wanted by the community, far from it. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But these are obviouslly basically osbuddy resorting to flat out basically selling jagex approved cheats to players to get a real ingame advantage through money. Either they remove it, and brush it under, or B) They go in hands and send the message that buying 'cheat code clients', if it's osbuddy for irl money lets you p2w wildy prayer for half the cost and 3x the speed for no risk at all and removing the risk unless a altar pker wants to risk 20m to stack a 99 on a bone runner for 20k of bones.
---
Also.... the people who hunt those playsrs get hunted by other players.
---
The only ridiculous part of this was the ingame merching, which in itself isn't even all that ridiculous.
---
the issue is as per usual, we can only contact the developers and weath basically. the ability to change rules, especially on something with as big an impact as 3rd party clients, comes from above them from faceless management we dont know and cant contact.
---
even if the team we see has strong feelings (i suspect a tleast some of them do) on clients they cant say or do anything.
---
how about no
---
Remapping is literally the only thing allowed with ahk. 1:1 can be so much more than remapping, like mouse teleportation, a la mouse keys, WHICH IS NOT ALLOWED WITH AHK. Stop talking.
---
But...his methods are too savage!
---
The cease and desist was over deobfuscated code as a whole, not any plugin in particular
---
Pretty sure he's talking about bandos vs the adamant armor stats of prossy
---
Wtf!? I mean what's with the double standards. And in pvp too? It isn't fair to other players that one player could risk near nothing in the wildy, with a method balanced around risk in the wildy if they can use bones nearly instantly, there's near no delay on the wildy altar on how fast you can use bones. This means they'll not only be able to get exp rates near 2-3x as much as normal, but also risk basically near nothing if they can tank for long enough to use all their bones, 3-5 seconds in dhide vs 30-60 seconds without is just a insane gap.
---
why would osb want to fuck with the perception of 3rd party clients?
---
It isn't 1:1. Historically everything they have said is that it needs to be 1:1 or it is bannable.
---
Lobster (e)
---
Why dont you just bot your account if you think these new osbuddy plugins are fine? Fucking idiot.
---

this is nothing to do with area 51, its a screen cap from harry potter and the curse of the black pearl i think
---
why do you have both house tabs and house teles?
---
Nah they made it so it’s no faster than it’s always been, just less work.
---
lol? I used the word in the correct context, I can’t say the same for you.
---
Dragon spade, that has a spec that deals double damage if you're naked
---
? i don't think you understand quite what it does. Players can and do what it does already. This is doesn't make them go faster it just makes them click less
---
Steams are made the exact same way but with water runes instead and are only 5% slower xp. Worth it imo.
---
just buy em lol
---
Haha what was the name of her first pet and dream holiday location?
---
Once again, being aware doesn't mean they were okay with it. We know their stance on third party clients has changed with some new management and that they are working on stuff regarding third-party clients. Perhaps they didn't make a big deal about blocking those features because they already have other resolutions in the works.
---
see thats what makes you a sanctimonious little twat mate, i go bed for 3 hours brb
---
Well like everybody is saying, but I've been exclusively voting no to every pvp poll because you guys keep forcing people who dont want to pvp into the wilderness.  
---
Plus I dislike the negative community associated with pvp.  
---
Racism and bigoted language is rampant.  
---
I can't even count how many times when I'm chilling at clan wars and I see pvpers calling people they just fought a horrible slur.  I report em just like I do bots but the bots don't leave so I assume your report system doesnt work for language either.
---
magic shortbow with amethyst arrows is the only thing you'll need
---
Makes me feel like typing the n word
---
Not sure why you repeated that when I just said they are okay with it?
---
Sure they can! I have some tasks like "Collect 300k loot in the wilderness" and "complete x Barrows runs" for my combat tasks. I know Barrows is technically a minigame, but since it's dangerous I put it under combat tasks. 
---
I do want to stay away from rng based tasks for the most part, I dont want to end up having tasks like desert elite diary.
---
AFK for 40 min, then do the Cha Cha Slide with your mouse.
---
Ah the 5 star rating system. I always hated it!

How much did you sell it for op and did you 100x your bank like it would have done for me?

Until your 10 def you haven't  really earnt the right to flex in it.
---
'alternate' versions, LUL
---
Honestly, fuck these wildy PvM mobs. Should've just made one more instead of three. Remove those fuckers and put D Pick on KQ drop table. If they're gonna complain because they can't kill high-risk/high-reward mobs without the risk, then just remove them. Fuck it. Poll it. See what happens. Doubt it would pass because despite dying they're still incredible money makers for average PvM players.
---
Oh really? Magic shortbow is better?
---
I'm having trouble finding the actual list of tasks on those sheets, but thanks for linking them. I didnt know about the artisan sheet.
---
Also, this is just menu entry swapping, which is being done everywhere else. The left click prayer is sketchy tho
---
TIL marking tiles manually and having overlays that show npc hp make doing the inferno easier than cooks assistant, and makes you instantly woox level at prayer flicking!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cy8bhm/how_strong_is_the_magic_shortbow_i/

Not sure what that is tbh. This concept has been done a million times though so I'm not surprised lol
---
For someone so sensitive about profanity, you sure seem to swear a lot.
---
Jajajajaja
---
Thank you
---
I didn't repeat it; it added to what I meant. You just said a client dev said they were aware and added on that they were okay with it, but did Jagex say they were okay with it or is that what the client dev said based on their lack of action against it? Not taking action against it immediately or directly is not the same as approving the feature. And I'd also question the word of someone who willingly adds rulebreaking features to their client.
---
Do people actually play the game like this?
---
I guess u win ? Add another random group of npcs in multi that drop bank lmfao 😵😵😵 thats poop brother. I want to agree because I love practical and productive content but that doesn't make sense. With the focus being on pvp polling, safespots and magic defence calculation, you suggest adding another cocktail in the wilderness as a promotion I am just lost.

Thanks! She really is. I’m glad you found your person.

It will only pay for itself if you're earning 750k / hr or more without piety, 900k+ an hr with piety. Things like dragons and bosses would be inefficient to not use piety.   
---
    
---
I would absolutely recommend piety, but if you're poor and like grinding monsters / slayer, you might consider only using the +10% strength prayer. You only need to be earning / make about 200k an hour for that to be more efficient than no prayer.
---
I think the best way is to just increase the PJ timer. I don't mind clans, I mind the 1v1 mechanic being abused how it is. I think giving slightly more time before you can be attacked by another player would balance it out.
---
Surelycyou mean a huge bird
---
Bruh why not just do them all ffs lol zulrah is so easy xD
---
See, this I dont understand.
---
That content was introduced to bring activity into the wild. It was meant as a risk vs reward type of thing.
---
You are NOT forced into the wilderness, you do it by choice...knowing that the content you want to participate in, is camped by pkers as it was intended to be.
---
Using that as a reasoning to not having pvpers decide on pvp content, is heavily flawed.
---
nice, but maybe it should be venezuelans instead
---
also add something about master farmers for ppots to the thieving part instead of just ardy knights?
---
Agreed. But also I don’t think I’d play osrs without runelite
---
No, we want ground items/a few menu swaps/qol stuff, not macros.
---
Goodbye
---
I can not describe how excellent i feel that this movie is being memed right now.  May god bless osrs with his noodly appendages.
---
Its not easy to find pkers. Most will kill pkers and pvmers/skillers. Yea, you'll always have a select few that will target pvmers/skillers, but thats why the wilderness bosses and skilling areas exist...
---
Risk vs reward...
---
Hurry buy out all the porstelyte before it’s too late!! #stonks
---
Completely agree. Just started to really level prayer lately, and found the alter to be extremely xp rewarding but every single run I’m getting killed. I’m level 122 and seeing level 126 complete maxed accounts killing people here, every single world
---
Just get 99 farming, it shouldn't take too long ;)
---
Well he did about 4200 kc per king for 12k at least there. The kc was what he got pet at. Not what he has done total.
---
And I know a very good way for new players to practice PvP. They can kill people doing PvM in wildy and use a low risk gear. But now everyone here are calling people like that "brainlets".
---
Problem with that, bh and pvp worlds are overly laggy and complete garbage.
---
No...
---
This is normal. There is a CC for it.
---
Sorry he doesn't have the elastic vocal range of Tim Allen, cowboy.
---
The wilderness did well because people were noobs and idiots, both PKers and non-PKers. Nowadays we're all skilled, even the noobiest of players, compared to how we used to be or how players just were in general back then. The average player went from being a kid or young teen to being a college student or working adult. The wilderness will never have the same feel it did back then when the game was thriving off people who had no idea what anything did or where to go, and the wilderness was this mysterious wasteland to explore.
---
The game needs to be designed for this modern playerbase who has a wiki at their fingertips and a host of youtubers and twitch streamers to watch, not for a bunch of dumb kids who wander into the wildy regardless of the risk to reward ratio or frustration that may come from dying.
---
But the dev just said that they (jagex) were okay with it.
---
I'm not picking sides (not enough info) but the dude clearly said a member of Jagex said it, not a client dev.
---
Reddit reports 93% up votes for me which is very non-controversial in terms of reddit
---
i salute osb. i hope they make even more op plugins so jagex cant just stand there and let this happen. there has to be a point where they ban third party clients. and that day will be a good day.
---
Fuck off cunt
---
How do you check?  
---
At the start it was constantly up and down. And not just upvote refresh lag either, but now it seems pretty upward.
---
? I'm asking what your most likely predictions would be
---
I mean, if you're new to it its not that easy. Once you're farming it you do all for sure, but if its for diary and you've never done it before, should probably just memorize one of the rotations and then hop till you get that one.
---
Pls dont fish for gp
---
It's not allowed though. This is clearly breaking the rules, the OSB devs are even reassuring the players that Jagex can't detect them (clearly recognizing their rule breaking)
---
Where did you get that from?
---
I'm interested, which bosses/content would be near impossible to complete without safespots?
---
warding
---
Nothing. 
---
Song of the Elves hardly had an impact and if it didn't then this likely won't either.
---
Jod Med

All the people downvoting are probably from clans. I myself was in a fairly big singles team (15+ members during big focuses usually) because if you can't beat em, join em. It was so pointless when we'd focus someone in mystics just for a chance to get their smite. Everytime I get clanned now (risking basic mystics), unless I have a few friends online to get a box, I immediately drop my imbued cape, lava whip, and bgloves and just sip my restores. I don't want to waste my 2.5-5 mins just to escape with 300k in gear, especially since it's just not fun (unless doing a tank test, which is very fun). 
---
The most annoying part is how people taunt you for not "tanking". Like no shit dude I can't tank 20+ people when I 1. Can't see who's going to attack me and with what and 2. I don't want to waste 5 mins trying to lose a tb. 100% for a PJ Timer.
---
How? By making it easier to have actual 1v1s? I love singles pking. I hate clans in singles. It's singles for a reason.
---
OSbuddy also added one click blackjacking?? Is it behind a paywall?
---
I just hit 75 rc, is it better to use giant pouch + large pouch or should I be using all 4 pouches? This question goes for both ZMI and dorito runes.
---
If you use mousekeys you can use your keyboard and switch hands too.
---
I don't think that'd even be OP. If the other target isn't attacking you for 10 seconds waiting to claw spec, then you by all means should be able to just log or barrage and log. Having a 7 second timer would still equate to singles teams doing what their doing, albeit waiting longer.
---
To be fair there are a few pvm related items that pkers should get. Barrows gloves, heavy ballista, barrelchest anchor(60atk pures), fire/inferno cape, void (elite reqs a diary as well).
---
About time Jagex takes PvP matters into their own hands. Spite voting has gone way out of hand, game is easy enough as is and people will still whine about getting killed in the wilderness. Just get good or stay out of the wild. And I say that as someone who plays exclusively HCIM nowadays.
---
Plz ade a mandatory 10m risk in coins from every non pvper entering the wilderness plz thanks would balance oht  the wilderness
---
Well its only for entertainment. I found it fun, especially the amazing cosplay.
---
WOW

*[ate]*
---
Try scouting a raid without a 3rd party client
---
1 input: 1 output is not server packages, it's user interaction. 
---
I'll go ahead and package up walking to a spot, clicking on it to grab stuff, walking back and banking. But it's not cheating because it's just one packet

The combat triangle is fine, black d'hide is maybe a little bit imbalanced in terms of magic defence but that's it.

Dam that RNG roll on those 5 curved bones

Lol you telling me that was funny. I am loling so hard right now. This is funny. Op is such a big stupid dumb dumb. Lol!
---
I thought that was his shtick, how bad he was at everything.
---
But seeing him destroy computers every now and then was fun.
---
I literally don't mind getting clanned to death at all, in multi. When I'm in singles, I only want 1v1s,and if people get the advantage of being able to tag team me, then I should at least have the benefit of being able to see what the fuck is happening or have more than a couple seconds to see who's up next.
---
As a PvM-er, if this goes through, I will want that PvPer won't vote on PvM content. Let's make rev caves non-wilderness, because it is PvM content for example.
---
Or let's just say: skillers cant vote about combat skills, while thos who don't have enough total level can't vote on skill content.
---
BS... don't restrict. Never. EVER.
---
wooowwwwww
---
yeah that's a biiiig no for jagex dawg
---
people think the swaying beer thing is actually funny?
---
Time to finish that 91 thieving grind before Jagex comes out and makes them stop.
---
OSRS Needs an addon system like wow. That would solve 3rd party clients and their bad standard client in one single move.
---
Not trying to start a fight here but I don't really see how this is much different than the menu entry swaps. Like yes, I read the argument that it results in less left clicks vs a right click. But does that distinction really mean anything?  
---
also pretty sure this can't be detected on Jagex's end, like most 3rd party plugins. So it's hear to stay unless 3rd party clients get banned or Jagex makes OSB remove it. But even if the latter happens, I bet open source clients will pick it up now that the idea is out
---
Black chins are fun
---
soap, heard about it?
---
Skilling will never be valuable for real players because it's too easy to bot.
---
Not to mention those features are already available in other clients.
---
I know this is kind of off the subject, but do you have any sources for the Lou Reed claim? He's one of my favourite artists and I've never heard any of those accusations. Many of his songs are about his friends who were part of the lgbt community at the time.
---
Take it u bought it at 1b+ ?
---
Will i get banned if i use the bones feature?
---
correct
---
It was just a very nice to use client imo, had a bunch of useful plugins, but nothing too op. (Even standard runelite we have now is much much more op than runeloader was)
---
My friend got scammed £60 for a festival ticket. Funnily enough, he has never played runescape
---
More and more people are doing tob, it's not hard to find a team I do 16-20 a day with randoms. There are more important things to adreas then the scythe price, accept the fact you bought a neich item and lose gp. 
---
If it's such a good item, dont sell it and you will never lose money.
---
u dont kill the lv 28s?
---
Gloves fall under armo(u)r, not weapons, but the gloves are under the weapon tab
---
Got my pet on 4kc from this dude lol
---
Meh. I don't give a fuck honestly. I loved old runescape. That game hasn't been recognizable for years.
---
altscapers have a pass
---
I'd definitely take that SC over that nissan
---
What's Karma about that
---
I usually do but cannoning the guardians is pretty fast and good xp. Unless you're a dumbass like me who passes out and dies ;)
---
And yet you still spite voted no to LMS updates, a minigame in which PvPers fight other PvPers.
---
What argument do you have for the whiny manchildren of this subreddit spite voting no to cosmetics or QoL items that change literally nothing for their "odds of survival" in the wilderness? You have none. Your sanctimonious wall of text applies to **literally one item polled**: The elder maul attachment. A niche item that is virtually never used outside of PvP worlds.
---
I'd have to reiterate that it's this toxic subreddit that's responsible for the spite voting, and not PvMers as a whole. You are not voting "in your best interest", you are voting against people that engage in gameplay you don't like. You and your ilk are spite voting, plain and simple. I at least have some respect for the ones that are honest about it, rather than going through painful amounts of mental gymnastics to act as if your votes are not dictated by anger and spite for a segment of players you don't like.
---
Ouch I agree with ya though they need to either lower blood runes required for charges or just make it a more rare drop at Tob. Shame how hard it's dropped defo need more places to use it.
---
No it was he snitched on "Errbody"
---
Why would I tele to my house to use a portal there?
---
I guess so
---
Menu swapping feels more similar to prayer flicking in that it adds to what you can do with the game rather than having the game essentially played for you like this does, which detracts from the game. 
---
It really does save the wrist when alcing without speeding any exp rates up though.
---
Just a year and a half ago there were a lot more unseemly missing chunks like that

im Aussie so i currently cant use world 416 because i lag too much and it makes theater unbearable, idc about the money i lost lets get that straight, i can easily make it back, the point im trying to make is that its such a good item but far too cheap for what it does thats all :)

go to single cb dumbo

You probably think the crab memes are funny you uncultured swine
---
My exact same journey, except I'm going to keep playing on mobile. I'm a bit over 1600 total and like 239 QP, with a ~350m bank.
---
Not bad for 11 months I think.
---
You what? Menu-entry swapper lets you do multiple actions with one click. It has massive effects on xp/hour, with the Chaos Altar being the best example.
---
It does fuck-all for alching.
---
OSB is trying to be a martyr and trying to get all 3rd party clients banned by doing this.
---
Is that solo kills?
---
No I was with three other people
---
Chin the weakspots, like the commander's hatch, engine deck or driver's hatch.
---
The rest also help kill pvmers. More accurate occult means higher freeze rate, higher tb rate, higher entangle rate. The magic spec weapon just gives another attack style to be careful of getting KOed by.
---
Would that mean that you could get around AHK by having e.g. 1 be right click, 2 be move down the mouse X pixels and 3 be left click? Technically you're doing 1:1 actions but you can execute those three actions flawlessly.
---
I guess if 10/20 people all created 28 entities in the same area that might be too taxing
---
But how do the artillery guys get such a huge minimap?
---
PKing on standards with orbs would need 3 spaces instead of 7, which makes it a more attractive option and makes PvMers more likely to get TBed. Magic cape reset tokens would have the same effect.
---
Rofl, ever tried 44s? It's all single teams

Yeah 10k in bonds is gonna make woodcutting, mining, and agility way faster

Permanent unlocks are few and far between in OS. Once you've completed a diary, you get one piece of equipment and, even at the highest level, usually carries about the same stats as addy gear. Aside from that, you have god books - a one-time investment for infinite books of the same type, but none of them have substantial stats. I don't see an untradable twisted bow ever being possible, no matter the cost or limitations.
---
Well yes, that’s exactly how mousekeys work.
---
ye lets just ignore the past 3 years of nonstop ironman catered updates and past 5 years of anything, but pvp updates. and you actually have the audacity to cry about pvp being catered to lmao.
---
PvPers are also more afraid of change. Back when I was in a clan almost all changes where complained about and deemed stupid, and I agree. Imo PvP is in a good spot right now, except for exploits like keeping your loot at death or dropping ornament kitted dragon defenders to not lose them, and maybe more wildy content like the bosses. Contrary to popular belief many pvmers consider these bosses fun and tanking a pker or even anti pking to be the main part of the fun.
---
This is still a case of menu entry swap. Which has been around for ages now isn’t all entry swap not 1:1?
---
I agree
---
See, this mentality is disgusting. It’s just pretending the issues aren’t issues. Art is a result of the creativity of the individual - if the individual turns out to have the moral compass of a fucking wasp, what integrity does their art have? It’s a lie. I’m sure catholic priests have helped a couple people, but what about the children they abuse on the daily? You’re just justifying being ignorant to the evil in the world because they made a couple nice sounds.
---
Are you really going to say that outside of clans and edge fights, 90+% of wilderness pvp is not pker vs pvmer?
---
The quest to get that head was unBEARably easy
---
Menu entry swapper also saves multiple inputs. But imo it's more fair because we should be allowed to swap menu entries in the main game.
---
Just use runelite
---
But wouldn't it allow a lot more solo pkers to hunt at rev caves without being piled by clan pkers?

It was only priced so high for so long because TOBers were the only ones who could afford to and justify its use. Now TOB is becoming more mainstream the price is balancing out to where it should be. Not worth more than twisted bow because what you keep failing to understand is that its a niche item.
---
Nah we should just not allow "pvmers" (aka casuals who are proud of killing jad) to allow on content that doesn't affect them. Doesn't make a fucking difference whether a salad robe warrior has a VLS or not cause you retards will die to him anyway but you'll vote no either way cause you have no idea what's best for the game. That said, I don't even PK. If you don't realize this game is completely dead without pvp though I feel bad for you.
---
Yeah I use it because Runelite causes a screen freeze on MacOS.
---
The OGL bug is most likely a MacOS problem not a RL one.
---
I'm really confused as to how you showed jmods the left click only blackjacking and they said it's fine. That plugin was banned of runelite months ago.
---
Yeah, when I see this, I dont want these things to be banned, I want it in the real game.
---
Both that and left click bone offering are cheating IMO
---
Tell me what piece of content is in the wilderness that is an absolute must for all players to progress in the game? As far as I’m aware there isn’t anyway.
---
Left click use of bones is cheating too. Has jagex made a statement on this?
---
Ah yes because a "swift blade" (literally only useful in ToB) fits perfectly thematically
---
What gear were you wearing that's crazy
---
That doesn't make gloves a weapon, every game considers gloves as a part of the armor
---
There's functionality in EVERY client to do it so what's your point. It still has to be coded and added. It's not just a simple swap the menu edit. It's menu swapper + a completely unique menu option that performs extra actions for you..
---
That could be a fix. Especially when you can safespot bosses. But, it's the Wildy for a reason. There's a great saying: "Battles are just the bloody afterthought to the moves you've already made." Even if a person dies in real life by a stray bullet (nothing malicious or intentional), it's still THEIR fault. They weren't in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were in the RIGHT place at the WRONG time. Just because you're unlucky doesn't mean you didn't deserve it. "Luck favours the prepared man."
---
Tick abuse exists-&gt; exp rates are inflated for sweaty nerds-&gt; jagex won't add new training methods because better exp + tick manip = incredibly op-&gt; normal players are pissed-&gt; if they can't have decent exp rates they'll use anything to make it less of a grind.
---
"Software that generates input to our game applets. This includes software that automatically moves the mouse pointer or generates mouse clicks or key presses."
---
If your macro is 1:2, you're basically generating a mouse or key press. Which is against the rules.

dont care about spoilers. is there any way to do quick elf tasks now?
---
I tried I just keep getting "no available raids to spectate at this moment"
---
 Lukewarm take: its ok to vote no to content you don't like
---
The biggest problem people have, at least from what I see here, is the  PKer vs PvMer interaction.
---
Why not incentivise skulling and killing other players with skulls by adding extra rewards from a special droptable. Killing unskulled players will not grant additional rewards.
---
Ofcourse you have to be very careful with this, because it could be easy to abuse. Maybe add something like an EP system for this, the more time you spend in the Wilderness skulled, the more chance of receiving extra rewards?
---
Just a few ideas.
---
Same account, same game, different interface.
---
I can’t believe people do lavas over steam.
---
&gt;If PvMers could hold a vote to ruin PvP permanently... a substantial number of them would vote to do so.
---
Nah. I fucking love the Chaos Altar. I love how it makes me feel like shit, I love that I have to pay attention to the minimap at all times and be fast as fuck. The Altar and black chins are everything I want from the wilderness: You constantly paying attention to get the logout while getting the highest reward.
---
The wilderness should not be safe. I don't "feel the experience" of the wilderness when I bring 3 items for a clue. Death has no consequences except waste 2 minutes at most. But at the Altar? Dying costs me \~15 minutes of killing dragons. It costs me prayer exp.
---
Ayye a hell of a grind, hopefully pet will pop up! and good luck to you too matey!
---
Oh fk you are right
---
Well there was that underage case so it's probably been in his best interest to cooperate for some time now.
---
Quote by Mod mat K; "The answer to AHK is that if you use it you run the risk of being banned. Although in the past you have heard people quote an 1:1 rule, this is not nor has ever been true. It is a myth that many people (including Jmods) believed and as such was propagated as fact. It is not a fact.
---
Yeah I'm assuming that there will be accelerated xp rates similar to dead man. If there isn't then yeah you are probably right lol. I guess it all comes down to how jagex will handle it
---
r/karmaroulette

Just drop them? They're worth nothing. Plus I'm fairly sure they need to be unoted to charge sceptre (I could be wrong)

It could be undetectable sure. But noone 0.2Ticks bones on an altar, even the most efficient people most often can not keep a consistent 1T for that matter. Wouldn't be hard to detect people spam clicking altar at all.
---
Woah, livin' on a prayer!
---
Is this the new OSB fishing plugin?
---
That’s awesome. Glad you’re enjoying the game.
---
Because it's incredibly unrealistic
---
That's called EasyScape. The wilderness is a place where ANYTHING goes. Whether someone pretends to be the lever to the mage bank, or a clan hopping worlds. NO ONE told you that you HAD to go into the Wilderness for ANYTHING. YOU chose to. YOU are responsible for your actions, not Jagex or any PKers.
---
Don't bring months of progress into the wilderness. If you bring something, be prepared to lose it if you fuck up.
---
It's a meme because it's real. You start to notice a lot of maxed players who fuck around in the game most days.
---
Alright
---
Depends on the boss. Inferno is definitely designed with safe spotting in mind. Wilderness bosses isn’t but they realise people wouldn’t do them without it. Also some objects you can range behind but some you can’t.
---
well you do have to go in there if you want to get items that are only obtainable there such as god capes and god capes (i)
---
That was the regulation you proposed, not me. 
---
Speaking as someone who has been abused and depressed most of his life mental illness is the individual's responsibility, nobody else's. You seem to think when an individual fails their responsibilities that that responsibility transfers to someone or something else, it doesn't and shouldn't. 
---
Everyone needs to suffer the consequences of their choices, otherwise society becomes a devouring mother, controlling and twisting lives, eroding free will while calling it love and protection. That includes businesses, I'm no lover of corporatism.
---
mmos arent weak to power creep, youre just thinking of wow. and the dumbest part of wow is how you have to basically restart every expansion because your old gear is now shit. think about it this way- if youve grinded to be the no.1 xp/hour ever recorded, its crazy, youve got carpel tunnel and shat yourself, shits wild, and then a new method comes out that beats your recorded at a bare minimum. that shit sucks. its the same way wow works with gear (you grind for months with 50 other people to get a single drop and then its worthless the next time you pay $50). and besides, once theres been 10 years better skilling methods and you get 99 in 10x less time, where do you go from there? increase the level cap? level 999? what about lynx titan and everyone else who specifically grinded 200m, sucks to be them i guess.
---
 again, i agree that theres a tendency for people to be too elitist in this community, but theres also a tendency for people to want everything given to them for no effort, when thats dumb as hell

That’s when you know it’s bad
---
I dont see how getting skulltricked is anyone others fault than yourself, especially with all the current antiskulltrick updates added, you only skull if you attack someone who hasnt attacked you, you could even put auto retaliate on and player attack options off to be extra safe, you can prevent yourself being skulltricked but in some cases you can't prevent getting ran over.
---
you could watch videos and practice switching prayers on your client but yeah, that'd be nice.

Tfw pvpers constantly shit out the "don't go into the wildy if you dont want to" and then they are SHOCKED that people vote no to content that will make them do something they don't wan to even more.

Go deep on pvp worlds and bh. The pvp timer ruons those sweaty singles clans. Saying you cant learn is a lazy excuse.
---
How would you do herblore?
---
Your whole comment is rendered invalid because you incessantly refer to tick manipulation as 'tick abuse'. You seem misguided.
---
Tick manipulation is a game mechanic. Unintended when the methods were first discovered all those years ago maybe, but now supported by Jagex. It's part of the game. You can choose to learn the methods and do them, or not. You can't 'abuse' a totally legit game mechanic.
---
You can abuse a 3rd party client plugin however, if it changes core mechanics of the game (like right click menu orders or left click options) that are not already possible in the game. 
---
Imho you should be banned for using a plugin like this.
---
Done a few quests now, combat level is 32. Man I forgot how often you run out of stamina..  On rs3 it's just too easy to get anywhere quickly
---
No, you don't. Just because it's an option doesn't mean you have to do any of it. If I left a $100 bill on a table and said "anyone could have it". Just because you decided that that money could help you, does not mean you HAD to take it.

have a 3x3 poh layout but the outside grass border is one wide on two of the sides but two wide on the other two sides. have tried adding and deleting rooms to try and get the entire border to be one wide but it hasnt worked. anyone have any ideas?
---
While I hate the wilderness and all it’s bullshit, what I’m really upset about is this notion that PvMers shouldn’t have a say in anything regarding it either. You keep dragging players who don’t have any interest in PvP into an area that puts themselves at risk, and then berate them when they offer their opinions.

runescape hasnt had game integrity since 2004 when the chinese picked it up to make their rice
---
Set some goals, a lot of the game is working your way towards being as efficient as possible, unlock teleports (Fairy Tale Part 1 and the beginning of Fairy Tale Part 2 is a good start, there are tons of fairy rings around runescape).  
---
As you begin to level up certain skills, look at the next upgrade that'll give you more xp or a sustainable moneymaking method. Sometimes those upgrades require a certain teleport or quest complete in order to do that upgrade efficiently. If you don't have the requirements for the quest, start on the skill you need to level up and try to do the quest/method that levels up that skill the quickest.   
---
An example would be leveling up your combat through slayer, you're starting to hit a point where you need to use protection prayers for the task or it'll take forever. So you look into prayer potions which require 38 Herblore, but man oh man, ranarr herbs cost like 7K each and you don't want to go broke, BOOM, farming but oh wait, the seeds for ranarr are 56k, YIKES, but alas, you can get seeds as a rare drop from pickpocketing master farmers (along with various other seeds to help with farming) but zzz wouldn't it be nice is you can pickpocket more seeds at once? Well you can by getting the Rogue set from the Rogues' Den minigame, but oh ho ho, in order to access the Rogues' Den you need 50 Agility too!  
---
I could get more specific with each skill, but by setting the goal of simply making prayer potions, you can literally learn and level up Herblore, Farming, Thieving and Agility. Most of the stuff in this game is like that and there are quests that give you xp that you want to level up those skills.   
---
Sorry for the long post and have fun with the game, it's an adventure, a grindy one but it's so fulfilling finally being able to do something after grinding it out (Like making that prayer potion ;) )

Gratz hombre

Jokes on you, I always play Dark Souls offline!
---
So uh, you gonna post a link?
---
The amount of timers an average third party client user is keeping track of would be completely impossible for a person to do manually. You would be spending all of your time starting and resetting stopwatches if you tried to keep track of half of what Runelite or OSB does.
---
I don't think it's so much spite votes as it is that people participating in other content in the wilderness aren't so keen on giving the attackers an edge in any way. And unfortunately the people doing other content vastly outnumber the PvP community. Any PvP related content that is polled normally that doesn't provide anything to other players of the game are pretty much doomed to fail, as while not everyone would be voting no, a large enough number of players who don't wish to make it harder to survive in the wild will be.
---
If this is how you feel the main game should be then great, make a suggestion, get the attention of jmods and the community. Have it go to poll, have it be implemented in the main game. Until then it doesn’t matter if you feel you should be allowed to do it or not, as it is not part of the main game.
---
Understand that you are using a 3rd party program to interact with the game in an unintended way. Time advantage gained or not, feeling it should be allowed or not, this is an unintended manipulation of the game from a 3rd party program.
---
This is the same self justification botters use to validate cheating in the game. They feel like they should be given the rewards others have achieved without putting in the same amount of effort. This is 1:1 with the belief the main game should allow 3rd party clients to circumvent established methods.
---
I'm terrible at math but why wouldn't "droprate" be 1/15k?
---
I can guarantee the same fuckers that went through dark souls un humanitied are the same people that vote no to wildy updates
---
Cheating in any online game is bad ruining high scores and other people achiments seeing bots with 50 mill rc xp is sad why even play a grind game if you do not enjoy it.
---
Just always vote no to PvP polls.  It's how I combat "PKers."
---
Things of that nature have been in the third party clients for a long time though. You've been able to left click bones in a PoH for years now, and not only does that remove a click but it makes accidentally burying impossible.
---
I play runescape 14 hours a day what am I going to get sentenced for, shitting my pants?

You aren't forced to risk months of progress, so why are you intentionally bringing months of progress out there to be risked and lost? 
---
That's your own decision to lose that progress, not the PKers. 
---
You don't stick your hand in fire and expect to not be burnt, and you sure as hell don't do exactly that and get mad that you got burnt despite knowing what can happen.
---
I seriously do not understand what it is you're trying to argue here. It is my fault if i hypothetically get pked? Uh, maybe, what does that have to do with anything? The point is that i do not want to get pked at all, as that is an activity i have little interest in. Yet it is something i am FORCED to do, and do not say i dont have to go into the wilderness cause i really do not care to have that moronic discussion for the 1500th time. 
---
Now for the last time, you're not addressing my point. Your enjoyment comes at the cost of my enjoyment, while the reverse is not true. Why in the world would i want that? Its like walking up to someone and saying "hey can i kick you in the balls real quick, i'd really find that fun" except i fucking wouldnt enjoy it, fuck off.
---
Clear DNS cache, jagex has a page on how to do it
---
I'm glad someone understands what I'm talking about.
---
bro you dont learn how to pk while in the wildy, that's like studying for the test 2 minutes before taking it.  you're fucked
---
But then you don’t get to downvote his comments.
---
If you know that you can get jumped by a clan, you should assume you're going to be jumped by a clan every time you go in. 
---
You know the risk.

i have 15 jobs and 34525 children i dont have time to train thieving.
---
Surely Mtx has to be bad for long term profit, right? Like you'll make money in the short term, but it kills the game in the long term?
---
But then he'll make yet another garbage throwaway account.
---
That's the problem. They developed Jagex bot detection. They know the loopholes.
---
I've suggested this and they talked about it on livestream. But... Engine work it's not yet possible. But might be in the future.
---
I only head into the Wildy for clues, that's it.  I bring one item, and like 50k worth of shit I don't mind losing.  I always have the logout screen ready, soon as I see a dot I'm gone.  Only time I've gotten caught up is training pray at the Altar, but even then I only took 1 invo at a time, most I lost was like 250k of frost dragon bones.
---
1 year 9 months!
---
just because something affects you, doesn't mean your opinion is more worthy. game balance should be left for people who have a deep understanding of the game - not the current emotions of either party regarding how they feel about it.
---
which is why the council would need to have both expert overall players &amp; expert pkers. 
---
but most importantly, updates need to consider every aspect of pvp, not just some certain parts of it.  
---
for example in the entangle argument, regular spellbook desperately needed the buff because of pker vs pker scenarios, which are far more common than when solo pkers hunt pvmers. also, as we've had the magic cape perk in the game for years now, you can actually teleblock someone &amp; switch to ancients 5 times a day - so buffing the regular spellbook would at least give you a fighting chance if you're not using magic cape or if you're out of charges.
---
naw man those people who risk 20k unskulled deserve to get fooled and killed for everything. fuck them, you have a pj timer in pvp worlds.
---
Ty!!
---
Power = good
---
Thank ya :D
---
Ur mom = good
---
Yeah, but things didnt change for the wilderness.
---
But yeah we should change the entire wildnerness because it hurts peoples feelings when they die.
---
I guess your lucky death mechanics "changed" too.
---
Um... i can play through all of dark souls content without ever dealing with pvp, without even disabling online play too.  Also theres no "reward" to being invaded other then high end spells, which you cant use without a highly specialized build, and theres no reward to getting gang beat by salad robed 12 year olds.
---
This comparison doesnt hold water.
---
So few ironmen actually manage 1:1 ehp on cml so i wouldn't worry. If you can play 12 hours in a day and get 6 ehp (skill depending) you're doing alright
---
They alsonhave the banking restrictions of UIM.
---
How do you test it? Doesn’t appear in my plugin list
---
Dude you aren't wrong. Last few times I wandered into the wilderness it was a big deal. I ran around (having not been there for like 13 years since I stopped playing in high school) and the longer I went without seeing anyone the more freaked out I got. I repeatedly stumbled upon the remains of fresh kills left by pkers but never saw a single person. It was fuckin eerie. It wouldn't be the same without that risk of death and honestly horror movie feel of waiting for the boogeyman to come get me at any second.
---
They were both active anti-fascists militants. One of them was responsible for the organization of the communist youth, with over 500 members at the time. He had a lot to snitch about. His father was also arrested and tortured some decades before so he could even have snitched on his own family

I mean yeah, pretty hard to have not heard of him at this point

Honestly didn't know this - thank you! Only picked up OSRS a month ago so a lot of my ideas are still based on stuff from playing RS2 10 years ago.
---
while we're at it delete the tree by the fairy right
---
The people who support these cheatclients actually think this as "QoL"
---
it was a non-binding referendum, either way david cameron fucked up.
---
Do all the quests. Some of them will give you very good xp to skip the slow lower levels.
---
How do I test it? Doesn’t appear in my plugins list
---
If you actually look at what they say, they said they told jagex about it. They have never once stated they got the go ahead, just the fact they didn't receive a no (because jagex can't answer yes or no from how they talk on Twitter ).
---
They aren't necessarily lying, just wording it in a way that is very easily misinterpreted. They have been asked 4 different times in this thread alone if they actually received an Okay from jagex/whoever and every time they ignore the question or state the same "we weren't told not to". Just because you're not told no, doesn't mean it's a yes. Jagex has already made clients like Runelite and even osb remove wayyyyy less powerful plugins.

Is he one of those insane black Israelites?
---
Yeah I considered the second one after, y’know, all my gold was gone. Lol, bye bye 65m/340m
---
"To kill PvM players in wildy".
---
Nobody gives a fuck whether you Pk, PvM or grind clues, all they wanna do is kill someone and if you're there then rip you. The people who DO camp PvMers and skilling spots are generally new pkers.
---
I don’t know if this was some kind of pathetic attempt at bashing America but ironically enough this guy is Spanish/Puerto Rican...
---
I had no idea you could do that. But if you get hacked WHILE playing, you're fucked. Pretty big security breach.
---
Bold of you to assume he’s a bot
---
You're right, that's why Jagex needs to fix their own client and get the necessary QoL like bank value, True GE value, text over items, gpu/rendering, etc.
---
The only move is to name yourself "Whip me daddy"
---
Well I guess we will just see what Jagex says. At the end of the day, it’s just a game, and anything that makes the game more enjoyable and less stressful for me to do in my free time, seems fine with me as long as it’s within the rules of games🤷🏽‍♂️
---
get range mage up and zulrah or get range up then go vorkath. blast furnace is decent money if u want to train smithing, otherwise barrows is one of the better options for your stats.
---
You know as an ironman if jagex could reward me for killing someone maybe I would try to. But man when I all want is a pet/d dick/Ward and some dude comes around risking fuck all disturbing my grinds it is really fucking annoying lol
---
Coerce, as if it's bad to pl SMH
---
Seen a lot more MTX RS3 posts these last couple of days, has something crazy happened over there or something?
---
Is it still there?
---
f2p sucks all I can say
---
Couple of months with regular tree runs
---
Hello, I’m a member again after finally affording another bond (thanks wines of zamorak). I’m training mining and smithing so I’ve been doing motherlode mine and the best furnace to skill train and make decent gold out of it. I wanted to look into blast mining but my attack strength and defense are barely over 40. Would it be worth it for me to venture to Kourend and grind the favor needed to use blast mining? And if so is there any hints or tips y’all would find helpful? My mining is 74 and smithing 67 if that means anything.
---
ye because skilling is so fun
---
Omg dude rip. I can't even imagine the feeling
---
This isn't Rs3 and like I said it doesn't take more than two seconds to check to see if an ad comes from a real source or not.
---
I'm not saying the wilderness needs to change, i'm saying they should stop forcing people who dont want to be there, to go there. 
---
Honestly i find pkers that hunt pvmers pathetic, i play alot of csgo, it would be as if i played against players using knives only, and i go "yeeeah, i'm so cool gunning these noobs down with my AK!" they're literally not equipped to fight me, why the fuck would i get any enjoyment out of that. The enjoyment comes from being better than the other player, meaning pker vs pker. Which is what the design philosophy should be.
---
I think that the current death mechanics exacerbate the problem. You don’t risk at all anywhere except wilderness and instances anymore. Dying isn’t the punishment it used to be. When we were kids, you were ALWAYS scared to die. You would lose your shit you worked so hard for. 
---
Now there’s this one part of the game where you don’t want to bring risk because you’ll lose it when you get pk’d doing the thing that you were forced into coming there for.
---
Saw this last night. Fuckin great series. One of my favorites for sure.
---
Thanks
---
At the end of the day, it’s a game. Anything that makes it more enjoyable and less stressful for me to play in my limited free time is fine with me, as long as it’s within the rules set by the game. Guess we will just have to see what Jagex says about it🤷🏽‍♂️
---
it doesed whoopdydoo dooes
---
This guy explains quite well why pvmers vote no to a lot of pvp content:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d6vb34/polling_pvp_updates/f0vrkyy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Personally I voted yes to about half the recent pvp poll. I personally disagree with you saying that we are voting for ourselves rather than the wellbeing of the game. Like you said, dying is not fun, if jagex keep on this trend of adding pvm content to the wildy to entice pvmers, it “forces” us to go to the wildy to be competitive. 
---
For example ironman have to go to wildy bosses to obtain bis equipment ie dragon pickaxe and mage arena capes. The wilderness rings are also bis for specific situations. Rev caves are some of the best money makers for mid level players. And if these players feel forced into the wildy to stay competitive... and end up not having fun... they may just quit the game. Is that good for the future of the game?
---
Pvp works well in other games because people want to fight each other. Pvmers generally do no wish to fight pkers. If you’re argument is just to learn to pk... there is a large and costly and unfun learning curve. It’s a game after all, why stay if you’re not having fun?
---
Ripperino 
---
What did you protect? Justiciar helm, legs, and lance?
---
🦀🦀🦀
---
I mean. If they added a requirement to PvP polls that require you to have died to or killed another player it might make these polls less one sided.
---
F2P do the imp catcher quest and the witches potion and it will get you some starter levels.
---
Mate what! The Nissan GT-R is an incredible machine
---
So was g maul
---
I’m in pretty well same boat as you guys just a little further ahead I have 1750 total approx 150m and a quest cape currently grinding for a pet at Zalcano since I have none and I can make bank doing so currently 440 kc
---
Noticeable drops include ranger boots at 33m viggoras mace 60m
---
It's not often people take you through the mental gymnastics they're doing. This is almost funny.
---
Your first sentence kinda seems contradictory though.
---
I also play CSGO, and it is kinda more like smurfing as a direct comparison, but you can't really compare the two games, as the are other elements to it.
---
If you could kill people with pistols with aks to get more money for the next round you totally would.
---
In fact, the entire CSGO game economy is based on trying to wear your opponent down into less useful guns. So I don't know if that supports your point. CSGO is an economy game.
---
I know nothing about pvp so skip all. Easy poll.
---
No, I get that, but eventually the whales move to another game as it dies, right?
---
There is a story here and I would be interested in hearing the whole thing sometime.
---
I guess you weren't around when everyone left. Yes people don't like MTX but the removal of the wilderness and eoc is what made people stop playing. For someone accusing others of rewriting history it's pretty funny that you clearly weren't playing back then.
---
this is a big mood. how i feel mentally
---
Fair point. Personally not a fan of that either, but there is a big difference between making a right click option a left click and creating a new option that effectively runs multiple clicks behind the scenes. Like a left click offer bones or light fire isn't that far off something like making a DDS's left click "equip and activate spec" or making it so when you equip a Blowpipe it turns on Rigour. Granted those require different menus (unless you count spec orb for DDS), but is clicking a blowpipe to equip blowpipe, press fkey, move mouse, click rigour that different to clicking an altar to click bones, move mouse, click altar, and move back?
---
We all need to take some time for a sport stick once in a while
---
So what did Jagex specifically say when you told them you would be introducing these features to your client?
---
Nah none of the current plugins are nearly this OP. This is straight macroing.
---
A staff that absolutely smacks would make it much easier for PVPers to kill PVMers. Right now you wear black d'hide, and pray melee. When you get unfrozen, you can pray mage, since he can't one tick an AGS from 10 squares away.
---
Just like Korasi, it would be hard to pray against getting 1 hit if there was an OP mage spec wep. The solution is to fix the crap that's just not an enjoyable game experience first.
---
&gt;ahk teleporting your mouse down is not allowed if you have multiple distances selected.
---
ahk teleporting your mouse down is not allowed ~~if you have multiple distances selected~~.
---
If you want to map mouse movement to a key (this isn't 1:1 btw) then your only acceptable option is to use your default OS Mousekey program as stated by Jagex.
---
You can remap the controls for WMK, (you are allowed to remap a key to any other button) however, you are not allowed to emulate WMK (with the MouseMove command on AHK or with anything else.)
---
So disabled people can’t play then? Think about it. It’s basically discrimination if they don’t allow it.
---
He is saying out of 300 people who do what you did, 1 will get the pet.
---
That also seems really low tho.
---
That’s what she said
---
if there are multiple people then it isn't an option really
---
Because I find the entire concept of being forced to go into the wilderness ridiculous. It's a part of the game, with the difficulty coming entirely from the PKers. All wilderness bosses can be safespotted, revenants have a 40k item that literally makes them not fight back, black chins let's you place one additional trap everywhere and is 10 steps from the teleport line.
---
Why is everyone okay with difficulty elsewhere in the game, but the moment that difficulty comes from another players it's considered unfair? Is it because it can't be cheesed in some way? 
---
Imagine how ridiculous someone would be if they complained about being forced to waste money learning the Inferno because it's too hard? Actually, there's no need to imagine: we've seen these people and they've been appropriately ridiculed. 
---
The only argument is for HCIM, and that is not an actual argument. Ironmen were never to be catered for specifically (despite that obviously being untrue at this point). This community loves to bring up how pures "choose to limit theirselves" and vote against anything to benefit them, the exact same argument should apply to Ironmen.
---
Preesh mate. Preesh.
---
Game has changed to PVM/boss scape. It's no longer the same game back in 2007 where majority pked for fun. Now it's about efficiency and grind. It's a tough pill to swallow but if the wildy/pking was removed the vast majority would not care in the slightest
---
Left click use is, left click offer on the altar isn’t.
---
looks like it was a practice one so zero
---
This is 2007scape not 2007 memes
---
The game had been bleeding players long before EOC dropped. As I said, it was *one of* the biggest reasons.
---
Got void top and robes, just need gloves and range/mage helm now and I can finally climax
---
Its not great, not terrible. Its pretty good.
---
Dont care virgin
---
How big are your triceps?
---
Yeah it's not faster but it is less prone to user error, which I guess you could argue saves you miniscule amounts of time
---
I think it’s the fact that it takes 50 or so minutes to get there and one misclick makes you start back at square one
---
If you do callisto in singles safespot you have a decent chance of taking out a solo pker. I'm getting downvoted although ive experienced and done this on both ends, being the pvmer and the pker. 
---
Any pker knows that a veracer with vhelm, vskirt and d'hide that is fighting back with ballista can be annoying to deal with. You're quite tanky compared to the risk a pker brings. You also have to be on your toes because you don't know what kind of spec weapon they're hiding.
---
I still can't understand how there are 10 or so of them around every single yew tree on f2p on every server. The amounts are crazy.

Go get Agility 99 &amp; Graceful like a normal OSRS chad (In that order ofc)
---
Slayer tasks
---
after reading these posts the easiest fix i could think of other than just removing all pvm content from wildy is to increase the amount of item saved when not skulled +1, could make it a hard/elite diary reward, also could make untradable pvm items like , slayer helm, salve amulet, barrows gloves behave the same way they do under 20 wildy at 30 or 40. i think these would actually motivate more pvmers into wildy but at the same time making them less inciting of a prey to pvpers, because as a pvmers, believe it or not, i think that pvmers interacting with pvpers could be a healthy thing that would motivate more pvmers to dabble and try pvp
---
&gt;3rd party clients are busted
---
No, busted plugins are busted. Just because OSB pushes it too far does not mean that dozens of other qol plugins should be banned. It means jagex should say "no don't do that" like they did to jad and zulrah plugins.
---
Because the PKers only risk 50k is a stupid argument that has been disproven time and time again. Try and look at PKers elsewhere than Rev Caves and pures fighting in Edge.
---
Girl streamers
---
Combat.
---
adding minigames that give higher xp is how you can have fun getting levels (look at wintertodt) but if you make getting levels easier you have a whole bunch of people complaining because they did it the other way
---
It was changed recently in osrs that you can't release them in combat or something.
---
agility bad thieving bad rc good
---
What do you mean?
---
He said an osb mod, meaning osbuddy mod. I'd wait to hear how Jagex responds to this since "someone from the client said someone from jagex was okay with it that I heard somewhere" is not the same and open to a lot of misunderstanding. As I said, even if OSBuddy made Jagex aware in advanced, inaction from there to say "no don't do that" isn't the same as them saying "we're totally fine with you adding this".
---
So without knowing what the exchange was between OSBuddy and Jagex, I don't think it is fair to infer a stance from Jagex on the matter. Of course, the client would interrupt, or relay, things in a way that benefits them.
---
I'm from Melbourne and atm every world is 200+ ping :C
---
haha she's so cute
---
Turning camera how? I have nexus west and jewelry box east, with a pool on north and south right by the doors. Don’t need to turn camera at all to use either
---
Do you have a link to where a J Mod said that?
---
DS3 was my first play through of the series, and I played it with a purely spellcaster build - finishing the game with like 70 Int, 40 Attunement and 20 stam/vigor. I pretty much used Greater Soul Arrow and sometimes soul lance or W/E in most encounters, occasionally used flash sword versus dogs and fast creatures. 
---
I spent about 35 hours finishing the game through to DLC 2 with probably about 4 hours lost to Midir and sister Fride as they were the most challenging bosses of my play through. 
---
My next playthrough was a Dex run, which took 12 hours. 
---
No help from friends, no item drops, didn't even know you could assist people in-game until I played NG+1 with a friend, although I found it boring as the game is clearly designed around single player for bossfights.
---
Lava eels for another 200k xp or so
---
No, they’ve made it recently that you can’t release them in combat anymore.
---
Same with me. Too bad the majority will never agree
---
👿 did you just anger me, im going to kill you epic gamer style  😎😎
---
Last time I played the bots had bots to make bots. Not just do tutorial island, but get 60wc or whatever and then become dormant. Might be how they keep their numbers.
---
Wish you weren't so fuckin' awkward, bud.
---
But it still acts like a potion? I heard it delayed ur attack now like food.
---
The gap is even wider with the in game player base
---
Or map the same key 1:1 to 19 different actions
---
At this point, jagex is babysitting pvmers with new content with new record gp per hour methods and xp per hour methods in safe zones that only entitles the pvm community. The reason pkers seem so "toxic" is because they are forgotten. Not every pker wants to fight in pvp world or bh world against another pker for minimal risk or agreed high risk pking. Sometimes we like to find casual players who may have more risk and are scared of dying because of the loot they have acquired. The wilderness bosses gave hope to a more populated wilderness until even more OP npcs came into the game that made these bosses useless because the risk was too much for the little gp offered. The only reason to do these bosses is either pet or ironman for d pick. I suggest a quest that unlocks a vorkath/hydra alternative with a unique that resides in a single way combat deep wild area. Many locations come to mind for this that will further populate the wild.
---
notice how the past few day's theres only been 1 buy per day, a merch clan is forcing the price up after buying a great amount of the top. sucks, just trying to vent, i know theres no rule breaking here. same thing happening with 3rd age robes, 80m now and rising
---
Delete and redownload maybe and password reset
---
You used to be able to release them so they couldn’t loot your chins, but they’ve made it recently that you can’t release them in combat anymore.
---
No because there are 2 opposing camps and 1 is far smaller than the other. This small camp will never be able to get anything in their favour because the bigger camp can just say no. That’s why its not fair.  
---
  
---
The pvm camp is going to vote yes on anything that will make the game more interesting, fun, safe, or enjoyable for them, and vote no for anything that may make that harder for them.   
---
As for your callisto argument; a person in 40+ wilderness unprepared for pvp is asking to die. It’s simple as that. These pvp weapons aren’t exclusive to pkers, you can use them too. Maybe adapt and find an alternative method to killing a boss than doing an extremely low risk safe spot with 4 items on. Or even better, if you can’t operate on a level of a pker then just don’t go to a pvp zone. There’s better money makers than callisto, and there’s a grand exchange. Ironmen chose to limit themselves and can live with those consequences.
---
Aww that’s too bad. Love your work by the way!
---
Some people do. I don't to be honest but was just sparking discussion.
---
How did you t-pose in that morytania thumbnail!!!
---
My thought exactly, the majority of the community is on old school to avoid mtx (and nostalgia) and it would be a serious misstep. I can’t imagine profits would increase that much because after a certain point most players would give up and leave.
---
That's right!!! Everytime I chat without my btw crown I feel D E V A L U E D
---
Good luck man!
---
Suicide is bad.
---
Salad robes + rune c bow + a handful of bolts + dds + d hides comes to about 60k. Add some food and pots maybe a glory and you hit close to 100k max.
---
I don’t care to talk to you. Go start a fight with someone else.
---
I remember when you could kill green drags in the wildy for money.  In 2009 or so you'd be there for like 10-15 minutes before anyone showed up.  It was tense, but it was doable.
---
Fast forward to today and now someone will come along within 3 minutes and teleblock -&gt; ice barrage -&gt; gmaul -&gt; dead.  Oh, and fighting back is worthless because they're using a dirt cheap minmax build and you're out here actually trying to PVM.  lmao
---
That number is the number of RuneLite clients open, not the number of players currently in game. My client, which is currently not logged in and not playing, counts towards that total.
---
PvM players form a large majority and can pass or fail any poll they want to as a collective. If you don’t see how starving a whole group of players of content and gameplay will cause them to quit, and the issues that will cause, then I don't think there’s any getting through to you and therefore this council, or Jagex themselves should just retake control.
---
What does HLC mean
---
&gt;	Get ur fat ass over to shamans and grind out dragon warhammer l0l because some dumb jmods thought it was a good idea to make the best spec weapon in the game 1/5k (gee wonder what 4 year old came up with that idea)
---
wait he’s spittin facts tho
---
Ok lol
---
I apologize about being vague. I'm not at liberty to share private communication. 
---
The mousekeys plugin is also safe to use and never removed. Even after the statement that only operating system mouse keys were allowed. 
---
Plenty of stuff has not been added over the years. Like the screen regions plugin or rune sudoku solver because they were not safe to use. 
---
We decide what is safe based on what causes accounts to be flagged as a bot. 
---
Ash recently tweeted that the higher ups are preparing a statement. 
---
We will all have to wait and see what that says. We have the ability to hotfix OSBuddy if needed.
---
It's replacing the action of "right click" "move mouse" "left click". How do you think that's seriously 1:1?
---
What’s removed from the game, some potions and manta rays? You mean the things that were going to be consumed anyways right. The very things that come from the overly saturated PvM tables they were talking about?
---
high level community
---
That's what I'm saying
---
It's 1/5000 tho
---
please dont ask how im t pose in the thumbnail
---
There it is. The typical “blah blah i wanna be efficient” shit where rs players treat this game like a job. So boring . That mindset is certainly reflected on the stagnant game we see today and you hate to see it!
---
Iron men complaining about "having to go into the wilderness" is fking ridiculous. You know what you're signing up for when you start on iron-man account. Why should the game need to cater to a very small portion of the community because they cant be bothered with wildy bosses to get a drop? The wilderness is a massive part of the game. The funny part is I dont even do pvp, but I'm still happy the mods have been updating the content trying to improve it. If an iron man account is upset about having to kill a wildy boss for d pick, they can just use a rune one.

OSB new inventory add-on
---
I'm not arguing that salad warriors risk 100k, I'm arguing that they're a serious minority that exist solely in Rev Caves and as exclusively PVM hunters.
---
If you manage to die to someone in 100k risk, that's a you issue, not a PKer issue.
---
All runelite menu swapping features were in osb first.
---
I think you meant death mechanics buddy. Which we definitely are worse off for having lost.
---
I agree. Im also tired of Jagex dragging pkers to do stupid quests
---
Meh, it’s a fashionscape item that does the same thing as a 7k black d’hide top. 
---
A rising price on that item doesn’t inhibit your ability to play the game. If you got burnt or missed out, that’s just how the market/merching goes.
---
Lmao, that kid isn’t even a remotely hardcore gang banger. The people he had in management were, but they found him working in a deli and decided to use him to make money and in exchange let him claim to be in the gang. 
---
Once he got comfortable in the role he started trying to call shots but he was never anything but a way for the gang to make literally MILLIONS by stealing from him because he was too fucking stupid to look into where his money for shows was going.
---

The fact you would give it if you did is worrying.

Honestly I think it just puts it on par with Ardy Knights. Thieving is such a trash skill from a design perspective tbh. Has anyone ever said "oh thieving, that's my favorite skill!"? Nope, because it's literally just clicking on one spot for hours with no change
---
Yeah this is lime the third one in 24 hrs insane
---
Post your communications and their reply.
---
What's the osrs active playerbase amount?
---
Yep which is why I said active lms world....
---
I don't know of any clients that are faking user clicks (which the new osb plugin does) that are not considered botting.
---
i wouldn’t lol
---
Post what they said.
---
Noones asking for OP items, the elemental runes just save inventory slots and make regular spellbook pking viable vs ancients, you dont need 20 food vs pvmers so thst doesnt even affect pvmers in the wilderness yet got spitevoted no. This topic is about spite voting so updates dont pass for pvpers. Also suggested items like stuff to make d long/d mace a bit more viable/on par with dds isnt OP at all, maybe listen to what pkers actually want instead of those OP items jmods keep suggesting like vesta and korasi
---
Grats! It's nice when two people can make the promise to be together for the rest of their lives and scape without needing to fuck
---
Let me ask you...Did you do recipe for disaster for mith/barrow gloves? Yes? Why not use a combat bracelet when you pk? Oh, its less efficient, is it?
---
Join Only Trails, friendliest cc out there
---
Post what Jagex said, and how you explained it.
---
thank you, very cool
---
The risk isn’t the wildly. The risk is ruining your real life for a never ending game that can be played on a 2002 Gateway PC. That’s what makes scape great
---
You fully deserve to get your drop traded items swiped if you are too lazy to go find a secretive spot to drop trade. It takes not even 2-3 minutes to find a nice spot where no one is at.
---
Safe to use and not cheating aren't the same
---
It's really suspicious when you have to specifically enable them and the plugins have a bright red background. Almost like they're warning you that it's not safe
---
Thats how the game is designed. You click. Just because you don't like the game design doesn't mean anyone should be accepting macroing and faking user input as okay.
---
Then so is being able to change the left-click function of things, to be honest...
---
And not only other clients let you do that, but even the base game features it in PvP.
---
So do we draw the line by arbitrary number of clicks, or actual efficiency improvements + effort input?
---
you do realise that the non-pvp side of the playerbase is vastly larger than the pvp one, right? so if everyone were to vote for their own interests a certain demographic of that playerbase will never see any update pass that is meant for their interests in this game.
---
Shouldn't say shit infront of her tbh &lt;_&lt;
---
86.2 to 88% is the optimal loot potential % for max runes.
---
Yeah what a shitty vague lie.

---
Did not realize that it had been posted a few times already on 2007scape haha. It is pretty cool though! You're welcome!
---
Wow I didn’t realize how many hardcore thugs we had in the runescape reddit to be so against snitching on people who tried to kill you. Such a diverse community!
---

Isn't this kinda similar in how they made you able to click on a range and cook food automatically??
---
&gt; You can't tick eat in PvP 
---
I think he means using karambwans + brews along with food
---
He snorting runite?
---
you're saying it's "right" as in "jagex allows it and won't ban anyone that abuses it"
---
Didn't say menu swappers weren't cheating also ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

We will have a generation who will be addicted to gambling. That's a real issue and I hope they'll ban this accross the globe.
---
Botting is against the rules as long as fucking Jagex doesnt get a piece of the cake.
---
I hope Runelite adds all this too so Jagex has to decide.

For real. This shit is too much

Even if this isn’t on OS, it will still affect us in the long run of the UK government brings the hammer down on Jagex.
---
I mean, even without loss mechanics, any PvP is a zero sum game. Really, anything competitive is. There's always a winner and a loser. Someone feels good and someone feels bad. If it we're about losing items, people wouldn't cite clue hunters as such a particular nuisance. The fact that PKers hardly get anything is a huge meme.  
---
Winning in the context of PK Dynamics doesn't necessarily need to mean killing the other person. Theres plenty of asymmetrical PvP in a number of genres and games. Escaping certain death is a victory in of itself.
---
There are very few other MMOs that don't use ability bars, either.  RS has always thrived on its uniquenesses.  When I was young, and my friend played WoW, and I only played RS, I was actually surprised to see how risk-less death was, and I couldn't understand how combat was compelling when failure had, relative to Runescape, virtually no risk.
---
Of course WoW did other things greatly, like group raiding, but still.  I liked there being meaningful risk to death.
---
These pkers come in groups. They go to rev caves, wildy bosses, they’re at green drags, etc. One TBs, the others have 50-100k risk and rag you to death when you’re low on supplies at a wildy boss or revs or something.
---
It isn’t about not being able to fight these clowns 1v1, that’s easy. That’s why there’s usually 2-3+ of them and they take turns exhausting food and prayer, then hand the fight off to the next player. It’s the fact that they’re so desperate for 50k-200k loot to split 3 ways, that they’ll pull out all the stops to make sure they kill you with every disadvantage possible handicapping you. 
---
The truth is, bringing anti pk gear means you either look for a fight to get maybe 100k loot on a lucky instance of fighting someone 1v1 or you’re sacrificing valuable inventory space that otherwise would help you accomplish whatever you set out to do in the wildy in the first place.
---
All this to say: the bulwark got nerfed because this vocal minority was complaining that players who were able to risk and get away successfully was becoming an increasingly popular strategy that they simply couldn’t combat. God forbid they bring a god sword or any other t70+ weapon that’d actually be a substantial risk in their eyes. 
---
It’s so ironic that there’s all this focus on the argument that PvE players want all reward with no risk — yet when it came to the Bulwark, the only argument anyone had was that it still wasn’t enough money risked for these salad robe pkers to have to fight against. It’s sad honestly how narrow-minded the PvP community is when it comes to this debate — but it’s even worse that Jagex even entertains this group of cry-babies.
---
It isn't yolo; it's safe until they decide it's bannable
---
This, you have game messages filtered.
---
Torvesta has a few videos like that but it’s mostly 2k+ worlds Cus those guys risk bank because they don’t expect to see Pkers. I’d say a majority of his videos are pvp worlds tho.

How to kill a game ft. ignorant reddit people
---
Can't spell Wilderness without Wild. It's a lawless land.
---
Also, how do we make it stop? Because that shit is fucking annoying and worthless.
---
Spite voting exists because people hate dying in the game. I understand it, it's frustrating. The pker usually will talk shit too which adds fuel to the flame. But without content in the wild the game will die.
---
Well yes, that's the point of voting, so your personal long term goals weigh the as mine and anyone else's.
---
Pyramid plunder says hello.
---
F
---
chippity choppity this wc spot is my property
---
It's a term that weebs use to describe mega-weebs. It means you're a lazy fuck that stays inside playing video games and watching anime all day instead of getting a job or looking for employment.
---
&gt;The magic spec weapon just gives another attack style to be careful of getting KOed by.
---
That really shows the problem with people voting for their own interests. One end of the combat triangle isn't allowed to have k0 potential, because that k0 potential could be used against a pvmer. I reckon pkers who kill pvmers will continue to be perfectly fine with ags/claws/ballista and just use barrage for freezes, but the magic spec would have significantly increased the viability of magic focused builds in fair 1v1 pvp fights  
---
I think the most sensible solution is to just make every single hard hitting special attack work in pvp and bh worlds only, which would hopefully eliminate any need for pvmers to vote no to it.
---
Yea I get that, but I thought the meme is that he snitched on Bill Nye or Mod Ash. Like innocent people.
---
No, you only get banned if a streamer calls you out on Twitter.
---
Hey man. You're in the wrong subreddit for this kind of *SLANDER*. osrs be the OG mmorpg
---
So my risk is not being able to fight back because my gear is centered towards fighting the NPC/doing the skilling, and my reward is that barely higher number than outside wildy.
---
Meanwhile the other guy's risk is none at all because I stand no chance as a main versus a minmaxed PK build with PK gear versus my jank, and his reward is the entirety that I carry? (plus the fact that he's full of combat potions, brews and food + tribrid gear, meanwhile I have some food perhaps and nothing to switch to)
---
Sounds good to me, now everyone sit down and wonder why only suicidal daredevils, retards, and PK-ers go to the wildy... 
---
It's a stupid concept and reading other threads with replies from them, even Jagex knows that luring PVM and skillers into wildy does nothing good for the PVP aspect of it.
---
Think u already did
---
That sounds absolutely broken and terrible for quite a few reasons, revs would be beyond packed.
---
Boy I’m 1815 total lvl come get the fade in 1700+
---
I liked ahk because it made stuff like dropping feel smoother. They patched that, and there are enough skilling options that I don't have any other issues, so I likely wouldn't use ahk now even if it was allowed
---
Except in Dark Souls, you can only be invaded if you're human/enkindled. You could go the entire game without using that and never get an invasion. And if you die, you can get everything back, minus your human/enkindled status. OP made an awful comparison.
---
This is funnier than 98.9% of skits on SNL
---
yaaaaaa...... Pools closed due to AIDS
---
Have an 2 alts to keep killing at revs for immunity to pvp, good tradeoff.

Exact same can be said for the inverse

---
&gt;endlessly grind 16 hours a day literally hold the game hostage with "BuT qUaLiTy Of LiFe DeVaLuEs My 200M xP"
---
Or it's the simple fact that unless you're a pker most of this game is based on grinding for achievements be it skills, pets or money. That sense of accomplishment from completing a goal or getting a drop you grinded for is literally the whole game for most players. Nothing to do with people that go for 200ms.
---
You only have to send the use packet once.
---
I discovered this by accident fooling around with runelite. It remembers what item you last clicked on to use on another.
---
i agree with a few exceptions like blackjacking, personally i would still use AHK but way less than before
---
So you're saying that the Wilderness should require using an item to enter (akin to becoming human/enkindled), and if you die, you can get all your items back and you just lose your human/enkindled status?
---
This is such a shitty analogy.

I was curious about your voiceovers. Are most of the lines from your videos recorded during editing or during playtime?
---
There's absolutely no way they would ban a large amount of their players before issuing a public statement/warning. This happened in Guild Wars 2 with dps meters. All the high end raiders started using a dps meter even though it's technically against the rules, so they had to allow it, just like Jagex with clients. When one of the dps meters started breaking the rules, the devs announced you could no longer use it, and didn't start banning people for it for a while after it. This is pretty much the only course of action that Jagex could take that wouldn't cause a massive shitstorm.
---
If I had to blackjack I would, but it's easy enough to just avoid blackjacking.

---
Yeah I never really understood this. Besides multi zones (which imo if you're gangbanged by 4 dudes ofc you shouldn't have a chance to win as one person), the wilderness gives you a massive incentive to fight back. At chins, I bring either tribrid gear or veng gear, and out of 50 times I've gotten attacked I've only died once (75 - 30 ags). The other times I escape or kill them 50/50. If anti-pking tribridding, I bring a tsotd, ags, and either acb/ballista with blessed spirit shield - the other person usually just has an ags and basic mystics setup. If Venging, I bring a msb, heavy ballista, claws, and prims. And the best part? I usually only risk the same amount as them + my chins. 
---
I think if they allowed you to left click only those who attack you first would definitely increase the incentive to fight back. Skulltricking with similar names is just too rampant. Like OP said, just watch Amenity's pking the pkers videos, guy has about 25 of them at green drags/chins, and that was back when Amenity wasn't nearly as good as he is now.
---
Can't Jagex see mouse movements over the client? If so this would be brutally obvious.

Yeah but not osrs. Sure they're are a few that do it. But not many

As they're saying, some of these things are decided in other parts of the company than the osrs team. Ash, Sween or Gambit can't just start giving their opinions about issues everytime someone ask, they don't make that decision anyway, and it'd get rather confusing. Also, changes wouldn't happen faster because of them talking about it.

---
Multi zones- fair point. But you shouldn't get mad nor expect to be able to win when fighting 5 other dudes in multi. Single combat though, dude it's the wilderness - a PKING AREA. Saying you shouldn't bring supplies to anti is like going to demonics and only using melee gear because you're just there to train strength.

If 1:1 was a rule then you could just macro an entire string of inputs to do skilling in your place, and map each input to one "scroll" of a mouse wheel. Then get a wireless mouse with a free rolling mouse wheel, and just walk around the house while spinning the mouse wheel every time it comes to a stop to have all your skilling done effort-free.
---
Or you could just macro an entire skilling script to 1 or 2 keys, have each press do one action or mouse movement, and every time you press the buttons it changes what action it does the next time around, so you could just spam that key/alternate between both keys, and get flawless precision for what should be precise mouse inputs.
---
Just because a script results in 1 input = 1 action doesn't mean it can't give an advantage, and if it gives an advantage then it should be bannable. As simple as that.

Exactly. I'm going to use the blackjack and construction plugin but not the altar as that's clearly more than just menu swap and even though I doubt anybody would get perma ban from it, I just don't want to take that very very low risk of getting even a temp ban for something as easy as prayer.

You “its not natural it loses its natural so and so” 
---
Me “this has nothing to do with natural anything”
---
You “your statement on natural doesn’t hold any value to this conversation” 
---
- That was kind of my implicit point about when you brought it up in the first place 
---
And on the contingent: that is my point, but if it is time then the change needs to happen first. It seems odd that most of your comments in this thread about specific issues with a specific third party plugin are just: A) irrelevant to the conversation about specific plugins on a specific client; and B) are just broad condemnations of 3rd party clients and anything different from vanilla over a decade ago.
---
Fuck you m8
---
well yea theres fundamentally a 1 bone / tick limit, but doing 1 bone / tick consistently, for more than 1 inv, when you have to right click, go down to use, click, go to altar click, go back to inv, for each bone is very hard

on the other hand you can do this with your foot. 
---
you can already just use 1 bone and afk the whole inventory if you dont want to click a lot, you should have to put in the effort for the boost to xp/hr, making it brain dead like this is stupid
---
really sick video. i enjoyed the music a lot as well, more hard dance/hands up stuff pls.

Osbuddy lashing out for getting shafted by essentially a copy of them but for free so they add op plugins to get all clients stripped to dogshit tier like the official client is.
---
I was going to explain to you why your comment shows how you're technologically illiterate, but clicking on your profile revealed that you're a /r/the_donald poster, so there's not much use.
---
Na Jagex can’t afford that kind of monetary investment. Better to just let things get out of hand, stay completely silent on what kinds of plugins are and are not acceptable, and then break down in 6-12 months and completely ban clients forcing people to use the piece of official client and lose half the player base because the official client is practically unplayable.

Use the bird nests on a mortar and pestle to get crushed nests. They sell for 3.6k

yeah, I guess since they're the ones that helped Jagex with the bot detection and know the ins and outs.
---
Exactly lol, Ive just been having the same discussion on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/ZybezWeeMan/status/1175430152760811520?s=19) . The idea that people are forced into the wild is nonsense, either you take the risk for the extra cash and potentially die to pkers or other people at those spots otherwise enjoy yourself literally anywhere else in the game. The PvP community, clans especially, want an active wilderness not because pvmers are free loot but because that's where the action and recruitment stems from. People enter the wild for the extra profit, they get hunted, the people hunting the pvmers get hunted and then so on and so forth. 
---
It's why rev caves was a great update, jagex rewarded the risk and now there's a whole heap of action in there everyday.
---
Forgot to mention I'm a hcim so I cannot just buy the blowpipe.

Last Man Standing. Playable on the beta worlds.
---
I mean yea, but its not worth dropping the entire game I enjoy playing over it. I could live without it if I was forced to. People are so over dramatic. Upset? sure. Quitting outright, I don't think so.
---
Yea that's dumb as fuck
---
But looking at the video it's going the same speed as when you just click once and afk yeah? It would go bu twice as fast right clicking use bone and clicking on the altar.
---
The whole point is black jacking is a pain in the ass the regular way and this way u can literally look away from the screen and mash mouse keys . The normal way takes 100% more attention
---
its live now and only playing on lms specific worlds
---
group ironman, only thing that will get me to come back tbh. (mithrilman mode)
---
I'm giving examples, the full list of how cheatscape operates is in the link above. I'm sorry for not typing out EVERY feature of a client.
---
The natural statement was brought up by the other party in the conversation you jumped into, and not myself. I declined his statement that this was the natural progression of things, because it has come about in an unnatural manner. 3rd party, not official client developers, not jagex affiliated, and not jagex. That is rather unnatural in the progression of a project, no?
---
I'm not against the game expanding. I'm against people exploiting code that is present to make the game about following an onscreen overlay versus learning the game, trial and error, etc. 
---
This was an A and B conversation. Did you even read the comment I was replying to before you said nature had nothing to do with this because it was man made code? lmfao.

A combination of the 0 combat xp method, clever use of the aggression timer to prevent monsters from attacking me, and methods including keeping track of the monsters hp regen tick and manipulating the poison timer to increase kills per hour.

(currently adding extra info to this comment)
---
Because they don't understand what high risk high reward means, or that wearing black d'hide and praying mage at revs won't do shit against tribriders. They like to act like pvmers are defenseless against pkers but they don't use the gear and skill necessary to defend themselves. And hcim literally max without setting foot in the wilderness, so no one is forced to go there.
---
How about whipping them through the streets?
---
Good, natural selection
---
That's disappointing, thought cars looked that cool IRL
---
no, when you just afk its 3 ticks per bone, when you spam click like this (or do it legit with high effort) its 1 tick per bone, so 3x faster to use the bones (banking/unnoting time and stuff still matters so its not a complete 3x xp/hr)
---
GAuth has a Chrome extension. I've been using that alongside my phone so I don't get locked out of my account if I lose one.
---
Ur all stupid.

Did this to 50m prayer exp. only lost 4 bones to pkers total.

---
I'd love to see an official fork of Runelite, but they would have to cut a lot of plugins. Take something like the clue solver: people like it, but it kind of totally defeats the purpose of the content. It only makes sense as a 3rd party addition. _Maybe_ it could be justified if it only showed solutions to clues your account had previously finished, but that would be technically difficult to implement.
---
Still, if there was a even a super paired down version that just had like the GPU plugin, ground items and maybe a few other small tweaks you could get people to move over to it just by calling it official.
---
You are all misunderstanding what I'm saying though.
---
Everyone is so up and about lighting logs. Fucking logs. It already takes no effort, and this provides no tangible advantage except if the player is disabled, mentally or physically.
---
Imagine if 3 ticking was made the same way, just spam click. Now that would be a big deal. Or if altar spamming would be made the same way... oh wait it was and everyone is fucking upset about lighting logs. That's what I'm pointing out, and some autists here think I'm pro-cheating.
---
SMH this sub sometimes. But at thist point I firmly believe some just downvote because they see it's at negative already...
---
I love how Venenatis just turns on the pkers as soon as they come into range. The wilderness bosses are actual savages.
---
Thing is, though, that Jagex barely does anything about third party clients..

Too small of a sample size
---
There should be more of a culture for people doing 1v1 tribid fights in the duel arena. 
---
* You can get tribid fights in edge bank in pvp worlds, but usually only people looking for high risk fights tribid here, plus you can always just tab out so it's not the same as the wild. 
---
* you can get 1v1s in LMS, but this is 99 def only, you have mostly food instead of brews, plus the loot is bad
---
* you can find 1v1s in deep wildy singles, but if you get TB'd by a clan here you will almost certainly die, and there is no real counter to running into clans
---
**If people did 1v1 tribids at the duel arena, people can do fights without having to worry about being PJ'd, you won't have to risk untradeables, and you/your opponent can agree on how much you want to risk based on your gear setup.** Because risking untradeables things like tent whip, volcanic whip, d defender, imbued mage cape are very common in tribid fights, fighting in the duel arena could be a win-win for both parties because the loser keeps their untradeables, saving them time, and the winner can potentially get more loot (e.g. instead of getting only a kraken tentacle worth 600k, you get 1m extra in the stake). 
---
For example, if you want to bring claws and have a tent whip, you normally have to risk the tent, which will up your risk from \~900k (ags only) to \~4m + defender risk (claws + tent). But if you fight in the duel arena you can just agree with your opponent how much you risk. For example, you can stake 2m, and this would be a win-win for both parties: you would be risking only 2m instead of 4m + defender, and your opponent gets 2m loot instead of \~1.4m (because in wild only the kraken would drop). Or maybe you just want to have a normal tribid fight with \~900k risk, but you are still new to pvp and don't want to lose 900k + an imbued mage cape every single time you die, so you can find someone who will stake you for say 300k. Or alternatively, you want to use ahrims, fury etc. but don't want to risk 100% of the value of those items. Sure those items are good, but are they worth the extra millions of risk? No, which is why you rarely see them used. In the duel arena, you could bring a fury over a glory and agree to stake 400k extra. Or however much your opponent agrees to. 
---
**Best of all, this requires no update for jagex to implement, and it doesn't need any polling either. People just need to start doing it.** The same way people go to lvl 44 wild in the BH world for tribrid fights, people can start going to the duel arena in the BH world for tribid fights.

true that new tele changes things

This has already been a suggestion to be added in the POH but was deemed too OP for UIM, obviously it would seem like a good idea but I think this is just not needed.

Treasure trails help is definitely not needed.
---
Ignoring your hot take on PvPs effect on the economy, have you ever considered that the vast majority of the PvP community actually take part in skilling and PvM?
---
&gt; That won't do good for the game.
---
improving the game won't do good for the game?

makes sense

---
Shameless repost
---
Then you clearly don't need a dragon pickaxe bad enough if you aren't willing to risk dying. You're willing to risk dying to the boss, why not die to a player? It's likely because you're pixel hungry and incredibly greedy, ironically incredibly greedy people are usually the ones who die in the wilderness the most.
---

....so join a clan?
---
I agree. PKers talk about risk vs reward, but in the meantime they typically go out in mystic risking barely anything trying to PK someone doing Callisto in Veracs for easy and quick money. How's that for risk vs reward? I have no problem with PvP, nor do I hate the wilderness. In fact, I think the wilderness is a core part of Runescape. The risk vs reward argument however makes absolutely zero sense to me.
---
when a bone is ended, the next bone isn't used until a fixed 3 tick lapse
---
I can get a lot more xp/H in runelite I think
---
Jagex plz do something to bring craws bow back to 300m.
---
honestly I think the pick-pocketing part of thieving is the problem. stealing from stalls, pyramid of plunder, sorceress's garden are all decent with better methods reward more benefits of xp,gp but pick-pocketing is just click a dude and hope rng doesn't make him stun you or level until its unfailable.
---
Gratz! It's the quest to introduce you to higher level quests, shows you aint messin around. End of the F2P adventure, beginning of the P2P.

Wow that's a 1 in 14 drop rate, lucky duck.  I'm averaging 1 in 30..
---
Being able to activate dev mode in the official releases was effectively a bug, it existed to help people write plugins and was never intended to be used by players for any other purpose.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Um, no. The 3 tick delay is only if you're auto-using them. Look at the chat.
---
why does the shaft get thinner as it goes down? wouldn't that just result in the axe head eventually sliding down?
---
Amazing
---
Player jumping has been around since 2004 and it refers to attacking someone immediately after they finished a battle with someone else.
---
what other weapons can inflict poison on a 0 hit?
---
The code is already there though? Runelite has it all, can't they just pick the plugins they want and (almost) copy-paste it to the client with some polishing?
---
May I take your hat sir?
---
Right, that's why I said different implications
---
Yeah, I'm just going to say it now. Your philosophy sucks.
---
I've never said they lose all responsibility. I am, however, saying if you sell bullets to an obviously depressed man and they commit suicide, the seller should be held just as accountable as the suicide victim. It's why most gun sellers have an arbitrary registration period rather than just immediately giving the customer a gun.
---
Bartenders stop selling alcohol to people with no self control because they realize it's better for the person's health than just letting them drink themselves to death while they are already drunk. Should the alcoholic be responsible for their actions? Of course, but again, when someone isn't thinking rationally and fully capable of making informed choices, it should be the duty of the people around them to AT THE VERY LEAST not take advantage of them in their vulnerable state.
---
This isn't the state coming in and stopping people from thinking for themselves. The state isn't just going to barge into people's homes and tell them they can't buy something. I don't want that, you don't want that, and the government doesn't want to waste money barging into someone's weeb den to stop them from buying their 80th body pillow.
---
Again, this entire discussion started from arguing about regulating the industry. I never specifically stated limiting how much someone spends is the only option, from this conversation it seems that was the only way you believed an industry could be regulated.
---
Regulations don't mean removing free will and removing the consequences of choice. That is just the most retarded, out there, Ayn Randian bullshit mental gymnastics that is so fucking dense anyone who actually believes it probably shits black holes and has a brain made of lead.
---
The most common form of regulation is getting the public to know the potential risks of any purchase they make. The government doesn't ban cigarettes, they just heavily tax tobacco and work to outline the health risks of tobacco to ensure people make a well informed decision before buying a smoke. It is a way to hold corporations accountable because corporations are perfectly willing to exploit the emotional state of irrational people.
---
Simply saying someone should be responsible for their actions isn't a good argument. Should we do nothing to protect a victim of domestic abuse because they have the ability to leave their manipulative partner at any time? Should we do nothing to stop Pyramid Schemes because it's the scam victim's fault for getting suckered in? Of course not.
---
In business, there has to be some force in place to protect the consumer's rights because the power dynamic is always heavily in the seller's favor.
---
Yep so that means that you were correct and your loot dropped on the ground for everyone else to see, since your  death was considered a PVP death since you still had more than 0 pvp damage

Going for untrimmed herblore would do that
---
Should be, but can't be. Jagex doesn't validate the clicks involved to make this possible.
---
That's not how actions have been defined in the past when discussing this... Using bones is one action, regardless of it takes you 3 mouse inputs to perform that one action.
---
BIS for fally riots
---
working as intended? are the interests of the few less important? do their interests not matter? these polls do not sacrifice anything for the majority as it's not intended for the majority. yet somehow the majority gets to decide wether it should be in the game or not. 
---
seems like it's not working at all.
---
Exactly. Everyone complaining weren’t complaining a week ago or when ToB plugins came out. But now that they feel OSBuddy is going too far they’re pissed because God forbid the game becomes more difficult for them at the cost of not devaluing everything.
---
/u/prezleek
---
will he keep his neiz or will he upgrade to the faceguard after nextweek?
---
Or what if we made it that 99 max all took only 1 click? Would be pretty fun.
---
I think the old RS2 idea where you could hover over an icon to see the solution but it disappeared when you moved the mouse could be a good middle ground. The solver sites will always exist too so people can always use those if they really want to.
---
Nice, really nice!
---
Idk seems more of a waste than its worth there’s thousands of bot clients and coders. No bot is fully safe, so he’d just be competing with others and OSB makes enough. But who knows.
---
How do you enable the features? What exactly is enhanced mode?
---
Not really trying to go super hard on keeping everything even. Mostly just the active skills, and really only so that I'm always doing different things. 
---
Farming and hunter are higher because they are 100% passive. Fruit trees and bird house runs only.
---
Healers only respawning if jad was healed up to full, make sure you aggro all of them, or at least 2 , when you kill them so jad isn't healed as much. bringing a couple of chins in can help you agro/kill multiple healers to minimize how much jad is healed
---
I don't get it. Games like WoW and what not have community plugins that are hardly managed by the developers. If there's anything too op a plugin can do the developers simply improve the client to remove the ability to do that... 
---
People act like this 3rd party client concept is new
---
Ah yes, the good old scorched earth tactic. You go in, eat everything you can and burn what you can't.
---
Bonus points if you draw a giant fuck you in the dirt with debris.
---
Those features aren’t for pro only. It’s for free. Go to client settings to enable it
---
Hey thanks, it’s just what I’d do and it actually makes sense.
---
Yeah, what the fuck was OsBuddy thinking?
---
Next you'll tell me they have 1:3 actions like swapping [talk-to] with [pickpocket] or [talk-to] with [bank] or [exchange].
---
Hahaha- oh wait.
---
RuneLite has that. 
---
But I guess that's okay since it's RuneLite. 
---
But wait... 
---
Does that mean 1:3 actions are acceptable? 
---
Why don't I see people up in arms over these 1:3 actions on RuneLite? 
---
Huh, that's odd. (For the record, OsBuddy has it too)
---
If you want to be petty, equip them and start chucking them at the pkers to waste a few before they kill you.

In the modern MMO genre, back before WoW (where runescape originates) punishing deaths in MMORPG games were very common.

How can u not have enough bank space? Do u really need that many stuff?

Like oh em gee 😂👌😅
---
MM2 is fairly easy, DS2 will probably take you a few tries.
---
But I guess that's okay since it's RuneLite, even if it's 1:3 swapping, something very similar to the OSB changes. 
---
From a business perspective, it's the route with the least hassle.
---
You right, can we remove the wilderness and free trade already?
---
Or clans could be forced to pk in multi? Where multiple people are meant to be able to pile?
---
All wood handle tools ive ever seen are like this so that would be my guess.
---
They already have that for beginning accounts. It's either x amount of quest points or x amount of play time (can't remember exact numbers) before they can trade popular items. 
---
Also, some people hate quests

Its Jagex what do you think lol

---
What do they have to gain? They’ll have full control of their game. There won’t be this line of what’s an acceptable plugin and what’s not. 
---
This community is so obsessed with game updates being polled but no one seems to care that we get plugins weekly that aren’t polled and impact the game just as much. Jagex could poll their own plugins.
---
They always say use 3p clients at your own risk, well if they make a decent client there won’t be any sort of risk...

---
I've been playing since June and I'm almost at 1750
---
I'm perfectly okay with that, ground items, and basically anything that isn't a macro or devalues PvM. It's either they lose integrity or half the playerbase tbh. I don't think anything besides stretched fixed mode is necessary on the vanilla client, but you know.

I just copied and pasted the text from the actual meme and it was written like that

Where at
---
The alt would be using melee as it's more dps than range and mage in this scenario. If another player deals a non-zero hit on a monster, the kill credit for the ironman is lost.
---
yeah it's really weird how many items are involved within the minigame when there is pretty much no practical use for it.
---
CHESTBRAH
---
They attempted to make several other games which all failed or got canceled. They sold out and are completely ruled by other companies who don't give a fuck about their jobs or the long term sustainability of their company.
---
The only thing they ever did right was having the Gowers' game. But even that they ruined and now the only thing they have going for them is a version of the game which was reverted back to before they fucked it up with microtransactions among other things.
---
More items get added. Bankspace remains the same... its okay now with the seed vault.

If a 3p client determines whether someone will quit or not then go ahead and leave. No one will miss you

Yea, it is pretty weird how people have been fine with the menu swapper. Even though it clearly removes a click.

How have you not cropped a single tree?
---
Npc invasions are a hell of a lot easier than real people

You used to be able to set it up and walk away from your computer for 6 hours until it automatically logged you out. Now you need to click or do something to keep it logged in every 20 minutes

Yeah.

I use RL all the time but yesterday OS Buddy released broken ass features to their client. So to save time imma switch
---
OP said it would be part of the bank interface right?
---
OSRS users are in literally every sub 
---
Remember dropping a $11 in WPD before it was banned, and got some crab emoji replies
---
My thought as well. Like it doesn't make a difference if people Google answers or use plugins. So let the plugins stay.
---
Nope. I got one today
---
He mentions in the post this would be opened directly from the bank interface with a button.
---
without which plugins can't live with?

Wonder
---
Whys the dude in mage gear wearing a fire cape🤔
---
Doesn’t matter what’s “allowed” anymore dude just look at all the videos of the client being used without any penalty. So what makes that not allowed?

He named dropped a bunch of people to the point where the judge had to tell him to keep it to the scope of the case. He sang like a canary and then some
---
It was for Keanu Reeves way back in the day
---
The game has many unplayable features. Their client is one of them. I’m not sure who pissed in your cereal this morning but you need to gear down turbo. Of course no one will miss me it’s a game with thousands of players, sure a few of my friends might but you’re saying this as if to insult me. Don’t get mad when people comment their opinions on your posts, makes you look like a douchebag. Just ignore them.

I follow him cause he’s cute and I love his accent 🙊
---
There's the mage cape spellbook swap for this exact reason
---
Well, you kinda got the shard.
---
Regulating companies by forcing them to dial back aggressive advertising tactics isn't at the expense of free will at all. Do you solely define free will as a human's ability to say yes or no to advertisements?
---
You think I'm not seeing a bigger picture but you're looking at the wrong picture entirely.
---
You don't lose your free will when the government tells a corporation unrelated to you to dial themselves back. If the government tells Jagex to show the drop rates of every TH promotion they ever do, you don't suddenly become a weaker person.
---
I've told you before and I'll tell you again. If your entire argument solely rests on the IDEA (not even a fact) that free will is undermined by any form of regulation on unchecked and irresponsible corporations, then your argument sucks.
---
The average person is able to think for themselves and it really doesn't matter to them if Parliament forces Jagex to disclose drop rates or dial back the aggressive advertisements. If you're in a right state of mind you probably can and will make a reasonable decision based on rationalizing how much you want X and whether the gamble is worth it. Regulations won't suddenly tell you, "No, you can't buy that."

Now what about little Timmy the little 10 year asshole who steals his grandmother's debit card? He probably doesn't understand the concept of responsible spending and all he knows is Jagex keeps beating into his underdeveloped brain that there's a special thing that gives him lots of exp and all he has to do is use grandma's seemingly limitless card. Should we really reward Jagex by letting them keep that money because Timmy is a prepubescent addict and Timmy's senile grandmother didn't even realize her card was stolen?
---
It's like selling a gun to a suicidal man. If Jagex's ads weren't so aggressive them Timmy probably wouldn't have stolen grandma's card to spend that money.
---
Again, laws don't exist to impede the day to day lives of normal people. As I keep telling you, laws exist to deal with the extremes. We don't have bills or government aid strategies for normal days, we have them to deal with hurricanes and earthquakes and wildfires.
---
Regulations are similar. The UK isn't going out of their way to try and regulate Nintendo. Nintendo is selling quality games at reasonable prices and they're making money without taking advantage of anybody. It doesn't matter if you're in a good state in life - if you're depressed you probably will still only buy one copy of Fire Emblem 3 Houses and you'll probably still enjoy it.
---
Jagex, however, is not Nintendo. Here, we have an actual story about a guy who stole his parents' credit card and went $62k in debt because he has no self control. This is an extreme situation. The question now is should we let Jagex continue these aggressive, unregulated lootboxes with no oversight, with no direction, and most importantly with no accountability?
---
Should we let Jagex sell guns to suicidal people and not hold them accountable for their deaths? Is Jagex completely blameless or did they add fuel to the unstable fire? That's the relevant question right now.
---
If you're worried about repetitive uninteractive gameplay why are you on a UIM?
---
there must be something weird to make that happen to me, but it did happen,
---
oi cunt, nice memes
---
How the fuck is that any different? You're asking for shit to be made easier and accomplishments devalued. It's literally the exact same shit. It amazes me that some people have the audacity to deny the obvious truth.
---
Yeah it was sukoai rs or something like that, wildependent was the ign. that series had me hooked from the moment I saw it.
---

---
Reddit majority supports PvM over PvP. 
---
Please keep this in mind when going through this feedback.
---
One of the biggest complaints I saw with the LMS rewards is that they didn't come from PvP. I'd argue that those rewards were the closest we'll ever see to PvP-exclusive.
---
You could probably do it with okay-ish efficiency at 50 mage for iban blast and 40 range/def for green dhide and rune armour, but it would take a while and you would be using a lot of ppots
---
That guy got banned for rwt, not bug abuse.
---
worst case scenario this saves 1 slot per pot type. Just decant them all if space is an issue.
---
How are people suddenly mad about this stuff that doesn't affect your game at all when actual pvp client cheating has been going on for years?
---
The ge would be packed full of "Buying pure ess, reached limit"
---
You don't have to wear entire set - the more pieces you wear, the less chance you get kicked out. According to Mod Ash "each piece makes you slightly less likely to be ejected after being caught.". But Agility has more influence to this than the robes.
---
So, you can wear full HAM robes excluding the logo which you replace with the Dodgy necklace for maximum benefit. How much does the robes help, I don't know, but I believe more than the necklace in the long run.
---
Gigantic if realistic.
---
Maybe get rid of the medium clue scroll junk that's taking up 100 spaces
---
Yes please. Also make cats F2P, they make good beginner pets.
---
Also imagine how hard someone with max cash stack could crash the price of a rune.
---
Reading some of these comments makes me realize how right you are. Too many new players that just want to make the game easier with no respect to the effect it has on the game. I know devaluing achievements is often considered a dumb excuse but this is straight up macroing. If people are legit okay with actual macroing to exist and not be bannable, well then you are lost.
---
A player that hasn't completed their books or construction levels probably wouldn't be this well geared, though, and would have a bit more space to compensate. You can decant potions into larger doses, you know, so you should have at most slots taken up by them if you're efficiently managing space.

---
duradel ?
---
Are you flexing that you broke ToS ? Not cool dude.
---
Why would you store pages that haven't gone into books? Just drop or drop trade them
---
And isn't a costume room like low 40s? Hardly seems like a reasonable excuse for a full bank that early
---
It's only easy to escape if you haven't been baited for your brews, your tank skill doesn't matter if you've used 5/9 brews fighting the bait account and the tber scims you for a full tb. Yes, often you can get lucky and they log in too late/only get a half tb/splash enough freezes, but that outcome is still shit from a "I want to tribrid fight people" perspective.  
---
I can't argue anecdotal evidence vs anecdotal evidence in terms of how many teams you run into, but with the amount I run into I almost never bother attempting to pk at 44s/rev cave single entrance anymore and am exclusively playing LMS until it dies.
---
Better yet you have the salad robes pkers going for people doing wildy clues for the ever glorious spade drop
---
Stay in f2p. People are way nicer
---
Teleporting literally has no requirements either. I can go the the ge and buy a duel ring for like nothing and tele. Theres also burning necklace that takes you into the wildy too.
---
This ring would literally signify jagex's power is useless to the mass
---
Could work with 1 or 2 worlds, but we're in the hundreds.
---
Is luring acceptable behavior for any player? 
---
Ask yourself that OP then think about your post.
---
All jagex has to do to control runelite is threaten to ban anyone who uses it if it gets too cheaty.
---
You could do Zulrah at your stats.
---
Lol what noob gets to level 80 with a mining level of 10
---
Better theory is OSBuddy wants to be in business with Jagex so they’re suiciding 3rd party clients with plans to approach Jagex offering their support.
---
Agreed, we should just all start botting, if 100k of us are botting they can't ban us all.
---
Jesus fuck, can I get banned???
---
I've went over 7 hours without anything but then the next day got 3 drops in an hour.
---
Their work shift is only 6 hours. Albeit with a 1-second break to log back in.
---
Why not? It's an easy way to determine whether it's worth writing a two paragraph long post explaining why they're wrong. Anyone that debates politics online doesn't care about being informed, so I determined it was no use explaining why he is an idiot, as he would ignore it anyways.
---
The fact that his post is at +17 while being blatantly wrong and my later post actually explaining why he's wrong is at -6 says enough, no?
---
There are literally hundreds of RSPS that exist, it's not any more of a "scam" than them.
---
Sounds like guerilla war tactics to me.
---
If you honestly think this community would have a last exodus if 3rd party clients are bannable I’m going to respectfully disagree. This community is littered with addicts and NEETs. Sure some will leave but they’ll be back within a week.
---
Rune
---
agreed, its such an easy skill to train once you have supplies.  Its gotta be one of the fastest skills to train /hr
---
The moment this happens I'm rwting all my shit in a blink
---
Touchè
---
Doing zulrah right now. 1:10,000+ depends how long I want to run it
---
Jagex has a very hard time with gray areas.
---
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit. I doubt half the playerbase is going to drop the game when most people were doing fine without 3rd party clients back in 07.
---
GPU rendering and tooltips honestly are all I want
---
May get downvoted for this but I actually think parts of mobile need to use less clicks. The game is significantly easier to play on pc.
---
Seems like something that should be pay-per-vat instead of a one time purchase. Maybe lower it to like 200-250k per vat, and you could then also add unlockable criteria in order to purchase vats i.e. block list slots (quest points, certain quests, etc).
---
This is exactly why people don't want this shit. No one cares if you like his videos. Why the fuck should some random content creator be one of the few sole voices when it comes to pvp updates?
---
"Saruman's General Store" got me, amazing
---
I don't think you or much of Reddit has used the base client in a long enough time to realize how awful and unusable it is.
---
Regardless, even if just a few people leave as a result - there's still no incentive for Jagex to do it. Reddit is bitching, sure - but Reddit bitches about everything. In a week this will be a nonissue.
---
There's already a crab in-game named "ry" (probably cause of reeeeeeeee) lol
---
Thank you! :D
---
Please tell me what program you used!
---
Yes. Suicidal people are to blame for suicide. Addicts are to blame for their addiction. You keep saying the same thing over and over because you just refuse to actually take in what I'm saying. It's not a company's fault some people can't control their own lives, they should not have to change for that reason.
---
Most people were also 12 years old back in 07 and never had anything better than the default client.
---
As a mother of 6 virgin man children who are all at least 23 years of age, who spend their time unemployed in my basement, eating chicken tendies with honey mustard, all while 3 ticking on OSRS for maximum efficient for a minimum of 16 hours a day, I can really get behind an update like this
---
It’s not solely the fact Reddit’s bitching. It’s the fact that more and more plugins are being dropped that are just broken as fuck. If the J Mods value the games integrity of their game even remotely they’ll have to say something. What they say, who the fuck knows. But something needs to be done because I don’t care who you are these plugins are not needed in game or should they exist.
---
Youd think people wouldve learned from the last time pvp was taken away.
---
I mean if you try to do any skill with suboptimal supplies you’re not going to have a good time. But yeah I’m with you.
---
Maybe this could be expanded out into an entire herblore guild? You automatically unlock 1 vat every 20 levels, and have 5 total at 99, and you have to buy extras beyond that? Or maybe some sort of other resource sink, using planks with construction? This has a LOT of promise.
---
I hope they expand on quests. To give good lore and rewards
---
Like
---
Tower of life 2
---
Penguins quest (maybe something along the lines they infiltrate powerful figures like Kings and start making changes to benefit themself and the zookeeper is the only one that notices)
---
Void knights quest(but don't add the OP swords please)
---
Quest lock zulrah for a quest after underground pass.
---
New fossil island quest, since that's the theme.
---
Menaphos quest.
---
Like the quests don't need to have good bis, or good items, just lore and fairly decent exp rewards would be nice.
---
Also an updated client would be nice. I wouldn't mind paying more like 15-20$ a month for R&amp;D for a better client.
---
Primarkletics
---
f button doesnt collapse though. what plugin is that
---
Scazmatar
---
Since 28 March 2007, it has been considered scamming.
---
Straight off the oldschool site. It is against the rules completely.
---
xp lamps from random events and some quest rewards. Not very impressive given there are 3 skillers with 80+ slayer
---
You would pay $20 a month for osrs with a better client? You would be unfortunately alone in that
---
oh cool its keyboard im subbed to you on youtube
