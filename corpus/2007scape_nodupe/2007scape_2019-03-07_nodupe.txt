The elven lands would make a great fit for a temple trekesque thing through the area. It looks amazing and encounters are endless.
---

---
You can have rewards like a crystal tree patch somewhere  you can plant it in the elven lands, it can be unlocked by taking a person X amount of times and he'll tell you of a secret spot in the forest he found 
---
---
---
Wow, some people are really talented, you are a really good artist man
---
I think they've released stuff like this before. Don't quote me on that. Its sorta just vague in my memory.

Am I cheating on him if I look him up in hiscores between episodes?

Hm got a rune defender and already done regicide... guess Ill work on that dragon one. Thanks

and you could also teleport with a single keystroke

He's not saying "Woox is quitting because other people are uploading his videos claiming to be him".
---
He's saying "other people are claiming to be Woox and pretending they are quitting" which leads to a fake runescape forum link explaining why, in an attempt to phish your password.
---
Ive just made this my new desktop background, phenomenal work man. Love to see more from you!
---
There is no hay in Morytania. 
---
I tried going through billing support but it was taking me to a page for a form that does not exist anymore, and had a redirect to the homepage.  If you know where I could find some sort of contact I would greatly appreciate it, but from what I've gathered the next best methods of contact are either reddit or twitter.
---
I plug in ur nan
---
I haven't played RS in about ten years and I'm enjoying this video series immensely!
---
He did in I believe episode 11
---
Have you watched all of his videos?
---
People just stake to give away gp instead of Proom these days.
---
No, it's 4chan because of the Roman dates instead of Japanese. 
---
Yeah. You could also do things like kingdom to give you daily profit too. 
---
next you'll be telling me that karambwan are a real thing
---
Would like to have this from ba

is your talent for sale?

point out every time u see the number 73
---
Thanks so much, I appreciate it!
---
Why are so angry? 
---
Yeah that would be cool, but also colours as well, like how u can get ornament kits but like with the graceful how u can colour it somehow in another minigame
---
hey its me ur dad
---
What's wrong with it?
---
I still love you. 
---
Lmao
---
I have no direct link, and like I said "if I'm not mistaken". It very well may not be the case and just be hearsay since I can't give you anything concrete.
---
No.
---
&gt;my favorite thing about the concept here is that you can get stuck on a clue you may be able to do soon, but are still able to do another hard you have stacked in the meantime.
---
This actually makes clues a joke since you could just keep ignoring a clue scroll you don't have the requirements to do without sacrificing it. That's the entire point. You either go get the requirements, or you drop it. Why do people play ironman or other restrictive modes, then try to make everything as convenient as possible?
---
How about ammy of Accuracy (t) for beginner clues (or an ornament kit) and ammy of defence (t) and ammy of power (t)?
---
Legit like it better that way. You already explained you would be alching them. 
---
My man‚Äôs got a fighter torso under that shirt

Tell him 91 is half of 99 and when he argues that your wrong tell him to do the math.

also, legalize the use of crack cocaine and distribute opoids to kindergarteners during lunchtime

You might have skipped a step? Talk to the neitiznit guy again and see if he wants you to fix em
---
Do it Pog

Wow... power of zoom lol.

Fuck man, I forget the name of it. However, if you go to World 308 and head to the G.E you'll see them advertising all the time. Bunch of pkers. I used to pk with them a lot.

Jokes aside, big gz &lt;3
---
Do you have a hammer? 
---
There has been PLENTY of updates, recently especially, that the community as realized updates are bad.
---
A max of 5 stackable clues does not hurt the game whatsoever. The people who believe this will affect clue item prices are way too short sighted. 
---
I look forward to this every single week 
---
What do you mean turmoil hand cannon and corrupt pvp armor. You realize we are playing old school right?
---
Is Miscellania profitable or is it best to sort of ignore it?
---
MUH IMMERSION!!!!!!
---
So it's worse to have a job and do whatever the fuck you want in your freetime than to be a neet? Ok then.
---
No, TOB mentoring is still done via normal splits although mentors are allowed to request a 100k fee for wiping just to cover their supplies. This hardly ever happens though since mentors usually take a helper with them to avoid wiping with learners (and a lot of mentors don't care about the 100k death penalty and will keep teaching regardless of wipes).
---
Or it's just a funny picture he wanted to post...
---
Agreed, fuck these ezscape kids ruining clues. wtf, they're meant to kind of be a break from doing task or whatever. Not some necessity. Have fun spending 5 hours completing your stack of clues at a time btw.
---
Has Jagex said anything about skill requirements for the Song of the Elves quest?
---
Actually, it's not. I remember a tanzoo/virtoso video where they tried to get the highest total level with no questing in a certain amount of time. This ended up being a point of contention, so they tweeted Ash asking if it could be considered a quest in any way. He said no.
---
Not agreeing it shouldn't be, just pointing out it's j mod confirmed not a quest at all.
---
COBOL is just a lost allen wrench in the back of the toolbox.  It may be useful at some point so people keep it.  Or something.  
---
I intend to vote yes to everything but the re-rolls and the stackable clues. I like stackable caskets but stacking clues? As nice as it'd be for imp farming it should not be a thing. I'm terrified of this community and what will be chosen.
---
Lol fuck you
---
H
---
If you enjoy questing I‚Äôd go through all the members quests too, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do. Slayermusiq1 on YouTube has some quick guides on quests

It never even occurred to me to right click on the jump rope bridge option üòÖ now to get 20 construction so I can actually fix it haha, thanks for the help

You can just admit you were wrong. You'll look like less of an idiot.

Is this the first spider in Morytania?

Settled is just a genuinely likeable dude. I could listen to him read a newspaper... inb4 episode #1092 newspaper edition. 
---
Are we blind? Deploy the upvotes!
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Bruno, West, Gambit, Lenny, Ash, Acorn, Husky (new mod).
---
2.  Announcements
---
  *  Attack Style Pures Bug - Maz/Acorn have looked into the forum thread etc, roughly 1000 players. Still double checking and going through, then will go to data team for verification and then work on a process to remove the XP. Thank you for your patience! --- Treasure Trails Expansion blog is posted, check that out! 
---
3.  New Jr Content Dev! 
---
  *  It's been fun so far, came from the oil/gas industry and has played OSRS for a long time before joining the team. Looking forward to learning and getting involved. Played back in the day, started when OSRS came then dropped off and finally made an ironman (~3 years) nearly maxed! 
---
4. If you could add anything unpolled into the game, what would it be?
---
  *  Group ironman, discuss and talk about it with ironmen friends! Would be nice to share duplicates and reduce some of the tedious tasks, shared house and other in-game features.
---
5. Follow Mod Husky on twitter.
---
  *  https://twitter.com/JagexHusky
---
6. We recently polled the Elf quest, everything is passing and looking good. Now we will need to poll smaller rewards and extra features. Also want to look at Crystal armour. Check the threads and get involved!
---
  *  Sounds good.
---
7. Any update on Arceuus spellbook rework?
---
  *  It's still there and just looking at when and how to introduce it (and it does need to be tweaked/looked into further!). 
---
8. On the Arceuus Spellbook would reanimate be combined like bolt enchanting?
---
  *  The rework does combine a few of the spells together which did change the 'level required' for some (higher ones get easier, lower ones get slightly higher level requirement). Putting them into different tiers like Jewelry enchanting spells could be slightly better rather than an interface.
---
9. Ed suggests the rework could/should come alongside the next quest.
---
  *  Could do yeah!
---
10. Can we have lore for Corporeal Beast?
---
  *  Maybe? Do we want RS3 similar lore or something else completely original? Perhaps similar theme to RS3 but obviously not an exact copy. (Discussion on RS3's lore) but yes it would be nice to have some explanation in-game Lore.
---
11. Can we get a message in the chat-box if we get a clue that already has the hidey-hole filled, like a "this clue looks familiar" or something.
---
  *  Like it, good idea. 
---
12. Can the drop tables of older monsters be looked into, like black demons etc, at the time their drop-tables were adequate but now compared to similar monsters they are far inferior.
---
  *  Maybe better to give demonic ashes more use, but not instantly keen on buffing the tables. Perhaps Konar tasks helps reinvigorate some of these older monsters drop tables - in a way - and you can also kill boss variants like Demonic Gorillas. 
---
13. Can you please explain lore behind having a sawmill in Prifddinas, the elves would mostly usually use living wood?
---
  *  Plenty of buildings there are partially made from wood so having a sawmill makes sense!
---
14. Regarding moving Crystal imbues from NMZ to Prifddinas, can this instead be moved to content that pures can access?
---
  *  Moving imbues from NMZ is the goal in any case, we are having discussions about whether the prerequisite quest can be tweaked or whether an option for pures. Talking about where and how to draw the line on catering to players in that way.
---
15. Any chance of stuffing/mounting the Golden Tench in your POH, alongside your other rare fish?
---
  *  Yeah that would make sense!
---
16. Possible for having a teleport outside of Inferno? Perhaps as a reward for completing it once. Current options are minigame tele to fight caves then on, or to the fairy ring then through which is like running a marathon!
---
  *  Not really keen on it, no huge need is there? Maybe a new teleport to Tzhaar teleport?
---
17. Any future plans on uses for Redwood Logs?
---
  *  A few ideas are around, obvious solutions include planks for construction (but wouldn't look to change METAs). Perhaps as a cosmetic moreso. Open to ideas too. 
---
18. Can the fire after of Dehumidification 'Making friends with my arm', extend to Ghasts in the Temple Trekking minigame?
---
  *  Could yeah? It could make those challenges a bit pointless, but given that most people's play-style of the minigame wouldn't change much.
---
19. How does the team feel about corrupted PVP armours to the game?
---
  *  Not keen to change the F2P META, the weapons might spice up PVP. Would be keen to hear thoughts and to see how people would use them.
---
20. Will you ever add useful rewards to Gnome-ball?
---
  *  Could? Maybe like a gilded Gnome Ball or coloured? Outfit? Could be better to rework the minigame too? (author's note: probably cosmetic, but open to suggestions)
---
21. Will you ever add 5 year Veteran capes?
---
  *  Capes are easy and fun to make, perhaps could be something simple and a tribute to OSRS and appropriately themed rather than an RS3 copy? If the players want it, no definite answer.
---
22. Can the random events in Zanaris be removed to stop delaying you - they lock you in place for like 5 seconds which is annoying when you are doing bank-skills?
---
  *  Open to making that content less annoying! 
---
22. With Crystal tools, what would happen to 3rd age? Should it be buffed to be at least as good?
---
 * Probably not, 3rd age is pretty much cosmetic anyway. Infernal tools are already better.
---
24. How will Crystal tools work with infernal tools?
---
  *  They'll have to be taken into consideration but have different effects so for the most-part might not even need to change anything. 
---
25. What does the team think about superior versions of the new slayer monsters?
---
  *  Do like the idea of superiors to help variation. Perhaps Wyrms and Drakes could be cool! 
---
26. Can we get an invisible boost on the new fishing rods?
---
  *  Mostly cosmetic and to save an inventory spot. 
---
27. There was an idea on improving sand collection for Crafting, is there any update on this?
---
  *  The asset has been developed, it's awaiting testing! Maybe next week? 
---
28. Update on seed-vault and balancing/streamlining farming contracts?
---
  *  Making good progress! No idea how long to go. 
---
29. Can you allow players to obtain Winter Toad as a pet?
---
  *  Could if the players want it, open to the idea! 
---
30. Will Crystal equipment (bows, shields, halberds) be able to be repaired after the new Elf quest?
---
  *  Maybe, haven't decided or reached a solution. Surely places and ways to implement it.
---
31. What is your favourite piece of content that you've worked on personally, Ash?
---
  *  The POH room rearrangement menu. It was the hardest thing I've programmed and it was worth it, after throwing around the idea and then doing it and doing some graphics... It felt real. It took about 3 weeks! 
---
32. Can the alternative models for Justiciar be added as a clue-scroll ornament?
---
  *  Maybe? Already have plans for one of the alternative sets, down the track. (No clear answer and probably 'if the players want it')
---
33. Could you buff the rewards to trouble brewing to make the content worth it again? 
---
  *  Now that trouble brewing has a bit more of a clear timer, we can do more with brewing. So there's scope to do more here... Perhaps making more content and uses for the Ales and brews? 
---
Came here for this. 
---
I worked 50+ hours a week but thanks for your commentary it's so relevant. 
---
Bottom left, is that a crab?

Had no idea. Only really played it once. I played diablo 2 a lot though 
---
Every time I say this people tell me I'm wrong, I don't know the truth anymore.  I could SWEAR that D chain was like 25-30m even after barrows had been out a decent while.  You're actually the first I've come across who recalls it similarly.

Heads up advertising your stream will get you a ban from this subreddit. Best delete before you get banned

Frig off barb

Someone should make a runelite plugin that hides people's gear whan in morytania so theres no chance of getting spoiled.
---
Very profitable and should do it as regularly as you can (at least weekly with tears of guthix) 
---
And a streamer or youtuber will typically work a lot more than that.
---
Though I don't know why you would be proud of working 50+ hours a week. Does your job not pay you enough for you to survive working comfortable hours? Thats a shame my dude. Maybe get a real job.
---
Boi you think you know something I don‚Äôt? Nah that ain‚Äôt pure. That ain‚Äôt nothing. Try getting 99 in all stats, complete all quests, without ever taking any damage, and you only get 1 inventory spot, and no trading or banks, and no teleporting, and no logging off. It has to be done in one sitting. Then you‚Äôve beaten runescape.

You know, I'm something of scientist myself.

Low levels are pretty much right where you left them. Don't rob yourself of that experience if you value it, just login and let it fly

Think he means jagex conspiracy. Because the random  spawn fishing net that didn‚Äôt appear until the series was several episodes in SCREAMS jagex conspiracy. 
---
my argument isn't even efficiency, it's really about how clunky gearing is. clue hunting is already efficient using the impling method with 12 slots worth of teles, but a lot of times with combat clues gearing/degearing is a real pain yknow?  
---
thanks for the thought out response btw, i appreciate it.
---
Ah that makes sense.
---
?
---
Wildy volcano is an annakarl tab, then 15 seconds of running.

Last episode has a UI named Marshletics in the chat.

On a normal account, sure, but I don't really have any interest in doing it on my alt that's just going to be doing slayer until I can being afk gargoyles or something for an extended period of time.

No thats just if your membership expires

The most nostalgic place for the person can be a good one. Any tall place can look really good with the GPU plugin too.

I can explain it to you but not a map. Farthest east and safe spot for Rex. North east for prime, and I‚Äôm not sure for supreme. 
---
I'm an Ironman and I can complete all hard clue steps. Just takes dedicati0n, it's part of the fun. When you get that rune h shield, you'll get a hell of a rush. 
---
The music cape shouldn't be a quest either or all tracks will be required to wear the quest cape.  I agree there should be something to indicate more achievements, but making the music tracks tied to a quest in any way isn't the way to go. 
---
 As far as current implements, the collection log is clunky in that it is a book that you read, rather than an already useful item like how rings of wealth can show boss logs.  Gentletractor's idea making the collection log within the quest/minigame/favor tab is one of the better ways of going about it as far as listing achievements in a logical manor. 
---
Hopefully one day OSRS team will release a completionist cape with a log somewhere (poh, collection log) that would list everything needed so if can show any "hidden" achievements that the game holds.
---
Good luck! Just takes some time.
---
I mean it would be a flat buff, why toggle off a buff
---
I think that'll be how it goes down too, using gear thats "reasonable" to obtain in mory, I say reasonable because "technically" you could go in with ranger boots, 3a bow, ect since Lucky Implings but thats so astronomically rare that letting his teammates use them would just be cheating.
---
you literally just retold me the title, lol
---
It would be better if it was just sightly worse than bandos/barrows neg bonus. But it's just around -35 extra points compared to these which is nuts
---
YASS QUEEN
---
Vork is 4-4.5m assuming 32 kills/h.
---
This isn't too far-fetched. 
---
Swampletics videos are insanely popular, and create lots of free advertisement for Jagex as a company. It wouldn't be surprising at all if they tweaked the drop rates for his character to make his video series successful 
---
true point i misinterpreted lol 
---
Worth maging gargoyles around 80 mage purely for xp? Would it break even with drops assuming you use fire blast / wave?

If you have membership and are logged out in a p2p area, the game won‚Äôt let you log back in a f2p world

I don't think the pvp hcim videos are a part of tyc. Are they?
---
lmao or getting void for the same reason
---
&gt; Just do them as you get them.
---
Yeah, just stop everything you're doing, probably multiple times throughout that one task you're trying to do, swap back and forth multiple times, rather than adding a simple stack that makes clues feel a lot better.
---
He died quite a bit when he was fighting Treus dayth. Same as regular death mechanics

i got the exact same drop, except it wasnt kc 1

nevertheless, i took a screenshot and showed it to all my friends

Because wherever you're getting those stats for Guthix (or any Blessed D'hide Vambraces) are incredibly and hilariously wrong. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Guthix_bracers

Doing wines until they all ferment at the same time would get you close. Not sure how many hours that would take to do though
---
Just want to let you know that watching your series I decided to get back into runescape. I'm not doing anything like what you're doing at all. Just a normal character, which probably seems pretty lame comparatively, but you definitely reignited something. The game is so fun.
---
You definitely keep it. 
---
Exactly what I did. You'll get enough points, plus some, to know self sustaining after that first run.
---
Miss this game everyday 
---
Did 79-80 with lance. 1 hit a lot of them, very fast. Didn't try / check experience though.

Visit r/emojipasta for more cancer

Yeah i am beyond jealous of that karils top at over 800kc and just want that item
---
Best birthday present ever is a new swampletics
---
&gt; when should that diversion occur
---
you can bank them. literally the best thing about RS is how you choose what you want to do when you want to do it for the most part.
---
Why though? Seriously, you'd have to be severely retarded to not be able to read what he wrote. As long as you can read his text, what's the fucking point of learning penmanship? 
---
the point of that wouldn't be to get out of a dangerous encounter, just avoid being incapacitated during it. if you have a full inventory of food while doing a boss, you're not in danger, but if you disconnect, suddenly you are.
---
Yeah some of them risk but usually better places to pk at for your time. 
---
The order doesn't matter
---
A legend
---
Or just tele with shades of Morton tele or medallion
---
What's so important about 27 hunter? I noticed he shows those imps, is he hoping to catch an imp for a chance at a rare item he needs? 
---
i really miss these days of xbox 
---
I mean in the sense that if you list dragon slayer first, I obviously can't do it as there's requirements. So then I check the next quest listed, and oh there again, requirements. So yeah kind of annoying in that sense
---
Do the waterfall quest where you get attack/str xp first, i know that much. Easy &amp; gets you 30(?) attk and str (been a while). Also the gnome quest for attack xp
---
Fixed cause I play on 3 accounts maxing main, gp alt and hcim.
---
Gpu and skybox on. Draw distance 50.
---
Why is 72 attack and Defence the stopping point? Just curious why that specific level
---
Well that's terrifying
---
He is not only the King of Ass, but the King of that King of Ass. Absolutely legend. We are so lucky to have this man at Jagex.
---
Laughed my fucking a o bro this was fire

Lenny
---
Combat system is actually interactive, you can't say it's shit until you actually get some boss kills without having an oh shit moment. And bonds exisist on old school as well. I've tried many MMOs but osrs and rs3pretty much blow the rest out of the water despite jagex milking it to death.
---
I can actually get on board with this, but it also has to not be too often, can't have people skipping a step every clue, once per 5 or so makes sense.
---
How about I vote yes on this and do clue scrolls.
---
And luck
---
Don't even toy with telling an addict to stop taking their precious drug.  A doctor prescribed it so it must be 100% safe with 0 side effects what so ever.  You should just keep treating symptoms and consider it fixed, instead of looking for a real cure.
---
Iv never done any raid but have high stats 95+ all combat and have money for top their gear is it possible to hypothetically start with ToB and skip CoX? I just think it looks much more fun
---
That's an hour of doing something that won't progress this account towards what I want to be doing with it beyond getting me a slightly better boss to fight in nmz for 12 or so combat levels I want to get before starting slayer. This isn't a main or anything, and I'm probably never going to actually touch rc on it.
---
This game is changing way too much, way too quickly
---
realm of the mad god in a nutshell
---
Or you could just do Prince Ali
---
I don't see why stackable clues are any worse than banking thousands of implings. By your logic they should prevent stackable imps or drastically reduce the limit. Also, you can only have one clue from each tier active at a time, so you'd have to still drop a clue that you are unable to do in order to do others from the same tier.
---
Yeah, they're not related in any way. The only thing that would be a barrier is that 1. ToB is much more punishing in that it costs 100k every time you die, AND when your time dies you have to restart the entire raid again
---
2. It's a lot harder to find teams and there are less teachers
---
But in theory you can start ToB without doing CoX, yeah.
---
its a title so every important word is capitalized 
---
you're fucking stupid 
---
I used a lance all the way to 99 prayer. Dhcb works so I would have been surprised if lance didn‚Äôt. 
---
Blame the people who trade them
---
various pvm mobs and rune shops pump more natures into the game than are really needed.
---
you do you but he's pretty autistic
---
Man what
---
If you can afford a scythe, definitely start with ToB. I‚Äôve done 500+ ToB with 2 CoX kc lol.
---
Is 20 atk 35 str 1 def 40 range 1 prayer 25 mage a good build for a low range/2h 1def pure? I want to get into PKing, but start small.
---
I agree, they should add hair to the legs of male characters, finally someone said it!
---
W65 is the chambers ffa world. 
---
I really like the area around Arceuus. All the colours are just so damn nice
---
Oof someone's mad they got caught stealing their mom's card.
---
IDK if people actually use the ToB worlds, everyone I know is on 416 or 467. But yeah like the other guy said, 365.
---
I want him to clip getting the final lamp for 27 hunter and then just clipping to hitting 99 hunter. 
---
Imp's have entirely ruined this already though, you profit off of every tier except elite, and you can bank an infinite amount of them with no effort.
---
good multitasking
---
There are many now
---
If you have any friends that play, all them to be there. That's what counts
---
Huge fuckin circle jerk

he got thousands of barrow items if you count coins

Just turn up your opacity in settings /s

no

If anything ranger's will go up in value, since the additional medium rewards are going to make the boot drop table more rare than it is right now.

Fair enough.  By my logic its a minor change, so I don't particularly think its a much needed change, and I know for some if a change isn't needed it should be voted no.  
---
This game is amazing. Please play again
---
lol not a good day to post xdxd

Right, I dont believe its as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be, but Ive always had the "if it aint broke dont fix it" mentality and I think it applies here for sure. I wouldnt be mad either way it went though.
---
I have no problem bridding all 3, I just occasionally will go into the aggro zone of one of them before I finish killing the one I'm on. Just wanted to put markers on the zone for each monster. Thanks tho :)

Get members, do tears of guthix. Once a week do it and your lowest stats will start to rise.

A lot of people struggle to get it, you just don't hear about them because no-one likes to embarrass themselves.
---
My best advice is to stay calm, take it slow, and make sure changing prayers correctly is your first priority. To manage this, force yourself to only do one other action in between each of jad's attacks. As soon as you see jad start an attack, change your prayer(if you have to), then click on a healer, then pay attention to jad again, repeat until each healer is aggro'd. When all the healers are aggro'd, run a few tiles in a straight line so they get stuck behind one another, that way only one or two will be able to attack you at once, making the damage you take far lower.
---
Remember that the most likely way for you to die is by failing to pray against jad. Everything else is secondary. Spending a few more seconds to make sure you're praying correctly is a lot better than spending another hour or so completing the fight cave again.
---
Just wait for your membership to expire, EZ
---
I think its mainly the increase in number of worlds bots can buy from, there is a relatively small number coming in through pvm.  Also lower demand, a lot of people are moving away from alching as a magic training method and moving to bursting, splashing, or imbuing.

If I charge a craw's bow and use it outside of the wilderness do the charges go down? I really want to get a craw bow for training ranged since it alleviates the need to buy ammo and pick it up off the ground after a kill but I like the charged look a lot. I just don't want to get the charged look only for it to wear off despite not being in the wild and not taking advantage of its effect.
---
And on that day 3 months from now we find out that all along settled has been grinding 5 accounts at once.

Wish I had friends that still play
---
I've seen some people bring an rcb or an acb if you've got the money for the final fight for that extra range for a little loss in dps. Maybe that's something you can try? 
---
Vote yes because rewards are expensive and I wanna crash ranger boots
---
Guys, get this, I actually have stood in several places that swampletics has. No joke.

I guess you could say I‚Äôm a pretty damn big deal.

If you are able to get jad to spawn behind the rock you use to safe spot for fight caves, you can pull the healers off one at a time and then run behind the rock after has attacks and switch to pray melee and kill them. Just make sure you pray switch before running and then make sure you trapped him before switching to melee pray. Then just run out with range pray up (since you can hear the mage attack) and pray switch if needed and finish him off. I found it easier to do it this way as I didn‚Äôt have to worry about healing from healer damage and jad switches at the same time. 
---
It do

karils, salve amulet, mm1, not 100% afk. i'm out of the loop with new items, etc.
---
My eyes 
---
I think i remember reading that you can out-dps them at 90 range with dragon darts, but I could be wrong.
---
I definitely recommend just killing em one at a time and yea just take your time and do one action per switch whether its aggroing a healer or using a prayer pot dose. 
---

not too bad, thanks!

You bet man 
---
Dumbass
---
as much as I enjoyed the smackdowns certain jmods used to give. I very much enjoy your style of explaining things. It makes the account security team feel much more authentic with process. 
---
Wondering this also.
---
Is there anything jagex can do to get rid of phishing streams on twitch? Or is this twitches responsibility
---
how is he rich? did he own part of jagex before the china company bought it?
---
This happened to me because I was a dumbass kid and bought $4 membership pins on ebay.  
---
A few days later Jagex held my account for $20 ransom lol
---
You should be able to fire it without charging it, meaning it only consumes ether when its passive activates (ie in the wildy).
---
That being said, why no just get Ava's and use an msb(i)? Its better DPS AFAIK, and saves you droping 30mil on a what is basically a fancy msb(i)
---
and that is the problem with netflix shows, doesnt feel as good watching a whole series in one day
---
If you do not have one already, I highly reccomend spending some of it on a berserker ring, and getting it imbued at nightmare zone.  I believe they are only like 5mil currently, and it‚Äôs +8 strength when imbued.  
---
Lol, your comment made me think of something. Could do one of those trick questions that goes:
---
When did Runescape come out?
---
[A] 18 Years Ago (RS1)
---
[B] 15 Years Ago (RS2)
---
[C] 7 Years Ago (RS3)
---
[D] 6 Years Ago (OSRS)
---
Oh wow that is brutal
---
This is how wow turned to shit. It was made so that everyone can do all the content. 
---
Oh wow, as long as your having fun tho that's all that really matters. I remember doing it on my old account, never got anything but it was always exciting to open the chest
---
Well I feel dumb üôÑ
---
At this point there's probably thousands of them
---
Awesome, thanks for that. I've actually tweeted Mod Ash about it. Hopefully he responds.
---
His answer is very vague. He just said that its not on the list. I wonder if there are any technical issues as to why it cant be a mini quest.
---
5 is too much. 3 is reasonable from a slayer task for example 
---
He didn't have the medallion there. It wasn't on camera what he did but based on how he explained the time remaining for his death pile, he walked back.

It might be a decent enough crush weapon if you could use the dragon defender with it..

Yes. I'm going to call shenanigans. The odds of that are 1.09E-27% or 0.00000000000000000000000000109%. One in 91,586,738,700,000,000,000,000,000,000.

I literally do this at work every time I google something, I was showing my boss how to do something and I typed ‚Äúos‚Äù at the end of my search before I realized and deleted it

---
Makes a thread and doesn't offer any sort of explanation on how having stackable clues would potentially cause the ranger boot price to crash and only thinks it shouldn't happen because of his opinion, but then asks anyone that disagrees with them to give them a reason. Great job. 
---
My understanding is that they are not all UIM, but they are all (supposedly) going to be Morytania ironmen.
---
This series is making me want to get membership
---
This is the OC we deserve. 
---
anyone know if settled has seen this yet?
---
Uhh lol I wasn't talking about wintertodt deaths. I meant detch mechanics in general. My point was; one shouldnt change their game behavior because of a yet-to-be-announced-patch. Promised updates can take a long time (like this one)
---
Combat bracelets...hm

The enchant only works when doing tasks i found this out the hard way yesterday

lol these people all think that serotonin, oxytocin, and dopamine are all the same things. Just let it happen...

Anti-Aliasing is an option in Runelite if you choose "use GPU"

To make a long story short, it's.... not good.

Imagine being this clueless to editing. Watching reality TV must be amazing for you.
---
I did this exact thing!
---
Get well soon fam
---
That's the point of these accounts though.  They'll figure out a way. 
---
I think it took me a bit over 550, never fletching unless I was behind on points from not paying attention.
---
I do 0 clues so maybe my opinion isn't valid, but i would 100% start doing clues if this was a thing. The fact you can only store full sets is a big put of, i have no bank space to store random items for years..
---
In their twitch channel OldSchoolRS under past broadcasts
---
Either make a pure that is low enough to not have to face off against mains, or deal with the fact that a maxed main is going to be more powerful than a pure.
---
I think that doing some quests would give you a better sense of direction. You will not only unlock content from questing, but can set skill goals for yourself in order to do those quests. Good luck!
---
Questing is a good start. They're pretty fun to do, unlock content, give xp, and give you stats to work forward too. 
---
fuck this guy
---
I would love to see some swampletics art that incorporates more the landmarks in morytania. The grotto, the bridge, barrows, etc

All done the collection log mock up.  Admittedly I spent a little while making it look legit hahaha

---
For me, the ultimate  Completionist cape would be the Champions cape+ max cape that people have been wanting for a long time now as you'd need the champions cape anyways.
---
&gt; But stacking the casket rewards is perfectly fine
---
Yeah? Stacking the rewards doesn't change the rate at which clues are done.
---
Wait- I'm actually getting a migraine wondering wtf you mean- are you *seriously* suggesting stacking the caskets is somehow the same?
---
That's basically what the rune pouch was supposed to be but you can just buy emblems. It's a weird system but I'm excited to try it out nonetheless. 
---
See I deserve it

50/50 you get it or you don‚Äôt

Slayer points for what lmao, have you not bought anything with your slayer points yet friend?
---
These comments actually convinced me on how idiotic this community is
---
Yes, because I put my time into more important things than to make my handwriting look good. Seriously just a huge waste of time. If both parties can read what I wrote, it doesn't matter whatsoever.
---
Take pride in the work you say, like everyone is a poet or a writer who writes several pages a day. I can't actually even remember the last time I held a pen. But sure, if you want to waste your talent for something so mundane and unnecessary as penmanship, then be my guest.
---
 These comments actually convinced me on how idiotic this community is 
---
Thieving master farmer is 1.2m/hr at 94.
---
Hunter for catching chins.
---
Runecrafting is 1.5m/hr+ at high levels I think.
---
Mining gem rocks or mining at blast mine is pretty good.
---
Smithing at blast furnace is pretty good too 
---
imagine if fire giants drop bandos chestplates. That's the point.

Yes they‚Äôll give less than 1000, I just shoo them away at this point

Did the automated herb cleaning suggestion get turned down? Don't see it being polled anywhere and I remember there being a dev post about it.

I keep seeing this mentioned but don't watch his videos.
---
Roughly how many dry is he? 
---
Like others have said, questing, but more specifically, aim for recipe for disaster. RFD requires various skills and quests so it sets a good progression bar on your account.
---
Other than that I would say grind the 2 hours for a torso if youre mid level; it‚Äôll provide the best str bonus until Brandos chestplate (end game gear).
---
people saying that wintertodt rewards scale with your total level are technically sorta correct but the main factor in determining what rewards you get are the individual stats. for example if your total level was only like 250 but you had 99 fishing, you would still get very good fish rewards when you got fish. just the other rewards would be shit. similar logic applies to all the other skills (herblore, mining, farming, crafting, woodcutting)
---
Can it be undead hay?

the OG 25 killstreak was hype as fuck

can Vet‚ÄôIon even be killed without safespotting though? I‚Äôm maxed combat and he smacks 40s through protect melee
---
i haven't read anything in recent updates that would suggest this change...? haven't actually tested it but i think they still should give favor.
---
Tbh I wouldn't drop items to the main unless its a dupe, but if I can make up for it with money earned on the main it should be all the same, eh?  Thanks a lot for the advice!  It's not often people are open to teaching raid newbs :D
---
But do you have the champions cape?
---
marked as spoiler, apologizes for not doing it for you.
---
Still a great episode to watch!
---
As if a flair would make them more popular. No, I want a separate flair so everyone else and I can filter it if they don't want to watch or don't care. And I, personally, don't care about the stuff they do. They can make whatever content they watch and if they get loads of attention from a flair, then grats, but I won't be looking at it, and nor would anyone that had it filtered.
---
So basically you don't have a point and just want to be correct. 
---
Its personal preference but I think these colours are better

White - beginner

Green - easy

Yellow- medium

Red - hard

Purple - elite

Black - master

Serious question, I always see things about jagex servers being bad and DCs etc. However, is this primarily an EU problem or what? I live in NA and started playing runescape again pretty hard when I got laid off my job around christmas and in the past 3 months I haven't been dc'd once while playing. 
---
i feel like if your doing skotizo you should just be ready to do clues. you make it seem like its a surprise when you get a clue and have to degear, just dont degear unless its a wildy clue (which anecdotally is like 1/4 clues for me)
---
I'm not asking to be catered to.
---
I'm asking for more items that don't require def levels, similar to robin hood hat, elder chaos robes, fremmenik rings, ranger tunic, ranger boots, various amulets
---
It's not a tall order, but melee/str bonus is neglected in the "1 def req" category. 
---
Assuming you pray yeah, taking off melee armor would be better. It wouldn‚Äôt be that much better, hence why people don‚Äôt bother
---
It wouldnt be so bad if 100 people wouldn't repost every time a popular steamer or YouTubeer did something
---
RAGE 
---
I don't really understand the arguments against stackable clues. RS3 did it while I still played, and it was glorious. Clue scrolls are some of my favorite content in the game, and it allowed me to do a bunch of them at once if that was what I felt like doing.
---
I know that with the 1 clue limit, people sometimes feel obligated to complete it even if they don't necessarily want to at the time. It's annoying sometimes to interrupt your slayer task to start a clue, then get the inevitable wilderness step and have to bank your slayer gear, but even more annoying is the feeling that I am missing out on potential clue drops. Allowing 5 clues to be kept would be a nice balance between complete freedom (rs3 I think has a 15 clue limit per tier?) and the 1 clue per tier limit of osrs which undeniably causes annoyance for some players. 
---
yes it will by dropping prices of clues scroll items wym
---
orrrr you could right click lookup your character and see what 99's you have?
---
Hunter (red/black chins)
---
Runecrafting (multiple high gp/hr methods)
---
Didnt read the article
---
Is MM2 difficult? What levels should I be to complete it without much issue?
---
RuneShark's godsword set from scratch is pretty amazing as well... The original Ironman. 
---
Regular lizardmen, just use a cannon and you can get it in like 10-20 minutes
---
[got a pair after 2](https://i.imgur.com/RfOKRV9.png)
---
Even more when its for no real reason. If its a change to make something more consistent (like if they'd change how elite clue question clues worked to be consistent with hard clues) its not as bad
---
For number 2 I've been doing Neive until I hit every 10th task. Then I'll switch to Konar for a task to get a few more points out of the bonus.
---
Definitely agree. I think of dragon armor as in the same class as rune/addy/mith as it has no special abilities, unlike barrows. 
---
and then theres the third group that right now ignores clue scrolls all together. You make clue scrolls stackable you're introducing what I believe to be a very large playerbase to clue scrolls that wouldnt have done them before, dropping prices even farther.
---
Make Barrows Gloves a 1/1,000,000,000 drop from Barrows chests.
---
clues are already worthless they can't go below zero value my dude.
---
Wtf is he doing
---
Construction is a skill you can get so down to muscle memory you barely have to pay attention. It seems awful at first, but after an hour or two, you can watch a movie while doing it because everything happens in the exact same way every time.
---
NOBODY LOOK! NOBODY LOOK!
---
lol 
---
Why are you retarded? 
---
I just finished it a week ago, then i finished off the medium diaries. Now I‚Äôm working towards 60 attack while doing wildy slayer/farming and herblore for quests. 
---
like i said, if something garbage gets better for casual players, they're more likely to pay the sub for another month and keep the game i enjoy alive, without hurting me or the content i engage in one bit.
---
commit neck rope immediately
---
Slayer is what you make of it. I spent a few days points boosting to have a huge point excess so I could cancel any task I didn't like (and block others). It's a lot better when you pick and choose your tasks.
---
Magic armor doesn't really do much in barrows unless it increases max hit, so people wear tank gear to tank the brothers. Since every room drains your prayer, you might as well use prayer to block 100% of the damage since your prayer points will be depleted once you go into the tunnels. 
---
For those unaware, this is a bug. I could not move my character out of the spot. 
---
You don't need to kill them at all. Just tag them so they focus on you. You'd need 90+ range and expensive gear to out DPS their healing. 
---
name one BIS item that this update will ruin, and don't say ranges we already have stakable mediums with 20 clues per hour being farmable.
---
yeah because the QOL of someone who chooses to limit the content they have available to them is more important than the economy of what has always been an iconic part of runescape. I'll be so glad these ironmen can do a few extra clues so the rewards of clues can be completely scuffed.
---
You can buy it after the subquest. Don't need to finish RFD to get it and use it in nmz
---
You're right. Hopping worlds is way too much effort.
---
Cause it's targeted crashing. 
---
It turns out people don't like doing things that have to be done for diaries/quests/etc. that are
---
1.) Insanely low xp/hour
---
2.) Extremely unafkable
---
or
---
3.) A combination of the two.
---
god pages
---
The better xp rates in members is worth your time vs doing f2p stuff, if you really care about efficiency. Also you‚Äôre missing out on doing quests so really it‚Äôs just super inefficient 
---
not BIS for literally anything endgame. 
---
blessed dhide
---
A good choice of first 99. Did it myself and made a good bit of starting cash that allowed me to get gear for slayer easier.
---
No it's a bad argument. Justicar would crash so hard as it's not nearly affordable as crystal gear. Out of balance.
---
It's a very, very, very small change in DPS, and not worth the effort for most 
---
Amount of clues would obviously increase. So many people keep clues in their bank for a while before they get around to doing them. All of these people will now have 5x the clues to do when they eventually get around to it.
---
btw bis doesnt mean the ultimate bis of all time, i mean more like its bis at a certain point in the game, like blessed dhide is bis for someone that poor, god pages bis for 1 def and so on
---
Make a meme where this repost is in the barrows chest loot

If you are buying, you will just get a members item when the order fills

not BIS for literally anything.

bis for 40 def fym
---
Awesome, thank you for the quick reply.  Have a good one! :)
---
ok and my argument was this update makes the game more enjoyable for low level/casual players without hurting endgame. 
---
But you still can't equip them without having RFD done ;)
---
What's the original video??
---
who the fuck cares about your alt account
---
please stop spamming my inbox with worthless items that are not bis
---
and quit assuming that just because people farm mediums this doenst update doesnt further affect the clue finish rate
---
Incoming all the losers who want to comment on the code so they can try to flex they know what they are talking about..
---
Jumped on it when I found it was available haha. Just have to figure out something good to do with it .....
---
Like u/Zaenille said, bringing a switch for the healers could be an option. Crystal bow has really long range, and it's affordable too. You can use it to tag the healers one by one when they spawn. You can even switch to long range attack mode for some extra wiggle room. 
---
Just don‚Äôt. 
---
it won't lmao. only retards who are inefficent and dont value their time do clues. there will not be this massive spike because you can stake 5 hard clues at once.
---
This is meant to show more than just stats.  It would show how many skill capes of what skill you have purchased as well as showing that you have purchased one at all as it would be grayed out without buying it, regardless of you having 99 in the skill.  Secondly, i'll refer to my edit from my last post, all capes would have to be purchased at least once in order for it to appear 'collected' within the log to show that you have 27/27 for the completionist cape, or in this case 27/28 if you include comp cape.
---
I wouldn't vote Yes to this even if it would be super helpful, ganna be a no from me.

i think you underestimate how many people like to enjoy the game versus value this efficiency bullshit you're talking about. If i really valued my time, (and you too for that matter) I wouldnt be playing this game and fucking arguing with you over this dumb shit but here we are. guaranteed there will be a spike, and im not assuming its a 5 cap stack because afaik jagex havent said that you just hope its that.
---
It's painful to see someone asking for what to do for money but their farming is level 1. Complete fairytale I for the magic secateurs. Get it to 32 for planting ranarrs or 38 for toadflax, get to unlocking the extra patches through quests as soon as possible. A herb run takes between 4-8 minutes and generates between 50k to 200k depending on your setup. 
---
His first attempt of the theatre will be in august soooo
---
I think stackable clues could work if they only stack in the inventory, not bank. That was you can complete them as you get them as a break from Slayer or alternatively finish your whole task and have like 3 clues to complete at the end.
---
Stackable caskets sound fun.
---
Rerolling steps shouldn't pass.

Could we please get an NSFW version :)

Dude.. that was rude 
---
The brothers have no magic defence, so no magic attack bonus is needed when you already have 99% accuracy in melee gear. 
---
You can also look at other people's logs when in their house, could be useful there.

I dont even think you can justify it by saying "well there should be a net in that spot anyway cause of the fishing content" but why? There are a ton of fishing spots in the game that dont have fishing nets, and why would they have? Why would there randomly be a fishing net next to a fishing spot (unless a player dropped it after he was done fishing in which case it would disappear or not be able to be picked up by ironmen) its extremely artificial, private servery, and forced to do that. Incredibly cringe they legit have a "net spawn" based off a suggestion. I cant believe how stupid it is. Can we have hammers under every anvil as well please? So we never forget hammers?

Why are we putting niche armor into clue scrolls?? So many of these things could be easily used as valuable drops for new bosses/monsters/minigames. I do not think clue scrolls are the right place for any of these rewards, besides druidic and the cosmetics.

clans have always been unhonourable, youtubers just took those tactics and gave it a wide platform.
---
Imagine not knowing combo food has been in the game since 2004
---
Correct ^
---
$1000 a month? Sounds good, but maybe you should stop paying so many RS girlfriends, some of them might even be traps, if not all of them :))
---
Pretending to be funny with a shitty and unoriginal coment? Wow! Just like the otherd, you'll have a bright future.
---
Specially outside youre little comunity. Clean your hand guys, you sure have a lot of vum after so much circlejerk :) 
---
learn to read and stop wasting my time
---
its basically mandatory at 94 magic

you just like dicks dude

The only thing I want out of the expansion

It has been pointed out numerous times, they didn't add the net for Settled. They added it for someone else who asked months before Settled found it.

&gt; @FraserRS @JagexAyiza Account sharing isn't something I ban for, but the buying/selling of Infernal cape services is. There are awkward cases involving long-term shares which are looked at case-by-case. Calling favouritism is ridiculous, I don't discriminate. This is just karma hunting on your part

---
Did evil Dave's part with a kitten, can confirm
---
They need to make clue uniques have a use, like rs3 did. Rs3 may have stackable clues, but it didn't devalue clue rewards because there's still an actual demand for them.
---
Morytania Is annoying to me. The swamps, restrictions, paths, ghasts. Headache inducing 
---
Good talk 
---
the oldest trick in the book
---
Yeah, stackable clues gives you less reason to do them but casket gives you incentive to build them up and open a ton at a time.
---
&gt; I was simply asking for help. Not looking for a handout.
---
What you are simply doing is wasting your time. You even say in your title you hate to do this, and you acknowledge that all of us see this far too often, yet you still do it. 
---
All the knowledge on reddit can be found by searching through it, instead of making your own post to pretty much ask someone to give or loan the last bit you need for a bond. Besides, its pretty obvious that nobody is taking this post well by the downvotes, so you may as well just keep doing whatever you were in f2p to make money or buy your own membership.
---
I think I have been to Morytania just once just to unlock it. The videos are pretty much all I have seen of it

Got mine at 30kc

NO AUTHENTICATOR DELAY

Oh I don't do demonics so I didn't know that was a thing. I agree in that regard, but generally a lot of the plug-ins most people use are qol. My most used plugins are boost timers, xp trackers and ground items overlay and I'm sure the majority of users are probably in the same boat. I think the majority of voting players are still trying to keep ezscape at bay.

Hardcore ironmen will lose their hardcore status if they die (not including safe deaths like fight caves)

INJECT IT STRAIGHT INTO MY BLOODSTREAM
---
Is 10 barrows runs per hour good/decent? 
---
I wish I were maxed lmfao!
---
I completely agree with no alerts unless there was a way to toggle it for people who are specifically going for the cape, but would only alert you for completing series of things like completing all cerb drops could put a msg in the box saying a congratulations of a sort as an example
---
*AHEM* its serotonin
---
This meme is getting old. Reposters are trash.
---
I actually want to learn raids very soon. Glad I came across this post 
---
I was there too and people did talk about how slow skills are and people did aim for 99. Entitlement wasn't there because everything was new and people weren't sure the capabilities. Now the genie is out and you can't put it back.  Everyone has access to all game info that a pro would normally have without the background of experience and learning.  So they expect more because more is possible than before. 
---
lol? you know the reason the game is alive and runs. i hate to tell you but if we were all btws the game would be dead in weeks.

The people who fall for these scams will also not notice the lack of a verified check. The names are already obviously wrong lol

Never even crossed my mind about the value of rewards crashing, obvious now i think about it. No it is

Nope

Runelite stretched mode. 
---
Not gonna destroy rewards, still voting yes.

Yeah those kinds of alerts would be fine. RS3 has this thing when you log in that guides you to the next quest step. its really annoying.

Very good point, I didn't think about this to be honest.   Perhaps I play on my Ironman too much  :Thinking:

Honestly the best OSRS series out right now. Just keep making the videos the way you do, it‚Äôs so well edited.  Others making similar series peak my interest but the editing and flow of a video seems to be off.  You have a true eye for video production and could make a career in that later down the line if you don‚Äôt blow up big time on YouTube.
---
Wish you the best of luck and already looking forward to the next one. 
---
What‚Äôs hard for me to understand is that these people find it hard to understand that PvM is *not* necessarily the game for creators of these unique account builds. 
---
Lmfao. It‚Äôs true. So much stuff is just like in my way. I can‚Äôt focus.
---
Well, at least everyone recognise when something is blatantly OP, but there is always a part that would enjoy if it passed.
---
Everyone has their reasons behind it I guess, modern games are the way they are for a reason. Casualising games make them available to more customers, paying customers.
---
Hard games are usually niche, besides obvious exceptions, and just becouse they get popular, and everyine wants to be the hero that overcomes that difficulty. 
---
Drop rates don't work how you think they do
---
Meet Tim Allen,my house locked ultimate iron man, do you know what time it is?
---
because a single loop in a chain has more metal in it than the same area of plate, and they overlap to boot. Though normally, you cover much less area with chain compared to plate, but this is a whole skirt... 
---
I dont get why you blocked your name out? Lol
---
why is that an issue for you?
---
Wait, has anyone pointed out the grammar in that chat box to Jagex? I've never encountered that myself, but it should be "you try to" not "try and". Correct me if I'm wrong...

Tob requires a full team unless you're a god. Cox has also been out longer and people know it better

you should have dropped everything and picked it up. if its in your kept items list then you keep it. it doesnt protect over 1gp tho

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù post. I‚Äôm asking these people to explain why they think that their way of playing is objectively superior. That‚Äôs all she wrote. 
---
Cya 
---
yup, I used to think only complete idiots could fall for them too.  Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy what they did to me.  Gonna miss the good time I had in-game on here on the sub.
---
the shoutout was worthy though.. he's the first to do it in the whole game, taking over 5 years to complete. That's monumental. I believe the idiots downvoting me don't really understand my context of what I said, which doesn't shock me since it's reddit we're talking here lol. Either way, I wouldn't say I'm wrong and you aren't either, but rather put it into different words. 
---
Math checks out
---
65 attack gets you extra combat levels, and at that point you might as well go all the way and get 75 attack and have access to a lot more weaponry.
---
Idk who this is and I only check this sub occasionally for the memes but I‚Äôve seen a lot of his videos and the hype for them being posted. Should I take the dive from episode 1v
---
Oh boi get your memes ready!
---
A perfect image of the man himself.
---
Could you elaborate?
---
I don't think you realize you've countered your own arguement. People lazy about doing clue scrolls aren't going to suddenly do more clue scrolls. 
---
I don't think changing the number of clue scrolls sitting in the bank from 1 to 5 is a significant difference, because they still aren't being done. Plus, you can basically do that for medium clues anyways with eclectic implings. 
---
He's really good at tanking and escaping. Really fun to watch 
---
D
---
at 100% potential its pretty common to get drops, but he gets them well below that. Don't believe there's some streamer conspiracy but he is hella lucky
---
You need to contact your bank and ask them to lift payments to foreign countries for 24 hours. Any payments I try to do from my bank instantly blocked, I gotta ask them to lift it for 24 hours and confirm my payment is going to jagex LTD and the payment is from me
---
Unless your a Moritayna locked UIM with one goal
---
What do you use to grab the data? Or is there some api? 
---
i wish i was allowed to die...
---
Looks like you got locked in a stone prison for stealing a balloon on national balloon day. 
---
tell him people that deiron have the big gay
---
You mean, empty?
---
&gt; Yes, I had a bank pin, and they somehow still managed to crack it
---
They cracked it because you provided it in the fake Runescape forum.  There is no way to just "crack" a bank pin other than keylogging or you have an easy to guess PIN, like 1234.  
---
In terms if more security measures, most hackings come from personal faults of not securing data and using the same email/password across multiple websites.
---
- Use an exclusive email only for your Runescape account.  I recommend using gmail.
---
- Put two-factor authenication on that email.
---
- Put two-factor authenication on your Runescape account.
---
- Pick a unique password that you haven't used anywhere else and use it only for your Runescape account.
---
- Check https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to see if your email and passwords have been compromised in data leaks.  This is helping for accounts outside of Runescape as well.
---
You are going to have to learn from this mistake and hopefully return with newly found knowledge on scamming within Runescape, whether it be inside or outside the game.  
---
jesus christ. i feel bad for getting 4 zenytes at like 790kc.. your rng may turn around
---
Gz bro
---
Most people tend to wanna forget about the place after all those tricky quests
---
Even more than negative 1 tbh
---
It's not like the p2p easy clue steps are hard though it's just search a crate or dig somewhere. Just make it so if you're on a f2p world you can get different steps that are still f2p but take a similar amount of time to get to.
---
I bet, I've considered going for 70/75 range but I would really not like to spend the extra few hours/day, as I'm trying to do NMZ asap to imbue some items such as slayer helm/zerker ring/etc. Is it doable with the current stats I have if I pot up, use prayer efficiently, and use strong ammunition/3rd age for the fight?
---
Plus I absolutely loved burning through many clues in a row on rs3. 
---
Just get 94-96 magic. Its like 1,5m xp so thats 6 hours bursting...
---
I might be called naive for this, but can't twitch easily fix this by manully disallowing the creation of any account that has 'WooxSolo' or some variation of that as a username? I know it seems like a bandaid solution but surely its better than just deleting the streams that pop up again 5 minutes later
---
the first room requires you to freeze the healers or Maiden will heal to full. 
---
He is limiting himself to standard spellbook, so someone else has to do it for him. There is no way of beating the entire theatre if he cant even get past the first room.
---
They would never breach the rules by switching game code for a little potential increase in profits. There's no chance that they meddled with this one guy, all that favoritism and the precent is sets is scary.
---
Why
---
it shouldn't change much if i understand drops correctly
---
using med as an example, all 3 pairs of boots are on the same drop table.  So adding non boots shouldn't effect your chance to get a pair of boots much.  Same for 3a.  They're on the Mega rare drop table, which you have a minuscule chance to hit
---
I've said for awhile I'd like to see a client disconnect check on server side, and be-able to maybe be a ring of life feature (would be pretty meme'y if Jagex added a game feature to an item to protect from DC)
---
But if server detected that client dc'd after like 4-5 seconds of no response should try to use teleport avaliable in the clients account, like if there's a tab or if there's teleport runes or charged/quest items for teleport.
---
These would only be 'attempted' to use so if you didn't have one, tough luck and you'd die like normal, could possibly try home teleport as last resort, also if were tb'd etc wouldn't work, so unplugging your router isn't saving you.
---
But it would save you from DC or give some option to horribly hurt your router if your mouse/monitor/ dies in a PvM situation as at least a way to attempt to fix it.
---
Clues won't be broken from being made stackable, yes there will be a brief 1-2 months peak in interest but then it will go back to the usual people who invest time in clue hunting. 
---
In rs3 dye prices remained barely affected when I left in December 3rd age and blood dye still remained in the 2b bracket so I don't buy this "everything will crash to 0" crap.
---
More clues being completed is not a bad thing, if anything it means it's been made viable enough for other players to want to invest time in to them.
---
This update is a literal toned down carbon copy of what RS3 has already released, and none of the implied negative impacts that these Nostradamus posts came close to happening on rs3 and it's had a while for the effects to be felt. 
---
Stackable clues will not break prices and implying more players taking interest in clues is somehow a bad thing is retarded. Jagex should always be releasing content to cater to the biggest proportion of players possible.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing so this dude is probably begging at ge
---
Found the guy that can't code. 
---
Or maybe even less likely. Right now, if I get a clue drop I better pause the task and do it. If I can stack clues, I will not do that clue right now and instead hope for more clues. These will be rarer now (like ecu keys). 
---
When swampy guy is involved, everyone acccepts the repost
---
Don't it since it'll use up time and resources jagex can use to break the game instead. 
---
Depends on the skill my dude.

Did you try turning off the third-party client feature and see if glitch appears on vanilla client?

Meet mod Ash, my UK locked ultimate man. After recently maxing my king of the world I decided to up the ante, to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave the UK. All leading up to eventually taking on one of RuneScape‚Äôs biggest challenges, appeasing the community.
---
why thank you 
---
He already picked one up outside the farming guild 
---
It‚Äôs not even BiS at every task 
---
Got 6 items in 30 kc
---
&gt;tfw it‚Äôs a group chat with his parents and grandparents
---
He also has like a half dozen accs at every combat bracked geared up and ready to go for when he sees someone who is hunting him down, he'll log and then kill the person and then log back in.
---
Also it's not DMM! No tele timer means you really can't die if you're super safe and just tele when you see a person at all. But he's a champ so he doesn't even tele unless he has to
---
Hah NERD 
---
Yes, it would unlock the Kharazi Jungle which is like 1/4 of Karamja

My bad, idk why I thought they had +3. You're right.

I'm fairly sure that there is an option to give Jagex certain details for that. You may not have the transaction id, but you should be able to give them the 'subscription' method and starting date.

Dont mind me just commenting for my new background when I get home.

can you do barrows with only range?
---
Eu thing
---
idc about the graphics as long as we don't get curses, summoning, EoC, max, etc...
---
Until u get an obby cape and earn 600k lol
---
Clue rewards?
---
Free to play= no profit to fix.  That‚Äôs a negative from me ghost rider. There are bonds for a reason.
---
whats drop rate?
---
I don‚Äôt think so.. I assume it would suck with only range. Might be wrong. Range and mage though
---
This is a waste of time. I use to do this in 2005
---
I feel like the more people that start, they will start to outnumber the veterans and with poll results not hidden it will just be a sheep-fest.
---
I think it depends on the growth cycles, like other plants.  I'm not sure when the ticks are, however.
---
but like if you plant it right before a growth tick im sure that shaves off several hours
---
Started with a kitten and it turned into a cat
---
Once you get the stats it‚Äôs honestly not hard
---
Lack of understanding? Yes kid I get it I know that doxxing is a felony. I also know it is also one of the most difficult crimes to actually pin down on someone, and most dox charges happen when two people WHO ALREADY KNOW WHO EACH OTHER ARE IRL fight over or in a video game and one takes it too far with a dox. You can‚Äôt just find out who a random kid is irl who doxed you, that violates so many privacy laws in itself that you‚Äôd be fucked... 
---
Again the only thing you could do is take preventative measures if you don‚Äôt know who cocainedebt is. But your continual strive to fight a fight that isn‚Äôt there only serves to display your gross ignorance on this topic. You know nothing of dox enforcement or regulations. You are right. My argument centralized around why bother trying to dry the ocean with a hand towel? You will never complete this task as you will never complete that. Sure you can suck your own dick off, pay 300 dollars an hour for an attorney, and tell yourself that you tried when he tells you what I‚Äôm telling you now. But we both know it stems from your projections and your issues in life, and nothing to do with the enforcement of a transnational dox.
---
Good day sir. 
---
You can have the karma, I am a karma only ironmeme that has to get it solo.

But the grind is still there.

Damn that‚Äôs some healthy exercise right there

lvl 66 needs to learn some life lesson bringing his rune armor wearing ass in there, rune full helm looking ass, team cape wearing ass, leather boots wearing ass, lookin fresh outta 2005 lookin ass, no defender lookin ass, shake my muthufukin head boyee
---
Xeric's talisman looks horrible, nothing like what was suggested here a few weeks ago. Why is it not the X part glowing green? That's like his symbol, looks more like "+eric's talisman".
---
Vote no for the kilt and the manacles, they seem like pure/pker items. 
---
Nevar forget the spell resize fiasco.
---
YOu need a big cash stack. Items around 10k you'll need like 20+mil to keep a decent rotation in GE to keep them coming slowly in for cheap. People tend to dump there rune/alch items so if you got lower offer in over time it will eventually get it.
---
Overall if you can alch 1300/hr. So at maximum effeicntly that's what you need coming into from GE.
---
I'm kind of annoyed by the fact the best looking Cape in the game is gonna give me a skull...
---
Oooh ouch
---
Lol somebody is really mad! :D
---
Talk to the cook again to get the letter.
---
Copypasta please?
---
He avaraged 9,6 hours a day on the account since the day it was created. That's 67 hours a week. Let's say he sleeps 7 hours a day(7*7h=49h a week), works 20 hours a week and spends 3 hours a week commuting. That's 139/168 hours of the week spent.
---
That leaves 29 hours a week to run errands, exercise, socialice etc, which in my opinion is plenty.
---
i think its reasonable because many pkers lose thier imbues pking anyway
---
Oh damn.   I think battlestaff is a members item though.   Darn.
---
Fair
---
Agreed! Sad!!!
---
Do not start the cry
---
lmao nice

Very cool

50 bonds dude why. the bank's doing you a favor from wasting your money on overpriced bonds bro

March 07 2019 QoL and W45 Changes
---
This week sees the release of some QoL changes from the Re-run and Miscellaneous weeks of QoL month, some new additions to W45 Deadman Mode and the removal of this year's Birthday Event.
---
 
---
QOL Changes
---
The changes listed in this post wrap up everything that was polled in the Re-run week and includes some of the changes from the final QoL month: Miscellaneous. 
---
Special Attack Orb 
---
Clicking on the Special attack data orb will now activate your special attack if you are wielding a weapon which has one. This change only applies to non PvP areas. A PvP area is defined as follows:
---
Duel Arena battle arena
---
PvP world outside safe zones
---
DMM outside Barbarian Assault games and random event zones
---
LMS
---
Castle Wars
---
TzHaar Fight Pit (the PvP one)
---
Clan Wars instanced battles
---
Clan Wars free-for-all arena
---
The Wilderness, not including the Wilderness Ditch buffer zone
---
Recolour god spell icons 
---
The God spells found on the standard spellbook have been recoloured to match their relevant Gods. 
---
GFX update to Xeric's talisman 
---
Xeric's amulet both charged and uncharged have now been graphically updated. This update also affects the mounted version of the talisman in any player's POH. 
---
One-off payment on Saniboch 
---
Players may now pay a one-off fee to enter the Brimhaven dungeon from Saniboch for 1,000,000 coins. 
---
'Pay' option on Saniboch 
---
Left clicking on the Brimhaven dungeon entrance now automatically attempts to pay Saniboch for entry. If you have the coins with you to buy permanent access, you will also be offered this. 
---
Remove cap on dark totem pieces 
---
Players may now continue to gain Dark Totem pieces in order even if they have not combined their existing pieces.
---
If you already have an incomplete set of dark totem pieces, the game will attempt to select a piece that will complete the set. This means that the chance of completing your set has not been made harder by this update. 
---
Expand GE history to 40 
---
The Grand Exchange history list now extends to 40 previous listings instead of 20.
---
W45 Deadman Mode
---
Permanent Deadman World 345 now has a Grand Exchange! Please note that this world will become inaccessible right after the update to enable devs to do live testing on the Grand Exchange. It should come back online for you shortly after testing with the Grand Exchange and other changes that you can find listed below: 
---
Emblems 
---
NPCs above 100 combat now have a chance of dropping tier 5 emblems.
---
The drop rate of Tier 1 emblems on wilderness slayer tasks has been greatly improved. This now matches that of Seasonal/Tournament worlds. 
---
Broken items on PvP death 
---
The broken item system has been brought into Permanent Deadman. As on PvP worlds, throughout most of the game world, items with a ‚Äòbroken‚Äô version will now be broken on death, with the PKer receiving coins based on the repair price. Speak to Perdu to repair your broken kit. Please note, in deeper Wilderness areas, above level 20, the standard behaviour still applies whereby untradeable items are turned into a small quantity of coins for the PKer. 
---
Looting Bag 
---
On a Permanent Deadman world, players may put things into the looting bag anywhere outside "guarded" zones. This now matches the functionality in Seasonal/Tournament worlds. 
---
Temple Trekking / Burgh de Rott Ramble 
---
The Temple Trekking / Burgh de Rott Ramble mini-game is now available, this gives players access to the rewards as well as the Lumberjack outfit.
---
The clue that requires the lumberjack outfit has not been re-enabled. 
---
Slayer XP in instanced Slayer boss rooms 
---
Although training in instanced areas does not normally give XP on Deadman worlds, some Slayer XP for killing the Grotesque Guardians and Alchemical Hydra will now be awarded as those creatures die. 
---
Seed box 
---
The seed box is now able to be purchased from Farmer Gricoller. 
---
When killed via PvP, the seed box will attempt to move its contents to your bank before the loot is distributed to the PKer. This means any stacks of seeds in the seed box will be possible to be acquired as part of the bank key. 
---
Song of the Elves: Rewards and Extras
---
We're proud to announce that everything from the first Song of the Elves poll passed in the polls, meaning the quest and main content will go into game this summer! 
---
Now's our chance to go more in depth with the smaller rewards and features you would like to see from Prifddinas. A second poll blog will be posted soon with the top suggestions and ideas for minor content in the Crystal City. If you would like to get involved and potentially have your ideas made reality in Old School, get involved in the discussion on Reddit, Twitter, and the Official Forums. 
---
You may remember that we decided not to poll Crystal armour in the first poll as you weren't happy with the final design (in terms of stats and set effect) and neither were we. To make sure we get it right, we're also holding a separate discussion on separate threads on Reddit, Twitter and the Official Forums. Alternatively you can email in your suggestions to OldSchoolCommunity@Jagex.com. The deadline for all suggestions is Friday the 29th of March.

Old School RuneScape's 6th Birthday Event has been removed. The birthday event rewards will be available again on our next birthday.

Confirming an offer in the GE multiple times will no longer add multiple entries to the GE History.
---
A message has been added for when a player receives a Golden tench.
---
A bug regarding items kept on death has now been patched.
---
Chambers of Xeric scaling will now be based on the player with the highest combat level rather than the average. This is means that if a team of level 80 players takes someone with 126 combat, their raid will be scaled around 126 combat rather than their average which would be much lower and would in turn give them fewer points.
---
On Friday 8th March at 5pm Game Time, we are delighted to be celebrating International Women's Day. We have teamed up with the IAMA team on Reddit, and a group of female JMods will be online and answering questions about their careers and the games industry, we hope to have you tune in!

Mental disability is a real issue
---
I know settled did mention verac's flail or torag's hammer's for weapons from barrows he wants.
---
It does, I've had one planted since day one and I normally do 1-2/week more than my clan
---
He works 20 hours a week so he has time for normal sleep and then some.
---
The graphics for it were just completed. It's now in the ready for testing phase. Hopefully soon!
---
Thank you Mod_Stevew, very cool!
---
Very roughly around a 3-4% chance of getting 6 or more items in 50 chests with most brothers killed on most runs. Definitely unlikely but not that crazy.
---
yeah this karma stealer doesn‚Äôt know how to spell, and that Mod butchered my birth given name.
---
"Tonights" either normal aussie person or an american vampire.
---
Fair enough and your insight is appreciated, I'm speaking from personal experience when I was hijacked a few years back (IGN Lamfear) it was a very unpleasant for a week. I received an email from Jagex indicating it had been detected as a hijacking and i received access back with the permanent ban being squashed shortly afterwards.
---
Any form of communication before that point, even to say it was being looked in to would of been highly appreciated at the time. I understand you get a lot of fake appeals and the like but if your own systems are detecting something a simple email stating you were looking into it would of been 100x better than the current system.
---
thats why im killing normal gargs..
---
loooool
---
Sorry for the question but how do u access the collection log?
---

The graphics for it were just completed by Mod West and it has now been passed back to the Devs and QA for the final stages. I don't want to promise a date as if it fails testing it will be pushed back but it has not been forgotten and is progressing along nicely! 
---
&gt;if you kill all the brothers
---
I did it last week and it still worked. Northern part of the village.
---
Ec imp jars is ezscape, vote yes to remove buyable clue scroll (basically stackable clues)
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.
---
Coming soon
---
The demand for the skull capes would certainly be higher when members are buying them for their practical use, and assuming that the drop rate the skull cape would be the same as the team cape, it would stand that the skull cape will cost even more than the team capes.
---
Hey man I absolutely have no idea about pking tho so what other stats do i need for an obby mauler? do i need ranged and mage too? if yes to what lvls?
---
thanks for the info buddy
---
3rd party should ban your accounts
---

I've asked data to track this and I'll look to give an update in a week or two :)

QOL changes are ez Scape
---
It‚Äôs my favourite cape too....hope I can be like you someday :/
---
l0l
---
Considering you can't even store a lot of the new items in the POH chest it seems like a badly needed update. It also annoys me than like 60 bank slots of mine are literally clue scroll items for sets I haven't finished, or items like Dragon Boots (g). Let me store them Jagex!
---
the level 66 probably doesn't even notice he only needs to tag 1 fire giant every 3mins
---
Look at the hands - are those Dragon gloves? Or just red gloves?
---
B0aty is short for Unofficial Hardcore

haha rot clan bad because reddit!

I need some clarification on the Mimic boss. It says that it is intended to be high risk high reward but the blog makes it seem that your reward casket transforms into the mimic, and once you defeat the boss it returns your reward casket. What are the extra benefits to killing this optional foe? Am I missing something? 
---
Personally I like B0aty he is making a new HardCore IronMan and playing on his main one. Although the content is usually reasonably late game, he is very chill and fun to watch
---
Quality response thanks for making the sub better
---
Make a beginner clue reward that attaches to the fancy/fighting boots and removes their negative offensive bonuses, there are no boot options in f2p for range and mage!
---
ah neat, so the w345 economy stays in w345 :) and it won't be overflooded with cheap skilling gear.
---
Makes in sick in the stomach
---
You still get fewer points for being low level, sadly.
---
Because they get no information what the update will be. Changes for clients have to be done right after the updates so they run propperly again.
---
ü§îüëÄüòÇüëÄü§îüòÇ
---
Cool :)
---
I don't think it'll be many though haha
---
I'm literally not playing because I can't paste in my ridiculously long password from my password manager. I forget how much I take RuneLite for granted and the OSRS team really need to make the OG client better 
---
Totally support this. I get that they are going for consistency among mmo‚Äôs, but why not adapt it to the rs gems that already have an inherent rarity scale. 
---
Combat brace = noob
---
Something tells me there would be no way to have this happen sequentially. You'd, at best, be able to set it to like, *eat this type of food* and that's it. But even with that, I'm pretty sure since that would work off of inventory spaces, and not hard-coded slots like prayer slots, they may not be able to even pull that off.
---
[Can confirm that Jagex ignores it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/axjuaf/submit_your_questions_for_this_weeks_qa_060319/ehu04wq/) I'm just going to extend that list every week.
---
You break the jar... awww imagine you actually did PvM to do clues, imagine it being viable xD
---
Ok nice, I'll check him out
---
Nerds keep downvoting me even when asking a legit question, sad!
---
You gain a significant advantage. 
---
Every hp lvl over 50 is useless in f2p pking. 
---
Perfect build would be like:
---
40 att 99str 1 def 93range 50hp 1/13/31 pray.
---
(93 √ó 1.5 = 139.5)
---
I shit my pants once because I was trying to get to the next point in my quest before I took a shit but I took a wrong turn and had to back track and it took too long and I just shit myself.
---
Ayiza is a pretty good streamer to watch since he's currently doing mostly mid level content that you can get to rather quickly
---
Imagine paying 1mil in coins when you could unlock a permanent drop spot to the bronze, steel/iron dragons and never do that long walk again.
---
I'm pretty sure it's just because the gloves follow the same metal progression that all other armor/weapons follow (bronze to dragon) with the logic being that after dragon armor at 60 defense, you get barrows at 70, so the gloves after dragon are barrows. 
---
I only have used osrs client and yall sound like the game is unplayable without runelite. It‚Äôs literally a 2007 game. 
---
He did say still questing
---
they are also able to check who was affected and at what time, along with the deadline being last sunday.
---
I don't pk so I would just skip the question, but I am pretty sure it wouldn't pass a poll if it would work in PvP.
---
Probably did it on one of the unrestricted worlds or whatever.
---
I leave read receipts off except for a few people, so I never have unread notifications. Pretty sure most people do the same 
---
I think it's more to do with all of the threads asking about RuneLite. This happens almost every update, you'll be ok without it for a few hours.
---
It‚Äôs 50/50 you either get it or you don‚Äôt 
---
Use a calculator
---
Oh you broke broke

Alright bro you stated your point 3 times 
---
Just learn English, you arrogant French plonker

you say that you're invisible but PKers will sense the spade and follow the scent until the end of days

Why would you go through typing all that and then tell the actual reason in your last phrase?

Got some good items in my first 40. Since then I've gotten 1 90k piece and I'm almost at 100...
---
I have 55kc at barrows with no drops......settled I'm beginning to not like you :(

I'm lvl 124 and I use Gaurdian boots for slayer. So what?

Lol I'm the guy on the right. What a small world

They knocked your internet off and had your details, probably from a bad runelite or a quitting stream
---
Git gud
---
It's the ogre bellows, it turns the swamp bubbles gay before you pump it into the frogs
---
Brainlet huh... 
---
100% more likely to have 2 3rd age drops from one clue
---
I wish the collection log were retroactive as well. I pretty much filled out all of the easy rewards getting my spade, but found out about the log afterward :(
---
Meet Ash, my ass locked ultimate ironman
---
####only 12mins....sadly disappointed

Does anyone else think settleds 1/6 drop rate for Barrows chests is kinda bullshit lol.

Did you click a link in a twitch channel lately? 
---
What's OSBuddy? /s

---
RISKY CLICK OF THE DAY.

EDIT: For a moment after opening at work, I realized and quickly closed it. Like, oh shit. The SysAdmin is gonna' be pissed. Then I realized that's me, and I'm the only one who checks those browsing logs. I need coffee.  
---
Lol thst fatass thing from the little mermaid 
---
I‚Äôm willing to bet jagex reviews accounts that are reported like this. However, if you have never botted, or are not actively botting, then no action will be taken against you at this time.
---
That is if you even talk to them ;) jk I love my pures
---
I'd love to know what your insane money maker is with those stats lmao most obvious case of bond buying I might have ever seen 
---
He's a good content creator but no I don't think the hype is... As good as everyone says.. 
---
Also the fact that he has a 1/6 drop rate for Barrows... Kinda makes me wanna vomit lol.
---
They already did?

---
There‚Äôs too many tiers to use the stoplight color code. 
---
Your account is pretty unbalanced. Try doing some quests if you like them. Rfd is specially important, along with a fire cape if you don't have it. Then you can train a bit slayer and round off those 10-and-under stats
---
High construction is amazing, but I don't think it's a good idea to invest so much of your bank into it so early in the account. You seem to enjoy combat, so I recommend getting some gear and making more money that way
---
I was once tight with someone on CS:Go for like a year and a half. Then a few moths after not speaking to him, due to family-ish reasons. He tried to scam me out of skins, knowing that I had a good inventory at the time.
---
Just don't trust anybody man, it's not crazy hard to get the GP to buy a bond, just takes time and people don't realise that friends can give you more than saving some time. They can give you memories that can stand the test of time, but 20mil gp in a fucking game is worth more than that, apparently..
---
(in fairness, my CS:GO skins are worth actual money, and I heard that guy ended up buying a decent gaming PC from scamming, and gambling too.. cunt)
---
lmao you saying i didn't get the point of his post.
---
kid i was making my own point
---
It‚Äôs out of place because no other piece of content does scaling. Who thought that was a good idea to begin with?
---
Obviously we don‚Äôt want the same gp for killing an easier boss that‚Äôs why I said cut off scaling at 110 or let us choose to scale it to 126.
---
Every other piece of end game pvm is balanced for pures by knowing that their self imposed handicap will lower their kills/gp per hour. Raids is like yeah we make the bosses a bit lower hp so here‚Äôs 20% less loot per damage dealt.
---
nah its not
---
That‚Äôs a problem with any ranked game and in the end, those people will just lose to people at higher ranks. It‚Äôs nothing to worry about really. 
---
If you‚Äôre worried about people doing it for rewards then you‚Äôre silly because you (like almost everyone else) probably already did it to get Rune Pouch.
---
I wouldn't mind some of these changes, but I don't think F2P should see major content polls like this. I think it is best for F2P to get a small trickle of content, like the recent Ring of Forging and perhaps the next Giant Boss later this year.
---
Perhaps they could get stuff like the Blurite Crossbow, Agility, and some Members Areas like A Soul's Bane, but those updates should be considered carefully to make sure they don't have too big of an impact. For example, adding Blood Runes and Wave Spells is what I'd say is too big of an impact; even ignoring the F2P PvP stuff that is something that seems better kept as P2P and it also seems a bit too high-level for F2P, which generally ends around the 50s for most direct content even if level scaling still plays a role.
---
Or ... you could just wait for the plugins to get fixed and not pay for a worse overall client.
---
Why are you so against it?
---
Nah, Nieve's panties unlock at 99 slayer.
---
damb daniel
---
Well you can rest easy knowing she won't have much of a social life anymore
---
Having 5 clues at once isn't exactly pooling them bro
---
Nobody gives a fuck
---
Oh just give it to them. When we won all of the brackets of the first jagex clan cup RoT paid off several members to spy for them in hopes at least one of them would be in the 10v10 against them... but only those of us that were stacked went into that fight, so they wound up losing every single bracket. We bullied RoT for two years to the point where they literally paid team sp33dy and Jaja to hit all of our fights until Jaja decided to just merge into RoT.
---
AF closed and the rest is history.
---
They got bullied so hard that I can‚Äôt really complain that jagex haven‚Äôt taken it down. We put a lot of RoT kids on suicide watch, and made one of my long time RS friends step down from leadership in RoT because of it.
---
Miata is a very beloved make
---
When I first read that comment I literally laughed for like 20 minutes. You‚Äôre a legend sir. 
---
Rot owns Jagex 
---
I don't see an issue with this, as it is not an in-game event.  At most they will send out an announcement. 
---
You‚Äôre probably an idiot that says no to every update u gay
---
just quit loser. the game is more popular then its ever been.
---
Safe bet.

---
why not both?
---
I believe you are incorrect. 
---
&gt;  It‚Äôs literally a 2007 game.
---
My thoughts? Doesn't really matter. Some jokes or funny lines won't translate well though, but that's none of my concern since I'll play in english even if the game was translated into my native language.
---
They'd be barrows gloves if you completed RFD, dw about it, people just like to make the joke.
---
It's Duradel and Nieve not Duradel and Steve.
---
Pffft, ever hear of entity hider?
---
If you complete 10 hard clues in a row without skipping , I think personally, you should be allowed 1 free hard clue task skip. Like how the slayer system works
---
a repeatable goutweed-type game that offers thieving xp with maybe a small reward. i like it.
---
Not just 1 but 2

you act like all the people they hacked and stole from had something to do with that

automatically
---
in fairness i'll probs never use it because i'll forget i can after so many years of doing it the old way.
---
Hahahaha
---
It's insanely dumb that this works differently in pvm and pvp.
---
If fights are decided by who does one extra click to use a spec, then the PVP is stupid. 
---
Get your facts straight and neck it. West is a good guy
---
It really isn't that big of a deal. Complete 10 clues and you get the chance to re-roll one step of one clue? Sounds like a good idea really. Can't be abused, doesn't make the game any easier, just a bit of QoL update when you get some step you can't do. 
---
I think you got epic and legendary switched up
---
Well vote no then. That is what the poll is for dude.
---
Biggus dickus
---
no it is fine just get good
---
Are you that dumb?
---
I mean yeah, but when a free fire giant world only takes 3 hops max to find, I don't take the "well I'm a higher level and this game is about competition" route, I just hop 3 fucking times and get my own. 
---
thx for the support
---
And then everyone clapped

This is what you get for using a third party cheat client.

Ick those icons. Toss on those OG 2006 icons boiii.

I think Beretot's advice is good, I would use achievement diaries as a way to path through training skills. Each diary should change up what you're training a little so things dont get stale.

Failed two polls

Cool thanks

Sweet, I appreciate the rundown! I'm only very, very recently getting into endgame stuff, so I'm glad things like this are being highlighted or talked about.

It failed two polls

Yeah. Saradomin wizards always hit me at least, whereas the Armadyl/Bandosian guards don't ever. 
---
It just feels like Elites are easier than hards in the current state.
---
How storing individual clue pieces would make UIM easier, or how it would save IM players bankspace?
---
A lot of IM players want to have unique items, but don't necessarily care for duplicates of said fashionscape items. By storing individual pieces, it becomes easier to collect stuff like croziers, cloaks, vestment robes, etc, without cluttering bankspace. This is also useful for clue steps, bursting tasks, and organizing your stuff.
---
It also becomes useful because suddenly you can store enchanted robes, which equal mystic, thus not needing bank space until you get ahrims / ancestrals. Similarly, blessed dhide pieces could be stored individually, whereas nowadays the coif and vambs simply aren't worth using most times. 
---
And don't even get me started on UIM. They would benefit even more, both in early and mid-game, from being able to store their combat gear (trimmed dhides, the several rune gear god sets. Its a straight up buff for them, which they do not need.
---
I thought the whole point of redwoods was being able to afk them isn't that enough of a bonus lol 
---
exactly, so why not use a program to make the game feel better.
---
Nah. I believe currently the engine just isn't able to render the bank reliably if it had any more items. The bank would start crashing or something like that.
---
Talk about 99 style points
---
game update.  Execute a holding pattern, thing will be back to normal in a few hrs
---
So many people dont do them because they dont want to take a 10 minute break to do a 100k hard clue. Stackables will allow people to play how they want and then knock out all of their clues in one go rather than feeling obligated to leave a slayer task to do one. 
---
It wouldnt be this way if this wasnt efficiency scape these days. But regardless it doesnt have a downside and a lot of people will enjoy it so why not 
---
I would use the default client if it had ground item names. Everything else is just bells and whistles or ezscape addons
---
How could you get 99 strength with 50 hp in 2004 though?
---
Try play vanilla client on a 4k display and report back :)
---
link?
---
Oi I drive an FTO and I feel personally offended by your comment. (NSX dream car tho) I‚Äôve had mad car chats at barb fishing with car guys tho so yeah, weird autism overlap for sure.
---
Couldn‚Äôt they just not allow UIM to upgrade the chest? Done. 
---
Did you not look beyond the treasure hunter image, or the chat box even. 
---
I fail to see the problem here
---
Nah he‚Äôs actually totally right, try it.
---
You can too, cya
---
But it evens out. The person that stays and completes the task may get an extra clue  because of the changes, but it is just as likely the person that leaves to complete the clue will get one less clue due to the reduced droprate. 
---
No, whats dumb is that even if the orb worked in pvp itd still be more advantageous to switch tabs manually due to tick delay. PvPers played themselves lmao
---

When the bot detector 'messes' up, 'falsely' bans your account, and Jagex won't let you request a manual review. So you post your story on reddit, only for a Jmod smackdown. Yeah I've seen these things before.
---
I think you're last point shows the issue is not that most weapons are under-powered, the problem is that scimitars are over-powered. I kind of understand that changing basic weapons would not pass a poll, but realistically the scimitar has always been OP and it breaks the balance of the game. When I gear up for melee, I equip the d scim without a second thought. It's the best, why choose another weapon?

Gz buddy one step closer to that beautiful 99

Yeah it‚Äôs not low level content lol train your freakin skills if you want to do raids efficiently

Mod ash just confirmed this it's update for song of the elves 
---
The game itself is more or less the same. It's all the MTX that fucked it.
---
RS3 as a game is just as enjoyable as OS, albeit much more casual. That's not to say there isn't any really challenging content, most of the grindy stuff has just been made much easier and faster.
---
It's updated. Restart RuneLite.

Ectophial to herb plot is hoppin. I don't think I've seen another person in Port Fattyass the last 20 times I've done a Robin/bonemeal run.

Or you know... maybe people like having inventory space?

background looks like somewhere in Karamja!

In RS3?
---
I absolutely hate the fact that the special attack orb only works in some places.

When jiggleflox wanted to make the game more accessible to new players they surely meant having arbitrary client functions not working when you walk past a certain point.

Having different rules on pvp worlds only would be a decent compromise.

It is unplayable if you have a 4k monitor. Vanilla client is garbage

I already contacted my bank and they will not put the old payments through, and they will only lift the international restriction for 2 hours if you call them, but they close at 6pm, and I don't get home from work until after that.  I left work early yesterday so I could call them before they closed to try to fix this.

Yes there is, mage cape is amazing for pking , hp cape is optimal for volc mine.

I've been lurking the discord for ages aghh finally. I'm so used to RL that I can't play without it at times.

its up
---
If you look at RS3, they're called cullinomancer's gloves 10. They're colored that way to match the best armor in the game at the time they were released (barrows gear). They just called them barrows gloves for RFD. 
---
the smoothed animations are absolutely ass though
---
I play exclusively on mobile, which seems like a different game compared to all the additional features I see streamers have with runelite
---
it's actually funny how many people use the runelite client. Normally there are 300/400 ppl per world at this time. Right now most worlds have 100ish.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if like a good 2/3rd of the player base uses runelite at a minimum now. 
---
It highlights it in your chat box when something vakuable or untradeable drops, decent QoL for me.

From what I've seen, people are more concerned with stacking elite/master clues than medium and easy for the exact reason you explained above.
---
They're worried that if clue scrolls can stack, people will generally be completing more elite/master clues and the prices of the really rare stuff will drop.
---
Personally I could care less if third age maintains its 400m+ price tag. I do clues for fun and as a diversion, so I'm all for stacking up to 5.
---
Not sure why everyone is downvoting someone trying to help. Y‚Äôall wooshing, but he realized it was a joke and said it just in case it wasn‚Äôt.

Y‚Äôall need to look out for each other better, a lot of toxicity in this sub.

Freminik Trials is way more annoying. Once you have the requirements for RFD it‚Äôs actually not bad.

If Jagex thought all that crap in Runelite was necessary for a good gaming experience, they surely would have implemented it by now...

imagine needing a third party client because you're too retarded to use the vanilla client.

This is a great idea, UIM should not be allowed to upgrade their chests as it would be too big of a buff for them.

Perhaps what you're saying is true, but the timeline is completely wrong. By 2007 many people were deep going for 200m in multiple skills. Essence running was designed specifically to boost xp rates. Tens of thousands of people had 99s. That mindset started in 2004 for a lot of people when rs2 released and xp rates dramatically increased compared to RSC. 
---
Basically as long as zezima was known for maxing, everyone else wanted to max too. If not for him it would have been someone else. That's what the hiscores were designed to do.

Run to the other end so the one agroed on you follows. It buys you a second or two.
---
Wow that middle finger is hard to see lol.
---
Only just noticed it
---
No. Before if the avg team level was below 115 it would be downscaled and you would receive less points. Now instead of finding the team average, it just takes the highest combat level. So a team of 2 level 3s and 1 level 115 would be scaled to the hardest raid with most points. 
---
Agreed, I hate that. I like 95% chill relaxed osrs session, 5% chat with my friends, not the other way around.
---
Well lets just make crystal armor less tanky and more offensive. Give it negative magic attack and defense because the only crystal weapons we have are melee and ranged, but also increase the damage and accuracy buff for crystal weapons.
---
40% damage buff and 20% accuracy buff with crystal weapons. This would make it a very cool set to use with crystal bow and crystal halberd.  Crystal Bow would be your DPS and then switch to Halberd for your special attack, this could make the set pretty fun to use. We have to remember that we give up our Slayer helmet to use this set.

Not that I'm trying to justify filthy begging, but there's no way in hell afk slaying is 1.5m an hour.

More bosses selected = higher point multiplier. You can get 1m points/hour easily with blowpipe/dharoks and almost all bosses selected.

It's OK man. A guy came up to me and asked if I could combing a wyvern shield for him. Turns out ge price for the vissage is 8mill less than the shield. Lost 8 mill trying to help fbm

Nah it‚Äôs like OSRS but it doesn‚Äôt look like eye cancer

Absolutely not. I'll happily trade off 1 str bonus for the def and prayer from gaurdians.

Sorry I like my slayer tasks a little more afk and the community just can't handle it.

Thank you!!

&gt; new players to get into pking
---
As someone who never managed to get into pking and still clueless how people even get into it, trust me, it's too late anyway. The very concept of combat level and how it's abusable with pures is enough to keep an average player off any PvP. And don't even start me on skull tricks, tick manitpulation with specs/animations etc. When I want to PvP I simply play Dota.
---
the str bonus will provide you with better defense than the guardians will
---
Sorry you don‚Äôt understand how the game works and won‚Äôt listen to people who do 
---
&gt; im an ironman 
---
Thanks for clarifying, that explains a lot. 
---
He has freedom of speech in real life, in runescape Jagex makes the rules.

The worst part for me was the quest points. I got all the way to dragon gloves and still needed about 25 qp to finish the last step.
---
A very fine war in the wilderness if I do say so myself, thank you for such wonderful loot piles for me to high alch
---
If you use prayer on all your tasks then defense is pointless. Prims give +2 str over guardians and you should be potting on tasks as well so it will always make a difference. Therefore you‚Äôre debating between +2 str (or +1 if can‚Äôt afford prims) and +3 pray. Str easily wins.
---
If you can‚Äôt afford prims then why the hell did you buy an avernic defender? It‚Äôs a better upgrade from ddef to avernic compared to dragon boots to prims admittedly, but it‚Äôs like 4x price. Could‚Äôve bought prims first and any other upgrades then save up for avernic after

Yeah I‚Äôm definitely gonna grab it, seems to pay for itself quickly enough. But I noticed it was 1.2m a week ago but it‚Äôs 1.8m now. Should I just bite the bullet now or wait and see if there‚Äôs a price drop? 
---
Mmm kinky
---
511m
---
No need to add flowers for the flower game 
---
Because it's a shit idea. There are supposed to be clue scroll steps that you can't complete, but they provide an extra push and motivation for you to go get the requirements. 
---
It's a step in the wrong direction, take a couple more and we may as well just remove all requirement clues because the player-base needs to be babysat. 
---
Isn't there an object to go past the Integer limits? Big Number or something like that?

You're totally right, I read that wrong the first time

Would make sense tbh.

Switch to Runelite. She‚Äôs back up and better than all other clients.

But Jmod are also using runelite/osbuddy.

Ah yes reddit, the all agreeing monolith of opinion.

This comment was made by the elite void-rigour-dhcb gang.
---
I suppose it could be added, but it dosn't seem too useful. We already can easily track this in other menus (e.g. Skill Tab, Quest Tab, Diary Tab, and Music Tab) so listing in Log isn't too helpful.
---
Also, how would you handle Quest, Diary, and Music Capes? If a new Quest comes out, you still own the item, which is what the log tracks, but you lose the ability to wear it. So the log would likely just track if you owned (i.e. collected) the item at some point even if you can no longer access it, which is arguably less useful than the other methods to track them.

---
Dragon weapons, if you have membership.  
---
Because there are efficient ways to quickly farm easy and medium clues, complete the clue within minutes, then go back to farming, stacking clues would allow them to stack 5 clues then rapid fire each one after another, increasing their clues per hour significantly. Whereas, someone doing a method that obtains them an easy or medium clue likely isn't going to benefit from stacking any more than two, let alone five
---
Imagine literally throwing away xp. That's the worst kind of xp waste.
---
Agreed, but won't the additional items added to clues reduce the drop rate for rangers? 
---
Let people vote on what they want. It‚Äôs sort of the point.
---
Lmao this community is just filled with some many bitter and lonely alt-right losers

Let's say I have 11 days of membership left. I trained fletching all the way up from 1 to 78 in just a few days and I made around 2 millions while doing so. 
---
Is it worth pushing it to 85 to start making magic longbows or should I start training farming to do herb runs and make some more money that way? Or is there something better to do? 
---
My aim is to make enough money to pay for bonds and yeah yeah I know that a lot of people think that it's best to pay for 1 month to build a decent account and then start making money but for the moment I'd like it to be this way.
---
I'm currently more or less afk training fletching while studying and then when I want to focus a bit more I go around the world questing. 
---
Right now I have 3mil cash (so not that far away from a bond) and my combat skills are in the 50s.

What do you guys suggest?

Hey, everyone, I just tried to do something very silly!
---
Oh dear god

it's okay, your body pillow can't talk.

My thoughts exactly. I don't even think I had linear goals when I was playing the game at 12 years old. All I did was fight random things and fish lol.
---
And all rfd gloves were originally just named "gloves".
---
Thanks praise be
---
Should probably clarify that my post was aimed at the poll in general - I think the idea of stacking clues is absolutely retarded. The skipping is less important but still also a step in the wrong direction imo. Clues provide an extra push for people to do certain quests so that they can dig in a certain spot and elites+ get you to train skills you might otherwise avoid. 
---
If you have all the clue scroll requirements it might not be a big deal but I would guess most of the player base does not.
---
If you click to active the special attack orb, that position is still clickable on the minimap.

From my understanding, the conclusion is that his team's gear will be limited to what he was able to obtain within the confines of Morytania. Excited for what's to come.

Not worth the inv spots, dhcb+ salve + void is already really damn accurate.
---
It can be a little disadvantageous to fight low level monsters. A monster with low HP is going to mean that you get fewer chances to deal the maximum damage to them. More hits more often is good, but lets look at an example.
---
We have a player who can hit a maximum of 5 damage and is looking at monsters to train against. Option A is a monster with 10hp and option B is a monster with 25hp. The monsters with 10hp will spend far more time with 1-4hp remaining than the monster with 25hp. More hp means more chances to land higher hits. Defense levels of mobs are important, but most mobs have pretty trash defense levels tbh.
---
If you're a member, there are lots of good low level monsters (like crabs) that have tons of HP and no defense to speak of. These are the best for straight xp training. 
---
This is on jagex to simply not poll anything which can't be added to pvp, tbh. Players will vote yes to anything which makes the game easier for them, it's up to jagex to filter out the nonsense and only poll stuff which is acceptable game wide. 
---
oki ty =)
---
Good lord this comment section has already proved your point
---
Then he couldnt trade tho
---
With the player base growing at a rapid rate this needs to become the standard if they want people to stick with the game :)
---
gotcha, i thought it still made kills faster but im still too broke for dhcb so i didnt actually know
---
Imagine thinking an authenticator delay will help when they need access to your email to remove it in the first place. Also this "they'll have to do their jobs" why the fuck would they create more work for themselves if they already have such a huge back log? Authenticator removal delay would cause more problems than it solves. Sure jagex security is flawed and needs improvement but this isn't the solution. They need to hire more (and better) customer service reps, allow special and capital characters in passwords along with upping the total length allowed, and it would be nice to be able to set a unique separate password for account recovery or be able to link a photo ID to your account. By all means if you really want better account security then you should at least suggest GOOD measures instead of one that creates more, unnecessary work, and would rarely help because they'd already have access to your email at that point.
---
Yeah I know this but somehow I didn't think about it. Touche. 
---
Whatever you do, think about it for a day. Really consider the options, what you want, and picture how you want your life to be. If you think you want to keep playing, play, but keep yourself honest. Own your decisions. The choice matters less than your commitment to it.
---
Whatever you do, make sure it's what you *want*, then commit 100%. Make yourself proud to be who you are, and make sure you're honest to yourself. That way you can be happy. Which I hope you are.
---
I'd say that's more because people don't really give a shit about what men have to say about working in a male dominant industry since it's the norm and already very well documented, and unlike the pride event it doesn't really "force" the player base into it. If the pride event was the same as this and was just gay people talking about their experience in the industry or something it probably would have been fine. Boring as hell maybe, but fine.
---
I agree that the split makes it really annoying, but with how ree happy some members of the pking community can be, A lot of things will not pass because it will "lower the skill ceiling". See the 4 resizing spell-book icon polls for example

they always make it about women...never about men, this is why this is unnecessary.
---
yes obviously a higher level account is going to be slightly better at raids, assuming both players are competent. This doesn't take away from the fact that pures can still do sub 30 raids without an issue in normal raids. People who have an issue with scaling raids to not allow accounts with below 115 cmb are just gatekeeping for the sake of gatekeeping. 
---
Yikes is a good response 
---
Right, that's what I'm saying, and I think it's a good thing 
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I enjoyed doing revs in peace for a while.
---
It's fletching pretty profitable? Just started playing again recently, never gave a second thought to it. 
---
3rd party clients usually take a few hours to update on Thursdays.
---
I don't mean to be rude but I'm curious as to what is the point of this thread... Why did you want to tell some random strangers on the internet about your decision to quit?
---
One thing is hilarious though: even though it's irrelevant to this topic, you still managed to tell us you're an Ironman BTW.
---
Pretty sure bludgeon is always better.  However, I don‚Äôt think the hasta is much worse.  I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll notice a difference tbh
---
Settled makes not that ridiculous grinds seem like they are so ridiculous. Like he did a 4k hour grind to get 99 herb so we know he can grind on his UIM.
---
I like how Verf just kind of does the grind, and shows you the results. It's took him 30 hours to get a shit clue scroll, and the next day he is back at it.
---
I think both series are very good and should really be rated about the same
---
Same, core combat mechanics shouldn't be different in PvP and PvM. 
---
I played the heck out of runescape as a younger lad, and recently (within the past year or so) picked it back up. My biggest question that I've had since even way back then is: "How can I tell or how do I know when I will be able to actually fight a monster?" Like, a lot of quests say things like, "Must be able to kill a level X monster" and I never know at what point my combat level is high enough to be confident that I would be able to kill that monster. For the most part, I've been operating on the idea that I should be able to kill any monster that is roughly double my combat level, assuming I pay attention to the actual fight. That strategy makes me wonder, though, about the really high level monsters/bosses. How can anyone fight those monsters that are lvl 300+ given that if your level is 99 in all the combat stats, you would be combat 120-something?
---
Lol
---
your best bet would probably be looking at ge tracker. It seems fairly accurate in my use of it but I do not know how susceptible it is to price manipulation it is. I have only really used it for fairly commonly traded items so I can't speak for it's accuracy on much rarer items
---
Thank you for raising this, it doesn't happen on the official client so it seems to be an issue with 3rd Party Clients. Remember to check that the bug is reproducible on the official client to ensure that it is something we can fix.
---
YOU. FUKKIN. KNOW IT.
---
Litteraly happend today for me 60 attack master race
---
Not sure, some monsters give more exp per damage than others, so it might not be as unified
---
Yeah, making longbows and stringing them is profitable and some bolts are. I did bolts until I could do yew longbows and then that until I could do magic longbows.
---
You can buy yew logs and do it. It is faster and more profitable than magic.

good!
---
That's exactly what I'm afraid of tbh. Its ezscape, it takes away from what treasure trails is. I don't like that it takes away from the decision you have to make, "do I stop killing hellhounds to do this clue?". To me it just feels like it completely breaks the spirit of treasure trails. I get why people will vote for it, it's super convenient. But that doesnt make it good for the game imo.

Will the beginner clues if they pass, be in implings?

#CHARLIE SHEEN DESTROYS LIBTARD WITH FACTS AND LOGIC XDDDDDDD

Yeah so the thing in runescape is that protection prayers are fucking broken. You could give a monster 10 million attack and strength with a combat level of 50000 but if it can only melee you literally just turn on melee protect and you can kick it to death at combat 50 lol. When you're researching how to fight quest bosses the main thing you need to know is "what do I pray, and if I'm praying what exactly can still hit me?" 
---
Most quest bosses are pretty 1 dimensional and really aren't very threatening as long as you have  protection prayers. Until you're getting up to grandmaster quests like mm2, ds2 etc. You don't have to worry about much of anything as long as you have 43 prayer.

If you got membership through the application, I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre on IOS since you were talking about itunes.
---
you would go to the AppStore, click on your profile icon in the top right. 
---
Once you‚Äôre in there go into your account info by clicking your account icon again and scroll down till you see subscriptions.
---
You should be able to take off membership from there. It is a little bit hidden but definitely not enough to flame the company because you get heated over nothing.
---
By all means if you want your untrimmed cape to be a memorable one, work for it. But don't listen to the shit echo chamber tell you not to get the cooking/fletching capes early on, they provide a GREAT cape bonus + prayer bonus with no combat requirements and are very easy to get at a low level.
---
At the end of the day it's your way you want to play, the idiots around you with 1,000 total level shouldn't affect your opinion on how you want to play.
---
The main problem with the cape rack is that it requires construction levels to build as well as its pretty hidden when you compare it to just having it in the collection log as it can have amounts included (say for example a pker buys a ton of range capes or someone has bought 1k max capes for the hell of it, all that info could be tracked by the player).
---
As for community backing with a comp cape, it's more a point of contention between people who will never achieve it and people who will,  and the people who will never get it probably take up 98% of the community.  With OSRS hitting its 6-year birthday, it should be about time that we get something for the people (I should point out that I am years away from getting close) who grinded or will grind out everything in the game without having the inferno max cape as the "placeholder" for a comp cape.
---
Tl;dr I should definitely drop out of my programming classes
---
Woodcutting, fletching, cooking, firemaking are all of your "noob 99's", anything else and you're good, if you have bank to spend herblore and construction are some of the most impressive skillcapes as they're literally just showing off how much you've spent.
---
Yes because I'm a ragin bull just going insane! Ahhh! Dude I just think you RL players suck, not much to it.

Ironman can get the black mask at 58, this is just a addition if they have a 95. I'm not asking for the slayer helmet to have it effect removed.
---
The brimstone ring currently is the jack-of-all trade master at none sort of item.
---
And nah i think this idea is cool, you give a bunch of flawed arguments.
---
The tome and the mask already stacks. Why wouldn't the ring.
---
Void shouldn't stack with the ring for same reason why Salve amulet and Mask doesn't stack.
---
Salve and Ring won't stack either but i didn't have to mention that anyway.
---
You can take a regular def pot and experiments won‚Äôt be able to hit you at all, I see pyres there all the time. Took me around 3 days to go from 60 to 70 defend about a week to get 80 str from 70, if you don‚Äôt afk it‚Äôs like 45k-60k an hour for my stats 
---
I want to agree with you, but with my historical and anecdotal knowledge of being on the internet, they will most definitely not-not look at it. Anonimity makes people do the absolute dumbest crap.

Why not both?

Or ya know let‚Äôs flush out/ fix the rest of the map first please so much work to do already
---
Thank you for raising this, it doesn't happen on the official client so it seems to be an issue with 3rd Party Clients. Remember to check that the bug is reproducible on the official client to ensure that it is something we can fix. 
---
To be clear however, this is because the client thinks you are also clicking on the minimap and so moves you to where you clicked. Nothing to do with special attacks.
---
Really amazing how the actions of a minority has sever drawbacks for the rest of us, right? Conformation bias is harsh in this game.
---
No 3.8L? Might steal his girl but it sure won‚Äôt be fast l0l
---
In my opinion, any skill cape is an accomplishement whether small or big. I've only had both fletching and cooking capes, both of which still take time (maybe not as much as the others, but it still takes time and dedication). Now, in my opinion again, if you go flaunting a cooking cape or the likes with your combat gear, that's where it becomes "noob". If you're just skilling and ragged out, a cheap skill cape will look fine.
---
Ye like that bald bitch Vondy at Trearch. He's a nerd but he sucks at developing games. 
---
Imagine actually doing agility from 1-30 instead of doing tourist trap
---
I'm pretty sure this change was mainly to appeal to mobile players, out of which I don't think many players are PvPing on mobile (sure, there will be a select few). Try doing a gear swap to a spec and back, on mobile. Without using the new orb. The orb spec was a much needed change for all mobile players.

Oof
---
Seriously man?  Clues are barely worth doing BECAUSE they're so easy to come by, especially with imps and ham members.  
---
Yeah, people do stop their task for mediums and go do it, but after early levels you stop getting tasks outside of dags that drop easy/medium clues.  Cannoning dags is the first argument I've seen for it, but imo its the opportunity cost of staying for extremely high slayer task.  And saying its convenient for everyone is overexaggerating it.  The odds of you getting multiple clues in a single task is low, and if you're going to sit there and tell me you really need to be able to stack 5 medium clues because of the near impossible chance to get all 5 within 100 or so kills, then you're either trolling me or don't understand odds.
---
I just laid out a method for easy abuse.  I can make 400k an hour camping an eclectic spawn keeping stackables and alching the rest, and stack 5 clues in 15 minutes.  Because each clue step can be completed within a minute, you can easily churn out all 5 clues back to back before needing to return.  
---
I don't appreciate you trolling me, or you're obviously not capable of reading and understanding a discussion, your arguments aren't valid and you're just continuing to make general statements without any thought.  Just because you think it would be convenient for 'everyone' doesn't make it so.  And just because you don't do clues or care about clues doesn't mean everyone else doesn't.  
---
Do yourself a favor and don't vote in the poll, since you clearly don't understand the reprocussions.
---
Can u get me a sub? 
---
How do you find the source code?
---
I've found that if you click the left side of it where the number is rather than the orb itself, it doesn't have that problem. Still bad design for those click-boxes to overlap though
---
If I could only choose one to keep, it would be the clue scroll assistance 
---
There are a lot of money doublers at the GE. Give it to them, so you have twice as much!

You helped him scam you =/ Sorry that happened.

Because if this qol update was to be included universally the very loud vocal minority pkers and streamers would scream and cry constantly and have it repolled until it failed because muh devalued tab switching skills

Yes summer pie is fine way cheaper than teleport

*cries in hardcore ironmeme*

maybe go for a bossing pet or fill up your collection log?

Hey now, guardian boots are swell for mega afk slayer

Beckpeck

it has really high dps, especially the toxic trident. It also has the same op mechanic that blowpipe has where you can 1 item rag with it very well because its ammo is stored within itself. I still think scales and darts should fall out if you die with a blowpipe while skulled, makes no sense that it doesn't.

Does it make a difference?

Jagex is just weird sometimes. When I watch the weekly Dev Q&amp;A stream it's sometimes like they have no idea what they are talking about and forget things that they themselves have proposed. They read a question, awkward silence and discussion, then after 5 minutes of everyone staring at each other and trying to avoid saying yes/no Gambit will say "Well ok, so to answer your question that is something we will consider down the road", which is obviously just a nice way of saying no. 
---
The Tasakaal added in Kebos Lowlands were probably inspired from them because they just like the Dev Q/A they just sit in their chairs high and mighty and give off a false aura of being able to grant miracles and wishes, when the reality is they are unable to do half the things they claim they could do. 
---
I think on the one a month ago they brought up a question about the Graceful Outfit pieces individually giving a bonus to agility recovery. Full set is 30% faster, so it's common sense that if there are 6 pieces each one should give 5%. This already passed polls, they just never added it, then brought it up during the stream with no clue in the world how to do it and make two poorly worded strawpolls that failed and then said "Oh well I guess no one wants it".

Then shame on you

Is it equality with a special day?

Good idea

Good point, this is true. Attack styles do matter sometimes.

I do feel handicapped without it after only using it for a few months

Ngl that suggestion sounds like shit
---
Being a noob is the best time youll ever have in runescape, enjoy the experience. I wish i could experience all the gear upgrades and irrelevant skilling methods i would do. 
---
I honestly think when you lose membership it defaults you to lumby. I think you might have lost your progress. 
---
1bil would b cool
---
Salve stacks with void, so why wouldn't it stack with the ring?
---
You're chalk full of flawed arguments yourself bud.
---
Also the brimstone ring is literally made to be the tribrid item, as well as the new BiS for mage, as everyone felt mage needed the buff.
---
The ring won't ever be able to be imbued, and there likely won't be a point where there's a ring like it that has better stats.
---
I agree that we need some variety when it comes to the slayer helm, as once you hit 55 slayer it's basically a permanent helmet on most mains pre-max. But any changes or additions should exclusively be on the helmet slot as that's what the current system is balanced for.
---
Personally I'd like to see them add the ability to upgrade the slayer helm like they have it in RS3, where you'd just increase the def stats of the helmet, but that would be more than enough.
---
Serious question, why is crafting not on this list? I'm running diamond bracelets right now and it feels nearly identical to when I was stringing yew longs for fletching. Is it because there are other more expensive alternatives?
---
It's necessary because of the fact that the industry is filled to the brim with men, and if you're a woman who wants to join the industry, the chances of you getting an opportunity to hear another woman's experience are very slim, as compared to a man's.
---
A men's one wold be unnecessary, not the opposite. "Here we have a panel of majority of our employees, talking about what they experienced as the dominating demographic in this industry." Lmao.
---
Same and for 6k of loot :c
---
Yeah... hes saying if he brought them but didn‚Äôt get the next piece he wasted invy spots for nothing 
---
A scam is when you deceive somebody out of their money. 
---
The most common form of beggar is the alt/bot that pretends to be a 'cute noob' and asks for a modest amount to train with or get started. They're being dishonest about who they are, and are banking on you fondly remembering being at the noob stage and how good it felt when somebody was generous to you, when they're doing this with intention of profiting off that very impulse. You're not giving to a cute noob who's just "getting started", you're giving to an alt account of an established player and it's unlikely you'd do so if the alt didn't falsely present itself in the way that it does.  
---
Most begging can rightfully be classified as a scam. 
---
Only if you log into a f2p world does it do that, if he renews mems before logging in hes fine
---
So random right. If only there was a generator, of numbers maybe, and maybe they're generated randomly. Oh man what would we call that? 
---
Make a level 8 f2p mage pure and go have some fun lol. You don‚Äôt need to max a zerker to pk
---
Cape Racks are less hidden than the Collection Log; they are a hotspot in a popular room rather than a Book from an NPC or feature of the Adventure Log hotspot. Also, you can buy a Flatpack for it so you only need the level to build the room.
---
As for the number of capes purchased... Why does this need to be tracked? The Collection Log is more for tracking rare drops than how many times your purchased items from a shop. Most of the items it tracks from shops only track once and don't count beyond that.
---
As for the Comp Cape, I think you misunderstand the situation a bit. It is more the Completionist Players who don't want a Comp Cape because of what that does to Comp. If there is a Comp Cape, chances are the larger community will want it to be BiS because "it takes a lot of time to get, so you should be rewarded" logic. But most Completionsit players don't want it to be BiS and only want a cosmetic. If it is a BiS Cape, then players will feel forced to get it and as a result, they will be opposed to new Completionist tasks and want to make the existing ones easier, defeating the point of having a cosmetic to show off Comping in the first place since it ruins what Comping is about. And this isn't just wild speculation either; the Max Cape started as purely cosmetic and it was later polled to gain perks, making it a powerful cape. Assuming the same wouldn't happen with a Comp Cape with how things are polled and repolled is foolish. That said, there are some ideas for other Comp Items like a Comp Staff, but like I said, we don't need to put something on a Collection Log to track Completionist; they aren't the same thing.

Ive had far more toxic pvp encounters then pvm encounters in all my time playing and my Rs3 account is over 15 years old now.
---
I would vote for this. Good item sink, and there's a lot of fun to be had with this ring. 
---
I assume there would be an un-charge option to revert it. If someone is killed with it, does the ring revert when dropped, or do they get the ring that has the special item imbued into it? Would it be untradeable with the item or not? 
---
92=half
---
Ohhhh...
---
It‚Äôs only taking place on Reddit. Fair enough. Don‚Äôt have to give a shit about this then.
---
As a nood I didn't discover the ge for over a week. Real noobs are wasting precious time down in lumby. 
---
I mean, I argue politics on reddit all day and I was against the event.
---
Explicitly political subreddits aren't the same as a video game, I don't know why the guy above is pretending that it's somehow hypocritical for people to have political views and wish for controversial content to not be shoehorned into a game.
---
Have we actually reached the point where people cannot play the game without runelite anymore
---
Yeah, predicting it by being the only one bringing it up. I've never understood how or why any karma whore like you would chose to life such a sad life. But I'll admit, you've found a very milkable community for karma and fake drama/outrage. Good on you.
---
It was around the time of rev caves bc greedy and salty pvmers thought they could deny loot to pkers.  
---
I mean, I guess. But I think it's kind of messed up to point to (this is assuming it goes that way of course, for all we know it may be a totally fine outcome) people misbehaving and being overall toxic as "their fault" for having the panel in the first place. People shouldn't be behaving like that.
---
Hosidius House favor is gained by adding saltpetre to compost, leaving it in bank, then talking to a person when you have enough (.1% favor each). It will combine your whole inventory, so it‚Äôs about as AFK as cooking is. 
---
Well, what happened today was I made a post about oily rod earlier thinking it passed, and someone told me that it didn't pass and linked me the website results.  I did look at the ingame booth after clicking his link, but I assumed that he might have been correct since both sources seemed to give the same results(except that ingame didn't count skip votes in to the percentage).  If skip votes aren't counted, then yes I suppose it passed so hopefully it did actually pass
---
i feel exactly the same as you. even had the same development! Played with alot of friends, and suddenly in high school runescape was for kids and losers. now i'm 22 and, as you said, i don't shout it from the rooftops but if it comes up in conversation i would proudly declare that I play it.
---
They haven't polled a necromancy skill yet. Nieve's panties are still locked content.
---
Or maybe they're 200k short for something and have already sold extraneous stuff in their bank. Or maybe they just got hacked and want enough to buy a dscim and some rune armor. Or maybe they're coming back to OSRS after quitting and giving all their money/items away. When someone assumes the worst of someone else right away, it tells you a lot about them.
---
you can make maple longbows if money is an issue as buying yew or magic logs can get expensive when on the road to 99 :) 
---
Both sand updates. Ironmen act like they are required to spend 50 hours gathering sand as their only option to train crafting. They disregard any crafting method that isn‚Äôt charter ships or spending excessively long amounts of time filling buckets. 
---
Ive never once filled a bucket of sand at a sand pit and I only did 2 levels at charters trying to rush a fury. Somehow (actually using other crafting methods than molten glass) ive stumbled on being 98 crafting. 99 banked but why bother when getting 99 rc will put me over anyway. 
---
If herblore also had best dps potions locked behind high a 90 requirement im sure most irons would start complaining how theres no way to actively grind herb too. They feel entitled to zenyte jewelry and if extremes or overloads like rs3 has ever come im sure most irons would feel entitled to those too

Thanks!

Not if you haven't beat MM2 they aren't. üëÄ ü§§

It's generally not recommended to do this for your first run of membership.  This is because at low levels, there is no moneymaking activity with a high enough gp/hr that allows you to quickly make enough money for a bond.
---
That said, if you were dead set on this, your best bet would be the blast furnace, combined with some other passive money makers.  At low efficiency, you can get between 300k-400k/hr from the blast furnace.  You're going to need to look it up on the wiki, there is too much for me to explain here.
---
For passive money makers, things like farming runs, birdhouses, and doing Varrock diaries to get battlestaves are what I have in mind.  These are quick activities with more or less guaranteed profit , and they help break up the monotony of grinding 1 thing constantly.
---
Even doing all of that, you're looking at 8-12 hours of just grinding gp to retain your membership.  You'll need to do this every 2 weeks, so roughly 4-6 hours per week.
---
However, and the reason this is not recommended for newer players, is because now you are spending a majority if not all of your time on runescape just maintaining a membership, leaving you no time to train combat or level up anything else.  Furthermore, gear upgrades become much more difficult, because any time you buy a piece of gear you are weighing that against getting more membership.  Say you get to a point where the only thing you wanted was a whip.  You would need to do another 8-12 hours of moneymaking to afford the whip, on top of the 8-12 hours you need to maintain your membership.
---
Funnier, more clever title referencing 2 memes = more upvotes. Why are you salty enough to dive into this guys post history lol relax

Honest question: do you PVP or do you want it added to PVP because you know pkers are against it
---
Couldn‚Äôt believe this didn‚Äôt exist in game by default when I got my cape last week! 
---
There's a lot of f2p bots/alts that buy runes from shops and sell to the GE at an incremental profit.  I'd wager thats where the majority come from.  
---
Happened to me! Almost 2 years since my iron man was banned. It was a first time permanent ban too :/
---
Then I'm sorry to say, you're obviously incapable of thinking or even having a proper discussion.  My idea is not only plausible, but I also presented a scenario that is backed by facts.  You can't see any downsides because you just choose not to think.  Your counterarguments to all of my points are boiled down to "Nuh uh your reasons are dumb because I said so".  The next time you look at any discussion, you probably shouldn't waste your time adding your worthless opinions since you're just full of shit.  I do my best trying to give people like you benefit of the doubt and engage in a discussion, but yet again just a waste of time with someone too stubborn to listen.
---
&gt;because then I'll actually do them.

yeah fucking right. That's just what you're telling yourself. Lazy people are going to stay lazy you just want to pretend otherwise

Agreed and to this day, "top" clans such as CT, DK, Fools, JaJa, DF2 , DF, etc are still being bullied by RoT. After seeing Fools hit Rots 2.2k world at revs, and rot pulling 60 people to defend it on 4am, that proved to EVERYONE rot is undeniably the best clan.
---
Every clan either teles out when they see RoT or they plank.
---
Rot is the best clan in the game and has been for awhile now. The statue was EARNED for hard work. something the reddit community doesnt know.

The status won't be removed

Stop making circle jerk threads like these

And keep voting no to PvP updates :)
---
Yeah that's the difference we all have to determine on our own. but a level 3 beggar is a piece of shit.  no one can walk past all the goblins without AT LEAST reaching level 4.......
---
Love the update with the special attack orb being clickable, only issue is when you are spamming the orb and it doesn't register or you're out of SA power you click on the bottom of your minimap which doesn't make it much of a QoL considering it's still better to just go into "Combat Options" and click SA than to hit the orb.
---
Why would PvP players even want this? The orb is so far from your inventory that is is inefficient to even click it. Before you blame pvpers you should look at the vast majority who wanted this, which is mostly pvmers and people who don‚Äôt use f keys.
---
Sit down  brainlet

Not really, but I'm an Ironman so I did it for the dragon bones.

Yes.  I have each window layered, and use the keyboard shortcut alt + escape to cycle through each window.  Doing this I don't have to move the mouse nearly as much, and I can just click the desired step per account, then once I get back to account 1 move the mouse to the next step, and repeat this type of game play.

there were a couple guys in Austin TX a few weeks ago that got attacked and hospitalized by people who were calling them homophobic slurs.
---
Obviously they don‚Äôt care, they aren‚Äôt going to remove something in game because reddit doesn‚Äôt like a specific clan lol
---
I never see blatant racism in public but I see blatant homophobia very often 
---
Presumably both in most cases
---
If it won't pass without "only works in PvM" it shouldn't pass at all.
---
Having the seer's ring become cheaper hurts nobody except the idiot stockpiling them, it makes it a more viable option for people who don't have the bank to afford BiS. Same thing with the warrior's ring vs. the berserker ring. Glory vs fury vs zenyte. Torso vs bandos. Torags vs Justiciar.
---
Jagex is trying not to make everything "BiS or nothing" that way there's more balance to the different players and their varying banks and play styles.
---
Also as far as "magic att vs magic pen" there are plenty of people who hard favor running a higher magic accuracy as this means more of their attacks in general will land, whereas you have your pures who can't wear top end mage gear use the 25% chance to pen to get their hits as well as the max main gear setups that will run it because they already pull enough magic attack bonuses from ancestral, kodai, etc, so it makes more sense for them to get the extra magic pen.
---
Almost every item in the game has it's purpose.
---
Finally as for why the slayer helm effect should stay in the head slot is because every item in the game has been built and balanced for it's slot versus/with any items in other slots. If you try to move one item to a different slot you'd have to rebalance far more than just that singular item.
---
No RoW(i), and no clue in the bank. Before my first hard clue here I was 230 Jellies, 140 Hellhounds and 630 Green Dragons dry from a hard clue!

Doing this gives a neat domino effect on all the accounts. I really enjoy seeing a trail of accounts walk from point a to point b haha.

No 120 cabbage picking cape smh

I know right? I think we are in agreement?

Where is humanity day? Celebration of the triumphs of the human race as a whole?
---
Why provide pretentious asshats with the chance to shove their existence in our faces(not generalizing to be clear)? As if their lifestyle choices or gender are some sort of accomplishment? 
---
Why should anyone have to care that much if you‚Äôre a man or a woman, who you fuck... or what you look like? It‚Äôs shallow and stupid.
---
Then to take it to a video game where we go to excape these realities in the first place. Thank Guthix that it‚Äôs only on Reddit this time.
---
Easy enough to do right? Just know the max hits with each weapon with eagle eye/ultimate strength, and if they hit over they're out lol
---
Because east side is best side.
---
Haha Thank you! It's gonna be tough, there's no doubt about that. 
---
This is the most retarded thing I‚Äôve ever read. 
---
I think it‚Äôs more that at that point u gotta get ur priorities straight...
---
You're not lying. The quest that are random per account in general are going to be a pain. I'm not looking forward to 12 small favors, either. 
---
One reason, politics. Not everyone wants politics in their game. Unless they do the same thing for international men's day, it's basically picking a side, and a lot of people don't want politics in their games. It's a stretch, but it is a possible why
---
BGS spec while having all the same gear for DHCB on has 75% accuracy with a max hit of 74 damage which means to calculate the average hit (and defence lowered) its .75*74= 55.5 then factoring in the zero you'd hit 25% of the time (55.5*3)/4= 42 damage/lowered defence on average.
---
Anyone who tells you that missing out on a single DHCB hit for a single attack with a max hit of 74 that has 75% accuracy with an average hit of 42 that lowers defence by the same amount is bad at this game.
---
Convenience. Same for the Zeah minecart system, the Portal Nexus and so on

Sure some improvements would be nice, but I think it's a perfectly fine client to play with.

Just fucking happened to me... I have 4 now

That‚Äôs the only reason why anyone would kill green drags

What is wrong with you lol. I gave you logic too. Your idea wont lower the price of rangers or anything. Itll still be better money to sell eclectics on the ge and better efficiency-wise to buy a ton of eclectics for medium clues

People are stupid you dont even need to beg you just look like a noob and stand there and someone will come along and give you gold for not begging.

Thing is.... they are adding a fuck ton more of items, making getting a specific one even harder to get, If clues don't get stackable then it's just going to be overall cancer to aim for anything from a clue. SO this is bascially a poll saying "No" to the entire thing. Expanding on the clues is a good thing, even if changing the formula a little bit to ease the drastic change to drops that it's going to have

Nah, its incredibly important to not add this change into PvP areas.

---
I'm not expecting anything lmao, I'm pointing out why the update Jagex is suggesting has value. I enjoy the game in its current state and will enjoy this update if it happens.
---
I didn't, I just whipped this up as a joke with regards to the latest episode of Swampletics
---
Not the f2p worlds
---
Even if "most begging" (I disagree but that doesn't matter) could be classified as begging, it doesn't make begging a scam per se. 
---
It's Full of kids that want their first 99
---
They only drop 1-3 steel bars at a time. Takes forever. 
---
It was literally just a lazy reskin of a different amulet before. Now it fits thematically into the lore behind it.
---
If they're in a member's world, it makes 0 sense to train on the goblins. You can get 40+ attack, strength, and defence by doing waterfall quest, the grand tree, gnome stronghold, monkey madness, holy grail, and dragon slayer. 200k is enough to get 43 prayer, and a little more and they can afford a few prayer pots and food to get them through the quests. 
---
Having 500k to start an account reduces the total time to get the account going by at least 10 hours, especially if you get 43 prayer. It takes less than an hour for an established account to make 500k. If I lost everything and had to start over, I'd have no problem going to the GE at level 3 and asking for money before trying to make the 500k on my own.
---
Hmm im sure there is a way to see the code tho right?
---
Supporting the lgbt isn't controversial or political. 
---
I'd spend a bill to get 99 rc quickly, it's the fact you cant speed it up with money that makes it so hated
---
Fair enough, but that's exactly what happened with resizable spell icons. It was repolled twice, and the third poll failed by 0.3% with 14k less votes than the first (was over Thanksgiving). By having the poll "should we import the mobile feature" split into filtering and size, then being unhappy with the way the 2nd question was asked, then the 3rd being asked over a holiday with no announcement led to us being stuck with a half baked feature that looked like crap. It's since been cleaned up some and looks better now but in the end the first poll passed by a good margin (83% or something) and the third failed by 0.3% and that's what we're stuck with
---
muh lore

Please God let them not do that. I'm pushing through elites now and I really don't wanna do another fucking tier lmao

A steel knife is useful and not pointless. A stone knife is useful but pointless because you can just use a steel knife. Extend this to runescape account types, pointless isn't the same as useful. 
---
If it‚Äôs a f2p world do the members areas still exist? Hmmm
---
I thought they fixed that a few updates ago?
---
I've witnessed myself that there are lurers at raids. They use a throwaway account to host the raid and advertise a scouted raid. The world they've 'scouted' the raid at happens to be a PvP world.
---
Sure, the victims are stupid for not realizing it. Especially considering that there is a warning before you switch to a PvP world. However, that doesn't mean that luring is acceptable. 
---
Even if OP is whining and trolling, I still think its good advice for others.
---
Yes, that's the joke. Not the fact that you should maybe set your priorities differently if you don't own a place to live but somehow have a pc+internet connection. That's definitely not what he meant. 
---
No, thanks bye
---
^^^^^^small ^^^^^^yikes
---
\&gt;they've deleted it for some reason now.
---
it's cause those numbers are really bad.
---
rigour has way more uses than bis melee lol.
---
Sounds like a similar bug that used to happen with the world map orb a month or two ago. They finally fixed that, so shouldn't be too hard to fix this one. Submit a bug report and if enough people do that, we should get a fix as early as next week
---
thank you for the explanation! I've been chided before about being chintzy with braces on ifs, for loops, etc, I didn't know that it has caused such problems before.

---
I absolutely can.
---
This is 100% on the people who voted fault. Whose else would it be?
---
The only reason Jagex does dumb design decisions like this is because the community begs for them. 
---
Do you not remember the multiple polls over spellbook filters, and the outcome?
---
1. I have never seen that and I've been playing since day 1. and
---
2. How is it a scam? More money can always be used, and people have a different definition of need. If they were saying "Help, my account was hacked, can you please spare 200k?" when it's not true, that's scamming. Repeatedly saying "I need 200k" isn't scamming. 
---
I would talk about it but I find talking to people boring. Especially small talk. Such a pointless thing.

Anyway - playing this game is nothing to be ashamed of.

Here's a piece of code from a very very old server of mine, npc drops.

    if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 50) { //KBD

    	} else{

    	}

    	if(randomRoll == 0){

    	} else if(randomRoll == 1 || randomRoll == 2){

    	} else if(randomRoll == 3 || randomRoll == 4 || randomRoll == 5){

Please, elaborate how its a political movement.

Please do the whole meme version!

If he is Level 100+ and writes "I need 200k" how is that scamming? It's stupid and sad but definitely not scamming.

would be no way to prove you didnt just trade gp over from your main

I wouldn't personally say "full of" nazis, but yeah there are an extraordinary number of assholes that play this game. But there are a lot of normal people too! I think most of them just leave their public chat off and mind their own business lol.

the only reason why i'm not on rs3 doing clues is cus their bank fucking sucks, and they decided to not go through with the bank rework.

So basically every day? This already happens lmao

There‚Äôs something about people saying cringe that makes me yikes even harder, like people can‚Äôt think of anything original to say or just ignore something they find oof-y, and then feel the need to respond to something with, ‚Äúcringe‚Äù like it‚Äôs a meme response now.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt even know what it means or what it‚Äôs supposed to sound like lol
---
Nice. 
---
Scythe, you want big slow hits really. 
---
I never said they were the same thing. I said my reasoning would apply regardless of the word you use. 
---
Have you tried using a spade on the pile of compost west of Draynor Manor?
---
You can literally faceroll any boss in the game after you've afk'd all of your stats to 120 in 6 months.
---
Idk if I'd call that enjoyable or "challenging".
---
Likely not. What we get as users has already been compiled from Java (what you see here) into Java byte code. I'm more familiar with x86 assembly, but if Java byte code is anything similar, it's basically unreadable to humans

Alright, I'd trade him a coin instead of the usual bottle of poison.

Anything that causes pvpers to quit the game is good in my book

Libraries exist. Not all homeless people are smelly dudes living in an alleyway 24/7. There are homeless people living out of a car and showering at their local fitness center. It's entirely possible that they're going around during normal business hours trying to find a job and go to the library after 5 and play some rs while searching for jobs. Don't be so quick to assume the worst about people.

---
Pretty sure they don‚Äôt, I tried to buy jewellery from Port Sarim which has 0 stock by default but had stuff in stock. The game didn‚Äôt let me saying I can‚Äôt buy items that aren‚Äôt part of the original stock, but I could still see them. 
---
Did you have 2FA on your e-mail and on your account? It's notoriously easy to brute force a password alone to access an account.
---
They don't *need* 200k, they're just too lazy to go out and make the gold themselves. A lot of the time I see them wearing 20 mil plus outfits, so I assume they're wanting people to think they'll get something in return if they give them 200k.
---
Bp is pretty much more op than tbow, ignoring running costs. 
---
The rune scim is actually close to the same dps against things with very low defence. The d scim is a significant upgrade.
---
Tournaments were a fantastic update. 
---
If you don‚Äôt care about pets or mutagens, and are there solely for a profit i wouldn‚Äôt use them at all unless you are using near maxed gear. 
---
 I personally would use them if you can do 2+ kills every trip without needing much/any prayer. 
---
If you‚Äôre going for the pet and/or mutagens PoH -&gt; TP every other kill unless you get wrecked the first kill. 
---
The mapping of skilling via what people drop at the GE would be super interesting. 
---
I mean it would just make the UI more consistent. I can click on all the other orbs, why not special attack? 
---
&gt; Having the seer's ring become cheaper hurts nobody
---
So you're cherry picking what is okay to devalue vs which is not. Mages who cannot afford the Seer ring has the Lunar Ring (+2) or Beacon Ring (+1) etc. 
---
Still doesn't change the fact the idea was poorly allocated.
---
&gt; Finally as for why the slayer helm effect should stay in the head slot is because every item in the game has been built and balanced for it's slot versus/with any items in other slots. If you try to move one item to a different slot you'd have to rebalance far more than just that singular item.
---
According to who? This is literally something you just made up. If you can provide a strong argument how this is imbalanced where i already debunked then i'm not convinced.
---
Afaik the main concern is the strength bonus, which is tops a -1/+1 difference. Negligible. If it's about Void/Blowpipe, i already stated the slayer bonus would not stack. Other than that i don't see any glaring balance problems.
---
I'm still not convinced see how giving this ring the mask effect is broken, It could be locked behind a 1k slayer point cost and even require Konar a 1mil gp payment + sink the black mask. 
---
Yeah that's a good chunk of this game community. A lot of them have bad social skills cause they don't go outside.
---
Since the Dragon Sword is basically worth the same as the D Long there is no reason to use it anymore except purposefully or due to lack of knowledge.
---
Lol, a few people going for max vs people going for 200m all. I hope you understand how ridiculously different that is.
---
Nah, you've made it pretty clear lol. 
---
I also find it funny that you hold both the opinion that you should have pride events/recognition, but somehow aren't still tied to the history and current actions of your social group. 
---
What would you even talk about at a straight pride event. "Never caused us issues for thousands of years" isnt exactly a compelling chant.
---
Private server feature.
---
I get harassed at PC on a daily basis for wearing barrows armor. Someone is seriously going to tell ME about wasting money for repairs (that I completely cover with PC reward coins) while they are wearing full dragon credit card armor. 
---
Neither are half a million things, which don't get put into game.
---
So Runelite's client sends it information to the OSRS servers which is what they recieve. If Runelites client stops receiving input. It would send the OSRS server the code to command a teleport.
---
If Jagex servers are the reason it goes down then Jagex should automatically fix the loss of status, which is crazy they don't do that already. 
---
I literally just pointed how that that wasnt the case. I addressed that in the post you responded to.
---
To be fair, if you're doing vorkath I dont think you're typing to anyone on mobile at the same time so I'd just close the chat for the kill. That being said, it's super annoying when you have the chat box open and the keyboard opens on a misclick and messes up whatever it is I'm doing so I understand your frustration. Maybe a better idea would be a feature that could be toggled on and off that let's us swipe quickly up from the bottom of the screen to open the keyboard. This would make clicking the chat bar do nothing and could allow clicking through the entire chat box while avoiding potentially costly misclicks. Probably requires engine work but it's an idea.
---
If every 3rd party client broke permanently tomorrow do you think jagex would give a shit? It isn't their job to fix them, that's the whole point lol. If something is broken but only on 3rd party clients then jagex doesn't and shouldn't care.

Crafting cape is the single best teleport to a bank in game. Getting crafting cape early is one of the smartest things you can do. If you see a dude with 99 crafting at low total, you can be confident they know what they are doing and are absolutely not a noob.

You can only spend so much time job searching/"getting your life together". You can't really do walk-in applications during non-business hours, and it only takes a few hours a week to go through all the online job postings. It's entirely possible to spend 40+ hours a week trying to find gainful employment and still spend 40 hours a week on runescape. Especially because you can do a lot of afk skills while searching for jobs. As for access to computer/internet, libraries have both for public access.
---
Imo the special attack orb makes perfect sense in PvP too. Should've just added the function to the game without polling it.

Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay in England about 60 years ago, to this day people are still killed for being gay. Pride exists to remind people that hate and violence won‚Äôt stop people from living their lives.

I binged the entire series so far yesterday! I wanted to see if anyone was talking about it on reddit. It‚Äôs cool to see the similarities and differences of how you and Settled approach the challenge, and also to see you guys chatting. I loved the bit when y‚Äôall discovered the fishing net spawn. 
---
You‚Äôre providing incredible content that I enjoy more than Settled‚Äôs in some ways. I think when more people discover your videos, it will blow up just like Swampletics. I will be thoroughly disappointed if you aren‚Äôt on a Theatre of Blood team together.

A big part of me misses this. I was good at at hustling this way and made good cash. Flipping on the ge has never got me as much enjoyment or gp. But a big part of me likes how quick I can get my supplies. I remember going on forums and making post for stuff. I even remember running lobster my own lobster "business" off forums. Advertising ten times a day while I just caught lobsters for hours a day.

B0aty has 10k viewers, Sick Nerd has 5k viewers. Faux has a hardcore and gets great viewership. Torvesta will have one on Youtube soon. 
---
However they all say once their hardcore dies their viewership drops signifcantly.
---
If Apex Legends can pay shroud like 20k a month to stream their game i'm fairly certain Runescape can pay someone to check each death that occurs on HCIM deaths (About 3 per day ish) and see if it was fake or not.
---
Hardcore is the most streamable part of Runescape, them being cheap isn't a good excuse to not make it a better game mode.
---
Can you imagine B0aty at the ToB? Probably gets 20k viewers that he and runescape won't get now. 
---
Seriously lol
---
Imagine being that desperate to look knowledgeable 
---
No, you literally said it was entitlement, when I am saying there is more than just that. Literally.
---
I mean, maybe. They're both old as shit and nobody quite understands how they remained relevant.
---
Thank you! I don't know how I forgot that. It makes sense though since I know it would be extremely abnormal to be stuck in a quest because Jagex goes really far to foolproof everything. For some reason I was certain that I found the key in the fountain, but I clearly remembered that wrong.
---
I don't think their should be straight pride events.   I never said that. You are attacking me personally when I'm just trying to share my opinions on the stated topic. Also, good luck with the bed bugs ya filthy vegan.
---
Don't cheapen the word nazi by comparing it to these crackpots.
---
Yes, this worked. Thank you!

Quest, what do these things all have in common?

Well the accounts are pointless, but not useless. So I disagree.

Well done! The man in the red shirt in your picture can tell you how old your account is. Ask him what your account age is so you know exactly how much more grinding you have until max. You might get it by the end of the weekend! Good luck :)
---
It's just confirmation bias. Any prominent streamer/YTer plays a lot, and has lots of chances to either have good luck or bad luck. If they get good luck, everyone says "OMG rigged jamflex pls" but if they get bad luck no one cares (and might not even realize since usually videos focus on drops, and not so much on lack of drops). 
---
Also, even if they wanted to, it'd be very technically difficult, maybe even impossible. Mods have said that the game can't distinguish between players because there is no way of keeping unique identifiers to each account. Unless mods are intentionally lying (get out your tinfoil), it would not even be possible to change the drop rate for individual players if they wanted to.

24/7 livestream
---
Yeah wtf
---
You know there no guarantee you‚Äôll get it by 3k, right? 
---
I'm also looking at it from the perspective that there's a lot less Elite steps that take you to the wilderness as well. I've had a hard clue take me to the wildy nearly through the entirety of it.
---
I guess, as you've said, it's not that easy to iron men and lower levels. But when you get to the point where you can do both Elites and Hards with relative ease, you'll start to discover that Elites are less of a burden than hards.

Guardian boots also give a +3 strength bonus

Oops meant black history month

I see where this is going.

I vote no on things I feel make the game to easy. I like removing unnecessary mouse clicks, but not things that drastically increase xp gain or something. 
---
I believe last week someone posted their first rangers on their 2k + med clue grind. So don‚Äôt feel so bad. Gotta top that high score now.
---
I'm just speaking objectively about what youre suggesting. And youre suggesting someone drop free shit for you daily

Doesnt matter since your post failed, it was a good try though. Try playing the game if you wish to achieve anything within instead of begging on reddit üò¨üò¨üò¨ 
---
Ahh yes, the coveted autism cape. 
---
No shit
---
Gotta agree with the rest here, if you fall for this you probably wont make it far anyways.
---
Remember this:
---
1. Jagex will NEVER, and yes, by that I mean NEVER, contact you about your offences and what not using email. Why? TO PREVENT THESE CONFUSIONS. 
---
2. Dont click on shady links. NOTHING that you need is on a sketchy site. 
---
Ive been hacked in my childhood because I got greedy, and chose to see things as harmless just because I wanted something really bad. I havent been hacked in 12+ years now, and I know that Ill never will be because I'm thinking differently now and wont ever fall for it again. Same goes with in game scams. Here are 3 ways to approach a scam. Lets say that someone tells me to "tele to burthorpe and ill give you 100m". 1 approach is just to tele there and blindly follow his instructions and get yourself scammed. The 2nd approach is "w/e, I wont fall for it so I can just tele there and see what happens". This way of thinking is also dangerous, since all this does is giving the scammer a chance to trick you in some way that you probably dont know anything about. The last approach is the one I've used ever since 07, and that is just to ignore him and continue with what you were doing. If he wants to give you 100m, he can trade you and give it to you on the spot.

Yeah, at least with quests these days like MM2 and DS2 the difficulty is fair and you have to learn the mechanics of the boss instead of pray melee before you do X or you get whopped.

For stackable items maybe it requires a larger number to avoid this? Or stackables don't work/always appear as the largest stack.

Theres also the bug with spawn, where if u click it with crumble undead ur character will just freeze until its close enough to explode on you, seems to happen randomly but like 1/10 times.

It was referred to as a pride event on the news letter. Do you want an NPC that talks about Bernie Sanders too?

then it is no longer an item sink and you should make it so they can get the item back so we dont have a you have to get pked to get your item back.

no its random, some nest sources dont contain certain seeds though, but it depends only on where you got the nest, bird house, kingdom, mole, wcing, not your farming level

How do straight white guys get passes nowadays?  No bait, Im just curious.

Loooool nah. Waste of a clue box if you die unless you‚Äôre on a super high step

Maybe they could do a special monster that gives more XP than others

Would you like to explain how it's not possibly a bug?

bad bot

You can just say youre a homophobe lol

I literally made this joke at the GE like 3 days ago. But I said, ‚Äúmy begging only locked ironman‚Äù

Lmao I sure was joking but okay buddy enjoy ur clue scrolls manually 
---
Used the osrs client for like 4 years and it was plenty good enough, but the runelite client is better and after switching to it, it's a little annoying to switch back. It's doable though of course.
---
hopefully with them being ftp they would be restricted to just ftp items or mostly ftp items
---
Since you're bad at the only part of the game that takes skill?
---
This is a nonsensical question. What are you even asking? Average loot value is based on points. If you mean average value of uniques then just take the value of each unique, multiply it by it's weighing number and then divide by the sum of all weighing numbers. 
---
this is a runelite bug not the game itself, need to wait for a runelite update
---
You share with other ironmen 
---
Okay. I just got the impression that you're really nervous about other people calling your "nooby cape" out. 
---
So to get higher tier seeds do I have to use higher tier bird houses? Like if I‚Äôm on maples right now can I not get magic and palm seeds?
---
I agree with what that guy said, but it still doesn't make you right.
---
Pretending that LGBT pride stuff isn't even mildly political, even in Western culture, is just dumb.
---
Gay characters to my knowledge do not exist in Runescape. Neither do horses or the country of Canada. Don't insert RL bullshit into a game. Very easy to understand.
---
Actually, now that he can use higher level training methods so the second half will be even faster! 
---
hm, you can get them multiple times and yes you can loose them if you die in 20+ wildy and if they are not protected. tbh it makes no sense why I have to repeat myself when it's more about just stats and it's to show players that other capes of accomplishment exist besides just skill capes.  
---
That's because the guy in rune is most likely a new player, and its always nice to see new people enjoy your game. Since as long as new players keep joining the game, the game continues to live and breathe. Once an MMO stops gaining new players its not far from death.
---
The special attack orb was a change meant for mobile use, but added to the live game so that mobile and pc aren't completely different. I don't see why it can't be added to pvp as well, but that's basically due to the current pvpers shooting down pvp content for the sake of "devaluing their skill".
---
This guy isn‚Äôt wrong. Remember the shit show that was the spell book filter? High profile pkers like boaty were a huge driving force in preventing any ‚Äúeasier‚Äù form of pking. 
---
Yet the pk community constantly complains about how they are dying off. It takes weeks to make an account and even longer to be competitive. 
---
You can‚Äôt gate keep and have an open door at the same time.

Fair enough. I retract my statements.

Hi
---
Saying Jagex should hire staff to refund Hardcore Status for everyone because Apex pays streamers to play the game isn't a very good argument. Just because other companies pay streamers 20K a month that doesn't mean that Jagex is willing to do the same. And paying for new staff to review 100s of accounts to refund status is not the same as paying an influencer to stream your game. Hardcores are popular on Twitch, but just because one Streamer loses their Hardcore it doesn't mean OSRS will never get X views or loses a ton of exposure; OSRS breaks 20K viewers a few time a year around events and big updates.
---
Nice cake but did you really have to jizz on it? He‚Äôs been through enough

Nex was a joke even before EoC, and people farm Telos and Vorago constantly with very little cost on materials.

I just deleted my ex off my friends list lol

Why, though? "when you want to store higher level scroll rewards". but the treasure chest already can store master rewards..? Not enough bank space for your incomplete sets? Get over it and sell some, you hoarder.

Well i guess you live under a rock and watch fox news lol

"I don't hate women I just want them the fuck out my game"

I just wanna know why a boot item that takes no/low req to wear cost 300x the amount of the item that makes it the best in slot for ranged, the most used combat style for high level pvm

What‚Äôs your setup for vork o: I‚Äôm using full void salve ammy blessed d hide boots archers ring and addy darts in my bp but my kills ave around 2:50, my range is 88 so does range level make that big of a difference?

does anyone do solo WT for 99 fm or is it significantly more efficient to do group?
---
you said it yourself, you lose your streak, losing a reroll for a clue is negligible, you're still getting the reward you otherwise would not have. Where as with slayer you are just you are just skipping a task you dont want to do, not can't. And if you can't do a task you build up your character so they can. 
---
because its a meme to get upset about politics
---
O
---
No sir, you are fucking stupid for too many reasons to list.
---
Your correct as a divide should exist.  A more competitive portion of the game shouldn't be handed easyscape updates.  Things that pvmers consider "qol" often change the level of play.  
---
I was just gonna call you fucking retarded for suggesting millions of gp being shit into the game but this guy did it nicely

konar said to kill trolls in keldagrim - isnt that the dwarf city? where are the trolls there?

the part that makes the **most** skill? yea.

Lol aslong as you‚Äôre doing damage who gives a shit. It‚Äôs a good place to test out different setups imo

Same.

No one pays attention to the calm, normal, boring people. They pay attention to the crazy guy running out screaming that the world is ending.

So lets leave it the same and watch peoples hard earned accounts go to waste because Jagex needs to make more money right?

Stupid opinion. 
---
I don‚Äôt even get it 
---
What's the fix that people want? The right click on mobile has a terrible delay for sure, but what other methods would suffice?
---
Banletics, where you see how many times you can get banned and recover the account. Can't do anything that results in permanent ban, only things that you can appeal.

This applies be cool if he was only using the GE to make money and never leaving and eventually getting a billion or something. 
---
Yeah it's the same thing with the minimap too or used too be. Not sure if it was fixed. Eitherway just don't click the part of the orb that overlaps onto the minimap. 
---
That logic right there is just as airtight as saying Woox, B0aty or Sparc Mac should be banned from the game bcause of the phising Strreams that appear in their name.
---
How can you write yikes to that its pretty funny
---
This man gets it. Pvp is for fun, whether you make money or not. I‚Äôm not into the whole claning thing though. But you won‚Äôt see me crying when I get killed by them like all of these guys!

It costs people 11 extra dollars for membership on their Hardcore. For Jagex to not make this a functioning game mode is criminal.

1/4 of the price because it will give pkers and non pkers incentive to skull on the person. And the protected items/ protect item spell would not be able to save the owner from losing profit. Making the ring drop itself might help, but I believe it will give the owner more incentive to keep recharging the ring rather then having to buy a ring and recharge it. 
---
Beep boop fun detected
---
No you‚Äôre just an entitled brat. Other games allow multiple characters because of classes and worlds/servers being locked to an account. Rs doesn‚Äôt have any of those limitations and as such has no need for multiple characters to an account 
---
and visafe
---
I did this method without archers ring and void from 98-99. I managed 65k/hr. Figured with bis it would be more. 
---
I would like to see Jagex copy Elder Scrolls online and just have their client support 3rd party plugins. They could screen them before supporting them so no OP shit can be put in
---
The best lube is the tears of Ironman though 
---
You know, I did some digging and found that +2 str bonus on 99 str equates to about 1 extra bonus damage...  A max hit of 36 isn't much more than 35, and if the extra defenses save you a trip to the bank, or even a couple pieces of food, then worth.
---
Play the game how you wanna play it, f' these nerds :p
---
Never claimed to be an expert. It's not hard to understand though. Of course we are talking in hypotheticals. It hasn't actually happened yet, but if it does happen there is the probability that my scenerio could happen. Any increase to the output of rangers will have the effect I outlined before. 
---
I don't think I'm wrong just because it hasn't happened. I'm not sure why you think we can't talk about ToC in the hypothetical. I mean the act of voting for this update is right now. We have to talk about consequences. It COULD produce a ToC situation if the poll passes.

I wish I had 9 Swordfish.
---
Maybe partially, but it probably will never look anything like the original source code. Human readable code has a lot of extra, unnecessary information that will normally be stripped out when compiled. The compiler is also smart enough to make its own optimizations to the code as it compiles, so the byte code isn't necessarily representative of exactly how the code was originally written. It would take a lot of effort to get any useful information out of it.
---
It would drastically reduce the amount of trolling, nothing will ever 100% stop it, but stopping 80% is better then stopping 0%.  Also, every other gamemode type has its own world, even darkscape had its own world, and yes ironmen chose to restrict themselves, but people bitch about ironmen not contributing to the economy, and taking resourcesz, and people harrass them, and people get mad ironmen can drop trade... so remove that issue altogether, moving ironmen to ironmen only worlds means ironmen only fight for resources among themselves, and if you restrict ironmen to ironmen worlds then they cant drop trade to alts, thereby forcing ironmen to either give something up entirely or keep it and find a use for it.  As for wilderness and ironmen, yeah someones going to still PK just because they can, and even if they dont there are ways to ensure the wilderness isnt abused, every boss in the wilderness can be safespotted or its damage protected agasint, so PKers are the only threat, SO have a revenent type that is extremely aggressive, attacks players on sight, has HUGE aggro range, hits through protection prayers and can teleblock players, and drops nothing.  It becomes a stand in for PKers, its poses a threat to ironmen in the wilderness, but unlike PKers they wont be dicks JUST BECAUSE.
---
What about HCIM vs regular? Those are limitations between characters that involves multiple accounts. Im saying a membership should include a main and a Ironman. Thats not being entitled. 
---
I can get down with that. Thought it was a no-bake cake and I got excited as I've only ever seen cookies.
---
This isn't common, but it happens. I fucking hate the people who, if they haven't experienced something themselves, can't believe this type of stuff happens. My buddy triggered a false positive in the bot detection system as well. He couldn't appeal, posted to social media for help and was promptly flamed by a good percentage of the people basically saying there's no way there could be a false positive on the bot detection system, that bc it was triggered, he botted, and deserves the ban. Ignorance is bliss man, all I can say is ignore the comments.

Obviously they don't need a special occasion to start a career, it's not about a "special occasion," it's about having a discussion. It's not women's "fault" that the industry is male dominated, and no one is raising pitchforks saying "Get the men out!" They're just having a discussion about their experiences as women in the industry, which would reasonably be than the experiences of men in the same industry, and what they may or may not have dealt with.
---
Legit, this in no way, shape, or form harms anyone or causes any issues besides people whining because something is being done that doesn't include them, in order to promote diversity or open avenues of understanding, lmao. It's a bunch of "buh wuh about me" children.

Lol just wait! It‚Äôs a gamble. But keys can get you as much as 500k or so. Dragon dart tips and magic tree seeds are where it‚Äôs at!
---
Difference is clue hunters, black chinchomper hunters, and people just trying to get mage arena 1 &amp; 2 done aren't shit pkers, they're literally just a dps test that moves.
---
Then make an ironman and play f2p on it or make your main f2p and play your iron. It is entitled because yet again rs offers f2p which a vast majority of mmos dont.
---
This basically never actually happens. Either you were doing something sketchy that triggered the ban that likely would be against the rules anyways, or someone hacked you and botted on your account which triggered the ban. The bot detection software isn't flawless, but I'd say 9.99 times out of 10 OP is just a scumbag wasting developer's time.
---
Good to see this. I was beginning to think an hour would go by without it.
---
Honestly, most pvp specs are used with item switches anyways. there is no way in hell moving your mouse up to click a little orb is faster than pressing an f key and clicking where your mouse is probably already positioned anyways.
---
I agree that it is stupid to not change for pvp sake simply for the fact that it would be counter productive to most pkers anyways.
---
Qol changes should be game wind, not just pvp/pvm separately. This is why the community is splitting. 
---
It's free and it's very nice
---
I think a lot of what they call the engine is the client, and runelite only affects the client. Also, runelite can obviously not edit things that affects the gameplay like group ironman or authenticator delay.
---
Take her to Varrock bar and watch him be left behind the gate to Morytania
---
The problem with runescape from an execution standpoint is that there isn't a lot of design space to work with. This is literally why they made eoc- they thought that by broadening their design space they could make the execution of the game more engaging and interesting. If we don't want eoc (and we don't) then we're stuck operating within the very limited framework the game has. 
---
The simple truth is that making the game fundamentally harder cannot really be done. The slider from easy to hard only goes one direction- easier. Once things get easier there literally isn't a way to make them harder again. 
---
&gt;Convenience is not the same as easy, it's more like removing annoyances that shouldn't have been there in the first place.
---
In this game, it really is. That's the design space we're working with. If it took clicking through 12 separate interfaces in 1 tick to spec, wouldn't you say that would be bother harder and less convenient? It would be a convenience to remove such an interface. At the same time, it would remove the skill required to navigate that interface and make it easier in a way which can never be undone. 
---
This example is ofc absurdly extreme, but the concept remains. Calling it an inconvenience is just an attempt to trivialize what it really is- making the game easier. 
---
What account?
---
come back to me when you have infernal cape, can do inferno's without banking, numerous tob+ raids 1 solo's doing 4:1 olm, can do 6 jads, 6 jads with 1 pray point...etc etc. 
---
literally irrelevant statement until then lol
---
Yea im gonna do that. Again as stated I was curious what other peoples thoughts were on paying for an Iron man and non Ironman. Clearly im retarded. 
---
So you're admitting that they're forcing their ideology on people?
---
If they had designed the game from the beginning with the idea in mind that they wouldn't split features it could work, but I doubt the community is keen for a complete combat overhaul.
---
Anyway, the meta for PVM and PVP is very different now and the player base on both sides are pretty much happy with how their respective discipline works. Personally I think it's ridiculous to deny one side something that would be a quality change because, if applied equally, would be game breaking for the other side. 
---
Splitting features may seem clunky and unintuitive from the outside looking in and for newer players but it clearly hasn't been much of a hinderance for the ever growing community and it means each side can be effectively updated without compromising the other.
---
Sorry I didn't realise there wasn't a stream playing on the majority of my screen

I remember one time I had just started an account and had gotten maybe 3 or so hours into the account. Was trying to do a f2p to main type of playthrough so I was training on cows when all the sudden I disconnected and when I tried to log back on it said my account had been locked. I looked it up on the runescape website and it said I was permanently banned for macroing. It wasn't too big of a deal to me since I was only 3 hours into that account but now every time I DC I get worried a bit that it'll happen again somehow.
---
It‚Äôs a video game, who cares
---
If you didn't make the account then it will never really be "yours" as the creator can recover it at will at any given point.
---
I have my own at home for use with 800 number. 
---
There are sites that facilitate this, but as other users have pointed it out is both against the rules and also not totally safe for you.  Not to mention that the accounts typically come with a hefty price.   There is a non-zero chance that you pay between $20 and up to several hundred dollars for the perfect account for you and then a week later the account is taken back.  At which point, your options are to start a fresh account legitimately or to buy again and take the risk.  You'll be better off just doing it legit.

The death of kira

I wouldn't say unchanged really, there are quests I am familiar with but most of the content is very new to me and I'm sure that I could play as I did when i left but that wouldn'tstrike me as effective.
---
 You have to account that I left shortly after RS2 was released, the very beginning of 2004. 
---
Questing is something I am looking into right now, trying to build a "path" to play the game through. That way I can make small goals and work my way through the content. 
---
I found the optimal order list, informative for sure so thank you :) 
---
Membership also used to be 5$ when it came out üòî
---
I know exactly whats your ign
---
well clicking the indicator orb doesn't do anything anyways, so not sure why you would.
---
Never trust a fat chef, they ate all the good bits already.
---
Let him answer 
---
It seems it had a some type of ring model which has been recolored into red and the eye part seems to be cut of ''Dinh's Bulwark'' and pasted on top of the recolored ring. But the eye part has been also recolored. Simple but genius.
---
Totally random, but you can search Konar on google and her wiki page has a full list of every drop you can get from the chest.
---
Ok, so my account is not doomed lol? Ty for answer.
---
I mean, RIP your rng, but you could make the lvl 1 chairs for more xp/hr js.
---
go into the viewer and move every room down and left by one square. this should resolve your issue. 
---
Time to emigrate 
---
If this was a second way to imbue then I‚Äôm down. Highly doubt pvmers would like the idea of locking imbues behind pvp. Could also use more rewards. I would love seeing emote rewards like orange justice dance
---
I think it would be PKers who vote no, because it would devalue their impressive 6 way swap into AGS against spade-wielding clue hunters
---
#YEW GET SOME MAGIC LOGS
---
Imagine being this retarded
---
I‚Äôm assuming a lot of these are underground? Cause I feel like some of them don‚Äôt make sense with where they‚Äôre at on the surface level
---
nice. so does literally 1000s of people every day lol.
---
There it is.
---
Restricting yourself.
---
So I view the game in terms of whole updates, not of who gets it. If it makes a certain group happy (ironman, mains, etc) why not vote yeah to it?
---
I do not selectively vote on this based of restricting ones self or not, pures are a demographic and player audiences and I think jagex attempts to recognize that much more than the majority of players do.
---
It is baffling pvpers get blamed for stuff failing with when we are such a small portion of the audience for jagex; but one that is hated by pvmers.
---
did you train your def or get all the xp from questing? if you trained the def then no, if you quested it, you can salvage your build into a void pker
---
Do you have any rooms in the dungeon?
---
Still the same concept, despite my over exaggeration. Some tasks you get 1 clue, go do the clue 5 kills later, new clue. Sometimes you do it, others it sits in the bank for a week. I think the RNG factor of clue drops would crash a lot of clue items and impact the economy too much. Being able to get 5 clues is a bad idea.  
---
They could make mage spells stat reduction stack like bgs and dwh.
---
Upgrade it with 200 void points to give it a +15% damage boost? Sure why not.
---
omg i love the werewolf course for that. i get my best rates there cus im actually super focused on those stepping stones and hurdles lol
---
That's... kind of intriguing I cant lie. Didnt even know I wanted this.
---
Thanks I needed this motivation

Take the bracelet AND her bank.

The team have been considering adding the tick combat calculator for some time now, but before we can proceed we need you to upload a video of you doing 100 push-ups with perfect form.

Jagex hosts a wildlife conservation event that's pretty on the nose about its message and states that humans are a cause for these issues: Nobody complains.
---
Jagex hosts a temporary pride event that's only explicit about its message in an announcement for the event and not ingame. Everyone riots

Easiest solution would just make it take 10k max and let you \*pick\* which coin model to use. Coin models are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 25, 100, 250, 1k, and 10k.
---
im replying to an NPC talking about bernie sanders right now tho
---
&gt; Clicking that small orb is as hard as clicking a fkey and then a huge bar.
---
I don't agree with your opinion here. 
---
For one thing, the orb is always stationary and visible on screen. You can have it available and food/magic/whatever on screen at the same exact time. 
---
As it stand now, to spec, you have to switch tabs quickly and move your mouse to a bar that isn't visible on screen till you switch. You can't have inventory or magic tabs open at the same time. 
---
It does make it easier. 
---
Bruh I'm a car enthusiast who scapes. Got 5 cars ATM xd

Who shit in your corn flakes?

Not really. Some little pure doing hour long raids will barely dent the raid market.

People who plays it legit
---
I would know, I use to get banned for constantly for botting 
---
everybody finishes clues in the end, stacking devalues and plugins save a couple minutes
---
Genuinely 
---
Support, 100%
---
iirc its also a tic slower, not to mention you couldnt preload the spec with it for rushing.
---
Nah sorry, I meant you'll probably need to make a new account with those stats, having 40 defence means you're missing out on potentially 40 offensive stats.
---
No one is going to fight you if you wear armour so you're not getting any benefit at all by being 40 def. All it means is the people you fight might be like 40 atk 70 str, whereas you're only 40 str so they'll have 10 or so max hits on you
---
"gays can exist, just not in a way where i have to acknowledge their existence"
---
What if the user sells the ring? Will the item be stored on their account much like Ring of Forging, where the variable is local to the player? Or should it be like \*\*Ring of Mimicry (Twisted Bow)\*\*?
---
Actually had this happen. My fiancee and I started ironmen together about a year into our relationship, and after 5 years left. Can't help but think of the bitch everytime I play it
---
Hmmmmmmm
---
For the amount you would pay, you could literally buy hundreds of bonds to redeem for legitimate in-game currency and get more value out of than buying the equivalent of an overpriced used condom.

Can it dweeb

Look up we do raids discord
---
Quote people verbatim. 
---
I feel like updates should be all or nothing. It should apply everywhere or not at all. Polling things to only work in certain areas feel like it divides the communities even more. 
---
It also makes me feel like Jagex is well aware that most things wont pass for pvp so they are doing this just so content can pass.
---
I dont like the precedent it sets and hope that we dont see more updates like this in the future.
---
Btw most pkers realize this update wouldnt help pking so please dont respond saying pkers did/would vote no because it would make pking easier. It's actually way worse to use that as a spec than your fkeys.

Why the fuck does this shitty post have 1500 upvotes? Am I missing something?

In 2006 there was a major influx of players, where everyone would always go to world 2 to trade. Because of this huge influx in player base, world 6, then 9 (members worlds) became members worlds. My home world was always world 6 because I mained world 7 as f2p. Many of us got kicked out of world 6, it was always capped at 2k players. So we moved to 9. Then again, always capped. Some home worlders had the same idea, but after world 9 became that way I just chose world 69 to avoid the issue again. Shout out to quiksilver30, ajturtle, wingers, whoever else was home world 6 who I've lost contact with. 
---
Atta boy
---
He can beg all he wants but no one can trade with him anyway...
---
If you vote no to an idea because it affects PvP in a way you dislike even if it's good for the overall game, that is literally spite voting.
---
You can't vote based on only how it will affect PvP and also say "it's bad design to allow things in certain areas but not others", either you vote yes because it's good for the majority of the game or you live with having different features in and out of PvP. You can't have it both ways.
---
Well....its stupid how pvp work in this game. 
---
raiding on a 1 def, low def, or generally low combat account is still significantly harder than just doing raids normally, you can't have 1 account tank everything because most mobs in raids switch their targets
---
also these kinds of players make up a fairly small minority compared to normal maxed/near maxed combat pvmers, and some of the increased number of drops will be balanced out by increased demand for the drops from people who can now use them for raids
---
it might have a very small effect on the prices, but compared to a lot of other updates its negligible 
---
agility would be the only reasonable thing you just said except you can boost from 75 lol
---
Pay no mind to the downvotes‚Äîyou‚Äôre spot on, mate. 
---
You uhh, you should read what he said again.
---
When do you re pot range and why 
---
1) I'm a software developer, I work with UI.  I have degrees in both computer science and "arts and technology"  while I don't specialize in UI design, I'm very familiar.  Also if it matters I lived with a game designer that worked at Gearbox for years, he was there for both borderlands 1 and 2, we talked regularly about game design as we'd bounce random ideas off each other.
---
2) In UI design consistency and the UI behaving as expected is key.  Sure if you want the UI to be different in isolated situations then the UI should change, leaving a button there in both scenarios but having it work in one but not the other is bad design.  Get yourself a book on design, I recommend "Design of Everyday Things" by  Donald A. Norman.
---
3) It's not a button until you make it clickable, otherwise it was just a notification badge or whatever you want to call it.  If they want isolated behavior the "button" should not look like a button in PVP areas.
---
4) You're right my comment offered nothing towards the discussion aside from supporting the post, but when the comment was made there was I think 2-3 comments on this post, there wasn't a discussion yet.
---
you know who would love it if their identity wasnt being politicized? the gays themselves
---
too bad we happen to have a political party who has historically made "exterminate the gays" part of its political platform, so not having their identity politicized isn't really an option for them
---
Well, they could always make it a whitelist of a few items at first. Eg: Tbow, claws, arma cbow, etc. Just ~10 for starters until they figure out a more efficient way to cloak a player as an item model already in the game's assets. That way they can just reference a model ID instead of manually make a whole new NPC hack for each transfiguration.
---
I respect how straightforward this response is
---
No, I don't have a dungeon but I did what OSRuneScaper suggested  and it worked
---
Meh Ill just stay and make the best of it, ty for answer.
---
Y Jagex no celebrate it tho
---
They would have to make tome of fire work with it to compete with trident tbh
---
Make the ghost look like Faith from Mirror's Edge, that'll motivate everyone who ever did time trials.
---
Sweet, it worked. Thanks!
---
I really think this one would have a large negative impact on pking skill actually, I'm not even a pker and there's no way I'd support that just based on watching videos and streams and such.  Speccing is hugely important in pking, maybe even the single largest expression of skill.  Either that or prayer switching, but I don't think so because prayer switching is only relevant to bridding, while speccing is universal.  
---
What‚Äôs wrong with females?
---
False because? Public opinion of osrs is ‚Äúthat children game‚Äù because it was popular when we were young. I waz 8 when i played this game.
---
Ignorance is lifted by actually saying your opinion, but most people play it defensively because everything you say can be used against you.
---
In the market, both mobas are somewhat equally old but league is 10 times as big. Do you think this is because they know nothing about dota2 or because dota2 is highly inferior?

Either that or the pic was taken just after the update and people haven‚Äôt yet gotten on, but alright

No

---
i wonder why there are so few women in the field
---
could it be for reasons owing to social conditioning of which there is a large supporting body of evidence from numerous studies done over the course of decades
---
or is it based on some loose hypothetical evidence-free evolutionary psychology guesswork that says women are just not biologically engineered to code because in nature it was men who did all the hunting and fighting and computer programming in the wild
---
probably the latter, that's what my gut tells me at least
---
I'd rather just not change the color of the scroll. I dont see what the big deal is with right clicking and reading the tier.
---
The main use for defence levels at a low level is upgrading your armour. In general it will make let you get hit less often. Armours follow the same progression as weapons. 1 is bronze and Iron. 5 is steel. 10 is black. 20 is Mithril, etc.
---
It's been a long time since I was f2p low level but I think Al Kharid guards were a good stepping stone to hill giants, though i'm sure they are really packed.
---
what is the aceuus spellbook if not necromancy?
---
Not in the *voting* majority
---
pretty sure this is only true if you play alts.
---
This is awesome

This is an apples and oranges comparison.

I‚Äôve probably seen 20+ cya virgins threads and not one was close comical

---
Maybe to make fletching more useful? 
---
And i would have that game knowledge and skill by now. You either are rank 1 or you aren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre still going to be the same % in the ranking. It‚Äôs logical. 
---
Rat IRL was doing a series of low elo accounts, his highest record the past month was 97 wins in a row. While others are stuck having 50% winrate. This implies that skill is part of the game. The added amount of players to play against means that it‚Äôs more difficult to be high elo. 
---
It‚Äôs like a platinum KR player playing on turkish server to reach diamond because there just are far less players there.
---
Maybe, but Jagex hosted 2 wildlife conservation events and nobody complained then. The event was really on the nose about its message as well.
---
What language do you write where it's acceptable to assign a variable inside the parameters of a function declaration?
---
1b is about what 99 costs if you pay runners.
---
Don't hate them but they need to realize that content should not cater to someone who has restricted themselves made their own way to play.
---
Such a as new quests should have lv req and there is nothing wrong with it
---
Animation smoothing is absolutely awful lol many animations look super unnatural plus it makes it more difficult to go by animations for things like prayer flicking. Ofc everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but i feel like you are hyping it up to this dude an insane amount when many players don't like it and there's a decent chance he won't either.
---
You should do quests, definitely look into the waterfall quest for a quick boost to attack and strength
---
&gt;What's the deal with Def Lvl?
---
Wacha mean? Defence increases the chance that enemies hit less on you, and lets you wear better armor at different stages (40 for rune, 70 for barrows, etc)
---
Most are on sharkbew or are in discords.  A lot of the "pures" I've seen on reddit are people getting into for the first time and looking for direction on account building. Still you don't know if they are a pure only. Most people who have pures also have mains, zerkers, or piety built accounts.

Never mind sued individuals can't even be tracked... and you can sue the companies but will lose as their Gov supports it.

you can make the same argument about the F keys removing skill by taking precise mouse movements and turning them into button presses
---
yes, improve it, because more people of either gender interested in the field means improvement in the field, the fact that there are so few women means there's potentially a much greater pool of bright and capable young women who could be future software/game devs if they viewed it as a viable career path
---
It isn't happening **in RuneScape**, it's a handful of individuals from the team taking a portion of time out for community interaction.
---
By that logic, any time a JMod comments on a reddit post, or a forum post, that "they could be working on updates for the game." A few hours of an AMA isn't going to delay an update by a week. Do you think the work schedule isn't made with this event in mind? Lmao.

It's not like he could kill more than 10 giants a trip

if ur not following zezimeme on insta youre missing out big time, follo him
---
Well, not all crafted items are dropped by monsters, to begin with. Perhaps some could see Leather Shields added but they are a much more involved thing than just normal leathers. Somethings will probably drop them in the future, but I don't see a big reason to go through the drop tables and add new drops every time we get new items; it is fine to leave some things unique to Skilling.
---
It really do be like that, my bwana.

Was fun to have this back when OldSchool launched but got old quick.

This would be very funny with vengeance. A Moving Tbow will be a real thing.

Don't forget that the WWF events were far more on the nose than the pride event.

Great idea! F2p gets no updates. It's time to fix some things in f2p. So many problems with skills and combat.

Because men crying "boo-hoo what about me" solves nothing when 90% of everything is about men, lmao. Not everything has to include us when it comes to including those less represented.

Yeah easy man cheers. Well Australian F2P worlds are pretty quiet particularity at night. However I wouldn't know what kind of population loiters around Al Kharid or Hill Giants. I'll give then a gander. Thanks!  
---
They would have to program a different time for every single item you can use on it, like blowpipe mutagen problem.
---
I love this idea but don't see it happening
---
I identify as a nolife nerd already and I‚Äôm at 339 days gameplay. A year gameplay to vote would be a tad too high. However I do think voting reqs should be way higher, maybe 1500 total or 50 days gameplay.

Hm you reckon it would cost?
---
Noone, I just think people should keep their achievements to themselves instead of using reddit like a blog.
---
You're actually past halfway. Level 50 is 92% of level 99

I'm talking about paying to win, not membership here.

I've done a handful of quests. I'll keep chipping away at it.

Look at you people not using a brine sabre

I use monkfish and don‚Äôt eat most games

I wonder who is killing those people. Surely it's the "homophobes" and not the people who execute them in the name of their religion.
---
start an account, get to base 50 stats and tell him you're already halfway to beating the game. 
---
Not bad.
---
Yeah, but the idea is you read the title, then see the image and wonder what the guy got, so you click the video, thus clickbait. How do you not get this?
---
i wouldnt call it toxic
---
On buying or selling or both? I could see a tax destroying flipping on low margin flips. 
---
pretty sure i just held alt and clicked and dragged it. but im not at the computer now so im not 100% sure. Its a runelite feature
---
They should, but not compete with other. For examples, Raids didn't give a set of melee armor that outclasses bandos or armadyl. 
---
He‚Äôs at the spot where the bow appeared, hoping the next system update will ‚Äúrelease him from poverty‚Äù 
---
I could be wrong but doubt their government will support any company that is hard to track since any tax paying company shouldn't be hard to track.
---
And world of Warcraft sued a Chinese gold selling company I just don't know how it ended
---
You're supposed to used ruby but calculating the dps of ruby bolts is difficult. So I just used diamond as a base instead. A bgs hit is only slightly worse than a diamond bolt hit with the added bonus of lowering defence was the point I was trying to make.
---
Till 94 a lot think 30-40 milish 
---
It's what the people want
---
&gt;Does it technically make the game easier because it reduces clicks required by a single click? Yes. Does it actually matter? No.
---
&gt;Does increasing the size of the icons by a pixil or two technically reduce the skill required? Yes. Does it matter? No
---
You insist that it doesn't matter but I think it does. I think it matters because runescape has very few avenues for implementing executional difficulty and navigating interfaces is a big one. Unless your argument is that runescape should just become chess where execution is nonexistent and you only play by thinking, you surely agree that there should be some element of challenge in execution to make the game fun, right? What *specifically* do you think is an acceptable avenue of executional challenge? Is 1 tick flicking the only real challenge that matters? Is luring monsters to a safespot the only real challenge that matters? Why can't navigating interfaces be a challenge that matters? It certainly has for *the *the entirety of the existence of runescape*. 
---
&gt;You're focused on the wrong things.
---
I am focused on a different thing currently but I am entitled to an opinion on what is important, as are you. 
---
&gt;Now for example, an ezscape addition that I voted no to and also passed is: "Should shields and potions offering an anti-dragonfire effect offer protection from the Drakes' special attack?"
---
&gt; This is the kind of thing that you should be worried about
---
I voted no to both of these things. I think making gameplay mechanics easier is often, but not always bad. I think making execution easier is straight up always bad (or at least to date, I haven't seen a simplification of execution I thought was a good idea). 
---
Well its you thats lying to yourself so üòÇ
---
It is worth using 1 BGS spec in exchange for missing 1 DHCB hit.
---
Gotcha. Was just curious cause I was doing some last night. Thought I was doing it wrong
---
Not having your UI behave as similarly as possible in all situations is a huge game design sin, which I'm sure Jagex is aware of.  They probably hate making these changes.  
---
But to be fair, pking is pretty delicate.  There are already precious few outlets for skill expression, because at the end of the day runescape is just a very very simple game.  That's why the spell icon thing, while pretty damn dumb on the face of it, is still kind of a defensible objection by them; it is a pretty small thing, but losing any little piece of the skill can be considered a somewhat significant hit when there are precious few avenues to begin with.  Imagine if that went through, and then this?  That'd be a pretty sizeable erosion of skill in just a couple months.
---
Sont know for Sure tho
---
**When you play a rollback version of an online RPG game created 18 years ago** 
---
Plugins cheat your way in-game for a benefit that shouldn't be there in the first place. The hypocrisy is real when people are talking about ezscape
---
Isn't this just a worse duel arena? I'm not pvper but I'm not seeing much difference here besides it levels you and you don't need gear.
---
This guy posts 5+ comments on every post about stuff like this blaming pvp players for ruining the game, sabotaging polls, and holding back the game by voting against "qol" changes, many of which are not qol. He has some anti-pker agenda of his own so it's honestly not even worth trying to reason with him.

It depends what you mean dislike. What if its actually bad or harmful to pvp? I never said I voted no to any of these updates and you arguing as if I did. 
---
This doesnt negatively affect pvp in anyway. I dont think it's an update that's needed but I don't think its harmful to any aspect of the game. The fact that its divided to work in certain areas and not other is where I have an issue.

I dont see a world where gimping yourself + adding delay on spec makes you a better pvper. If anything PvPers should love this poll for wildy because itd bring noobs and easy loot for them... if they cant even fkey a spec bar how do you think they are prayer switching / bridding?

Certainly frowned on. And if you buy account it will never be safe. So you might waste hours just to have it hacked back. Plus the other commenter is right.

not worried lol. dont rly care, was just curious. thanks for the feedback :)

If you looked through my post history you would know i also play Albion Online, which is a full loot open world PvP game in a similar style to RuneScape. I have no problem with PvP or even people who enjoy PvP. I enjoy it in other games like AO because it requires significant skill and frankly it's fun to watch the autists cry when you kill them and take their stuff.
---
OSRS PvP is literally a load of horseshit: the PvPers get a boner over "menu navigation" and "click precision" and other nonsensical bullshit that a fucking monkey could figure out, and ultimately it comes down to who has more people or better gear. It's bad, very bad, and yet the PvPers in OSRS vote no on anything that would make it better, and often go the extra mile to vote no on any poll that would make other parts of the game better too.
---
I have a problem with the PvP community here, because they go out of their way to prevent improvements to the game in order to preserve their low skill ceiling of "menu navigation" and "click precision".
---
So basically people wanting to make the game more easyscape?
---
This community is pathetic 
---
Not at all, don't need the 50k
---
But seemed like the clan sure hepl did hahahahaha
---
Maybe that wasn't the point. Or it was the point but they changed their mind and wanted to poll something else.
---
This is why we poll things because ideology changes over time. We commit to a certain aspect then realize, well maybe this is better. So then they poll it. No harm no foul, if you don't like the update vote no in the poll. That's all you can do. Getting upset that they even polled it is counter intuitive, how else are they supposed to engage with the community about these things if we don't want to be asked the wrong question. They don't know what the wrong question may or may not be so they have to poll it and see how it goes.
---
So in this case it is very possible it is your assumption that clue scrolls are supposed to work that way. Maybe the rest of the community disagrees, this is why we vote. Maybe it was how they used to think clue scrolls worked but after enough data they realized that 85% of all clue scrolls are left on the ground so they want people to participate in clue hunting more. So they figure they revitalize the system just a bit as well as make it so that clue scrolls are more fluid and less game breaking. By game breaking I mean you have to completely switch focus to do clue's at the moment.
---
It does 100% suck to have to hit bank all items and inventory then regear, pull your clue back out, go do it, get 88k for an elite after 8 steps, then go back to your task 30 minutes later after wasting your time. All this is is a system to see if maybe it's better for gameplay if you can stock one or two up, complete the task, then go do the clues.
---
Having a discussion and asking if this is a change we want is quintessential OSRS and it boggles my mind that people get mad things are even polled when its like "brother this is why polls exist, you could be playing a different game where they just add things no polls or integrity issue necessary".

I unsubscribed from the hearthstone subreddit after they added a tank top to jaina and everyone lost their minds, I really hope I don't have to do the same here

who r u :o

im not gay, can I add you guys too? :D
---
define quickly? if i can get 40att 70str 70 range in under 50ish hours, i would probably do it but more than that i just cant justify wasting all the time you know?
---
You wouldn't have posted if you voted yes fam.
---
Sounding very rs3-esk. Watch yourself, sir.
---
If it happened over two and a half years ago, why are you just now bringing it up? 
---
Huh. This didn't used to be the case did it?
---
They should do it how chrome Remote Desktop handles right clicks, two finger tap is a right click, may be hard on small screens but the delay is horrid
---
Probably not. But I thought it was worth a shot to try and talk about it.
---
I think they should just leave as is 
---
I seriously doubt it, and the fact that you believe he did just shows you really can't imagine a world where people are mature enough not to give a fuck about losing 50k. And you look like someone who rages about stuff like that and is in denial that there are people out there that aren't complete troglodytes :)
---
Only if you get to top page of reddit I'm afraid
---
Why are you gay
---
Based and upvoted.

Then don't attack a fire giant who doesn't have full hp.

Cringe and downvoted.

nowhere near the level of clue rewards 
---
Exactly, the skill ceiling stays high but the barrier to entry is lowered
---
Thats pretty cool my dude.
---
Imagine writing a 3 scolding paragraph essay to a stranger on the internet while simultaneously claiming that the game is *my life* lmfao irony levels off the charts üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Shitposting on here seems to be the way to go then. 
---
And by the way, make sure when they come back and tell you, "We have proof this was you stop bullshitting," make sure you post that on here as well. 
---
They're ok if you're low thieving level but at 91+, Pyramid Plunder is better and so are Tzhaars if you have the level for them.
---
Read the post man. Each subsequent clue has a rarer chance of dropping, like ecumenical keys. There is still incentive to leave and do the clues as you get them. They're also releasing new items that you can get from clue scrolls which dilutes the potential reward pool. The amount of extra clues being done will be marginal and the only items that might lower slightly in value are God pages, but even then they have a decent sink anyway so they won't decrease by much. This update doesn't change things as drastically as people seem to think 
---
that's exactly what it is, women's fault they don't work in the industry, are you telling me that men don't allow them? If so, that's the dumbest thing ever, the reason why there aren't so many women is because they choose to do more family/social oriented work.
---
you get a pass. Calc 2 was a bitch.
---
I'd love to understand your point of view better. What do you think? 
---
I just recently came back to RS
---
It requires doing a few quests to use effectively but i could see 50ish hours. Plus its almost entirely afk. I never did a lot of NMZ so I cant offer too much insight. There are dozens of guides on YouTube that could better inform you.
---
I definitely do obviously understand the limitations pures have. I am discussing the spite votes and denial of content by the pvmers against pures/pvpers. 
---
Listen, it sounds like you have your mind pretty set so I‚Äôll leave you to it.
---
Like I said, I vote for the community as a whole, I do not harshly over punish or spite vote ironmen or mains for content or a way i do not wish to play. I do not vote to bone a certain demographics of players nor deny them of new things coming into the game that they could enjoy too.
---
What are some of these catered content? We got rev caves a year ago? How are you really saying out of ‚Äúgame integrity?‚Äù Like what for instance? 
---
Do you have any for sale? I‚Äôd love a slayer based pin. 
---
It's funny that as the community as a whole has aged and matured, the community as a whole has devolved into a cesspool of shit and entitlement.

Great, I never said it was right or that it needed to be respected. I simply said supporting lgbt can be controversial to certain communities.
---
I know its not the wildest drop but Im a new player. Had nobody else to share this with so thought some of yous might think it was cool!
---
You can quest 40 attack in around an hour tops, then just make your way over to sand crabs and you should be able to afk 70 strength and range in around 50 hours, maybe a tad bit over 50.
---
Yes. Obviously youre lucky.
---
If they'd look at it they'd see it wasn't me on the account at the time.... Sadly they ignore me on twitter and instantly deny any appeals I send them

---
You cant do quests together but you can fight non quest bosses together. Ex. You can both go fight dagannoth kings(non quest boss) together but you cant fight the dagannoth mother(quest boss) together.
---
You guys can do quests together by just doing it at the same time but there will be parts where you have to do stuff separately. 
---
cool. thanks man. i might just go for it. its been so many years and im craving some PKing :P
---
They have addressed it the last two Q&amp;A sessions. Unfortunately they have other updates they are working on including notifications to your phone.(GE notifications, I assume how health notifications, ect.) So the question asked to the stream has been "can we get a ... bubble toggle that you click instead of a whole chat bar?". 
---
Mod Ash at the very least that seems fine, ModMadK may have also agreed.
---
If you don't watch the Q&amp;A every week you can't say they don't address things, they usually do.

---
It‚Äôs insane.
---
It is like unless I am a slayscaper main I don‚Äôt deserve updates because I ‚Äúlimited myself‚Äù 
---
It is basically rhetorical at this point, and the pvmers and those who use the argument seek to only have content specifically for themselves which really isn‚Äôt in the spirit of goodwill in the slightest.
---
I digress.
---
Serious question; Whats the advantage of playing more than one account at once? Like I understand its more efficient, but right now I just play my main and enjoy getting money and levels for it, If I skilled on another account, how would it benefit my main? 
---
I think she was governor of Alaska for a while.
---
That is a very obtainable goal, and I'm almost positive it wouldn't take 50 hours. Waterfall quest gets you 30 attack and strength. 
---
I agree, problem is that resource gathering is a very bottable activity so my guess is that they wanted to combat botting by providing easier means of getting these items through monsters. 
---
Also another problem is that, OSRS doesn't have a diverse set of armor and gear upgrades, thus to make kills valuable they either have to do it through resources or alchables. If you make it only alchables, it'd get boring after a while to keep receiving battlestaves and mystic armor all the time. 
---
But thats the entire point. It's opportunity cost. The cost of maximizing attainable clues is doing them right after you get them. That's the drawback, either stop what you're doing to maybe get another or don't.
---
You can't always have best of both worlds, not everything in this game needs to be convenient. Go back to rs3 if that's what you want. 
---
I like that you have nothing to say when someone actually calls you out. You have a nice day too

Dude.. pvpers still have to pvm and skill. Almost every PVPer has a main. You only disadvantage yourself by having one account. So no, new players aren't ruining their account. They're making an income acc (a main).
---
Try asking Mod Ash on twitter, he is the entire support department.
---

---
Can't be just that - the crash is fairly sudden. 
---
It's just layers of ignorance. Lmao. 
---
I did that earlier yes, now it works! 
---
Not in PvP though, and not in any PvP minigames.
---
Because it still limits the amount of clues out at once. Take RS3 for instance, prior to the update, some of the lower tier dyes were 500m-1.2b. After the stackable update with everyone no longer having to instantly drop what they're doing to do a clue, they'd stack 25, do them all at once. Dyes were literally coming into the game every 5 minutes, now the same 500m-1.2b dyes are 120m and 650m because even though they're one time use, theres so many in circulation it devalued them permanently. 
---
Most treasure trail items are cosmetic and don't have an actual use which sucks already. Most opinions I gathered from my time in RS3 was nobody wanted to pause what they were doing to do a clue scroll so it'd just sit in their bank forever. With stackables, you could get 25 at a time and once you hit that 25 limit, binge them, open the caskets, rinse, repeat. 
---
TLDR; look at rare RS3 clue rewards before/after update. More people doing clues = more items in circulation = items lose value. Same will happen to osrs. 
---
Gz!
---
Does anyone know how much the Mysterious emblem drop rates were increased by today? Many thanks.

Yeah that's the correct term thanks. Sorry I get my incel lingo confused, I try to distance myself from their wacko shit as much as possible but it still leaks through sometimes. 
---
It‚Äôs a good type of gold sink. It isn‚Äôt necessary or intrusive, but there‚Äôs many people, like myself, who will always pay for convenience. I know I‚Äôll never spend 1M using the Brimhaven dungeon, but I‚Äôll gladly pay for the convenience of never needing to bring gold there again. 
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind more goldsinks like this one. I like the one time payments that make something that‚Äôs mildly inconvenient, slightly more convenient. 
---
This gold sink is also more for higher level players who can make that 1mil back in an hour. 
---
You have a cute accent
---
Boi you smell like toes
---
Failing it 3 times in a row is just purely bad luck. 
---
Make sure you're wearing weight reducing clothes if you have them. 
---
And the marks of grace are slow go get regardless of failures. Just don't give up. 
---
Piggy backing your point. Someone could easily program a clue box solver. All you need is an algorithm to solve boxes and a way to figure out where which tile is supposed to go. Thats easily done manually so the client is fair. 
---
I do doubt that most people would be able to buy that many though. But yeah, I kinda agree that imps basically is stacking medium clues. But sloth-says-what did make some pretty good points on this thread :)
---
Literally calling someone upset but keeps coming back to the thread to insult lol
---
No problem, thanks for being willing to understand my view!  The argument got ironed out after hours of me trying to frustratingly explain it, so I appreciate you also specifying which points confused you!
---
Holy shit the number of people recommending rwting instead of buying gold the way that won't get your account banned is insane.
---
No I think as long as they‚Äôre over 115 they have the same point potential you just have less (marginally) stats than a maxed cb account
---
Have you seen how hard the RS3 TT rewards tanked after the update? Barrows dyes are around a 1/8000 chance and would be worth like 12m OSRS.  
---
Someone mentioned in another post the GE tracker might be having issues, there might be a bug effecting how the GE works after the history update?
---
I got an A in accalerated calc 2 the same semester I got my fire cape

Same, died to iron dragons because of it. Ran out of one area and into them while I was trying to focus on making the orb light up
---
I never understood why so many people, if not most, don't care about OP runelite features. It's almost like an unspoken rule that you can't say the client is OP even though it obviously is.
---
Damn right.
---
You spec with BP because you don't waste ticks eating, it has increased accuracy and increased max damage. I'm not going to argue with someone who can't understand the math behind the meta. Continue wasting your time with BGS in a non blow pipe setup. 
---
Yep stop balancing around pvp. Nobody wants it, nobody does it except for hunting free loot from defenseless pvm'ers. Let pvp die.
---
That's what pking is to you? You might be retarded 
---
Same. Very annoying. Fixed mode gets this, but not resizable.
---
The amount of code for this ring though, they gotta go through every item in the game
---
Probably with the Deadman update 
---
Who even fletches 
---
found the brainlet
---
I've been explaining this to other people in the comments. Thank you for actually getting it. RS3 clue update absolutely ruined clues. The only thing saving them is fort components for invention. OSRS won't have that luxury. 
---
Why do you have to train at the most competitive low level place?

Of course people will be toxic there

---
From my personal experience I profit on doing eclectic implings even with excluding big clue scroll drops. Saving jars and banking most of the stuff from the jars is actually a large part of the cost for me. 
---
Its pointless arguing with you so i won't even bother trying like i did last time (how i recognized your name, i didnt look at your post history btw).
---
The fact is that almost all forms of skill expression in this game are the byproduct of the clunkiness of underlying systems (prayer flicking and things like olm mechanics for solo raids are due to tick system, mouse accuracy and speed for switches and casting spells is due to clunky ui and tick-based system).
---
I and many other players will always vote against things that reduce opportunities for skill expression. 99% of this game is brainless and doesn't require skill anyways, it's nice that there is some content out there that does provide a challenge.
---
So many people fell for this, more funny than he post itself
---
Good quality post 
---
my opinion: ring should be dropped, but not the item that was inside it.
---
No it's better if it does work. Teach people to pay attention.
---
This is a bones to bananas comparison
---
I agree but they should have some type of appeal system for me to go to since I wasnt in control of my account when it was banned
---
When you put items in the bank, you can withdraw them as a stacked 'bank note' to transport more than 28 at a time. You can't use the note, to get the items back you need to use the notes on a banker. To get noted items along the bottom tab of the bank interface click withdraw items as: notes. 
---
Also to avoid confusion, this screen is your inventory. A loot bag or looting bag is an item to store additional items while in the wilderness
---
How is additional clues coming in not going to make a difference? Instead of only getting one clue a task, I can get 2 maybe even 3. Repeat that 100 times, that's an additional 200-300 clues, and that's per player.
---
Your weak ass brain surely must at least comprehend that. 
---
Sorry I meant all the untradables not all of them. Like the large spade. 
---
Aw ur so cute. Since nobody is helping you:

The tin you have at the top is in it‚Äôs noted form. You can turn anything noted at a bank.

Well hopefully I've given you a reason to back to them. üòÇ
---
Honestly, how PvP works as a whole kinda needs to change. Not so much how you fight, but more how you get into fights. Like some form of PVP minitournament type of thing. Something that rewards PVPers with stuff you can ONLY get via PVP. Maybe PVP Barrows type of thing, where instead of fighting the barrows brothers, you enter a tournament, where you PVP one on one in rounds until just 2 people are left, and then you're dropped down into an arena like the final area of barrows and then you have to fight for the treasure.
---
The idea would also work as a way to have PvP that doesn't pay out with the other guy's stuff.
---
I mean sure I am interested but what the fuck does this have to do with osrs
---
Prob just the cheapest barrows tank legs, fighter torso, obby shield.
---
I think torags plate and legs are like 1m, obby shield like 300k. You could tank karils too at that point. Though veracs will always hit through prayer and defence.
---
Probably ideally you'd want veracs.skirt, and helm for additional prayer bonus but your prayers just gonna get drained anyways. So whatever you can afford. 
---
Agreed.Alright, exp waste these trees won't cut themselvea
---
Adorable I love it
---
Increase the size of the map and give unlimited or 0 prayer are 2 good starts in my opinion.
---
Man hackers are fucking nice these days
---
I'm not being a baby about anything though? And the game isn't difficult, just time consuming.

Ehh. He said he used to play but recently started up again. And  i gave him runes so he could go kill dragons. He said he wanted to make money so I gave him a little something to help him get started on the grind. Cmon. Let‚Äôs not pretend we all haven‚Äôt accepted a little help from time to time

The only thing it might do, is make it easier to spec when switching from a non spec bar weapon. But im unsure

I tend to play Daggerfall when afking osrs. It's so ridiculous and a lot of the time I have no idea what I'm doing or where I'm going but it's a ton of fun. Good to see that TES got the graphical and UI upgrades it needed, before the series went to shit that is.

Do the depths of despair quest as soon as possible - this will get you access to the crabclaw caves where you'll always be able to find a sand-crab spot to train your combat. Get your combat to base 60s then kills green dragons to remake the bond money. Once you have base 70s you can start the recipe for disaster quest to go for barrows gloves long-term, also get a dragon defender. Start slayer once you have base 70 combat stats, once you have 70+ slayer you'll be able to make bond money in a few days from kurasks/wyverns/gargoyles.

Yeah the pray flicking necessity is just cancer. You can argue it brings a skill to the table but then you have to accept that less player count comes with it

When you hit 70 mage and range I'd def suggest getting a black salamander cause it can hit with magic, range, and melee and the ammo is only like 8 gp ea.

99-50 = 49.
---
49/7 = 7.
---
1/2^7 = .0078
---
This account is 0.78% maxed.  Wow that's way further from 99 than I thought it would be.
---
that‚Äôs not how max hits work
---
if it doesn‚Äôt round up to a max hit, say it calculates to like 40.75 instead of 40.25 
---
every time you roll it‚Äôs out of the .75 instead of .25 so you‚Äôll hit your max hit more often 
---
it also adds up. If you trade the tassels or obby legs for v skirt you trade off more and more

I'm one of the people that hated the gay pride event and I see nothing wrong with this, in fact I think it's great. It's not like they're adding unpolled shit to the game, they're just answering questions. More power to them, these are the types of events that they should be doing. In fact, all I see is people complaining that someone might complain about it, nobody actually complaining about it.
