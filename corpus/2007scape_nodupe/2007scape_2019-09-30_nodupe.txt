Some of the minigames test for potion use. They don't like it if you use anything that changes your stats.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Some potions are normally allowed and some potions are usually banned. 
---
Level up your stats normally, don't use stat boosters unless you have to.
---
You got a good belly laugh outta me.
---
do you mean the intermediate boat? and you really dont need void for much early on no real reason to rush it.
---
&gt; i dont count it as legit death
---
he probably already was 2 def but lied to you
---
Wikipedia has some well written stuff on a lot of the topics, but you have to grind a lot of it out.
---
It helps if you have someone to help you out. Like a father or a friend. Don't try ironman mode, it's pointless.
---
I mean, a lot of people watch streamers regarding the game they're playing. He's super likeable and entertaining, theres a reason hes the #1 osrs streamer.

Swiftkit is nothing like the third party clients we have now. It didn't give any advantages that you couldn't already get through the web browser (skill calculators, highscores etc.). Jagex also forced swiftswitch to remove their world switching feature which was the only real advantage the client had.

I appreciate everybody's more serious/impressive series, but your humorous one-off videos are becoming the cream of the crop for me. I've watched Trolling the Swampman about 10 times, love this kind of nonsense.

lmfao you guys that depend on 3rd party clients are fucking hilarious.

I have only ever used the official client.

What an awful play &gt;\_&gt;

Nowadays you have 1 hour to pick up your stuff and it just disappears. Only place you can be looted is the wildy.

It‚Äôs because people we‚Äôre ddos‚Äôing the servers just for the lulz and a lot of people were losing a ton of stuff to disconnect deaths
---
Yeah you clearly dont actually play the game, because you have no idea why the current death mechanic was implemented. Neet.

And unfortunately for both of us im over 2200 total. Thanks for playing though.

True... If I were to redo it, aside from fixing some sizings, I'd probably replace "Short Stream" with "Satisfactory Response" or similar. But too late for me to change it now... Like it is literal too late for me; I need to be in bed in like 15 mins to get up early.

You can't, it's a server notification. You'll see them for other players too.

Wholesome af! Cherish him, he‚Äôs playing the right way.
---
It‚Äôs sad to know how mindlessly grinding vorkath/Zulrah compares to mindlessly grinding a fast food job? Playing the game is fun but mindlessly grinding gp is incredibly moronic.  
---
Also I‚Äôve never bought a bond and solely play my HC. Thanks though ü§ó
---
Little bit dramatic, aren‚Äôt ya bud?
---
When I discovered the Wiki I thought it was the best thing ever because I progressed so much faster than ever before. Now I wish I could go back to actually having an adventure.
---
Nah fuck that. Its not worth the time to run bones, people pay shite for what you're doing. The only running service worth doing is for runecrafting.
---
i understand what you are saying, if my room counter didn't say i still had all 33 rooms (have 32 now), i would brush it off as a mistake on my part or if i got hacked. I know I did not get hacked because I still had all my gear, and i do not think i somehow managed to remove it because my counter says i am still at max rooms and would have gone to 32 if i removed it.
---
Not trying to lash out, just a little flustered at the situation because I am positive it is a bug, and do not want to lose all my stuff because of it
---
seeds every birdhouse run
---
So fucking true, haha.
---
Doesnt change the fact that the situation still blow? Why is it so hard to grasp that i understand but dislike the situation?
---
Yeah, but I also hear ‚Äúgetting to xx RC made me wanna off myself.‚Äù Like every time lol. Slayer may be slow, but it‚Äôs entertaining. RC feels like watching paint dry to me.
---
All of b0aty content is boring tbh
---
No worries I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad I‚Äôm just offering a different perspective since it caught my eye. Still looks good.

That pet grind has cost him a lot when you consider he could have been doing efficient tob at 12m/hr.
---
deserved..."sub sunday", only subs watch him, chat literally doesn't change, hcim can't afford a prayer pot.
---
That actually was nice
---
That's a valid way to play. I personally find it the other way around: I think runecrafting (or specifically challenging myself to go faster and make more runes) is a lot more entertaining than slayer. I know I'm in the minority here but I don't care. We can both play how we want. :)
---
It‚Äôs over nice-thousand!!!!

Here is the standard gear people use in single way combat for med levels and main. It's \~800-900k risk. 
---
range switch- rune crossbow (dstone bolts e), black d'hide top/bottom 
---
mage switch- ahrim staff/ancient saff, mystic top/bottom
---
AGS for spec weapon and also melee weapon.

Other gear is neitiznot, spirit shield, b gloves, climbing boots, glory, mage cape (can be imbued), recoil.

Think the final design was they would be charged with shards that give charges (capping at 250 max) and would become unusable when uncharged (think like trident) and you could obtain more shards by breaking down the weapons (or potentially as a BH crate reward?)

just out of curiosity, why dont you like kalphite tasks? its an easy 5-7k slayer xp and they take like 5 minutes with a cannon.
---
I hope so as well, the mods have noticed it, so hopefully it will not be too hard to sort out
---
I think it might force you off the tile you were barraged under on the right tick? Not sure though.
---
Pls do updates or something, I love this
---
This is 100% you
---
Void is needed for most high level content like raids so yea it‚Äôs worth. Or anywhere where accuracy is needed and not necessarily strength
---
How does the OSRS wiki calculate the weighting of a slayer task? Is this similar to how they work out the drop rates from monsters?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs worth it you could make a lot of money possibly

All I'm saying is advocate for your content based on the merits of your content. There is absolutely no need to create problems as an excuse for your idea to come into the game, as I said I like the idea. You're not simply suggesting an idea you're saying your idea should exist because current content is bad
---
Are you looking at your pc from across the room?
---
You can‚Äôt get your stuff back. And, the last login is displayed every time you log in, as well as access point.

Literally my first thought when playing. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the grind or the the people but the community is so huge it‚Äôs ridiculous. Especially how long it‚Äôs been going

No u

That's the only time I can check?

I am confused as to how teleports are punishing. Are you implying it should require less construction to make them? If so I disagree, there is not a real reason to do that.
---
You would also have to fight the community of people who already climbed over that wall of construction EXP and did it for the cool features. Those people would not be happy having their hard work devalued.
---
But potentially another direction for balance is needed; you are correct.

I don't doubt for a second that this sort of bug could occur. Have you tried hopping worlds and reentering your poh?  
---
  
---
Sadly it might just be permanent without any way for mods to really help. If the glitch isn't reproducable or on video, there's probably no chance a jmod would reimburse you. Best of luck with the rebuild. It might be worth deleting a room or two that have low value, so that your achievement room isn't your 33rd / last room. The bug is likely related to that I would presume.

I have a flipping account like that, it's 50 attack and strenght 75 defence, 80 magic, 40 range.

I normally walk it around with a dfh, 3a plate body, bondos tassys, eternal boots, dfs and a granite hammer, if people ask how I got my money I just say slayer(level 30)

---
What would happen if it could smelt nuggets?
---
The best GP hour would be leeching torsos. You could learn the efficient defender/healer role for barbarian assault. Healer involves a decent amount of mouse accuracy and knowing the healer codes and defender requires knowledge of ticks and timing.
---
It isn‚Äôt overly hard but will require you to get level 5 in collector and either healer or defender and some practice. Casual BA is a good place to practice when you have 2 level 5s.
---
BA Boosts cc you can make 6m an hour and BA services you can make 7-11m an hour but has higher knowledge reqs. 
---
Baservices.site has guides and there is a BA School to help you improve in the roles.
---
I loved doing that. People would get super mad though.
---
hyahahhaha!!!! W O W!
---
Short range high damage spells. A spell that gets stronger every time you cast it without moving. A spell that starts as a 7t spell, but gets 1t faster every time you cast without missing a tick until it's at 3t speed, make it so it can't be auto cast too. A spell that hits everything between you and your target. 
---
Basically spells that increase the skill cap.
---
Would like to see them as a reward from raids 3 and as additional spells on the ancient spell book (assuming we get dessert raids, thematically fitting).
---

Sell the Ahrims, buy a smoke battlestaff, slayer helmet (i) and occult necklace.
---
I think fire bolt with chaos gauntlets will be the most budget friendly spell. Not sure if Tome of Fire would be worth it. It does increase damage a lot but each charge is 3.5x the cost of the base spell (80gp for a chaos rune, 285gp per tome charge). In the same vein, fire wave would be more than twice the cost per cast for +1 max hit (Maybe more with bonuses?)
---
You must have used pp up on it.
---
Yeah move that shit

Mate OSRS runs fine on anything capable of running java. I use a Thinkpad Z61t from 2006, Core Duo T2400, 3gb of ram and Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics. It still runs vista, and OSRS runs fine on it.
---
Pick up an old business laptop on eBay, a Latitude E6410, Thinkpad T410 or HP Elitebook I can‚Äôt remember the model name of would all be under 100$ with similar specs and would all be capable of multiple runelite clients without issue.

That's exactly what menu entry swap does at the end of the day, it changes a user's input. Use bone on alter in equally an automated change is user input , just as left click banking or black jacking. The line should've been drawn at no input changing at all under any circumstances, but because menu entry swaps exist many clients are toeing the line.
---
Would you like some cheese with that wine?
---
Me in my 20s except it‚Äôs actually my 30s and what am I doing with my life
---
Just a note, menu entry swaps are doing a right click and a mouse movement for you too... It's useful and convenient to skip right click bones, move mouse, left click use, move mouse to alter (osbuddy). It's useful and convenient to skip right click bones, move mouse (RL). The only difference between the two is the arbitrary lime you've chosen to draw about to what degree changing client inputs is and isn't acceptable.  Not having a hard stance that no client side manipulation is allowed is what allows these plugins to exist. 
---
Shift dropping and withdraw options are fine because no inputs are being changed by clients, jagex explicitly allows these features. No input modification should be allowed by any custom client for any reason.
---
I usually just use an alt or give someone 20k in a minigame CC.
---
yeah agree, i love how reddit osrs has fixated views of playing the game. Mostly jealousy speaking :,(
---
I mean, he gave his daughter up for adoption because he couldn't handle being a parent. He was basically very irresponsible and brought someone into the world that he couldn't handle because he and his GF at the time were horny.
---
I hope that girl will have a good life away from someone who has emotional problems and is known to support gambling. A Friend has also sort of been wishy-washy about the situation with his girlfriend and has said "I'm back!" and "I'm alone now" multiple times only for it to be revealed that he is still with that woman (even now).
---
Basically he is very inconsistent about what he says and also his YT content is garbage now. There was no reason left to support him. What a fall from grace.
---
Omg a fucking crab i better post this on reddit since its never been fucking done before hahahaha
---
Loooool.... This man always wanted full bandos..  So he activated that CC and made that shit happen.. His bank account and now his pride have both been sent to the shadow realmüíÄ
---
Could be done with botting probably.
---
assuming they get $0.50 per 1m (Probably a bit high), they'd need 48m per day to make $24.
---
If they were talking about wildy green dragons, which is kinda stereotypical Venezuelan gold farmer stuff, you'd need 18 accounts to get 48m in 8 hours. That's using wiki's gp/hr (350k/hr) which can be a bit high. Probably not doable manually but I'd imagine a bot could do it pretty easily. No clue what it would take to run 18 instances of osrs and a bot or what that would cost in Venezuela though.

if you fail at jad and go back, i recommend better defensive gear to save more supplies such as veracs helm and skirt with blessed dhide body and bis gloves whether its barrows or blessed dhide vambs. this will save you loads of brews even with lower dps than void. 
---
guthans is also great for healing throughout the caves and if you do bring guthans, dont bother with veracs helm and skirt (same as guthans but with prayer bonus) and just wear the guthans with blessed dhide for the 2 extra inventory slots. a large pile of purple sweets are useful for situations where low amounts of hp need to be healed and are also very useful for restoring run energy in the caves.
---
focus on the order to kill the monsters as messing this up will always use more supplies. if youre not familiar with this watch some videos that will explain the correct order to maximize supply usage. i recommend silven's video.
---
lastly, bring dragon darts to switch into your tbp prior to jad fight while killing the last orange mage (the orange mage also shows where jad will spawn). the dps upgrade is huge compared to addy and will make the fight significantly easier.
---
with the set up i recommended, your inventory should be 2 guthans pieces, 200 dragon darts, 100 purple sweets, 3 full bastion potions (use throughout the waves, save 2 doses or so for prior/during jad fight), 7-8 full brews, and the rest full super restore potions (14-15). you will have supplies left over but better safe than sorry. remember to drop two empty vials to unload/reload your blowpipe while killing the last mage. 
---
this gear and inventory are somewhat costly depending on your bank but these are the supplies that will make your trip significantly easier with your stats. i recommend grinding out getting the gp necessary and going back properly supplied instead of trying again with welfare gear and causing yourself anxiety in the caves or frustration after dying. being relaxed on your first jad kill will go a long way. 
---
hope this helps, gl on the cape and dont give up.

lol
---
That's not /u/MrPringles23's point was though, he just said that bug reports don't seem to do anything and mentioned how a bug he frequently reports for 3 years still hasn't been patched. Yes, they're on different levels of severity, but I doubt Jagex looks at a bug for 3 years and says "I shant fix it, tis not severe enough, NEXT!".

More than likely they would have people running shifts going 24hrs a day and at least a dozen accounts at any time. Once you realize your income is only limited by how much time you put in, you quickly find ways to maximize it.
---
Btw I have only ever had one account. With runelite, can you just log in with as many accounts as you want or do you need a special setup?
---
lol ok
---
It seems to me like pk'rs are trying to distract everyone from what this poll's benefits actually are. Does anyone really think pk'rs are going to use these weapons against eachother? Hell no, thats insane gp risk. Youd have to go on a pretty good streak to make the risk worth it. These weapons are simply to make it easier to kill players not fighting back.
---
Crystal gear are powerful new weapons you can only get after the quest song of the elves
---
Top quality post
---
The problem was specifically that people were ddossing servers to kill and get the loot from pvmers. The 1 hour loot update was made to disincentivize ddossing, but it's still possible to grief pvmers for the lulz.
---
I didnt say 'cheating'. I said they're pathetic leeches

It likely won‚Äôt be that severe, there was a similar uproar in early 2017 about AHK. This is almost exactly the same thing just with a different interface. It‚Äôll be some variant of that ahk stuff

A good ~endgame diary to aim for is Lumby/Draynor Elite. Not having to use Dramen/Lunar staff for fiary ring is great. Bones to peaches is a pain and runecrafting can be a bit of a grind, but it's well worth it imo

they should go up when they buff them (i hope)

Wollah actually doesn't simply mean you're swearing something but that you're swearing something on Allah. So he's swearing on Allah that it's a big fish. This just makes it silly when you see non Muslim people use the word.

My iron was hacked yesterday I claimed it back it's been cleaned I had auths  everything I'm calling it on os buddy I used it not long ago on only that account but not on any others which are still fine. Same has happened to a few people I know too
---
Same here. Dutch 'slang' is the worst. People using kanker and wollah together feel like the Dutch equivalent of trailer trash.
---
But if the animation can be canceled by prayer flicking, this definitely was not intended by Jagex.
---
Literally stood at entrance of corp to watch me for 5 minutes. As soon as he didnt see me go back to poh, his friend logged in and they crashed me with 2 scythes. But dont worry, seeing his attitude, the guy who commented first is either someone who crashes himself or maybe even one of the 2 who crashed me just now

Holy shit lol

That would make sense if he wasn't wearing amulet of accuracy

Are there any tech savvy people that can help me get through the proxy at work? I have admin privileges, so runelite is installed. But I get stuck at ‚Äúdownloading bootstrap‚Äù.

I was going to grind it out to 99 for my 1st 99 ever. Stopped at 90 (130k away from 91). Planning to pick it up soon after I get 1.000 Easy Clue Scroll Caskets. I did do Blast Furnace for a bit of money too, but mostly put all of that back into the skill / bonds
---
where are your barrows gloves

How'd you know :o

Your yelling makes me anxious.

There's so many ways to get your total, it's cool to see how everyone gets there

You forgot the requirement of the days spent learning the phases and prayer cycles with like 60 phases to differentiate between each other.
---
meh im fine with whatever they do to them, made over 230m so far so its w/e at this point.
---
Thanks! :D
---
I actually did level my RC to about 50 or something (if I remember correctly) on my old acc (which is now RS3).
---
I haven't had any reason apart from the varrock/wilderness easy diary to level a bit of runecrafting, so that's why it's that low :D
---
I'm pretty sure jamblex only acknowledge you if you tweet them so maybe try that
---
I'm currently working on getting 1.000 Easy Clue Caskets. After that I'll probably go and get my 99 smithing as my first 99 EVER.
---
Thanks :D
---
used osbuddy until runelite became better for free and never had a issue, i would say you should work on your account security instead of trying to spread false fear.
---
Well you sure showed me I bet all of the 3 people who saw your comment were very impressed by your internet debating proficiency
---
Remember to switch protect from melee after finishing jad. Seen many ppl lately getting killed by healer after beating jad and not getting cape as result
---
said no one ever.
---
Come back when you‚Äôve got a 99 and a decent username, you fucking scrub.
---
I would also add to this if Italy isn‚Äôt your thing try the long rock. Everyone is different and for me I find the long rock better. 
---
Ticking off each wave on the wiki and knowing what is next is a great thing to do.
---
Lastly always prioritise getting your prayer on and killing the mobs you‚Äôre not praying against. 
---
I‚Äôve seen too many people die trying to save prayer points when all it does is end up making them chug brews and restores from the damage
---
Best of luck and have fun!
---
Yet you're still posting on the Reddit lol?
---
as someone who has beat all end game combat without the use of op plug ins, i can say with confident that it doesnt mean or feel any better to do said content without an aid.  i dont feel like my infernal cape is better then someone who used other methods to get it, end of the day both capes offer the same stats and its an achievement that feels good for about 2 minutes until you find something else to work on.

Youre right, but thats also highly irrelevant for this current conversation
---
They obviously won't blacklist the clients. For the most part they're harmless. They only become a problem when features are added that push the limits of what is allowed. 
---
Loads of people use the clients - even people within Jagex. They understand how beneficial it is for the game if they're kept around. If they blacklisted them, they'd turn a huge amount of the community against them.  
---
More likely there'll just be more concrete guidelines and harsher penalties against clients that break them.
---
Recently been hanging out in F2P world's (mostly 301 or 393) helping out new players by giving them free iron armor :) and 10k, and some help if they ask for it.
---
no, i have 4 alts with 3 of them max combat (lvl 126 and all 99 combat stats) with 99 slayer on 3 of them, if i can do that pkers can make their shitty little pures with 1 def and 50 attack.... not like it takes much time getting to 50 attack 99 st, less then 2 weeks ffs.
---
*cries at 99 farming doing seaweed/herbs/trees everyday for almost a year

Looks like you smoke once a week iykyk

whats the point of making a Lv 60 slayer req monster unnecessarily hard? Skele Wyverns can be safespotted as well and it is not very efficient on either of this monsters to safe spot.

If you haven't done any,(and you use the exchange a lot) varrock med is the one to go for. Allows you to use the varrock teleport direct to the grand exchange.
---
 If you have 210k gold, you can also make the easiest ~30k of your life, since you can buy 30 battlestaffs from zaffs shop in varrock for 7k each (must be in one go, so 210k), sell on the ge for at least 8k. Make sure to use the barrel though, don't buy from the npc
---
You mean this is good for your cv. You worked for a company that did all of this and still made big bucks? 
---
Hired. 
---
Money is the name of the game. Name me a big game maker these days that doesn't employ mtx, gambling mechanics and shit. Even Nintendo has gave in.
---
oh man so many companies buying and selling jagex all the time
---
&gt;Then again the anecdotal evidence youre responding to isnt exactly a strong argument either
---
Also, what gear you use and how often you get PKed still arent relevant to the argument of toxicity in pvp
---
I mean, they had no problem with publicly lying about it to parliament.
---
Ah another low IQ pvper. Their net profit is higher than ever
---
If everyone is breaking a rule it doesn't mean that it's perfectly ok to do so. I'd say it's particularly bad in the sub, but it is a problem for all of reddit.

If Ash leaves they might as well just shut this game down, as soon as he goes we‚Äôll be completely fucked.

I've heard there are some 2005 backups currently being developed.

They‚Äôve all moved on to twitch to sell their own content and get way more irl gp bc jagex knows it‚Äôs times almost over and won‚Äôt offer raises on already shitty wages.

You shut your mouth.

You people are missing his point. He's saying that it's about whether it's in retaliation or not. Of course some people might be angry and say some bad things after being PKed, but the ones PKing and saying that shit are straight up just toxic
---
Heroin = dopamine pretty much. Like not really, but pretty much
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
do  Wyverns have a bis item
---
Wait, that doesn‚Äôt seem right
---
It's harmless but that doesn't change that it was something that was snuck in around the same time rs3 monetization started ramping up. Clearly someone is pushing for old school monetization in anyway possible.
---
If Jigbox doesn't update their shoddy client to match the quality of life that Runelite gives, then so much of their player base will just straight up leave. Honestly just clarify that some of these OP BS plugins that RSB or RL+ have are bannable and considered cheating and enforce it. Runelite AFAIK doesn't really have anything OP to the point of crying over. And honestly if you think some of these QoL things are cheating then either switch to RL yourself or continue to be a caveman using the Jamflux client. Mob mentality will be the death of this game.

That totally depends on your definition of reasonable time frame.
---
You can still make 5-10m an hour raiding without the use of an alt, so if you need 1b (Just pulled that number outta my ass, but 1b should be more than enough to cover the buyables you have left) that's an extra 100-200 hours added onto your grind.
---
I'd still highly suggest making an alt, even post-max they come in handy for a plethora of things (raids alting, dolo bosses, spec transfer for solo bosses, hell running you supplies, really anything).
---
Just have the wiki page open and its fast af still lol

You're kinda dumb

Where I'm from we usually use that word for just 2. Might depend on the locale I guess.

Can you partner when one has a task and one hasn't? for example my friend gets greaters, if I finish my task can I join up with him and duo zammy both on task?
---
Playerbase has been in freefall since January. Check misplaceditems. Even the major releases in  Kebos/Hydra and SOTE haven't bucked the trend for more than a week at a time. There hasn't been any lasting content that pulls and keeps players in, the streamable. long-term engaging stuff since ToB, and even that relatively low engagement compared to other things like CoX and Inferno. I think this is illustrated by a lot of streamers struggling for content - there's only so many times you can watch an early Ironman or somebody do CoX, and even DMM was getting very stale.
---
I know a lot of people who have spent years doing end-game PvM who are just bored with the scarcity of engaging content and most of all, kind of tired of hearing about all these promises that always seem to get delayed or never materialise. I don't think the problem is just mobile players didn't take to it (although I'd imagine a large chunk of these did leave), but a lot of people who have played for years are just burnt by the lack of lasting content. 
---
I think the biggest contributor of all is just the lack of faith in Jagex to deliver on things. It's not the fault of individual Jmods, many are beloved, but the management and direction of the company often leads to players scratching their heads and frustrated.
---
I agree with your statement about caring less about people in the who are not in the public eye. I am a offender of this more than id like to admit.
---
Yes.
---
Dont forget how they went from 2 and heavily advertised a third position in anti-cheating to only 1 at the start of this year and all job listings in anti-cheating removed at the same time.

I said a few weeks ago when the other mod left that something is going on at Jagex. A few hundred smart people upvoted me and agreed but a few idiots said it was just standard ‚Äúcorporate restructuring‚Äù, no, morons, there is something going on when you lose what? 5 J Mods in 12 months that have been there for like 3+ years and some of them like 10+ years.
---
I like this new meme format. Continue for two days, but make sure we stop after that.
---
Rushing is fine. Deal with it. We have had enough shit updates catering to you snowflakes. Little changes might make rushing in pvp/bh a bit "better" but negatively affect many other pvp situations.
---
I've looked at the code for this (RuneLite is open source.) This is actually not what's happening.
---
They're literally moving the menu items. You're clicking the correct one.
---
He
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Yeah this is not what's happening. Check the code out. It's on github.
---
Nah riot world 392 at Lumbridge General store. Bring your best items.
---
Probably not. People are going to always jump to the worst conclusion every time a JMod leaves. Chances are it's just a salary issue considering how shit Jagex pays their employees. 
---
I'd assume most JMods are doing it out of the passion they have for the game, but at some point you have to move on.
---
My dude second of October is on Wednesday.
---
Again, look at the code. It's on github. They're not adding extra movements.
---
Even if he left for something better, MOST people don't leave unless something goes wrong even if under paid. I think its pretty normal for people to think its a bad sign if someone leaves at a seemingly random time without another job to back it up.
---

Man I feel this. Got all combat stats up to 60 in about a week on osrs, while back in 2010 it took me years to hit that because I didn't know jack. Back then it was about the exploration and being amazed at all the dudes with full dragon plate and a godsword. Don't forget the infamous Dclaws. Now it's about leveling as fast as possible because... Reasons?
---
You can PK with any stats but with the stats you mentioned, you‚Äôd probably be up against max strength 75 attack pures that would smack you out pretty easily.

There's like, what, 3 jmods left?

&gt; or you think suddenly all jmods just left for no reason?

What a stupid question. You offer one (blatantly incorrect) reason for J mods leaving, and then pretend that it's either the option you're offering or people leaving for no reason. 
---
There are a world of possibilities that lead to J mods leaving, "pkers quitting so Jagex offers employees a lower salary" is approximately 483248348th in the list of likely reasons.

It's a semi to full AFK grind that takes a week to get. Want a more impressive grind? Play 1000s of c wars games. Grind some boss pets, get your inferno cape. Grind clue untradables. All of these are much bigger grinds than the champions challenge but for some reason noobs grasp onto that cape like it's some sort of ultimate achievement.

Honestly that‚Äôs actually not a customers concern. Internal policies which do not have a direct effect on the product should not be an issue as long as the product maintains the quality which is desired by its consumers. Now I know because of certain presumptions we have about Jagex (mtx and such) our defensive mechanisms kick in when a friend of the community leaves, but thats actually all there is to it. Its an emotional relativity response, not an objective rational one.

‚ÄúGold in its natural mineral form almost always has traces of silver, and may also contain traces of copper and iron. A Gold nugget is usually 70 to 95 percent gold, and the remainder mostly silver. The color of pure Gold is bright golden yellow, but the greater the silver content, the whiter its color is. Much of the gold mined is actually from gold ore rather then actual Gold specimens. The ore is often brown, iron-stained rock or massive white Quartz, and usually contains only minute traces of gold. To extract the gold, the ore is crushed, then the gold is separated from the ore by various methods.‚Äù 
---
From a website about minerals. 
---
TL;DR; Apparently gold ore has small amounts of gold. Gold nuggets can be up to 95% gold with trace amounts of silver.

She'd just tell me to get off the Nintendo

Because its literally a 200 iq move. Why not negate all damage until your prayer runs out then rely on your magic defense and eat food
---
tbh someone had to say it. The reason you dont see champion capes OP is because they're not worth it essentially. it's a clout Cape until with the recent resurgence of its popularity, they may try to poll it to give it better stats or an emote, I'd say that should be your concern over some decorated mithril armor

You really have no idea how the real world works in regards to pay, career advancement, and technical skill sets? 5 people leaving a company in 12 months after 5+ years is nothing out of the ordinary. OSRS probably has around 30-40 total developers and managers on their team. I would definitely shop around if I were any of the devs. They helped OSRS get to 100k+ concurrent players after barely getting 20k for years. Now is the time to sell yourself to other companies because now that mobile has released, it isn't going to get popular.
---
In regards to the actual technical skill set and pay behind the screen, I don't even know why any developer would stay at Jagex longer than 1-2 years. They're using an extremely old game engine built in Java. There's no future in Java in the current industry standard. The only thing you'll do is work on legacy code. You're not growing your skills in the latest and greatest tech, therefor you are not getting better pay and advancing your career.

Mod Babsi from the German RS3 localisation team also left earlier this year.

Should have been 69

I only play on mobile so idgaf.
---
On the flip side if I'd spent 15 years in a job and wanted to leave, I wouldn't immediately jump back into another one. I'd for sure take some time to relax and enjoy myself, especially at MMK's age.

It's both

If you're all about efficiencyscape then definitely get sand by mining it, you should get around 1.2k+ buckets depending on mining level, plus around 15-25k mining xp depending on mining level.
---
I‚Äôm honestly waiting for this to be removed
---
You don't need to explain anything! I totally understand... I leave RC the lowest just so tears of guthix can slowly bring it up.
---
&gt;I consider skills that have no real AFK options boring.
---
You're in the minority for having this opinion. Most people would't find staring at their client doing nothing for 30+ seconds to be fun. Infact most people would consider doing stuff like that to be boring.
---
It is for Mod Wolf
---
It was literally the top comment from that wyrm post as well
---
1/64 chance for them to all be the same i belive
---
Time out of their day? Lmao you take runescape too serious. It's a game. I would be happy to grant other players a small favor. I wouldn't want to get paid

get lucky

I've had to train agility to 56 for Regicide for my last hard clue. Finally made it yesterday.

We'll see after the 3rd party client announcement

plz give me 10mil

Nezzy helm was BIS for melee for years, and before that was zerker, both were buyable from a shop for under 100k. I don't know what is wrong with you people, making an impossible or extremely tedious monster to get the new BIS helm is literally the opposite of old school.
---
I'm near max combat and had like 400m in gear and I found them tedious and annoying to kill off task, not "afkable". Why even bother making them 60 slayer if you need 1b in gear to kill them?
---
Ive always been able to find someone nice on W2 willing to help out for free within a couple of minutes. just saying "need help with clue" everyone knows which clue it is.
---
I think you're underestimating the complexity of some bug abuses.

It's because he represents 2019 to the ones who play because they're stuck in 2007.

Yeah, the mobile version.

For as long as Old School has existed, unofficial clients have existed alongside it. While these did not initially cause significant issues, over time some add-ons offered by clients have become too intrusive, affecting the gameplay in unacceptable ways and competing for players‚Äô attention by offering increasingly over-powered benefits.
---
Whilst we‚Äôve previously/always made it clear that players using unofficial clients are doing so entirely at their own risk, we‚Äôd like to take this opportunity to offer some clarity.
---
As the game's owners, we need to look both at the current situation and where things will inevitably go in the future. We‚Äôll be more pro-active in protecting the interests of the game by outlining what features aren't acceptable, and by acting if these features are abused. We'd like to note that it's impossible to list every potential feature, so here we give general principles and examples.
---
We consider features which enable you to bypass gameplay mechanics to be unacceptable, like those which might indicate where projectiles would land, where NPCs might spawn, or which protection prayers to activate.
---
The same can be said of features which might modify how you select actions in the game or change how you click on menus, players, or NPCs, especially where the feature leads to you using fewer clicks than you would when using our client.
---
Examples of unacceptable features (note - these are merely examples, and are not an exhaustive list):
---
Features which allow you to engage in Blackjacking NPCs with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
Features which allow you to interact with altars with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
Features which allow you to interact with construction hotspots and items with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
Features which allow you to interact with logs with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
Features which tell you where Vorkath‚Äôs attacks might land.
---
Features which tell you where to stand to avoid Zulrah‚Äôs attacks, and what protection prayers to activate.
---
Features which tell you what the next Demonic gorillas attack will be.
---
As we‚Äôve said, this is not an exhaustive list, and we reserve the right to add features to this list in future. We‚Äôll continue to monitor community concerns about other specific features and offer more clarity if it‚Äôs needed.
---
We‚Äôre assessing our options on how best to enforce this, but ultimately use of unacceptable features, which we consider to be detrimental to the community‚Äôs experience of the game, will result in account bans.
---
However, we don‚Äôt want players to be left in constant fear of possible bans, so we‚Äôll give advance warning if any additional features are being considered for the list.
---
This statement isn‚Äôt meant to cover all possibilities, since new ones may emerge at any time, but it should give you more clarity about what you can or can‚Äôt do in the meantime. We hope to be able to offer more clarity in the future, and we‚Äôre going to reach out to the community to identify the right long-term solution which strikes the right balance between player enjoyment and game integrity.
---
Thank you for your patience.
---
The Old School Team
---
Basically: 
---
&gt; Examples of unacceptable features (note - these are merely examples, and are not an exhaustive list):
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Features which allow you to engage in Blackjacking NPCs with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
&gt; Features which allow you to interact with altars with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
&gt; Features which allow you to interact with construction hotspots and items with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
&gt; Features which allow you to interact with logs with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
&gt; Features which tell you where Vorkath‚Äôs attacks might land.
---
&gt; Features which tell you where to stand to avoid Zulrah‚Äôs attacks, and what protection prayers to activate.
---
&gt; Features which tell you what the next Demonic gorillas attack will be.
---
So basically, using 3rd party clients might get you banned or it might not...
---
Well this was anti climatic as fuck..
---
Glad they delayed the stream to write this post that ultimately says exactly what we thought it would.
---
Reminder that around 2010 lots of iconic Jmods quit their jobs without giving a real explanation like it's happening now, and the game went to shit years after that.
---
Join a clan and you'll always have friends willing to help out with this kind of thing. Having said that, it would be handy to have it moved.
---
So we waited two weeks for essentially nothing.
---
Really? Spawn markers are unacceptable? How will this even be enforced
---
Well, i dont see them being able to detect overlays for certain thngs. I guess we'll just have to wait and see if they are able to and if they issue the correct bans for it.
---
ouch, alot of the features they listed as not allowed are in runelite, like menu entry swapper.
---

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Yeah i can't enter from the website as well it says i typed incorrect ID Pass and i think this has a tie with my character name since it's blank.
---
Get that apostrophe out of there right now.
---
83 construction if you have the funds to build jewelry box and/or occult altar and/or ornate pool. If you dont, the 83 con won't do you much good where you are currently. I would use it on the dagger to help speed up profit per hour. If you have the funds to build those items in your poh (which i assume you don't based on the post) then I would definitely go with 83 con.
---
There's really nothing new here. So If we use certain features we might or might not get banned?
---
i hate u so much jagex
---
Guess you could say it's...50/50
---
Weak.
---
Now we know why Wolf left!
---
I dare not say I‚Äôm talented, but yet I have a choice, to do the best with a clarity of direction. My result is where it is integrated with technical knowing, experience, my ethics and values. Some assets cannot simply be given away freely
---
So basically it's "We find it unacceptable but we haven't got a clue 
---
 on how to stop it or enforce these rules".
---
It's time to fcking panic
---
Hopefully a ton of bans will be dished out. I have a feeling they wont enforce this fully. Which concerns me.
---
Menu entry swapper and tile markers = banned
---
I really doubt they can detect things like the zulrah one since it changed frequently and no fight is similar to the other.
---
Gotchu
---
Maybe try logging in with your email?
---
idk, the pray plugin at gorillas was only telling me what i already knew
---
nothing of this will be enforced
---
Its bound to a whole different account
---
This will be discussed in the live Q&amp;A starting in 8 minutes: https://www.twitch.tv/oldschoolrs
---
Oh so nothing happened
---
Guess we all should of got 99 thieving etc when we had the chance, gz for the smart ones who used the OP plug in's. This is their victory.
---
Eh, they're alright
---
So those who've just spent the last week abusing left click blackjacking, altaring &amp; construction are getting a free pass? Very cool! üëç
---
Hmm if you know the original character name that is your login name and should work. If you changed the display name that doesn‚Äôt change the original login username.
---
guys guys hear me out. MAYBE MAKE A BETTER OFFICIAL CLIENT 4Head
---
How do you guys feel as a company to have such a bad client that players hand over their login details to 3rd party entities to enjoy the game more?
---
intended upon release and intended now are two completely different things. Like I said jagex‚Äôs current stance is it‚Äôs not intended and that sentiment is reflected by a majority of players
---
Took you this long to post this pathetic uninformative message...
---
Damn your priorities are fucked.
---
&gt;The same can be said of features which might modify how you select actions in the game or change how you click on menus, players, or NPCs, especially where the feature leads to you using fewer clicks than you would when using our client.
---
RIP left click banker to skip dialogue?
---
Honestly you could buy runelite, use all the non illegal plugins make it the official rs client and make all other clients illegal and banable
---
tldr; plz stop using OP features we cannot detect or prevent u from using
---
This is basically nothing: the message. They can't enforce any of this. Integrity is in the bin. Took them a full week to come up with this useless statement.
---
"I'm just really good at tracking 30 seconds after a mob dies, and knowing where to stand for zulrah"
---
I suppose they mean dynamic spawns like Inferno and not just marking the static spawn location
---
This needed a delay?
---
lots of words, not a lot of action.
---
Imagine taking months to write nothing
---
TIL the wilderness is no place for crybabies. It's the wildy; the in game equivalent of the Old American Wild West. If you're in the wildy, pvming, and you run into a band of pkers, they're likely to not talk shit, tbh. But if they do, and it really bothers you, why dont you nut up and get some buddies together in some 300k risk and get out there and try it for yourself. It's some of the most fun I've ever had in OSRS, 100%. Hell you might even find yourself talking shit. Also pkers are more likely to shit talk other pkers, pkers who shit talk pvmers are just trying to get under your skin or make you type rather than defend yourself or tele out.
---
TLDR stop whining
---
TLDR; Don‚Äôt use the cheaty ones pls!!!! 
---
Not even a mention of all the broken PVM add ons for TOB, COX, etc.
---
Pathetic.
---
When did they add a tail to the rogue outfit?
---
lmao what a joke, there's no way they'll be able to enforce this.
---
Remember your roots homie, gotta say hi to the Duke every once in a while.
---
But yes I agree, I think they forgot about the RoL more than explicitly excluding it.
---
Ngl, wish I had abused the construction plugin while I had the chance... Like nightmare zone all over again. Nobody is catching bans
---
It made average trips change from 20/30 full focus to 50 unfocused and 100 focused try hard... idk i am shit tho without runelite help
---
Jesus Christ I‚Äôve never seen a company so out of touch with the player base.
---
Lol this took over a week.
---
Reminds me of the AHK "ban". Basically this is a bluff, they cant tell what client you're using so you can pretty much do whatever you want. It's still an all or nothing situation as far as I can tell.
---
I think the meme is used to discourage people to do rc and keep that payout decent.
---
I think a list of acceptable plugins would, even if not exhaustive, be more helpful than a non-exhaustive list of unacceptable plugins.
---
This guy's history is not representative of us as a whole
---
They can't, it's a joke
---
Should have joined in. This was the obvious outcome.
---
I expected nothing and i'm still dissapointed
---
Phew, thanks.
---
If you're a hcim, you still appear on the normal ironman hiscores. If you're a group Ironman, you wouldn't appear on the normal Ironman hiscores. I feel like this isn't hard to understand, it's just as aez says. It has Ironman in the name but it's not a true Ironman.
---
How incredibly vague and passive. Make a decision and go with it or don't say anything at all, rather than this convoluted, arbitrary decision making of certain features being disallowed. I wanted a simple, yes/no about whether other clients are going to be banned or not, and ideally that they'd be improving their own. But they took the classic Jagex indecisive fence-sitting approach that doesn't really do anything.
---
Yeah, what stops me from marking tiles manually?
---
how was this delayed for 4 days? It literally has nothing of substance
---
I've been helping out in the cc for quite a while and I never accept any payment.
---
Their stance hasn't changed; using unofficial clients is at the risk of the user.
---
But some specifics client features that permit you to do things with a lot fewer inputs than normal won't be permitted.
---
They aren't sure how to go about enforcing the use of specific plugins but people who use the plugings they mentioned will see bans for continued use.
---
i mean zulrah isnt hard lol
---
It looks like i could login to account just fine since game asks me my authenticator code but when i try to enter from website it just says no
---
We help each other. Stop jewing and out prices on everything.
---
Every player who farms demonic gorillas uses the plug in. I hope bans actually happen maybe zenytes will be worth something.
---
Send them broke boys right back to Lumbridge with the quickness
---
The payout really isn't that decent. The time vs the payout is dwarfed by literally any other content.
---
Tile markers? How so?
---
They can't it's just overlay that doesnt interact with the server at all.
---
Jagex should not buy runelite. They need to make a good client that supports addons. That way they can control which plugins get added to the game.
---
You‚Äôre making assumptions. More locations are added to match an increase in player size. Not to remove crashing.
---
Is anyone really surprised by this? Were people *actually* expecting a ban on 3rd party clients? Come on people, this was the **only** viable response: reassure the community that 3rd party clients as a concept are OK (obvious), then make sure overpowered features are clearly labeled as undesirable.
---
This was anti-climactic to say the least..
---
This post = 
---
To anyone who doesn't like 3pc, eat balls and stop complaining
---
To anyone who likes 3pc, just keep doing what you're doing as long as you don't stream it
---
The tile markers that you customly set on your own should be fine.
---
Exactly. How will they even know
---
Is there anyone left?
---
Yeah they're blanket banning google spreadsheets and excel so you can't have them running alongside your Runescape client anymore
---
damn so Jagex can detect squares on my screen on the client side but can't detect me botting 20m runecrafting through the abyss?  that's craaaaaazy
---
Several of the things they mentioned are easily detectable.
---
It's also too late to go back if the devs leave and the investors bail on jagex.
---
You‚Äôre right.
---
Nothing
---
wow insane luck mate
---
I guess hydra is retarded. Hunllef is retarded. 
---
It's a unique mechanic cuz it actually makes you focus, it's a great mechanic because it isn't afk ezslayerscape like 90% of the rest of osrs combat. And the plugin completely removes that effort.
---
I would have assumed the same, were it not for the fact that i was having issues with the boss lair display that night before i logged out, and that my room counter still says I am at the max amount of rooms (33), but only have 32 rooms there now
---
Bro they cant even detect this, no ones getting banned. Not those who used it last week. Not those who will keep using it.
---
Yes overlays are cheating.
---
Then they managed to repeat those five paragraphs in answering our questions at the top of the Q&amp;A. Great Question and Answer session guys.
---
Dick went from erect to erectile dysfunction real quick
---
And that's exactly why this whole post is useless.
---
Are you camping in multi? That's to be expected if so. Clan pkers are 100% more toxic than singles pkers and I think most of these clans are giving the whole pvp community a bad rep. Personally I rarely deal with toxicity in singles fights.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄOSBUDDY IS GONNA RUIN IT FOR EVERYONEü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
What about monsters weak to stab/crush/etc
---
But yeah, it's been known that rune scim is BiS
---
Both using dh would be a train wreck haha. But try it out sometime it‚Äôs super fun especially with an attacker in DH + T bow
---
Good idea, do you have a program recommendation for the screen recorder?
---
do you have iron in your name? thats just asking to be crashed.
---
Try flushing your DNS, changing your public IP address, and restarting your modem/router. See if it's working after doing each one in that order. If you don't know how, Google it. Only difficult one might be changing your public IP.
---
F
---
Which client is this? I've tried zulrah numerous times but I always panic and die. It's knowing where to stand that gets me, not the praying.
---
Its an overlay, jagex cant detect it. Keep using it, you're gonna be fine.
---
Runelite and OSBuddy's devs could work with Jagex while creating new plugins but we all know the chances of that happening
---
Wait what. So the standard run elite demonic gorillas plugin is not accepted anymore? Jeez I aint rebuying members.
---
He lost hair from the amount of radiation emiting from this company
---
Not helpful in the slightest. Jagex are really starting to worry me to be honest.
---
Except that easy and quick banking increases your xp rates. Which is quite a significant advantage over time. I like it myself, it should've been in the game by default, but it does offer an advantage over the vanilla client.
---
Not every banker has a booth.
---
Not entirely sure my comments can be classed as 'gaslighting' but we can have a difference of opinion, that's alright.
---
Cause they've fucked themselves, they either spend 6 - 12 months fixing the client and do 0 new updates and people will quit or they ban 3pc and people quit
---
does anyone even train there anymore after the nerf?
---
Yep the counting aspects of their attacks is easily the worst thing about them. Ive never died because i has the wrong prayer on, i die if i get comboed by one of their many other mechanics. Its not hard, its not fun, its just counting, again and again and again.
---
I‚Äôve always used the vanilla client and I‚Äôm happy. But I guess I‚Äôm more of a casual player so i never cared.

---
&gt;Features which allow you to engage in Blackjacking NPCs with fewer clicks than our client would allow.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Features which allow you to interact with altars with fewer clicks than our client would allow.  
---
&gt;Features which allow you to interact with construction hotspots and items with fewer clicks than our client would allow.  
---
&gt;Features which allow you to interact with logs with fewer clicks than our client would allow.
---
So basically OSBuddys plugins are the ones being focused on here. The post its self does answer our questions why is everyone mad about it? The unfair plugins have clearly been disallowed where as legitmate quality of life plugins havn't been mentioned so we are left to assume that they are still ok.
---
&gt; change how you click on menus 
---
This line is the only one I think could be an issue. I have my menus switched to prevent accidental burying bones and to bank quicker for example. 
---
&gt;However, we don‚Äôt want players to be left in constant fear of possible bans, so we‚Äôll give advance warning if any additional features are being considered for the list.  
---
&gt;This statement isn‚Äôt meant to cover all possibilities, since new ones may emerge at any time, but it should give you more clarity about what you can or can‚Äôt do in the meantime.
---
This also means ot me anyone who continues to use the OSBuddy and similar clients does so at risk of a ban from now on and as and when they change that list. 
---
Overall this is a good response IMO. Read the article
---
The way he says the word...?
---
Heh. I didn't realize you were the creator as well. I appreciate the reply as I feel like normally criticism is just swept away unless there is very notable backlash. You've most likely done this already, but expanding to twitch might be an option for some extra cash.
---
Or don‚Äôt use plugins that obviously entail cheating?
---
Not really? They may start tracking xp rates and banning accounts clearly using plugins like the blackjacking one?
---
I know its runescape so actual size ingame doesnt mean much but from my understanding ore has to be refined and cleaned up and huggets are just solid chunks that have no flaws like dirt, rock, etc. So i was just trying to show that it does make sense there would be ores and nuggets of gold. I wish runescape did care more about scaling and proper weights but wed all be complainig about that too haha
---
i am not sure, by just about everything says its just gone. The only thing that tells me it shouldn't be is my room counter on the in-game settings tab. Which says i am still at the max rooms, but am in fact one room less because my achievement gallery vanished
---
Is this painted on Duct tape?
---
Why?
---
Explain plz
---
overreacting like that is how you garner a fanbase on twitch, just look at the top streamers on the site.
---
The demonic gorillas pluggin does nothing if you pay attention. It offers no insider information. I don't see the issue with it.
---
Support! IMO stuff like Zulrah/Vorkath alts are QOL  as well since I'll be making money in 0 time anyway so can we poll legal botting as well so I don't have to click on multiple accounts?
---
No kidding
---
Lmfao your username I like it
---
honestly I don't want them spending 6 months reinventing the wheel, especially considering at this point, the game needs some new content.
---
You definetly started playing before 2016 when lower lvl money making methods where a thing. As soon as a new one is discovered these days, venezuelans just go into town with them lowering the margins. They just gold farm countless hours untill its less than 200k/h and switch to another one. Have fun explaining new unexperienced players that they need to play  30+ hours to get a 10M bank and finally enjoy the game with low lvl pvming/pking. Venezuelans are mainly the issue because electricity bills for them are a joke and they dont need a huge bot farm just to make profit.
---
&gt;Inferno Cape
---
&gt;All the max accs are hackers and the noobs are haters not much inbetween
---
Does this sound like someone who got the cape legit?
---
Well now that you've enforced you can't left click build/remove in construction. Do you maybe wanna add that as a game feature instead? The sole reason i hate construction is because it's just a trigger for karpal tunnel syndrome
---
so use a different banker if you are going to be doing a bank standing skill? whats the problem
---
Yes, because this is DEFINITELY what we want the few devs we have spending their time on. Forget addressing 3pc, balancing pvp, new content, and ramping up bot ban rates. THIS is why the people who don't play old school don't play.
---
Pressing 1 to remove, send away butler and to build. my left hand could be getting tired
---
&gt;ticklenomics
---
They can def enforce stuff like the blackjacking plugin by tracking xp rates and banning accounts that get over a certain threshold.
---
This game seems doomed unfortunately :/
---
I'm using my militarys public wifi, been working finw for +200 days. I flushed DNS but nothing. 
---
And my phones hotspot isn't working. Thanks for trying to help though!
---
I also wish the cape at least had stats, but I'd love to see an expansion on this!
---
Hopefully the mods will be able to fix it. I tweeted Mod Ash yesterday, got a response and told me to fill out a bug report in game.
---
Have already submitted it, so all i can really do is wait and pray something can be done.
---
At least they are aware of the issue though
---
Hey, there‚Äôs nothing h..... Oh i c
---
One can dream I guess
---
The things like the blackjacking plugin are detectable though, and you best believe Jamflex will be going after those ones hard.
---
I want to know this too.
---
She painted it on 2x2 canvas thing
---
I like the idea of it counting as the slayer equipment and I feel like lore wise it would fit, if you're 99 slayer theoretically that means you've spent tons of times in the dungeons so you'd know how to navigate them safely, and since using any boots in the konar dungeon is a diary reward it would make  sense that if you have 99 slayer you should be able to access it. (Look at varrock and fally diaries for using the banks in their respective guilds, it's either have the diaries done or 99 in the skill.) So it wouldnt be an unprecedented idea
---
Apparently they have new devs though yet to be announced. Plus if they start they can finish eventually. The thing is they need to start
---
fair
---
Would make it impossible for new plugins though, if people don't know whether something is acceptable.
---
Yea
---
2277 maxed level but you got no critical thinking
---
Maybe even a slayer point unlock
---
So we cant use boss timers or show the spawn locations anymore?
---
My combo was air air air air so it insta completed which im happy about cause i dont know if i could have solved it otherwise.
---
Really shows you how dumb the average viewer is, panic buying the jaw up on 3 day old information
---
I always turn on music for my farm runs, love hearing the old nostalgic songs in the old nostalgic areas.
---
Also while representing your company
---
There are 6 options, so that would be 1/214. For it to all be specifically air, it would be 1/1296. Not common but not crazy.
---
You should learn how to lazy-flick or flick. Personally I used to use proselyte when I was too tired to flick or lazy.
---
lmfao cya menu entry macroers
---
991atatime has a good one too
---
Why else do you use tile markers?
---
They can enforce everything on this except the overlays, you clearly have no idea how a lot of these plugins work
---
How are they out of touch? They‚Äôre making the move that appeals to the highest majority of their player-base.
---
* Ban all third party clients = Massive uproar from players, many quit.
---
* Approve anything = Players get angry that there aren‚Äôt limits or punishment
---
* Outline specific rules and enforce bans = Not possible; they can‚Äôt detect the client usage and outlining specific rules makes it easier to skirt around them.
---
Exactly what is it you think would be in touch with the player base?
---
Ban everyone who doesn't right click bank banker
---
Not sure you want to go down this road. The RS3 team has been developing their C++ client since 2016 - it is still unfinished and the team is much bigger than OSRS's.
---
Nope because no matter what identification system they would build into their client, people can decompile it, deobfuscate the code, introduce their customizations, and then ensure that wherever identification the server expects still gets sent as it would if they hadn‚Äôt modified anything. That‚Äôs my understanding at least. Hence why they can‚Äôt just auto-ban all the bots by detecting that it‚Äôs a bot client.
---
There's so many things wrong with the game right now that this is so low it shouldn't really even mentioned
---
Also it's been quite a while since we've really gotten a straight slayer update. It's all been pvp and quests for the last 6 months.
---
&gt;They literally can‚Äôt detect an overlay. I put the 99.9 to be a smart ass. I‚Äôm 100% sure they don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm using an overlay or not.
---
While its pretty unlikely they can't detect overlays, if they really plan to enforce the rule, I would expect some anticheat additions to the client
---
You're already one step ahead of other players at this point.  They would be begging in the GE for money :)  Keep up the grind, but more importantly have fun playing the game.
---
the only acceptable way to train in the late game is botting
---
actions lower than 100:1 are xp waste
---
I dont understand what I just read, I feel like I read a lot of words but the words had no meaning.
---
Your completely right.  Right now though, OSRS has a meta for everything.  Basically there is little to no diversity if you want to be efficient.
---
Is pirating a movie worth the jail time?
---
Why are people on such old iOS versions? There‚Äôs a few people on 6s that are back on iOS 10 still; 13.1.1 is the latest, and 12.4 is the oldest version that should be used
---
Basically: knock it off OSB, we aren't going to update the client to make it useable or mod-able. We'll tell you if your client is going too far.
---
Possibly but given the current situation theres definitely room to speculate
---
im saying he dosnt know if hes safe from being fired
---
It wouldn't be official but you can download save game versions around the internet
---
It's what they use to make private servers. Could just play by yourself if u really wanted
---
Because; the same people who were on the hype train a week or two ago about 'mobile bots are being banned less because mobile doesn't have mouse movements' are now on the band wagon of an ex bot maker saying 'these macros are okay because jamflex doesn't track mouse movement so they don't know you're using it, you can trust me, I don't run a paid client I want you to use or anything' simply because it suits them now.
---
At the end of the day, the only people who actually know if MES and menu clicks can be detected are the anti bot team, so everyone is saying it is or isn't detectable are either stating what they *think* or are riding Matt's dick because he's making EHP methods afk for them.
---
Don‚Äôt forget fossil lamps
---
what is the point of this? i don't get your title
---
1.3 mill after buying a whip.  My account is fairly new, so I'm in that grindy mid-level phase.
---
I'm torn between slayer and finding good gp/ph monsters.  I know I'm playing the long game with slayer, but the money isn't great at my level.  Do you have any recommendations?
---
And the banker problem has been removed by making left click bank booths in front of them. I think even where it is very clear and obvious that it should be switched, that should still be jagex' prerogative to do so.
---
qol in your opinion but they were still against the rules.
---
i also use rl and used those plugins but im glad jagex has finally started to enforce their own rules
---
Wtf you smoking that makes no sense and stop capitalizing the "A" in apple you dork.
---
Depending on implementation, this could either be sensible or senseless.
---
If you had equipment or spells that are effective specifically towards a set of situations, like dragon-bane weapons or scythe vs large targets, and designing content with those situations in mind, then that's thematically acceptable. Making a BIS weapon like Balmung for a Dagganoth/Basilisk raid would be perfectly in the spirit of RS imo. It's up to the game designers to work around the situations in which gear can be effective (even if they need to make a boss or boss' summon immune to range to stifle tbow/blowpipe).
---
If you made a genetic new magic metal weapon that's only good against bosses released after X date... that's just immersion breaking game design much like making PvP only mechanics. Some people might thank you for them, but there'll always be that lingering distaste and newer players will have trouble picking up on the arbitrary functionality.
---
Ok so you just don't want to play the fucking game then, got it lmao. Piss off.
---
Speaking of... ive had this clue for 3 days now can someone come duel me please?
---
You just ignored everything he said and just kept going
---
Yikes m8
---
Hmm, maybe tedious wasn't the right word. I'm looking for a word that means 'requiring focus for a long period of time.' Since you're good at english, maybe you can help me out here?
---
I don‚Äôt get it. So we should use the official client now? What about runelite?
---
til tarns lair has a bank
---
what about corp spec / bgs damage counter?
---
Why didn‚Äôt they tell RuneLite to remove the Demonic Gorillas plug in a long time ago like when they asked them to remove other stuff? 
---
So it looks like from today forward I can get banned for using the the demonic gorillas plug in? But not really since they can‚Äôt detect it?
---
It isn‚Äôt... if you want to bot something like alchs/fletching/crafting you do it in a popular world at the GE or w44 PC. Anywhere else is basically telling the world you‚Äôre a bot.
---
&gt;They have much more to worry about atm.
---
&gt;Exactly, I agree this is why a modern client/engine is needed.
---
Did you even read what he said?
---
scroll down once &amp; bingo there ya go.
---
Approximately 270 days
---
probably varrock west
---
Mostly people were hoping they would combat it by updating their own client.
---
Drakes are not dragons my guy
---
You're a condescending prick.
---
over the last quarter the average player online has dipped 25k\~ and we're only a few K away from being lower than we were last year.   
---
this year there have been 9 osrs departures, 3 of which were 5+ year employees, and Jagex today put out a nothing burger about cheating in their game. 
---
1\\3 of that 'highest revenue year ever' came from MTX in rs3 -- which will without a doubt make upper management push it into OSRS.  
---
If we're supposed to take Jagex's figures about bot banning as fact at any given time close to 1\\3 of the players online are bots (or 1\\4, but still not insignificant).  
---
Maybe to you that spells 'thriving game community' but I'm gonna chill over here in reality.
---
Can we also give all recolored slayer helmets the model update the Hydra helmet gets? Why does Hydra helmet get to be special?
---
What do you use ring of life for? Just curious. I'd expect anyone to have real (statty) rings by the time they're doing sote.
---
Unless there's a super awesome legit use I'm missing out on?
---
Yeah P(AAAA) = 1/1296. Not that crazy. How did you get 1/214 for P(NNNN)? Would it not be P(AAAA) + P(FFFF) + P(WWWW) + ... = 1/216?
---
Y‚Äôall are actually fucking stupid, no matter what they do ud complain.
---
Imagine getting banned for doing demonic gorillas correctly. Lmfao
---
I don't want to
---
The menu entries are all client side and so is the use function, you can test this by disconnecting your internet then right clicking on various objects and the right clicks are always correct. They have no way to know if you right clicked or not. Pretty much they have no way to enforce it and that's why you wont get banned for op plugins
---
theyre 2.5 mil in debt lol
---
owed 1.2 mil, owe 1.3. but they're owed 1.2 by a company that is insolvent which they are the principal owners of
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Runecrafting done
---
Yeah, I'm doing Konar for the foreseeable future until I can get a good melee gear setup.  The gp/ph has been lacking, and I'm not really sure if I'm better off putting slayer on hold, finding some monsters that have good profit, and building my bank that way for a while.
---
Do you have any insight/recommendations?
---
Dat ass
---
Crack
---
thats what i thought. Don't really get these comments
---
Requiring vigilance or attentiveness might be a good term for it
---
the game is actually more fun when you don‚Äôt have to grind
---
it used to be against the rules to train AFK. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it then you don‚Äôt like the game.‚Äù Now we have NMZ
---
it used to be against the rules to bot in order to trade at fally park. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it then you don‚Äôt like the game.‚Äù Now we have the GE
---
Learning how to automate tasks in an adversarial environment is basically a hundred times as stimulating as clicking a knight for 80 hours lmfao.
---
I agree with you that we should ban many-to-one inputs (and AFK training and remove the GE) because the game is more fun when you‚Äôre writing a program that has to evade detection than when the devs trivialize the content to get more daily active users to appeal to the private equity firm that owns them
---
What do you mean? My ‚Äúpurple‚Äù slayer helmets name is fine
---
Are they in order of when you got the 99? I tried doing that back on rs3 while I was maxing but lost track
---
Vanilla client isn't fixing dead clicks.
---
I'm more shocked about all the things bronze scimmy is better than
---
Perhaps, we'll all find out sooner or later.
---
 Yikes, no need to be rude bud
---
They're mtx.
---
The problem isn't that it's mtx it's that mtx has this huge negative connotation in your mind.
---
Bonds are an example of good mtx
---
Imagine thinking the blog isn't just empty words lmao
---
Only people getting banned are detectable stuff like multiple inputs
---
In the last month or so a handful of JMods (MatK, Maz, Wolf) have left so there's a bunch of speculation about that..
---
Song of the Elves came out recently which is a huge end-game update. The Fremennik Exiles just came out last week and is surprisingly easy.
---
How so? What would have been better? 
---
If they banned 3rd party clients then I'd agree they are out of touch.
---
lol fuck that
---
But it's their official client. Would you be happy with it if you were a Jagex mod?
---
I havent got any deadclicks yet on vanilla. How do I explain that then?
---
Dude I'm not talking about the osb ones. I've never considered using them. I'm talking about Leprechaun tools, farm contact, Slayer assignment, travel options, those ones are perfectly fine
---
I‚Äôm doing lava runes rn to get to 55 for Exiles. Currently 52. I already want to neck
---
Rip GenerateTask
---
For this game to contniue without becoming stale we need new items new bosses we need new stuff without killing what we do already have.  
---
Just a thought say they release a new set of armor Tier 2.  It is only good against the ONE new boss they released and just normal to all other bosses.  Who in our community would say "ah that content is stale I dont need that new gear I already have a whip."  Na everyone is going to go after it, streamers, youtubers, the maxed accounts.  Its new and everyone will want it before any one else.
---
Okay fine: ‚Äúauto-weed osrs‚Äù will get you to the same place. There‚Äôs another comment in this thread that mentions Tithe farm.
---
Ah! You're a genius! Also farming Zalcano all day every day
---
It's the same reason as bots are bad.  
---
&gt; they do not directly affect any new player not buying gold or killing green drags.
---
Right, so the problem is players that want to kill green drags, or any other relatively profitable, low-skill requirement activity.  They get swarmed by both bots and gold farmers and it becomes much less viable for normal players, which reduces the overall game quality by lowering the amount of viable activities.  It disproportionately affects newer players, because they are the ones competing with bots and gold farmers. Nothing personal against gold farmers, but they're bad for normal players except for higher-tier players that want cheap raw resources.
---
Where does it say menu entry swapper is bannable
---
I feel like as long as your mindset isn‚Äôt xp oriented, it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable. I needed lvl 55 (from 50) for fremmenik exiles and crafting natures, while it was slow, yielded a good amount of gold (about 7k worth of nature runes)
---
No it's not
---
Bots make up 7-9% of the playerbase
---
Don‚Äôt forget arceus library as well
---
Well it will always depends on your opponent's defense, so you can only find best DPS toward a particular enemy.
---
You're reading it correctly then lol
---
I finished SotE at 85 cb with lvl 60 cb stats. Never made tons of money or did NMZ so don't always have a better alternative.
---
I rarely use it, but when I do it's when I don't have faith in what I'm doing lol. Or to save face from death penalties.
---
kek
---
I was kidding lol. Learn to take a joke.
---
Current team would take 2 years to get started and then an additional 4 to get the beta release out. Good luck on that.
---
cant find any use for this comment, delete it please!
---
I feel you man, I did lavas, ZMI, cosmics, I tried it all and I'm still only 74. Those last 3 levels can smd, I'm doing ToG until 77 at this point.
---
Smart move, was about to quit the game if they actually banned third party clients. On the other hand, I should‚Äôve made use and grinded out 99 Thieving/Prayer while had the chance, but not a big deal tbh.
---
If osbuddy delays the players clicks it will be detected as botting eventually.
---
how are menu entry swappers undetectable?
---
Such reality we live in today
---
Text summary for a working man, please?
---
I'm not sure if you're seeing the gravity of that situation...
---
Keep doing it
---
You forgot the /s
---
I enjoy how this punishes streamers who have gotten nothing but special treatment for years, but I dislike that we'll have to use RL forks to continue using plugins that were harmless. Anything they say today is unenforceable and undetectable. I see no reason for a dev to willingly remove these features, so we're going to have a lot of people start flocking to shady clients if RL removes too much QOL.
---
All Jagex's response does is guarantee a decline in RL and OSB use, and we'll slowly start to get more competing clients, and eventually a new "Big Two".
---
What confusion?
---
They said don‚Äôt use the op plugins introduced by OSbuddy recently (pertaining to one click thief, pray, construction), and don‚Äôt use zulrah prediction overlays.
---
If you do, you can be banned. Sounds like a straight forward statement to me.
---
What the fuck are you talking about. I used OSB for years and then switched to Runelite like 2 years ago. Why do you think I‚Äôm anti-3pc? Are you stupid?
---
Yeah you definitely have vision problems, that's for damn sure.
---
But most polls that aren't pvp updates pass
---
Well if they only work on a C++ client, no backend stuff, that would be similar to making the client for mobile and should take a similar or faster development time. They could outsource it like they did the mobile client too. Might not be worth it for Jagex though since a new client isn't really going to attract new players.
---
Yes! Make acorns great again
---
I agree. They already added in the "Deposit/Withdraw X" customization to the last set value and that's standard now.
---
They repoll things after making some adjustments that would maybe appeal to more players. They don't do the same exact poll again, they're not insane
---
osbuddy used to be great bot site for rs, untill they leaked database to jagex, to avoid getting sued.
---
quantum computing be like
---
No thanks, I like to play videogames, not black friday sims
---
I wish they would of clarified the "overlay" features that i've come to love... i have bad vision and it's complete hell trying to click on agility obstacles. Also i've never done vorkath, but why would overlays showing you where attacks are going to "land" be outlawed? Are you just supposed to guess where shits gonna land and hope you get lucky?
---
The only thing this statement has done is raise even more questions about 3rd party clients...
---
idk, the best thing RuneLite offers for me is the hw acceleration
---
That they're not enforcing it.
---
so is this the "warning" for those op osbuddy plugins? Can we use them or will users who use them be banned? Will osbuddy be forced to remove them, can they actually track the menu swapper already? So confused about what this post is actually saying.
---
Grand exchange is one that comes to mind,
---
even though it was good for the community as a whole, it was a straight re-poll.
---
This is a nothing blog post. They literally have not added a single clarifying point. What menu swappers are considered too op? Is it ok for me to have a menu swapper option for pickpocketing? Can I keep a menu swapper for bones to avoid burying them?
---
Deters a few maybe. Many people's default response to this is "lolno". I see an explosion in popularity of RuneLite forks going forward.
---
Ground items bypasses the gameplay mechanic of right clicking on a loot pile but they're allowing it anyways
---
Jagex either has to go scorched earth or let it all; they can‚Äôt police the clients when they can barely police their own game
---
ye ok fair enough
---
I'm leaving it on. Can't even left-click a banker? Fuck off with that ancient mechanic.
---
Will really miss you. You've always been the most welcoming to listen to on qa streams. Thanks for everything.
---
t. regular user of what Jagex considers bannable AHK
---
Agility + porn
---
You raised a bunch of points but glossed over the biggest one in that this statement didn‚Äôt clarify anything. Are 3PCs ok? I still don‚Äôt know.
---
&gt; You really think Jagex is going to ruin their main source of income with some shit like that?
---
*Cough* Spin of fortune *cough* removal of trade *cough* Evolution of combat *cough cough*
---
DPS=/=Burst Damage
---
Surely they arent stupid enough to make the same mistake twice
---
Why is ibans staff preferable to my normal armor?  It's counterintuitive because I have decent combat stats and would assume that it would be more profitable to use my best skills
---
Like bots do not have to have perfect behavioral patterns, you can code in imperfections, delays, and randomness.
---
You could make a bot that's indistinguishable from a human player if you were okay with 95% efficiency instead of 100%.
---
It's the same account, just changed the @
---
Menu Entry Swapper is definitely worth the ban since a lot of people won't even bother playing without it. Who cares if you get banned if you were going to quit without it anyway?
---
**Protip:** MES is undetectable and new rules regarding it fundamentally unenforceable. If RL ditches it, it's 100% safe to use on RuneLite forks going forward until they do engine work (lol).
---
The plugin doesn't even tell you what you don't already know, it's not like it tells you in advance.
---
Lol dude
---
You're the problem
---
You make excuses for being shitty to people and say "well it's not toxic if I have a reason"
---
There's no reason to be shitty to another human, period. Especially a fucking video game.
---
You're completely dodging/missing the point.
---
Sorry... I thought the /s was implied
---
I'm not saying it would be as good, but a lot of people were hoping for an announcement they would at least work on the base features and optimization at the minimum.
---
The fact idiots like you are saying this kind of ultra stupid shit is why no statement would have been better than a statement this vague.
---
Too late kid, Jagex are already on their way
---
Haha, I feel you dude. Nostalgia is blasting off. Good for you mate!
---
Yes
---
LOL no it isn't.
---
Long as it isn't perfect it's practically the same as a human player doing it.
---
The rainbow scarf is still my favorite cosmetic item! Thank you for all you've done
---
The blackjacking plugin doesn‚Äôt allow you to get more exp then what you can get by yourself with practice. Going for 99 thieving on my Ironman I had the clicks down to where I nearly never missed a tick by the end of the grind. If the exp rate is achievable without plugins you can‚Äôt really go around banning people for hitting some arbitrary exp limit due to the possibility of false positives.
---
Correct, but seeing as they didn't announce anything, which is really what I meant, I doubt they will even bother even optimizing it. Which is what a large majority want.
---
You can blackjack normally and achieve exactly the same rates.
---
It's not against the rules to be really efficient. If they ban on experience rates alone, there's a certainty that innocent people will get banned because they're good at the game.
---
The only way you're getting banned for the blackjacking plugin is if they can detect that you aren't right clicking with the inputs, and it seems like the jury is still out on whether they can detect this.
---
&gt;If the original client can't do it, then it's bannable
---
That would literally mean 3rd party clients are fully banned. They arent, and you're insanely stupid.
---
The GPU is more locked down on Macs, so they haven't been able to get it working yet.
---
You‚Äôre baby raging over having to click one extra time, while still getting upwards of ~900k xp/hr using best method. Grow up.
---
Pkers have a much highe chance of running into a toxic player
---
Yes there's toxic players on both sides(just as there's nice pkers there's toxic pvmers)  but for every toxic pvmer there's 10 toxic pkers.
---
There's a reason pkers have gained this negative connotation. It didn't come out of no where.
---
Genius.
---
Just watch the guide. It's very helpful. You literally shred through their defence. Sometimes you hid harder using right combat style regardless of your stats
---
so u claim, there was nothing to do at jagex. soulds like dream workplace for many lazy neets. Doubt it
---
What about the dream world bridge? I got so angry at that one.
---
I'd argue that they're doing **no** harm to the game. If you're not botting, and you're not farming the gold to sell, who gives a fuck?
---
Prifddinas Agility Course on mobile while at work.
---
Pretty aggressive for someone so wrong. Feel bad for you brother, hope life turns upward for you.
---
There's a table on the OSRS Wiki - Motherlode Mine.
---
Ultimately the plugin is useful for learning the flow of the fight but after a few hundred kc it doesn‚Äôt change anything.
---
It‚Äôs just a different way to interpret the information you‚Äôre already getting. It‚Äôs the definition of QoL.
---
honestly without the defence minus xp lamp. if they remove my runelite plug in that allows me to remove def option im not playing on my pure till theres another solution. its just too risky
---
Ok then the times they do straight repoll it's because they believe it has a chance at passing after explaining their thought process behind it. They don't do the same pitch though
---
Theres a difference between hoping and dreaming. Jagex aren't going to spend time and money to make a better client until they absolutely have to.
---
They'd have to rebuild the game from scratch.  
---
And then convert the old player files to the new format.  
---
And also they'd lose the "engine work" excuse.
---
It's definitely doable. They have all the assets and numbers, so all they need is coding, even using an existing engine like Unity.  
---
But coding all the content will be a long process. It wouldn't take much time to get stuff like combat (with all the weapons and animations, prayers, weird interactions), skills (fishing, cooking, crafting), and other basics up and running, but then each piece of content would take time to port. If each quest would require a week to code, that's a long time before the game would be 100% ready.
---
Yeah that new hcim death was totally deliberate. He went on livestream for once, he never does that. Easy cash grab, easy new drama to promote his brand. Reaction was lame.
---
Does the same thing all the time.
---
Jagex just released a statement today telling you what's ban worthy and what isn't.    
---
And Runelite is open source, you or someone who understands code can look at it and determine whether it is safe or not (spoiler: it's fine)
---
No i didn't
---
nobody? i dont think you understand some of the players of this game lmao
---
I know I know. You can have it as exciting as you want. Just learn to use your left hand either to click or you know
---
!remindme 5 months
---
Yuuuup scout bots are such bs
---
Risk anything at all and a 10man team logs on you
---
That's the real reason for the norisk in the wild
---
Does anybody know how the devs plan to buff basilisk knights? Will it be an attack power increase, def increase, or a mechanic? Also, when will these changes go into effect?
---
I dont get why people dont just right click. But this is fine too
---
That would be the best call to stay within good standing with JaGex. 
---
People who go around that and use the plugins anyway (if they‚Äôre even detectable) would be subject to being banned, and that makes sense.
---
Either way all of these quittings came after warding failed, wolf being the most outspoken. And the did grow the staff from 25 to 30 in the past year only to produce less intensive content than the previous 2 years which saw a raid every year and multiple grandmasters not to mention 4 dmms and other competitions in between.
---
Back in my day botting meant turning a robot on and leaving your computer. Now because clicks are simpler it's magically botting? When Jagex put in Make All, was that Jagex implementing botting?
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't think what these plugins are doing is right. Construction and FM should've always been done the way OSB is doing them IMO, but the change should be polled and implemented by Jagex.
---
Jesus christ. Today, I am thankful that ordering a pizza takes me 2 minutes instead of 32. Best of luck to ya in working through your shit, we've all got something!
---
That explains why OP showed pictures with the reason and 2 other mutes seems like thats evidence to me, I could just proceed to ask why he was muted before that but since theres about 6 years in between those mutes figured something was wrong.
---
Consider trying to use the couple braincells you have.
---
Them not giving evidence on bot bans is normal, not mutes.
---
"why are you on this sub if you don't play"?
---
TLDR: vote yes for polls
---
Killing the other player could be faster than forfeiting if you get good hits with claws/g maul etc.
---
ü¶Ä
---
They absolutely cannot know. The overlays do not send any additional information to the actual client/server. I wish more people knew this, because the statement is actually an embarrassment for jagex. They're banking on 70% of the playerbase not knowing how overlays work, and they themselves know its a completely empty threat. It's an incredibly Jagex move.
---
People who want to macro without being banned
---
Alpha move
---
Lol you're still here a week later? Pathetic
---
Because Jagex immediately vetoed those plugins before RL could even make them, whereas they haven't mentioned gorillas once in 2.5 years.  If the devs understand the difference, then you should too.  Gorillas plugin is a decent learning tool but almost entirely irrelevant past several hundred kc.  The TOB and zuk cheat clients improve the speed and efficiency even for experienced players.
---
why do people love mod wolf so much? Not trying to be rude, but what did he contribute to the game? I really don't place him high in my mod rankings.
---
No one is gunna get banned for shit tho.
---
Looks like a fraction to me
---
Since when were macros not bannable, again? 
---
Up until now the only information we had was that these plug in broke long standing rules and that you were only to use them at your own risk.
---
It literally highlights the tile an NPC will spawn on, with a timer showing when it will spawn. You‚Äôre terrible at loopholing.
---
Tbh I like it that way, brings back hardcore nostalgia vibes
---
OSB coded the bot-detection, I doubt anyone's going to be getting banned.

SWAMP MAN GOOD

My original account was perm banned for 10+ years after being muted too much for shit-talking, so I appealed and basically explained that I was an annoying little shit and times change, and they unbanned it.

Well yeah, but a new player is better off crafting natures and getting xp at the same time slowly progressing towards 75 rc than to run bones for someone for a mil an hour and gaining 0 xp

The RCB grind actually finished. Congrats dude!

The next step is gonna be crazy

aww you didn't keep the sceptre

that cinematic shot at the end of you on the balcony and overlooking morytania was nice though!

Also the length of a jagex employee staying is not long. I'm surprised some stayed so many years, I believe the employee burnout is 3 years. 
---
I'm sure they'd leave for a good amount, we're all human and need it sadly.
---
I mean if we keep this trend going of 3pc being allowed to do whatever they want the game is gonna die which is not in Jagex' favour either. This post is a completely empty statement since they can't detect half the plugins mentioned.

Dont worry you can still train slayer all day ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

I will upvote you, my good sir.

I personally have never done demonic gorillas, I'm a filthy casual. But I will say that the only plug ins I ever use on runelite are the skill calculators, having friends names above their heads to spot them easier, and I use that plug in that shows the items on the ground. Not sure why you would need much more than that.

On a windows machine, it gives way better rendering including a fog so it feels less like a random square chunk.

On a Mac it works like one of those boxes with a switch on it that as soon as you hit it a little cat paw comes out of the box and turns it off.

The list is arbitrary

If this subreddit over the last week is anything to go by, all you need to do is create an OSRS council for everyone who sweats while sitting. That group of people gets to decide what goes in the game client-wise.

I think you accidentally left out part of your comment. UI scaling on the vanilla client is too small, I was hoping there was a way to fix it.

What I got from it was use your better judgement. If your judgement can‚Äôt draw conclusions from the examples they‚Äôve outlined, then don‚Äôt use third party clients (read: you‚Äôre too stupid to read between the lines).
---
Fucking boba fett that shit
---
Black t face shield instead of open?
---
They said in their last 3rd party client statement that they wouldn't ban people for using these clients without prior warning. I'd consider this post a pretty clear warning, so continued use of the new osb plugins probably will get people banned moving forwards
---
If glassdoor is to be believed, their senior programmers are making half of what guys right out of college are making at my company.
---
Saying they will ban people for using unacceptable features, but only naming a few of them is not a good move. They should make compile an extensive list so that the clients can remove them ASAP and prevent bans from occurring.... this was a terrible statement imo.
---
Bruh did you really just put a bunch of xp progress bars up lmaoüòÇ

You can do this at grand exchange as well. The booths in front of the bankers will bank, the ones in front of the exchange people will open g.e.

I can get not being able to play for extended periods of time per day, but unfortunately that's life. I can attest to this.

I don't think the game's integrity should be changed because it doesn't fit people's lifestyles.

sad to see ya go Mod Wolf! was a pleasure playing the content you developed!

Jagex most definitely records mouse movements. That has always been one of the biggest hurdles when trying to overcome bot detection. However since mobile release having no mouse movement at all doesn't look so suspicious.

Mouse movement and click position is most definitely recorded and analyzed.

If there isn't 10 BIS items every 3 months then the game is dying. It's not like the "high level pvmers" make up a minority of the community. No, the game isn't dying because there is no new interesting content like skills, minigames, constant quests or anything. It's definitely because raids 3 hasn't been released yet with twisted bow 2. 
---
Don't worry your pretty little head /u/saltmore1 raids 3 will definitely be announced at runefest and will be the final blow to the future of OSRS.

Holy shit what an episode lol.

That's just a straight up lie because I did the Hero's Quest like a month ago and it was extremely easy to find a partner (also for free). Saw a lot of other people getting partners for it too

Should be a statue of Swamp man in the Smithsonian this man is a national treasure.

Even that was at the beginning of the year.  Also, most people I know don't even bother with hydra because it isn't a team boss.  Team-based pvm content is the future of the game.

I think that might be for space to put ads which you used to have in the f2p client.

1. Make sure the new BIS requires the old BIS to make.

2. Be willing to universally buff the HP/attack of all monsters in the game to combat powercreep.

The worst part of these videos is when they end.

You can use Glassdoor reviews with a grain of salt. There are several reviewing organizations - including Amazon and Google - that at their onset did not have systems to curate false reviews.
---
Amazon and Google still suffer from this extensively - the bar to entry for how to produce fraudulent reviews is, however, much higher.
---
To say that they're baseless is to suggest that all of the reviews are fraudulent. 
---
To correlate *openings* for the position (which is different from a review of the company) with employee activity and public discussion is a completely different animal. Simply saying "Glassdoor has some fake reviews" is not sufficient in any quantitative sense to dismiss the relevance.
---
You wouldn't download a car

To add to this, I believe it is also due to the fact that they only animated 1/4 of the wheel spinning and looped it. I don't believe the animation smoothing would have this effect if they were to fully animate a 360 degree turn

Quite the apocalyptic attitude. Player activity fluctuates based on updates and time of year. Let's not pretend to know why the jmods are leaving. There are plenty of people that can fill those shoes. If you don't want this game to die then I would refrain from posts like this that perpetuate the fantasy that this game is dying. There is nowhere near enough evidence to suggest that with any confidence. Aside from 3pc drama I think the game is in a really good place considering how outdated it is.

I also explained that I have grown up a lot since my mute, but it felt like I got a automated reply.

You might want to take a look at the article and see which plugins they are reffering to

My response to that response: YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME NOW
---
Dude - same, kinda. I haven't tried OSRS, but when I was trying to get on RS3 to buy some bonds with leftover GPs from pre-eoc, it kept crashing over and over and over. Eventually I just gave up.
---
Honestly as someone who has put in a lot of hours to perfect moves like this its actually a compliment when someone says this. The funny thing is that i could get mocked for the the gmaul being slow. I get it a lot at LMS, mostly that i'm using a bot on my overhead prayers. 
---
I've got a few videos where you can track my progression since coming back to the game: 
---

---
No more right clicking to trade Oziach.
---
I used it when I was doing pyramid plunder.
---
6 hour man mode?
---
That would be client-sided, so not necessarily something they would collect data on.
---
My boys were crippling the hand so many times it was actually frustrating haha
---
Pretty sure most if not all forms of menu swapping isn't allowed now. If it saves a click or two over using the regular client you can't use it. I doubt they'll take action against it right away. Most people use menu swapping plugins without even realizing it.
---
Sure lmao
---
You lucky boy. Then again when I was a f2p noob some guy world hopped next to me, got chatting then traded me. Full rune trim and various rune weapons and 100k. I'd love to hear from him again. I was the noob at varrock west bank killing guards.
---
This did announce something. They announced a lot of the changes players would like to see that are available in 3pc are made difficult by their client being Java. They can combat this by working on a C++ version but they don‚Äôt see it as necessary since the amount of $$$ and work would offset other projects greatly while we have 3pc that already solve the issue.
---
Why remake your game if you‚Äôve already said you‚Äôre not banning 3pc that solve the issue?? If they were banning 3pc then they‚Äôd probably move forward with an overhaul into C++ but that‚Äôs not the case as 3pc are still around and solve the issue for most people
---
Maybe I'm just used to it; I also have a 1440p screen on my laptop, but it's 13-inch. 100% is unreadable unless I sit a few inches from the screen, but it defaults to 200% on Windows, macOS, and Linux which looks fine. I can't imagine 100% on a 27-inch screen.
---
No one is being punished though? These plugins are all client-side, and no action could be taken against them. Hell, you can continue using these features on RuneLite forks without fear of a ban.
---
Cerberus, gorillas, menu entry swapper all come to mind
---
I read that with emphasis on the and... there are plug-ins that dynamically tell you exactly where to go and what to pray. 
---
Notice they didn‚Äôt say no tile markers for inferno, which has notoriously been monitored to not allow easier clears. If they just meant no tile markers, then inferno would have been the better example to use.
---
Top tier. Thank you
---
thot\*
---
I have 5 pets in like 20kc this is not where I wanna use my rng man
---
Still not RS3
---
I'd say everything seems like cheating but they have allowed it to happen for a long time now. It's like letting your children be disrespectful to you for a long time and then all of a sudden you want respect. Jagex is in a difficult position. Using these plugins is like using bots. The #1 reason for people not to bot is because of fear. Update your terms and make it clear what kind of plugins are allowed or not. People will still cheat but at least those of us who are honest and follow the rules will have some philosophy to follow.
---
I'm not disputing that but from a group that above all wants clarity, the whitelist of plugins is the way to go. If they can't detect them that's another debate. But a whitelist at least clearly states that if it isn't one of these plugins, it had to get cleared first. Yes people will circumnavigate, it's RuneScape, they always will. But at least this would have clarity on the subject
---
pray melee and eat between the hits. The hits aren't on the same tick, otherwise every high risk fight would be rng lol.
---
That's why the game loads in sections, to put all that stuff client side.
---
I only come on to raid with friends cox and tob so no I don't think raids killed the game.  In fact, I think they're the only good MMO aspect of the game left.  Seeing all my friends using cheat clients to do tob because it was meta is what killed raids 2 for me.  If they won't address op plugins then raids 3 will be destroyed as well.
---
can u pls come back
---
The King.
---
Did you make this account? What were the original intentions? Lol
---
Maybe if they spent less time developing ways to detect players using 3pc plugins they deem as not allowed and more time developing their own 3pc/adding to their vanilla client, we wouldn‚Äôt have the issue we‚Äôre having now.
---
It's against the rules. If they haven't specifically pointed out the bad plugin, I think it falls under a grey area. Apparently all this is not something the game can detect anyway, so I'm assuming the plugins are and will continue to be used.  
---
But yes, you can be banned.
---
Poll all the client features. "Ban" (undetectable, symbolic ban only) the ones that don't hit 75%, ignore the rest.
---
Those squares are squares you put yourself, you have to know what square to go to at what phase. They are only marked for reference. Jagex are referring to clients that you just walk to in zulrah fight. It tells you what gear to put on, what to pray, and where to stand. You wouldn‚Äôt need any skill or prior knowledge or memory skills if you used that client.
---
seethe
---
I gave away 100k to somebody I was chatting with mining today! She said she only had 12k and was level 40 so I was like bless up. I think the people over level 100 usually just have so much money they don‚Äôt mind giving stuff away because they remember being a noob too. I‚Äôm in a weird place because it‚Äôs been ten years since I‚Äôve played and I still have to ask ppl for help sometimes but they‚Äôve been wonderful :) it‚Äôs just so different than I remember
---
Unhappy people don't like seeing other people being happy
---
That's unfortunate. I should update runelite now, then stop updating it after that lol
---
I agree. I remember the time the client was basic and simple. Some features are qol, others are devaluing the point of the game
---
Lucky for the most part, still plenty of scammers though. The community in-game is generally friendly but the Reddit community is incredibly toxic. 
---
People for and against 3rd party clients, people for and against power creep, people for and against keeping oldschool oldschool, people for and against QOL changes, people for and against PVP changes, etc. The problem with these arguments is that they end up in screaming matches of people who believe that they are 100% right and the opposition is an idiot and it ends up leaving everyone in a foul mood.
---
okay nibber slitter
---
&gt; who gives a fuck?
---
Sweaty nerds that think a plugin telling them to 'stand here, pray this' devalues the time they spent memorising a guide that says 'stand here, pray this' as if any of these early end game bosses had any actual mechanics. There's websites that will do exactly what the Zulrah plugin does with the only additional thing the user needs to do is mark the tiles to stand on Runelite and click the website every time the phase changes, it'll even do TTS just like the plugin. 
---
Hell, Vorkath's mechanics are so trivial that you'll end up learning more mechanics for the quest itself especially if you've never done Mithril/Adamant/Rune dragons before. The hardest part of farming Vorkath is having a stable enough connection that you don't get smacked during the barrage phase you missed a tick window, it's honestly amazing that any body even needs to use these plugins never mind complain about them as if they're essentially macro tools that destroy game integrity. Same story with clue scrolls, people have been using solution pages from tip.it since 2004 yet automatic solvers for children's sliding puzzles is a pressing issue over the thousands of smithing bots, Zulrah bots, etc?
---
I can understand the disdain against the one click sacrifice/burn/build/etc and the blackjack plugins since those feel like blatant macroing and Jagex have always had incredibly strict rules against macroing, it seems a little unfair that a player would quickly get banned for using something like AHK yet Jagex are essentially saying here that they don't care about the third party clients offering the same functionality with much better XP rates and it's still down to the players to not use the clients or risk getting banned. They were willing to take legal action over Runelite if they didn't remove the Zulrah plugins but OSB gets a free pass here? Something doesn't add up.
---
The most insulting thing out of all of this is that the blackjacking situation could easily be fixed and nobody would feel cheated out of anything. Runelite already de-prioritises the 'Talk-to' option for some NPCs you can pickpocket (like men/women) and it seems like Jagex has no issue with this plugin, if you do the same for Bandits you get right click knock-out into left click pickpocket, and if you prioritise knock-out over pickpocket while the bandit is still conscious you get left click for both actions. Contrast to right click into knockout, right click into pickpocket on the stock client. The solution? Nerf XP rates to account for the increased efficiency of turning 3 right clicks and 3 left clicks into just 3 left clicks. Boom, ardy knights in the desert, and nobody is upset since nobody has legitimately done blackjacking for more than 15 minutes since they were released in 2005 since it's such awful content.
---
&gt;most people used it to drop stuff easily
---
[AHK was used for a lot more than dropping stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5rz3ob/this_is_why_ahk_is_banned/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) keep in mind this vid is two years old, this is nothing new

this was the best 20 minute bathroom break ive taken at work
---
Ehh, we've still got a bit. The smithing grind will take awhile, along with the supplies to go with it. Plus he could do 100 attempts and decide "this is too hard, I need more items from the S-list/better pots from herblore". I'd say we have a minimum of 4 episodes
---
I use it quite regularly cleaning fossils, when I forget my rake for sulliceps, etc
---
PSA: Clue helpers have existed since 2004, in the form of an overlayed program, called Swiftkit.
---
PSA2: The OFFICIAL OSRS Wiki, hosted by Jagex, funded by Jagex, has EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE clue answer on (puzzles are piss easy). 
---
PSA3: You're literally able to set timers on just about any device, everyone knows how long herbs/trees etc take to grow (also readily available on the wiki), set a timer, come back after timer finishes. 
---
The way some people go on is like these little plugins are game breaking that every single person playing Runescape don't already have easy access to - even mobile players can switch app to open the Wiki.
---
You're good to go with literally any plugin as long as you aren't a streamer live streaming the rule breaking plugins. They're all undetectable client-side plugins that don't send packets to the server anyway.
---
...no it wouldn't, and whenever people find a bug to do it in 1 tick, Jagex removes it. The gmaul comes after the ags, at max speed it is spread over 2 ticks, which means you can react to the ags and pray melee, eat, switch gear, etc.
---
oh my, i forgot all about netscape navigator. pretty sure I had every memory of that completely blocked before you dredged it back up, jerk
---
Imagine targeting 3rd party clients where people are using farming timers and not literal bot farms.
---
So close, yet so far
---
Could be fixed by just letting you join both gangs
---
Ah that‚Äôs disappointing to hear. This subreddit inspired me to get back to it. I‚Äôve been having so much fun. I‚Äôll definitely be on the lookout for scammers, thanks for the insight üíú
---
I have them in a row I got them in the bank still
---
I personally find static entry swaps mostly fine, although the statement from jagex seems quite clear to me that no entry swaps are acceptable. I personally even find the left click construction plugin acceptable just because of how significantly it reduces XP rates because it forces you to miss crucial ticks. Of the static entry swaps I'd say only the left click use bone swap has any impact on the difficulty of training skills, everything else is just a convenience. I'd still prefer the bone menu entry swap was allowed, but if any of the static swaps push the line, it's that one. HAM pickpocket is also quite strong but doesn't really have significant impact on the game like training prayer does.
---
I absolutely love menu entry swaps, but I dislike how they can be used to justify none 1:1 inputs. If I was managing a public client I would remove all swaps because the jagex statement seems absolutely clear to me regarding entry swapping specifically.
---
The problem with their statement is that if you interpret it literally then there are a few other plugins that they might not be okay with. GPU plugin increases render distance which allows extended walk ranges which arguably changes inputs, but I can see an argument that this is just a client limitation rather than abuse. I imagine jagex would agree with that sentiment. Shift anti drag definitely falls under this category, as does custom shift key swaps, world hopper, entity hider, and dead NPC hiding plugins.
---
If I was maintaining a client I would ask for clarification about the mentioned plugins and remove menu entry swaps along with all other blatant none 1:1 input plugins (the osbuddy ones specifically). Skilling is going to be very painful again without ahk if custom shift click options get removed, but I can't see how that plugin doesn't violate their rules.
---
They clearly had an internal meeting to discuss this, which is why it was delayed.  I seriously doubt it was delayed because they wanted to put on a show.  The OSRS team is way more open and communicative than any other gaming company I've ever seen.  The community as a whole should appreciate that more.
---
They very well could have banned 3rd party clients.  The decided not to, and for good reason.  But they did mention some features that were unacceptable as some plugins ruin the intent of the developers.  Just as they've done in the past with Runelite.  I imagine these features will also be removed from runelite and not used by whoever wants to comply in the interest of fairness.  I also doubt this is the last we're going to hear regarding the issue.
---
No, it does not solve the problem entirely.  It's a complicated issue; they can't detect overlays on the user's side.  Perhaps they have other measures planned in order to detect unfair plugin use, like they do with account sharing.  Maybe they don't.
---
But what exactly did you want them to do? I have a feeling that you guys would be freaking out just the same if they flat out banned 3rd party clients.
---
Good to know! The upper 90s for stats has always seemed so impossible to me! After 80 str probably gonna focus on range, using a ballista seems fun
---
&gt;Features which tell you where Vorkath‚Äôs attacks might land.
---
&gt;Features which tell you where to stand to avoid Zulrah‚Äôs attacks, and what protection prayers to activate.
---
&gt;Features which tell you what the next Demonic gorillas attack will be.
---
If you're assuming that these plugins are macros then I'm sorry but you're wrong. Either way, now it has been made clear that using the features listed on the blog will result in a ban if caught - if you still insist on nitpicking whether people already knew this or not I'd suggest going back to a time before osrs conception that you're so familiar with and staying there?
---
I don't see any confusion. The normies on RuneLite and OSBuddy get nerfed clients. The rest of us who know about RuneLite forks and other small private clients can continue enjoying whatever plugins we want since they are all undetectable client-side plugins that don't send packets to the server.
---
there's a difference between being game breaking and being an insane QOL.
---
You spoiled it on twitter
---
Not sure you read my post at all? I didn't say the blackjacking was QOL I meant like 1 click travel on boats and 1 click jewelry menus
---
Okay...so let me understand this...they "can" ban you for shit they can't detect lol? Wow this is just a big ol nothing sandwich, nothing changed
---
You‚Äôre horribly uneducated on the matter. Runelite was built ground up with all the QOL in mind. It was built to do what it does. OSRS is an ANCIENT client that was built years ago not even thinking it would reach the point it‚Äôs at now. 
---
‚ÄúJuSt sTaRt UpDaTiNg iT tHo!!!‚Äù It‚Äôs not that fucking easy. They aren‚Äôt banning use of 3pc, using a 3pc solves 99% of players issues with the client, so why would any company voluntarily sink tons of money and time to put off other content updates just to replace 3pc?
---
‚ÄúNot doing jack shit with their client‚Äù do you really believe they‚Äôve done nothing to runescape for years? They‚Äôve focused on content over client because 3pc solves the client issue. There‚Äôs so much that tiny team does for this game and it goes unappreciated by twats like you who don‚Äôt see what they want
---
Yes. Overlay, therefore banned.
---
Yeah keep dreaming buddy, you can literally record a person's click pattern over a long amount of time and then replay samples of it. So, how can the server tell there is botting when the clicking is literally how a human would click?
---
Well, for once I'm happy with what Jagex came up with. Happens occasionally.
---
I heartily endorse this event or product
---
RuneScape is java-based and java applets are pretty much dead. Chrome doesn't support them, Firefox doesn't support them, Microsoft Edge never supported them.
---
Move your house there
---
Oh if this ain‚Äôt OC I‚Äôll pull it down
---
Players that liked bots because they made things like resources and zulrah scales cheaper
---
It was mine though when I said QOL tho. This person seemed to think I was defending any OSB plugins
---
Never really used menu swapper. I tried it but was too used to the normal menus so switched back
---
If I understand right, they only provide a repo for RS3 (NXT client) for Ubuntu.
---
However, that client can be extracted from their official repo and used on other operating systems (I do this with Fedora).
---
Hopefully they'll communicate with us. Menu entry swapper from ge, slayer, and tool leprechauns will be super annoying to not have though. As long as we're allowed those I'd be ok with their stance.
---
Came here to post this.
---
Yeah I'm worried about Adam removing them
---
Me: *bots* 
---
Jagex: christ is watching
---
I hope more people start to realize this. There is no reason to make your OSRS experience intentionally worse while a large number of people continue on like nothing happened.
---
Scythe
---
one input to multiple outputs has been disallowed for quite some time. Like at least since '03 or so.
---
So what's the confusion?
---
This^
---
you think jamflex over the weekend figured out how to detect usage of all those things?XD
---
you should only be worried if you are a streamer
---
Fun fact: Jagex cannot actually detect any overlays (ie, ground markers, demonic gorillas' prayers, boss timers and so on), unless they get every 3rd party client creator to add new code that lets Jagex read what plugins are enabled and aren't enabled, they literally have no way to detect it, so therefore the "banning" of using those features is literal fear mongering. Although I suspect there's a chance they can detect menu entry swapping, especially the 1-click things OSBuddy have.
---
Imagine if there was some higher play going on like making these features to force Jagex to stomp on them so that they are able to claim unemployment insurance or to validate/force bankruptcy.
---
But how can I be banned if they can‚Äôt detect it lol?
---
It's more that I literally dont know what would have been expected. This was pretty much their only option and almost exactly what I expected.
---
If someone is just starting out, how do they know 1) if that's a lot of money or 2) what to even do with it?
---
When he‚Äôs done with this series, nothing will ever satisfy him again.
---
&gt;If someone can't do something as simple as left clicking a banker to access their items, they're just going to Google which client offers this feature and continue on like nothing happened.
---
This is what I'm afraid of. If RL loses the menu entry swapper, people will move to RLP which has all the features Jagex told Adam to remove from RL and then some. So a rule change intended to reduce OP plugin usage will end up increasing it instead
---
Smithing level?
---
Didn‚Äôt even think of that with the construction cape, that is a really good idea
---
one thing i never understood was how come jagex treats this game liek krabby patties? i mean everyone that likes krabby patty go to krusty krab, and there are no alterantive since they are all chum buckets, but why do jagex have to pretend they are also mr krab as well? they can choose to be generous but it seem like they are pinching for penny or thinking about first dime whenever decisions are made. not mad, just upset at the fact they could be spongebob but choose to be mr kraqb
---
Zooming in to 1-click Oak Dungeon doors is probably a no go
---
The Dire Wolf of Morytania is born.
---
If it's more efficient than the game normally allows, yes.
---
Do you have your game sounds on and use F keys?
---
Huh, didn't know that.
---
bet you're fun at events lol. Everyone has their thing, some people like to smoke weed. its better than being an alcoholic imo
---
Fucking zoomers don't even know what Klank's gauntlets are
---
Any thoughts on what he might have planned for the GP?
---
Lmao good thing I got my construction grind outta the way
---
It's a med clue reward. He needs 66 con to store it so he must have been dropping it off screen for days

never once in my life seen it called rmt
---
GPU mode is bypassing a game mechanic, it's Jagexs way of telling you to be careful or you might get banned
---
Yeah that like 8 players are using. Sure if some kid is using full on handheld pvm plugins it isn't really fair, but at least only a very small amount of people have that. Everyone else is using the main client(s) and if something is OP there, it's much more impactful. Cheaters will cheat but some basic regulations on clients will keep these shit storms from happening
---
because theyre literal greedy scum
---
they know exactly what theyre doing
---
runelite won out over them and they cant hack people anymore
---
so they torpedo the whole thing
---
Generally pronouns with a ‚Äú-ough‚Äù at the end are pronounced as ‚Äúuff‚Äù. There are various politicians and famous people with last names like these.

How do some people bank so fast? For example when I was smithing today I noticed players could bank almost instantly, assuming they're depositing + withdrawing more resources (saw same with deposit boxes at MLM) It doesn't seem humanly possible, they do it faster than the bank UI even load up on my screen. Is this the osbuddy stuff everyone is talking about?
---
I'm pretty sure most people wanted a response to osbuddy releasing op plugins for con prayer and blackjacking. They were also talking about one click fire making and 1 click dats.
---
Looks like he just got a tbow and on his way to 99 range
---
A way I like to look at it is - Damn, I wonder what he comes up with next
---
What‚Äôs the story here? Hacked and someone botted your acc? 
---
Like the other commenter said take precautions to protect it. Grats dude
---
Only if i wont regret it
---
From what I've seen in the last week most people are upset about the OSB macros. 
---
Sure, full on cheat clients aren't ok, but not many use them and much more widely available plugins are a bigger current issue.
---
Body male ideal?
---
Hey ur getting xp too fast! Banned.
---
This happened to me recently. I think I restarted my computer and it fixed it. Classic turn it off and back on again
---
/u/SettledRS
---
any leaks?
---
That is how I have been seeing things as well. This is a pretty important/expensive room, that could take iron men years to complete. While this did not occur an iron man account, i still feel like this is something important and should be looked into. 
---
Not sure if the jar issue was related, i either had the Sarachnis or Slotizo jar in at the time. Fairly certain it was Sarachnis. Which i know is one of the more recent additions to the display case. 
---
Could be some weird combo of things occurred that is rare, since so far i am the only one i have seen with this bug/issue. Hopefully the mods will take a look and be able to do something
---
You can respawn in prif? How?
---
Imo menu entry swaps are major QOL and it was a mistake jagex goes against it.
---
I think they also tend to avoid spawning on the same tile if another monster is occupying the one they would spawn if they can.
---
I wanna see far more 'scape shenanigans next year, start planning that totem!
---
Who has a better story than Handsomenub?

Return of wilderness is a known scammer from years ago

That *can't* be a coincidence.
---
Relatable.
---
I use a crystal bow to tag the healers, 10 range and doesnt require ammo.
---
They‚Äôre obviously different and you weren‚Äôt defending osb lol. I‚Äôm not sure I get how people equate them
---
Tbh, all these "I got banned" posts I see on Reddit are these little snakes using a fork or a cheat client
---
Fuck em. You don't wanna get banned? Don't cheat. You get banned after years? Too bad kiddo.
---
I ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù when people pk me at wildy agility course cause like... really, why? haha
---
‚ÄúOh cool, you got a few energy pots and a couple potatoes with cheese.‚Äù
---
Seems like a waste of time imo
---
it isn't jagexs way of telling me though because it doesn't happen to everyone else. also what game mechanic is it passing? not being able to see very far?
---
ive tried that and much more and it still doesnt work
---
That‚Äôs what people said 10 years ago. Yet here we are.
---
There's nobody out there trying to afk inferno lmao.
---
Since these things are so easily done with other methods then it's not a big deal if then gone surely.
---
GPU scaling is banned under Jagexs logic.   
---
You're able to move further, thus using less clicks. Less clicks = ban
---
Nice! I got 3kc unsired today and got the head üòëüòëüòë gz on pet
---
If you could get hacked just for seeing a username then every dude at the GE with a t bow would be hacked
---
I think by his own rules, he would've left Morytania to get a net, as he did on two other occasions where it was absolutely necessary to make any progress at all.
---
Somebody who shouldn't be able to consistently kill Zulrah can consistently kill Zulrah with this crutch, and is now flooding the market with drops making my kills worth less.
---
Yeah, this means nothing until we've seen it enforced lol
---
Bought one for 700k. No matter the cost!
---
I disagree. It doesn‚Äôt predict the next attack. It only changes when the next attack is melee/range or melee/mage and it only changes when the demon has room to move and doesn‚Äôt (range/mage) or does (melee). If you‚Äôre standing next to it the overhead indicator won‚Äôt change until the attack happens. It‚Äôs nothing you can‚Äôt determine on your own.
---
If you have the time, grind a new ironman account while you afk on your main. That way you can practice on your main in better gear to the point where you‚Äôre proficient enough to welfare it on ironman account
---
It's not QoL, it's blatant cheating, if you just wanna spam left click you could go to Knights which are balanced around that. The only one that's arguably QoL is Construction because the same left click only method already existed before menu entry swapper.
---
No they are not activated by default, so just don't enable them and you should be good. "should" being the key word here lol.
---
Yeah I think so. He does a good job of explaining exactly why he's doing what he's doing.
---
Could I please get a link to the official statement?
---
3PC are fine to use. The plugins they listed aren‚Äôt.
---
Which part is confusing?
---
Shut the fuck uping?
---
Iiiiii don‚Äôt think you understand lol. These things you claim that are ‚ÄúEASILY‚Äù detectable are in fact not easily detectable at all. That‚Äôs literally the biggest part of the problem. 
---
Also, overlays don‚Äôt send anything to the server at all.
---
I liked menu swapper mostly for fairy rings, just made things more convenient. But that kinda stuff doesn't give you a major advantage. However the pickpocket swap is the only really broken one. The others are just small conveniences that are used rarely.
---
Why are you talking about it like a conspiracy? He mentioned time and again how there was a dedicated discord and people were scouting implings for him. Not like he's hiding it.
---
Imagine doing that for every player, doesn't seem feasible.
---
I feel like I've now missed something about Guild Wars
---
They already do it for bot detection anyways.
---
lmfao just use overlays, jagex can't do shit

Clearly you've been fortunate enough in your life to never work for a big business, because this kind of turnover at a large, under-paying company is completely normal. Also, you're truly delusional if you think this sub is mostly new players. A survey from a few months ago showed that the vast majority of people on this sub are 10+ year veterans.

300 kc on task - 1 jaw
---
*OSBUDDY has left the chat*
---
&gt; maybe the problem is not directly the client providing easening the content, but perhaps the problem is that the content is god awful to do without the easening? Im not into the circlejerk that says: I trained 99 rc doing nature runes and suffering, everybody should suffer now too.
---
The anti-easyscape players will never vote to make skilling easier because they did it the hard way.
---
Thank you
---
I guess my fear is that the game will shut down. I'm just short of 2200 total, and from here on out it's all grinding, so it's not worth it to me if the game is on a timer.
---
no problem, my friend :P
---
Ooh that's a good idea. I mean what would you recommend I afk? Like stuff to get money or what?
---
So 3pc should add that code then, all issues are solved
---
I met Settled 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but Swampletcs himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I‚Äôm trying to quiet her down because I didn‚Äôt want her to bother Swampy, but she wouldn‚Äôt stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Settled put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barbershop. Chill guy, really nice about it.

When you say "done" what do you mean? Asking sincerely. Is it an MTX concern, pvp, etc...?
---
ORSS
---
potheads mad
---
It‚Äôs odd the OSRS community has consistently voted for features that RS3 has. It‚Äôs like they want RS3 stuff with the 2007 skin, but they won‚Äôt admit it.
---
But hey, what do I know?
---
It's only 1/65
---
That's not that bad
---
thank god that‚Äôs the result. definitely wouldn‚Äôt be playing if they changed this
---
Go back to your cheat client, noob.
---
goblin boy
---
Not really. The amount of time he‚Äôs put in to this point is likely fairly comparable to what‚Äôs ahead.
---
Just thinking of it this way, pretty much all of the time he‚Äôs spent at feral vampires will have to be redone, that alone is hundreds of additional hours. Let‚Äôs also not forget that with the way XP is set up it will take as much xp from 92-99 as for the first 92 levels, so that‚Äôs a lot of additional time required. 
---
Then there‚Äôs the time that will be necessary for actually figuring out ToB, running for items like the scythe, building back his resources after runs, etc.
---
There‚Äôs a huge amount of potential content left.
---
... fuck
---
Don't forget to ask about their interest rates.
---
Raids, even tho I guess you can solo
---
There's also other group content such as zalcano and wt
---
Technically you can solo all of these, but you know what I mean
---
You're talking about Draw Distance which is under GPU plugins but that doesn't mean all of the GPU plugin is banned.
---
go back to your 400x300 client
---
nonce
---
Why in the world do you need a plug-in that is going to tell you the obvious? If the demonic gorilla is attacking with mage, as you said, it‚Äôs potential next attacks are given. Do you *really* need a visual cue to point that out for you?
---
So let's delete guides on the internet. After all, somebody who shouldn't be able to consistently kill Zulrah can consistently kill Zulrah with that crutch.
---
Only matters for smithing.
---
The company is profiting from their work, and using that to fund harmful monetary practices. As attitudes and policies shift, certain Jmods might not be comfortable continuing to work there with how they handle MTX.
---
Still banned regardless.   
---
GPU scaling allows you to have 30 fps instead of 15 fps, more frames = better reaction time.
---
Spoiler tag, dick
---
Lol I see the fearmongering got the best of you
---
A huge unlock for the account
---
They also claim that they don't want the easyscape from RS3. But they still want all those features from the 3rd party clients that make the game easier :)
---
I think you just alt+click on rl to drag it around
---
fuck lmfao
---
What specifically makes him an amazing person? Producing Youtube videos doesn't seem to qualify.
---
Probably not. Just make a disclaimer you can be banned for using it. But im not sure how they can ban for it, detection wise
---
You'd be hard pressed to find anything from osrs available for a single player download
---
Most of the rsps with osrs stuff had to be coded by the owners. So they're not quick to share that stuff
---
yeah but jagex cant detect if you're using overlays, so they're "banned" but you won't get banned for using them
---
It's drawing a number of people to the game by itself, and he is good about explaining things that newer players might not pick up on. A lot of what I've personally found enjoyable isn't RS exclusive, either.
---
Well you don‚Äôt have to worry, most players are botting and using gold they bought online anyways. 
---
Those saving 10k xp/hr not having to right click over you because you insist on using the vanilla client should be sent strait to Jagex hell!!
---
I value my time. I‚Äôm not going to not do content because I can‚Äôt find an empty world to do it in. I always hop for a few minutes before crashing obviously but if you‚Äôre meleeing dust devils in the bigger room, you‚Äôre shit out of luck.
---
Fucking incredible
---
Like that makes it better.
---
So from what I read I should be just fine using default Runelite
---
I like how this is quite HD, yet low-poly. I would love a toggleable option for such hi-res models in OSRS.
---
Do you know that most people will never do that or experience such diverse play styles because they don't want to restart the game that they've already progressed through? It's for the same for why Zezima only plays RS3 as revealed officially in "The RuneScape Documentary." Considering 99% of the players are not playing 40+ hours a week, as in your example, it will take months of undesirable work to progress through content that you've already unlocked for an account that you may or may not even enjoy in the end. Instead of spending 400 hours, which is over 6 months of time spent on an Alt at 2 hours daily not considering your main's playtime, training a single melee combat skill to 99 at usually 50-100k exp/h (up to **260 hours alone**) we would able to wake up any day and decide to try out more diverse PVP content that wouldn't have been reasonably accessible before. Maxed Zerkers, Void Tribridding, 1 defense pures: all now able to be experienced by the majority of main only players. It's important to think of the potential in concepts for game growth above all and, again, to challenge assumptions about how things should be.
---
You have to count to 3. Never actually used the gorillas plugin so idk, but if they count the attacks for you, it would make gorillas that much more AFK.
---
East of Sophanem, there is a mountain and a small swamp from "Dealing with Scarabas", the sequel to "Contact!". I think it is just an annoying area to run through from the quest and not much else. Also, south of it is a small island with [super camels](https://runescape.wiki/w/Camel_Warrior).
---
MES also changes the input for chaos altar bones. Is that just 'QoL' as well? Is that 'QoL' because you personally use it and osb bad cuz you don't get to abuse it?
---
He‚Äôs only ever clipped when he‚Äôs yelling or being over the top. You gotta actually watch his stream to understand he‚Äôs not a complete lunatic. Usually there‚Äôs a build up to his autism spasms and he‚Äôs got a good amount of comedic timing. Trust me, he knows what he‚Äôs doing.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know they were a thing and now I want one
---
My cousin dislikes RS and i showed him this video. he‚Äôs currently watching the series
---
This is actually tricky: I just paid for a year.
---
And of course they can "ban" me without giving any reason. However that also means they disable my way to play the game, eu dictates that then for the time I cannot use the money I have to get my subscription back.
---
If they can proof I violated the rules it's a different story, however then the proof lies on them, and they have to provide a rock solid proof that should ultimately hold in court, and the defendend should always, always be made aware of that proof. (They have to be able to defend themselves, this is how western law works).
---
Regardless of whether or not Customizable shift-click is here to stay, I would still say it's a worthwhile goal to strive for. I burned out basically my entire cash stack to get 99 with max upgrades, but it's such a great QoL skill to get to 99.
---
Coming from r/all. I used to play Runescape back in 2004 but quit shortly after they started updating graphics and EOC was introduced. I started watching this but quickly realized I wasn't understanding a single thing. If I begin at episode 1, will I be able to catch on to what is happening? Don't want to go down a rabbit hole without knowing what I'm getting into.
---
Only dominant speakies can understand.
---
How the fuck could I be banned playing mobile? Runelite on desktop and the official app on mobile. I work three shifts and sometimes im up all night playing mobile at work. How the fuck does this even happen? If you monitored my account it would have shown that every week is another playing style moving forward 8 hours. Your detection system doesn't basically eliminates the possibility that someone is able to play efter 00:00 when you apparently should be asleep. Im in GMT+1 time zone living in Sweden. I would love to believe that this is a joke. I demand an answer from anyone responsible to this action. I keep investing hours upon hours in this game to either get hacked, cleaned or banned. Whats the fucking point anymore?
---
Me hate gringing &gt;:(
---
That‚Äôs what every ban says, fyi
---
Aka nothing
---
It's actually Sandrobics.
---
He is speaking de language of de gods
---
Overlays aren't anything to do with clicks though.
---
Its way better thay without. Zalcano shoots at the main rock off screen most the time. The client litterally says when to run and mine.
---
Yeah it's different because it's right there where I'm looking, and more accurate, and for whatever reason it upsets people. Win win win.
---
&gt;Vanilla client is much better
---
It objectively isn't and that's why the majority of the playerbase uses third party clients.
---
Beautifully said
---
Name checks out lmao
---
I legitimately teared up when he got his rune crossbow
---
dank.

If you look away, and miss  attacks it still counts to 3 for you. Clearly something you wouldn‚Äôt have known without it. You would of had to guess then.

You should get into Linux of you're learning to program. A lot of services you want to probably start run off of some version of Linux without gnome anyways. 
---
Everything in the future is going to be Linux based, including Google stadias back bone. Hell even with one of the newer windows updates they put a Linux file system in there so you have compatability in the server space, which usually was only really done on windows XP.
---
That is exactly the definition of hard, if its hard to learn the content is hard, if you master something its supposed to be easy as a master.
---
That‚Äôs not included in the example list, and I‚Äôm certain they would have included one example of non-skill-training menu entry swapper if that was illegal
---
Vote no to gringing!!!!!
---
Just a note, I don't actually use the farming timers because I literally do 1 herb run per day at very best, I hate farm runs. 
---
But you realise your statement contradicts itself entirely, right? You're saying these things are easily done by other methods, which, if anyone is serious about doing farm runs multiple times per day they will already make a note of the time their next farm run is, but then say they should be removed from 3pc? What difference does it make? How is a farming timer in a client differ from me knowing I planted my herbs at X time so they will be ready at X time? How does it differ from me setting a timer on Google for 80 minutes, that will alert me the second the time is up? There's no difference, it's just QoL to be able to press 1 button and see the ROUGH time until my herbs are done.
---
Really cool progress. Make sure to get a Crystal bow too thats dope also!
---
I believe those are saved in a separate location from the client files
---
Spawn markers on where something MIGHT spawn. For things that have a static spawn tile, I‚Äôm sure marking that tile is acceptable
---
The same can be said about people being extremely efficient at construction doing dungeon doors or mahogany tables.... If you're already being efficient at these areas left click build/remove will not improve your xp rates at all. If I am right clicking the banker when I do smithing then ofc I'm getting the same xp as if I left click the banker. The fact that banking at the banker gets you more xp rate than the booth and left clicking the banker makes you able to do it without any extra effort is what makes it in the same vein. 
---
I'm not saying it's hard to right click banker while smithing, i'm just saying it falls in the same place as one-click construction.
---
Mate, you can literally do a full herb run then go to Google and type "timer" then type in 80 mins into the timer and soon as the time is up it'll start making an alert.
---
I thought you were able to do this with the original client like with Ardy Knight left click pickpocketing.
---
Is that not the case for Menaphite thugs?
---
This guys a fucking legend
---
Actually they could, however it would be a resource hog "ultimate". - They could periodically take screenshots in the client, and then pixel by pixel compare the color data to a "calculated" colour.
---
However this means they have to rewrite the drawing engine (directx/opengl) in runescape.
---
Settled does an AMAZING job of making progress videos entertaining and thrilling. Definitely an upgrade from A Sellou- I mean A Friend.
---
if your accs are getting hacked its possible that would be why you got banned... it's very common to macro on hacked accs..
---
They are being very careful with their words
---
I'm not. You know what you want. I think the people who where constantly messaging mod Ash and others on Twitter didn't know what they want. They where probably just thinking of upvotes on Reddit not thinking about the out come of what could happen.
---
You, you have a clear and precise message, how can I not get down with that?
---
273 on task 0 off task 0 Jaw 1 drop of head+Rune Javelins
---
From what I remember Guild Wars 2 would monitor your PC programs for cheat detection or something and would ban you for having programs run that weren't even interacting with the game
---
it was a disaster
---
Konduit received a C&amp;D almost immediately from one of the mods.

This only actually impacts the XP rate of smithing at an anvil, which you have the entire inventory time to right click the banker in the bank and have your mouse hovered on bank. Left clicking it is actually no more advantage, as speed of doing so doesn't matter because you have like 10 seconds to prepare your mouse.
---
Problem: vanilla RS client is ass because there's no resource being put into improving it.
---
Solution: open-source vanilla RS client on somewhere like GitHub and allow people to contribute enhancements to it, saving dev resources and improving the client cheaply.
---
Reality: Jagex are massively overprotective of their IP even if its over a decade old and has been ripped apart by third-parties.
---
Skills have been fine for the first 5 years, why does it all have to be easier and lazier?
---
&gt;Now simple features like UI elements that tell you what prayers to use at cerb, or other monsters are now deemed illegal.
---
i dont think these things are particularly simple? the difference between gorillas with and without the plugin is gigantic. you literally dont have to pay attention at gorillas with a system that counts for you.
---
I don't think so, but I could easily be wrong. I only spent enough time there to get 53 for DT then forget that miserable 2 hours lol.
---
They haven't specifically banned any single client, they have just said plugins listed in the blog are now bannable. If, say, OSBuddy decided to add/keep demonic gorillas, Zulrah, whatever (I'm not aware what plugins OSBuddy has), there's no way for Jagex's bot detection to pick up the fact that you have an overlayed box or an overlayed timer, or an overlayed pray icon of what to pray next.
---
I realize that, if it‚Äôs that easy, what runelite provides should not be considered as OP and more of a QoL. 
---
It‚Äôs a GUI that saves you time and keeps you ‚Äúin the game‚Äù.
---
I usually use a stylus and it works pretty well
---
Cheating implies an unfair advantage but if everyone has equal access is it unfair?
---
The wildy altar does have bone burying protection just like the poh. Pretty sure you have to be right next to the altar for it engage.
---
Exactly. If it makes it so it removes an intended mechanic to think on, i.e it makes it so you mindlessly wait for a cue rather than mindfully interacting with the game, then it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. 
---
I would akin it to playing chess on the computer, except each move you look at the hint which will give you the next best move. And you move solely according to that. Now to some people that could be fun, but are you even engaging the mind? What‚Äôs the point? You‚Äôre no longer playing chess, really.
---
I got an iPhone, I really wish I still had my note I bet it‚Äôs amazing with the stylus, guess I‚Äôm gonna have to get an apple pen hahaha
---
OSRS players are spoiled. Giving jagex grief for actually making a statement. Meanwhile here on RS3, Crickets about MTX. Smh
---
Probably after the series concludes. A skeleton in the myre with a rusty crossbow in its hand.
---
Tell your teacher that you are feeling good about your test because you watched some Khan Academy videos and feel like you have a better concept of the material. See what she says, what her reaction is.
---
Now tell your teacher you are feeling confident taking your test because your friend Salman Khan is going to stand next to you giving you step by step instructions on how to solve the problems. Yeah its right there, that's the fucking point that makes it unfair. You are intentionally disregarding that fact so you can feel better about cheating.
---
I started OSRS for the first time about a month ago after watching him, so yeah I'd say show it to him lol.
---
Exactly. Menu entry swapping getting removed just means I reactivate mouse keys and rebind the side button on my mouse. Now instead of intuitive interface design I mash right mouse, mb4 and left mouse in a millisecond and achieve the same thing.
---
People against static menu entry swappers don't realise the people they think are getting some insane advantage will just move back to mousekeying interfaces while the casuals get disadvantages
---
Thanks!
---
What does it say? I‚Äôm at work currently
---
"New graphical item does not respond perfectly with a mixture of the thousands of equipables"
---
Right Click Report, Submit Bug. State your gear. Move along.
---
Future OSRS game updates will break Runelite if you don't update it.
---
Does it matter if something is not detectable? It can still be against the rules for future clarification or updates to detect it
---
It takes already available information and just makes it neater for you. The other banned plugins actually affect gameplay.
---
Ah. Thanks for correcting me. I was unaware that did not work before. (I was an OSB pleb when I started backüò≠)
---
Yep, I had a discussion with a few friends before the statement where I said, the owners of Jagex will make their decision from a business standpoint. Although the "quitting" threats are most probably not going to happen if 3pc are banned, what will definitely happen is player retention will drop, as a result Jagex will lose money. Any game, their main priority is player retention, because the more you keep a player on your game, the more likely they are to spend money.
---
Its like a TV show, spoiler tag for first 48. Common courtesy for those stuck at work or similar lol
---
Im saying that farming (or something I said, not reading that again) gives me aids.
---
100%
---
This is so wholesome.
---
They didn‚Äôt list any NPC talk-to entry swaps in the list, they would have given one example of it if it were illegal. Nothing to be pissed about
---
And yet most "distinct" advantages are just clear improvements in visibility and usability of a 2 decade old interface design.. and many of them get implemented into the main game and now aren't even remembered as "omg so OP" plugins.
---
Read: XP drops, shift dropping, bank withdraw options, zoom levels, attack options, left click range, make-x interface update.
---
I don't play on OSB, I use RL.
---
Yes but OP linked directly to what I said and off-handedly referred to them as if they were QOL changes
---
99 RC
---
I have a friend whose brothers coworker briefly dated Settled. She said that on their first date they went to a restaurant and Settled ordered two different bowls of soup and mixed them together one spoonful at a time before eating both bowls mixed together as one soup.
---
They should have opened the client, listed each one, and listed which are allowed or not AND WHY.  This shit is crap, leaves way too much vague shit.
---
Cheating is cheating man. With a test, game or a relationship there's a reason it's all the same word.
---
Just worth mentioning that the first 20 minutes is quite word rich as they talk about 3rd party clients, staff leaving, runefest/Q&amp;As, account security blog etc. I've tried to summarise those as best I could but you should really check the announcement post for full info!
---
I came here for *M E M E S*, not for feels!
---
True until proven you WEREN‚ÄôT there
---
Nah, I'd rather risk a few deaths and have bored as fuck PKers completely wasting their time for shit PVM loot instead of actually having fun. Too much toxic firsthand experience for me to vote yes on any PVP content, even if it's something I actually really wanted.
---
Ugh it's actually quite clear, and it essentially boils down to: every single 3rd party client has features that are bannable and you have been warned.
---
Doesnt need a level but requires a ‚Äúhead‚Äù drop from a specific mob to use and recolour the helm. Kbd for black, sire/abby demons for red, kq for green, hydra for dark blueish, vorkath for light blue and skotizo claw for purple.
---
No levels, but you need an item to color it. 
---
For example the KBD heads for a black color, after you unlock the option to do so.
---
And they proceed to give only examples of ones which affect skills and possibly xp rates, in particular the ones osb has recently released. If you really think they care about a bank swap or something similar and think they can detect it simply don't use it. Im simply explaining why people are interpreting it differently, not stating my opinion here.
---
1 click pickpocket is pretty dumb
---
Swampman shit
---
Cool thanks ! I already bought the red not realizing it took more kills than all the rest to obtain. But awesome. Appreciate it
---
Okay, have fun
---
I would love to see what they could do with a none ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù raid. Whether it be sara, arma, or guthix, I think it‚Äôd be really neat
---
If you're trying to say cheating in a video game is the same thing as cheating in a relationship then idk what to say dude, you sound like randal from recess rn
---
Regardless, the lack of new and engaging PVP content is self-inflicted. Several PVP polls probably would have passed if almost everyone voting no didn't have several firsthand stories of toxic creatures griefing them in the Wild.
---
Who the fuck keeps putting the barricades back up? The dagganoth? I don‚Äôt think so. There‚Äôs no reason for those to go back up after you pass through the first time. Maybe make them stay down after a quest or the hard diary?
---
He didn't get a single dragonstone drop! It's a shame, really.
---
To extend on this, here is how I'd add Level 80 Armor. For one, Bandos, Armadyl, and Ancestral are all the same tier; their levels vary and Ancestral is still rarer, but they are all equivalent armors so those would be what is upgraded to make Level 80.
---
Instead of just using an upgrade item on them, it would require Smithing or Crafting. So to upgrade a helm, it would be 1 Fragment and 90 Smithing/Crafting, Legs would be 2 Fragments and 93, and Body would be 3 Fragments and 96. (Side note, no idea how you deal with Bandos's lack of a helm.) This would make tradeable Level 80 Armor, but it would degrade similar to Barrows. However, that is not all. If you take the Level 80 Armor and 1-3 Fragments, you can upgrade it to a non-degrade version that is untradeable. That catch is this requires 1 level higher than what is needed to make the armor, so 91, 94, and 96. If you lose it in a PvP Death, it reverts back to a full charge tradeable version.
---
So overall, this system would fix a lot of problems. It provides a sink for Bandos, Armadyl, and Ancestral while keeping it relevant. The untradeable upgrades adds a bit more of a sink to the Fragments as well to help avoid a Pegasian issue. It makes Smithing and Crafting relevant to make the initial armor and worth leveling to make the untradeable armor without locking BiS stats behind high skill levels. And it even makes the POH Armor Stand repair discount more useful so you can benefit from Smithing even without the level to make the untradeable version.
---
I remember back in highschool we had a true and false section where we only had to write T of F. I ended up writing a mutated form T/F so the teacher couldn't tell.... I got zero on that section
---
tbh at that point it's just straight up botting so it'd be up to the bot detection to look for patterns if the client is trying to spoof input.
---
Windows movie Maker
---
Unregistered hypercam 2
---
There is no other way
---
No, if you get 88 percent, you start receiving bolt racks. You DON'T want bolt racks.
---
My comment is written correctly.
---
I blame jagex for releasing an unclear article
---
MMOs like elder scrolls online have this. If setting up a web site is too hard for them websites like Nexus for mods could be used. Could probably make use of the Nexus manager too, but that's getting too third party for my comfort again if we're going down the 'official' third party plugins. Ideally they would have their own web page where you just link the plugin to your login.
---
In elder scrolls online the capabilities really only let you change minor things like displaying information in different ways, or modifying UI elements, or making a dps display tool. In osrs I imagine this would just end up being floor item text and the basics in a enviorment where they can control. 
---
Other nice thing about this way is they only have to work into the client maybe once or twice, instead of trying to make a new official client feature Everytime runelite thinks of a new plugin that gets popular.
---
If I was training at black chins it would only be for the XP and they would be released before the chin stack could ever go over 40-50. Fuck giving any of these creatures even 1k.
---
1, 10, X, All, something like that is what you should look for. That‚Äôs how you withdraw/deposit all. It came out on mobile first and was later added to the desktop version to keep everything equal.
---
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
South zeah.
---
I haven't played Runescape in like 10 years but I still enjoy watching these videos so there is a lot of new (to me) stuff that I don't really understand.   
---
How does he go about managing his inventory? Is there some sort of bank he can use or is that not available in the area he is at? He talks about how important inventory space is, but it seems like sometimes he swaps around what he is carrying but I don't know where his other stuff goes.
---
Where‚Äôs your Woox plugin?
---
Duo Kalphite Queen was really popular back in the day. I remember being on rsnl dot eu(dutch runescape website) and seeing a lot of picture collage about people doing it.
---
I somehow did this puzzle on the first attempt (not row), just barely made it lol
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Mods: Kieren, JohnC, Sween, Gambit.
---
2.  This will be the last Q&amp;A before RuneFest.
---
  *  Thanks
---
3.  Announcements. Please see News post for 3rd Party Clients. Mod Wolf is Leaving. Fremennik Exiles was released last week. Currently a poll for BH rewards rework. RuneFest is coming up so keep an eye on that! This weeks game update will be Wednesday instead of Thursday to ensure that Jmods are able to attend RuneFest and be on-hand for the update.
---
  *  https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1 ------- https://twitter.com/Jay_Wilton/status/1178610468749037568
---
4. There will be a few updates on Fremennik Exiles, knights will be harder to kill with some bug updates.
---
  *  Thanks!
---
5. What took so long to get a proper statement and why was it delayed?
---
  *  Because it's a large and sensitive topic there are lots of people that need to sign off on any official comms around the studio. There was a lot of back and forth refining that. 
---
6. Have you been discussing this between the developers of the clients?
---
  *  There has been some discussions. Can't say what and who this was between but if you are a developer of a client please feel free to reach out to discuss this further.
---
7. If a certain feature is against the rules but thousands of players have used it for Months, why won't you b%FILTER%an them? How is it fair that they get to keep their advantage over players getting to do that content in the future?
---
  *  We apologise for the delay in statement/action and lack of clarity. With that said it wouldn't be fair to apply sanctions to players that used features when our stance wasn't clearer. 
---
8. In the blog you mention more clarity, how can we get that clarity when @JagexSupport links to help pages and your other staff don't reply or just direct us to Jagex support. How do I know what I'm doing won't get us ba%FILTER%nned?
---
  *  Keep an eye on the 3rd Party Clients announcement page as this will change as required. 
---
9. What will you do to players that abuse these features?
---
  *  We will take some time to consider how to enforce this and may apply b%FILTER%ans, in the longer term we will look at how else to address that.
---
10. What will you do to those that are developing and sharing clients that includes those features?
---
  *  In a similar note to above we are taking time to assess. We will communicate an update once decided however that may not be made public or only communicated to those specifically developing and sharing. 
---
11. You talk about other clients but don't mention yours, what are the plans here. Why don't you update the official client or partner with another unofficial?
---
  *  We want to work with you (players) to determine the right long term solution. We took some impulsive action last year that player base was not happy with - saying that RuneLite should be shut down. We don't want to discount any options but have a lot to consider, like what issues that may lead to. --- Partnering with a client has further considerations like what happens to forked clients or those derived from others? 
---
12. What's the status on the account security blog?
---
  *  We have identified work that we'd like to do with account security. Having read it (Sween) feels it handles all concerns and we are in the process of working out when you might see those changes. Want to release the blog when we know more on that timeline. 
---
13. What's happening with the OSRS team and everybody leaving? MTX etc?
---
  *  No, no MTX. Not downsizing the team either we want to grow! Have a new Executive producer which we'll introduce after RuneFest. A new dev started today and new product manager and a new QA manager! There are more and developer agreements with engine team plans too! --- It is sad to stop working with our friends, at the same time we will continue and new staff will come. 
---
14. Any chance of having the Jormungand as a repeatable mid-level slayer boss?
---
  *  Anything is possible from a technical point, it would need consideration and rewards/incentives to repeat it. --- Kieren; Feels like a reasonable idea and we've done repeatable bosses in the past. While doing repeatable bosses (Galvek, SoTE boss etc) is nice it doesn't see large engagement so adding value back and incentive is a nice idea. --- Gambit: From a Lore perspective it doesn't make huge sense so maybe could need consideration.
---
15. Are the following mobile improvements possible? Long-tap delay adjustable, portrait mode, items on ground indicator, ability to tap on the far side of menus of different phone sizes.
---
  *  tap-delay we can adjust but not sure if it can be player-dynamic ---- Portrait was explored when developing mobile and it was BAD, not really useable and you really don't want it. The User interface doesn't work in any real way and it would be a huge amount of work to make it useable in any way and still won't be good. --- Clicking outside the side-stones, that change will be coming on Wednesday with a toggle. --- Items on the ground; Something that would like to address and include but is not straightforward due to the way the game is build and the way the app works and interacts with the client etc. No idea what that will look like but something will happen one-day.
---
16. Can you make the Face-guard a little darker to match Ba%FILTER%ndos better?
---
  *  Really it's up to you guys but to avoid changing the helmet that it's based on (Neitiznot) it would be preferable to introduce this as a recolour option. Check out Mod Wests twitter and give feedback!
---
17. Is there a mod to contact if you have any ideas for OSRS improvements?
---
  *  Reddit, Twitter, any current Mod! Q&amp;A etc too! 
---
18. There are a number of questions about whether a specific plugin is ba%FILTER%nnable.
---
  *  We can't say specifically right now but we are monitoring it and will take action in the future if we need to.
---
19. At one point John C mentioned saving multiple logins on Mobile.
---
  *  This was something we were looking at, am not an expert in login Authorisation but believe it's possible. Not in the current immediate plan but would like to follow that up. 
---
20. Gambit: Just talking to ED and the team about the new Neitiznot helm and whether it should be Best in slot having +6 or +5 Strength bonus. This can change and we are looking at it. 
---
  *  Strawpoll: Should the new helm be +5 or +6 Strength bonus. 51% +6....49% +5.
---
21. Can we get Agility contracts to make agility less painful?
---
  *  Don't think it would make it less painful! Contracts for the right content can be really engaging and rewarding however feel that Agility could be changed in other ways if players want.
---
22. [IMAGE] Swampletics Fan-art. /u/JulianGyllene
---
  *  Wow!
---
23. [IMAGE] @JagexWest Pixel-art map of Gielinor
---
 * Cute! Check his twitter for different sizes too.
---
See, reasoning doesn't really have any relevance. Luckily PKers are still hated enough in general that we keep smacking down the shitty PVP polls.
---
Eww
---
24. Discussion on Strawpoll result for the faceguard.
---
  *  Will have to think about it further as well where and how the Serp. Helm fits in too. There is a bit of room at the top for a new BIS helm so please send through feedback on this (and any other rewards or updates too!). --- Longer discussion on long-term roadmaps for example polling rewards seperate to context of where they come from, what content would players expect to see new meta-changing things like t80 (instead of being announced as it comes up). 
---
25. Met last week to discussed opinion polls and surveys on existing content that players may want us to look at. That's going to be a bit more of a process to go through so that we know what should be addressed next and how (watch this space).
---
  *  Mod Gambit is working on this and will hear more on that soon and have a chance to provide feedback on that.
---
26. Death Mechanics. 
---
  *  Idea is an in-game poll or to address that specifically as the game progresses. We want to figure out how and what kind of work would be required here.
---
27. Could we get a way to select which game messages are filtered? Currently we can choose whether to filter messages but cannot choose which are filtered and which are not.
---
  *  Unfortunately not. That would be a big change to how the chat system works on that level. Could make it so you can toggle a few of them or specific ones, but not to have every message toggleable... 
---
28. Currently finding a PVM clan or group requires going to the forums to stumble across an old thread has has been bumped. Can the trading post be repurposed to advertise clans?
---
  *  No idea how exactly the Trading Post works! But totally open to looking at a solution in some way, an in-game thing like the POH notice-board or something. 
---
29. Can the success rate of cooking Zamorak wines scale, it's odd at the change of failing is the same from when you can make them all the way to 99. Maybe 50% at 65 cooking and 100% at 99? 
---
  *  We could look at that, worth consideration.
---
30. Do you feel that locking Zulrah behind a quest requirement is necessary?
---
  *  Kieren: Really there's two sides to this; bots and whether it's appropriately requirements for eng-game level items. Generally don't like changing game content that already exists like that, for the sake of bots. --- Sween: Some success was seen when changing things last year for the anti-botting measures like making Dragon-slayer start requirement for wielding Anti-dragon shields. --- Needs further consideration and discussing with appropriate team.
---
31. What are your plans for Raids 3? There's some burn-out in the high-level PVM community and recent content has been solo-oriented. A new challenge would be fun. 
---
  *  JohnC: Have been thinking and Discussing with ED about where and how a new raid would look like but that's all I'll say for now. --- Gambit: There are lots of places we could introduce new content like that.
---
32. What kind of room in the game is there for more Guilds? Runecrafting or a tanks guild?
---
  *  JohnC: Room for all of them! So long as the content matches and feels right. They're a great place for central content that fits. --- Perhaps for existing content survey etc! --- Gambit: The Farming guild set the bar quite high so would definitely want to make guilds have continuing content.
---
33. Thoughts on revamping Slayer bosses like Grotesque Guardians or Abyssal Sire?
---
  *  A lot of these tweaks are known and achievable but not currently in the schedule... Husky has taken on looking at Sire issues and there's nothing official planned or in the works but hopefully there will be something at some time! --- Guardians issues have been noted and are on the list to look at.
---
34. Following expansions, Treasure Trails soon become saturated with rewards. Could there be a new activity for cosmetics?
---
  *  Yes, it would be nice to offer more ways to access more content. 
---
35. Elves in Prifddinas have a rare unique on their thieving table, can other high level thieving NPCs get their own?
---
  *  Like this question as a lot of high-level thieving NPCs aren't engaged a lot because they don't have incentive. This would be a nice way to encourage that without impacting XP rates. If you have any ideas on designs please let us know! 
---
36. Can we please have a default option on the Jewelry box? This would be in line with other Jewellery in the house.
---
  *  Think so maybe? It would be nice and don't have anything against having a default. Will have to look into it further.
---
37. Group Ironman?
---
  *  The engine work required (for Clans too) is happening but we don't have anything to offer at this stage. 
---
38. Can you poll a minigame task system, this would encourage people to try out a variety of minigames?
---
  *  What do you see that being? Would this be to go play X minigames or tasks within the minigame? We've seen in a number of instances that anything that has poor design or doesn't directly encourage winning means that players just AFK or have other motives. Would be nice to encourage more activity through other means but some solution could be explored. 
---
39. PVP updates and how those are polled?
---
  *  We are currently running a poll and the last question asks why a player may vote no so that we can get a better idea on why players may be voting no. It's still in the works and planning.
---
Calling it. This next season he he get a pet or a cape of skulls.
---
You seem fun.
---
You're getting upset over nothing, chill.
---
rs3 uses c++, OSRS uses Java. Most of the team who converted rs3 -&gt; c++ have left.
---
why wasn‚Äôt he looking for obby cape R instead of god cloak?
---
but why not have them as treasure trail rewards?
---
