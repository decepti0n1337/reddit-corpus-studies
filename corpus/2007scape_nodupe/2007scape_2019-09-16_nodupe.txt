From the thumbnail I thought the left was a screenshot from AdventureQuest
---
There's a really good cannon spot not marked on runelite in the far northwestern corner of taverly dungeon. I'd suggest checking it out on YouTube. It makes black demons absurdly fast and reasonably AFK.
---
You can check out “Noble Bros”. We do everything from gwd, raids, pking, etc. A variety of players from new to max!
---
lmao this has to be satire. JMods aren't even responsible for customer support. If they help you resolve something here or on twitter its literally out of the goodness of their hearts to help their players.
---
They did shut it down?
---

---
It was removed in this week's update....
---
Ahhh that explains it then! Yep it's definitely faster to the first harvestable patch. Makes more sense there. I was talking purely on herb runs, as a main Normie account I don't bother with allotments because the XP doesn't really justify time spent.
---
11m xp since superior update, 400kc nothing but staves.
---

---
Did he just Sudoku?
---
Oof I'm at like 950kc 
---
2 claws 
---
3 leathers
---
And pet. Also I did all those kills on release
---
Yep time to the west allotment patch would definitely be competitive or faster than time to herb patch. As a person doing just herbs, ecto continues its reign! ;)
---
If you don't put a space after the arrow it looks a lot better cuz Reddit formatting
---
Without the formatting it really just looks like a wall of text and the arrows don't really help seperate it
---
Yikes
---
Yeh precisely correct. Sorry for the confusion and I've undone any negative votes I gave. I thought you were talking specifically herbs.
---
As for mains, doing Snape grass is definitely worthwhile to speed up levelling if you're doing herb runs anyway. But as post-99 I don't really care. Fruit trees and big patches will get me to 200m well before I'm done any other skills, and the pet chance on allotments is horrible, and profit not really worth bothering about.
---
if you ever feel useless just remember red spice exists
---
Fucking scary that it was connected with the release of a widescale bonus XP event shortly after.
---
Let's get a 7th piece of graceful for that then. How bout a graceful scarf?
---
We used to all hate updates. It was a different time. We voted no to almost EVERYthing. Anything that wasn't the whip was dead Content. Anything that was better then the whip was too op. 
---
I remember at one point the staff of the dead was actually the best str training weapon in the game, and was commonly used during Slayer.
---
I tested it with a timer. The confusion was that the original comments were talking about time to any patch. Which ring would be slightly faster to allotment..I'm talking time to herbs, where Ectophial wins.
---
So sure I didn't screen record my work computer and send you a YouTube video of the testing. But I've told you you're welcome to go and test it, I've done the timing just now and it proved what I thought. You obviously haven't and/or are talking specifically about allotments as well without specifying that.
---
that order is decent, but I can see you having you deviate to less than optimal leps as a result of using ecto. like after lumby you either have to run back to the lep at that patch or run to the ardy lep twice, which costs a few seconds that with a better order you wouldn't even touch the ardy lep and only touch the lumby one on the way to the patch. but ya it's just a few seconds here and there but it adds up when it's something you're doing thousands of times.
---
I have to myself. I've timed it. You can do the same. I'm not about to screen record my work computer to prove something so easily tested. Ectophial wins to herb patches, which is what I do and what I was timing. The misconception with the main comment was he was referring to any patch, due to being an iron. I don't do allots or flowers, and therefore ring is slower. If you do, go for it. I'll stick to ecto being faster for my runs, which I've tested it as being. You can stay in denial with no testing if you are doing herb runs. Doesn't bother me.
---
You can afk gargs for 2 mins no problem (or loot disappears) these can combo you out in 3 hits.
---
Gz on unban and reward but it's actually awful that your competing was largely in part to seek jmod attention, really glad it worked out but it's lousy that it has to be like that sometimes
---
Looks like Will Smith's makeup is rubbing off.
---
loot from 10000 collective bot hours ft. 1000 bots
---
loot: all accounts swipe banned
---
What's your estimate for the percentage? That's much better because you then wouldn't go all over the place with anywhere from about half to almost everyone.
---
It's only 5-8% 
---
These are official numbers from jagex
---
Y'know the ppl who actually know the numbers
---
[removed]
---
in all seriousness, this is a trap you fall into quite easily at this point.
---
You don't know what to do, but you're bored. But you can't decide on what to do because it all sounds boring.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just pick a thing, whatever it is, and go fuck it let's go do it.
---
Kill the giant mole. Go do a barrows run. Do a quest. Once you've actually started doing something it'll snowball. 
---
The same thing happens in eve online. You end up ship spinning then logging off, bored.
---
 If you just undock, even if you don't initially enjoy it you're at least doing something. It can be hard to start, but then eventually you'll find it's harder to stop :P
---
Haha good post! Big fun when say make rune bad x)
---
Lmfao yes
---
F2p has a huge portion because of how easy it is to just make a new account and have it start farming
---
It's def more than 5k, but without f2p I wonder
---
First priority should be to go questing to get those Barrows Gloves. Not only are they incredible, but you'll gain some great xp, teleports, and useful items along the way from other quests.
---
As far as money makers? If you're so combat heavy, I'd suggest Slayer, but that really doesn't start being good until the mid/late 60s. That said...cannoning is worth it. I know it hurts. I've been there, too...but Dagganoths, Kalphites, and a few other tasks will be worth it. Consider it a down-payment on getting to better money makers (Gargoyles, Nechryeals, Abby Spectres, etc.).
---
You should also do your dailies. Completing Easy and Medium Diaries gives you access to some super fast money every day. Battlestaves, Bow Strings, and Dynamite (Varrock, Kandarin, and Kourend, respectively) are earning me 170k every day, and it takes about 40 seconds total to do all of them. I have the Hard Diaries done, but the Medium rewards are about half that, so if you would like to make 85k in 40 seconds, once a day... ;)
---
Herb runs and birdhouse runs are stellar ways to efficiently earn some gp, and they can also be a nice break from whatever you're doing, so it doesn't get too monotonous. They're VERY easy, but can seem intimidating, so just look up a video guide on how to get started. Getting started is the hardest part!
---
Good luck!
---
No you'll need to make a new account. However, I believe you can go from iron Man to a normal account but I might be wrong
---
I didn't mention anything about the skill required, just that the plugin tells you what to do.
---
I don't think it's bad game design. I don't use plugins or anything and the only time I even thought about where to click was when people using overlays were complaining about not having them on mobile. It's really not that difficult to click the agility spots.
---
Yeh I often actually do ardy as my 3rd patch, and lummy after ecto. As that way I can utilise lummy lep on the way through and lummy to cath uses a no tick loss lep. 
---
The reason I slightly altered it is on the move to ardy Lep I do my spellbook swap, which you have to wait for anyway, so there's no time loss there. It's only two patches that create any tick loss. Ice troll is 2 ticks, and ardy is about 2-3. But I've not really seen a better way to organise them as you always have to lose out on a patch somewhere. There's not enough patches with leps on the way to the patch or 0 tick loss spaces away to be able to spread amongst the run.
---
How long is that on average?

That's it! Thanks

Imagine Whitening everything out except runbar because ure paranoid af. gl hf kid nice bank i got there now
---
agreed
---
Lol
---
It wasn't that he was caught botting it was that he created a bot and promoted it even if it was a community fun event.  He made botting seem Ok and Jagex shit that shit down.  He even stated in his videos he is likely to get banned.
---
Commit toaster bath
---
Feelin good!
---
Just got membership, made about 60k on karamja and am grinding for wintertodt. Definitely insanely low lvl (even by f2p standard) but im trying my best!
---
Thanks! Getting there slowly haha (got 89 before I took a 6-week break to focus on Q4 for work). So maybe another 1-2 months to 99 once I start back up after things normalize a bit at work. The super close teleport to a spirit tree is really convenient for whenever I'm not on the main spellbook (and thus can't get to my POH spirit tree as easily).

I don't even know the price of gold because I've never bought or sold gold.
---
Unless you looked up the cost of gold purely for research purposes, I'm gonna say that you're killing and devaluing the game too.
---
Rumor has it that the ladies love bonds
---
Meh. Just feels like pointless clutter to me.
---
please enlighten me how this in any way, shape or form makes the game easier lol
---
The gp/hr of Sire is very good even for main accounts. So try it out and see if you like it.
---
any order that cuts out trollheim, harmony, and ardy leps is the most efficient, which is only possible if you fairy ring to morytania and use that lep.
---
was this with a really big team? It’s way more profitable in groups of 3-4
---
so there's no solution. got it
---
Lmao this shit again. Everyone always says how difficult it is to reach Jagex Support but as this post shows it's a completely straightforward path. Just install a poopchair, win a skilling comp, and wait about 2 years. Now stop complaining.
---
Mad-lad-Chad

use the gpu smoothing thing, made my game a lot cleaner

Yup same results I got. Requires pre configured ring which unfortunately for me isn't a reliable thing due to slayer, clues, etc.

For some reason I always see Kraken pets take forever.
---
Yeah the special events really started getting ridiculous around that time, can’t blame them for following what other games were doing I guess
---
I did this once for someone and they just finished farming and teled. I wanna be an angel-chad too :(
---
Yep, harmony is definitely the big one to avoid, and I've cut troll. But that tick or so I lose at ardy is about the only optimisation I'm missing. Which is why I just combine it with time loss of spellbook swap anyway. I hardly ever do herb runs absolutely optimally to begin with cos it's usually first/last thing I do and often done on mobile or laptop at work ahha
---
Beat that nigga pussy dawg
---
I guess by gp you don’t mean “giant-pecker”
---
Yeah but episode 100 hes going to be unlocking way too much content to even keep up with.
---
Definitely mate, not long left in that grind :)
---
Hahaha it's okay, your situation applies too :D
---
In 2001 shit looked fire
---
they look like ur average osrs pker i dont see what the big deal is here lmfao
---
I am not sure if this beat was used anywhere else, but the only place I've remembered it from is from a song called «Мама сшила мне штаны из берёзовой коры» by Олег Сачков, which turns out to be a remix of Pop Corn by Gershon Kingsley
---
The owner of kiwifarms is in the same league as him, ironically enough.
---
No, I don’t think I will
---
Its not even an arguement its a fact it takes longer training on shared
---
Agility Cape does that, so does the max cape.
---
No, this doesn't even make sense. Why would a fletching cape make you run faster.
---
Overweight people should be laughed at, that is a very good incentive to stop being overweight.
---
It always reminded me of really long peanut butter cookies when you use the fork to smush them down.
---
That's pretty timely by RS3 standards.

I click this thinking it's just a meme. I'm done lol.

He's right, it unlocks the most

They moved on to warding and forgot about it

This is surprisingly accurate besides the fact they would be in the cooks banquet hall. Unless there was some magic time shit the culinancer was doing that I just didn't care to read about.

Seriously, I never had a bank over 50m on OSRS on my main accounts because I just never wanted to PvM for drops when I could just buy them myself??? Fast forward a year and a half later and I’m sitting at over 400m bank on my Ironman account and I haven’t even dived deep into the bossing stage. It’s crazy how much your bank worth increases when you’re forced to not sell anything / stake it.
---
92-99 cutting emeralds? That is pretty bad m8 when cheap and fast alternatives like air battlestaves exist. Especially for your first 99 that is a lot of money to blow.
---
The bankstanders in total level worlds are MUCH worse in my experience
---
This further confirms my suspicions because on OSRS about a year ago I got talking to some random female character at the GE on world 2, and she was being very suggestive, so I got curious and asked a few questions and eventually she added me on Discord and was offering me pics and videos for gold. 
---
She said something like 50m OSRS GP for a video, which I obviously wasn't going to do because I knew she was a guy, so for proof, I told her to go on cam and she said I'd need to pay 20m first, probably because she knew I was on to her and so that she'd yoink the 20m and block me, but in the end I wasn't going through with any of it and she blocked me then went back to follow-dancing with random male characters at the GE.
---
Let's just say on my UIM I forgot to grind out 99 firemaking at wintertodt before getting 55 HP... How much harder did I just make my life?
---
Farming guild came out, Hespori came out, tithe in place. Everyone was happy. Really no need for livestock anymore. Farming went from being a skill I hate to a skill I love with the recent updates.
---
Is there a public codebase for osrs? I'm curious about certain logic in the game but all I really have to go off are shitty rsps snippets that people have made themselves 
---
Dont want to fuck with the client in case I trigger something
---
Battlestaves are good exp,but you will lose wayyy more money.
---
In reality, the bot detection system can't even detect an AHK script with a randomized interval between clicks that doesn't even move the mouse... but I'm really glad you seem to spread this bullshit around the clock lol. Why I don't know; to relieve your cognitive dissonance, to convince others not to bot because it'd remove your advantage, or to convince others not to bot because it WOULD give them an advantage? I don't know, but keep doing it.
---
If everyone bots there's no point in doing it anymore.
---
Only one i ever use is varrock, there might be more but its most peoples go to
---
What?
---
You should probably flood the market now and prevent them from taking off. Don't let merchants keep messing with the economy.

Don't buy into the holiday hype.. just sell all your holiday items now and burn the merchants before they can do anything

Calm down fatty go eat some oreos

The only way to become this obese and maintain the weight is to be absolutely stuffing your face with food all day long eating like &gt;5000 calories per day. So don’t feel too bad for them, they know what they’re doing and why people are watching them, and it isn’t because of their personalities.
---
Unless the scroll becomes dogshit cheap you'll be better off using welfare. Your dps wont sustain how expensive it'll be to use void for extended amounts of time lol
---
Yeah I would try the grand exchange and just announce publicly like "can some one show me where the anvil is" or what ever your question is someone may approach you or follow you and then talk to you. Try not to look at the chat box as much, and try to see if someone is talking to you with their over head chat. 
---
If no one wants to help you could hop world's or end up googling it. My only problem with googling is the information you are going to get is also going to assume you know a lot of basic other shit. A lot of knowledge isn't even really recorded or well shared because it's going to be useless to most people. So you're not going to know how to string a crossbow unless you knew you could make crossbows in the first place if you get what I'm saying.
---
We can tell you guides and show you stuff but it's not going to be the same experience. Sure you'll be playing the "right way" buy you won't understand why you do it that way In the first place and all the other dumb small stuff that makes the game enjoyable to some people. It's kinda just up to you to say oh this is fun, and then persue that. Once you feel comfortable you can start following guides and really "buckle down" 
---
A lot of this game has things that aren't fun to a lot of people and others only play that content. Just try to use what ever info people give you and just go do stuff.
---
Yeah issue isn’t just fashionscape; plenty of good skillcape perks going without use before max because full graceful is highly prioritized. 
---
Compromise: pay exorbitant amount of marks and GP plus hard/elite falador diary to imbue a skillcape perk into a graceful cape. Maybe it would change appearance too so you can fashionscape. 
---
Limited # uses of this perk before you’d have to recharge it with more marks. Only works for non-passive perks (teleports,item spawns). Making it work with passive skills seems really tricky.
---
That's funny, but it's not quite right. The knights have names that sound like real words but aren't spelled the same. This is spelled the same (The last name).

you dont NEED it very often, but its still nice to have
---
Meet me in the wildy fatty
---
Seriously. This doesn't even impact buyables either. You have some consumable fletching supplies that are mostly used in pvp, and are only available from pvm, three whole herbs, and a smattering of runes. Drop tables so OP! Gathering skills have never been, and don't need to be, great gp/hr.
---
i actually was able to find myself in the video as well \^\^ ty lmao
---
wyrms at 62 have a decent loot table, the big ones are dust devils at 65, kurasks at 70, skeletal wyverns at 72, gargoyles at 75, brutal black dragons at 77, nechryael at 80.
---
I would like to see OSRS start to go an MMO direction. The game feels really isolated and lonely right now.
---
Honestly graceful is hardly useful in the grand scheme of things. You would have to be doing an activity to where you never need stamina or energy pots with graceful, but would otherwise deplete without it.
---
For instance someone said they use it questing. If you are still using stamina, you could just get away with boots of lightness and a spottier cape and get the same effect. If you're not using stamina's but you also wouldn't use them without graceful either, once again it's giving you no benefit.
---
There are very few activities where full graceful is actually benefitted from.
---
OH NO NO NO NO
---
lower lvl houses have lower nest rates, to get 0 nests you still got unlucky though, but dont expect a ton until you get your hunter up. theyre still great xp though
---
That's called being a dick.
---
Fair point, but then you miss out on a pretty significant bonus of the dragon weapons.
---
And I definitely see your side about bouncing ideas off of other players. But sometimes this sub can be... a little rude about things like not using the BIS gear or min/max methodology of a pure/skiller. I just feel that if it is worth it to the person playing the account then it is a good idea, despite what others think.
---
I haven’t played since ~2007. And I was a member. There’s still so much shit I don’t even know where to begin.

You're now owning the merchers. These are already In the process of being dumped.
---
The big brains who set that set the price of these so high where selling their huge stock when they where like 15k ea, selling it to people trying to get in on the hype. 
---
Those people that bought it are gonna have it crash then end up selling them all for 3k ea when it will finally sell.
---
Emeralds are 182k xp/hr at 3.61 gp/xp while air battlestaves are 336k xp/hr at 3.08 gp/xp. Emeralds are a bit more afk but otherwise are soooo much worse. Big oof that you used emeralds for 6.5m xp
---
What's POH stand for?
---
It would die again and people would stop playing imo
---
If you think this doesn't happen in osrs you're delusional. Go to world 42 all over or w30 houses sometime
---
f2p gear already looks cool (this is a great drawing though)
---
Yes, people do it. It's good mining experience (80k/hr) and pretty afk for portions of the game. You can find teams with the volcanic mine discord.
---
How about apply graceful attributes to non-stat bearing gear?  I'm kind of tired of the skillet tuxedo TBH.  Why couldn't my gnome robes act as graceful?
---
Better be safe than sorry, I guess
---
Damn you're like a fashion scape expert. And crafting cape (t) goes nicely with the yellow set, whichever one that is

I can see what he means, still never heard back from jagex regarding my account being hacked. but that's okay, I've got classic WoW now.

No, I'm gonna leave it out since it's pretty obvious.

You need more green

They stopped being relevant once their jmod got fired from jagex and couldn't help them cheat, and steal accounts anymore.

If it literally takes 2 minutes then provide a source, else you're just throwing out random nonsense.

Op, is your name referencing killua?
---
most? Im glad you have 11 upvote supporters, I'd love to see your data on why MOST botters get banned. The staggering majority are unbanned. I can count on a single hand how many of my friends got banned I lost count of those that have gotten away with it. Oh I forgot to mention.   
---
Firemaking bots, Cooking Bots, Bow string bots are pretty much undetectable at this point. Its incredibly easy to have a bot set a dismiss random event pattern. Even easier to get the human mouse movements that are not detected even on the separate client.
---
Yeah I saw it immediately too
---
Thats pretty rough. I'm unsure if you'll be able to complete max point solos, but if you can its not that big of a deal. You just may have less inventory space because of extra food

Ring of suffering should be a priority over everything else.

Idk man. That sounds like a lot.

That's the whole point in "/s" existing. You can't convey sarcastic emotion from emotionless text. That's why emojis exist dude.

Because a lot of these really high exp accounts are actually hand leveled gold farmers.

I would personally build a pure. Anything you achieve on a pure is 100x more impressive. No one gives a shit about mains and their pets and inferno capes etc whereas you do this on a pure and everyone will admire you
---
Oh whoops.
---
No one calls them rares on osrs. Merchants obviously hoard them because they have an entire year to screw with the market until more supply is added into the economy. I'd say a semi-discontinued item is enough motive for people to buy.
---
I'm making this post so everyone is aware of the pump and dump and not to fall into the trap of buying them.

We all know that you get to enjoy that performance in whatever task you may do. Hell boot times are probably faster if you moved over from a standard HDD to something more modern.
---
Point being is there are always a bunch of small features that, that price point gets you that all add up and just make the experience as a whole great. Sure RuneScape maybe all you play, but some people are playing on some old toshiba laptop and didn't know they could play RuneScape and watch YouTube without chrome becoming unstable and freezing up sometimes.
---
Do this and make agility cape make stamina pots last like 25% longer when equipped
---
Not totally accurate.  It's best in situations where you're running, stop for a bit, then run again.

I was talking in CC earlier about having a transmog system like WoW.  It could be a really good gp sink.

UIM isn't more impressive, that's literally saying cause you torture yourself it makes you better than someone who achieved actual impressive feats like HCIM do. Fuck off and take your worthless white helmet with you. Nobody cares about UIM.
---
Bonds which would be much more expensive. I would quit.
---
Should be a 4 dose Stam pot once a day. That would be pretty okay just like the rest of the capes.
---
We pay we gay!

For everything except bank-standing and PvM, basically.
---
Stay with it. I just got my first firecape last night. 90 range and still had a tough time getting it. Ended up only tagging one healer and out dps’d the other three. It was a great feeling! Good luck!

They really need to just make it so each piece gives a percentage and the whole outfit gives an extra set bonus, I like the look of graceful without the hood but then it’s basically pointless

Say it takes you 30 hours to get the requirements for Rune dragons, and you spend 20 hours killing them; you have already profited more than if you did 50 hours of Wyverns. It’s worth the effort. My rune dragon alt makes around 1.6m per hour with very minimal attention.

Yeah! You're leaving out purple gloves, teal gloves, grey gloves...

Pretty sure youre mostly getting downvoted because you managed to miss both sides of the tryhard spectrum

Youre probably right about some/most of the downvotes, but by adding raids 1 to the list of non-snoozefest you also managed to miss the group of high end pvmers that wouldve been on your side otherwise

Questing for sure. Not only do you unlock a ton of useful things, you're guided through different areas of the world, taught the basics of bossing and all of the more unintuitive skills, and given decent amounts of xp and resources. I personally also love the quests themselves, but that's a bit of a different topic which not everyone agrees with.

Thanks for all the help guys I’ve now got the ring of suffering and it makes the trips so much less annoying!

It does change the odds but very slightly, so it's not worth complicating the calculations for such a small increase in accuracy.

If I understood correctly, ring imbues are staying at nmz, they're just offering an optional scroll through bh. Kinda like how the rune pouch was added to the slayer point shop.
---
If you are decently lucky its a nice boss. Normal drops are alright, and with the occasional unsired the profit should increase a lot. I do it a lot on my ironman, 1k kc and I still enjoy the few 50s sires every other task to try my luck!
---
I was on my normal account grinding for elites until I got burnt out. I felt motivated to create a HCIM so—so I did. I was on discord with a buddy of mine telling me there's no way I'll play this account for long. When we were memeing, I was spam click pickpocket in Lumby without looking at my screen and died.

I quit right after. The account is probably 8 minutes old lol.

After hearing about osrs last year I got membership (~~kid~~13-yo me was never allowed) and basically just quested my way through the game for a few months. Skilled a bit, but quests are more fun if your combat stats are too low. Read through dialogue, only used the wiki to figure out what items to bring (which is admittedly a big spoiler but tp-ing to the ge and walking back is no fun), overall had some of the most enjoyable time in a game ever. I see a decent amount of praise for osrs quests, but they're still criminally underrated.
---
Unlike in the real world where you're required (to a certain degree) to disclose your wealth, nobody actually knows your wealth in OSRS unless ofcourse you flex it often.  
---
Or if a JMOD just decides to screw you over somehow, in which case then I'd agree that its not the fault of the account owner.
---
It's useful for farm runs, quests, and zeah rc because they are pretty much the only activities involving both running around and standing still.
---
Spent like 2 hours yesterday farming yellow spice so I could boost my thieving to 85. I got the 85 boost like 3 times, but I got caught every time by the stupid elf, and was stunned for a few seconds which caused my boost to go down to 84 so I couldn't pickpocket.
---
By the fourth try I got it though, but the casket was only worth 214k
---
Seems overly complicated... You can just tab to the Rimmington portal on a House Party world and do the same.... Or get 86 construction and max your own house to use it on every world!! 
---
As for forgetting the tabs: can't count how many times I've forgotten the god damn staff... and even if I forget tabs, 1 law, air and earth rune is something you definitely have access to.

It’s BiS for any non-pvm situation where you have to run because in these situations there will always be a moment where you are not moving, making the passive effect increase energy faster than any other gear. More energy = running longer.

---
Graceful really isn't as good as you think. it only makes you recharge faster run energy when stood still, doesn't make you able to run for any longer than you would be able to at 0 kg. 
---
I think the ability for your run energy to recharge faster when stood still would be more than fair reward for 99 agility - which is so boring and time consuming.
---
Hello there
---
You mistake feeling bad and acknowledging bullying.
---
I could care less why they are doing it, more than likely they have horrible childhood trauma and eat to help cope with it. Since theres enough studies to prove that obesity always has a reason.
---
Im more worried that the entire chat is bullying them and that the subreddit is joining in on it.
---
Its disgusting and it just goes to show how vile and nasty people are.
---
You would think a game thats "old school" would have people that act like they are over 10 years old since most of them are in their mid 20s /early 30s.
---
imagine getting 99 in a skill just for the skillcape perk
---
Title: "I'm gay"
---
stop wearing graceful so much then. its not as useful as you think unless you're doing something that gives you time to stop and recharge your energy
---
Is that a ugthanki kebab?
---
If not then nothanki
---
No one should. But the perk is still a useful element of many skillcapes. Agi, con, craft are the big ones. Nerfing them by just making it a "buy it for all capes ever" isn't that great.
---
Get agility up first. The level effect translates to F2P, so even if you decide to drop back down, you have faster energy regen. 
---
Get a house and get your construction level up a bit - I know it's expensive, but it only takes about a mil to get to Lv.50, at which point you have a ton of useful things available to you, including the mounted glory and portal room; incredibly useful for getting around. 
---
It's a bit hypocritical of me to say, as I hate HATE questing, but definitely get some of the major quests out of the way. 
---
Fire cape.
---
Ava's devices.
---
After that, max the account, get the Quest Cape, Diary cape, Music cape, and Cape of Achievement. Have fun!
---
Oh, and don't forget to make about 5M every two weeks to keep the bonds coming... If you play just 2h per day, you only need to be making ~175k/h which is easily achievable. (Or have two alts funneling you cash... Better option)
---
Yeah, this fella gets it.
---
Tip: use dust runes
---
Mith seeds are used in pking, when you get frozen by a barrage, mit seeds will still force you to move over a square, so your opponent can’t hide under you and hide switches.
---
thats a weird looking camel
---
Well house offering occult altar means you can swap to lunars for the run and swap back to ancients / normals for slayer / pvp or whatever else you were doing.
---
I mainly use my mage cape / max cape to spellbook swap to lunars if i happen to be off it (which is only during certain bossing or slayer mainly).
---
I planned on training Att/Str by doing that, as long as I can.. if that's not enough im maybe going for Duo or similar
---
Yeh i just kind of wish the perk was able to be used more than once. As it stands its half the strength of a stam pot... once a day. It acting as a graceful cape is its main use haha
---
Not everything rare is valuable.
---
It'll save over 48 hours, seeing as though it lasts as long as two bonds.

What did he do?

it's not so much banning it because gambling is bad, but banning it because it's incredibly accessible for the kids and teens that play RuneScape. Teens could still access the online bingo sites but I think there are more hoops to jump through, it's easier to ask your parents for money to buy gold on RuneScape than it is to take their card to verify age on a bingo website.
---
300% more attendees than any of my 99s lol. Gratz on the 99 though!! Enjoy that teleport
---
"overpowered lmao"

The graceful set is useless. Such a perk wouldn't be overpowered at all, it barely has any effect.

Imagine not thinking in these terms.

Death runes are cuter.

If we were to add or move imbues anywhere, the Minigame Reward Shop would probably make more sense than any existing minigame. But while NMZ isn't the most difficult activity, it still is better than AFKing Castle War tie games for an imbue, which would be the best way if it were from Castle Wars. Also, Imbued Cape for the other gods wouldn't make sense; those gods have no ties to CW and the capes are linked the spells, so having capes for gods without spells wouldn't work for Charge.
---
Time has value too
---
3m a day easily with any of these methods less than 2-3 hours and can be done on mobile mostly afk. Looting in wilderness, mort myre fungus, wines from culimancer chest, making unfinished potions, farming ranarr, and being a runner for one hour in the essence discord is 4.5-7m an hour doing almost nothing.  Not all no reqs but most of these are near zero reqs that an account could have even casually playing for ~2 months.
---
Ehhhh. Kind of incorrect. If the first max hit rolls and misses the second hit rolls for the max hit and the next 2 hits scale down from that. So it can hit 40/20/10/10 or 0/40/20/20. The first hit that hits based off of your attack and their defense scales the rest of the hits.

99 marks is nothing for a perk like that. EASYSCAPE
---
I can't recall if it has 4, but if the first hit misses, the second can still continue. So instead of 40-20-10-10, you can do 0-40-20-20. And if the first two hits miss, the last two can hit 75% your max. And if the first three miss, the last can deal 50% damage. So the chance you deal no damage tends to be rather low...

Only advice I can give is keep trying and add as much relevant info as possible in to the recovery, I had one account which took me 10 tries over about a year until I got all the info correct and was Insta-accepted after being denied every time before that.
---
Yo if you really can't afford a party hat because of these merchers then reply with your ign and I'll hook it up with 50k so you can buy one in the GE.
---
I hope your offended by that because you're stupid if you think anyone cares about the prices of holiday items. If you can't afford one then fuck off to the chicken pens and make enough to buy one.
---
What a stupid suggestion.
---
They already dump so many of them that people are not even bothering to pick them up. But dummies like you need to understand that EVERY item can be merched, no matter the value or how many there is in Game. Bulk runes and feathers are being marched all the time.

Thanks dude! I got it now

I haven't died 20 times only like twice. People have done it with lower stats than me so i'm gonna do it! Might need get get a couple range pots first though

Yeah this is big brain time

I can't think of a nice way to say I think this looks bad.

Alright lets not make excuses for them
---
Are you telling me that bullying them on twitch and reddit is something you agree with? because if so I tihnk thats pretty fucked up and disgusting
---
What do you think I'd be hitting with that setup at 82 ranged?  I'm currently hitting 18s on task with imbued slayer helm.
---
SHUT IT DOWN the goyim know

As a member of Greek life as well it’s nice to see an actual description of it and not just “lol they pay for their friends and rape chicks” despite 99% of people that say those things only basing their opinions on media headlines and TV. Unrelated but I feel like I’ve met a ton of people in RS that were in frats
---
Are you trolling
---
Try adjusting your client size by just a bit, fixes the problem for me.
---
Please make your own account. You can afk these stats in a week or 2. What will end up happening is you will make this account into something and it will just get recovered and all your time wasted. Accounts can always be recovered by the original owner no matter what
---
Prif

It's pretty miserable as a main too.

afk nmz / redwoods

I would give advice but the person you bought the account from (most likely not your friend) is just gonna recover it in a couple weeks.

You should have said 20k, because then we could vibe to that message on your burger bag
---
Doing agility early is good but after fishing. 12 hours of agility with 48k xp/hr versus 12 hours with 18k xp/hr is a massive upgrade for 0 time training
---
ive found the mods from rs3 that came over to osrs care more about the oldschool feel than the new hires do. especially ash, reach and wolf. roq / john c are the main exception that are new and care about the feel.
---
MmmMmmm, I love the smell of new pasta.

I literally paid him 50 bucks for it. I asked him to get an account started for me and he said this was a good start but I have no idea what I'm doing or what quests and shit it needs. So thanks for the toxic reply. Very necessary.

negative weight counts as zero for the sake of run energy
---
this is true but any reason why overnight
---
not even mad jsut looking forward to another dry streak at cox
---
skill cape perks are already too good. no skill capes need to be buffed
---
If you have 87 slayer, Kraken drops them a bunch and it’s at least worth your time to try there in the other drops, too.
---
Some people like the game this way, it is just like real life. If you don't like it, ok, try another game.
---
Attack option
---
the agility cape is fine, no skill capes need buffs, they are already some of the most op content in the game
---
They have disbanded and rebranded. They run total world's in the wildy and make a lot of money offering protection and killing revs themselves.

---
minigame teleports were the first stupid thing added to osrs
---
home tele is mildly acceptable only because before it was added it was possible to trap yourself between obstacles and get stuck until a jmod freed you. and because of the 30 minute cool down
---
i do understand what that means, ironmen can't trade

Talk to your local optometrist

On a more serious note, this is another big loss. Thank you for the patience you had with us.
---
If killing bots and taking their stuff was possible, bots would be gone from runescape.
---
There's a reason you don't see bots in open world pvp games, they die.
---
We need to implement ways to kill bots, much like that YouTuber guy trapping them and letting they die of running out of food or anti poison
---
Imagine if his account was stealth and he just smashed out a ton of levels in a few days but only releases one level per week and reveals his max out of nowhere
---
all
---
Lmao
---
Thank you! I am :D
---
How much longer do we have? 
---
I do think if they can’t get the bot problem under control, the game is doomed. Mobile was such a good addition but they really screwed up allowing bots to ruin the f2p experience. Maybe there is no solution for Jagex, and it’s just the inherent problem of overly simplistic gameplay.
---
Did you? He is absolutely correct.
---
Blame the 1 IQ RS community who voted no to a new skill, which would have created a huge hype to OSRS. A lot of OSRS players are now maxed and bored, they are moving to newer games, such as WoW classics. OSRS will indeed decline, as most of us predicted.
---
Unless some drastic change happens, OSRS isn’t on track to die anytime soon
---
Good.
---
Jagex more than deserve it for their greedy business practices (MTX)
---
Absolutely no sympathy for them
---
Yes 100%. I was hoping someone else thought so
---
Important note: this is jagex offering info not them being singled out and investigated 
---
Hot take, they know the lootbox thing effects them less (direct item sales can replace the income on rs3, sub income is still bigger than this anyway) and are complying with offering some shocking numbers to get harsh laws down to hit their competition
---
Long blizzard?
---
??? You do know skillcapes already have perks, right? I thought you did but you're starting to make me doubt that. Why are you talking about fire capes?
---
There's many reasons why someone might decide to leave a job, including personal ones. Ultimately we don't know what's going on. Suspicion is fair though considering other mods leaving.
---
Already been off for over a year, thankfully
---
Meanwhile I have half that kc and only kill kraken because I haven't gotten a jar drop and the blank bothers me.
---
All the examples of harmful effects listed in the report are not provided by Jagex but by the governments own investigation. All Jagex provided was sources of revenue.
---
Literally gave my whole inventory away and still had 15m left over for shits and giggles, it literally paid for itself but it’s up to you to a.)let it pay for itself, or b.) Go bankrupt. And thank you!
---
The bot problem ties in directly with why player retention sucks. Early game money making is largely based around grinding resources which are heavily devalued because of the fact they're heavily botted. So the early game even more of a grind for newer players. They aren't willing to spend the money or improve though so I don't see there bot detection changing.
---
just curious what skills have you been doing that you couldnt wear your gnome robes

why? most skills dont need graceful if you want to wear something else just do it

I’m enjoying the teleport a lot, it’s really useful,considering I spend a lot of game time at the bank,and I’m always high as fuck questing/forgetting teleports.

Well I'm 24 but don't see myself playing in my 30s

I got some reddit booty for the angel that can hell me

Just let us combine any graceful piece with any cosmetic item to give it the graceful attributes.

I got first Kraken task yesterday. Pet, Tent, Trident, and 99 HP all in first ever Kraken task.
---
&gt; I mean....this is not some company you say "wow I wanna work here forever!"
---
No, but it should be. They've got one of the most cash-cowest games ever, which brought them record profit over the last year. They've got a team of dedicated nerds who are the game's biggest fans. They've got a community of hardcore enthusiasts who sink hundreds of hours per month into the grind and aren't afraid of providing non-stop feedback.
---
Jagex is the perfect example of butt-munching execs who can't help but ruin what would be a blooming game by paying people like ass.
---
if you actually played in 2007 a lot of people thought it was really dumb when it was released
---
Yes because the law that would be used against them isn't in place yet
---
No way you didn’t word it like that on purpose.
---
Lately i was doing endurance with overloads and absorptions, never used rockcakes. i cant remember the ones i usually do off the top of my head cause i just did some quests that added a ton of useless bosses to nmz.
---
That was something needed to combat all the RWTers. At least doing that the money isn’t going anywhere shady and they’re a bit different to conventional MTX. You know what you’re buying. That’s the main problem with the MTX they’re talking about. They’re all very slot machine.
---
Oh fuck i’ve been pwned 6 times apparently fuckkkk
---
more than my bank now lol
---
You're damn right they would, OSRS is going to be turning into Botscape soon like you've never seen. We need to push out new content for the bot playerbase. Bot nuke? Hell no dawg, all normal people will leave after they see the bot income in the next few months.
---
seriously, given that a lot of popular tasks can be automated to hell. Alching is literally just clicking in the same spot 999999 times until your magic number hits max
---
Well said. I feel op will come back eventually. Contrary to what he’s posting here about the game’s content sucking, there is something about it that keeps us hooked. I’ve come to his conclusion multiple times when fed up with the grind, quit for months, then inevitably come back. He just needs a break.
---
just get a samsung note and say your taking notes..

Was*. Now they’re wallowing in their cesspools where they belong.

Youre free to mention any content Ive missed in my rundown.

Otherwise I assume youre laughing at yourself trying to justify an untenable position.
---
Do RFD, the dwarf part to get rock cakes, alternatively you could use the locator orb from DS2 but I think you need RFD done for that one. 
---
But look on the wiki for a list of monsters to turn on/off for optimal xp rates.

Hell yeah, remove bot detection!! Let us all be maxed😍😍😍😍

I see what you mean but Cash Cow is the wrong term. What you described is a Star venture which should continue to grow, Cash Cow means it's had its day and now it's time to bring in MTX and milk it for all it has left.

They should poll raising membership costs just to keep Ash
---
I feel like Jagex is making more than enough to keep their current mods (I actually believe they make plenty more to hire a bunch more mods). Just looking at memberships alone, $11 per month is crazy for a video game as old as it is. Think 100k people are probably paying that... every single month and they probably cough out less than 1/10th of their memberships alone on salary.
---
Isn't MMG's new company trying to lure Jagex employees over there?

I didn't find it dumb but funny. The dude took time to do this artwork and you just threw this at him? Judging by your comment history you must be such a negative person both IRL and on the internet.

That's exactly what the Runescape 'franchise' has been for the last decade. RS3 is the original universe that has evolved over time, but it's not all "Runescape" is. Jagex has tried so many cheap spin-offs like Darkscape, Chronicle and now OSRS. If OSRS was a Star (it is not), they'd be concentrating the majority of their spending on it instead of keeping a team that is 3x larger on RS3.

Your levels are a bit lower so you are going to splash more. But you should be able to lill zulrah just fine. Sounds like you just need to keep practicing. You wont get kills until you learn the rotation properly and that just takes time.

I think it was more about grinding skills having no real incentive or motive. Most reqs are done in the 70s with only a few elite diaries with niche benefits being higher than that. Get all that and you were done. There was nothing motivating anybody to work on non combat 99s or maxing. Now there is. I like that. Skills should have uses relating to their skills 
---
It's things like crafting cape just being the fastest bank in game and con cape being the infinite "regen all your stats HP poison and spec and tele back out to wherever you need to be" that feel a bit out of place. I'd have preferred more themed rewards. But I do like rewards.

Agility is probably the least effort skill to do 'efficiently' besides perfect tick werewolf with alt. Doing tick perfect prif or ardy you'll probably maintain rates higher than if you choose to do lava runes to 99 runecrafting, which is much higher effort. I understand people think agility is slow, mind numbing, and getting 99 is a real hurdle for many, but let's be real here.
---
Agility cape doesn't need a buff, and graceful isn't as powerful as people think it is. Personally I still can't wrap my head around how OP skill cape perks are and how they are all baked into the max cape.  
---
&gt; Not every achievement needs a reward, the accomplishment itself is already rewarding enough.

There's no where to innovate except within the context of RuneScape. The skills you learn don't have a use outside of the bubble that is RuneScape for the most part.

I bet a lot of these guys are embarrassed that they're at the same level as people in other companies designing engines, and they need to say "sorry, that's engine work and none of us know our own engine".
---
I can definitely understand people not wanting to stay unless they love osrs in and of itself.
---
Perhaps, because OSRS is restricted in how it can grow and expand. I'd say the best thing at this point is to just ride this out because eventually we will all out grow the game and move on to bigger or better things (or IRL). 
---
I feel like OSRS will always survive on even if the Jagex Team has to down size as player count shrinks. Just enjoy it for what it is now and as long as you play it, don't think too much about the future.

Get ahrims and an occult you’ll kill zulrah eventually
---
That's been in place for years now, there's no evidence that they will implement more.
---
You're taking too much damage somewhere. Magic level? Are you getting hit by the special attacks?
---
This is definitely on you.  Last time I farmed vorkath I was getting 6-7 kills per trip with lower stats. I was actually not filling my entire inventory with food because it just meant dropping more food for loot
---
Slayer cape, runecrafting cape, magic cape, construction cape, crafting cape, farming cape, herblore cape, agility cape, maybe strength cape too. Those are the only ones I can see having any use alone. The rest are more or less pointless unless you're getting 200m in their respective skills. 
---
Like thieving for example. 10% more likely to pickpocket successfully? Pickpocketing isn't a good money maker, in what world is that ability useful? Firemaking cape, there's 3 other vastly easier to obtain items that do exactly the same thing. Ranging cape would be good, if it had the stats of the assembler/accumulator. But instead it just has their abilities, not their stats, making the assembler and accumulator vastly superior. Fishing cape teleports are good if you're going for 200m fishing I guess, otherwise just use your PoH. And the fletching cape, my god, could its ability be anymore useless? Grappling hooks are dead content aside from diaries, and it gives you three of them. They don't even sell for much. Cooking is like thieving capes ability but better, because you never fail instead of just a 10% increase. Cooking isn't that good a money maker however, so it still only helps with getting 200m (Which doesn't award you with anything, so as of now it's a pointless feat). Woodcutting is a ridiculous ability. In what world is woodcutting a viable method of obtaining birds nests, enough so that someone would woodcut past 99 for the birds nests? Again, unless you're going for 200m xp, probably wont be seeing much of that ability. Hunter teleports are almost useless as well unless you want 200m xp. Chins aren't that great money. They're ok at best, and 5 teleports to them isn't that great, seeing as they stack anyways so you don't need to bank. Defence cape could be better. Ring of life, not the worst thing, but for normal players (of which they are the majority), dying means almost nothing where the ring of life would save you. Because you have an hour to get back anyways. Really only helps HCIM and UIM. Hitpoints cape is okay, but are you really gonna use it over a fire cape or any other bis cape? Doubtful. Mining cape, yet another "only helps for 200m xp" cape. Prayer cape, is pretty good I'll give it that. But again, are you really gonna use it over a bis cape? Smithing cape, redundant. And finally, the attack cape. In what world does someone ever go back to cyclopes after getting their dragon defender. You're highly unlikely to lose it unless you get pk'd, even then, tokens aren't all that hard to get.
---
Max cape shouldn't be included in this argument, because it's literally all the skillcapes, so no matter what it's going to be vastly superior to just one of the capes.
---
TL;DR
---
Yes, some skillcapes are good. It's definitely not in the double digits though.
---
Double hides crystal shields.. the state of clanning
---
You gotta move away from the starting area. Lumbrige (starting area) only has a furnace. All the stuff that in needed in the game is spread out. Anvils are in varrock and north of falador. 
---
Furnaces are in lumbrige, desert, edgevile, and falador.
---
It is likely the area you are in is either only npcs(yellow dots) or bots that wont answer questions just doing a simple task. Real players are white dots on the minimap. Red dots are items.

Dont follow slayer music's guide for the boss fight. His great and set up do not work that well. Take brews and restores and a stamina potion and maybe a ranging potion depending on your level. There was a video on YouTube with a "poverty" set up that worked better than any tank set up I saw before. Used that video and got it right away after dying over 15+ times of using Slayermusic's set up.

If I recall correctly, RS3 MTX only work on a lootbox style system (buyings keys to open chests). So quite often it is gambling.

4 verteran mods leaving within the last 5 months. Mat K, Maz, Meadows, and Atlas. This does NOT look good for OSRS.

Its not about the stats, you can do zulrah fine at 75/75 , its all about practice. Switching correctly and standing in the right places to maximize dps.

You can, it's only the underground pass ones that were changed (think those were changed back too but idk)

28k/hr if i focus hard

yeah, but you gain way more dps by doing the fight correctly than by training few levels.

Idk about dks but I’ve been doing mass Giant Mole ffas. We usually have like 30 people so the kills are really quick and it’s good fun. Pretty good money, the cc is GiantMoleMass

&gt;This game is a like a cockroach—it doesn’t die.

And that's what we love about OSRS

I convinced a few of my brothers to play as well. Sadly we don't play as much as we used to
---
Ouch
---
&gt; OSRS is also barely worse than before the launch of Mobile so not in a bad shape at all.
---
Isn't the game, population wise, much better than it was before Mobile release? If I'm remembering correctly, the game gets 80k+ people at peek hours now, compared to 50k+ people before Mobile.

People stayed for Darkscape but when the JMods stopped updating the game and stopped talking to us for months people decided to begin leaving.  Several thousand of us stayed till the last moments to celebrate together a good time but were bitter at Jagex for treating a game mode like shit and beta testing us.  It was decieving. 
---
osrs at the least got the care it needs.  Some questionable updates here and there but overall I love it.  Ironman mode is what keeps me playing.  I just wish the heads of Jagex just got their shit together.
---
I still think Jagex needs to invest in OsrsHD.  2008 graphics to draw in more people as a toggle.  Sure dev time increases but with osrsHD it will force an entire rebuild of the game client to support more runelite features as well (toggleable).  Maybe provide an excuse to then ban 3rd party clients and go after cheaters easier.  But this is my opinion.

i don't think that many people are raiding, not even close really. 10% of players is a huge number
---
no it wouldn't, honestly I play the game pretty much solely to pk and I hate agility as much as anybody else but I actually would support agility making you run faster in the game no shit. I respect the autists who can click all day and it makes sense for the skill to be actually be rewarding. obviously the running would have to be scaled incredibly small but it adds skill as well keeping up with someone for freezes etc. I support a total agility buff.
---
That gear shouldn't work but holy fuck I love the look of it 😂

Make sure to ask in CC what gear they’re running. 99% of time it’s hides. Also make sure to spec bgs/dwh twice at the start of each kill. Otherwise you’ll get kicked.
---
Could you explain volume licensing keys a little more? What’s their purpose if they aren’t to be sold? And how do these people on eBay and Amazon get a hold of them?
---
So what is your explanation for them not adding MTX?
---
If the game is doing well and they don't care about people getting mad and quitting, we'd have MTX.
---
The reason is because feelings would cause them to lose a lot of customers.
---
If I'm just afk skilling like fishing or wc I'll do a kitten too. Doesn't really add much difficulty for a few free runes.
---
And then someone else pulls out the dragon claws.
---
28k at lavas? Maybe ZMI is the better choice.
---
Tight, thanks
---
Do ZMI
---
Yeah I’m sure Jagex are rushing to their computers, tripping over eachother and shit after reading that brilliant idea. Because if there’s anything Jagex is against, it’s making money.
---
are rock cakes needed? i have yet to do the watchtower quest or started rfd
---
interesting idea dont see how it could work tho, sense rc xp is already so low for just 1 rune seems like it would be dead content out of the gate unless you could do noted essense or multiple at a time
---
Focus really hard next time. I’ve been getting 60k+/hr and I think max xp rates are just above 70k/hr. Get better at banking quick, teleporting quick, and runectafting quick.
---
I’m doing ZMI kinda afk it isn’t too bad at all. I raid when I have time and then do ZMI when I can’t put all my focus on the game
---
You're actually a toxic waste of space.

Shaman mask, unique drop from Ogress Shamans. Pretty useless tbh, and are cheap as hell relative to their drop rate

British laws will disproportionately affect Jagex though, since they're basically the only UK-based MMO. I like the hot take, but I don't think Jagex is that farsighted. I think they're just trying to look like they're complying and helping as much as possible.

---
I really like this idea a lot but I am concerned about memory constraints. Jagex have already clearly intentionally limited the rune pouch to 16k of each rune which to me implies that the variable size is probably around 16384. There may be engine reason why one item wouldn't be allowed to have 26 different items attached to it with each items with a variable of 16384 attached to it.

The best f2p moneymaker is about 200k/h so you have to spend 22h very 14 days or about 2h a day just to maintain your membership.

During those 22h you will not progress your account in any meaningful way and you will not have much fun.

If you don't want to pay, you should most likely continue playing f2p and decide if you want to go p2p once you have exhausted most of the f2p content.

I messed up with 99 hp and list my untrimmed crafting cape, still hurts to think about :(
---
I meant that this will affect Jagex in some aspect (changes to the mtx, which could mean less money spent on RS3 and possibly its reputation). If less money is earned, the investors can look to other methods/mtx options (possibly Osrs). 
---
Note: We all know it will hurt Osrs to add mtx, however we are not the ones who will be making the final decisions about this topic.
---
Well at the end of it you have the money dragon unlocked so at least you have that to look forward to! I was terrible at bossing when I did DS2 but it worked out with some patience. Good luck!

I made about 2mill gp. I got there in the final hour

if mtx get removed, it might revive the game to a certain extent

Go take a shower man. Clean your room too or something

Well if the uk parliament decides, it has to. Or be banned from uk players. And the other side of the hardcore fans are ironmen, cause TH mtx doesn't affect us.

The recent update to LMS has been a big success in terms of its popularity and how fun it is to play. However, we have also just seen all but one possible future reward fail a poll. For the long term health of LMS, and to motivate players new and old to play it, there needs to be both worthwhile rewards, and new game modes (such as pure/zerk modes).
---
What steps are the Jagex team taking to ensure the longterm health of LMS? And can we ever see worthwhile rewards while the polling system is set at a 75% threshold?
---
Feelsbadman. 
---
The amount of times this has happened both while fishing and Wcing is soul crushing. 🥳

Yea... Or maybe we don't need to go for these ridiculous conspiracy theories... Because maybe people who have worked in the same company and on the same game for 15 years just want a change of scenery.

Can you make Brimstone keys have a High Alch value (100 or so?) so that we will be notified in the chatbox on loot drops?
---
I have loot notification set to 1gp and didn't see my key pop up on mobile.
---
It's actually quite easy, if you have autoretaliate on you don't need to click the monster again just alch after your attack animation, it's like prayer flicking. I mostly did it while slaying in multicombat areas so there's usually always a monster to retaliate on to.
---
When divine potions expire, could they state what type of potion they were (super combat, ranging, etc)? It's annoying when using multiple that you have to check which expired if you have forgotten which you used first.
---
Will effect any lootbox mechanics of games that want to operate in the UK not just MMOs
---
Hitting the pocket of all their gaming competition like FIFA probably isn't bad for Jagex
---
Mod Meadows over at the RS3 team also left the company just now. 
---
So many mods leaving.... I'm not trying to make bad assumptions... but what is going on? It just feels weird that so many leave so fast. Almost like there's a bad storm upon Jagex and us, the players.
---
55 agi, so? It's not like I need more atm
---
I don't even bother
---
Yeah I know
---
I understand the "I don't want to spend IRL money (especially on a game)" mentality. I used to think this way and most people that join the game for the first time do too. You're free to do whatever you want, of course, but I want to explain the rationality behind spending $11. If you don't think it's worth it still then that is completely fine!
---
It'll take you like a month to build up enough gp for a bond at current prices, and even then, that'll land you 2 weeks of membership play-time. Instead, you could work for 1 hour (probably less) for $11, get a full month of membership, and be gaining xp and making money at double the rate (hours of time saved).
---
It's all about how much you value your time. Not only that, if you buy a bond, you'll be out 5m. That's a lot of gp that can be used to progress your account.
---
Now that's attention to detail.
---
Nothing really offends me to be honest. But I’d rather not have one of my favorite games devolve into a repugnant cesspool.
---
I like how you cut out the fact that the other dude directly replied to the post of most west.

I guess team capes, item setups, and if you're in a clan I assume you get used to the names indeed.
---
Even though these things might be the case, I'm sure some friendly fires have occurred
---
Jagex was called out ***by name***  by parliament regarding their predatory MTX.
---
 OSRS players think they will not be eventually monetized. They are wrong. Jagex tried it with the recent partnership deal and they will try it again in other ways until it works. This is especially true with new players coming into the game from mobile who don't understand Jagex's history of monetization, and don't understand the spirit of OSRS. They will be able to vote too. And if enough of them are willing to spend money in game, Jagex will make that happen. Even if it's under the guise of "Integrity Updates."
---
I enjoy RS3 very much and it's sad seeing it go down this path. I know OSRS players hate the game but the RS3 playerbase is extremely friendly, kind, and helpful. All they want is a better game just like anyone else. They've seen how MTX has killed other games and they are sad that it's happening to RuneScape right now.
---
I know a lot of you probably don't care about RS3 but the truth is, we are all Scapers. We all love this game and we should all be looking out for each other. . It may be in our better interest to help RS3 instead of saying "Good riddance" or "They asked for it." Because odds are...we are next.

Any update on GPU rendering for the actual client? Mobile runs much better than players PCs. 
---
It would be much appreciated as the base client runs and looks like it’s from 2004.( I know it was)
---
1. In LMS, after getting a kill you are granted with a short immunity from attacks. Could this also make you immune to the fog? After a fight in the fog you often get a disadvantage going into the next fight, especially if you want to loot the player.
---
2. Could the run energy be restored after trouble brewing games? If you want to play again immidietly you’ll have like 30%.

Memorize names is what I rely on. Mostly memorize names of your opponent as you're constantly attacking them day after day for months. Purple dots on the minimap indicate your team as well as team capes but team capes aren't used much at all.

They previously stated (with amusement and quite emphatically) that it will not get any form of buff.  It gets you instantly to a fairy ring and they are confused why this is seen as underwhelming

---
Can something be done about stat restoration?  
---
Currently it's way too easy to get back to full health/prayer.
---
I suggest removing stat restoration from Clan Wars and moving every tier of POH pool down one level, and then letting us "imbue" it with the Desert Amulet 4.  
---
This would reward players who play the game more.
---
They're emigrating to countless cities and fighting for survival yet your PRIORITY mention was a FUCKING GAME. Judging by your attitude I'd wager that 99.99% of the Venezuelans are much more pleasant than you will ever be.

I have a similar setup and paid the same. I paid too much for my GPU though. All new parts on Amazon so I didn't shop around for the best deals.

That is a false statement.

Have fun running the same dungeon with no mechanics required as end game content.
---
Some barrage tasks break even/profit. And before that the slayer meta was pretty much cannon only which is eypensive, dont know what you're talking about. Only thing that really changed is that you get a LOT more xp/h regardless if you invest money into slayer or try to profit.
---
Whether you realize it or not, you do. This is not a native functionality of the osrs app.

Good, I would gladly put money into a game I love
---
Can someone other than Mod Wolf tell us why the new BiS helmet should come from yet another Slayer monster?  
---
His responses on Twitter (Saying people voted it in with it's current stats) are wrong, people would have voted in a lesser version of the helmet but it was either no helmet or new BiS for new BiS sake.

Please can we have a bank organising tool? I find it really difficult to organise my bank and if there was a button that did it for me that would be great!

Depends when you built it tbh. If you built it this year like this dude then that's a genuinely awful price. This is like a 75hz 1080p set up. For 1.2k today you could have a 144 1440p set up easily
---
dark wizards, specifically the lv 20 in the wizard's circle south of varrock
---
Got it.
---
Absolutely. The whole place is just surrounded with toxicity, and it destroys motivation to play from a lot of people who partake in it - both winners and losers.
---
Just because no one is saying anything in game doesn't mean they don't like it. There's no one for them to tell in game because the auto-typers can't hear them, and once the player isn't in that area anymore, they forget about it

I have a job that allows me to work from home and have been playing pretty faithfully since 2014, 5 years is enough to max even playing very casually and its not hard to play more than one account at a time.

I was way late to the Zulrah attempts and didn't try until after doing things like DS2, firecape, and about 500 demonic gorillas.  90 mage and 80 range or so. I got it in two attempts.
---
I thought Galvek and Jad were harder, maybe because the stakes were higher. With Zulrah I can just get my stuff back for free and I don't have a BiS or Quest on the line. Not to mention I already had the practice managing prayer, eating, and switches.
---
If Zulrah is the first crack at real PvM (because people advised a noob to just grind Zulrah for cash), I can see 100 attempts is realistic.
---
The voice, the name, screenshots of chats, reading descriptions of the bots that match what they're saying, other people in Reddit referring to the bots, etc. There is no doubt that they're referring to Sammich's bots.

Besides reading the names in the update posts I don't think you can pinpoint the date he left just by reading the posts.

Auras, not p2w. Can't buy loyality points. (don't even start with premier club, cause it's way cheaper than buying 1 month at a time) And legendary pets are not that p2w, have had mine for ages, haven't used it after i got yak. And you got one from having a twitch prime at one point. Everyone had it.

I actually don't like this idea. But I do want more things to use the marks of grace for

The only people who say incels are other loser neckbeards maybe if you didn’t spend 18hrs a day on Reddit you’d have a halfway decent runescape account.
---
Could the Zulrah/Vorkath/Grotesque Guardian/Hespori/Hydra item holding if you die mechanics be changed so you need the 50K/100K to get them back?
---
Auruas buddy, the boosts from them are essentially required for endgame content.
---
They didn't poll MTX you absolute imbecile
---
20m slayer xp never seen a heart or gem.
---
Yeah that can be a major factor. Especially a 144hz with freesync which could easily be 200/300 for the cheapest models. 
---
Thing is this dude has stock cooler, mid range case with a mid range MSI mobo, an LCD monitor without freesync and a budget bronze PSU...
---
He got absolutely ripped off beyond belief, don't really care about getting a few downvotes for it. Rather save myself 700 quid and get 12 downvotes
---
You are right an people are downvoting you lmao. Mobile was a great update.
---
So with absorb pots, the rock cake lowers your hp , let say all the way down to 1, so now the monsters max hit is only  1 on you , taking only one point of your absorbs and in turn having your pots absorb last much longer
---
I didn’t say you could from the news posts, just that people felt he responded well by making changes on update blogs. 
---
I do however still feel we lost a lot in regards to his reddit posts
---
Its1/3
---
If you rock cake down to 1 hp after overloading, the max you can get hit for is a 1. So it takes 1 point of absorption away. If you were say 20 hp, you could get hit for a 20 which takes away 20 points of absorption. Lower health == longer absorption.
---
I think you lured one into me yesterday. You tele'd before I could tell you to go fuck yourself
---
Just here to say I was here in case this comes true in the future. Hope not though
---
This would be the second thread today where someone didn't realize they needed extended super anti's when using DHCB. 
---
Mage attack should hit max of 9, only damage you take is from mistakes and the odd high hit. 3 kills is what you get with basic protection, 3-7 is what you get with super antifires.
---
Surrendered? Ha! No way. Of course you people would believe that. It’s all fun and games until Hitler finally leaves his secret Argentinian Nazi bunker and commences taking over the world with the help of his aging generals ushering in an age of world domination under the Fourth Reich.

Definitely more cost effective to use an MSB(i) with mithril arrows or better, rather than dragon darts + blowpipe during the waves.
---
Sounds to me like you aren't safe spotting the ads during the waves, I recommend using Italy rock. You could try to tank everything, but it's much better to not take damage. Wouldn't recommend flicking, just camp those protective prayers.
---
Underrated comment.
---
I'm honestly very proud of the community for not killing the messenger for that response. There seems to be a lot of respect for Mod JD, even if they aren't happy with what he's saying.

Wait I actually love this bit of “lore”
---
Drop rate for 99hp?
---
Use runelite and enter dev mode
---
I can confirm that it works with the free version as well. I use a bluetooth mouse however, so no dongle converter is needed or used. But you still have to hold the left mouse to right click, which is a pain.
---
LMS is already getting a bit stale. Is there any plans to make it sort of a rotating game mode? For example, for 2 weeks the stats and items are set for a max pure, then next 2 weeks it’s set for a different pking account build. Thoughts?

You shouldnt need that many prayer potions, maybe only 2. Bring one magic potion, since you do more damage with mage. Get the agility level and use the shortcut to lower attempt costs. I did it even with the worthless summer pie in my inv.

You realize it’s mostly westerners who BUY gold from gold farmers, thus sustaining the RWT market right? So in reality they’re the ones “ruining” the game as you say. 
---
Also, you’re honestly incredibly naive if you believe that it’s ONLY South Americans who bot and sell gold. There are massive communities of English speaking botters and gold farmers, but yes continue to blame one faction of people for everything because of your personal bias against them. It is much easier to villainize someone when they are different than you, isn’t it?

What’s the deal with the death mechanics? I started my account in late ‘17 and only found out about six months later that the death mechanics were different than I remember, and you have an hour to get your stuff. 
---
I was then looking at the wiki and it appears that it was changed and reverted a few times, and then there’s a link to a twitter post from mod ash saying it’s a temporary fix to prevent DDOS attacks but that was four years ago. Was this polled and if not, do people actually prefer it? 
---
I get that it makes bossing easier because you can always bring BiS and untradeables and never have to worry but didn’t the risk make it more... satisfying? Tense? Meaningful? Just want some opinions.
---
You do realize that 70k people is literally a nothing amount. I'd easily believe that all 70k of those people don't have lives.

If they would just fix that stupidly laggy right click
---
Being able to customize the time for a right click would be perfect and fix a lot of problems with mobile. Basically any activity that you have to right click decently often is just really tedious on mobile

---
I 100% recommend starting as a member if you're an experienced player. Quests like the waterfall quest, fight arena, tree gnome village, and the grand tree can boost you to 40+ combat straight from level 3, so you get to jump straight into rune instead of trying to kill cows for a significant amount of time.

Taking advantage of members features like this can really make the early game grind a lot easier.

You'll easily find many opinions if you just search the sub for the topic.
---
Personally I have nothing against the new mechanic (except maybe the duration). I would go so far as to say it is necessary with how bad the servers can be. I do miss those nostalgic moments of seeing someone die to a random event and everyone piling on the tile to try to loot their stuff, but it would get old pretty fast losing everything because you lagged for a couple ticks and got 1 shot by a boss.
---
I do think however more risk can be implemented, and that's what they try to do with instanced bosses like zulrah/vork/GGs/hydra etc. but I think the price to collect is too low.
---
They can link an Imgur post for you to look at.
---
probably mugger or ur mum
---
No problem! Just incase someone didn't know
---
Yeah I'm having just a hard time keeping my cool, because of the knowledge that if I f***up I have to do another 45m of fight caves before I can try again
---
I had the opposite weirdly enough. Vorkath offed me about 3 times learning his mechanics, I honestly couldn't kill the mith/addy/rune dragon before running out of food and failed and teled out 3 times before I just cheesed them by standing under them. Galvek though I did on my fist try. Didn't even use half my food. His mechanics were just a lot simpler to me.

I’m pretty sure msb (i) is way better dps because with amethyst bolts, it’s better than full armadyl with acb and diamond tipped dragon bolts.  There’s no way it would be worse than effectively addy bolts with addy arrows.

Can you do this on mobile?
---
It's time.
---
OSRS has been out since 2013, plenty of time to get 2000 total. Especially now with mobile, it's easier than ever to AFK. I stand by my opinion that anyone can get 2000 total pretty easily. I only had base 70s and a couple 99s when I got 2000 total.

Currently the hydra mechanic is that hydra must be on the vent before the chemical comes for it to be weakened. Is there any chance the team could look at making it be able to be weakened if it’s walking into the chemicals as well?

It’s such a noob trap. Can’t even augment it making is useless compared to normal. Gonna suck for people that whale on it only to find it to be useless

How do you explain his wronged ban? How many other people have been falsely banned? Out of those, how many people did you guys take seriously and look into? And out of those, how many actually got their account back? I know people say this in an outlier case, but if it happened to one, I am sure it has happened to others. Do you know if Jagex has any plans to revamp the appeal system?

KMS/KMS38 is still a decent solution but I’ve had issues with it. HWIDGEN is relatively new and since it generates a key tied to your hardware in the same way that Microsoft would do legitimately, it basically is a legit key for all intents and purposes. It’s pretty cool.

I’ve never gotten any duplicate pet rolls but I’m pretty certain you don’t get any extra actual pets, the number of rolls shows up in your collection log and it tells you that you “would have been followed” but unless you had died with your previous one and had yet to reclaim it, you wouldn’t get the actual pet drop

Based on his previous posts/comments, it seems to me that he tried to log onto one of his old accounts which he found out was disabled. He tried to appeal but got a reply stating “Too bad, Make a new account”.  Now, since he’s pissed, he’s showing “proof” that botters/gold farmers have the ability to get around bans. All of this is speculation given OPs lack of context and grasp of the English language. That’s why I ended my sentence with a question mark. Because I have no clue what the hell this guy is saying.

Are you using the runelite experience tracker? Open the interface on the right side and reset your experience tracking. Otherwise it averages over a super long time and makes your xp/h look super low.
---
You wont need 90 jherb if u do tekton or muttadile
---
I just ran some quick DPS calcs for myself against fire giants (what the guy from that MSB post the other day used). With my normal setup (pretty basic w/black dhide), rune cbow with broad bolts is just barely better than MSB (i) with Addy arrows. MSB (i) with rune or amethyst arrows is significantly better though.
---
I used to use it a lot before I finished my POH. It's faster than the portal and doesn't reset boosted stats. If I'm already at full health, I just walk to the altar instead of the portal.

And here you come along giving it more visibility.

then go buy BiS armor, thts the next step there really isnt an inbetween.

go to the armor guy on the outskirts of the GE and go buy whatever you want really, not much info in your post so other than BiS melee (which is what that guy can show you) idk what to tell you
---
what clan did you lead
---
Oh very much so. IIRC they randomly pick preset numbers, and have various winning numbers like 62-71 replaced with losing one's and different combinations beteeen bots, and winning numbers can be disabled and enabled.
---
Got the gem real quick too. Less than 10 foes for sure after unlock. 
---
I hate to show off this luck but it happened late at night, my gf was asleep and I have no one to talk about the game with lol
---
They definitely wont have that info but there are old threads where you can find a general number. Iirc its very very low.

There's also a reason Microsoft isn't even trying to hunt them down, they don't mind the free advertising and Windows probably isn't the bulk of their profit anymore.

**Account is autoclicked, received a bot busting ban, owner did appeal, 1-2days later he received good news. a news no1 did expect.**

**Jagex removed/quash the ban with god knows what reason but it just confirms that its a 50/50 chance this also means for people who really were not to blame for their ban.**

**Pretty sad that jagex isn't even taking people their appeals serious enough, 10/10 costumer support for a million company. $11**

Yes +4 str bonus on bcp +5 on prims. Prims also have a slight accuracy bonus.

Earlier in the year I created a series of only be allowed to play in an area that has a raid. This means I’m currently locked to just Zeah and Morytania but it also allows me to have new areas to explore in the future if a raids 3 or 4 are ever released. 
---
When I made the video last year I tried something new with a really long video. I decided to shorten this to the more standard 12-18 minute long videos. 
---
At the end of the first episode I finally made my way into Morytania (as it has pre-reqs to get in to). I also have some XP lamps and am thinking of putting them into Hunter. This will allow me to level Hunter doing Pisc favor. I see no reason why I shouldn’t add them to Hunter. What other uses could I put the XP lamps into?

Hi, I'm a new player and I was reading a guide to do quests in member:  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal\_quest\_guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) 
---
It suggests that I use a house (from other players?) so I can TP and do things much faster...  
---
The question now is: do we have to be in the same word to join his house? The house party world is from US, I'm from EU... So bad ping if I wish to do general questing and play in that world.
---
(I'm new player, currently I'm running around alot, I can't afford an amulet of glory, I'm already grinding hard to get 100k/day...)

I remember learning how to take screenshots from the RuneScape guide book in like 2007 lol

Why does it seem this boils over every now and then and eventually dies back down, all the while the MTX continue to get worse? I stopped playing RS3 initially when they removed free trade, came back when it was restored, then again when EOC came around. Tried it for a bit and didn't like it, felt like a completely different game. I don't have any hatred for the RS3 community but for the developers and management who fucked us all over but at the same time it would be bad for OSRS in the long run if RS3 were to die. 
---
Personally i can't see MTX ever making it's way into OSRS and the players mobile has brought in wouldn't be nearly enough to sway the vote towards allowing MTX.
---
Still wouldn't be used much/at all. 4 (3) does potions would be worse than 3 (4) dose and a brew

Wow I’m level 55 on my first character and I haven’t done any dungeon more than once yet

but jagex sees that which game has more users in members.
---
I want the woodcutting one so bad.
---
Yeah they're toxic af forsure. I'm with a rev protection clan and Everytime they have the numbers to clear us, Im_sobeast has to go to edge and spam "pm Im_sobeast#9999 to spy" like if you have to come back in rag/1 item to win a war you've lost. Sv always does the same thing. The moment they start losing they call rot. I'm guessing sv is paying rot to ally with them.
---

---
Wait... 88%? I’ve been getting 86% ._.
---
It's not that, it's just that I gain *nothing* out of an NPC telling me to go to Elvarg's lair, going to Elvarg's lair, then realizing I need to go back to the bank to grab my pickaxe. It seems like every quest has 10 of these scenarios.
---
It's where all my money has been going.

What about cow...? Which were in the game long before? Or are we only counting bosses?

I think doing medium clues is fast for elites as the 4th highest elite clue completionist is the 1st highest in medium clues. Might get lucky and get some rangers too.

Can the 1/10k dropchance for dragon harpoon from off-task wyrms be increased? For ironmen in particular it feels really bad having to rely on getting the correct task while still being 1/2k on-task.

Frankly, it's long overdue for it to reach this point.  There's like 3 people left playing RS3, and all the revenue comes from MTX.  Why would they bother developing real content?  Just give all content dev resources to OSRS.
---
I love you 3000*

Thanks for explaining it. Very clear as it wasn’t before.

5. About to start NMZ training

Uhh, since this hasn’t been answered in a very obvious way, runelite has a plug-in that allows you to see your clan mates’ names or even hide your cc members

Hmm interesting, I don't see an elite clue as a reward from the medium clue casket though?

lava dragons in the wild, barrows is a slower alternative if you DONT want to go in the wild

His shit is top tier. His numbers could be replicated yes, but the shit he posts is hilarious if it’s on purpose or if that’s just genuinely how he is. It feels weird to say but I think I’d miss him if he got banned
---
you cant get elites from mediums
---
skilling for GP just kills itself though.  If suddenly there is a new method to make something for more GP, then that will get botted until the price comes down to barely any profit, if at all.  We used to have bots that made bow string all day,  then they added ways to get bowstring without flax, and bots moved somewhere else.
---
I’m sure some botters have created IM accounts thinking it wouldn’t get banned as easily, then drop trade profits over to a mule

I was gonna say the same thing lol. It's a venny gold farmer not a pker. They'll bolt you if you come to their world's but they're definitely not pkers. Vennys never know when to bank either, such juice from them. Plus about 100-200 dbolts cuz they must not understand what an Ava's does.

Can the "inspect" option on an herb patch be changed to let us see what the herb patch is? I'd assume it originally didn't display this info because herbs were unidentified, but now that herbs are grimy, there's no real reason to hide this info.
---
Guess so, that's a good point. I'm currently sustaining membership with bonds and I was wondering if I was at all contributing to MTX in OSRS by doing so. I would definitely pay 11 dollars a month if it's for the good of the game.
---
I got into a frat from the college thread posts here lol

 Both +4 strength, advantages to BCP are higher melee and range defense bonuses and a prayer bonus

I'm 800 dry without a unique rip

---
I mean most other frats are full of absolute fucking dickheads but there are the cool ones

---
Considering zulrah is the most killed of any npc in the game, it’s fair to assume that it is at least in the top few player killers. The vast majority of players who continue to play do not die to low tier monsters

It's not about a drag, it's also about equality and love.

The whole game is luck itd be no different lol. People get thos same pets at level 5 and some people go past 50m xp in a single skill there is no dedication/grinding aside from the people who get unlucky not saying i want some ugly golden pets walking around just dont see how itd be any different

Are Ironmen unable to purchase mtx in RS3?

Thank you for info, we're all very much out of the loop on this side so is useful!

Torva is pretty meh now in terms of the meta but it is by far the best nondegradable gear. Also you can solo nex easily. And yeah, you can get it from what's essentially just a loot box of a bunch of items. Can you get it for free? Technically. But definitely buyable.

---
I got the talisman around 70kc at lizard shamans not sure if that’s good or not?
---
yea most pets are luck, but if you really want a specific pet you can grind for that pet, and its realistic to get it. by far the longest grind for a single pet is kacy and the bloodhound, but hes very unlucky, and bloodhound rate is very dumb to start with.
---
with this, no matter how bad i want a shiny corp pet it will never be realistic to grind for it, it will take on average more time than getting 200m all, making a new account and getting 200m all on that account aswell.
---
You should still show off your dedication/grinding on basic pets, but also you can show that you get extremly lucky and out of your 7 pets collection you got one shiny/golden. 
---
Why every content has to be completeable? Pets are mostly about that feel when you get one so why not to get even more excited when you get lucky version of that pet.

It sounds awful on mobile theres a terrible ear-destroying note hour-long note near the end of the song. You can kinda hear it on PC but it's so loud on mobile.

Can Volcanic mine get an update to influence players to be active into playing the mini game? To be able to get an active team you have to resort to joining the discord to find people willing to join and that can be undesired by many players.

Black desert online, tera, and archeage are all games with optional subscriptions (like rs3) that I can think of off the top of my head with p2w cash shops. Technically world of warcraft and osrs have p2w models if you count wow tokens and bonds since those can get you ingame gold which can help you progress through the game.

People only use torva to make t92 armour now. Masterwork armour t90 is lots cheaper to use.

Heh I did fear a reply of that type, but I decided to be honest about it anyways.  Considering the NPC's are already there and that this is already their purpose, it just seems to make sense.  Thanks :)
---
God dammit. Now I have to go do that elite that's been in my bank for 3 days.
---
Sawmill Operator or Perdu.
---
It’s not inane. It devalues his achievement. It’s like playing a sport or e-sport and climbing to the top only to learn half the people there cheated. It feels unfair and ruins the experience.
---
if they had a quest that brought a rogue banker here, I would always bank skill here.
---
Wtf lmfao are you seriously trolling me or something? I'm not about to go on with this shit so we can just agree to disagree from here on out but I can't believe how small minded you seem about this situation.
---
Just because I used black people as an example you think that I truly believe black people are the only ones that have been victims of racism and oppression in the past? Idk where you jumped to that conclusion but it's delusional to say the least.
---
And I'm not talking about some big bad racists jerks saying some mean words to you that you think you're too big for racism now. I'm talking about actual violence, profiling, discrimination, and biases because of a person's race. With the examples you've given me it's hard to believe you've ever been a victim of any of these things.
---
You think just cause some racist said some naughty words to you that you are now enlightened on how to stop racism?
---
I'm not even going to comment about your views on the civil Rights movement or whatever you think would be happening today if there wasn't one.
---
 Also, if you're just talking about people saying racists things online or whatever then I agree with you. I don't think people should react to those types of people because they are obviously edgelords who are doing it to get a reaction out of people. But racism is far more than just that, and I don't think you can see beyond that.
---
I think the next major update needs to be offline, downloadable mode. Even if they charge. I want to be able to play this game for a long time and it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to at this rate.
---
75 def nh kr even main nh you can hits 0s off pray all day and 30s on prays.

I was killing 2 skeles and a worm, is that correct? not sure which gives 86.8 on the dot
---
Because there are.
---
Any other RS3 players lowkey disappointed that they pretty much copied the quest word for word from Plagues End?
---
You don't have to pick up the pet.
---
Probita is an NPC located in the small building next to Aemad's Adventuring Supplies.. Probita runs the pet insurance bureau, and will insure a player's pet at a one-time cost of 500,000 coins per pet. If a player loses their pet, and it is insured by Probita, they may reclaim the pet for 1,000,000 coins.
---
Because models behave so differently. Everything is not just one model. It's much safer to check every npc that can appear here, manually and make sure scuba is correctly applied. Than to make a general code to add scuba to everything. I can't believe this is not common sense to you? But maybe you haven't been around as long as some of us. Yet you have the audacity to voice such a retarded opinion when you know you're new? Don't speak again please.

Damn bro I felt bad just reading that. If you ever see him again give him the cash and maybe some futa pics.

Just do separate trips. You're trying to force something that's going to take 5 minutes. If you die it takes 20 extra minutes

Let's not be hasty
---
If you hop worlds, it's actually good smithing xp. just sayin'
---
"Extreme Alchemy" - Provides 150xp/cast, for low alch GP, and a heavier cost. 
---
Becomes the new alchemy meta, providing less gold into the economy than high alching, and costing more. Would be effectively 180k xp/h, though there should be a sufficient cost to offset this.
---
and maybe we should update bronze to rune armour so it looks straight out of an anime 🧐🤔
---
Can the Drake's fireball attack charge the DFS? It doesn't charge it at all, despite the DFS partially protecting from it.
---
PVP'ers are a really fragile breed aren't they. They're toxic AF when they are attacking you 3 on 1 whilst you do a clue scroll risking 5k, then they cry like little whiney babies when people vote no in their little polls. It's simply karma.

You won’t make money before level 65 slayer anyway. But definitely work on range and magic. You want to be able to safespot to save money on food

If you don't mind leaving your desktop on your whole shift, id recommend just running runelite at home and maintaining nmz with a remote access app. That way you can lock your phone or use the GPS without it disconnecting you.

Have you pked??? Bolts hit through pray all day. Pull up rev caves in like 150k bolt rag risk and zgs. Take a couple bois with you and youll see what i mean. Ot take 14 brews, bolt rag with ags/gmaul to rev ent and bolt rag a single pker down through pray.
---
Also in def pking you can hit 0 off pray all the time because defence rng

They're equal afk.

You just had to use bronze armour didn't you. Racist pig.

Killing the lesser demon in Wizards' Tower and telegrabbing the chain were the good old days
---
I'd suggest you level fishing to 58 and then try barbarian fishing.
---
Not even at drop rate

Yeah i realize i need a decent amount of slayer to profit. Just wanted to figure out which stats i should be training while i’m still in f2p.
---
Other ones I was considering.
---
AlKarhid gate guard.
---
Lumbridge General store.
---
Brimhaven dungeon toll.
---
No, just tested it.
---
Honestly, I feel bad for skipping through it because of the time devs spent on it but st the same time, I've never enjoyed questing. It's just a chore to me.
---
Your "statement" does nothing to address my point: a total of 50,000 experience in a skill should not be the line in the sand for surviving in this game.

I watched some of that meeting that was referenced in the shitty response from Jagex. Besides all the disingenuous answers, there were two things that I laughed at most:
---
1) when asked why osrs doesn't have MTX, they gave a long winded answer which essentially stated the community would destroy the company if implemented (they also stated that 2\3 of their income stream is through subscriptions, the other third through "additional services" such as MTX etcetera). Go us!
---
2) when asked why they have a 6 hour log. Oh boy this one was funny because the questioner was rather blunt. "Why do you even have a timer at all?" he asked. He was obviously a lawyer because his line of questioning was very forward and was setting them up to contradict themselves.
---
Both of the reps from Jagex (already forget their names, not going back to check)  sort of fumbled through their answers, giving the old "because we care about the community and want them to take a break every so often" - which the questioner flipped and reversed, trying to force them to acknowledge that they're aware of the mental health related effects of long gaming sessions. 
---
The guy from Jagex says that if someone was reading a book for 6 hours, "I'd probably tell them to take a break. 
---
And this whole ballet, all in the name of not saying that they implemented the forced log as a boring measure lmao
---
Only time I skip is when a quest is in the wilderness.
---
Do pking clans also require applicants to pass a pking test?
---
Your argument makes no sense.  Writing generic scuba code and checking if it renders properly on your npcs is not mutually exclusive.  This is a very basic OO concept, and even a basic programming concept.
---
You asked if scythes were tradable.
