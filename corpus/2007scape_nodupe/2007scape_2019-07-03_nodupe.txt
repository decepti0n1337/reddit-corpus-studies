If you are using runelite you can use the default world plugin. Otherwise i think the client uses the last world you were in.

This isn't just "the smallest shit". MTX was the main reason many people left the previous iteration of the game, it's very central to a large portion of the OSRS community's reason for playing Old School. Anything that risks and threatens bringing MTX to OSRS is going to undermine the reason a lot of these players left RS3 in the first place.
---
Ughh.. that would make the wilderness altar even worse than it already is.. no thanks..
---
It's pretty fucking disappointing how many people are accepting of MTX 2.0 being added to the game.
---

---
You will all be the death of this game, again. Jagex has never kept promises to stop MTX. This is just the first step in that direction.
---
The construction icon pixel fix goes to show that Jagex is no longer honouring the promise of keeping the game polled.
---
Hahahahaha

Would that sell all my stuff and change my password?

I made a typo in the title. It should say runelite plugins.

You can‚Äôt justify intentionally mislead someone. You don‚Äôt need deep context like you‚Äôre saying. We‚Äôre voting on MTX and yet MTX is nowhere mentioned. They know that if they were 100% transparent about this and included the words ‚Äúmicro transaction,‚Äù it would be nayed to hell.

You cant revober it because your IPs dont match up. Thats the power of vpn for ya.

If a HCIM dies like that they definitely deserve it. If you can't take the 5 seconds it takes to pull up the wiki page to make sure an enemy isn't going to randomly yeet you then you're just waiting for it to happen. Had a HCIM in our CC die in catas because he couldn't be bothered to check if high level superiors are any different and had an unfortunate run-in with a marble gargoyle

Your so awesome thank you where r u btw

Yeah, I just think you misunderstood me. What I meant is that osrs' playerbase is mostly comprised of people who have actively run away from MTX, and as such, there are much fewer whales among us. Just look at how rare it is to see someone talking about buying bonds to get a tbow or something. So if MTX was implemented in osrs, the surge in profit would be much lower than normal, and likely followed a lot more quickly about the sudden drop in subscriptions, which is by far the most profitable part of Jagex right now. So no, I don't think introducing MTX is a smart move, even for the most bloodthirsty investors out there.
---
&gt;And the mods have been known to tel people what they want to hear.
---
Not this team, they haven't. We have never had a mod team with such a close relationship to the community. There has been some dramas and let downs, but they always seem to be honest and apologetic for their mistakes. They reverted a tiny 2x4 dock on draynor because some people whined, for god's sake, if that's not listening to feedback and being customer focused, I don't know what is.
---
Now, I don't think they deserve blind trust, because that goes against what our relationship is built on, but I think they deserve at least our belief that they aren't lying through their teeth on a dev blog. At the very least because, if they are, might as well quit now because there's nothing we can do to stop MTX from coming.
---
Its an old quote from 2013? Anyways that ceo is long gone and so is the credibility of that quote.
---
what a idiot!
---
in a nutshell they want more money out the player base and that caused things to spiral out of control last time. Every one knows the term "people dont really quit runescape". Yes they bloody well will if MTX is added in some gross way without putting there core player base first and foremost.
---
Damn bro that gotta be the worst quality pic I‚Äôve seen on here lol gratz though

---
I think it should be down to personal choice, ofc there are integrity issues especially when veering into the inferno at other top tier content, but ultimately they will exist with or without Jagex's consent. People just gotta pick if they want to learn stuff themselves and maybe have a bit more of a challenge by choosing not to use client/features, or they can stay shit at the game and have the client tell you where to click. Either or.
---

Not sure what the fuck you're talking about.

This was polled. The community specifically voted against fixing the green pixel.
---
Literally any app besides the official one has ad free reddit.
---
I'm honestly shocked at how quickly someone noticed it. I was expecting this to have been implemented several months ago and only noticed just now. Who is checking on the green pixel every update?
---
If those extra Devs salaries are paid for with MTX than I'd rather a smaller team.

The upside it having the game grow and get new members. What are you talking about?

They already have ads, but this is reaching an even greater audience. Using only of the ways of getting the game out there is just handicapping your own growth.
---
Please Jagex :(

I had pin and Authenticator and lost my account to hackers recently because didn‚Äôt have 2-factor on my email and after they got my password wrong enough times, Jagex sent a new password to my email in plain text form... like are you fucking kidding me.

im tired of these posts progress though the game and you make money regardless get slayer to 75 and bet you have atleast 10m if not more
---
Yep, this has been happening to me for a while now. Happens with both OSBuddy and RuneLite and tends to happen randomly about once every hour or so of gameplay. I love the oh so helpful solutions of not using a mac... smh...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Makes it hard to use my wife's Mac to play my hardcore ironman using one of these clients... afraid he'll die to one of these freezes.
---
I just started using the official client and so far it hasn't crashed. But I've only been using it for a few hours of gampelay so far, so I guess we'll see if that's just a coincidence.
---
At Least agility is useful. Grinding out agility kind of sucks but at almost every level theirs a shortcut unlocked.

I don't think using an addon to learn mechanics makes you shit at the game. It just makes it faster to learn. Once you actually learn the mechanics you can just disable the addon and still do just as well. 
---
Like, honestly. That argument ignores the fact that every world first raid team in world of warcraft's history has used addons to progress. Does that make them shit?
---
Wow this is the most awards I have witnessed and its badass that its for an RS clip!

Amazing work

Varrock courtyard :) im TycheMoirai in game if youd like to add me

A lot of people are smart enough to not use the same email for other sites. My game email is strictly for the game, I don‚Äôt use it for anything else. I didn‚Äôt have auth or pin for years either until I paid for my fire capes but that‚Äôs a whole different story in itself. Anyway, I did get security afterwards but beforehand I had no worries that anyone would guess my email
---
True it's definitely more rewarding, but I'm talking about which skill is more tedious / annoying
---
&gt;In Vanilla WoW, there were addons that told you where to stand during raids
---
I think these are way too far tbh, it goes beyond eliminating frustration and tedium, just turns raids into skill-less messes.
---
&gt;Why is OSRS so defensive of objectively obfuscating and clunky mechanics?
---
It's easier to attain perfect play in a game where you're limited to a certain amount of actions every 0.6s than a real-time game where things are always happening. No one can play WoW perfectly because of mechanical skill requirements, RS is mostly about navigating the interface and game knowledge, things that clients can remove, allowing players to achieve perfect play fairly easily since mechanics don't really matter for most of RS outside of stuff like 1t flicking and tick manip skilling.
---
&gt;If Zulrah helper is not okay, why is the Zulrah helper website okay
---
Having to look off the client is harder to look at the form and positioning is much more difficult than the game highlighting exactly where to stand and when to switch for you.
---
&gt;why does Jagex not seek to take down websites that do the same thing as these addons
---
They don't do the same thing
---
&gt;You can accomplish the exact same result with the wiki and with websites and video guides that you can accomplish with these addons.
---
Definitely untrue, anyone who's ever seen a new player do Zulrah can attest to this. Even with guides and videos, they'll still misremember or misread things and stand in the wrong place or do switches at the wrong times.
---
I just realised this is the guy who made the Pokemon RuneScape battle. Talented person
---
Sure go ahead open a layout for zulrah rotations etc on a side window eventually you learn it because you die to many times splitting your attention or your eating more than you have to for the same reason. Having it as an overlay removes any learning from it and at this point you aren't really learning idc. At that point the zulrah guide website is just like any strategy guide for any other game or a guest guide. But the moment it overlays the actual game it becomes an issue
---
Is it just me or is everybody on this sub a dumbass that doesn't know how to take screenshots?
---
Exactly, my email is strictly for the game. So I never had to worry about anyone guessing it, not until I paid for my firecapes did I finally get Authenticator and pins.
---
I'm trying to get Tarns Diary back so I can make another salve amulet and I can't find it in my book case. Anyone know where it is (towards the top or bottom?) or if it doesn't have a different name

Also worth noting at least with bonds a lot of people swapped go to rs3 then bought bonds there to pay for membs so it didn't change as much as it seems
---
So much content.
---
Just by making them mounts that are sold for gold would make it okay but the problem is someone always has to pay for them. Not a single one of those mounts are really free. You could buy a token and then gold with it to get the mount but it wouldn't be mandatory for someone to pay for it at some point.

Doing the wood walk is doable but really hard. If you get the timing right is possible but it‚Äôs ‚Äúunresponsive‚Äù. You can edge pk but nhing is also ‚Äúslow‚Äù. You will miss switches. You can do bosses but you have to do them perfect; you have no room for mistakes.

Wtf, I have a 200+ KC and I have yet to see tassets. On the plus side, I got almost every item on the rare drop table :)

Thematically it doesn't even make sense. Like oh you paid for twitch prime this month? here is a house theme for morytania or priffandis even though you're account just got off tutorial island have a good day. Also i would have less of a problem if the rewards were just the emotes and home tele reskins. but the house themes are stuff the player base has been asking for for years. Now were told you can pay money for it and get it or you can get it eventually when we feel like releasing it to the rest of the game, lest there is a huge uproar the next skin is released and we sweep the last one under the rug and oh no now we have novelty accounts that are gunna be sold cause they ahave a certain house skin we forgot to release to every one else. yes its a problem
---
Is this a picture of the moon from the 1970s?

Players can benefit from this too. If the game grows from more people joining the members, then they have a bigger budget to spend on new devs/content and even other things like live player support.

How many devs do you really need when most updates get voted down at the polls
---
Right? Leagues current ‚Äúseasonal pass‚Äù for lack of a better word, basically requires 2 games on average a day in the time it‚Äôs up. All while completing usually niche missions. So not only are you required to play a lot, you‚Äôre required to play champs you don‚Äôt play / in games with people who don‚Äôt play those champs- making the quality of games go down overall. Or- alternatively buy the loot boxes for a CHANCE at the extra limited time currency to unlock the prestige skins. Roughly $100-$150 is the cost if you buy the packs from the shop alone. If not more.  But a new 1350 skin? (Roughly $10-15 depending on how much RP you buy in bulk) if I like the champ that‚Äôs an instant buy. I hate that I‚Äôm a sucker for it but the more I play league the more I‚Äôm set off of it. Idk. Maybe 10 years of onengame is fucking enough.

Who is asking for new home tele animations or new skin colours? Nobody. People are asking for you to improve account security, address the severe botting issue and implement content changes from poll results which have already passed (of which there are many). Jagex needs to slow down, for the good of the game.

Could you perhaps tag an item as 'undroppable' within the bank interface? Items such as void, graceful, BA rewards that you'd never want to drop could have this protection.

Are you guys going to make another Fairy tale quest at some point? As it is right now, the ability to use fairy rings without the staff is tied to an elite diary. Which makes no sense at all.

I also feel like it has way too high requirements to ever be convenient to get.
---
dude it's completely possible with 61 range for rune xbow, 99 range for jad is overkill. Give it a shot, it'll take you less than an hour and a half and you'll get a feel for the caves. If you die, it's not a big deal.

Ahahaha, classic. ArE yOu eSL?

I've seen some stupid definitions of mtx, but yours takes the cake. This update is an step towards cosmetical mtx. Are you functionally incapable of reading?
---
Bonds are a form of microtransactions, but hardly as damaging as conventional mtx. You could always buy gold, and bonds have the same function. How is that any different?
---
And guess what, players from developing countries are not as privileged english-first-language speaker as you. Purchasing bonds is the only shot they have at getting membership.
---
I agree, but the membership price they charge is already pretty steep for what the game is.

Bonds allow people that wouldn't normally be willing to RWT a method to buy gold

Bonds are MTX, you are apologizing them, you are an MTX apologist.

I'm focusing on the construction icon here. Have you considered how the pixel got their in the first place? Once you understand how compression works, when they edit the original source, depending on how they save it again, it won't be there anymore. People had already noticed other icons got updated around this time, so it would have had to be a conspiracy by Jagex from the start, with a full on backup plan if they got caught.
---
You answered your own question. If people are able to modify the market through throwing IRL money at Jagex, that is damaging to the game. That's one of the various ways bonds are bad from the game.
---
Aside from that, bonds are evidence that Jagex IS willing to add MTX. Why do you think they'll stop at bonds?
---
swap 8 for 13 and it still would've been unacceptable behavior so...
---
You can tell he‚Äôs a pker by the title

I've found myself wondering if I'd get a higher dps with salve and from my helmet at abby's *multiple* times before remembering you need the slayer helmet to kill them. So it's not entirely unheard of :p
---
What fairy world do you live in? People have always purchased gold regardless of the bond legitimisation.
---
That's like saying people who didn't smoke marijuana now do after its legalisation. That's not how things work. People will do things they want regardless of the barrier imposed, if they really want to.
---
If you just want to ignore that point, call me an apologist all you want. This rant is about the addition of cosmetic MTX, not bonds. Bonds do not damage the game integrity anymore than gold farming does.
---
You there now? I'll try it with you but I doubt it works
---
It‚Äôs ok I got jar of swamp from the snek at like 15 kc and nothing in the past 500 üôÉ

how would this make it more convenient?

For example i am 600 kills into hydra. I have 1 ring piece and 0 claws.
---
I have the Hydra leather but not the hydra tail.
---
So i am currently (600kc - the ring piece i have.  180.. In total im 240 kills over the drop rate of the next ring piece. So im 240 kills dry.
---
Im 88 kills over the drop rate of the tail so im 88 dry. And im not dry of the claw yet because im under the drop rate.
---
Well. That is what he said
---
Do I have any evidence of new players buying bonds and then spending the gold on expensive gear, increasing the demand for that gear, thus making it harder for legitimate players to obtain the gear?
---
No, not on me at the moment, but if I hop on osrs and head to the grand exchange I bet I could find a couple examples on any given world.
---
For one, the cosmetic mtx of rs3 very quickly made people care less and less. In a similar vein to the highscores new fancy mtx outfits make grinding any other outfits worthless because the artists just make the mtx ones pretty for it to drive sales

The outcome stays the same, does it not? People will buy gold, regardless of the condemnation.
---
Bonds are a way to monetise a potential income stream that Jagex was losing out on. The outcome of gold buying is the same as buying bond, so how do bonds damage gameplay but gold buying does not?

Sure, whatever you say fam. I have seen people call them bosses plenty of times, in the official dev notes, by players in game, by players in Reddit, by woox (first boss, second boss, etc). They are boss monsters. And not one time I said bossing in my comments before. You can‚Äôt even read comments. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm even wasting time replying to you considering you did not add anything relevant to discussion:

This is why i am a meninist.

Probably right didn‚Äôt know if i kept it vague enough lol
---
Thank you

I love your addition of the ‚ÄúXD‚Äù they really add to the retardation buddy. 
---
I can tell now you‚Äôve never been inside a raid. People say ‚Äúwhat rooms do we have‚Äù or ‚Äúfirst room, second room, etc.‚Äù
---
I will agree that TOB people call them ‚ÄúBosses‚Äù but in raids I‚Äôve honestly never heard anyone call them bosses - I‚Äôm not saying they aren‚Äôt bosses, but that aren‚Äôt called that and I find it hard to believe you meant raids, inferno, instead of Bandos, Dusk and Dawn, etc.
---
I love you both
---
Good OC
---
Sounds about right
---
&gt;An 8 year old is on Runescape, therefore she deserves to be sexually harassed.

You.

Okay so my opinion is that comparing partnered cosmetics to something like a champion's cape is super unfair. The value of the champion's cape isn't in its looks or cosmetics, its the representation of the achievement that comes with it. 
---
Are the cosmetics at Trouble Brewing equally as valuable as the Champion's cape?
---
Change my mind please
---
Right?
---
Like, I could maybe see where these 'doomsday' folks are coming from if Jagex just added all these partnership cosmetics without polling them because they "aren't MTX" (they aren't). But the fact that they are treating this as sensitively as they are (indicating they *knew* this distrust was coming) tells me they don't have any nefarious plan for MTX. 
---
If they were being more duplicitous I could see the distrust, but the way they've handled this reads more like a 'one-off """MTX""" exception that is good for the game' situation a la Bonds. 
---
I mean, if you're going to slowly boil frogs you don't start by telling the frogs "okay, so we're gonna start boiling you now".
---
That's a very interesting point about the black graceful cosmetic addition. Could be combined with a slight xp boost in agility leveling to make up for how grindy that skill is.
---
so I wasn't the only one to see it this way until recently
---
I like you
---
Supporting from Colombia üá®üá¥ vamos
---
I agree with this.
---
It's hard to accept that it is all downhill from this point forward. But, nothing great lasts forever and OSRS has already been out for 6 years.
---
its not cheating
---
Well I was at the end of my trip from the night before, I figured I could get a couple kills in before my break was over, with the left over supplies. I wouldn‚Äôt do it consistently on mobile.
---
[Fremennik kilt](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fremennik_kilt) is definitely the way to go.
---
Eu nunca nem cheguei a ver como √© runescape sem 150 de ping. Ser√° que faz diferen√ßa pra trocar arma no pvp?
---
Ahh now this is the RS3 Jagex that I know and despise. It‚Äôs so easy to recognize this shit when I see it, as they‚Äôve done it to you guys in the past. And it was on the other MTX poll.
---
‚ÄúShould we add a full and permanent F2P service alongside Membership Bonds?‚Äù
---
This is how it was worded in the poll. There is no reason these couldn‚Äôt be two questions. They are two entirely separate things. F2P and Bonds. But jagex held your F2P hostage until you were willing to vote bonds in. Now Jagex is holding old emotes hostage. If you want that freeze emote you are essentially going to have to agree with a deceptively worded question so that Jagex can milk some extra profit out of us. 
---
This isn‚Äôt to say that I hate Jagex or that I don‚Äôt want them to be a wealthy company. But they‚Äôve made catastrophic mistakes when it comes to their games. And the crux of all those updates that ruined the game was greed. I literally have a maxed rs3 account with billions of gp collecting dust because of there mistakes. Now I‚Äôm enjoying my time grinding osrs and I don‚Äôt want to get burned the same way I did back then. Especially when I‚Äôm just recently starting to love the game again. I have to say when I see Jagex get deceptive and greasy on us like this, it really makes me second guess it all. Man I have like 200 days gameplay on a 15 year RS3 account... I‚Äôm not gonna get fucked like that twice (at least not without lube).
---
Me when I can't even get a firecape and this lad does this.
---
C
---
...I don't get it dude. You can't pull an example from ten years ago and say "and that's how you know they haven't changed".
---
How about the fact that we've gone 6 years without anything even resembling Squeal? How about the fact that every big change added to the game has been explicitly cleared by the playerbase? How about the fact that it is *literally a different group of people at the helm now*?
---
I just feel like you can't hold a grudge forever and six years of positive actions should earn back *some* amount of goodwill.
---
This is like

Professional level shit

N√£o, ping alto, tudo bem. Mas dizer que n√£o d√° pra conversar, participar de Fight Caves, pelo amor de Deus. Pra trocar a arma no PvP depende da rota√ß√£o do pvp.
---
Saying that osrs is the cash cow for jagex, over RS3 is speculation or is there actual numbers released on revenue from each game? Didn't see anything to prove this in your data, but you did say osrs makes more money. Just something I've generally been interested in. We know rs3 has less players but then they also advertise like $200 dollar loot chest bundles and people are buying that sort of thing over there. I'm really curious how the revenue is split between the two games.
---
Hello RS3 refugee and welcome to OSRS.
---
Reported, this broke my mouse
---
Ik zie het probleem niet helemaal, waarom voel je je zo aangevallen hierdoor?
---
Why does it have to look mean, can‚Äôt it be nice
---
memes are back, osrs saved, yw
---
Cray
---
If you honestly believe this is the same as what's actually being proposed, you need to screw your head on straight. A cosmetic effect/house look/etc. is not the same as something like THIS that would actually affect gameplay.
---
Okay, the sky is green, the ground is blue, and the earth is flat.
---
See, I can say stupid shit too!
---
Yep
---
LOL 100% support
---
Obviously they aren't going to sell exp, but I don't want them to start selling cosmetics either.  Purple skin was the first step, and here we are at the tipping point.  If we give the go ahead with this poll it's all downhill.
---
Yeah its tough playing from here, I have reached a point where I can self sustain on bonds for both osrs and rs3. Full support for this, rs3 has some LA servers and they run very smooth. 
---
Saludos desde Chile
---
I think you‚Äôre wrong lol
---
&gt; The original question paired the introduction of f2p servers with bonds. In other words, if you wanted f2p, you had to be ok with bonds 
---
This iteration of MTX is less malicious than the bonds one as F2P OSRS is more desirable than cosmetics. Also how are you certain most OSRS players would like the proposed cosmetics even if it was given to them for free without any MTX?
---
&gt;Secondly, and more maliciously, they are calling this MTX, not MTX
---
What is even worse is that they are implicitly denying bonds are MTX when they say they are not adding MTX to OSRS when in truth it already existed.
---
nah chuck the 10 and get cleaned like a man (at least thats how it goes with my luck lol)
---
Can the Soul bearer be changed to a 1 click fill similar to that of the herb/gem bags?
---
This.
---
I can understand their reasoning behind partnerships etc, but if they are not mentioning this ingame polls, Jagex will lose my respect. Theres plenty of people who do not read the forums, reddit or frontpage, and Jagex knows that.
---
Depends on how you define it. It's certainly nowhere near the level it would be if it were real life, but it could still be considered "sexual harassment" from a technical standpoint. It was certainly harassment, and of a flirtatious nature.
---
I mean, I could very easily ask you the same thing. I'm far more likely to listen to what Jagex has to say about their own promotion ideas than what brainlets who can't think critically about an idea for two seconds/my favourite OSRS content creator(s) have to say.
---
Wow this was so awesome. Innovative and fun! Great work to whoever did this
---
What is the point of that account?
---
Ty. I went and read the whole thing thoroughly after youre reply.
---
People have been asking for cosmetics of this form for years, particularly PoH skins.
---
If Jagex adds any type of mtx, cosmetic or not, I will quit OSRS. Fuck that. It would ruin the game for me. If I have to purchase something (other than bonds or membership) to experience or access something in game, whether its "just cosmetic", it would hinder the experience and the reason osrs exists.
---
I have spent a lot of money on bonds, and membership. And they want to squeeze something more out of me for some cheap cosmetic they lock behind a paywall. Nawww, old school players should have access to all content. I dont mind grinding for content. Paying for some cheap money grab, no, ouch. 
---
Last time I quit, it was because the EoC, and I only came back in Dec of 2018 after finding out oldschool was a thing thanks to the osrs mobile launch. I grew up with runescape, and osrs is the savior of my favorite childhood game. Please dont let them kill it. 
---
I work full time, so I buy bonds to sell for gp, so I dont have to spend hours making money in game, and so I get to spend my free time grinding out my goals. I've spent at least $400 on bonds on top of paying $11 a month, and they want more? 
---
I feel like this idea comes from the business side of Jagex, I dont believe the old school team would feel good about mtx coming to osrs. 
---
A lot of oldschool players enjoy fashionscaping while bank standing or just between grinds; and many players are addicts, and this idea feels like a way to exploit addicts and players with a love for fashionscaping. 
---
Every single mtx or cosmetic item meant to open the door for mtx's they poll I will vote no.
---
I hope this new company that owns them dont ruin what they have created.
---
Then let‚Äôs do the only thing jagex responds to and go viral.
---
Damn so the name Dorian Yates is open huh?ü§î
---
I have good memories of the abyss.... Is there something wrong with me?
---
How does bandos cbrace warriors hurt the game? They pay for my membership
---
they can be great, over time. I hate this lazy and selfish ‚Äúwant it now‚Äù generation..
---
Why wouldn't you just VPN to where the servers are? lol you might even get lower ping ;)
---
&gt; Players that are opposed to MTX generally have the mindset that their hard work in the game should not be undermined by those willing to spend money, counteracting and likely in more extreme cases, eclipsing their "honest work." Bonds however, allowed the players a different kind of mindset because now their hard work could be transformed into free membership; this in many regards, "made up" for the fact that there are people out there supplying these bonds by paying IRL. 
---
Then Jagex pitted the former community against the latter community by favouring the latter and disrespecting the former, similar to what was done in RS3. It's a threat to game integrity for the benefit of Jagex making more profit.
---
Why would you ever raid with someone with an obby cape lmao
---
Yeah but the whole point is avoiding re-gearing right? You'd have to swap bracelets still.
---
honestly runelite is only as safe as you are with your account.  I would make sure all security features are in use, doesnt matter if you use runelite of the official client.
---
I think I have an unpopular opinion here: I believe it‚Äôs important that these posts are constantly made to keep jagex in check. I don‚Äôt want anyone forgetting that we all hate MTX. As annoying as it is, I believe the echo room of MTX hate is necessary.
---
You want things with low defence and high hp sand crabs are good
---
I might be okay with a limited amount of cosmetic mtx, i am not okay with being able to spend your money on exp or items that you can actually use to advance the game on your character.  Sorry i cant support your opinion on this matter.
---
Both easily have the infrastructure to support at least a single fucking server in each respective country
---
you can change your ‚Äúcontact email address‚Äù to be different than your ‚Äúlogin email address‚Äù
---
How many OSRS players quitted the game once bonds passed the polls?
---
sometimes you gotta be a dick to point out lazy / stupid questions.
---
&gt; entitled
---
Sorry, but expecting to get value for the money you spend is not being entitled. This isn't a free to play game, people have every right to complain about promotions like this regardless of your own opinions on it.

tbh I suspect that a lot of RS game design drama comes from the community playing nothing but OSRS
---
I‚Äôm 99% sure that Vanilla wow didn‚Äôt have an addon to show you where to stand. 
---
During Wrath of the lich king there was an addon called AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) that came out during Icecrown Citadel. AVR had a boss mod plugin called AVRe (Augmented Virtual Reality encounters) that would draw shaded geometry on the floor that would tell you where to stand, where spells were going to impact, and also it would have the circles elapse like a clock to indicate timers of buffs and debuffs.
---
AVRe made a fight like Heroic Professor Putridide a complete cake walk. It showed you not only where to stand to avoid his AOE throws but also the infection radius and stack timer of the stacking DOT that needed to be soaked raid wide by the ranged and healers. Very shorty after AVRe premiered Blizzard patched out of existence as it was far too powerful.
---
There‚Äôs a huge difference between learning what to do and where to move in that encounter versus being shown in real time. Without AVRe the Heroic 25 Putricide fight was my guilds most difficult challenge, with AVRe we trounced it in 30 minutes as soon as we all installed the addon.

Have a look through a good chunk of the replies, there is a fair bit of "its only cosmetics, its not really the bad type of MTX" sentiment. They did a clue scroll rework recently which was pretty much all new cosmetics too.

Who remembers when the Google Goggles were added to rs3 when you logged on from google chrome?
---
So what do you call paying for service outside of the game, to receive it in-game before other players? Its pretty much MTX but instead of buying it from Jagex you'd be buying it from their partners lmao.
---
mm2 caves (best and second most afk mage xp in game), seed pod teleport (free teleport out of &lt;30 wildy), and demonics (stupid good money even w/o zenys). not exactly dead content, lol.
---
that set up is doable (replace whip with arclight) but you should get those stats way higher, range especially. base 80s is where i'd be most comfortable doing demonics at.
---
PSA: it's possible to wooxwalk with 200+ ping as long as it's consistent, just 'pre-click' where you want to walk/attack before you're done with your current movement
---
true, but the same could apply while they're hidden though. Instead of kicking it off with 300 fake 'yes', they just add 2,000 from the gate.
---
Paying real money for anything in-game is categorically mtx. Even for cosmetic skins or as a promotion. Locking content behind a pay-wall, regardless of the duration, is also categorically mtx. 
---
My point was that the company are continuously pressuring the community to head in the mtx direction and if we give into too many concessions, we will end up in a similar situation to RS3. The latter part of my post is a slippery slope argument and you can call the it fallacious if you want, but it's a real trend in gaming currently and is something we should be mindful about; especially in its infancy. Nothing lasts forever, even the CEO himself can change and so to can a companies direction.
---
squadW
---
Are they really getting new players through these promotions though?    I highly doubt someone not interested into OSRS will start playing simply because they received a home tp skin promo code.  I think the point is not to recruit more OSRS players but to convert OSRS players into potential customers for Jagex partners.
---
But their PROFITS IN GENERAL are up. You literally can't read, can you?
---
Ah, didn't know about Nardah. Thanks.
---
Welcome to modern society.
---
If any appreciable percentage of the player base goes "damn, I like the look of that skin, what do I gotta do to earn it?" and the answer is go sign up for some bullshit subscription to some company that partnered up with Jagex, that'll be a fucking tragedy. 
---
The answer to that question should ALWAYS be "go earn it"
---
Using a DHCB and rigour. Getting at least 2 kill trips but have food left over so I want to make 3 kill trips. The food is not as much as I am comfortable with trying another kill.
---
Use a god dhide body, obsidian legs, blowpipe+arclight. That‚Äôs probably the minimum I would go with
---
&gt; "it's fine if it's just cosmetic"
---
Except it is, it gives the company an avenue to make money without hurting the integrity of the game. The ONLY issue I have with it is if it leads to non cosmetic MTX, but if we're purely discussing JUST COSMETICS then yeah I think most people should be fine with it.
---
I like it
---
And just run a weapon switch?
---
I‚Äôd honestly rather they just charge more for the monthly subscription than start down the mtx route
---
Problem with that improvement is somewhat with modmatk's comment from yesterday in another thread. He said he couldn't give any excuse in "good conscience" for the promo's when asked. That implies the obvious, Jagex's profits are far beyond the point of dev etc. costs. Further profits are just money to the owners, business is business.
---
Anyway, indeed hard to say they are forcing much through with polling system. Other thread was mostly about "misleading", but considering how happily people will vote against any poll connected to this, I think it is all right for now.
---
I think it's rather odd he would leave without another job lined up. I think he left for a reason he's not telling us. Definitely could be promotions
---
Its just because you got lucky with ranarrs with the women more than with men. Do this a thousand times and the result will be the same
---
Right.
---
Personally as long as it's cosmetic and nothing P2W I've got no problem with micro transactions.
---
That opinion is valid even if you don't agree.
---
186 rewards. That has to be some kind of record?!
---
reeeeee goes the frog!
---
Think you dropped your tinfoil hat.
---
It's always broad daylight in osrs
---
Takes a bit of practice but if you have arclight or whip, blowpipe and slayer helm then welfare gear for the other slots will be fine even.
---
MM2 also lets you get the quest cape which means you can complete lumbridge elite diary, 6th block slot and no dramen staff is great.
---
Yep, top of all the by almost double the karma of the previous top post of all time. 37k vs 22k

I think they're doing this like priority polls where they just do the top x most highly voted ones. Shameful and gross.

This game is a business. Jagex will inevitably need to bow down to their shareholders. They will not care about a Phasmatys flag.

I really don‚Äôt like MTX. But I would much rather some cosmetics Introduced into the game versus the alternative of Squeel of fortune-esque MTX.
---
We need to be realistic here. Too many are delusional to the realities of how a business works.
---
yeah just stop commenting on here if you are not going to help.
---
That would devalue untrimmed Slayer capes, as anyone would be able to untrim their cape. A better solution IMO would be to make the cape trimming a manual process, that way you couldn't accidentally trim it.

There could be a subset of OSRS players who don‚Äôt care about MTX

If he blocks non-whitelisted executables, then all games would be blocked, private servers included. If it's a domain block on OSRS's authentication servers, you'd be locked out of logging in on your account but could probably find a bootleg server if you don't mind starting over.

A maximum of 16 rooms yeah, you can have less if you want. I actually didn't explain it all: you also have to make sure the grass border area around that has a width equal to that of 1 room. It can be annoying to get this, you basically have to move a room to some random spots and then back to its correct position to manipulate the green border area. Almost seems like rng to get it right.
---
so you wouldn't be eligible for it anyway. I really don't see what making people repeat a 100 hour grind just to slightly mix up the end game achieves. Its not a challenge to repeat that content it's time consuming and achieves nothing. I play POE and switch classes all the time luckily that only takes me like 6 hours to repeat the levelling storyline (like 12 on league start) but its still monotomous as hell when youve done it 20+ times and achieves nothing.
---
Can you atleast give me some reasons as to why giving players who have already achieved level 60 the option to buy boosts is harmful to the game other then reee thats not classic reeeeee
---
Mediums and hards for masters.
---
Taking one of the best pieces of balanced pvm content and ruining it by forcing people into the wilderness.
---
If you use runelite you might have an automatic screenshot saved somewhere.
---
I got the drake drop that lets you upgrade the boots of stone to brimstone and figured i could do the upgrade while slaying, nope.
---
Ok, you took the time to actually reply with actual arguments and points, so I'll actually give you a genuine reply.
---
The thing is:
---
A. Most people who would be taking advantage of the promotion would likely be people who are already subscribed to the service. This is the entire point of the bonus tact on to the membership that would come with the promotion (if we go by Twitch Prime as the example of what what an OSRS cross-promo would look like).
---
B. What you're ACTUALLY paying for is the service. The membership and bonus is just a little something extra to sweeten the pot. The whole point of the cross-promo is to promote growth on both sides of the fence. You shouldn't be going out of your way to participate in the promo if you genuinely have zero interest in the partner in the promo, doing it solely for membership+bonus.
---
Basically, the little extra thing is a marketing tool. You entice new players with a nice little shiny thing to get them through the door. "We, of course, recognise that some people wondered why we offered cosmetics at all. We did it because the more we offer, the greater the encouragement for Twitch and other partners to promote the game, and the more incentive there is for new players to try it. And sometimes that's what it's all about - the tiny little things that get a partner that bit more excited or get people to go that extra step and click play."
---
Having people pushing back so hard on the little bonuses means we'd be significantly less likely to have cross promos. Obviously, some would see this as a win. No "MTX" added and less bots added through fraudulent use of the promo. However, that isn't thinking long term. We want new players to enter the game. A game can't sustain itself on a stagnant pool of players forever (especially as some people will obviously quit at various points). It needs to draw in that new blood to keep the game afloat. It also means more money which (should, but not always) would translate into more hands on the OSRS team, better service and an all round better experience for the players.
---
Now, to address "Paying real money for anything in-game is categorically mtx. Even for cosmetic skins or as a promotion. Locking content behind a pay-wall, regardless of the duration, is also categorically mtx." I'm afraid I cannot agree on this point at all. The simple fact that it comes later free of charge to everyone being a big factor.
---
You see, I actually play a bunch of games with MTX in them. In don't partake in them, but I do see them. However, I bare them because they're f2p games. What I normally see in those kinds of games are MTX where it's like "buy this pack to get this exclusive thing! Buy now! It will never come back!" And then...the item doesn't come back. It's gone for good. In those games, it would be unthinkable to have it say instead "Buy this pack now for this exclusive thing! Or wait! That's fine too! Everyone will get it in a month or two anyway!" I use this as a specific example over say boosts or p2w mechanics because it's a much closer fit to what we're currently looking at. Timed exclusivity is a poor way to get people to buy items through MTX.
---
I will also again iterate that you're paying for the service that the cross promo is with. It doesn't matter that what you actually care about is the bonus, you're paying for the service on the partner's site. Jagex isn't expecting everyone to go to the partner's site just so they can get the new bonus. Obviously, they'll want some percentage of people to do so so that the partner in question will actually want to work with them again in the future. But it won't be the majority of users. That's why the bonus is small and innocuous. They want to minimize there actually being any damage done to the game by introducing something big through a 3rd party promo. Which again brings in the point that they aren't expecting most players to pay for the bonus. The bonus is mainly just to attract new fans. They know that they're going to be giving it for free to the majority of players.
---
"My point was that the company are continuously pressuring the community to head in the mtx direction and if we give into too many concessions, we will end up in a similar situation to RS3." I don't think that this whole thing is a concession though. If it was, it'd be too late as we've already had the Twitch Prime promo. Action would have had to be taken then. Basically, I don't think this whole thing is the hill everyone thinks it is, and I certainly don't think it's a hill worth dying on.
---
Trust me, if Jagex ever does try actual MTX with boosts, buying resources (you could argue you can do this indirectly with bonds, but I mean more direct like buy 10k iron for a flat price on the site), pets, shortcuts to large achievements like the champion's cape or other stuff, I'll be there with you, arm in arm, to say no to Jagex.
---
To sum up, because I realize I went a bit long here, the community is so militantly anti-MTX that they're attacking a marketing tactic to bring new players in with a bonus that Jagex doesn't expect most players to pay for.
---
Have you spoken to the slayer master and ask them to ignore your combat level? something along those lines
---
Thats literally the reason. Why recreate classic if were just gonna change the things we dont like to fit our agenda?
---
didn't realize you could get masters from mediums, cheers for the info.
---
I literally had no idea that was a thing. I'll try that now. Thank you !
---
Sigh unzips...
---
ü¶ÄPESO 209.71ü¶Ä
---
soooo reeeeee not classic reeeeeeee. It's kinda funny you say that in a games subreddit that only survived by doing just that. Bonds btw
---
I match with all four of these accounts everyday
---
I can't find anything about your claim. Help me out, dude.
---
Somehow konar reminds me of Mod Gee lmao...
---
Eva Elfie is babe
---
ikr? It hasn't even left the front page yet and is sitting at 2.8k upvotes. Not sure why anyone would upvote this one when the other one is still there.
---
I need 99 prayer too man
---
Then quit now, cya.
---
*sassy voice* NObody
---
It's been 5 months, but that was a suicide joke related to how hard the quest is.
---
Your tinfoil hat is missing.
---
4;30, i got scared, now i wont sleep in the next 12 days
---
Search osrs optimal quest guide, it's a page in the wiki that puts the quests in an order to minimize the need for Skilling
---
And so, doing partnerships with other companies DOESN'T work unless it's something as benign as cosmetics. The proposed blogpost is MUCH healthier for the game than free membership is.
---
Why did they do that?
---
Official Runelite? None.
---
If you want to spend the money then so be it. That is your decision to make not mine.
---
how is this a repost? the video was made yesterday and posted by the guy who made it
---
I would rather they focus on building activity‚Äôs for the community, making storylines and quests in place of this promotional horseshit that seems to be smoke, mirrors, deception and distraction.
---
How is it too high requirements to be convenient? You have to get a quest cape to even finish Lumby Elite. Pair those two things together and now you can go to any fairy ring anywhere with a single teleport of your quest cape, which puts you closest to a fairy ring over any other teleport.
---
Maybe it's the dumb amount of clues I do, but it's been one of the most useful diary rewards for me so far.
---
x2
---
Runelite plus?
---
The way they weighed their words carefully and assured us like 9 times not to be worried about it actually has me worried. 
---
Small rewards through twitch prime are totally fine for the game every so often. However, this seems like it will be something that will not be a once in a while thing. What happens when they run out of good ideas for rewards? Sharkperson costumes. Eventually the game will be overrun with these cosmetic rewards and people will be sitting around like "when do we unlock the x reward? Is it this month?".
---
They are telling us about this and polling the mandatory options because they know it is going to change the game severely in the longrun.
---
I don't hate this, though. Plenty of other games manage to do this without going full blown game-ruining MTX. 
---
If I could get the Reddit Alien, Snoo, as headgear or a pet in OSRS for purchasing Reddit Coins, you bet your sweet ass I would. \*SO LONG AS\* Jagex holds true to their word of not going any further than external promotions like that, it won't cause an issue. Jagex isn't stupid; they know OSRS players will bounce if they don't get their way. I don't foresee them pushing that line anytime soon.
---
Bomberjack outfit, the sled, monkey backpack, silverlight, 10th squad sigil, bull roarer, Ivandis 'staff' and after that the sigil. There are a lot more.
---
I would work on stats necessary for diaries.
---
To add on, normal trees (oak willow maple etc) are super expensive but fast xp because you can do them multiple times per day
---
Fruit trees are cheaper xp/gp but you can only do them once a day. Usually the xp they provide is still plenty unless you're really in a rush for whatever reason, probably the way to go if you don't have endless cash.
---
Welcome back man, I'd go for getting a quest cape, should round out your stats, you're not new to the grind but the nostalgia should be unreal.  Maybe going for some diaries too.
---
MM 2 and DS 2 are amazing quests, the rewards are really good as well and if you enjoy killing TDs the Demonic Gorillas are quite similar.
---
This is true for literally every preorder though. There is no reason to preorder digital
---
Everything about this is perfect.
---
&gt; I don't think this is right.
---
Well, you think wrong.
---
&gt;The Twitch/Streamer market is massive, and  take advantage of this by making partnerships deals with these platforms to entice new players.
---
&gt;&gt;we can
---
I don't work for jagex. In fact, Jagex works for me.
---
&gt;They're trying to add more goodies to players who are already using services such as Twitch Prime to make joining OSRS more enticing
---
Aw, sweet. I can get a swamp house if I start playing runescape.
---
I recall that in the past, Jagex tried the strategy of sacrificing the game's quality for microtransactions and to make it more appealing to new players.
---
It turned out to be a pretty good idea, though, because now we have OSRS...
---
&gt;I'm not okay with them adding MTX
---
&gt;&gt;I am
---
What the hell is wrong with you. The playerbase is growing fine. This is the short-term profit all over again. I know you haven't played rs2, but you'd see things very differently if you had and saw exactly why what you're saying is wrong.
---
I mean, we did get this recently https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/song-of-the-elves-progress-blog?oldschool=1
---
Which is just an abridged text version of this stream. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvNL58Ug1QE
---
I don't know what to say if you want even more than that.
---
Any skill that looks interesting! Woodcutting/firemaking, fishing/cooking, mining and combat can all be easily trained in and around Lumbridge (the starting town).
---
Then you'd only teleport the whip!
---
I feel you on this. In my opinion it's either all unlocked from ingame work or events or all are purchasable. No inbetween.
---
having fun?
---
What's wrong with it?
---
its interesting how you all seem to convenientlyforget that Jagex ran Runescape as an amazing game until at least 2009 or so. But no, Jagex cannot do anything right
---
A lot of games have their basic east/west servers then have a central in Chicago or Denver.  Playing from central Canada either works great.
---
Regarding account security, could additional game features in OSRS have a bank pin added to them when first logging in to better protect people? E.G. Trading, dropping or alching items over 100k, crossing the wildy wall, duel arena and staked games, dismissing pets.
---
To be completely honest I realized I wasted my time when I finished recoloring the graceful.
---
1gp per flax!
---
Everybody wants to rule the world.
---
I know it when I hear it.
---
They'll just keep repolling it until it passes or even just bypass polling. They've done both this year already
---
I've loved watching everyone calling this all a slippery slope when ignoring that's its called the [slippery slope fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) for a reason.
---
Why not just count the literal steps/tiles that each take, from the left side of the entrance ofc since you're coming from the altar.
---
&gt;To be completely clear about this - everyone at Jagex, including the CEO himself, is in agreement that **we will not add any MTX to Old School RuneScape**. We understand that doing so would completely contradict the spirit of what has made Old School a success.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;We can **promise** you that:  
---
&gt;Any additions offered through partnerships will not be exclusive, and will be **available for all members** at a later date.  
---
&gt;Any additions that we offer will be made according to the art style of Old School and will truly fit the game's theme.  
---
&gt;Any additions we offer will not impact your playing experience.  
---
&gt;You will be polled on what additions are offered.  
---
&gt;Any additions we offer will be purely cosmetic.
---
source; news post
---
TLDR: not microtransactions, rather temporary cosmetic bonus for becoming member in particular time.
---
Exactly what he did
---
Are you dumb?
---
Settled wouldn't even be able to use it. He would need to break his rules and leave Morytania to go to a Real Estate Agent.
---
&gt;Vote no on any exclusive deals. Vote no on any MTX.
---
I agree, though I feel like a lot of people are mischaracterizing this dev diary (if not mischaracterizing their potential intentions overall) but they made it clear in the dev diary that nothing that is given through these promotions will remain exclusive to those promotions and will be available to everyone later on, regardless of whether or not they participated in the promotion. They also reaffirm that there won't be any MTX in OSRS, so these promotion items should and probably will be given for free, just like the purple skin color from the twitch prime promo.
---
&gt; The problem is Jagex‚Äôs bottom line is to make money, not to make a better game. 
---
These things are often mutually inclusive, but let's say that you're right anyway, well in the dev diary they reaffirmed their promise to not introduce any MTX to OSRS, but that's fine, because that's not the purpose of these promotions. The purpose of these promotions is to give temporarily exclusive cosmetics out in exchange  for extra exposure on other platforms through partnerships with other companies, therefore potentially growing the playerbase, ultimately giving Jagex more money.
---
At the end of the day you certainly should be extremely skeptical of any and all steps Jagex take in this direction, but at least as it's written, I don't think this dev diary is very vague, and they said they would poll any potential partnerships, anyway. I don't see anything wrong with it, currently.
---
Your best bet is to join aupvm or team Oceania. There are TOB raiders in those clans, so it's a good place to start. However, people generally won't invite you unless you're 100+ kc and own a scythe.
---
Ive met some bloke named Bronar with some bandos armour, i think you got catfished
---
Haha that's me in the screenshot. Feels weird.
---
How much you paying per hour and for how many hours?
---
Use RuneLite. Enable the "Loot Tracker" plugin.
---
Q
---
You might as well max the account then if your do this much grinding on a pure
---
Judging by the fact that he looked at the screenshot which shows ‚ÄúAbyssal Tentacle‚Äù in big fucking letters in the middle of the screen, I think he can put the two together.
---
I imagine there's a heavy incentive to strip membership from the promotion if it contributes so heavily to the botting problem.
---
I like how some looping animations rapidly swing the other way around to reset with smoothing on
---
Well that's a load of horse shit. NOTHING in this game is developed to spin a cost, you think the wildy update made them money? how about the song of the elves. Will there be thousands of new subs to make up for the months it took to develop that content? This game makes money from subs and bonds, development doesn't need to be considered worth the cost, it should be considered based on customer demand.
---
At your own risk, personally I wouldn't touch RL+.
---
I never thought of it this way...
---
Bye, see you in a few weeks
---
Jagex is a very greedy company lol.
---
Hahahah fuck these cunts are sweats
---
Because runlite takes the screenshot too fast automatically the sec you get the pet. 
---
The same plugin witch takes screenshots when you lvl up can also take screen shots when you get pet, valuable drop, die, get a pk and more.
---
Why...why...whyyyyyy???
---
Been away from the sub for a few weeks. Can someone fill me in.
---
Can I ask, whats your max hit with chainmace? Or obby maul in pvp?
---
Anyways pretty sick achievement, I doubt there are accounts with callisto pet with a lower combat level. Very solid achievement.
---
Put all the bots in one world so they are easier to camp... I like your thinking.
---
I meant it more as "Did OP say he was doing this, or is this a surprise for you too?"
---
You are ignoring RuneScape history, though. 
---
Do you not remember when MTX first took over? Or when EOC came into the game? Both caused a *huge* portion of players to quit. Those players now play OSRS and will do it again. OSRS only exists because of this specific group of players and with how well it is currently doing, they aren't going to intentionally cause another mass exodus. RS3 is their cashcow because those players are more receptive and accommodating of those mechanics.
---
What, you got a problem with America bro?
---
He is btw, and i am too btw
---
Rspost
---
I used to have that, accidentally trimmed it during the mining grind, lefkash on suicidewatch at this point
---
a new player doesn't have to know those things at all - they are more for the existing players.
---
The problem is it still has all the negative side effects of MTX.  What happens when people stop buying partner's products because the In-game armor is so good looking?  Do you really think the partners  will keep writing those checks when their revenues start to dip?
---
newfriends havent learned the lesson yet
---
I saw [that ass]
---
I conquered
---
I came
---
:thinking:
---
Shortterm money. 
---
If they want to have a thriving game which brings in the money long term they better reconsider the approach they're about to take.
---
Haven't played in awhile what new mtx is there
---
the polls are worded so shady...
---
how tf can you even "spy" in counterstrike?... all the pros know the same throws/angles. ok sure there are teams who have certain positions they like but even then hows that even a big secret.
---
why do you defend stuff like this? I get that companies are free to fund themselves however they see fit. But as a consumer what benefit are you advocating for here?
---
Money talks
---
Already so good and then the kpop. Lmao. Well done sir *slow clap*
---
You didnt take into account what exposure to new players would have with advertising
---
I'll come back here in 57 days, if I won't be able to view that then I'll send the crabs. Be prepared.
---
Duel arena made me quit
---
My point is that I think your faith in the company means less than you think it does. I‚Äôd rather believe that the people behind the company make educated decisions and know that if they bring in this MTX, the people they gain will outweigh any lost revenue.
---
membership is not even up for polling debate, unfortunately.
---
ive asked for it but jagex apologists stopped me right there, saying that without the membership nobody would use the promotion.
---
i wish we could poll it :/
---
No it started with free spins
---
Pretty sure squeel was released before solomon store
---
I heard pvp in brazil is off the charts irl
---
Get graceful clothing to make it even more useful
---
Jiggleflux will add MTX anyways and just ignore the poll results just like they killed my green pixel boi in the cons icon even tho the poll failed :(
---
200m how long did it take?
---
I personally always wanted to get involved in alt-scape. So I made an alt to do that. Haven‚Äôt looked back, alt slayer is so fun, less effort and better xp rates, afk rune drags while playing on 1 account is also great since fastest buyable skills becomes affordable.
---
Gonna check this out aswell

Getting sick with pneumonia is MUCH healthier for the body than getting sick with the bubonic plague
---
So... you're telling me the rs3 players don't respect their game...
---
Fucking graveyard in Mage Training Arena makes me want to kill myself
---
RS3 MTX is pretty much above EA levels though so I don't see how it's any fairer to see Jagex as the innocent little lamb of gaming companies
---
Truly a missed opportunity by OP
---
The fuck am I getting downvoted for
---
Makes some animations look kinda cool, but also makes majority of them look whack af. I can't use it either.
---
I am
---
We have seen with RS3 that's literally only a shortterm gain. Their profit and loss statement over 2018 showed that MTX revenue has fallen and subscription revenue has risen. 
---
Add on top of that that a big part of the OSRS playerbase were unhappy with rs3 and MTX. That's a big part why people play OSRS over RS3.
---
I don't think you realize that this situation is a very good way for Jagex to destroy a gold mine. They are trying to mine as much gold as possible but forget that the mine might collapse if you do that. Slow and steady wins the race here (unless their goal is shortterm money).
---
isnt blowpipe really good at zilyana?
---
"I can see it not being entirely MTX but it gets pretty fucking close." Isn't that what matters though? As long as it isn't absolutely MTX, isn't that the point?
---
"There are other ways to promote the game without throwing your current player base under the bus."
---
I'm sorry that a time inconvenience to you is you feeling Jagex is throwing you under the bus?
---
"Also cosmetics have a very real impact in OSRS. The way you look is iconic so remodels of current items is a big NO" Ok, but none of the bonuses being proposed do this, unless you wanna nitpick REAL hard about the home teleports. MAYBE the lunar teleports, but we don't know where they would intend to put it (certainly not ACTUAL lunar spells as new players wouldn't have access to that for a while.)
---
"new cosmetics being handed out of free goes against the spirit of the game. Items/cosmetics usually are earned."
---
All true. However, you gotta pick something. There are definitely some trivial things to the majority of the community that could be put up as bonuses that are still enticing to new players. I'm also against the house decor being a possibility. They should definitely be quest locked. But skin colour is not the hill I'm willing to die on.
---
"You could also argue it's a bit misleading to lure players into playing OSRS with cosmetics that aren't exclusive to the promo."
---
Forgive my ignorance, but don't those promos themselves normally state that they're timed-exclusives?
---
Im just saying. People like to propogate the idea that Jagex is satan
---
But conveniently forget that Jagex made the game in the first place.
---
I feel like you answered your own question and just want confirmation. With two DWH specs you will reduce Vorkath's defence to 104.06, right? Hitting higher than a 0 on a DWH spec is a lot more consistent than maxing two BGS specs, and even if you max both your BGS specs you can only reduce his defence to 106. 
---
Only downside from where I'm standing would be that you're paying 37.9 mil more for the DWH, but if that's not a concern, then DWH appears better for you, yeah.
---
Why not allow for runescape to make more money through partnerships to allow for a larger dev team to make for better updates and development time to not have huge bugs enter the game, like the Tbow spawn glitch or the max cash stack glitch
---
That master can't have been worth much more than 300k before it. Nice
---
The dev post from yesterday, they‚Äôre thinking of adding a new theme
---
But the way they are offering the new theme (thinly veiled mix) is a point of contention
---
Woah, sorry bro. Didn't know we were dealing with such a badass
---
It's a barbarian camp to the north. Maybe a mistake or easter egg
---
Why doesn't jamflex, a chinese company have servers in China?
---
down vote good
---
I was playing during that time. The Loyalty Store isn't like other MTX in that originally you're not paying additional money in order to get points. It's literally designed as an incentive for players to keep their memberships.
---
And don't be silly. The types of cosmetics offered in the Loyalty store are easily more intrusive than the, might I remind you FREE additions proposed in the recent blogpost.
---
Meme is stupid as fuck but the frogs made me laugh
---
On the login screen, click forgotten password. It will send a code to the registered email, then click something that says you don‚Äôt have access to the email. It will bring up an appeal page. Type in the information accordingly in regards to your account Kirk subscription information, previous passwords + current password, creation date. Send it to your current email you have access to. Make sure that email is secured with 2fa. This will change your email from your current one you don‚Äôt have access to, to the one you‚Äôre actually able to use for password resets. Authenticator did save you, but depending on the information they collected on you during that phish they could potentially do this same thing and have full control of your account.
---
If I'm paying for the game subscription, I should be paying for all of the game's content to be available to me. If I have to spend extra money past the subscription cost, that's a microtransaction, and that's also garbage.
---
This is literally MTX‚Äôs foot in the door
---
Hajedy (Shilo Village Cart guy) mentions these things called "horses". Not sure what those are, but I don't want them in OSRS. Please fix!
---
It's a hard skill
---
just got dragon axe lmao 6 kills after.. just need bring and pet now
---
Oh! A theme? I thought you meant an entirely new POH location! I thought Swampletics was about to get a new house haha
---
you know what they say, the more you level it, the harder it is
---
Good meme!
---
No? Theres just not much they can do other than quit the game they love for the largest part
---
If you want to quote something use this &gt;
---
&gt; see it works.
---
&gt; Isn't that what matters though? As long as it isn't absolutely MTX, isn't that the point?
---
It not 100% being MTX is a really low standard. I prefer it definitely not being MTX.
---
&gt; I'm sorry that a time inconvenience to you is you feeling Jagex is throwing you under the bus?
---
Yes because of the MTX aspect not the time aspect. 
---
&gt; Ok, but none of the bonuses being proposed do this, unless you wanna nitpick REAL hard about the home teleports. MAYBE the lunar teleports, but we don't know where they would intend to put it (certainly not ACTUAL lunar spells as new players wouldn't have access to that for a while.)
---
They will feel out of place and/or cheap. 
---
&gt; Forgive my ignorance, but don't those promos themselves normally state that they're timed-exclusives?
---
Probably but they are also intentionally misleading with the poll (no mention of it being because of partnerships).
---
&gt;4x less players in RS3 but they **have** more devs
---
Rare drop table
---
Obsidian Legs and Body, Anguish Neck, FM Cape, Tome of Fire, Whip with the cosmetic shit and is that a Void mage helm? 
---
The fashionscape is spot on and the illustration is nice.
---
Untrimming capes was a question in Jagex Q/A, but they refuses for doing so because they claimed it would be unfair for those who have successfully kept their capes untrimmed without updated mechanics.
---
"Non-fallacious usage"
---
At least you tried.
---

The only good thing about tentacles is that they sustain the whip price.

Oh wow, just realised I've been seeing the same thing all these years.  A rock being stabbed with a sword and a few chunks of rock falling off

Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's something wrong topographically for how the routing works from the Australia servers, because that seems to be the case for the few Australian players I know, too.

If they could, they would've. They only had a functioning backup of the game from 2007.

Still doesn't make up for anything, this step by jagex may be the beginning of the end
---
You are out of your mind if you think RS3 contributes less to Jagex's profits than OSRS. Hello, MTX? One RS3 player is, on average, certainly of *much* higher value than one OSRS player. They pay the same subscription fee, and then MTX bumps that average way the fuck up. A Friend put what, $13,000 into his account that one time? That month he gave Jagex more revenue than 1,000 OSRS players. And that is not in any way an isolated incident. I have no doubts that RS3 is their 'cash-cow', not OSRS. They wouldn't be okay with the MTX if this was not the case.  
---
RS3 brings in more revenue, and so more time is invested into it. Look, I'm not saying I think they shouldn't increase investment in OSRS. I think they *should* add more devs. But if you base your post on information that the guys at Jagex know to be false, they aren't going to take this seriously.
---
This has done more to sway me against it than any of the "but it's mtx" comments.  If you're having trouble finding rewards for content already, why not just make the new cosmetics rewards for new content?
---
I got it my first KC too on a non iron-man... it‚Äôs the easiest pet to get.

And then i came back. Gonna rebuild about 500m and try my luck again.

Started messing around with this yesterday, considering a gargoyle alt to fund buyables on the main. Definitely seems worth the time investment
---
When given a Red Dragon slayer task, while having *Like a boss,* Red Dragons unlocked and the completion of Dragon Slayer 2, can we get a boss option to fight Galvek in the  Pool of Dreams instead. Perhaps excluded from Konar. Have the reward a decent amount of xp or points or both. To give a reason to actually re-fight Galvek.
---
check the title of the post to see why it affected my character.
---
It was actually owned by Mark Gerhard who was the CEO at the time, he took the APC/tank with him when he left.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
To be fair a lot of the high levels who feel thus way (including mtself) have very cynical and negative opinions about the direction and long term health of the game. At this point we genuinely don't care about a lost battle versus not having to pay 100 bucks a year per account to a company we hate. Plus it's not like jagex bans rwt well anyways so it in a way actually minimizes the integrity damage due to how terrible the bond rate is. There's no benefit whatsoever from the proposed mtx.
---
I'm out of the loop. Help me, OP.
---
I don't have a green pixel? proof it was reverted?
---
Imagine if you could though. You could bot your account and Jagex couldn't do anything about it.
---
There was actually a lot of fuss about bonds back in 2015.

They won‚Äôt be MTX as you know it... they will be something different but still insidious
---
*fun*
---
I mean you certainly do have to pay attention and click a lot. I think that was the intention with it. So it's fulfilling that purpose well. 
---
I agree with you on the Molch Pearl rate though. An idea I had while I was grinding out the barb rod recently; perhaps add another roll for a pearl (can be a rarer roll) when cutting a fish. Similar to how chompy pet is rolled both on kill and on pluck.
---
mod data, i'll miss you
---
still mtx
---
Can't unsee
---
People were making jokes about once he left, MTX would be coming in.
---
Not much of a joke anymore.
---
You are absolutely right. But let's not forget people and their accounts. Will they really abandon osrs after they've put so many hours in it or are they just speaking out of their asses? I guess we'll get an answer as time passes by.
---
I'd recommend going for Classic. It's unlikely that Blizzard will fuck it up, but if anyone can do it, they sure can lol.
---
Only really shitty thing is that they are going to use this tech called Layering for the first few weeks to lower the stress on the servers during launch.
---
Crack the Clue! That's what it was called!
---
Haven't gotten the gear yet myself either...
---
Looks like it's time to find a new game. And to think, mod ash has been lying about no mtx for the past ysar or so.
---
I had an unused bond. 2m cash. And a guthan set which i won on a giveaway.
---
yephello
---
unfortunately it seems like jagex have no say in whether or not mtx are coming, they are just trying to sugar coat it
---
Oh lol i thought he was bullshitting
---
&gt; Yeah also worth noting that every good idea they use for a cosmetic is a good idea they can no longer use for real content.
---
They're literally polling a Lletya house theme as MTX while they develop an elf quest. If this doesn't ring alarms in people's heads, I don't know what will.
---
Negative, cosmetics are a huge reason people grind in this game. If everyone has a cool poh/skin color. No one does
---
Just an fyi: your weight only matters from 0-64 KG. Below 0 KG, it's the same as 0. So even if you have -20 KG, it's the same as having 0. The reason Graceful is useful is because of the set effect of increased regeneration.
---
Basically, make sure you get full Graceful; don't just stick with your boots of lightness with a couple Graceful pieces.
---
We can‚Äôt honestly bitch about mtx anddd ask for new servers. This community gets so confused sometimes it‚Äôs adorable
---
Why would there be porn on this page...
---
Did you know this blog was being talked about before you left?
---
i invented obby maulers don't @ me
---
The really shitty thing is that if we vote no, Jagex will just scrap those ideas entirely and never implement them. It's a lose-lose situation designed for people to vote Yes.
---
I think you are wrong. 
---
I also think it won‚Äôt be within a week, I think it will be over years and will be all about additional subscriptions of partners for bonus in game (including cosmetics). 
---
Sign up to X or you can‚Äôt have the thing.
---
I doubt that'll make the house load even faster, probably still 2 ticks but you can try it.  
---
About the grass area:  
---
The game automatically generates grass around your rooms. If you move your house to the north west, new grass will be generated to the north and west. That doesn't help; to manipulate the border you need to move 1 room to random spots and then back to its correct spot, and hope the borders are fixed. The grass border needs to look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/3VkfkWN.png).
---
mtx should be pushed to the f2p aspect of the game, not paid subscribers
---
I missed this I guess, can someone tldr me what's happened?
---
The issue is that the publishers do not do their job properly, which invalidates their work. If you can make up statistics, start with your conclusion &amp; fill in the blanks to support it, and still get published, then being published doesn't mean anything. My favourite study was 'going in through the backdoor' where they started with the conclusion (that straight men are transphobic because they don't penetrate themselves) and worked backwards. Good stuff.
---
I agree completley. That's why they have to reveal to us how much resources will they put into creating those cosmetics and how will they impact the pace at which content is provided to us.
---
going for 200m all except the skills which require effort
---
all those rewards are terrible, plain &amp; uncreative. then again that's what osrs is becoming so bring it on i guess.
---
wish we still had mat k, he has only been gone for a few weeks &amp; they're already rolling in the dumb mtx shit
---
Squeal of Fortune is next! :)
---
Near future? It already is P2W with the existence of bonds and RWT.
---
F
---
Seems Mat K knew about this which is the reason why he quit?
---
I second this
---
That's not MTX tho. That's a subscription to a service you already have that motivates you to play OSRS with a useless cosmetic everyone gets or getting a subscription to a service for early access to something useless ingame.
---
 Nice
---
Why? Why would you do it on a different account that makes no sense. Just watch netflix while doing on the main
---
Did my Mona Lisa Bot inspire you?
---
&gt;ou do make good points, however they have to make money somehow. How would you propose they function as a business if not for bonds, partnerships or cosmetics?
---
membership fees - the $11 we pay EVERY MONTH, PER ACCOUNT.
---
You think that's not enough to profit off with an old game like this? Bonds are in every way just MTX to make jagex MORE money, not because the game wasn't profitable without it.
---
would you support community generated cosmetics, which would have to be voted on by the community
---
$$ split between creator and jagex
---
I mean botting is never okay :s Splashing is also really slow.
---
I think NMZ is a big problem though. I got my melee 99s and 99 hp in there and I felt as if I accomplished nothing. No rewarding feeling or anything. NMZ has also devalued 99 Str, Attack, Defence, and HP the same way that RS3 xp lamps devalue every skill. Imagine how bad the game would be if every skill felt as accomplishing as 99 Str in NMZ does.
---
You are polling a Lletya house style as a "partnership" incentive while at the very same time developing the biggest Elf quest in the game. Can you not see how this would be, at the very least, dubious to players?
---
Better get good at it for the elite diaries
---
What is the question? I don't play anymore :/
---
Nice.
---
No smouldering stone, holy shit you're lucky.
---
Any cosmetic developed for a partnership is a cosmetic they could have made and saved to append to existing content or add as a reward for future content.
---
It‚Äôs definitely doable. A great example of this is Minecraft. The Bedrock edition is an entirely different engine built from the ground up to be as close to the Java version as possible, yet allow easy portability to different platforms. However, Runescape is not nearly as big as Minecraft, so they would have to ask themselves if it is financially worth it. It probably isn‚Äôt. People play OSRS for the nostalgic look. You only really need engine work to squash bugs that come up and support the occasional new content. They aren‚Äôt going to be doing any major updates, so it‚Äôs probably easier just to deal with what they have now.
---
I never realized what an integral part of the game you were, but reading this comment made me realize. Please come back and fist fight anyone at Jagex who supports this idea &lt;3
---

Capitalism calls for continuous growth, year on year profits must increase or your product is considered a failure.

---
You cant think the company is exactly the same as it started surely?
---
But you see the point is: When people are willing to pay for it you won't have new infernal capes or fire capes, you will have store capes.
---
This proposal hasn‚Äôt even been polled yet, but the news post was a slap to the face.
---
The fact that they blatantly and half-assedly tried to pitch obvious MTX as ‚Äúmeaningfully contributing to the health of the game‚Äù is insulting. Don‚Äôt even get me started with that bullshit ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù comment. If you‚Äôre gonna fuck us, at least give it to us straight. 
---
I get it, they‚Äôre a business. But this isn‚Äôt any ordinary game. This game was largely founded on the HUGE mistake that Jagex made in 2012. You would think they‚Äôve learned by now. 
---
Even if this doesn‚Äôt pass the poll, it‚Äôs not going away. It‚Äôs just delaying the inevitable.
---
What the fuck is this
---
Because partnerships makes them money. Account security doesn't.  Any company's priority is money, sadly.
---
I wasnt aware of that. Thats kinda sad actually
---
Okay is there an increased chance of 3rd age from mimics? I keep seeing 3rd age as the special loot
---
Thing is, it wont be "extra cosmetics" it will be cosmetics that would have otherwise come from regular means in game (TT's, quests etc) that get "stolen" to get put behind a wall.

---
&gt;The content would all come to old school eventually regardless. As it stands the content being proposed is fairly innocent and people are acting like they're offering P2W mechanics.
---
I doubt the purple skin would be in the game if it was polled. There are legit concerns that it is not good gamedesign. Because it's 'innocent' content we can just add a pay wall on it? I think the playerbase would prefer to have it added in from unlocks within the game. 
---
&gt;People's arguments fall apart when they accept and support bonds but get bent out of shape about the proposed partnerships. They just want MTX that benefits them. 
---
In a perfect world, without RWTers and goldfarms, I wouldn't want to have bonds either. There's nothing falling apart in the argument because bonds can actually be seen as an achievement to get from f2p to p2p ("I worked for the money to earn membership"). Cosmetics just behind a paywall to get it early doesn't benefit the playerbase.
---
Not mtx, you‚Äôre buying someone else a membership. It‚Äôs just tradeable.
---
Yes it is. It‚Äôs a prediction of the consequences that can occur as a result of the mindset/actions of those who hold the opposing opinion. Factual evidence would be nice if it were presented, but it‚Äôs not necessary for such arguments. If you want factual evidence you only have to look at the litany of excuses from companies like EA who claim that ‚Äúactually the majority of players enjoy microtransactions‚Äù (paraphrasing).
---
It‚Äôs as much an opinion as saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt take your foot off the pedal when driving, you‚Äôll hit something‚Äù. It‚Äôs a prediction.
---
House decorations and skins are only the start of it. Do you think their MTX store is just gonna be decorations and skins for ever? Nah. MTX expands, it always does. 
---
The expansion of MTX is inevitable because it serves its goal: making more money than you did last quarter. Businesses don‚Äôt really settle, there is always more to be tapped until you‚Äôve sucked up everything.
---
Membership is a form of MTX yes. That's obvious and not a particularly revolutionary or insightful thought. 
---
Can you see how membership is different from adding new forms of MTX?
---
"stop arguing with each other and come argue with me" is what this thread is

No. We CANNOT trust jagex. 
---
We're going to vote no. But they won't give up. They'll pitch it again. And again.
---
Eventually they'll force it on us. Claiming the game is dying and needs to be saved.
---
If updates to a game impact your life so dramatically, it might be time to focus on other things. 
---
I understand where you are coming from, and I agree with your position on the new proposed content. However, Jagex is a private company and you are simply paying a fee to use their product. They are going to add or remove what the want at the end of the day.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I had hoped that hidden polls would have meant that the poll was hidden before voting, but after you had voted you could see the results. I want to be able to see where the voting is going, but I don't want to be influenced by where results are before I vote

This is true ive seen discords where ppl buy twitch rpime memberships for 2m for like 17 prime memberships and start using those accounts to bot as 1 bot could reach around 200k profit and hour.

Look I'm not arguing that loyalty points are a good thing, I hate them and feel they give an unfair advantage to players who've been around longer.

But your argument is flawed. I could extend your logic to say that every members item in the game is an issue because they require "paying money" to get.

---
I mean... If the mtx has no in-game advantages and will become available for free after a short while, it removes a LOT of the leverage that mtx generally has with a long standing player. But you're right, as it is it's technically mtx, the problem is that Jagex isn't talking about that when they say "no mtx". What they likely meant was no in-game advantages for money, like with treasure hunter.
---
Bottom line, I think it's a matter of trust. They made a simple, unambiguous, explicit comment. If you can't trust that they're not lying to your face, then you're just assuming malicious intent regardless of what they do. There's literally nothing they can do to appease you.
---
If I hoped into rs3 tomorrow on a fresh account and decided I wanted to buy a dps aura, there is no amount of money in the world that I could pay  to get one, short of buying an account.
---
The best part is that [Mat K publicly replied about it](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c897qt/im_not_voting_no_to_the_current_poll_because_i/esm34gr/?context=3).
---
You need to provide some support for an opinion in order for it to be an argument. Which this doesn‚Äôt have. It may be a valid point that has supporting information out in the world somewhere, but without providing support at the same time as the opinion, it‚Äôs not an argument.
---
House styles and tp animations.
---
Guess I'm a little short-sighted, or *not* paranoid, but that doesn't seem harmful to OSRS integrity.
---
Its called "setting a precedent" and opens doors for the future. Jagex isnt the most reputable company anyway, you mean I should blindly believe them despite giving no reason to trust and believe them over 15 years?
---
If this is polled like I assume it will be then it's a no for sure, but I don't see how it's any different from the purple skin twitch thing that nobody ever complained about.
---
Raise the subscription cost. or increase the prices of bonds.   
---
The problem here isn't that these items are non game changing it's that they don't align with the spirit of OSRS. cosmetic items in the game are all found through a grind like clue scrolls and should not be sold for money.  
---
Sorry for bad english not my main language
---
OP is fake news &amp; I'm officially done with this sub's obsession with being a tinfoil Hat enthusiast. It's gotta so old so fast.
---
And welcome to my guide
---
I certainly hope not
---
Argument definition:
---
&gt;A reason or set of reasons given in support of an idea, action, or theory.
---
No requirement to be supported by evidence.
---
More or less, with the following caveats:
---
* It's cosmetics only (though they're doing the same thing with membership, which is paid anyway)
---
* It's done through a third party sponsor, so the idea is that you buy a partner product (like Twitch Prime), and get a cosmetic in-game for free (like purple skin), with the sponsor supposedly paying Jagex (not explicitly confirmed, but that's what makes this viable)
---
* It's time-locked, so after some period of time, it becomes free for everyone, and the sponsor/paid aspect is no longer involved
---
The issue is that most users here on the sub view that as MTX, while Jagex does not (they explicitly said repeatedly on the blog post that "It's not MTX"). The poll questions are also worded like "Do you want this cosmetic in the game" with no mention of the fact that it's paid, through a third party.
---
Blast furnace best xp.
---
If it does, then it would actually be MTX, and I think a lot of people would quit. This isn‚Äôt MTX yet though.
---
I don't necessarily disagree with not wanting this stuff in the game, it just feels a lot like fighting a battle when the war has already been lost to me.
---
Because they have stopped caring about the game elements of the game. It's all about using carrots to get more players over the actual game world.
---
And then it'll become more than just cosmetics.
---
Vote no. And then we will see their next move and therefore their true goals.
---
No, you‚Äôre thinking of frogs
---
Another tinfoil hatter flying in. Welcome! Everything you said in the first paragraph is literally your own imagination, nothing else. Nothing backs up what you said. The fact that they put this in a poll is what they should have done the first time these things were added and as the amount of these promotions is bigger than before, it's only logical they are polling this considering the shitstorm everything related to anything promotion-based brings to the jmods (example 1, this thread).  
---
Let's see what the definition of MTX or microtransactions is, shall we? Oxford dictionary says it means *a very small financial transaction conducted online.* Wiki narrows it down a bit by saying it's a business model where users can purchase virtual goods with micropayments. Now are people paying Jogkex to get these cosmetics? No, because they are not obtained via microtransactions, but by third-party websites which promote OSRS on their own platforms. These meaningless cosmetics are just a way of getting the word out on these platforms. Do tell me another way Jugglepox could effectively promote themselves on third-party websites other than ways like this. Just because I don't agree with this mindless circle-jerk doesn't make a bootlicker
---
Agility.
---
Eoc will be lower. Isnt the playerbase falling like a rock?
---
I don't think anyone paid for astroturfing or whatever. 
---
Jagex just convinced a lot of people with some good PR. It worked until people actually started to think about it.
---
Buddy it‚Äôs called an abyssal tentacle
---
Imagine being someone higher up at a company and your in control of bringing in money. You want a promotion/more money/etc. so how will you go about it? Past few years gaming companies have gotten lazy with ‚Äúwhat product/service can we produce to bring in more money‚Äù and instead just started essentially copying mtx which started from phone app games like clash of clans and has now stemmed over to major games like COD, BF, and now even MMORPGs.
---
Yeah I always felt bad for the mods around when MTX first came into the game. They had to do it
---
God forbid people wanted to compare themselves to others in a MMO....this argument was always weak. If I wanted to just worry about myself in a bubble with no rankings I would play a single player game.
---
Not completely true. There was initially at peast one event that granted a cosmetic if you bought membership during it (green skin.)
---
I do understand that add-ons can be incredibly useful to help you learn, but nowadays its gotten to a point where people with high kc of a boss will continue to use these plugins without knowing about the boss mechanics whatsoever, just because the client tells you where you need to click. Again, at that point its down to if you want to actually experience the game yourself or have the client play for you.
---
Someone should bit every world with that.
---
boycott
---
Man I hope people vote no to all this shit. 
---
Either put it in the game properly or dont put it in at all. None of this partnership bullshit. And this comes from someone that claims twitch prime bonus crap all the time.
---
So you've played this game for 15 years, had membership for at least some of that time, clearly enjoy the game the company has made, but still don't trust them &amp; you blame THEM for it?
---
at most you would get 3rd degree burns before you realize that its too hot
---
Use on a human enemy to make them non-aggressive
---
The idea is give an inch, take a mile. People are afraid this is just the start (bonds were just the start, but ‚òï)
---
uh, this is the link to the original concept back in 2011 for what was then the main game (pre-rs3)
---
So that's what the zipper on my Willy is good for!
---
Where has this acceptance that "just cosmetic stuff" somehow makes it OK?
---
There is more to the game than XP. People spend hundreds or thousands of hours grinding for "just cosmetics".
---
Damn, true
---
They were purchased recently. This is why we should be fearful of what's to come. The timing is too convenient.
---
That's a poor business model since thousands of people left the game to never return again.
---
Jagexs' integrity dropped faster than a 1def pure against dragon claws when Mat left. 
---
Dirty poll questions happened with EoC too. Anyone remember that? 5 answers, 4 if which counted as a yes. 
---
Jagex - you will not be able to release another "Old School" again and this game can die just as easily with poor management. There is no second chance anymore.
---
UN-SU-STAI-NA-BLE
---
I had to quit red 3 as well as I couldn‚Äôt trust myself. when your working and earning you feel the need to drop money into them and you only increase the amount you spend over time until you realize you are in trouble spending far to much on the ‚Äúbest deal‚Äù micro transaction. 
---
I had to leave rs3 behind as well.
---
They have a full day night cycle I believe. I‚Äôm not a fan of rs3 but it‚Äôs pretty cool
---
they can but they also run the risk of whoever was involved in whistle blowing

Auras started with minor benefits though. First low iter auras were added with small boosts. Then a year down they released absolutely game changing auras, now its an essential part of both PvM and skilling in RS3.
---
So you were just as outraged over Game Blast and Special Effect?
---
*Gn'omesayin'
---
The fuck. You'd have to dumb as fuck to buy MTX for a single player game.
---
The worst argument you could've taken was what you did - trying to argue that buying in-game stuff with money is not mtx - which it literally is
---
Is members free?
---
No?
---
Is there anyway to obtain loyalty points besides paying money?
---
Well then...
---
So this is a step in that direction.
---
Can you see that adding things to membership itself is not "new forms of MTX"? You are not paying for anything "new", it is adding on to what you get for the payment you already make. You haven't actually refuted my argument, you are just spewing sentences without regard for the words you are actually saying.
---
nice

I think I'd pay to not have any MTX further than bonds in the game, especially since I already do.
---
I just wanted to get the bow since it's a high-level ranged weapon. This was my only chance to get one, because Song of Elves will remove Dark Beasts from the Catacombs.
---
nice one bro :)
---
Out of the loop, havent played in 2 months. What's going on?
---
A new player experience should be a world event or something. A promo for ingame stuff is tacky. It at least feels like your point boils down to "the new cosmetics don't even look that good yet." Just because the devs bring us great content doesn't mean anything about Jagex. While I dislike the community being spammed with anti-mtx negativity, you shouldn't be so confident in Jagex considering they have a massive track record of ruining games
---
You're buying someone else a membership and getting a few mil in return
---
The cognitive dissonance in this community regarding mtx is staggering. Paying real money and receiving in-game gold is the most pure and obvious form of mtx that has ever existed. You can argue that it's good for the game, that's it's ok to make the exception because xyz, that it's not important because the very high price of the gp makes it a non-issue, whatever. But to deny that it exists and continue making "all mtx = bad" or "I'm leaving the second any mtx is introduced" comments is just delusional
---
And, did you use it? I'm on the fence.
---
I'm more worried that they would steal the account.
---
This is honestly probably the best argument against the proposed cosmetics. I don't buy into any of this "Jagex is trying to foist MTX on us wake up sheeple", but Mat K did point out that finding rewards is often difficult; presumably he would know.
---
If i was a murder and enjoyed murdering i would want to murder. Doesn't make it fucking ethical.
---
If you get 30 construction, start herblore and maybe do some agillity you can do solos. Find a world, run around the room and keep all braziers on until it's at 50%, then the bottom 2 until 20-25% and then one constantly until 5-10%. When it's under 10% you get randomly hit or snowfall about 5 times per hour and you can go on as long as you want/until you run out of food. The brazier breaks a lot too, so you get a shitton of construction exp and that's worth a *lot* of gp.
---
Make 2 potions after you light the last brazier and when you run out make 4 :)
---
RemindMe! 3 years "lol told you so"
---
i totally agree with u and it will actually boost hopefully the players. Hopefully there will be more active playersinstead of bots only.

Please can we have skillcape teleports work at 30 wilderness and below? It seems underwhelming for a skillcape of achievement.
---
Time to make ososrs
---
Plus it doesn't even make any sense lore and art wise.
---
Think it stands on the back of previous actions jagex have done that were similar in its history. Because they did quite literally kill there own game previously with MTX(which is still that way). 
---
To a lot of people it feels like a stepping stone path leading to additional ways of getting money. 
---
Players don‚Äôt want to be constantly advertised to when they are playing a recreational game too. 
---
Sorry if it seems a bit basic but to its core players don‚Äôt want to see jagex regress
---
We don't know yet.
---
Tbh, I really dont think they'll do that because of the risk of it getting exposed. That would literally forever destroy the trust between Jagex and the community
---
I mean they can bring in new players without having cosmetic skins, items, etc. most rs partnerships have been doing fine by giving out 2-4 weeks of membership. I don‚Äôt think adding a cosmetic item will make someone more likely to play the game. Or, just release the cosmetic item for everyone when the partnership goes through.
---
woah this guy is using the pointing emote and has grey skin LITERALLY A MONTH BEFORE ME REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RUNESCAPE IS RUINED.
---
You really underestimate our race don‚Äôt you. Look at the game fortnight or even league of legends . Yes if someone sees orange skin and they figure that they need to get twitch prime to get it ; they will . There is so many models on this and osrs is not only the exception . There is even business data on this sort of things ; exclusive things play on the human mind .
---
*pushes up glasses*  The fall of the Roman Republic didn't start with Caesar! It started with Marius and Sulla *scoff* lmao. 
---
It started with land reforms pushed by the Gracchi, you pleb.
---
Mat K's point about meaningful rewards being hard to find is probably the best point against the proposed cosmetics. I don't buy into what people are saying about "Jagex is trying to foist MTX on us wake up sheeple", but the mod formerly known as Mat K would know if rewards are hard to come by or not.
---
and the Golden Gnome goes too...
---
It‚Äôs a very dangerous first step. The first true step towards mtx. Slippery slope and all, people have a right to be concerned.
---
&gt;see EA/Activision
---
You don't really have to go that far. Reality is that every company that has shareholders (private or public) will have to maximize profits simply because to the people investing on the company it's just a matter of numbers and they want to see numbers grow. The difference between companies is how much the company is able to resist these shareholders pushing their changes.
---
50/50 could be an alt or could be mom's credit card
---
Credibility is not based on age. Some random old person does not automatically know more than a politician who studied history about a certain country's history and laws just because 'he lived there longer'. 
---
I had no reason to state that I played back then because it was irrelevant to the topic. The period pre-MTX was before Jagex realised just how horribly shitty of a mistake it was, and judging by the fact they've stated explicitly, multiple times that they acknowledge introducing MTX would kill their company, I think they know better now and have learned over the 6 years. That was my point.
---
"People spend hundreds or thousands of hours grinding for "just cosmetics"." Yeah all 3 players with champions cape or castle wars armour
---
I never said I know what people want. If "cc" in a classic dungeon is your requirement for a good time, I guess I really don't know what people want.
---
Here's hoping vanilla clears you guys out, so Blizz doesn't have to cater towards braindead content and finally can move past endless filler
---
I feel soery for them. They put passion in what they do, some been players before developers, and must be really hertbreaking beimg pushee to create that shit content.
---
I dint think you actually understand how much it costs to run an actual game on actually good servers, especially in the silicon fen, where jagex is based. Cambridge and oxford have some of the highest estate values in the UK. 
---
Also this accounts for rs3 too, which is where the majority of thier money is coming in from.
---
And the dragon bolts that don't work on it!
---
Let's look at two hypothetical situations. 
---
1. Let's say you get an emote if you subscribe to Netflix for a month. In this case, you have to pay extra money to a third party in order to acquire something in-game. This means money has to be spent outside the 11$ you already pay. This means it's a microtransaction or MTX.
---
2. Let's say you get an emote if you subscribe to the official Runescape Youtube channel. This doesn't cost money, so it's not MTX.
---
The first situation already happened with the Twitch Prime promotion last year (and is bad). The second option is something that already happened in RS3, like the release of the chrome goggles:  [https://runescape.wiki/w/Chrome\_goggles](https://runescape.wiki/w/Chrome_goggles) 
---
The second option is no problem at all. But they didn't specify what the promotions actually are, which is shady.
---
Yeah they do
---
It's called making money and being greedy, while willingly hurting your hardcore long time fans because they're a minority and you'd rather cater to the majority because money. It's called greed. And greed is a bad thing. 
---
This reddit is that minority, so you sure as hell expect they'll fight back against this
---
If you think theyre faking polls they can do it with or without showing it
---
Basically what they're saying is you're paranoid, dumb and can't read.
---
There's a growth cap for bussinesses dealing with finite resources, if you deal with intangibles, creativity has no cap nor limit (which also affect limited resources). Don't be this retarded
---
If you make a combustion motor x2 efficiency you're doubling the available fossil fuel resources as a consequence. Think about it kiddo
---
Are they actually adding mtx into the game or is that kind of a joke going around the sub?  I don‚Äôt frequent here often and just want to know if I should cancel my membership before it renews.
---
Registering for an amazon prime account and connecting twitch prime to your rs account
---
Troll evidence
---
Lol us Aussies suffered through 200-250 ping on US west coast worlds for 4 years...
---
They would still own all the servers and thus could still ban your account from connecting to their servers.
---
That‚Äôs really bizarre. In my brief wildly Slayer experience, once I‚Äôd been TB‚Äôd I was unable to use a tab. I doubt they changed it as it would kind of make teleblock useless
---
I still don't understand how this is MTX thought. Using a subscription on a different website to be given a total pointless item 2 weeks before other people is not a micro transaction.
---
I agree with other languages although it would cost a huge amount to begin with unless you managed to convince players to translate the entire game for free but mini games are useless as how does that increase profits?
---
Growing the game itself is one thing but growing profits is another and as a business they will not sit there and just be like "Yeah this is fine." That doesn't happen.
---
They did one with Twitch earlier, which is why we have purple skin in-game. It's mentioned in the blog. Any future partnerships would have to depend upon which partners they find.
---
Osrs has been steadily gaining subscribers, even after the price hike. You‚Äôre acting as if the game is dying and Jagex needs to take drastic action now. Diluting an old school, rewards based game with unearned cosmetics is just about the dumbest thing you can do short of MTX.
---
Right. But even then you can only purchase a finite amount of points, so there's always gonna be a time-lock to buy all the auras you need.
---
Okay thanks, I'm pretty on the fence on this one.
---
he was just disagreeing with you, not calling your opinion invalid
---
? You're on droprate on useful items
---
You're purchasing early exclusive access. Why is this so difficult for you to understand?
---
Even people currently running for president of the US don't know the difference...
---
/r/iamverysmart/
---
What's wrong with that? Players like that are the item sinks we need. Come in, spend $200 on bonds to get buyable bis and then try and stand in the ge to flex how they never could in actual 07.
---
Keyword try. Any RS player can see that they are bond warriors. They didnt grind for it, they will eventually quit, and those items will be removed from circulation.
---
And thats not even to mention that gp is so easy to get these days that bonds essentially have 0 value for people that have been playing for over 6 months unless you are a staking addict.
---
Here's how I've tried to explain it:
---
The champion's cape does not have value as a cosmetic, it has value as an achievement. If it were easy to get, nobody would wear it.
---
Nobody works to achieve things because they look cool, they work to get things that show achievement.
---
So people shouldn't equate cosmetics from promotions to a champions cape or a phas flag or whatever. One shows achievement, one does not.
---
What MTX?
---
Yeah, let‚Äôs forget about the lore and being immersed in a consistent world.
---
Hey I‚Äôm from the 717 too! What a small world.. cheers
---
Then please make sure to vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on the poll. Despite their poor efforts to mask it, the way the questions are written is a blatant effort to hide that the real thing being polled isn‚Äôt the individual skins/house themes but the partnership system itself.
---
Lmao that fucking abyssal demon cut out
---
Tell me, why exactly is mtx bad? Is it because the company makes money? Or is it because one player just buying an achievement screws up the fun for everyone else?
---
Ok, Jagex gets the same amount of money (which isn't actually true, because bonds are slightly more expensive than straight up membership, but whatever, it's negligible). And yes, it does allow people to buy membership easier, but for every player who does that, there is another who now has a pile of gold that they did not earn in-game. Is that not the part of mtx that people have a problem with?
---
You‚Äôre paying money and getting an ingame reward. That‚Äôs a micro transaction, whether or not you pay jiggflag or amazon is irrelevant.
---
Get the other frog out of there, RS3 never gradually turned into MTX.  The very first addition of MTX in RS3 was buying SoF spins.  There was no "it's cosmetic only", they went right for the jugular.
---
"We will not add a Grand Exchange to OSRS"
---
1. Membership itself by definition is a microtransaction. You're paying real life money for exclusive content.
---
2. You stated: "Giving more features to the basic subscription is not "MTX"" is absolutely correct and you're misinterpreting my original statements if you think I would disagree with that.
---
&gt;You seem to keep saying "new form" and keep saying a new feature of being a member is "new MTX". This is blatantly wrong
---
3. A new feature of being a member **is** MTX **when** it requires you to pay more money than you normally   
---
would have. I addressed this earlier when you said the "Loyalty program without the ability to strictly buy   
---
points is not MTX.". I argued it is because " The loyalty program incentivized staying subscribed when you   
---
would have otherwise unsubscribed for exclusive ingame rewards. Meaning; you were paying more real   
---
life money than you would have otherwise for ingame advantages. Literally the definition of MTX."
---
Truly ironic that you were the one who said:
---
&gt;  You haven't actually refuted my argument, you are just spewing sentences without regard for the words you are actually saying. 
---
Nah that's all you buddy. You were the one that took this circular because you responded too quick without regard for what my argument was.
---
Try: team cable 
---
They are good guy
---
Yep they are going to kill the game just like eoc lmao
---
I enjoy RC and agility
---
I'm not acting like the game is dying, I'm looking at this from a business perspective. They want to increase profits and increase player count and just leaving it to happen naturally is a bad decision. Do you have any suggestions on how to increase profits that won't get the internet to shout at you?
---
Not only that, but in 2017 they again promised to scale back promotions... and then had a new promo almost every day for the next 2 years.
---
Certainly, you have the right to be concerned. But this is beyond concern, borderline frantic panic. It's a bit dramatic.
---
I used to love farming on my old RS2 account before I abandoned it. Also a big fan of Slayer; the variety keeps it interesting while still being relatively afk with decent profit
---
:crab:
---
Didnt you suggest this last time
---
 ü¶Ä
---
Theres a post on the main site about it. Basically some cosmetics for teleports/POH styles that will be for "promotions" with other companies. So to get them you will have to sign up to that presumably paid service or wait for it to "eventually" come to everyone. I think it's shitty because these cosmetics should be rewards for ingame grinds.
---
So don't do it and get the item anyway. That is not a microtransation, it's an incentive.
---
That still doesnt mean that we should dictate how Jagex beings new people into the game. You'd basically be voting on turning OSRS into a private gentleman's club.
---
If a company has zero or negative revenue and/or profit growth then something the company is doing is wrong
---
All I can think about is how much printer ink the top half of that paper took
---
Just because the last partnership took 1 month does not mean the next one will follow the same pattern. That‚Äôs like ordering a pizza and getting it in 30 minutes then next time you order a pizza the estimated delivery time says 30 minutes and you‚Äôre expecting it in 30 minutes because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what happened last time‚Äù but then it actually takes 1 hour this time because they burned the pizza and had to remake it.
---
You can‚Äôt base the wait time on 1 event. It takes multiple events for something to become a pattern and then you can make legitimate estimates instead of saying ‚Äúit happened last time so that means it‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen this time.‚Äù
---
Age is not credibility correct, but age = experience and experience = credibility. If you ignore history you are doomed to repeat or however it goes. And all companies bend to the will of money. So the sane choice often fails to greed.
---
It's not comparable to bonds. Bonds are generally ok for the existing player base because that they are an option for players who don't want to or can't to spend IRL money to access the games content without paying. So yes they are a form of MTX for the bond purchaser, but also some kind of reverse-MTX for the bond user.
---
There are several arguments against this change, that do not remotely apply to bonds, such as:
---
1. It relies on the false premise that cosmetics are not important to the game. People grind for pets, champion capes, castlewars armour, graceful, and more. Some of these grinds take hundreds of hours. Cosmetics matter and in order for them to attract players, they have to look awesome without any effort.
---
2. What kind of players will this attract? Are these the type of players that will be beneficial for the long-term health of OSRS? How will these players affect future polls on MTX? OSRS is not built on instant gratification, and giving it to new players will leave them frustrated when they realise if they want that awesome looking pet, it will probably mean at least hundreds of hours of grinding, if not thousands.
---
3. What kind of a message does this send to shareholders? If there's already one foot in the door with "partnerships" offering exclusive items in-game, and most successful games on the market with insane profits have MTX, what do you think they will push for?
---
Fucking called it btw
---
If they do then quit, vote with your f**king wallets, and also i think they have already learned from rs3 what damage p2w elements can do.
---
it's probably becoming harder and harder to attract potential investors with such small profits
---
Well, we had a good run boys. 
---
See you when oldschool oldschool RuneScape is released.
---
Literally every part of our poll options are equivalent to promoting mtx and I'm not voting yes to any of them. Everyone should always have the same level of access to everything the game has to offer given they earned it IN GAME and not by using their money to buy it. This is the same exact shitty reason why I never so much as think of playing RS3 and only pity that game. Don't go back to where you went wrong the first time.
---
My pet peeve was the caches. Was the most efficient means to train div but I hated having to wait every 3 hours or whatever it was. Eventually the changed it to have a cache every hour which was nice though. But on my iron I always felt obligated to spend the next 20min after a cache using that bonus
---
Why would you ‚Äòhave faith‚Äô the game is already growing, and they‚Äôre pulling in record profits, and Osrs has surpassed rs3. Why do they need to do this?
---
Lol you're not wrong
---
I haven't played in a few months but would like to vote no on this. Is that an option in the voting booths at the current moment?
---
Well, this is awkward.
---
But Solomon and the membership loyalty was in 2011, which is before squeal, so, do your research before calling others out when you are wrong yourself.
---
They give away the cosmetic first to subscribers to that partner, then in 2 weeks everyone gets it. They don't get anything out of new subscribers to the partner.
---
The first promotion (the 1 month free membership from Twitch promotio ) went south real fast. The influx of bots was and still is insane. I'd suggest watching youtube on "Emblem bots".. Also basic resources (fish, ores etc..) are straight up camped
---
I think people might be a little skeptical since rs3 seemed to snowball out of control into mtx crazytown
---
most players won't read it they will only read it as "wow these seem cool they should be added" and completely ignore the context and reasoning.
---
I think you're either responding to the wrong person or you didnt read my comment?
---
No character skins are locked behind content. Emotes and teleportation animations do not need content gates to be added to the game. There are countless cosmetics in osrs that are utter shit and require no effort or achievement to acquire. Less content is the opposite of what you requested in your last post and is what would lead to the game growing stale.
---
Regardless of how you feel about MTX, how you define MTX, and whether you like or dislike these cosmetics, this should be something we can all get on board with.
---
Just in case people dont know. This gave xp, cash up to 200m at first (500m later), and any item in the game like divine.
---
Get rid of the free membership promos and the issue will lessen significantly.
---
rofl a year, your opinion means absolutely fucking nothing, why are you even allowed to vote on the polls
---
This is the best argument I've seen so far, completely agree
---
Of course some of the artwork placed here is phenomenal, and we see that daily for free. But to be totally honest I can't see me spending real money for fashion items... Hopefully that's all it is
---
There's nothing unlucky about this?

You seriously think Overeatch is what did it? Jesus christ, you haven't been paying attention.

You can‚Äôt use life refreshers outside of bank though. And you could have an infinite amount of them, if you don‚Äôt have the skill to kill 4K telos, you can‚Äôt kill him. Evil lucario has 170+ 4000% enrage telos kills and he still dies often
---
Why autoclick?
---
We get it you‚Äôre a super smart person who‚Äôs read that shitty info graphic of logical fallacies that gets spammed onto Reddit all the time.

Maybe try to come up with an actual argument instead of spamming buzz-words.
---
One server in Brazil and another one in Colombia should do the trick. Brazil will cover the souther part of south america and Colombia the northen and most of the central part of latinamerica.
---
The problem is, people in Colombia, Venezuela and Panama would still continue using the USA-East servers instead of the Brazil servers to play because it would provide way better ping-
---
1) Never botted? Sure thing homie.
---
2) (from comment) "The scammer that took my acc yesterday..."
---
So in all honesty, even if you didn't bot you are stupid enough to get your account "stolen" which also tells me you probably don't have authenticator, bank-pin and 2fa on your e-mail.
---
imo, deserved. Take this as a big lesson about security.
---
That‚Äôs not irrelevant at all. It gives the people a choice, if they choose to support the game, then they can and they get rewarded for by getting certain things earlier. That‚Äôs it, but people they understand that certain individuals don‚Äôt have extra income to spend, so they are STILL getting that same reward. HUGE DIFFERENCE, than not getting it at all if they don‚Äôt spend money.
---
We were promised ZERO MTX, now we‚Äôre being told this isnt actually MTX/this particular MTX isnt that bad.
---
Jagex cannot be trusted to limit itself, and everything, cosmetic or not has value in OSRS, things unearned should not be given.
---
Well there is no way OSRS will become mass P2W. I have faith in that sentence. Whether or not they'll add "in your face MTX" is another thing. They might. 
---
Lets just all ~~stop flaming Jagex and chill out~~ shitpost on Reddit all day until they notice, which they probably already have but haven't replied to anything yet due to their PR bullshit.
---
I always wondered how many even have this cape.
---
Since it requires multiple 1/5000 drop rates to even obtain.
---
No, they‚Äôre really not.
---
Not sure if you're aware but it's the exact same company, with the exact same investors and CEO.
---
I didn‚Äôt fail a single obstacle during mep2 at 68 agility.
---
Tldr. I honestly don't care I'm just sick of you no lifers posting a complaining post every two minutes. If you don't like to vote no. I never vote because I don't care. But all of the whiney cunts have convinced me to vote yes on this one. Cause if the most insufferable people think it's the end of the world it's probably not a big deal at all.
---
That was not how RS3 started... It started in RS2 with Paid Membership Card Promotions. Though the big difference is that those promotion items were only from the cards while the planned promotion items are only exclusive to the promotion for a limited time. Also, I wouldn't say that these promotions are trying to lock in subscriptions like the Loyalty Programme since there is no penalty for missing a promotion or such. But yah, the Loyalty Programme was one of the biggest mistakes of RS2/RS3.
---
But they won't, I bet you that they see the bot infestation as a positive thing since "Muh new players!! look at the numberrrs!"
---
It's not about them joining for a skin colour, it's the exposure to osrs that the affiliates will bring alongside the partnership. People that don't know that osrs is a thing.
---
Oakdice website
---
they will release a PR response in a few weeks after they rethink how to add them without telling players
---
These players can go fuck off to rs3. Enjoy it, I wont hate, buy if you dare to ruin my game again there will be fucking hell to pay
---
Adding a purple skin and giving 1 free month members isn't restricting any content. If you call purple fucking skin content then you gotta sit down and think for a second.
---
Agreed. I grinded out the awful early level hunter on my iron to unlock aerial fishing to try and get the anglers outfit there. Turns out it will take 40 HOURS! That's ridiculous for a skilling outfit at the lowest level and definitely needs a buff to pearl xp rates
---
Easy on there pal, you're speaking the truth.
---
Companies don't like that.
---
All of these epic changes just in time to quit for Classic WoW
---
There was no reason, not shocking considering that you also seem to lack any
---
1) you can look at my stats online, iambenjamin was the character name. they‚Äôre not botting stats but my word against the world I guess. 
---
2) I was dumb enough, check my post history from yesterday. 
---
I had an authenticator, set so they didn‚Äôt get my stuff. Only possible idea is that I used OSBuddy once but Jagex said that wasn‚Äôt a problem
---
The horseman of pestilence?
---
Auras are also a tad different since they indirectly sell Loyalty Points as part of the Premier Club. And they also have a huge impact on combat; imagine if Super Potions or Prayers were locked behind a time-gated item that could only be obtained quicker by throwing more money at it.
---
I'm out of the loop. What time gated cosmetics are we talking about?
---
You the same guy that posted it on another post or have you copy and pasted this from there.
---
Yo man. Can you get me some bonds so i can start playing again ?
---
Haven't played on official servers since Cata.

Sup brother, i got a 120MB internet wich is a good one for brazil, my ping is 6 on any game, but at runescape this stay at 200+

You could already swap currencies for bonds before they came out, it was more of a loophole being closed.
---
I'm voting yes so I can see the tears on reddit about rigged polls
---
But you just said there‚Äôs less than a handful, which means less than 5 things to do.. if I‚Äôm correct.. that‚Äôs a lot more than 5 fingers worth of things to do..
---
F2P Pking would be a good place to start, you can work on learning the tic system, how to one tic your 2h, when to eat, when to risk etc. 
---
F2P pking is all I do so if you have advice on that you can pm me if you want, for membs other people on this sub would be way more helpful
---
WoW has intial price, monthly subscription and wow tokens. It also has 10 times more players
---
People are thinking voting no to the pool would mean anything now. You are voting no for which rewards there will be, but there will still be rewards.
---
To be totally honest, if they fuck up again then I'm leaving for good. I can't be asked tobsink another 6 years of my life to start over...again.
---
That‚Äôs not at all what exclusive means in its definition. The fact that everyone who plays will be able to get it makes it non-exclusive
---
To be fair I'd rather see 1,000 baby dragons then those big, screen flooding things used by people who wanna grief skillets.
---
Y'ALL KNOW WHO Y'ALL ARE!
---
summoning was the death of rs2. curses pissed on the rotting corpse. eoc fucked what was left.
---
It's not terrible for the game at all. Bonds do not generate gp, they only transfer it between players.
---
Fucking excellent
---
this is like comparing apples and roast beef sandwiches
---
Poorly, but it does.
---
Alch yourself.
---
Clear proposal being the very taste of deceit we've endured from countless gaming company's. Given Jagex has a history on this list I feel that everyone is justified in being skeptical.
---
Good question
---
Bonds are an attempt to tackle an actual problem, gold selling, not just there for no reason. It kinda sucks but it's some of the only understandable MTX because people will buy gold no matter what.
---
What problem is adding buyable cosmetics going to fix? Nothing. It's just for profit.
---
If you've observed the game throughout its life cycle, you'd notice. There are also some pretty interesting glass door reviews of devs being *required* to use runescript, an antiquated, proprietary development kit and language instead of unity, which ended up making any work clunky and challenging. The managers didn't understand how anything worked, yet they set standards and goals and would not listen to subordinates.
---
Also, MMG's actions and management completely fucked the game with eoc in spite of the ample feedback provided by the players loud and clear. They worked 2 years on eoc before release, and they refused to scrap it because of the resource sink. The bullheaded upper management's stubbornness cost them dearly when their playerbase left literally overnight.
---
There's a lot of out-of-touch higher up management who enrich themselves.
---
Are you familiar with Jagex's other game adventures and how they turned out? Funorb, Chronicle, AoG, Transformers Universe, Block and Load, Stellar Dawn, and there are like 10 others I can't recall right now. They all flopped disastrously. They've been coasting off the Gower brothers' success forever, and that's their only asset. They spent millions of dollars and thousands of man hours updating runescape, and it has over 4x fewer players as the version of the same game *without* non-gower Jagex updates. Reverting to the Gower bros game was the best business decision that jagex has ever made.
---
It's the most frustrating thing in the world. It's like watching a retarded baby tear up money because it enjoys the sound of ripping more than the value of the money.
---
mining level doesn‚Äôt effect rate that you get dense essence, only the rate at which it depletes
---
I like rs3
---
Why would someone that took your acc just yesterday start randomly botting on it. Instead of just taking your shit and leave . And bot their own acc. Take the loss bro . You boy you lose . Shit my maxed main has been banned sense 2014 for botting and I took it
---
Firstly, the idea is terrible, things for free have no value, and only serve to devalue other earned cosmetics.
---
Second, these promotionals have done tremendous damage to the economy by flooding us with bots.
---
Third, and possibly my favourite, Jagex calling for new sources of revenue and more users, despite record profitability, revenue AND player count year after year from 2013 (bar 2014).
---
They are getting greedy, pushing for more monetisation in a game that is already successful, already popular, that already had a subscription price hike, that pays its developers comparatively poorly to the industry average (hence massive overturn), and keeps its overheads down by offering near no support. Whether you like it, this is the bottom line.
---
Set up a bingo card for it.
---
Hahaha and you wanna tell me and other people that the focus of wow hasn't changed and should remain a hardcore grindy MMO and there is nothing wrong with it, "because other people might enjoy it." Old wow is dead, make way for the new age old man
---
friendly reminder that this sub is infested with rs3tards that are conditioned to open their wallets whenever daddy jagex offers them a new solomon store item or some bonus experience
---
those cunts will vote yes no matter what
---
The last count was just a couple hundred capes in game
---
"Oh no I'm being arrested for not taking these people's hard earned cash! I'm being forced I tell you, forced, to take this money! I don't want to, because I'm so generous, but I'm required to I swear!"
---
Temple trekking not trouble brewing
---
You are right that people can get themself gold. But that does not eliminate the leveling process. Getting 99 herblore will still take a very long time, you just dont jump from 1-99 in a matter of minutes. 
---
The process of selling bonds is essentially a transfer of time. Player A farms gold to get a bond. Player B skips a few hours of farming by selling a Bond. This process does always involve 2 players, it is not one sided.
---
Whereas cosmetics and other things would be a one way trade. You pay money and get an item. You could do that infinitely, which would not be possible with bonds ( theres a limit to how many bonds you can sell, you would not be able to sell 100k+ bonds on the ge)
---
In conclusion: the only thing i accept is transfering membership time. Nothing else.
---
Surely Jagex know the main reason people choose to play OSRS over RS3? To get away from that shit P2W scene. If they do add combat improvement that you can buy with real money then they'll get a ridiculous amount of hate and will literally be forced to remove it. 
---
Anyone remember when EA added loot boxes which you could buy to get really insane combat improvements to Star Wars Battlefront II? The community fucking hated it (obviously) and it was removed about a day or two later.
---
i just checked, it's not on both of those (not on the slayer helm/enchanted gem log because it's not a monster that has a slayer level req to kill i guess...)
---
What's beneficial of cosmetics?
---
The burn rates are different at the start (first level you can cook it) for every food in the game and decrease at a hardcoded rate.
---
Check the wiki for burnrates at 99 (if the food never stops burning) or it will list the level at which you no longer stop burning, if it exists.
---
Cooking cape makes you never burn, cooking gauntlets have a separate hardcoded override.
---
Micro-transaction. If it requires a monetary transaction you could loosely define it as MTX
---
Yeah because obviously purple skin promo was only reason why Jagex earned more than year before
---
The Twitch Prime Partnership was a raving success! Look at the number of \*people\* creating new accounts and enjoying the game 8 hours non-stop daily! The number don't lie!
---
Hacked accounts are botted on.
---
The irony of posting that in an OSRS subreddit is just astounding.
---
FWIW with the influx of the ‚Äúnew gen‚Äù mobile community i think they would vote yes to this if they followed my guidelines.  How many vote though would be something to consider.
---
I just want people to be sober and avoid the tribal bullshit.  Toxic af and not productive.
---
Is it? I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs really fun when the new expansions come out but the in between time kinda sucks and everyone unsubs
---
except I‚Äôve literally never botted. not appealing for a stranger to believe me on the internet, but it is what it is. if I got caught red handed for sure I‚Äôd accept it, but I haven‚Äôt done what I was banned for.
---
I know what you're saying but how do you want them to prove a negative with anything but words.
---
Yeah I know, but the trend only really started with OW because whenever anyone talks about lootboxes, they usually use the OW lootbox (as in, in articles as a picture or in videos). Hearthstone packs are basically like the physical card games packs, which somehow are overlooked. 
---
Where else did the name "lootbox" come from?
---
Purple skin has absolutely no effect on the game though, calling it a terrible addition when your gameplay is unaffected is a bit..... excessive
---
I know I'll probably be downvoted for this opinion, but I'm gonna vote however I see fit when the poll is released. I have no issues with MTX because I have the free will to just not buy them.
---
Played CoD for many years and never spent a penny on cosmetic crates and supply drops. If I can resist the giant money gremlin that is Activision, I can resist Jagex.
---
"No botting stats" 
---
that's not an argument, a good try atleast. No offense, but you have the typical bot users  (Specific throw-away accounts, dont care about ban) 
---
And you have the this is my main, I bot slightly here and there I don't play absurd hours and my stats dont look weird so I must be OK-botters.
---
See, the latter comes to reddit/twitter. You don't get handed false perma's they are done by hand by a Jmod themselves and trust me, they can definitely see what you did and how in-game :P
---
But best of luck to you, maybe you are innocent, maybe not. But take a look at twitter/reddit/forums for Jagex customer support. How many fakes there are and draw ur own conclusions :p
---
People forget Jagex was in trouble as a business when player count for RS3 plummeted. They pollled interest in a version of runescape that would be run differently and with a different mindset from rs3. Doing anything to make the osrs have more similar, negative qualities from rs3 would just put them in trouble again. 
---
Also everyone keeps making the slippery slope argument, yet four years since bonds were released we don‚Äôt have squeal of fortune or anything of the like.
---
I don‚Äôt believe there was this much uproar about the twitch prime skin yeesh... maybe because of the month free membership?...
---
its always like this. theres too many fanboys out there  naively trusting every word.
---
Hi OldSchool Team!
---
i have a question, if the current sponsor polls fail.
---
will you ever re-poll these "cosmetics" as an ingame feature that just costs a huge sum of GP?
---
the ideas are really cool and i would **LOVE** the Freeze emote in the game but the sponsorship stuff has me voting no this poll.
---
thanks if you're reading this.
---
New customers -&gt; more money. Pretty simple concept.
---
If they thought the new money from new customers was going to outweigh the loss of those who would quit due to MTX, they‚Äôd add MTX to the game in a heartbeat and very quickly go back on their word of 
---
‚ÄúNo MTX!! Except you know... in this case, that scenario, and what we really mean is.... not that! But this...‚Äù
---
I know what they wrote, they wrote similar things when they killed RS2. Do you have a short memory?
---
Lmao yeah probably this. The typical late response with some cheap remake of their original ideas
---
It's live now, go vote!
---
More like not enough money to meet the profit quotas set by chinese overlords.
---
think bigger beyond yourself, we have a prime example called runescape 3, do u like rs3? are the mtxs that game has acceptable to u? then vote yes. if this passes theres a massive chance it wont be the end of the ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù talk.
---
Reading some of these comments and big yikes. 
---
It amazes me that the same people that are complaining about partner cosmetics are also defending bonds, which are arguably the worst thing to ever hit osrs. Bonds allow you to real world trade gold legitimately. If you're playing a non-ironman account, you know that money is the deciding factor on how fast you train through armor, expensive materials, etc. Something that might take 10 hours if you spent 10m might take 26 hours if you spent only 3m. That lead to the fun part of the game, where you can either go cheap and spen more time training the skill or go grind out more money. Now, we can just RWT and train super quickly and it's all legal. I remember the good ol' days of people with expensive gear and not banned were impressive , now it's just a "who's willing to spend the most money" type deal. 
---
This is the exact reason I quit oldschool runescape. They're gonna keep snowballing different ways to allow and add MTX but give some half baked justification on how and why it's not MTX. Bonds are MTX but some how they've managed to convince nearly everyone that they aren't.
---
Fuck that‚Äôs the best use of this format so far
---
Patch notes:
---
*All saradomin brews renamed to sardomin dew (tm), only open to players with a Mountain Dew subscription for 30 days. Go fuck yourselves.*
---
This is just simply bullshit. 
---
Jagex has a history for implementing changes that go agaisn't the communities wishes and look how that panned out for them in the end. They have a main game with 15k players on it.
---
They got rid of free-trade. 
---
They got rid of the wilderness. 
---
They released Eoc. 
---
Those 3 things alone, made the playerbase drop so low that they felt like they had to re-introduce OSRS again to make any money.
---
Mr. Softeeee
---
Micro transactions
---
No they dont, it just boosts you to the current expansion. As a runescape player I know that probably still sounds like blasphemy, but in wow things that arent in the latest expansion are dead content. 
---
In runescape, leveling *is the game*, in wow, leveling is just an archaic mechanic nobody actually cares about. You can hit max level in like 16 hours anyway, it means nothing.
---
Why do you think i made a throwaway acc? To protect my account from losing measly spare change? Lmao stay poor, hoarder
---
We already have battle Royale though
---
Bonds move and remove wealth from the game. That is a fact.
---
The hard truth breaks people‚Äôs fragile bubbles
---
I knew the 717 had a huge RuneScape fan base.
---
[Doing my part as well](https://imgur.com/a/O7UiOBx) Keep up the good fight my brothers.

Doesnt that require 77 rc?
---
&gt; Remember the results are hidden now.

something we asked for months and now people are using it as a bullet point for fuck jamflex.
---
tf is this sub
---
I'm in a similar boat here. We heavily scrutinize developer hours as OSRS players and complain when certain things take too long to develop (auth delay as a prime example). While too many developers is a bad thing, I think it's pretty clear that the team is understaffed and often devalued compared to the other parts of the company that make more of a profit.
---
Let's look at it from this perspective; the best way that seems to be believed for Jagex is to grow the player base so our 11$ ü¶Ä however almost every attempt to improve the new player experience to increase players numbers is shut down. The alternative is pushing toward these external partnership models to potentially push users of other platforms back to OSRS. They're in a no win situation and it's terrible.
---
They have since updated the poll questions to more accurately reflect that these will be coming from partnerships.
---
If it involves content with a real life price tag, yes. How do people have such a short memory.

Cosmetic exclusives were mentioned. Dude are you even paying attention?
---
In the interest of humanity, and making the world a better place, I'm glad that you found video games. Please put your mental attention on this decades old browser game. For all our sakes, I hope you never vote, or get involved with making decisions that can affect the rest of us.
---
God bless.
---
That's not how it works man.
---
So you're spending even more money in the end.
---
See I dislike the idea of partners getting stuff first because the whole community it more than the partners. I think they should release whatever it is and everyone can have it at the same time. A nice community feel if you will. They could make events out of it too I suppose. 
---
Overall I think I am opposed to it because I see this as a way to put MTX in the game (and I don't really consider buying bonds a MTX really. I'd rather get gold or game time legitimately than pay for it from a shady second hand site).
---
Jagex legit said over and over that sof was cosmetic only when it was being rolled out.
---
&gt;Don't vehemently state facts when you're entirely incorrect
---
Here, kids, we have someone who can't talk to people!

---
The charms you gather are used to get 99 summoning, which is a requirement to create that pet but you're far from gathering those charms FOR it. The cash spent is involved in training the skill too.
---
A much better comparison would've used a skilling or boss pet. They can both be used as summoning familiar overrides too, unlike the black dragon. But that would have actual prestige behind it with its rarity, unlike the drake thing. The black dragon is a pickup/drop item like a hellcat, and you can't do shit with it. It's the same tier of pet as creating a bird from bird's nest eggs. You're comparing a "legendary pet" with an ugly green dragon drop, and framing it as a grand achievement. You could've made the same point in a less disingenuous way.
---
Legendary pets have some paid benefit so there is some scumminess, even though I still never use the one I got free with premier club or the one I got included with $5 membership time.
---
Usually the people who actually post something are just going to dig in deeper, but the posts will affect people who are just reading. If someone was indifferent about the poll and logged into Reddit today, they'd probably start thinking these early-access, boring cosmetics were literally P2W MTX.
---
You sound desperate for that irl cash man try go get a job instead of threatening to rwt on reddit üòÇ
---
Simple questions require simple answers:
---
#**$$$**
---
It's quite disheartening, I've seen posts explicitly telling people how to vote, and even pictures of Jagex execs with hateful comments making fun of them, it's all getting way out of hand and people need to simmer down
---
Those weren't MTX, you weren't spending any extra money.  Promotions to try and get people to keep up them memberships or buy in bulk, but if you were an active player they weren't getting any additional money from you.
---
Eoc killed rs2 and the mtx was to keep the game afloat. Sounds like you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Its OK to use your own judgement when reading articles without having people telling you what to do
---
So where's the link?
---
So I didn't misremember being lied to. Good to know, thanks!
---
Will be there later. At work. RIOT!!!!!
---
It's almost as if in order to make money you have to make a good product. Noone would continue to play OSRS if they turned it into shit. Their playerbase would leave if they added MTX. Almost like... the market dictates what happens. The people who like MTX and are cool with it are already playing RS3.
---
So is acess to members only areas of the world MTX (with extra steps) now too? You're really going out on a limb. Microtransactions are either a thing or they're not. Including things in the subscription fee is not a microtransaction. Buying it outside of a subscription is a microtransaction. 
---
Having acess to ardounge on members quests is incentivizing keeping your membership, that's not MTX, that's part of your subscription.
---
Stop projecting
---
Ill vote yes for morytania because swamp man good but no to all else
---
If someone actually coordinates this I‚Äôm in
---
They would have to be denied access ad aeternum for it to count as exclusion. Since they aren‚Äôt, it isn‚Äôt exclusion. Sorry you‚Äôre incapable of seeing the difference between pedantics and important subtleties or speaking politely.
---
I think mobile gaming was the true offender of p2w game mechanics. Console games started seeing the massive success these little phone games were having and wanted to implement that cash flow for themselves.
---
cool.
---
I'm an apologist for calling out an objective misinformation?  So lying is okay if it furthers your personal view?
---
You could already sign the instakill. There's nothing new in that regard. Maybe you use one more, but anyone who's at the point where they're at 1k Telos has so much BXP that they have plenty of life refreshes of their own.
---
And no, your "achievement" (if you can call it that) wasn't devalued, any more than it's "devalued" if a new weapon has been released. Excuse, plain and simple.
---
??? If anything we've seen a worst history with jagex on mtx than blizzard. Also how can you say cosmetics don't matter in games where most of the items you receive are to show off to other players. I mean legitimately think about it, does an extra +2 strength on a neck/ring/cape change your gameplay drastically or do you spend 30m+ extra to flex on scrubs?
---
üê∏üê∏$11üê∏üê∏
---
Then if I decide to present my opinion in the future, I'll be clear that the content I feel we are "robbed" of is not the cosmetics themselves, but the grind and prestige of the achievement they demonstrate. I think people play this game under the premise those grinds will be offered in future updates. Would that make us agree?
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄI haven't bought the frog cosmetic yetü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I wish people would stop using the term RNG in place of Luck. 
---
You want better luck. Not better Random Number Generator.
---
You are aware that both membership and bonds are both MTX right?
---
Please don't try and force others to vote in a certain way. The polling system was hidden recently to avoid that
---
No, the points are literally a bonus. I don‚Äôt go out of my way to buy games just for points. Also get free points for searching with bing and shit.
---
its pretty obvious that when they say they have no interest in adding mtx and that everyone will get these rewards, and that all rewards and partnerships will be polled; they actually meant we are adding squeal of fortune to the game next year as an unpolled integrity change. you and i are just too dumb to see through the delusion.
---
That's a reason they won't though?
---
Do you act like this in the rest of your life?
---
I can drink a beer for the first time without having nightmares of being dead in the gutter. 
---
If a fucking orange skin keeps the game alive go ahead. I‚Äôll vote no on the poll for billboards though. Because you know, I‚Äôm not insane.
---
No? There were still a lot of people that were like "eh, let's see what happens". If 'everyone and their mother' was against it, they wouldnt have pushed through. Stop making shit up yourself.
---
D
---
I think they will, if the option is given to them. All we can do as a community is say no to even the smallest of thing than can cater the game in the direction that they can justify adding any type of micro transaction.
---
They killed the game with eoc. Adding that stuff in was to keep the company afloat. This is a much different situation. Osrs is growing. Rs2 was dying/dead
---
Exactly, which is why we are going to fight this. Take this [bow](https://imgur.com/a/O7UiOBx) and go around shooting.
---
I agree that it doesn't make sense in terms of the longevity of the game, but it absolutely makes sense from a financial standpoint (which is likely all that the investors really give a shit about). Unfortunately, Jagex continue to make an increasingly absurd amount of money from in-game microtransactions.
---
I'm currently making a rune pure as well just send me a message if you want to do some stuff together or something.
---
Membership no, bond yes.
---
It is now
---
Wasn't ready for this level of delusion
---
&gt;!h!&lt;
---
With regen+hp cape all you need is 1 Sara brew to last an entire game. Trying to fix it is just going to make it more absurdly broken and afk than it already is.
---
This was my major concern. Assuming (BIG assume) this really is as far as it goes, I would want a hard cap on the max an exclusive partner can last. I would want a guarantee that exclusive partner cosmetics must be made available to the rest of the community within a certain amount of time. Obviously it would change from partner to partner, but max time limit needs to be guaranteed for me to ever vote Yes to any of this.
---
I thought you were joking so I looked it up... It‚Äôs sadly real.
---
We may as well just go play RS3 since that‚Äôs where OSRS will be if we vote yes!
---
Do you not see how "acts as a beast of burden" "infinite high alchs" and "portable bank" might be misleading to someone who's never seen this before? Sure its not entirely a lie but its not the full truth.
---
no lol
---
3rd age is cosmetic, this is the end.
---
It's basically the exact same thing as the purple skin that came with linking your rs account with Twitch prime. You do whatever thing (I don't think they've given specifics on who they're partnering with for this), and it gives you early access to the new skin or emote or whatever, and then after a set period of time it becomes available to everyone.
---
It's kinda ironic, but if it wasn't for Ironman the grand exchange would keep me from playing Runescape. The Grand Exchange was the reason I quit originally because it meant I couldn't merchant anymore.  People can talk all day about how much better it is for the game and the economy, and they make a solid argument, but end of the day that was how I had my fun. Sitting in Faldor park and buying Abby whips for 2.8 mill and selling them for 3.2 mill. The grand exchange took that from me.
---
I came back recently and fell in love with Ironman. I honestly don't think I could have fun playing this game if everything I did revolved around the GE.
---
Lmao this comment is so funny
---
true, but I imagine that any company that is buying and selling controlling shares of a company is going to look into the history of a company before even putting in an offer.
---
Ah I've never dabbled in wow pokemon. I just have my mini diablo follow me everywhere
---
Marketing is always important no doubt about that but this is referring to you saying there's indefinite growth potential for Jagex and Runescape. Growth should always be a target but there's healthy growth and unreasonable and unattainable growth. I merely said Fortnite because Tencent is one of few fortune 500 company companies who also owns Lol/Clash Royale/PUBG and publishes several games in China.
---
Does this mean we get New Old School Runescape released in 2023 with a backup from 2017?
---
Until they decide to ignore us and do an "integrity change".
---
When you open a blog post to explain why something isn't MTX and how you're never going to implement MTX into the game just to follow it up with poll questions about selling cosmetic items in the game makes you think that those cosmetic items are in fact MTX. 
---
Usually when someone wants me to join a pyramid scheme they introduce the sales pitch by telling me how it isn't a pyramid scheme.
---
wow store mounts are actively detrimental to the game because they incentivise blizzard to blast all of the good graphics on store mounts while the earnable mounts get neglected
---
enjoy your fuckin bloatray for doing the 8.2 rep grind! now pay us 30 bucks for the nice-looking dragon
---
To clarify, I should have said "Short term $$$".
---
In the long term, yeah you're right, that shit's going to dry up fast.
---
It's your right to vote however you want. Just know that this poll affects the longevity and health of the game, as well as displays the (lessening) integrity of Jagex as a company. Voting 'yes' just to spite redditors who will likely forget about your comment in 10 minutes anyway isn't exactly a great reason.
---
thanks
---
You suspect that statistic is too high or too low?
---
The first big goal on any new account should be curses and prifindas. They are beyond rewarding and change the way you Pvm and skill on an entire account. Free 99's in afkable ways and prayers that make pvm like a joke except at like 4 monsters which take some sort of skill.
---
they can have all partners they want but locking content behind timegates is a dangerous way to go down, partner with whoever you like and give us all the cosmetics right away or dont do it at all.
---
this would be "buy xxx companys procuts for xx amount of money to get this cosmetic item for free!!! yay!"
---
and it would only get worse after that has been accepted and sooner or later osrs will be rs3 disaster 2.
---
A mod replied mentioning it wouldn‚Äôt be justified to be offered as a quest or a diary reward due to devs costs. But a partnership reward is easily justified
---
Can clue scroll steps be more consistent? meaning that with some steps you have to open a drawer and get the clue and with others you have to open and search on top of it.
---
another example would be with hard clues vs elites: hard clues give you an extra scroll when you need to answer a question whereas with elite you need to open the clue and answer there
---
id love for this to be in line :)
---
You can, just not immediately.

What about me? Lol

Think of Soul Split as the prayer Smite, except with lifesteal. Yes. Lifesteal. At its release, you healed 20% of the damage dealt (now nerfed to 10%). And just like Smite, you drain your opponent‚Äôs prayer as well. It required 92 prayer, but the Curses Prayers (as it was called) dominated the PvP and PvM scene.
---
Yeah they've made it clear that Fun is a lower priority than Profit, which stings a little bit because of how friendly and involved the OSRS staff is.
---
They care about their money, and they're not going to destroy it. Simple as that. There's a proven system and history they can see that lead to the decline the first time. When you invest 530 million dollars you don't just "look at a spreadsheet" and make a decision. 
---
That aside,
---
The company was JUST sold in June. It's no longer Chinese owned. You're delusional on top of having no idea what you're talking about.
---
That's the point of a poll. Showing the results before the poll ends could influence people's opinions. By the way, I  think the community would vote no on this as the presence of MTX in RS are one of the reasons OSRS exists in the first place.
---
See you in a week.
---
We can't be friends I'm sorry.
---
The game only has such a long life cycle, from a buisness perspective can you blame them for wanting to rake in some extra dough?
---
I'd pay two extra bucks or some as well.

Sopa de macaco
---
I can't really blame people to be honest, with the way the entire gaming industry has shifted it's pretty reasonable to believe this is just another very small baby step towards actual mtx. I think just about everyone is fine with this. Just this though.  What they're not fine with is the idea that this could just be the next step in a line of "this is as far as it goes, We promise" 's.  
---
I'm personally ok with just this step too, but it does feel like this is a conversation we've been having more frequently with updates jagex are pushing.
---
It really wasn't. Max level there was some ok dps boost from familiars and a pak yak that could bank things for you (with a cooldown/points to regen like prayer). The beasts of burden were useful, a few others had niche money making bonuses or invisible skill boosts. People who hate summoning and dungeoneering tend to be people who didnt try them or couldnt afford summoning and consider it rs3 content despite it being part of the game pre eoc.
---
$11 btw
---
They can also go the Youtube route and put double ads in
---
And do you have information on who the new owner is?
---
up
---
U think what they did wasnt intentional? Jagex has poorly worded questions to force them through a poll many times
---
see:
---
* Partyhat rares
---
* Grand exchange
---
would you happen to have the original photo of this?
---
Legendary
---
got it, thanks!
---
I hate when people post logical takes summarizing differences in our opinions too :/
---
i have 1.2 million loyalty points lmao
---
Too high, ofcourse.
---
Which would increase the price in game of bonds as demand goes up, making them more of an easy justification to spend the players money on. The bond system will always even out as long as there is a somewhat substantial player base.
---
Seems like a direct comment on the little value an MTX partnership brings the community.
---
It's cheaper after you do the puzzle you're thinking of the other rune shop.
---
After the puzzle you get presented with a bunch of cheap runes to buy
---
True, but why worry about something that will happen regardless of whether we vote against it or not if the CEO wants it? No point in starting a witch hunt
---
And the Shadow Drake shouldn't be in the game sooo
---
Makes sense ty
---
You realize that farming Telos for bonds at that enrage is *more* than minimum wage, especially if you're already doing it for fun?
---
&gt;Can you really not accept that jagex adding more mtx to make the game literally p2w is still causing players to quit?
---
Please tell me where I said that *wasn't* the case. Go ahead. I'm waiting.
---
You oughta, although finishing Architectural Alliance is a bitch!, could just get 100% at Hosidious though since you don't have to lock down each house anymore before gaining favours in the other ones.
---
And PvP. I used to get straight bullied by people with curses and chaotic weapons.
---
If people suspect that, poll result accumulation will just become a plugin on clients.
---
Mtx didn't make people quit rs2/3 eoc did
---
I swear I've seen that quote beneath the the shave ad. Something about single mothers in my area, not entirely sure but I've seen it before for sure. I dearly hope OSRS won't go down this path
---
You have to stop the q-tip when there's resistance
---
ss flicking is huge powercreep but it does have its tradeoffs of less protection and significantly raised the skill ceiling because of flicking
---
so either you do elaborate more or my mind remains unchanged
---
Ah yes, clearly spoken by somebody who does not know how game development works
---
Is it out to vote on?
---
Not all promotions have to give membership.
---
Only 44 upvotes?
---
This deserves more :(
---
Imagine being this desperate lmfaooooo
---
We pay we grey
---
Yeah that doesn't make much sense either. What does scare me, though, is that just now on the Q&amp;A stream they said they don't usually poll business decisions (obviously). However, this is a content poll! New items even if they are cosmetics.
---
I don‚Äôt particularly care for this partnership thing, strictly because I don‚Äôt see 100% transparency yet, but your post is bothering me pretty bad because of your second sentence. 
---
I have nearly 110 clients at work myself. I‚Äôm doing very good for our business. Just because I‚Äôm sitting in a good place, doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to be better. More clients means I can higher more staff members to grow my business. Just because you feel like our playerbase is fine, doesn‚Äôt mean Jagex doesn‚Äôt have goals. Goals that can‚Äôt be met until there‚Äôs more subscriptions for their game. 
---
Jagex doesn‚Äôt sell you anything but a game with a service. To increase project funding, development , and profitability, they need to increase player count. If Jagex chooses to give total and completely transparency, I don‚Äôt have an issue with partnerships. People are going around (not saying this is you) saying the only reason Jagex is doing this is to increase profits. Well duh?? They‚Äôre a business and that‚Äôs their business initiative. Y‚Äôall need to realize if Jagex isn‚Äôt making this game for free. At some point they‚Äôre going to have to increase membership even more, ESPECIALLY if deals like this don‚Äôt exist.
---
Do you want $15/month membership, or do you want a few deals that give you the ability to redecorate your house?
---
Idk, man. I don‚Äôt think the OSRS team is pulling a fast one at all. At the end of the day, we all seriously need to remember this is a video game we all elected to play and send our time on. If DemonSlaya302 can get orange skin by connecting their runescape account to his LG refrigerator, I honestly don‚Äôt care. What I do know is my ass isn‚Äôt going to spend 50 hours grinding an event or something to get that cosmetic. It just simply isn‚Äôt worth it. Unless I want some firemaking cape fashionscape.
---
Where is that quote from? It's very true.
---
Really? I have 6 IRL friends who play and all of them have purchased gold at one point or another. I would actually guess that this value is too low.
---
Are they including bonds? I'm sure it's lower now that those are available.
---
Why did you guys lie about MTX and then try and sneak it in as a partnership? Why the cloak and dagger stuff when we pay your wages?
---
i know thats why i said what i said.
---
to clarify: july 18 2018 they had the intention to enver add mtx to osrs, after that however somebody new came in to the company who was looking for increase in profits and wants to introduce mtx.
---
Sounds like everybody. Being principled doesn‚Äôt mean needing to take everything to the extreme. Jagex doesn‚Äôt need people to unsubscribe to not want to do something. Extremely mutilated PR is bad enough. Because extremely damaged PR indirectly will lose them a lot of money. People on here just think too linearly that a company can only see immediate profit and only cares about that so they only care if you unsubscribe.
---
Twitch prime is free for first year students because Amazon prime is free for first year students. Also it's incredibly simple to create trial accounts and redeem the benefits before promptly canceling.
---
I still don't get it. People have the option of complaining about being able to use real world money to buy their way to 99s like construction, BiS gear for combat and expensive cosmetics like 3rd age and yet they ignore this aggressive actual game changing form of MTX in favor of complaining about some meaningless cosmetics that are timed exclusives. 
---
You get these posts talking about how the game is going to be ruined by MTX, surprise, it happened years ago. The only argument  I've seen is "Well people will buy gold from sellers anyway" and this is true, but it still doesn't make it okay. Why not start selling maxed accounts and inferno capes on the game store as well then, seeing as people will just buy accounts anyway?
---
Thanks for the news update Jagex, I cancelled all my subscriptions! :) Enjoy trying to pick up the pieces (again, cus you guys make the same stupid mistake not one time but two times) again only to realise that this time there won't be a community to back you guys up again.  
---
You've lied in our faces from day 1 and for that I'm quitting. "No we're never implementing MTX, oh no don't be so silly" and then a few years later you guys are literally polling MTX schemes. 
---
If the CEO wants his money that bad tell him he can come suck the dollars out of the tip of my cock.    
---
Thanks for ruining ANOTHER game.
---
No, there's already a ring of dueling.
---
&gt; I dont like your opinion, therefore I act like I represent everyones opinions in condemning yours.
---
The truth is, a lot of people are sick of the hivemind from this community and are tired of being told what to think and how to vote. I don't care if you dont like my opinion, but you can stop pretending to represent every other person that has ever played the game anytime.
---
Phew, good!
---
Do you have the clue on you
---
I Googled RuneScape font and the first link was it, RuneScape UF font
---
I hope so
---
Sure they don't HAVE TO, but why would they not? Every promotion they have done on OSRS has given 1 month membership. It's just a massive incentive for the companies to partner with them because they know for a fact everybody is going to want a free month of membership, who wouldn't want that?
---
MTX wasnt the only issue. The playerbase was shot long before MTX. Summoning and shit "HD" were a big issue. I love how we are trying to install warding now. Yeah, lets take some fucking bullshit from some garbage version of a game that doesnt even exist anymore and shoehorn it into the "old school" version.
---
It's a familiar format, which makes it easy to understand the message. It's simple communications.
---
You're correct, what I said is that that would still be the case regardless of the fact if a percentage of in game bond purchases exist.
---
[Bit of light reading.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope)
---
That's been my main concern I've brought up a few times. There needs to be a hard cap on the max it can last. Every partnership will last a different amount of time, but there needs to be an absolute max that jagex can guarantee for us that a feature can remain exclusive.
---
Call me a brainlet, but why do i have a hard time seeing whats going on whenever i see a pic from rs3? it's just like a big mix of flashy colors
---
Completely agree with this, I‚Äôm all for the developers getting more money to work with for future content but all the partners involved must be clear that MTX of any kind are a no go
---
This was when they announced that they are adding bonds to the game.
---
You‚Äôll get free access to it next month
---
I have 3 accounts for osrs rn and I will unsub all of them with mtx
---
So you agree they added p2w mtx that has devalued high Telos enrage significantly?
---
That's what they say they're polling anyway, it's not like they will actually listen once money starts to run out again. Jagex lost all of my respect.
---
This really does feel like a betrayal, and like it is happening eerily close to MMK leaving. What a damn shame.
---
Currently open, I believe until monday.
---
Osrs is fucked lol.
---
And jagex is lying trough their teeth.
---
&gt; E: fuck ill make my own server and only allow myself on it, I know java why the fuck not? Im BTW anyway
---
That made me remember Moparscape, oh boi
---
Google Platinum Fortune, 2007scape automod doesn't let you post links.
---
You can also google "companies house jagex filing history" for their full 34 page revenue report.
---
You can clearly see that subscriptions are 3/4 of their revenue. It's known how mtx will destroy osrs and subscriptions. They wouldn't invest 530 million to destroy the game to make a short term 50-100 million, on top of destroying the resale value.
---
Hey! Quests and lore is my favorite part of the game..
---
What worries me the most about this Partnerships thing is that it's going to close off future content from being tied naturally into game progression. If this passes, I can easily see this happening in the future.
---
Where you would expect:
---
&gt; Song of the Elves has been released! Players who complete the quest can talk to the Architect in Prifddinas to unlock a new Elven house theme.
---
Could become this:
---
&gt; Song of the Elves has been released! To celebrate, we're offering an Elven house theme to all players with Twitch Prime. After 3 months, this theme will be available to everyone.
---
In a game that's centered entirely around progression and prestige, this doesn't feel like it fits at all. Crystal and Elven stuff has always been associated with a certain level of progress on an account. Not super high-level, but something that players work towards as they learn more about the game.
---
You could resolve this by saying:
---
&gt; Song of the Elves has been released! To celebrate, we're offering an Elven house theme to all players **who complete this quest** with Twitch Prime. After 3 months, this theme will be available to everyone **who completes this quest**.
---
But this still doesn't sit right with me. If your account is high enough level to be on the cutting edge of content on release, your reward is... to be told to go buy some product outside of the game? Why? This kind of promotional unlock just doesn't mesh with how RS is designed.
---
No matter how you implement it though, I'm certain this update would push some future content (cosmetic or otherwise) behind Partnerships. Good luck ever seeing house themes unlockable by Construction levels or quests ever again, because the precedent has been set that these are only worth development time if some Partnership cash can be squeezed out of them.
---
And tying into that point, I want to reiterate this: It was previously stated in the blog post (and since removed) that the devs often have a hard time justifying cosmetic content and that these Partnerships could help with that. If this passes the poll, I think that a majority of the community would effectively be agreeing with this statement - that these cosmetic things aren't worth developing on the **subscription money that we're paying you**, but they will be worth it if you can get the funding from elsewhere.
---
Additional money from Partnerships won't make content suddenly appear faster, but splitting up dev time (or hiring more devs) to focus on Partnership-specific content _will_ help these things get into the game. More Partnerships over time naturally means more Partnership-focused developers, and that's one of the major complaints I see about RS3: there's more content released for their alternative monetization streams (in their case, explicit microtransactions) than there are actual game updates for all paying subscribers.
---
I personally don't want to go down that path, and I hope there's enough people here that agree. If content isn't worth developing for what we're currently paying as a subscription, then _don't even offer it_. That's fine. We have plenty to do in the meantime while you work on whatever _is_ worth the dev time. OSRS might be the last popular online game that continues to offer all its content through a subscription fee alone, and I desperately want it to retain that legacy.
---
Well I would assume what they mean is that they wouldn't poll whether they do a partnership or who they do it with, but they would poll the in-game consequences of that partnership, be it cosmetics or otherwise.
---
No. See what you need to do in arguement in order for someone to possibly see your point.
---
1. State your point
---
2. Explain your point
---
3. Also acknowledge the opposite of your position and why it might or might not be valid.
---
4. Restate your point
---
I am genuinely Curious how everyone expects the game to grow without these partner deals, I'm not going to sign up for a service that has a partnership with Runescape just for some cosmetics.     
---
I started playing because of the free month of membership through Amazon Prime membership that I already pay for independently.   
---
The Goal of the partnerships is to bring in more players that are members to those Sites/groups not cause people to sign up for those outside services, Sure the Greedy people that are in a hurry for the cosmetics will, but just by being patient everyone will be able to get them.  
---
Sounds like a clear case of membership numbers drive not the introduction of MTX. but that's just my Opinion as someone who has only Played OSRS for 4 weeks and didn't even try it until I got a free month of membership thoguh Amazon.
---
I remember it being very exciting. But if I were doing it for the purpose of grinding xp it would get very tedious
---
I already cancelled. If the poll gets buried I'll sub back up until the next dumbass decision
---
Take a switch for minions.
---
Devalues keys
---
you‚Äôre not wrong
---
I think he means with the low quality meme
---
Microtransactions- pay to win
---
20 devs is like 2 million dollars cost to the business. probably even more if you account for benefits
---
U sound helpful help me
---
Sandy didn‚Äôt have ice barrage tho
---
I get what you are saying but this argument isn't important. Twitch prime was to get membership but this new form of MTX is much more direct and related to the RS3 MTX that we hate. Twitch prime didn't give OSRS players exclusive content in the way it did to RS3. Nothing should be locked behind the paywall besides membership stuff. P2W is dumb bullshit.
---
Thanks!
---
Username checks out!
---
I'm really not invested enough in this discuss lmao
---
Now im voting yes
---
like what?
---
Ironman mode my man save yourself before it's to late. Ironman in rs3 is even still good
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious the old school team doesn‚Äôt want this, and the MTX directive is coming from ownership.
---
please stop crying I'm sorry I hurt you so bad
---
You can buy membership with bonds and slight increase in bond price doesn't matter a shit for me. However I don't want this game to turn paytowin adfest. You can currently make bond money in 1 and half hour at vorkath which isn't bad for 14 days of membership
---
Even if bonds combat the botting effect on the market doesn't mean it's not MTX and harmful to game integrity.
---
And people bot to get max levels because they don't want to take the time to get their levels up, so they should sell XP lamps to combat that illegitimate experience get into the hands of the players.
---
Man, I‚Äôm really trying my hardest to not be condescending, but do you have any idea what you‚Äôre talking about? 
---
The entire point behind a business is to make money and grow. If you aren‚Äôt continuing profits and finding ways to bridge margins, then you become stagnant and you will undoubtably lose business (look at literally any retailer in the last 10 years not adapting to the convenience of Amazon. There‚Äôs hundreds of examples of businesses that adapted and didn‚Äôt die out due to free and fast shipping).
---
This goes hand-in-hand with bullet 1&amp;2. You can‚Äôt increase profits (player subscriptions) and keep the staff the same size. This is a huge issue in the video game industry. They‚Äôll end up working 60-70 hour work weeks and burn out. It will be a new cycle of new devs every month, that‚Äôs not good for a healthy business. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying you have to choose, that wasn‚Äôt directly stated. I‚Äôm saying you aren‚Äôt given Jagex literally /any/ option to grow because everyone is being so sensitive to any change.
---
Lastly, what the fuck? Have you never heard of marketing? Sponsorships is literally a form of advertisement, that‚Äôs why NEW players are the target while incentivizing old players. Marketing has never, in the form they are advertising, promised ANYTHING. It‚Äôs a targeted, educated, and thought out partnership that shows the product to people that might be interested. I would have NEVER bought my PC‚Äôs liquid cooler if ScienceStudios didn‚Äôt review, like, and then proceed to do a SPONSORED video from NZXT two years ago. 
---
Come on, man. Why does this kind of discussion have to be a witch hunt?
---
So that‚Äôs why you hate summoning? Cuz it was too ez?
---
I mean those can go together. More so with what was said in this thread you replied to. This thread was referring to if they did it even if it was rejected in the polls. Someone said people would unsub. Another guy said people would just keep playing and that people are principled until it comes to action. You said like every redditor. If they added it even after it‚Äôs polled against that definitely would lead to a player decline. Either from potential new players no longer wanting to join, or from current members unsubbing. Even if the ‚Äúdoomsayer‚Äù doesn‚Äôt unsub, they aren‚Äôt wrong to predict that membership would decline. They are still being consistently principled.
---
It is MTX.
---
If I pay you a dollar for a hat in a game that's MTX.
---
If I have to lay your friend a dollar for a hat in a game it's still MTX.
---
Pretending otherwise is ignorant.
---
They already did this with the twitch prime promo ages ago. Delayed access to cosmetic content unless you paid for a prime sub. Its the same shit - MTX with an added step.
---
No one seemed to give a fuck back then. Glad people are paying attention this time.
---
Jagex attempting to add mtx to osrs under the disguise of partnerships.
---
I have an etiquette question.
---
When training crabs as a pure, you have to eat and resupply every hour or so. One of my fav spots is by the fossil island mushroom meadow tree, so I can castle wars tele, grab food, island tele, tree, then back in about a minute.
---
Think I should hop if someone shows up while I‚Äôm resupplying? It doesn‚Äôt take that much longer that it would just to reset aggro, but I am technically leaving, so do I still void my claim on a training spot?
---
Googles increase in revenue is due to diversification, not because 20% more people are using a google product/service. If Jagex wants growth they should invest in product development I.e new game development, not canabalize their current customer base.
---
its short term profit tho, yeah might look good on paper but wait till next quarter when they need to introduce something else because profits are down.
---
Considering everyone left with EoC I highly doubt it. Also, if they wanted to play with EoC they might as well just play rs3
---
Ugly was a little harsh :c
---
Yo this is dope bro, good afk exp too! 
---
I'm kinda doing the same thing at abby demons, but more so just training there because it's nostalgic. Aiming for 32k kills to see whether I'll get a dagger drop. Kinda sad i didn't do it sooner because I'm already only 1 attack level from maxing... Oh well! 18k kills in and 35 whips so far :p
---
Gl bro, keep us posted!

---
I'd like to think less than 50% yes, but seeing how the last poll went I'm pretty scared
---
Obviously wasnt too integral if they player base increased after it was removed.
---
Let's be honest, theres nothing enjoyable or immersive about standing in fally park for 2 hours just spamming over and over trying to sell a clue reward or buy something niche. It was a ball ache.
---
Yo what herb lvl to make gfuel?
---
In our CC they usually stick around, and a few just start over. Sucks when they quit outright, I hate losing good peeps over something so silly.
---
good don't come back
---
Yet again correlation is not caustiion. 
---
Jagex can't do anything to please people like you. 
---
You whine about how they aren't hiding the poll results. Jagex does exactly what you want. Then you decide to whine about how the results are hidden.
---
Make up your mind about what you want to whine and bitch about it. Because it can't be both.
---
You conveniently left out the VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH of that wiki article.
---
&gt;Microtransactions (sometimes abbreviated as MTX) are a business model where users can purchase virtual goods with micropayments. Microtransactions are often used in free-to-play games to provide a revenue source for the developers. While microtransactions are a staple of the mobile app market, they are also seen on PC software such as Valve Corporation's Steam digital distribution platform, as well as console gaming.
---
You're cherry picking information that suits your argument.
---
Holy shit rofl
---
Do that and I‚Äôll sell and drop everything I have
---
Yeh unless there's people who pay attention to detail u could prob fool a few people lol
---
Is Jagex losing money and therefore needing to save the company via sponsorships?
---
Will Jagex reimburse prepaid membership?
---
I do appreciate you gilding this post, thank you.
---
Im not saying I like the promotions, but this is exactly what the suggested cosmetic rewards are meant to combat. Instead of offering membership they offer a poh skin so they are enticing people without making bot farms even more accessible.
---
Same, i had already quit. It had been since the day eoc came out till the day osrs came out that i had stopped playing and ill do it again, or find a privet server if it ever comes to that
---
I had a hard time submitting my votes. Still managed to do my part.

How so?

Riot? Is it happening?

Oh the poll's live now, nice. It's just a bunch of useless changes to the POH style, home tele animations, emotes, further random skin colours. Doesn't fit osrs, voted no to everything.
---
You could grind easy/ medium cluescrolls and hope to get lucky ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It was a poor example, I should‚Äôve spent more time finding something a bit more concrete. Like I said above, I do agree with it being a little too ambiguous, as you mentioned. The only thing anyone can ask for is transparency, and unfortunately we only got a small taste of that as CONSUMERS. 
---
However, the company that owns Jagex is a public company. And I‚Äôm willing to bet there‚Äôs some sort of data reflecting the idea of partnerships and how it will please investors. That kind of information is the sort of stuff I would like to see, but I‚Äôm not an investor. So finding that information would be hard. It‚Äôs a bit over the top for a company to just make a blog post about that kind of information, ya know?
---
You‚Äôve earned my respect
---
I could still see upper management still pushing mtx w/o player approval and dev approval.
---
Imagine naming yourself gauc boi lmfaooooo
---
The way capitalism works is that it demands that companies destroy any long term benefits over short term cash grabs. Once you see things in that lens corporations will make much more sense.

There‚Äôs like 15-20 people there and I‚Äôm at work wish I could join the rioting

Maybe that post you made about fly infestations has to do with all the shit you come up with
---
true
---
Is Jagex going to take the route of MTX for OSRS now that Mod Mat K is gone?
---
The worst part about it is how huge it is, it blocks sight so much
---
I agree with this entirely. I miss trade limit. It stopped so many scams and RWT dead in the water.

Less is more ;)

ezscape enthusiasts are the worst.

Greed is a violent thing. The moment the know they can get more money out of the players they will do it

---
the problem with giving membership as a reward is that it is very easy to spoof twitch prime trial accounts, so free membership give aways create a ton of bots, which is not ideal.
---
It first start off with cosmetics and then goes on to reward players with in-game items, that will in turn ruin the whole economy.
---
Everyone hates the drakes for how big they are, when they came out it was a shitstorm

"we are paid full time to develop this game... except this one thing which we absolutely just need to add microtransactions after promising not to or there is a magical barrier stopping us"

MicroTransACS
---
Humanity and greed, two unavoidable and inevitable duos that you'll notice around in society
---
it is!
---
Haven't played since launch. What's new?
---
Just because something is an industry standard doesn‚Äôt mean it should be followed or is in any way healthy for said industry.
---
Or maybe it increased because of the addition of F2P and had nothing to do with that? Lets actually be honest and look at what updates happened at the time and attribute the growth to the ones that would actually grow the player base. Like having a F2P option?
---
The poll is open as of a few hours ago
---
Still debating at the moment
---
personally I never understood being petty about "claiming" spots
---
Neither one of you is ever going to see each other again, just hop for 5 minutes and call it a day
---
MTX is passing with majority outcome.
---
I love how this player base sees cosmetic mtx as a problem but see no issue with membership bonds.
---
IMHO jagex isn‚Äôt doing this to ‚Äúforce mtx on us‚Äù they‚Äôre doing it because every other game is starting to do it and it has proven to be very successful for those companies
---
I appreciate you making the post, we gotta stand up for what we love.
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä vote no to mtx ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Meh the toxicity will eventually burn itself out, we will all eventually get used to it and it won‚Äôt become relevant
---
Tyvm! Time to vote
---
You‚Äôre right, but the same thing happened to RS3. First off it only was cosmetics, and after a while they added MTX that was P2W. That‚Äôs also what people are scared of.
---
Lmao that's pathetic
---
it trivialised every piece of content the game had to offer in much the same way people abuse the current osrs system by using alts to spec transfer/bank/loot, just without jagex double dipping on membership
---
And removal of free trade before that. And dung didn't help by putting all the BiS weapons in a mini game where you risked and used nothing that had exponential growth in the currency earned. Thus flooding the game with the previous BiS both with people selling their outdated gear and then using the new gear to farm more of said outdated gear to make money.
---
No, that's a dumb take on capitalism. Since the long-term losses and destruction of loyalty isn't included in the calculation for the individuals responsible for this corporations decision.
---
There's enough benefit to two types of players (brokebois who can't sub but make good gp, and momma's bois who have a cc but has to go to soccer practice instead of grinding) for Jagex to cash in on it.
---
 
---
[I don't particularly respect bondbois](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/agt39k/steamed_bonds/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), and I don't use bonds myself, but at least that was implemented in a way that was SOMEWHAT fair to people who don't want to pay arcade rates for an MMO. This update would literally be "pay or wait, no matter how good of a player you are"
---
the fact that you think everyone running against orange man wants to abolish 2A and open our borders shows me you haven't even cared to look into the platforms those candidates are running on.
---
I love many of the ideas for new content presented in the poll. I think it should be earned through in-game means and be an achievement to obtain.
---
Whatever you say lmao.
---
Clean the flies out of your wheelchair
---
Yeah but she has entangle
---
Boycott the game but also in game riot.
---
But didn‚Äôt you have to spend money to obtain a twitch prime in some way? Genuine question as I‚Äôve never used amazon or twitch
---
This isn't even jagex's doing, it's runelite.
---
listen man, the most anything has been polled, from my knowledge, is the divine at 3 times. there is literally no reason to believe its gonna be polled over and over other than tin foil hats. skepticism is one thing, conspiricies is another.
---
in other words, calm the fuck down please
---
However, they boast incredibly 50%+ profit margins.
---
I"ll be voting mass voting yes just so I can ruin the game like how some of you elitists ruin it for me throughout these past months. The so called large playerbase are nothing but trial or prime bots and maxed out accounts sustaining bonds through their in game wealth without actual physical monetary contributions. 
---
Meanwhile, new players are severely disadvantaged by getting griefed all day from just grinding a simple slayer task just because some of you fear that your pk or wealth status is being threaten. Can't wait till Jagex goes belly up and your playerbase becomes so toxic that everyone shares the same sentiment and the remaining non-constructive players fight among themselves till the very end realizing how they single-handedly destroy the game and get buried with their massive hoards of GP that no players will buy.
---
Advanced RWT bots/players are already slowly taking over behind  the scenes by gaining advantage of what you veterans have done in the past. It's only a matter of time until the playerbase shrink so much that no actual interactions takes place. Discord? Forums you say? Sure... Most, if not all are there just to harvest your account details, promote rants, voicing dissactifaction or provide feedbacks only to get turned down by the vocal ones who only care for themselves and probably spent minimal or no amount of real money in contribution. Eventually causing Jagex to wrongfully accept biased and untrue feedbacks. The only actual active players I had come across in these 1000s world are either RNG bots, gold farmer clans, trial account farmers or people who are unfamiliar with the actual situation right now. 
---
Jagex posted such a high profit due to Twitch Prime and mobile trials, when these accounts are all retired after the trial, I'm gonna take a large guess that the attrition rate is so bad that Jagex will eventually push through MTX. So you elitist can enjoy the game yourselves, with no one to PK and no buyers to sell your hoarded wealth to. Every single Gooogle search related to OSRS yields at least one or more RWT sites. MTX is already there whether you like it or not, I could've get a maxed out 126 account for 1000 bucks which is probably created by the same elitist who complained of MTX.
---
I can already level my account by indirectly buying my skills from bonds, how is this not already a MTX? 
---
I can't foresee the playerbase growing into a healthy MMORPG like it's supposed to be. The idea of rejecting MTX is so that some wealthy players can remain competitive without spending a single cent and do as they like thrashing the server as they please. While new or returning players absolutely cannot progress now because RWTs and elitist are making an effort to drive their advantages up, whether through griefing or some methods of unfair gameplay. In the end, you have these fire cape or max cape services, questing services ect. I mean this is so rampant among players that when questioned, some just straight up say "oh i was at work when the cape/gold/gear arrived".
---
Customer support is near non-existant except for a myriad of Twitter accounts with "tweets are of my own opinions and do not represent Jagex in any way".  
---
Look at all the newly created content, nothing but pkers or bots running around staking out the optimal spots, meanwhile popular meeting points continue to shrink and dwindle.
---
This is SFW though?
---
Show his username, I want to be his friend
---
These questions are absolutely fucking disgusting, and remind me of what happened with rs2/3. Fuck off, everything suggested should be implemented in the game, but through legitimate ways, such as leveling or quest rewards. 
---
You should be ashamed of yourselves for even suggesting this Jagex. The literal reason you even have a fan base, and now you're doing exactly part of what caused so many of us to leave the game in the first place. 
---
Disgusting.
---
I enjoy it so much I want it in oldschool, it's just the rest of rs3 is so bad that I prefer osrs to the whole of rs3 now.
---
That's not stockholm syndrome
---
You should have just hit every mob once. No xp or drops for irondouche.
---
I would love that haha but how the hell would it be organised? You're also talking about 3 million paying customers buying a 530 million pound company. That's an average of over $175 per customer.
---
This is super important. If we give them an inch. they will take a mile later on, and OSRS will look like RS3. No thank you, I'll be at the polls.
---
2035, DeviousMUD is re-released.
---
I don‚Äôt really get the complaint though, if we can buy waifu cosmetics in game and it affects nobody else but ourselves and our wallets why not allow it?
---
Fucking lol
---
I was referring to this post on the subreddit:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c0xuqu/2018_financials_are_in_subscription_revenue_has/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Basically, that's nearly 3 times the revenue from just subscriptions, and if most people play osrs, wouldn't it be in their best interest to cater to the subscription model and bring more people into the game? Players don't want MTX, it's so hard to get a good game these days without them we just want an escape.
---
Every post was about hiding poll result.
---
Example 9700 upvotes https://v.redd.it/08zbfvft8q321
---
Has the line "No hidden poll result"
---
I came here to say this.
---
Yes, but they are going to look at working capital in depth and wonder why the surge is cash and liquidity. These would likely be factored into any EBITDA calculations as net asset value wouldn‚Äôt be the purchase price factor.
---
They claimed that those twitch promotions where a big success so I‚Äôm assuming they got people to stick around and buy membership afterwards. Botters can already get a week of members relatively easily and that‚Äôs pretty much how long they last before being banned.
---
4 minutes. I have a few other tricks up my sleeve that help
---
The difference is that they said all cosmetics Will be polled. Assuming this to be true, the playerbase has control on what content will be allowed to enter the game. The "slippery slope" everyone talks about is barred by the community.
---
Now if they add things without polling, then we cite this past poll and riot
---
Make a pure, you could have one ready to start pking in a few days
---
Bonds are to combat bots/RWT. Which is does by giving people an avenue to buy money without resorting to the teams of RWTers which only makes the game suffer by supporting their lifestyle, and you end up getting free membership if you're self-sufficient. While also being beneficial for the company.
---
I‚Äôll take whichever one he doesn‚Äôt want
---
Lmao ok I get the origin of the crab finally but where did the frog come from?
---
Thank you.
---
Source? Most everyone, myself included seemed to keep playing, continueing to PVM, quest, and skill up until around EoC when the game actually died.
---
oh wow the mtx income is huge lol
---
Easy if they pull this bs just leave the game and go play wow classic
---
What's the protest for?
---
i can relate to that
---
58-64% average is my guess
---
It isn't just bots though, so many players were abusing this last time and buying twitch prime accounts to use for membership, not just botters. It's a serious issue that needs to be addressed before they start shoving promotions down our throats
---
That doesnt mean legalizing it makes it right
---
Not enough walk animations and particle effects
---
SAY NO TO MTX WE PAY WE SAY
---
No MTX!
---
Subscriptions are not the money maker in RS3, so your claim that "osrs pulls in more money with subscribers per month than rs3 makes period" is more than likely wrong. That was my confusion with your statement. The likely reason that rs3 has a bigger dev team, ignoring the fact that the team has existed for a long time and bringing in more people quickly causes serious efficiency drops within a company, is that mtx makes a shit load of money.
---
Its them saying ‚Äúhey, we can do these things more easily if you let us partner with people‚Äù
---
Its not really manipulative
---
Edit: i still vote no though
---
Y‚Äôall gatekeeping fun
---
75 is plenty imo, again it's really all about rotations so damage will only speed up kills
---
Amateurs, not wearing crab helmets/claws.
---
I dig the updates. House appearance and skin color are hardly damaging to the game.
---
Slippery slope. The shareholders will be making more profit, not average Jagex employee. If anything, they'll hire more MTX developers to introduce 'better' cosmetics for more money. You won't see an increase in quality updates once you go down that path. 
---
Think about it, why would shareholders care about our player experience? They are in it for the money. This is a test of the player base. They want to know if we're stupid enough to allow MTX. They'll keep trying until they find an easier way to make more money.
---
Did you take a look at their debt in the recent years as well EBIDTA and costs to service the debts? Revenue is not the same as profits.
---
Businesses in a capitalistic system don't say: "Ok guys, we have made enough money for the quarter, lets just relax and take it easy while our competitors continue to push out updates to their products." 
---
Especially since Jagex is owned by a foreign investment holdings firm in Shanghai Hongtou Network Technology
---
fingers crossed
---
REEEEEE
---
Unfortunately this is what happens when shareholders get involved. Most of the time they know nothing about the game and don‚Äôt give a shit about it. They don‚Äôt care about longevity because they‚Äôll make a quick buck on this game before it‚Äôs done for good then move on to the next thing they can monetize into the ground. Going public is the biggest mistake a creative company can make.
---
make me
---
Because people are afraid it's just a gate way
---
Who cares
---
Let's not flood the game with free cosmetics. Let's have them be earned through player's accomplishments and be a fun part of the game that players can strive to earn. Any step, no matter how small, toward the way RS3 looks feels like a step in the wrong direction.
---
I have no interest in voting to appease shareholders to muddy the feel of an excellent game.
---
&gt;I started a year ago
---
&gt;trigger people who jump to conclusions that i didnt play RS2
---
Are you stupid?
---
Those ferocious gloves?
---
2005? Tough break kid if you played with us 2002 veterans you would know that the last few years before OSRS was re-released the private server community was huge. Between the top servers you probably have nearly as many players online as RS3 right now.
---
i'm down
---
Lol
---
I was listening to a song on the radio and the crab was dancing perfectly in beat, good shit
---
Seems like an MMO created around the concept of non-carbon based life forms ‚Äúartists rendition‚Äù. 
---
GG maxed main left behind when EOC hit ;(
---
tRuStAbLe lmao. Trustworthy. Bro
---
People don't always vote in their own interest. RuneScape died in part because of cosmetics and MTX. RS3 is a shell of its former self and less than 1/4 the OSRS population. The same thing will happen again if this continues.
---
You don‚Äôt understand; when that time period is over they may remove some stuff and call it limited edition the next time it rolls around just for you to pay more. We don‚Äôt want any sort of paying real money for anything except for membership &amp; bonds. Keep it at that. Nothing less, nothing more.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ädoing my part by jumping on the karma trainü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä

yes everything you just said is totally right and you are super correct. you should really go outside and think to yourself if acting like a hormonal child is really making you happy, if you currently are happy you should consider suicide as therapy for your current illness.

I agree with the point he is making but the comparison is unfair. Biggest issue is that the dragon on the right is literally over 10 years old content while the one on the left is way more recent.
---
This will buff wildy to the sky so no.
---
Afraid of dying? Don‚Äôt cross the ledge.
---
Yeah probably classic wow. Time to throw my account up on playerauctions and RWT my gold.
---
I forgot to correct myself once I got to the end:(
---
I feel like some people just don‚Äôt want to understand what we‚Äôre afraid of...
---
We DON‚ÄôT want develop time being wasted on MTX. The flying drake shit could have been an update to the actual dragon pet making the 99 summoning pet worth getting, even if it was released in 2008. It is a solid comparison.
---
Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to dig this up again but here we go...been 7 years since it was copypasta:
---
&gt; " We don't want players to be able to buy their way to success in RuneScape. If we let players start doing this, it devalues RuneScape for others. We feel your status in real-life shouldn't affect your ability to be successful in RuneScape.‚Äù
---
And this poll wasn't planned out when they decided to hide poll results? Something smells fishy here. ü¶Ä
---
I‚Äôd also except them to not release some stuff just to call it limited edition and raise the price the next time it comes around.
---
Someone donate me a bond so I can vote no pl0x
---
I'm not a member anymore because the game has obviously been going in the wrong direction since late 2018. So no, I won't vote.
---
Al Kharid gate also now costs 2 ads. Ggwp jagex.
---
Doubt it
---
It's not a matter of IF....     
---
Just When.
---
I'm pretty sure the only way Jagex will clean this if they get a partnership with Hoover¬Æ vacuums
---
They should though becaus young people dont know what the fuck theyre talking about. Social issues maybe, but economics? Lmao no thanks
---
That's the thing though man. We can't see the polling results anymore. So I wouldn't doubt Jagex to make some fake poll results just to make some money with MTX.
---
Bots and gold sellers have evolved, they'll just do powerlevelling services or "gold levelling" services if they can't trade. While it might hurt them they'll still be prevalent, pkers on the other hand would be nonexistent.
---
lemme fix that for you.
---
&gt; I started a year ago
---
&gt; trigger people who jump to conclusions
---
But the point is that this doesn‚Äôt directly make money for Jagex through a micro-transaction. They probably get a small cut from Twitch or other partners, but the real source of money in this is attracting new players to the game who will subscribe. New players aren‚Äôt going to subscribe because of flashy cosmetic items. They‚Äôll be attracted by the cosmetic items and promotions and stay because of the game‚Äôs core content.  They have every incentive to use the extra revenue from new players to make the game even better. I‚Äôd agree with you if this was true MTX, but it‚Äôs basically just advertisement for Jagex.
---
Ok bye. No1 cares.
---
This comment right here officer
---
LEAVE JUCHE ALONE
---
Sounds like I've never played what, ff14? It's all over my post history, I'm a lala with GOTH, a large in shiro for my FC and a personal med in beds, I main WHM and SMN, I have PLD at 70 just for fill but I still haven't unlocked all abilities because I dislike questing. I made over 200m in the months before ShB flipping houses and crafting raid pots and he rakshasa gear, my specialist classes were BSM, ALC, and GSM so I was quite limited to only weapons and right side.
---
They were literally never purchaseable via runecoins in fact a huge issue that the RS3 community has had for years was the fact that man auras (which are almost mandatory for end-game content) are locked behind the loyalty system.
---
That‚Äôs a fair point, thank you. I hadn‚Äôt really proofread and didn‚Äôt see that as you‚Äôve stated, but that does make sense.
---
The problem is every god damn developer says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just cosmetics‚Äù and three months down the line we have get the new Godsword when you spend 35$ at insert partnership name here
---
If these are MTX, then that would be too; they're exactly the same. Just because one company makes a game vs another that lets people stream them doesn't change the inherent nature of the relationship.
---
Though in this case, I get the strong feeling that you don't have Twitch/Amazon Prime, but do play Path of Exile.
---
Shut up you dork jesus christ
---
Get membership if you want. Don't base your decision off the latest thing Reddit is screeching about.
---
They probably think the game is doing bad now because we don‚Äôt have as much players as we had on mobile release lul.
---
What is this mtx I keep hearing about
---
ah yes the classic "no u" tell me why people should listen to people like you when you don't give any reasons to what you say and you act like a child who's ran out of insults. you're even downvoting me when we are all the way down here lol.
---
It's cute that you think that Classic WoW won't have MTX and gold selling (tokens) soon.
---
this comment is much dumber than either group of people you're talking about
---
Sarcasm no?
---
Make them pay you for it and then just recover it
---
Well the only thing I can accept is OSRS themed nikes irl
---
Honestly people need to realize things change and Jagex has actual data while we ALWAYS speculate hardcore. If they fuck up hard we roast them until they don't. Ez.
---
All mtx are bullshit. Anything you see in game should only be able to be obtainable in game. No other way. If this comes in jagex is going to lose an astronomical amount of loyal members.
---
We really don't care if we lose a manchild that quits over petty stuff.
---
Or, hear me out, let's speak out so this dev team _doesn't_ make the same mistake that they did on RuneScape
---
Yes it is. 
---
https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1146464491946815488?s=19
---
You should. Jagex does. With people cancelling memberships eventually the losses from unsubscription will outweigh the profit of MTX.
---
You're basically suggesting "premium" membership.
---
Osrs is the largest f2p mmo, you can pay to access members content. 
---
How does adding another pay wall make sense, but also the logistics. It would mean there would be separate servers that had pre release content.
---
Dude are you fucking dumb, acknowledging that ain't gonna get him no karma. smh.
---
Nope even if they were completely trustworthy these promotions alone are a problem. This is the bait, you want these cosmetics but instead of earning them in game they use them to get more money.
---
Pretty sure we‚Äôve butted heads on here in the past, but I totally agree here, this is how you do a healthy partnership
---
this is getting spicy
---
Sorry that I came off as unnecessarily harsh. It's just that reposts while something is already on the front page is irritating. The fact that the image is different though shows that you didn't maliciously post it as a repost. Again, sorry.
---
Oh, didnt know dragon implings drop glorys. Thanks!
---
No its all serious
---
Abusing? I don‚Äôt get how using the service exactly how it was intended is abusing. And like I mentioned it‚Äôs already being abused a different way for botters
---
Nah some WoW kid would be offended and Nike would pull them.
---
Might be true, but you are looking short term. This is what also happened to rs3. They promised no mtx, started off slowly like this, but in the end the game got ruined with a lot of p2w mtx. The rewards sound nice now, but this is the start of a wrong direction in my opinion.
---
Lol  the occasional 2 year old maturity man child quitting isn‚Äôt gonna hurt.
---
To be fair, every single question does say: as explained in the blog. I agree they should be more upfront because people are too lazy to go and read the website but at the end of the day it is down to laziness
---
True, but I very much doubt it will stay cosmetic like this.
---
There are people legit addicted to OSRS for various reasons (dopamine, staking/gambling, RWT income, sunk-cost fallacy), and I'd imagine most of the player base falls into one of those categories; they aren't going any where since no other game offers anything like OSRS.
---
right? voting no to swampletic house is unforgiveable
---
How is it not abusing? They're abusing an exploit in twitches prime service to get it for free which translates into unlimited free runescape membership, that is quite literally the definition of abusing a system.
---
Jagex wants to add in time exclusive cosmetics that will be sponsored by companies that want to partner with old school. Like how twitch did with the purple skin. Go look at the newest poll and blog info. They are about to lose the entire player base
---
My fucking sides lmfao
---
if you think for one second that the majority of the player base cares what this subreddit thinks, then you are about to be sorely disappointed
---
This will become more and more common the more the OG mod's start to leave the company. Matt K should have stayed.
---
why should i properly engage with you when you open with the trite "reddit virgin" line and didn't bring a single point to the table? go play in traffic you shameless oxygen thief.
---
I recently accidentally dropped most of my graceful set in an instance and accidentally left (don't ask how)

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to judge this update based on what you think they may do in the future, though.
---
Every update there‚Äôs a rally riot, ok
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Voted no, fuck this cosmetic dog shit, I have PTSD over shit like this, while I like the old school team shit like this proves we are a few steps away from being fucked by jagex again, they‚Äôll want a revamped combat system soon, people never learn.
---
F2p can't vote and I know i never bothered with it for the first 6 months or so
---
13 spins why
---
Sounds like greed to me. Wanting to make money is fine; it's when it comes at the expense of others (in this case, us the players) that I have a problem with it.
---
People saying they'll quit over some timed exclusives meanwhile the game has had pay to win bonds for years, yeah okay that makes sense.
---
cosmetics certainly were a nail in rs3's "coffin" and the squeel of fortune was MTX so both of those things have contributed to the (poor) state of the game right now.
---
Not only that, but playercounts have been building year on year since 2014, record each year, record profit each year. Then they say oh we need to get money somehow(never mind that subscription price hike, the fact we pay our employees below industry average so they all leave and hire next to no support staff) and people actually defend them and say uhh well it‚Äôs a business gotta make those dollars you know.
---
It‚Äôs more gaming industry, infinite expansion shareholder poison, this industry is genuinely killing itself to please shareholders.
---
What is going on?
---
BTW
---
Med level build maybe ? Then make a pure as well.
---
I will turn away and never look back
---
Man hook me up with premium "premium membership" so i'll do new raids faster than this guy. If he buys that then i want the 3x premium package
---
Surely they make more money if they get less per player but have a load more players for a much longer time?
---
MTX is video game cancer and all they're doing is guaranteeing they won't have players to squeeze from further down the line.
---
ah shit i missed it
---
Double xp weekends 4 times a year, stock up on supplies
---
You can drop it over
---
Downvote me all you want but i‚Äôd gladly pay money if it meant that i‚Äôd skip over grinding cancer skills.
---
Try making an alt account and start agility or mining and tell me you don‚Äôt want to neck
---
What promise? Did you not read the terms when you signed up? "All accounts belongs to the property of Jagex".
---
Yeah, actually.
---
You clearly weren't around for the collapse of rs3 lol. The majority of loyal veteran players left the game.
---
Yes it does. Even one person protesting is a riot...
---
Too long; didnt read
---
Did take the time to downvote though. Just for you üòò
---
You can only claim the promotion once per account....
---
But that only applies to old streamers. Why would any new streamers join a microtransactions riddled game. Plus most the old playerbase won't be there to generate the unique content which captures anyone's attention. It essentially abolishes the conditions which would keep generating the sort of streamers OSRS benefits from having, and thus the interest, and eventually that hits your bottom line. Not that many companies are great at recognizing short vs long term effects
---
Can't remember...do I need a membership to vote on this?
---
That's the point I'm making. Very rarely do they have to include the upper echelon in blog posts, and we can either trust them at their word or base our opinions on what they've done and said to their shareholders. 
---
I linked above a full hour long vid discussing player retention mechanisms and managing change. Go watch it, the majority of it is pretty tame and actually super informative, but when they get to mtx it's really enlightening. 
---
Their TL;DR is essentially "players will bitch, but it doesn't mean shit". 
---
I'd like to believe that they've changed their minds, but someone who's changed their mind on the subject wouldn't likely be pushing partnership cosmetics.
---
I've never done NMZ and need to imbue my slayer helm but I'm also gunning for untrimmed slayer cape. Is it possible to min/max my points/hp xp in the minigame without the use of "expensive" gear like Toxic staff of the dead/ Serpentine helm? Will the total hp xp I get be relatively insignificant If done normally?
---
Pros: post looks like the wiki 
---
Cons: no black text yellow background
---
Horseshet, the island are known for ponies.
---
To be honest I'd love a lot of the things in the polls, like the house styles.
---
I don't want the earned through partnerships. I don't want cosmetics being the bargaining chip for anything financial.
---
typical reddit overreaction. enjoy the ride m8
---
why?
---
More money &gt; less money, seems pretty easy to understand.
---
That said i don't agree with it and have already voted no.
---
your outrage over people having a different opinion you is pretty is pretty worrying. You might want to talk  to a professional is simple disagreements upset you like this.
---
Pre gwd 2013 is boring as fuck. Thats what osrs was in 2013. Endgame gear was full dharoks with rune boots a whip and a dfs. Highest pvm was barrows basically. Yeah that gets boring real quick.
---
I agree I was all for the first question until I got halfway through and felt thoroughly tricked
---
Nobody cares.
---
Read the most recent blog here:  [https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=843/partnerships-and-old-school?oldschool=1](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=843/partnerships-and-old-school?oldschool=1) 
---
Look at the in-game poll as well.
---
Next blog post by Jagex: "The silent majority feels positive about MTX."
---
This is actually a super good idea. You could even put statues of tye winnders like what we had for clan wars with the sponsoring company named, so they would essentially get a permanent ad in game.
---
Lmao this is great
---
If it is, is realllly deserves a /s.
---
Go eat sugar
---
I would rather pay more in monthly membership than MTX. But in return, I expect they increase the quality of the game at the discretion of the core player base. 
---
As soon as you desecrate the game with MTX, you get a major clash (which we're already beginning to see with bonds) between the *real* oldschool players (mostly adults; loyal) and the newbies (mostly kids; transient).
---
In what why is raids 3 purely cosmetical..
---
Pathetic.
---
The way I see it, as long as you can get past the snake, you should be golden. Unless you want to bank the logs which isn't the best use of time. Beyond that, only trees I'd recommend cutting are yews in the woodcutting guild. Maybe magics if you want to make a bit of money, those are painfully slow but really afk.
---
You make very good points and perhaps you're right on some levels. I hope jagex decides to do the right thing because you're right I dont trust them to make the correct decisions when it comes to how they monetize or grow.
---
Yes.
---
This. MTX cosmetics are never ok in any game if they fuck over the Art Direction.
---
Hell yeah brother
---
I'd be out. NTY
---
They're changing it to 12.99$ Did you not see?
---
We don't hate RS3 players, we just hate the game that RS3 has become.
---
2007 was trade limits and stuff
---
Triggered
---
you didn't quit at bonds
---
you didn't quit at twitch prime promo (Which was essentially the same as the current drama you're complaining about)
---
strap in kiddo, you're here for life.
---
You can already buy your way to max with bonds if you truly wanted to.  They are 10x worse than *polled* cosmetics that will be given to the community for free when the promotion ends.  To then claim that will lead to QOL purchases is disingenuous and a really slippery slope.
---
Can you recommend a good private server for after MTX comes out? There'll be a flood of players looking to play a game reminiscent of RuneScape IN 2007. (Not OSRS)
---
Vote no
---
Where does it say that jagex is adding mtx to osrs?
---
This article cleared up a lot of things for me.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/2tpuzd/runescape_as_a_whole_is_being_destroyed_and/
---
The dark days are upon us
---
It won't get this bad if you just vote no to the stuff that looks dumb
---
im just a memer
---
Bingo. There's honestly not much of an attraction to outside parties to become a new OSRS player.
---
I have a great idea, let's make an OldSchool OldSchool RuneScape! Let's go back to 2018!
---
Redeemed a bond just to vote tbh
---
You didn't quit when bonds were introduced
---
You didn't quit when the twitch prime promo was released (Which is the exact same thing as this whole "Partnership" deal)
---
I'd say Jagex can be pretty confident in thinking you'll stick around no matter what, because you probably will.
---
Bonds don't add gold into the game and people who are going to buy bonds will buy them through RWTing anyways.
---
So what's your conclusion? Do people just mature with time to overcome their flaws? Become better with new opportunities?
---
This is what everyone is upset about:
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/partnerships-and-old-school?oldschool=1
---
And I'm here to consume them.
---
Did you record this with a blender?
---
This argument doesn‚Äôt make any sense. If you read Jagex‚Äôs post, they aren‚Äôt making most of their money from the cosmetics themselves. Think about it. This is basically an ad for Jagex on Twitch or other partner‚Äôs platforms. They will probably get a small cut from the total number of people who use it, but the real money is in attracting new players and getting them to subscribe. New players aren‚Äôt going to subscribe because there‚Äôs flashy cosmetics they can put on their characters. They‚Äôre going to be attracted first by the cool cosmetics that they see on Twitch and subscribe for the game‚Äôs core content. They have every incentive to use this extra revenue to improve the core game experience.
---
I‚Äôm on the same boat as you, i feel like nobody actually read the post. The analogy I‚Äôve come to is it‚Äôs like say you have a kid who spilled a glass of milk, you wouldn‚Äôt yell at the kid for getting another glass of milk right? Partnerships are what keep your ü¶Ä$11 ü¶Ä at that price.
---
Just voted from my toilet
---
I haven't lagged in any measurable amount for literally months, and barely anyone in my CC has either. I suggest you find better worlds to play on, as the ones you are playing on are likely bad
---
Extra effective on drywall.
---
Usually it‚Äôs once the poll closes I think
---
I‚Äôve played since 2004 and I disagree. Removal of free trade was an inconvenience, but it didn‚Äôt ruin the game. I comped around a year before EOC and it was the release of EOC that fundamentally changed the game from what I grew up with to a cheap wow clone. I quit and never went back after that. I happily kept playing when free trade was removed.
---
Didn't read but you replied the same minute I posted? Lol basement dweller.
---
The problem is that anyone playing the game, that isn't playing f2p, already pay a $11 subscription. If a larger budget and more devs aren't being added on because of these promotions then we would get this content or something similar anyway. It's double charging.
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Cell phone just a quick throw up not trying to be swampboi lol
---
Well of course he was trying to find ways to monetize osrs. It was his job. Now that it's not his job, he doesn't have to agree with it.
---
I'm sure we all have done things we've don't agree with.
---
thank you
---
&gt;	doesn‚Äôt harm the games integrity
---
Tell that to the bot farms only possible during twitch prime month
---
[deleted]
---
Hyahyahyahyahya wOw!
---
Yeah, ramblings of a neckbeard on reddit aside -- what were the focus groups like?
---
[Ornate Armor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ornate_armour)
---
Honestly I'd never seen this before and thought it was photoshopped in from world of Warcraft
---
Well put. I thinks it's even worse they are willing to "partnership" with a bunch of companies, just one like twitch isnt to bad but they liked that twitch traffic from the prime so im sure they would like to do that with as many companies they possibly can, the problem is that you then have a game where more then half of the game is locked behind a subscription and then a small percent is locked even behind that. Im sure they think "Will be available at a later date to everyone" will stop anyone from caring. I dont care if i get it now or later cause I dont want it at all. Gtfo with your cosmetics and focus on the game at hand you shills. Osrs Esports is in shambles so lets spend time and money working on partnerships that add stupid ass cosmetic tropes, nice move.
---
Ty
---
Fuck off, mtx are fine
---
Bruh ur talking like Traiborn
---
I mean you all joke but least they're polling the option to get FREE skin colours. In Rs3 you have to pay for weird skin colours with runecoins and even then it's not a perm unlock of that colour if you decide to switch it again.
---
Oh, I'm an idiot and completely misread lmao  
---
Fossil island is kind of a no go, unless you can trap the snake behind one of the trees or something. Still backing the woodcutting guild though. Only around 40k xp/hr but is pretty chill
---
bruh ü§£üçÜüí¶üí¶üëè
---
Thanks will try that out too
---
Bots are a problem regardless but yes valid point.
---
If it goes as well as the actual boycott did, in 3 months everyone'll have 200m agility xp
---
I almost voted yes because I want these things in the game but then noticed the partnership thing and changed to no.
---
I'll be voting yes it'll be interesting
---
Look at the second pic in the imgur album.
---
&gt;Pretty soon jagex will be offering leveling services or selling its own bots, jbots, for cash.
---
And people will praise them because "Wow what a smart way to deal with level boosters and bot farms!"
---
The same people that unironically say "OMG thank you for adding bonds Jagex what a great way to prevent RWT"
---
Dollar Shave my $11 off of Jagex‚Äôs revenue if this happens.
---
of course i didn't read it, how can i read that wall in like ten seconds you dumb cunt? legitimately amazed at the fact you can breathe unaided, you absolute tool. the day you off yourself will be the happiest day of your parents lives.
---
Uh Jagex makes more money off people who pay with membership through bonds than they do with subscription. 
---
Roughly $14 dollars for 28 days of members
---
or
---
$11 dollars for 30 days of members
---
Even with redeeming 3x at once or the summer bonus they still make more off bonds.
---
Same here. Not even right leaning, I'm pro abortion and have nothing against gay marriage or lgbt people in general. Would still vote trump, and I fully support the second amendment and think immigration from non EU countries is disgusting. As for people saying the second amendment is here to stay, how? Its already not respected in many states. How is banning bump stocks, concealed carry and open carry respecting the second amendment?
---
yes, that's what I said?
---
You think its a conincidence that after years of people asking, they finall remove poll results and then drop this on us?
---
You really don‚Äôt know what you have until it‚Äôs gone..
---
Plus they leave that part to the end so people like me who were just kinda skimming almost miss it. I corrected myself in time though.
---
they make more off bonds per membership lmao
---
Theatre of Blood
---
They make enough millions.. no need to hike anything
---
Probably better not to circlejerk MMK as some kind of anti-MTX hero. I still agree with his stance on these recent issues though.
---
Yep, check out this post from 2011 where they talk about their loyalty program and new cosmetics, emotes, animations
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/members-loyalty-programme--now-available
---
Would mtx eliminate 3rd party sites from profiting? I wonder if Venezuela bot farmers would stop lol
---
Because of mobile.
---
Look at some mobile reviews.
---
Tons of people bitching about how long it takes to do stuff and level. And that they wish there was a way to pay to skip some of the grinding.
---
These are the people who would pay $2500 in a heart beat to get all 99 stats and a tbow.
---
Just get 1000 of these people all over the world, and thats $2.5 million dollars just from a handful of whales.
---
I didn't know we could apply "logic" to subjective enjoyment of a game. People enjoy rs3, so I guess your argument already fails, really hoping you were /s
---
Geez. What was your email
---
This is how it would start. Whales vs whales
---
I think the fact that there's sub 50 people freaking on on a single world is kinda exactly indicative of the severity of this....'issue'
---
Amazing how low that number gets when all the bots log off.
---
White is right
---
They are polling cosmetic promotional items, so it's not quite direct mtx yet.
---
The issue is most people believe microtransactions and corporate decisions ruined RS3.  They killed free trade, focused on graphic updates, and then increased profit margins by letting people buy experience.  It's pretty overrun with mtx like a mobile game would be.
---
Osrs players generally don't like mtx, and are scared that jagex will overule the game devs in order to cash in.  
---
There isn't a problem with the stuff being polled per se, but people want to send a message that mtx won't be tolerated.
---
Less people buying bonds = demand goes down = bonds become less valuable = less people buy them... This is simple economics
---
Blind sided.
---
Do random events spawn on him?
---
No they have more than enough money for that already. They just don‚Äôt invest in it
---
Jagex is a company, you can never take the word of a company. Hell you can't ever take the word of a person. People lie all the time. Think of it like this, what incentive would they ever have to tell us the truth if we don't like the truth? NEVER TRUST
---
Better to fight than vote yes in fear of what‚Äôs worse
---
I‚Äôm not informed about Valve but EA already had a reputation of MTX
---
How so? I always figured bonds help curv RWT and gives an option for higher levels to grind for membership
---
120k points should be enough to but apsorptions for the next round so at least get that each session...
---
Delete this before the boomers see it
---
&gt;This forces people who play for fashion to pay.
---
It's free though.
---
I can only speak on my own opinion, but buying bonds just gives the player gold, which they could get through grinding a money making technique anyway. And buying bonds is a legal/allowed way to buy money so it devalues real world trading.
---
Adding cosmetics that are unlocked thru real world purchase change the way the game is seen as some items (even if they're just cosmetic) would be separated by a pay barrier. Osrs' items are all accessible right now thru real world trades or not and most people wanna keep it that way
---
epic
---
Or complete this survey?
---
The irony in this comment is astounding
---
Programming and gaming knowledge are weighed in weight lol
---
This sub throws the biggest fits over the smallest things. These are not microtransactions by any description of the word.
---
SIIIIIIIP
---
Now 2007 runescape, that was a good game
---
No but I understand how businesses work. Nobody works for free and no company has your best interests at heart. Is that news to you?
---
They might be playing on the fear of missing out to sway more voters towards voting yes. Who knows. I do want those cosmetics in-game though, especially the house styles.
---
It looked so stressful considering he head on handled the community multiple times
---
You are right, u/Fatzmanz obviously doesn't take into consideration OSRS private servers. We WILL get the itch on day 2, and then we WILL go into a private server just like we did before. Until jagex releases OSOSRS, and then we will play that until they fuck it up too, and the cycle continues.
---
... RS3 added P2W you fucking nonce.
---
Good thing they have backup from 2007
---
too late!
---
Complain after damage is done, truly the lowest IQ suggestion this subreddit has ever received
---
Imagine investing 2000+ hours into an account thinking that the future will remain bright for OSRS only to be presented with the exact same ideology that currently infests RS3.
---
Honestly you should make a range/2h pure on f2p just to get used to the mechanics, then level the same acc in p2p as like a gmauler with msb and work from there man
---
Your friend was right though, those aren't good pking stats.
---
Gl bro!
---
Hahaha now this is a protest post!
---
Thats my feeling too!
---
No you won't.
---
Y'all still play RuneScape? Thought we all just lurked the sub
---
Nice platitudes. As many countries have learned, and as the USA is learning: Votes don't matter if the votes are manipulated and pre-determined.
---
Yeah fuck this poll, don‚Äôt want shitty cosmetics thanks that‚Äôs not very old school at all, jagex pulling another dumb ass move
---
It's in their DNA and won't get out.
---
Jamflex, why don‚Äôt you tell your investors the next thing you‚Äôre doing to bring in income is a stable playerbase and lead with that?
---
And? That isn't the point. They release some new house theme. I can wait some amount of time to get it or pay money to access it early. That's not what this game is about. Besides the obvious argument of Jagex pulled this same shit in RS3.
---
When it‚Äôs finished so people‚Äôs votes can‚Äôt be influenced by others
---
They need more money to fund games that go nowhere.
---
Always funny how people bring up Blizzard who still have the most popular mmo and only re-released it because of fan's want for it and not because the fucked the original
---
11$ it barely passes
---
Lmfaoo this is my favorite one yet. Frighteningly viable timeline
---
That multi coloured cannon triggers me so much
---
Mostly zulrah and cox
---
Upvoting this cause I too am curious
---
Makes you wonder if Ash‚Äôs popularity will nosedive due to the crowd who don‚Äôt want cosmetic MTX either.
---
U probably also think it's ok to litter because only one person can't change the environment
---
Fuck Jagex tryna add this garbage, No I don‚Äôt want a shitty promotion locked emote from 2009  thanks you shifty fuckers.
---
Probably not. Make a new account and don‚Äôt bot
---
Didn't stop them the first time.
---
Oh really? How did MTX and cosmetics work out for RS3 for Jagex?
---
Get a URL and an archived link. Post it here. Done and done.
---
You know Jagex has set records in profitability since 2013? Stop with fucking bullshit anti consumer arguments, it‚Äôs ridiculous, hail corporate elsewhere
---
Never seen that before. Can you record a little bit of it when you see it happening?
---
Like seriously people who say they are going to quit if they mtx is comical. Mtx will cause damage to the game and players will leave slowly over time.
---
Rabble Rabble!
---
This ‚òùüèº
---
You seem to be forgetting how runescape 3 went to shit
---
Btw the leaf batteleaxe is worse than a d scim
---
I feel like this would make more sense if the glasses panels were swapped
---
Stop. Delete this.

I mean yeah but it looks cooler ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This screams sarcasm all over it.

It would save that extra click that isn't needed on mobile. Why have the options differ anyway?

---
On mobile you still need to select x all the time
---
Lololol sure you do, whatever delusions you need to tell yourself to rationalize spending your life playing a game instead of having an actual life and career
---
This would be awesome...
---
Very true which is why you need to spread word so it would be very clear the votes are manipulated if it does come to pass 
---
then people would have double the reason to be pissed off about the implementation on MTX, unlike irl you can very easily quit, also the company is dependent on you, the players for marketing and ofc, money. so if they add it and people quit, they add it more, and more people quit 
---
its a literal bottomless pit till all players are gone, then we get 2004/2010 runescape and NOW they are *very* against MTX but no one is going to fall for it again
---
No he quit a few weeks ago
---
*Him
---
Squeals is a male actually.
---
This guy knows
---
How about that one goat video? I‚Äôll brb.
---
It‚Äôs a limited time promotion, ALL PLAYERS will be able to access al Karid again after the end of the promo. ITS NOT MTX. WE WOULD NEVER ADD MTX.
---
Exactly, I agree it's not the same. But for now, we can only wait and see will Jagex keep their word and never bring MTX into OSRS like they stated.
---
Correct.
---
Fack off
---
There are people in this world
---
BOTTEM TEXT
---
If we could guarantee that the cosmetics would be the end, then it would be fine, but cosmetics in rs2/3 lead straight to in game benefits that were obtainable through mtx, it‚Äôs a slippery slope.
---
What are pool results
---
Bonds are a blessing
---
Yet they‚Äôve said they wouldn‚Äôt add anything beyond cosmetics. They‚Äôve promised that time and time again. That makes the ‚Äúits a step to Treasure Hunter‚Äù argument useless.
---
Arent bonds considered real money grand exchange?
---
If they were to fake poll results while the results are viewable, they would have to either manually add votes over time so there‚Äôs not just a massive 10k jump in yes votes every couple hours, or a massive 50k jump moments before it ends. Or they would have to add code that incrementally adds votes every so often. Both of these would take significant effort compared to the effort of rigging it whilst hidden.
---
With them hidden they just need to change a value before they become visible. Drastically different.
---
wow that's ancient eh
---
It's not like they are forcing you to buy anything do I dont understand why people have such a negative point of view
---
Did you play free-to-play before? The f2p version should be very similar to the way it was in 2007 aside from a few new pieces of content.
---
Fair enough
---
Sorry if it wasn't clear, I was wanting to highlight specifically the part about not going down the road of introducing mtx that undermines game integrity, but I can see how that would be confusing in a discussion about the introduction of mtx at all
---
This makes me physically ill. He's just bragging. Where's the passion for the game. Where's the talk about longevity, and increasing playerbase with a good game. Why is it all just analysis about if you can get away with adding mtx at this stage or not.
---
EA bad
---
I want to believe this but the somewhat vague poll questions and SWAMPHOMEGOOD question at the top makes me think that Jagex is trying to pull a fast one on unsuspecting/unknowing players
---
oh wow, TIL about that...
---
Actually if you have been following RS3 a little bit around... Since that chinese company took over, the MTX promos and their effectiveness have increased dramatically. The content updates start to get more and more "NOT RUNESCAPE" like. They have a totally different feel to the updates they made 3 years ago. 
---
The only reason nothing has happened so far in OSRS is because they pushed all their plans onto RS3. 
---
I'm scared when they actually start shifting their priority to OSRS... and Jagex can't do much about it when they hold the majoriry in their company.
---
The only argument against these additions is how they will be essentially rewards for no requirements. I don't like how you can get the Elven theme or Morytania theme for your house through a promotion, but you have to pay out the ass for a Tzhaar themed floor in *one* room. 
---
Everything else that's been said is just slippery slope this, slippery slope that which are just not very convincing imo.
---
Once the game starts to die it's too late.
---
Andrew Gower wouldn‚Äôt have done this to us
---
But we are talking about cosmetics. Even if is a house skin, they could buy bonds to buy other skins that are available. Plus, this new skin is available to everyone after a period for free. Screw it if they get the skin for a month if it brings new long lasting potential players.  I see this as a marketing attempt to boost new members rather than the short term cash grab of MTX (which honestly we have bonds, that‚Äôs probably the biggest MTX there is).
---
Outfit. I should mention that full graceful and trident of the swamp is the best method for barrows. If however you don't have full graceful or either of the tridents, then just wear your most tanky melee armor and cast your best spell. Their magic defense is so low that it won't that you got negative magic bonus. So long as your not splashing
---
I just ended my subscription today. Theres nothing we can do to stop this from happening, it's already in motion. I'll give it a year before osrs is completely unrecognizable.
---
1st step this, 2nd step spin2win, 3rd step OSRS becomes RS3 again
---
Make gilenor great again!
---
Downvotes are welcome for all you bitches that standby jagex even though you know they will fuck you over with mtx
---
What is MTX?
---
its only cosmetics bro! Bonds are MTX! brb going to find lead paint and snack
---
"Hey browski, I'll trim your dragon claws for you. Just give me your credit card number and the last 4 of your SSN and we'll be litty titty."
---
You let 1 thing slide, then it's ok for everything else
---
What I don't get is why not make it a reward from something like a quest? It's like MMK was saying. They struggle to find rewards for new content then they do something like this.
---
I hope mtx isn‚Äôt added but you should def get on those things my man. Make OSRS secondary not primary
---
I doubt anyone would miss that charming personality you have. BYE FELISHA!
---
To keep it short, we‚Äôve been through it before, there is zero excuse for this.
---
did OP forget the part where everybody gets the items later on at no extra cost?
---
Why would firemaking interact with acombat related skill. You fight kbd with range/melee with pray. Which correlates to strength, attack, and range levels. You do not need to use any of those in wintertodt.
---
But its just cosmetic? Theve stated they will not be moving past cosmetics. Partnerships like this keep the game alive
---
Not true at all... they have seen the result of the mistake they made with rs3 and that is a dead game so why would they do it again
---
Not an unpopular opinion since what you're really saying is "MTX bad"
---
Yeah this kid is gonna get banned or set with a shit random generated name
---
That face. That. Face.
---
Ya but fuck giving Actiblizzard money. There's plenty of wow private servers too.
---
im not defending partnership i dont like it personally but they do need to make money and right now looking at where their staff are they are prioritising rs3
---
The guy has sell in his name, what'd you expect

If this is your first time doing the fight caves I'd highly recommend reading the wiki or watching a video about it.
---
I think the caves themselves are a much bigger challenge than Jad itself
---
Man was you even around during the shitty EOC beta? Like someone has already said give these people an inch and they will take a mile.
---
Please, please critically think about this rather than taking that statement as gospel. Here's an example of the rs3 devs saying almost the exact same thing, one year before adding the squeal of fortune and the solomun store. https://i.redd.it/r5qd882qm4831.png
---
That's literally the most direct and relevant example I can provide. It would be one thing if this was the first time Jagex said they would avoid mtx, but it's not. They said the same thing years ago, and look where rs3 ended up. 
---
I lived through it, I've been playing since 2005, I was there for that statement, I was there for the SoF being added, I was there to listen to the backlash, and I was there when cosmetics, exp boosters, treasure hunter keys, auras, and lamps were added through mtx. This isn't new, this isn't unprecedented. It's unbelievable that people are still buying this horse shit. At least back then they waited a year before adding the mtx. With this recent statement, they said "we're not adding mtx, ever. Now here's a list of potential rewards from our upcoming mtx venture!". And you're voluntarily choosing to ignore that.
---
If your next thought is "paid promotions that offer rewards aren't mtx", please refer to my first comment until you break down the mental barricade you constructed when they said "we won't be adding mtx, even the ceo says so". Because maybe it's time to entertain the idea that Jagex lies sometimes.
---
Read their blog they cleary said they will not add mtx
---
Anything that requires extra money should be a live poll the whole time
---
Can buy it immediately
---
But you get pets at baby stages, and you have to have them out for X time and they'll eventually grow to Adolescent and then to full adult
---
You can change it between stages whenever once you've unlocked said stage. So can go from Adult to baby, or baby to adolescent, etc whenver you want as long as it got unlocked
---
He said as much during the vid I referenced. so yeah. I agree.
---
Level 4 bro what up
---
It's a meme about mtx, bro. And Trump supporters call his opponents snowflakes, easily triggered etc...
---
fair enough. i can respect your view :)
---
Id agree to disagree, for me history matters and i dont believe companies change this drastically in such a short span of time. if they had reverted rs3 to stay in line with their old promises i may have had another impression though
---
We really do need some Asian servers; maybe in eastern China? I'm sure there would be a solid draw from the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese markets to make it worthwhile.
---
Will do next time I see it happen!
---
Once again partnership isn't mtx its partnering with another company for the benefit of both parties not to mention they have said multiple times they will not add mtx to oldschool
---
I mean, if Jagex is adamant in introducing more MTX into OSRS, would voting no to these cosmetics do anything for us? Can't they just force the MTX into the game against our wishes?
---
Mate look what happened to rs3 history will repeat itself I promise you. They will 100 percent start slowly adding in bullshit key systems like Solomon‚Äôs shop or whatever.
---
They really weren't
---
The poll doesn‚Äôt mention anything about the partnerships. They are most likely going to happen with or without cosmetics. The rewards will just be free week of membership same as twitch partnership.
---
Photoshop 
---
Trade twisted bow or fake
---
Pipe down fool
---
Actually osrs doesn't need this. If you were to take the time to actually do some research, you would know that they already make more than enough money to keep the game afloat without mtx.
---
Literally 2012 was Jagex's busiest year and when EOC was beta'd and tested they lost loads of players at the start and they still kept pushing it instead of reverting everything. Jagex are hard headed it's better if we don't allow anything because one thing leads to another and not they also didn't poll the pride event so don't bet too much on polls.
---
And what do their staff do? They constantly miss their targets and produce more and more ‚Äúcontent‚Äù you can buy in the store.
---
What exactly do they need more money for? Again, they‚Äôre setting records mate.
---
Not can be, is. We live in a constitutional republic. "Democracy is 2 wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner."
---
So this isnt the first poll that's hidden cuz thatd be sus as hell
---
Thats my point. There is no need to worry.
---
I've been playing rs for 15 years and quit when eoc came out and if I thought for a moment that this was bad for our game I wouldn't be fighting to make it happen
---
It's not really equivalent because those other games don't let you play multiple characters simultaneously (or you could just have one member account shared between a bunch of people and all play at the same time)
---
Why the future tense? Those were the Twitch partnerships, this is the first bit of the downhill part.
---
I fucking love this game.
---
Don't apologize for being cheesy lol
---
They acquired Jagex more than 3 years ago, so, no? Lol.
---
Some of the most overpowered MTX promotions (smouldering lamps, prismania) started in 2014, years before the chinese company were ever a part of jagex.
---
They didn't touch anything, because there was an established system that works, along with a history of failures to not follow. The new company isn't going to fuck that up after paying over half a billion dollars.
---
What do they mean "first accessible with a partnership"? Does that mean they only allow players they're legally doing business with get access to it? If that's not what they mean I don't get it and someone needs to explain what they mean to me
---
People are being taken for a ride on the Jagex Ruse Cruise.
---
Because they will just repeat it all over again probably make another old school server and promise the same bullshit  and people buy into it and go along with it.
---
These Partnerships fall under the category of a time gated MTX, with a third party pay wall.
---
u/jagexsween thanks for the great q&amp;a. u did a great job :)
---
You should still ultracompost all herb patches cause it increases your yield.
---
Ok but what I wanna know is why does this dude still has a gadamn str ammy when he has primordials
---
Entire customer base? Everyone who plays osrs also has reddit? I think there will be a large amount of players who think it would be a good addition that doesn't just regurgitate what they read on an ignorant reddit post.
---
!remind me 2 months
---
actually that is wrong if you look there are more players playing rs3 than osrs, just because youtubers don't make videos on rs3 doesn't mean it's dead.
---
You still should for the increased yield
---
Cause when we quit rs3, we thought we were going to quit rs forever. Ik we were forgiving and came back for osrs but our point is that back then we didn't know we were gonna come back for osrs. We thought us leaving meant forever and we still did it. We'll do it again and won't be as forgiving for a replacement.

You seem desperate to shut down this theory.

I mean you're probably not wrong, but it's a bit early to fully quit
---
Idk why everyone is saying vote no to the polls, what‚Äôs currently in the polls would have no affect on the game besides add some dope POH designs, releasing something that doesn‚Äôt benefit gameplay a few weeks early for those who pay literally has no negative affects. People acting like they putting squeal wheel back in
---
:(
---
Let‚Äôs be truly honest for a moment. We will stop for a second and logically analyze why this would be one of the biggest mistakes.
---
To begin with, the reason OSRS is successful is due to its nostalgic player base. The majority of players are between 20-40 years old. Most of us are players who played in RS2‚Äôs prime between 2004 and 2007 who quit after removal of the wilderness &amp; the implementation of the trade limit, EOC, and MTX. The only reason we are back here after so many years is that we saw a chance to literally relive the nostalgic moments of our childhood and experience the good times we experienced between 2004 and 2007. The moment you take away the charm of allowing us to relive our childhood by implementing certain things such as MTX, even as harmless as cosmetics, people are going to unsubscribe as you are no longer offering a service that people desire. Through multiple personal anecdotes from myself, RS friends, and clan members, it is the shared of opinion of the majority of the player base that the only reason OSRS is successful is due to its nostalgic appeal. Once you change the core nature of the game, it is no longer the same game, and therefore no longer offers a nostalgic appeal. As well, adding MTX that will allow players to level up faster and make more money will only be detrimental to the membership subscription plan. The whole business model relies on making the player grind for as long as possible in hopes that they will be subscribed for the longest possible time as a member. The moment you allow them to skip to the end game, they have no reason to be subscribed to the game anymore as they are now bored. 
---
The following argument might be the strongest possible one. Like my girlfriend, and all of our gamer friends say to me all the time: ‚ÄúWhy are you playing this crap 80s looking game?‚Äù, why don‚Äôt you play GTA, League, WOW, etc? I say well it makes me feel good because I really enjoyed the game when I was younger. The truth is, the reason you have a player base is because we are all nostalgia addicts. The moment you‚Äôve pissed off the limited player base that exists, your company is screwed because your old game will not attract any new players. Your entire business model is reliant on nostalgia, and nothing else. Remember that.
---
Oh I'm not saying they are sinking but every big company is all about making more. Once you make 1 million you want 2 then 10 and so on but there is nothing wrong with afew minor cosmetics
---
‚ÄúHide the poll results for poll integrity.‚Äù 
---
*Jagex hides poll results* 
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hiding poll results so that they can push things through.‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs no winning...
---
Luckily, she took it as endearing lol
---
I can agree to that, it's an awkward situation that we as fans are put in. OSRS has been handled pretty fairly as online subscription based games tend to go, but I also don't trust corporate ideals. Hopefully for all of us this A. Doesn't pass and B. Isn't a "conspiracy" as far as jagex and potential partner companies go. Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Assuming jagex doesn't alter the votes in either scenario, visible poll results will and do influence other peoples votes. That's why people were asking for it
---
I‚Äôve watched a few videos and they all say the same thing, the caves are harder than Jad. The issue I have is a constant internet connection, my WiFi likes to dip on &amp; out and randomly disconnect me so I rarely do anything more dangerous that pray slaying.
---
Sorry to use your meme but this is war

They didn't forget their roots, they just don't care anymore.

I was pissed about that too but we just went from a purple skin to the like 13 things they polled today? That's a huge leap in the wrong direction.

This is fucking brilliant. It's a win-win-win for jagex, the partner and the player PLUS it breaths life into minigames which is something people have wanted forever.
---
Logged in on my break at work to book it to the nearest bank and vote no on everything. Ffs Jagex.
---
Jar of Belle , it costs you 30k a month just to own one!
---
I liked the idea of auras, it really is a pretty cool concept. But having them time locked by a monthly based currency is absolute bullshit.
---
One look at rs3 and the dominance of MTX there, additionally with the selling out of Jagex to Chinese investors is enough evidence. To not see the link here in fact makes you the child.
---
I haven‚Äôt played OSRS in a couple years but I still have an account and am definitely logging into to vote
---
Enormous if right
---
&gt;	Do you understand what a slippery slope is? You don't step on the slope and then complain once you start slipping. You can't recover. We are at the edge looking down a slippery slope in terms of MTX. Most of us don't want to even test this MTX model. Jagex's track record in this area is poor.
---
My point is that the slippery slope argument doesn‚Äôt apply here. Jagex COULD implement MTX this very second if they wanted. We literally don‚Äôt have any control over that and whether these partnerships come into the game or not doesn‚Äôt affect that at all. We aren‚Äôt losing the ability to walk back away from the slope because we don‚Äôt have that to begin.
---
&gt;	They could, but the backlash would certainly kill long-term profits. I don't think most would agree that's a good business strategy - unless you only care about quick $$.
---
Which is exactly the same situation Jagex would be in if they implemented MTX after the partnership system. How would it be any different if we allowed the partnership into the game?
---
&gt;	Beneficial to the game overall? Hah.
---
It would be. Jagex literally said the Twitch promotion went very well in attracting new players. Growing the player base is beneficial to the game.
---
Yeah nice solid evidence. Good work champ you solved it
---
im 3 defense
---
Different circumstances. That was said: a) under a different person. b) they never said it was just cosmetic. Squeal of Fortune was released with experience and all. c) Breaking a promise to the OSRS community would be a suicide mission. As far as I‚Äôm aware, they never promised not to add MTX initially anyway, and that was a player made conception.
---
Ah yes, the classic mindless ‚Äúcompany wants money‚Äù argument. We have found the apologist.
---
People downvote you and never saw what Treyarch did with Black Ops 4... THAT RIGHT THERE is the worst MTX I've ever seen from a western company.
---
(I played some korean/chinese MMOs that came to the west... they have horrible MTX)
---
Omg you just gave me a great meme idea

Rofl and let's not forget all about how they needed to hold F2P hostage just so they could have their precious bonds in game.
---
The game would be broken with unlimited and free server and faction changes though. That‚Äôs literally needed for the game to function. So much shit would get abused. Highmaul was a .5 tier.

I don't mind certain colours so long as they feel like they could belong to some kind of human like creature, like the green or bluish one. I feel like the purple one just looks out of place though. So long as it still looks fantasy themed and not just a random ass paint colour pasted on I'm ok with it.

To be quite honest, private runescape servers will never give that close to home feeling like an official server.

&gt;	Jagex has a parent company and shareholders. They couldn't care less if 30% of us quit playing as long as the whales make up for those losses and provide extra return in MTX. Take a look at RS3 or the mobile gaming market if you want to see a mature MTX environment. Do you see Jagex implementing quality, RS3 game updates with their MTX revenue? 
---
RS3 is literally a perfect of example of why Jagex wouldn‚Äôt do this. What shareholders in their right mind would lead a game down the same path of diminishing revenue that their last game went down?
---
He‚Äôs calling him out for having different opinion on the manner both privately and publicly.
---
That's a pretty shitty argument. Eventually has usually been at most 6 months in rs history for tiny shit like this, and if 6 months is an issue, I think we all need to collectively take a break from arguing over tiny bs. 
---
They got bought out by a shitty company that's now selling them. Fingers crossed we see some marked change when it changes hands, this time for the positive.
---
There's a lot more to it than "They're just cosmetics". 
---
It being cosmetics is different than buying instant level xx or double XP. I get your point, but you're acting as if they can't stop at adding random skins for Twitch prime like they've done before. But as soon as they add this shit they go all the way.
---
Welcome to how politics work.
---
A bill is vastly popular and would benefit many people, it then gets tied up to other less popular or unpopular bills that will benefit only a select few people, then more bills gets tied to that bill where after x number of rounds of this, you end up with "we'll provide more resources into building affordable housing projects but only if the big banks can get tax breaks and the stock market gets bailed out" etc etc.

There's very little information about PP, but no, not the urns I think. Sarcophagus success does decrease by 40% from room 4 onward. Gold chest stays pretty consistent.
---
The community asked for it so people wouldn't change their votes based on seeing the results.
---
no once you're perm banned name is gone too
---
It's not an evidence based claim so it doesn't matter. IMO though, what you're saying is exactly right but it's not the same as what that guy said. I think people who bought gold from sites pre-bonds would've continued to use sites but the important part is that many of the people who joined the game after bonds that would've RWT'd from sites didn't and bought bonds instead, with the downside of people sitting on the fence RWTing too. It's all just conjecture and without actual data it's hard to form an opinion on whether bonds were good or bad for the game.
---
I mean he didnt do it in a way though that was malicious really such as "calling someone out" usually goes hand in hand. If anything he was more just "saddened" by the fact hes being a bit two-faced.

In Destiny 2 (and other games), you can earn lootboxes (Engrams) for free by getting XP from all in-game activities. These lootboxes offer items that will become purchasable with a non-premium currency after a certain amount of time on a rotation.

I think it's safe to say that most people consider lootboxes microtransactions.

&gt;Adds bonds
---
&gt;Adds partnership
---
they haven't added partnership, and they have added bonds.
---
I don't think that's fair for the argument.
---
Someone provided it. I stand corrected on that point. I still do think is farfetched to think it'll happen, because the sole reason why OSRS is there in the first place, is because of MTX being introduced in RS3. I know we like to make devs and companies stupid, but I have a hard time thinking they're honestly that stupid. It would be like if they introduced LFR and other things into Classic WoW. Things which made people go away from Retail WoW in the first place.
---
Given their track record, sure they might be able to fuck up, but honestly we're at a point now where it should be completely obvious that milking OSRS with MTX would make them lose more money than they'll gain from it.

I agree with this. Dude isn‚Äôt even working right now, so he didn‚Äôt get another offer.

Want to hear the truth?
---
Almost all of the players won‚Äôt quit if this partnership thing gets implemented with or without the polling. Everyone will just chalk it off as it‚Äôs only cosmetics and not bad, they are just doing it for money etc and I will quit if it goes further. However that‚Äôs the funny aspect because threatening to quit right now before it even passes or gets implemented but 100% rest assured when that time comes, you‚Äôll still be playing and so will the others. Sure you‚Äôll quit when you can buy a red dragon dildo from amazon GE with 50 random levels chest but that‚Äôs in the future. 
---
Keep talking empty threats, that‚Äôs all they are. 
---
Most these fools can‚Äôt  stay away from osrs right now , what makes you think a purple skin color will make them quit. Maybe for an hour, then they‚Äôll be back lol.
---
You don‚Äôt seem to understand that the poll only gets the opinion on that exact question. They can poll about what can be added to the partnership program without ever having a question on if the program should exist. Jagex controls what is on the poll, and thus the poll only gives answers to the questions Jagex wants to ask
---
Worst part? Rs3 isnt even dead yet, its still a cash cow.
---
I intentionally tried to get one with no talking
---
Based on how the twitch promotion went down:
---
&gt;How long after the promotion?
---
Immediately
---
&gt;How will we get them afterwards?
---
Depends on the item, but probably automatically unlocked
---
&gt;How much will they cost?
---
Nothing, they said free on the blog
---
&gt;Who are the partners?
---
Can't really divulge that before the contracts are in place
---
&gt; Pretty soon jagex will be offering leveling services or selling its own bots, jbots, for cash.
---
Why did I suddenly think about Jagex banning third-party clients, but also implementing an "OSRS Plus" subscription (think Dota Plus) which has the Runelite features.
---
Dear god.
---
So it was said by the ceo/shareholders.
---
what makes you think people care?

That‚Äôs why I quit RS. For me I simply stopped playing games that have any type of MXT. It‚Äôs the principle, when I pay for a game or pay for subscription I shouldn‚Äôt even be asked to give more money to them. I get why they do it I just don‚Äôt agree with how they do it. Charge for a monthly subscription, the business wants more money? Try getting more people to play the game instead of milking money out of the current player. Strive to get new players.

Hopefully Jagex stocks fall enough and the Gowers buy it back.

Yeah they also pay their staff shit lol

Bonds are MTX.  F2P was only going to polled under the condition that bonds came with it. It was polled as so.
---
The MTX is this current poll are cosmetics, things like alternate animations, reskins and emotes. You should go vote if you haven't.
---
See at least you gave it another chance and decided the combat system ultimately doesn't fit you and that is fine. I also quit when EoC came out but having returned to it now I must say it's really fun and better than OSRS PvM (but obviously OSRS PvP &gt; RS3 non-existent PvP).

I hate the childish attitude the OSRS community has towards RS3 without having even giving it another go. Even with all it's controversial content the game at it's core is still really enjoyable.  I wish more people tried it again and then if they still didn't like it then fair enough, but bitching about it without having played it in 5+ years is stupid.

Eat my ass you donkey.

I understand what you‚Äôre saying. However what I‚Äôm trying to convey here is by beckoning out to these investors who are proven to have their eyes solely driven on quick gains for some quick and easy money is not the best move in my opinion. Let‚Äôs say these investors do read these pages in their respective tongues and decide it‚Äôs a great idea to invest in. Well suddenly if Jagex is not pumping out the quick dollar they are expecting, then they feel pressured to begin doing so. Thus begins MTX. I hope you can see where I‚Äôm coming from.

The fuck is wrong with you
---
He didn't
---
We pay we gay.....nothing‚Äôs wrong mate
---
That game was going under. Osrs is thriving.
---
I've missed a good crab rave
---
What's your slayer level? Brutal black drags are good money and easy with 1def
---
Yeah. It did.
---
I quit after they stopped releasing results of polls. I don't see how not disclosing the results is positive for players. It seemed like it would just allow them to ignore poll results.
---
You are exactly the problemmmm
---
Oh, that was just some picture I found online, not my account lol
---
Ahh the threat of quiting, always sneaked in. 
---
I laugh because nobody quit when bonds were introduced. They are the definition of MTX. Okay they‚Äôre good mtx, a necessary evil  you might say. But, what if this partnership program gets implemented anyways regardless of passing or failing. Nobody is quiting, I give you that. 
---
OSRS / runescape 2 thrives without bonds, so telling me bonds were necessary is bull, it‚Äôs more money for jagex in the form of mtx. They implemented that without a slight of decrease of players. MTX is coming, just a matter of when, and your not going to quit, sure maybe when you can buy levels or what not, but remember mtx creeps not all at once, and by allowing bonds , you‚Äôve crossed that line initially. Justified it as a necessary MTX.
---
Imagine if these sponsorships bring in tons of players, let‚Äôs say 5x the amount right now, you really think these new kids will give a shit about nastolgia? You‚Äôll be pushed out of your majority vote very quickly. Don‚Äôt forget that
