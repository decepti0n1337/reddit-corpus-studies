For runscape specifically it's a very good solution. You make a new secure one with a unique password and you basically never have to use it ever again. I don't see anything wrong with that. It's peace of mind too.

I burn out from AFK training as well. There's something about the hand eye coordination of some click intensive methods that appeals to me (serum 203's, 3T tar, lavas, stun alching etc). I'm by no means a macro efficient player because I still 'waste' time by having fun with chatting and skill hopping because I get bored easily, but micro efficient methods are fun when I hyper-focus.
---
Reasonable. Let's say for now the number is arbitrary. Is there a bonus at which that advantage is equally matched with a solo ironman player? What if it was a 40%, 75%, 100% invisible stat boost for playing solo? 
---
Quest, quest, quest... Get that agility banged out early for that graceful, will help a ton with Skilling and quests ect... If you get 70 you can afk blue drags for that 43 prayer really early making questing allot faster!

So kinda noob question here. My current goal is to get to farming Vorkath (still a long way off, just hit 70s in all combat stats and need more skills for quest reqs), and so I'm eyeing getting a DHCB (eventually). But it's 130m which is an insane amount of money to me right now with my money making methods. Even high level Vorkath farming is only like 2.5m/hr, so that translates to 52 hours of farming Vorkath to pay for it. Is this a correct assessment or am I missing something that makes 130m a more feasible goal?
---
Why does this hurt me so much to hear?

Just made one about 2 months ago myself!! Feel free to add me. "Notradeforme" few things, that are outdated vs older videos. 
---
Farming is VERY valuable. 
---
Contracts at 65 are CRUCIAL since you can't get assigned trees, which makes it consistantly allotment patches and flowers. You can build easy seeds here. Master farmers are a.. fairly reliable way to get to that level. 
---
On the same note, BIRDHOUSE RUNS. You get tree seeds, more importantly, lots of fruit tree seeds. These are my main source of XP. Once a day, 15k~ xp. Plant as often as you can. 
---
Also, future you, will thank past you for the nests. 
---
Quests are crappy, but those xp rewards are the most important early. 
---
Always keep prayer in the back of your mind, and use GP for magic if possible.

Dont be afraid to buy stuff. Mid game slayer makes tons of gold, use it to make what you do more efficent.

And also, others who are doing the exact same thing didn‚Äôt get banned. It‚Äôs just a gross fuck up all around from every aspect. Almost impressive 
---
And i would still pay 111 dollars for it. Sure the customer support could improve. But comparing Jagex to amazon is abit wrong. Also i have more faith in the people who have been doing this since i was a kid, rather than my own knowledge as a player. I believe all decitions are taken with good intent and knowledge to back it up.
---
Addiction, and possibly a mix of nothing else better to do.
---
he's an atheist. 
---
literally everyone does at every bracket.
---
at low levels that might work yeah, but you'll need 25+ prayer which isn't very viable anymore once you get into higher 60's, just depends if you want to make new accounts costantly as you'll level up pretty fast through pking.
---
most people are 1-13 prayer until low 70s.

Or even better, make random loot system like in RS3 back in 2009 or so. Like if you risked more than 75k you'd get some statuettes, some rune armor pieces n shit. If you risked less than that you'd get stuff like tuna, mithril items and stuff. Even if you killed skulled max with bis items you'd get like dragon legs or something around that. I remember it was later patched so you get more items that person lost or so, but back when they released pvp worlds I remember you'd get shit even if you killed max hybrid. :D I know that's shit idea, but combined with ironman mode+random shittyass loots like that+ removing keys kinda might work.

I wasn‚Äôt comparing jagex to Amazon, I was giving you an example hence why I said other companies. Amazon is worth wayy more and generally is a different platform. But I don‚Äôt play other games but a good comparison would be a game that is made by a company who‚Äôs value is near jagexs. Almost all games/ companies have excellent support. People always say wow support does wonderful things and this and that. Only company I ever seen without customer support is jagex. If you call the customer support they currently have customer support then your out of touch with reality because that isn‚Äôt customer support, maybe support at best, support at helping you achieve nothing . Lol

He doesn‚Äôt really mention Runescape in the video but there have been a few posts around the internet referencing him. Will try to find the posts and will edit this post.

Hey man i'm glad someone getting lucky, hope the RNG stays on your side :) Since I posted to reddit I will get one though.

Also get your strength up. Best way to train is having a higher strength level than attack and defence so you minimise your time training them.

You really gotta do better than that standard "muh muh incel/neet muh basement" 
---
You actually dont see it?
---
Unequal application is why people are pissed about this. Jagex doesn't hold any sort of standard when it comes to their governing of the game. The rules are too subjective and are enforced at the whim of the mods. This isn't an isolated incident either sadly. The polls are only enforced when the mod team agrees with the end result rather than having changes be properly tested and researched prior to polling and tools like WMK are allowed for years before being bannable. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In this instance, Torvesta asked the mods in the past if his playstyle was permitted and they said yes. There were no rule changes in this matter since that ruling and the banning this season.
---
Ironman at sandcrabs.. smh go train slayer instead of making a post like that
---
I hope so too :D

Goodluck on your shard endeavour! I feel like you'll get it soon.

Even for uim?   I thought the wine chest wasn't u locked until the monkey subquest.  Which is why I need the 70 cooking.   It's not, I do agility pyrmiad happipy daily for the xp and 200k gp per hour.  What do you think the expense is 50-70cooking?

IMO, if you're going to do mm/mm2 regardless, might as well do it early and take advantage of I he benefits instead of rushing to get the chins then having to settle for a worse option and regret it later if you do the quest afterwards.
---
how do others get by? i get instabanned when i try to

In the long term, basically yes

This looks better than kurasks at 99 range. If I use rcbow and lobsters instead of prayer recon I could get at least half of that in a hour?

Looks like those old school food court cups.

I can't imagine many people paying over $100 for a copy of offline runescape lol

After the first sub quest you get access to the chest. As you progress in the quest, the stock of ingredients increases. I think it starts out at 2, then 4, etc
---
I don't give a shit, retard.
---
He does leave the safe zone on it. He said in the video he uses it to pvp weapon hunt for more of a chance at getting them.
---
Thanks for the party, that was a classy move. Gratz on the 99!
---
Based on the demands of your customers lol and yes you can. Businesses shift funding all the time. Yes if it's a large change it's done when the budget is released (which it could have been) but it doesn't mean that they can't do it now.
---
Is nobody going to mention his thumbs are as long as his fingers ?
---
I think technically is the only way it can be right.
---
Great way to get people interested is banning one person for doing something others do as well if you ask me
---
I would too - casual scaping without wifi and random retards on my Ironman? Would be fun 
---
To me it seems there is no splashing xp, then on top pf thatthe xp per hit is basically like the xp from using a trident, and hp xp is still the same, so for free runes i say it's forsure worth it, just a decent team sadly needs to be in order üò¨ im shocked there aren't iron man groups that do this üòÖ
---
Yea just get it done now. Fossil island has a lot of decent content. The hardwood tree patches are really good cheap farming xp. It has the ammenite crabs which usually are never crowded because of the quest barrier for that place. You can do some good for some slayer tasks there too. Easily get to ~65 hunter just doing birdhouse runs for a month. Lots of stuff there. Looks like you have decent stats to start going for the quest cape so start that too minus a few. 
---
Im trying to make a pk account and im wondering if i should train prayer?

I want to f2p pk first and turn it into a gmaul build if I end up liking pk‚Äôing.

Ironmen can't use the group feature so they'd be alone, then for most mains and ironmen there are more profitable places to barrage/burst idk like smoke devils or something.

You want 'free' mage exp as an ironman you could be looking at BA tricks with a few alts. 
---

---
So in other words, you don't even have a valid reason for it. Sounds good.
---
explain how.
---
The bow requires 20 more ranged levels and a 50 agility requirement. Not bad in return for a +3 max hit.
---
The ammo isn't retrievable either.
---
What if free trade is restricted in DMM, and only GE trading is allowed? This kills muling and clan advantage over solo players but also has a ton of downsides, primarily 0 incentive for skillers to participate. Less skillers means it's much tougher for players to get access to supplies.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna force rotation 2

I changed my email which has a 2fa, how do I change my security questions on osrs

That's fair the only person I'd really share with is my brother but he doesnt care about osrs rn anyways, so I should be good there hahah. It just seems out of any game I've played osrs has always had me worried about being hacked and this goes back to 10 years ago when I played as a pre-teen kinda funny how prevalent it still appears to be
---
Ragging is constantly attacking someone with no intention to actually fight, you're essentially just focusing on preventing the other player from pking.
---
i was thinking mine x ores within the guild. So it would be coal, mithril, adamant, rune, or amethyst.
---
the concept is the same as how the farming guild works.
---
Not a chance, their range attack is very accurate and can relatively high. High enough that it would burn through your lobsters and you‚Äôd get maybe 4 kill trips lol
---
Whenever you can do the feud, I would do that to gain access to blackjacking. At lvl 37 or so (not entirely sure) you can start blackjacking. Alternatively, you can pickpocket the master farmer, and this could make you some decent money if you're lucky with herb seeds. Lastly, you can pick the fruit stalls in Zeah just north of sand crabs for some quick xp as well.
---
There‚Äôs private servers with reasonable fidelity to the game that you can run in your computer and play solo
---
No fucking shit. What did you think the " " meant?
---
You can probably find a source somewhere on google. Not sure what the latest revision would be but that would most likely be the best way to play offline. Around 8 years ago I used to practice Java on a blank RuneScape server. Was actually pretty useful for me to break into programming. Fast forward to now I'm working with quantum algorithms to change the way we do density functional theory simulations (to basically try and simulate reactions). This could be incredibly useful in predicting certain drug interactions using AI and even finding new, undiscovered drugs. Heading to a university to test out a quantum computer next week haha.
---
A quick Google search says that you should be able to find what you're looking for on rune server.
---
Youre allowed to play alts, you have always been, you cant just have the alt sit and hug the safezone though.
---
How is this not downvoted to oblivion?
---
If you wanted to f2p pk first, then you fucked up by training prayer. A rule of thumb in f2p is to always keep prayer at 1. Might as well continue with the build at this point.
---
Daaaamn gz on the new bank!
---
&gt; He creates wealth on safezone alt by flipping and then uses that on main.)
---
Where does the wealth come from in the first place?   If the safezone alt is just flipping, he had to have funded it in the beginning by muling it no?

While I don't think torvestas ban was justified, this statement is completely wrong lol
---
That's what I meant, old players hearing from friends or social media. I'm sure advertising is playing a part too but let's be real, how many people who didn't play osrs actually think it's a good game when they don't have the nostalgia
---
Gotcha
---
Sory the quality sucks but no I think you are seeing the runelite name tag. If a person had logged in underneath me I would have seen another name tag pop up.
---
hoooow
---
They said free instead of few, also if you looked at the tweet then you would see that they clarified that the Hosidius rework has more development going on but they've been able to bring the seed vault release forward. 
---
Obviously advertising plays a huge part but who would start playing this game in 2019 for the first time? It's all old players being told by friends or social media that osrs is a thing again.
---
hide poll results

Lame
---
He's not your slave and he shouldn't be bothered with such trivial and menial work
---
Yes
---
Surely the timing on that is highly unlikely given he was skulled on the second d spear spec. 
---
Yeah I figured it was unlikely - even bigger stretch though, what if he attacked you 2+ hours ago, hopped and waited until timer was almost up, logged out so that skull timer wasnt going down anymore, waited for a scout to see you, and then same concept as my first comment?
---
Not to beat a dead horse but I really can't think of any other way to explain it

No one is crying. I just wanted an explanation for what happened.

Unlikely but if the pker times it so that when he first logs back in there's ~20 seconds of aggression left then it would make sense he wouldn't get skulled for the first spec.... And if anyone were to pull some nutty shit off like that it would be the osrs ok community lol. I think it'd be doable with some practice

At some point it will just click after like 50 kills i started figuring out what each rotation contained and started getting more and more successful. Keep up with it bro u got this!
---
they did think it was a bad idea because they were too stubborn to listen to the community even back then they were SURE that eoc would be a success regardless of any feedback back then they dont know how to listen to the players i think i remember at one point they said they pretty much scrapped all of the rs stuff before eoc because they were so confident in its success at the time

Try disabling hardware acceleration, that often fixes the side bar if it‚Äôs glitchy on your system. There‚Äôs an explanation for how to do that on their github wiki.

---
If you're looking to actually train construction, and you want to do it "cheap," I'd do oak planks. Oak larders until 74 and then oak dungeon doors from there. I think mounted mythical capes is slightly cheaper, but it's quite a bit slower than dungeon doors.
---
get 80+ range and defence before doing vorkath. 90+ is recommend. And blowpipe is more than good enough. Don't expect 2.5m/hr in the first 100 kills, and while under 90 range. Also if you're going to camp vorkath, make sure to get elite void and salve ei
---
I know this isn't helpful to your situation but why trust trade with anyone? Dont trust trade and dont account share and the chances of getting cleaned are small.

yea we dont have it because it stupidly broken

I haven't done raids 2, but for raids 1 I'd say at minimum 80+ mage/range/melees with 90+ being good and 95+ being ideal. I'd also strongly suggest 78 herblore.
---
Minimum gear is rather cheap, you can get by in about 30mil worth of gear. I'd suggest joining the We Do Raids discord and looking through their raids 1 resource channels.

Oak dungeon doors probably. The correct build interface number and remove option are both on the 1 key, so is asking for more planks from butler.

If they never banned anyone they would lose real players as well. There has to be a balance between no bans and looking like you're doing something.

I tried to recover my account while on holiday because I couldn't get through my email's 2fa without text.

And I failed twice. 
---
It's pretty sobering to know that if I ever lose my account I wont't be able to recover it because I don't know what month I made the account 14 years ago and what month I first subscribed, or which ISP my parents used back then.  Hell I might have even made the account at my friend's house . He had two family computers so I would go over there and we would play side by side.

One of my passwords was compromised recently. For those of you who use the same password for everything please....please use a password manager or memorize more than one password. Your email password HAS to be different than your Jagex password. Passwords get leaked all the time. I run a website and the host database was stolen. My email had a few failed attempts on it, my credit card log ins had failed attempts, you name it. Change your password. If all you do is reddit and runescape, have two different passwords for both. Security goes both ways.

if you're making your own super you may as well make your own ultra, it just takes 25 volcanic ash.

makes sense that your yield goes up by 20% when the minimum yield is 5 with super and 6 with ultra, which is a 20% increase to minimum yield and you still have a chance to get more.

First we start with a step, then go from there. We're crawling at this point with no customer support. 
---
They are pulling resources/staff from other tasks/projects to 'cover' a small part of the customer support required.
---
Customer support doesn't need to be a full time position. I think you could easily break it up for a part time staff member, either 2 days a week or 3 hours a day. Perfect for a student.

Of course, if one isn't enough, we either settle with what we have, or employ more.

Ty for the link but I‚Äôve looked on the wiki already and it doesn‚Äôt give any drop rates other than saying that it gets reduced by 80% when you reach 20 levels higher than what‚Äôs required for the course you‚Äôre on.

So let's say they'er not bots, they are just sad people sitting around waiting to "stop" rushers and tbers. You advocate that people can pk however they want, yet you say people try to STOP them from pking the way they want because they deserve it. If everything goes, why do they deserve it? Or is it that someone lost their claws and now dedicates hours of their time looking for the big o'l meany who caught them off guard?

Actually I am struggling with it. Because you‚Äôre telling me that there is no exceptions to speed limits while also telling me that emergency vehicles are an exception to speeding. That‚Äôs a contradiction bro. See this isn‚Äôt RWT this is a behavior that literally every mod except the one who ban torvesta is ok with.
---
Torvesta and many other players have played like this in the past with permission from pmods, and if you don‚Äôt believe that, they played in the tournaments with jagex knowing their behavior. Only now Torvesta excluded from that behavior for no reason at all.
---
It would be like a police officer pulling over an ambulance with their lights on.

I stopped reading because I never told you there are "no exception to speed limits"

As a male in his mid 20's, it is my opinion that Torvesta has a shit ass haircut. 
---
On another note, are you looking for a step dad? I think your mom and I could bond over cosmetology.

Because they changed the duel arena so you can't stake items anymore, only cash.

Games don't always have consistent framerates, such as pre-rendered movies have. So for 30 fps every frame will be displayed for 33ms before a new one is shown.
---
Some of the frames will not be consistent enough to draw a new frame for every refresh cycle, and even though you have 30 or 60 fps, it might feel like less, as multiple frames will be displayed several times, while some will not get drawn because now you have more than one frame to fit into one refresh cycle.
---
So when you have more frames than the panel can display, you'll have a higher consistency of new frames for every refresh cycle, and as a result you'll actually have a new frame ready for all the 30 frames instead of having several frames shown multiple times and some getting lost because there's no some for them now when you're playing/recording at only 30 fps, and this will be reflected in the video.
---
This is the reason why pro CSGO playes will play at 300-500FPS on 60-144hz panels.

That's how he looks in literally every picture, seriously go through his instagram, same expression.

He looks better when his hair has grown out a bit IMO. I think he got a fresh trim after he got DQ'd or maybe before DMMT started knowing that he wouldn't have as much time during the tournament or seasonals.

Yeah that sounds like a win win to me.

Can anyone explain how I got logged out?  I was staring at my client, talking to a friend ingame, nowhere near the 6 hour limit,, no attempting to reconnect message and in a not full world.  I didn‚Äôt get the ‚Äòyour account is already logged in‚Äô message when I logged back in about 3 seconds later and I don‚Äôt think the ip at the top of the log in screen was any different.  My friend told me that he saw me log off and on but nothing fishy.  Should I be concerned or is this just my $11 hard at work?
---
In constant contact with at least one of my hands
---
Considering it's a competitive PvP tournament with minimum requirements to qualify, one might assume that would mean competing to qualify for the tournament.
---
Have they specifically defined competitively in the context of DMM, though? No. I suppose they could for the lawyer types like yourself who think they can get rulebreakers off the hook due to a technicality even though the intent of the rule is quite clear.
---
It's an MMORPG, you decide how you want to play. That's the whole point of an MMO, if someone wanted to stay in Lumbridge and kill nothing but goblins they could. They may find it fun. 
---
If you wanted to stand in one spot for hours on end doing nothing in the game then you could.
---
The whole point of an MMO is for you to decide what you want to do with your character/account. You don't have to specifically adhere to one aspect of the game.
---
It doesn't.
---
It just makes it fun.
---
Step 2 is to ignore all the dumb rules against playing multiple accounts. Clans still have an advantage but that is entirely unavoidable, but then you can still play a few accounts to farm items for yourself. 
---
What if you can't trade players but only use G.E. Tell me why my idea sucks.

Can I get a "Hit him with the crossbow steve!"?

Venezuelan gold farmers are not bots, they're legit people playing.

I remember in like 06 I wanted to transfer a party hat to my alt so I went to the library with my friend, helped him make an account, and walked him through tutorial island so I could do the transfer in lumby.

Essentially, DMM has 2 open periods each "season". Directly after each tournament, a new "season" starts and runs for a month. After the end of the month, the top 2,000 players on the highscores are invited to play in the invitational which lasts for a week. 
---
The finale of the current invitational is on Saturday, directly after that ends, a new season begins and anyone is able to play for the next month and top 2K will qualify for the next tournament which will probably be held around June.
---
Considering the R stands for my last name and the number is significant, I have no clue what point you are trying to make. Get off Reddit and take a break bruh, I know your fingers are achin‚Äô from all the negativity you‚Äôre spreading

Venezuelan gold farmers are not fucking bots. They are actual people playing the accounts.

For tob just go to 416 and go with other low kc people, there‚Äôs usually plenty.

All old accounts were transferred to runescape 3. When old school was released (in 2013?), everybody started off fresh.

Even if you did get your account back, you would still start off on tutorial island.

Nah, pretty sure he's just taking a dig at the excessive power creep which has taken place in osrs
---
Randomized factions could work as a way of deterring something like that. However, the most damage an alt can do is try to get info from the clan chat when there's 50 players per faction but only 1 or 2 alts per faction like you say, but with 40 different factions that's a lot for any one clan to keep track of, and players could just form their own clan chats after talking to each other in the faction clan chat, and simply not let anyone that seems like an alt for another clan join the personal clan chat they create.

Hey so good news and bad news. Bad news first- this is not the same runescape as 10 years ago. This is oldschool runescape and the game was released in 2013, based on a backup of the game from 2007. The account you used to have does still exist in regular runescape, which has been getting continual updates for the whole time, but that is a separate game from old school runescape sometimes called RS3. You are free to continue from your old account in rs3 (if you can recover it). 
---
If you elect to play oldschool, no matter what happens with your old account, you are 100% required to start fresh regardless. So you kinda may as well just make a new account tbh. 
---
I prefer playing on iPad over pc

Mining in motherlode is big money when you get to higher levels. Woodcutting is easy money and very afk. If you want to fight though, getting your slayer up will probably net you the most coin, and it will get your combats higher. 
---
RuneHq and Zybez
---
yeah i can see that

&gt; That doesn't make any sense either. There is zero motion blur, regardless of framerate.

For the record, low video bitrates do cause what appears to be motion blur through artifacting. But it looks like shit.

You should do canifis until 60 agility, depending on how lucky you are you should have enough marks of grace before you leave canifis (assuming that you started It at 40 agil) I got my full graceful set at 57 agility, however I know someone who didn‚Äôt get enough marks of grace until he hit level 65.

honestly if he just venged up and double tapped jad with d claws there's a decent chance he wouldn't even need to tick eat.

Another thing to keep in mind is that you can just sell it after you're done with Vorkath and rebuy when you're ready again. You'll get merched a couple 100k each time but that's not a big chunk if you're doing for hours each time

Oh man, I'm giving hcim a go and decided to do a twist on the rush 90+ fish at barb, 99 fm at todt 83 hunter meta. I'm doing aerial from 35-83 hunter, switching to barb whenever my hunter unlocks a new catch but fish lvl needs to catch up then head back to aerial. once I hit 83 hunter i'll probably barb fish to 90 before only fishing when I want to get actual food. i'm lvl 65 in both currently and while I do think this is a pretty good method to rush and the bonus of getting angler with no xp waste is great, goddamn this shit is aids to do.

If you have no pets out it will automatically follow you with the message in chat. You can telly out and if you can't see it yoy just have to click on the whistle icom under your equipments tab.

If you do have a pet out it will automatically go into your inventory with the pet message in chat.

If you havr a pet and your inventory is full you'll just get the message that you would have been followed

Your pet teleports with you to most places. You‚Äôll be notified if you try a transportation method that requires you to pick it up (minecart to keldagrim for example)

What?

Nice to see RS3 players supporting the cause.
---
There are unrestricted worlds designed specifically for this. I think the real issue is the complete lack of PVP content and necessary updates. The wilderness is dead as ever and the only active places(eg revenants) are dominated by clans. Single combat areas are a joke because people can just bring a clan to tag you with specs until your dead. It‚Äôs just sad.

World 420 every time, no matter what (unless I'm doing pest control or some other world-specific minigame), I also get the lowest ping on this world
---
Wait what? When was this?!
---
I see what you mean, but I just don't understand why so many people worry about hackers knowing their name when they could just go on highscores, find a maxed account that probably has more wealth, and hack that.
---
Unfortunately, the wiki doesnt have any guide on the method. So probably not :(

It is the helmet to the diary outfit so I‚Äôd say yes it.

Man, that's a shame [the wiki doesn't have any guide on the method](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nightmare_Zone/Strategies) on the page for Nightmare Zone. Crazy.

Omg thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis
---
New noob question here (10 year break).
---
Should i train melee at crabs or simuntaniosly with slayer?
---
Iam currenly 56 att 50 str 50 def and combat 65.
---
Thanks
---
If the Twisted Bow and Blowpipe (two most powerful weapons that have ever existed in RuneScape) are considered "Old School" then so are Chaotics/Nex armours.
---
OSRS pking has potential, but Jagex doesn't know how to implement it correctly and doesn't really listen to the community when it comes to PVP
---
Yeah but really you just want it for the black mask effect so you only get a benefit of the slayer helm in situations where you need the protection from the helmet and the boost (such as abberant spectres). Generally the unlocks are: Blocks &gt; Bigger &amp; Badder &gt; Herb Sack/Rune Pouch/Slayer Rings &gt; Slayer Helmet. But with all that said, I got slayer helmet first and didnt really regret it. 
---
Did anyone ever seriously hope for this? Rng on hits is what eliminates it as an esport in the first place anyway
---
Talking doesn‚Äôt count as activity, nor does moving the camera 
---
Imagine vaping and calling some1 pussy LOL ugly nerd virgin
---
It's not really a grey area. The intent of the rule is to prevent people from having their wealth stored safely on a character that will never face the risk of losing any of it when getting killed. That's exactly what Torvesta was doing.
---
The only reason anyone considers it a grey area is because Torvesta supposedly got approval from a JMod last season to do this exact thing when he obviously should've been told no.
---
oooh ya that doesnt explain how to do absorption tho :(
---
Unfortunately, runescape in general is a pretty big waste of my time so anything related to it could also be considered a waste. Unless, of course, we acknowledge that anything that brings pleasure isnt "a waste of time," which then means my amusement from this entire post was not quite a waste ;)
---
Did you also got some fire and nature runes within that slayer task?
---
D spear spec isn‚Äôt an AOE, is it? I noticed the guy behind you got a ‚Äú0‚Äù hitsplat the moment your second spec went off. The first guy was stunned and the dragon was trying attack your target, so I don‚Äôt know where else that 0 could‚Äôve come from.
---
That‚Äôs awesome gz!
---
Probably. Or you could've just been doing NMZ with absorb pots for the past while and never even had make this post. Could've imbued a slayer helm by now. Or read a wiki page or two.
---
I got 2 Jar of Souls at Cerberus. In 40 kc.

Pure ironman isnt the greatest of ideas but they can always modify it somehow. For example, you only get the 3 most expensive items, or you can't get loot from the same person within 4 hours etc.  Anything would probably be better than the current shitfest.

Holy shit.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt laugh but that magpie just got deleted from the 3D realm.

Except you've shown you aren't good at single-tasking. So I don't think it's applicable here.
---
The clue is trying to tell you to buy 99 construction. 
---
High alch? You‚Äôre giving him too much worth. The slime ball should low alch himself.
---
Madlad.
---
Of course they can be ignored but knowing there's a better option available is attracting you to do it. For example woodcutting 99 became like one of the easiest 99 after Ivy's which took away some of that accomplishment I felt going for 99 and I lost interest there.  Summoning were needed like the beaver boosted you and burden familiars and such were useful. 
---
It's hard to ignore better things available even if you don't like it. For it also was a decline that was not really sudden but it took long time for me to realise what I felt. Summoning release was though something that I felt bad about on release. I didn't think and do not think it fits with RS Lore. Before everything were basically tied to a medieval setting. Sure spirit animals were a thing but I don't think they were this useful like in RS. Magic is not realistic but magicians were an ingredient in those times even if they were not real. Religion was strong at that time so prayer feels like a good skill too. The release of hunter felt really in line with this setting too.    
---
Im literally shaking and crying rn
---
Oh, how the turntables...
---
You know what could settle all of this?
---
DMM is limited to one account. Seems simple to me.
---
Yeah, when did ankle biters become so popular? It seems every young kid i teach has jeans that i would say needed to be a littler longer. Odd times.
---
No not osrs but runescape back in the day when we could sit down to recover our stamina way back in 2009 or 2019. Not talking about rs3.
---
You don't know how glad I am to see these two comments. Before the DQ, there was a multitude of comments complaining about torvesta's "alt" account. Torvesta's argument is that clans are just as worse as mules as a way to cover up what he did was wrong. A rule is a rule and he broke it.
---
How do you propose they "fix" dmm? Ban all teaming or have people just lose the items in their inventory?
---
Lol if thats what helps you here, then go ahead and believe it
---
Np lol it‚Äôs been posted often recently I think an update triggered it to turn on or something.
---
No, we had dungeoneering though.
---
Or we could enjoy both without making a comparison
---
I really don't get why the mobile client gets so much optimization but sitting here and desktop client has so many optimization issues  (talking about the stuff largely behind the client backend etc, not like runelite vs regular client)
---
But I mean obviously I know why since they actually have a Mobile team and its brought it so many players but yet they ignore poor desktop =(
---
The jmod meant that you can have a second account that you play to get items then give those items to your main, not that you have a second account standing in g.e with your bank. 
---
I will, considering you showed you'd rather make a fool of yourself than to read a wiki article. That you were already reading. It's only 4:18 PM I can continue this for a while.
---
My life tip to you is next time just read a few scrolls further. You'll learn a lot more about the game, or in life in general, and it'll help you out a lot in the long run. Or continue doing the Cunningham thing if you want. It's shameful, but it's your prerogative.
---
Unfortunately this sub isn‚Äôt used to logic being used in situations and therefore won‚Äôt understand your flawless point that you prove.

No ones gonna help you. Read the rules dipshit.
---
I'm surprised free tovesta isnt on it yet
---
Good theory. Although most game developers generally kind of suck. Jagex is actually pretty good imo. The players are the ones who suck because we have a player base that tries as best they can to not pay for members and then bitch about shitty quality updates. They rush things and fuck up because people see $11 a month and lose their shit.
---
That twisted bow spawn was definitely intentional though. Someone definitely cashed out and screwed some gold buyers over.

You know what they say about guys with long thumbs...

Isn't that what Torv got in trouble for in the first place?
---
Congrats bro. Defo get that mage switch for next time, most of your damage at Zulrah will be with mage usually 
---
He didnt ‚Äùhave to‚Äù pay jack shit. He did it because he‚Äôs a good guy that works for a garbage company.
---

---
Can we copystrike Jagex?
---
Throw in 75 rc and I‚Äôll vote yes 
---
I don't mind it in principle. I think for a lot of them it makes sense that you would need the reputation as well as the physical ability to make the shortcut. It seems appropriate for example that Hassan isn't too happy with you vaulting through his palace windows, but once you're the hottest shit in Al Kharid he'd probably let it slide. 
---
Agree and imo maybe we should train some devs like Keiren to work on engine and get some less op updates
---

Is the recovery system really that bad? I thought you needed a lot more info than that, I assume most people complaining got pwned or phished or something.

Not too shabby.

It's a competitive pvp mode and the most effective way to pk and survive is to pk with a clan. If you like competitive pvp and want 1v1's then you should wait for a 1v1 pvp tournament.

---
Torvesta is a vintage roadman 
---
looks like the pkers took down another whiny Ironman lmao
---
That knowledge is currently common, and or is going to inevitably spread to the unbeknownst. What should be stated however is that RWT is **ILLEGAL** and you **WILL** get banned. If you want to pay for GP, mind as well go for the safe route. 
---
Why is sparc mac worried
---
They're sure as hell more oldschool than justiciar armour though
---
very true, and not because torvesta was banned but because runescape pking is a joke
---
just play rs3 if you want generic mmo pve endgame content
---
And positive shit, and any shit at all really

To be honest i'm no expert and I may be using some terms incorrectly. PID means Player ID  and as far as I know its just how the UI interacts with a character, in some sense. You'll generally hear it used to describe which player the system preferences first, often due to ping related issues. My understanding of what happens in this situation is that when you use vengeance it stalls your characters animation, as it takes some 3-4 game ticks to complete. This means that your sprite, or character model is casting vengeance for about 1.5 seconds, however the game actually only counts it for 1 tick or 0.66 seconds, so while your character is doing the animation, it can do something else which wont show. You can see a good example of this if you look up a dragon claw rushing video, particularly the ones in max strength in the wildy. They will veng up then click on a player to attack, the animation happens then it looks like they fly at 4x speed and surprise attack the enemy. Whats happening is that your character is stuck doing an animation, but the system actually thinks you're running at normal speed. The way this links to the lure is through animation stalling, which I don't understand 100%. As best I can tell, if you do 2 or more actions in the same tick as the veng cast, it will take priority over the other animations, cancelling them. So you veng in a safe zone, run into a PVP zone, pray mage pray smite. The result is that you cancel the stalled animation of your character running after the veng, but your character actually did run to the new square. Now the system, or your Player ID is in a PVP zone but the animation that made your character move was cancelled, leaving your model in the same place. When they trade you it looks like theyre in a safe zone except they actually aren't, so your character runs after them. I hope this made sense, happy to clarify anything that doesn't

---
Whoops ye, missed that part when I was reading it, sorry. I still would like to see more differentiating it though. 
---
I don't see Jagex bothering with it unless they feel it can be marketed well. The reason they've kept DMM on this long is because it's just there to promote the game and Mat K says that their metrics says it drives subs. A well organised, well thought-out and watchable pking tournament would do really well for the game because most devs see esports as a marketing vehicle and a PvP tournament would be no exception to it, so stuff like watchability needs to be considered. Though that said, DMM isn't a great starting point for watchability so I guess the only way is up. 
---
I want to see it happen but I don't want to see it half-assed and boring so Jagex go "Oh well this didn't work guess we'll never do it again".
---
Someone stole my idea?!
---
Glad to hear it! We enjoy seeing fresh faces!
---
Much appreciated! We enjoy helping out. Gives more of a purpose to the endless grind!
---
runelite notification ruined my nostalgic immersion smh
---
More practical doesn't mean it's not already practical. The 'again' was also referring to the void elite update making it more useful than it previously was. This would make it 1 step better. 
---
From my own experience, mainly slayer bossing and gwd, I've only used my void a couple of times. I'd love to use it more often and this would reduce switches which would be wonderful.
---
My wording must've been off but I do realise void is a very useful setup already so my apologies :) 
---
The thing u people dont realize is that torvesta was muling and solomission isnt. Torvesta broke the rules, not solomission. So technically the ban is 100% fair, but on the other hand I dont get why they have that rule in place.
---
the guy looks like a spud

Yeah, people overhyped me waaay too much haha. I'm still surprised more than 10 people actually still up vote them

I haven't played DMM since season one, but this actually makes it look great. I miss proper clanning, it's one of the best things in this game, even if had has gotten quite toxic.

Thank you! I will still keep uploading even if I'm at negative karma on posts, I don't care what people like that guy think

Bro keep trying you‚Äôll get it! Make sure you only go off sound for the first hit if you can‚Äôt see him! Otherwise you can see him either stomp (ranged) or go on his hind legs (Mage). Once you do this and the healers spawn, just click on one while concentrating on his movements. Repeat this for up to 4 healers (I left two cause I had blowpipe and 96 ranged). Then continue attacking jad while concentrating prayer flicks again. It takes like an hour to do, if you have the time, just keep trying you‚Äôll get it man! GL!

To add to the other reply, he used an alt to make money because he could not keep up with the clans that farm items and feed them all to certain individuals. He was one of the few prominent soloers. Now it's truly clanmanmode

Only if the said essence is untradable
---
I'd vote for it if it was a toggle on/off for being able to hear everyone. Also would need to have a range around your player, same range as the text chat.

Considering a small percentage even use the public text chat, I imagine a very small number of people would be on vc.

Thought I'd be safe to show that. Literally did one quick lap before I started work. Best decision ever

UPDATE THE CALENDAR
---
Not everyone has the time because of jobs family etc, huge part of osrs playerbase are the ones that played this game 10-15 years ago when they were kids and now they want to play the game with good items and want to level fast its easy way out to buy bonds to maintain the costs of items/supplies that you cannot get normally cause the lack of time.
---
boaty number xDDDD
---
what do these links do? Do they prompt you to enter your details to get the double XP?
---
You're right but you're just going to get down voted by people that barely play the game so the notion of playing with other people as a group is mind boggling to them.
---
I think you should prioritise other things ahead of a Falador Elite. It doesn't really give you much at all. IMO, if you really wanted to be efficient, I'd PVM for a while and get the bank for Lava rune method to whatever RC you want. Its worth it in the long run. However, the extra blood runes is nice yeah but not totally necessary. 
---

The one that perplexes me is the Shilo Village river shortcut that requires an elite diary no less. What is the point of it? It's not for getting to Duradel from the gem mine because that's obsolete by that point. Is it for the sand pit? But there's way better sand pits for far less the requirements. I couldn't see anything else in Shilo Village that makes that shortcut useful.

Well this sub is actually awful. So i can see why they wouldn't bother.
---
That‚Äôs the way it is, but that‚Äôs not the way it should be. 
---
"everyone's most enjoyable times" ü§î
---
Pretty sure late 2007 or 2008 is when the game went downhill super fast

Thank you for this feeling. Will get me through the day.
---
just asking a question here, no need for toxicity.
---
He's a rule breaking scumbag, who has muled in past tournaments as well.
---
He also refuses to admit that he broke the rules and instead flame Jagex in a video to get the heat off him and onto Jagex. This is an extremely immature way to handle the situation, and this brainlet community just eats it up, and starts parroting back the bullshit "but a jmod said i could break the rules" story.
---
I don‚Äôt want to be a buzz killer or a dick but you do realize that 1 hour of real life work could give you 1-2 months of membership. (Of course depending on your wages) 
---
And to earn enough gp in game for 1 month which is 2 bonds make take you 4-7 hours? Depending on your method. 
---
Yeah, it's a really powerful strategy, and perfectly valid and tp be expected in a PvP everywhere tournament
---
If your parents are that autistic maybe they should be the ones playing
---
1v1 NH bridding*
---
ye but even if Mod Roq knew him, why would anyone, even if it's teh creator of jagex, ask you to go Skulled in a pvp area with ur whole bank???
---
The hive mind has decided they love Torvesta and that he can do no wrong. So they are perfectly okay with someone breaking the rules as long as its someone they worship like sheep.
---
Nah if you ask around people generally say 2010-pre EoC. They only did 2007 servers because that wat the latest full backup they had of the game
---
Why would you have torags is the real question
---
I propose DIM Dead Ironman Mode 
---
Yeah it was acceptable in classic. Look at the exp rates for agility in classic.
---
Cringe 
---
Eh, when I was in a clan the purpose was to have a good and reliable community of people who played together both in the wilderness and the rest of the game.
---
The again ours was a hybrid clan of both skillers and pkers, but I think we ended up with more skillers than pkers.
---
We were one of the top 10 warring clans in 05, though.
---
How do you limit trading in a pvp mode? You can't kill other players for bis gear? In a pvp gamemode. It's not fucking happening mate. Trading / pking for full loot has to remain in DMM
---
My friends are from rsc or rs2 beta days. I started shortly after rsc release. 
---
nah the best was *****
---
Nice try, but you won't keep me from finishing my achievement diaries.
---
Should nerf Graceful and make Agility scaling better...crazy how 50 agil and Graceful is the same energy regen as 99...
---
Did you have auto retaliate on?
---
ü¶Äthis sub is customer support ü¶Ä
---
If they get access to your email, they can disable 2FA. What are you saying?
---
Heaven*
---
I'm not trying to shift blame.  I keep seeing people post about clan banks but I feel like if they were a thing they would be getting caught.  I don't think clans would risk losing a clan bank when it's easy to regear off other members.  Some people in the clan doing well can just cover the deaths of others without needing to hoard items in a safe zone.
---
No one is disputing the fact that rules were broken, it's the fact that he's been singled out and that 90% of dmm players are also breaking the rules
---
Castle Wars. 
---
What? This game is designed take forever to max out and etc. Playing 30-60 mins a day is horrible progress. Not even remotely close to "meaningful progress". 
---
Big part of why it's hard for me to get back into OSRS is because if I don't spend majority of my free time playing it, my progress is no where close to where I'd like it to be. 
---
cheers u2 bud
---
Have 76 slayer already because it wasn't going to be kurask alt first. But how much better money they are than kurasks? Because kurask with bones to peaches, herbsack and agility for shortcuts are fine for 1h afk and less than minute to get back. Also I'm only one there so no competition. 
---
I fell for a phishing scam and just bought my gold back through bonds. A wholesome way of rebounding from unfortunate circumstances
---
This guys a moron, flaming Ash when he has nothing to do it and doesn't want to undermine his colleagues.
---
If you say so
---
lmao
---
Bonds are mtx.
---
Don‚Äôt you remember when they did this?
---
Ok! Should I jump over this ditch here?
---
Gr8 post m8
---
yeah must be annoying to have people flaming you in the official customer support client
---
Nice name
---
Its one of many many post where they have repeated attacks on jmods for not doing "this " or "that" 
---
Its disgusting and completely justifies why it is so hard to get help. While there are people that need it, rather than being able to help them, he has to respond to ignorant players like this.
---
It‚Äôs a fair bit more gp. Gargs you can just Guthans full afk no food and make more. 
---
Regardless of your opinion on the matter this is epic
---
Zaros GWD as Raids 3? Maybe a redesigned Nex fight and properly balanced T75 Nex Armors.
---
Could work honestly.
---
Did they disable your 2FA?
---
Nope that's only for inferno
---
Got me chucklin quite nicely 
---
What the hell was he doing outside??? #FreeTorvesta #keephiminside 
---
Every use case I have observed thus far has been an objective performance improvement across the board with the exception of Mushroom Meadow. If you make the draw distance the same, it's much better. 
---
Yeah they tend to fluctuate a lot throughout the year
---
That sucks 
---
It is about buying them with real life money "for GP" means they bought it with real life money to get GP on their account. If it was "with GP" it would be as you described it. The former also makes contextual sense with the rest of the image whereas the latter doesn't at all.
---
"to stand any chance at winning in this gamemode trying to be an esport, you need to be unemployed or have a week off of work, and be the best of a team of 15+ players that are willing to funnel their wealth into you"
---
Ok friend. 
---
Clans locking down areas is arguably legitimate play, so that's fine. But wealth transferring is not.
---
Yeah only req is 86 + stew
---
Hard to confirm but Ive noticed low yields while using ultra compost(in bottomless bucket) and attas seed as well.
---
I fuckin wish I had these moves
---
I like barrows because I have a gambling problem
---
I have never played cw, idk üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And its also closer to next Thursday 
---
I haven't done them ever, slow task for main. Maybe finally it's time to go and check them, always have known that they are popular money maker
---
If I could slay dragons for 1 hour in real life and earn a month worth of membership then count me in. Otherwise I'll stick to earning gold in games to buy bonds. 3+ hours ingame &gt; 1 hour irl work
---
I was trying to highlight the last part of that sentence specifically, ahk is still allowed for remapping keys, which is what the commenter before you said.
---
I had an excellent trial mentor today, was actually enthusiastic to teach
---
I agree so much. Campaign with me to get mod Atlas to fix it. He's said so himself it would be pretty simple to change. 
---
thanks
---
Hi Shaking, I'm Nick.
---
Why is that crab combined with the music so satisfying? I can never get tired of it.
---
Is there any way to determine what level a seed box is? Easy/medium/hard? I have a bunch stockpiled and want to test the average loot of each.
---
It's missing because they don't want to spend 30 minutes sifting through questions about DMM rules and torvesta
---
ü¶Ä jmods won't respond ü¶Ä
---
&lt;div&gt;The joke&lt;/div&gt;
---
Mouse input mainly. Frame presentation is smoother as well. It's very slight though. 
---
Tbf, how do you know Jagex aren't also banning them? 
---
Listen bro. You kill me a dragon irl and I‚Äôll buy you members for a year. 
---
Upvoting so more people don't have to suffer this 
---
Do you have a job? Or go to school? Do you want your boss/teacher to take every mistake you make and announce it over the loud speakers? Especially when mistake is, in your words, "heavily debatable" as it is here?
---
Irrationally emotional responses don't merit a response at all and it has nothing to do with how much the employees care about the game.
---
If you think we deserve good customer support then they in turn deserve people to not ask for their heads on a literal spike. They're humans too, even if you're paying a subscription for the game.
---
Please explain to me how saying "don't get cleaned!" Is malicious? If one would say "I hope you get cleaned!" i understand being angry. but I fail to see the harm in just giving someone a friendly warning/reminder. Unless you think everything and everyone is after you idk why this should trigger someone ...
---
We are concentrated autism but we are somehow still more competent than the real jagex support 
---
100% agree, I imagine one day we will lose Ash because he'll be fed up of the shit he gets so things he isn't even involved in, we don't deserve him.
---
Can't expect to be teleported 10 tiles in a single second from the O.G. spawn during threats of forced suicide and expect to survive. CLearly a bug, and I desrve to be reimbursed 
---
I don't think he has. Even 144HZ is a world of difference and I'd never go back. 
---
This comment has inflicted the European Union's Article 11 and Article 13 copyright laws and has been hidden.

Have you ever thought that rather than showing us what these new skills can be like warding you could add the items and such to an unrestricted world so players could actually try them out?
---
they should also make training agility locked by getting 99 runecraft and smithing
---
That is a flaw in the statement, but they were in a difficult spot. They wanted to remove computer-augmented inputs, but without completely removing accessibility tools for disabled players.
---
But so is black mask (I), which is his point

Altscape

Also when 200 people mass up one guy is gunna leak so theyre prepared. They also have scouts at the karajama entrances.

Even though he won‚Äôt be unbanned because he is a popular player I feel like the only reason he was singled out was because he is a popular player 
---
deadmode man

didnt happen

restart account if you mess up
---
I agree but those things don't mix. Get one or more high Hz and one or more IPS 60hz. 
---
Start by painting them brown.
---
It gets better and it‚Äôs so much faster/easier on mobile tbh 
---
!invest 100%
---
Use osrs.wiki
---
A +1 max hit is extremely strong, prims, torture, tassets (or obby legs) are extremely expensive for that +1, and that's melee.  Ranged max hits are more impactful.  And 70 ranged 50 agility is extremely easy to obtain, so there is no sense in pretending that is a restriction
---
Haha!
---
Heh I know he‚Äôs ranging right now, thanks for the account 
---
Is that 1440p or 1080? 1080 144hz are usually a little over 200 USD. 
---
no because its a knife not a range weapon
---
Almost like no one would need gols sellers if bonds were cheaper
---
I have a multi hundred mills bank on my main that I dont play anymore. Not using that money for bonds for my ironman and paying with IRL money would be completely stupid.
---
There are situations where paying with ingame gold for p2p is most efficient. Your situation isnt everyone's.
---
OOTL, why did Torvesta get dq'ed from Deadman?
---
What I mean is getting to max is not the goal of the game, and 10 xp is always 10 xp, you don't get punished for not levelling quick enough.
---
For sure, of course this was before farming I think, and obviously before Snape grass seeds, since those are relatively new.
---
But I do feel similarly, right now if I'm not doing my demonic gorillas on task I feel like I'm wasting so much money, but it takes sooo long 
---
I think that sounds like a good idea. You got my poll vote! 
---
Tf is that thumb lol
---
Good point. Updooted for visibility.

Am i the only plebeian who uses bonds for membership?!
---
PC master race.
---
Logic isnt your forte.
---
I‚Äôd buy torvesta for a night for 11$
---
PvP bad
---
The best part about Torvestas situation is at least we get good memes out of it
---
Yes, in a game filled with RNG chances, we should assume that since it‚Äôs rare, it‚Äôll never happen.
---
If you‚Äôre getting a key every 30 min, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. I was able to get 6 keys an hour when I farmed it a few years back.
---
You have a mighty bad RAT then, or you‚Äôre installing the same rat every time 
---
That depends on how much of the GPU it uses on its host device. I believe the iPad Pro has one that wouldn't be 100% used, even at 120FPS. See how the FPS is essentially clamped to the ceiling? 
---
Could someone swap this meme for those of is that finished elite desert diary without 86 agility? I‚Äôm really tired of using summer pies.
---
Luckily IRL has a good damage and accuracy booster when punching men! I‚Äôm pretty sure you can hit in the 100s even with a steel dagger, so it should go quick!

Yeah speak for yourself. If I get attacked in the wild while playing on my Ironman, the whole time the pker and his 6 buddies call me the n word and tell me how sad I am. 
---
I usually only answer if they ask me how many chins I have
---
He's saying the game becomes fun before end game, and I think most of us agree.
---
Hopefully will get him in the current run 
---
In any survival game where only one person wins, people team up lol. Its just the best thing to do. Any ‚Äúhunger games‚Äù type movie, people team up. Teaming up to get the best chances later is be best choice. Compete with 2000 people vs potentially 100 other from this clan. Its simple math. 
---
Now apply the same standards for account security. 
---
Already know spawn locs thank though mate
---
Yes, I'd like to invest some imaginary points in this post, thank you.
---
Yeah I force rotation 2, for jad spawn at SE
---
I'd disagree, progression only really benefits a very small, very specific section of the player base: sweaty neets who do nothing but play all day long. As a casual player (which, by definition, the majority of players are), it can be quite disheartening to see end game gear and activites which you are working towards be replaced in usefulness/relevance by practically unobtainable items/activities. While I appreciate that high end players also need things to do, I feel that they are disproportionately catered towards as they tend to be overwhelmingly vocal in their opinions due to their time investment in the game.
---
Lol you fucked someone over 
---
That is nice dude thank you
---
Well I guess not 
---
Does runelite still have that?
---
I tried to look for it but couldn't find it

His jacket looks like the inside of Taco Bell in 1999

Is it possible to get a 3840*2160 version? (4k screen)
---
Fun probably 
---
Yeah I was so close this time. Will get it for sure the next time.
---
I once got lured. Lost my entire bank, which at the time was a mithril chainbody and an addy med helm. People out there can be cruel. It's a wild wasteland, I'll tell you hwhat.
---
My friend bought bonds, levelled up as quick as possible to max combat in NMZ and then quit because he thought it was boring being maxed.
---
It's like softcore organized crime yes
---
You don't deserve anything. Be smarter and don't get lured.
---
You should use konar, chaeldar gives far shittier tasks. And location shouldn't matter too much at your level.
---
Wooooow the Nostalgia 
---
You do still realize jagex gets more money that way...
---
Q
---
Then the biggest clan wins because they can just camp quest areas with more people. Gl going through a quest dialogue 1v200 or getting pid on an npc. 
---
You can start by formatting your reddit posts better.
---
Im sure this happens 100% of the time.
---
Its weird how ive never been called at racial slurs doing clues or PvMing in the wildy, and rarely if ever pking.

Monkey nuts on your forehead

"All shortcuts" You're being a hypocrite by not using your brain.

"There are ways to give diaries incentives without making all shortcuts require them"

Got any ideas?

How did you swap your RS3 bank for OSRS gold?

Lol who gets mad at people for buying bonds 
---
Punch kids in churches and monasteries since there‚Äôs an altar there so you‚Äôre practically invincible 
---
i hate liberals
---
Actually if bonds (and membership) was cheaper, there would be an oversupply of bonds like in December (as low as 2.8m) compared to today 3.8m.
---
Ultimately, it is Runescape gold converted to "membership" vs "real life currency".
---
To Venuzuelans, real life currency, even if the have to pay twice as much gold vs the price of a bond, is worth so much more to them.
---
We aren‚Äôt being paid ¬£11 to not give a fuck 
---
expected but not disappointed 
---
It doesnt seem like that much of a restriction.
---
Yeah. Just do a 2048 man bracket with max gear max stats. Best pvper wins (rng aside). Everyone gets a fair chance, everyone doesnt have to take a week off work, etc. plus the 1v1s are more exciting to watch. Rotate between multi wars. Then rotate between pure, rune pures and main builds.

So you couldn't go ask your neighbor "hey I'll mow your lawn for $5 so I can buy runescape gold"   
---
Maybe it's a NA thing, extremely common here for kids to mow peoples lawns during the summer for some extra cash.

I bought bonds once to help pay for a bandos chestplate. I just really hated Barbarian Assault, and did not want to grind for the torso.

This would actually be pretty sweet

I'm confused. No one was saying he should be unbanned, it would always be too late. People are just saying that if he gets a ban then clans need to be banned too since he is just doing what they are solo.
---
It‚Äôs retarded because bondmanmode.

Make an Ironman today.

&gt; I‚Äôm just upset he was disqualified
---
&gt; You seem to be more bothered by this than I am

Lmao, have a nice day stranger
---
Would I get time to prep? If so then I believe I could win.
---
Get rid of it. What other "esport" has people compete for a week straight putting in at least 12+ hours a day to even have a chance? Combined with that every DMM has some sort of drama. At this point I've seen enough and won't bother watching the finals 
---
Have you had a stroke recently?
---
Hot topic, Jagex needs to take a firm stance or not take one at all really. Singling people out like this will not do anything good for them.
---
If you have ardy cloak 1 you can also tp close to an altar and run back depending on what you're saying
---
It's impossible to eliminate clans from DMM

&gt;No one was saying he should be unbanned

Nah, it's not ridiculous. 
---
It's pretty dang cool to watch and compete in, clans trying to lock down certain areas, racing to complete quests ahead of that in my own smaller clan, etc. 
---
Just b/c it's a Free For All doesn't mean you can't team up or form alliances.

Well this specific case is a lot of work for a small qol

Yeah I think you have to talk to Daero again before getting the instructions to do the puzzle

Dude wtf you just saved me, asked for spade and got it in less than 5 mins, didn‚Äôt even want money for it

So who's scamming who, are you gonna get the tattoo first, or do you want the tbow first
---
Ahhh, sounds like I should just leave it alone and keep it on RS3. Not a fan of getting scammed. Thanks for the info though!
---
Supposed to be gr8 b8 m8
---
I dont think the consensus was that muling isnt a bannable offense, it's that other people (including solo mission from what I've seen) are ALSO muling and have not been banned 
---
Youre right. Dont mule, dont swap, dont box. Unless youre a massive clan leader getting fed by all the mules, swappers, and boxers. 
---
As for a route to take in mems, look into getting barrows gloves, should keep you busy for a awhile and get a bunch of quests and stats out of the way
---
Ok, thank you. I figured I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong but he went all out lol. ‚ÄúHahaha, dead account!‚Äù And logged out üòÇ.

Some dark humor, i like it.

Rune knives is not a ranged weapon? ;) 
---
Who you 
---
Need fancy font, sorry 
---
&gt;Lol... No no no no. The mistake is not heavily debatable.
---
I mean, it is debatable, and there's discussion going on aplenty about it. Afaik up to this point the only thing the alt has done *this season* is accept gp from the main and flip. And guess what, this wouldn't be the first time a big streamer did something like throw extra money at the alt off stream. Shit, half of torv's video about this was him complaining about AHK abuse and raggers. Sure, those are issues, but that just eeks of deflecting the light away from what actually happened.
---
&gt;About mistakes... Yes. Shunning mistakes is a great way to push people to learn from and not make mistakes. 
---
Ermm... no, it's not, it's a good way to get less people on the customer service team that already sees a bunch of artists screaming at them for following their boss's orders. Not sure what world of assholes you grew up in.
---
&gt;And if we had good customer support then none of these issues would even be issues in the first place. Which is kind of the broad argument with the entire ü¶Ä meme. 
---
That's a pretty good way to deflect from the fact that if you treat people like shit you shouldn't expect different in return.
---
&gt;Keep it together, man(or ma'am) it's a simple discussion. 
---
Coming from the one behaving like a momcut yelling for the manager lol
---
Now this meme has evolved to peak quality
---
You might as well just start a new account a this point
---
&gt; Except none of those people are doing the planning, strategizing, or coordinating of others.
---
No shit, obviously the leaders are doing the planning, strategizing, and coordinating. 
---
&gt; They're going and doing what they are told to do
---
What on earth did you expect?
---
For every single player to make their own strategies independent of whatever alliance they are in, forming a massive cluster fuck? 
---
Who is that jacob dude could he fuck off? Ty forcefully euthanized etc
---
You might as well just start a new account at this point
---
As a liberal I cannot help but feel btfo just from this statement 
---
What does the 'yikes' have to do with it? Plus that basically asserts OP was more worried than trying to bash... And well yeah maybe it does. One can always ask. 
---
I agree with OP that the dude lost his shit about nothing. Just someone going like "Yikes! Make sure you do not get cleaned!" Again, please explain to me why that should trigger someone. I fail to see why this is offensive or in any way meant to be offensive. I actually see it as supportive by reminding someone to be careful. Unless they got major anger issues idk why one would get so worked up about it.
---
I'm all for this new meme format but let's not overdo it lads
---
Full obsidian, obsidian stabby and neck. You could switch to dh once you get to 80-85hp but it's not really necessary.
---
I think they should just not make people do quests, but have them gradually unlock as the week progresses 
---
i highly recommend watching People Just Do Nothing on netflix
---
&lt;3
---
You cannot rest when enemies are nearby
---
Oh is it ?  Which phone are you using ? Thought you messed with the code to make it go to 120fps. 
---
No, but the number of players breaking the rules without penalty is large enough that having one person with community recognition get banned brings a large amount of attention, and rightly so. DMM is a total joke every year and for a large part of the community the only enjoyment they were getting this year was watching someone who isn't a clan brainlet try and compete, after allegedly receiving the OK from a jmod or other jagex employee to use multiple accounts to hold items and use GE. I usually side with Jagex when they fuck up but this was a truly moronic move that for a sizable chunk of the hardcore OSRS fanbase has cemented the idea of DMM being a shitshow every year, and that instead of trying to have fun with it they will ignore it as most players do until it changes for the better or is dropped completely.
---
If they want it to be a 1v1 tournament, they need to make it work as a 1v1 tournament.
---
If they want it to be a clan vs clan tournament, they need to brand it as such.
---
Right now it's branded as a solo tournament but is actually a complete free for all with selective rule enforcement on solo players who are trying to get the same advantages as clans.
---
For example, clans have lower ranked members serving as item farmers, mules, and quest zone controllers, all of which have no intention of attempting to win the tournament but have a guaranteed stake in the winnings if their clan makes it into the prize pool. 
---
Yeah, Tassets is too much to buy with bonds. I just checked how Bandos chestplate would affect my max hit. Slayer helm on task doesn't give an extra max hit (31 -&gt; 31) even with Tassets too, but if I'm using Neitiznot it does (27 -&gt; 28).
---
But the main reason for Bandos would be the extra defense, since obsidian armor is pretty fragile. Slight prayer bonus could be nice too.
---
(And it looks cool :p)
---
Yeah but with actual gear and not just naked people whacking each other
---
Just me or Torvy got a big ass head
---
less and less respect for this fatty as of late
---
this isn't even runescape
---
post this shit somewhere else
---
No scam here, Would literally record it llf. But the odds of someone doing this is .0001% 
---
DWH or BGS for Vork? I know Vork has a higher crush defense, but the DWH seems like it will still be more effective.
---
I did the same. I had 50m on a level 3 when I started osrs. Felt weird for sure 
---
Hahaha deze comment is geplaatst door de Lunagang-gang
---
&gt; What a shit game mode. 
---
What a great gamemode. This shit is dope to watch and fun to play, even if the clan I play with is only ~7 men. 
---
I love watching epic wars between clans as they try to lock down certain areas and get cleared by other clans, or have players sneak pas them, etc. 
---
&gt; You shouldn‚Äôt be forced to play with a clan but clearly you have to or else you can‚Äôt progress? 
---
Why not? Just b/c it's a Free For All doesn't mean you can't form alliances or teams to take on other groups. 
---
It's realistic and super fucking fun. 
---
&gt; Garbage and I pity the people who play dmm
---
I pity you for thinking we give a shit about your opinion. 
---
LMFAO imagine being afraid of a bunch of RuneScape players.
---
What?!
---
God how scary it must be to know that you have a clan of sweaty nerds who live on a videogame coming after you irl. I would be absolutely terrified.
---
yeah u right. man i hate clans :/ just pk solo you fucking pussies
---
Nope, the screen is 120hz on the Ipad Pro (2018). All i did was ::displayfps.
---
Not if you 'stab' with them
---
You legit just called yourself dumb, 99% of your posts are here lol
---
That really makes no sense but ok. You clearly are more bothered by the subreddit defending him than I am upset that he was dq'ed. My statement remains true. Have a nice day stranger.
---
Yeah, just like I think the vast majority of skilling looks legitimately stupid, but some people love it. 
---
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean their aren't a fuck-ton of people that do.
---
Reddit is very non-Pvper centric, so your comment will be upvoted a bunch. 
---
But this is a ton of fun for a lot of people. 
---
if hes a content dev and nothing else , he shouldnt be commenting then. We all know hes more than that, stfu 
---
11 husband points a month for THIS?
---
I don't think anybody realistically expects him to be unbanned at this point it would be pointless.
---
It's the way Jagex behaved towards him that matters and they've shot themselves in the foot during an already tiring pvp competition /PR campaign format.
---
They could have communicated directly with Torvesta or the community as a whole if they considered his alt "wasn't risking enough" and expanded the guidelines on what are considered legitimate and illegitimate account types and uses during DMM.
---
Imagine just wanting to do the quest and enter that cave as a solo player
---
Haven‚Äôt played since I was a kid, but Twitch Prime gave me 2 weeks of membership so I decided to try and play this game again.  I decided to play an Ironman as I wanted to focus on the environment more than the MMO part of the game.  I completed all the f2p quests and a fair number of the member quests, getting 40 across the melee stats and training my magic to 37.  I‚Äôm running into the issue of money.  Early on, I completed the stronghold of security, got a couple lucky drops for gold.  I know that I could go to the wilderness and pick up the steel plate bodies or steel plate legs, or go to a pvp world and pick up loot for money, but these methods feel like they‚Äôd be breaking the spirit of the game for me.  Are there any enemies I could be killing or skills that I could be leveling that would make me a decent amount of cash? 
---
\&gt;A billington
---
Yes.
---
Almost done with mort hard. It was one surprise after another discovering I didn't have a handful of skills at the right level for the required quests. I still have hard trekking and Kings Ransom (I think) left. Then barrows for days.
---
Xil until you earn a defender. The accuracy bonus is too good.
---
My friend loaned me his DHCB while he is out of town for the next month or so. I‚Äôm milking it for all I got. 
---
I‚Äôm really having trouble deciding if I want Rigour or DHCB first. I feel like i‚Äôll be so incredibly bored by 130m from vork i‚Äôll want to move on (especially since i‚Äôm already using DHCB)
---
He really owned you with facts and logic
---
Item you protect when skulled
---
em[ty
---
God Ash at it again.
---
Rune HQ is still active, sadly its slow AF now.
---
Dead man mode should be changed to dead Iron mode
---
What would you suggest ? 
---
Pipe down for once
---
I Guess passion for game and job but without a sense of responsibilities is no different from wasting your time
---
Yeah, grinding slayer to get cash to get gear to go bossing. Or a credit card, I guess. 
---
Should be 1v1 all the way through with no multi at all 
---
impressive, especially since the game has been out for around 6 years
---
L m f a o, that's the only place in the wilderness I don't expect to get pked. Everyone just walks past you, no reason to risk anything.
---
I had a guy kill me at altar for ~700k in superior bones. Before I died I dropped a "gg" and he was still there when I got back. 
---
He left all my loot on the ground and protected me while we chatted for a good hour or so. I think it was just a relief for him to not deal with salty people 
---
Skill pets &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wildly/slayer pets. Ya I said it. 
---
But congrats op you have a nice collection 
---
Bring it the fuck on lmao
---
What happened? Some details of the lure?
---
Since they're reworking clue rewards they should add Crab armor. Someone must have suggested it.
---
This is definitely a repost, I remember it from a couple years back.
---
good god are you spoiled 
---
If that was the case, streamers would be dying 50% of the time to inexperienced PKers. That's not the case, I've seen PKers get 40+ kill streaks simply because they have more skill.
---
I didnt even know drop notifications could BE disabled
---
Where is the option??
---
Where can i buy that luck?
---
Not lucky, hejust isn't oozing confirmation bias
---
Just hop noob 4Head
---
Bond baby spotted
---
Nobody's mad at you. They're just calling you a noob because you're a noob.
---
Yes hehe. I wanted the karma. It is my post. Check my top rated posts.
---
30 days average for a month..thats just over 3 hours a day. There are people who play 15 hours a day..so yes these autists that play def do. 
---
Huh that‚Äôs good to know, I‚Äôm almost certain it wasn‚Äôt like that before but I could be wrong 
---
To get to the other side
---
Hahaha yeah.
---
Anyways, never post here again
---
&gt; has like 50 karma and has been around 55 days on Reddit
---
&gt; Calls me a noob
---
üòÇ 
---
RS3 has had a couple good updates and ideas, people just dislike the MXT and easyscape updates that plague RS3, along with a severe imbalance of new weapons/items being introduced.
---
"a discussion" "politely telling them they're idea is flawed".... "piss off dickhead" alright buddy. 
---
You have to pleasure god ash
---
True, only time I use it now are for clues which are on the monk island.
---
k? doesnt even make sense 
---
RuneScape has all the makings of an esports game with it's pking (not in the current meta mind you, but), however with the level of commitment jagex gives to pvp it'll never have one, for sure. 
---
if it were up to me i would rush to buy my own dhcb and farm vorkath efficiently for 18-20 hours for rigour, rigour is just so overpowered its worth the 20 extra hours spent to get it. As for the dhcb, it doesnt lose its value so you can sell it and buy it back when you need
---
I‚Äôd rather have #MuleManMode than #ClanManMode
---
You really got me there for a second. I was like "Oh fuck is jagex gonna do another rollbakc now? I hope I dont get a pet or some shit"
---
nevermind lol
---
It's weird. For some reason, bonds seem like the only form of microtransaction that doesn't piss me off.
---
But the complaint isn't that it's because he's popular. 
---
It's because a jmod already gave him the ok to do what he was doing.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if this comment makes sense or if I‚Äôm just hella high
---
Plus with the revive spell, you have an even less chance of losing your crop.
---
Although if you have the materials you may as well pay for it.
---
I still plant all my magics in falador park with elite diary protection, just in case.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd agree with all this. The main thing to take away is that a) slayer helmet is more cosmetic than it is functional and b) bigger and badder is the bomb. 
---
I guess I need to focus on farming more efficiently. I get pretty bored after an hour or 2 already and I go do some slayer or something. 
---
This week I spent a bunch of hours grinding Elite Void and should have it tomorrow, and I spent my 15m from vork plus 5m from slayer loot all on supplies so I will be set up for a solid vork only weekend. 
---
NHing is not solely RNG based. There are pvp styles being utilized right now that don't depend on RNG
---
Scrap dmm and do full clanmanmode and do full 1v1s from 2000 people. All gear and supps provided. 
---
only botters say this as they have plenty that farms resources that they can sell to buy bonds with 
---
d
---
i love this subreddit
---
Maybe make it reduce your chance of receiving certain random events, but not completely block them.
---
Unfortunately, that won't work as well as you'd think. You could still "trade" wealth between your alts by intentionally dying to your other account. It would make it riskier and less efficient, but it wouldn't stop it.
---
Telos also has the enrage mechanic, which makes streaking even more difficult. 
---
Theres a menu in the setting that looks like a guy with a chat bubble and in that menu there is a lightbulb for notifications.
---
agility pyramid is your best bet for money on a low level ironmeme
---
Sounds good, no more discussion and conflicting opinions. Wrap it up boys lets just post pictures of people maxing and ironmen getting loot.
---
What a shocker, people are toxic. Who would have thought that... 
---
The disrespect to WC3 in this comment is painful. 
---
Theiving ardy knights is decent.
---
Believe it or not, DMM gives a lot of marketing to the game, and costs very little to do so. Only clueless people on this sub think that "they're wasting 10 grand every few months for nothing".
---
That could be a possibility for sure in reaction to the last blackout not preemptively to the current one.
---
Safe deposit box homie. If I get fed by a clan (or donated to by fans), I essentially have access to upwards of a hundred safe deposit spaces. That's the grey area.
---
Feelsbad, how much did you lose mate?
---
Lol
---
I put a pinball on the key. Basically just a big ball bearing. Works very well. 
---
&gt;so what's your problem with rushers and tbers
---
if there's no problem with rushers and tbers then there's no problem with raggers.
---
again, any of the people that reply to me, feel free to post your RSN and it'll make sure you'll get consistently rushed every time you step outside of the safezone and tbed after every single fight, with overheads by people camping overbrewed hp.
---
The greatest sacrifices require the strongest wills
---
Meh. Leave him where he is.
---
Not this shit again 
---
The invent lights up res, how did ya miss that lol
---
He's not showing any Dks kills though
---
Which is still part of the game and not against the rules.
---
I‚Äôm more of a armadyl man myself
---
I disagree. Reddit‚Äôs opinion is that the 1v1 fights are the most entertaining as its too hard to see whats going on in multi fights. We are also missing the leaders calling which is what makes sense of the clutter (doesnt help the jagex team uses resizable all the way zoomed out so everything is super small). I think participating in the multi fights is really fun but its negated because rn ur randomly assigned so u dont have ur full team and u dont even get to fully clear an area. but 1v1s are also fun to do. 
---
don't you mean Staking*
---
Yall got to leave ash alone, i dont believe he even had a part of this. 
---
Use Lastpass App. It will autofill the password for you! (Not a fix for the app just a workaround).
---
Nice what kind of planks are those
---
Oh shit you‚Äôre right
---
Just play 9 accounts simotaneously
---
no
---
Jagex has stated that they are going to be making big changes to the gamemode, hopefully they can address some of the issues
---
The name of the song is called Crab Rave and the crabs in these memes are taken from the music video for it. 
---
As far as I know the meme just started when someone added the dancing character over the music video, but I'm not sure if it goes back further
---
It's almost as if watching them play Ironman would be incredibly boring. It's either that or watch a slideshow of a level up screen coupled with the "Yes bois! X level Y skill! Now we can grind Z!".
---
The 1v1s are entertaining because it's down to a limited number of people, a large number being 'osrs celebrities.' If it was all the 2,000 blokes, the opinion would change 
---
Lol r u serious?? Why would i fake this, the only time i put into this was cropping it for your eyes pleasure
---
What is easier for learning and doing consistently for making money? Vorkath or Zulrah? 
---
93 Range and 79 Mage. 79 Def. I probably should do Vorkath, but profit feels slow when I'm using more than half an inventory of Manta Rays after getting hit by every ranged attack from Vorkath. Let alone all the other supplies.
---
I won't lie, sometimes it gets old, but cengineers montages are mostly just a sideshow with a sound effect on each one and I don't know why but I love them.
---
Tbh I dont get how anyone could watch them alone without doing something else and not be bored out of their skulls
---
Swampletics is the one and only exception
---
Litterally after over a decade of playing, this has pisses me off more than anything else on runescape. Torvesta needs to stream during the tournament in protest.
---
Right, it encourages normal law-abiding players to RWT
---
Real talk my RNG is crazy, got a smouldering stone from a hellhound the other day (1/32,000 droprate) and zulrah pet at 75kc
---
&gt;Games don't always have consistent framerates, such as pre-rendered movies have.
---
&gt;[...]
---
&gt;(And yes, this can still happen when OSRS is 50 FPS, as many frames can be skipped due to inconsistency, 60FPS games can easily be experienced as lower framerate than well optimized 30FPS games, when limited to 60FPS)
---
Are you sure this is the case when the game is locked at an easily-achievable framerate, where you're never going to drop below it? For example, OP's 120 fps OSRS, or the default 50 fps. I could see that happening if the game is struggling to hit its goal, but in a game like OSRS where you're easily hitting the cap with no issues, I'm not sure.
---
I agree with everything else you said, but I think you're missing the point (or maybe I am). You're talking about refresh rates, rather than recording videos at a lower framerate than the gameplay.
---
Thats Torvesta's side, we dont know if he had gone past what was given the ok, or if there was a miscommunication, or the jmod simply misspoke. 
---
me pker me think much skill spam ice barrage
---
What a beast
---
It's like ever since ironman mode/streaming it consistently became a thing people forgot that OSRS is an MMO. Its a social game by nature and players will obviously group up for their own benefits. Not sure why they can't see the fun in playing with friends towards one goal. But ya can't be me. 
---
just to hop 14 million times to find 1 dher thats not even maxed
---
Force it upon you?
---
Is this kid serious?
---
the max hit diminishes from 70-75 since it already hits the end game tier.
---
But 50 to 70 is a hugh gap.
---
A whip hits ~3 higher than dragon scimitar, why wouldn't a crystal bow hit higher than a magic shortbow?
---
Nah, it'll affect content creators but not regular players.
---
Not even sure 
---
I'm sure it's not pretty though lol
---
Unfortunately this would mean that all ironmen are required, by law, to be called "Ironperson". A true tragedy.
---
Just rename and change the graphics a little bit so the brainlets vote yes before they realize it's from RS3.
---
(See: Statius warhammer vs Dragon warhammer, anglerfish vs rocktail, Kiln cape vs Inferno cape, Staff of Light vs Staff of the Dead, etc)
---
Jesus that‚Äôs some really good RNG. What was your method for killing him, range?
---
It isn‚Äôt
---
I mean I ain't gonna complain tho
---
No, the god cape doesn't give you a max hit (it's only a 2% dmg increase) and magic accuracy doesn't really matter for barrows.
---
Yes it's worth it to do even without Mort hards since the gear is still good and runes are almost enough to sustain you afaik
---
All black ink entirely covering testicles. 
---
Been saying and doing this since after the first one
---
üëΩ
---
Thanks this helped a lot! 
---
Gz bro
---
Zoom in the guy at the left.
---
jagex's definition: Muling, which can be defined as: using a separate account to store wealth. This includes clan banks. Alternate accounts are permitted provided they are used competitively. Players found to be muling will be banned (including clan banks, and those who use them).
---
When I try to think about it logically of why they would not want muling: they want it to be worth it to PK.  They don't want wealth stored in safe zones while you are out in dangerous areas. 
---
So with my thinking you can trade items to a clan member because he is actually using them and risking them.
---
I guess it is quite obvious they need to be more clear on this 
---
I think it's fine and obvious that a competitive game mode should reward players that invest their time into it, but I also think it's completely retarded for a game mode to only benefit NEETs and people taking a fairly long amount of time off from their daily responsibilities to no-life on a game for literally unhealthy amounts of time without rest.
---
This kid? You can't be serious yourself. 
---
Zuk on his nuts.
---
I don't think it will, it'll drop quite significantly now following the introduction of the lance. 
---
Vorkath is definitely better with your mage level being so low. He hits hard, just comes with the territory. 
---
The song made a comeback somewhere somehow. I know the streamer Cloakzy(fortnite) had been using the crab song as more of a theme song a few months back, before the 07 bandwagon. Don't know if he was the instigator or not though.
---
one of the funniest reddit posts ive ever read, so simple.
---
thanks! I have no idea what to even do with it lmao
---
Thank you thank you :3
---
Thanks for reply  :)
---
Will use ardy cape then
---
And I thank you! If I can work 4 hours IRL for 40 mill thats a OK for me
---
The post is saying not to mine in the spot pictured, but to go to the mining guild instead lol
---
You mean ranger gloves right
---
yeah, because 1 person definitely has the ability to walk into a tunnel with 50 people and EASILY eliminate all of them. 
---
totally.....
---
Yeah....
---
Yes they can, chances are 99.9% they won't, but real world laws override TOS.  If you sell something then steal it back, that's grounds to sue.
---
It has but its price fluctuations for no reason at all are laughable, like it went up 20m overnight for who knows what. I just wanna buy one lol
---
&gt;My only question is how he gets banned for something that he had gotten the okay from Jagex to do in previous seasons.
---
I can think of at least two. 1) One JMod giving the okay =/= every JMod giving the okay. Same way a cop might let you get away with speeding but another might not. 2) If he used the alt differently. Someone in another thread said Torvesta moved over the starting 10k. That's definitely muling since his killer gets a weaker key.
---
finally somebody who makes sense!
---
Clans doing it is fine since its 1 account per player and they are risking themselves outside the safe zones. This mode is not designed for solo players. I dont like clans but you have to understand how the game mode is supposed to work. Torvesta could have used a clan and it would have been fine
---
my other 90 elites and masters were all shite if that makes you feel any better
---
Now how about the people that RWT for gold and then buy in game bonds with that.  Makes membership almost $5/month at those costs (more like $6.50 but pretty close)
---
Damn you got blessed 
---
Wasnt it originally made for law running when it was actually good gp
---
Ewwwww
---
I have the same issue and it‚Äôs so annoying especially after having it work properly for months.
---
He gets paid in rng 
---
I've done over 1600+ clues total, don't give up!
---
They only said that because you weren't doing a good enough job, and didn't want to hurt your feelings.
---
He didn‚Äôt get banned, he got disqualified.
---
Imagine buying a phone case for the sole purpose of posting it on Reddit in hopes of up votes. 
---
Well, if I were to rebind my scroll wheel to a mouse click then. It's basically a one to one action just a scroll wheel gives faster inputs. That shouldn't be bannable right ?
---
Why the fuck does every ass hole need to tweet mod ash regarding every little thing in the world?
---
And another clan could go and wipe them down if they wanted to. Cant do that to a mule sitting in g.e
---
Support my bwana
---
thanks so much! I've played for 13 years and never expected this kind of luck... the possibilities are endless now!
---
If you use Wildy altar it's like 70m for 99 so like under 100$
---
Fuck this is quality
---
Then why do we have a safe bank. There's no cause for alertness with those spaces. The muling happens within those 10 spaces. Clan wealth is built up in those boxes, and then traded over at the end. It still isn't being risked. It's still a mule.  
---
And yeah, Jagex doesn't see it as how they've defined it and it's how clans have their super accounts.
---
Dmmt has a rule set listed somewhere which mentions muling
---
Nah, I just can't imagine someone that takes this game that seriously is anyone to fear
---
Oh they can grasp it just fine, it‚Äôs just that they personally benefit from the arbitrary rule enforcement and want to maintain the status quo in their favour. Nobody can argue in favour of the rules and not be fully conscious that they are being full of shit.
---
What would you suggest jagex to do from teaming? Seems rather impossible and a part of the games mechanics. 
---
We are truly living in the rennaisance of OSRS entertainment. One Kick Rick, Swampletics, One Chunk Man, By Release, etc... What a time to be alive.
---
it is *literally* a tournament that culminates with a 1v1 tournament.... to suggest....like I'm trying to have a conversation in good faith...but you're only giving be so much to work with here
---
No why?
---
The whole game is tedious. Isn‚Äôt this more in line with game design?
---
Just use shift drop like everyone else. If you think that's a one to one fine. But if you get banned it's at your own risk. Just gotta ask if it's worth it or not.
---
not sure god cape would mean tob season allready maybe he did get it tho
---
You a real bwana
---
zybez and the radio thing it had was awesome
---
I just use a runelite addon for 1 click blackjacking. 
---
He's saying what we're all thinking 
---
Before his bathroom was installed, the Wise Old Man actually just shit on his chair and magic'd it away. Also he had a romance with the Draynor guard. 
---
But bonds helps player in two ways, 1 part gets gold and loses money. 1 part loses gold but gets to keep money.
---
With spins for xp, only 1 part gains something, the ones with real money. 
---
I'm thinking of getting to atleast 80-85 range before I go back to vorkath. I don't wanna grind pest control lol. If I have to go though I will...
---
How much longer is this subreddit going to rush to someone's defense without hearing the whole story?  
---
Wow...great point...I wonder why there are *literally* never clan v clan wars in DMM...almost like...maybe they're trying to protect the gear....or something
---
Fake and gay
---
ah...so we're just on reddit üòÇ
---
We pay, he gay.
---
Agreed and the point of my post is to show all the people complaining about fixing it that this isn't something easily fixable
---
I feel old. 
---
Well the clans are actively playing the accounts with a 1:1 ratio and then give the gear to a teammate so that they could do better, seems like a strategy, not breaking rules.
---
Just because one person cannot do it doesn't mean it's a safe zone, and the argument against removing their ability to play "because they're safe in numbers" is seemingly saying that teams can't play together at all in multi without fear of being removed from the game. 
---
This is the nature of a game with mostly open world pvp.
---
The game format will never allow for thorough enforcement of overreaching rules that are easily committed such as boxing, for example.
---
You in essence need someone watching over every player in order to enforce the rules as they are, and the game format forces it to be that way. 
---
That is one exceptionally long thumb!
---
Alright, thank you. I figured I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong and I was only in the world because of POH house tele method on party world for when task is finished.  In the future I‚Äôll jus avoid it altogether. 
---
The biggest issue I have with this argument is that Torvesta hasn't given us any concrete evidence that a jmod okay'd it. He said he asked a jmod to look at the account and see if it was bannable. I haven't seen a single spot where he gave us the name of the jmod or a screenshot of the conversation.
---
There could also be small differences in how he ran the account that make a difference. They seem to accept running an alt that is doing some form of skilling, or any activities outside of the safe zone. That's the main reason clans get away with it. They have their mule also train crafting, or something else buyable that can be done in a safe spot, so it's not *just* a mule. Did Torvesta do any skilling on the alt in previous tournaments? Did he do any on the alt this time around?
---
Additionally, we all know Jagex's detection systems are questionable and inconsistent on the best of days. For all we know, with the actual info provided, Torv is lying about talking to a jmod, and just got lucky that he wasn't banned in previous tournaments.
---
Now, fundamentally, these rules should be enforced exactly the same on every single account, regardless of if it's a clan vs solo, or a content creator vs a random player. Based on Jagex's actions, there's either not a practical way to implement it, or they don't want to. I prefer to believe the former, but I'm not ruling out the latter. Either way, I feel that the DMM format is fundamentally biased towards clans, and there's no easy way to fix that.
---
I've had ash for sale for 1b for many weeks... I'm still waiting on my lucky day :]
---
Because the way he said it, he muled the account 80% of the time, with 20% of the time going into pvp zones but still risking nothing.  
---
It's like, if your account had 1000 hours gameplay and you botted 250 hours, then getting banned.   
---
Your response can't be "yeah but I did play more than I botted, so technically its not botting"
---
I like pvp worlds, but I also think that they are contributing to a lot of the ‚Äúwildy is dead‚Äù mindset as well. 
---
Just follow train ZMI rofl
---
Loved tip.it forums, used to look at the PK kill drops before videos were being made. Brings back memories.
---
I posted one time about someone botting and it was such a small community that lighting I believe was her name posted and confirmed the bot.
---
Ok, so I'm looking to start doing Zulrah, never done it before.
---
  
---
Right now I have full blessed dhide with an accumulator and a blow pipe with 4k adamant darts and 4k scales. Range is 75 and prayer is at 53 and magic is at 75 with a trident of the seas.
---
Any good zulrah guides or advice for my first time? Currently have only 1.5m in the bank and can't afford a ring of suffering or a serpentine helm atm. Should I just run Barrows until I can afford some more things?
---
I realllllly wanna start farming zulrah
---
It worked on one of my previous posts. You can even see the  battery life on my phone 
---
I love how 2/4 of your things are not even against the rules and have been integral to RS and DMM respectively since their creations. 
---
That is, confusingly, not a link?   
---
link me the multi finals.   
---
Tell me who the December multi tournament winner was
---
Nah alts are fine in the main game as long as it‚Äôs not for ‚Äúrigging minigames‚Äù whatever they mean by that
---
I fucking love this subreddit, take my upvote and a kiss you magnificent bastard x
---
Okay so I like Mod Archie. Was a fan of of him before he was a Jmod, but that was a rather weak excuse free from him. 
---
So because he's a high profile creator in the community but because the other people that are doing it aren't that high profile, it's acceptable? I'm not even defending Torvesta really. But you can't ban him but not others who are doing it.
---
Come Archie you're better than that. 
---
Everyone knows the rules were broken... it's that everyone else is also breaking the rules.
---
If this is a f***ing crab rave, I swear to god
---
Depends what you already have. But 83 con is absolutely worth it
---
I'mma be honest I was 100% dead to the world when I was mindlessly farming this, that keys/h was based on how many keys I got and my best guess as to how long I was there. Your probably right though. My bad I should have payed more attention
---

i liked spongebob before it was even cool,  jk there was never a time it wasn't cool
---
If you're talking about DMM, it's literally been part of the discussion since they first brought it up on a QA stream.  If you're talking about the main game, there's well over 100 worlds to choose from so just hop.  
---
Clearly that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on the item is a gold mine for merching, it constantly dips to correct to its real vlaue then rises back up to its inflated price. Rinse and repeat 
---
No, I sold to a competitive major supplier with zero care about risk because I was expecting to get banned anyways (I didn't).
---
I sold 500m to one reseller and 1b to another reseller, both gave me prices of 0.85 and 0.87.
---
Wish I still had the gold, but I was quitting at the time and had bills to pay.
---
That only works with extremely low trade volume items, this is absolutely not that.
---
https://rsbuddy.com/exchange?id=2132&amp;
---
I'm not sure what it used to be since I was only f2p in the old days.
---
I prefer fighting with no overheads (low prayer accounts)and being able to bring my untradeables like no prayer firecapes etc. 
---
Whenever I go deep wild that is not what I experience and I am forced to bank my untradeables or lose them. 
---
I just really prefer the edge style and pvp style of pking. 
---
If they ever took pvp worlds/low level bh options away I would probably quit pking. Only recently did they allow us to set targets to only 1-10 wild in bh. It took them years to finally push that through.
---
I am just speaking of my preferences and dont expect anyone else to feel the same way or have to agree with me.
---
The dps is marginal without bgs spec, with bgs spec(s) elite void leaps way ahead. Meta is currently to respec anyways after 1 kill and go back to vorkath, allows for much faster kills netting more profit than staying for a second or third kill.
---
Probably because they‚Äôre much bigger than a guy hosting a server at home for 25k users. 
---
If clans made videos showing them explicitly breaking the rules, they would be banned too.  Do you have proof that everyone on every clan mules? Send it over to jagex and they will be banned.
---
I'm talking about the post 2 above yours that was the same meme.
---
Yeah, but if a broken glass equals losing, and one player is allowed to have 50 people hold their table steady while a single player can't hold their table then you have an inherently broken system.   
---
like I realize you just wanna argue and are being intentionally obtuse...but still.  
---
Like
---
It's 
---
He deserves the ban, and for those talking about the players breaking rules in his vid, they don't ban players in 5 seconds you tards.  Just because you saw a reddit post saying jagex doesn't ban others doesn't make it true.
---
You say this but Twitter has been the most effective means of customer support for many players. 
---
No, because most of the time that alt sits in a safe zone flipping items. It gets played eventually outside of a safezone once torv is happily geared out.
---
Good on him. Other people abusing the rules is no reason to unban someone who was caught doing so. This idea that people who break rules are left to run free isn't really true, given that players have been disqualified many times before, sometimes in blanket bans. Jagex isn't omnipotent though, so how can they be expected to ban literally everyone as soon as an offense is committed? This whole thing just seems partly motivated by fan adoration of a beloved streamer, which I can understand, but doesn't seem like a very rational stance to take.
---
However, if a Jmod really did mislead Torvesta then that is very unfortunate, and the Jmod in question should really be asked to make a formal apology - taking that decision by themselves is a massive overstep of power when 20k IRL gp is involved. I think it's fair that the proof of which Jmod said this is presented to the community first before any action should be taken on their part.
---
Furthermore, Jagex really does need to take another look at the state of alt usage and definitions of things like muling, and issue a thorough list of rules, their boundaries, and examples, in time for the next tournament. 
---
Venezuelans? 
---
That's the whole point. The reason we are upset about torvesta is because he's trying his hardest to compete against these clans and gets banned for it. With jagexs incomplete wishy-washy grey rules it favors clans. We want justice for all who in some form use more than one account to gain an advantage.

In reality thought this all streams from a bigger sense. The lack of care for keeping old content being relevant, lack of bans and 0 care for pvp all while just trying to shove new content down our throats
---
If you need a link to know there's an hour of multi before the 1v1s, you should really shut up.
---
If you buy bonds through the GE for your membership you're excluded from make these memes, lol.

How much did Jagex pay for this?

You are incredibly naive. No point in discussing this with you since you clearly don't even watch DMM lmao
---
What class is this?

Mods, return this players account, name, and items. but most importantly, ban any accounts the hijackers made contact with while logged into his account. Hackers need to be made an example of, they don‚Äôt deserve everyone elses efforts put into the game.

Did you have 2fa on your account? If so, how can someone have access to your account without having the authentication code?

If it makes you feel better, I made almost your exact meme and posted it on a discord before you did on Reddit. SO TECHNICALLY
---
PvP clans and Locking down areas.  
---
You're arguing against something the people you're replying to isn't saying. Currently clans are allowed to support each other or feed their best hybrid. 
---
What Torvesta did breaks rules, what clans are doing doesn't. Even if it accomplishes the same thing, until the rules are changed what you're arguing against doesn't make sense. 
---
If my friends wanted to make accounts and in the end, feed their supplies to me, that's not against the rules. However, if I were to make a bunch of accounts to safely hold my gear and supply my character with stuff I couldn't get on my own, that's against the rules.
---
I think you understand this, but you're arguing about the way things *ought* to be instead of the way things currently are. I agree with you that it's busted, but we're discussing a current situation, not a hypothetical one. 
---
Road to 3k upvotes to get customer support.

i like this idea but what if instead you could use either strength or attack not one or the other

How dumb can one person be. 
---
When I started doing zulrah I had a friend watch from the telescope and tell me where to move for a good 10-20 kills lol, and then I got used to it without his instructions with zulrah guide site and it took me a good 80 kills until I didn‚Äôt need the guide anymore 
---
I'm not arguing whether or not players should be allowed to assist one another.
---
I'm arguing that they're observably and demonstrably not the same actions, and with the rules as written one is clearly not against the rules and the other has a questionable point in which it is.
---
You keep calling me obtuse but saying that I'm arguing something that I am not, and it's rather obnoxious.
---
Unless you just use them as alts.
---
can confirm, am dutch
---
say it till it‚Äôs backwards 
---
Except the discussion isn't about the current situation, except in the sense that it IS broken. 
---
That is literally what the conversation is...that letting DMM be run by clans violates the rules in the same way, but it's allowed.
---
That's nuts, congrats. Meanwhile my friend just got his first bandos item, also boots, at 826 kc. Rng crazy
---
I know.... I‚Äôm saying I did the same thing and mine made it to the hot section 
---
midget golf lmfao
---
I don't need a link. The point is that the hour of multi before the 1v1s aren't what matter...the 1v1s are. 
---
that is, *literally*, the point.
---
So since you're so lost I'd take your own advice about shutting up. 
---
It's untradeable so you can't bot it like you could with pure essence (when it wasn't worthless).
---
In a later interview, when asked for further explanation of the tweet, J.K. Rowling revealed:
---
'It wasn't so much that Dumbledore wanted to afk his magic training, it was more that pursuing other magical knowledge would take him further away from Lumbridge. This would be a problem for Albus as he didn't want to miss the frequent homosexual orgies hosted by Duke Horacio within Lumbridge Castle' 
---
Understood. But this niche style of pking (regardless of how many actually do it) doesnt warrant having the entire game world for an activity that takes place 90% at the GE. 
---
Its essentially a minigame like free for all clan wars with risk. 
---
Not trying to take anything away from you. Im just saying it could easily be incorporated into a regular world. Whether its a section of the wilderness that has the +15 mechanic or if its another area of the map, the same thing could be achieved. 
---
It's not their job, it's like complaining about prices of goods to someone who's job it is to clean floors. It's not their field 
---
Seriously having an e-sports conversation about Runescape is just fucking retarded. , and PKing is too RNG number based and "who can switch faster" to have any potential. It isn't a skill, it's just...clicking faster than someone.
---
God ash with the real news. All you crybabies complaining about torvesta being banned for muling but only q couple seasons ago asked jagex to do something about all the muling. Typical cultist autism.
---
Go away you sad nerd
---
Good hes a douchey piece of shit that is making me scroll too much to see anything worthwhile
---
Dude wtf you even talking about? I watched torvesta vid and made a thread asking if muling is now legal before this shitstorm happened. I was shocked he put blatant cheating in his video. Have you read the dmm rules, this is explicitly just there as breaking the rules. If this was some nobody everyone would be chearing jmod smackdown.
---
If done and balanced perfectly, it could 100% work, but it would have to be perfectly adjusted to osrs!
---
This looks way too happy to be Morytania. XD
---
start now to get the hang of it, rvrn scuffed zulrah is better than barrows. For learning always switch your prayer first and safe to full in between zulrahs dives, with those stats you are looking at 3 minute kills minimum so it will take a couple of attempt to survive the damage long enough but your effort will pay off immensely. I wouldnt recommend grinding zulrah at those stats for very long though.
---
double oof
---
Have to wonder how Ash deals with this shit.
---
What you‚Äôre saying is they shouldn‚Äôt be able to ban bots because there is no video proof of them botting. 
---
MMO's shouldn't be about solo gameplay. (Coming from someone who plays an ironman) 
---
&gt;Memes aside runecrafting is tragically slow to train
---
It's about as fast as non-sweaty slayer. Xp rates isn't the problem, it's the lack of interactivity/discovery while training. Every run is exactly the same with no changes whatsoever. Slayer has varied tasks, drops and special events like superiors.
---
EVScape has a really good walk through.
---
Membership per month costs about 11 dollars. Implying that If jagex doesn't unban torvesta from the Dead man mode, people will cancel their membership. Obviously canceling their membership is a bluff :p 
---
except you are being obtuse, because the conversation everyone is having is that the clans \*should\* be considered violating the rules, because they're doing effectively the same thing muling accomplishes  
---
And then you're coming in with 'well technically clans aren't breaking the rules' which is a non-answer in the context of what the conversation is actually about.   
---
"this shouldn't be blue!"  
---
"well, it is blue"

"yes, but it shouldn't be!"

It‚Äôs probably fine. I don‚Äôt remember being asked to enter mine though. 
---
The problem isn't locking down pvp areas as much as it is locking down people from completing some quests entirely, which they've been doing.
---
Locking down a resource like black chins isn't the same as blockading something like Piety. I think it's poor design for those areas to not to be made single-combat for DMM, so that you can still PK questers without it being a full-on camp and gank
---
Except *many* people are disputing it and using Torvesta's defence of allegedly being told it was okay in a previous tournament. 
---
I don‚Äôt think there are any iPad emulators capable of running OSRS mobile, unless you have the source code.  Unless you meant android emulator.
---
Pretty much what happened to dhcb for a long time and a similar attempt on lance when people wanted it buffed.
---
People are just jealous that other people actually have friends and can interact socially. 
---
You are correct. I don't agree with his arguments. Why should a solo player not be allowed to mule but clans can mule just because it's not the same person. That is outrageous and if there are gonna be bans for rules, then those rules need to be clear.
---
Personally I found it easiest to learn without following a guide or rotation chart or whatever. I found them more distracting and they don‚Äôt really teach you to learn what‚Äôs actually going on. Basically if you switch prayers as soon as you see his color then switch gear after and eat when needed, you can‚Äôt die.
---
Lol that's way too much of a coincidence 
---
Ill take hate any day to defend this arguement. 
---
We all knew what would happen with DMM when confined to a short time frame and, imo, exactly what many people had hoped for. 
---
Ever since DMMTs got 1v1 stages they have been, arguably, one of the best things for this game in terms of advertising/publicity and content developers. 
---
I dont think I've ever seen better RS PvP content then the week of DMM tournaments and finals
---
It's interesting to see handmade dragon daggers. They're always flat but when you look at your character in game hold it, it seems sort of round like a cylinder? I've tried making one out of steel but it fucks me up cause I wan to make it round but then it looks like shit. And I don't want to make it flat it doesn't look right

Anyone who logs into pvp worlds with their bank literally deserve anything that comes to them..

---
Same as 3a.

Runescape as a whole is different because there's no time limit, everyone can accomplish anything at their own pace. Other competitive games are the same, regardless of how busy you are, as long as you can dedicate some time, you can get to the top (if you're skilled enough) after enough time. 
---
Deadman Mode's format prevents this from ever happening, and it's what stops Runescape from ever being competitive because there's too many factors other than player skill that come into play. 
---
For the DD I followed a close up of the model I found on Google Images, and it has very few polygons. It's nearly a flat blade, though I made it taper to a near-point. The handle is very blocky.

i took more liberties with the scimitar, because at that size the in-game model looks like a cardboard cut-out without any true edges.

You've mad the argument that nobody said torvesta shouldn't have been banned.
---
I will make the argument that the OP never said the clans shouldn't be banned.
---
It's just easy to ban torvesta when there's irrefutable proof. Jagex needs resources and time to gather evidence on those clans before they can place bans. Now, whether or not that actually will, only time will tell. I'm not going to sit here and defend jagex until they give me a reason to do so.

clans would just use both sides to their advantage 
---
Haha yeah. I think the biggest issue with pvmers having it out for pvpers is because they don‚Äôt understand the wilderness or they‚Äôve been lure or tricked by someone and lost bank.

The former I can understand, in some instances. But 99% it boils down to people being foolish, but that‚Äôs all part of the experience.

You're a literal sheep. People like you go fucking crazy when a youtuber gets repercussions for his actions and asks the community to harass anyone and everyone possible to get himself unbanned.

The projection in this post lol
---
I think this argument goes nowhere. I don't agree with banning one player and while you "gather eveidence" against everyone else, the tournament goes on. Like I said, there needs to be clear rules, until that point, no bans should be made. To clarify I am not even a torvesta fan, I don't even watch his videos, I just personally believe they targeted one player for no real reason. Also, jagex had a clan hacking other players with a jmods help and they still haven't done shit to rectify that situation. So no I don't have any faith that they are gathering evidence. But we can agree to disagree
---
Thanks. How long did 97 crafting take you?

Thank you all for the advice, I got my runes now, so I'll be sure to ask you guys if I need more help!

My account was hacked last year and I lost my login username that I've had for nearly 15 years. Jagex support told me that they do not give back stolen names as they fall under the stolen items category.
---
Yeah, I think the behavior is questionable and it's one of the problems with gray area rules like this. I was just hoping to see a text transcription so I could see if people are blowing this out of proportion.
---
Emote plox

Don‚Äôt care? Lmaooo
---
PvM content represents a much wider portion of the player base, always has and always will. It should be getting an abundance of updates compared to PvP.
---
That's not to say that PvP should be totally neglected, and it definitely needs some work, but it doesn't make sense to fully switch gears off of making content for PvM at any point.
---
Again I'm sorry you feel that way. But if they want to kill you, even if it's not for loot, they can and will. Some people just want to go and kill players. They don't care about gear and that's 100% fine.
---
If someone's dedicated enough to qualify 2 accounts let them have it, it's harder than 2 separate people qualifiying 2 accounts anyways. Honestly it's pretty fucking stupid for jagex to say that ''well if you're not in a clan, don't bother playing''. Most people aren't in a clan, a lot of people might play in groups of 3 or 4, and while that might be considered a clan just to have an argument against me you can't compare few friends to fools or rot lmao

That's my idea. Just make DMM a clan based game. Have factions/clans and everyone is randomly assigned a faction. Then clans aren't an issue because everyone is in one and they are all equal in size. If a player is inactive for a certain amount of time they will be removed and replaced with people from other factions that are growing too big. This will keep it relatively even playing field.  
---
Those are normal numbers for dark beast tasks, im not sure if they intentionally made it lower since rs3 because i havent played it and i wouldnt know why they are a short task. Id you enjoy doing them you can always extend the task with slayer points
---
We did a lot of this stuff in pre 07 Wildy nerf clan wars.  
---
Not hard to have 2-3 guy run from the south to get the groups attention, then have 5-6 run from the north once the camping group breaks their formation. That‚Äôs a super basic concept but can easily be applied. 
---
But if they are all in a narrow corridor you can only go in once at a time, and only after having all the items from the quest in our inventory, it puts you at a disadvantage. 
---
At the very least if they are waiting outside you can see the white dots and run away. I don‚Äôt understand how is so incomprehensible to you. Lmao gl bro, you aren‚Äôt able to critically think at all. 
---
Smart, that spot is probably barely registered on the heat map.

That would be a good argument except for the fact hespori is time locked even when using kronos. So your comparison is a moot point.

Unless you're an iron you can just buy zul-andra scrolls

For afkable methods - Usings darts/knives against sand crabs at Zeah is fast, with the best range gear you can afford/wield.  
---
For long-term benefits, Train slayer alongside a cannon with any range method you can afford.

Doesn't even seem like a hard thing to do. Delete the account that has the name currently and put it on OP's account, easy as that.

Aye grats I just ran my first narrows ever and got a 1.4mil drop was hype I can‚Äôt even imagine this

Definitely, it must be SO fun and challenging to pk a defenseless pvmer with 6 of your maxed combat friends

ya ngl ive bought items like this before for 10k, even 100k. Random quest items. Theyve never gone through for the whole price though

Well jed did get fired. So there goes there inside help.

Not relevant. When people talk about venezuelans who play rs for a living, it's real people gold farming, not bots.

They're all conveniences or BiS/xp buffs. I played plenty of RS without them but they're all nice to have/EZscape.

Looking through your comment history. It all makes sense, you are just a very angry individual who gets satisfaction from baiting posts, and insulting comments. I ain't even mad, I just hope you can take sometime to calm down and self reflect. I have been there before my man, it just takes some time. Goodluck 
---
It's not solely about winning. The thing is why join a tournament where you have 0 chance to get anywhere in? You're going to get destroyed by clans and can compete properly as a solo player. That's the issue.
---
Honestly you aren't the target. Just some guy along the way. And yes
---
... It may come to a surprise to you.... But people like different things about this game. 
---
If Jagex targets a clan like RoT, you can be damn sure  they will ddos servers for months if not years until they get their way. If the servers are constantly crashing they will lose players.
---
It‚Äôs a bit of calculus to see which decision will lose the least amount of players.
---
Just a side comment, I've checked if that name was available well over 100 times just incase you ever gave it up :) I'm a huge OSRS nerd and I happen to own my own cigar shop. Message me if you want a cigar care package to blow smoke while this blows over.

I wasn't calling out Sparc mac specifically, I was just trying to help you understand the general point that the user you originally replied to was attempting to make. No need to get defensive hunty

No 9o agility first and full graceful?

Compared to the other non-combat outfits, Graceful and Rogue's outfit are the strongest, and you want to combine them.

sad i met my wife on rs, have crystal math labs on my favorites, and i have to do the math to keep track of my age.  I mean really does anyone in their late 20s actually keep track of that shit?
---
Way to make a fool of yourself though. Because if you really want to draw parallel  there, there are massive gangs committing large scale homicide on stream going unpunished.
---
Blocked.
---
Nah you won't make another post, everyone here is pretty much shitting on your post. Complaints about pvp are because Jagex continues to ignore the community. And ya I'm chillin so stop stressing over your 50k. Move on bud.

The guy did daily drop parties of 30m+ on f2p worlds last december. Get this man his stuff back.

Daily I logged into my account with a proxy and RWT‚Äôd my new tbow and want it back thread

Also, if you arent maxed or you have something they dont, you bought everything in real life and you suck. If you are maxed and cant be bothered with being called a RWT, you are now a botter and suck. You literally cant be better or having something someone else doesn't have without them accusing you. 
---
Ima assume ur color is that of white 
---
Why be a smartass about it and just play the game without mulling? It‚Äôs pretty damn obvious. Literally do anything that‚Äôs not sitting at the GE without doing a single thing other than nothing to move forward through the tournament. 
---
Except he‚Äôs right. If there was any value to a delay on 2fa removal, companies which are far more competent than jagex would do it. The problem isn‚Äôt with 2fa removal, it‚Äôs that the recovery system as a whole is fucked. I‚Äôd rather them address the actual problem rather than do a horrible bandaid fix.

Maybe because they‚Äôre not being found? Torvesta is pretty damn easy to be found. But also those gangs committing crimes on stream are breaking a rule on the site and get banned. Just like torvesta

How hard is to just drop trade gold to your main?

Or just drop money to main to pay for it?

King Roland, tree spirit, me, vampire dude, hellhound are all pretty low defence.

they are not hard, but getting 70 pray on iron requires some hefty grinding at blue / green drags :D

but its a nice goal since u need piety anyways

He does want to be unbanned, in his video he literally urges people to be obnoxious and spam "free torvesta" on  the upcoming dmm stream

I would suggest 99 Crafting, 88 con and whatever stats you're missing for diaries :) 
---
As what others have said, questing is good. But also try a bit of everything, see what you like. Combat, Skilling, questing, minigames, PvP. There's no wrong way to play RuneScape (other than ruining other people's time on purpose).
---
That being said, OSRS isn't the game for everyone, so personally I would play around in free to play for a while to see if you like it before going members.
---
I've known Cigar for a while now, he's a general in our (btw) CC. In the past he had a name get sniped on an alt after name changing. Afterwords he told me it's nbd as long as he doesn't lose "Cigar." He'd never sell his name. 
---
Justice for Cigar!!
---
Nah. They have several mods who check it constantly.
---
You picked blue cape Swampletics? :(
---
First thing I did when I started playing again. had 12m at level 20 or so and the child in me was *screaming* but the adult in me told me to buy 43 prayer and gear for doing mm1.
---
that's the joy of bonds tbh, they allow your average normie who back in the day had 87 wc has his highest stat to be able to do stuff they could never do before (like afford 43 prayer or do mm1 lmao) and *actually* make some progress, still remember getting my fire cape like 2 years ago, wouldnt have happened without bonds, and that was *the* absolute childhood goal. Thanks bonds!
---
Bro idk if you even know the rules, The rules say you cannot mule, so you cannot trade items to an account that never trains and sits in safe zones while you train a main... Clan feeding is X amount of people going out to dangerous places, training and getting gear and then giving that to a player who is still training. They're not giving it to a level 3 that then logs off. If they did they'd be DQ'd just like Torvesta did. People like to scream that Jagex only DQ content creators for this stuff but that's completely untrue, the only reason you hear about it is because they're a content creator... Everyone else either has to make a reddit post or just move on.. Stop thinking warped perceptions of things are "fact" when they're not.
---
Well, that's nothing. She took out of her ass Dumbkedore fucking with Hagrid, now her ione is black, Ron is trans, Dobby had the biggest dick, Ron was fucking Malfoy during Higwarts period, shall I continue, or are we just buggots and politics have something to do with it?
---
This is just pure bullshit to fit on political swamp shit she threw directly from her ass, becouse she has no talent and won't stay relevant from her work anymore.
---
This pasta will never not make me laugh. Just trying to picture whoever the subject is "pretending to be tired and not hear her" always makes me lose my shit. Was the original about Jonah Hill?
---
Yea I mean I guess. It's definitely not old school if you're trying to keep to like the true definition, but that being said neither is the GE and we voted that in. I just think it would be cool if ccs actually did something. Pretty much all MMOs have some form of guild house/ clan house. I don't see why we couldn't tie everything we love about os into making clans actually fun. 
---
It's actually *acoustic* mob mentality, thank you very much
---
This is like, the first legit game question ive ever seen here
---
But does it HAVE to be 53 agility?
---
The most broken aspect is the extra inventory spots imo never mind any other aspect especially high level pen whereas inventory management is huge
---
Ow my feelings :( I'll go cry into my max gear while you keep pking black dhides and spades 
---
Poor cunt
---
You get the firecape for completing the caves not for killing jad. Which means you need to stay alive for the few seconds until the healers despawn and the wave ends. 
---
No bug here
---
Hahaha holy shit this is priceless thanks for the laughs!
---
Wish getting extras let you put more in your POH or something 
---
For everyone wondering why people buy the meat for 10k ea, it is used in the Druidic Ritual quest and is barely ever sold on the GE.
---
And they are probably having more fun than you.
---
It would be more about the experience than the money. Can't beat high level bossing for money, but many players have the stats for high level quests and would be happy to do a bunch of them if it meant faster RC exp.
---
You misunderstand my point. The point was to address your insinuation as a benign comment. 
---
You made a talking point that is plain to see, we don't need repetition of the fact "yeah prayer scales with leveling". The technical truth of that isn't up for debate, the rate at which it's usefulness compared to the effort required is at the core of every skill content discussion. I have never seen a single person use that argument, to then argue "yes this is why we need more content". That "prayer scaling" as well as "agility scaling" commentary is almost universally used to try and convince people that the skills are fine as is, and no more content should come to them. Forget passives scaling, remove it if need be, most rational people would rather have actual content, than have skills driven by "passive" scaling or buffs for more than half the skills' 99 exp required.
---
Also you claim the following:
---
&gt;not that I think there's a large demographic of people who would see one skill lacking slightly in end game content as reason to vote against other pieces of content. 
---
Are you implying I'm of this camp or something? Otherwise I don't see the relevance of this statement in this context of discussion.
---
Second, can you be a bit more specific with this example? Like what skills, and what content were you reminded fall under this description that you've seen in recent memory fail a content poll due to that sort of argumentation being the driving force?
---
Lastly, what potential negatives do you think I'm trying to hide? I don't need to convince anyone of needing to add skills. The reference is plain to see with respect to other skills. Agility is neglected, likewise with Prayer in terms of level milestones past the 70's for prayer, and past the 90's for Agility (entirely past the 90's). Why is it you think I need to start convincing infantiles there ought to be more content? The number of levels with no milestones are plain enough for all to see. My appeal doesn't have any use for the people wishing the game was stuck in time in 2007 (those folks are lunatics that ought to employ their own locally hosted private servers), it's aimed at people who would like a game to progress.
---
Using prayer's passive scaling as some sort of "buff agility" argument like you seemed to have, is awful. It takes away from actual content that can be made (power creep budget explodes far more with something like a scaling passive effect) like in this case, more shortcuts and such other things (or better yet, combat interactions, but that's a discussion for a theorycraft in another post). If you had a change to agility to match the sort of passive usefulness level of prayer for instance there is thus less reason to grant it more usefulness if you understand me. Which is why your argument is rarely used for those in support of more content, and usually used by people who are against content. My main point finally being that: your argumentation isn't sound, regardless even if you (as well as I) are arguing for more content.
---
Oh and please, if you reply. Don't start a topic about determining the demographics you spoke of. Many people in the game are impressionable that vote, impressionable to argumentation, and far more impressionable to the fact that vote results aren't hidden (basically throwing a bucket of water over any attempts at determining true statistics of the voting demographic in this game).

Returning player here. DMM seemed really cool until I understand that it's just a clan thing. Lame. 
---
It's Dutch
---
In Duel Arena, both parties agree to a set of rules before battle, especially when bets are placed. If you break the agreement utilising a mechanic unintended for this purpose (eg. removing darts from blowpipe from the past), then that is rule breaking.  
---
In the wilderness, all players agree to the rule that it is a PvP zone, and you are in danger of being attacked, as well as capable of attacking. You accept responsibility to defend yourself, survive, and make sure you protect your items. This include skull tricking in some sense (when you enter the wilderness, you agree to the possibility of being skulled).  
---
It's similar, but not quite the same concept, hence I think it should be allowed.  
---
I never pk, by the way.
---
I believe there is a way to update info, it‚Äôs just not widely known 
---
This is fucking stupid üòÇ
---
Vorkath is a special case where you need **both** a **super** antifire potion and an anti-dragon shield to nullify his dragonfire attacks.    
---
When using a Toxic Blowpipe you can't wear an anti-dragon shield(or better).    
---
That means that you'll take damage from his dragonfire attacks.    
---
Protect from magic reduces the damage from these attacks, otherwise you'll take high amounts of damage.    
---
Ranged hits are also more frequent than magic attacks when you are **not** in melee range, so you'll take more damage each kill, meaning shorter trips.   
---
We just witnessed a mans rng die, RIP bro sorry for your loss.
---
Lmaooo you put this on reddit :D im the other guy hunting dragon defender
---
 - RNG 
---
Apples to oranges tbh. Wilderness you don't have to bring risk or a valuable +1 to fight or even fight back, there is pvm in it.
---
Staking the whole point is to fight another player 1v1 and you typically are advertising "whip 10m" then mage scam etc.
---
Wilderness ur not advertising "1v1 u don't skull"
---
Dhcb lets you use anti dragon/df ward so you can pray ranged. 
---
Blowpipe doesn't like you use a shield so you need to pray mage to provide the last layer of antifire protection. You need 3 layers of protection to completely negate vorkath's dragonfire. 
---
It's been proven that vorkath uses ranged slightly more often than mage, and ranged has slightly higher max hit than mage. So people with the dhcb although have similar killl times as a bp+bgs spec switch, you can easily last 5-6 kills a trip while with the bp you average 2. 
---

Not that big of a tragedy really, still managed to get 450 upvotes I guess.

You don't seem then exactly BECAUSE they are no name players. My friend was dq'd for muling, its definitely happening to other people.

Why didn't you screenshot then

just pay membership the normal way, no way in hell would i pay 3m for 2 weeks of membership, waste of gold.  Easier to just give jagex my $5
---
Can you hook me up with that sweet fan fiction you just described, RyuKawaii my bro?
---
No welding. Too advanced for this time period. Technically it would be melted and poured into a mold (runescape skips this) and then hammered into shape and sharpened. 
---
Still more work than hammering a chunk of dragon metal onto a chainmail. I do see why lvl 90 seems odd. A bit of a smithing rework would be nice
---
Regular antis work same as superantis, and you need 2 to heal you completely of venom. I usually sip either when venom starts hitting 10s or when i know therell be 2 phases where i likely wont get venomed. Just practice doing low gear/stats runs
---
Clouds dont venom you but just make you take damage, tho youll only be standing in them briefly for some melee phases otherwise you avoid it anyhow
---
Nice b8 mate.

Whyd you delete that last post that read

Probably because they chose not to?

DMM isn't a "multi" tournament, it's a tournament where your chances of winning/doing well drastically improve when you work together with other players and form alliances.

Anyone can write a unique world man. Look at pretty much any nonfiction, ‚Äúit‚Äôs got a unique world‚Äù is really almost a nonstatement. In fact, it‚Äôs story is super generic too. It‚Äôs literally just a coming of age story mixed with a heroes‚Äô journey. It even hits a ton of cliches like talented main character, a morally black villain, and a main character that‚Äôs pretty close to a Mary Sue.
---
There‚Äôs nothing about it that stands out among its peers as unique. I read dozens of similar novels in high school and middle school. I‚Äôve watched dozens of similar movies and TV shows. 
---
So why did it get so fucking popular? It had nothing to do with any of its innate qualities, it lies outside. It‚Äôs because of its audience. If you want a full explanation, check the other comment I left to someone who responded to me where I went into detail.

Log out right before the 2 mages

If you don't have your imbued Slayer helmet, go for it first before you do anything else. I know that NMZ is a grind (realistically like 3-4 hours tops) but it makes a world of difference and saves a lot of time and supplies when you have to range or mage tasks. 
---
Thank you very much! Idk how I overlooked it
---
(noob here) honestly, for months, I've  thought DMM was ironman settings by default, bc why the fuck wouldn't it be 
---
Special can be a neutral term. 
---
Being special does necessarily have to be positive. 
---
No it‚Äôs not. It is elite.
---
It belongs to the original owner - fingers crossed he gets it back. I wouldn't feel right snatching it after seeing this lol.
---
Well fair enough. You know it will be worth it. 
---
Yeah you‚Äôre stupid. 
---
they are game developers, you were expecting super models?
---
Severus gave him antipoison so the venom was became only a weak poison
---
How would these even work? Bonds are bought with real money and put on a players account. The player sells them on the GE where others buy them for gp. An NPC that sells bond is pulling them out of thin air.
---
The only real way to implement this is allowing ironmen to use GE for purposes of buying a bond. 
---
The USSR was ahead of the game
---
Wait what
---
I really love this one. Mad props
---
Nope, still can't screenshot 
---
I have 2 accounts, I usually just flip on my alt but during dmm season I play on it for deadman. My main is always playing on normal worlds.
---
When you log into a dmm world you will start as lvl 3 on tutorial island as if it‚Äôs a brand new account. Your normal account will not be affected.
---
I like to play on my alt so I‚Äôm able to do afk skills on my main and not xp waste (muh xp!!!)

This is incredibly condescending and uninformed. A multitude of teenagers and kids are passionate about reading and writing. They can definitely understand and appreciate good writing and the quality will influence what they enjoy and read.

&gt; They‚Äôre recommended it by parents, teachers, and general society. This audience is the king of bandwagons, which is why as soon as something becomes trendy, it spreads like a wildfire.
---
The reason why it's recommended to others and "spreads like wildfire" is because it was well made and people recognized this. It wasn't a fluke.
---
&gt; Think of all the shitty products this demographic loves or has historically loved. Fortnite, Minecraft, CoD. I‚Äôm not saying these products are terrible, but the scale of their popularity doesn‚Äôt match their quality.
---
I agree with this except that the demographic for Harry Potter ranges far further then just kids and teenagers. I agree that kids are more likely to appreciate an inferior product but that doesn't explain why adults loved the series too.
---
&gt; The same applies for Harry Potter, it‚Äôs generic and average, yet blew up as if it were the next lord of the rings.
---
Again, I don't agree that it's generic or average. But that's my opinion.
---
It costs extra for those

Dammmn what a beast. Got a fire cape with no range bonus on 4 armor slots.

The dhcb makes vork super relaxing. No need for bgs spec and switches. And your trips are extended to about 3-6 kills depending on your ranged level. 5 kill trips are common at 93 ranged, at least based on personal experience using a dhcb from 91 to 97 currently. I sold off my zulrah gear, zenytes and misc gear and bought a dhcb for 133m at the time. Super worth. 1.7k kills later and I bought back all the gear, afforded a pegasians and have near 100m cash stack in bank. 
---
then you have to pay 10% more...

It could go either way depending on who you ask. Personally, I would prefer pvp content to be more wildy focused; however, I can see why some people would prefer pvp worlds. Less running, easier to find a fight and get it done.

Great content

In my personal case and I‚Äôm sure this will resonate with others, I don‚Äôt feel safe to use my sense of humor in work settings or some social settings because of a hypersensitive society we have (in my opinion). There are people out there that will look to end your career because you said something they didn‚Äôt like 
---
*everyone disliked that* 
---
No need to be rude. I'm just pointing out something that I've noticed which is fairly prevalent in online communities.
---
you could funnel a venezuelan max gear and they'd probably still lose to any decent pker in black dhide and mystics
---
&gt; I think it's safe to say that most people have had enough of Deadman mode 
---
On Reddit maybe, but DMM is still jagex's most popular regular event at the moment.
---
I don't think that either should be exclusive, I believe that Jagex should be doing KOTS and DMM, but opening with "everyones sick of dmm" is just being dishonest. It's mainly a vocal minority on this sub that's sick of DMM, and even that only really became a talking point because of Torvesta's ban.
---
My point isn't directed at the wealth, its the unfair advantage a player can have over someone due to donations which the majority can't compete against. Dotterbitter is destroying everyone because of the gear given to him and he put 0 work in obtaining those items. If a normal player would have gotten all that gear plus stats, it would take them weeks. It took ditter a day. 
---
It's more impressive, in my opinion, that you managed to not gain a 99 until you got base 90s. The temptation's pretty high haha.

Wow-wee, look at all your friends that showed up.

Sorry for bein a little late with this. I saw your post yesterday, but forgot to reply to it.

So I just unlocked infernal eels recently and have been doing them for a few days now. From what ive read, infernal eels are more stable and consistent money wise as sacred eels are fully dependent on zulrah scale prices which have dropped quite a bit over the last couple months.
---
Also according to the wiki, infernal eels are about 30k more gp/hr right now.

previously he did herblore but didn't bother this time. should've been banned because muleing shouldn't be in DMM, but the whole meta needs work
---
Why is it dumb and pointless and doesnt work? Im willing to accept that but i want some rebuttal. And jagex of course. The only reason the prices are different is because of the trading economy. Jagex sets the high alc for all items but also sets the GE. But players can manipulate that if its wrong. Thats why hydras claw wouldnt buy for less than 70m even though it was listed as a 3m drop when it came out. If they could have the price ipdate more quickly then the community would ultimately set the price by trading on the GE. Jagex would just set the initial. If they want it to be a super rate expensive item they can set it very high, then if players dont like that they can sell it on the GE for less and it will reset the price to show that its not as expensive.

I like that idea too but I think the trading aspect is huge and shouldnt be completely taken out. The amount of time needed to ironman grind everutjing you need is way more than whats in a week unless youre lucky.

Dude. A guy gets his name stolen, another guy gets that name. Unless the dude was literally stalking the name 24/7, there's no way the name stealer lost the name.

You can check with Hans to see how many days ago you made the account. That'll give you creation date.

This guy's a good friend of mine and I can confirm that this isn't the case (for all it's worth).

Possible solution: make each world single player - so that other players don‚Äôt affect the outcome. Not sure how/if it would work with server infrastructure, but essentially every player is instanced.

Nah. Forge welding is as old as blacksmithing. Any metal you‚Äôd be making armor or weapons out of (even fictional ones like rune and dragon) wouldn‚Äôt be liquid at low enough temperatures to cast in an old fashioned coal forge. 
---
The customer support is good, it's just a nightmare to find.  If you do need to contact a real human, that's when it turns impossible.  You shouldn't need to though.
---
Jagex has made a statement that they have been banning other mules including those used by clans. They are not trying to single out solo competitors. And before you say it, feeding a few select players =/= muling.
---
And DMM is absolutely NOT designed to be a 1v1 tournament‚Äîjust because it ends in 1v1s doesn't mean it is fundamentally a solo experience.   
---
Clanning is a strategy and takes skill‚Äîa different type of skill that most of the reddit community has never experienced and thus doesn't appreciate.
---
The DMM meta is clanning and reddit needs to get over it. Why doesn't everyone instead focus their efforts on getting a solo based tournament introduced into the game if that's what everyone wants to watch.

Actually people in the community are claiming that they own the servers they are advertising for, which makes lots of sense if you think about it.

I don't think they'd wanna film a skit while some random fat guy is shuffling laps around the torture chamber and constantly gets in camera view.

You don't gain anything after 89 though, right? Well, besides barely noticeably faster regen for the last 10 levels and a skullcaps that counts as a graceful Cape, right?
---
Why would you do that to yourself?
---
Found the BAS member 
---
How do you police it though? Apart from the turning it into Ironman mode there is very little they can do to stop it. Stopping muling is a good start but where do you do from there? Having multiple people will (and should) be an advantage over a single player in this game mode.
---
Jokes aside, if you have Lvl 5 healer and are going with melee, if you use the justicar spec when its on accurate you can kill half the round with a single spec, its actually quite effective.

---
The problem with your argument is that Jagex 100% admitted that there IS a point where it is NOT rule breaking.
---
What you suggest is 100% what Jagex has admitted, there is some mythical % where they decide that it is NOT Muling. But we have no way of knowing what that % number is, because obviously it does not actually exist and they're just making shit up on the fly.
---
oh i'm following clearly you're just stupid. literally nothing changed with the ruling of mulling. 
---
Doing firemaking next
---
They purposefully don't as they get flooded from bots constantly appealing botting bans. If that's the reason they most likely would not unban anyway. It's harsh but they don't have the team to check all appeals so they choose to pretty much cut those out.
---
Okay. You are right. Dont come here go to runescape forums for accounts issues. This is reddit. I hope this reply satisfies the rest of your day. Zamorak bless.

Pretty sweet, though balista is not that exciting for ironmen, I believe it's only use is PvP.

I feel like even trying to afk and loot on 30 accounts while resetting when aggro stops would require an insane amount of effort for the gp to the extent it would probably be more profitable to play less accounts, or do something like money snake or coin dragon.

Bring one antipoison(4), take one sip every 100 damage u deal to Zulrah. Taking a sip turns antivenom into normal poison, and if the normal poison damages you and you get venomed again, the venom is reset back to 6. Try to time it so that you drink a sip as the poison is about to hit you before you get venomed again.

Why would someone draw this? Like ever?

This is such a stupid gray area though.  Creating an alt to farm and feed a main is more like the bullshit that clans pull with feeding people.  But creating an alt purely to just stand in safety and hold all your items (even if it's also flipping) should absolutely be against the rules, since the entire gimmick of the mode is that it's pvp and you lose lots of shit if you die.  Storing stuff in a DIY-safe-bank completely circumvents that.  But what if the alt is intended to go farm stuff later?  Well it should still be against the rules to hold items for the main in the meantime.  And what if it isn't an alt at all, but rather a clan feeder that's only doing super safe stuff and is being used to hold items and eventually feed the small handful of chosen ones?  More gray area.  Obviously should be against the rules as well but how?  
---
The whole system is a clusterfuck.  And given the fact that it's a clusterfuck, they might as well just fucking unban him.  The rules are insufficient, unclear, and largely unenforceable in a lot of ways.  This shit needs work.
---
I'm a bit out of the loop, what does it mean to lock down areas? Like a large group of players farming all the resources at once?

I've been petitioning on every Q&amp;A thread recently to get this moved over to the Hard-tier rewards instead (along with the red dragons shortcut and noted red dragonhides). The Karamja elite rewards are packed and some of them are incredibly good (extra life at jad???) but there's only a small handful of hard rewards by comparison. Definitely some re-balancing required here.

This just proves to you non believers that jagex is actively banning bots. 
---
It's just a majority of them are these ones, the ones that are scuicide bots.

The ones that get away for a while only last a week or two. Long enough to get to blue dragons, or kurasks at the end of the week for a few days.

Agreed, he was banned because he was a popular player...

I have more of a problem with the fact that a mod had already confirmed what he was doin was not a banable offense, only for him to be banned.  Whoever that mod was should‚Äôve taken responsibility

no f keys

i want jagex to actually ban clan members and not just say they did ban them but not high profile i want fucking proof of a list of all names banned with confirmation

3800 dry i hate you.

The clan fights are 99% of the tournament, 1v1 is a small portion of it.
---
Clan fights decides who gets in and being in a clan makes it a lot easier to get in. 
---
Also didn't they get rot a statue and not an individual player?

Yeah I was thinking this the other day. I wish they‚Äôd stop giving out the tradeable rares, because like you said was just an aura about the old ones.

You really arguing that GoT isn't more complex than any of those second rate drama's and soap operas? That's how I know you're just arguing nonsense.
---
It's incredibly easy to create magical and fantasy worlds man. Pick up any number of fantasy books and you'll find a fantasy world.
---
Also, if that were the determining quality of why Harry Potter became successful, why is it that the massive amount of books and movies with unique and fleshed out fantasy worlds didn't become just as successful?
---
Making a fantasy world is easy. Let's not pretend Harry Potter's is unique either, it's basically just taking regular high magic world, in a contemporary setting, and adding a slight twist that the wizarding world is a secret to the mundane world.
---
Literally the most "unique" part about it is the fact the wizarding world is secret, and that's one of the most commonly used tropes in fantasy.
---
You want to know the problem?
---
You LIKE Harry Potter, so because I've insulted it, you've taken it personally. Except, you can't rationally explain WHY you like it, you can only cite details about it, except none of those details are particularly special. 
---
You just think they are because you're predisposed to liking Harry Potter. Why? Because you liked it when you were a kid, because you were told it was good by someone and you enjoyed it when you watched it and left it at that.
---
&gt;It's your opinion versus over a billion who disagree with you. It takes an incredible amount of arrogance and a stubborn commitment to being a contrarian to think you're right and everyone else is wrong.
---
This basically sums up why you're wrong. You're using public opinion as a way of strengthening your own beliefs. It's how the vast majority of people decide on their opinions.
---

No. RuneScape (2) transformed into RuneScape 3. Stats/items/etc. carried over.

---
Teaming at its core *isn't bad*.  When teams have the ability to use alts to bully down choke points to quests 20 versus 1, it's a toxic.
---
1. Get rid of alting entirely.  One real person, one account.
---
2. Jagex needs to have the users sign an agreement and then assign a jmod to vet any top 16 players (e.g., anyone eligible for a prize).  Anyone who logged into 2 accounts is disqualified. Yes this would be done after already playing the tournament, but the potential punishment itself should hopefully deter clans, especially clans who funnel resources.
---
3. Remove PVP multi lines across the majority of the game.  There are some places where they make sense and it would be *actually cool* to see actual clan wars occur over key training areas (Catacombs of Kourend, for example).  Right now there are so many areas to bully out/choke hold, clans don't care to fight each other.  One clan gets Shilo Village, one clan gets DS2, one clan gets GWD, one clan gets Catas, and nobody cares to fight each other over the other resource.  Scarcity will make things actually interesting for clans and will force them to also waste resources fighting each other instead of solo players.

Man I wish there were more update videos from clans or a reporter able to talk about different clans goals and such during the tourney. Especially with Torvesta out that content would be welcome instead of these type of fight videos with not much context to their lead up.

See, I agree with what you're saying more than any psuedo argument anyone else has made. You've gotten to the crux of it. We like these things because they're a part of us. Their quality doesn't matter to us. We enjoy them unconditionally.
---
I love Dragon Ball Z, yet I can admit it's pretty badly written. I love Harry Potter, yet I can admit it's not deserving of it's hype. I love osrs, and i'd actually argue that osrs has some amazing features that other games should defintely try out.
---
Just being critical and analytical of something doesn't mean you don't enjoy it. I think people often forget that and especially with things we've made "ours" like nostalgia, we get defensive quickly.
---
Yep- I read somewhere a 3rd was stolen. Jagex is trying to tell me it is because of Runelite. I did use it for the very first time yesterday, but I researched it first and everything I saw on it said it was trusted. I really do not think that is it. I do have an rs authenticator- so, how? They just do not seem to want to take the time to fix this situation. All these OG names that are being hacked or whatever you want to call it and they can not seem to see that it is possibly something wrong within their system.

&gt; Even I who read more than I would say anyone else in my graduating class of 445 (and I know this because I read about a book ever week or two through high school) failed at recognizing the quality of some books, and over estimated the quality of other books. Not even because of a lack of reading experience, but rather as a lack of a historical cultural, social and political knowledge.
---
You do not need to be well versed in those things to understand the quality of a book. Social and political knowledge in youth has increased a substantial amount in recent years, but a book does not need to rely on deep messages and political undertones to be quality literature. However, there's a reason they teach books such as Farenheit 451, Death of a Salesman, and 1984 in highschools. Teenagers aren't stupid. They're aware of the world around them and are capable of complex thought. Are they perfect? No. Will there opinions on important matters change over time? Most likely. However, they are still capable of determining quality in the media they consume independent of what others tell them.

Yea, a 12 year old won't enjoy or fully understand To Kill a Mockingbird but the quality of a book isn't completely determine by its message. 
---
&gt; Also, the circle of people you're around vastly influences your opinion on that. If you're studying English literature in college, you're going to think everyone reads a book a month.
---
The average amount of books read by an American every year is 12. And yes, I'm aware that the number is inflated by people who read way above the average. However, the most common number reported by the Pew Research Center is still 4. People still read books and can determine quality. Yes, those who read less then others will often turn to reviews to choose a new book. However, they aren't braindead sheep consuming whatever is put in front of them. They won't like a book just because critics said it was good. Millions of kids, adults, and children all loved Harry Potter and thought it was quality literature. Are they all wrong? Are they all just parroting what critics say because they can't think for themselves?
---
Nothin wrong with ragging yo. Sure it's annoying but honestly it's simple a tactic.
---
Thats because the game That‚Äôs hated round here (from now on known as ‚Äòthe game that must not be named‚Äô) has up to like tier 9 weapons or more, and so has the scope to devalue runeite etc. 
---
BiS gear, Buyable skills
---
God DMM was so fun when it just released and nobody really knew wtf they were doing, now it‚Äôs an orchestrated cesspool that no casual player will ever go near 
---
It is worth a try. I have tried everything else. The ones that have responded seem content with blaming it on runelite. I really do not think so. I dl ed the proper client. OSB is supposed to be a 3rd party client too, but I do believe a former jmod made it or something? Even if a 3rd party got my info somehow thru runelite, how could they bypass my rs authenticator? I am a computer geek, but not a hacker and I just do not understand how this can happen to people and it be disregarded as if we are all noobs!
---
Engine work unfortunately.
---
However Runelite currently has a plugin that does this. You'll even find yourself right clicking the bankers after you enable it out of sheer muscle memory.
---
I disabled it, that's why I'm asking if Jagex can toggle the warning again
---
Torvesta is a pretty big osrs youtuber in the Pk community, and during the recent Deadman mode tournament he was banned for using an Alt account for merching to gain more money. His defense is that how is what he did different when whole clans funnel resources into a few individuals or lock down valuable training areas.
---
when I rejoined osrs about 2 months back i was at cwars bankstanding in the middle of doing some rc and all of sudden theres just loot showing up underneath, I wonder if this is what happened.
---
Is your philosophy degree going to get you out of jail when you "only killed a kid for a small amount of time"? lmao.
---
What happens next?
---
People would just work with friends. Make it so that everyone has to join a team and that mechanics make other teams you ally with physically not able to backstab yah until the final day.
---
You talk to the doomsayer in lumbridge to enable it again buddy. 
---
There's plenty of warning for dangerous locations as it is. 
---
I'm not trying to sound holier than thou or like an armchair psychologist but this really reaffirms my belief that anonymity reveals a person's true colors. 
---
You have so many 20 something year old men that feel inadequate and take out their frustrations from behind a screen and being outright scum under the guise of anonymity. It makes me wonder how the average Twitch/OSRS/Reddit flamer would react if someone IRL saw their actions behind the screen.
---
*karambwan stops*
---
Thats great to know, Ill check around runelite rn, thanks. 
---
But wait, if runelite can do it, why cant jagex ?
---
Sounds more like you think something is bad because you don't like it, and when your exact logic for why it's bad is applied to something you DO like, you get defensive about it.
---
Case in point, you're now calling Harry Potter, Law &amp; Order and Grey's Anatomy bad, despite being 3 highly praised cultural successes of last decade. 
---
It's okay to say "I don't like Harry Potter" and nobody would care. You saying J K Rowling is untalented and Harry Potter is cliche is the issue here. You don't have any proof of these two things, just your own opinion. See I'm allowed to like both Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, but one is not better than the other.
---
Only deaths in the wilderness
---
The teams people play in already exist though. The clans know their clanmates, they split the prize money IRL etc.
---
So what happens when you kill players from the other faction? Do you get their loot? If not, you've ruined DMM as a PvP gamemode. If so, you've not stopped clanmates transferring items to one another.
---
Just broke 100 guys- keep the upvotes coming please- thank you so much!
---
So born an asshole but recently flaunting it. Ty for the honesty.
---
I agree.  Its basically just a mass of people being blocked out by overhead prayers and skulls
---
I mean he was muling.
---
Jagex lives on Earth, why don't they fight terrorism too?
---
Try to figure out what‚Äôs causing the issue and post on the github for it. Or post here and someone can post it as an issue on the github.
---
Once you use the head on one Cape all other capes have the effect. No need to use another head
