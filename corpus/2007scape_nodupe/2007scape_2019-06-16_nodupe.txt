Thanks for the good wishes! I'm slowly but surely grinding out the essentials, spreading out the skills, looking into quest unlocks and what the "meta" is for OSRS. It'll be a bit of a journey, but a fun one for sure.
---
---
---
You've got to take into considering that ALL skills in RS3 have a cosmetic 120 cape. People these days don't go for 99's, they go for 120s, so it kind of evens itself out a bit.
---
Just viewed your reddit profiel¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Also good luck trying to learn the game, am level 93 and still don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Honestly that‚Äôs my favorite part of this game tho

Best way to train magic from 83 without MM2 done and without losing too much gold? Also off task. I'm thinking using my highest burst spell on Nechs in Kourend dungeon. Is that correct?
---
Lmao
---
No. Bot farm is dumping their balls before ban
---
Lol guess I forgot I had it there

It's changed now, OSRSN: S0ME IDI0T
---
Level 1 Prayer. Level 99 child molestation.
---
Keep in mind most players aren't getting even close to those XP rates.

are u kidding mate

I'm assuming he means Butane Hash Oil. Essentially a concentrated form of marijuana flowers. Also called honey oil or cherry oil (as I've seen atleast). 
---
Move to Canada, G. We're allowed all the flowers!
---
He also was a shifty starting running back at the university of Alabama
---
Who the fuck gets married without meeting first? Obviously he has physically been with her and seen her
---
Well that means messing with the formula for magic accuracy which is harder and maybe there are some things in the game that could affect unintentionally like some sort of quest you aren't supposed to be able to use magic or something idk.
---
From a development standpoint I would think it's easier to just adjust XP for consecutive splashes on the same mob. It would have a quite tiny impact on people legitimately using magic because they have to splash twice in a row for it to be relevant and even then it would be like a 10% decrease. Could even give a 1-2% splash xp boost to compensate.
---
It would need to be worked so as to not hamper people legitimately training magic through curse or stun/alching etc though.
---
I think they just don't wanna do anything about splashing though tbh now. Magic can be a drag to train if you aren't bursting/barraging, and that can be downright expensive if not done through greater nechs which have a pretty hefty requirement of 80 slayer.
---
THE LOWER THE BETTER
---
Except we don't know if MTX = bonds as well, because if that's the case OSRS greatly outshines RS3. Not to mention some players were grandfathered into osrs with rs3 $5/month membership prices from back in the day, because they've never canceled their memberships.  Those are counted for rs3, even if they no longer player rs3 anymore and just play osrs (which means they would cancel their membership if not for osrs).
---
Even if MTX is exclusively counted for RS3, if you take 2018 that will mean RS3 earned 47M and OSRS earned 42M, but the entire profit Jagex had was 45.1M, so we can assume that RS3 costs more than 5M more than OSRS in Employees/Developers, Upkeep costs, Servers since their team is much more than just twice as large.  If MTX includes bonds and if you take into consideration the grandfathered memberships, RS3 makes WAY less than OSRS.
---
So in reality, OSRS profits more than RS3, despite it not being "the main game" and the main focus of Jagex, and the trend shows that every year OSRS is earning more and more while RS3 is earning less and less, and as things are OSRS is ALREADY earning more than RS3 if you take into account the costs RS3 brings to the table.
---
He could of framed Framed but he had to settle with Settled.
---
It's better than all the other "2 type if skills" memes.
---
I get the sentiment, but what solution would you propose?
---
I wasn't thinking about myself, more so new players with bad magic gear, getting their low level grind punished by a change to the xp.
---
No. This isn‚Äôt rs3

It was kind of a joke, my man. I know he isnt going to actually just look at a game hes completely unfamiliar with and stamp it off because it doesnt appear to be a marriage broker.

Transformers Universe was around for about 6-8 months in some playable form. It has a far more interesting history then anyone gives it credit.

OSRS bonds count as MTX, which I would expect is not an insignificant part of the total MTX figure.

I'd start over personally, you could turn it into a zerker though.

At what point do new players usually switch away from the bone crossbow when training range? I'm up to 52 so far, but don't want to go bankrupt spending all my money on bolts.

He gets sentenced on June 19th. There are no charges against him in regards to his best friend being murdered. He has been doing a podcast called PKA for years with Woodysgamertag and MurkaDurka before and after the incident if you want more content, not at all work friendly but absolutely hysterical.

Yea and bump it up a notch with options
---
His defense is most likely not quested. So no he cant. 
---
You could make this a pure F2P account. Not sure I'd Dslayer would put you over 40 Defense. But if it does. Keep it at whatever it lands at. Train atk to 40. Str to to w/e or 99. Range and mage into the 80's. Other than that if you're wanting to make a p2p pure account. It's time so start over.

I will say - slayer improved an incredible amount for me once I got 100 combat and could use Duradel. Nieve gives out such shit tasks, but Duradel is way kinder.

What's a good setup for training range in NMZ? I'm about 63 range right now and would love to AFK some levels but don't want to break the bank. Would broad bolts be a decent choice?

1. Does anyone know how long the summer special membership promotion lasts, as in what day the deal expires? Couldn't find anything on the page itself 
---
2. Thinking about doing Jad on my fishing alt so I can move from Anglers to Infernal Eels. Will probably afk 75 range at crabs, is it also worth getting my defense + prayer up? I'll probably be using blessed d'hide so I won't need 70 def, but wasn't sure if I'd get mauled by the rangers/healers with low def. If I decide to do fight caves at 43 prayer, how many prayer pots should I bring?

You don‚Äôt seem to get that operating profit isn‚Äôt the same thing as net profit. It‚Äôs what they get before taxes, reinvestment, bonuses for employees of the company (not the executives of the parent company), interest on loans, etc. Just the interest on their loans is about 3 million a quarter btw.
---
At the end of the day, the investment group that owns Jagex is getting maybe 10 mill out of a game that generates 90 mill in revenue. That is totally acceptable and indicative of a good corporate structure. 
---
If you want a shittier game though, by all means continue to point out how they are taking too low a percentage of the proceeds.
---
Stealing the gold away? Lmao dude he fucking earned that gold. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a competition. Nice to see where your heads at as well. Touch√©.

It would just be another item like ‚ÄúHooded skill cape‚Äù with a separate model when you equip it.
---
It‚Äôs so slow exp for me I get like 20k an hour. At least runecrafting lavas is 66k hour for me. In my opinion it‚Äôs faster to level.

It gets better as it goes on. I'm at 72 now, and I get a lot of cannon-able tasks which are usually 45k-65k/hr. Still haven't gotten any real profitable tasks, but they're supposed to come eventually.

Ugh. Proving a negative is bullshit. This is why you don't tell immigration agents any details about anything. They're basically cops except they want to restrict your freedom of movement for something stupid instead of fining you for something stupid.

who sells gp 53/m? i need the plug

I got mine to 78 then gave up with it lol. Probably going to be my last 99

I got bp and I could sell some gear for trident. My only worry is blowing through gp on supplies.

As a general rule of thumb I stay away from barrows armor due to gp loss over time even though they‚Äôre much much better than most options.

And as an Ironman? What the fuck

Keep the negativity to yourself next time

Any recommended training methods?
---
The amount of gp you get for a kill is worth a lot more than the amount of supplies used to get the kill so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that. To start with only by a few pots and a bit of food then when you start making more money you can buy them in bulk.

I agree, but I also think doing Slayer focused on money making is sort of a fools errands. I'd rather not do demonics that take ages and just block black demons and do fast Slayer and make much better money outside of Slayer.
---
I agree too, I never did profitable Slayer until post-99 where I just wanted to test various methods, but the topic of this post is about profitable Slayer.
---
I use ppots because I get tons of ranarr from farming and slayer and can make enough profit elsewhere to just use them for free prayer restoration.

Oh, and the money lost repairing barrows armor is almost always paid for in the money you save in offensive and defensive stats you gain while using it.  It's hard to track that kind of stuff because it's a lot of "what if, but if you're using the armor to help make money, it's worth it.  You can train smithing if you'd like to lower the cost to repair.  Gold ore at blast furnace with gold smithing gloves if you have money to blow, or dart tips, if you have the tourist trap quest done, for almost even exp per gp
---
Barrows gear actually degrades super slowly while doing zulrah. Im at nearly 250 kills now and my gear hasnt even degraded to 50 yet.
---
Let im in boys.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen it but still got the reference if that makes it better
---
you realise not all of that subscription cash is osrs right? if rs3 has half the players of osrs, that means 1/3 of the sub cash is from rs3. probably even more as the rs3 f2p scene isnt very big, so most of the playerbase is p2p, where as osrs numbers have a huge portion of f2p. still, 1/3 of the profit from subs, plus the mtx, is a huge amount.
---
Lololololol
---
No I made a dollar xD
---
Says the bloke with 700 Karma on a year old acc.
---
Copied from above
---
Every cape would need 4 new models. Both male and female, both trimmed and untrimmed. For 23 skills, so 92 new models. Max cape, music, achievement, and diary cape would also need new models for both.
---
Then every place where the cape can be used would also need to accept the new capes. Like firemaking/max cape in mole cave.
---
It‚Äôs not just as simple as adding another item to the game.
---
Sorry if you get 2 replies, it seems to me like my first one didn't submit for some reason. I'm a bit too paranoid about giving too much information about accounts so forgive me for being a bit vague. Aside from the 75 def at 10hp/1 all other combat skills, no skills on this account are (yet) noteworthy. I have done some (most?) of the skiller friendly quests, along with Shadow of the Storm with its mandatory combat xp reward. I've completed Contact! on this account too, which I'm the most proud of.

Or maybe this isn't a scam and the guy is running 1000 flax spinning bots and his bots need leather from the GE to get 10 crafting..

No need to be so aggressive IMO, the commenter you replied to was only suggesting that's possible, he wasn't saying to OP 'this is fake' or 'totally set up', only implying it's possible.

this has been attempted a lot on this sub, but this is the best execution so far. they look great.

Yes I‚Äôve seen someone post here about them doing that. There‚Äôs also 99 one at a time accounts.

Their afk timer had been ticking for close to 15 minutes or whenever they last interacted with the client
---
I‚Äôm interested bro DM me!
---
Best advice I have is read the wiki. If you encounter something in the game that piques your interest (a skill, a quest, an item) look it up on the wiki. Eventually you'll get the sense of how to do research to inform your playstyle. There are also guides on how to start your account, but honestly it's more rewarding to just explore the game and only look up what catches your eye.

That's insane. I can't even find the time to Max normally.
---
you cant log out during combat, splashers stay in combat. they also dont type or move the mouse. the afk timer for them to log out is always ran out, so when combat stops they wait the last 10 seconds for the combat logging out timer to run out then they log.
---
But god forbid they nerf the prayers

I think he said that he had no plans for genital surgery in a interview like 2-3 years ago. Also, last night he was balls deep in my asshole
---
It depends, are you going to be strictly f2p or members? Either way it‚Äôs advisable you start off as members so you can get a good boost via questing (waterfall quest gets you 30 atk and str from lvl 1) and you can cannon range so you don‚Äôt effect hp. (Do they still offer the free one week trial?) 
---
If you‚Äôre going to be f2p I‚Äôd cap out at 40 atk and lvl strength and ranged. Magic is negligible at best in f2p tbh, but now that teleblock is available that may be something you want to look at down the line. You can splash/teleport/alch to train mage without getting hp lvls.

Did you put in your user details in anything that looked similar to the rs website? Possibly from clicking a fake link from a YouTube video, email, or stream.

Why would we add that? That‚Äôs a horrible suggestion because not that many people use salmon as a food source. We would have to create things for each piece of food. Who would believe ‚ÄúSharkonella‚Äù is a real thing?

Congrats my man!!

this aint it chief

Uhhh yeah it is. Not only is it almost BiS for strength (which is the most important stat for general melee combat) but the defense is still better than the tune chainmain. There is no downside in this comparison.

3) [Charging water orbs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Charging_water_orbs)
---
Yeah thats what i meant
---
There‚Äôs lavas and there‚Äôs library.
---
Atta boy, go grind that 99 out and that‚Äôll be another anchor for you.
---
Careful, i played 9 accounts, 1 main 8 fishing alts. 5 accounts got abnned for botting. I can only assume people mass reported me at fishing guild. play them on different servers.
---
Holy shit hell cat pet??? Take my money
---
I intend to. 99 fm was my first 99 back in like 2008. fm pet was my first pet in rs3, and its almost my first 120 skill, so i'm definitely shooting for 99 in osrs.

3rd Age weapons don't have Defence requirements

rc lvl?

Java has limitations. 
---
It's why the servers start to lag like shit when there's 1.9k+ in a single world.
---
They solved this issue by just having more worlds. However, their servers are still lagging hard for whatever reason...
---
Fair enough points you make. I tend to get carried away on the internet especially if I'm not in the best mood that day. But you're right, 100% unecesary for me to argue like that about literally nothing.
---
  
---
Sometimes I just wanna talk crap on the internet to let out some frustration. Especially considering how you answered the question wasn't even rude, I just twisted it to be rude from my perspective.
---
I apologize for being a hypocritical jerkface :c
---
Did it take as long as your grind to 77 rc to make those runes?
---
Ahhhhh I FORGOT!! D:
---
Sounds cool. Send me a message with the CC info or post here.
---
u wot m8?
---
false, cause even in this movie, he in fact, does get laid.
---
You are correct.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be new here to hate a meme being overused. Heck if there was a daily drama calendar, people would be posting in droves each day for free karma
---
Seeing the same overused joke might be entertaining for some, and I‚Äôm glad for that, it‚Äôs great if people are enjoying it, but understand also that there are people that find this very annoying
---
I'm not sure about xp, you'd have to look at the task list and see what good xp tasks Konar gives. I'll let someone else with more knowledge answer that for you. If you're just looking for the best xp out of any of the slayer masters, Nieve/Steve are the best for xp IIRC.
---
As for gp/hr, Wildy slayer easily wins if you're killing bosses. Without bosses, and depending on your stats, you might have better more consistent luck with Konar.
---
Thanks, I sometimes go out of my way to get offended by things I wasn't part of as well!
---
I think a lot of the comments missed your main question about training range and mage as a melee pure. You can always get 1.5x your range or mage in attack and strength. So you can gain levels without combatting up if you train with no HP methods. Its best to stay balanced
---
Two accounts in that range here... It's not that rare, but yah, it's not something very common. 
---
Going OVER 100B is the rarity... Very few ever see values that high.
---
Thank you so much.
---
Nice original post dude

Saw you a while back grinding zulrah. Absolute unit.

Yeah, I immediately edited my comment after rechecking. Still sleepy...
---
no
---
You dont even know what phishing is wtf
---
Ironic
---
Every time I see someone do this they keep the fire and nature runes dangerously close
---
Like most of runescape just work it out. Get your approx xp per hour and how many chins used per hour. 
---
Divide xp left by hours needed, multiply by chins used per hour. That‚Äôs how many you need
---
Have you done desert treasure? It's a prerequisite for dust devil tasks
---
Runecrafting alt obviously
---
Can someone explain?
---
Get a vertical mouse before it's too late.
---
I just found some sawdust in my underwear, how'd it get there
---
Yeah I believe it is 1 tick if youre using the balls on the cannon, but you can do it in between attacks so you don't miss out on dps. Similarly to how you would alch in between attacks: queue the action as soon as you see the previous attack xp drop
---
Gdz = Greater Demons aka Annakarl teleport in the wildy

And agility I guess.

Is this a thing lol? I‚Äôm kind of curious about the state of runelite . I can‚Äôt tell if runelite isn‚Äôt a secure way to play or the players getting accounts stolen are just dumb and use easy passwords and no 2 factor .

---
Nice pet - not so nice way of obtaining it
---
Yikes idk if he accidentally had Note on when he withdrew all trying to be efficient or he genuinely thought you could charge a noted stack of them. Gz though, that's why you kill everyone, even naked people that flame you after w/ their spade meme on reddit
---
I did only tree runs, hell no for some herb runs. I know how efficient it is, I know how little play time it takes. But I hate chores, I wanna focus on thing I'm doing, I don't want stop killing vorkath or bursting nechs because some trees are ready. I hate skilling and that's why I do it when I have to, with farming I have to do it always between other things, farming is chore
---
Your a wanker, nice for telling us
---
I was too quick
---
My 2005 account is what I play on osrs...
---
Now I can get my RuneScape account hacked and my whole identity sold on the deep web! Yay!
---
This should be grtting more upvotes
---
How old are you, 9? No one past that age would use such words. Maybe you should find a game for your age.
---
Nope, I'm very aware of this scam going around, I dont put my account info anywhere, ever.

It's so common that i'm sensing a causal link between in-game rcing and rl rcing

---
Yup, I know what you meant by phishing now, just a terminology barrier. I have not installed anything on my pc that would create a problem for this account, and not any other accounts.  And I also have never put any info of this accounts email or passwords anywhere online.
---
There's no money in pking when everyone risks dhide chaps and a glory. This dude PKs for sport
---
This is so funny because I met my wife who is Colombian on freaking Tinder while she was here on a work visa, and they didn‚Äôt care... yet Runescape is a problem lol. We did need a lot of stupid papers and shit, but hardly any more than just applying for financial aid at a new college. The worst part was just how much money the whole process was including the lawyer.

What are you missing here? The classic reply was dumb because the top comment is talking about current context "so you are playing". Or are you saying that the comment that explicitly mentions rs3 has nothing to do with rs3?

If you're locked up in a mental ward for attempted suicide, you shouldn't be talking to and trying to help other people who are dealing with similar mental health issues.

Agreed. I was working. I convinced my boss to let me take a break for this. I Tried to come on with rsmobile, but it was already starting as I updated and opened up the app. 
---
After I finished fucking with my authenticator it was an hour too late. :s

I ran from Draynor fishing spot to Falador party room. It was empty :c
---
Grats /u/BenjoRS on 99 fishing! Sad I missed you. I won't miss the next 99.

It's not meant to be a money making method? It's meant to allow people to have a way to practise for pking without the need of a grand master quest üôÉ to access some thing simular.
---
The armor is just a bonus for anyone that gets lucky, I guess if you got a part it would be worth a 1 or 2m each.

Haha kult

I was going to do the same with Prince Ali Rescue. In all my years, I‚Äôve never done that quest, until a few days ago. I was 3 quest points short of the final bosses for RFD so I caved
---
why dont you just well pk to practice?
---
Sometimes I go in and just say hello there when I see it.
---
A lot of gaming platforms have two-step authenticator. It's the standard now.  
---
Accounts don't magically get hacked out of thin air.
---
Why? Because some players will smash you before you have a real opportunity to learn?
---
And when you're constantly losing money people usually give up.
---
This will get people's pray switching and item switching down allowing people to easier enter the PvP to further improve.
---
Tournament worlds exist. Also try making friends to practice.
---
Really? Looks like a kid did it for their 4th grade show and tell.
---
Very cool!!
---
They're open on rotation.

Honestly there's no harm in this.

Ideally it needs 0 people like this, because no one deserves to be depressed and feel a need to talk to someone :(

We already have demonic gorillas to practice pray switching and gear switching.

This has got to be fictional. Nobody enjoys Runecrafting...

Seriously though, nice work. They look great!

Is that a b-enjo party?

Super clever idea tbh, might be onto something
---
Excellent use of your time
---
Again.
---
Locked behind a grand master quest.
---
Do you really think high end content is something smart, to push people towards having to unlock for some kind of low risk/cost way of practicing, especially since that locks it away from the new community who won't tackle that for a long time.
---
I'm not out here to say they are doing a bad job, but there are definitely steps or processes they could do, to do a better job.

For real the most disappointment I‚Äôve felt in a while.

nice i wish she'd step on me
---
The problem is through all of their security measures, if someone recovers your account they can immediately disable your authenticator, log in and take everything.
---
There should be a delay on the Authenticator being removed to give you some time to resecure your account.
---
r/cutenoobs
---
I agree with you. However, I think it is clear from the evidence that financial problems are not the cause of poor customer support. They are not lacking in cash, and the debt they have can be, and probably is being, rolled over.
---
I think the cause of poor customer support is risk aversion on the part of the owners. They are not willing to reduce profits to improve customer support when it is not clear that doing so improves profitability.
---
Therefore, I think the player base is right to create outrage. This can strengthen the argument that better customer service will improve profits over the long term. The players will then get what they want, which in my view is fairly owed by Jagex.

Of course they could, but there's already a 5-10% house advantage so they never really need to. The profit works itself out, that's how probability works over many trials.
---
RS3: 24,636,082+ x*(67,653,172)
---
OSRS: (1-x)*(67,653,172) where x is the % of total subs that rs3 and assuming subs play only one or the other. 
---
24,636,082+ x*(67,653,172)=(1-x)*(67,653,172), x=0.318
---
OSRS generates more revenue if it has more than 68.2% of total subs or 2.15x the number of RS3 subs. This also assumes bonds are considered sub revenue which many people in the thread said it was under MTX.

The box! THE BOX!

---
I suspect these rates on the wiki for ice troll runts are wrong, you're also way above the droprate for rune kite and warhammer as well. I've killed hundreds of these throughout many DMM seasonals (the ones the guards also are attacking), but there's nothing that suggest that kiteshield is 1/64 and 1/128 for granite/warhammer for me either.

When an account gets stolen the person can look up your ip. General location, depending on the isp some of them are locked to one small area. So the hacker can be certain they habe the right information and make stealing your account easier in the future. Recovery form asks for zip code for members, your isp, your state.

---
Completely agreed. Information like this should be accessable in game for people who don't like to use online resources to guide them through the game (minus some ridiculous puzzles in quests of course). There's no reason for the game to lie to you anyway. It should definitely at least show you what is an exception that you do keep on death.
---
That's the point.

Should be going back up eventually though right? The 1/5k from shamans is still the only way to get them iirc so it shouldn‚Äôt crash too far

If it were a newer family guy episode, I'd agree. People fucking love the old shit, you're out of your mind.

I don't have a single 99, but I'm over 1800 total on 2 accounts and one of them is an ironman. Glad to see I'm being well represented here.

Inflation is a bitch
---
Are these the people making bonds 4m? 2 years ago bonds were like 2.3m

My friend had one script running completely deciding what sequence of rolls or a single roll you're going to get and you're not going to believe how many mouthbreathing morons play this game, it got so so many trades but got banned in 3 days.
---
So botton line is these bots are good for weeding out morons from the game and making it an overall better place, not bad.
---
L0l

Oh, nevermind, read over the rune/addy part. Still, don‚Äôt think the reward might be worth the effort then.
---
Holy shit add me if you still play; I'm Elbak on Osrs now.

Inflation has averaged 2.9% since 2007.
---
Therefore adjusted for inflation the gate should be charging 14gp (13.63 as of last year)
---
Diango gives them out for free
---
Yeah but Bob married  another Cat, I'm talking some crazy man on camel bestiality action here.
---
so why not just kill baby blue dragons... or skip the task?
---
My only suggestion would be to move items dropped on death to being directly above items destroyed on death. Otherwise this is fantastic!
---
This makes wildy slayer pointless. Tier 1s were selling for 180k legit 5 days ago and now they're selling for 90k even
---
Good job bro, quality stuff
---
Yeah because that‚Äôll make new players want to play the game more. Fucking genius. Hire this man jagex.
---
Ah, couldn't remember if Zulrah was free or not.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs one of the best money makers in the game. Just when your trying to get 100‚Äôs of millions of gold it can still get old doing it lol.
---
wholesome owOWO XD
---
What about making a runelite script instead?
---
So i personally bursted from 80-85 magic and i think i averaged about 100k xp per hour. Im sure theres more faster training methods, but with dust devils youre gonna be making a slight profit as well
---
How would this work past 20 wild? Would people just risk their infernal cape now?
---
Hey man, thank you for that feedback.  Really glad you got to check out the site and play around with the calculator.  I will definitely keep your idea in mind for future versions.  Cheers!
---
mfw comparing a game to real life crime yikes

Because it's a "good task", and I cant convince myself to skip out on the potential profit.

He want specifying OPs situation. It's evident that man players have been hacked due to poor jagex security.
---
I will name this update - Evolution of Tolling.  
---
I'm already working on my next idea - adding a toll to enter the wilderness. I can't expose too much, but essentially you will be losing some of your gear when crossing into the wild. this will add a new layer of cool yet mathematically controlled RNG to the pking scence.
---
the high octane gameplay we deserve
---
Oof mfw you can't understand basic metaphors

Are you mentally challenged

The void 100+ combat boat would be dead as fuck if you can just pay 1 mil for each piece.

I do a little better with demonics.  Atleast they require counting. (Without the RL plugin) but vork is just bleh, can't look at another screen even, because the second you do, he shoots a fireball in the sky.

I loved this stance personally.
---
Yeah they for sure banged
---
Don't pre-anti venom, use it to cure and get 2 mins of invuln. Ditch the DFS and get an anti-dragon shield, DFS has negative ranged. Pray ranged, sip super extended antifire.

I got muted for that shit on my first account somewhere between 05-07 lmao. Chats logs were ‚Äúselling zezima 50k‚Äù
---
Don't forget the oil money
---
The way I did it take way too long time, it's painfully annoying and time consuming, but I am glad I made it through. If you want to make money, I would suggest doing something simple as mining or woodcutting and then sell the fetch for a price at the Ge. Sure it won't be much profit, but you will get levels that could help you make even more money, It doesn't matter how small the profit is, as long you are doing something, and profiting I would say is the way to earn money efficiently.
---
phishing, compromised info via database leaks and using the same info everywhere, and downloading nefarious third party clients, bought account getting recovered by original owner
---
is how most people get hacked, very very few are just getting recovered randomly as reddit would have you believe...
---
I had a computer next to me lol, not sure. maybe you could go to zybez or runehq and print out the guides, put them in a duotang or a binder ;)
---
Take two doses of what I said for you then
---
Sorry, just checking because I'm curious, what was removed from comp that you disagree with? I'm only aware of the ridiculous 5k CW games being removed and I agree with that one personally.
---
Ez 10m, if I remember correctly

Maybe if the comment he replied to wasn't generalizing ironmen 
---
Try hard next time, thanks.

No, that wasn‚Äôt it. He put an Argentinian flag in his discord name but then promptly showed up to a runefest after party like 2 weeks later
---
Looking forward to even more frustration!
---
RL+ has a notification setting for the overhead fireball, that doesn't solve the purple fireball though
---
I definitely get what you're saying though. Vorkath just bores me to tears. I normally just do some kills and then give up and go to regular blue dragons.
---
also side note, im 62 rc off purely xp lamps and tears of guthix. 
---
(i did have to get 30 by making earth tiaras) but all the diaries and quests will hopefully get me to 65.

You pay the 10 GPA like normal but before they let you through you have to pay #ANOTHAONE.

Mate, these bots have two commands that their maker can type. !win and !lose. They are scam bots
---
It wasn't in the slightest lmfao. He was talking about one specific youtuber who abused it, there's was no generalization at all. 
---
Read hard next time, thanks.
---
While he didn‚Äôt steal money from the company, he caused damages to the game and to the companies reputation, as is evident by us still talking about it.
---
Oof the triggered

Anywhere from 8-12 hours depending on your rng.

I got downvoted to shit when I responded to that news post with "this will take 1 day"
---
Thanks for all the tips bro, much much appreciated! Only thing is that I‚Äôm a poor noob lol. So thought about making some cash with herbs. Tried first time ranarr, but only getting like 5 herbs a patch, so I just lost money lol.
---
Holy shit the irony please read the comment above his.
---
Event horizon levels of compressed stupidity.
---
And then you begin raising her cats and selling them to the chinese restaurant in west Ardougne.

I mean it's your typical boss, first 200 kills or so are pretty fun just cause you're learning the fight still. I'm still pushing through it just for the pet and I want the Slayer helm recolor but it gets mind numbing really quick counting to 3 endlessly lol.

Yes the comment above his asked a question stating whether ironmen could do it. He responded and added on about how one specific guy abused it. But yeah keep pretending you're far above everyone
---
Iron got it at 98 and main got it at 64 :)
---
There are small (5 minute) guides for each role by josephplace on youtube (just look for barb assault on youtube). They should teach you the basics.
---
Rule of thumb: 1. look at the timer and call immediately what the other should do when it changes.
---
2. (Especially if you're attacker) when things change DONT DO ANYTHING until your teammates called it. Else you might do more harm than good.
---
I too love that :)
---
thats the issue
---
Gold ore is on the up. If you love mining get 40 crafting for crafting guild.
---
is she going to let you in so you can pork her?
---
no problem :) i agree with the previous replies saying that this client is unfair but until Jagex makes an official statement on it, people will use far worse clients than this such as AHK clients. The worst that this has is the Zulrah and TOB indicators, however if you do TOB you know that most people actually doing runs are using LyzrdLite or something similar already. This client simply exists to stunt the monetization of custom clients - this client houses most/all of the functions that paid custom clients have, free to use.
---
So it doesn‚Äôt ruin the joke
---
to be fair runecrafting is more buyable than cooking. 99 runecrafting will cost you like 2b gp
---
Please Google the definition of generalizing. 
---
Guy asked if ironmen could do something, and guy brings up 1 guy in 1 event that happened once.
---
That doesn't mean irons can cheat like he heavily implied.
---
I'm sorry that critical thinking was never a skill you learned. I don't have time for this, enjoy forcing the last comment and convincing yourself you somehow make sense here.
---
I truly hope English isn't your first language, because then you have a legitimate excuse.
---
Take care.
---
I added an /s for you.. =)
---

---
What is even the method people are talking about on reddit though
---
Im not trying to hack, im just wondering what you have to do wrong in order to get hacked in this way
---
Because if literally everyone was hackable no matter what they did, then the game would be totally dead
---
Not a problem! Good luck and feel free to reach out if you need any help. The full game has a lot to offer and it truly is a lot to take in. Don‚Äôt burn yourself out either and just enjoy it!
---
One tip, the fairy quests/gnome series quests are really useful so you can get around much faster with the fairy ring system and the spirit tree. Definitely get those knocked out when you have free time so you don‚Äôt have to run all over the map or buy teleportation tabs. You don‚Äôt even have to go that far into the fairy tale part 2 to access the fairy ring.
---
Maybe make it so it doesn't take effect if killed in the wild? A potential hacker could still fuck you over if they were really determined to do so I guess, and you'd be out the items and the cost of insurance. But I imagine most wouldn't bother.
---
Maybe I shouldve added one for you instead

I have had a theory about Gertrude for a very long time. She is not the nice lady she's been made out to be. 
---
In her quest you receive chocolate cake and stew. And when you trade a cat to her, you receive death runes (a hint perhaps, to her nerfarious activities)
---
I think she uses the cats we give to her for her cakes and stews. And not in the cute Ratatouille way.
---
I am using those. And since I switched to anti dragon and got some higher healing foods, I've actually got it down. Just super frustrating if you dont have the right setup/invy lololol. Thank you for the help

For those worried about people using them to pk deep wildy, the price on insurance could vary for pk'ing items like infernal cape or void, and they could be very expensive, while things like graceful, or slayer helmet (i) would be less expensive
---
I saw in another comment you‚Äôre using regular void. I‚Äôm fairly positive blessed dhide will be better if you don‚Äôt have elite yet. Yeah it‚Äôs frustrating at first but once you get it down its really easy. Good luck!
---
There‚Äôs no point in staying 60 defense, you can‚Äôt use chivalry or piety there, it would just be a detriment. If anything, just get 70 or 75 defense

Fuckin runelite man

The thing is, would there be a point to risking void pieces above 20 wildy when they're worth 1m each? I get that void is probably very good at revs but would it really be worth bringing 4m of risk to farm it? One death and you lose an hour of progress at revs. Can't think of other places where you'd use void instead of dhide since they have about equal defensive stats for anti-pking, except the value difference would be like 20k vs 4m. I don't think higher risk in wildy is necessarily bad tho.
---
I'm 90 ranged so I think I'm right around the level where void and blessed are almost evened out. I was told around 90 is when void is worth wearing
---
This looks realy fun with dh. And makes sense, since they change prays after 50hp. Hit the 33 with whip, then boost over with a big dh hit.
---
She always ignores combat level.
---
What if it came from the gnome restaurant minigame?
---
If you risk infernal cape or void and lose 1m per piece that goes to the killer, wouldn't that be fine?

legit player but i was desperately in need of money and also was wanting to quit for good, so i sold some gold from main (less than 1 bil) and there's been like 6 months and jagex didn't banned me, disc buddy said it could take 2 years for them to ban, and they do it with all your accs including iron man, in some forums they say ppl who don't sell much and frequently (my case i believe) rarely get banned and that i shouldn't be worried but i'm playing casually rn bcuz if i do get banned don't get much salty lol. but yeah its a pretty good acc, i already feel sorry for that mistake.
---
I mean scams happen daily sadly. can't count the times people scammed a tbow and stuff in raids. While I do feel sorry for him, if people posted every scam there would be 50000posts per minute. it's the sad reality of osrs

Honestly dude I'd just make a new account if you want to get into PKing. Pures and zerkers/voiders are where it's at.
---
Finishing that quest in rsc to be able to pass through there for free was a big deal.
---
Funny thing is it probably takes like 10 minutes to walk from Varrock to Ardougne.
---
How would it work i  deep wildy? Its hard no from me if you can re-buy insured untrades after dying i  deep wild. If you cant, the whole idea becomes pointless as any hacker can just tele to kbd and suicide so you lose them anyway
---
Also what would happen if you dropped a void piece? Could you then buy a new one, and pick up the previous one?
---
This is one of those "sounds nice but does more harm than good" things imo
---
This is probably the dumbest argument I've heard in a long time

Bruh this is r/2007scape

I dint want to smack a jmod lol, I just want their cooperation

I should really see exactly how long the average BGS spec reduces kill time and see if it's worth bringing for the increased banking frequency. I bring a 5 way switch for BGS, two specs usually put me around a 1:30-1:45 first kill. My spec usually isn't regened by them, so I'll start the next fight and do a really fast swap &gt; spec as soon as the meter regenerates. I'm still trying to figure out at what health it's worth doing at and if it's worth losing blowpipe hits for during standard phase. I feel like it is worth doing if I swap and spec within 3-4 game ticks, that's tough though and part of why I still find Vorkath engaging

Luck is part of any game, so good on you!
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that, as of now, almost nobody risks 1m or more PKing out in the deep wildy. Even at 1m, it‚Äôs a very niche market for people that would be interested in a guaranteed loss of 1m. A lot of these guys are going to be the ones already risking whips, ancestral, ahrims, bandos, etc. In other words, the gear most of these guys would already be risking is massively more OP than the difference of an infernal cape to a fire cape. 
---
Hell, I have trouble seeing why you‚Äôd use an infernal cape over like a mage arena 2 cape in deep wildy anyways.
---
Dude looks hungry for some redberry pie

yeah i just put them up now, he should be banned for this please share bro

there's no way for anyone to know if you are using a plug in or not. demonics have a plug in that do pretty much what a hydra one would, and are just as much gp/hr.

It is also very simple just to run a VPN bot then cry about how you were hacked and should get your account unbanned which is why this whole system is messed up
---
Nice call lmao. You all done with zulra then?

&gt;some deeper account security options
---
ohh idk like 2fa? the thing you didnt use?
---
stop blaming jagex for your own stupidity, its not their job to protect every little detail to your account. its an impossible task that no other company does.
---
Haha nice.
---
Actually he just took a trip to the makeover mage
---
Exactly and it takes all of about 2 minutes to run a VPN pretend to hack yourself and start botting so that once you get banned all you have to do is say you were hacked and you get unbanned. It is just a way to bot with 0 chance of ever losing your account

It‚Äôs over for duracells

I remember doing WT on my account while I was fairly new, I got a pyromancer top roughly 10 crates in and died with it on, and being a new player I assumed I lost my items on death and didn‚Äôt retrieve it, something like this would‚Äôve really helped me out
---
thats not the point
---
i have to bank eeeevvrything im doing and drop everything to do this 1 clue step. yeah you dont risk shit, but it wastes like 10 mins.

with elites or meds i can just grab a spade in my house on the wall, and go to town.
---
did you have 2fa on your email?
---
I mean.. it would just be really laggy and pointless to play as everything would be overcrowded
---
I think I tried it once but it started off with a bunch of non osrs related banter like vacation stuff or other nonsense. That really put me off on it.
---
makes it less effort
---
I find it more amusing to have those with OCD go nuts over this.
---
its on by default
---
Explore for like 2 mins, there are just in a house in western hosidius

I think jagex tries to revert your account to the way it was before the ip change to the hacker (or vpn), but I  heard about that a while ago, they might not do it anymore.

its how many times they've hit, because they switch every 3 attacks

At least its better than $11 crabs
---
They don't and they can't really because the only way to do that would be a full server rollback so everyone in the game would lose 3+ months worth of progress so that op could get their account back that they failed to secure I am sure everyone would be happy with that outcome every single time someone doesn't secure their account.

Just make and sell them yourself not that hard. I mean you just took the skill icons and put them in a hoodie don‚Äôt get mad if someone else does the same thing.

Those holes on the converse are so they can make the shoes more fitted, no idea what that last one is for.
---
Ive been slaying alot recently and hard clues trigger me. Every clue without fail has 1 wildy step. I have to rebank everytime to swap out gear and inventory for what im willing to risk. Pkers are rarely a problem though i did have so run ins with some maxed tribrids (who sucked btw). It just wastes time, my best clue was 120k this far in the last dozen. Im risking more than what its worth most times.

I didn't use that on the extremely rare chance that someone else logs into my account as soon as I log out. Some people just don't want a bank pin. What else are you expecting to hear? Lmao.

Dharok's is only useful if you have the full set, as well as a high hitpoints level (90+). You're better off selling it.

How would that work with dying above lvl 20 wilderness? it would either mean you can't lose untradeables at all or that you still lose them above lvl 20 wildy no matter what.

Obviously the title was sarcastic and I was referring to the toxicity in the osrs community. Never said I was upset nor was I complaining about it though.

Lmao yeah and I work it security for a bank I know how to exactly secure and account and know I won't get hacked. If you actually did work in security you would know that short of someone hacking all or jagex as long as you use proper internet security your account is secure. In the event of jagex servers getting hacked their are much bigger issues than my login info so yeah my account actually is secure. But please explain to me how someone is going to get a unique password and email that is only used for rs and on top of that get into a seperate email used for authenticator that has yet another completely unique password and 2fa so that they can remove my rs 2fa. Please if you you know how to do all of that let's see it since it would have to include mind reading powers and you could make a fortune with that kind of technology. I will even share that my rsn is tree_im and my main is tree_park since people think you can get hacked for sharing that info let's see it since now you know both my usernames and can use your mind reading powers to get into my accounts I am really worried. Oh wait you cant get in even knowing my rsn because my account is actually secure.

---
Basically you want high ass Ranged Attack bonuses (so you hit) and as high as possible Prayer bonus (so you lose less Prayer points).
---
Your inventory should consist of 2 Ranging potions, a stack of Purple sweets (however many you can afford), and the rest of the inventory spaces need to be filled with a combination of Saradomin brews and Super restore potions (depending on how much you need to heal/restore prayer). I would take like 2X more Saradomin brews than Super restores and just reassess how much of each potion you need after you‚Äôve been to Wave like 50+ once or twice. 
---
It‚Äôll take you a few attempts, which is fine, because each attempt makes you better and better.
---
I got to Jad a couple of times before I killed him, and the time I beat him I used the method where you exit and re-enter the Fight caves until you know that Jad is going to spawn south of the Italy rock. It‚Äôs super easy to pull the healers over safely that way. If anything I said is confusing, it would be 100% clear if you finished reading the Wiki page on the Fight cave strategies and watched a couple of guides by popular YouTubers (like EVscape).

I don't agree with *either* of these changes. Being able to kill bosses is a major part of the game and definitely fits within the paradigm of a "completionist". Removing that req simply panders to the lazy folks who never bothered to try and re-comp after the releases of bosses like Solak.
---
The removal of the Castle Wars requirement brings an extreme devaluing to the Trimmed Completionist Cape because it effectively invalidates 500-1,000 in-game hours spent completing it. Honestly, the more people that said the req should be removed, the more I wanted the req to stay. It stood as an effective gatekeeper, a barrier to such a hugely prestigious cape. It was a req well over 1,000 people had already done. While I didn't mind the Livid Farm Nerf since, well, that was just a weekend's worth of time taken away, this is **much** more significant. To me, it just spoke as Jagex rolling over and saying "Fine, if you guys really want it, we'll make it ezpz to get." I was just annoyed to see an accomplishment I held in such high regard, a cape I treasured, be reduced to a mere shadow of what it was. Just my two cents on the whole situation.
---
For what?
---
cant you just click bank all worn items then withdraw black d hide, d scimmy, glory then you're ready. thats what i do.
---
Just think if u bought 1,000 bolivar back in 2005 u'd now how 84,000,000 bolivar! Absolute stonks
---
They already did everything though. The account was botted on and got banned accordingly. Account security is the players responsibility so if you let your account get botted on that is on you not jagex and they responded accordingly.
---
I just buy mine for 40 cents a piece.
---
Just cannon ogres in the Ardy training grounds... they have more HP and never need resetting.
---
Yeah but then the business says they changed their business strategy after being questioned about it and it made them think about it.
---
Yikes
---
I feel ya, 8.5k dry 3 curved bones....
---
Im over paying for every item.
---
When you trade me one, i offer you a tele tab for it and say my main will buy it at this location.
---
Hopefully you take the tablet forgetting about your item in the trade.
---
I‚Äôm just bracing you for the fact that getting a 99 is a very very very long process so don‚Äôt get discouraged. Magic can actually be one of the more AFK skills so long as money isn‚Äôt a major issue. Which I‚Äôm assuming it isn‚Äôt since you chose magic lol
---
I always get crap stuff
---
But then you make it MTX
---
Shit idea cunt
---
Awww pretty nice

How can it work for torso or void?

Does the level of an enemy affect the best dps setup against it? I read that magic shortbow + rune arrows is better dps than rune crossbow + broad bolts, but is this the case against everything, or just stuff with low defence?
---
~1/6000. Depends how many rolls you got on the clue though.
---
I'm over 2k kills no claw or pet atleast u got the dam pet!
---
you have your old character now playable on RS3, you would have to start completly fresh on Old school
---
Im ass at pking so I made a low lvl f2p acct to start learning with. It's pretty fun except a lot of people safe above your max hit so it gets frustrating
---
If it's not one of your protected items, then yes, it'll get unimbued.
---
Yeah, what would you do without 20GB of untradeable item screenshots
---
Pretty good video, the fast forward symbols were a bit offputting though.
---
Difference of imbues. Ones done by a scroll enchant purchased from a vendor. The other imbues that apply to your slayer helmet or DK rings cost time and some combat skills to attain. That's the difference between a ring of wealth imbue and my nightmare zone imbues.
---
Range attack is accuracy, range strength is max hit
---
Happened to me aswell years ago, even if you can prove the IP isn't yours you're still fucked that account is gone I'm sorry mate
---
Thanks man! Would you mind tagging some mods so this can get attention? I'm not too familiar with that process!
---
The original idea for runescape was for it to be a graphical MUD. Thats why Runescape feels so unique compared to other MMOs. 
---
Part of that includes consequences to deaths. Not just mild annoyances.
---
Just like "strength" affects melee max hit, "range strength" affects range max hit.
---
The number you're seeing is range accuracy, which works just like melee accuracy - it only affects whether you'll hit or not.
---
Not many pieces of gear give range strength. Among those are ammunition and certain end-game pieces of gear like Ava's Assembler and Necklace of Anguish.
---
Most of your max hit is going to be determined by your range level.
---
Then you're taking to the wrong people. On top of making the game overall more thrilling, it would also significantly help the economy.
---
Oh, well turn me sideways and fuck me silly
---
Use that extra 1gp profit to seal off the area where most people sneak into the desert .
---
Dragon/wyvern bones at chaos altar. Suicide if you're afraid of losing money but noted is way faster.
---
Sweet! Appreciate it, man. Is there any chance you could tag some mods so they can see this suggestion? I don't know too many of the mods' Reddit accounts.
---
Don't play dumb on your flex m8
---
I was going with the mind set to start from scratch, so you say runescape 3 in the original game?
---
Still love going there, was super nice to literally afk while helping customers and pretty much the only thing I can do while studying.
---
Runescape 3 is the after original, you want old school runescape.
---
Because you prefer children?
---
My friend got hacked and tried to appeal but Jagex didn't do shit. Their customer service is beyond terrible, it sucks because he refuses to play the game now.
---
This one has lost it's sanity.
---
Why make it mandatory when my account is secure? It's nice to have the option but I just don't want one
---
Make a new one where ure grabbing her butt
---
:joy:
---
But why the crabs
---
Lmao, so just only take subscriptions from bank accounts? Creditcards are a dumb concept.
---
So, is the old school runescape still active?, do I just look it up at old school runescape?
---
Are we all discounting the demon butlers making absolute bank
---
I want it :^) then I don't need to buy one for the cerb grind
---
It was my turn to repost this

Right click your alch spell . You can set up a warning message.

Hey i'm rewatching my TPB show and this episode reminded me of al kharid.... Gotta get those useless internet points before somebody does
---
Didn't know it was a repost :c just threw it together in paint.net
---
But it isnt the guilty until proven innocent approach he was already proven guilty case closed end of story. I am not saying ban every account with strange stats until they can justify why they have those lvls now that would be guilty until proven innocent. Ops account was caught botting and got banned it is guilty there really isnt even anything to discuss
---
If I knew how to I would. I'm a filthy casual and p much a lurker on reddit lol.

It looks like you did a few comments above tho?

One of my favourite FeelsGoodMan moments is when you help out My Arm to finally get his tubers farmed.  And I love every time I visit my patch, just seeing him pottering around and exclaiming over the state of his patch.  He is such a wholesome little troll who has found his little place in a big world.  If you could capture this for me, I'd probably cry on you :)

What‚Äôs so bad about untrimmed wc?

Rock cake too right?

Does a higher fletching/firemaking level have any effect at wintertodt?

---
People from Venezuela also play this game.
---
Also it‚Äôs not set in 2007 it‚Äôs just old school
---
Yeah I know easier to say 15% on a avg than put the formula
---
Check out oldschool tools calc. It‚Äôll give you a rough estimate. I‚Äôm doing rune from 88-91 and it‚Äôs around 12-13m.
---
How long would you recommend I boil my denim for?
---
I‚Äôll just write what I‚Äôve written before:  
---
‚ÄûThis cave still gives me chills. Underground pass quest had it all: spiders, traps, witch, demons, dead unicorn, fallen knights, dark magic, dwarfs, secret truth (here I mean the questline with plague being not real).   
---
Frankly speaking this quest has more plot and adventure than most of nowadays movies or games.‚Äù
---
Looool
---
That's fair they talk about what the did irl and in game then news and a few other things
---
Super fast though. I use the zoom region function on my phone to do them
---
I loved conquest myself but it wont likely happen without a 2011-2012 server (not likely at all either). This sub will just reeeeeee at you and tell you to play rs3 like when people suggest dungeoneering or summoning (despite being pre-eoc as well).
---
Or some people getting cannonbals for 1gp
---
the God level stuff is all stuff you've worked up to :) Nothing I hate more in MMOs is where you save the world in the tutorial.  The thing that kept me going in OSRS (and RS back in the day) is when you start you know you're a weak little schmuck, and the journey as you grow in strength into a *someone* who can eventually take on gods.
---
I can smell his computer chair from here
---
Did you get offended or something? If you are 75 range you should know the name.
---
also the adrenaline of people surrounding someone about to get KOed
---
I remember all the excitement of people swarming over a dead player's loot
---
Wut? An UIM without looting bag?
---
If you bot for xp gain you have 1 chance, you get a moderate botting ban.
---
If you bot again you get perm.
---
For an account to be perm banned on first ban it was used for goldfarming. 
---
Doubt its OPs fault.
---
Depends on the purpose. If you‚Äôre trying to eat the denim I have found a slow boil for 2 hours makes the most tender denim. If you just want to shrink the product, then only 20-30 minutes.
---
I wonder what color his poop sock is
---
you can do all the math yourself. at most you get a 3 kill trip or 2 kill on average before needing to bank for more food with the blowpipe method. on a 2 kill trip you will get 2 specs on the first kill and 1 spec near halfway through the 2nd one, and none on a 3rd kill if you get that far before having to bank.
---
The math and dps calculations on how long on average a kill takes with 0 stat drain vs 2 bgs specs has already been done somewhere and anyone can do it themselves. As well as calculating the time it takes to PoH tele, use pool. frem boots 4 back and return to vorkath. The amount of time in the kills saved from having 2 bgs specs every single kill as well as being able to sustain consistant 3 kills+ before having to bank for more supplies is less time spent than never leaving and doing dps on vorkath when he his at max defense levels.
---
It's not just my opinion. Feel free to look into it yourself as there is plenty of information on efficient vorkath. 
---
Just for a rough idea: With 0 defense drain max gear blowpipe with addy darts you're doing 8.7 dps. 2 DWH specs or roughly 100 damage dealt with 2 bgs specs your dps increases to 11.8. Thats roughly 35% more dps assuming you are killing the boss around 2:00 without any defense drain you'd be saving around 40 seconds which is  more time than it takes to PoH tele, use pool, fremmy boots back and re enter. (idk the exact time but i'd guess around 20 seconds is what that takes) You also can do consistant 3 kills or more before having to restock due to healing and refilling prayer with your pool.
---
these are just rough numbers and aren't near 100% but its an obviously better method with an sort of logic used. EXACT information does exist if you wish to look into it further.
---
Sure did! Cheers mate
---
nice
---
It is his fault for not securing his account though. Account security is the players responsibility. Same way if I let my brother bot my account I am still help responsible because the account is my responsibility
---
Ah yeah I like that, since that's how the current interface is. Thanks.
---
It could be brown or greenish-brown
---
no the boots (holy sandals, rangers, and wizards) are seperate from the rare drop table its 1 in 128 for a pair of boots while the rares are on a differrent table
---
Yeah I dislike training agility enough on one account thanks
---
First link when you google "runescape appeal ban" is the link where you appeal the ban
---
He only attacks while you have the diamonds normally, but there are bugs that he still appears
---
I have 64 range and I'm training on Sand Crabs. Should I use rune cbow with broad bolts or imbued msb with rune arrows?
---
Yes! Omg yes.
---
U can get 40 range and mage.  40 times 1.5 =60
---
These things are the bane of my hardcore. And all I want is a msb.
---
Like 99% of the time someone mentions toxicity, it's to conplain about it, to further the idea that the community is acting in a way that this person disapproves of. No you didn't complain directly, but my god man everyone knows what the intwnt was
---
"I didn't technically --" doesn't hold up, unless you're gonna say to me, with a straight face, that you *unironically* enjoy this behaviour. And considering we're on Reddit, the site with the largest amount of crybabies on the internet bar maybe Twitter, I'd say the odds of this being the case to be nothing shy of zero

You would have loved our underground pass drop party
---
ok..
---
I understand now, you're totally ok with punishing victims. That's a warped sense of justice you got there. 
---
If getting hacked by itself isn't enough to motivate someone to update their account security, then any other punishment like banning the account probably isn't going to motivate them to do so either. It will only push them away from playing the game altogether.
---
But that does not make your account any safer than someone who does have the 5 minute thing on.
---
Nope just the bones. But using the chaos altar is much better, it gives the same xp as a gilded altar but saves your bone 50% of the time, so it essentially halves the cost
---
I had like 2k+ kc before runelite was a thing, and the overlay makes them a joke. You have to pay less attention and you make fewer mistakes. Wondering why this is in but no hydra plugin or zulrah plugin
---
More afkable

very impressive! you should mod at r/iamverysmart

So like i said, you could've came across an item rwters were using to avoid detection.

Could you explain what happened? I cant find any info on the exploit.

---
It does not make sense that the average value of a Hard clue is less than that of a Medium clue, despite the fact that Mediums have a high deviation due to ranger boots carrying most of their value.
---
Elite clues have comparatively low value for the amount of effort required to collect and complete them. It is even more baffling considering that Master clues can be obtained at a faster rate than elite clues by completing the lower tiered clues.
---
Haha, it‚Äôs funny because the name of the slayer master ‚ÄòDuradel‚Äô is similar to the name of the battery manufacturer ‚ÄòDuracell‚Äô. So by combining images of the two this automatically makes it comical.

Ever been to world 2? Multiply that by 200

Yea but your comparison is assuming he's a detriment. If he's a support and goes 0/2/5 in league he's absolutely not doing alot but the fact that he assisted in 5 other kills and didn't die 5x means he's having a positive impact. Would a Challenger/pro support do better no doubt. But most friends aren't pros.

---
I didn‚Äôt want to call you dumb, but holy shit. Funny that you called me a hypocrite, but called someone else out on their comparison and then made multiple really dumb ones. The fact that you think having your account hacked and using it for botting is the same thing as murdering someone and saying you are sorry is incredible. How did you think that was even close? I‚Äôm an truly baffled by how ignorant you are. It‚Äôs almost cute, in a sickening we feel bad for you way. Good luck in life, you gonna need it. I‚Äôm not gonna argue with you anymore. I really love a good debate and some wordplay, but I‚Äôm not getting it from you, so have a nice day. 
---
u/pkilljonny I don‚Äôt know what will end up happening with your account, but if it doesn‚Äôt get unbanned AND you feel like playing OSRS still. Send me a DM and I‚Äôll give you whatever I can to help you out. Im pretty poor, but I will help you get started in anyway i can.

So he makes one mistake with his account security, therefore he, completely contrary to all the other accounts he lost, deserves to lose all the time he put into his Runescape account? That doesn't seem fair to me. I'm sure you would be holding that opinion if you were in his shoes, wouldn't you?

So someone steals your car and kills someone with it its neither their fault or yours but your cars?

Third image: on top of what you stated they are also for an alternative way to tie laces. It is called *Bar Lacing* and makes the shoe tighter around your feet. When Converse ruled the basketball shoe scene back in the day you would see pro players utilizing the bar lacing method.

I don't think they are even close to similar but that was what the person said so I called him out on his bullshit pointing out how wrong he was. I was actually the one who was pointing out how stupid his point was by saying that so you probably should be calling the other person stupid since he was the one who thought they were the same thing until I pointed it out.
