Imagine actually saying what you think instead of being cryptic and annoying and acting like its other people's fault if they don't understand what you're saying.

Take my upvote you clever person you!

Highly doubt they‚Äôll drop a poll anytime soon. They‚Äôll be releasing a new blog post with changes to the skill based off player feed back. I doubt we will see a poll for another 2-3 months tbh
---
[removed]
---
Yeah. I had like 300kc as zerk. About 95% of the kills were on mobile. Its not big of a differece vs main when u are using blowpipe I think.
---

---
This is my main acc, and once I did pray for rigour, its not really different at hydra tbh.
---
Imagine how much space on his computer it would take up to record everything he does in the game

That‚Äôs pretty much what this is. Why not both?

Blizz doesn't just say you're not allowed to use an addon anymore though. They go out of their way to break it so you can't use it anymore.
---
&gt; A town without even a bank, which is where most of the poll booths are located.
---
Hey would you look at that! You answered yourself. Weird that a town without a bank functions differently than all the other towns that have banks. Its almost like the Fremmy town is supposed to be an "old" town that hasn't kept up with the world. I wonder how that could be exemplified? Maybe like, if you couldn't use the stuff in the town unless they have already accepted you?
---
&gt; That and it shouldn't even be tied to lore if it's a tool for players to vote on content
---
Dude. Holy shit. **It. Is. A. Joke.** Get over it.
---
&gt;something that exists outside of the world's lore
---
The poll booths? We are literally having a conversation about how the lore ties to the poll booth. NPCs literally refer to the polls. They do not exist outside of the world's lore. I know osrs is *primarily* based around medieval lore, but we step outside of that box here and there.
---
&gt; and the other poll booths I mentioned are in stupid places lore wise that make no sense
---
What is the lore that doesn't align with poll booths being in any of the places you listed? I am curious.
---
&gt; so why make the lore exception for 1 specific booth?
---
Well you see...there is this thing called a joke...
---
things cant go worse,they are starving , they are in a dictatorship , and every day less people support maduro, this isnt going to be a BRUTAL CIVIL WAR , write this, maduro is going to be alone in some time ,he cia doenst need to enter venezuela ,venezuelans are going to end maduro dictatorship
---
Your just being a dick
---
Yes it‚Äôs dumb
---
In Albion online fishing is like this, and it's terribly exhaustive for a shit reward. If runescape was like this, I'd rather get 99 runecrafting twice and then kill myself than fish.
---
Your name matches the clue reward.
---
Real talk though, just think about what "crafting guild" entails. Like, some people are so good at setting gems on metal they need to form a whole guild over it? Really puts into perspective what a non-skill crafting is.
---
Wait you waited out the sara brew debuffs instead of just sipping a restore?
---
God gless your soul
---
Ah true that, didn't think of that.
---
But the Geneva mechanism would probably work just fine for this little cannon, it's not like the big cons of wear &amp; friction are going to be a problem with this thing running for a few minutes :P
---
Awesome!  good job
---
Did you have a mage switch? I know the nibblers have negative mage defense but I found myself splashing a ton when I tried with justicar
---
Guy who can't prayer flick whatsoever here:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I don't give a shit about prayer flicking, if you can do it, awesome. If not, get gud. 
---
Keep it in the game.
---
Once again you've made a mind blowingly stupid comparison. Good job. Just gonna block you now lol.
---
Wouldn't the cost of prayer potions eat into your profit more than the slight decrease in dps from using an anti-dragon shield?
---
Thank you! :)
---
I'm not good enough for that, but it's possible, it just takes some skill with a mouse. It doesn't even compare to being a super athlete who has to be genetically perfect to be at the level of Usain Bolt.
---
Who‚Äôs the hopeless creature?
---
:p
---
I literally just told the whole osrs redit community that I needed 256 attempts before I got the cape, what part of that makes you think I'm bragging about how good I am?
---
I know ancestral is better for the long run, I will 100% go for the pet once I've got a tbow. Since that's also great for the long-run. And I will use ancestral since I know how to get to zuk with ancestral.
---
You probably think of me as a guy thats just running around the inferno like a chicken without a head, but the only thing that directly makes you think that is the justiciar. Every dude doing inferno in justiciar is just a chicken without a head. 
---
But come on do you really think it's not really difficult to zuk 15 times in a row, even with justiciar? 
---
As for the many many attempts it took me. I started the inferno not knowing how to prayflick at all.
---
okay cool, thanks. 
---
I guess it's nice to have an AFK option now too.
---
Why was prayer flicking very clearly not intended in the 'original' design (ie, that the person who coded it intended for it to be possible to not lose prayer points if you time your uses)? I'd highly assume it was intentional, what edge and order you put a counter in is about as straightforward as it gets in programming video games.
---
I'm totes going to have to figure out how to add cursors.
---
Lol nice try
---
Damn
---
Lmao.
---
What about all the rats that are stuck in endless combat without a way to stop it. Those rats are in a living hell just cause you‚Äôre to lazy to train.

Sure it was a bit over the top but pvming at Woox' level is not something anyone can just learn. That dude is from another world.
---
&gt;I don't understand the topic at hand very well so I'm going to interject my third grade level of understanding to the conversation, even though it's extremely obvious that I have no idea what I'm talking about

Book of law. 
---
Pray bonus and range bonus.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how to play. But it is recommended to not ever bother with a anti fire shield at brutal black dragons
---
It's only useful for fairy rings &amp; slayer. They are not as optimal as a 1 defense for pking and not anywhere as 'tanky' as a 20 defense pure. It's more of a compromise build for people who really enjoy slayer.
---
The first time I had sex with my boyfriend I started crying. He licked the tears off my face and that made him rock hard.

---
Dorg chests were nerfed like 3 - 4 years ago, weren't they?
---
You have to realize that any game where you have to devote hundreds of hours of your life to even be relevant in the PKing scene is going to have neets like this who probably play 18 hours a day, hate their lives, and reflect any insecurity they have onto someone else
---
Do you happen to know how the plugin knows what the incoming attack is? I saw a similar post on here about demonic gorillas and just assumed the npc had a changed flag like a ‚Äústance‚Äù or something that was sent to the client. But in this situation there are multiple mobs in multi zone so attack priority/timing is also a factor.
---
Does the server send info saying what the next incoming attack is?
---
If you really want to mage other tasks, fire wave/fire surge with a tome of fire and staff of the dead.
---
The dps is a bit lower than tridents, but is double the xp and cheaper to use.
---
Battle mage or banshees
---
Yes
---
Jesus Christ that clip was painful to watch. What even is the point of that as opposed to just learning how to deal with a bad spawn?

That was my first thought too but this is funny regardless.

4% for 2 prayer pots per hour (less with a bone crushed) is easily worth it.

What‚Äôs your take on it as of now?

Blowpipe for slayer, crossbow for farming.

omg. haha. yessss.

I can hear the Ice Barrage.

Wait a second

Without serp you just use an antivenom lol

Found within 10 seconds o.o rng.

what do you mean?

Tbow is not the reason he took 256 attempts
---
I agree, we are here to talk about the game and have a good time. It‚Äôs a joke, I get the joke. I‚Äôm not calling for anyone to be lynched or banned. I‚Äôm not calling for the meme to be taken down and I don‚Äôt think anyone who enjoys the meme or dark humour is a bad person. I‚Äôm not upset or looking for sympathy. 
---
I am asking if utilising rape imagery to illustrate how we were all taken advantage by more experienced players and dark wizards is a positive, constructive and enjoyable direction to take the community in. I don‚Äôt believe it is. 
---
I appreciate the time people have taken in writing thoughtful and personal responses. I think this is a conversation worth having because I love this game and I love the community and I want to see it thrive and grow.
---
Nope. But your old account is on the new RuneScape, not oldschool
---
How can you see how many contracts you‚Äôve done? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm at like 30 but still lol
---
Useless plugin, not even pray flicking rigour

Ummm...I didnt know I wanted this...but I guess it was made for me?
---
Why did everyone downvote this lmao
---
Lol
---
Oh good, now it's just about as big as one tent in Shayzien
---
OSRS and RS3 seperated (two different roads) so for 10+ years ago your account will still be 'active' on RS3 but you would need to start from scratch on OSRS.
---
That said you CAN and will be able to use the same login information for your RS3 account. Consider whether you will ever want to play both games at once.
---
Also worth mentioning that if you don't have much information on your account you could consider creating a brand new account. This is also strongly suggested if your other account has ever been compromised.
---
Yeah light a bunch of fires on a wooden bridge that sounds like a fucking fabulous idea.
---
It depends on how much more money you need
---
Because the rates are above what was polled. They should deliver on what was polled.
---
Do you have your game messages filtered, if so; unfilter and see if that's telling you why something isn't working.

If I have a clue scroll and I complete 3 steps but the 4th step is too hard and I drop the clue, when I get another clue of the same tier will it pick back up on step number 4 or will it restart?

Why do you keep multiple herb seeds?

It'll probably be a while, there are a lot of weird capes in the game that could screw with stuff.

you sure you have your blackjack?

Considering we play runescape their is no edumacation to spek of

You still have the levels so not like you lose anything

Is this real?

It will restart

Lmao saddest thing ever

Now do it on legit settings.

---
Anyone want to do some god wars bossing? Im 1 def and nobody wants to

:(
---
I use to do this in RuneScape classic on the crumbled wall in there. It was very low xp/hr like 10-15k.
---
I see you over there, San Junipero.
---
I still don't UNDERSTAND what on earth you are talking about, it's not a matter of disagreement, it's more so that we don't understand what you are saying. Why is imagery of buttrape deplorable but imagery of getting murdered is a-o-k? If anything, I consider the surprise buttsex to be a more censored version of what the dark wizards do to players.
---
Also 5gp/xp tho
---
They changed jewelry enchant to be auto cast during QoL month, but it's very slow.
---
Runelite inventory viewer can show you your changing inventory while in other tabs already, I don‚Äôt see why this couldn‚Äôt be expanded/abused with further development.
---
I made a few comparisons for you

youre clearly gonna get more xp from runners, so you cant poll what youre calling possible rates without accounting for runners, thus the poll was done incorrectly.

Shopman mode ho~!

Yep, Xarpus did get buffed, and now solo TOB is not even possible with the current method.  Idk why jagex did this, or if it will ever be reverted.
---
No joke even some of the 30 minute quests would probably take hours if you do them without a guide.

You would have to gather items individually as you go, bank at unexpected times, have to teleport to unexpected places.

Fuck that lol

Maybe it‚Äôs my love for mobile, but every time I see an awesome drop or achievement on mobile it makes me happy lol. Grats!

That's worthy spending 10 gp

its not, on its own. But every.. single.. hour, your tossing away an ely to get 99
---
I don't really care when they release it.  I'm not harping on them about that.  When someone asks "when will do you expect to have this," and they reply with something like "when I feel like it," it's rude.  I actually don't even remember what update we're talking about anymore.  I'm just replying to these in the reddit mailbox thingy at this point.

Started going for it as soon as I could wield dragon crossbow, starting stats were something like 64 range, 52 hp, 1 defence, 34 str, 44 attack, 52 magic. Bought a bunch of purple sweets, 10 brews, and the rest of the invo of super restores.

As long as your priorities are in order than I think you‚Äôre good. Obviously you could always do something ‚Äúbetter‚Äù with your time, but hey... do what you enjoy in life
---
wasnt polled at those rates, also running zmi wasnt a thing when zmi was around. zmi has double the xp/ess of other alters afaik, so it's really op runner wise.

You can get the same or better rates at lavas but it's massively more effort.

Whilst I have Barrows gloves from RFD so it's irrelevant for me, I had never heard about them being in the loot tables for Barrows chests if you 'talk to Oziach'. Is this actually legit? Do you even need to complete RFD to get them?
---
Yes. I won tokens, but that‚Äôs it. üòû
---
I'm not even the OP, what? You never called me 12... Are you high dude? Go to sleep, you're way too sensitive right now.
---
Yes you can solo, but it will be tough to learn. Prioritize DHL/DWH/Sang for solos. Void is not used for solos. Use dhides for range and ahrims for mage. For melee gear, grab BCP and Maul for tekton. Sell your tassets/kodai for DHL and DWH.

thx, do you happen to know at what magic level you stop splashing as much on ogresses?

Dragonstone bolts? Dragons are immune to dragon fire?

well yeah no shit, but its still less efficient than literally not losing prayer points

Compass, chart and sextant if I remember right. Still did it that way for a long time until I realized I didn‚Äôt need them.

Currently, you can immediately remove the authenticator from your account. If someone has access to your account and email, they can immediately disable the authenticator. Authenticator delay would mean that if you choose to remove your authenticator, it will wait a predetermined amount of time before it is removed. This would give the legitimate owner of the account time to try and secure their account if it has been compromised. Unfortunately, the day that jagex implements authenticator delay is the day this sub will be flooded with posts from retards who lost their cell phones and want a jmod to personally remove their authenticator immediately because they don't think jmods have anything better to do. Just like what we currently see with idiots who want their permanent ironman status removed.
---
It encompasses running rates because you can no longer run :) the poll is right now :) do you not understand that's literally what the fix is for? Fuck you're dense.
---
No
---
tiananmen square massacre
---
Lol there‚Äôs a difference between 8 attempts not knowing anything versus 11 attempts knowing the strats ya cheesing idiot.  I‚Äôm nowhere near Woox‚Äôs ability but I can at least complete the Inferno without cheesing it (0 fucking integrity on your part). Woox did it by day 3 (I watched every stream) and he only figured things out  by experiencing them completely on his own. I watched his successful runs many, many times to learn what to do. You‚Äôll always be a shitter because even with all the resources it takes you 256 tries per cape so gtfoh tryna discredit me when you got a shitty cheesed justiciar cape. Oh and btw I‚Äôm flexing on your first justiciar cape which doesn‚Äôt count for shit.
---
Agghhhhh

It doesn‚Äôt, OP is just going full sped mode

Join the clan chat soa. They will get you sorted out.

I finally got to wave 63 twice now, yet I failed. I had a strategy; however, the amount of multi-tasking is unimaginable. I am unlucky. I will try again tomorrow..
---
i‚Äôd do army knights for thieving, just click on the same spot - the clan chat ‚Äúthievinghost‚Äù usually has someone splashing on the knight to keep it in the same place. just filter the clan by world and go to whatever one has the most people, it‚Äôs usually in east bank just below the market. As for fruit trees, my daily farm run consists of papaya trees and a calquat, papaya trees and a little over 1.2gp/xp i think (don‚Äôt quite me, but it‚Äôs super cheap) and the calquat is like 0.1gp/xp, also do some herb runs!
---
Perfect
---
the poll is made wrong, only correction is to take running into account not removing running :). Is that literally the only insult you know?
---
You don't bring pipe for heals?
---
Why don‚Äôt you guys just make out
---
Ogresses have relatively high magic defence, so it helps to have 50+ magic to stop the splashing. I would recommend doing something like Hill Giants instead until your magic is higher
---
I would like some details on the player created art. If people could just upload it I think it‚Äôs a bad idea because I feel like we would see people using it for nsfw shit or child porn.
---
Or worse, west to east so you have to walk 2 tiles to light the next one

Skip everything that takes longer than bushes and have everything preplanted.

You gotta believe that you're interested in topics and that you have engaging things to say. I'm sure you're fun to talk to irl but if you don't feel that way about yourself it can make it really challenging to hold a conversation. Much love, have a blessed day

Eh, Construction is still one of the worst skills, arguably the worst when it comes to training methods. And every skill released in RS2 other than Slayer are the least popular skills too.

Why does a 7 word post have 700 upvotes

No, because that's not what passed the poll. That correction is only a good correction because it's in line with you wanting an OP training/money maker. Fuck you're dense.

no it wasn't lol, you know how many people quit after december 2007? pre 2007 december pvp was very active have you seen edgeville pk videos from that time? all the deep wildy pvp. It died when the wildy was removed and never fully replenished

that's what i'm hoping for, thanks

Hell, you have to have a career after RS buddy. Diversify your options.

So like.... Idk if this is cheating.... But I mapped my F keys to my mouse buttons on the side. So I can switch between my inv and prayers easier... Helped me learn Zulrah... Might help you? This is just one man's trick.

---
Teleports it's going to be. I'm already sick of running.
---
Honestly this isn't a half bad idea!
---
Just a personal opinion, while Runelite is probably safe, there's a lot of clients that do a lot of grey-area shit that Jagex disallows but can't detect like hitbox markers (otherwise the people using these clients would be banned), and players shouldn't have to feel like their security is compromised to access these features. Jagex should poll the useful features from clients to vanilla, and just ban third party clients.
---
I ask you for a reason, so clearly I‚Äôm threatened by your suggestion?
---
The only prayers I‚Äôve ever flicked are the overheads because they are super op at my level. You‚Äôre suggestion would make zero difference to my gameplay. 
---
That being said I‚Äôm wondering why you want to make the overheads (already op) essentially limitless to skilled players and nerf the other prayers without any reason.

I just want to get magic up fast. I don‚Äôt get enough dust devil and nech tasks. I‚Äôm already 95/99/90 atk/str/def and 95 range. Only 78 mage.
---
Can we poll renaming the Abyss to the "Shit-Abyss"?
---
lol you mean karma points
---
Certain apps can be split screen, I don't think osrs can be tho
---
but you could trade back in zmi days. Also lava running is faster xp/h. This was literally a non issue
---
skipping them still nets points but obviously its way less than before, and for people who want to have points for boss grinds like hydra or god wars then having a bunch of points is pretty huge
---
Hold the clue on you. Drop it when you‚Äôre grinding, making sure to pick it up every few minutes to stop de-spawn. Then when a new one drops, grab it and check the step. This is what swampletics is doing to have a clue continue on different scrolls.
---
Ring of suffering? And do you blood barrage melee/ranger minion after stacking them after kills? These are things I found to extend my trips and I definitely kill more on task with slay helm. More so aviansies than specifically kree tho
---
Pƒõkn√Ω
---
That's the game dominoes, a denominator is a subgroup within a religion that operates under a common name.
---
Runelite is behind the trout beggers to artificially inflate trout prices. Do not be fooled
---
Bursting nechs and dust devils is literally the best mage xp/hr for a slayer monster
---
40 second kills? Okay that's actually bullshitting
---
Don't be so sweaty, my dude
---
So having no prayer is more cost efficient than hawk eye, eagle eye, or rigour?
---
Battle mage skull trick.. that means you didn‚Äôt even make it too the mage arena 2 part lol.. and why not just splash?
---
Literally the worst skill in the game but ok
---
Runelite isnt always 100% accurate, but being 100 off seems a bit screwy. Did you have multiple instances of Runelite open?
---
If i were to die with my slayer helm (i), would i lose the imbue and have to do nmz again?
---
i have no idea. i just dont use the app
---
Probably steel bar smithing as well. BF steel bars is an easy 500k/hr or so with basically no high requirements.
---
I swear kiting/orb walking in league has helped me in many instances in this game. You can really kite certain monsters pretty well in osrs
---
Potentially, yes. When Venezuela started going through their power outage fiasco a little bit ago there were very obvious impacts on the games economy. Someone made a Reddit post comparing the timing vs ge charts and it was a pretty surprising correlation on quite a few items.
---
man i want to spread her ass as far apart as possible and shove my head inside and let those fat cheeks lock my head inside and let her let out the longest fart known to mankind as i have no choice but to breath in all of the fumes until i pass out in ecstasy
---
If you can keep your attack as low as possible. 50 or 60.
---
Well, I do need them sandals anyways! Hopefully I stop getting ranger dupes. literally worth nothing to me lol
---
How long does an average infernal temp take if you get to Zuk?
---
It was around 7% in February 2017 according to [this Q&amp;A](https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyAggressiveFriesShadyLulu), and has only risen since then I imagine with the popularity of Settled/Verf/Caveman/snowflakescape. I think ironmen of all forms comprise around 10-15% of the player base these days. Definitely not 1% though.
---
We should ask Mod Lotte for the newest statistics.
---
Anglerfish for money
---
Most likely because they're trying to groom-lure you. Every time I borrowed my friend's Tbow for some Sara trips and then visit the GE, the lurers would crawl out from underneath the pavement and compliment me, ask me what boss I'm killing and if I've got the pet yet, then they'd be like "Yo, add me?" and 10 mins-few hours of random conversation, they're like "My friend just anti-lured these lurers dude! want to come along?" ...
---
with three combat?
---
Lol. 
---
Shout out to every resource based skill.
---
Yeah, it suggests that there was once an expectation that you would do things like cut down the nearest tree for a fire, and fish up some shrimps to eat on the spot just to live.
---
I didn't think using an extra prayer pot to use eagle eye was worth it. It made it less afk and did not increase the kill speed by a noticeable amount.
---
are you serious
---
This isn't even the 1-tick prayer flicking that has been controversial on this subreddit the last few days.

Might wanna check how Thieving is spelled
---
No, I did it :)
---
Get 70 thieving, get a bunch of spices and stews on you, 1-2 super restores. There‚Äôs a bank upstairs at the tree gnome village, spicey stew till you get it, restore if you go negative, use that one prayer that extends your boosts by 50%, I forgot the name of it, it‚Äôs only 40k on the ge and it gives you 2 minutes of boost time. Stew until you get it with the 50% boost set on your quick prayers and just pick pocket the little dude till you‚Äôre done. It took me around 5 minutes to get the boost and about an hour to get the stews with a lot left over.
---
Just one more stake
---
They wouldn't necessarily have to make the vis rewards static: for example you could have vis rewards decrease after using an item too many times.
---
note: this only works with camera going west to east on the south side, and east to west on the north side.
---
Good idea but 1k mage exp? Lol
---
I'll do it for cheap tomorrow (blew bank on Construction) lol, msg me in game: Stormforge
---
just get 75 rc and run zmi! oh... nvm...
---
pay to go to the island, more 3 crab spots

I actually forgot those teleports at the top of the Magic Guild existed.
---
It prevents your items from being dragged in your inventory, allows for very easy switching

that is weird. also happy cake day
---
No I only vote no when I read remove wilderness ditch because I don‚Äôt want them to remove the wilderness ditch
---
did it count?
---
If they want to play both games at the same time they'll need to create a new account.
---
Questing is necessary to slingshot a lot of skills-herblore, farming come to mind. My eyes kind of glaze over at master farmers, and I'm going slow in my account to keep up the challenge in quests- so I'm at a seed deficit that I might otherwise not be if I had been slaying. Everything just feels like you earned your way there. It's a wild ride.
---
A major drawback is the lack of community. There's /r/ironscape but I've never felt enthused to reach out to other btws. I'm personally thinking about making a pker on the side to smash some heads with cool blokes, so if that's more your speed, just do that instead.
---
Yeah if you and Galvek both died at the same time it will count.  You will just have to board the boat again and the Galvek death cutscene will play
---
wowwwww
---
Does this take into consideration that many ironmen also have main accounts? That obviously skews the statistics. I see ironmen very frequently, frequently enough for it to clearly not be an insignificant portion of the community.
---
did u think this was legit
---
Hemroid city
---
I doubt they‚Äôd be interested in making it any easier, it‚Äôs supposed to be pretty much the most difficult thing in the game

Interesting how you seem to know how most of the elderly are treated by nurses when you of...? How many exactly; who are good?  
---
Or have you only heard tell  
---
  
---
I know two people that work at different elderly care homes. One place, the residents treat the nurses like shit. Other place, the nurses treat the residents like shit. I also know my mother's grandmother was neglected care regularly. Thanks for being bitter over nothing.
---
Andy knights are really good on the phone, just sit there tappin your screen while you do a poo and get good exp, only thing with plunder is that it‚Äôs a lot more click (tap) intensive. good if you can keep up with the clicks, but if you want leisurely training i would go for ardy knights - as for the whacking, gloves of silence and dodgy necklaces will help this, you‚Äôll notice a lot less bashing over ~70 thieving
---
ü¶ÄIsland
---
I think ironman holds a lot more long term value. It can be a little obnoxious starting out without teleports and having to run around a lot  but everything feels significantly more rewarding. 
---
For me I find normal accounts boring as I just end up grinding the most efficient GP/XP per hour methods and it gets old fast. With an ironman every new unlock is a big deal. As soon as you get into the groove of it you'll likely love it.
---
My grind has just begun, thank you!
---
I‚Äôm sorry but why do you know the specific time stamp of that particular stream?
---
Yeah hahah that‚Äôs possible but I need to go to school in like 5 minutes and I can‚Äôt pay for the subscription with my card so I‚Äôll have to wait unfortunately

you‚Äôre delving into it too far bro just enjoy the meme

Holy smokes. Runner are 75 rc req and very skilled or they just normal skilled?

You could get Ublock origin on firefox Android, or you can get an app called youtube Vanced (its not in the play store) which has no ads

I'm sure this is copypasta, but it's my first time seeing it so I love it
---
Not sure why I was down voted exactly, must have pissed off the guys who struggle with fcape since I said it was easy. but yes as mentioned you karil Xbow the waves and use the range of crystal bow to lure healers off jad.
---
Does this make Delrith an inside job?
---
I like doing both things so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs making it difficult but I‚Äôll probably chose ironman since it will feel like more of an accomplishment. Which Ironman do you think I should choose?
---
Okay cool! Thanks very much :)
---
The old videos used to be so good and got fuckton of views cuz of that.

---
Don‚Äôt know why this got downvoted I thought the same thing
---
It changes it for the better. Pre-rework the levels made no sense, the gameplay sucked and the only way to profit was getting refunded bars from rune 2hs
---
Let's not forget that bow drilling exists in runescape which is way harder to start
---
'40-50 seconds is average, my pb is 46 seconds.'

Are you okay?
---
Slayer (and hard clues i suppose, tho ive not had any big loots since my first 10-15 medium clues done) is the only money making method i have done on my acc. And honestly I'm finally pretty proud of my bank. Youre almost at the really good tasks where you start turning great profits from slayer, I.e; gargoyles and above. 
---
Right now kurasks and dust devils are your 2 money making tasks. I suggest bursting your dust tasks too btw. 
---
First things first: start pray flicking and bringing food, also get 70 prayer. Piety is a huge advantage first off - secondly pray flicking early on is what you really need to get in habit of doing until youre making more money from slayer tasks and even then its just a good habit because it speeds up tasks which means more gp/hour.
---
Doing konar is good right now. Keep doing konar until you get 80 slayer id say, unless you complete mm2 before that then you want to do duradel or nieve/Steve because demonic gorillas are amazing gp/hr. 
---
As I mentioned get 70 prayer. You'll do tasks faster which means faster exp and more loot. 
---
Gear. Get your untradeables if you havent man. Torso, fire cape, dragon def, barrow gloves. I did wildy slayer while i trained my stats to the point to obtain these and I made a goal that i wouldnt really start my slayer grind until I had them all. Seriously this one is huge - you'll have max efficiency and it truly makes tasks go faster using slayer helm with max bonuses. Your stats are high enough to do fire cape also quite easily with 70+ def. 75 range and blowpipe with tank helm and legs makes it easy mode. 
---
I suggest aiming for those goals, and have 80 slayer be a goal too. Work towards Doing mm2 - demonic gorillas are fantastic money and thats where ive made the majority of mine tbh. With your stats you wont have super long trips however once you get the hang of them you can kill them without taking any damage other than the times where their next attack is range or mage which is only so often. (You'll understand what im saying once you get there to that point).
---
Summary: get 70 prayer, piety will boost kill speed. Pray flick, save pots + increase kill speed. Gear, get all untradeables to increase kill speed. Work towards doing mm2 to unlock demonic gorillas (black demon task, can't use konar for these). Until then use konar and work toward 75-80 slayer for gargs and nechs, that will be when you really start seeing good gp/hour and viable money.
---
Did u try it from the minigame tab? I think that‚Äôs a different cc, if not you should just make a quick account and do it together
---
What does that mean? The options given in that area only allows you to net or harpoon?
---
Love that skill
---
They might've changed as a result of birdhouses and farming guild over time (since both are time-limited training method) but as of the end of last year, all the RS2 skills other than Slayer were the lowest leveled skills in the game.
---
If the engine doesn‚Äôt know when songs end, how does the loop function work?

Also, music was added in 2004 with RS2.

How does your client look like it‚Äôs in HD?
---
it is heroes quest not shield of arrav, making a 2nd account would take extremely long
---
Not OP, but recently finished the cape grind so I'll answer your questions. 
---
1) Zuk is a test of nerve. It's not that mechanically challenging compared to the waves. The hardest part apart from healers is prob having the ranger on you- unless you're gonna flick, which most people don't for a first cape, you're basically at the mercy of the ranger before you kill him, as although he's very inaccurate he can basically 2 bang you. 
---
2) 3 jads are pretty easy to be honest. I died first trips from nerves, but after that got past every attempt fairly easily. 3 ticks is actually a pretty decent amount of time to switch prayers/tag a healer etc
---
3) the waves are fucking brutal. After my first zuk attempt, my next 4/5 attempts I didn't even make it to wave 60, which was really demoralising after thinking I was so close to the cape. 
---
4) the biggest tip, and it's one that you will hear a lot and you should definitely listen to, is do not attempt to conserve supplies when you're learning the waves! Camp prayers and camp rigour if you need to to get you out of trouble. If you cant trust yourself not to camp your sgs specs then leave it in the bank. The best way to learn the waves is to kill stuff quickly and stay alive. If you die with a single dose of brew left, you fucked it up. Do not even consider your supplies until you've reached zuk.
---
Blobs are little fuckers. I would recommend going to wave 1 and lazy flicking the bat (3t rhythm) until you have that rhythm ingrained, then go to wave 4 and practice 3t lazy flicking the blob, as well as 1 and 2 tick alternating to deal with blob and mage or range. Xzact's guide is incredible.
---
Waves 60-63 are hell on earth. If you can survive them, you can get an infernal cape. 
---
And with all due respect to the OP for really putting in the time and effort to deserve the cape, i would strongly recommend not making his mistakes. He's using justiciar, which is fine when used properly - learning the mechanics of the inferno - but as is clear from OP's number of attempts and the time of these attempts, he attempted to brute force the waves, ignoring mechanics. If you grind the inferno like you would grind any other rs content, and you learn it, I genuinely don't think it's possible to take 256 attempts. Good luck soldier, sorry for the essay!

RS3 is where all the original Runescape characters were carried over to.
---
You can still log in to OSRS with the same credentials as you would to RS3, so give it a shot. I don't think the character will be in OSRS tho, it probably was carried over to RS3.
---
43 sec :)

People already get banned for this, it‚Äôs hitting, wtf is your title.

Probably one person having a giggle.
---
What about Ner??? It used to be my rsn lol
---
Well if you‚Äôre just after the look of it you don‚Äôt need to fill with pages, as they don‚Äôt change the appearance. The pages give each book their stats. You‚Äôre able to buy them though, some are cheap and some aren‚Äôt
---
right in the feels..
---
Probably karils since you'll be using prot range
---
You actually killed 1000 of those? damn didn't think you would actually do it :p

I can‚Äôt remember and I‚Äôve cut my computer off for the night. Sorry. I‚Äôll see if I can figure it out tomorrow.

R-r-r-repost.

Paying 200 dollars a month to have a giggle seems excessive but I‚Äôm about it.
---
Ah, yeah so RS3 is the new one then. I was able to log onto my secondary account on the New RS, and it had all my skills ( no gear though, I could have sold it or something ) but when logging into OSRS, it started me on tutorial island.
---
So I guess I do have to start over. Oh well, it should be fun! 
---
I just wish I could log onto my main account, even in New Runescape, just to see what I had back then, but it somehow got banned for "Macros", in 2015, well after I quit, so I have to wait and see if they will let me appeal the ban. 
---
Man, this day has been a real nostalgia trip looking at all these items I used to have.
---
Why would you ever need graceful in wildy
---
Well, just using the empty ones is a bit of a waste of a slot. I guess I can look and see which book is the cheapest and start from there lol.
---
I like bringing 2-3 guthix rests so you can heal without having to stop attacking. Click on the ground to stop attacking lol
---
This works with many other angles too.
---
I have! But then I'm not doing enough magic damage, I'm splashing so much in the middle melee phases for some reason even though I'm using ahrims and a toxic staff!
---
Huh. I got a notification about a comment, and it seemed to explain everything but I clicked on it and now it is gone and I didn't read the whole thing :\*(
---
Next time tourney worlds are up fly  in there, plenty of people of various skill levels bridding.
---
And who can make any sweeping statement about anything then? Stop being a bloody pedant just for the sake of it, no one likes it and it doesn't make you look smart.

The baby pure was featured in several Amenity clips and posted to reddit. He hadn't even changed his name. It's fair extrapolate that if he hasn't been banned, none of these cunts have.

My in-game name in OSRS is Soramonni so if you have questions later on you can maybe catch me when I'm online.

No 14 with the current knowledge and max gear is not top level pvm worthy,it's close to average The real top lv guys do it in a handful tries. Kind of you to call me a top level pvmer though.
---
Stand against the wall on the southwest side to safe spot everything. When there‚Äôs magers alive, protect mage and prioritize killing everything else that can damage you first. See other guys response for how to kill jad
---
Not really a god cape or ardy cape tbh
---
Ah cool, thanks, I'll save this post! It's all quite overwhelming and I don't have as much free time as I did when I was a kid, but it should be fun to play again.
---
Your name is gangsta, homie
---
Huge achievement, you must have A LOT of experience now. Do you think you will try and learn it ‚Äúproperly‚Äù now that the pressure of getting a cape is gone? So you can future proof yourself for endgame content since you will improve massively as a player.
---
only if you have sotd/void mace, the regular one can't autocast

Setting short term and long term goals is recommended. Everything in your own pace and style.

---
Cool. I will try to get a full set of armor as a short term goal, the prayer book and armor as a medium goal, and getting the Dragon Scimitar and Abyssal Whip as a long term goal. Dunno how feasible any of that is.
---
Gosh, I remember killing rock crabs and getting the granite armor, and maul, and getting gold-trimmed black armor and stuff, so much nostalgia.
---

---
5m/hr and pretty chill
---
Holy shit yea! Then you can use void mage vs vorkath and with a staff of the dead you can already auto cast the crumble spells! Why tf is this not a thing! I'd love to do the qa on this with the magic, to test the magic damage and test if i can kill vorkath obscenely faster than range does. Plus with magic being a long range attack this means you can't woox walk am i right? I'd like to make that might be the swinging factor of mage vs range. Mage you can't woox walk and its that little bit slower but still viable.
---

Why is there some favorable slayer tasks? Can't you kill most of the monsters off task, or does slayer give a bonus of slayer points making the monsters better?

They have exactly the same offensive bonuses, I was mainly curious whether the extra magic defense from Karil's is worth it over the +1 prayer from blessed d'hide but ultimately it shouldn't matter too much

Oh my mistake. Can you explain how Mr SettledDaddy is doing it? Or rather, was doing it?

Just trolling you lol

haha i feel ya

Absolutely none. You can break their script by just flashing d scim and one ticking back to crossbow everytime to hit off pray. They either tele or turn their script off once they realize.

I'm happy about the ending, all I could think was "how the fuck did you already have 5k"

Make sure to make 2 trollheim tabs, you can revert the other one back to house tab once you‚Äôre there
---
Just shows how sad and pathetic your life is tbh.
---
If you use DHCB + dragonfire ward / shield, as well as a super antifire potion, you take no damage from dragonfire attacks.
---
Then you pray range, which leaves the blue projectile as the only one that can hit you (which is magic based).
---
So Karil's is technically better as you're going to get hit less by the magic attack.
---
With that being said there really isn't going to be that much in it and you barely take damage from vork during kills with DHCB, so I wouldn't go buying Karil's just for that.
---
Ign is    zi_Cryptic

Wtf did I just watch
---
I just remember that I'm not an inferno expert, but I'd love to answer those questions. Just take my answers with a frame of salt I guess.
---
First things first, do not start doing the inferno with justiciar. Get to jad multiple first without it, after that you can choose to switch to justiciar if you really want to.
---
I suck at pvm and I did not have a twisted now. I cleared tripe jads first time.
---
If you don't yet know how to do the walk under method to trap the healers behind the jad so that you can bloodbarradge them do fight caves first and just mess around with that had and healers a bit.
---
Do not underestimate the damage of Jad healers, they can hit 15+ consistently and there are a lot of them you have to do the walk under method.
---
As for the other waves. Killing the melee as soon as you can makes it that you don't have to move after you've safespotted all the monsters. That's why I think it's important to kill that thingy asap.
---
The zuk fight isn't all that hard. Just have your priorities straight, always think to yourself stay behind the damn shield. Do not risk stuff for dps.
---
I hope it helps a bit but this was all I could think of
---
Diiiky :)

I agree, they make the game hella unfair. But cba competing with everyone else if they have access to this.

I had fun creating my last render so I decided to try modeling &amp; rendering an Unholy Book. I know the models are quite simple but I am having a fun time making them so I hope it isn't disrupting the sub to post them.
---
Other ideas are better but maybe where the ignore list was? Keep the customer support stuff there, but replace the eyesore icon with a stylised picture of a clock
---
I can't even prayflick moss giants lmfao
---
All clues must be obtained on the same login session (after the first clue), so once you eat your second you have to stay on until you‚Äôre done. Once you have 2+ clues, you can still only hold one at a time, so have to pick up and drop to each solution of the clue. When you complete a step on one, it will count for the other clue as well if you drop your current one and pick up the other. The reason it doesn‚Äôt work in this instance is you must have all 2+ clues ‚Äúin the game‚Äù when you do the steps, or they all reset to step 1.
---
Not really sure about skilling clans other than the top level min/maxers.

For learning raids there's the "we do raids" discord which is all about teavhing new players and learning together, and let you find other players with similar experience to yourself.

Stop worrying about what everyone else is doing and get your quest grind on.

Nothing interesting happens.

In addition to above comment:

You can either listen to the sound or watch the movement. I prefer the movement, 'cause that is what a friend suggested me to do.
---
Also, use the f-keys. F1 to show inventory, f-2 for prayer, f-3 for spellbook or whatever you prefer ;) helps a lot!

13m runecrafting xp from this quest is my suggestion

Oof
---
Im gonna need the first post where jesus did that dharok guy dirty. I remember the comments in there were fire.
---
You sound like one of my colleagues
---
I average 110k per kill (including bones) without uniques. If you get the uniques on drop rate, add 80k/kill from claw, 14k/kill from leather, 8k/kill from Brimstone ring, and 5k/kill from everything else, for a total of ~220k/kill. I average about 1:50 for a single kill with bp and rune darts (99 range, bis gear apart from tbow); add 30 seconds of downtime and 5 mins of banking every hour for about 25 kills/hr. It comes out to just over 5m/hr. Factor in the occasional death or fuck-up and it's just about 5m/hr long term, but the drops are so rare (1/1000 for big ticket item) that your rng will be a major factor unless you're going for 5000+ kills and maybe even then. 
---
Solid task overall, makes Konar worth it after 95 slay.

It's a game coded originally to be run through a browser, over dial up, on some ancient Win2000 toaster powered by two hamsters running on wheels. It's basically the textbook definition of lightweight game, m8. Even RS3 is relatively lightweight, and that's with textures that aren't holding a contest with the polygons to see who can have the lowest values. A rule of thumb is that, in &lt;&lt;CURRENT_YEAR&gt;&gt;, RuneScape WILL NOT max your hard drive, data plan, or CPU load(with GPU rendering on through Runelite, but dw about it). It can be a little RAM taxing in my experience, but less than Chrome or most other games.
---
Is it a reference to something? Please tell me it's a video
---
"No matter the scenario it works the same" is true, but misses the important point. In more challenging combat scenarios (Inferno, Vorkath, hell, _any_ boss or even demi-boss) it becomes so much harder to consistently prayer flick because you have to take so many additional actions in combat beyond merely prayer flicking and auto-attacking.
---
If you can pull off the entire Jad fight with 1 prayer point and no items (as Woox did years ago) that takes so much skill and perfect timing, so much knowledge and expertise. In my opinion it's still balanced.
---
It doesn't actually, **in practice**, "break the game". If it broke the game in reality, it would have been nerfed a long time ago. It's part of the game.
---
Honestly I've never recharged it or used it on regular rocks. Back when the ornament kit came out I thought it was the smouldering stone and did this. Never used it on regular rocks before just blood runes and MLM

EU makes up more of the player base than NA. Stop crying. It makes sense from their standpoint. They're doing their best to be fair to both regions.
---
Yeah I have tbow. It's only really relevant for waves 68 and 69 - at triples you should be fine but jads are really tanky so you have to hold your nerve for a lot longer. At zuk your dps is also a lot lower so you'll most likely get an extra set of mage/ranger. I didn't flick ranger and don't recommend it for a first cape on main - ranger is very inaccurate, and also dies very quickly with rigour and blowpipe. Just make sure you brew if theres a chance the ranger can kill you!
---
Damn, I usually get at least 2 per task lol
---
Why were you not splashing them?
---
So as much as i want to kill 1000 zuks when i get to the letter Z (If this ever happens), zuk will be the last monster to kill 1000 times no matter what. Simply because of the time it takes to kill.
---
There are lots of people crafting lavas without runners

Yo fuck that

The big items for the inferno are tbow, kodai and sgs. All other items are minor (armadyl = blessed hide, ancestral = ahrims, etc)
---
Xzacts guide is fantastic, I can't recommend it enough. It doesn't just tell you what to do, it helps to explain why you do it as well.
---
I feel so absolutely the opposite
---
Quests in RS are what set it apart
---
It's a chore and you always hold off doing them, but when you've got the inventory and are doing them they give the game a lot of character
---
I can't think of a game that comes close to how well quests in RS make the world feel more real
---
Every other game is either like go to the castle on the hill and kill the big bad guy or collect 10 bear asses. WoW's quests are like Runescape's Slayer.

 Contact Jagex.

In 2006, my parents logged on to my runescape account to see if the game was suitable for me to play. They witnessed something similar to this within a few minutes of logging in and refused to pay for my membership.
---
I feel bad for them, I really do.
---
Not really. I‚Äôd stop focusing on your combat level and start gaining levels on skills
---
If you're going for maxing combat long term, stay away from Konar until 95 Slay. Do Nieve/Steve tasks and do the boss variants of certain tasks, especially things like Demonic Gorillas in place of Black Demons (finish MM2 asap to unlock them - fantastic moneymaker even without uniques). 
---
Slayer is mainly just an efficient way to train combat, and not doing Konar allows you to do efficient tasks all the way till 95, after which the Hydra boss becomes a serious moneymaker (up to 5m/hr long term). Until then, do burst/barrage tasks in the Catacombs and you'll get serious magic xp while either breaking even (jellies/dust devils) or making a profit (nechryaels, abyssal demons). Choose to do easy tasks with cannon and you'll be able to afk (very important for long term slayer) a ton of tasks for fast xp. 
---
Slayer offers a lot of good bossing opportunities (DKs, Abyssal Sire, Cerberus, Kraken, Alchemical Hydra) while also giving you variety in PvM. Even if you're struggling to stay even now, the money will start pouring in eventually and you'll also have better stats/equipment from pursuing slayer (and some of the GM quests).
---
I can't tell if this is cool or if I should be terrified.

No I think not, runecrafting needs to stay the low xp chilled skill it is

Eww no.

There's no point to the cape if it's not easily identifiable.
---
I genuinely think this interface is ugly and really don‚Äôt want to be sticking it on everything, it‚Äôs really not hard to right click
---
Use supplies during the waves so you can get to higher waves. This way you get some experience in the higher waves and they will eventually become easier to handle. It's better to get to zuk without supplies left than to die at wave 50 and still have all your supplies.
---
Gl on getting the cape, you can do it!
---
What specifically? All feedback is very appreciated.
---
Fuck me, that's like quadrupled in price since I did it. Only paid 8m for my Torso.
---
Animal cruelty is clearly hunter, I'm just gonna guess bedwetting is runecrafting.
---
Idk how you can think that when Hydra is practically afk till the end of phase 3, whereas Zul and Vork have either random patterns or annoying firewalk mechanics, unavoidable damage from mage/range, and the 1-shot afk checker that is the fireball of doom. 
---
Give me Hydra any day of the week. Better drops all around, just as fast, and guaranteed slayer xp.
---
Reference to that picture of a dress that some people saw in different colors haha, so yea I was trolling

There's understanding that 14m blood runes is absolutely nothing compared to the greater loss.

Nah it's just the sunlight. I was at work so didn't get a perfect picture

---
Hot take: OSRS could really benefit from advanced skills like Invention for RS3. Having high level firemaking/woodcutting/fishing/hunter/herblore could be prerequisites for an advanced survival skill.
---
If the change is a benefit to all normal accounts and hurts ironmen only the change should be implemented. It's a subset of the game and should not dictate the meta for the entire player base.
---
Probably better of farming it and killing hobgobs while they grow, but there's a lot better options for money making than limpwurt roots.
---
my mom always said, ‚Äúthere are poor ironmen in morytania right now who would love to have your luck right now‚Äù
---
These guys are ez, just use smite, smh
---
For those who may wish to peruse them, an archive of all the previous comics can be read [here.](https://imgur.com/a/C41ma) It contains a mix of both OSRS and RS3 comics, but most of them have been written in such a way to try and appeal to both communities

Almost like that quest.. where you go to the wizards tower.. get a key... to fight the demon.. that the dark wizards let out of its realm.

whats the discord?

---
"What did it cost?"
---
"Everything."

lmao
---
So it begins.
---
What is the best option in terms of looting? I wNt to level up (combat 50) but I also need to make money fast because some guy killed me in the wild yesterday and I lost all my armor.
---
haha dumbass
---
This should really be spoiler tagged
---
Same here lol, if I posted my drops people would be mad. Im still a noob, only been back a few months, but when hespori came out I got 2 buckets and sold for 12m total. Im also at about 330 at Demonic Gorillas with 3 Zenyte Shards lol. Hoping my rng continues. Going to kill my first shamans on my first lizardmen task (at almost 81 slayer too took forever to get that task).
---
If you‚Äôre using sounds stop it. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says that shits overwhelming. When jad hovers, use mage. When he stomps, use range. When healers come, tag them all and line them up so only one is attacking you and just focus on jad.
---
Anglerfish no longer heals you over max hp while you are in combat or fresh out of combat, it has the same little delay at the pj timer or logout after combat
---
Ok pretend you're in catherby. If you right click a cage spot there is an option to harpoon. This will catch swordfish. If you right click a net spot the harpoon option under that will catch sharks. Like I said there are a few exceptions to this but most of the time it's the case.
---
Get a quest cape without using guides and tell me how great the stories are.
---
Where are you? Only places I see bots are places I used to be when I was a low lvl player like Varrock mines and trees.
---
probably champions guild?
---
The dudes name was RS3 is shit lol
---
To draw a comparison, it's like how bind and entangle are in the standard spellbook, but the best bind spells are in the ancient spellbook. Crumble undead could stay in the standard spellbook, but the best anti-undead magic could go in the arceus spellbook.

No that's crafting. Imagine a whole new skill to do things we already do, just needing more xp. 80% of warding can be pushed into other skills, adding new content to those skills. Give us science skill lol

This is how you fall for scams.

No. If anything I‚Äôd recommend playing a main to make bonds and transfer them to Ironman. Making money on an Ironman to spend on bonds is very unsustainable until you‚Äôre basically maxed
---
It's what the PKers wanted.

Prices would probably go up more than 2.5% because of the increased XP rate making it even more desirable to train.

The time you spend killing fire giants for a rune scim is more than the time that you save with a rune scim over a sword for the ~10 levels you use it.

Weird flex but alright
---
They're affordable upgrades brother not everyone can grab a rapier right off the bat
---
These days I just take a brew and a super restore for inventory space (and so the 2-dose brew drops aren't always a waste), that way I've got more space for extra supercombat/ranging/prayer pots. With high ranged def you have a very good chance of sustaining through a full task with more shark drops than you can use, unless you get shitty SGS specs or make mistakes.

If you are 20 levels above a courses requirement, you get less marks from it. Normally the answer would be Seers, but due to the aforementioned fact, my guess would be the Rellekka course.
---
Not 100% sure though, would be worth spending 30-60 mins at each course to see how many marks you get

I agree I have the money for one I just don't see a huge improvement yet (end game raids etc) to get one so I stuck with my Fury, not too expensive and it is also good for range

Like a lot pointed out, you will need to learn Java. Some easy projects that are fun to work on are little games (like snake, slot machines, tetris, etc.). They are plenty of tutorials available, but always make sure you understand what you are doing. Don't just copy paste code. Get familiar with GitHub, and Stack overflow is really a nice resource to help you if you are stuck.

I have a vpn on my phone, I need it to open my gmail to register rs acc. I don't have on my laptop though. Ooo - because email and acc login is too far apart it triggers security? :')

I did a total of 9 attempts, got to zuk for the first time on attempt 8 but died almost instantly.

The healers weren't the worst, just a bit annoying if anything

I just like playing advanced cookie clicker, quests are directly contrary to that.

You'll get a lot of people asking what type of account you want to make and if you want to do PvP and they'll talk about pures and zerkers etc. I couldn't not recommend that enough. If you're practically new, just enjoy the game and do quests and talk to people in game. You can always make a new account if you want to make a PVP account. For your first one, just have fun! And hang out in 301 a lot. Members love giving new f2p players money and assistance.
---
It's better dps with dhcb, however gp/h is nearly the same because of bolt costs. So ranging is better if you're pet hunting, otherwise it's whatever you prefer.
---
Strength should affect woodcutting and mining rates, pures ruined.
---
Okay

To just using a whip and a ddef on shared nope or even dharoks if you insist on getting STR xp only

(1) Thus making it dead content due to banking time being slow.

(2) Ironman is an officially supported game mode since the community voted for it in 2014 and permanent f2p is officially supported since the community voted for it in 2015.

Both guys are pretty good here. I used to be good at math, but since I left school I've forgotten most of it, and especially the terminology. I wouldn't have known either, but I'd probably just google it instead
---
It recently just took me 350 cyclops to get to iron defender.
---
Then 25 to get dragon.
---
I'm not sure if it's the same for every uni though. I study at the most prestigious uni in my state (prestigious sounds like I am bragging, but idk what else to call it). We have a LOT of international students here because it's one of the top ranked unis globally.

Get to p2p without spending money

Fruit tree seeds besides dragonfruit have crashed hard, 30k for palm and 3k for papaya is like half the prices they used to be before the Farming Guild. If anything, contracts should give less herb seeds and slightly more high tier seeds.
---
I'm gonna try to get the accounts unbannned first and I'm tempted to take 31-40 out to monks to see if they get baned too but its really depressing.

I couldn't be bothered, this took long enough and I feel like it's clear enough

They're technically demons, so the Arclight bonus effects them.

Short answer, yes.

Need suggestions.

I got an imbued heart from gargoyles last night, and I'm wondering what the best course of action is.
---
Background info: 
---
Stats - 93 Attack, 90 Strength, 90 Defense, 94 Hit points, 89 Range, 83 Magic, 70 Prayer.
---
Melee Gear - Torture Amulet, D Boots, Slayer Helm, Torso, Obsidian legs, Whip, Firecape, Dragon Defender, Barrows gloves.
---
Range Gear - God d'hide, Snakeskin boots, Assembler, Blowpipe, Fury, Barrows gloves, Neitzinot helm.
---
Mage Gear - Book of darkness, occult, Godcape 2, Imbued Heart.
---
Fully quested, Full void, currently working on slayer and the likes, 6m cash.
---
Should I keep the heart, or should I sell it for another item upgrade?
---
Respectfully, fuck you
---
it says 2nd attempt in title
---
yeah there's benign cancers that don't do much
---
Avernic should be one of the last things on the list
---
I had reddit open right before I fell asleep. Whoops
---
Think it's because I use vpn to login my email acc to register/activate account. But without vpn I can't use gmail because 'Great Firewall of China'. ~
---
Yeh but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good to sell or what skills I should be leveling
---
Doesn‚Äôt need to marked as spoiler. It‚Äôs been a week and there‚Äôs memes everywhere. Plus you‚Äôre on reddit lol
---
I like being able to play runescape and not get banned.   
---
seems like the attention is what gets me banned :D
---
Really ok and what‚Äôs skills should I focus on
---
Only if normies are forced to use it whenever a hardcore walks by them.
---
I love all your artwork, but this is some dope-ass shit. The way the gorilla looks in the first pannel is so goddamn cool.
---
Obviously people are attracted to the game fit different reasons, but this perspective still manages to blow my mind. For me, the skill grind has always been a monotonous obstacle to the real meat of the game - the quests. I big part of why I quit RuneScape 3 back in the day was because I had done all the quests, and new grandmaster quests had skill requirements that just weren't worth it anymore. EoC was just the nail in the coffin.
---
In almost every scenario, you want strength bonus over all else to maximize your kills per hour.
---
Get them if you can afford them and you are okay with your defense bonuses being a bit lower.
---
This bwana deleted his whole account
---
I'd buy an anguish and god d'hide boots for range
---
When your bossing. The attack bonuses make a big difference
---
Maybe add 1 or 2 level 3 looters that walk around the room and if the player even touches them they get stacked out for all their hp.
---
This is a joke, right? 
---
First of all, BIS 
---
We're talking about melee only here, correct? 
---
This weapon, if to follow your rules, would separate the good from the bad, right? Would this mean it's an untradable item that you always keep in PVP? 
---
If it is tradable, wouldn't that mean it separates the rich from the poor instead? 
---
I could go on, but this is ridiculous.
---
I was getting the same error while using personal hotspot from phone all that worked for me was connect to WiFi
---
Ok thanks man, I haven't played uim so i don't know but just try to look out for it when i can, if the loot isn't aboslutely ridiculous(25m+) hate the thought of weeks/months/years of work going down the drain for a petty kill, even though the wild is the wild.
---
Arclight has poor stats and a 70% accuracy and damage bonus after your stats and equipment bonus is calculated. It's not identical to any weapon for all setups, as its effectiveness  depends on your stats and other gear. If your other equipment and stats are really bad, an arclight is hardly better than a d scim. With more reasonable stats and gear, it's about as good as a whip, and with absolute max it's a little better than a rapier.

1/512 on something that takes over a day to do? Why do you think Skotizo pet is 1/65? Because it takes so long. Drop rate is fine, some people are just lucky.

Lets just say its gonna be bigger than i originally thought
---
I was 300m up at one point. Lost that. Then decided to sell all my gear besides vorkath gear and stake that in one big stake to win the 300m back and lost.
---
Made an Ironman now.

Are there any other games with an update system similar to the polling system in OSRS? I love the polling system so much but have never seen it in any other game

Not anymore with new update. No trading in the zmi cave anymore

I'm on a desktop connected straight into the router! Weird thing is, I used this desktop last year no issues, haven't changed anything and now it's just not working.
---
oh boy mage xp
---
Yeah for the most part. The slightly better accuracy doesnt seem justifiable
---
HCIM's risk it all because the loot isn't what they're risking, it's the status itself.
---
Yes, as long as you do a significant amount of damage to the boss
---
Jagex has already said that they accept the mechanic and have no plans on changing it
---
May as well leave it be. If you don't want to prayer flick, don't prayer flick. Higher effort/skill = higher rewards
---
I always ask high slayers why they arent on a boss task instead and some get angry
---
Are they f2p or p2p
---
Bonded their way to max gear and cant do ToB probably
---
The easy-med-hard contracts have ofc different seed rewards, but you'll get the same reward within a tier whether you plant a herb seed or a fruit tree seed. The last point is something I would like to change.
---
Someone else in this thread said they got on average 80k from hard contracts, which seems consistent with what I've gotten so far. It also seems that palm seeds are a bit more common than other high-value seeds. I did notice a big change when going from medium to high contracts. I get lots all kinds of herb seeds now, compared to mostly irit from mediums.
---
Imo hard contracts should be more lucrative to do than regular herb runs, as 85 Farming is quite a steep req compared to 30s for ranarrs. But I'm not sure if that's very clear atm with the current seed prices.

Lol a run will cost you around 22k total in brews if your smart and prolly around 15-20% of a blowpipe. Not 500k but def a lil pricey if you fail enough times
---
I agree, solid idea

f2p, never going p2p in a game where I can get randomly banned again.

That's a trap a lot of people fall into. Repetitive exposure to the harder waves will progress you faster than being supply perfect every early wave.

Kind of off-topic but I think it would be cool to have a mining Skilling Boss where you‚Äôre  on the back of a giant golem or something and your mining the shit out of it trying to break it down to defeat it.

Can someone help me with my rev cave set up? Feel like I‚Äôm getting out dpsed by much lower levels despite the following:
---
Salve (ei)
---
Blowpipe w/ addy darts
---
Archer helm
---
Black d hide chest / legs
---
Snakeskin boots
---
I‚Äôve got 99 range and I‚Äôm potting as well, yet my max hit is topping out at ~24 and I‚Äôll see others with a lower range level with similar set up (using addy darts) hit for 28 - 30.
---
Also, is the craw bow THAT much better than the blow pipe? I guess it must be since I see max hits of 45+ which is almost double what I‚Äôm doing now, but losing the ether charge to PKers is certainly a risk and can dig into profits. Curious as to what others think
---
It can be fun of you watch all the dialogue and stuff if youI are into that kind of stuff. What keeps me going is the additional content. First it was ancients and then barrows gloves,  lunar spells.

It took me like 3 hrs to do priest in peril because i had to traverse mort myre swamp like 10 times to figure out all the different items i needed to bring. 
---
I spent like another 3 hrs doing haunted mine. I actually figured out the railcart puzzle and got to treus dreyth on my own. The problem was i was only lvl 35 so it was pointless for me to have spent all that time on a quest i could not complete yet.
---
You might think i gave up on not using guides at this point, but I was pretty damn stubborn. I spent another 3 hrs trying to do Spirit of Elid. I traveled back and forth across the desert multiple times to slowly figure out how to do the quest. I eventually figured out where the robes were and how to fix them. I realized you needed rope to get into the cave. I eventually learned that i needed the key to open the door. I tried doing so many different things to get the key until finally i thought ‚Äúfine ill look at the guide to figure out what do since im stuck‚Äù. I saw that i needed 37 magic for tele grab, which i dodnt have. I also saw you needed 37 range and 37 theiving, which i didnt have either.
---
After spending so many hours trying to do quests without guides, i cluld only complete 1, at this point i realized that osrs quests are horse shit and you absoluetly need to use external guides to finish them in a reasonable time frame.

People were alllll on board with osb before runelite became popular. It hasn't changed, but you'd get shat on for saying anything bad about osb, it was THE client to use. Nothing's changed but now people like talking shit about it and pretending you're an idiot if you use it bc you're gonna get hacked just because they use runelite now.
---
Hmm.  Was reading what you guys were saying and that's pretty interesting.  I didn't see any melee guides (clicked the first guide I seen by EVscape)and he mentioned range, with and without blowpipe.  I was curious about melee too with the lance.  I forgot all about doing the tai bwo wanna trio quest so I can't use it. That quest isn't shit compared to monkey madness 2 and dragon slayer 2 lol.  I use to dread long quests and  never did them unless I absolutely had to.  I use to hate questing so much that I was over 110 combat with a combat bracket if that tells you anything üòÇüòÇüòÇ.   So only range and no melee?

FFA = Free for all.
---
Raiding has a normal and a unique drop table. A vast majority of the time, everyone in the raiding group will only get normal loot. Occasionally, one person in the group will get a unique drop. If it's a team of friends, they'll split the value of the unique, non-free for all/split. Split = If anyone gets a unique, the group gets a portion.
---
If it's a team of random people, then they will often choose not split the value of the unique, meaning whoever got the unique gets to keep the entirety. FFA = If one person gets the unique, only that person gets a portion.
---
&gt;Osrs is borderline a single player game
---
And therein lies the difference in philosophy. You are free to treat osrs as a single player game but the simple truth is that it isn't. It's an mmo. You can play however you want but this is an objective and undeniable fact.
---
My Ironmans current state.

Of course it's going to receive backlash if no one has any idea what the fuck if even is

? I shared it for a clanmate, idc about internet points

I also hate how OSRS has zero storyline or lores, it's just like bunch of random shit everywhere, really frustrating, wish there were some storyline somewhere explaining it.

If it‚Äôs a paid instance, may as well just turn public off/priv on friends and not spend money.

Best PVMer in the game
---
its not slower actually. its slower to level each individual skill, but the extra bonuses on the whip (and now that they changed xp roundoff) the extra damage bonuses on the whip recursively add up to about 11 hours saved. So if you can stomach it, use controlled.
---
how are you getting 2 kill trips with 4 minute kills and no bgs? i get 2-3 minute kills but can still only do 1 kill 75% of the time, although thats mostly because if i don't get 40+ on the bgs spec i tele out.
---
If you have limited time to play, these updates that supposedly cater to ironmen are actually very beneficial for you. When skilling resources become more accessible, they become cheaper. So you'll need to spend less time making money to be able to pay for your buyable skills. And if you have no money to burn on skills, there are more viable options to obtain those items for yourself :) 
---
Thanks to these ironman-catered updates, it has become much easier also for normal players to build their account and steadily build their wealth. 
---
Besides, you shouldn't expect to get things done quickly as an ironman. If you'd love to play it, I'd say give it a go. Before I started mine, I also thought I'd never get anything done. But I ended up enjoying the extra challenge it brought, and stopped caring about how much longer it takes to get things done. Now I recently hit 2,1k total, which I wouldn't ever have thought to achieve, even on a normal account. Just remember, it's about enjoying the game, not about completing your goals asap.

it absolutely does. its the second version of the green-red-blue start, with the west ranger.  youll get an east green with random mage hits.

it's just not relevant again, unless you are doing super low level zulrah because you have to get like halfway thru rotation 2. even really bad dps kills zulrah one or two phases after jad.

The truth is obvious, he was a socially awkward guy that played RS 17 hrs/day and did nothing for the community with his influence. Why should we act delusional and call him a Chad? He wouldn't even reveal his face and his voice was crackling in his mouth reveal. With that being said he has grown a bit and it's cool to see him streaming and trying to interact with people even if it is dry.
---
I'm 100% for people having the ability to do whatever they want if it doesn't harm people but don't complain about people simply questioning why they didn't use their influence **at all.** Nobody is demanding anything from him, threatening him, etc so what's the issue with dialogue?

Try and do the shortest and easiest ones first like the cooks assistant and sheep shearer. Those get you to a good enough cooking and crafting lvl that you won‚Äôt have to endlessly grind for no reason for (I still recompense fishing and cooking  for hp especially when doing combat quests) same with the dorics quest it will give you a goal to grind to and once you complete it you can use his anvils which are somewhat helpful. If you want to know if you should/can start a quest just look up the wiki guide for it. It will tell you requirements, difficulty, how long the quest is and what you are rewarded with upon completion.

Games are inherently about competition. You are free not to care about competing, but that doesn't mean nobody else should be able to. It doesn't mean the integrity of that competition holds no value. We are allowed to care about game integrity and competition just like you're allowed not to. This isn't real life, we're not comparing who has bigger tits or muscles or a nicer car. We're competing in a game. It's like caring about someone else being better than you at basketball. It's not just insecurity, it's competition.

It lasts for the whole kill. I don't know if monsters regenerate stats. If not, it lasts for the whole kill. If they do, it lasts for the whole kill except for 1-2 stat points that it will regenerate while you kill it.

Still 1 in 130 is so hard to believe, would make going 1/1000 dry be around 1/2257 chance of happening, and 1/600 about 1/103. I doubt there's even 2257 people who have completed 1k+ ToB, which would mean my friend statistically is probably the only person to have that much KC and have never seen someone get a scythe.

Assuming using semi-decent gear: ahrims, occult, tormented bracelet, eternal boots, seers ring, MA2 cape. Toxic trident is worse than a Smoke battlestaff+tome of fire with fire wave until \~ 84 mage. With a STOD, fire wave is better until 87 mage. This assumes no magic level boosting like mage pots/imbued heart. Also depending on what gear you have to effect max hit, so those numbers cant be exact, but a decent ball park. 
---
You also have to factor that pure dps doesnt mean something is better. Like someone else said, the trident isn't effected as negatively when the enemies hp=less than max hit because it hits faster.
---
Also fire wave is alot more mage xp than using a trident for roughly the same price to use, especially with STOD

Increased DPS means more xp per hour, so it's technically more efficient than SGS which doesn't increase your DPS output. If I could only choose one set, I'd probably pick the SGS. My advice here is to just play how you want.

I did this when I was quitting post EoC. I got rid of 80m or something. I only made one trade per person and only what they first put up. Only one person put up more than 10m and I doubled it in the same trade. Felt good to make so many people happy
---
For that matter, can any skills be boosted? Skills I need to obtain are 62 fishing, 69 hunter, 70 mining, 68 farming, 65 construction, and 75 thieving. I'd rather boost as much as possible than achieve all of these just to finish the diary and get elite void.
---
Personally I don't think it's worth it to bp Vorkath without Bgs. Your damage is significantly lower without specs. I'd suggest going to barrows to make money for bgs or just stick with Vorkath, but once you have the money immediately purchase it. You won't be sorry.
---
(1) Depends on drops value and stackability. Noted drops and uniques of high value (kind of like rev caves trophies) could make it worthwhile, as long as they are better GP/h than ogresses.
---
(2) Still, game should not be balanced around ironmen. Ogresses already changed the F2P meta *a lot*, I just don't see how the proposed changes could do it even more - especially if we're talking about deliberately **not** finishing a particular quest to abuse some item spawn mechanic.

Is it possible for multiple uniques in a single run from cox or tob?

- Multiple but two or more different people's names?

&gt; The most single player focused mmorpmg out there
---
That's not an assumption. You 're able to learn every skill, fight as every class and do literally everything anyone else can do in the game. Most content in the game is pvm focused for single player. Normal mmorpgs aren't like this. You can't be every race, you can't be every class and you can't do everything alone cause you can't learn every skill in the game. At it's core, runescape was designed so that a single person can go through the entire game solo without mossing out on anything. That's not an opinion that's a fact and I don't see how you can disagree with that.
---
"xp other people in this game get doesn't affect you directly and you're trying to take something that's not inherently competitive and make it competitive with rules that you want enforced on every player."
---
Read that part again. 
---
People are not entering the game being conpetitive. Just because you're treating it as a competition doesn't mean everyone should. The base game is about experiencing the game. It's about playing runescape with all the bosses, quests, skills and immersion that cones with it.
---
What you're currently doing is advocating that the rules should be changed for EVERYBODY. Not just for the people that want to compete, but for the players that are in it for the actual content that's in the game as well. You're trying to make the people that just want's to have fun, and play the game as it was designed, to follow your rules because you don't want it to devalue the things you've already done in the game.

Ironmen barrage abby demons for efficient slayer, so having enough tentacle charges is not an issue these days - many high level ironmen use tentacle for regular slayer. As for tob, it's only efficient to do it for 1 avernic hilt, and that barely uses any whips up.

How is it unreasonable to get a fire cape as part of the starting gear? You have ancient magics unlocked as DT is a prereq for barrows gloves, so blood burst and prayer flicking makes the waves trivial. Crystal bow 2/10 (i) is easily enough for jad if you don't choke.

You know rigour is also way more powerful than augury right. If augury boosted max hit like rigour did it would be way more expensive.

Dropping is better if you plan on doing your hellhound task. Do birdhouses for hunter, one after every task/one after every herb run. All you need is 29 con (iirc) to make clockwork with the crafting table in your poh, logs (4 needed for each run) and hop seeds (obtained through thieving or purchased). Very good passive farming xp and bird nests.

Void requires 100 combat, and apart from that really doesnt fit into a progression order. Obviously get it before tob, but there's not a set place to get it. Same goes for dragon warhammer.
---
Twisted bow, ancestral, justiciar and kodai all take far too many hours to be efficient to get for an infernal cape. The efficient way to get a cape is to learn on an alt while doing afk things on your ironman account, then get it first try with an acb.
---
Yeah, let me just try every single sweet thing from every fruit, fruit pie, chocolate bars, and each of the two cakes. Can you imagine not knowing what type of sweet to use as an iron man and having to go make/collect all of those items to see which one works? 
---
It narrows it down but not really. The point is single player video games are streamlined and much more engaging. OSRS questing is 25% buying everything you need at the GE, 25% skipping through long dialogue, 25% just teleporting/traveling to the next NPC, 24% checking what you actually need to do on the wiki, and 1% killing monsters.
---
I find actually reading the dialog makes the quest more interesting and a lot more fun to do. It may take longer but I care more about having fun and enjoying the quirky dialogs than playing as efficiently as possible.

Responding to your edit, first of all why are you defending WoW's fight designers as having a perfect track record after what they pulled in Kil'Jaeden mythic, if you have to nerf damage by 30%+ for some DoTs then the fight is broken by all metrics. Don't know about Uu'nat though
---
Nowhere did I say that XIV has better players either, the insane amount of prep WoW players need, the exponentially harder difficulty of managing 20 players versus 8, and the tight dps checks are beyond what XIV demands. There are mechanics you can do with 8 people that you can't do with 20 (UCOB in general I would say) and vice versa (you can't really throw around adds like you can in WoW when there are only 8 people in a group)
---
Savage has been casual since the last tier of Heavensward lol, that's like me using Emerald Nightmare as a serious example of world 1st times. If you're going to compare world 1st times then compare ultimate fights to mythic, UCOB took 11 days without any nerfs and UWU took 6 and that's perfectly respectable compared to modern WoW world 1sts. If we're going by number of pulls then I know UWU took 495 pulls to clear, I don't have a number for UCOB but world 1st took twice as long so do the math. Current groups take around 600 pulls to clear UCOB so I'd imagine it took a lot more pulls than that during world prog. I don't know if they changed it in BfA but in XIV, cooldowns reset on raid wipes ever since mid-2016 so groups can also pull slightly faster than WoW groups on average, on top of it being faster to coordinate 8 people vs 20.

---
Join the 'We Do Raids' discord. It's a great community. They have mentors to teach both Raids 1 and 2 as well as normal members doing raids 24/7 looking for teams.

Code is: gREZC7f

Why didnt he just deflect it with a simple ‚Äúi bought bonds lol‚Äù?
---
Connection lost is part of the game.
---
&gt; Chasm of fire
---
this helped me. did not know about it. lol

8,745
---
Copy. Fingers crossed that if I do screw up a switch that the d square and boosted defense will be enough lol
---
Jad can hit a 99 on any gear.
---
I saw this guy say the EXACT (except it was bandos) shit to someone else last night...
---
When I was doing 99 hunter I saw the same bots with 99 hunter for the whole month i was doing it. I would report them multiple times and even have my friends report them as well. Rarely saw a difference.
---
Yeah big time aids. I think I‚Äôll do ardy to give my hand a break, plus I‚Äôll be close to a bank so I can do bird house runs more conveniently.
---
Hides all the way, if Jad hits you it won't be for a 0, and any damage you take is set in stone regardless of any armor you wear. (Other than justiciar and Elysian because they reduce damage by a percentage)
---
I liked rs before the claymation update
---
You can try to appeal it here: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002238729-Account-Bans
---
I would advise you to do a malware and virus scan before you change any passwords etc to make sure the hacker doesnt get access again.
---
Wait.. What do you mean with a 1 in 29 chance? Could you please explain that?
---
Soon they shall be unleashed ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Still would have been a 550k task to this day
---
Bad meme, ironmen can buy any brew from any bar in game... Lol...
---
Wrong, jad's max hits are 97 with range and mage , and 98 with melee
---
You complain about the writing the past 3 seasons because it is not based on the books. But that‚Äôs because the books aren‚Äôt even written nor will they ever be. So this is going to be the best you‚Äôre Gunna get. No point in bitching
---
IDK about in OSRS but in RS3: 
---
Zamorak said that burying remains or offering them a respectable burial increases your favor with Saradomin so he has nothing to do with prayers. However, "scientific" research claims that there's holy energy in remains that you use for your prayers, so nothing to do with Saradomin.
---
However, if you don't worship the main gods and worship the ancient ones instead, Seren and Zaros, you lose the ability to use your original prayers and they get replaced by the Ancient Curses instead.
---
They've been permanently banned
---
Seen a YT video that explained it better apparently it is ''animation stalling''.
---
I totally get the apprehension - going backwards through that series if tough! Almost everyone I've spoken to likes the one they played first the most
---
You can set up an AWS server with variable IP for a few bucks.  You can manually reset you servers ip within minutes.  You can reroute your VPN with just a few clicks.  
---
What would banning IPs even accomplish?  It‚Äôs way more effort for Jagex and virtually no effort for the voters.
---
most people who rs for money do it because minimum wage for an hour in USA/EU is their minimum wage for week/month
---
Do you need to boost for the kill or to enter? Or both?
---
He hopes they will get super excited at making almost 2b and miss that 3 extra digits.
---
Not any more. On release prayer was split into 2 skills, good and evil. Magic was the same. 
---
They were combined into the prayer book that we know today.
---
6397
---
lmao yes you get me
---
I advise you to look at that support page again as it is made to appeal hjiack permanent bans.
---
I believe it's supposed to be the Queen Black Dragon but not entirely certain, bought it myself about a year ago from their official store, -Viktoria's Translation is spot on though.
---
No u
---
Because when they were current, clue scrolls were actually a super decent money maker.
---
Now that everything and their dog (no pun intended) has had their drop tables inflated due to slayer and over a decade of PvM scape, they're pretty far from their original intention.
---
No because the world will no longer be totally flat and I cannot live with that reality

So it seems the wilderness rejuvenation plans are coming along well
---
I've never noticed that, interesting.
---
My raids group is totally getting a tbow split tonight, so I'll have to look for it.
---
Yep! You got it
---
Important note that in cox only the person that got the drop sees it. In tob everyone can since you all get your own chests
---
Give me your RNG
---
Ty don‚Äôt hack me pls
---
does following someone prevent you from getting disconnected from inactivity? or at least increase the time required for you to get disconnected?
---
try killing jad with this
---
$0 on level to hang up shit straight
---
3KC unsired with Abby dagger. Never posted it.
---
I lost 5 in a row. I cant lose again!
---
Took me 4.
---
The funniest part of this is you going to a "mini-interview" for a clan. Lmao
---
~~The wiki page of [jad](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/TzTok-Jad) exists~~
---
No amount of armour can reduce damage other than justiciar and the elysian spirit shield. It'll only reduce the chances of you taking damage, though it's all RNG. You can get one shot by jad or you might be lucky and tank a hit.
---
So that's what they mean by "fancy math."
---
also fyi you can train hunter with very little time investment doing birdhouse runs. I've never done anything other than birdhouses and already have 70 hunter from a week or two. It's pretty ridiculous.
---
niceeeeeee
---
Jagex bans about 70k bots weekly.
---
He beat the boss of Haunted Mine and Taste of Hope with his restrictions I think he's better than any of us will ever be
---
That title fucking killed it.
---
You will at the very least break even. On extended tasks with slaughters I've made anywhere from 200-500k after expenses. Around 200k Mage exp a task. You will want nothing but nech tasks after watching the exp drops.
---
What world is this on?
---
Thank you!!

Join a clan chat?
---
There's hundreds of them.
---
Getting the kills faster is usually whats most important for wildy bosses, and scorpia is basically mage only, so its good to have 2 ppl around incase of a pker.
---
No ring at all?
---
99.9%
---
Whoa
---
People need to vent their irl frustrations somehow :/. It just sucks that some people choose to do it over a video game
---
sometimes it be like that
---
No h o m o

Fam id smash for an ags
---
They use hacked accounts.

.ru is just a Russian domain. People use it because Russia doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck about this kind of stuff and won‚Äôt prosecute the owners
---
I literally have a task of 145 hellhounds. How canny
---
Well you‚Äôre in the OSRS subreddit boi
---
Streamers is hard to say. YouTube theres plenty. Theoatrix is a great start with all his guides. Also learn to love slayermusiq1 for quest guides. You'll thank me later for that one
---
Wow, that's ridiculously low.  It seems like paying that low is a huge security risk, as it incentivizes people who legitimately need more money screwing you over because they have access to the codebase of a multi million dollar company
---
Hellhounds are terrible money, no bones about it.
---
Dickhead lol
---
Tanzoo and virtoso (I think that's there names) they do para challenges. It's pretty funny
---
I also like EVscape, he is doing a tonnnn of content right now and would take you a good chunk of time to watch it from the beginning which I recommend doing if you're afk and looking to kill time.
---
Ffs I saw this last week, cropped a screenshot of it and was gonna use it on the next lewd Zuharr pic
---
and here you come in like a Neanderthal just like stating it, was that even a joke why am I getting so worked up about this
---
I wrote an ahk script to alch for me. Super simple, very rudimentary randomization. Only used it for a few hours at a time but I haven't been banned.
---
Found the noob

I feel like somebody might actually do this lol

Not being wasted on normal bones
---
Not sure why someone disliked this, I found this super informative. Also, happy cake day.

Let me tell you a story about a man named Swampletics
---
It already is, it just slopes to the dueling arena
---
Fuck that nigga, nigga
---
Game would be better without it being a garbage skill/or the repititive braindead generic mmo questing
---
flair doesn‚Äôt check out, but I love it
---
What's the original joke?
---
That you love so bad
---
I'm so confused as to how zenyte jewellery happens so soon
---
Alright fellow nerd, Northdale or Kronos 3?

Don't tell me you're one of those Light's Hope hooligans

Bots are only going to get more advanced.  Jagex's bot detection cannot hope to keep up.
---
The only way to stop botting is to require some form of identity verification when registering.  A verified social media account, or a debit/credit card.
---
Both of those won't happen since they hurt profits.
