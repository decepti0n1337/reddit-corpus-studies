Is it really a scam if you right click on your  most expensive items and press the drop button?
---
---
---
im no expert but i dont believe the stats suggest that it has. In regards to pking theres always action at rev cave entrance/chins, and w65 chins is unique. Low level chin hunters are constantly training there, and low level pkers often go to try and take them out with dbows, which in turn attracts bigger fish, and even bigger fish hunting those pkers. Theres always someone there to fight.

You can’t stand still or else the timer doesn’t go down. You can escape a pker there tho

---
The precise floor requirements issue was fixed, any floor of the correct type will count towards completion of an uncompleted floor of that type that you have access to. So if you have completed floor 34 but not 33 and you do 34 again it'll tick off and give the xp for floor 33. The downside to this is that you get the lower xp if you did floor 34 to tick off say floor 40.

It’s in the news today because Ninja, the fortnite streamer, announced that he’ll be exclusively streaming on Mixer.

I get it, I'm just in a frustrating situation and people constantly saying I'm going to get smacked down is getting kind of annoying. I just want to be able to play the game I love without completely starting over again

Agility is the simplest I can think of

a pker of focus, commitment,  sheer will....something we clue scrollers know very little about.  i once saw a wick pker kill 3 pures in mage arena....with a $11... a fucking $11...
---
Unpopular opinion: the vanilla client is perfectly fine for new players.
---
UI scaling is definitely needed and GPU would be very nice, sure. I'll give you that. That said...
---
New players don't need boost timers. New players don't need words popping up on the floor telling them what they got. New players don't need to know how much experience they're getting per hour, or what the price of some random item is, or the KC someone got their Skotizo pet.  They don't need to know how many cannonballs are in their cannon, or where to dig for clue scrolls, or where to fucking click on an agility course.
---
And don't tell a new player to just turn all those things off if they're getting in the way. They're a new player, they have no idea what they're turning off in the first place.
---
The current UI is good because it's simple. It's a simple UI with simple options for a simple game.
---
If you want an example of an absolutely shitass nightmare clusterfucking shitstorming diarrhetic mess of too many god damn options upon options upon options within fucking tabs full of god damn options, just look at Runescape 3. If you're a new player in Runescape 3 and you just finished taking a shit on their discount tutorial island Ashdale pile of shit in their ocean, you're gonna have a bad time. There's like 500 million different options for loot highlights based on where you're getting the loot, a million different chat options, a little thing that says, "OH I WANT TO SEE HOW MANY SLAYER CREATURES I GOT LEFT DURRR" and all that fucking discount elevator jazz.
---
I mean, what happened to the good old days when we took a slayer gem with us because we wanted to see how many more scorpions Turael wanted us to kill? That was a good part of being a noob.
---
 if you call it every kill you'll eventually be right
---
Lol

there's no category for oldschool runescape, also can i use obs to stream? how's it any different than twitch and why would anyone else use it

I think they would have to redo the rewards for two reasons - chaotics would probably not pass a poll and they have already distributed some of the rewards through other methods.

Sounds like when you turn 16 you need someone to teach you that the real world doesn't screw around.
---
You say that, but a brew at 68hp only heals 12 (17.6% hp) instead of 16 at 99hp (16.2%). It's really not that big of a deal UNLESS one's using blood spells, where it makes a huge difference and I absolutely agree.

For Zalcano 'more effort' should be gathering an appropriate amount of rocks and participating for 100% of the kill. Not bringing swamp tar and a fucking guam, two things entirely unrelated to the boss.

remember opening one of this guys streams recently and let me tell you, what a fucking gamer. His opening intro was just this fast paced trance music and it cuts into him doing 1tick 6 way gear swaps and fakies in this tribridding fight. He literally destroyed this guy so hard and dropped him for max gear it was fantastic quality and skill. I dropped a follow and subscribed with my twitch prime. Just on the side of this pking screen, he had another account doing 3tick 5g mining in the quarry. His next stream that I caught, he was completing a solo ToB and it was like the 5th in a row he had done. This guy is a fucking gamer and probably the most versatile and experienced player in Oldschool aside from Woox. He's top tier in skilling, PvP and PvM. What a fucking gamer

That's what I think should be the case, but I've had several people tell me that they got perm banned after being hacked and they managed to get it fixed. Hopefully it'll be the same for me, but I'm not optimistic
---
I think that the people that happened to be logged in that day (random), were aware of the vote (active reader), and cared enough to vote (motivated), is the profile of all the voters for all polls with the exception of the really big ones.  The only difference here is that less people logged in that day because there were less days available.  All we should lose is volume.

As somebody who’s always used Mixer over Twitch (not for osrs, but other games in general) I can tell you there is a category for osrs, and there are a couple of streamers already there. TheHillionaire is one as well as Loki_The_Smokey.  I can’t wait for more people to jump on over... Mixer is a high quality platform and has a helpful support staff. Only good things can come from this!

Slayer dart wouldn't be better than trident tho right?

I think it has something to do with the time you put it in at, so no one was buying it and you put one up for 1 gp and someone tried to buy one and they get the lowest sell offer which was yours

I think there's been a HUGE increase in the number of bots doing Zulrah. Scales and the blowpipe itself have been dropping in price for a very long time now. Vorkath was less affected but is finally seeing a dip now as well. I saw comments on here from one guy who admitted to running 40 bots that kill Zulrah for 12 hours a day, every day, and haven't been banned yet. Motherfuckers are gonna straight up kill this game.

You're expecting balancing consistency from a gaming company that hasn't been able to balance their combat triangle for 20 years. RSC to EOC (2001-2013) was Meleescape and OSRS has been Rangedscape 2014-20xx.

Ive not done much gem mining, a couple hours at best, if you have it, use it but dont go out your way to get it just for mining, its use comes through slayer, which its pretty good for, get it for that
---
Anyone know how the world record on the Prif agility course is 1:03? As far as I can tell the best shortcut portal to get is the one on the very first roof, but even with that I can't get better than 1:06. And I don't really see how you could shave 3 seconds off my time, it's not like I'm making mistakes. Runescape is very simple, you just spam click the next obstacle as you finish the current one. Am I wrong about which portal is best? Or is some sort of glitch required for 1:03?
---
You should totally not dm me. Definately not a noob seeking fortune.
---
one of your worst works
---
You had to fit the mold to do anything in pve if you wanted to be taken into raids lol. every class had a certain role. almost no classes were really hybrid. so warriors just tanked. people like mages/locks literally spent an hour handing out water/food/soulstones etc. priests healed. shamans for totems. etc etc
---
literally everyone is going to be a mage in classic because it's effortless dps and easily probably the most op class in vanilla. even asmongold held a poll and most ppl voted either mage or something like warrior. certain classes like hunters for example were basically only playable in pvp with extreme skill and eng abuse (everyone in vanilla kinda just abused eng, weirdest thing ever tbh), because people just deadzoned you and you couldn't even place traps in combat lol.
---
I'm not hating, but you cant fail MANY polls that were MUCH closer to 75% then warding, then put warding in just because you want it. if they don't hold strict to their rule, why even have it? if the required poll pass went down to 66%, then warding was repolled, and got 66%+ I'd be fine with it. but they can't make exceptions to their polls.
---
I might have to resort to that. I'd prefer not to bother then like that though

Wait so lets assume that whoever bought this guys robe offered 100k, he now got 99,999 back and the robe? The GE matched a buy offer with lowest sell offer. That doesnt sound right because  there are time i put in item for 1gp and sold for more than 1gp. I might be retarded and missing something here but it seem like you always get the exact amount you trying to sell for and this is known to be false.

I think you should repost this with their actual twitch/youtube names (framed/settled/other guy) and I bet the post would hit front page.

Someone probably changed the page. It's been dropping for while but it's a pretty slow drop. If it dropped by that much so fast, I have to imagine that someone must've changed the Kills/hr formula.
---
ironic that you call out reddit for being a bubble (it totally is btw), but you base your view of the playerbase on the ccs you have been in

This is bait, but there's actually people who believe a polling/voting system like this should work and it's really sad to see :(
---
You have to let go
---
if the community can generally agree they would like to see a new skill but can concede that they cannot agree on a new skill, it only seems appropriate to trust the devs and let them put a skill in that they think would be most appropriate for the health of the game.
---
none of this would realistically happen because getting everyone to agree that they can't agree is beyond us as a community.

1. He died because he misplayed(no stamina). 
---
2. I don't know what you mean by clan bodying. Surviving a focus from one brid in ancestral + 3 mystic spec traders in his gear is totally possible and is in fact more than likely.
---
3. He was not scouted by a bot, the first guy in the torags helmet that he hit (rsn: Guwop) is a rot/flamingos member. If you watch vids or spend enough time in the scene, you can tell which team different people are in.
---
4. Clearly the guys on him were not hunting for spades either.

runelite notifications keep making my taskbar appear and the RL icon flash despite having all windows notifications off. anyone know how to fix this?
---
Amusingly considering tick mechanics and tile based combat, we're halfway there
---
There hasn't been any proof of any way that a runelite dev could hack you, it is also open source so if anything changed then it would be very easy to tell. Not saying that it's the safest thing ever but most of the community use one or the other and after all this time there has been no evidence that any of them have actively tried to hack people using it.

Warding got 76.6% yes votes on the reddit poll (with 15k votes) and ingame it got 66%.
---
No way... really?!
---
Wtf are you talking about dude I hate trump as much as the next guy but posting that on social media is fucking ridiculous. This is such a reach
---
There's no way he's not on some list or anything lmao
---
anything over 5-6 people is a waste, you are splitting the rewards too much then.
---
Oh I don't really set foot in the wilderness anymore.
---
But it's usually the pkers who complain about lack of risk in the multi. They are massively hypocritical but take any chance they can get to body someone in over 100k risk.
---
The mechanics they abuse, despite being in single combat, is mostly PJ timers, which is basically a 7v1 but one at a time, and they will PJ you before you get the kill.
---
It's mostly me taking the piss on pkers, cause they pull this shit then turn around and cry saying the wildy is dying, that's all.
---
70 range is low level lmao
---
Not quite sure why your worried about picking up climbing boots, but as people said this has been a thing for a while, also wouldn’t recommend drop trading in the ge.

He said he uses the 1 click blackjacking plugin and honestly believes it’s not bannable lmao.
---

It was a goal i had set from day one. Just said fuckit and went at it lol
---
What happened?
---
He most certainly will be facing legal action after hundreds of redditors submit anonymous tips to the FBI. Imagine exposing your actual felonies over being banned from a fucking children's game.
---
I don't know what that is but I'm 99% sure almost all plugins are bannable. Am noob casual.
---
Not sure what you mean because if he puts a sell offer in for 2gp and someone puts a buy offer in after for 100k it won’t sell for 1gp it’ll sell for 2gp, the lowest selling price. That’s if he tries to sell it, there’s no offers in, and someone come after to try to buy it.
---
If someone already has a buy offer in for 100k and he goes to sell for 1gp, it immediately goes to the highest offer already waiting so it sells for 100k
---
It just depends on who puts the offer in first, and why high volume items like runes won’t do this because there’s always buy and sell offers in for around the mid price
---

99 rc, not sure about the rock throws though, sometimes still hit 0s at times. can't tell if it's better.

Like... Something's about to happen..

Also something else to consider: Jagex buffed a spec trade timer about 11 months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9bicv7/specdumping\_in\_singlecombat\_by\_teams\_got\_nerfed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9bicv7/specdumping_in_singlecombat_by_teams_got_nerfed/)

That's my kind of luck right there. I'm glad I'm not alone. I've literally made second accounts on games and found they were luckier than my first accounts. I sometimes wonder if accounts are attached to a randomizer number that screws it's drops... Or something... But I'm just unlucky
---
Exactly :) Not even bothered about the loss of gear, just happy I got the cape while retaining HC status
---
Oh the Zalcano tick manip?  
---
Yeah I get why they did it but I still disagree with it.
---
Still so annoyed they manually killed woox here.
---
As of this moment today there's been about 37 bought and 23 sold on ge-tracker.
---
Before 1-hour death timer, "Lizard squad" would supposedly DDoS the servers and take items of players who died.
---
To mitigate this, they made it so you have to be logged in at the same time the item is on the floor to see it.
---
It mitigates it by.. well, you DDoS the server, pretty much everyone goes offline, so nobody would be online to steal the items.
---
Well, you cba have both. Get dhcb for cork, then when your done with cork, sell it and get rigour.
---
LOL
---
Idk how anyone else feels about it but I feel the only annoying part of the Gauntlet is the size of the dungeon/placement of the miniboss enemies.  The dungeon is so large that I am running around the outer edge for 2-3 minutes looking for just 1 miniboss.  Half of the time they are all clumped up in 1 corner of the map.  If you choose the wrong direction to run you are screwed out of time or getting a T3 weapon.
---
I think it would be better either to add 1 more of each miniboss or make it so they cant clump up in 1 corner and spread them out consistently.  Its currently the most frustrating thing about the Gauntlet for me as it wastes so much time running through 20 empty rooms.
---
more than a few hours
---
Because spade hunters don’t deserve to be catered to.
---
that dude switches so much he missings dps
---
Just spend your gamemaster points to block fish trawler, duh
---
This is how it shoulda been released.
---
I would say the "smartest" way to stake is to only stake until you lose, and only stake money you're already willing to part with. If you stake with intent to win, you will most likely end up losing given that when you lose, you feel the need to up the bet in order to recoop the loss. 
---
I got a drop from an elite (those BIS str legs for pures) that sold for 5m. I proceeded to stake 5m again and again until I lost. This specific time I happened to go on an 8 win streak and walked away with 30m extra after losing only one 5m stake.
---
Obviously had I lost the first 5m bet this would not have been the case, however nothing was essentially lost other than my newly aquired gold and seeing as I did not necessarily need it to buy any gear, (nothing that I didn't already have was within a 5m budget) it was money I saw as not needed. 
---
It's not a perfect method but it works for me.
---
Sir, you can't have your penis out in the liquor isle.
---
On an old account a long time ago I got banned for bug abuse and even then it listed the offence as Bug Abuse Major, I dunno what else other than what you said that would warrant a manual perm ban
---
Are there any vids of him pking?
---
Except that no decent clan has lumbridge respawns
---
I ended up averaging about 18 kills per hour, but it really fluctuates with people coming and going
---
I must of stroked-out because I never ready the 'low' bit of the post.
---
Which, fair enough. With how inexpensive a lot of the lower-tier gear (Rune) is these days, it doesn't take much to afford a decent set.

Did you clean herbs to 70? Any advice because I'm absolutely hating this grind. I've got 59 herb, 65 construction, 64 hunter, and 67 farming. So close but my levels are coming very slow.
---
And most people wouldn't have? The actual video isn't the point. It's that pking in wildy I'd utter shite yet they turn around and try to blame pvmer for it
---
So it works differently depending on if the buy offer or sell offer was put in first?
---
Wait till you see me and my illegal MMK macros.

Listen to everyone in the comment section. Thata 99 slayer right there.

Dungeoneering was fantastic, very fun to play.
---
Problem is, OSRS team have said on past QandA's that it woild take something like 9 months to produce with no other content being released during that time. So its not happening unless they get a much larger dev team.
---
I know it was quite recent, but when were d-claw's sound effect changed? I thought this was polled but can't find the question in the poll.

I'd imagine the feds are trying to seek out information on him and contacted jagex for chat logs.

survey up that gathers info from like &lt;1% of the player base, and only those who happen to check reddit - a third party website that also doesn't represent the community as a whole, which also essentially "hides" the fact there was even a survey as the post itself is no longer "current" - within the short window it was live (less than 24 hours).
---
yeah objectively bad info. this info is sooooo bad and misrepresented that it's conclusion is moot. but hey, you spent 2 minutes in ms paint to simplify the info for the fucking idiots that can't think for themselves. so congrats. have an upvote you brainlet
---
Level up runecrafting to 99. You need runes to cast spells.
---
I wouldn’t mind tick manipulation if it didn’t severely punish everyone else as bad lol
---
if you're doing the same shit from 50 to 99 rc, you're doing it very wrong

just so you know, I am not calling you anything. I don't know the facts so I'm not gonna pass judgement, I'll leave that to someone that does know the facts.

&gt;  something irrelevant to the minigame
---
Wintertodt considered to be *a boss*. So it formally is a boss fight, not just a minigame. Yeah, thats somehow strange, but it just look into the adventurer's log, "kill count", etc. - it is in boss listings, not minigames. Thats why its possible (and all too easy) to be killed here.
---
Just imagine to be freezing to death. Yeah thats hard.

Another tip, in addition to what was said above: try to wear all untradables, or almost all. Thats relatively easy even without the pyromancer outfit: lots of items of Santa and Antisanta costumes, bug lantern, etc. If you are killed, you loose almost nothing, only food actually. Your axe is protected as 3 items. Also pray Redemption plus Rapid Heal, if u can. Redemption saved my life here many times - but if you wear all untradables, the only thing you loose is a game necklace tele. Even your food you can pick up later.
---
Good luck.

Ash has stated on previous QandA's that dungeoneering would take about 9 months of dev time to complete, with the entire team working on it, no other updates. Unless they get a much larger dev time, were not going to see dunge in osrs for a long time.
---
Was great content though. I think the progression system makes it necessary to make it a skill, even though the community clearly doesn't see it as a traditional one, at least on release. They added more content later on outside of daemonheim that made use of it as a skill.

Got a friend on FB who I met 10+ years ago on RS. She stopped regularly playing at least 8 or so years ago but we kept in touch on and off through the years and now we always share each other’s memes on FB. 😁

&gt;mer service and honestly it's extremely embarrassing. I might consider going for that since I've been wanting to play a main instead of a b

Keep in mind this game is UK based.  They are a bit less ...permissive... about speech over there.

PJ Timers were already nerfed.

I'll give you a hint: go check the name of the account of the clip of him killing Emily.

People 2200 world RCrafting probably don't care about money compared to the convenience.
---
Awesome! It's a GREAT feeling lol. I'd love to attend your 99 party! Are you going to post an invitation to the sub?
---
Ouch :x good luck
---
If my life depending on it happening in like a day I'd prolly stake it lol.
---
Merching is hard and nothing else is going to double it fast.
---
First attempt I over ate and the second attempt I brewed my self past 94 mage so I couldn’t use my spells. Just stood there without a tele looking like a scrub. Pain in the ass to reset tho.
---
there's room for improvement, but he's got the gist down
---
Bank presets. I honestly doubt the community will allow them to be a part of the game. I don't blame them. But runelite already has a way to do it anyways so it may as well be a part of the game. That isn't to say every rl feature needs to be in game. Just this one for me specifically.
---
thank you :)
---
A single bad update will cause people to leave. A bunch of medium updates doesn't particularly draw people in. A stable playerbase is much more valuable than a rotating one.
---
As a result, we need to be extra picky about what updates make it into the game, so there's a high threshold.
---
Already kicking myself for not taking it while I could.
---
It depends.

In this time, you should be 100% focused on maximising autism to earn about 4.4M gp. 
---
You can do this easily by using non-requirement ways. Like looting pvp world drops for 200-300k an hour. 
---
Use the wiki page for money making methods and do the no reqs things.
---
Once you have a bond, use the rest of your time following the optimal quest guide on the wiki. Then rinse and repeat
---
Pay $70 irl that I got from sucking trucker dick at gas stations and buy 100m off a rwt site
---
well if you weren't on a list before you probably are now, guarantee someone here sold you out to trump daddy smalls
---
The wiki is your best friend, it does have a paragraph on this exact thing as well as information on every item one could look up.
---
having more players is obviously good but we seriously need higher voting requirements. there are a lot of new players that just vote yes on everything without understanding the implications of the change and don't have enough knowledge and perspective to make an informed decision.
---
1250 total or 250 hours played would be good requirements imo, and would also keep most alts and bots from voting.
---
obviously not. my point is that the xp rates don't fluctuate that dramatically.
---
Fun fact: The iron sickle became discontinued for like a week or two in 2005 or 2006. I remember someone buying one for 900k. It used to be able to cut the weeds. Jagex were going to replace it with the rake for the farming skill so they removed the ability to buy it. However they didn't delete them from the game (maybe they couldn't at the time?). They then reverted this change because they didnt want to introduce another discontinued item at the time.
---
Yeah I'm assuming someone in here was triggered by it enough to call somebody about that tweet. I regret tweeting it, hopefully I won't be pulled into a dark alley by Mr. FBI man any time soon

Wish I had a monopoly on helicopters for you spergs though
---
Well, he has over 500k subscribers, so there's that. His channel used to be a general weird video games discussion with funny gags and video effects. 
---
Since then though, it's expanded to covering ridiculous old PSAs and hilariously edited food tasting videos.
---
&gt;Each Crystal shard provides 100 charges and each tool holds up to 20,000 charges in total. A freshly made tool starts with 10,000 charges. 
---
Whether it's worth using at mlm depends on how often you farm shards. If you're AFKing you probably don't care that much about speed of training though, personally I probably wouldn't use.

Can’t lamp it without rune mysteries

I'm a big fan of the clan reign of terror.

I think that's illegal.

Dude pay by phone!!

The rewards for this boss also scale with your level in skills
---
So in general mid level accounts might have to bring a few extra wines to the boss fight but will likely receive better rewards
---
I want summoning in the game
---
ouch
---
Yeah, if additional bones got dropped (Bllodveld's regular bones + big bones) it would not crush as it doesn't know which to crush to be on the safe side. It might seem like not a big deal to ask it to crush any but i believe this was done due to long bones and curved bones. You wouldn't want it to crush your long bones LOL.
---
You listed the exact date you planned to carry out your attack.
---
They're going to have a field day with you.

That's Skate's acc but that's 1013 on it.

Some bosses are really fun for me, while others are a slog.

I really enjoy solo kree'arra, alchemical hydra, zulrah, and vorkath. But I dislike abyssal sire, cerberus, and k'ril tsutsoroth.

Try to find what works for you.

It still annoys me how the poll for her chathead lasted about 12 minutes

Exactly, higher requirements, higher rewards. Except after this it seems that's going away and the diary spot will be better again, I think.

As someone who’s been Skilling for weeks, binging good shows hasn’t been too bad
---
So people can just force your client to crash?  Wtf Jagex? Someone threatened to crash me at sand crabs if I didn't let him steal my spot, and someone at iron dragons told me he was gonna crash me for no reason. I didn't know they were serious...
---
nah he's about right, average corrupt runs are like 9 minutes now since you can consistently kill it with t1 armor now
---
4m is realistic if you never wipe, 5m prob too high
---
You used a games necklace tele when the combat bracelet and i think either the defense or strength skillcape saves the 5seconds of running to the warriors guild

imagination is a muscle bruh, if you ain't training 24/7 and treating that shit good mate it will fucking wither away and die. lemme fucking guess, you think that when people look at you and see that scrawny little imagination, that they're thinking "oh it's cool you don't have to have a big imagination, omg people with big imaginations actually look gross, i want a normal person with a normal imagination". NO. fucking no my man. they know from the fucking get go that you're some beta-imagination-having bitch that's never thought an interesting thought in your life. they're settling with you because they're weak and want to feel better about themselves, if i walked along and slapped your girls ass with an on-the-spot scenario that she hadn't unto no hither hath thought upon shes fucking drenched mate. soaking wet from her lips down to her toes. we'll be up to 12 that night on some text based adventure living lives you can't even dream of because you're weak within a week. i'll show her what it means to have a real mans imagination. start bro. just start imagining now. work that shit until you can step to me in a d&amp;d campaign and take that shit to unexpected heights of reality and imagination that i myself will wanna get down on my knees and suck your dick. until then you're in my fucking realm. i am the god here, the creator. don't talk shit about graphics to my face ever again cunt.

Its happened to me on 2 accounts I was playing DMM on, the bans were probably for swapping or muling as I was doing both.  The bans were permanent and couldn't be appealed, 0 evidence as well

I already did SOTE and was going to do some hunter training for cash, saw the spot and how many chins where there so it looked perfect, and no one was there when i was hopping around checking it out. Nerfing the spot to make the diary better does not make any sense. The requirements for completing a Grand Master quest should outweight a hard diary.
---
So 99 is just getting to level 30 one hundred times
---
Lol fully agree. Imagine if it was an animation like the magic carpet in the desert but you were directing it, that might make sense yeah?
---
Sketchiest escape ever with the rope across the river
---
I’m totally doing this now
---
This pretty much confirms what I said right after Warding failed: no skill pitch, regardless of what it is, will ever receive 75% approval. This despite your survey clearly showing overwhelming interest in a new skill.
---
So the dev team should just stop trying and focus on content that actually passes.
---
I understand RWT is an offense but is it really that bad? I mean jagex sells gold themselves so saying that your RL status shouldnt give you an edge is kind of a weak argument at this point
---
The ancient staff is a pretty good crush weapon. It also provides some magic defence which helps a bit against waterfiends.
---
Even if you had a cudgel or hasta, it would still probably be best to just skip waterfiends.
---
I think they mean he showed up and crashed the party
---
Went from 44 to 82 rc purely making natures in the abyss. Did double astrals to 84 so far. Taking a break for a while from rc...

Pirate bandanas come in blue variants too, in case you didn't know. GL with the cosplay :)
---
I mean you still have a friend...
---
Check it in-game. It passed at 88%, but had 12k people skip the question because they didn't know what a bologa's blessing is. The website basically makes skips look like no's. Everything on that poll passed.
---
Maybe if your chair stinks and you are 100% efficient.

Really just can't understand how people like you miss such an obvious joke. You had to miss some sort of brain development as a child or something.

This truth in this is actually horrifying. I spent the afternoon with my 8 year old cousin the other day and all he was watching was Friday Night at Freddy's gameplay videos by some super annoying youtuber who's constantly shilling for likes and comments

Or set up shift click to use...
---
Are you serious ? They may risk more money but when it’s 5 against 1.... Pking is literally one monkey spamming tb then one other monkey spamming snare then 3 monkeys ranging you and ddsing you in melee range. 
---
Pvp takes skill, this isn’t pvp this is slaughter.
---
Look to Graham Stephan (under 1 mill subs) he's making over 100k USD a month from YouTube. It has to do with your viewers and how well ads work on them. YouTube as a career is viable for some
---
No way, so many resources for a skill that probably won't pass
---
Had a few last night and i was really hoping for one, gz thought!
---
He has 4 mouses, but controls them all with his dick
---
Serious answer, go to rev caves and punch imps.  Grab loot as available from the bodies.
---
I agree, just the only way I think a skill will get past 75%
---
well, you at least know the difference between merching and flipping so I would try merching if I were you, op. If you want to make profit as fast as possible then I would avoid buying an item which is crashing.
---
People are obsessed with pets here too lol
---
just put it in construction, why would it be a separate skill
---
I’m asking for advice on how to make this better. 
---
Losing 50k is  hardly getting pked. It’s more of an annoyance. 
---
This is unfair and I can’t be vocal about it ?
---
&gt;That's not MTX.
---
Not only is it MTX, but it is also P2W. Nothing in the definition of a microtransaction states that it needs to generate any item in the game for it to count as a micro-transaction. 
---
I've nothing to add to your other points, but I'm sick of seeing OS players being in denial about bonds being MTX.
---
oh well guess i gotta remove it now...
---
PKing becoming the most popular content, as opposed to PvM, Skilling, Raids, etc
---
nobody is happy that you might go to prison, they're just telling you that you can definitely go to prison for that and they're bewildered by the fact you're an adult and somehow wasn't aware of how serious that can be. The fact that you doubted and dismissed how severe the consequences can be is why people are laughing. They're not laughing at the fact you might go to prison, they're laughing at, frankly, your stupidity and arrogance.
---
What about burying all the bones for 99 prayer?

I dont see how its faster but you are probably right they both had chisels on them. Never heard of doing it that way before.

Then you stop after 30 minutes because you realize you don't care enough and it's not worth the effort

Yup. Same thing happened to me when i first bought members. The dragon harpoon loot table has just been moved from Raids 1 to Wyrms. It was priced as 3 M on ge. I bought for 2. Sold for 1

GE prices can only change 5% per day and for them to change there needs to be certain amount of trades done that are over or under the current GE price (no idea on which value/amount thou to trigger the change)

Yet there are other pvp'rs and larger groups. There is always a bigger fish. You just seem like you are upset because you die in the wilderness. There is a cure for that
---
A lot of them are probably pking for fun and the profit is just a plus. Revs is just a textbook example of risk and reward. It's multi combat in a secluded area where your best option for escape is a high-level agility shortcut (unless you can tank into single) if you don't get tb'd, its not meant to be fair. Anything goes.

Because rng is a fickle bitch.

I read somewhere that the only way to get consistent birds nest from birdhouse runs was to use magic bird houses which require 60+ hunter but if lower tier bird houses work too then I gotta try that out

Hats on too tight

6’1 but I drive a Genesis 5.0 l, so it’s more roomy than a vette or something that’s low to the ground.

Press space bar instead of click here to continue

No not really. 99/100 times people pking me in wildy is multiple people or ragging pures.
---
If you're that guy who solo pks in 600k  risk then you're the exception.
---
So I think it's pretty fair to label pkers that way. Those who are the exception know they are.
---
gives up that easy? noob.
---
Alch yourself
---
yeah I am currently doing 9 on maples (max bird nests per collection) and 6 on coal to at least break even on the amount of money I am putting into it. I read somewhere that teaks rarely give birdhouses and if they do, it's only about one or two. What is your experience with the teaks?
---
H
---
While that's true, it's almost entirely irrelevant to the discussion.
---
Before grand exchange, ice barrage pking was far less developed since there wasn't a massive meta.
---
Black dhide has never been a problem and never will. If it's was, wouldn't all those defensive stats made torvesta impossible to kill? Looks like he died there to me.
---
You either missed or wilfully ignored the most likely conclusion from question 1 which is that people who took your survey and probably r/2007scape as a whole are not a representative sample of the playerbase
---
Oooooooo someone’s mad they got called out for being a broke splitbark boi

What the fuck i did the same lol

In RS3 when you beat a champion from the champion scrolls you get a imp pet that carries the banner of the champions you’ve killed. It’s pretty neat. I heard they didn’t want to add this to osrs because it was an easy pet to get.

Seriously, you're either just really dumb, or just trying to be a troll. As I already said:

&gt; **If you want some merch, buy the merch. But if your primary goal is support, there are much, much better ways.**
---
&gt; **My comments are 100% directed towards people who buy merch they don't really want or would never otherwise buy, purely to support their favourite content creators. It's a terrible way to do so.**
---
As a direct response to:
---
&gt; If he really wants to make money he should set up a patreon
---
&gt; &gt; I thought he did have a patron, maybe not. But he does have merch, or at least has before, he knows full well that he needs alternative income
---
Where someone is specifically promoting merch **as the best available way to support him** that they know of.
---
-----------------------------------------
---
If you're thinking of responding again, please actually fucking read this comment chain again, since it's VERY fucking clear you do not understand what the point of the conversation is about.
---
RNG by having the tears always spawn on the same wall you're collecting from as soon as it changes. Its theoretically possible but the chance is INCREDIBLY low.
---
I agree with nrtetudr’s response.  Back near OSRS release, 2011 runescape was associated with the negativity surrounding rs3, given that the updates were only a few years old at that point.
---
Never eat soggy waffles
---
I just started a f2p ironman too, and these guys made me think I was going crazy. I'd hop worlds and a nearly identical guy would come and hog my spot out of no where, just like the last. I dunno, the sheer amount of bots in that mine are concerning, plus how they are spread across all worlds, it seems to me like someone made a botting-bot.
---
For next time if there is one, or for anyone else who still needs the mage arena 2 capes: do it on pvp worlds. It's in the wilderness anyway, which is usually empty since most pkers are in Varrock.
---
Weird that mtx isn’t an option
---
that's close to 1/900 000 odds. wtf

Why not  let the tangleroot have the option to store your tools in?
---
So people selling 3D printed jad and runes and the like is punishable by law?
---
Why would you remember it anti-clockwise...?
---
It's not nerfed at all. The just closed the gap between MVP and the regular loot. If anything it's been buffed. It's based off contribution, so of course if you're doing it with 30 other people in world 2 your contribution is going to be minimal for everyone including the MVP. I was testing it with people all day yesterday and the best loot was given by doing 3-4 man groups. 5 man teams cut the loot by almost 30-40% and 2 maning took to long to do to make it worth while. 3-4 is optimal. Was making over 2m per hour.

I cant help but see a demon in the water jumping out just to the right of the dogs head in the left photo.

Why doesn't OSRS have a merch store? And if they do why haven't I heard about it?

Crazy how 80 which is considered decent stat is only 15% to 99

Oh ok, didn't think about them getting skulled.
---
Not too shabby I approve
---
im pretty sure people just wanted no eoc at the time, like servers that were the same but without the eoc
---
and then its 271k in crap loot and you're sad
---
I think doing it in a third world country like Pakistan is okay because personally speaking the law has bigger problems than this so we simply don't care so you could in theory operate from a third world country and ship wherever you want to. Otherwise hell no

I wouldn’t recommend doing high volume flips if you want to have your cash stack work for you overnight, or in your case a week. You should do some less frequently traded items at higher margins, doesn’t have to be real expensive stuff like amulets of torture or anything, try some items from treasure trails. There’s low supply and low demand, so few people go out of their way to flip them and the ROI can be amazing
---
This has always been the case?

It absolutely isn't. 2006scape, the private server predecessor to OSRS (Just look at the subreddit title. This isnt a coincidence btw), had 500,000 registered accounts before it was shut down by Jagex. Other Pre-EoC private servers did not have nearly the surge of appetite and  popularity that servers like 2006scape and even Project rs06 had in late 2012 early 2013.

Even with bad RNG although then I will have a bit less food but since the update that isn't a problen.
---
It's apparently a fork of Runelite, that has some plugins that were not approved by Runelite devs like Vorkath or SuppliesTracker plugins. Zulrah plugin is prohibited by Jagex, but can still be found on R+.
---
Yep, this is the case. For stuff like phase changes/first hitting with mage, you should use manual casting to avoid the autocasts 1tick delay.

Oh god who's ready for a pointless yes/no argument back and forth, over just acknowledging that both versions had a fan base.

Dude same, it must be a gorillas thing
---
Are the Dharok sets for your huge drop party?
---
I know they can be really fucking toxic calling people racist slurs and telling them to die IRL. But this time all they called it you was "fucking noob". I dont know if they called you anything else before, but if this was it, your being a bit of a sensitive pussy
---
Also runecraft bad
---
I should be empathetic here, but how does anyone fall for these scams
---
You're literally being told to drop wealth and alarm bells don't start ringing?
---
Not this again..
---
I am trying to gather as many ideas as I can from these posts. I like to see everyone’s different perspectives depending on the time zone and day.
---
Weak sttempt at karma whoring. Its obvious most of these kcs were pre log, just look at the bolt rack count lmfao
---
Nice.

Roll up with 3+friends and these in the wildy and have some fun

Thanks for the information, clears up a lot. I will definitely join the clan chat tomorrow, seems like a good idea.
---
Grats! I wonder what the drop rate is. I’ve done around 300 kills and haven’t seen anyone get the pet or tool seed
---
My dad is jagex, u will be removed bye
---
The likelihood of getting a rex pet after 13,337 kills is 93.06%.

It blew my expectations out of the water. I thought it would be a clunky, outdated mmo that people were only playing because of nostalgia. Turns out it's a unique experience that in all the games I've played, nothing is exactly like Runescape.. I honestly think I'm having more fun than I have had with WoW in the past 3 years.

99hp here, 10 wines was more than I'd ever need in a round, and leaves more than enough room for roots.

A Canary stopped singing.

People were also just ddosing wealthy players doing bosses.
---
People are quick to say toxic. There’s a lot of jokes and memes at other people’s expense, but in my experience here, genuine questions are answered.
---
I'm with Win.. I couldn't finish Friends once. Was too bored. HIMYM just works for me, I guess.
---
they changed the death mechanics because ddossing and Server disconnects were rampant in pvm
---
Damn u beat me to it 😂
---
yeah but the stupidly easy fix is to make it so items on the ground from a death can only be seen from the person that lost them. not give them 30 minutes to get back.
---
I'll tell option C and anyone that voted for it to fuck off
---
still looks stupid as shit and if you can't see that you're either blind or mentally deficient

People arw gonna be sooo triggered people pay 100s of mils if not bils to get that pet via trees and never do
---
You're right, because causing someone who plays the game for a living to lose something doesn't really do anything. If anything you'd just be giving them more income because people will want to see them make a new HC. 
---
It'd affect average players far more, much like it did last time. And if you really don't think there's people cancerous enough to go around making people lose hundreds of mills/bills just for the sake of it you must not pay much attention to the community of RS.
---
Using ROT to generalise pkers is like using ISIS to describe all muslims
---
You get chacken pet

Try playing dota 2 or low elo games in league then you will think osrs community is Nice.

Did my 1 kc for diary last night and got magic fang :)
---
Too bad they're gonna disable body blocking. Good thing I got mine already ^^
---
Unlucky i have 3k kc and never had to cancel that much
---
Not sure but I feel like thats unlucky. I am also 300kc and i **Only** do zalcano in teams of 4, if more people join we hop. I have seen atleast 8 tool seeds and 2 pets and like  6 onyx's dont even get me started on the fucking zalcano shards which are so fucking common.
---
Maybe do zalc with smaller teams if u do him in huge teams!
---
You get 3 months of game for price of a 2 months. So no you can't cancel it.
---
Or just bank your items before you log
---
Players dying in the wilderness are just as toxic as those killing. Can't watch a video of someone PKing at wilderness bosses without the defenders constantly talking shit as they run down.
---
&gt;stole the brand
---
Lol. Don't know what a fork is, huh? Maybe don't comment on things you don't understand?
---
I don't think the people upvoting this realise just how many barrages you can cast in 35 ish wilderness levels, I'd be raging too if only six of them landed
---
Betting you went from stretched to fixed.
---
ya running laps to make this fit lmao - people have stopped ddosing in this game, unless specific to player IP. it's not the reason the death mechanics haven't been reverted. jagex knows if new players die and can't get all their stuff back there's a higher chance they'll quit. it's pure pandering at the expense of 'tegridy
---
This seems like a pretty terrible way to get shards as well. I was get 25/hour at Zalcano and thats safe asf and hecka mindless. Would get more ticking etc.
---
yeah go fuck yourself, 2100 kc no claw
---
That is neat! I might grab it
---
I want my Zarosian gravestone =(
---
Oh hey! That's great to hear. I was vaguely into the news about mobile and stuff but around that time I was too busy being stuck in the pits of the Inferno to care much about what was going on at the time!
---
I'm glad you're having fun. There truly is no experience like OSRS. There's so much to do and so many people you can come across which change the course of the game and your actions.
---
Security is always something i've been super conscious about in Runescape. I still remember the first time I was lured back in RS2, and then the first time I was scammed in world 2 after that. It definitely taught me the value of keeping everything secure! Thankfully I have 2FA and upon logging in a little earlier I still have all of my items, not that I had much to begin with :P
---
I'm sorry you were hacked. It's always rough trying to rebuild. How are you going with it?
---

Best update would be to slow down updates rate... theres too many we dont have enough time to enjoy them...

Check your bank for skotizo totems. He usually drops some shards.

Mine was tom1111110 at one stage haha

All the good solo pkers are at chins / rev entrance or at the kbd entrance, not hard to find solo fights if you hop around near KBD

Impossible.

A few hundred why lol just a coincidence get off my back bro jesus haha
---

---
*BOOM* - Headshot!
---
&gt;If you died in any of the rooms you could say goodbye to all of your items because you wouldn't be able to make it back in time.
---
Unless you had a mental breakdown for 2 minutes after dying and just stood at the respawn point then you could easily make it back with time to spare, and given most non-irons duo/trio then there was never any risk. 
---
RS3's death mechanics are substantially better than what we had, tbh. Especially considering that now the majority of bosses can be accessed within a matter of seconds.
---
Dont switch, use only mage, and just eat and pray through Jad and Tanz stages.
---
Work on your strength, your max hit is prolly trash. Ranged too, you need to balance the combat triangle.
---
how about you go be sweaty at teaks and the granite mine and leave the skilling boss to the real gamers, scam another tbow
---
&gt;Seeing how much it pisses people off makes me want to get into pking so bad
---
LMS beta just ended but when they launch LMS it's a fantastic way to learn to main brid without risking anything

Ok, mage only it is. I’ve been using trident of the seas with serp helm, ahrims robes, book of darkness and infinity boots.

It's not that we don't care. It's that tv is on and we're not paying attention.

I really have to save this prayer, I only get so much of it. Where do I get more prayer?
---
jagex have this habit of shoehorning in updates, then using those forced updates as "precedents" when defending their reasoning for other controversial topics.
---
i can imagine a scenario wherein if the death mechanics *are* changed to be somewhat costly to the player, a la rs3 mechanics (which aren't inherently bad), and then the power level is increased as a whole for pvm with the reasoning being "we just made pvm more dangerous with a cost to dying, so we thought we could also up the power level.". thus invalidating the "cost" to pvm via death as death would be so rare beyond the highest level pvm content.
---
probably being a neckbeard but just wanted to state that so in 2 years if im right i have fap material.
---
Thanks for the tips, 
---
would you recommend LastPass or KeePass, or is there no real difference between them? I was about to add it as an extension to my Chrome browser, but i'm skeptical about giving all my information to this extension. From my understanding, it stores all your passwords and encrypts them so that if your computer is ratted, your saved passwords are atleast safe from hackers? 
---
But what about the developer of this extension? Or am I being too silly here. Which one do you use?
---
RL+ is hardly a legitimate client. The devs spread lies about me personally to try and defame me, send spoofed web requests at my servers mimicking my own client, and distribute botting scripts. Not to mention they actively try to confuse people into thinking they are RuneLite. This is just malicious behavior that basically attacks my project instead of building up their own project.
---
They also obviously do things like weaponize my code to do things I have expressed it shouldn't do - which they are of course allowed to do, if they want, but still is is in very bad taste and frankly makes them look childish. And then, after all that, will still go through and spam my GitHub tracker, or deface my wiki. I wish they would leave me alone honestly.
---
Never heard of this guy before, but there's also been more than a few posts praising Jagex, marketing, and this person specifically as of the past few days.
---
Seems like some people are also being sponsored to post about it :p
---
Yeah... Practice is the biggest advice here. But generally:
---
- Don't try to squeeze in hits until you're confortable. Concentrate on running and eating so you don't get stacked. 
---
- hug the walls. Most patterns on the floor leave walls empty. This avoids the hunlifef. 
---
- for the pattern that leaves a row of 3 tiles empty in the middle, run from one side to the other. 
---
- try to keep running. This means clicking on the next tile before your character arrives at the tile they try to get to. If you click on the next tile after your character has arrived, you stagnate for 1 tick and you get stacked. 
---
- even if you run into the hunlief, he deals max 30 dmg. The key is not to panic and stay in one place. That's weh nyou get stacked. Keep running and eating. 
---
- after a while you get a feel of when the tiles time out and you can click on red tiles knowing they'll dissappear before you get to them. Same goes for blue tiles that have yet to turn red. You can linger on them for 2 hits.
---
C? Wtf guys? Definitely $11

Pepperidge Farm remembers!

Bots have always been a problem for osrs.
---
&gt; Relative to the total playerbase, it's tiny.
---
It is not. It's about 0.25%, which is more than fine. You can't strictly look at population percentage. If you selected it properly, you could achieve a relatively accurate sample of our 7B global population with just 1,000 people. You guys are ***way*** too hung up on sample size. It's honestly unreal.
---
&gt; You got an incredibly small number of people to respond on your survey which was open for a few hours in a certain timezone, and ask only people who visit reddit
---
It was open for 24h, so I have no idea why you're talking about time zones.
---
&gt; It's not a representative sample. 
---
It's close enough. You can't make these categorical conclusions based on theory when the actual results are extremely close to the ones in the actual in-game poll. You're being ten times more disingenuous than I.
---
&gt; Please figure out how to do a survey before conducting one and drawing conclusions.
---
Thanks, awesome to see how ridiculously entitled this community can be.
---
Sarachnis is worse gp/hr than barrows honestly. Barrows runs barely use up resources while I find myself out of food in 3 runs of sarachnis. Also barrows drops on average with mory hard are much better than sarachnis.
---
Atleast you came prepared

Why not just require bank pin to play? Honestly makes the most sense to me.

Make your own survey then

---
I don't know enough about KeePass, but LastPass seems to be safe. Of course, you're always trusting the developers of LastPass to not be shady, right? But that happens with everything. You trust your bank to not be shady, your email, facebook etc. There is a line that you can't go any further than that.
---
So for now I'd vouch for LastPass. It's last breach was, AFAIK, in 2015, and you were safe since (quote) "your passwords are salted, hashed and stretched, and only ever stored in that scrambled, irreversible form".
---
I use LastPass, have been using it for years, and didn't have any problems with it ever. And it's nice to not feel the "fear" of a hack!
---
But there are plenty of better money makers in the game. I guess if you actually enjoy abyss rc then fair enough.

What is this runelite thing everyone is talking about? Some kind of alternate osrs client?

I think it was just done like minutes after it’s still bleeding
---
it’ll be a big adventure that’s for sure
---
No I think they closed it early in time for the update which is still not a good reason imo, would rather wait another week for the change but actually get a chance to vote.
---
It’s called a joke bro.
---
:) one day it will be approved and I can sleep happy
---
What's offensive ?
---
Put a casino on top of the GE
---
I’ve only done kurasks on task and they’re definitely good money, but I’ve done quite a bit of afk wyverns and it’s very consistent and very afk. Watch a full length movie and by the end of it you’ll definitely have several mil. Using the “wyverncc” to sell prayer pots and other non stackable items also greatly increased my profits.
---
Yes sorry when I purchased I was actively looking at the Asus flip and keep calling the Lenovo the flip but you are correct it's the flex.
---
While I got the flex 14, now I believe the flex 6s are out in 14" too as my parents just bought the larger one not too long ago. They can still be purchased from microcenter, Amazon, etc. The low end runs like 400$ and handles rs perfectly fine.
---
Thanks for the account man, appreciate it lolol
---
Every post so far is very vague...
---
You want a computer that:
---
* Has a CPU with good single-core/threaded performance; this includes any Intel since C2D, and AMD with Ryzen
---
* Can run any common operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
---
* Along with the common OS, you'll want it to be x86 (or high-end ARM or POWER, but these aren't common)
---
* 8GB RAM or more (8GB is a pretty safe minimum amount nowadays)
---
* Any graphics chip (OSRS isn't officially GPU-accelerated, but if/when it does gain that, it's a safe bet it'll run on any Intel HD graphics at a minimal that any currently-supported Macbook supports; I think HD 4100+, and definitely the more common HD 520/530/620/630 chips)
---
Realistically, most laptops and desktops advertised nowadays will handle OSRS fine.
---
&gt; How much would one need to spend on a laptop/desktop to ensure runescape is able to run smoothly while handing additional tasks like films/streams/youtube etc in the background?
---
$300-400+ I'd say, but it's hard to put a number on this. You'll likely want either a QuickSync-supported Intel CPU, or a modern AMD or NVIDIA GPU for hardware-accelerated video playback.
---
&gt; Are laptop's capable of multi screen set ups? Ie laptop/with additional monitors behind it or no?
---
Yes, but there's a lot of things to look for.
---
* What output ports does the laptop have?
---
* If HDMI, what spec is it? (this matters if you're using anything higher than a typical 1080p@60Hz screen, and even more-so with 4K)
---
* What spec USB-C and/or Thunderbolt ports? These allow easy hookups with docks for multiple screens
---
Generally speaking, most laptops come with at least one output port, and it'll likely be HDMI that at the most will likely be able to do up to 4K@30Hz unless it specifically states otherwise.
---
'Peg my bottom' is obscene and isn't a name
---
I use tier 1 armor on. Normal mode.
---
My buddies and I (3 of us) would go do KBD at like mid 60's.
---
It wasn't quick, but it was risky and it made the game fun. Especially when we saw PKers on our way in.
---
We also got 2 dragon pick axes, so that was nice.
---
Thanks for your support!

If you like tech and journalism "reply all" is very good. They did a couple episodes on scam call centers and they actually went out to India to try to meet the people running the one that called them. 
---
If you like comedy and shooting the shit I really like "the supermega cast". It's two gaming YouTubers who own a channel by the same name so it's a little bit niche and maybe hard to get into but their podcast usually just has them talking about movies and dumb hypotheticals and if you like other gaming YouTubers they've had a few on. 
---
Lastly "yeah, but still" is really good. It's more comedy and shooting the shit but it's run by comedian Brandon Wardell and Twitter guy/film maker Jack Wagner and they usually get big name comedy or music guests on the show but it never feels like they are there to promote something, it just feels like they are there to hang out. It's very chill.
---
They didn't give any reasons.  
---
Sounds like Eomeri is taking some steps back from RS.  
---
Justice is joining the army
---
DMM is done with, when it returns i think we all know it will not be a clan mode, as that is the main reason for it ending.   
---
Sounds like a couple more of the staff was kind of getting bored of RS and fools requires a lot of time  
---
So they chose to just end it, rather then promote someone not qualified and have the clan look bad. Im sure a fools 2.0 will be reborn with many of the members though
---
The fastest cooking method is also quite profitable. Fletching can be extremely fast and profitable too. For example bolts aren’t the fastest method, I made almost 50m from 84-99 making dragon bolts while getting 1.5m+ xp/hr. 
---
You cannot do the same with cons and prayer.
---
This isn't hate :)

Forgot the best part maxing that hardcore Ironman osrs account
---
Don't represent it as data when it's not.

The way it's made breaks several points of the scientific method, it's not valid results at all.

Yes, I just posted about this and have yet to find a solution. Apparently it happens to most people. Very frustrating.

LOL idk why you think Torvesta is bad at tanking. If he had a stamina he gets out.

---
Well, Barbarian Assault is particularly limited and repetitive. Something like Dungeoneering would probably be more representative.
---
You mean everyone should be forced to do 1.5t, just relax for once, we all play this game to relax and have fun. Sure, it's competitive, but at the end of the day it's just a game. Plus, not everyone can do the 1.5t method. Why not think about others too? Why not just taking it easy for once and enjoying the game instead of hunting a pet?
---
I love your suggestion to make the Corruption set effect a 25% chance of a double hit.
---
I'm not sure if the AoD effect needs adjustments, but it could certainly be interesting to try!
---
You keep talking for yourself. Classic is like the golden times of gaming, back when rewards weren't pushed up your butthole every 2 minutes for a quick dopamine boost.
---
I mean, that only makes people more likely to grind it right now. If I told you zulrah was gonna make you 5m an hour for the next 2 months, you would probably want to grind it for as long as you could before the profits dropped.
---
Mage only is the way to go for a first kill for diary. It’s very easy but slow. If you’re not interested in learning the boss for later just do a mage only kill.
---
Fake
---
The format is really something you just need to try. You're asking to be convinced and throwing up all of these theoretical objections, but if you're actually open to it at all, there's really no point in being convinced on this level first.
---
I personally don't use image boards any more because they have their own unique flavor of toxicity (the kind of environment that leads to stuff like /pol/), but the format is actually great for discussion on general topics.
---
Thanks! That's why I added the AoD change as a consideration.
---
Appreciate the feedback!
---
70 unlocks kurasks which are decent money, 75 unlocks gargoyles which is really starts bringing in consistent money. Be sure to extend those when you get there if you are going for money. I would walk out with like 900k-1.2m after one task.

Please explain why you are allowed to talk shit when being attacked and not when you are attacking somebody. As you said, attacking somebody is not asshole thing to do, then i dont see any logic in what you said.

You can also get attacked in wildy and just shut up about it and just accept that there is nothing wrong with attacking players in wildy.

---
You’re harassing me at this point
---
essentially yes, however it's hard capped by buy limits. I didnt even almost do it it one sitting. It was usually every 2 days or so I'd have about 100k bolts bought then I would crank them and then go back to what I was doing. It took about 2 weeks or so. I was training hunter at the time while bolts were buying.
---
I don't know what the average clear time is after the nerfs, but before you could do maybe 5-6 an hour consistently. 1000 clears would be in the 150-200 hour range if you never fail.

Haha right

Also whats with the focus on deep wildy pking, its all clanman mode now days. We should be focusing on bounty hunter and pvp world/edge style pking.
---
Surprised both these comments weren't downvoted into oblivion for being right... what does the dude expect to make 50-100k a year off of youtube ads on a 19 yo game? Lmao... it's not even like hes been smart about the business side. "Heres my video ima just always slap it on youtube." The easiest platform to just post to and then whine like a bitch lmaoo
---
So you're saying 2 clans have never crossed paths in the wild?
---
Even more Monty Python references Poggers
---
Hey dude, just wanted to follow up with you. Just hit 1,150 kc and I got 3 prims and 1 eternal since I last posted here. Got my rapier finally!
---
High alch battlestaves and other stuf, train your crafting, and do varrock diarhs for ez battlesaves at low cost. Then buy orbs in ge and craft your own battlestabes and high alch them good mage and crafting exp for some profit
---
Also, I'd imagine it's just a case of adding the sparkles to a normal potions image
---
Like I said I've been massacred for it.  I still bring it up to see what responses I get.
---
I usually have randoms still say "gz" when I randomly level up, but what I don't like about OSRS is how whenever you have a 99 party, you're expected to have a drop party; regardless of if it's a resource/money making skill. Back in the day you used to get gifts when you got a 99, not lose money just to get people to show up lol
---
Thank you, you are right in that this took months since I've began this grind, only taking a brief break last week for SoTE. In game time, this is one of "fastest" pets to get if one can consistently clear the inferno, but realistically each attempt takes 80-100 minutes on top of hunting for the slayer task (avg 60 mins). Such a long time between kc meant I lacked the mental fortitude to do another attempt immediately after finishing an attempt, unlike other bosses.
---
Enhanced might be. It hits pretty hard.
---
What? Why? How?
---
&gt;Thank you very much dude, I honestly appreciate it. So you confirm this laptop runs the game/multiple clients easy etc. So am I right in assuming as long as I shoot for either this laptop, or laptop with Similar/better specifications I'd have no issue playing RS?
---
Correct, however you won't be able to use the gpu plug in for runelite, which is something I regret
---
&gt;What is it on laptops I need to be looking for to ensure it can be hooked up to multiple monitors?
---
It needs to have an hdmi port, I'm not sure about multiple monitors being able to be run off of it though
---
Just repeating what Jagex said.  It does involve a client side update, maybe their process makes it a huge pain to do those more than once a week.
---
big mood
---
I want 'Shoe'

but the profanity filter snags it because Hoe.

i walked past this conversation at the ge. i knew this was gonna be on reddit sometime.

&gt;skill for "doing what you're told"

Isnt that precisely what Slayer is though?
---
I literally had a friend complete tutorial island for me on my first account.
---
i saw his aim hero clip and i said meh because i saw better, and can do near that good my self on aim hero.  
---
\*sees this\* and now i understand why people downvoted the ever living  shit out of me lol, i can hardly believe this is actually real
---
Jagex has officially said if you are using anything to enhance the game there should be a 1:1 ratio of actions and clicks/keystrokes. Not sure if that answers the question. But if it automates anything, then you shouldn't use it. If it visually enhances your game play... so be it? You still don't have an unfair advantage.
---
Yeah with the update the other day t3 on regular isnt necessary at all i even just get t2 helm and hunt my t3 weapons
---
Did yoy use the private hunting grounes for chins from the hard diary? Asking because I may do red chins but really cba to do the diary requirements.
---
The first step is admitting you have a problem, steve.
---
Maybe gnome fights on top of the GE? 2 go in, 1 comes out? That shit would bring the GP.
---
NigelSasauge was taken too
---
Pickpocketing a whip? What a deal!
---
I kind of like making it weak but attack very quickly 3-tick. It would almost be like its a 6-tick, with each hammer attacking independently. This also means the set effect could be more relevant. I think combining this with removing a flat 20% run energy, would mean it could have a niche in PvP.
---
Separate thing... what program do you use to make posts like this? Is it just paint or something?
---
Yup, at first I thought I made him lose the pet but the order of events meant he got the pet safely lol
---
Did you go back to Sherlock?
---
Cannon near the sand crabs, and then teleport to ardy monastery to kill them with range. Teleport back when your cannon runs out of cannonballs. Killing imps in 2 places at a time
---
Missed the opportunity to make the actual chest purple and make the “scroll of truth” the arcane prayer scroll

I’m certain you can get it there. I’d like to know the drop rate though tbh
---
Wth, why everyone messaging my mum?
---
I learned recently. Not as hard as I thought. Got it like 7th try.
---
Fast food is just as dangerous as drugs. Only difference is fast food takes 20 years and drugs can be instant. Just like inactivity leads to health problems over time aka runescape
---
Pretty good, but why is he out in the open? Would be a 10/10 if he was just in a Tzhaar area
---
This is missing the panel where the guy goes 'fuck it chuck it and if we win we walk away.'
---
Better than Sick Nerd, gratz!
---
Also yes functionally taking drugs is different than clicking but addiction is addiction. With regards to biological functions
---
This is literally the dumbest shit I have ever read this year. 
---
Congrats.
---
I only play osrs after work, after ive worked out, done my shopping, washing, showered and cooked my food for the evening. I do not play on days I have social commitments such as seeing friends or going to sports events or something.
---
I play other games alongside osrs
---
I see no sign of addiction?
---
hell yeah dude awesome concentration
---
I want you to try and sell me this pen
---
He’s training hp

Lol looks like the current meta to me. Try TOB.

Yes, that is with 129 cape gambles (kept initial cape and got pet with gambling on last kc)

Lol says the guy who doesn’t understand how the brain/chemistry works. Gg

Fuckin balls of steel, christ almighty. I woulda damn near shit myself.

__Normal person:__ Real men are sane and don't have such insanely, pathetically crippling self-doubt, and such a complete and utter lack of self-worth that they'd care if their partner were able to support them financially.

Just did monkey madness after having members for less than a week ! Making good progress. Now to afk some sand crabs to be able to actually wield a D scim lmfao

But why

All good mate
---
I'm gonna admit, yellow text black backgrounds as long as my ex's heart is cold I tend to skip over B U T I've said for a while now that we should make Torags better.   
---
I think changing it from a run energy drain to a snare\\freeze and making its amulet of the damned effect like a slightly less good BGS spec would do wonders, and fit in thematically with what torags already is\\has been known for.
---
I'm not that good haha
---
Hugh Jazzcok definitely won
---
Am i doing my math wrong or is that enough slay xp to get 1-99 slayer?
---
Crazy, congrats
---
Unfortunately yes, I hope you also love being clanman moded and blackmailed
---
The same as a drug addict as in people that are addicted to osrs have an addiction. That's the only similarity, lol. Nice, OP. Very thought provoking.
---
Since you are adamant that a man always needs to hold a job I was under the assumption that you think the way a family should live is that the man is the breadwinner and the woman stays home and takes care of the kids. The nuclear family.
---
That is a pretty common opinion to hold so I put you in that category. You claim that isn't how you think so I believe you.
---
You need a hug buddy?
---
I have a problem with the lack of official gambling in game.
---
I know there are many methods which can make me more gp, however they take way more time and quests/skills requirements. In that preparation I WOULD gp waste until I finish the requirements. In the case of getting to the wc guild I already got the hang of things. So it took me only a few days to bring a wc lvl 1 account there and reach 75 in no time thanks to xp boost. With my current method after taking care of the 42 bonds I can generate about ~105 bonds in 14 days if it was 5m per bond (I have paid 4.7m bond so I calculate in worst case scenarios) if I play 10 hours daily. Goal for now is getting as many autosustainable p2p in the least amount of time with the least requirements. Then slowly migrate those wc 99s
---
It goes to the highest bidder yeah
---
Finally someone with a little intelligence.
---
It's not clickbait the video shows exactly what is in the title. Need a hug buddy?

Oh shit.

lmao, this is pretty funny. Are you upset?

I demonstrated above, using calculations and gameplay experience since its advent in 2005, to show that Torag's it definitely not fine 😂
---
I'm not speaking about the armor pieces as a tier 70 tank armor
---
what do y'all think the chance is this guy has talked to a girl in the last month is?
---
honestly osrs should add RS3 death mechanics. you won't lose your items but you'll have to pay a fee to ''grim'' at the death office to retrieve your items. Good middle ground imo.
---
Did it sell instantly or did you have to wait ?
---
My rough guess would be somewhere around 1/21,410 if it's meant to fit with the rooftop rates.
---
Everyone in the cc hates u lmao
---
not gonna miss you
---
Make hammers a 2 tick weapon
---
Shit man I tried raids for the first time the other day. Fuck that shit
---
Ah yes Soul Wars, the crucible in which all botted pures were forged
---
And spec energy, what a noob gf account
---
Interesting.
---
Yes!!! why not??
---
You're welcome i just wish I could've provided better news, I don't know if you want to try and hit up a JMOD on twitter and see if you have better luck.
---
I mean im not mad since im a main and just wanted the pet but for ironman this would suck alot
---
hes also assuming they dont have specific items that arent shown, lol how is it any different? It was an ignorant comment. You cant say " Not a single person in this picture has 6.5m worth of gear on. Just an observation. " when you cant see every slot they have filled lol.
---
Werewolf: 62 ticks per lap
---
Pollnivneach: 101 ticks per lap
---
Is it just me or does anyone else enjoy doing fossil island wyvern tasks?
---
Now post on Twitter that you only made 50 bucks off the video for all your time.
---
This is some great r/iamverysmart material, ty.
---
They, along with dungeoneering, were the *only* content that required teamwork, had real win conditions (unlike wilderness PvP), and could be considered end-game content while also being accessible for random players of varying skill levels. Castle Wars can sometimes be okay for small games, but it doesn't scale well, and the regular players would never allow any changes to make it more accessible.
---
Nah you’re just dumb.
---
The Wiki was wrong. Dorgesh-Kaan is much better than Ape Atoll.
---
Not sure what client it is, but this is a huge issue for the PvP scene. For example, I have a small clan that would pk at revenants, and there are scouts at almost every world. Sometimes, you see the same exact scout, who would follow your every move. We would all have private’s off, and he would still go to the same world we land at (we hopped randomly to test it). People are allowed to see other players even when their private is off, and it greatly ruins multi pking for smaller teams, as a team 30 of max mains just roll in and decimate you.
---
I remember opening my first rsps, seeing lots of pictures of cars, and then the OG login screen. Seeing the OG login screen made me feel almost exactly the way it did when I first started old school Runescape.
---
I have yet to read one. I just watch everything on YouTube I can get my hands on. What do you recommend?
---
Exactly. It’s the perfect strategy with infinite money. Otherwise you make too small of an amount for the great risk
---
Are they?
---
Isnt most of the things you learn about them told from the perspective of a gnome?
---
Have the rotation series (there's four) up in another window
---
Lmao. I mean it's super unfortunate that the guys putting in huge hours aren't getting much in return for their efforts but I know we all do it for the enjoyment of ourselves and others. It's honestly a bunch of the comments and the in game messages that keep me going. Knowing their are people looking forward to what I have to offer
---
You should be able to get 1:04 with no special mechanics at all. Try playing on a world with better ping.
---
In the pre gravestone days in actual 2007 if you died your items were immediately visible to everyone. It might have been changed on osrs release but you never had any sort of grace period to get your things.
---
Looks like you don't have graceful. A pity
---
Let me get this right. I quote, you yourself:
---
&gt; If you don't wanna deal with her shit tasks then go do wildy slayer to build up points to skip with
---
And again, I quote you yourself:
---
&gt; thats your fault for blowing all your points on cancels instead of just doing the tasks dude
---
Le MiDnIgHt xd
---
Use your stats to find your account, then dig through your profile for info to recover. Blocking out run energy, etc is just a meme
---
You have to sing to the snake as you kill it bro ;)
---
Heres a tip for the future, 2 step auth on email also so if your email is compromised which is very possible with database leaks they cant just turn off your runescape authenticator through email.
---
My reccomendation though is to use an email not linked to anything execpt runescape with a unique password, 2step on the email and runescape incase of these leaks.
---
I know :(
---
Well this was my only one and I sure enjoyed it lol, but honestly even without the 2 rare drops, they were relatively quick with decent drop table, would go again
---
Just had to flex your music cape on us, didn't you. I mean I would absolutely do the same, but still
---
Put slot machines there.
---
There's a few methods, but the most popular and easiest/most consistent is glassmaking. This method is pretty slow until you can use the Lunar magic spell Glass Make with giant seaweed and buckets of sand.
---
Since crafting is a slow grind, the best way to do it is to start growing giant seaweed as soon as possible, and incorporate it into your farming/birdhouse runs (Easy with birdhouse runs as it's in the same area). 
---
For the buckets of sand, there's two main methods. You can either mine sandstone in the desert and deposit it into the sandstone grinder for very very fast buckets of sand (a few thousand per hour) in exchange for buckets and GP (as well as good mining xp), or you can use house teleports or useful locations (Priff north bank is the best example) to fill an inventory of buckets one at a time (slower, but more afk than sandstone mining)
---
As well as these, dhides from dragons in your prayer training, battlestaffs and gems from monsters/rewards (You get alot from konar slayer) and other random things help with small amounts of xp, but most of it will be from Glass Make into glassblowing.
---
I'm not sure anymore, but back in the day you could definitely get Jagex Support to reset a password based on knowing certain stats. Happened in RSC a lot when it was far more common for people to show off their stats for pkers and whatnot. Back when good stats were far more rare.
---
Gold farming isn’t against the rules. Selling gold is. You can’t preemptively ban a gold farming account in case they start selling gold.
---
what should i be waiting on o.o
---
If you look closely its pixelated like the game
---
Priffdinas is better now, at least after a certain level. Werewolf and Brimhaven course are still the best, but Werewolf is hard to do properly and Brimhaven course needs you to store up a lot of tickets to redeem the XP and needs Karamja Elite.
---
The hardest part for me is standing in the right place and not getting choked out by the poison clouds
---
its just you
---
Ahh ok thanks!
---
Sounds it, Animal magnetism probs has the best rewards tho ;)
---
This subreddit is toxic. Most PKing clans are toxic. Basically everyone else who plays the game is nice and helpful though.
---
Hey grats on getting the title right this time!
---
Gg lmao
---
Yea you need a prayer potion or two otherwise it's RIP there. Any reason you didn't just hand over 5 dragonstones? I personally didn't have them on-hand since I had converted all of mine for the POH jewellery box, but I was wondering why you didn't have any if you can just buy them?
---
Definitely better than fighting him.
---
I’ll let her know when she brings the toilet and hot pockets down

No porn? Yeah, okay
---
Christ what a flex dude holy shit
---
If they can swing it, sure. Kids don't need 24/7 parenting and it's unhealthy for them to grow up if they don't have time as individuals.
---
There's people who don't care about trimmed rune and then there's niggas like me
---
He probably wears the helmet under the gas mask too.
---
Go back to math class
---
I remeber when people put effort into troll accounts.
---
At gwd inv space can be really tight though and the bosses drop 3 dose pots.
---
Support, but only if there is blackjack and hookers.
---
Me too!
---
Haven't done them in ages, but yea, seems like its closer to 2x with current prices. It's still pretty dumb to do bloods to 99, but I guess all anyone cares about is doing the lowest effort method possible.
---
Do you need any pots for protection against wyverns with a dfs? Sorry I'm a noob lol.
---
Yup, If someone sees your run energy the can hotwire themselves into the cable mod after which they can use this type of data (duration of boss kill, spec energy) by parsing it using the so-called JED-algorithm and instantly gain access to your account.
---
So would you say people are addicted to television Netflix social media any forms of “entertainment?” And what point do you cal the addiction an addiction. Someone who goes home watched tv all night before sleeping vs someone who goes and drinks all night before bed both get up and sleep. Kind of like someone who does it with runescape before going to bed.
---
This this this. This could be *so much fun*. It'd eliminate the entire RNG element of preparing and you'd be forced to work together. It could also make it more fair. I'd be all in for that. Shame they'll never implement it.
---
soul wars was terrible the games were constantly fixed by clans and the majority of players there were just bots. I think the only people who cared for this minigame were level 3 skillers
---
Oh yeah I was definitely bankstanding after this one lol
---
I'm confused, can you explain what the point of bone running is? I'm guessing you mean to the house altars not to the wilderness altar?
---
It just seems relatively pointless to me since you can unnote at the wildy altar solo, and get double the usage there anyways
---
I would like to ask for some tips on fight caves. I have tried it twice without a guide really (except the wiki) and died once on wave 60 and died the second time at JAD, got these little noob cheeks clapped.
---
Anyways my stats are 71 ranged, 72 HP, 61 Deff, and 64 prayer. I am going with an all ranged method.
---
I am rocking blessed d'hide top, bottom, and boots, Odium Ward, Dragon Crossbow, dragon darts (D diamond tipped (e) for JAD), Archers ring, Amulet of Fury, and Rune gloves.
---
The piece I am stuck on is the headslot. I've tried using Archer Helm and blessed coif. I have a Robin Hood Hat in the bank and I just grinded out Helm of Neitiznot. 
---
What would be my best option here? I wanted to use helm of Nezzy for the defences bonuses because I find myself reaching the late waves with very few supplies because I take a lot of damage due to my low defense from the Mage waves and on. But I also take quite some time killing each Mager due to their defense.
---
I just switched to Dragon darts for my next attempt but I just realized the Helm of Nezzy doesnt have any attack bonuses at all. Should I stick with Robin Hood Hat?
---
I know this is a long post but any help would be greatly appreciated! I am wasting a lot of money of this but I am 100% committed to finish today.
---
Any other gear recommendations would be appreciated as well! Thank you!
---
Yeah i shoulda started my cancels before i wasted my 2k points :(
---
Brimhaven and Werewolf are the best xp
---
Just out of curiosity is the extra £50 for the i5 processor worth it?
---
grand exchanges all the way down
---
Same boat dude, drove me nuts til I found the 05 style. 
---
It's unfortunate because I really like the newer icons, but the old compass is helpful and for some reason nostalgic to me.
---
Nah, that’s what makes it terrible. Some ass tier wannabe pker.
---
Good point, thanks.
---
Gz dude
---
Good to know, thank you mate :)
---
I mean if you're a smaller streamer this idea is definitely cool and doesn't spam your entire chat under.
---
And how often dose that happen, it’s hardly a risk if it only happens once every year
---
I honestly wouldn't know, you'd be better asking any of the other guys in here lol
---
This sub is less toxic than GE lol
---
Yeah, it seems weird to me that a character with 1 Slayer can kill all manner of demons and monsters and dragons, however doesn't know how to damage a cave bug.
---
Who has the highest Inferno kc and what is it at?
---
Hate that shit
---
Upvote first down vote 2nd etc
---
yeah, reddit hates clans. what are you gonna do
---
Yes, lets use ironman as an example, of course agility is the easiest skill since you need 0 investment other than food.
---
To? Low. Talked at? A bit higher
---
Fools 2: Eclectic Boogaloo
---
189 kc, 99 slayer. Still no imbued heart :(
---
Yea I enjoyed this aspect a lot. It was an actual game where top clans would fight each other. Was loads of fun.
---
trimming t-bows
---
Yeah but you need to train agility to do that one efficiently and you still need the bones to do it so it's really not even close it's just a chaos altar with more steps.
---
No they aren't phasing nmz out. And nmz is way more notable then soul wars was.
---
Which is why people use Crystal Shields there, as the Crystal Shield smokes the D Sq in ranged defense.
---
Don't think he knows what soul wars was
---
But she does more damage too.
---
*block
---
Slightlty too much of a newschool cape. RC, mage, mining or the slay cape would probably be more fitting!
---
 When does it open again?
---
Ty. silver lining though, my friend who doesn't even play the game took a candid photo of me before and after 99 and captured my cheesy grin.
---
Leave the Venezuelans alone
---
It’s got a mage bonus of 15 which is 5 higher than a elemental staff. Players use it for the bonus as you can still cast ancients while it’s equipped.

Some people prefer unchiseled men.

I didn't know they weren't liked, I love them. I also collect all the dragon/wyvern bones I get from tasks to train prayer so I don't have to spend mils on GP, so I'm always happy to do them.

Oh wow, so trident is unaffected because you technically aren't using a spell? But ibans casts from your spellbook so the tick delay is added?
---
I did leave a comment about how DDOSing caused the changes.  its not like im arguing for their return its just something i dont see people mention ever.
---
... are you throwing dragon darts as a dps option? how the hell are you not broke yet.

use a msb+amethyst arrows or a crystal bow or something lmao

Could go full fuckup quickly.

this is my account and its been hacked can someone help

Blowing glass is easy and relatively afk aka mobile friendly for crafting, thieving ardy knight is very easy with a well positioned camera atleast that's how I skilled during lectures haha
---
Some prefer salve ammies str bonus
---
Just move GE to burthorpe, it looks like crap in its current place
---
I’d personally find it pretty demoralizing. Maybe that makes me a noob but idc. 
---
This game takes a lot of fucking hours to play and get to a high level. Money doesn’t come quickly. If I bring good gear and accidentally die, I just lost what is probably dozens of hours of play time. That does not sound fun at all. It’d completely disincentivize learning new things and taking on new challenges. 
---
A new boss like that may be good and interesting, but having it everywhere would fucking suck. 
---
So maybe it’s easyscape now but this game shouldn’t be limited to people who want to endlessly grind away. It’s enough of a grind as is to accomplish big goals.
---
Remove this abomination across the board.
---
Who cares move on
---
Good idea, you put some work into this. Nope more see this idea and we could get a mod reply
---
You can bank the chipped version and just stack them up and then craft all 10k at once?
---

Finding more than an hour or two of grinding to be tedious tends to lead to sucking at XP.
---
&gt; content that required teamwork
---
This is why i’d vote.  This and the fact that the content itself was just not enjoyable.
---
yeah i just want the username of whoever my account traded at that time, really hoping it wasnt anyone close, but i searched a lil and saw jagex doesnt like to give that info out but i really really need a name. nothing else

Looks like a mutated creature, a clone from several different deformed NPCs.

well clearly we cant leave it up to the community

Taught my gf to do simple skills like woodcutting and crafting on my iPad on my account lol, she has no clue what's she's doing but she's doing it goddamn perfectly
---
it used to be twice as much you mean. they dropped from 1,3m gp/h to only 900k gp/h. meanwhile bloods have always been like 600k gp/h for virtually no effort.
---
All of the skills in that survey after straight up just bad skill ideas
---
other than this im pretty much beat so...
---
Unused character names should be released but to combat hoarders and sellers, it should be a recurring thing, not an announced event.

aw im sure he was probably just joking
---
Agh!
---
I see you aren't interested in discussing this further... too bad, could have been interesting. I'm almost getting the impression you ran out of arguments... anyway, at least you answered.
---
Yes I have bastion potions with me. Funny side note, on my second attempt I accidentally brought battlemage potions on accident so I kind of fucked my self there. Maybe things will be better 3rd time around.
---
Anyways I havent ever thought of or heard of the ancient mace in fight caves, I'll have to take that into consideration!

How do you get produce anything other than wood?

I mean, I have yet to see him lose a 1v1 in DMM when the gear was equal.
---
He only loses to people who are rocking the Clan GWD gear. He almost beat the guy when he was down ACB and Arma legs, and that guy went on to be top 4.  
---
Many people had hid picked to win the All stars tourney, which has been confirmed he had to play on a brand new mouse.   
---
Like i think hes in that top tier pkers list.
---
Bgs is important at vork. You also don’t have to bank every kill. You can spec only once and get 3 kills per trip. 
---
Although I don’t use bp so I may be wrong about that.
---
This is something that has been suggested for a while now. It's become a meme at this point, which sucks, because most of the community would be up for it.
---
Thats why its an onpopular opinion :)  i understand your viewpoint and idk whos right.  I thik the difficulty change would be reflected in item prices and it would definitely discourage some players from doing certain content.  Not everybody does ToB but some players can find teams.  Similar concept.

Underrated comment right here.

I was just getting battered and wouldn't have enough food left after 1 kill to get multiple per trip using the BGS. I'll buy it back when I have the money again, and it should go quicker than if I waited.

Fletching best method was doingnbows which was a lot slower  prayer exp is now around 1m per hour compared to around 30k? Prob less a hour cooking where y can do wines /karmab for stupid exp  smithing blast furnace look at that crazy exp

Hopefully you can send them the file and make this happen.

Would be a great way to put those dice scammers out of business.
---
Did this with a super combat in raids 1 the other day.
---
it implies that something else goes into the algorithm that bans people, and so it's not necessarily a false ban just because of multilogging or doing the same activity. Which is what the other guy that was doing corp on 5 accounts at once was claiming it to be, was a false ban

Move the duel arena there for maximum efficiency after liquidating your bank. Encourages gold sink.

The crystal implings are only in prif, right? Are they pretty common? I haven’t seen any, but I’ve only really spent time traveling to Zalcano and The Gauntlet lol

Oh yeah I really want verac skirt and helm but I unfortunately have 61 deff. And I want to complete it today as soon as I get off work. I think if I fail again I'll grind a few skills out and get some more upgrades for sure.

source?

The funny thing is that out of my 18.5k RC experience, I've gained 10.5k by questing. For the rest I only crafted around 800 steam runes, translating to a mere 30 trips to the fire altar!

Yeah editing in paint is rough, especially text after its entered

Looks sweet! What would the unique drops be?

Yeah, I would get combo’d with a few 20s or 30s in a row. Sometimes I try to woox walk and just fail and get hit hard too. Still just getting a feel for it 250 kills in

These are such a great task. Love doing ancient wyverns. I too got granite boots back when they spiked to like 5m. Best day ever

Sorry it runs capped at 50 instead of 30. Explain to me again how any part of that setup could be considered modern, fluid, or intuitive. Oh, fucking none of it. The whole client is hanging on by threads of nostalgia and “putting up with it” meanwhile potential new players are actively turned away.
---
I’m not saying it’s unusable in any way, but it is not good by today’s standards, a new players standards, or what should be TOUR standards for a consumer product that is being sold to you. You should at least expect the client to be able to display at your monitors frame rate and use your GPU and be a large properly sizable game by default. Maybe you don’t care about any of that, but does that change the fact that most people do? It’s not about the graphics at all, the user experience instead.
---
Is RS3 worth playing on as an alt to gp swap to osrs? Idk how easy it is to make money on there vs just making the money on osrs.
---
Go alch urself
---
Just promise them cash to show up and don't give me anything. That's what I did to my cc : ^ )
---
Just saying know your shit if you’re gonna try and talk it. Makes you look incompetent.
---
Agreed. I think it’s important to appreciate all the content in the game. In total there are 60+ bosses in the game and we limit ourselves to very few in our gameplay due to them being the most efficient or seemingly best gp. There are also a total of 23 skills to level up, as well as about 140 quests in the game. Needless to say, there is plenty of content in the game, we just need to appreciate it all for what it is and play the game for fun.

Don't forget for you it might seem menial but for someone like me you're like a god :)

What a lot of people don't know and what the video doesn't mention either is that you can use dwarves to block vet'ion from walking west; increasing the odds of getting him in the safespot.

He’s not a UIM but dope regardless. That’s normal ironman armor.

im even more amazed he got dragon buttplugs too. he must have talked to oziach

How is it being Nit picky, I'm just stating my opinion on how it looks like something from another game that most people in this game don't like and I fear it would go towards that direction again.

Now that's some big dick energy.

Honestly I’d love to see HD but I doubt we will see it.

Oh hey, it's Alm.

"Yo dawg, I heard you liked bankstanding, so I put a roof on your bank so you can stand on the bank while you bankstand!"
---
I never get people who do that? Clearly if people didn't like your idea the first time, deleting and re-uploading is not the fix. Brainstorm with some people who gave feedback and try to improve it, instead of just saying the same shit.
---
Look up how to get barrows gloves, that will grow your account pretty well.
---
Runelite had HD, jagex banned the people who used it so they removed it.
---
When I trained to 99 slayer I would just POH tele, pool, DBA spec,pool,Ancient mace the max hit dummy for 136 pray points, pool and Kourend teleporter back. You can easily afk for 10min using bonecrusher until agro is lost and repeat.
---
It literally uses like no data. I had it about 30 hours in one month using my mobile data and it only used like 50 mb or something stupidly small like that
---
Id say it takes quite a bit of play time to get to the point where you can get consistant money so only do it if you're enjoying rs3 while playing it.  
---
I haven't payed much attention to money gain being an ironman so I cant say much about like early/mid game gp methods, so there may be something for you that im not sure of.
---
This really is a Reddit ass suggestion lol
---
Very cool. When I get the money for construction then this sounds like a great method. Already working on bone crusher now.
---
I haven't played RS in a bit, but there were people in the CC I hung out in that would announce every single level they got. I honestly cant stand it. Things like getting 90-99 are cool and I'll gratz you, but I'm not saying gratz for fucking 55 cooking.
---
I've said this before but if it was ONLY the focuser and no one else, torvesta would have fought him or caught a freeze and logged if he couldnt.

---
Ha, I may have come on a bit strong but you're making really bold statements about the game based on a clearly jaded community of the players. Hence the trump analogy. That is textbook cherry picking data in most places. However, there's not really anywhere else for you to conduct the survey, so yeah maybe I was too harsh. In future, it would be less disingenuous if your language wasn't so representative of every player over a more pragmatic, cautioned and repeated highlighting of the fact that you're not representing an impartial audience. Also trends with players change based on their region too, as they do in almost every other game. I can reasonably generalise they do in osrs as well.
---
Yep, like how the hardcore a month ago lost his status for dying to a healer after he had already killed jad
---
Are you me? That was my first 99 too. I was broke, tho, so I did magic longs for profit. Made over 10m haha
---
HE DOESN'T KNOW PepeLaugh

I don't think so, but as long as you pray melee for the fight beforehand I doubt you will need to. I had plenty of resources left over guarding the barricade, and after beating him.

You immediately get thrown into the fight with the fragment of Seren as well, so if you want to rebank at any time be sure to bring a tele out.

PM'd you

I type "F" in the chat way too much at zalcano

You can teleport out and come back through the Pass to resume the battle.

Smh always ask an ID OP. Im obligated to call the pmods on you now.
---
For sure. Duel arena entices all that aim for wealth lol. The constant earn for wealth almost kills the enjoyment out of playing that is used to have though. With the wealth of knowledge we have in the game accessible to us compared to years before, it’s just what the game is now centered on by the masses rather than some of the other aspects like collections. It sounds kind of lame; because I know a lot of people play on a “how much money do you have” basis, but I do thoroughly enjoy the other aspects of the game now thanks solely to the Iron Man mechanics. 
---
The only half-way Con I have With limited time to play, getting something simple for a regular account like a blowpipe, for example, will take a pretty considerable amount of time for an Iron Man. But to me; that follows more along with how other RPG’s follow. Slowly upgrade/unlock things as they become accessible, less just purchasing or getting stupid lucky betting and getting god tier equipment starting out. 
---
Oddly enough, I don’t mind the grind near as much as I have previously on the other accounts, I just don’t have the time I did playing back in the day. A more Grind-necessary account doesn’t go as far as quick and it can be a little demotivating.

Almost all my Alchs, there's like \~8m missing from alching at Gargoyles and Hydra. I did stop alching at Hydra after like 800 kills (ended at 1200).

Not nice.

And you shouldn't be surprised if next time Mike Tyson beat you and said "sit" to you after you've talked trash and bragged about beating him. 
---
Wilderness is not a place for only fair fights. If you're pvming in wildy your job is to avoid getting killed by pkers and alot of times the pvmer has better odds of getting away then the pker killing them, if they are prepared for that. And they should be, if they dont want to die.
---
Alot of people in this game are toxic but people on this subreddit just make it seem like its only pkers and the pvmers are just innocent victims.

Didn't block out the price of the dagger, gg account

Next time you repost this, can you make the questions and answers actually questions and answers, they’re reversed.
---
So here’s the dilemma, you’re new and you want to unlock new content by going members. The only problem here is once you get that bond which is sitting around 4million gp you’re going to be doing nothing but trying to pay off that bond (by figuring out more money makers), because once those sweet 14 days of mems is gone you’re back at square 1. Best advice would be to spend those 11 dollars and buy a months worth of membership. But if you’re still looking for a money making guide, you could make pineapple pizzas, or kill hull giants and collect their loot to sell at the grand exchange. Idk if f2p has greendragons but those would be a good option as well. If you’re sitting on a small cashstack (150-250k) you could find something to alch. Another great money maker (a while ago was buying gems/arrows from specific shops however now they’ve given a world hop limit and it will log you, but that isn’t even your main concern it’s the other people who are doing this method). Again my advice is to get a month worth of membership by paying 11$ so you could unlock content and level up without any concern of trying to make 4m within 4 weeks for a new player
---
I like drops and clue scroll helpers
---
The rest are nice but I can live without
---
Spray some febreeze so I can ignore you instead of smell you.
---
Definitely! You can play at your own pace and it doesn’t really matter about how anyone else has done it previously. There are better ways, like you mentioned; but if it’s not fun you don’t feel like you HAVE to (for whatever reason... still wandering why it feels necessary on a normy; maybe it’s because less time doing skills or whatever = more time grinding GP?)
---
I Totally agree with you though. It is a refreshing new experience.
---
Well, you have to supply vials if decanting into lower doses, or pay 5gp per vial on the spot
---
lol no, found the gold buyer
---
Tryna be slick
---
Great.. only 95% more until 99 rc..
---
Lol I sure hope so, that was ages ago. How did you remember that?
---
So are you saying I should keep buying them at this price and I will still make profit?
---
Oh of course, I do have it off. Like I said it just seems like I either have to run around melee in a massive diameter circle, wasting run energy, or else my lil one ends up cutting across the points I clicked on and running into melee reach and I get socked up. Do ya figure is because I'm clicking to soon on a new point so my guy cuts across trying to make a shorter distance?
---
If you could recommend any videos on how to safe spot at fight caves thatd be very helpful as well! I've seen a few but not too helpful for me.

I think the issue is that most of the time you are competing against the people with you rather than the boss. Taking time to path correctly can be the difference between hitting less rocks than others and not getting MVP

Bogla gold

I'm trying to figure out what defender that is
---
&gt; A) ask a biased community
---
Any community is going to be biased. Considering how the answer align with previous in-game polls, 
---
Reddit's bias is not nearly as big as you all make it out to be. It's just that it has very vocal members (it is, after all, a site that was originally created to encourage discussion).
---
&gt; B) run the poll for only one hour, making sure to exclude any timezones that are asleep or people who are at work
---
The poll ran for 24h, so I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
He's wearing a third age platebody.
---
If you're just getting started on a regular account a few bonds are invaluable, otherwise I personally wouldn't.
---
&gt;wrong font to an image they cropped the text 
---
They didnt crop. Seems like you dont what cropping is. 
---
&gt;If you edit the text in inspect element it does it in the exact same font. 
---
Yes, my point exactly. 
---
&gt;cropped the text 
---
They didnt crop the text. They *EDITED* the text. or *PHOTOSHOPPED* the text. they *CHANGED* the text. 
---
seems like you dont know what cropping is.
---
Here every nice alternates from upvoted to downvoted sequentially.
---
Make it a transmog, and you've got my vote
---
What about the original comment that was downvoted suggested anything about unhealthy emotional repression? It's completely irrelevant to bring stuff like that up. Men should not be playing osrs all day and letting their wives be breadwinners. If you don't agree with that you're a child.
---
Thought it was going to be rs3

My 1kc blade of Saeldor says otherwise, quite lucky tho 🍀

I should've done that. Once I realized I was too far into this.

You're right, but that's not what the original comment said.

&gt;I doubt a real man would be pleased and satisfied with such a scenario though.
---
That's the sentence that I took issue with. It had absolutely no reference to some guy playing OSRS all day, not sure why you made that up
---
Wasn’t Ash the one that offered it to him though since he felt Woox got cheated out of his clever win?
---
the heck reddit, you didn't notify me jagex mod responded to me! I feel betrayed!

*thank you for the compliment though!*

this is a MMO ffs, ironman ruined this game period!

Wasnt the underground pass fail rate thing polled? So why did it get changed at all?

If still need help then let me know.

Never

So are you suggesting that you want all content from frozen to warped to be accessible at level 1 DG? If yes, that would ruin the progression of the skill.
---
Its a TzHaar fireplace, he's safe.
---
Now this is a true throwback to 2007 are ya a fuckin time traveler or something lad?
---
yes
---
Which is why it shouldn't be a skill and instead a minigame.
---
Where did you pull that number out of? Lol a chicken is 12 exp a kill, so lets just say 1m chickens to a 99. Bones are 40g and raw chickens are 29g, so 69g per kill (he). Sooo thats 69m per combat, just doing melees thats over 200m

Lmfao get mad sperg
---
Still haven't seen one at 347kc.
---
I've never reset my streak. Almost 97 Slayer now.
---
Not a furry. &lt;/3
---
Eh too excited to worry about it man just happy it’s done :)
---
It is the boss from inferno minigame, TzKal-Zuk
---
I'm just getting into Demonic Gorillas as a slayer task... man did the game drama drastically change over night...
---
99 construction

Selling them uncut for the most gold. Can craft them. Whatever you’d like.

Simply not true, you just follow the reply links.

SOTE, and untrimmed 99 hp cape
---
I don't enter the wilderness unless i really really REALLY have to, thanks for the advice though, i don't have any money for cannon.
---
nope thats trapdoors
---
I was fishing at work all day today, just got 81
---
U thought outside the box lol.
---
You can lower anything's hp to one. As I said, wind strike is the easiest that comes to mind. 
---
Not sure, but mice at Lumbridge castle's underground floor where the culimancer chest is can have 1-2 hp
---
that would be Karambwan for me...
---
You've been very helpful, thanks again!
---
No worries :p just love to see people taking pictures of screens with their phones haha. But good job on the graceful :)
---
this guy fucks.
---
not only is the ghrazi already mostly useless because of things like lance and scythe, but what the fuck did any of that have to do with "power creep" and "just become a business all over again" lmao.
---
You seem to have no idea what you're talking about and just got angry that an item you own dropped in price. If you own any item thats 50-100m+ be prepared to lose your ass on its value sometimes, it's how the economy works. 
---
Don't buy an item then watch its every price change.. Just use it for pvm and ignore the value, you already paid.

Engine work is being done to support crushing drop table bones in the future. Right now engine doesn't support it. Mod Ash confirmed on Twitter.

That's the general order i think?, i am CB 81 but Konar tasks are way to time consuming i think, i just finished the Black Demon task now and it took me around 3-4 hrs.

&gt; @rascol\_victor It is, courtesy of a major infrastructure job @JagexMaz did for centralising loot-dropping. Though for now the design is that the thing should just crush the creature's bones, not additional loot bones.

And you check your internet when it happens to ensure that it had nothing to do with anything on your end?
---
I dunno, I feel like I see this in every online game I play, in Rocket League and Overwatch I also see people complain all the time about those servers and I literally never get DC'd or have ping spikes in those games unless my internet goes down, in which case restarting the router always solves the issue. 
---
I can't think of any logical reason why some players would think the servers are shit and get DC'd all the time, and other players on those same servers would never get DC'd at all. I'm not saying this is *always* the case, but the vast majority of times I suspect it's something on the user's end that is causing them to blame the game, when it's really their shitty setup that's the problem.
---
Q
---
Ah I didn't know Zalcano had onyx drop, yeah I am sure that has had an impact. Chaos runes and onyx prices are quite closely linked and onyx's price has similarly crashed so I believe you're spot on.
---
Give this man job jagex!
---
Upvote this so this kid can make some great friends on osrs.
---
I disagree
---
By far the best money makers are all bossing or slayer related. Work towards dragon slayer 2 and finish off quest cape. 
---
Gold you should either RC or do barrows/vork/zulrah. If you don’t want to do combat I guess doing blast furnace for gold works. Not very many money makers outside of combat and rc.
---
Can you run flick?
---
Is it possible for people to join the room and click around on your account?
---
Exactly. It's just so superior shield there, but Dragonfire shield is better in overall with less ranged penalty and notably higher melee &amp; magic defenses against the minions - and it doesn't degrade.
---
But unfortunately not all Ironmen get their hands to visage. .\_.
---
Oh, thanks. Just was scrolling through slayers monsters and saw Kraken there. I haven't touched slayer much, it is in 60s, but hearing that Kraken is piss easy just using magic thought about maybe getting him as a pet by resetting tasks. 
---
Does Kraken cover the supplies you use on it if you use a private instance?
---
Oh you are so wrong, this would be no where near the first.
---
Lovely streamer uwu
---
Fuck you, OP and his nephew. Have a good one.
---
strength
---
Yes we are because you want ezscape with no risk and I want a harder game that rewards and punishes risk.
---
Nieve and Duradel also give black demons so that's not the issue. You should probably block them if they take you too long.. I can't recommend another slayer master until Nieve when you're combat 85
---
the OSRS Wiki has the solution in the walk through...
---
Diary cape... just gonna say, fuck kq
---
Thank you man some guy called me out for being a super noob bc no RFD gloves, Graceful or any of those key items but had a whip and what not so it kinda forced me to man up and grind stuff I didn’t want to lol
---
Might go back into playing again, not the best but def knowledgeable, have about 100kc. Add me Juice Inc
---
base 80's-90's combat stats would be a mid level account. base 90+ would be high level, although i bet there are those who would assert that you're not a high level account until just shy of max combat.

not my method but it checks out.

These are sweet! Any plans to make them public, or possibly to purchase? Need new alerts for the stream!

Hey thanks

Mining and Smithing be like...

It’s a nice vibe

That shit is mint good job keep that shit up too
---
Cut the other trees first
---
Well it's a combined amount of both damages for total overall damage that determines mvp. If you manage to put the most shield + boss health damage in an entire kill you get mvp.  
---
Tested with duo, I did only boss health damage. Friend did only shield damage. He got mvp because we had to go through so many rotations for me to do the 1k health damage he did overall far more damage than me. Think it took 8 rotations. 8*300=2400, 1400 more damage than I dealt. We both got rewards so apparently hit that threshold, whatever it was.
---
Fingers crossed. But you are a skiller, eh? Do you mind showing a screenshot where you own an untrimmed Agility cape while showing your stats. I just want to be certain you are telling the truth because you are very first person whom I heard this untrimmed Agility cape feature.
---
That’s awesome! Hope you see a W
---
Don’t even try instant selling for one gp unless you’re willing to sell it for one gp. You only get a transaction if people have offers in. If nobody is trying to buy that item except people with troll prices, a troll price is what you’re going to get.
---
Off in 1 hour.
---
Same.

No prep is just not preparing any potions. Synq has a solo guide

Also, you can pump the machine at Blast Furnace minigame, it gives 2 strength xp drops. In a case you want to be as close as it can be

I miss watching someone die and waiting for their loot to spawn for my leisurely taking. Used to just sit outside bandos with 40kc hopping between worlds just watching and patiently waiting.

Yea, for a few months max. Fuck off kid.

Can confirm, took me 206 to get the head.  I feel for people who did it before the tattered head and went several hundred kills dry.

---
Not a great solution because then you can't play the game.

The quality is must too good for that of a Perrier must of been a toaster

nah there isnt a reason actually they are good but idk i just hate them

Just go get it dumdum

 Verzik is most definetely a step up in difficulty compared to the other 5 but it feels so rewarding when you the fight.

Sad face, I'm over 1500 I won't be upset until I hit 5k with no drop lol

As far as i can see slash and crush defence is the same for both wyverns?
---
Don't forget to turn on auto retaliate
---
Set goals. Short, medium, and long term ones... short term like gaining x amount of exp today, medium example could be getting from 40 to 60 attack to use dragon weaponry, and a long term could be barrows gloves; avas assembler; or like quest Cape.  
---
Depending how far into the game you are can help shape your goals.  For example, I had a long term goal of diary Cape and used all the individual tasks for a given area as short and med term goals to keep me motivated to working towards the Cape.  If you just look at the reqs for it and see 86 runecrafting (91 without a boost) you're likely to say f-that right out the gate but getting to the various levels to do other tasks like 77 for fremmy elites, 82 I think it was for lumby, then finally 86 for karamja makes it not seem as bad and it gives you milestones to enjoy along the way.  
---
Granted runecrafting is probably the worst example to use, you can substitute in any skill or big goal you have then break it up into smaller grinds to help keep you motivated.  Hope this helps :)
---
99 range grinding brutal blacks. I use elite void, salve ammy, dhcb. Don’t wanna spend the 60m on rigour yet but I might. Good luck bro I love this boss. Currently on task

But he passed the online age verification.

I remember that map, fun times.

It’s all fun and games until you come home one day and walk in on her doing inferno on one account, killing Vorkath on a second account, killing Zulrah on a third account, tick-manipulated skilling on a fourth account, and deep wildy PKing on a fifth account, all simultaneously.

u/SlayerKrex: “Hey babe, I’m home. How’s the - what the fuck!?!?”

That’s an npc

Ass
---
The best thing that you can do to complete fight caves very easily, is to lvl range to 75 and buy a toxic blowpipe and fill with addy darts.
---
I killed it on my 2nd try with around 80 range 70 def black dhide top and bottom, ancient coif and glory ammy and barrows gloves.
---
Wc lvl?

Fuck that guy

Because you have got different settings, probably in RS, not runelite

Barrel chest Cannon...

I haven't made one personally, sorry. I just afk on my main and shared figures. I don't really enjoy multilogging. Definitely try something like a cannonball alt or house tablet alt first and see if you enjoy doing that. You'd need to play one in excess of like 30 hours / 2 weeks to profit on your bond cost, but they are super low requirements and the most afk things in game basically. If you enjoy alting constantly for a couple days, then start making your rune dragon alt. Only takes like 400+ hours I'd guesstimate.
---
Yeah I'm still under 16
---
Set small obtainable goals that you can achieve in a reasonable time frame. 
---
A long 50+ grind to 99 can seem endless and cause burnout. Especially if you only play a couple hours a day. Set goals based on how much you expect to play and are able to reasonably achieve in a session.
---
Also setting goals that build on each other. IE my current goal is to finish 93-99 crafting so that I can more efficiently do lava runes. This in turn allows me to finish up the elite diary's with RC requirements.
---
Nice bro
---
It read like a bad fanfic
---
I'd move back in with my mom if that happened, fuck me lmfao
---
Not the pickaxe really after maybe Steel (could be wrong) but level does. The higher your level is the less chance there is for the Stone to deplete. So dragon pickaxe is in theory better if you spec with it. Or at least you can be a little bit more afk
---
This is why i refuse to do zulrah if i have already burned through my daily regeneration from the western elite diary. Grats man!
---
She's too easy
---
For sure, definite pros and cons to each approach. Redwoods save you 5-10 hours from 90 to 99 but are click intensive and costs 6 mil, Wintertodt is a longer grind but is profitable and more afk.
---
looking for an afk moneymaker with an emphasis on afk - which is more afk, woodcutting or fishing?
---
Tf have you been doing lmao? If you do rooftops from the get go, it shouldn’t take too long. I got full graceful at 59

is a DFS worth using at vorkath with a DHCB over the anti-dragon shield?

Trust us.  /r/2007scape is jealous enough.  We can't even get customer support from Jagex, a company that's worth half a billion dollars, unless you get enough upvotes on Reddit to warrant a JMod review.

Not everything has to be balanced in a videogame.. Especially not in runescape. You could make this post about a ton of items. And if you're planning on doing that, please do it for the seercull, that weapon looks dope.
---
We already get crystal armour and weapon seeds from the gauntlet. If anything, Zalcano's drop table is pretty nuts and could do with a tune down as it's good gp/hr in both uniques and regular loot. 
---
Realistically, it fits the current pinch the gauntlet it is and doesn't suffer any consequences for doing so. Presumably, the QA testers thought the Blade of Saeldor would be so good that it would be 100sM gp. But in reality, it's worse than even a rapier and for ironmen it is probably not even more worthwhile over a regular whip, if you care at all about your time and activities/hour, over just doing TOB for rapier and scythe.
---
I'm assuming, they're presently working on an overhaul of the shards and charges they provide across the crystal equipment and the rates at getting them per hour from various activities. But they shouldn't be universally the same across all the content. It wouldn't really make sense to get the same shards/hour from hard-mode gauntlet vs. the agility course. If you want 50+ shards/hour, do the harder content. If you want to do very easy content, like agility and mining, you should have your shards/hour reflect that minimal effort and be offered much lower rates at shards/hour.
---
I bought a second phone to take pictures of my first phone while I play RuneScape on it.

it's only after i started to get good at Vorkath that this attack became any sort of a threat...overconfidence, man

Most common mid-tier money makers with low requirements are herb runs and birdhouse runs. For herb runs you'll want 38+ farming and you can start off with toadflax, then avantoe at 50, then ranarrs once you get high enough farming so that you average 7.5+ herbs per patch (around 80 farming in my experience)
---
Birdhouse runs require access to fossil island but are a fantastic way to passively level Hunter and take maybe 2 minutes per run
---
Blast furnace is also commonly recommended as you can turn a profit doing steel/mithril bars with relatively low requirements
