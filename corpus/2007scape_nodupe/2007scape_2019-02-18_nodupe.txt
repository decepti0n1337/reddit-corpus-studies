Tbh if you're that rich and don't know about skull tricking I don't know what to say.

Sorry to hear that, same thing happened to me about 8 years ago pre-eoc, lost 300M. Sucks.
---
yes but doing giveaways for votes off twitch is another matter should do something about that
---
Or if you're deadset on not doing favour, you can just build another altar in your house. I'd recommend doing arceus favour though
---
Ezscape much?
---
that other guy is like *I'm next*
---
Oops. At work speed reading
---
It felt even way better when your combat was high enough that it didn't attack you anymore
---
yeah im gonna do it eventually
---

---
just too lazy atm lmao
---
That's me
---
Very hard to do and takes much focus. My pixel hat is off to your good sir.
---
Arceus spell boom is crazy easy to get. Definitely should just knock that out then get the altar. Altar is a game changer
---
What are the ideal stats for an obby pure? 
---
From what I understand they plan on making it eventually. It requires some engine work and the engine team is working on making Mobile better and/or working on RS3 Mobile
---
I was actually pretty impressed, this question has something like 12% skip rate. It does seem ironic that all of the shills who complain about unhidden poll results all of a sudden wish to abuse the system
---
Agreed original death mechanics were better, at least let some npc at lumbridge it something collect your items after you died( like at zulrah but this would happen everywhere) and you have to pay like 5-10% value of whatever you lost to get it back. Even at zulrah/Vorkath you just pay 100k to get back possibly 100m worth of gear it’s pretty stupid. And yes why even after the hour runs out the items just disappear? Makes no sense, if after an hour the guy didn’t come back up at least let it become visible for other people to loot it. 
---
I'm in Cs. Basically no matter how fast the computer is some things cannot happen at the same time. One of the things that likely happened was the gametick checked for deaths as a more important action, and since he died later in the tick, he passed the death check until both were processed on the same tick. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Leading to a situation where this could happen, and pid would allow them to give the death to the guy with pid. 
---
Some of the options seem filler just for the sake of filler, but the interface would be simpler, with icons that are in a consistent place. I mean, huge improvement for that alone.
---
Nah man 
---
Gargoyles for sure dude. Also, get barrows gloves while youre at it. Makes pvm so much better. Make sure to grab all your untradeables too, torso/f cape/b gloves/ d def. Your combats are more than high enough. And you dont need to do much skilling for b gloves either. 
---
Camp gargoyles for a while though, get yourself 70 pray when you can and then get those untradeables. Then either go back to gargoyles to get a decent cash pile OR do konar slayer tasks. Konar is great for mid tier slayer - gives incentive to do tasks that normally drop no loot. Also DO YOUR CLUES! :)
---
whats that?

Oh yeah. I never heard of that. That's some fraud shit
---
Not an insult
---
I haven't played since the first year OSRS came out, but I still read this sub and watch some vids
---
I think it’s just pure PVP it would be OP for. 
---
Having offensive stats and strength bonus is actually pretty game changing in terms of an offhand for pures. There hasn’t been a new BiS that I can remember apart from the new books but it’s balanced because you can only choose 1/6. 
---
When those are combined it makes it pretty OP imo but would be suitable if it couldn’t be used in PVP unless it was dropped on death. 
---
S
---
Yes, absolutely--but any of those six items you have in mind have *way* better stats for what they do, and typically in RS, you're only doing one thing at a time. If I was ranging, any of the top 5 ranging shields could do it better, right? I agree that it'd be one of the best hybrid items in the game, but how often are you really hybridding? And even when you are--again, I think the +40-60 defenses from the BSS, for instance, outweigh the ~+8 offenses from this item, in the overwhelming majority of situations. I think it would be a sick item for sure, and an option worth considering while hybridding, but OP? Broken? I just don't see it.
---
This is getting some traction, come on Jagex!
---
Catherby lobster fishing by far.  I wish it was like it used to be, tons of people just telling chuck Norris jokes

the wiki found me an interesting choice by buying cadantine blood potions and wines i could make bastion potions at about 350k xp an hour for about 6 gp/xp
---
Or just remove me from existence 
---
i think he makes more in a day than u make in half ur lifetime, think hes gunna be alright
---
Just never happened to me yet. I don't die :)
---
Unless drop rates or game mechanics change it will only continue to fall
---
Gold sink I imagine for that last part. Tbh if you have a whole hour to run back then just make it so you dont lose items at all. Or i like your idea of havin to pay someone to get the loot back. Maybe a flat value though. 
---
I just think there should be incentive to actually staying alive, learning mechanics before bringing your best most expensive gear to a boss/pvm in general. 
---
scumbag sellout paying for votes

god i wish that were me

im not. i just signed off the game and went outside lol

Bottomless compost bucket it doubles the compost you put in it. It's worth around 1.5m gp. People post getting one in under 5 kc every other day here. 
---
Oh I see. I don't have time to utilize membership but I would like that cape tho
---
Fuckin amazing.
---
iirc, that lowest combat record for Jad is like 27 or something.
---
Wouldn’t it only be double dry since you can only get the pet after the elite dairy which requires 1k plucked?
---
And 1-77 is worse than 77-99 on an ult.
---
“If you have more than 1 cape, all capes in your bank will have the same effect”

Sorry, can you explain what you mean by that? Do you mean if I banked a prayer and an attack skill capes then equipping a woodcutting one gives me the benefits of all 3 skill capes I own?
---

---
Love your videos and streams. Such good content.
---
I could certainly see the Raiding Party tab expanding. It'd be useful in BA, especially, that interface is such a pain in the ass. 
---
If the PARTY tab gave a cross-chat feature, it'd be useful in every minigame in RS.
---
With your stats I recommend either farming gargoyles like mentioned previously? Or even with your rc level your almost into the moneymaking portion of it, but making money that way is boring af. Honestly you just can't go wrong with slayer unless you plan to burst every task you'll always come out on top
---
I agree. This would mostly be game-changing for PvP, and *especially* for pures. But, for instance, using the hidden requirements for GWD could help. Or we could give it a 40+ defense requirement. Definitely would need to have penalties/risk for using it in the wildy, like the repair fees for other untradeables. Could also simply make it cost 1m+ to reobtain from the Sage. It couldn't abide by the same rules as the individual God books, in terms of "oh I died with it, oh well it's free and no risk," for sure.
---
It just seems a bit out of place to have another Account tab alongside quests and such when we have an Account tab that is underdeveloped. It may be better to not add a 6th subtab for general information to make sure there is room for more in the future and we don't need to redesign it again. 
---
But aside from questioning adding a new tab and what is on it, the design is nice.
---
Yeah I’m not too concerned honestly it’s a game, I’m  just disappointed this kind of thing still happens 
---
Good idea but maybe for a completely different new weapon. Instead of changing existing content.
---
People do still pk in non-pk worlds. There's hotspots in the wild such as hill giants was a hot spot in 2006. Most notable locations where people pk at is the gate of kbd layer(solo) and the revenants cave(clans).
---
It was polled. Also wrong place to post this 
---
Was CW the reason you went missing for awhile back then
---
Hah yeah. With the obnoxious background effects and oftentimes poorly made pixel art accompanying it. Good times. 
---
For the quest thing it was more me thinking: “hey, why do we not list the total number of quests available in game anywhere?” While quest points are tied to in-game unlocks, total quest completion is a slightly more interesting number to me. 
---
Also I’m interested in knowing what makes you feel things are RS3 inspired? We already have the log in game, but it’s a physical book you have to get. It just makes sense to me to have it available anywhere in a core interface. Seems a shame to potentially lose out on functionality or useful information on the off-chance that RS3 already does something similar.

This meme format is one of the most satisfying. Love poring over all the details usually.
---
&gt; Its bis. Even 85 range with addy darts is better dps than max melee.
---
Scythe is better than addy darts.
---
If I remember correctly, it's to do with the fact Turoths have 3 different sizes and 3 different combat levels.
---
Mods explained it in a stream that they would have to design 3 different ones that would fit/scale according to each combat and size of the regular ones, or something to that degree.
---
Hope that helps :)

Only really to change it up a bit or if you want to max. Also i think hydra is better gp but not too sure, i know it was on release but may have dropped since. Also youre gonna want melee stats if you plan on raiding

Because it failed a poll.

&gt;Why don’t you poll hiding poll results?

They did, and it failed.

---
It has been bought up on stream before, as well as been implemented in RS3 last month.
---
This isn't even a QA thread for Jagex...
---
For the first time or two sure but at this point him restarting every few months is getting receptive for the older viewers I'm sure. I don't tune in a lot but I did for him bossing, now I won't again for like 5 months or so.
---
Ladies and gentlemen
---
is this in teams? just trying to learn a bit before I go. If not, how is it less damage?
---
So you would go to fossil island, cut the logs, go get them made somewhere, then tele to house? Or is there a different method 
---
Hydra is still better GP but its task only
---
I'm 95 farming and don't plan on doing much post-99 xp except contracts, hespeori and maybe a few things for the pet down the line. I'm wondering if the bottomless bucket is worth buying at this point.

Someone got my whip that I had been saving months for. I only brought 3 items in the wild like usual when all of a sudden I saw a dragon battle axe. Picked up that shit real quick, but then the guy came out of nowhere and just destroyed me. Thought I'd be fine but turns out the dbaxe had higher store price than the whip

Will you ever lamp rc and do nats? Or not willing to do the quest.

Pking like it used to be during pre-eoc is pretty dead in comparison. 
---
Edge pking doesn’t exist outside of the bounty world, w318, varrock multi is dead af, hills is dead af. PvP worlds are popular but it’s mostly rushers/spec and tele. 
---
Rev caves are popular but you need a clan to really compete. Small groups of friends can survive during off hours and be very successful. 
---
44s/chaos altar are somewhat popular spots for bridding but be prepared to hop a lot and get logged before seeing another pker. 
---
Lava drags are have some pkers now and then. Much more dead since rev caves came out. 
---
Black chins/east/west drags are popular brid spots for pures. Sometimes you’ll see a zerk/med/main. 
---
Pking population has died off outside of Rev caves and Bh/pvp worlds. Doesn’t help that there are a ton of worlds which spreads pkers quite thin. 
---

You should be doing slayer to max level ideally. You dont want to be training post max. You want to be bossing at that point. And the money you make on the way to 99 slayer is much greater than however much u think you will grind from zulrah before your sick of it. 
---
no, but if you later want another cape you have to get the item again

As someone has has taken a break from playing for a good amount of months now, this is what this sub has felt like recently (and I have no clue why)

You can do all that, and I don't know the UK's tax laws, but he's gonna be getting taxed at 45%.. he's not making that.

I don't think you 'need' all of that.  Or speed run to CoX, then grind for some big drops.

The common denominator here is you. What phishing link did you click on to get your accounts hacked?

Maybe have them be geodes you crack open, and there’s a clue inside.

This is pretty inaccurate lmao. lol @ vorkath, also max mage fire surge is higher dps than trident and sang staff @ kraken even at imbued heart boost lvls. Obv sang staff is still better because of the heals but its def better than trident dps wise.

That’s an interesting outlook and topic in general actually. The blurring of lines between functionality/content presentation and player direction/immersion. 
---
When you lay it out like that I actually agree with the notion of not wanting completionism to totally overwhelm the playerbase and create underlying expectations of how you should play. For me though it was more when that style started getting heavily rewarded to the point where you were at an objective disadvantage if you didn’t also pursue those goals. Simply showcasing a cross-section of “hey, this is what you've done” in interface form doesn’t really sully that immersive mentality (for me personally). Especially in a game like RuneScape which is so heavily progression centric at its core. 
---
Still, good points that I hadn’t fully considered. Pushing OSRS even more towards *spreadsheet simulator* and away from *fun adventure* isn't what I'd want to see in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Glad you mentioned your uim cause it changes the odds heavily and I also wouldn't be able to tell from looking at the picture

That early game grind is fun as hell, glad to see him back at it!
---
This game is highly dependent on individual training and goal setting. Joining a cc is a good idea and you'll meet people to do stuff with once you get the levels and gear. Can also be useful for asking questions. People post on Reddit all the time. If you search the sub you'll surely find a social/goal oriented one
---
Honestly I wouldn't even worry about making money right now. 
---
I would just start working on getting your untradeables/questcape. People keep saying gargoyles, which are a decent moneymaker, but there are way better ones if you put a bit of work into the account. 
---
Plus after getting the quests and untradeables out of the way, you unlock more methods of training too. So overall your account will progress faster.

I think max str bonus melee gear is a fun goal

Its mainly for herb runs.  It gets 2 charges from 1 ultra compost, so you save 1k gp per use.  It takes over a thousand uses to make back the money, which is around 2 months of herb runs.  There is also the convenience factor which is nice.
---
Yeah the old Adventurer’s log was a source of inspiration for that. I know we have similar things in the POH &amp; elsewhere but it just feels like giving it a home somewhere in a core interface that’s always accessible would be nice. 
---
Wyrms are underrated. Sure, if you're max cb hydra hunting block them. If you still care about xp though, they are great. I get like 140k def per hour poking them with lance and well below max str gear, plus like 700k in blood/soul/alchs/herbs.

You would get way less kills/hr because of banking more.

I stupidly teled to the lava maze in full graceful. thought I clicked deposit all gear at the bank, but I guess I hit deposit all inventory instead. Got pked right as i landed and **poof** full graceful gone! All i had was a stam pot, burning amulet and a wilderness sword.
---
The tele camping brainlet didnt care of course. It just laughed when I went back just to check if it survived. (Why does something that takes so many hours to grind just disappear when you die above 20 wild).

Anyway, all that to say, its nice to see a pker actually be nice.

Nothing, you can boost up from 82 or 83 to build the occult altar, it’s easier to boost from 83 but can do it from either.

You can just do it with absorptions then but it’s much less efficient. You’re still better off using the inventory slot for the absorption than a super def

NO

Just given a full blown business-like presentation of this proposed change to the gf who's recently become an osrs addict... She loves the changes but said would like the time played to be togglable.
---
maybe the reason for the delay is because he was killed before releasing a video and is putting in extra work for the final hcim video.

Yeah but without good gear and stats you cant kill them quick enough to prevent overlap. Once he ends up with supreme and prime his supplies will burn

I got a bit bored with my main so I decided to try HCIM on the side. I loved it; I've since quit my main.
---
Definitely give it a try if you have the time to sink, it brings life to content that isn't the best gp/hr.
---
Sorry requires engine work :/ /s
---
so i don't wanna tell you how to play the game, it's a game do what you want. but i'll say this- hilt and rapier are basically the 2 worst melee upgrades there are, they're only better than bcp and tassets basically. so if you don't already have prims/tort, definitely buy those instead. in the vast majority of circumstances bandos&gt;justiciar too.
---
that said, if i were gonna just buy the 3 things you said, i'd probably buy justiciar first then hilt then rapier. justiciar is the most remarkable of the 3 upgrades cuz you can just eat hits for breakfast. defender and rapier are comparable upgrades but defender allows you to use either stab with hasta or slash with a whip and get extra out of it.
---
i'll also throw lance in the ring as a probably more useful upgrade than rapier since dragons are so prevalent.
---
Or be like me with 1400 TL and lvl 19 construction through only quests and ToG: no house to worry about

Got the lil booger at a meager 30-32 agility (I don't know exactly which because I didn't know what it was when I got it.

This. Also, make and use the email on your phone only, so much harder to get a RAT or Keylogger there.

I mean, on my Ironman I solo Rex for the same amount of kill trips using mystic boots and hat, green dhide chaps, aramdyl robe top, ibans staff, strawberries for food, with 66 defense and 66 magic... if you’re only getting 15 kills per trip with full Guthan you aren’t doing it right.

It is useful for smoke attacks, and efficient farm runs (pre-set up poh)

It isn't necessary or even necessirilly useful. But it is a nice unique to have around in those niche opportunities.
---
Of course it is always wonderful with fire ______ attack (I save mine for surge), that 50% damage buff can get intense for high level pvm.

At the end of the day you need to decide if you want the +8/infinite fire runes, +15 (mage book), or +20 (kerp).  Plan your build and strategies accordingly.

You’ll definitely get one before 99; I got two by 92 on my old account. I mate have just been extraordinarily lucky, but odds are excellent that by 99 you’ll get at least one. I wouldn’t say expect one in every crate or grind solely for the tome, but if you’re just grinding the 99 then eventually you will just be pleasantly surprised.

I'll be your friend. Add Goats at Sea.

that's like saying energy pots are overpowered because you can just store a bunch in your bank rather than bring a single stamina potion because you haven't earned them yet

no it won't lol

Thank you kind sir.

Oh shit I thought it was a cheeky .exe, thanks man thats actually useful
---
thanks brother:)
---
Almost there! you got dis! 
---
I swear dude
---
What's reflect? I used to play rs3, but remember nearly nothing about the actual mechanics of eoc
---
You serious??! It got passed twice and then polled dumb a 3rd time and failed
---
This is fantastic. Do one for the settings menu next!
---
So pretty much the same as non iron
---
well beer restore like 1 hp, so why not
---
it's not like quaffing lobster irl heals you either
---
It's not, resting could be done anywhere. This is location based and a lot more niche and only really useful for new players which is the whole issue. If resting was just straight up added to OSRS, it would change metas, like you would no longer need stamina's for Sara solos for example.
---
Devalues my Hans only ironman 
---
They will drop it again. I'm sorry your rng is not ash-blessed. :(

- I found mine after the quest when I already had giant pouch
---
What a ride. Feels

Tbh I’d just like some of the ui improvements from rs3 to carried to osrs all toggle of course 
---
Holy shit this is pretty.

I’d hit them up with you 
---
just rock cake down to 1hp and stack absorptions   
---
You don’t need defense for nmz     
---
Why on earth are you subtracting tax anyway? If someone says they make X, they're always talking about pre-tax. Because for all we know, he's donating it all to charity and not paying a single penny in tax (and not making anything post-tax). Or maybe he's got an accountant who's an expert in tax avoidance.
---
Lol miss it no more I took that screenshot today, hence the updated D Med look, 99 strength cape and slayer! Its a fun private server of classic even on android mobile. It definitely takes gettin used to the cant run for 3 hits or eat while fighting mechanics again. I miss 3 hitting noobs, osrs pking is way to crazy for me.
---
This might work, but then the world would be saturated with overpowered weapons and items and it would be the only option for PVPers.
---
When is Warding being polled?
---
waiting for homeless Vet'ion looking for a job
---
This is a great suggestion! I’d love for you to write it down on a piece of paper, put it in an envelope and seal it. But make sure on the return address you put “my own ass” so it finds its way to where it truly belongs! Thanks so much! 
---
That's what im doing atm. I was thinking that the pots would be useful since it would decrease the monsters in nmz to have a lower chance of hitting me. I feel like my absorption points go down too fast without the pots. Might be placebo thou. Im using black d'hide with 70 def. Gonna get void later on when I have time
---
Yeah I totally see that. Having somewhere to look on your client for stuff would be awesome. Even if they don't do that the rest of your suggest looks awesome and much better than whats currently in place.
---
poffleCat
---
No. Get out. You know so little about this game if you cant see how bad of an idea this is.
---
Fuck I never would've seen that
---
Underrated comment.
---
Cant talk to members of the opposite sex
---
Cant be in same area as people on friends list for more than an hour and only if partner is there
---
Ahrims is only better than void mage elite with a tormented bracelet equipped.
---
But while you learn the boss its very common to do easier switches to get the hang of thing. Go ahead.
---
Just looking back at these comments, he edited the initial comment and I didn't notice. It is a lot more helpful than before 
---
If you don't get one by 99 it's really no big deal but if you do get one, you'll be able to find uses for it and it'll be a nice little thing you keep around.
---
why did you help him then? i don't understand
---
Harsh but yeah honestly lol
---
I think Jagex is planning to do something like that already. I believe they mentioned it in a Q&amp;A a few months ago. 
---
Whats the joke lol
---
Adding on to wait toothpick said, you can safespot the melee by keeping him behind the range. Then just run to Italy rock after killing the range.
---
I have had nightmares of that. 
---
Wake up in a cold sweat and log onto osrs to make sure that didnt happen
---
there's also spirit tree that teles you to ge. 
---
I have been thieving the Master Farmer for about 3 hours today and notice that the loot is awfull compared to a couple of days ago. Could it be that there was a small nerf? i only received 600k in 3 hours whereas last week i got 1.5 mill in 2 hours...
---
you stop attacking if you dc, unless auto retaliate is on
---
it was marked spoiler at the start :P
---
Idk what they're doing with these drop tables but they need item/money sinks with warding and an actual grave system 
---
This is why you use 2fa.
---
No, what I was referring to was, if you use a vorkath head on a ranging cape, all ranging capes in your bank will have the same effect thus you don't have to keep combining vorkath heads to new ranging capes assuming you lose them
---
H
---
This is how I got 99 prayer in rs2 when they were still like 1m. It was so nostalgic when I got my first task in osrs lol
---
Also no need for tank if you have a mager or two that ice barrage bandos  
---
Maybe it could only work with skilling items?
---
Nah desktop
---
Huh? There are three comments above my original one and none of them involve the word forced or the concept of being forced. Anyway, agree to disagree and all that
---
You're right, I'm not too active here anymore.  Got mixed up, my bad 
---
He wasn't streaming at the time, but his newest vid has a clip he made as he dc'd.
---
Nah what’s her reddit again 
---
Uhh you don’t have to charge it with runes all the way..
---
Yea buddy its big biiiig gay.
---
Someone promote this mans
---
This is just stupid in every possible way.
---
Yes please. 
---
You can get prime for a month at a time now and I'm pretty sure those bot farm people utilize stolen credit cards and such.
---
The loot is entirely based on ranarr and snap seeds, so its naturally very inconsistent.
---
Nope you're just having worse luck.
---
iirc jagex can't tell the difference between x-logging and an actual dc, so people would just xlog if they ever needed to safely log out/die
---
I have all chats off 24/7.....
---
TBD
---
Next level screen shot
---
How heavily does account playtime/creation date matter for account recovery? Everything looks amazing here but that playtime portion concerns me for some reason.
---
Well, you're just attaching already assembled parts to make the blade.
---
With the axe you're making it out of metal bars. 
---
Wont rise because skulled clans are camping every high total level world 24/7 getting max efficiency rev hours so there are lots of uniques coming in every single day
---
Some desktops as well have that power save mode as default, it's unlikely that's the case but it's worth a double check in your power settings at least. If that isn't the case I'm sorry I couldn't help :/
---
Yeah I did
---
 Swampletics 
---
We shouldnt be too afraid of rs3 concepts as long as combat and prayer working how they do we cant not update. Like if there was a bridge infront of you and rs3 jumped the bridge would you not jump??? but im thinking of something different then invention sort of.

Lol, no one fucking talked to me before i got my Dragon Full Helm n whatnot. Now its "hey man, come over here so i can talk to you without all this spam in the chat" then they try to get you away from the ge so others wont see the scam and warn you

Yeah with rouges

It's all good my dude thank you for responding

&gt;"who compromise game integrity"  
---
&gt;

&gt;We want a server in South America, how this compromise game integrity? little boy?
---
I went from 50-64 today at motherlode mine hopefully 68 tomorrow
---
?
---
You want to be real let’s be real. Because a good portion of the South American population on old school play the game to sell gold. Let’s not pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about 
---
Why make agility p2p restricted?
---
Turn your run off. You can ctrl + click to run or maybe shift click?  I forgot.
---
Rip
---
"sell gold" lmao
---
Ur amazing &lt;3 also wth watch your language &gt;:c
---
Here’s a video I just made of me failing terribly: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/ufyVtY8IUVM) 
---
My chats are off. No reason to talk
---
Yes, sell gold.

Chins and rc are main ones but chins are way easier to get req

---
the only thing i have against skull tricking is the fact that it jagex doesnt just make some feature that tells you who you can attack w/o skulling...... seems it should be a key feature
---
I think a real party system as well as mini-game matchmaking would do wonders for this game.
---
https://youtu.be/ufyVtY8IUVM there’s that if you wanted to see me fail. Trying again now
---
Nice! I stared in 05, still never got mine. You give me inspiration
---
NEET bucks ;)

Thought you needed about 8k points fot a roll?

Combat would be enabled, but only for the male spouse.

Funniest thing to ever happen to me!

who's this loser?

which one...? if I missed it doesn't that mean I shouldn't have any drops?
---
lul if this is the problem i swear
---
RDT
---
Love this idea. Much better than resting. I'd still like sitting though. 
---
Yeah but find me a normal f2p player who got 99 smithing exclusively f2p
---
I have experienced a similar glitch while i was in the farming guild.
---
40k people voted yes, 15.7k voted no, and the poll won't pass. Feels bad

You ever gonna end up getting crafting up?
---
Hahahaha
---
Besides turning run off, of course, you could have moved a couple steps closer to him and had a much longer row to run down. It's one of those things you kinda have to learn to look for. If you get lucky you can get a completely clean row and basically AFK that whole phase.
---
A lot of rs vids I just have running in the background, his are one the few I watch watch, cause you know the edits are gonna be sick.
---
the meme lore keeps expanding
---
we're gonna need a wiki soon
---
Rest at an Inn for like 20gp or something and wake up with full run energy would be soo cool!
---
Why isn’t the client like this yet? Seems like such an obvious improvement from the start..
---
turn your run off, if your character stops moving at all you'll be hit. Don't worry about the poison splats on the ground, they don't do as much damage as getting hit from vorkath.
---
\&gt;working in 2019 looooooooooooooooooooooooooooool

Are we blind?!  Deploy the upvotes!

 Everyone sell gold,  you judge South America as if you were the only one doing it, North America have more scamms because is bigger than  all other servers,  your  "**standpoint"**  is a joke,  But keep it up, you go far. 
---
You should charge your phone. 😂
---
I know this may be hated because people love nostalgia but I’ve been playing runescape high school and I absolutely love runescape 3 just because of all the QOL it has over oldscape and like everyone else I didn’t like the new combat mechanics but u can play with the old ones I found:D.  If oldscape got some better qol it would be really good I believe. 
---
Id prefer dungeoneering. Cox/tob will never be like it. 
---
Now you tell me why they would wipe 1/3 if there playerbase ? 
---
This entire game is pointless unless you have fun...
---
Uhm... Vorkath?
---
What's the top used on 2nd place?
---
Honestly feels more than that
---
There’s such a wide variety of personalities here. You can meet some really unwelcoming people and some really welcoming people. The game has tons to do and can be fun without being a max efficiency, or if you like to set goals and see achievements it had a well paced feel to it with rewarding achievements each step of the way. If you decide to play and need information hit me up :). 
---
Thank you bob for forcing him to make a progress log!
---
Is it weird that I know the building this reaches on Main Street in Grand Junction without ever having been inside?
---
That’s what he was going to do, he even said it at the beginning of the stream. Then 1 farm run later this account was made.
---
Don’t die. 
---
Why not loot from 2 or 3 papaya tree, this is a small sample size
---
no it's a meme
---
Clue hunter garb
---
I'll give you a double good on ya
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a lot of worlds would be more bots than players. The 2 week free trial they just handed out definitely isn’t making the situation any better 
---
Make it that you can sit on pub chairs to rest to make it more realistic
---
You just have to get them in front of the gate, then push them towards the gate and they jump over. 
---
One time I literally forgot I was playing and went afk to do something. Came back &amp; I was dead, went back to the spot and all my stuff was still there after like 15mins. Makes me feel pathetic LMAO.
---
Do you know what underrated means
---
Lol
---
Even more. If it were 5-&gt;3 ticks, that'd be a 66% increase (5 actions in fifteen seconds vs 3).
---
Old wiki is still being updated! We will not die quietly
---
YES!! WE NEED THIS!!
---
Why are so people freaking attached to a dockless draynor? 
---
Fr this would make a great emote 
---
Too late. It died... 😂
---
The lack of Kebos content on the shitty malware-infested wiki says otherwise
---
Nice!
---
Do items eventually show up to other players these days? Or do they just despawn? At least you use to make somebodies day when this shit happens. 
---
That’s selfish of you.
---
Just because you want some resources cheaper, it puts every low level out of viable money making methods. Inhibits real players, causes botting, phishing and hacking.
---
You'd think at this point Jagex would keep some sort of trade log to see what accounts are being traded as soon as something like this happens. I feel like some sort of justice will never be served to the hackers in this situation. 
---
Excellent ideas. May I further suggest that the different tab icons could be changed to something more recognizable than generic symbols with random colours?
---
Whos dick did #59 suck for that divine?
---
I always do my clues in the wildy, and sometimes i just dont wanna bank all my runes etc etc. So i can understand why pkers kill clue hunters lol. 
---
Solution:build rooms until you’ve circled the globe. 
---
What helped me a lot is adjusting the camera from bird eye view to all the way on the ground.
---
Made spotting his legs so much easier
---
To be fair, ToS lists all RuneScape accounts as their property, so it's not exactly hostage. 
---
I've seen this in action though. Friend got hacked and the guy bought like years worth of membership on his mom's credit card and when friend recovered account, his mom disputed the charges and the account was locked up until payments were made. Shit is redonk
---
I for one would welcome an economy void of bots
---
Oh my this is why pkers suck /s
---
Simple as that
---
please set up a gofundme for the victim. 
---
So I’m stuck with a konar blue dragon task in the catacombs which only has brutal blue drags l. I don’t have enough points to skip. I have base 75’s. Should I attempt to kill over 120 of them or reset my task streak of 75?
---
Yep, and personal gain is a lot easier to stamp out when Jagex bans your main
---
Zeg makker, jij slaat de hamer op zijn kop.
---
Quick everyone think of a new boss pun
---
It bothers me to know that the hacker gets away freely. I feel like Jagex should have some sort of fall back plan for things like this. Maybe a Trade Log or a alert to Mods when large purchases are made like this.
---
I’m about to do this thanks for the heads up 
---
Google it
---
Fair enough. I wish players like you didn’t play this game then. You are ruining the game I, and many others love playing
---
One like one prayer for that man! 
---
We do, until they brag about how much GP they have. I had a friend trying to show off a green cash stack to me (his first ever) who had already told me he bought bonds to sell for it. Jokes on him though, 2 days into a 3 month membership i bought for myself i got a ranger boots drop.
---
There's no prove of god and I guess ur right 
---
Please no
---
He isnt starting over, he will afk on the new hc and keep playing the unogficial hc until he dies for real at ToB
---
Yes, please fix.
---
Good
---
Yeah hopefully you get a chance to appeal.
---
Well the fact is they do ban you for it. But it's not exactly easy to detect and fuck tons of people do it. It's a problem that's just way too big to reasonably handle in any way
---
Looks like a mix between B0aty and SkillSpecs
---
I’m the 99% bud
---
Witch's house
---
Jagex mods liked this ideas aaaaages ago. And it should be used by pures 
---
50kc all i got is a torch
---
I think it's a spirit shield with the green background bleeding through
---
IMO their reasonable rates keep Jagex bond prices honest.... 
---
You’re right. You guy’s are just fertilizer
---
Who other than boaty is faulty of the disconnect?
---
No, you have a ceremony. That's just not the same thing as a legally binding marriage, which is what happens in Throne. Similar to real life, you don't need a huge event to be married, just recognition from the state (in this case, the king)
---
It does give better accuracy but the monsters you want to burst have such low magic defence that you will hit them all the time anyway. As such, prayer gear is preferred as it reduces the cost of prayer potions.
---
The only magic gear that one should consider is that which increases your max hit, like the occult necklace and tormented bracelet.
---
Devalues hans
---
Btw Who are you mad at? Bots? Jagex? Or the gold buyers cause it seems that you're some what ignorant Lil kid Who is hitting puberty 
---
i always wondered how many employees jagex had back in 08/09/10/11 when membership was 6$ per month and they kept updating the game wth relatively decent/big updates. (like 2 quests per month, minigames, bosses and other stuff) i'm quite sure the team was bigger then the 20ppl we currently have.
---
You just mule everything and launder it through the DA like every other gold farmer...
---
Fucking shredding lol
---
It should be a serious crime that we are not allowed to do this. I literally spent around 2 hours trying to build my house in a way that it doesn't have any doors leading to the outside with random doors.
---
And now my house is twice as big as I initially wanted. Fuck.
---
Isn't this what my $11 is supposed to be doing jamflex itself rather than the current updates that I can't simply understand or wtf is doing? BTW support
---
Nothing like getting your loot after 3 weeks and getting dropped in 2 seconds by scenery.
---
No u :) and sorry won't happen again D:
---
&gt; logging in to a dead bitch
---
If they could literally just use any other word it wouldn't be SO bad. Like if they just said funny comment or something, it would be completely pointless still, but at least not blatantly inaccurate
---
You’re supposed to change prayers before they shoot the projectile you want to avoid being damaged by and you not getting blue numbers isn’t a bug it’s just you missing the prayer flick 
---
Im curious why they haven't added more runite ores.
---
ya it would be gay, rs3
---
What are you mining there friend?
---
When I do it, it hyperlinks me to the wiki guide and "source=runelite" is in the URL.
---
Achievement diary changes and quest list ones looks good. The remaining doesn't seem necessary
---
sir tiffy/krystillia do not give option, checking merlin now.
---
he didnt do it either
---
Yeah and the npc thing should work too according to their tweet. I havnt had the chance to play so i assumed it was runelite only from this as I didnt read anything about it on the osrs update page
---
 https://twitter.com/RuneLiteClient/status/1096023415876665344?s=19
---
Nex was added before rs3/eoc you fucking chimp
---
I wonder how many ways they have to split that cash stack. 
---
Do you know what funny means
---
Seems like you have a nerve struck because you've posted this like 5 times lol
---
I did it 2 times in mining guild haven’t went back. Not very good gp at least around lvl 90 when I did it but I play off hours and it wasn’t that bad. The amount of time I’d spend mining 2 rune ore means I’d never hit logout timer.. I’d say 50% of worlds were free though
---
But a profit can still be a potential loss. If he made 5k there but with the same time expent could make 6k elsewhere, he potentially lost 1k.
---
Thanks for the free loot. Should've hidden your orange feather collection.
---
drippy bruh
---
Just change the title to "perfectly legitimate business deal" and you're all good. It's not an accusation if people decide for themselves that it's wrongdoing.
---
Downvote bcuz too much same
---
Staking has always been popular and has been around since the early RS2 days.
---
They're practically as easy to smith, the powerful abilities of the godsword underrates the complicated process of smithing an addy baxe.
---
Yep, in like the past 2 years.
---
Every time people complain about botting, hacking and Phishing I want to put it up again to remind people.
---
I think *cut logs -&gt; tele house -&gt; tele wc guild for sawmill -&gt; tele house -&gt; do the thing -&gt; tele digsite -&gt; boat to fossil island -&gt; cut logs* would be the best route for teaks. Not sure tho.
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
I’m guessing it’s due to their mechanic where they send items to the bank being too difficult to change.
---
Yeah in my experience even at the lowest point of the day maybe 1/8 worlds were free, and the ones that werent already mined had 1-2 people there already trying to mine it
---
And if there's two rocks free and somebody logs in, the asshole will always run to your rock and try to steal it instead of mining the one with no one on it. cocksuckers.
---
I'm happy they have this area in the game. I made a F2P, no vendors, Cooks Assistant only Ironman and I'm pretty sure this is the only F2P mining spot that isn't infested with bots.
---
Stupid childish suggestion.
---
Since his name is reddit karma, I assume he exaggerated and staged the reaction to end up on reddit
---
This is wonderful. I don’t see how this could be bad whatsoever
---
I'm sitting at the bar should I add a timer of extended run energy
---
Money rolling in means that he'll be motivated to do anything in the game. 
---
well damn that was condescending 
---
Easiest way you can secure your account is create a brand new email account and only use that email and password for runescape and 2 factor that as well as your runescape account
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature.
---
If you're training on ammonite crabs, it's ez pz to go for a birdhouse run every 3rd reset.
---
Heres a few quick ideas Ive had! Comments and Criticism are welcome! The more ideas we can put together for warding the more fleshed out the final product could potentially be! :)
---
Did you get slayer exp?
---
shayzien house hood, body(2), legs(1), boots(1), gloves(1)
---
He's always that overly edgy guy
---
I know i've done this before on main, but cant on this account lol
---
It would be easier to ban the people that buy gold then larger number of bots that come into the day each and every day
---
you pay 11$ to not be retarded and secure your account properly?
---
Ah. I'm just a normal account, and haven't even unlocked lunar yet. Hell, I only just started not long ago, so don't even have most of the skills I'd need to do it.
---
While I have you here though, what's it like playing ironman? I didn't know what it was really, since it's new to OSRS(as opposed to the original RS2).
---
Incredible. I would suggest they remove the Zeah favour tab and just incorporate it within the Archetecural Alliance mini quest.
---
You realize you necro'd this post right lol :P its from over a month ago. 
---
It does suck that its so cheap now. However honestly for what the weapon does, it shouldn't be expensive. Being a raids locked wep made it expensive. But it has no use..for like anything i can think of tbh. Other than a 60 att pure or something training against a weak to stab mob. 
---
Yes i know im missing the flick, im trying to understand why, according to the runelite page ON the prayer flick helper you are suppsoed to double click as the bar resets, but when i do that the prayers jsut deactivate and i take damage, sometimes i even lsoe prayer points doing it and still take the damage, implyign the prayer WAS active long enough to drain a point without protecting me.  Then soemtimes i DO go a minute or so with prayer active and without losing points, but then randomly it swaps to having no prayers active at all... Its like the game itself cant keep up with my rapid double clicks, and its very frustrating.
---
Damn dude, thank you for all the effort you put into writing that. It taught me a lot!
---
Resting itself is useless I don't see the point in adding it anywhere.
---
This is a weird choice, well done.
---
20 is the obvious winner for me, truly a specimen of a man, elegant and graceful yet simple and oh so refined
---
Annihiliate my arsehole cause this is where it is at.
---
I don't know what I expected
---
Yeah ive done regicide. Maybe I'll give zulrah a try. But to ask again - wont I need higher mage? Or do i range the whole thing? I'll have to check out a guide for zulrah. 
---
Honestly i make enough money to sustain myself and gain decent profit still just by doing slayer. I'm only 81 slay but pushing for 85 to start seeing more money with Abby demons and such. 
---
But I do want a nice boss to do, so zulrah seems to be the one currently I should aim for. I don't really want to grind void yet for vorkath and the stats for ds2. 
---
I mean, you can get by missing 5 spaces in your inventory.
---
bro please take this down before my girlfriend sees this and leaves me
---
Sell nieve nudes
---
I've always liked the absurd levels for mining and smithing to be honest. I've always just looked at it as the basic armours (bronze - rune) are separate and have spread out skill reqs and then newer items have more up-to-date requirements. Never bothered me enough to want it changed 
---
and literally every hard clue reward
---
Drained it.
---
oh true I forgot about mounted skill neck
---
I would not play
---
22 got robbed imo. If I was given class previews that SCREAMS druid.
---
Different stashes, one easy, one hard

So I just finished DS2 and have about 37 vorkath kills. I'm using void, blowpipe, and the BGS spec. My first upgrade was getting the special attack recharging pool. Now what? Should I get my construction up? Should I get rigour? Should I save for a DHC? I'm teleing after 1 MAYBE 2 kills, only done that once so far. What would be the best upgrade for me in terms of speeding up kills per order. What order should I do these upgrades? Also worth noting I use clan wars to POH to lunar isle.

Fantatic movie by the way. Always interesting reading these posts from either new players/new to p2p players. Simple, easy formatting. As a new player myself it's quite enjoyable. Keep up the grind man!

I'd love to know if anyone has ever had the full 10 contracts in a row or not yet. I think my record is 5. They should implement some sort of counter to see how many you receive in a five minute period or something

yeah it's just something to have on while you whittle the hours away on runescape. Like the radio or the TV, people will just have it on in the background to make their mundane time slightly less grey

Not really true. Bots exist because people are lazy.

That's not an accusation? lol, implying that someone did something wrong (with or without evidence) is by definition, an accusation. Direct that shit to the appropriate channels, not reddit.

Agreed but I admit I voted no on most new content of the time, fossil island, zulrah, Kourend, etc. overall I’ve been pleased enough that I vote yes to these types of things now. For example zulrahs drop table is OP but the way everything works around scales and venom\the fight itself turned out to be good content. Point is, jagex has surprised me and I almost always feel the content itself they propose is enjoyable just the numbers behind them can be whack. Zulrah is fun to kill for money, even at 1m gp hour people would farm zulrah so I wish they’d tune things like this. While I’m on the topic of zulrah fuckinblowpipe is a dps weapon shouldn’t even have a spec just doesn’t feel right, maybe look at lowering range strength a bit, mostly though finding right attack bonus with its poison effect is always how it should’ve been balanced imo (why does healing off of a blowpipe even make sense am I missing something.. if it does have a spec at least make it closer to dragon knives/throw axes or make chance of poisoning on spec hit higher Damn)

Meanwhile I HAVE to run around in full graceful and look like everyone else. Sad.

the game was actually easy back then to complete pvm-wise. Max gear was complete GWD, barrows and 85 slayer for a whip. Gratz on maxing out your gear.
---
When I looked at  karamja diary and came to Elite, and realised I need 91 runecraft or 86 with boost, I gave up hope.
---
Yeah and people that buy gold usually enjoy the game and like it, so I am appealing to the players that are thinking about buying gold and if they enjoy and want to support the game to buy bonds which help develop the game rather than botted, hacked and phished gold

The fix for me was to turn off battery saver

I literally got my first fire cape yesterday on my pure. feels amazing right? :D

The sponsors rarely are for him. Most of the time he does them for the community and uses the money to buy other rs streamers equipment.

Yeah blowpipe is pretty OP in fight cave. But as a pure its still rather difficult because you get absolutely destroyer by rangers. Even the 45 melee's hit constant 7's :p

ye and his job also pays about 20x more than average jobs :)

you wouldn't even want to do that if you made 500k per year?

ShareX master race

The issue wasnt the spirits purely. Rune becoming a t50 ore had a big part of why it dropped in price. For example if a drop was 200k of rune ore before, the same drop now would be 20k because rune went from about 12k per ore to 1k.

That too, ShareX is the best

When you drop holiday item’s it will give you a warning saying ‘you can retrieve this item from django at draynor’.

The problem is that people with 99 smithing will feel devalued now thag rune would be 70 at most. I don’t understand the whole devalued concept of it makes the game better but whatever

That is the best thing I've seen

My bad. It's a 24-hour restriction.

I usually rush quests when I make a new account, so I never noticed.

Alch them. Then yourself. Then me.
---
This does help, I have a base of barrows in all combat stats with zenytes and the bp/trident/whip.
---
I do need to look at what other activities I do and then build more into those (ancestral for zulrah for example) But I can't afford all the arma/anc/bandos as of yet so I keep switching between the three. I should just lock 1 in and be done with it, at the cost of being inefficient in the other 2.

When is the YouTube series?

Been playing this game for years and have had several accounts, I just wanted to get into PvP but I'm being punished for playing the game in its intended way. I wasn't thinking about manipulating the combat level system to hide attack lower leveled players when I made my accounts.
---
It's especially crappy because now I either have to buy 2 memberships or pick and choose what I want to play for a month at a time. There has to be some viable methods for me to participate.

For zulrah most kills/h it's still Magic+range BIS, not tbow. However, tbow only zulrah is basically afk so many people choose to do it that way if they have a tbow.

You dont make any of the equipment that uses bars at a furnace, except for things that use molds, which is an entirely different process than smithing. I'd say using a forge to heat the metal is implied or you couldn't make anything.
---
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🤙🤙🤙💯💯💯
---
Ah. :o
---
might aswell use dark bow spec then instead of tbow, for the nice chance of a 48-48 :)
---
How often would it realistically be used for pking? Enough to ruin anything? I highly doubt it. The top maybe 5% of players in terms of bank size would be able to afford it. And of those, few would use it to pk.
---
Bury some bones.

Same.

I swear this sub is the reason why I stay up to date with Jagex news posts and casually play again a few times a year.

Why not, atleast its orginal idea that none has done yet
---
The game itself is good. fun bosses, nice playstyle. But yes this hurts, i dont play anymore though, it would be a lovely game without all these keys.
---
chances are the player might not have time to drop everything, especially at chaos elemental which can involve having the entire inventory full

At least in my opinion when I saw this I felt that it is strangely low. But I cannot explain why. That's why I asked. Maybe it is normal.
---
These are amazing
---
For now if you want to enjoy the game on lower ping you could try using a vpn untill scarlet/belgacom wil fix their stuff. 
---
Using a VPN changes my ping to normal for some reason (idk why) but it works for now.

Also, if anyone of you owns the game Rust, my ping is also 300+ on every official server there. (there are maybe 3-6 servers with 30-100ping the rest is 200+)

Yeah i've come to accept dhide's ability (plus it means I can wear zarosian) I'm going to be farming zulrah for the tanzanite mutagen and thats my go to once i'm not skilling so good mage gear is important to me. I can use bgs in most places because I don't really do tekton raids. Tied between bandos and anc for gear slots rn. I don't really get any max hits other than with ferocious gloves prims and obsidian legs so melee isn't all that important. I might just keep quiet about my gear, lock in what I have an just move on.

Swap farming guild and warriors guild teleports on the equipped max cape. 
---
Yes, I'm aware. I just meant the elite offer both teleports, so why use the shortcut **ever** since the gloves are much faster to any location than hopping the agility shortcut.
---
Maybe add a basement with some other additions, and the furnace a little walk away plus a few clicks, or having the furnace outside in a workman's shed or something (still inside the guild it's self, just outside where the cows are.) Therefore adding a few door clicks to access it? 
---
I think you'd still drop out on the fallback to a secondary or tertiary network.
---
Oh ok true
---
Yes quite possibly, especially among the ironman community. Though I imagine something like boosting XP rates further may not be the way forwards, maybe offering more convenient/afk methods of doing things would make today's player base more likely to use them. 
---
As far as I know the only people using the crafting guild are those with 99 for the free teleports to the bank, and the f2p ironmen mining silver and gold for crafting. 
---
Don't think I've seen anyone in the cook's guild for the past few years aside from collecting the cape.

System security is not just about preventing an attacker from gaining access to your details -- this is treated as an inevitability when evaluating the security of a system.
---
System security is verification of the user's information, and compartmentalization of system sub sections to minimize impact of a potential breach.

A submarine that has a strong hull is nice -- but when the torpedo breaches, you want to make sure the thing doesn't flood after one hit, otherwise even the strongest submarine is as vulnerable to a minor hull breach. As a crude equivalency you may be better able to understand.
---
I'm unsure how secure Jagex's internal information stores are -- though I'd wager not very if an employee could waltz in and steal and then leak user information. The issue is the lack of important information required to gain full access, or enough access to cause debilitating damage. Of which the answer is an email address and a password. Not hard to get.
---
I can see why Jagex did it though. 
---
Back in the day we played on small resolutions and mobile users do now as well. We also didn't have HP/Prayer orbs. So it overlaps your character and you couldn't see that you were dying. 
---
That should n\t be an issue anymore, but it might be hardcoded in spaghetti that would require engine work and all that jazz. Would love it though. 
---
I never evn questioned their efficiency I just thought they were fun and might as well.

Do you think this was intentional? Everlasting hard? 365? That’s how many days are in a year. Serious erection....

Other mmos have mods i guess just from what i see its very un-runescapey i couldnt care less tbh but its strange to see some feel like they belong on a bot client
---
It will probably fail, jagex will change something and it will be polled again as a double negative and pass on a technicality.
---
Or option 2. They will hold something like imbues ransom and remove them from to get it to pass. 
---
Can you move gilded and 3rd age into it's own tab in the collection log? They're rare as hell and no one will complete them anyway. Would motivate alot of people to do hard/elite/master clues.

Oh wtf, it was at the top of my feed. Hella weird lol.

I agree, it's only real use was for vasa and even then there were much better options. I used d sword at vasa after spending my whole bank on 'other' raid gear

Will shamelessly repost a QOL suggestion from earlier today: 
---
[Improving the quest tab functionality.](https://i.imgur.com/SuvjHN7.png) 
---
Either: 
---
 - Giving the 4 sub-tabs permanent buttons, 
---
 - Adding Raids as a permanent 5th tab, 
---
 - Or even adding a summary page as a 6th.
---
Literally any random
---
Remove enchanted key from steel key ring please! It doesn’t make any sense to be there as it disintegrates at the end of its respective miniquest, forever leaving an empty key slot on the ring.

Just sell your marks for Stam gems and sip stand lol, graceful isn't worth its price

I just had another idea too, it'd be cool if this filtered your bank for you while you're looking at an inventory preset, so it just shows the items in that preset
---
Fuckin Cyrus
---
Gota remember, Addy plate used to be the best and Jagex never dreamed anyone would get a skill to 99, let alone have players like Lynx Titan or those guys that 99 Fletching in 6 hours.
---
Feel free to do what you want ofc. If it was me (who'se died on 10 HCIM) I'd do 1-5 hard bosses per day and reduce the time where a DC would kill me. Not camp lol
---
Or they'd just ban Belgian players. They'd make more money selling the keys and excluding Belgium rather than getting rid of the keys.
---
So brain dead he votes no to pvp content LOL

They want you to get hacked, so they buy bonds on your account and in the end you owe them hundreds of dollars to unlock the account.

Swapping is a for a trust trading.

That’s more likely to happen. In the short term. But slowly each country will reveal there stance on the situation. Will just have to see what happens then 
---
I could get behind the idea of changing mining in osrs so that its more like woodcutting, i.e. you get multiple ores from a single rock, but the idea of ores never depleting is a bit overkill in my opinion. I mean, we basically already have this with MLM, but I fucking hate that place.
---
They could even make it so different ores had different average yields, so iron and rune could only ever give you one ore, but coal and mithril might give you 5 before they deplete.
---
I just wanted to say...
---
I started talking to a girl i met on a dating app.

And we really like each other, probably meeting soon, as we live 2 hours apart it isnt the easiest thing to plan out.

And it was her idea.

I really like her, my dudes.

Buying GF =/= XP loss

Cool, never thought of that. Hope you get some RC in eventually
---
I assume your formula also adds the cost of runes, which are assumed from their GE prices as well?
---
Does the formula include the cost of fire runes? Could maybe make a toggleable option to exclude/include the cost of fire runes, since most of the time people use a fire staff or similar, but might opt not to when in a slayer task.

Mobile QOL:
---
Stop actions interrupting a long press right click.
---
E.g. If I use a herb on the tool leprechaun and long press the leprechaun while running over to him from the herb patch. 
---
When I reach him, the ‘leprechaun notes your Limpwurt roots’ message appears and the long press right click box disappears.
---
Desktop doesn’t behave this way with right clicks, so it’s weird mobile does.
---
It’s pure QOL because it should be changed and not polled, everyone complains about how long right clicking takes on mobile, so this would help. 
---
More? There are none
---
Make Tithe Farm left click; it suffers from the same problem chompies used to have. 
---
Lmao Jesus christ
---
&gt; The fact is maxing is reserved for a very small minority, always will,
---
Not its rofl. If we had 2013 XP rates we would have around 200-300 maxed players, we already have 20 times that and people are maxing their alt accs too lol. Extremely casual achievement. Youre just a noobie. No shame in being a noob.
---
So? 2 people can’t have similar ideas? Honestly I think it’s silly you basically had to post an apology with a link to other content that is mildly similar. Keep making your Oc. 
---
I'm Belgian. In Apex Legends, the lootboxes tab is greyed out for me, so most likely jagex does something similar
---
Well *technically* it’s two heads.. gz on pet!
---
Lol the fuck you talking about. You gotta be willing to look for and take anything as an IG model, guys or girls. They are some of the thirstiest MFers out there. 
---
Look up some stories from instagram models trying to get their starts, and you'll be reading through some really, really uncomfortable and degrading shit.
---
I know it's hard to realize with all the pretty pictures, but not everybody is Kylie Jenner on Instagram.
---
At least you didn't try and tell us you were hacked or something.

+1 Internet points for honesty.

Even if this wasn't OP, it's clear that the RNG happened to someone, which still makes the title completely applicable. 
---
Rip. I got it in 17 kills without plucking, I am a chompy whisperer although.
---
Yeah and thats not a lot by RS standards. Thats why we have 6000 maxed players. If we had 2013 rates we would have 200-300 maxed players by now. A significant difference. 20 times more than we should have and its over 10k at the end of the year. Enjoy the decline.

What's the story?

I'm talking about if they were to lower the requirements for rune to like 50. To prevent people feeling devalued they could introduce something more valuable.
---
NSFW Please, don’t want to see this filth.

Sounds like your fault tbh.

Yeah it was lol

Ah so just OSRS addiction like the rest of us then.

God I hate everything that you are. 
---
What distro? RL works just fine on my laptop running linux using the executable jar.
---
For starters it is a pvm drop. It will also have its limited uses in pvm from what i have read on others posts. 
---
It is a PvP item that can be done without imo. 
---
Only change the ore spirits do is take away direct material drops but instead u get bonus materials later when you use them. It makes it so 1 way or another you’ll eventually have to skill to get the resource. If only the value of them wasn’t so disgustingly low and they actually matched the boss with the correct tier of ore then it’d be better but end game bosses dropping t50 ore doesn’t make too much sense. A couple of bosses were fixed by having them drop higher level ore but it’s still ore that most people don’t mine. The main ore mined would be the anime ore rune ore and bane ore at this point and no bosses drop anime ore stone spirits.
---

Is it different?

Shit happens, ive fucked myself plenty of times buying and selling rares when I though their price would change a vertain way. More often am I wrong. Ive stopped trying. Im sure you wont do something like that again :P
---
I'm not actually talking about the game here. I don't really have an opinion on that, but people were talking about whether it's harder to smith a new sword or repair a shattered one and I was just weighing in.
---
More like evil tree
---
Actually this values your devalued-skill-only ironman by adding more devalued content to the game. 
---
I only really know because of Konar assigning Abby Demons there as a task hahaha
---
This is amazing.

Nah, just make a bridge from there to Rimmington and then to Crandor.

Disconnections while not in the wilderness or PVP world's instantly logs the player out regardless of being in combat or not. Would save so many uncontrollable deaths on HCIM!

Oh my
---
Yea, a few friends of mine want to take a stab at a restriction ironman but it's really fucking hard to think of something that's: 
---
* Fun to play. 
---
* Has interesting content to work through that it can stand on as it progresses.
---
* And a Strong and locked in end goal to progress to and accomplish that's difficult, interesting, and satisfying to beat.
---
Region locked ironmen are even harder as they need a location that has everything required to level and reach those goals.
---
Jagex should see the potential here. People are being drawn into this because it's like a new way to play runescape. A runescape with new goals/challenges that not many have attempted before, you get to *forge your own path*.
---
Jagex could make more locations viable for location restricted ironmen. I'd just mark up the map with zoned out regions for each location and make sure there is enough necessities to generally survive as a location locked ironman.
---
If that is your character wearing the trimmed Music Cape in the picture, I don't think long and tedious tasks are really too much of an issue for you. 
---
I wrote a program awhile back that fetches a list of items to alch given input of how much you're willing to lose per alch (or profit). Most of the time it returns back items you'd expect, with low GE limits tied to items that are good with alching. Sometimes you get lucky and find a bulk item that works.
---
Anyway, you can PM me if you'd like to use it (may take some time to respond, I haven't created a distributable copy yet). Otherwise, it's just simple math and using OSBuddy's exchange API for grabbing prices.

Can you make it so the "deposit worn items" button is hidden in the bank deposit box if you have it hidden in the bank also? Can you also make a bank pin needed to use leprechauns when you first log in?
---
I wouldn't recommend completely hiding them until after the poll finishes. Because 3rd party clients could gather data and utilise it to their advantage (e.g if any buff/nerf is polled, they could buy/sell the item based on polling data).
---
Although, hiding them until after voting seems completely appropriate.

I understand this sort of thing happens all the time. But in my defense upon seeing her post I really had no idea what the situation could of been. It is very well in the realm of possibility, that they could have seen my post. It's so easy to be quick to judge and jump to the conclusion that someone else stole your idea. I'm sure a lot of people would of handled this a lot differently than I did. But regardless with the limited information I knew I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Their post may have gained more traction. But considering just how similar our initial designs were, it could have easily gone the other way. I believe Kmilz understands that they don't necessarily owe me anything. And I'm sure if it was someone else - I definitely wouldn't of received any form of response at all. All I can say is Kmilz is a very kind and understanding person who was able to see my perspective in all of this. And I'm sure if our positions were switched they would want me to do the same for them as they did for me.

True, you right, but the other guy is also right that I definitely COULD throw out like 50% of my bank. Like I have one of each armour set that I've obtained up to this point... so.. cant imagine a reason I'd ever use any of that. I just enjoy having them all neatly sorted in my bank lol

I'm rank 4 lvl 3 in the game, RSN Rikdo Koshi. If you need any tips message me in game my chat is usually turned on.

The best money makers for lvl 3's would be hunting black chins, Blast furnace, Blast mining, and Smithing rune 2hs. Other good money makers that aren't as good are motherload mine, crafting blood runes, thieving ardy knights, and fishing minnows. I probably missed a few but everything else is either below 300k gp an hour or really bad xp making them not worth doing.

discord is a better example...

Add the Tournament/Unrestricted Worlds' Clan Wars maps, Falador Park and Lumbridge Castle, to the main game.
---
They are fully complete, functional, etc. Copy-paste them in, please!
---
Well it sounds like he offered helpful advice for your problem. To be fair, jagex is unlikely to add bank spaces/a 2nd bank simply becuase you "enjoy" having never used items in your bank. 
---
We should remove polling from the game client and put it back on the web. Then hiding the results would be easy and drama free (besides removing the game client polling which wasn't needed anyways).
---
You are a pedantic one.

Well I’m almost maxed and I’d still like the late game content to slow down a bit. I’d rather the game have more longevity so I can continue to play for the next 5 years+ than just pumping out content
---
It takes a lot less than you'd think.
---
If the account is old and you have friends in game that you chat with often, chances are you've talked about bits of your life that could aid in getting your account recovered. 
---
The solution is, have no long term friends and don't have casual chats with strangers. Or, optional delay on removal of auth and a rework if recovery system.
---
I remember when they changed it to this and I was so sad the old animation was gone... fuck you jamflex and smd op

because rune is absolute trash as armour, was inflating gold, and devaluing skilling.

It may not exactly be "QoL" but in a way it is.
---
Find the farming location guide online for easy learning. Start with allotments, and move your way up to herbs and trees/fruit trees. Trees and fruit trees are the best exp, and you should do the highest level one you can all the way up to 99. If you still need some help later, i can go through a couple runs with you later, when I get home from work. :)

Make charter ship travel easier. Show cost next to locations on map and insta-pay and travel on clicking the destination. Also have players load directly onto the dock instead of having to cross the gangplank. 
---
* Make the Graceful Set Effect scale per piece worn. This could be same as weight reduction (3% Hood, 5% Top, 6% Legs, 3% Gloves, 4% Boots, 4% Cape, and an extra 5% for using full set).
---
* Add Right Click Spellbook Options to the Ancient Altar, Lunar Altar, and Dark Altar in the POH. Currently, only the Occult Altar has this option while the others have a left click Venerate that opens a dialog with 1 or 2 options.
---
* Allow the Rowboats on Fossil Island to row to all locations. Currently, the Base Camp Rowboat cannot row "Out to Sea" (Diving Area) and you need to go to the Northern Coast, then Out to Sea instead.
---
* Add a Right Click Reset to Hunter Traps like Bird Snares. Currently, only Box Traps have a reset option.
---
* Make Fungicide (refills) stack. Allow a Fungicide to be used on a Fungicide Spray of any amount to top it up to 10.
---
* Make Fungicide Spray automatically reload the refill from inventory when it runs out, possibly as a Slayer Unlock or part of Shroom Sprayer.
---
* Give Veos a Right Click Travel Option for each location instead of just "Travel" with a dialog menu.
---
* Add an option to select a left click on the Jewelry Box like you can with Nexus and Amulet Mounts.
---
* Allow using a GE Box Set on a GE Clerk or GE Counter to unbox it.
---
* Add a "Take All" option to the Cleaning Tools in the Varrock Museum.
---
* Remove the "Pick" option on Zygomites when Attack Options are set to hidden.
---
* Allow players to build a Dorgesh-Kaan Portal in POH using 100 (1000 for Nexus) Dorgesh-Kaan Sphere or the supplies to make them. The Troll Stronghold Portal already uses a Teleport Item instead of a Teleport Spell and better accessibility to Dorgesh-Kaan could help the city be less dead.

I don't see how that would devalue it. It's not like players with 99 smithing are wasting their time smithing rune platebodies.

Make it so you hit the bell with the rock hammer/ throw hammer. Would be nice to see a little animation too
---
Can we remove the confirmation screen when quick-paying a farmer to protect your plants? It is currently quite annoying when you want to do a quick tree run on mobile. 
---
Imo the confirmation screen is pretty unnecessary since it mostly involves obscure low-value items that players deliberately carry with them for the sole purpose of paying for protection.

Wasting memory with a single picture
---
As someone mentioned, GP got inflated a bit (especially by runite items which have been reworked by Mining &amp; Smithing rework).
---
Additionally, the price is still risen quite a bit due to premiere membership, they are usually around ~14-15m each, and the amount of other things you can do with bonds outside membership probably drives the price up a bit.
---
What content is this? 
---
Myself and all the people i knew on the game, They played for the fun, not for the hiscores, thats the thing compared to osrs there arent many people that look at hiscores. On rs3 all we really did was bossing and chilling with people. Yea alot of maxed people.. but as i said its a completely different game, where its fun to be maxed in different ways.

Note asside, i dont play anymore :p

"Would only delay the inevitable" 
---
Yes would give you a chance to secure your email and stop all your gear from being stolen
---
"They already have access to your account" 
---
So just let them take everything since they already have the details? This point I don't understand. Sure they can change things and look at things but the time you put inti gaining wealth on the account isn't lost.
---
"Need to be actively monitoring"
---
Valid point and agreed if they have access to your email they can delete any notification from jagex so maybe they ability to send a text when something changes on your account like gmail does.
---
Changes to old detail
---
Agreed but I feel more security is better so why not both.
---
"No one else has delay"

True but where else does the damage done by hacker lose everything without a chance to get it back like WoW where they will give you what gear was lost back.

That wasn’t being a smartass. It does, watch the clip and read the updates, be informed. It’s very obvious watch the splats. Please don’t try to be a dumbass here.

Hey now no reason to get so upset there, you seem to give a few too many fucks.

I wouldn't call spelling something wrong repeatedly a typo, so much as just being ignorant.

could you have logged to a different world, walked to your items, and hopped back in?

One time, during a double xp weekend the keys were doubled and I photoshopped one of those “free offers”
---
For keys to make it look like I had completed it, made a ticket to jagex and they gave me all the keys for completing it, the promotion was like skilling based so I got pretty much 5+ skills to at least 75 from ~50 and made a ton of money especially from silverhawks and then went and unlocked priff. Was unbelievable
---
Repost oof
---
like 2 of these are decent, yikes
---
I never argued I could hack someone by just knowing their password. I argued in fact that having a secure password matters little in the grand scheme of things and isn't a major factor when breaching an account. So... nice work? You agreed with me? You're correct, me knowing your password would not give me access to your account... in fact I said the same in the above comment:
---
&gt;He's correct -- I cannot do anything in a vaccuum with only someone's  password. Information without application is null. But I argued anything  is able to be hacked, not that I can perform witchcraft. 
---
Here you state:
---
&gt;theres so many things hacker has to bypass and to even get the info to  bypass them that youd be better off making some real money hacking  online if you have that kind of skillset rather than hacking some  runescape accounts 
---
You're arguing it's difficult to hack an account -- which yes... it is. That's why skilled white hats are in high demand. It's a very complex and difficult to learn skillset. White hats being people who use ethical penetration testing to breach security measures of large companies to expose security breaches and allow companies to improve said security.
---
But either you underestimate the potential profit of hacking runescape accounts, or don't recognise the prevalence of skilled people in this industry. There are very talented people who hack runescape accounts -- there are very skilled people who hack... well just about anything. Simply put, because it's simple. Gathering information about **most** users is not a hard task. At all. In fact most people are willing to give away important information freely or at the very least have made said information quite easy to get.  
---
My argument was never "You can be hacked anywhere, at any time, by people who know nothing about you". That's a ludicrous argument. My argument is that someone with the know-how and motivation, if they so choose can bypass all Jagex implemented security measures with relative ease in comparison to other companies in a similar field and gain access (full access) to an account with less information than should be necessary.  
---
I never said you giving me your password would give me access to your account -- you made that insinuation. I instead said Jagex implemented account measures are quite weak, which they are.
---
* Passwords can be guessed or data mined
---
* Authenticators can be disabled without delay
---
* PINs can be disabled with a three day delay
---
* Security questions I don't even think still exist
---
* IP Address checks can be spoofed  
---
Which means every single Jagex implemented security measure can be easily bypassed by someone with nominal skill. Yes, it's relatively difficult to hack into a google account -- but I never argued that was easy. I said "Jagex implemented countermeasures were weak", not "google implemented countermeasures". Which, just for your reference, are also not impenetrable.  
---
Please take your time and read the response clearly. I believe you believe I am arguing something different to what I'm actually vocalizing.

It's okay we all start somewhere :)

This looks like a dps based infographic so it is right. DHCB isn't best dps, it's just best kills/hr from less banking

All you had to do was hop worlds, walk past the fence to where your items were dropped, hop back into the same world, and pick your items back up lol
---

---
Honestly the dps with standards is fixed with surge spells and tome of fire, and as mediocre as the hold spells(bind/snare/entagle) are, for being able to slam 40-50 damage with fire surge and being able to teleblock your target, the spell book is believe it or not pretty balanced at least in terms of what it use to be. The only obstacle that needs to be addressed is inventory capacity etc. I agree you should be at a disadvantage on standards and forced to have less supplies as the other benefits such as being able to teleblock greatly outweighs this. But even if using combination runes, tome of fire, and a staff that covers up to 2 different elemental runes, the standard spell book setup leaves you with 5-8 brews in most cases where someone on ancients with just a rune pouch has 10-13 brews. I think making wrath runes count as all combat spell runes besides bloods is a solid idea. Meaning all spells that use mind runes, chaos runes, and death runes should be able to use wrath runes in place of them. Shouldn't effect the prices of any of them except maybe a very slight increase to wrath runes. This would make teleblock just require law runes for someone who has fire surge and entangle on them.

To be fair, it could very well be that, but it could also be that the gf is a straight up asshole. Either way, OP's got a problem and should work on it.

i imagined you had the hiccups when reading the audio in my head
---
After reading your story it’s always best to just leave them alone. Anti scamming will rarely work since they typically know all the tricks. I let my irl friend borrow my gear and he fell for a disc of returning scam lol. He’s currently in debt to me because he thought he could outwit a scammer :P
---
Well I mean if you just keep saying that without a good argument I’m not sure how to respond to be honest...

Turn on your profanity filter and quit crying retard

Then you can use it to get to a bank 😊

You either play to win or you pay to win

so you support racism. cool.
---
At least you aren't dealing with an inadequacy :/
---
That seems like an awkward place to put raid parties, they don't really have anything to do with quests.
---
It doesn’t train strength because attack styles add an invisible +3 to the star in question therefore giving whip extra max hits making it a little overpowers and our balancing other weapons it’s not a logic thing or a lore thing it simply doesn’t due to game balancing 
---
Can you make it so that on mobile when you hop worlds the chat box doesn’t open again every time? It opens every single time you log and it takes up such a large of the screen. 
---
Very cool, Payless serene! 
---
I know what you mean but I still think the community as a whole should have a voice. This seems like a form of making voting harder so the fewer have a bigger voice. It’s just not how voting should be. Voting should be made easier hiding poll results should be a priority prior to voting yes. But not making it harder to vote. 
---
Those who don't vote don't voice.
---
ok now this comment is epic 😂😂😂
---
If they do anything to NMZ it should be reworking it to seem less private server-y. And in terms of minigames, I think more should be done to rework Castle Wars to make it more fun and worthwhile (aside from grinding halos and decorative armor) and maybe doing something to make the duel arena less sketchy.
---
I asked Mod Ash about this.  He said it was doable but it would take a good deal more work than you would expect.  Same for proccing rev weapons, and bolt specs.
---
Girlfriend? Bro I'm only on season 3 what the fuck..!

Someone tag Jagex Maz on here... please.

You seeing this Maz? You should get fired for this tweet bro. You lazy piece of .... JUST GET IT DONE STUPID

Yeah, i just did death to the dorgeshuun and the city is amazing, There's so much there, so much stuff to do.

You could probably even sell cabbage to the gourmets for a ton of money!

Greedy bastards. This shit disgusts me 
---
Runelites "GPU setting" is just osbuddys opengl, it's not true GPU support.
---
Did you take my visafe
---
It definitely extended our trips, but I think dps went down slightly. Also since our bgs specs were not hitting nearly as much. It get funny when barrage splashes since Bandos def is so high     
---
Now I’m curious how a mage/range switch would fare      
---
75 atk/def if edge/pvp world pking imo, but if youre just a deep wildy pker/revs or whatever just go maxed.
---
*most likely* I still double check with a jmod about this considering there could be complications like if you abandoned the account 
---
and he continued to play on it.
---
Or if he got a slayer task for the inferno and attempts it from his ISP.
---
I’m sure there are a lot more but yeah twitter /:
---
Yes?
---
He must think making it into the drama calendar is a scandal
---
I like 35 more than 27
---
Didnt know that! I thought the spawns were random each time
---
Don’t remeber the number but Jim is showing Pam Dwight’s SecondLife account. And then she sees that he has an account for watching Dwight’s account that he has spent some time on.
---
Team pking is sometimes necessary to get a kill. At the wildy alter, I can escape from pretty much any solo pker very close to 100% of the time. At revs, I've never gone down to a solo or duo, and rarely I've gone down to a trio.
---
It takes more than 1 person to get a kill sometimes. Pking with friends is fun. You're making up arbitrary rules for honor in a point and click adventure game, my brother.
---
Yeah but the point shouldn’t be to make voting more difficult.. that only hurts the community. I think it’s as simple as hiding poll results prior to voting. 
---
It really isn't maz's job it just was a joke with the title to bring discussion
---
Opening an interface interrupts every action, not just combat.

Can I do zulrah with 94 magic / 75 range? (79 HP / 52 pray) I know the magic is fine, but will i struggle to get through the ranged?

Respect for learning from it and owning up to it.

if it was a perm bonus that would buff a lot of content... PKing, bossing, blast furnace, and so much more.

if you're just dying to wrong prayer switches on jad, then just keep practicing dude. Eventually your nerves will fade and it will be a cake walk. You just gotta get used to it.

you still dont seem to understand.... here are 3 points why hacking my runescape account is impossible...

1. you dont know my username
---
2. you dont know email used on my runescape account
---
3. you cant bypass my authenticator
---
u can get the best mother fucking hackers on the planet and they themselves cant hack me unless they breach jagexs own data... so tell me exactly how can u hack anyone :D

Cannon is range slayer meta.

Did you not know?
---
But the whole point is he is trying to get the dude to trade him 100m, so the scammer is just stalling the tradescreen until his items appear. 
---
If he logs to a new world to get his shit, it’s the same as just never talking to the scammer in the first place

I recently purchased a new phone and the Authenticator app I have didn’t carry over the information from when I sent up the Authenticator on my account. I cannot figure out how to get a new Authenticator QR code to be produced for my account on the Jagex website, so essentially I’m locked out of playing mobile. Does anyone know of a way to fix this??
---
I mean after you vote the results show for exactly this reason. I don’t want the results to be announced after poll ends. 
---
There's only one way to actually teleport directly to Dorgesh-Kaan, and that takes a single use item. Every other method means going through through another city or dungeon first, so it's not usually worth it.
---
got my arma and sara kills yesterday, gonna try zammy and bandos today, super close to fremmy elites
---
yeah fuck same with cannonballs. there goes all my money..
---
Yup and that defies the point of him trying to “make” 100m off the scammer. If he was gunna do all that why not just ignore the fucking scammer in the first place? Like Gratz man you started back on square one with all your items lol... 
---
yes, but not the elite. that was added later on along with the other diaries.
---
Could have placed the name on a level 3 account that wont show up in the highscores, it’ll show up as inactive. 
---
The ‘best way’ to check if an account has the name (inactive or not) is to try and add it. It’ll either add them or show up as ‘unable to add friend - unknown player’
---
So what is swamplethics? 
---
I personally would be far more inclined to vote if it was browser-based. I can rarely be bothered to visit a poll booth in game however I always have a browser open whilst I'm playing where I could answer the questions whilst doing whatever I'm doing in-game.

Which is exactly how some streamers come to hate their job. It’s a blessing boaty really really REALLY loves rs enough to just accept thousands of hours of lost progress just to try again. A lot of our content creators are like this and I’m thankful for em.

If only, sounds like the dream. Parents take care of everything, no responsibilities besides keeping your EHP up as high as possible. Mmm man just hate the idea of running out of poop socks. 
---
Well you seem uneducated, so i'll educate you a little ok?
---
The profanity filter blocks most words. Most words aren't bad. Like you say fuck you call me a retard etc, that's cool.
---
But if you're dropping the hard R that should be blocked. Not because i'm offended, i'm white, i couldn't really give a fuck, but other people might, and streamers in particular get 'sniped' with blatant racists. Just ban it, not hard to understand u cretin.
---
So because they don't bother staying on lunars when they do slayer or switching their spellbook back and forth every task, players shouldn't get the shortcut? WTF kind of logic is that?
---
To gain 13 million xp in 3 months playing 24 hours a day would be on average 5936 xp per hour.
---
How is your first suggestion even remotely a good idea?
---
Runelite has these plugins.      
---
Obviously implementing it in native client would be great, however I believe it will be a waste of their time and resources with the mountain of other QoL that isn’t available on 3rd party softwares.     
---
This is the right answer but it fails in practice because jagex simply does not care. I'd much much rather mute people abusing their privileges than ban words but neither happens

Even in the Myth guild basement at all hours of the day there are Venezuelans and bots constantly world hopping. A couple days I got lucky and managed to get like 100 rune ore in an hour but I've also had days where every single world the rocks were depleted. I don't think it's worth doing these days sadly.
---
I like the idea but I dislike the design

he gets great dps though, personally i'd go with str bonus instead of def bonus but eh, to each his own, right? if you get a blue dragon task and don't have the points to skip, might as well go for dps

Hippity hoppity your mind is now my property. We can go get it changed at the title company later.

 Currently when using the deposit box, inventory icons disappear and you are forced to use the deposit box UI. While this itself is not a problem, closing the deposit box causes a delay for the inventory icons to reappear. This can be annoying when, say, emptying a coal bag. Is it possible to just leave the inventory icons visible, and perhaps allow clicking those icons to deposit in addition to the deposit box UI?

A mid level damage setup would be dragon defender, fighter torso from barb assault, obsidian platelegs, dragon boots, amulet of glory and neitiznot/slayer helm. Maybe a warrior ring (i).
---
Maximise strength bonus (max hit), which is separate from attack bonus (accuracy)
---
As an ironman you HAVE to buy bank boosters. You will need a crapton of spaces. Before Jagex started to sell them, bank spaces were handed out along with item-heavy updates for free. Extra action bars, auras and presets are EXTREMELY convenient. Only the RuneMetrics are the little extra, but all of the above should be free with membership, not MTX monetized. 
---
Yep, having no TH is awesome, but that doesnt mean MTX isnt being shoved down irons throat.
---
Yes, absolutely a viable strat (for monsters that don't require a slay helm). It's a little bit slower than just praying cuz guthan is pretty bad, but it does work. 
---
These sound like a slightly different version of auras from rs3. I like the idea, so long as the wards do not provide a new max efficiency ceiling. 
---
For example, the ward of rage makes afking more viable, but actively clicking would still be slightly more efficient. Something that increased your killing potential would not be ok in my book.
---
As for Skilling, a few buffing wards that increase yield and not exp rates would definitely be nice (maybe use this as an excuse to trim monster drop tables just a bit)
---
What needs to be stopped is the ignorance of players. Jagex does not do enough to warn newer players of these scams in my opinion. 
---
Barbarian Assault wave tickets. 
---
Resetting your wave gives a ticket that allows you to re-enter that (or a lower?) wave. Addresses the issue of people leaving rounds mid run without penalizing anyone. 
---
Rs3 also eventually made them tradable to great success (you had to have done a wave before, before you could use a wave ticket to get into that room)
---
The Chinese company is selling off jagex so I'd be more worried about who comes in next. 
---
This is a tough one, also really interesting...
---
I agree that Zuk would have highest K/D.
---
I think for the most kills it needs to balance kill potential with the frequency that people do it, so maybe something easy like KBD might be high on the list because so many people do it, but them maybe something like a GWD boss or DKs because they are sort of medium requirements, but also can still kill high level players.

And while we’re on the subject, can some of the farmers wander distance be looked at? Some of them walk really far in relation to where their tree patch is located. 
---
They already get a crapload of money from membership subscriptions and they don't pay for any Customer Service, so they have plenty of profit. This is just greed.
---
Holy fuck
---
They already have an option to disable the bank pin when hoping, it shouldn't affect this either. 
---
The real solution, 2FA your email, don't use the same password for everything, don't account share/rwt, and don't get phised. If your email is compromised, you have bigger problems than your RuneScape account.

Hello all! I have been playing a lot recently and I have been in F2P but I have a 14 day P2P because of the twitch prime deal. I'm only about 2 days into the membership so that leaves me with 12 remaining. I have been grinding Motherlode Mine since the start of it pretty much, preparing for my first bond, but I have no clue what to start with after I get my next bond prepared. I came back to the game because I never had a p2p when I was a kid, so I came back and have already made it further than my original account in terms of F2P, but now that I have a system to get bonds with this membership, I don't know what I should do next when I'm not grinding, I have very very limited p2p knowledge but decent F2P, so I need to make the most of the short time bonds give you. Any guidance would be helpful, and other P2P money making ways would be cool too. Thanks!
---
I thought of that too and I think it's possible, but most people will only die to Jad a few times. I know that I've died more to rune drags (being afk) than Jad.
---
I agree! There should be no reason to confirm for payment of watching the tree. Confirming to actually pay the 200GP, yes that should stay. 
---
I would like to see that “pay” option be the default left click option for farmers.

75 attack won’t work well with your end game PvM goals. Go ahead and keep 75 defense for a while though.

Can you guys improve the music listening experience to give us more of an incentive to listen to it?  Top of my list would be:
---
* Improve the music tab to allow favorites or a playlist and allow shuffle playback.
---
* Decrease the volume output.  Currently the lowest setting is the only one I ever use.
---
* Add a toggle to allow us to turn off the POH chime.
---
Thanks!

Yeah unfortunately Facebook doesn't give a shit about scams as long as they get paid for the ads. Cryptocurrency scam ads are really prevalent on FB as well.

I think part of it is jagex has kind of dug themselves into a hole, any new smithable or craftable armor would either kill certain bosses or be dead content. 
---
If they made something higher than barrows smithable, it would kill barrows and possibly gwd. If it didn't have str bonus it would be dead content like dragon or torag.
---
It heals my heart.

Agility was my first level 60 and stayed that way for a while. It was a great decision. I still haven't trained it because with full graceful I don't really think about running out of run energy anymore. On the few occasions I do, the Lumbridge easy diary rig gives me it right back.

Same reason they added a Troll Stronghold but not a Weiss? I'll let you know when I figure out what that reason is... But yah, both could be added but they didn't do both Basalt so I didn't see a big need to do both Spheres, especially since not much happens around Goblin Village.

Anyways, you say you are cool with muting people who cross the line from free speech to hate speech. Unfortunately, jagex does not do that. While they used to mute far too much, now you really can't get muted for anything. There has to be some give and take.
---
That makes a lot of sense, because Verzik Vitur came up in our discussion but we decided not enough people have tried it.
---
I really wonder if it'd be something trivial. I have honestly died more to rune drags than almost anything in the game, just from consistently afking them and losing track of stats.
---
Or maybe the ardy knight has smacked enough people to death...
---
I don't know how you managed to stay focused through the grind.
---
Nice.
---
Theres always been RWT in the game though. Buying XP is totally different, they still have to train with their bandos lol
---
How do you turn that on?
---
Yeah, im not that lucky lmao
---
I think I died the most at Cerberus, he has a decent kd I think. Maybe the wizards South of varrock, lots of noobs die there but nobody actively kills them

They could do it so the set bonus is greater than the sum of the individual bonuses, e.g. the full set is +7% while each of the 6 pieces is +1%
---
Wouldn’t you be able to heat the ends of each piece then fuse the molten sections together? I’m not a sword smith so it’s entirely likely that I’m wrong, but I don’t see why that wouldn’t work
---
Thanks my dude this is great 😊

Personally, I don’t.... any bonds used, even through in game gp were bought by someone who paid for it with irl money.  More demand, higher prices, more incentive to rwt through jagex.  I do prefer that over actual rwt but still.
---
It was sent by ''Jagex'' it had Jagex ''noreply@a.jagex.com'' address. it looked just like it was sent by jagex, but this pishing email however will let you always ''reset'' your password so they will get the login info. What was interesting was that it even knew my ingame display name.
---
There is nothing you can do. You could try to submit a ticket but they will more than likely just tell you that you should have had a bank pin and used the authenticator, which you really should have. It takes 30 seconds to set up both.
---
Yeah the thing with these scams is that the scammer actually wants you to think that you can anti-scam them. You'll play into their game thinking youre being smart when they want you to think that.

Where do u find this collection log thing? Pretty sure this is a newer feature

Nah, there is no pussy about this boss unless you can't kill it. 
---
Hit 121 yesterday. Never had this many qp in all my years of playing RS. The grind is real, but my combat bracelet is going to fuse to my skin if I dont get these gloves soon.
---
If your not using gold your doing it wrong
---
RSPeer is a fucking trash client, everyone should use Dreambot instead. I heard they have that sexy guy named Articorn working there or something?
---
What most people dont admit is that they leak their own information inadvertently. The being too ashamed or even unaware that they have start crying about lack of security on their accounts lol. Idiots using same passwords everywhere. Using real birth dates on ANY website. Actual names. Real cities. Even internet service provider from some dodgy internet speed test site coupled with a possible rat they downloaded from their best friend who is also unaware. It's so incredibly easy to social engineer the details you need just by googling. All you need to know is the account youre targetting and the owners digital footprint reveals most of the info you need to recover the account. It's true that jagex could implement an extra layer of security but none of that helps if people are stupid as i said.
---
I foresee a time where setting up Authenticator and a bank pin is mandatory. 
---
There's really not even a good excuse not to.
---
It requires you to meet the target hours before killing them
---
Okay I see a lot of people praising sang on kq. It sucks ass. I tried it in live and in tourney with Max gear, it's just horrible.
---
Hey I heard the mystery of the fishing net being solved on this sub, anyone have a link or answer?

&gt; asshats

how nice of you
---
&gt; the xp rates always go up as you level
---
the rate of xp rate increase doesn't hold a candle to the exponential rate of xp requirement increase. The "92 is halfway" is pretty much in the correct ballpark for most skills. In OP's case by counting bars needed from [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Free-to-play_Smithing_training#Efficient_training) I got that 92 is around ~54.8% of 99
---
Make the granite hammer function as a hammer at raids like DWH does. 
---
Yeah you’re completely right but I assumed this game had the most minimal amount of fucking security on it after almost 20 years as a company. This is fucking bullshit 
---
Can Thammaron's sceptre be updated to give it a built-in spell like trident? Right now, it's completely useless and is worse than trident + higher risk

This is just predatory tbh. It's nregulated gambling. Get people addicted and extort sickening amounts of people off flawed human brains without having to go through gambling regulation agencies. Sad
---
From what I understand, YouTube's new content id bot has been applying content id to other channels without linus knowing, they are not striking channels.

---
This isn't new. Your welcome for the down vote
---
Right but its impossible to play 24 hours a day without botting so that number per hour goes up significantly for normal people. Definitely still slow as hell but it's nowhere near what you're suggesting it is.
---
Yeah you actually fail the cast on the undead scorpion at Vorkath because you're greater than -67 mage accuracy. You have to bring some kind of mage switch in order to do it successfully.
---
Bandos not only doesn't have this problem, but its not even close to being lower than -67 accuracy.

I'd love the ability to check charges on items in my bank, as well as the ability to equip items from the bank interface

Q
---
I agree with the split part at least.

I bet you don't have a problem with the word 'cracker', do you?

How long did both agility and mining take?
---
It's a new type of chemistry that's going to be implemented into osrs. 
---
Can anyone explain Swamplethetics to me? What is it? 
---
What lol?
---
This is how drop trading works my dude.
---
Drop your items, log out, log into new account, sit and wait for items to appear.
---
The boat is a lot bigger though but whatever lol :p
---
Yes, thats how some ironman start zulrah
---
Here is my personal tip of advice if you have not learned Zulrah before:
---
Between every phase you need to know 3 things:
---
1) Where you should stand
---
2) What you should be praying
---
3) What gear you should equip (or not equip)
---
Part of learning Zulrah is looking at a visual guide and memorizing these 3 for each rotation. If you can answer these from memory for an entire rotation you will have no issues. It’s a big memory game in my opinion. Ofc you can have a guide up while doing the kill, but honestly, you’re going to want to have a lot memorized so you can just look at one screen.
---
Aight thanks

What kind of a toaster are you using?

Jokes aside, please provide more information. Pc specs, does it happen on other software etc.

PC specs? windows version? 
---
But come on, 450 keys and a guaranteed purple prize? That's worth a 10 hour day at work.
---
less brews, that's what sgs/blood barrage is for, unless you plan on 1 tick flicking everything, and you should replace the bandos/veracs with justiciar if you can, the idea is to max your range def to allow you to facetank a bit more
---
also don't bring cash stack
---
Btwbtwbtw
---
G
---
Yeah I don't touch zulrah without 6 karambwans in my inventory for example
---
Damn the ironman think they own the wilderness aswell smh...
---
“Could never figure out Barb Assault... Hmmm, oh this will do!”

Haha, sharks to 95, then anglers. I do wines when I want to speed through the exp. Trying to make a profit :)

It is one person and they are a nightmare to play with.

&gt; Is there a reason
---
HP limited builds are vastly overpowered. That's how to completely destroy pking and turn everybody into a rushing account.
---
lol no the rich prefer to be able to look out from their swimming pool balcony to see people living in squalor beneath them
---
B-but Pkers are the toxic ones!!1!1
---
"Noob"
---
Another thing you could have done in the situation was bring telegrab runes, drop them, trade to show it's all you have, pick them back up, and telegrab your items.
---

---
The mouse movements would be the same. The joystick moves the cursor in the same way the mouse does. It’s not like a touch screen device where your clicks jump from coordinate to coordinate with no cursor movement inbetween
---
So I'd bring ancestral bottoms instead of tassets but still bcp?
---
If Hitpoints is the problematic skill, than it could be the only skill not being able to be Locked/Unlocked.
---
Why be mad they are literally poisoning RS3 with MTX so that they can make money to leave OSRS untouched. Its a win win!
---
It takes longer to go switch my spellbook than it does to just walk to duradel
---
This basically sums up the whole experience.
---
Meanwhile my last cerb task I get 5x 50 ashes drops, 3 unholy symbols, and multiple 300 fire rune drops making me basically break even despite having spectral. Cerb has some trash drops for how high level you need to be to fight it
---
Sara since you don’t take any damage if you flick correctly.
---
That's what I'm saying. If you don't have a message in your message centre, it isn't from Jagex, and is obviously a scam.
---
Sure its not bots? Lol seen this group sitting in the GE constantly
---
Unexpected Vivec 
---
True but it is like more "smooth" but like mausa said earlier other factors are also counted.
---
You could do that but it would be a total ineffective weapon/it would break at the first strong impact. Of course this is a fantasy game so no realism is needed
---
It means "Jagex still doesn't hide active poll results."
---
This fence isnt like other doors though. Unlike a door that opens and stays open, this fence opens, you walk through, and it closes after you.
---
To keep the proper fence animation and not show some random person just walking through a fence from your point of view, it's made that only 1 person can go through at a time. 
---
Well, I disagree with wildy bosses being... in the wildy, but for the most part we actually do kind of agree on some points. 
---
&gt;Your bitching about being attacked in the wilderness tho which i do and don't understand
---
I am totally fine with being attacked in the wilderness. I am not fine with content being put in the wilderness exclusively for the purpose of trying to make the wilderness "active"/to cater to PKers. When it's something like revs that has a reason/benefit to be there, it's totally okay with me. 
---
However, since there is content I want to do that is located in the wild, I'm disinclined to vote in favor of updates that make killing me any easier. 
---
Id say no, I dont like green
---
I'd be for it then, as long as it doesn't apply to quest XP, but since it would only benefit pkers it would never pass a poll.
---
My reasoning for bringing bandos over justicar is that I get more mage accuracy with bandos, I think I saw somewhere that it calcs to like ~90% chance to hit with bandos and ~70% with full justicar
---
That would exclude 75% of this subreddit so I agree
---
I've never played rs but I still know dank when I see it
---
youre whats wrong with runescape if you give to these bigots
---
"pay real money to open this box and maybe get a randomized reward item". That's literally gambling, it's been made illegal in some European countries. EA has been in the headlines over this a lot. 
---
Am I the only one who wants my own Pam?

Put it upstairs

Dont say hes a god. He gave so many people shot for dying and this rich ginger cant even afford decent internet 
---
We pay we say
---
I agree with some but not others, wish this was typed out as individual comments
---
Short and sweet, they just don’t give a fuck. 
---
Shit bwana that's all you had to say
---
PMI but what am I looking at?
---
I dont think RS3 is bad, just the overload of MTX. It's basically a money farm for Jagex at this point which is an shame. RS3 has a lot to offer otherwise.
---
:)
---
Coin toss
---
Times is changing son
---
Six brews, one range pot on stam pot rest restores 
---
If you’re using Bandos for mage you may as well use justicar. I would suggest swapping out tassets for ancestral pants
---
Sgs for first attempt- imbued heart of 95 mage or below. 
---
Also switch range pot for bastion pot
---
Best P&amp;R scene ever. 
---
Old one is devoid of actual caring website owners and curation as well as is an ad hell, as in they'll let phishing links and other malware/etc post ads (and the ads can get incredibly intrusive as well).
---
Repoll Artisan
---
You think that everyone voting no had the same reason. Also the reason I want the game to be consistent everywhere so I don't have to listen to people bitch and moan when their shit is different in the wilderness
---
Don't tell Faux he'll get it nerfed
---
Right but my point remains. If there was a proper way to deal with this in-game bullshit then you wouldnt have these post. Downvote all you want but itll keep happening until Jagex fixes it. 
---
It's my opinion, and my opinion is always the correct choice
---
High Alch yourself
---
We have it so good in OSRS. 
---
Truly we do. 
---
Salvage replaces armor and weapon drops. So instead of getting a rune platebody drop you'll get a large rune salvage drop which alchs and disassembles the same way an old rune platebody did.
---
Can buy account tho.
---
Saw them/him at Seers the other day, wondered wtf was going on 
---
first try you should make is a reinstall of your gpu drivers. How much understanding and technical do you have about computers? download the lastest drivers from nvidia and after that DDU (if you know what you are doing. if not just uninstall everything from nvidia) your drivers. restart your pc and install the new one. 
---
Clip won’t load 
---
RS3 exclusiv wep ?
---
When you receive a Brimstone key drop from wyrms it does not currently appear on the same tile as the rest of the loot. Without the use of an overlay that highlights the items on the floor, the key drop can be very easy to miss especially on mobile. Recently I even noticed the untradeable loot drop notification in the chat on mobile but I couldn't find the key on the ground so I never picked it up. Can you all please make the key drop spawn on the top of the rest of the loot so that it can be easily seen against the wyrm bones?
---
Yeah, uhm no. Good on you for doing this, but it's entirely unnecessary. 
---
Having similar ideas does not mean she deserves a share in credit. Honestly "I had the idea first" is childish in itself. You're the one that had the idea and did the work to actually pop it. Show me where she put it on reddit, spec the 2007scape reddit, and maybe she has a case.
---
You have to already be logged in on the same world when the items drop for them to appear. 
---
Bank Presets!! Please allow us to save specific inventory setups for different tasks in game.  i.e. switching from vorkath setup to farming setup quickly 
---
I’ll never get to 10 because I don’t want to keep replanting the expensive patches like tree and fruit tree, I ain’t spending 150k on no dragonfruit seed
---
Are two black guys not allowed to type the n word to each other?
---
Take screenshot, scrub surroundings to make a cutout.
---
Is*
---
They did block a friend when he tried to max with only keys, because he spent like $50k in a short time frame. Still though that's a stupid amount of money.
---
Bursting/alching and then once you get 87 maby3ic, use magic imbue while doing things around RS.
---
Is it because I'm Mexican or because I told you to have more tact and it offended you? 
---
I tried to go through recovering it and there is nothing that shows for changing the email for the authenticator 
---
yeah, but come on, who hasn't tried to guth a task only to remember "oh yeah... i this would be better with a slayer helm..." shit happens to the best of us. And once you're there who really goes all the way back to the bank, only to return immediately.? i don't.
---
Those worlds do exist.
---
Theyre called free to play.
---
Yes, but you can update the contact email prior to removing auth
---
It looks like a bird, which is what Armadyl and his aviansies are. The male helmet looks far better than the female one, imo. The female one looks like she has a raw chicken nugget on her head.
---
See now if I played RS3 I would buy 900 keys!
---
Yeah I wish there was a pure black skybox colour, sorta like an endless void.
---
Get rogue outfit 
---
It looks pretty freaking bad imo.
---
Always has.
---
That’s this pricks shit dick
---
It's a credit card u dumb donkey
---
Pretty sure there have been sites with high alch lists with profit/loss for over 10 years already lmao
---
Stackable clue scrolls 
---
"Goes into coma when healers spawn" made me laugh lol
---
You using F keys? Should easily give you enough time.
---
Just an update on the storage boxes that have been suggested in the past.
---
When are we polling/putting them in?
---
E.g. 
---
- seed storage: farmers guild.
---
- fossil storage: museum.
---
Also, instead of having to deposit a set of clue reward items into your poh deposit boxes, can we deposit singular.
---
The items in the box become highlighted when in the box. So I think it should be highlighted in chunks for how many pieces are in the box:
---
E.g. 1/5 pieces are in the box = 1/5 of the box highlighted.
---
Ironman btw. 
---
unless there's something special about molten glass, like most tradable items it'll appear to everyone else after a minute and disappear after 3 minutes.
---
Are you using F-Keys?
---
And to make it easier you can use screen markers to know exactly where to put ur cursor 
---
It shouldn't take over like one second to switch lol
---
Defence potion or super defence potion
---
what
---
You can't call someone a 'complete douchebag' online without coming across as one yourself. Keep rambling if you want, I'm not going to spoonfeed you.
---
Instead of sara brew or bastion pot?
---
Any reason you don’t have it? You’re clearly loaded and it’s an obscenely fast skill.
---
My suggestion is that your character be logged out after 10 minutes of inactivity instead of 5. Or a lobby be added that keepsbyou logged in like rs3 has.
---
I too thought so at one point, but it's not the case. 
---
https://i.redd.it/fu1746kwutgx.png

https://i.redd.it/q8o4eh49k6e11.png
---
whip alchs for more than glory so no that wasnt the reason
---
This is golden 
---
Sara lowers range which not help jad especially if you rely on range pots. And never heard of bastion.
---
or you can just use alchmate, but this is neat. Gj
---
I REALLY like the Account Info tab
---
Imagine being an adult and posting this.
---
This could really help. I have never thought about screen markers! 
---
I'll leave a comment for when you come back tomorrow. if they don't drain the blood, it turns to jelly and they need to scoop it out.
---
runelite - (GPU) and you can adjust the Fog Depth / draw distance
---
That looks like the old wiki you're using, use the official one here https://oldschool.runescape.wiki (osrs.wiki for short)
---
The old one recently has had phishing and malware links, don't use it anymore
---
Runelite is number 0. Arrays don't start at 1!
---
NGL he has nearly higher total than my L122....
---
If you aren’t memeing, it’s the name of the Youtuber Settled’s ultimate Ironman that he has restricted to only Mort. Each video has been getting 300k+ views and many myself included think it’s the best Rs series on YouTube right now. 
---
Clue item boxes - those things you put emote items in.
---
Can you change the colour of them when the items are stored in them. Maybe even add an image to the map telling us, yes you've built the storage, and yes the items are stored inside.
---
There's been multiple times when I get an emote clue. Check my bank. Hunt down the gear, ironman btw. Go to the destination, and find out I've already built and stored the items from a previous clue.
---
Yes that is what the post is suggesting. I was just suggesting a more likely alternative
---
Do you know how often he attacks?
---
The massive chat button quite literally resulted in a death the other day.
---
I was doing Hespori, it was almost dead, so I was sitting at about 35 health and poisoned. It rooted me, in the process of frantically clicking to escape I opened the keyboard. Escaped the roots, keyboard still open, 15 health. Frantically trying to close the keyboard (swipe up, hit back on Android), finally succeed and hit a shark -- too late. Already dead.
---
Exactly what I was going to say. 
---
Hard to learn? And is the punishment for dying hihh? Gp wise and such?
---
I think you missed the point. If they don't know about the Wilderness, why do you think they'd know about the miniquest? 
---
How can you be sure people would do the miniquest to be informed about the Wilderness and scams? Furthermore, how can you be sure anyone would actually read any of the quest text instead of just skipping through it all?
---
Tbh if you look at my acc and my weird stats youd think i bought all the gold yet i just flip a lil bit during not playing much and make money pretty easly
---
Saw a dude bursting sandcrabs in full ahrims/wand today with similar stats
---
You have to stay on your toes in the wilderness.
---
It is by far the most unpredictable and fun place the game has to offer. 
---
It's with runelite, a third party client if you don't know what it is. It let's you change some stuff about the game, including the interface.
---
I am about to start my 5th run through.  Ill get that cape soon enough
---
I started at 50 farming a week ago and I’m up to 68. By far one of my favorite skills rn. Breaks up tedious nature of slayer and other things by traveling around game. Although I have definitely sunk more money into farming than gained because of sapling prices. Farming guild is an amazing update.
---
wtf
---
thanks! runelite just gets better and better
---
Brew &gt; super restore &gt; range pot. Or just bastion potion. You ever done caves?
---
what am I like the only person that thinks plague doctor masks are the shit?
---
This fucking jump. First time I saw it I couldnt stop laughing. The dude polevaults in a reverse arc. Glorious.

Just looked it up.  It's a range and super def combined.
---
It's probably the worst part of Runescape, in my opinion.
---
I don't mind that people want to do PvP. I just don't want to have to deal with PvP for things that have nothing to do with PvP.
---
thank you :) I use runelite but I was unaware of this feature.
---
Nope unfortunately it isn't yet. They said sounds good to that question on stream, and then did nothing yet. 
---
do you have a shit PIN? or use it in other places regularly? There is no way to figure out your PIN info unless you just throw it around willy nilly. Then you're asking for it.
---
Once saw a guy in full bandos with Pegasus boots   And a sgs begging for someone at the ge to give him some dragon boots. Guy goes up and gives him dragon boots.
---
Guy was wearing over 100m begging for dragon boots and got them.
---
I asked the guy who gave them to him why and he told me “the rich get richer -shrugs-“

Keep going I went over 1k before I got my first prim.
---
Improve the boat system on Fossil Island. Currently you need to board to the north then board again to get out to sea. The quick travel options from the Digsite are confusing as well.
---
Hmm same thing happened to me, sad thing is jagex banned me thinking I was real world trading. Hope the same doesn't come to you.
---
I wasn't poking fun at him playing mobile a lot, that was in response to the comment about vindictive girlfriends. If you have a girlfriend who is willing to destroy ANYTHING of yours out of spite, you need to find one who isn't insane.

rogue outfit isn't 20% per piece, it's 15% per and +25% set bonus.

---
doesn't seem like a big deal but 160% loot vs 200% loot is a 20% reduction in loot if you want to use a regen bracelet for extra sustain with rapid heal.
---
Used to be the case back in RS2 that you could do something similar with any book and the easter egg ring. My friends and I would zoom along the top of the wall overlooking Castle Wars as eggs.

&gt; @a\_i\_d\_a\_n\_L It goes 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 100% as you equip five pieces.
---
Wut
---
Tbf most people who kill bosses are only doing it to see their bank go up anyways lol
---
I don’t get why anyone plays this game besides to PK or on some kind of Ironman.
---
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BE REMOVED FURTHER FROM REALITY
---
omg. he's really in pain
---
LOOOL
---
FBI would like to know your location.
---
* Allow players with 99 slayer get slayer assignments from all slayer masters without combat requirement. (Example: player who has 99 slayer but under 100 combat to be allowed to get slayer tasks from Duradel)
---
Awesome, 99 defence has been my first 99 on my account back in the day and my current main
---
Probably posted a bit too late, but add a right click on the jewelry box in the POH to teleport to your last used location (or have a right click location set like the mounted Xerics and Digsite pendants)
---
Change a few right click options to left click (mostly for mobile)
---
\- Tool Leprechauns to exchange 
---
\- Birdhouses to empty
---
\- Fairy ring to configure
---
\- Guildmaster Jane to contract
---
I know I'm late but how can you consider missing a 95% chance not unlucky?
---
He didn't do any clues
---
Oh ok. And is there a need for the ancient gorilla greegree other than just for fun?
---
Good :)
---
Anyone who says graceful sucks at barrows.
---
If you do barrows efficiently, you never run out of run. 
---
Salvage can be disassembled and alched but can't be equipped. 
---
The upgraded armour requires more materials but gives more xp. The highest tier is also used to make burial armour which gives the best xp but removes the resources, so people can profit off smithing by making upgraded armour and selling it to people who want best xp. 
---
They always sell under value so their value is constantly going down currently. 
---
Thank God
---
About a week ago I finished all the f2p quests and decided to get a membership. Since then I have been doing agility for the graceful outfit and I have done some of the member quests like waterfall quest and gnome tree village. I am really interested in doing slayer but honestly I have no idea where to start. Any advice would be appreciated regarding slayer (and outside of slayer as well)!
---
Actually the probability of exactly 5 keys is ~1.16%, but I would argue the more interesting and relevant probability is *at least* 5 (so &gt; 5), which is indeed 1.49%.
---
Oh yeah ironman is the only way to play the game, if your not doing that your just wasting your time.
---
Because there's no such thing as personal goals or progressing in this game if your not on ironman mode.
---
Daily downvote
---
Hi am starving pls gib gold or I report
---
The biggest issue is tank armour matters in osrs so adding t80 and 90 armour would be a big balance problem. Also no masterwork. 
---
&gt; meet the target hours before killing them
---
lol no it doesn't. wtf are you on about. 
---
It’s super effective!
---
Nope, just fun.
---
Any advice for ironman who want firecape? Atm 80+ range, 264 qp, void, rcb, ..., i can just about reach jad...
---
This is the community so far
---
Let us use blamish oil on the Pearl fishing rod for use with infernal eels
---
It's funny that this has always been called cycling in clan pking but a streamer does it once on a boss and it has a new term. 
---
Specifically talking about this kind of skull tricking, well maybe not hours but 30 minutes to 1 hour
---
The majority of the player base is retarded and doesn't bother understanding more than what they're told.
---
They think because dhcb is BIS for kills/hr that must mean it's best dps too.
---
Wilderness roaming revenants were TERRIFYING.  As soon as you heard the teleblock noise you knew you were about to be slaughtered and you couldn’t escape. You heard them before you saw them too. 
---
All they do is hop worlds and check kbd.  I had one try to do it to me recently. He was hopping, came in, saw I was going in and out to move loot to my looting bag, and had his clan try to kill me.  
---
Have you tried doing the elite clue: "Dig under Razorlor's toad batta".
---
This scroll is harder than inferno.
---
Can you:
---
- A: make tarns lair less cancerous.
---
- B: move the location to Tarns Lair (slayer ring teleport).
---
- C: delete this clue.
---
It should be illegal to use this version of the interface
---
How much did you pay for that name? 
---
First do the varrock museum quiz mini to get an instant lvl 9 slayer. Then from there just find your highest available slayer master and talk to them. They'll give you a task (ex. 45 chickens) and then go kill the target. Rinse and repeat. Its a simple but ultimately very rewarding skill.
---
I would vote yes for this. I didn't even know the talisman was a recolored manspeak one. o.o;
---
This is what i was looking for
---
I think it was about 56m, based on the only record i could find from an old discord chat. I had a notepad document with my working, but i think i deleted it at some between during my 1.5 year hiatus.
---
More bank space
---
I already changed it back, don't worry :p
---
Ftp only account. Only died once bc I rushed a pker haha
---
[stats](https://i.imgur.com/dGTMfDH.png)
---
Tbh he should just move to jagex hq and play plugged into the main server
---
well thats what archers have wore through history and its helmet if it is hard and protect head.
---
Yeah cant you get like 99 fetching in an hour or something if you have enough money to buy dart materials?
---
Slash or crush apparently
---
I agree. The wild is so much fun even for a VERY casual pker. I'll make 1-2mil Skilling/pvming then jump into deep wildy with me and the rest of my lvl 93 non pking account friends. We always die and get absolutely stomped, but it's always fun trying
---
It’s literally just a promo that they have constantly, nothing special about this.
---
shut your whore mouth. settled is not annoying for one 
---
dude named "the collector" in ground floor of varrock museum
---
he's legit, he plays solo.using his 5 accounts lol
---
If you can afford I'd suggest replacing the guthans and dds with an sgs, but otherwise pretty good setup. Arclight is slightly better than whip for melee, but if you don't want to spend ancient shards then whip is fine.
---
Yeah I noticed this as well lol. Gotta love Gielinor.
---
No I guess I'm just saying the content requirments within one skill is outdated so by the time you have a 99 in that skill, you dont need/want any of the things you can get from having a 99 in that skill. 
---
I did 30-99 doing mlm and only got enough class for like 87 smithing
---
That's a fury mate
---
Don't plant regular trees. Stick to fruit trees and herbs/allotments while keeping your hardwoods (Fossil Island) and eventually Redwood planted.
---
This was so on point I laughed until I started crying. Then I vomited, projectile. You owe me a new laptop, funny guy.
---
Not even, that’s a fresh cut fury amulet 
---
female armadyl helm looks like something that archer could actually wear. Male helm is more stylish but it doesnt really look like archer helmet.
---
Sadly I was killing them in the cave
---
thanks a bunch
---
/r/confusing_perspective 
---
0 keys in the bank feelsbadman
---
You need quite high hunter level for those
---
What's wrong with having fewer people vote if those few people know better about what's good for the game?
---
Whatever one makes you happy
---
Are you killing them in the wilderness godwars dungeon?
---
Even with all that gold ore?
---
Wheres my boi Furion at
---
Yes
---
404
---
looks like hes trying to get stats for DS2 so probably rune dragon alt
---
except you're always running so you don't regain run energy.
---
I'm not sure exactly as i started 1.5 years ago and got bored because I was using dagannoth heads, which are slow and cheap, and only picked up again with the twitch prime membership 13 days ago, at about 146k exp/h. Maybe if I started back when the chaos altar was a thing i'd have used that instead but i'm a big pussy so i probably wouldn't have wanted the stress
---
\-More CC options (like "rules" or "news")  
---
\-New Friends options / Private "favorites"  
---
Maybe is skill but make an option for ask your slayer master where is your task (for new players)
---
This is so damn good
---
FrogChamp
---
thats a lot of words, i'm just being facetious
---
Nothing to do with slayer so it won't get updates.
---
Dude I also just got two dragon harpoons in about 5 minutes on task. Just came on here to see if the drop rates been changed. I know being on task improves the rates but this seems insane?!
---
i get that. i had 2200 total in 2012 b4 devolution of combat hit, but it takes time to get there, and alching is nice to do while skilling. (such as agility courses).
---
it's not just that i alch for an hour a day and all that, but everything i do is "this makes gold" and that's all it seems it devolves down to... the only things to do are make gold, and if you're spending gold doing something it feelsbadman.
---
Why do people just copy videos or memes verbatim and get hundreds of upvotes? Is everyone that unimaginative? 
---
I used to spend a lot of time in the wilderness back in 2016, and it really kept you on your toes.
---
I did 1.5k slayer points through wilderness slayer before the hydra released, the only time someone attacked me was in the rev cave while I was on a revenant task. Nothing of the same feeling it used to give me. By the end of the slayer point grind I started afking, that's how laughably dead the wilderness is.
---
The wilderness isn't in great shape right now. Revs is active, but it seems to be the only place.
---
i gave full addy to  random guy I knew was rich begging bc i thought he was doing a bit. turns out he totally thought he scammed me and logged out laughing like ok dude ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Yea it's pretty silly to think a nearly 1400 total level couldn't have earned ~25m.
---
This seems like a good argument for moving the polls to the official website rather than in game
---
I had a windows notification for discord pop up on my screen when I was doing dragon slayer, right where my inv was so I couldn’t heal and I died
---
Did it again and smashed it, nothing better than finishing all the ftp quests 
---
no no no. outta here with that logic!
---
What's the info? I'd be down. 
---
Because it’s funny. 
---
i know you didn't get it, but fuck wintertodt at max hp, feels aids using multiple brews compared to my level 10 using 1-2 cakes.
---
Enjoy the bond. 10/10 fanfic fam.
---
Begging should be a bannable offense. I always report them for solicitation anyway.
---
Your talking about saving like one minute tops, reading this you prolly used all the time you saved by picking the better one
---
IRONMEN RISE UP!
---
it is in ftp lol
---
I always upvote Phil of the Future
---
Orange man bad
---
I very well could have been.. not sure haha
---
i dont pay attention to what world i log into honestly haha
---
A coif does make sense as a piece of ranged armor. But it’s an armadyl *helmet* not an armadyl coif.
---
Froggers
---
But that's my point, it's beyond unfunny by now. It's just fucking lame. What's even remotely funny about it?
---
I was surprised how challenging the fight was. I know I'm a noob, but I thought I wasnt gonna have enough food and barely got him first try!
---
I hate arugula 🤮
---
only uses a single core so if you have a multi core CPU it doesnt always run great
---
you should ditch the supreme hat and earrings and youd look a lot more mature ..
---
Runelite has a plugin that lets the game run on your GPU
---
Have the "30 day" authenticator actually last 30 days
---
You could copy all the comments in this thread , then replace every other post's comments on this Reddit with them, and literally not a single person would notice.

Nice man
