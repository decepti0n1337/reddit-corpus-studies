I did fight caves on the beta world to mess around with tbow, and got baby jad on 1 kc ;(

---
Yes they are
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is... I can do heroine to help me get thru short term projects but should stay away from it if it involves anything long term?
---
You ever sell them for uhhh.. favors...?

TBH I still don't really get it. Killing 150 Dagganoth is no different from killing 150 trolls/ankou/hellhounds/etc. The monster has a different name, but it's the same thing. At that point, you can just say switch up zmi with zeah, combo runes, or abyss rc for just as much variety, while making more money and getting better xp/h, and also actually doing what you want instead of having to report to a slayer master and move locations every 15 minutes, interrupting your training.
---

---
The only variety in slayer is boss slayer, but at that point you're getting minimal XP/h so you might as well just go and kill the bosses you want to kill off-task...
---
It‚Äôs full of minerals.
---
F2P accounts
---
No, its a fox.
---
Because if they tried to make it any faster everyone would complain easyscape and vote no to (pvp) updates
---
Changing death mechanics is something that would be terrible for the game, and especially for Ironmen.
---
With the stats I figured he'd bond one to play, it isn't a f2p pure
---
And revenue would increase far more than that. I doubt it would be as high as 25%. They won't start with buying advantages.
---
It's 2019 can you swear like a normal human being?
---
I don't know why architects do this kind of stuff sometimes.
---
I've gotten double Wrath drops twice while under 100kc reeeeeeeeeee
---
Killing bosses off task is like 25% lower dps though. It's really all subjective anyway so it doesn't matter.  I hate rc because I constantly have to bank, I'm chugging my limited staminas, and it's bad xp/hr. I don't mind slayer, even regular melee slayer, because at the same time I am getting drops (some of which can be valuable/useful) and a lot of cb xp.
---
It‚Äôs 2019 being gay is acceptable... it‚Äôs okay buddy
---
Haven‚Äôt you spent enough time with the rocks?
---
Bank your items.
---
Iv gambled 40+ and no pet all task
---
I mean.. it isn't.
---
Back in my days, I was making flax runs in Camelot making 300k an hour. Obby capes were 250k, whips were 4.5M, all that flax running paid off. Now it‚Äôs a joke.
---
Yes it is...
---
How about this, instead we buy jagex from china and when we are all shareholders, we get that fairy ring.
---
No I‚Äôm not. Praying mage ONLY PROTECTS FROM THE REGULAR DRAGONFIRE FROM KBD. Since you aren‚Äôt aware, kbd has 4 different types of fire; ice, poison, shock and regular. Antifire potions and praying magic can protect you full from the regular, but not the other 3. Praying mage does nothing, even with super anti fires. Antifire shield helps reduced the damage from shock, ice and poison, but not fully. That‚Äôs why you still get hit 15‚Äôs when it uses those breathes.
---
But please, don‚Äôt take my word for it though, please go and test it out! There‚Äôs a big big reason why people don‚Äôt blowpipe kbd. Go and try it with praying mage, I‚Äôm just trying to save people‚Äôs time.
---
Zaros gang rise up
---
Are there any vpns or rerouting services that work for OSRS to optimise ping? I know of stuff like exist but i think it only supports rs3
---
Lol get fucked OP
---
It's not though. Slayer easily exceeds 70k/hr on many of the good tasks, with some going much higher. And to maintain 70k/hr on RC long term is painful.
---
Didnt ask
---
You‚Äôll soon learn to blank out EVERYTHING in sight üòã
---
imo 2008 models looked more hd than the overpolished eoc models
---
As some have figured out yea it's from a discord bot and not real items
---
Yes on some tasks. Overall unless you had unlimited points, slayer averages out to around 50k an hour.
---
Google the name and click the link to join the discord server.
---
&gt;No file by this name exists.

oh nevermind the parenthesis just fuck up reddits link, my god that's hideous
---
I find the lag in the dungeon to be so annoying
---
I don't know, I'm not going to type anything with spoilers but it was just a super casual progression story that only served to provide closure on Jesse.
---
I didn't like it and was super let down. It wasn't a waste of time because it was more of the Breaking Bad universe but it could have easily been fit into the last season of Breaking Bad.
---
Do recall that an object's or concept's worth is measured not by its contents nor assembly but by how it is used and enjoyed by its users.
---
Nope cuz I only started playing again a month and a half ago and two weeks in I bought the bonds and people were selling for 3.5M
---
Lmao I used to sell feathers for 20gp each. I remember killing those chickens for a few hours and end up with like 2k feathers. Bank
---
You range with a bcp?
---
Lmaoooo so chill
---
*Corrupted Gauntlet. You right though. But considering everything except uniques in the Gauntlet‚Äôs loot table has the same drop rate, I wouldn‚Äôt consider it very common.
---
90k/hr is achievable solo and with a block list and bursting. It's not an advanced tactic or anything.
---
I openly said the difference is slayer you need to be 93+ and aiming for efficiency. Runecrafting you need 75+ to get the max rate solo lavas. 
---
Runecrafting as a casual is never going to exceed 35-40k/hr because casuals don't do lavas. They do zmi and then zeah. So saying "casual slayers get 1/3 the rate they could but casual runecrafters do the no profit no afk high attention method above 40k/hr" isn't really saying anything.
---
Yes if you try to be efficient in one skill and absolutely ignore any efficiencies in the other you will be faster in one. That's a given.
---
Orion is the old name for OSBuddy, it also had the Orion name when it was a bot client.
---
Ranging potion: CuSO4 in aqueous solution
---
Battles were easy, in my opinion. Honestly the hardest part of the whole ordeal for me was finishing Desert Treasure.
---
How do you set up stack pickup? Or are you referring to rapid clicking on an area?
---
Runecrafting isn‚Äôt slow players just chose to make it that way. You can get 60K/hr pre 75 without runners doing lavas, and 75K/hr from 75-99. Slayer on the other hand is 90K/hr POST 93 and objectively as intense and requires an alt. Majority of players could probably maintain closer RC EHP rates than slayer rates. Agility pre Ardy/Prif ignoring werewolf is like 55K/hr? 
---
Moral of the story is if you don‚Äôt like a skill being slow stop making it that way. There‚Äôs options to speed it up you‚Äôre just choosing not to. In which case the game shouldn‚Äôt change because you‚Äôre unwilling to invest into the content thousands of players have.
---
Are atk/def levels even worth grinding for post 90? 
---
Currently sitting at 99 str, 95 atk, 90 def. I've done some dps calculations on a few bosses / slayer monsters, and it seems that the difference between 95 attack and 99 attack is generally a &lt;1% increase in accuracy.
---
I'm not sure how I'd calculate enemy DPS based on my defence, but I'd expect a similar result, as I think enemies roll a similar damage / accuracy formula.
---
They brought OSRS because of the mass exodus of RS3. They won't mess with it because they know OSRS won't survive.
---
Yeah but it has the same limits on mobile as PC (exception being if you use runelite).
---
Lmao you are way too invested, previous to super antifires praying mage did reduce all incoming damage and that was what I am referencing
---
Geez relax lmao, tone down on the fearmongering. They literally just announced twisted leagues, which they intend to be their source of new memberships and publicity.
---
I don't foresee "partnerships" coming back for the next two years or so, unless leagues flops big time.
---
Pretty much this lol. I never liked dmm though, hated the thought of my progress just being reset every season and getting nothing out of it. That and clans basically owning it.
---
Thanks, didn‚Äôt realize/know that.
---
Haha okay gotcha. Yeah I haven‚Äôt done that one yet lol
---
Hello, resident noob here.

Is tbow more effective on revs than craw's bow?
---
The company needs to make money, if its just "early access" to some skins and recolors which will make the company grow, who cares?
---
My wife doesn‚Äôt even know what ‚ÄúRuneScape‚Äù is lol
---
100k when i used 150k in supplies, ye nice logic l0l fuckin stonks my man
---
Steal your moms credit card and just buy membership.
---
Do MM2 now man! You got this!
---
Personally I'd like all the tabs to the right, or at least open all the menus to the right, makes alching on mobile a pain having inventory and magic book on opposite side
---
They're basically bound to the worth of gold
---
60att/70def is definitely a great build for pking. If you're looking to solo boss its a bit limiting gearwise imo, and you lack a lot of accuracy. I'd recommend 75/75, you get access to basically all the gear you'll ever need
---
Bonds are based on how much gold is worth because it's basically tying real world money/membership to gp
---
So basically they're so much because gp is so inflated
---
Pretty sure I saw you on roidie stream lol, big grats though
---
He didn't ask anything.
---
Basically some one buys bonds for in-game gp
---
The less gp is worth the more you'll get for a bond
---
You joke but low-key you're right. If you can smoke meth without getting addicted (hisk risk gambling) you can get a FUCK TON of stuff done in a day while high on meth.
---
Heard a story from a friend of his friend that used to smoke meth when he got out of college, would only use it about once a month, knock out a shit ton of chores then be totally fine until he needed to do chores again.
---
It'll still rot out your teath and fuck you up though.
---
Combat will not make you much money at those stats. You could look into things like blast furnace smithing and such and other skills to build your overall total up more while making profit.
---
This threads for questions. If you wanna learn ToB with a better environment and welcoming team, check out WeDoRaids discord.

Depending on how progressed you are i always find im most motivated when i have goals. I kind of went on a progression like this: base 50s, graceful, barrows gloves, gearing up for efficient barrows runs, qpc progress, gearing up for vorkath, all untradeables, base 70s, qpc, and now im in the latter half of prepping for raids.
---
Why? It's the combination of body parts of sire to form a large 2 handed bludgeon. The whip is the spine of regular abyssal Demons.
---
He gambles with more money than most people will ever see in rs, I think people find it entertaining watching him win or lose big. When he streams fortnite he gets 1/5th of the viewers.
---
Gzz!
---
Because people are entertained by Sparc? Not everything has to cater to your tastes to be well liked.
---
Average drop weighted is a bit less than 10k, not terrible, not good either. For f2p, considering the skill requirements, its decent.
---
Was a great movie
---
&gt;implying jagex cant do whatever the fuck they want in disregard of your beloved muh poll system
---
There's a long list of new horrendous items
---
I just learned when to write a/an a month ago, it changes everything
---
The lack of the grand exchange is why I quit OSRS at release. The novelty of trading lasted for a whole month before I just went back to RS3 (and then back to this when I started my iron last year).
---
He rolled the correct random number while killing the zammy gwd boss.
---
slayer helm recolor
---
do you own a cat
---
True, but I‚Äôm mobile only and I only get informed if the drop is 10k or more, but you can tell he‚Äôs not mobile cause of his text box
---

---
Cool lore, shit design. It looks awful and ridiculously oversized. People complaining about how things are not looking old school lately but this is in the game as one of the BIS items? I mean I don't get it.
---
Oh shit!! Okay okay okay hang on...
---
Some of us are to busy holding titties in one hand and all our CA$H MONEY in the other hand to be blitzing in MM2 caves! But I wouldn't expect your 34 year old, never seen real life naked tits before, hyper efficient ass to understand that! 
---
Bitch!
---
How was that? I've never done this before!
---
Morty expansion but we still don‚Äôt know why there is a single teak tree in the desert???
---
Nice K/D ratio
---
I like it! I think it fits in fine, and isn't horribly over-sized imo, but yeah could be a lil smaller I guess.
---
walt's story is finished. the movie was about jesse not walt
---
Obviously so, but it‚Äôs a very specific reference and I knew it‚Äôs based on that. It‚Äôs like if I see a spade or chisel and be like ‚Äúdamn they made *X* into a real thing‚Äù it‚Äôs obviously ironic
---
Chicken in the car

Why tho lol
---
Gz dude
---
Make gmaul hit the side smash (multi hit like cloud‚Äôs) and change side b to ice barrage, then down b should be like hero‚Äôs menu but with all 27 skills. 
---
Each skill has a unique option. Agility = zoom, Attack = would be like psych up, Strength like Oomph, Construction does something like Villagers tree but w a house or makes a dresser or something. Cooking = Frying Pan like G&amp;W. Crafting idk. Defence, boosts defense. Farming = Villagers Tree, Firemaking = makes a fire hazard, Fishing idk, Fletching, makes a bow and arrows that replace b options: up b becomes grapple and side b bow and arrow, down b = snare. Hitpoints = heal, Hunter = set a trap hazard, Magic boosts magic, Mining = pickaxe, Prayer = smite/protect from prayers, Ranged, gives you throwing knives + javelins, Runecrafting = power up like the emote, Slayer = summon a slayer master, Smithing = metal, or drop an anvil, Thieving = Blackjack knock the opponent out. Woodcutting = axe hit. 
---
Final Smash = Evolution of Combat. Character Sprite turns into hyper realistic rs3 version and you dual wield whatever t99
---
Even I can see how shit these are, and I rarely pk
---
One of the top streamers for the past 5+ years chucking bils? what are you so confused about?
---
Assuming you have members, if you want to do more firemaking, you could grind wintertodt. If you want to do combat, you can grind sandcrabs for combat levels.
---
If you want to do questing, recipe for disaster is a good long term goal.
---
If you are f2p, I would complete all f2p quests, and kill some hill giants for mine iron while considering going members or not.
---
Not as horrendous as your skirt. Put some bloody pants on woman
---
Absolutely love this idea! Replace his shop with a Dorgeshuun axe shop. Maybe a new bone axe. It should also have Nardok's Bone Weapon's store up there!
---
I'm doing money snek
---
Without a doubt. You can't go back. You cant, not have it now that we've experienced it. But, if they never even had the idea, if they never even created it... The game would be so much different. I mean damn, most banks are empty now, they used to be packed. Everyone would have their favorite bank to bankstand or sell shit at, now it all happens at one place. No longer do you need to go to seers village to buy bowstrings or flax, now seers bank is pretty dead except for the people running the agility course
---
Sara brew is supposed to be foul liquid!
---
You can get over 90k/hr just running for yourself with a single alt. But yea, it's extremely sweaty
---
Apparently they reroute you through the best possible locations to optimise ping or something when playing from outside the region
---
North of Castle Wars , free anti-poisons are there.
---
Is it really
---
Nothing looks worse than the god damn Sarachnis Cudgel
---
How did that actually manage to get through quality control?

This has me thinking.
---
Would it be cool to have a mini jad (possibly larger than the pet) / any molten monster if mini jad is controversial  
---
As a random and like call you out for be ‚Äúneeding practice to ever take jad on‚Äù
---
Sends you to a interesting random where you shoot targets with some sorta twist.
---
Get range exp. (basically a bob random but for range exp)
---
And Jagex often do.
---
Maybe 35 or so wilderness there is a stack of big bones that spwans.
---
Rouges castle, gold ore and stuff. Totally not in deep wilderness with a great potential to die and lose your hcim status üòÅüòÅ
---
I'm the same way. I can decently do a hybrid either range/ mage or mage/ melee but I cant do the bridding like everyone else can do. I am trying and I have gotten a little better at switching. But itll still take a while. I only got maybe 2 kills. And most of my average placement is 18 lmao. But I get lucky and get 12th. But time will tell as I'm tryna get that halo
---
There is another...

*live ops team is getting ready to shut down post*

Nice video bro. Solid content most people dont have stuff like that shown. Try and keep the "uhh's" to a minimum lol. All and all solid vid mate.
---
Oh I‚Äôve seen some max stacks with more rares on top of that, but 52m is a lot to me personally.
---
They confirmed in a Q&amp;A that they starting working on one at the same time as Morytania, but that it wasn‚Äôt far enough along for any kind of formal announcement.
---
OP is playing 4D chess, this isn‚Äôt his neighborhood hes using the image to give hackers false info
---
Thats a goddamn impressive HCIM....
---
or mounts in general
---
Why?
---
Very nice and super extremely lucky lol
---
Me sorry.  You right!
---
I used to mine regular essence at varrock east and sell them off ONE INVENTORY AT A TIME UNNOTED FOR 30GP EACH.
---
Then my big boi brain came up with the idea of mining coal and iron ores at falador mine, smelt them at falador furnace, smtih them into kiteshields at doric's anvil, THEN SELL THEM ALL OFF TO THE FALADOR SHIELD SHOP. All this for like 10k per hour.
---
Oh I see. I think most of the people you see ever it through tons and tons of raids/pvm. Usually they have thousands of tob/cox and gwd kc. If you‚Äôre talking ironman specifically, zeah rc to 99rc makes a few dozen mil. Alching rune drops from slayer and pvm also helps.
---
The price for Bond-equivalent items in every game always raises over time. See PLEX in Eve:Online, Tokens in WoW, Bonds in RS, etc.

Maybe his name is a reference to the streamer BrownMan

theres an agility shortcut outside of shilo village entrance, like ??? lets not make that useless its a high level one

The irony ffs. Amaizing

9th item is guthix ma2 cape

I suppose everyone took the bait.

I didn't resist and got the pet on the 4th cape

I'd be for this as an toggle option rather than a flat out change

Dhide infinity kodai acb 1-2 range pots 5-6 brew rest restores...
---
Dunno what you expect theres no gear variation for non max mains
---
Yes, several times.
---
Dunno who taught you basic arithmetic, but they didn't do a very good job. Each bone is 4.5 xp if burried, 15.75xp if used on a gilded altar and ~31.5 if used on the chaos altar. Since there are 1m bones, using them on a gilded altar is just shy of being enough for 101 prayer, or 108 in the wildy (7 levels = 2x exp rule). Also, if you were observant, you'd notice that OP is already 99 prayer, so even 1 bone is enough for them to get to 99.
---
Not even gonna argue with a guy that quits a game he's played for 4 years over a graphical update.
---
Damn
---
I'm just saying you can tell the difference
---
Checked and he doesn't have it either.
---
( Õ°¬∞‚ÄØÕú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I knew we told them we want dangerous random events again but this is out of hand
---
You gonna donate these bones my man? I could use 250k of em
---
Nice dragon pick dude, did you get it from kbd?
---
Get em yet?
---
I got mine through slaying. 1,200 points is not hard to get with Nieve.
---
15.8k exp on a lit gilded alter its a little bit more than 99
---
Sparc Mac is a fucking unit when it comes to shit like that. Watch his ely farm videos. Crazy shit.
---
Wtf is that
---
And people gamble way more irl so what's the difference
---
Damnnn that's a pricey 99 to get...
---
It was like a clans own little world they could hang out in and build stuff in it‚Äôs like building mode for our houses but a lot of people contribute to it
---
Only the second time? I'm on my 6th
---
Makes me wonder why the real RuneScape client doesn't look this good...
---
I think cap is 5m he probably 'quit' as in he didn't play it but everyday/once a week logged in. Chopped some logs and replaced coffers. Takes all of a minute.
---
No reason to change them
---
1/280,240. RIP your rng.
---
In terms of gear progression, am i better off upgrading from a rune cb to a dragon cb or getting an archers ring first? I do have the NMZ points to imbue it. But the archers ring would obviously leave me with less money.
---
No

thanks homie, logging in now. Wish me luck!

You can program a long press on your right click :)

Yes.

360s are very stressful, you got this dog, just keep trying!
---
Need raw cash with minimal reqs? Collecting mortmeiyer fungus is a good go to. Don't mind getting a few reqs? Lunar spells have a few good options like super glass make. Mage exp and pretty good profits. Hunting red chins is 400-750k per hour as you level and get the 5th trap. Blast furnace bars are nice too. 
---
For afking, infernal/sacred eels, gargoyles, cballs all make north of 200k an hour with minimal interaction
---
Check the wiki for updated rates per hour and try around
---
You need to wear ring of charos
---
It's a joke but he's trying to give an example of what they could do with MTX. There is a Morytania group boss coming out next year though.
---
Lol, it's going up everyday $$$.
---
Are you sure you arent flexing the champion cape?
---
That reminds me as well of another time I guess I didnt really get scammed, but lost a lot of money. When I finally got 40 defence and finished Dragon Slayer, I thought I was the most OP thing in the game walking around in full rune with my rune scim. Tested my new gear out at hill giants firsts and a tore thru those things like nothing, atleast compared to the addy I was using earlier.
---
Taking my new gear and a now boosted ego, I thought I would be unstoppable so naturally I went to the wildy. Full rune gear, full inventory of lobsters. I did not know what pures were either, so I was shocked when someone a lower CB lvl than me was hitting 17's while my max was like 18. I had no idea how he was doing that, before he made me sit I asked how he hit so high and all he said was "str ammy" lmao. So now broke me decided to gear up like he did, monk robes, rune scim, and a amulet of strength. Went back to the wildy and was pwned even easier than before since I now had no armor outside of the robes. It wasnt until a few years later I learned what a Pure was. I really wish there was a way to experience the game like this again, as a naive preteen with no knowledge of anything.
---
I keep a stack of platinum tokens as a 'savings' account sort of thing. It's money I don't touch and it's seperate from my go stack which I can freely spend. Only ever take any plat tokens out if I mess up and spend all my GP before making enough back before bond ends
---
What an original comment, never have I read this one.

Shayzien/pisc ones are both closest to certain clue steps.

Arceus too, for getting to the lectern.

This is the joke OP lives for. You are making his day. How do you feel?

Did you check the exact world you died on and not another world,m

Idk when I said that, but if someone said that they're overreacting

blast furnace! or green drags

Nothing more fun than spending hours trying to buy a ranarr and people selling unidentified herbs at an insane price.

It‚Äôs pretty reasonable. You just apparently aren‚Äôt very good at clicking.

Thanks, I feel that deeply. Gotta work with what ya got.

I already have the blowpipe! I'm using the crossbow on any ranged slayer tasks so i don't waste loads of money on the blowpipe.

GE was a big mistake which shifted the focus of value of goods on grinding xp. It used to be processed goods were more valuable, but now they‚Äôre worthless once the xp from processing is extracted. Terrible for the game‚Äôs health imo.

He probably had a scout account at the lava maze and did KBD until he got it

I mean maybe, the mage level of all high level revs is around ~130 with dragon having 150.so the tbows effect might not be as effective
---
Disagree, the majority of this subreddit consists of pvmers and are wildy victims that express their frustration under the guise of 'pvpers killed pvp'.
---
I doubt there is many people rwt gold to buy bonds with tbh, and hardly think this has had much affect on it.

Imagine every single person doing teaks  and then zulrah because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interests. Zulrah items prices are now tanking and now I can‚Äôt get a turn on a tree.

People in early osrs used a method where they also find out which stacks of unid herbs are good ones, then fill their inventory with random items and only buy the good unids at a cheap price. So like a scam but from the buyer's side instead.

I agree. Although I do think the G.E was an absolute necessity to the game. Before the G.E, maxing was near impossible for most players. I would say equivalent almost to trying to max an ironman account today. With the G.E. they allowed more players to access end game content, which before would only be accessible by maybe the top 100 or so players. Zezima, who they said played 8-10 hours a day every day, took 4 years to max without a G.E. The first person to max in OSRS did it in 8 months. Although I do wish we could have a pre-G.E game (kind of like how that 2007scape server, the game this sub was originally based on, before Jagex shut it down and released OSRS) I think the G.E. was the first step in this game being "ruined" but it was necessary. I love and hate it at the same time, love it because of how easy it makes things, but hate it because it changed the game dynamic completely. Today, if you try to sell an item outside of the G.E, people think you are scamming because they think why wouldnt you just sell it in the G.E.

nope, craws bow dmg buff is ridiculous

you use craws bow over tbow even on bosses like chaos ele that have a higher magic lvl

The very first thing I did as a member, more than 10 years ago now, was cut dead trees outside Draynor Manor and fletched them into arrow shafts. They sold for 10gp each and no banking was required, living the dream!
---
Search rebirth on the osrs forums
---
chaos ely / vetion are both doable also. calisto if you do some of the awkward spots.
---
Fuck are they actually going for 850m? I had one on my rs2 account and sold it for like 150m 3 years ago to buy bonds for osrs lol. 
---
I remember I bought it for 8m after getting a lucky guthans spear from barrows. Back when you had to run from canifis to barrows lol.
---
Whoa thats genis!!!!!
---
I mean he right but what if he dont enjoy that
---
Yea but you always had to go to Draynor to get Certs no matter where you were at. So if you were fishing sharks in Catherby, your ass was teleporting to Lumby then walking to draynor, instead of walking to the bank in Catherby instead. The only time atleast I remember certs being used was when selling.
---
Average is around 10k I'd say until you start getting valuable uniques.
---
Which in the case of medium clues, all of your profit comes from rangers boots.
---
Bruh... for real. You trolling me. Balancing discipline and fun is important, there is no greater xp waste than burning out and stopping. 
---
Also afk vs engaging content is important.
---
That mentality is what makes people hate the game but never quit playing. Im all for efficiency but im not blinded by it. It sounds like youre constantly in fight or flight mode thinking time is running out.
---
Believe it or not my CPU and RTX GPU occasionally spike in the heat department while running osrs and YouTube.

Not sure why tbh; probably so BS Microsoft Windows 10 is doing in the background even though it assures me ‚Äúwe‚Äôll keep things quiet while you‚Äôre gaming.‚Äù Has to be.

Hey man just so u know u have flax to bowstring available at the flax keeper!

Are you using a vpn?
---
Not everyone thinks like that. In the end it's a game. Some people like the journey more than the destination, and if that means doing content they deem more enjoyable to reach the same destination, people will do it.
---
Starting to look like that only way to fix this issue is contact to a JMod. Or use the godlike twitter support and pray.
---
I remember when they were selling for 1.2m back in the day, although that was when 1m was literally the equivalent to what it takes to get 1b today. I sold my santa hat for 12m, and that was the going rate for it lmao. Hyper inflation in RS3 is real, there is a reason the exchange rate is 9 to 1.

---
Yes, items could not be noted at banks before Feb 10, 2004. So for example, if you wanted to note something, you had to bring at least 5 of a certain item to a certer. For example, the fishing certer was in Draynor. So if you wanted to trade someone 1k sharks in a single trade, you had to go to draynor, take out a full inventory of sharks, run to the certer, exchange for certs, then run to the bank and deposit the certs and pull out another inventory of sharks. Rinse and repeat until you are at 1k.

I didn't receive a password reset email or anything just randomly locked for suspicious activity.

I do think there is a balance of setting goals and grinding through content you dont enjoy for the rewards and doing only what is enjoyable. One builds discipline and the other makes you feel good. Too much of either and you'll feel shitty and most likely stop playing sooner or later.
---
Nieve because of her tAssets.

Imagine a non-pvper trying to speak for us lmfao.

Cheat clients are 100% an issue but you're not a pvper so what would you know?.

Nah at this point the issue is macroers vs legit players.
---
Do you macro or use cheat clients? You get got  plain and simple.
---
Well it's not much imo considering a lot of people don't have it even at like 50m.
---
I like Konar, she's way more attractive.
---
Yeah I hated warding, it seemed like a pain in the ass to train. Another buy-able and would be very similar to train as RC with similar xp rates. Yeah that's gonna be a no from me. I don't want a shitty skill coming into the game when it's going to be shitty and trusting them to fix it later. 
---
I wouldn't mind Invention or Summoning coming into the game as long as they were balanced accordingly.

Yup - as I said, you need untradeables to find good teams

Pretty sure 2m / hr is really steep, a friend of mine did it recently for 8m / day.
---
Try to get enough for a back up rune pouch before they change it to where you can only get one via slayer points. The GP you can get from there is nowhere near as valuable. When they officially remove the old shop then just buy a bunch of nezzy helms and alch them assuming you didn‚Äôt lose your pouch.
---
*grammar

Diary cape is impressive because it means he's done all the wilderness diaries on top of all other risky tasks from other diaries.
---
Why should we choose to make ourselves Ironmen when there's so many updates that cater to them?  
---
The challenge is slowly being eroded away but stuff like Farming contracts and the Sandstone Grinder.
---
Its why the wc guild sucks. No point cutting anywhere else.
---
You could use someones house in W330 to tele straight to Castle of Kourend which is right on top of the catacombs.   Other than that just start leveling skills.  Not many "good" moneymakers at your level other than gathering things/doing mindless things that dont provide xp.

---
Did you die to another player? Because they get coins based on the value of your untradables if they aren't one of the 3 items protected. Keepinguntradables under 20 wildy only counts for pvm deaths.
---
google this on the osrs wiki.  They usually have an up to date calculator somewhere on their website.
---
Yep, being sarcastic.
---
Can something be done about the ease of stat restoration?
---
For anyone who isn't going to max why would they spend millions of GP on Construction for the pool when they can just spend 891 GP on a Ring of dueling?  
---
I would like to see some removals, like the Clan Wars portal and the easy tier Ardy diary going straight to an altar.
---
77.. it's like 1m xp or something
---
That would be RoT and ACU and they are.

"Why are you cutting yews? this is terrible for money and XP"
---
*proceeds to start cutting the same tree you are*
---
They don't know where they will add it, either a rare drop from slayer or from that chest larzin or whatever. So up to you if you want to risk it.
---
Wrong
---
I would say use controlled attack style and just do slayer, bossing, raid etc and you‚Äôll get 99 eventually. No need to explicitly take time out of your life to train those skills. 
---
Unless you do nmz. If you don‚Äôt sit by the computer then you can just afk in nmz and get the stats up.
---
Oke cool! And what about the cosmetic things like the whip recouler and ornament kits?
---
If you can't make 1m, you're not mid level.
---
Any plans on making Diving pots sprites larger/more aesthetically pleasing?

Coffer max is 7.5m, which gives you 90 days of max output (assuming you keep favour up.) It takes about 230 days to cap your kingdom.

It was shot well, but it adds zero to the story.

yes i did die to another player - and 99alt to your point i thought i would be able to retain or retrieve them too even pvp death.  i swear i've died in this exact scenario and had the broken items in my inventory upon death this is weird.
---
Zezima pked you
---
This is some very good luck, especially the abby dagger I wouldn't expect to make 20m in a day of slayer at roughly 87 slayer.
---
It‚Äôs been 13 minutes, how‚Äôd it go?
---
They shouldve been broken in your inventory id definitely go back and check the floor again though because ive died with broken untradeables and they drop to the floor.
---
There are 3 yews near the entrance which are right near the bank deposit box in the axe shop which are almost always deserted

You should consider whether you're letting games occupy a lot more time than "a few hours a week" in your mind. It's still unhealthy behavior if you're spending the majority of your day thinking about them or interacting in online communities with them in mind. If you want to know about me personally I don't really play video games or think about them very much. 
---
I don't believe that people who play games cannot simultaneously better themselves but I do believe most lessons you learn from games would have come faster to you if you were participating in other activities. Lessons that have real world applications are better learned in the real world for obvious reasons.
---
I think you have an unhealthy relationship with them because it seemed like you believed I was personally attacking you by saying that I don't believe OSRS teaches discipline, but it may have been a difference in culture. Regardless I hope you maintain your acumen and a healthy balance between your hobbies and mental health.

I don't play mobile, so I'm unaware of that bug- sorry.  As for fixing things, I think this would be a "fix" to the 3rd party client issue, and such plugin-expansions would be fairly low cost, considering that the feat has already been accomplished and only needs to be redesigned slightly to fit into the vanilla client.  If there's issues with mobile, I think they ought to fix that too tbf though.  If we keep suggesting it, they'll fix it.

Could you simply implement a new food/potion into wintertodt that heals 20% (rounded up) of the max hp of the player? It takes little to zero dev time, and has 0 impact on the main game outside of wintertodt. This new food could either be a herb that you gather at the start of the game then mix it into the vial of water (or simply make it that the potion that currently heals pyromancers heals you aswell for 20%) for 4 sips, or it could simply come from a box inside of wintertodt.
---
I know you discussed it last week but they reasoning for 10hp being meta was really rubbish imo... I don't think that anything like that should exists in an mmo that basically makes the content more annoying the more hp you have (the more your account is progressed)....

Definitely not true, Vorkath can straight up drop 70-75k. And if he double rolls it would be more like 150k.
---
This is great advice. The only gotcha I think was missed was to turn your attack style to long range when hitting the healers for the first time. If you don't there is a chance a healer behind Jad will pull you into melee range.
---
To give myself one less thing to remember in the moment, I set my attack style to long range before the fight and only set it back to rapid after dealing with the healers. The lower DPS was worth the peace of mind.

Well if it actually does double your xp rates, then he's already saving about 1m an hour in runes, so then adding 1-2m back in cost  for a shuffle and still getting double standard xp is definitely more efficient if you're gonna be bursting/barraging in the first place.

It useally does when you create an account and the vpn changes your ip after a few minutes. Besides Jagex wouldnt know who the original creator would be making the account lost.

I mean, is it really a risk when they're a 10hp pure on a slayer task? Not exactly the most dangerous pking account when 90% of hits will ohko them.

Awesome, thanks a ton for this feedback. 
---
We'll consider making the Rune pouch a lot cheaper not just in BH, but the Slayer shop too (polled, of course). 
---
I want to add more rewards to the shop, but the way we go about this is TBD. It's not clear that polling only to players that want something is a good idea - the team is having a meeting to discuss this later this week. 
---
We'll look at either changing the curve for receiving points to feel more rewarding or increasing the value of the crates - or a combination of both. 
---
We can tweak the tasks in the way you described and add some of the ones you suggested - things that require specific equipment to be used still aren't possible though.

I am considering making one but I am not sure if it's worth the effort (and the additional membership per month). My main is 2100 total, and I imagine I can make enough cash to max with raids, vorkath, zalcano etc.

But i see a lot of people play rune drag alts, I was wondering what do they do with the money? Is it post 99 XP?

Zalcano mvp drops.. 
---
Feel free to shorten the question 
---
I swear there is a bug in the code when they changed how the MVP drops work with zalcano...
---
My average loot when getting MVP is almost always less GP value than when I dont get MVP. 
---
I have nearly 1000 kills at zalcano at this point and unfortunately dont have any imperical data, but I can certainly vouch for the fact that my non MVP kills bring more GP. I'm not sure why this is and I'm sure I'll get comment saying that MVP is literally the same roll as non MVP but with an extra lower table drop, but I'm still convinced otherwise. Seeing a rune bar/ore drop or onyx bolt drop is significantly rarer when getting MVP.. I just wish I had recorded the data over the kills, but I am certain. It's a little disheartening knowing I am contributing the most but coming the worse off. 
---
Any thoughts or possibly a JMod to look into this?

Outside of pvp worlds and singles clans AHK and cheat clients are almost non existent. I pretty much solely pvp on this game and over the course of a few thousand kills I‚Äôve ran into maybe 2 people outside of clans who were definitely cheating. This is a copy paste reason for pvmers to shit on pvp having fuck all experience in it. There‚Äôs real issues with pvp that would be better talked about, besides these generic non-issues that are brought up in every reddit post concerning pvp.

If you're not an iron then sharing is a possibility, if they're much higher level than you then probably have to hop, the sharks stay in that spot in that world even if you hop, so you could even do it for 30 mins in another world and hop back

Quests to get skills up then AFK at sand/amonite/rock crabs for a bit
---
Quest followed by brainless nmz followed by raids
---
if you do slayer right from the start, which isn't necesarily reccomended, as many slayer monsters will be a bit of a pain in the ass at low level, sand crabs are a lot easier for the lowest training, but also if i'm honest with you you should really start efficient questing through stuff like waterfall and tree gnome and then get barrows gloves. basically ignore training solidly until you have a bunch of quests done, since those will give you a ton of combat XP between them.

Aside from the fact you can get there in seconds (house tab, hop to w330, use their portal) you should do the zeah (and most quests) anyways as most quests either lead to better gear or better transportation options.

&gt;Does cutting willows in Draynor Village still feel the same, or is it just a separate game at this point?
---
since the game is 7 years old at this point a lot of people are way beyond needing to do this content, but i think for sure there are a lot of people still chopping willows at least on more populated worlds.
---
&gt;I'm wondering, how well has that feeling survived the many years of updates the game has received
---
there are some things that started to kind of eat away at the nostalgia value. the kiln equivalent was put in, so fire cape isn't the big boi cape now, a lot of old ranged and magical weapons look like trash now, the whip has basically been replaced already. 
---
&gt;And also, I'm very tired of the constant efficiency chase and looking down on casual playing that RS3 has a lot of, how is that in OSRS?
---
yes but everyone accepts that really being concerned about specific efficiency is kind of a silly way to play the game. i wrote a whole bunch about this but it can really be summed up with this: the most popular osrs series is a player that can't trade, can't leave morytania, can't bank. that's not exactly efficient. 
---
&gt;And lastly, since it's a quite grind-heavy game, is it late to start now? Will I feel like I'm just locked out of content everyone else has access to, or is being Maxed a less common thing on OSRS?
---
being maxed isn't something literally everyone has, but even then a lot of people start alts and it's not like there's ever a definition of 'too late' although if you start thinking about like competing and efficiency against other players you might be barking up the wrong tree
---
but i guess the point is you weren't concerned about efficiency. just go do something.

The transcript is not really detailed on this one. They had a rather long and one sided discussion about whenever they really need to look into it because since people are going there daily it doesn't seem to be an issue at all. This was the conclusion of the discussion. Maybe they will bring the topic up in the upcoming priority polls, so be it. Its better to give them actual ideas than just telling them to "rework" and "warmth system". Its a pretty straightforward suggestion with 0 devtime involved, and last week they were concerned about devtime aswell being burned on not-so-important things like wintertodt having a poorly designed damage system.

Why ditto? Is there any hidden point I dont get? Nice drawing btw!

I do ranarrs, like 5-6 runs a day at most, 10 runs give you 2,5m profit, on weekends when I have absolutely nothing else to do I do 10 runs a day and get 5m per weekend, this is 14 days playtime already. I have financed herblore 99 and prayer 99 using only this method since I cannot hardcore nolife that much anymore because of work. This is assuming you have all 9 spots.

Brush stop trolling and re read my post. I literally said imagine everyone doing zulrah then said the items would tank and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to cut a teak log. No shit I know the scales are rising I‚Äôm literally afking sacred eel fishing, but that‚Äôs not the scenario I made in the post
---
You forgot the ‚Äúaww look at this little cutie haha lol XD r/cutenoobs‚Äù
---
Potato with cheese 9gp for 16hp @ Warrior's Guild, easy to stock up.
---
I did this with monkfish the other day.
---
Ditto really be the kind of sick motherfucker to get 99 runecraft.
---
Doesn't matter, he's still working for that 1m/hr even if it's spread out in 5 min chunks.
---
I think it would be sick to make the armor uncorrupted
---
A surprise to literally nobody? I swear every other week this clip gets posted. Shocker Jagex shut down a private server /s
---
Normally still doesn't include hazel cult.
---
I‚Äôve Gambled like 39 capes lol. No lucky
---
Now draw a charizard with an infernal cape. Go!
---
True ofc
---
Fellow mid level checking in, 
---
Bird house runs, buying battle staves, herb runs and kingdom add up, also I unlocked vorky and it changed how I play the game. Keep on questing good things to come
---
Just restart account honestly wasted time

Hardcore Ironmen don't need an item to become an ironman on death. Start as hcim and play the game normally

Hey! What clan are you? Always nice to see others not being toxic.
---
Yeah, they've also literally said **last week** that a change to wintertodt's systems is a huge undertaking and not a simple job, the exact opposite of this comment...
---
Bruh there's literally a sub called r/InclusiveOr it's not some newfound way to reply to stuff.
---
You might as well be HC, then it's up to you how seriously you take it. I know of some HCIM who won't do a lot of dangerous content because they might dc and die.
---
Came here for this
---
It was profitable way back in the day... I bought my first whip with the cash I made from 99 fletching
---
They already addressed this
---
Nice one, thank you all for your replies. Like you say, might aswell start as Hardcore and just go from there kinda thing. Cheers üòä
---
I wouldn't recommend it. For iron dragons you'd be better off using mage I think, and for blue dragons you'd probably want to range.  Generally speaking dragons are skip tasks tho, they're meh profit and bad xp (With the exception of doing Vorkath for blue dragons, tho salve and slay helm don't stack so at that point you're just grinding Vorkath and getting some slay XP as a bonus).
---
Can you stop posting this shit everyday. You're overpriced and if people want that service they'll pay the usual rate. Why don't you make gp by proper methods instead of being a leech
---
&gt;	Brush stop trolling

Brush? The scales are steadily climbing.
---
If I don‚Äôt train my skills and do bosses in the most optimal way with the most optimal gear, I will die

Order the diapers online to your house.
---
I use the same account info from my main on rs3 on osrs. Same membership I think
---
Mobile on the toilet + get mom to wipe you
---
I guess some people just don't care about efficiency
---
It‚Äôs never to late to start, start up a new account now go through the basic members quests waterfall quest tree gnome village etc you end up getting rid of the early boring levels and before you know it you will be blasting through all the old and new content. Have a look into Ironman mode btw for some real game changing experience good luck.

Choppin and droppin
---
after he put up 5minutes of moaning porno sounds, i CBA watching this guy ever again such a little kid
---
Any plans for the Mahjarret questline / lore?
---
Some guy tried to give me a rune scimitar on mobile and it took me five minutes to figure out how to accept his trade
---
He would probably splash so no worries haha. wait..
---
People really overreacted on the partnership thing imo.
---
With the price of logs right now, I'd wager fletching is more profitable than ever right now. Of course there are far better moneymaking methods nowadays regardless.
---
Varrock TP broken altar spirit tree bank GE and Romeo few steps away
---
83 construction for the boost requires a hefty amount of gold. I don't think anybody really cares about the stat restore if you've sunk 15m+ into the skill.
---
I'm 89 wc. In wc guild with drag axe, I get about 23k xp/hr and 100k ish gp/hr cutting magics, and 35k xp/hr and like 30k or so gp/hr on yews.
---
I did quite a lot of magics but switched to yews to get to 90 quicker, the extra money on magics isn't worth it imo
---
Send this to the top
---
Mahogany Tables are the quickest method to 83. however quite expensive. They can give up to like 600k exp an hour.
---
You can use your rs3 acct to log into osrs. You will be stat wiped to a lvl 3 but it's the same account. One membership gets you access to both games on a single acc. Not need to give up that 5 bucks a month gf unless you already started an osrs acct on it as a non Ironman.
---
No their not, everyone has scales and the price is at like 60 gp per scale now
---
Depends, if you‚Äôre deep wild pking you‚Äôll suffer without overheads.
---
Ahh yes of course! Genius, thankyou for the heads up!
---
OSRS already has mtx in bonds. Necessary or not it's still mtx.
---
Dude made a deal with the mob for better rng
---
Totally understandable. I think there would definitely be repercussions we‚Äôd have to consider with any potential solution. I‚Äôm all on board for an item sink though

It's 1/16...you're not really that lucky
---
I suppose I over purchased by a bone or two .. üò•
---
I‚Äôm lucky if I can hop on for more than 15 minutes. I‚Äôve got a family and responsibilities and all that jazz now. I just hop on, kill a few things, then go break up a fight with the kids or something.
---
"Jajex?" So basically you want everything you use but, the rest is "over powered." "potion timers, slayer numbers, monster hp, boosted stats and stretched mode, has to have stretched mode" is what I got from you. Who's to say what is and isn't overpowered? So you like the game simple, that's great! But, some like more than you do and jagex simply doesn't have the manpower to update the vanilla client up to what everyone wants. I personally like the clue scroll thing, I mean do you want to remove the wiki clue scroll info because its "too overpowered", because basically its pulling the same info from the wiki. I agree the clue puzzle solvers are a bit much but who's to say they are or aren't? I like puzzles that's why I say that, others may not or really struggle them and a clue would take them an extra 10-30 minutes to the point where they'd just drop the clue when there's a puzzle while it takes others 30 seconds. I think some of the things you said should be added to a vanilla client, its about time (may I include item drop names and values?) but, I do not think from what you said 3rd party clients should be removed.
---
I could never!!
---
Just put in a catheter and an FMS and you‚Äôre set
---
There is no way to do this. Just gotta go manually check the level guide. Luckily for range, there really are not that many unlocks to begin with
---
Idk close the chat box when you're about to finish the raid or something. Are you soloing?
---
Need more Zulrah bots ASAP, scale prices are ridiculous
---
RWT is bannable for both parties.
---
The screen shot would just show the level up message not any unlocks so you can see the same level up message in the chat right away anyway. The screen shot wouldnt tell him anything he is asking for.
---
See all you did there is prove my point ya neck beard xD
---
This just sent me down a rabbit hole of nostalgia.... 
---
When I was a little F2P bot killing cows for cowhides, someone came up to me and made me his business partner. What I found out later by walking to the al kahrid bank was he was buying my hides for 60 and immediately flipping them for 100 üòÇüòÇ 
---
That‚Äôs how I learned to merch
---
I thought it was Charmander cooking a pizza on its back :/

Can confirm. At 2600 hydra kc on my iron at the moment and sitting on a 155m cashstack without even having alched everything. That's ONLY alchs... Hydra is insane money.

You were doing ToB on a 13 prayer pure?
---
You can logout in between waves, it will save your progress and when you next log in you will be at the start of the next wave.

I believe that giant seaweed is the best chance at the farming pet with a 1/7500 drop rate.
---
I remember fletching in the days before OSRS came back, and I wasn‚Äôt making much money. Decided to go on a fletching grind and am on yew longbows right now. Buying the logs and the bowstrings, then fletching and stringing the bows is making me some pretty sustainable profit and it‚Äôs pretty AFK so I just cut the logs in class and string them when it‚Äôs homework time. One week of doing this got me from 1-71
---
Reporting for duty
---
Fox are just gay dog
---
ah like that gl
---
I personally think you shouldn‚Äôt automatically stop attacking demonic gorillas when they change prayers, but it always seemed to me more of an engine thing than something to help players out. In the same vein I think having to manually stop attacking vork to avoid getting screwed by the cooldown when attacking the spawn is something that adds mechanical difficulty to the boss, which is good considering how easy(mechanics wise) he is already.
---
What the fuck
---
What is Jagex's reasons for not supporting mouse on mobile? It's a simple but huge Quality of Life that we need, mobile players are already at a huge disadvantage compared to runelite players, can we get this PLEASE!
---
Hespori is 1/5375-1/4525. Granted you can only do it once per day, still decent odds.

Tip.it has these. They call it a skill planner.
---
This has been my rs life for a while. Do tasks till I get one I don‚Äôt want to skip or do, bust out a few mediums then repeat. 300 clues only boot drops have been 4 wizzys
---
Was referring to the thousands part
---
It really isn't that bad ;x With range you basically just unlock the next dhide tier ever 10 levels until you get to black dhide (lvl 70). Then I think it is mostly just blowpipe and tbow at level 75.
---
Dwarf cannon to make boss foghts easier
---
You can actually 2 tick those teaks if you don't use herb tar there and instead: Click on tree, move 1 square, click on the tree again
---
Indeed... what IS that helm?
---
Ban vapes, buy more cigarettes
---
Been usaing evscape‚Äôs beginner guide set up, so ahrims with a serp helm and trident of the swamp with a god dhide and blowpipe switch. I‚Äôve been getting better but I think my limiting factor is just the amount of money I have to spend of supplies to practice. Been using the beta world lately which is helping.
---
I thought this was gonna be a shitpost about adding a social skill so our characters can get good at what we suck at
---
The pker had me dying
---
You never see items other people lose on death unless they die to a player. After an hour they just despawn.
---
I stopped taking it my Junior year of high school so, like 8 years ago, and then restarted this year. I‚Äôm at 25mg
---
rancid meat markets
---
Iirc, it's the best XP/hr for high level mining besides 3 tick granite.
---
I'd also forward it to Jagex, unless it somehow incriminates you.
---
Everything in looting bag is lost on death so that sounds sketchy af
---
No chance. Ill wait for a buyable
---
I remember when Yew logs were almost 1k each. The spot right outside Catherby used to be where I‚Äôd camp out and cut them for days on end.
---
yes because i go to build mode to examine my table
---
Would be nice to finally have justification for the existence of the elemental talisman. Correct me if I'm wrong, but since it can't be made into a tiara, no-one will ever use that thing.
---
HP way too low, 1 def pures your combat can practically 1 shot you bolting to gmaul
---
Might be okay for rushing tho
---
Oak planks are the cheapest option, but at level 74 you unlock oak dungeon doors which are both built and removed with the one key. You can find videos online of how to position your camera so you don't have to move your mouse, just hold down 1 and right click left click a lot.
---
I just hit 91 last night doing this, it isn't that bad once you get to 74, but I hated larders.
---
Why stop at 98
---
Now it is your civic duty to single-handedly tank the market
---
Show this shit to FAUX and MR MAMMAL RIGHT NOW
---
Where do you cut mahogany and bank most efficiently?
---
I like to play casually and when someone tells me something I'm doing is inefficient or that my gear is sub-optimal I just reply "yeah for you maybe" to flash the UIM symbol, 95% of the time they dnt know the efficient ult training methods so they either have to shut up or tell me I have no life for playing an iron, which is just a more satisfying way of them shutting up.
---
Juul didn't just offer to ban flavors. They were forced by said regulations.
---
Damn. Guess I‚Äôm just in that weird gap between mid level and end game content. I‚Äôll keep grinding barrows then till I have the cash to quickly train my slayer.
---
Always down to raid lol
---
Man you gotta check out my toe spoon, you're going to love it
---
[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Level\_up\_table](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Level_up_table) You can check out the skill level up tables for a more exhaustive list of things unlocked per skill level as well.
---
A tiara for it would also be nice. Its main use is being a kinda rare thing and nice for doing Lunar Diplomacy or such.
---
GAMERS
---
Pathetic
---
and the IV is running in the wrong direction, wow:-/
---
facts even doing stupid shit in popular areas can make you a ton of bank. my boy was selling "weed" at ge (just seaweed) and someone was like "yo lemme get a dub" so my boy was like ok. this guy gives my boy like 27m or some shit and says "that should be $20 worth of gold, thanks". I was like holy tits. I think someone was begging at ge and my homie wanted to pay it forward so gave him a few mil too.
---
Honestly what I think I might do is keep grinding barrows till I have enough cash to just cannon every slayer task to quickly get to those upper slayer levels for demonic gorillas.
---
You‚Äôre 100% using the wrong information. There is no other explanation.
---
No duo splits yet I‚Äôve being doing some duos see if i get a lucky split, but in trios i was getting a rare every 3-5 raids since the points are way higher
---
How can anything be zero dev time
---
LMS could've been good had it given good rewards. It's the exact same issue as bh though, no rewards for the time invested, so very few invest time, causing the talent pool to stale and few new players even try it.
---
And again, I can't blame players for this because if I was new, I'd think most pvp related stuff is a waste of time too.
---
Yes quests, they‚Äôre easy enough to follow along with a guide and the big ones reap huge rewards for your account. From personal experience going to the quest cape alone built my account total level to 1700.  The mini quest in varrock museum will get you 9 hunter and another level 9 instantly, takes 20mins tops.
---
And then have some fun, get that fire cape, get decent levels for the bosses and join an active clan (you‚Äôll find loads on the forums)
---
Remember the game isn‚Äôt a linear path, if you want to achieve something small for a personal goal go ahead and do it. Get that slayer level up to fight more interesting monsters.
---
what is the difference between varrock armour 3 and 4 at zalcano?
---
I cut magic logs from 75 to 99 at the Woodcutting guild. I fletched all of them too into magic Long bows. Do what you enjoy &lt;3
---
Dropping it doesn't remove it from the log
---
Try the spider boss in fathorus dungeon in zeah, prob your best bet
---
It's supply and demand. Many people have the ability to play through bonds, and more reach that point every day, but not many people are buying bonds.
---
I did 3 hours of early game hunter just to go do tears of guthix for runecrafting xp
---
Hater's will say it's fake
---
Just make your fingers smaller lol
---
Ooooh never even heard of it. Thanks! I can just go for it right now..?
---

Where is this runelite plugin?

you're gonna need the tokens for bonecrusher anyways right
---
If the default male's name is Bob, what is the default female name?
---
You don‚Äôt
---
Nope fuck off with that shit
---
If someone could explain this to me I'd appreciate it.
---
Warding seemed to sink unimportant items, like mystic armour, except it was also being crafted as part of this skill so I don't see how this would result in a net loss or even if it did, how mid tier armour leaving would really lead to a difference in the economy.
---
Humyan_Oiych
---
1 big thing i think needs to be added is a universal PJ timer. This would help people being attacked in singles not be tagged and shit like that. If you start a fight you either end it or get away. Also if you finish you can then loot and TP without a clan jumping on you.
---
Lmaooo just did that the other day myself.  Got caught my first attempt but my 2nd was easy cause the house was the most northeastern.  Just had to sneak past 1 guard and then ran the long way around the city.
---
Jesus Christ is espresso concentrate a thing???
---
That's true but ironmen metas involve much more content than non-ironman metas. You're not 2-ticking Teak's to 99 because you need the logs for fletching or construction. Ironmen are the only accounts using 90% of content in the game. 
---
And you'll probably say "nothing is forcing you to play efficient, you can use that content if you want". And you're right, but the part I'm missing is the social aspect. Before the ge, places like the mining guild, coal trucks, fishing guild, or even something like cave horrors were all extremely popular. Now they're deserted. I could still go there, but it's missing 50% of what made it enjoyble. Seeing the world deserted is eerie. I'm not trying to play a post apocalyptic simulator.
---
i got temp banned for using a bluetooth mouse on mobile.. so be careful
---
But what if talking to him again in fact is the second time, therefor turning off the drops forever?
---
Just work towards dragon slayer, once that's done decide whether to start paying membership or not
---
Damn. That‚Äôs scary to hear. What was the offense described as?
---
Really?! I had no idea Im sorry man :(
---
There is castlewars portal at clan wars i believe
---
"why the fuck are you here taking my yew logs then, you coward?"
---
I was getting all south houses, on the last attempt I just googled where to go since I was out of stamina pots.
---
Um... can I buy this?
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
They weren‚Äôt forced to. Juul is the only vapor Company to actually make a deal with the U.S government. Shortly after they made this deal, they were bought out by Altria, which is the company that manufactured for Marlboro. Marlboro is now trying to run Juul into the ground and make vaping look bad so people go back to cigarettes.
---
Did you hop worlds?
---
&gt;The order doesn‚Äôt really matter i think.
---
There's an optimal order to do them in, but f2p quests are all fairly simple, the hardest ones are (in increasing difficulty) probably Vampire Slayer, Corsair Curse, and Dragon Slayer for the bosses, but even then you really only need 20s in melee for the first 2 and maybe 30s for the last one if you have good food.
---
The fight is instanced, you can't get your items back if you die.
---
I was on mobile mining Mithril ore in the heros guild basement, using some extra games necks to to to burthope and bank. This guy at blue drags was like why don't you do MLM? Don't you know you can buy mith ore at Blast furnace??? Some people just have to give unsolicited advice in scape.
---
Is the inside of her hut an instance?
---
You can mage the fire giants, Ive done fire giants tasks on my ironman with a bone crossbow, I've seen people with just 40 mage kill them in the waterfall dungeon for their first rune scimitar, it takes a while but its doable.
---
The terrible one that noone in reality would use because you need to risk the same tier of emblem as your opponent.

Aye but actually finding players i struggle with :(
---
Yeah. U should play for fun, not for boring.

OP, this will be the closest thing to what you're looking for. 
---
**Roleplaying / Group Questing - World 342.** 
---
It's the most general 'social' oriented world. (Apart from when worlds exist for specific activities. Then you'll encounter more people there for sure.)
---
I've neve fought any boss except the easy Hill Giant one and quest ones in this game, seems like it's too involved. Only combat I'm used to in this game is the standard grinding kind lol. Don't want to deal with likely dying/losing stuff or the people I'm with getting pissy.
---
I wonder if they could include a little 'instanced' symbol when entering an instance, similar to the wilderness level overlay in the bottom right corner of the screen, so that newer players have some insight into this.
---
Varrock 4 gives you a 10% chance to mine two of any ore which includes the zalcano ores. Don‚Äôt know if Varrock 3 includes those though.

No, ive been playing on the same world since i started

I don't think Maiden and Xarpus have walk animations so it'd oribablt be substantial dev time. Tbh Verzik should have been a Nylocas or at least had a transmog option.
---
Still there is this collection log that even many mains try to fill up
---
Did you not read the post at all?
---
Could Lil'Zik have a transmog option to be a Nylocas? Humanoid pets are weird and this one is especially ugly.
---
Do you not understand the joke?
---
Then it should be all blue rather then partially yellow
---
Pm me your RSN. You can be a +1 on one of our trios. We won't make you pay or do much, and I'll help you mark tiles after the Olm fight so when you learn you'll have them ready
---
I mean I believe it.  I‚Äôve been accused of buying my accounts before and they‚Äôre much much worse than base 80s.  He also said max combat.
---
also romeo and juliet, then u can access grand exchange after all 3 quests are done
---
An over-concern for efficiency is Runescape's plague
---
Right but 100hrs is a lot of afk casual time to spend on one level. Could take weeks at that rate.

RIP
---
Did this once at a amusement park.
---
Started complaining about the line kinda loudly and people in front of me left.
---
You could definitely do KBD with melee or ranged with base 70‚Äôs. As well you should try the Wildy demi bosses, chaos fanatic is easy to range, crazy archaeologist is good to mage, Scorpia is good to mage.
---
Obviously that‚Äôs Wildy and inherently risky but they‚Äôre easy bosses with easy to learn mechanics and are decently profitable.
---
KBD you‚Äôll need a guide for, bit complicated to explain how KBD works in just a Reddit comment. 
---
Barrows would be easily doable at 70‚Äôs, if you were dirt poor for whatever reason a black salamander is actually a good option for barrows.
---
Sarachnis in the forthos dungeon is fun to fight, decent loot too.
---
You could probably do dagganoth kings without too much hassle, and they‚Äôre really good money. Best done on a slayer task though
---
&gt;base 80s with max combat
---
I think OP is a little new to the sub to get the joke. I mean, they‚Äôre asking about what kind of money they can make with fletching at level 59.
---
Yeah, they've said in the past that they don't keep a record of people's first 99s. This is the main problem as it means people that already have two 99s won't be able to get an untrimmed cape (making it effectively an exclusive item for them). I agree with you, though, that it's unlikely they don't have some sort of record that could notify them of people's first 99s.

---
I pretty much only grab my entire cash stack at the GE. Making it rare I would forget it in my inventory otherwise, that inconvenience at the GE allows for some risk this game is in need of. Its silly yea, but I think its better like this.
---
Considering you and I both have 0 empirical evidence on have to have an actual scientific debate here, I'll just say this: I think it's highly unlikely that there is a correlation between pking and raping people irl. I believe there are several studies debunking any correlation between video games and irl acts of violence.
---
Any person who seriously tries to draw a comparison between rape and pvp in a video game is either fucked in the head, extremely deluded, or incredibly misinformed.  That's honestly seems more sociopathic as you try to belittle genuine rape victims to that of pixels on a screen. The game has an assumed risk AND  warning system. It's designed that way. People who get pked are NOT in any way a victim. They assumed the risk which was designed by the game and entered into said risky zone

I want to make another account just to downvote this twice.

What do you get at 75 slayer that makes loads of gp? I stopped playing a few months ago because making the gold to pay for members was too much of a drag and I didn't enjoy the game enough to justify paying for it. But I've got 73 slayer on the account so I wouldn't mind paying for a month or so to get up to 75 if it meant I could sustain a bond with minimal effort
---
Why didn't you just take a picture???????

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read a post full of such brilliance and quality, what an amazing accomplishment seriously I can‚Äôt say it enough
---
I feel ya man, same thing happened to me with archers, and just finally got one. You'll get it soon!
---
&gt;Literally everyone else: 0.0
---
Nope, it's an old tactic that was/is used by the tobacco industry
---
The game is designed to allow pvp interaction. The game has warnings of such interactions and its risks. U dummy thick
---
who knows, maybe you motivated him to learn what the hell even happened. he might have been drooling over how cool and powerful you are. 
---
you did the right thing - sometimes in particular situations, the killers do feel like, wow, that was graphic... but then we realize its just a silly medieval video game and chuckle. 
---
if you manage to pm him, give him his stuff back and maybe some gold, or just tell him to not be a dumb ass. either way. you can still be a good boy.
---
tldr; sometimes bad people do bad things, sometimes good people do bad things, sometimes it feels good to do bad, life goes on

There is a lot of efficiencyscape but it's not terrible. Find a good cc to chill with.

Wouldnt change anything.

I don't mind helping: RC is bad

Yeah, I fully expect Jagex's MTX addiction to destroy them before our addiction to OSRS destroys us.
---
bond ur account bro
---
That's my friend who sent it to me's fault. But he's one of us sooo.

You can buy tier 10s on the ge now my guy

Damn, at least now we can be sure he bought the rs account lmai

It does not.

I will never understand why people loan out multiple bils to stakers, especially when 1) they are already massively in debt and 2) they are smaller not really well known streamers.
---
So a zerker vs a Pure in that combat bracket. The zerker wins?
---
wow! lol! what cb  are you?
---
I can‚Äôt seem to find them, what do I need to search for?
---
Ooh nice - must have been a recent update they has none not too long ago
---
Can we add more lvls to the wilderness and expand north of the area? That area can consist of roaming revs and other content. It shows the risk for reward and those revs only can drop the pvp weapons
---
If you‚Äôre new enough to not understand ‚Äúinstanced‚Äù then you probably didn‚Äôt lose much money anyways.  Not to mention anytime an instanced boss fight happens you always get a dialogue of something like ‚ÄúEVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM WILL BE LOST UPON DEATH. Are you absolutely certain you wish to proceed?‚Äù
---
I get the green one!
---
Thank you
---
Lmfao how do you type this shit with a straight face? This bh update was first talked about at last years runefest. So bhers have been waiting over a year for this joke of an update that drastically reduces their gp/hr.
---
Meanwhile there's been constant pvm/skilling updates.
---
They've spoken about pvp more recently because they've finally realised how much they neglect it.
---
umm......what. I just bought my first dhcb from doing zulrah. I started in pleb gear and worked my way up to max zulrah (minus arcane/sang/tbow). Even at lower levels it blew anything else i could do out of the water gp wise.
---
Should just be mysterious emblem, make sure you‚Äôre on a members world
---
Investor/shareholder demands. 
---
They want the highest short-term return on their investments. They don't care if the game goes down in flames - they take their money out, find some new thing to stick it in, and repeat the cycle somewhere else. 
---
The only real thing that can ward off MTX is players bailing on the game that has them and a solid threat to bail on the game if they decide to crowbar them into OSRS. If the company can actually project that adding MTX will be a sharp nosedive in subscriptions and bond purchases and the like, then they'll probably not add them.
---
The moment the ones at the top foresee that MTX will make them more money in short-term revenue than subscriptions/bond-sales will be dropped off, they'll do it. Polls might be how they feel out the community's willingness to buy but no matter what the % says at the end of the day, they'll force them in IF they think it's worthwhile.
---
Randomness is random
---
Yeah these collection log Completionists are insane.. all activities and bosses combined, it‚Äôs probably gotta take at least 100,000+ kills/completions to fill that log up.
---
Meet Theodore Cleatus, my Flax Field-locked Ultimate Ironman...
---
How many keys are you getting for this to be an issue
---
Dude.. It says in the title "Increasing my AFK profit" and then multiple times through the post. I can't understand how you're not grasping that.
---
It's a shame they've gotten rid of them. Those were my go-to. Now I'm stuck with mint because tobacco flavor tastes.. bad.
---
Not much you can do with 100k lol..
---
Maybe get better gear if you can, invest in skills you like to do maybe? 
---
Other then that, keep grinding.
---
Tbf if I was playing RS and some creepy random guy came over and tried to form an emotional connection with me, I‚Äôd probably block them too..
---
Yeah maybe, ive done about 3k so far after i noticed a while ago.
---
No idea why you would expect BH to be generating profit if other players don't risk. You want emblem farming 2.0?
---
it is still debt whether or not it's enforceable.
---
Imagine not saving any characters or time swapping the 0 for a K üòÖ
---
Lol ‚ÄúAnother boss done....‚Äù 
---
I always feel bad for Ironman who finish their favorite boss wayyyyyy quicker than they wanted due to good RNG. Then they go 5,000+ kills dry on their least favorite boss.
---
Vork head can also be mounted in your POH. Dunno though. The wiki doesn't even have Hydra heads on it's "items that can't be alched" page.
---
LMAO you know your clans shit when you gotta advertise/flex on reddit
---
This is the most frustrating thing about Runescape to me. One person might spend 300 hours at shamans to get a DWH, then another guy gets it in 10 kills lmao. I get that it should even out in the long run, but the fact that this type of discrepancy can exist is hilarious. Literally hundreds of hours vs less than one.
---
should make Vork alchable too then, weird.
---
What area of the game / boss / quest is this? Never seen it before. Just a curious noob.
---
You‚Äôre welcome

Maybe i will start exping Mining and/or Smithing?

when you do more than one clue, or are doing it efficiently you don't do that.
---
I found that farming ents with lvl 75 woodcutting made me  400k/h (seems safer than green dragons and way faster to bank and get there) 
---
Killing green dragons with about 70-70-70 stats gave me around 300-400k/h
---
Honestly if I had a son and I saw them gloating like this on the internet I‚Äôd send them to military school
---
It's not exactly a monster, but the Catapult Room in the Warrior's Guild gives 10 def exp per successful block, so you could use that.
---
Not really, they just keep polling PvM content in wilderness. That's hardly PvP content, it will and should get a consistent "NO" vote. Stealing creations would be a more competitive PvP update than today's wilderness.
---
In my experience I average about 8 herbs/patch with ultracompost and magic secateurs. This includes dead herbs. You can calculate your net profit with (8 x Cost of Herb) - Cost of seed. 
---
Personally I would recommend avantoe seeds over ranarr. Avantoe provides roughly the same net profit for more XP and less required capital.
---
Never forget the socially inept have groups to gather up in to feel relevant.
---
when did the whole "efficientscape" thing start? it wasn't like this back in the day, it's certainly a new thing and it annoys the hell out of me
---
It‚Äôs not possible
---
such as?
---
Even with 90+ stats, you can pk just fine. The effect of minmaxing is largely blurred out by this point.
---
Just kill the baby blue dragons and wear a expeditious bracelet if you really want to. You‚Äôll fly through it

thanks for letting me know! I have been looking at a BUNCH of laptops lately as I would love to upgrade in the near future.

Can you make trade toggle-able just like report option?

Both great skills to start, I‚Äôm guessing your f2p?

If I were use just use the materials you mine to smith with well make it cheaper on yah.

Nice inspect edit lol reported

except that's not how RNG works. It doesn't "remember" any past events.

I'm certainly not going to sell phonebooks to make money when I could just work a 9-5.
---
Most of the stories of people dying from Vapes were due to pneumonia, and the weakened immune system thing makes a lot of sense there. The lung collapsing thing that the other guy commented or people being just unable to breath is news to me lol

Kill the baby dragons. Takes like 2 seconds. Very fast.
---
Abyssal sire

I feel like you emphasized the wrong word.

Cool, whatever makes you feel better.

Ye i thought that too, and yes im f2p.

Adding you!

Can we get the ability to break down crystal armour seeds into crystal shards? The armour isnt very useful and this will guarentee that it maintains it value.

I‚Äôve had people berate me in game because I was skulled before....
---
You showed pity, You're weak. 
---
A real pker doesn't show empathy or compassion, in the wilderness you're the predator or the prey
---
Isnt really worth doing without fally hard tho
---
Will there ever be a change for the points system in tithe farm? Currently it takes 3500 to 3600 growths to achieve all the uniques from the shop and if you want to get grape seeds/ bologa's blessings it would cost a significant amount more games. Would it be possible to reward the player with a point bonus every 5/10 games of an extra 5 points or something similar to slayer tasks but not exponentially increasing. This bonus would only apply if you got the full 100 to harvest. This would make the ability to buy seeds and blessing after the original 900 points much easier.
---
Also there could be a change to the amount of points given by specific fruits that are harvested so that when you have harvesting golonova you get 26, bologno you get 27 +1 and logonova you get 28 for a +2 bonus after a full harvest. Since currently you get the same amount of points per full harvest for any tier of the plants it doesn't feel great if your going for points. Already did the 900 on my iron and main using the 20x5 method but it just doesn't feel great for it to take 10-12 hours to do. Even if it is very chill and relaxing.
---
This would maybe mean that the xp rates could be reduced slightly in the sense that if you were doing the 25x4 method you would still be getting the same xp/hr as if you were doing the 20x5 tick perfect method, on previous xp rates which is maybe about a 3.5-4.5% decrease in xp/hr. Which inevitably balances out with the 2.5% increase from the outfit anyways.
---
This change could incentivize people to go there more that are only looking for the points and would be more qol than anything...
---
TLDR: Increase of points per hour considering bonuses for streaks, or bonuses for higher tier fruits. Thereby slightly reducing the xp/hr.
---
I can't understand how you can't grasp that he's suggesting something that will make him more than what he does now by playing a couple hours a week after work or in the weekend.
---
And he even starts of with "maybe not the answer you are looking for"
---
This works great for fishing, but way less great for mining/wcing/hunter where you're actively competing for resources.
---
Thanks man. I‚Äôll keep it in front of me so I remember!
---
If you want to actually talk to people you need to play F2p or find a different game.
---
Modern runescape is not a social game anymore.
---
ehhh, if its just straight rainbow i don‚Äôt really like it but if you have a color scheme to it, it can look clean.
---
"I want to increase my AFK profit" it's really not that hard to understand
---
I wondered to myself, "how long has it been since I logged in?" As I was doing afk nightmare zone.
---
I was having that issue on mobile for a while. I think it has something to do with IP Changes. It stopped after a bit but I have no idea how to fix that except when I was connecting to my home wifi every time.
---
Risk is irrelevant here. Bh is a separate reward system to simply looting another player's items.
---
Its supposed to be a system where almost all pkers can turn a profit and sustainably pk while progressing their accounts. As it stands, even a decent pker that goes 5:5 will be burning through 500k-1m/h in supplies and not breaking even in pking. Those who are learning to pk and maybe go 2:8 will have zero incentive to continue pking.
---
Wrong, dolo GWD is very often better gp than vorkath.
---
Lol I feel this. 
---
You enter the wildy, you accept the consequences. 
---
But there is a part of me that feels bad for these noobs. It‚Äôs both initiation, but I know there is a chance it ruined their experience and made them perma quit the game. That‚Äôs what noob/young version of me would do. I just wanna see these little noblets thrive into beautiful master members. 
---
It‚Äôs why I balance my PKing karma with gifting karma. I‚Äôll dress up in holiday items and go to Hill Giants on random f2p worlds. I look for non-main non-pures grinding their way through early levels and then play a game with them where they are ALWAYS a winner. I‚Äôve given away too many millions doing that... but with all that Vorkarth money, I don‚Äôt feel too bad about my bank shrinking by giving noobs an experience they will never forget.
---
 Congrats on your first 100k, glad to see newcomers to this game. Youtube and the OSRS wiki are great resources when the game feels a bit overwhelming at first. 
---
 As a newcomer you should make sure your account is secured. I don't like seeing posts about people getting hacked because they weren't secured. 2FA on osrs account as well as have your email 2FA. BANK PIN IS A MUST. Security questions written down in a notebook as well your current password and if ever you change it keep the old ones for recovery purposes in case you have to recover your account.
---
I hope you keep enjoying the grind!
---
Apparently it is for you
---
Mom help I have 2 broken arms.
---
Go to the sand casino and chuck it...
---
I mean I knew this, I just said you‚Äôre doing is very smart because you added this on for seemingly no reason lol. Just seemed like that one kid that has to make sure everyone knows he‚Äôs smart all the time, calm down tho bro.
---
Congrats! Make the most of Sara, Mole, Hydra, and Zulrah.
---
Do knights sword. Druidic ritual, the dig site  and rune mysteries

Try to remain 10 hp.

Skill to 50 in each gathering stat or better. Wintertodt to 99 fm.
---
Play the game however you like after
---
The "bigger version" you're talking about is probably something you've seen on Youtube or Twitch, that's just a zoom-in on the screen to make it more viewer friendly, there's nothing happening on their end. If you don't like how tiny the fixed screen is on your computer, you can either enable stretch mode on Runelite, or just decrease your pc screen resolution. Take a look on what works best for you.
---
Sure bro. We believe you.
---
Agreed
---
With this droprate it is
---
I've changed it on wiki to not be alchable :)
---
Thanks, keep on bragging about knowing basic stuff, maybe go solve for X in front of some kids to impress them lol.
---
Yeah I got bored of being able to go to the grand exchange and just get whatever I needed at any time! I did the same with my main not long ago!
---
When it drops. So if you dont pick up then it will still show. I went 1.6k dry on those horrors on my IM. But got 3 in 1 task on my main. Dont give up!
---
I love smoking my USB tho
---
You got your bank restored after getting hacked???
---
They absolutely never do that, wtf.
---
Your spade is mine clue nerd
---
Why are you so salty over me expanding on a topic he showed interest in. You‚Äôre jealous you didn‚Äôt get to comment it maybe?
---
I thought the same but I did it anyway eventually, you don‚Äôt even need to put more time into it you can play it the same amount of time and still get those levels! You‚Äôd be suprisedüòä
---
Yeah merching was funner back then. I hated skilling so much, and was never higher than like 80s combat. Most of my gp came from doing some flax for a while and then going to bank sales to try and get good deals that i could turn for a profit. Man the GE is sweet and all but we lose that living world with it. I can just drop my shit in the GE and it'll be picked up with no interaction.
---
wow i just realized that, thanks i hate it.
---
Mine was from herbs. Rannar I think
---
Set your monitor resolution to 800x600 just for your OSRS window

Grab a pencil sharpener and gradually sharpen the tip of your finger over the course of a few months.
---
So you should let the noobs live so wildy can be more active? Whats the point of bringing more people to wildy if you dont get to kill them?
---
The Blade is estimated at 1/1k drop rate. Currently it's thought that normal Gauntlet gives you 2 rolls on the normal table and a chance at the tertiary table (where the blade is), while corrupt gives you 3 rolls on the normal table but still just one chance at the tertiary table. Although this could be wrong.
---
Regardless, it seems on average the blade is about 150 hours on average to obtain it, and currently sells for 80m. So that's still only an extra 500k/hr if you count it.
---
Shit now I lost the game
---
wow thats loads of ironman updates cheers thanks pal so enlightening. see i can be a saracastic too :)
---
Omg I had the same xd
---
I like your mind add me IG: ThebadJ  I'm a  nooblet though
---
Reported for reporting
---
Nah, it‚Äôs just funny and you keep relying so why not. And no, I‚Äôm not jealous I got to be that guy lol
---
Open your eyes and you won‚Äôt make this mistake, They are different colors.
---
I don't think he understands that you can AFK NMZ for 20 minutes at a time use Chromes Remote Desktop feature to keep it afk.  
---
OP, I Did that at work for 2+ Months to get 99 Melee stats, and also got 25m in the process with 5m points leftover.  If you can afford to AFK for 20 minutes at a time, it's worth it to gather up the points while waiting on herb patches, Varrock diaries, and  Miscellanea .
---
yeah so actually i was planning on maxxing misccelania before i quit rs for a video, so before i quit i was already 150-200(+?) days in where i did my favour once a week. then i quit so i dont exactly know how many days in i stopped doing favour.
---
but when i came back i still had 96% favour and 5-6m in the coffer.
---
Hey I forgot brutal blacks aswell, if I ever get a black drag task that‚Äôs where I go! They are also super afk but take so long to kill üò¨
---
Yes and how many people are going to PK in max strength?
---
He already used all his luck no point in wasting money
---
‚ÄúTo be fair, I don‚Äôt sell stuff for one gp because...‚Äù
---
Learn how to read you African waste of air. And yes I get the whole meme of ‚ÄúSTONKS‚Äù for one gp but it just disgusts me that people want to ruin the price of items just for personal gain. And once again, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs smart to put things in for 1 gp but the reason I don‚Äôt is because of people like you.
---
You spent your bank on a Sex change?

Ruin the price of an item? LOOOL.
---
You racist piece of shit, I‚Äôm white btw. Yeah I know who I‚Äôm handling now. You‚Äôre not worth the time.
---
You‚Äôre technically right because Ecto is better xp per bone, but gilded has a faster Xp rate, so actually you‚Äôre wrong
---
Legend
---
Iirc he is just going for 1000 items on the log not the whole thing. 
---
You need every unique third-age piece for full log which is basically impossible in a lifetime
---
Also missing catherby fruit tree:p 
---
Btw if you do all that daily you better have pet. That‚Äôs insane to keep track of all that
---
That dog had it's fiber, cuz it's shitting out drops
---
Seems kind of arbitrary to define "beating the game" as anything other than 100% completing everything in the game.  
---
You're just taking all the achievable goals and deciding that's what maxing the game is.  
---
Hell you said max cape, on a post about someone who got max XP.
---
Iirc that‚Äôs an automated process, whereas OPs situation will require a human. 
---
The only human who works customer service at Jagex is also the only engine developer, cleaner, intern, CEO, head of MTX and they died 3 years ago, so it might be a bit of a wait
---
also evil chicken outfit
---
smoking is bad for your lungs
---
So, uh..we just going to ignore the Lickitung in the room for 99 cooking?
---
Or the Snorlax blocking your path?
---
Can I just get luck like this just once in this game? I‚Äôm not even going to be picky and say it has to be anything specific, let it be from any clue, or any boss, pet drop, unique item, Anything! Just let me get real lucky and drop it pre-1000kc lol, that‚Äôs all I ask. #RngesusPrayerOver.
---
The entire point of MMOs (or online games in general) is that there is no "beating" the game, that's why they were created in the first place.
---

Its good for training range to 60 or 70 or auto clicking past that
---
You are right, it is unrewarding related against its efforts. Although I never said how unbalanced it is, so please don't put words into my mouth. But if you took that thought from my Priffdinass statement: Priffdinas course is behind Song of the Elves quest (multiple quests and 70 skills) while Ardougne is only behind 90 Agility. On top of that, reaching for 65k/h from Priffdinas requires +90 Agility, so 3k additional exp/h is a reward after all the other requirements.
---
As for your statement about devaluing, you just haven't experienced it how it feels to get something which later on becomes way easier for future players, thus throwing your personal efforts into a trash can\~
---
This is why I never GEstand. Eventually it's just who can come up with the edgiest combination of slurs. Spare me.

Same thing happened to me. Submitted appeal, got my account back the next day. I think they know truthers from liars

Spirit tree to farming guild is faster if you have 85 farming.

Instead of fally teleport to fruit tree patch I just grapple from the catherby fruit tree when doing my tree runs.
---
Very similar story here. After a few days of mining, smithing and selling to general stores I had bought full mithril for 20k. Thinking I was unstoppable I naturally headed to the wildy. I think it was less than 5 minutes later that I found myself standing in Lumbridge without any of my gear.
---
It always makes me feel like they assume I'm a bot when they do this. Like now I HAVE to reply or they will report me or think poorly of me haha. Like no I promise I just don't want to talk to you. Is that worse? I'm sorry.
---
Next time I vote you make this picture with shirtless women instead. Why didn‚Äôt you think of that? Lol
---
if using an oscillating fan to click your mouse is botting so is this.
---
Who says you need to max?
---
WDR can go either way to be honest. I‚Äôve done some efficient raids with really nice people. On the flip side, some people in there are very toxic and will flame you if you make any mistake.
---
However, largely my experiences has been positive. As long as you meet the minimum gear set up/requirements and do a few learner raids first to get a grasp on the main rooms you should be fine.
---
Oops, used it on construction

Absolutely incredible man. Great job! I can‚Äôt even fathom doing this journey myself.

People getting hooked to the duel arena, they lose their banks trying to get richess. Instead of trying to earn gp they just stand at the duel arena and ask for a ‚Äòloan‚Äô. Its at a point that at Any given time there are like 5 people asking for a loan. They lost their dignity If you ask me
---
no, woodcutting is a terrible way to make money. join 'aswell' clan chat if you want, always people on who are willing to help.
---
Amateur. Camelbaks can have bladders up to 100oz.

But the part of the player base you meet are far more likely to be the ones who actually go outside.
---
Lol kingdom takes 1 minute
---
They talked about this before, it's just for redundancy. Say for the mining gloves someone glitches in before 20 mining, they still cant use the gloves even if they somehow get them before they level up that much
---
Yeah u could do green drags then just buy em from the bots.
---

Got mine on the iron around 1200 kc.
---
I had a suggestion some time ago to let kebos diary boost the amount of points in some way. 
---
My thoughts was either to start counting the points earlier, like easy diary start counting at 70 deposited seeds and will let you finish at 95, all the way up to 55 and 80 respectively for elite. This still keeps it at maximum 25 points per game.
---
Or just straight up boost maximum points per game, 30 for easy up to 45 for elite.
---
I dont even bother going to the wilderness. Too many scout bots, pk clans, and general douchebaggery. 
---
It's just not fun in any way.

It's also about timing, humans can't click at the same speed for long times.
---
Daamn, an Unholy Symbol at only 12 kc, unheard of.
---
Wait really? In the whole state? How long ago did that happen?
---
Hope he started off with getting the req for it lol Can't imagine doing a bunch of other ones then dying in the wild
---
Am I reading this wrong?
---
You only need the Trident and Dpick? 
---
Why will that take months at Vork?
---
That happened to me too. I remember the kid ran away saying "haha that's iron". Although I only lost 15k because he said he would sell me a rune 2h for my cash stack. That didnt hurt as much, but made me thing wow lmao
---
&gt;  Things just feel more worthwhile doing because the game quits being tied around your cash stack
---
Am I the odd one here, I've never felt like progression was tied to my cash stack. yeah i can use my gp to speed up some things but that's just the nature of the game. I don't have to spend the money if I don't want to. it's just a game to me I do what I enjoy whether it is fast or slow, expensive or cheap, high attention or afk.
---
so what it would be faster to sell all my herbs and just buy a bunch of toadflax and birds nests but why. I'm having fun making whatever i have in the bank and buying up whatever extra secondaries or herbs to match what I have in the bank.
---
Uh.. like half a year playing at work. Maybe more. 19 xp off 99.
---
What if you could join a chatroom and talk to all kinds of people that are scattered around the map and even people that aren‚Äôt on your world? This could be very beneficial to clans so lets call it a clan chat
---
Barb fish on main (68-&gt;70) , got a elite clue bottle few mins ago, doing wc/fletch on my alt and watching season one of Supernatural.
---
Really? I had no idea about the edge tele. Im going to go test it out. And yeah the emblem/looting bag situation is really fucked i just am joking about it because i have an assload of bh points saved up
---
this is how I am - I just find something to appreciate out of it.. even if its not MY ism.
---
ohyah a lot of us are like *less* than 1% body fat l0l
---
‚ÄúYou can argue‚Äù 
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right. You can argue with Jagex as much as you want. Won‚Äôt change the fact that u got ban :p
---
Ima delete that comment because I want to use it for something else without linking accounts too hard. If you're saying that they killed skilling by effectively replacing it with pvm, you're right. In that sense, skilling is definitely being treated worse than pvp.
---
Yes!
---
Those studies had result-ruiningly horrible testing methodology though.
---
Yeah because kids love scotch whiskey and cigars as much as fruity vodka and minty/fruity tobacco.

Unpopular Opinion: this doesn't actually happen very often. Most of you people mistake casual advice for someone "shitting on you" for being inefficient. News flash: the high levels are too concerned with their own training to give a fuck what you're doing.
---
Something more robust like old credit card or cardboard from milk box.
---
You're objectively wrong.
---
There is. You are all nitpicking a non issue.
---
Compare the following two scenarios:
---
* If I go for a PvM evening I'll spend some supplies but generate a lot of alchables and items/resources.
---
* If I go for a PK evening I'll spend some supplies and me or my opponent dies some items will be left on floor to disappear.

Catch you later, my student.

They will be releasing that in the first quarter of 2020 i believe, it will also come with a New corp like group boss after they have released the expansion area as a second patch.

Honestly mobile between sets is a bigger commitment than you'd think. End up taking a while longer than you realize to so something

Probably yes.

But it's more used as a catch-all term for a more 'social' world than others in my experience.

Back when it was labeled 'Group Questing' too, it may have been more active.

Yeah, like the other guy said Tree Spirits are nice for the Rune Axe. I got the Mithril one before I did my FM grind which only actually took me to like 45 WC so I haven‚Äôt bothered yet for the Rune one but I‚Äôll probably go get it today since I‚Äôm planning on 56 WC for Lunar Diplomacy soon.

Did it with 40 agility. Worst RS experience ever lol

cheapest iPad.

long term support and great battery are key elements for something i would want in a tablet for osrs. i say this as a Samsung phone and windows user.
---
Samsung and windows tablets (ie Surface, which I have,) just don't cut it. android never stays supported for long and imo the battery life suffers from poor optimization of apps made for *every* flavor of Android on the app store.
---
with the apps on the iPad it's all a bit more streamlined, but limited.
---
Just got in from work. Got to jad. Missed a switch when I was running to be in range with him. Clapped for max hp

Fuck. Guess I‚Äôll try again Wednesday
---
You PKd a level 66 for 15k?  He can make that back in 30 mins.  That's nothing, theres probably a reason why he only brought runes on him to the wildy and nothing else.
---
I enjoyed the post, it was entertaining, but can we stop pretending this was some lifechanging event for the noob?  Or did we actually forget how "low level" a lvl66 is?  
---
It's not like OP killed a level 17 player with a steel sword asking where Fallador was lol - now that would be cruel
---
did my first like 200+ kc there at cox and most are just flamers lol. barely even know stuff like skipping or timing burns with portals. much better to just find some friends instead of going with randoms. i did have some positive experiences but far and few in between. actually found the learners there to be wayyyyy more tolerable than standard or advanced. i think it's good to learn there but after that just find some friends to stick with lol, trust me.
---
it's discrimination to not allow that bot to play runescape if it wants.
---
Look at how many bots were in LMS on release. I'm also against all other bots but the matter of fact is that the boss kill frequency can be controlled. While the fastest zulrah kill is 31 seconds, average is about 2 mins. Players can collude to kill each other significantly faster than that in order to profit more.

Wat. I live in NY(though not NYC) and I still see juul and other brands when I‚Äôm getting cigs at 7-11 or gas stations.

Just came back to OSRS. Can someone tldr me on iron man mode?

Twisted league is just a safeword for Streamer League.

Even then those people aren't getting lipid pneumonia and/or Vitamin E Acetate poisoning though. At worst they're getting non-lethal nicotine poisoning. The nicotine base I mix with is 250mg/ml (4.2 times stronger and less diluted than finished JUUL liquid). I've spilled it on my skin before and DID NOT get nicotine poisoning. Hell, I didn't even get a buzz. Let alone a headache from nicotine overdose.
---
I'm just trying to say that you have to fuck up beyond all reason to land yourself or someone else in the hospital, and to do so requires an immeasurable amount of stupidity.

And here I thought I was lucky for getting peg/prim crystals b2b :(

Or the ‚ÄúBarrows in Wild‚Äù post.

or anyone
---
Gargoyles drop a lot of rune equipment and straight-up GP
---
Yeah the Grand Exchange cheapens the entire game experience in my opinion. Convenient? Sure. But it‚Äôs also just a huge crutch and makes the game 100% about making money instead of achieving different goals.
---
I get what you feel right now but realistically, no one gets to level 66 and then quits over a PK

If you are on runelite, maybe your client took a screenshot of their name so you can set things right.

you don't lose clues if you have a clue box, so all you really do is waste 2-3 mins of their time. Which isn't bad. It's a minor annoyance, unless you don't know about clue boxes. Which most people on reddit are too dumb to know about.
---
botting at its finest

I smoked throughout college on and off and even just the smell of a cig is repulsive to me unless it‚Äôs an American Spirit. I still couldn‚Äôt stomach one though. Once you regain your taste and smell again you realize they‚Äôre gross.

Oh yeah true, for some reason I thought dpick was like 10m and trident was like 20 or something, brain fried from work. Jeez I'll be raiding before I know it :)
---
protip: literally anyone gets mad if you keep ragging them.
---
Thanks for the response buddy
---
He's already stated that the clue items, and evil chicken pieces are so rare that no one would be able to get them all

Clearly this is a superior version
---
&gt;I got declined for my own recover?!

hackers got a better recovery than you did if that happened lol
---
I actually thought the pick was only like 4m, but apparently its more like 7-8,but yeah, You should have them in no time.
---
What was the final quest?
---
Or I'm intentionally choosing another option because I like it better?
---
Sadly f2p is a bit hard one id say range ogers took me some time but what i did was get bond money held bond made half more 6m then got mems with 2m cash in my pocket and if you can make that last half in mems more power to ya.

That‚Äôs why jagex will continue to have the worst customer service
---
Is there anyone else who has ONLY ever played Ironman? 
---
I mean I played back in the day and ofc it wasn't a feature then, but it was always a personal thing for me to not trade as much as I can, plus back then I never got very far relatively speaking. 
---
But since I restarted on OSRS I dove straight into an Ironman and it's been my only account since. I also make effort to avoid using any sort of money making guides, quest guides, or wikis in general.  I'm much further than I ever was back in the day and really enjoy getting to experience the game "as it's meant". Totally on my own accord. 
---
It really feels like an adventure, and it's so cool. I am always coming across new content, and it's easier to enjoy when I'm not concerned with xp rates.  Finding new powerful equipment feels much more like an achievement rather than ticking a box off a to do list.
---
Its just been great. Sure I'll probably never come close to a max skills, but I get plenty of enjoyment from the game anyway.
---
Yea, IIRC you get enough speed built up to skip past the barrier in 1 frame
---
Came here to say this 15m and counting
---
Strength before weakness.
---
I think you meant to type 98%
---
It's more efficient in terms of  quickly gaining weight over time. Like levels 1-92.
---
Low body fat and gaining muscle is 92-99 / 200m exp kind of grind
---
What's the point of hoarding money if you aren't gonna spend it? I just spent a huge chunk of my bank on an Eternal Glory. I play fairly casually so 30M is nothing to sneeze at. But the unlimited Edgeville teleports are so useful, it feels like everything I do is streamlined now.
---
There's a few ammonite crabs on the northern part of fossil island that make interacting with the boat really annoying, especially on mobile. Can something be done about that?

how is that even possible? how could they possibly get that much info about a random account

While we're on the topic, whne it comes to hair removal do NOT shave. Waxing is OK but super difficult and painful. Go with "Magic Shave Powder - Formulated for Black Men". The stuff works like magic

---
I guess you could argue that, there's obviously logic to the intended use being to make the images go from locked to unlocked, but yeah, if you're gonna call max xp completion then yeah 65535 of each item would be completion.  
---
Though I wouldn't consider maxing xp completion as its basically going outside of the game boundaries to complete what's more of a technical boundary. 
---
Max level, completed log, all quests all pets all music etc.. Is what I could consider completion.  
---
I wouldn't even include a max cash stack cause again its more of a technical limitation
---
As far as I'm aware you can't alch any heads, boss or not. You can't alch vork heads anyway.
---
Think of it as 92% of 1rm. 
---
People can do 2 reps of 92% and 1 rep at 99.
---
So yea
---
Yes you like slow xp so why don‚Äôt you just train runecrafting and agility all day?
---
Same, and same.
---
I guess this is what an upvote is for, but it doesn't feel like it holds the same gravity
---
who?
---
Pretty sure there have been numbers floating around that have said the playerbase is actually 95% male, not 90%. Could be fake though.
---
I‚Äôm 7 quests away from qpc. Sote being one of them. I‚Äôve done ds2 though. You think SOte is harder than ds2?
---
dungeoneering was just straight up fun tho, rewards or not

Congrats! By tip is to camp BBDs for suffering then head to zulrah for some basic gear. Done tbow rebuild 2 times already
---
Lasagne
---
I dont even think its physically possible to get every third age piece.

It would take literal decades of non stop clues and you would still likely be short a few peices.

Like the game might now even exist that long to be able to do it
---
The legit goat.

You often can get people commenting on the wrong/weird thing of some "content" and artificially boost your ratings.  Youtubers do this all the time, sometimes you'll hear them say "or maybe im wrong comment below" if they're being more honest about comment bait stuff.
---
You know you can spend a miniscule fraction of that money and spend it on a mounted glory in your house. 
---
Believe me, at one point I wanted this as a luxury item for clue completion but once I maxed my house with all teleports, ornate jewelry box etc I completely lost interest
---
difference between steel and mith axe is quite small, the real nice thing about a mith axe is early animal magnetism.
---
RC is one of my highest skills, can't relate

no, not really.
---
Even our #1 lynx titan is in decent shape.
---
That‚Äôs your opinion. I‚Äôd be mind blown if there weren‚Äôt some major dps increasing relics. Xp buffs only would be such a major disappointment and honestly extremely boring.
---
Do it dude! Started one a few months ago. Told myself i was just gonna afk it while i play my main. That lasted maybe a week and I havent touched my main since.
---
looks great!! would love a spinner pet
---
Rebuilding with a Tbow is so much fun tbh.
---
That‚Äôs not how that works lol. You don‚Äôt get to kill 1000 gargoyles and not get a gmaul then go kill 10 Abby demons and claim you‚Äôre dry on a whip lol
---
Yeah that‚Äôs kind of what I had thought since watching the videos of it. You can just bring hella brews and restores and shouldn‚Äôt have too much trouble I think. Looking forward to knocking it out though.
---
No. These are not mutually exclusive statements.
---
Cost **does not** equate to combat effectiveness. Which can be seen by a very expensive item not being very effective in combat. An item *can* be expensive because it's good in combat, but just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good in combat.
---
that's one part, did he leak his password too? i mean unless OP uses a simple ass password for security then it's his own fault for not protecting himself.
---
Tree spirits are nice with magic. You get a ton of nature rune drops, the xp from the spell (though only 10% of normal damage xp), and the chance at a rune axe. I ended up grinding 2 rune axes just in case and came away with around 500 nature runes after a few hours. That's pretty big money early on.
---
It is bis at kree, cerb, demonics, and cox for sure. Not sure about tob because i only slayer and solo cox :)

---
All f2p quests and enough money for full rune armor/scimitar
---
No, it takes a while. Depending on where you‚Äôre starting I guess it could be fast, but for me getting 1250 slayer points would take a while lol
---
Aye yo its Flex Lewis!
---
solar powered on a slightly cloudy day.  Ramps up, falls off, stops.
---
Does getting your account recovered log you out?
---
When I play on phone, then try to log on PC, I have to quit on mobile first or it won't let me in. Here you just get booted really fast, which is weird.
---
void will increase your max hit, but arma/d'hide will be increased accuracy. void does also increase range accuracy but it's not as effective as the ranged att bonus from arma/d'hide
---
bosses generally have higher defenses so the increased accuracy from arma will increase dps more than increased max hit from void
---
Classic jagex. "Oh you don't like eoc, well too bad!" " Oh you want classic minigames that were wildy popular, too bad!"
---
Yeah I unfortunately don‚Äôt have the bank just yet for higher prayer lvl. I‚Äôll get there slowly but surely haha
---
^
---
youre proving his point, why can vodka and tobacco be fruity but vapes being fruity is somehow marketing to children
---
Yeah, I guess a skiller would have the most straightforward transition into ironman. That playstyle on a main is just so foreign to me because my brain keeps saying "money money money" to me every time I skill in an inefficient way. My main is ~1850 total with maxed combat, my iron is ~1900 total and 110ish combat, so I definitely went more of the skiller route on my iron.
---
No exp waste! Haha and thank you
---
Membership
---
Haha that is epic. That is exactly how it felt like with the countless hours of grinding haha
---
One argument could be that this content was relevant back then but might not be today. Same way raids and inferno would never fit in 2004 rs. Lol can you imagine. No one would ever get those items.
---
Please jagex. We need fog, sw, and sc in the game. Osrs really lacks the social interaction that the later years of rs2 really captured.
---
Jagex already admitted that their security system is a major problem and you continue to think like this?
---
I mean, yeah.  They will probably do a couple to prove how viable and popular they can be, then, before you know it,  Slayer Only League.  Where you have to get all your stuff through killing monsters, brought to you by MONSTER energy drink
---
So gather things when i get bond or buy membership?
---
And ye i should level my prayer up.. Im not still 100% sure what is good strat for that.
---
Use four lokos as overloads
---
Are you telling me when you are AFKing NMZ you aren't training strength IRL?
---
Sad efficiency.
---
Fucking sad, and I've been in your shoes :( When will Jagex fix their shit recovery system they admitted was flawed????????????
---
Yeah 3-4 is pretty normal for solo if you're doing it normally. There is also a [5:0 method](https://youtu.be/8_ny1XeigOg) but im not sure how viable it is without a tbow.
---
I think it gave magic robes that gave double magic xp for like 4 hours or something.
---
I could beat these guys in 1 2 3
---
269 ashes from 261 Abby demons? Nice hax kid
---
Who is doing the RWT in this instance? The person losing the GP in a stake? The one loaning? Who profits and who loses, in the end, someone loses right? Not being a dick i'm just actually curious lol, I've never followed the chain enough to figure out how RWT is efficiently done this way.
---
On what lift? Going from 225 to 315 squat is easy, just eat more. And stop doing 1RMs
---
Slayermusiq1 is already in game at every turn you make. Slayermusiq1 is in all of us. Next time you're in an obscure quest area and see another player, just pop a "hi and welcome to my guide" in chat and you'll see he is everywhere already
---
It's weird how long I've been playing the game yet I know I'll never hold one lol
---
Well once you get them to de-aggro you, you can camp there for weeks at a time. There's a wyverns cc that'll come buy your stuff if you need more inventory space. The longest my alt has been there is about 18k worth of broad bolts
---
I vaguely remember this
---
Its okay. It doesn't have to be made easier, but then there should be more incentive to actually level it to compensate for the time required. Content past 80 is pretty lack luster. Only a few of the high level shortcuts are good, and they also stop at 89.
---
Wiki quick guides is BiS. I did use slayermusiq for the new Elves quest though. It wasn't bad but kind of inconsistent with some missteps. Good work nonetheless. Also I personally didn't like his childish swearing but that's just me lol.
---
That was exactly my mindset before I made my ironman. I looked at quest guides and I was like "holy shit, imagine having to get all this stuff yourself". In reality, you can just keep a bunch of supplies (ores, bars, logs, gems, milk, rope, etc.) in your bank and have the majority of the items you need for quests. It was pretty rare that I had to actually go get the stuff for quests (rather than just make it) when I was getting my qpc. 
---
It's not as bad as it seems as long as you're smart about how you play. If you pick up the stuff you'd have to go out of your way for (onions, potatoes, woad leaves, redberries, cadava berries, etc.) as you pass them, it's really not that tedious. I'd say it took me less time to prep for quests on my ironman than it did on my main simply because I had to buy everything from the GE on my main while I already had it in my bank on the iron. If a quest had something I couldn't get easily, I'd shelve the quest until I got that item passively (like the dragonstone for whatever quest needed a dragonstone. Idr off the top of my head.)
---
I would totally do group ironmen if I was able to convince any IRL friends to play an almost 20 year old game.
---
Lol. I once killed a guy at black salamanders bc I didn‚Äôt feel like hopping worlds.
---
Roughly what year did this mini game come out I played awhile back but don‚Äôt remember this
---
&gt; dragon blowpipe
---
hook me up with that g
---
Christ you people are fucking toxic as hell. Go get some fresh air or something.
---
it's obviously a first person perspective from the early game player.
---
Wow 83 Runecrafting
---
If you're buying less than a few hundred mill hardly matters, but when you start buying more, no, you don't want to buy on a level 3.  You want to buy on a real account.
---
Very much so.
---
You forgot the step where you talk major shit afterwards. Telling them to "sit" and being toxic about it.
---
When you asked if he needed someone to talk to that probably hit him too hard lolol.
---
God i'd pay a lot to be able to fist guthix
---
That's probably what happened. I'm just playing devil's advocate since 90% of this sub automatically sides with the OP regardless of the scenario or even of the OP is at fault.
---
There are tons of ways to make him look innocent here (re: not even showing the entire chat).
---
I mean it shows an instant dc that wasn't internet related or 6hour login related. It was proof of nothing I know but very very suspicious, feel free to watch me try and login then afk on login screen for 30mins trying to recover. Btw I'm still trying to recover.
---
Unfortunately It's literally impossible for me to 'prove' anything. I understand it doesn't look good. I just want to get jagex's attention so somebody can help me login to my account... They can obviously track where the items have gone and what IP logged in ect to prove my innocence in that sense... I just want to get onto my account so I don't look straight back into a darker place. I love this game, I seek no financial benefit from it.
---
Nothing I can say here, I'm sorry.
---
I want it to say "The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles"
---
In terms of self-inflicted suffering causing people to burn out and quit, I don't think there is anything even close to maintaining EHP rates. That shit is brutal.
---
Good to know for when I hit Kraken in 2 years. Lol.
---
Then oopsy-doops. I'm a skiller, I'll always have the option to invest some AFK time in making some money. It's not a big deal to me if an item I have suddenly drops.
---
Got mines after 1k tokens on separate occasions.
---
strong possibility kawolski.  just to be sure let me ask our new rook on the force. Kidbot 9000.. run the numbers I want to plug in and get to the bottom of it.
---
Fletching is pretty decent and very easy to set up- not the best money though, but definitely not bad. Fletching magic longbows makes the most money and is pretty afk.
---
Did you delete the thread or did it get removed?
---
Those people you mentioned, are called chads.
---
bc they didn't release any content for scythe after it came into the game so it dropped? they release tbow content every month but none for scythe so it sits at 600m
---
That's a good point about the blowpipe.
---
I'm honestly banking on them absolutely nailing the twisted league. I feel like no matter how many guides are watched, and no matter how much someone prepares, the relics will be such game changers that the only strategy made is one that will last for the first 1-3 hours of gameplay. After that.... I feel like the relics will have thrown such a wrench into the mix that any strategy will be out the window. But... in the case this isn't completely true... ill be making a short walkthrough guide (will likely be useless), and a long masterclass video about all the areas, items, and important bullet-points about Zeah. I doubt those will be changed by relics.

So you can‚Äôt actually log back in? How do you know your stuff is all gone?
---
Sounds very fishy now dude. 
---
So far it more sounds like it wasn‚Äôt even your account to begin with.
---
I find this comment surprisingly wholesome! Made me giggle. &lt;3
---
Cheap lol? Just not a sheep who follows the rules like all these dumb fucks lol..
---
Rather save money then not.
---
Have you ever thought about trying to farm some vorkath or Sara?   Vorkath makes pretty damn good money, quite easy, just need a bit more range perhaps.    Sara also is pretty easy and not really needed high stats just some range as well.
---
Oh yeah it's definitely more chill to use tbow.
---
Only "dailies" I keep up with are farm runs.
---
I thought it was pretty well known that the people selling gold were doing that, as well as having massive bot farms.
---
I wish they could define botting better. This post is funny because this is not classical botting used by gold companies to farm and sell in game gp but a player ingenuity.
---
&gt; What? I did mention alternatives outside of slayer.
---
I never said you didn't. 
---
It's fine to mention slayer. Just don't make it sound like you have to have slayer to make money. You literally said "you need 80+ slayer and". There's no way to interpret that other than "80+ slayer is required to make decent money with combat." 
---
People have come into this thread and actually asked if they should train slayer so that they don't get laughed at for that skill's level when they have high combat stats. People act like slayer is the only way to play the game.
---
Venmo is huge, it is quite literally changing the banking industry and how people use money. Not that I think OP‚Äôs post is significant, but I‚Äôm surprised people don‚Äôt know what it is in 2019.
---
Honestly, bossing in runescape is a grind.
---
If you want to fuck around for shits and gigs? Anything above 70+ is fine for most bosses.
---
But do you actually want to make money or have a serious chance at getting a drop?
---
Near max combat, with at least 10-50m worth of gear. 
---
If you goal is to get a drop or make money dont think about bossing until your near maxed. There is much much better ways at your stat level to make money other then bossing.
---
Profit per effort lol, I'll have to use that. It's true though, it's certainly the most chill way to Zulrah. And 9way mage switching is the other end of the spectrum.
---
Who the hell plays with sound on in the movies?
---
I'd spend in upwards of 2bil to get a faster 99 RCing. That's what I used to say at least. Then I learned you could actually do that with lava runners and realized I don't want to blow that kind of money for one 99.
---
Their website isn't loading either...
---
TOG and farm runs, fuck the rest.
---
I would like to eventually, if I'm close I can just focus on levelling range. I did quest Vorkath for DS2 but I know the regular boss version is harder. But at least I'm familiar with the mechanics
---
Don't quit. Just use it as a way to improve what you had and how you got it. Utilize the game knowledge you have now and apply it to the next account (if you don't get it back).
---
I actually quit the account that got hacked and made a HCIM. It pushed me into challenging myself with the game. I have only been part of this game for like 5 months, it's a great game. I have been able to use the knowledge I learned actually surpassed my old accounts levels in like 1/3 the time (yay quests).
---
I just started a "main" the other day because I wanted to try my hand at merchanting and such.
---
Hopefully you get it back so you don't have to start over.

Mine's working fine. Have you tried some other websites?

Something tells me you didn't thank me for answering your question.
---
Updooty for smackdown a roony :)
---
I'm in this "powerful casual" group as well. I actually started doing Hespori and Giant Mole recently though. It's gotten me interested in trying out other bosses (that you don't have to prayer flick) sometime soon.
---
&gt; Seaweed and sandstone grinder haven't even increased crafting ehp (unless you tick abuse). 
---
So they have.
---
&gt;Irons only ever ask for QOL but morons like you just shout dumb shit like "you didn't sign up for easyscape".
---
Stop arguing in bad faith if you're going to use any form of communication, it just makes you look like an idiot when you don't know what to say.
---
Jesus Christ man, do you know how quickly you were killing them

Maybe if you did like 5 post its

Idk how prices are now compared to what they were when I did it, but I'm pretty sure I spent less than 20m on both the levels and the materials for house upgrades, maybe 18m

yea, everything else is working fine. Can't get it to work on either my computer or my phone...

Whiskey and cigars are expensive, kids drink beer which tastes like ass and smoke cigarettes which taste like ass.

I usually just get roasted at the GE because no one has ever heard of an alt account and I ended up maxing several buyables before other skills.
---
I consider myself to be this kind of player as well. Have you considered hunting for skilling pets?
---
It is...  citation I know know a guy who bots by clicking the same pixel in NMZ for up to 6 hours at a time. Hes got 3 99s so far from it.

Got like 350kc and my most valuable drop was like 80k in seeds

MTX isn't a separate team; at least not in the way you imply. Partnerships were from marketing, which is a J Mod role in the OSRS Team. IT wasn't from some higher-ups at Jagex or investors trying to milk the game; it was an OSRS thing for the growth of the game.
---
And you are right; they don't have to poll it. At any time someone beyond the OSRS Team or Jagex could say "add MTX" and they'd have to do it. But that has always been the case, so claiming Partnerships is a precursor to more MTX is pointless in that context. As for Jagex's word, it is hit and miss, but so far what they've said about MTX being polled has held up and they have been upfront in their reasons for offering it.
---
Anyway, this whole conspiracy that Jagex is trying to get more MTX into OSRS is baseless. You are completely ignoring all context and just fearmongering, even if the main post was just a meme. The main thing that you, and most the community, seems to ignore for the sake of doom and gloom is that all the MTX offered for OSRS is for the benefit of the game and in the case of partnerships, it was short term loss for long term gain; that is quite the opposite of the typical kind of MTX most would think of when they hear the term MTX. And while that may not make it better or acceptable for players, it does show that the reason it has been offered for OSRS has never been just so they'd make more money; it has always been for things that would grow the game. So claiming that "they offered partnerships, so they'll start selling cosmetics!" is a baseless statement; nothing they've done suggests they'd have a reason to sell cosmetics and if shareholders wanted to milk the game with cosmetic MTX, it doesn't matter what they've done in the past.

While yeah you could buy bonds for about 2.70usd each, the risk connected isn't worth.

Not to mention feeding the parasites that are rwters/bot farms on rs.

What are the easiest skills to 99 f2p?
---
Also what skills are the most useful compared to the effort in f2p?
---
I did read. I made a comment on their clip they are using as evidence.
---
Their "evidence" only shows them being DC'd which happens actually often. I made a comment that if they showed themselves in Lumby with bank drained it would be more believable.
---
At this point it's a "he said, she said".
---
Thanks for your input, I hope they get the account back, as I have said many times.

Good content
