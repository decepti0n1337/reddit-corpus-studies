How about we move you out of the game?
---
Probably referring to the Draynor Manor from the quest, via the boat in Lumbridge Swamp
---
900 hours? What skill are you training?
---
The higher the cb lvl the better the drop rate for shards, weigh that against the ability to kill them quickly and you're basically left with Nechryaels via bursting/chinning. If you're not bursting or chinning then you're best option is going to likely be black demons as they have the highest cb with the lowest requirements to kill while still being able to kill them somewhat quickly.
---
I actually like both of them. Zeah has plenty of low to mid tier content, and putting it in Draynor guarantees f2p noobs will see it. Burying it 3 level down the labyrinth of Port Sarim guarantees it will never be stumbled across.
---
This is true but you don't have to brew to up defence this way. Should be brewing as often as you're rang potting
---
That's not what people at Kraken think. This has happened to me several times today.
---

---
They'll say this was they're world, they were just banking. Or ironically ask why you don't go in the instance instead of themselves. You lose everything if you die in the instance so it's not worth it for Ironmen.
---
But I'm pretty sure there is an exhausted resource sound, at least for mining and woodcutting
---
If it's trivial then why can't it be changed? 
---
In real life plenty of houses have docks
---
Good point. 
---
Oh and btw! This isn't me complaining. I pointed out who the fuck would watch you? Not one complaint there.
---
A complaint would be stop posting this shit. Because 4 year old kill jad

[removed]
---
Why do you think you're entitled to that world?
---
Then there are a few areas where it doesn't exist - such as motherlode mine.

Right, there definitely should be a limit. Where the limit should be is probably impossible to agree on but my take is that the interface should never be an impediment to partaking in the content. I'm thinking of the spellbook situation and how some people were opposed to it because it would make it easier to click on the right spell in combat. Would that really have harmed the experience of existing players? Or would it have just removed some artificial difficulty and made it less likely for people to be turned away by the outdated interface?
---
As for end game PVM stuff, crashing aside, it's not a zero sum game and it's a lot easier (and less tedious since gear isn't lost) to practice PVM than PVP so I don't feel that bad just telling people they need to "get good". Like PVP, I think potential PVMers' issues should be listened to as long as they're reasonable. Again, what's reasonable is open to interpretation and again, I draw the line on the interface getting in the way. The recent Vorkath poll is something that I think would have been a bad change since it would have simply removed a mechanic for no good reason. What needs to be avoided is keeping a bad thing in game simply because it's been like that forever and established players thinking that everyone has to deal with the crap just because they did at one point. I tried to think of one but honestly at the moment I can't come up with an example of something like this in PVM. 
---
In general (and this applies to all aspects of the game), I think the OSRS community has a huge problem with keeping crappy things crappy because removing them "devalues" the player's experience of dealing with the crap and throwing around "EZScape" is often a way to dismiss legitimate suggestions. I want this game to succeed but it feels like Jagex has painted themselves into a corner trying to appease so many different parts of the community while also not "devaluing" things. I will be very surprised if they can find a way forward without seriously pissing off at least one fragment of the community. Sorry to go off on a bit of a tangent, I've just had a lot floating around in my head regarding OSRS lately. 
---
You do you but I fuck them. 
---
Hey, that shortcut was a huge time saver the ten times I used it before I could use the rat pits teleport to get to Port Sarim when I had to glory teleport to Draynor. 
---
Instead, r/2007scape just mocks the opposite opinion with stupid memes.
---
RS3 has a dock in Draynor too bud.
---
shhh he brawn no brain 
---
This port is the most ghetto shit I've ever seen in my life.
---
Because people turn all their herbs into unf potions in one trip. When you are withdrawing all your stacks of herbs it's easy to forget that you should leave the torstols.
---
See, I actually can get behind this. This would be good. 
---
Whats his actual full username
---
Clear voice. Not confusing. No long intro. Great job man.  
---
Wow, It's been so long since I've visited the quest I totally forgot there was an instanced version of draynor manor. This worked thanks!
---
Should be investigated how they can afford it tbh 
---
To be fair that's a problem in almost every mmo to one degree or another.
---
if u can out dps the other person, then u deserve it, plain and simple, hell mod roq supports this, ur competing for resources and such 
---
Everything you see when you come off of tutorial island shouldn't be touched at all. 
---
yeah nah your both definitely over thinking it
---
Making things AFK actually makes me play the game more.
---
so tired of you whiny reddit fucks crying over literally every single update
---
just shut the fuck up
---
Not if you're an Ironman.
---
it wouldnt be doubling the speed, it would be making the speed of picking normal so they could fix the double pick bug
---
Zero death galvek here. Is he suppose to be hard? 
---
Shut up Serene
---
Ahh okay thanks
---
roflman
---
You get 30 days regardless?
---
So because one guy has a personal opinion means it's okay and not a dick move?
---
I agree. I do alot of hard clues. this one iseems to be the oddball. I dont have friends and I hate trying to find someone.
---
Quest remake
---
They can't even develop anything but their slayer bosses/raids updates. QOL features are completely out the window. I doubt we'll see text over drops on OSRS within the next 10 years.

As an aside, in my opinion, you aren’t solely entitled to anything in the game because there’s no “spot check.”  It’s first come first serve.
---
like a fucking dog.
---
They could easily implement some form of Runescape chess
---
Don't know why they haven't tbh.
---
Unplayable
---
I know haha. He has confirmed it. Check the top comment in this picture haha. 
---
People who think polls should be removed clearly don't remember anything from Jagex's history of running Runescape into the ground with shitty, unpopular updates. If anything polling is one of the main things that has prevented OSRS from devolving into RS3-tier shit.
---
I mean theoretically, it should be as simple as finding and replacing the sprite ids per prayer and replacing them with the correct ones. For it to be harder than that would be just unusual.
---
These jagex mods are trigging my autistic nostalgia rage.
---
How dare u change muh childhood
---
mole, sara gwd, dks(range n mage), brutals

I'm sure they're working on it just like how adding someone to your ignore list makes ur chat all fucky
---
Thats pretty cool.
---
Why we no have that osrs team 
---
Just like a real democracy!
---
runcraft slow
---
The reason it wouldn’t have a dock is because the port is literally next to it. Why no have airstrips a block from the airport after all it’s right there. Granted that’s a garbage example but still why move it? Why not just direct people to veos in port sarim? What purpose does it serve to take content that is in a thematically fitting place and move it to somewhere that it doesn’t fit? I cannot think of a single reason it needed to be moved, possibly it was too hard for people to find veos before but still the quest solves that problem by telling you where he is. 
---
still, and no one forced u to play that game  mode, like if i have a task, and im not interested in hopping and i see someone in the spot for my task say dust devils, regardless of whether they r ironman, norm, w.e if i see they arnt using the spot like ur supposed to, i.e bursting/barraging, ima take the spot, does it make me a dick yes, but thats how the game is played, its a game of the strong survive and the snowflakes melt away
---
Yeah, realistically sized maps, where it takes hours to walk between towns, would be pretty stupid and boring.
---
I mean I can agree kind of. I didn't mess with sizings and the transparency is broken too but imo I think it'd look nicer with better sprites
---
Thank god for runelite, wouldn't play the game without it.
---
Are people really autistic enough to make a f2p ironman?
---
Devalues my large ship only UIM.
---
Genuinely curious to know which jmods’ idea this was
---
What he said
---
The Culling has began
---
i didnt say it wasnt a dick move, i just dont care about being a dick
---
Yeah the bludgeon is better by a fair margin, even without counting the higher str bonus it's more accurate than the abby dag. That being said if you want to maximize your rates you should use bludgeon with the abby dag as a spec weapon.
---
Right.. receiving and implementing suggestions from the subreddit is one thing but expecting them to run all their ideas by *us* first? Haha dude, I would blame them for quitting their jobs.
---
Literally unplayable rn. Finally some good sense
---
No one has the right to any world. It’s free for all. If you can out DPS them then they’ll have to leave. Even if a person was at bank 
---
September hurts me
---
I would say that charters were not originally poor game design because previously hopping and buying from shops was not viable with the hop timer (which was poor game design). I do agree that moving away from shopscape is a good thing, so I would support changes that offer an ironman crafting method that is competitive with charters.
---
That being said, it really feels like a lot of ironman players are campaigning for crafting buffs not so much due to fundamental design flaws, but because they 1) want crafting to be faster overall or 2) don't want to engage in a 0 exp activity such as collecting sand. I think the notion that every activity needs to give exp is misguided, especially when the activity in question is part of larger process that does provide decent exp. Ironman mode is all about being self-sufficient and personally I think that comes with the reasonable assumption that you will have to go out of your way to grind some not-so-rewarding things to reach your ultimate goal.
---
I ask because it's no harm to do so, but frankly it's their world now and I'll hop if they want to keep it.
---
Here's to hoping less people go toxic apeshit over this, though.
---
Laughed my ass off, thanks
---
How do people play that much? I work full time and I barely have time.
---
Nice alt
---
Sorry, devalues my alcoholic ironman acc
---
Did the whole thing on my alt 70 rNge with 9 brews 2 rpot 1 stamina 18 brews. Used karils crossbow, as for the blowpipe i’d just use adamant darts. 2k scales/darts is more tha enough. Don’t forget to use your blowpipe spec to heal up.
---
So the bug should be removed why would we just buff something to mimic a bug
---
TIL there are RS novels and I want to buy them all. 
---
Thanks
---
I very much like the sandstorm idea. Obviously it makes getting sand easier for ironman, but I don't think that is bad. We still have to get seaweed and superglass make everything, then the actual blowing. Exp rates for glassblowing are not insane by any means, they are just solid so it is not like this is busted op or anything. It just streamlines an extremely tedious process into something more manageable.
---
I'm always down for new content creators. But by the looks of all your thumbnails I have zero desire to give you a chance. Dont be baity and basic man. When I see those I think this person just wants easy views and thats it. Makes me feel like a robot sucking in all the bs so I don't watch them. Good luck man 
---
They literally polled removing a single pixel from the game. 
---
This was a dumb update and absolutely should’ve been polled. 
---
Do you think this would work with Black Demons and Bouncer?
---
My setup is the standard rumble hard demons setup from years ago.
---
Bank tags.
---
Bank management is absolute shit if you vary the content you do much. Bank tags/tabs make remembering and gearing for content so much smoother.
---
I second this
---
I like to think that both are right, in a wierd, fucked up sort of way.
---
Died at winterdaddy at 93 firemaking to DC. I was 7hp, by the time I could reconnect I was 1hp. Right as I ate I got hit and died. Dont wanna restart, but the car crash death is accurate as fuck.
---
Because it thematically makes sense. They drop seaweed spores, why not ash as well?
---
Looks like a lot of Netflix was watched
---
No a few weeks of grinding. It's not that easy
---
Yup, it was simply too much. I think we had the most traffic ever on this sub in that week. Personally, I believe other subs (of certain political attitudes) united and raided us.
---
"Most stupidest"... Really?
---
No shit Sherlock, here's the thing though, in a renaissance period the farms were often kept away from civilization as farm folk were discriminated against. Add that to the fact that very few breweries (less than 1%) grow their own materials for their brews and it makes no sense for it to be there. Hell, very few pubs even brew their own product, it's sent to them, they just resell it.
---
Best part is all my slay and pvm was pretty much prior to max literally all I do now is pk
---
Would be interesting, although current uim rely on deaths to bank.
---
The Meta would just be different
---
The law of large numbers says lots of people will get it but you wont.
---
Would be down for this, getting to Zeah currently is quite the trek to back corner of Port Sarim (well not currently anymore past)
---
This is an improvement but I could see why people wouldn't be happy with it as it doesn't make alot of sense.
---
LOL

Nice bridge over there

I've killed 2 and gotten 0 shards.

We're both at a 0% drop rate, so it's basically the same.

I want to have penguin hunting in osrs so I can right click the penguin that is disguised as a bush. It says "spy-on bush" and then I can screenshot it and post for karma.

Where is the stampot bridge? Please sir

What they been asking for? 
---
If they look you up and find out you're a normal account, chances are they don't want to waste supplies competing.

Excellent first color choice.

Just because you die at galvek doesn't mean you're bad though

I personally had lots of dead clicks at the tsunamis, and if you just pray mage the entire fight you get literally raped by his range attacks.

When a player spends 100’s of hours on their account trying to better their character and have done no harm to anyone, then there is no honor in pk’ing the adventurer. It ruins the HC status and point of the account. 
---
Look, I get it. The wilderness is a free for all and you certainly can kill any other player if you wish. There is technically nothing morally wrong with killing another player in the wilderness. But because of this lack of morality, their is a chance to feel honorable. To do the kind thing when the situation arises, such as a hardcore Ironman, is a superior move. You can look down at the peasant from a greater height.

Use a sang staff and you dont even need food

its not that serious bro

I remember the post complaining about the dig site one having thousands of upvotes

So you're saying there's a chance
---
Excuse the shoddy edit, but I think this gets the idea across pretty well. The Sheared would stay where it is, but using the previous house's layout. Even the doors are in the same place - one being the entrance to the pub, and the other for the Bartender.
---
I haven't edited Veos in, but he'd be stood either in the Pub, or in the little sheltered area outside. Potentially, they could add a ladder to an upper floor / cellar that replicates the beds, table, painting, etc, room from the room in the old version of the house.
---
I mean its not that hard to hire the 3rd party client dev for their own team.
---
Keep the obby armor, ditch the b neck for a fury, and rock the whip + defender.
---
Main reason being even though the obsidian armor effect is good, it won't out do the high stat bonuses of the whip + defender.
---
The whip will be significantly more accurate.
---
Are you from Al Kharid? 
---
Ill assume you ignored the other reply to you? You think a everyone is welcome to take pride in themselves event in a MMORPG doesn't fit but giant rabbits , monsters, and santa claus all have a place just like back in the day?

Imagine failing the last one and watching your character swim all the way back home, realizing that your character had the endurance to swim across the whole God damn ocean the entire time 
---
&gt; more powerful than the average player their combat lvl
---
The issue with this statement is that it's entire premise is based on a different era. The average player at a pure's combat level now *are* other pures. There are no mains pking anymore at the 1-82 combat level, and everything beyond that is dominated by zerkers and 60 atk piety builds. 
---
I would ordinarily agree with you if this was 2007, but there aren't noobs in the wilderness anymore. Also, if you start going past 1-10 wild, you are already in the berserker pure range, which is MUCH more powerful than a 1 def pure. 
---
This. I could back this. 
---
I've got about 1.5mil in mole claws &amp; skins. I know you can trade them into the gardener for seeds, but is that what people generally do? Why would I want to trade them in when I can just sell for cash?

Ah okay brilliant, cheers for the advice!

You know absolutely nothing about the event and don’t want it in the game because it’s “out of place”??
---
Yeah absolutely no homophobia there at all
---
You sound like the rest of the homophobes who wanted the event gone 
---
But why
---
No, it's still a snare, your account is just bad and you have no reason to be complaining about anything 
---
While most people wouldn't waste runes for petty kills I still don't understand your reasoning.
---
1. Log into PvP world, agreeing to PvP mechanics
---
2. Decide to skill with minimal risk to for access to empty MLM
---
3. Get attacked by someone clearing out MLM in a PvP world
---
4. Complain that the PvP world is being used for PvP
---
5. ?????
---
6. Decide to not PvP, but instead spite vote no to all PvP updates further contributing to the problem
---
I'm 78 atk, 72 str, 75 hp.  Dharoks or sara sword?  Don't want to whip because need str exp.
---
Baby Pure implies a specific build and purpose. It's a faster way to say "a pure with 50-60 atk, that can TB, range and has overheads at a low level."
---
The term is used quite often in the pure &amp; PvP community. A lot of things might seem unnecessary if you're not involved in the community in which it's used.
---
There are plenty of things that just straight require an agility level. Your making few seem like all.
---
I think that crosses the line. In general changes involving automated processes don’t seem old school to me except for exampl the watering cans that’s QoL. I’d afk clean herbs to 99 at 0 cost doesn’t sound right to me

I wouldn't mind at least having the option, in a world where resource limitations are no issue, but it's just not practical. It would never pass a poll without a toggle, and if it did, then every future update suddenly requires twice the amount of graphical work--not to mention the amount of dev time this update would eat in the first place.

Thanks Charlie

Are you implying we aren't?

Am i the only one happy with this addition ?

You still didn’t answer my initial question, why don’t you want it in game? 
---
And homophobia is not defined as a fear of gay people, it’s a prejudice against them. 
---
It only seems that way because you are probably only experiencing it from the perspective of the skiller or pvmer. Pkers target pkers too, but how would you know that if you don’t pk?

AUGH. BLEGH. THAT'S- Mmmm? Oh. AUGH BLECH THAT'S THE WORST 
---
The regular drop table is meh, pretty much only worth doing for the atlas seeds, the bottomless bucket (which seems to be a fairly reasonable drop rate) and chance at farming pet. For how quick the boss is, the table seems fine IMO.
---
if you look at making a tele tab, that menu would be much better
---
100% agree - I actually saw it and went “that’s a cool update”. Came to the comments and apparently everyone hates it. 
---
Negative upvotes say otherwise
---
You forgot winter 2017
---
I like the volcanic ash idea. When it comes to bots, I’ve always thought it would be a good area to make some occasional interaction between the volcano exploding/spewing chunks of something in random areas to damage or stop an interaction that could make bottling more difficult. Don’t know how you’d do it exactly but wouldn’t seem out of place

It's fine, people just want something to complain about

You seriously get pissed off about people using puzzle solver? fuck me people use it in rs3 too no one gives a shit over there. What kind of major advantage does someone have being able to solve a puzzle faster? aside from not having to open up chrome and look at a guide.

Please Jagex add in an option to sail from Draynor to Port Siram

Stick it on that tiny island with the fairy ring and lock zeah behind fairy tale pt 2

Im honestly surprised this isn't already in the game. Pouch plant.

He has none just seems angry that you are correct

"Before I got 25 construction" that took what, 100k and 30 minutes?
---
I'm fine with the lumby change, but the draynor one is stupid.  And I don't mean the update, I mean the whole porcess.  Why does Draynor have a dock when it's next to a literal port?  The port where it used to be?  This is nonsensical.  Also, draynor willows are a nostalgic area for many, and now you get to stare at a ship instead of a tranquil seascape.

0 experience in the osrs dev team or their working environment (It's theoretically been said to be an Agile Methodology so should be just something to add to their agile board)
---
Theoretically though from the way the client currently displays it doesn't appear to be anything too complicated in the way it's displayed. At the end of the day it's just Java. However it could be spaghetti code from what the rumor mill says about OSRSs old code.
---
P.s, They do it with Slayer so essentially it'd be doing like what they did with slayer which iirc is creating fake items that look like the monsters to then get a skill menu working.
---
If third party clients are able to manage this type of project, a company the size of Jagex should also be able to manage a project that size. OSB even showed that it can be very profitable if ran with more of a business / private ownership mindset.
---
Rather than having a boat out in the distance, couldn't the boat just be used to get the player and Veos to Port Sarim to take the boat from there to Kourend?
---
This confirms nothing, it just confuses me more the longer I stare.

You have no comprehension of what mmo means and are not worth an argument as you have no point.

Is it realistic to do mage arena 2 with 75 mage, 70 def, 72 hp, 77 pray and augury?

For real. Browse any thedonald-type sub for five minutes and it's obvious the people most in need of a "snowflake safe space" are the ones who use that term.

Wait... What?

overall i wouldn't mind the option to toggle it. 
---
I personally agree with the people that say it looks out of place but if this is a serious issue in some peoples lives then they need to seriously reevaluate where they are and what they're doing with their lives.
---
Ya true. I hate how no1 hangs out in clan wars and castle wars anymore

Woah has mobile really been out for that long already?
---
It is possible but not really until very high range. Use dragon darts, yeah, but just keep trying. You’ll get it.

This entire sub is obsessed with an autistic video series. What are you on about?

For runbacks ya,  but while leveling autorunning in vanilla = ded. 
---
For rs instead of autorun (have it to a degree),  increased view distance would be more helpful. 
---
Bar only ironwoman

?
---
And we push the dock into the Stam pot bridge?
---
If you had other good stuff like rigour, high range lvl and good gear then probably yeah. Runelite helped me a ton with killing jad, got it first try
---
Pub? Whatever. That ugly ass different color wood dock put right next to a port but not connected to it? Come on now
---
&gt; This is just moving goalposts. It’s not politically charged, it’s not a fight for gay marriage it’s a holiday celebrating being proud of being gay when it’s been something extremely difficult to be in the past. 
---
Why should development time and game events be committed to this? 
---
&gt; How would you feel about them throwing in an event for black history month? Or what about a Hanukkah event? Eid, Ramadan? 
---
I don't want any of these events in the game. If the developers really want to implement it, they can poll it.
---
&gt; Let me know your honest opinion on those. If you’re gonna fell me that not enough blacks, Jews or Muslims play the game to justify these events just because the game is probably predominantly western white males then you genuinely do have a prejudice. Why should most minority groups that also enjoy the game not get their own celebrations included? 
---
Game events shouldn't be created to accommodate every single minority group. This would be a illogical use of development time and frequent events would change their nature.
---
Development time is not unlimited and I am personally a fan of infrequent events. I am far more content with the current celebrations that can be widely supported by Westerners of any ethnicity and sexual orientation.

Which is possibly the best argument for Jagex hiring the runelite devs and turning runelite into the official client while banning the use of 3rd party clients.

Yes this is perfect!

You had to go through tutorial island a few times, even on the same account. Ie when starting osrs with your rs2/rs3/rsc account. 
---
It’s two small changes to Lumbridge and Draynor. It’s not like they removed the Draynor market or the willow trees, or the Lumbridge goblins.
---
To be fair, the Gower brothers did have a high focus on expandability... technology just wasn't as advanced when the original engine code and other codes were written.
---
Why is it so unrealistic for a village surrounded by water to have its own port lol? It makes sense thematically.

I’m sorry but this is impractical, could you imagine the animation for the short cut through the swamp? Come on man thing of my phone

What did they change? 
---
Thanks for this, appreciate it. 
---
Some ppl can be into that man. Dont ruin it for them.

Honest question, are you knowledgeable about software? Jagex didn't write the code for 3rd party clients. They can't run anti-cheat code inside a client they didn't code.

Shouldn't I first get the ACB and then the Rigour for Vorkath? Or is the Rigour more important and a more significant upgrade than uprading the rcb to acb for using the diamond/ruby dragon bolts?

Is anything actually going to happen with 9/11 then? Seems plenty of Americans at the very least know the official story isn't true. Everyone happy enough to give up on getting justice? They did kill about 3000 US citizens then sent young men off to a war - that's still going on.

Pretty much just normal BiS melee gear with chest and legs substituted for proselyte, don't forget a blessing. It's only really useful for melee tasks, but it's very good for conserving prayer in situations where you need one overhead the whole time. 6-8 prayer potions will last nearly every task, plus a few super combat potions or super sets.
---
For ranged, I'd still wear god dhide top and bottom for the accuracy, even if you need to keep prayer on the whole time. Ditto for mage w/ your best mage gear.
---
Did it work?
---
While it doesnt really save "to" much time from having to go back and get a new task, they probably wouldnt want you to be able to double stack on certain tasks. 
---
The only way id see something like this pass would be 1) a huge point unlock to be able to use it and 2) if you tried to cancel the 2nd task to get a better one it would cancel both. That way you wouldnt be able to easily stack up on the juicy tasks. 
---
I know it may not seem like a huge advantage but its more so due to having access to the slayer helm buff where you can get better exp/kill stuff easier. So they wouldnt want you to be able to take advantage of that on a huge task of a "good" task. Though you could make it so you cant have the same task, and then do it like my 2nd step where if you cancel the second it cancels both. I dont see much harm with that.

I play on my mid level ironman so it's a little different what I do everyday. Right now I'm starting the barrows grind

60m is plenty. Test it out on some combat items (blowpipe, wards, bucklers, dragon xbows, high level potions, etc) and once you find a decent margin 3-5% buy the buy limit at a little over the low price and sell a little under the high price. 60m flipped should net you a few million pretty easily 
---
Use the Cook servant (16 items). You can build 4-5 mounts in the time it takes her to come back (17 seconds). It's cheaper by half (since you're also getting less planks) and you don't have to worry about having too many planks.

It's blowpipe or DHCB for vorkath. There's really no inbetween. If you plan to camp it for a long time I can definitely recommend selling some stuff off to afford both rigour + dhcb and camp it to 99 range or somethin, but only if you plan to camp it for 1k+ kills otherwise just use blowpipe.
---
Jagex never asked Runelite to remove the left-click use option for bones, so I don't see why that's relevant. Blaming Runelite itself for people developing their own plugins also makes no sense. It isn't laymen developing these plugins, it's people with dev experience making them to sell. People have been developing similar plugins and scripts for actual botting clients basically since the game existed.
---
ACB is not good at vorkath. Buy rigour and use a blowpipe with BGS to spec.

😂😂

Yes thank you! Also had never used my free week so that's awesome lol.

I just binged all ten. It was better than Breaking Bad. Can't wait for the yellow cape arc.

It just looks terrible and doesn't make sense.  Why would someone build a little pier in shallow water for an inter-continental voyage when an industrial port is sitting right next to it.  I understand the Dev Team's point that port Sarim is currently messy and cluttered, but the solution should be to un-clutter it, not to clutter up other towns.

This is the absolute worst way to deal with any societal problem. What you call "blending in" is erasure. Why the fuck should minorities have to "blend in" just to not be harassed and discriminated against? "Blending in" isn't going to stop the rates of violence LGBT people face, nor is it going to lower the rates of suicide or homelessness.

Thats cause ur agility sucked, so it took forever to travel

FYI, it wasn't a gay pride event, it was an "love yourself for who you are" event. Homesexuality was never mentioned, there were no gay NPCs or anything.

Your combat level is based on the highest of (attack+strength), ranged*1.5 or magic*1.5. So if you have 70 attack and strength, you would need 94 ranged or magic to have those affect your combat level. So yes, training melee skills is the way to go.

Cor blimme mate what r u doing in me pockets?

You don't even know why that happened. It had nothing to do with jagex wanting to remove pvp...

The pub imo isn't a big deal, I just wish they put it somewhere else like another post pointed it just North of the furnace because there's REALLY no reason for it to have replaced another building.
---
The dock in Draynor? I think you can use it to actually get to Zeah now which makes it nice that a glory brings you right beside it, but holy fuck it's an absolute unit. They could've just kept it at the same spot at Port Sarim and maybe just made part of the quest reward something along the lines of a faster transport method to the boat or just Port Sarim itself. Could even maybe make it something you could attach to the Xeric's Amulet when you obtain one to unlock a teleport to Veos potentially. 
---
A lot of people have said it should be off of the Wizard's Tower and while I wish I could agree on that, that'd be even worse imo. Sure the Wizard's Tower is less commonly visited, but it'd just look ridiculous since it's essentially a round island tied to the mainland by a large bridge. I'd ra

Still need the thousands of hours for seaweed growing and furnace use and glass blowing. And this stone could just be removed...

Your videos make me very happy. I look forward to each video you put out. Usually RS videos can get boring but something about your genuine love for the game makes me check my feed for a new vid. Also I love your voice. Perfect for videos. Very relaxing.

It might be my Runelite settings, I have the graphical enhancements enabled. It definitely is really out of place though.

personally don't care at all about the house, that dock is ugly, and I don't see why it can go in the giant port with boats for basically everything you would want a boat for, particularly at low levels.

I honestly think people were just karma whoring. It was basically "look at me I'm a veteran player and these places mean a lot to meee boohoo!" and basically a chance to shit on Jagex (and I'm not some Jagex fanboy, I bash them all the time when they deserve it).

Not EVERY aspect of a new update has to be polled, otherwise, a lot of good stuff that we have today wouldn't have passed.

The Veos location in Port Sarim was bad. When I was starting out in OSRS, it felt like bad placement to me. Port Sarim is already overcrowded and not to mention it's not exactly the most accessible place to new players, especially since he was all the way down on the southern dock. Doing Zeah quests as a newb was annoying.

Swamplwtics is the username of his Ironman account that he restricted to Morytania. With a few rules, if there’s something he needs to do that will unlock a majority of content for Morytania then he has fans vote to have him do it outside of Morytania. So if he needs a certain herb or item he finds which monsters drop it and he kills them until he gets it. if he can’t make it or buy it. It’s really cool seeing how he thinks his way around the restrictions.

I’ll message you

Yeah, and once you beat him you will never fear him again lol, but I was shook the first 3 times.

Yeah. Thats why I think they are actually really good practice for players who are newly getting into bossing :) another thing they're great for is resource management. I dont bring a spec weapon tbh - I cant afford a SGS or dwh or anything like that so instead i use the blowpipe spec. And it's decent actually to get some health back when using it against dawn. 
---
Basically they arent hard to kill, but they are awesome for practicing certain viable mechanics and also killing them efficiently. I can only do 5 or 6 per trip, i usually have to eat 2 times during a fight. Sometimes i can do it with only needing to eat once it just depends if the melee hits me during the last phase at all (I just pray range i dont because usually the melee doesnt really hurt much if it does hit). 
---
I did manage though to where I usually only eat one food until the 3rd phase and youre just soloing dusk. So then it just depends if his melee hits me or not. Still trying to do better though :)

Get fighter torso from barb assault, then just use obby legs until you have 40m for Bandos tassies, do fre isles for nez helm for off task, berserk ring (i), fury, dragon boots, and focus on qp for barrows gloves. It takes a while to get enough to get them but the str bonus they give is no joke.

Yea I think this puts into words the reason that there's a  bigger fuss about Draynor than Lumby. Another thing I feel is that the new art direction is fitting and cool in a place like Zeah, for example, but fits in poorly with the older feel of Draynor.

---
Like all those protests for the WWF events. Oh wait...
---
So what? This is an English game with an international playerbase
---
I mean yea, but at the same time I'm a little salty yk? But I gotta admit it was a good string of responses
---
I never said it wasn't. At least in the US black Americans can't track their national ancestry. So they're forced to identify as black, where as white Americans know their heritage. There's quite a difference. A polish pride? Sure. British? Cool. Italian, German, Welsh, whatever. Awesome. White? It's different 
---
Can you go confirm that your 2FA is still active? Try logging in on a new device or going to Runescape site &gt; Account settings
---
Took me 1100 to get a zenyte so I feel your pain killed 400 since and no second zenyte
---
Cuz people are fuckin batshit insane and being slightly different is now a "political" stance to a lot of easily offended Christians or whatever. There are two events dedicated to the religion of Christianity in the game but nobody is bitching about those being political. Watching them try to defend that is hilarious you should try it some time. 
---
I know which one is right, but I’m not telling because none of you showed up to see my band!
---
Doubt it, it'll likely be in july
---
I wouldn't be for a racial pride thing anyway. Its inherently shitty, national cultural pride is different is all im saying.
---
Yea, I made sure to confirm that since I got a new phone and I thought that might have been the problem. It's still on, so I emailed them. Ik my stuff isnt retrievable by now so I'm accepting it a bit more
---
This but no joke. I used to stand there for house asking anyone who came in to leave 
---
Some of you guys are alright, dont go to draynor tomorrow
---
Says the one jizzing over every vid of that dude. You’re all bunch of beta sluts. Don’t follow one man, become a man, you sheep
---
Just like with bone whip.  Damn whiners
---
The standard “put phone in front of my face because I’m ugly but not entirely my face so I can still show guys that I’m a girl” picture 
---
some of the seed drops are worth a ton.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Makes it sound like you'd be fine with MTX.
---
Don't try to twist my words.
---
Q
---
The KQ’s one has some sick “YEAHHHHHH” shades going on
---
I never stop drinking irl so won’t be much different for me tbh 
---
Its worth pointing out that melee is also considerably slower to train, and you have to train two skills. Chinning to 80 or so ranged is probably faster than training attack and strength to 60.
---
Chopping willows and dropping logs is actually decent XP/hr that can be obtained on f2p.
---
Yeah but what about a bridge made out of lightbulbs 
---
I know right. Still confuses me why are there so many people jizzing over literally every single video of that guy watching a pixel change color . This isn’t the future I was hoping for 
---
Indeed, brother. Indeed. 
---
Yeah jagex needs to get on this shit their player base is mostly in their 20s
---
no you need 4. 3 to change it and one to sit around saying no I like stayig in the dark.
---
That's latios
---
Because bot clients operate outside of the law. OSbuddy and RuneLite are legit operations and don't want to lose their status as legitimate programs. 
---
You never know man. It’s been around for a pretty damn long time now and is even outperforming WoW at this point from what I’ve seen. It’s one of the last true mmorpgs that doesn’t just hold your hand or start you off extremely overpowered. The game is special. People still play monopoly ya know? Obviously not an exact parallel but the point is that games can be timeless in some cases.
---
Is veracs skirt better than obby legs? and should i get primordial boots or amulet of torture first?
---
Guy: you sad FUCK lOl virgin for life. Girl: good for you be yourself!!!1111 ur bewtiful
---
&gt;Obviously there was a gay connection, but it was never explicitly created
---
Yes it's different but fairness and human decency should tell you everyone has the right to be proud of their heritage and to express that pride. 
---
It’s just a meme I doubt the people making these really care that much lol. This shits funny as fuck though you gotta admit
---
And when it does break the integrity of the game then Jagex says something about it. This has happened many times in the past. Eg Zulrah helper, farming tracker, clicking past vanilla render distance, etc
---
The USA is a clusterfuck of ethnic groups and all combinations, and a shitton of the issues that follow. 
---
Only difference is white is nonspecific, naming european country is just more specific..
---
Really?
---
draynor is not a city
---
 Imagine with the birds were thinking that we're living in the trees on the edge of the water. L o l
---
If anyone has ideas for herblore, fletching, and crafting that isn't bank stand I would love to hear it btw
---
IDK as a parody I find it pretty funny
---
That’s a work of art right there
---
&gt; I’m Gay, tired of that old dieing trend people use for brownie points acting like anyone who isn’t jumping for joy at battles we won years ago is a “x”.
---
It's not looking for brownie points, and it's not a battle that's been won at all. being gay you should understand how it feels to be underrepresented/unwelcome in a community, especially one like osrs which is full of bigots. The point of the festival event was that, to help people feel welcome in the game who are underrepresented.
---
&gt;jagex look at my life
---
Torture first 
---
You say the clue box doesn't give any reward
---
.. that's not really true. The reward is you get to keep your clue.
---
Also, if you just wear dhide and bring brews, it's laughably easy to escape pkers.
---
You claim the ability to mitigate your risk is skewed, but I'm willing to bet that you just don't understand how to save yourself, even though there are plenty of ways. 
---
Beglieve
---
It was so obvious that it was basically stated 
---
Charging glorys is like 2m/hr
---
Woah
---
What’s good about watching a guy make a pixel change color. :/
---
The streamer you dipshit
---
🤦🏼‍♂️
---
Quality trap tbh, got me unawares
---
So I currently at 54 hunter, how many birdhouses can I have at one time?
---
It's supposed to be Barrows not Barpile.
---
The cooking range in that house is actually a giant stew pot over a fire. I used to use it to get better flavour.. used to... 
---
Is there any way he can boost?
---
Whip, fury, torso, Verac skirt. 
---
If no torso, grab Torag platebody. 
---
Pogletics 
---
Players: Pass a poll for a new player quest
---
Mods: Adds content related to quest in new player areas

or just a script for a bot client

I'm pretty sure runelite doesn't have enough api access to change your prayers
---
Remember when those Bug Abusers completed everyone’s childhood dream, and literally literally picked up the party hat out of the cut scene with a PAFT

I see a purple cape... am i color blind?

or sitting on it. ;)
---
He's in draynor now.
---
Also &gt;Jerry rig
---
Benis :——DDDD
---
This is such a pointless post given that clue boxes exist. Jamflex already gave you ezscape with a clue box and now you want ezscape^2. 
---
3 item, clue box, drop your clue, drop your items, don’t do a wildy clue, black d’hide + dinhs + proper combo food, ttl worlds or PvP worlds. It’s really not that hard to keep your clue or to avoid pkers. It just takes effort and some prior planning. 
---
What font is that on the map?
---
My dude you have more dedication than lynx titan, it's heartwarming 
---
From 0 to 60 fps? Mate do you use explorer? Update to mozilla might help with your problem 
---
No, there's a difference between race and ethnicity. 
---
So now it's settled 
---
Yep *checks list* 
---
Never
---
Cool
---
Like February
---
why censor the compost bin?
---
As long as you don't use them to get an edge on any competitive game mode, you can have as many as you want
---
Could always put a canoe tree on the shore that you have to cut and sail to Port Sarim to see Veos 
---
to be fair settled definitely deserves some slob on his knob, and you can provide that
---
9 shitty then 10th as best
---
I hear they have educational institutions for that
---
Lol no I don’t do that. But I won’t argue that he does. 
---
Get torso
---
And it'll only serve one specialty drink called X marks the spot
---
Not after seeing the 10th post about it
---
I just miss my lil noob house I trained in all my childhood
---
Gives me the feeling you'll be 10000 oi5 sucks off buy
---
&gt;a) literally anything can be a slippery slope
---
I mean I dont disagree, but if we are going down a slippery slope let it be at the players discretion, not the devs. See the difference? It matters what the cause is. Just because an outcome is the same does not mean the means of getting there is irrelevant.
---
&gt;b) Lumbridge already has water travel from WCing
---
Yes I know but you're pretending I did not say a whole port. If you think a whole port would not be out of place you're being way too dismissive.
---
&gt;c) if your entire argument is "THEY COULD MAYBE MAKE THE GAME WORSE IN THE FUTURE" then you have trust issues and should stop playing video games entirely, or at least games that continue to receive updates, because otherwise you're going to die of a stress induced stroke from shitting yourself in terror over tiny changes
---
Or you know, Im justified at having trust issues with this particular development company after what they did the first time with this game. You seem to be confused and think I am afraid of change in general. I am afraid of change made by the devs without player consent when that was a fundamental part of bringing osrs back.
---
&gt;d) they were polled, they are part of the quest. Was every square inch and minor detail of Zeah polled? No, it fucking wasn't.
---
That's the same justification you could use with bill riders in legislation. "Well we included it in the bill that you mostly liked, and you agreed to it right?" Just because people were ok with a quest does not mean they get to do literally anything pertaining to that quest. You also seem to be straw manning me saying " Was every square inch and minor detail of Zeah polled?". Am I saying they need to poll every minor detail of a quest? no. Thats your own opinion that you are enforcing as some sort of logic, because to some of us this was not a minor detail. When this company polls shit like a single pixel on an item you are fucking insane to think that they didnt realize this wasnt a minor detail so dont try to claim that they cant play semantics about "what is and isnt a minor detail". It is more than obvious with precedent this isnt a minor detail so stop pretending it is.
---
Dont understand how they "butchered" the town by adding a boat that looks like every other boat in the game...
---
Mommy.. how does the helmet stay on?
---
Mentioning that RS3 did it only decreases the chances of it happening.
---
Id prefer that over the scam bs that is the ge everytime you go there.
---
How do you have time to imbue all of them
---
Shit didn't notice last 1 was multiplication so it's 20
---
Buy one from ge ? 
---
IT IS A TRANSITORY PHASE. JUST WAIT FOR BARROWS ARC.
---
Gnome Balls Falls 😂😂😂
---
I know this is difficult to hear because it's so easy to say while hard to do but just keep trying.  
---
  
---
The main thing to remember is that Jad's attacks come slower than you think. I believe I watched Boaty do it a few months ago and the way he kind of talks through it shows that there really is more time than you think to do the switches.  
---
It took me like 10 tries to get it and now I'm 3 kills in and did it in like 45 minutes last night with plenty of supplies to spare.  
---
During Jad, don't worry about Jad's health. I will do a pray switch, move my player, do another pray switch, then either try to attack a healer or move again to get in better position. Even if it takes 5 minutes to get the healers attention, as long as you're still alive, you can kill Jad
---
Suggestion: move the nature altar next to the grand exchange. 😤👌🏼
---
And by that I means 30, 000 shamans  minimum for dwh
---
What the fuck is wrong with yall lmao
---
That pub kinda lessens the initial nostalgia for returning players imo
---
Go to a total world
---
LMAO uses plank make instead just buying them off the GE
---
This could be your first time, c'mon.
---
Minigame that gives runecrafting exp
---
Oh yeah def haha i get what you mean. It does make sense if i dont take damage from his melee during the phases when both are out attacking :) ill give it a shot though! Not sure how much it would speed up for me though, so it may be worth me keeping that inven spot for food instead. :) 
---
I may try it with a lot more brews next time instead that way i can go for a longer trip. Never really dawned on me lol. Brews are so cheap now too. 
---
Btw off topic but any idea why whips are taking a crash? 2.5m now but they were steady 3m for a while i thought? 
---
Lol this isn’t lumbridge this is every town in Wisconsin 
---
sorry, should have added, I am an Ironman
---
Omg this
---
Yikes
---
Why is it always the same handful of people and why do they always leave when you try to have a real fight? Stop trying to make it out like it's anything other then them wasting the time of people who are mining because they can. There is nothing to be gained killing defenseless people who don't fight back with no items of value to be gained. 
---
I realize that phrasing was indeed “most stupidest” but I was typing fast and just wanted to relay my anger as quickly as possible. That was not the only phrasing or grammatical error in my comment hahaha. 
---
Swampletics
---
I thought back then that it was a f2p look into a  members only quest lol.
---
It's a small f2p quest calm your fucking man-boobs holy shit.
---
And none of them approve of same sex marriage. Why having a non religious "marriage" is necessary..

A picture of the rot client was leaked a week ago but the post got deleted by the reddit mods. https://i.imgur.com/thARnsX.png

The auto attack feature attacks whoever their leader Sfa attacks. No wonder rot always wins their fights. They are literally botting.

---
Ooohhh okay. 
---
Someones grumpy this evening. 
---
I could care less about the pub but this is good
---
Cant do Bounty hunter that's forsure. 
---
What is "it"?
---
Sounds like the ones you drop, will still be visible to you, but ones that others drop will be invisible to you. 
---
You're acting like they made changes purely because "lol let's change things in Lumby and Draynor to piss off our players, that'll be so funny". They made changes that they deemed acceptable to accommodate the a new quest for F2P newbies - Lumbridge is where all of the newb quests start, and there are already a bunch of quests in the castle and that house served basically no purpose, so they made a slight change to make the town a tiny bit more lively &amp; hold the start of the new quest (and perhaps even more content in the future).
---
There is literally no logical justification for the whole "MUH NOSTALIGA!" argument. This is not change for the sake of change, this was change for the sake of improvement. Personally, I like the pub - I think it makes Lumby feel a bit more like an actual small town, rather than just a hodgepodge of useless buildings surrounding the castle of a Lord of a garbage town.
---
The Draynor change was clearly because apart from Sea Shanty 2, Port Sarim sucks. The boats are laid out stupidly and it's difficult to remember which boat goes where (no map links on them, either). Moving that boat to Draynor hurts nothing (other than the boat being severely out of place - I personally think it should be a rowboat on a small dock that he rows out to his anchored ship further out in the bay).
---
If the poll fails they will still be visible to you yes
---
If it passes dropping them will destroy them
---
Hell, let's just make it every month and make the prize $1 - 2m, that'll really draw people in.
---
Did he tell you to go east but then proceeded on going west? If so, slayermusiq confirmed.

I find it a lot easier to just preload interfaces with right clicks right after left clicks, gives you a lot of time.

 **Poll Question #2**

Luckily, people have put the time into creating a client that doesn't make us put up with lazy game design.
---
Thanks Runelite
---
BLN
---
Imagine thinking MTX are even remotely similar to membership.
---
I agree. The whole basis of the game development is it's polls. If we disregard them we might as well play rs3 which osrs ultimately would become without polls.
---
Am I missing something
---
Or just polling the change.
---
It's hard to call something a spinoff when it has a larger community than the "flagship" game
---
ep 2 when?
---
Support 
---
Season 2 is never as good as season 1, just gotta wait for season 3
---
Lmao I’m joking 
---
Where thr NGL for real tho.?
---
Just absorb runelite
---
I thought the phat was a different item from the regular one, so that if it was taken out, it wasn't worth anything
---
Just because someone didn’t message back doesn’t mean they didn’t see your message lol they could be straight up ignoring the messages. 
---
Tag me in I'm ready
---
Yes they did. You dont know what youre talking about.
---
Fax
---
Okay I’m really angry right now 
---
It’s always 4 birdhouses. The only thing that improves with level is the type of log that you use to create the birdhouse. Better birdhouses means more nests/xp per run. At your level I think mahogany is the best 
---
Those are some discount brainlets. Did you draw them yourself?
---
The new quest was polled but this change was not mention.
---
Runercraft
---
I agree that Port Sarim is cluttered and should be cleaned up a bit, but after seeing this sub lose its collective shit over a pub being added to Lumbridge, I think it's safe to say a "Clean Up Port Sarim" poll would fail because "muh nostaliga!!"
---
This whole time I thought the Chad just had a massive Chad powerstance with his butt cheeks facing forward for some reason
---
Depends on what quests you have done. You need to do RFD if you want to pk on that account but you may get taken over 45 def. at which point you should move towards a dharok pure. (75 att, 99str, 70 def, 70 pray, 94 mag) 
---
\[BUFF SLAYER ENCHANTMENTS\] 
---
Perhaps a greater version of slayer staff can be released (Eternal Staff/Wand?)  (with high slayer requirement to wield like 80/90 slayer paired with 80/90 magic)
---
This can provide better mage attack and accuracy/dmg/dps bonuses similar to kodai's 15% dmg or smoke staff 10% dmg, 10% accuracy but applied to slayer dart.
---
Portable herb patch 
---
So Jagflaps should poll every single detail of everything they want to add then? Okay. Better to let an angry bunch of NEETs design the game than actual game developers, right?
---
Either way they need to get done. Just find the content you enjoy and try to focus on it with your limited time and when you get more round it out with everything else? Nothing in this has to be cookie cutter. Unless you are just going for max exp efficiency. Then plenty of YouTube guides are there to help.
---
Good game of spot the noob
---
&gt; What did it cost
---
Everything
---
when i read the update and saw the outrage i thought it was just a small row boat and i was like 'wtf guys, chill'
---
then i saw the luxury cruise liner in what i used to assume was pretty swampy water, and i was also enraged
---
Does it matter in the first place 
---
I hope you get the help you need.
---
 I want her to sit on my face.
---
where can i get the T-shirt?
---
He’ll be able to get full barrows gear, a whip, a glory, combat bracelet, brews, restores, rune boots and manta rays. He will certainly be lacking a bit in the gear department without a blowpipe, but he’ll be pretty well geared. Also, what if he decides to raid with people wearing the same gear he is? I doubt he’d have a hard time finding a team willing to do that with him.
---
But you can add a mouse and keyboard to your phone so...
---
10 mins? What mate
---
Why the hell it bothers you guys so much??? XD

Thinking about it may be the most important part. Gratefulness is key, and you've always had that. 
---
CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3
---
Where does the boat even go? I don’t ever read updates or use poll booth. 
---
You put a lot of effort into your videos and they’re one of the few OSRS I enjoy so I thank you so much Settled. Watching Swampletics has made me get back into the game again too. Keep it up man!
---
deadman mode is not about the competition its about the advertisement and publicity that it brings
---
Last time I saw farming one, dude hit 14m exp+ in a week. 2nd place was like 8m 
---
Block Suqahs if money is a concern, you *have* to cannon them for it not to be an hours long task and it takes like 400k in cannonballs per task, the xp is good but its a huge gp loss
---
I'm complaining about polls, "kiddo". 
---
&gt;Marriage in the USA is christian marriage
---
nah tho
---
And nice the wizard tower to inside of draynor village.
---
You must be new here then. The autism is ever present and generally harmless I swear.
---
I don't care if you think it is obnoxious, that is literally how OSRS was created. It was ONLY because a large group of people loved the old game and polled for it, and this has always been about what the community wanted and not what Jagex wanted for the game. They can fuck around with rs3, but an agreement was made when we bargained for OSRS, and they agreed to let the community decide.
---
This was done because Jagex was failing as a company and old school private servers were way on the rise. OSRS was polled immediately following a fairly large takedown of a incredibly popular 2006 private server, which is why the conversation was initially about making osrs 2006, but they said they only had backups from early 2007 so they couldn't go with the wishes of the community wanting 06. They wanted that though because that very popular private server was 2006, and that was most people's favorite period for the game.
---
Point? Jagex knew they had to capitalize on osrs because people were just going to go to private servers if they didn't do it properly, and so they made it community driven. I don't care that you think it is obnoxious, if you do think so this is probably not the kind of game for you because that is what this game is. A game made by the community with devs paid by the community to get their ideas done with the coding. It's more the community's game than Jagex's at this point.
---
The desert religions doesnt allow for nitpicking because of their scripture dogma to begin with. Let them have their definitions of marriage, make a non religious definition, only test egibility  based on age and non family members. Marriage benefits should then preferably be given to male+female couples to promote having children because the possibility exists. 
---
I don’t think you know what insecure means
---
I bet you are fun at parties. 
---
yeah its kinda silly that they released it to basically be dead content for everyone except some ironmen who'd rather use it instead of ibans blast
---
C'mon Hagrid, we talked about this. If you already have a hard clue scroll in the bank then you won't get any more of them as drops.

I'm an Ironman also, I can't attend drop parties

Holy barrier of entrana monks

It would be more accurate to insult me with the virgin for life comment tbh
---
Lets see.. 9+10, so 21?
---
My personal favorites (aside from Swampletics) are the Karamja, Pirate, and Tirannwn series.
---
Everything is optional you spastic. Even your fucking life is. If it doesnt affect me, then nobody is affected and its pointless to begin with.
---
The troll quest featured a troll migrating north, who happens to be low intelligence. he meets a white snowtroll with RED HAIR called SNOWFLAKE. She just happens to have daddyissues, and the dad doesnt like the migrant. The DAD is also called "MOTHER". As a protest to the fathers rules, she kills him and marries the migrant troll.
---
That is fucking gold. I loved that quest. ;) 
---
keep till entire set and poh it
---
Null
---
Godzhell gang rise up!
---
You’re looking so deep into something that doesn’t matter and it’s sad. Because you have so much hate that you have to dive into metapharoical and philopsophical meanings (that aren’t true and or haven’t been confirmed) to justify your hate. It makes me sad that there is people like you. My PM’s are always open for you to speak. You clearly are repressed and finding avenues to express this self hatred. Wishing you the best 
---
Salve (ei) is better than Slayer Helmet (i), so just switch to blessed d'hide coif and Salve (ei).
---
I was only kidding :)
---
It looks like a fun f2p pure to play on. Keep it up
---
Bgs &gt; Salve(ei) &gt; void &gt; archers ring(i) to start. 83 con would help but you can always just do it on 330 and use hosted houses for now. Levels will be a great way to get more dps but unless you have an excessive amount of money don’t do chins until around 90+. Up until then the xp rates arnt really worth the cost. Instead you could train through slayer or camp sand crabs if you want to do it that way. And you’ll get some do from vorkath too 
---
You can only eat the cake at every 33m gp made.
---
Once you get a tbow you can eat the salmon.
---
Ya fucked it
---
Jmods don’t read this. This is purely for players to answer player questions 
---
We have our side of the town, and the raccoons have theirs.
---
I thought raccoons were nocturnal? 
---
Not in this town.
---
yeah like releasing a quest which brings you to a boat that leads to Zeah but you can't actually go unless you're a member 😂
---
Get void and a BGS as well. You may want to get 83 construction for the ornate pool also. Getting ranged higher would be a good idea also.
---
Is that the bait for cathching karambwans?
---
Or Democrats lol
---
What are some easy pets to get for lower levels?
---
What are some beasts I can grind for a unique drop that is not 1 in a million?
---
Should I grind void only at cb 100 or earlier, and is it better to use for slayer over barrows armour?
---
Is barrows the only bossing one can do at lower levels for good gp/hr? Are there any others?
---
Lastly, any tips for  semi-starting accounts with sub 60 stats?
---
Thanks in advanced.
---
I’ve taken a break from osrs for a while, really enjoying the Morytania series though it’s an interesting watch. Just wanted to say keep up the good work!
---
That placement's all kinds of bad
---
You didn't cross post it?
---
I went ahead and did it.
---
I like the ideas of having contracts for each guild, but farming is rather balanced in the fact that you need to wait for the crop to grow so you can't do 1 million per day.
---
I would be interested to see what kind of ideas people come up with regarding contracts
---
It really is strange that they didn't poll this of all things
---
I'm not seeing your point here. Why is it a big deal that skillers can enter Morytania? How does this effect you in any way as a player who isn't a skiller?
---
The gentrification has begun, a Starbucks will be open soon enough 
---
this sub has the best jokes and memes
---
Noted wont happen, its way too op.
---
It will settle at 7k in a month or so.
---
this is literally the best suggestion about this pub i've seen so far ngl
---
It was in port sarim, where else would you mean by "the rest of them"?
---
this is what you get when you restrict yourself. suck it up cupcake and gain those prayer exp. make prayer pure skiller or something
---
Stealing the Karamjan rum was the first mistake. Uncorking it and taking a sip was the final one. 
---
My rooftops getting crowded man
---
Dont come near my kids!!!!!!!!!
---
have a a few drunken HAM members walk/sit around kinda like in the varrock pub for that one quest where you get the 3 vials from the dudes
---
if things keep up like this you're not going to have any user base in a year or two. Then they're going to release OG 2007scape. But they guaranteed no updates outside patches outside of security.  Then the game will cost $15. Then RuneScape 3 will be popular for some reason. 
---
Then I die 
---
Please delete and try again you messed it up 
---
You're complaining that there are more people playing the game? Weren't people complaining that this game was dying a while before mobile came out?
---
It is a fun gimmick for the Farming Guild.  Doing it for every guild would be too much.
---
caesar cipher, shift right 8
---
1. Make skiller 
---
2. Get mad about not being able to do content that’s been locked to skillers for 15 years.
---
3. ?????????????
---
4. Profit?
---
Really digging the Cock Piece
---
I would, but he gave my donation money to a scammer. :(
---
No one gives a dock
---
It's cool they're adding things
---
FK I just noticed that
---
I thought it was purple because red x blue is purple. 
---
So I’m getting back into slayer. Purely looking to profit for right now. So with all the konar changes, wondering whether I should use her or stick with duradel?
---
I liked the post suggesting to put it above the furnace.
---
Zulrah distilleries 
---
He sounds for left.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^zing
---
As I said above, why is it a big deal that skillers can enter Morytania? Explain to me why this is a thing that would change the game for the worse?
---
We pay; we gay?

---
Yeah
---
Dark beasts never lose their aggro, so it is the perfect afk slayer task. They constantly attack you. 
---
But when people that kill steel dragons are standing on this spot (upper right panel), the dark beast (sometimes both) will aggro that player and ignore you completely.
---
It happened to me so often now.
---
You need level 91Slayer to kill dark beasts.
---
I think this is why lots of people don't get the meaning of my post. :b
---
How is this drama why does anyone care 
---
Seriously, we've already got death chests in various locations, and picking up items elsewhere is free. A global fee on retrieving items would be a great gold sink and actually punish you for dying in non-instanced areas.
---
Go to sythe and then proceed to osrs gold exchange. Your welcome.
---
Like what?... I mean stuff being there that low levels can do is a bit different from activities low levels want to do. How much stuff does a low level really want to do in Zeah
---
Literally unplayable.

If there's nobody to poll, it won't even require engine work.
---
Ohhh yeah yeah
---
Jagex. For like $7 you can get 3m and won’t scam :)
---
&gt; Quack!
---
Duradel is better if you're in mid-high 70s for Slayer if you're trying to make money because of tasks like Wyverns, Gargoyles, Kurasks, etc., but before 70, Konar is probably a bit better gp/hr.
---
If this were Sweden, then your post had been perceived as racist. Lol. 
---
Bond it
---
That’s gotta be torture to watch that shit appear for everyone else lol
---
Early game is best game 
---
Do it again and record it
---
You got downvoted but it kind of proves you are correct
---
Click bait 
---
If they don't stick around then isn't that a win? They won't attack you and you get the PvP world resource to yourself. If they do come back, you're ready if they attack you. That's the whole point of PvP worlds.
---
I'm not sure why you think PvP worlds should follow some honor code like 'if I'm naked in a PvP world, don't attack me.' 
---
I got killed at the wilderness agility course a few minutes ago (no joke) and lost 20k in potions. Instead of bitching about it I decided to gear up in-case he returns. I'll take an exp/hr reduction in exchange for self-defense. That's how skilling in the wilderness &amp; PvP worlds work.
---
You must be 91+ Slayer I guess? :D
---
This likely wouldn't stop conversions of residential dwellings to public houses or the construction of nationally significant infrastructure such as docks 
---
I miss Nieve. Steve is nice but he isn’t Nieve 
---
Agreed, its actually shit
---
When is the update that weapons remeber auto cast options like ibans staff? It passed last poll right? 
---
Red cape was better
---
Depends what tidying up is. Most people feel a lot more nostalgia for draynor village than pot Sarim. Port Sarim to almost everyone is just a travel system. The only nostalgic part of it is sea shanty 
---
Booglagold. Have sold billions and know friends who’ve bought millions.
---
Thoughts on putting in a 1 time rune payment for the bank in the ourania altar area, maybe 500k of a single rune type?
---
Honestly hope they don't respond to it and everyone realizes how autistic they've been.
---
&gt; Technically jagex has stated that it is not against rwt or any other in-game rules.
---
Are you sure about that? 
---
The [official rules](https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules) state the following:
---
&gt; #Real World Trading
---
&gt; Game items must only be exchanged for other items/services within the game.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; **Real World Trading explained**
---
&gt; Real-world trading is the term used for activities which occur outside of the game environment which result in the real-world sale or purchase of items, GP or services with the intention of supplying or advancing a Jagex in-game character other than by the means that are incorporated into the game.
---
Notice how it specifically says "within the game", "activities which occur outside of the game environment" and "other than by the means that are incorporated into the game." 
---
I don't know about you, but as far as I'm aware RS3 does not exist within OSRS and neither does OSRS exist within RS3. There are no means incorporated into either game to facilitate swapping (e.g. through bonds). 
---
Maybe if you use the broad definition of "game environment" you could have a point. Then again the previous two points do not align with that definition, as those specifically talk about **within** the game itself.
---
you should leave the account there and it will forever be a meme
---
seriously
---
Having to stab your finger or try to see the few pixel seed on the ground.  Could easily missed snap dragon seeds on mobile while doing Kurasks with bonecrusher on.
---
One of my favorites of yours so far
---
looooooooooooooooooooool

I love how he got famous by the memes on this subreddit

We have included the same-day patch to 2.15.6 which rate-limits prayer to prevent one-tick use of bones. This was temporarily made possible in OSBuddy without AHK as a result of the POH plugin changes in 2.15.6. One-tick prayer has been common in the past due to players using AHK, however it has been determined that this is an illegitimate method of training, and so you can no longer do this at all when the POH plugin is enabled. We retain the convenience feature of swapping out the bury option, so that players can avoid the frustration of mis-clicking bones, without increasing XP/hr. You can still one-tick prayer with AHK if you disable the POH plugin, but this one-to-many action method has not been approved by Jagex, so we strongly suggest you avoid it.
---
Hashtag this nigga lyin your honour 
---
Much thanks 
---
Feels bad man, look for the video that so many people told me to make :]
---
The dock looks 100% out of place and fucks with the whole area. The pub I don't really give a shit about but also its unnecessary, and takes out a previously empty house that people would RP in.
---
Don't you make decent money with marks of grace?
---
Much thanks! 
---
No herb patch. Downvoted.
---
It wasn't a bug and was only useful for ironmen. Jagex is polling having sandstone be able to be used as a substitute for buckets of sand however they overlooked this searchable stone near the camulet teleport which can be searched for a sandstone(5kg). For the 4 or so hours that this was widely known it was possible to get about 20k buckets of sand worth of sandstone per hour. This is in comparison to the 2k buckets of sand we max out at right now.
---
i share your opinion.
---
It's alright, ik it's a difficult time for UK players, look for the video and thank you! 
---
anyone who isnt dried out shit
---
Why the bracers? 
---
Fucking gross.  
---
Jagex fucking sucks
---
Fuckking slagex
---
Because there's a pub in lumbridge 
---
At the VERY LEAST, why not just put the boat right on the other side of that stone wall where the shortcut is? At least that way it isn't in draynor
---
Whilst it does sound fun to anti pk, theres enough trees at the guild for it to not be an issue, its not like f2p cutting yews for competition
---
I'm buying Wyrm bones, around 1.1k each for 175xp on a lit guilded alter...
---
I’ve been involved in PKing since 2006. It’s fucking stupid.
---
We are all ignoring the big thing here  THE PIG PENS ARE OPEN
---
He probably resets his slayer task to check if he can do it. And im pretty sure he will cover it in the next video
---
I'm 91 range, 80 Dec, 71 prayer.
---
Blowpipe with addy darts (drag for jad), anguish, blessed boots, archer ring (I), karil top/bot, barrows gloves, slayer helm (i), ava assembler. Usually have 10 super restores left and a few sara brews after jad 
---
This is actually a great opportunity.
---
No movement Ironman. Can only trade with other people or pick up items they drop under him
---
Also is it worth having holy wrench in invent?
---
Clean edit have my upvote
---
Ok thanks
---
Agree so much. You can tell their sarcasm on streams when say "if the players want it..then sure we can look into it" and I laugh every time. Honestly NO game should ever be 100% "ruled" by the players. There is a reason that we arent game devs. Have you seen the ideas of some people on here? They are fucking ridiculously stupid. I can only imagine what people like that vote for on things. 
---
I really do wish they did more updates without polls. 
---
You must really hate hunter eh?
---
why did you cut it right at her feet
---
Yeah I was just having that same thought. I mean when was the last time I went to draynor besides when I accidentally teleport there 
---
C Engineer, please don't mind me using your intro :3 couldn't resist, love your channel (extra credits in description)
---
seeing how supply costs are not an issue you may aswell do it
---
There's no better mix
---
Thanks for info dude
---
Moms credit card
---
WHY ARE YOU GETTING ANGRY!?!!?! YOU IDIOTS HAVE TURNED THIS GUY INTO A CULT. 
---
Ironman and trading?🤔
---
I think at 71 you get 1 extra prayer point, but it might be 2, depends on how much you get out of 1 4 dose super restore
---
You accused someone, but where is your proof?
---
The old HD graphics were terrible lmao no ty
---
Don’t steal the name branding of a living god
---
Stupid question tbh
---
EOC and rs3 proved jagex cant be trusted with the reigns of their own game. probem is that new players from mobile will not know this and vote yes more often. just as planned.
---
Don’t be fooled mate. This is runescape, mod gee’s a middle aged dude.
---
Got 2 bludgeon pieces after my first 3 unsireds. All unsireds since then have also been garbage
---
Okay idk where the text went, but this dude followed me around for 25 minutes non stop asking for 1m. Obviously I did not give it to him since I don't even have 1m. Is this what rich players do to get rich?
---
Piety, too late for anything else
---
Arma wont melee you if you are focusing her. During chinning you attack the minion and let the splash damage hit Kree then click back and forth so you can set target. If youre doing it without chins you would just simply attack Kree with tbow/cbow
---
I don't know if this has been mentioned to you or not (probably has), but you are an absolute sex machine
---
Don't you need like 10 tents to upgrade the trident and finish the boss though? 
---
If they remove those wizards we riot
---
D
---
Already been done lmao
---
Yeah I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the way to quell player concerns about adding in an unpolled dock is *not* going to be to buff Runecrafting.
---
That's obviously because it's a restricted area, the pub isn't restricted so they just didn't think at all about it.
---
This is awesome haha
---
Fuck I looked.
---
They should add more pubs and more boats until you guys stop crying.
---
Make the place look like Ireland.
---
Sorry for your loss. Just start over, 18years of work on your account is nothing man /s
---
Honestly think it's too big of an increase. 6x more ash at 92 mining is absolutely insane. Feels like the bottomless bucket was added for nothing at this point tbh since it already effectively doubles the amount of compost you have. The bucket + the 6x increase in ash means you're pretty much set for weeks, if not months, after just 1 hour of ash mining. Not a fan of that.
---
Advertising Zeah to upsell membership
---
Noobs pee there
---
People in my country can vote... If they're a citizen. Yet I know people who have lived here 20+ years who aren't legally allowed to vote.. Having a requirement isn't unheard of let alone a bad thing.
---
My gripe is consistency, either poll EVERYTHING or NOTHING. I personally had the same thoughts when it came to voting and hoped that the Devs would take it into their own hands eventually. That stopped about 10 Q&amp;A's ago and literally every Q&amp;A since has pushed me further and further into uncertainty. A majority of the devs are clueless and the community is a shitfest.
---
RS3 is "easier" in the sense that the XP rates per hour are (often) far higher than OSRS, this means you will get levels earlier and you will get to do more content in a shorter amount of time.
---
i dont personally think it is a big deal but its so unnecessary and easily avoidable from jagexs part that its ridiculous. you'd think they know better.
---
Elf City coming to a pub near you.
---
- Jagex (2019) 
---
WTF WHY DID THEY DO THAT??? THIS GAME HAS GONE TO SHIT, ITS SLOWLY BECOMING RS3, I PLAY THIS GAME 23 HOURS A DAY AND THIS IS WHAT I GET????FUXK YOU JAGEX
---
like watching people die?
---
Quick question, why weren’t they asked to enter an auth code on login? From what I gather they got your email and password for your os account, and nothing else, as that’s all you entered into the phishing site?
---
clients can compensate for this (runelite) but if they gave the ability for us to resize so many things people would feel it ruins there experience.
---
Move it back to Port sarim. Add another step that leads the players there.
---
In 2019 do we really not expect players to find a boat themselves in the town pretty much next door?
---
Moving it down by the Wizards Tower would be good I think c: 
---
Last year a pride event was announced by Mod Wolf (if I recall correctly), but Reddit argued it wasn't relevant to Runescape so naturally they rioted in Falador square. I think 4chan got involved somewhere along the line too. 
---
Now it looks like Ireland
---
It must be really hard to be this bothered by some buildings and UI changes.  
---
Seriously, you're stressing out about nothing, It's not like they updated OSRS to EoC.  
---
I played RS3 and it was alright. My peeve with it is you progress way to fast and you don't really care for dying much - you're safe. I label RS3 as a whale game.. easy to skill so you can easily use the items you buy with real money.
---
OSRS is a lot slower so you feel better about each level up and you'll actually be doing things at lower levels rather than accidentally speed leveling to mid level and realizing you haven't really done much.
---
Conclusive statement: RS3 feels like a phone game with quick leveling and flashy crap. OSRS is a true MMORPG.
---
Since he’s region locked it’ll be an untrimmed Barrows cape too!
---
You botted kid
---
More money will always help- allows for you to flip high value items with large profit margins, and to flip more high volume items at once.
---
That being said, make a goal. Merch to 15-20m, 30. Feels great to hit a benchmark.
---
I think your current profits are right on track for your cash stack, if you’re enjoying merching continue on, sounds like you’re doing it right to me.
---
Dovydas’ time is over. 
---
How cynical do you have to be to complain about spec bar changes?
---
Maybe it should have been put in Rimmy, there’s nothing to do there anyways for f2p
---
why not just replace draynor with Zeah so newer players will be introduced to it earlier
---
To you that's what it's about. OSRS is a game, just because you feel a certain way doesn't make it the truth. Jagex owns the game, we should be glad that they let us decide certain things, not mad that they don't let us design everything.
---
Being a citizen of a country is a de facto requirement to vote in its affairs, that would equate to just being a player of the game, false equivalence.
---
It's a unique account, since you're new it will be easier to start over. Keep this one just to show off
---
Gz on bird pet!
---
Oh no internet man spend real money on fake coin 
---
this ones better imo
---
A shitty house barely anyone paid the slightest bit of attention to is not "iconic". How retarded do you have to be to get this upset over something so utterly insignificant. 
---
Move back to Port Sarim, give him a nice, unique, fancy ship and add some Shayzien soldiers nearby in their armour and that should draw the attention of new players travelling by.
---
No, I don't have the funding for stuff like that haha. Feel free to get it printed for yourself though if you'd really like! 
---
The drop rate of the keys compared to the actual drops is very different, gg making money from Konar. I've gotten 1 key in the last 15 tasks. 
---
 1/100 for level 100 monsters and 1/50 for level 350 monsters, scaling linearly and capping at 350 
---
Thanks that’s good to know I’m on track! Yeah I’m really enjoying it, now I need to find a skill I can make money with whilst standing at the G.E, currently making wines but that costs money not makes it haha
---
Pause..
---
I wouldn't ever have complained jagex put the changes in, the boat does look out of place though. I'd personally not have done it that way
---
It'll be a dead meme in a week.
---
You didn't lose money so you're on the right track in my eyes
---
Let's go by rs3 lore and add 8 bar rows
---
That's actually be a pretty cool pier
---
i voted no on gwd and ge because osrs shoulda been its own thing
---
https://i.imgur.com/FLUdNi7.png
---
The fact that jagex specifies that the blowpipe's base speed is shortbow speed on rapid and therefore a tick faster on rapid leads me to believe they intended to poll it as it currently. They also explicitly say the attack speed is 3, which is the speed of darts.
---
Torsty* better luck next time.
---
I sent you a message too :)
---
Moveit either further south to the wizards tower or simply place it in port sarim where it belongs.  Additionally bring the house back and add the pub a but further north. Throw some ham members in there Aswell for some lore.
---
Efficacy at hydra?? Or market manipulation?? Only things I can think of...
---
Rs3, osrs is an eye sore and is pretty out dated. Cosmetics are terrible but doesn’t affect your gameplay. There is a lot more content in rs3 but has a lot better options to afk skill while studying.
---
Might negatively impact PvP. 
---
The Redbeard Frank was a suggestion I dropped in some thread the other day. I truly think it would give a huge amount of utility. It makes that spirit tree patch more useful. It gives the agility shortcut new value. It's close to Draynor anyhow. It more perfectly fits the theme of the existing pirates in Port Sarim. It keeps the Zeah connection in a major port. 
---
when i did jad tasks i prayed rigour the entire fight. 99 range though xD
---
I learned Vorkath in two tries and didn't die.
---
Just dont have the time :). Just got back in the game after 5 months and bought 120 mil glad people like him make it cheap to get gold
---
Hydra bones are better now, tbow is pretty good at hydra. That's the only thing I can think of
---
not much tbh
---
doesn't look like you've spent more than 2 hours on the account. Make a new one and have this become legendary
---
Seems like you are the angry one
---
Or we can recognize that while polling should exist, the outrage over this is entirely fucking stupid.
---
I hate these posts, for 1 osrs didn't even  have the original lumbridge or dryanor so get off your high horse about changing a iconic area as it's irrelevant.
---
Sure
---
Damn, I was really enjoying being outraged. How dare they be reasonable and pleasant!
---
RSN: Carve
---
"Clans should be removed REEEEEEEEE clanmanmode *continuous screeching*" 
---
You have my upvote and my support, OP
---
I would suggest the dock be moved to lumby swamp for Veos to remain low key
---
i know he was a cunt in the past, i dont know what hes like now though
---
Just a joke fam 
---
If you're willing to get 10 range levels then do it, then just buy a blowpipe.
---
You don't know how to take a screenshot on your cellphone?? Grandma is that you??
---
It would ruin special snowflake f2p players
---
ELEVEN BUCKS PHUCKERS 
---
I am glad you have come forward and admitted to this offence. But the point still stands that this was MURDER and you will be send to the port sarim jail. From there you will be moved to seers village for your trial.
---
Welp, time to park myself onto the dock and wait until it's removed. Time to start my Standing-on-water-next-to-Draynor-only Ironman
---
for me its a disconnect, bad tasks are bad until i open the box, at which point im onto the next task
---
I remember RSMV being pretty popular, but why were they popular 😂😭
---
"f2p will feel like a shitty demo constantly encouraging you to pay (like get bond in rs3)" like it was in 2007 minus nostalgia
---
This is late stage capitalism
---
Add a darker smaller dock with a rowboat. After doing the quest, have a cutscene where you and Veos row across to Port Sarim where you get to a more koursend looking ship with kourend guards
---
I hope they poll to change it back just so I can vote no and spite people :).
---
Phishing platform is gonna be hella busy during QnA's

Mainly kill stuffs :)

---
So you’re farming your 30 accounts to make money for your main?
---
Lore wise distance between Taverly and Falador is solid 1 day of walking
---
All Zuharrs drawings are very cringey
---
Why does he need to be a muscly naked dude? It makes no sense 
---
It's going to break off and connect itself to the new dock in Draynor, the plan if for the whole or port sarim to slowly be moved over there without players really noticing.
---
Some will be finished over time others are unsure because they've been finished in rs3 and osrs team doesn't want to reuse them.
---
Ok, that is good. Your email seems safe then (other than them knowing the email).
---
This also means that they managed to recover the account through the manual recovery form. Doing this will also change the registered email to whatever they want. Which obviously means that you wont receive any recovery emails and will have to also recover it through the recovery form. 
---
When it tells you that Jagex has sent an email, there should be an option somewhere saying "I don't have access to the registered email". Clicking on that will bring you to the recovery form.
---
It’s worth coming back 
---
&gt;Competition for resources is a natural part of the game
---
Seriously was your head repeatedly used as a door stop when you were growing up? Nobody finds world hopping or getting crashed fun, all of these areas where it was designed to repeatedly kill the same boss over and over are meant to be available to any player that wishes to do so. This has even been fixed with Vorkath &amp; Zulrah being instanced, it just hasn't translated to older content bosses which should happen. 
---
&gt;means more uniques coming into the game thus lowering their price.
---
So the hell what, I don't give a crap if it depreciates your inconvenience only brainlet account. Places like god wars are already as old as the old school release as it is, precedence shows that Jagex are moving to the instanced model with newer bosses and rightly so because they want everyone to be able to participate.
---
Thank you for hearing our feedback, always good to know that things like this get taken care of.
---
I hope those empty vials weren't all prayer pots.... Jesus Christ
---
Got 2 dwh on 2100 kc. You'll get it, don't give up.
---
It teases Zeah for F2P people.
---
Dragonbone is already BIS for Chrinning/bursting in mm1 and mm2 caves. Lowering the requirement from 80 to 43 is kind of insane.
---
I cant stop laughing!
---
Damn, didn't know it was *that* bad. Honestly, if competitive melee were to die now, then atleast it had an amazing run.
---
There should be an option for volume mixer it you right click the volume icon. It's there on every version of Windows 10. You can turn your client down to very low that way
---
a good example:
---
i told 2 of my irl friends that played rs 10+ years ago that they have change the house in lumbridge ( the original house that u sleep in back in runescape classic ) and added a doc to draynor village.
---
the first thing they both said was: "fk is osrs already ruined before we got to try it?"
---
Runelite will get you so much more as it shows you when the blue is about to become green haha. so you can move at the perfect time :L
---
Taking 4 items is a sure fire way to get teams coming after you, plus with op being level 60ish there's not much he can take to speed up his task besides a decent wep and black mask/slay helm. 
---
It's hard to gauge - people tend to be a lot louder when they dislike something than when the like something. 
---
Yeah, I dont get why the top voted comment ignores this. It would be confusing if enchant works on all gem amulets... oh and ruby ring btw, but none of the others sorry.
---
No, no the do not. Do they nerd to be talked about? Yes.
---
If we, the community had wind of this, there wouldn't be a massive ship in Draynor.
---
Not everything a company does need to be asked, this was a business move, I understand.
---
How we have them implemented should be our choice. 
---
thanks man, means alot :)
---
Your email address (which is visible on the second picture of your imgur album) is on the haveibeenpwned list 4 times. Using a leaked email address such as this that is on 4 data breach list for an account that precious for you is clearly showing how little you did to actually avoid the situation. Using gmail with 2step authenticator is the least you could have done instead of hotmail. 
---
Where do you guys make these maps?
---
I think the best idea would be a redesign of the Port to make it more efficiently hold all the ships in it.
---
I did also like the idea of moving the boat to entrana to this spot instead.
---
Is that reynad?!
---
I definitely like the idea of including some H.A.M lore. I'd prefer it to be subtler though, rather than clothed members. It's supposed to be an underground group.
---
I like the idea of changing the pub back to the original house in Lumbridge but with a trapdoor leading to a hidden bar. Would be reminiscent of the prohibition era of 1920.
---
&gt; When equipped prayer xp is lost 
---
No thanks.
---
thanks
---
But OP is either a murderer or worse..
---
Has been doing runecrafting
---
Have they played the game? Or are they just influenced by your butthurtedness about this? I get the feeling you would colour the statement a bit more than just " they changed a house and added a dock".. Either way, two of your friends are not a group big enough to make your statement that thats how new players think.
---
Gotta get a tele tab first!
---
I’m glad someone else has thought like this. Literally a bunch of crybabies karma hunting. 
---
true, my first zenyte shard already pay for the pipe and better gear.. next shards will go towards 99 with chins

"Here take this teleport tab to Camelot and trade my main"

It becomes 10 + 5 x 2 which should be done as 10 + (5 x 2) Which is ***20***.

That only applies if the leaked info is the same as the password they use to login. My email is on there a few times but as I use a unique password for my email it has never been touched.
---
This sucks so much bro, really hope @jagex replies to you.
---
1: its a series from the youtuber "settled" he made an area restricted UIM.  
---
2: a new f2p quest was added in the latest update. not sure if there will be more content but could be.  
---
3: no idea  
---
4: no

Firmly grasp it!

Honestly, I never wanted to go back to fish the bait anymore. I plan on getting 99 fishing from karambwans so I thought to just get a million bait and I'd be set.

Also karedst memoirs

What planet do you have to be from to come up with this kind of shit
---
I would skill to get the required skills for dragon slayer quest, then once you complete that you can move on from there. There’s tons of more fun content out there, however some parts are accessible by questing. Then there is GWD which is another goal you can start doing at mid level 70’s for all combat levels(attck,Str, and Def) then group boss their to make money. There’s still more content on from there like Slayer etc... 
---
It isn't specifically aimed at you. The message appears to anyone in the area with accept aid on. So they are just teleporting themselves and you have aid on. 
---
Debatable.  That doesnt help you with raids at all, or during something like killing hydra boss, etc.
---
Well damn. I haven’t been able to find this info on wikis. Devalues my post lol. 
---
Todt method is slow exp, but it's definitely less cancerous
---
Not to mention the minecart system also.
---
If you look at the current number of players compared to release and a year or 2 after it's so much higher now. 
---
Yep. Fuck the Dock.
---
All so some noobs can get 200gp
---
Crackin'
---
proper shit
---
copy the application
---
Oof
---
Aaaaaaaaaaahhh!!! 😡
---
There we are. Now i'm happy again thanks! 
---
I love the mole it depends on English soley, but you can always save the crappier seeds for farming or odd collections. My suggestion is to do both see which one is more after a few inventory’s if each method
---
Do you feel like he let his streamer status get to his head and decided he could start calling shots Jagex should be making? 
---
it was a cool meetup spot in lumbridge 
---
Looks like you and op need r/ironscape 
---
(On mobile, no idea if linking sub reddits worls
---
I would say because he died on his HCIM. At the moment Boaty and Sick Need are doing the juicy content where Faux has only just started again 
---
Correct, forgot about that one
---
you guys know the mods are probably like "I can't believe we have to cater to the few thousand people out of the hundreds of thousands of players for things as small as this"
---
I mean; I'd agree if agility wasn't barred by diaries in osrs. But they are. 
---
Yeah I just seem to get about 200 every run and it takes ages harvesting, I’ve actually stopped harvesting it now because it doubles the time my herb runs take. It’s great xp but a time drain
---
Nice! I have an untrimmed rc to buy atleast 10 capes and telegrab them to keep the untrimmed! 
---
I mean. That old house was the only actual apartment in Lumbridge and now its gone. Feels kind of weird not having at least one home at Lumbridge. 
---
Thats why I would have loved to have Pub added instead of replace.
---
Brave
---
Well as I've said in multiple comments now, I am fine with them adding the Pub for the quest; I never said that was a bad thing. I was never commenting on the addition of the Pub or the Quest, just the suggestion to remap Lumbridge that I replied to. You went and took my comments to a suggestion and applied them to the Quest instead.
---
But I never said the Quest was changing things for the sake of changing things; I said the Suggestion was changing things for the sake of changing things. The Pub is fine where it is; relocating it to bring back the useless house and also moving the General Store is just changing Lumbridge for the sake of changing it. It isn't being done to bring new content like with the Quest; it is just being suggested because the OP thinks it looks better but Lumbridge has been around for like a decade and its layout has never been a problem. We don't have to keep things exactly like they were back in 2007, but we should try to keep them similar where possible and changing the layout of the starting town out of preference is not a good reason.

Ah ok I have that. Yet to kill any so might at some point

Devalues (Cat only to obtain death runes) ironman
---
i managed to get a 5 letter name on my main and a 6 letter name on my hcim recently, they aren’t all taken, just takes trial and error and creativity. if you are looking for a shorter one like 4 or 3 letters almost if the actual words are taken, but if you look at it as 26x26x26x26, there are over 456,000 possible combinations. they aren’t all taken, but with 5 and 6 letters there still are a plethora of word names available. try looking up rarely used nouns, adjectives, or verbs and go from there. 
---
I agree its an absolute pain in the ass to get there as a new player.
---
I wish the main teleport wasn't locked behind some favor. 
---
Can just buy the rings off the GE?
---
The counter weights must weigh around 6.5m miligrams
---
Honestly, it's boring af watching someone redo the grind. It's kind of like these streamers staked all their content on HCIM and when they die, who the fuck is gonna watch you rebuild for another 2 years? 
---
Alfie has died like every other 6 months of some shit. I stopped watching after his second death. 
---
Make a ironman account lel
---
Quality argument. 
---
Seriously though, the backlash is just memes and herd mentality. 
---
Most of us normal, less vocal players are absolutely blown away that the dev team even cares what the community has to say. You guys are doing great and thanks for pushing out new content! 
---
Including the minecart system, fairy rings, Veos boat to Land's End - Piscarillius I counted 26 travel destinations in total.
---
Just checked haveibeenpwned.com and they’ve been pwned 4 times. Once in the recent collection #1 breech. Probably used the same password across multiple accounts.
---
&gt; Holy shit you're retarded.
---
Why are people acting as if thid has to make sense logistically from a public transport standpoint? When were any of you under the impression that Veos and his boat were the official transportation to Zeah for Gielinor? He is and always has been a mysterious mystic offering passage to a foreign land.
---

Lol another person who thinks a village can't have a single dock, jesus christ.
---
Do morytania hard before you start the grind. You won't regret it :)
---
I don’t think it has anything to do with his status. It’s a culmination of greed, and elitism. 
---
Granted I could be entirely wrong. 
---
Good. Just a reminder hes the one that fucked the Konar drop table over for everyone. 
---
Being a new player doesn't give you any sort of advantage or disadvantage really. It's not a particularly competitive game, so it's not like you're going to be going up against people who have been playing for decades and always feel like you're twenty steps behind. There's also always people at your level as well, between new players returning with mobile and people making new accounts.  
---
If you're the kind of person that likes setting a goal for themselves and the feeling you get when you accomplish that goal, then this game is for you. Progression is slow. You could literally put thousands of hours into the game without maxing, and I don't think there's a single person that can really say they've fully 100% "beaten" the game (Only 1 person has 200m in all skills, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't have all the pets in the game).  
---
If you're the kind of person that thrives on PvP, OSRS may or may not be for you. There is a PvP scene, but as a new player you're going to be at a huge disadvantage. Most of the people that are into PvP have been doing it for years and years. The combat system has a really low skill floor and really high skill cap, so if you're willing to put the time into practicing and understand that you're going to get beat down for the first few months (after spending a few months making an account that's PvP worthy) then give it a shot.  
---
If you think most MMO's are shit because they're just too grindy, then OSRS definitely isn't for you. Like I said earlier, progression is very slow and grinding most skills is doing the same series of actions over and over again for hours on end. The fastest skills in the game would still take like 10-15 hours to get from 1-99, and the slowest could take 200-400+. There are 23 skills in the game. Do the math. This is just the skilling side of things. Max gear is somewhere around 5 bil, and top tier efficient raiding makes around 10 mil an hour I believe, so there's another 500++ hours. Wanna get the quest cape? There's another 100-300 hours. Wanna get all the pets? There's another few thousand hours.  
---
On the flip side, if you think most MMO's are shit because everything is locked behind a time gate and/or you run out of things to do then OSRS is definitely for you. There's enough content that you could play 4 hours a day for years and still have things to do. Also, there's nothing like WoW where you can only do so many things a day/week then really have nothing to do until they're unlocked again on the next day/week. So if you're the kind of person that's really busy during the week but can put in 20 hours on the weekend, you'll progress at basically the same speed as someone that plays for \~3 hours a day every day.
---
Killer Ironman!
---
Thanks for the insight :) I am gonna side with you. 
---
That's badass as fuck.
---
You need real life gambling addiction help. 
---
I mean I find it pretty useless personally but I do use it for getting to Chambers of Xeric since I haven't unlocked the Quidamortem tele on Xeric's Talisman.
---
Well, it makes sense from a game balancing perspective that jagex should get to choose the default option. They definitely didn’t want to have rares in the game but gave players the option of having them if enough players wanted it. Seems fair.
---
I think if they polled a question like “should we *not* add the sailing skill” it would stir up enough controversy where they would word it differently. For things like rares and balancing I understand though
---
I wanna know what tf the Oracle was
---
Wiki on Zeah has a list of "getting there"
---
This path isn’t chained well. If you’re starting at the GE cause you just bought the seedlings run to the spirit tree in the GE, press 2, and the first tree is just near you to the right of the spirit tree. Then go back to the spirit tree and press 1. This will take you to the gnome village area and pass through the gate and and follow elkoy out of the maze then the patch is just south west of you. After this, teleport to Camelot (Catherby) and run past the fishing/grappling spot. After you’ve done this one and if you don’t have your house in brimhaven just run back to the port in catherby and take the charter to brimhaven. 
---
Would it be possible to extend the Entrana Ship's Dock further east and have Veos dock there? Then it could be in Port Sarim without being as easy to miss and obscured in the back. But I defiantly think Veos should be somewhere in Sarim if a good spot can be found/made. Another idea was to put him where the Corsair Ship is and move the Corsair Ship to his old spot or such, but that would be more work.
---
&gt; The landmass is huge but has nothing of value. There are good things  there, such as the hosidius cooking range, the WC and new farming guild. 
---
and the blood/soul runecrafting and tithe farm and lizardman shamans and CoX and the diary and sand crabs and anglerfishing and... but it's just a big empty landmass wtf jagex just delete it lol
---
He has almost 3k subs lol. 
---
No, you don't understand, this game developer made a minor change to their own game! I think we need to boycott them.
---
I think the problem with moving it so far out is that this quest is aimed at new players and Veos telling them his dock is near the crafting guild probably doesn't mean anything to the new players. Draynor at least they can open the world map and likely immediately see it on the map from their location and go there
---
goblin shine
---
I have never ever used them, I think the only time anyone ever has contact with the carts is either (as you said) for coing to CoX while not having the teleport unlocked yet &amp; for the favour hahah
---
I did say I was ignorant to the area lol. 
---
Gz and nice choice for untrimmed
---
It's the only shitty MMO thats kept me around for 14 years. Give it a try.
---
I'd highly recommend getting members, F2P is really really bad and comparable to trial accounts in other MMO's.  
---
As far as what to do next... That's the beauty of RS: You decide! Figure out what you wanna do and start working towards that. Starting out with quests is never a bad idea, especially as a new player... The XP rewards are amazing at low levels and ofc it unlocks more content that's useful later on in the game (Some of the best content is locked behind quests).
---
Imagine getting booty raped in pvp and making a shitty reddit meme on it
---
I did this step a couple days ago on one of my first hard clues and wondered if this was one of the only steps that requires interaction with another player. I went to world 2 where everyone stakes and someone just dueled me to let me in there, he wouldn't even let me pay him. Its really not that bad
---
Boaty, sick nerd and faux
---
That's the beauty of OSRS (or any MMO I've played anyway) - you can do whatever you want, you should be a bit confused with what to do next. Just explore the landscape, talk to the NPCs (you may want to talk to the ones with blue stars next to them as they give quests if you have the skill requirements), train your skills, ask random players what they're doing etc. You only don't know the game once - once you know the game you can worry about what your goals are next, just enjoy exploring at the minute though!

Stray Cat in lumby. Stray Dog in varrock.

That isn't how it works to my knowledge. It clears the slate every time you close it.

Not enough craft breweries, I feel like you're really neglecting a lot of the small batch brewers
---
Slayer enchantments already fill a good niche, and I still use mine even with 96 magic and a trident. This doesn't seem necessary.
---
Which is classed as real word trading, therefore I wouldn't recommend pursuing this method.
---
Who cares about same med lvl ironman slayer grind round 949940594040693.
---
I love that you guys really care about what the community feels, but please keep in mind reddit is not the entire rs community. Don't you think it's a bit much that people are complaining about replacing a house nobody uses with a pub?? I think the people on here are being a bit unrealistic in demanding to know and vote on every minor change being made and having a say in such unimpactful things. It's too small of a change that doesn't have a direct impact to be concerned about as a player. Nobody will quit over removing a house in LUMBRIDGE and if they do, do we really want a player that volatile in our community anyways? 
---
Now what would make a much more significant impact is hiding the poll results. The crowd effect is scientifically proven and many people will (without even realizing it) will vote in favor of the majority because of that alone.
---
1) he usually goes live at around 9 est

2) he pretty much consistently gets 1-1.5k viewers so

You need to go kill yourself. You Trump sucking piece of shit
---
Price of gold has gone up. I remember when it was around 0.8-0.9/mil. 
---
BTW your reports does NOTHING. You think it helps but really it doesn't.  Buyers never gets banned and for sellers, it's like rolling  a 50 sided dice and getting banned if it lands on 2. 
---
That'd still be unfair advantage. Knowing what they have switched to before it's visually apparent changes the meta of pvp.
---
Maybe you should post this on the rs3 sub reddit... not the osrs one......
---
But does the color match the boats and docks in Zeah? 
---
So I’m guessing you don’t have a bank pin either? Jesus Christ 
---
Jagex themselves said from day 1 that OSRS would be a community run game and anything big like scenery changes would be polled. They didn't honor the promise they made to us. I could care less about the change, i'm most upset by jagex not letting us choose. 
---
I'm Irish. This looks normal to me.
---
And Dorst means thirsty in Dutch too..
---
That doesn't even make sense. What?
---
Would be new to Zeah
---
yep
---
I get that but I get plenty of bad drops as it is. Would just be nice if it had a use.
---
I've been metaphorically raped in my hiney and it hurts.
---
What a fool I was. 
---
Nice bought account lmao
---
Take a look at the twisted bow, it doesn't degrade to dust so barely ever do any leave the game. Yet somehow the prices still crank up sometimes by even 100m over a month.
---
Ive been wanting to do vorkath but I'm only 86 range. How much is that gonna suck for me?
---
Well, are you going to deny a man in his own house?
---
As in the draynor without a rooftop agility course?
---
I am 100% convinced that this is because WoW has French servers and French people have a tendency to refuse speaking other languages.
---
I was looking up stats for the entirety of Europe a week ago or so and came to this conclusion when I saw that France was by far the Wow-heaviest country in Europe in this comparison
---
I want to hear from people who enjoy the low EXP rates of OSRS and the basic combat and their take on it.
---
Yeah but we also fuck
---
damn man good stuff
---
damn that looks nice!
---
The entitlement is real. Scenery changes are not big. Quit acting like you should have final say in everything
---
Too many dailies that you have to do to be efficient ruins it. 
---
Sounds like we need to up the passing  to 80% ree
---
It makes me sad to hear 'low EXP rates', just try it dude
---

Rs3 Ironman isn't bad. There's a few active clans as well. The lodestone network is super nice especially when starting out &amp; the achievement diary(s) are still good to complete. I think you can start off the same way as on osrs (waterfall -&gt; feud) and with the mining and smithing rework getting armor and weapons isn't hard (for melee). Otherwise quest and minigame armor is the go to: lunar &amp; war priest of tuska.

Off topic but tangentially relevant:

Why do people think fucking isp is a super important data point? It absolutely shouldn't be if it is, and this literally wasn't even a question in the recovery process for years and years so I doubt it had much weight. People talk about "yeah I knew the isp!!" As if that is the end all be all deciding factor in a recovery. You can just fucking guess comcast and be right half the time in America. It's such a stupid, irrelevant footnote. 
---
My mistake! Comment removed to avoid confusion.

Not everything needs to be polled

If you're interested in this head on over to r/Uniqueironmen as it's solely dedicated to stuff like this!

I got kq helm at 54 cb lol really not too bad
---
think i heard him talk about using broads aswell so he will need pts for that so yeh skipping probz
---
Well, that isn't true, whatsoever.
---
You draw my mind. Internet points for you!
---
You're looking too deep into it mate. My point is valid. If you don't know what you're doing don't do it. Jagex hands imbeciles the power to influence something they know nothing of and may never touch. Stop trying to move it from requirements to vote to some stupid shit about migrants, refugees or natives. It's a deep, irrelevant hole with no reason to go down it.
---
As someone with an EHP F2P main I can understand people enjoying F2P. I'd just go a little crazy if that was all I played because F2P beastiary is so small, and I love PvM
---
Ironpeople skillers*
---
I was actually sad they changed the 2 most nostalgic towns in the game, you likely havent even been around long enough to grow attached to any of this
---
Woah thank you for sharing that!
---
Lol he wasn't the only one complaining. He didn't make the changes or suggest what the new drop table should be. He just shared the opinion of almost every high level Ironman. 1.5k brews was ridiculous no matter how rare they are. How are people still not over this.. 
---
Yeah it does, but if you cancel that action without realizing it hasn't refilled, you're left with an empty vial and an annoyed player.
---
Yeah because not a lot of people do cox compared to something like bandos, not to mention its rarity and place as a status symbol/merch item. Kraken is instanced and requires 87 slayer, the tent is like 400k and trident around a mil only cause of the runes in it, and these are both required to make bis gear 
---
Lmao. Never really gave to much thought about burying bones on the 2nd floor! Love your work! 
---
Love it. 
---
I like that I don't have to play an insane amount of hours to get a little bit of his dopamine rush! Settled's content makes me want to start an UIM but then I think about how many hours him (and others) must have to actually play to make the content they do. Plus, I don't really have a main to do more interesting content when grinding the painful levels.
---
Just get rid of the fence between them and make it Port Drayrim 🤷‍♂️

How come the gloves aren’t there? cmon jamflex fix your shit /s

I mean, it's right next to bank so I'm not complaining either.

Fletching with darts last*
---
are you dumb lol? 1/100 is literally a key per task. You can't base your unlucky dry streak as the main source of data. It literally is no different than before. Instead of hitting the table like before, you instead get a key. It is the EXACT SAME. They even said on stream, the konar table now, is on average more gp than the original tables factoring out the stupid brew drops. if you think you would only get 50 keys by 99 slayer you have to be joking, or you just dont understand how many tasks it takes to get 99 slayer at all. If you did konar all the way to 99 you'd literally have HUNDREDS of keys, probably pushing around the 750 mark.

i like this, i really does

Nice

Blue cape swampletics is trash, I miss red cape swampletics.

Instanced bosses, third party clients with a dozen plugins but yea apparently remodelling a useless house is beyond the pale, jfc
---
fuck
---
Of course it's RWT, it's just rubberstamped by Jagex because they have a monopoly on it.
---
Could’ve been a bait but after that he started advertising dice games so I doubt it 
---
No u
---
yeah and also there's a much more casual aspect to trading gold. I mean this guy seems a bit casual. Especially for friends in real life or clans like okay here's $5 gimme 5m. 
---
Wait, no mouse movement method? Please link a video.
---
As far as I'm aware Old School RuneScape exists because Jagex realised there was hype building for a private server running an older version of RuneScape. Regardless of whether the players wanted it or not, it was still Jagex's decision to release it. Polling is like a courtesy.. in my opinion, it does not mean developers can be bullied/teased for trying to bring changes to their game. However, as it is Jagex's right to bring any changes as they see fit in to their game, it is the player's right to bitch about it.
---
I like the familiarity of Old School which is why I play it. I also don't want to play a stale game. I like the changes they have made and are making. Slippery slope arguments are a logical fallacy, so saying that this sets a precedence for them to make larger, unpolled changes is asinine. The argument of precedence exists for legal reasons where decisions are made based on previous legal verdicts. It doesn't exists for players playing a video game.
---
All in all, I don't see why Jagex would turn Old School RuneScape in to another RuneScape 3. That seems redundant and unnecessary. Even if they did, players would just stop playing it like they did last time, and life would still continue.
---
he's also an absolute legend for maxing a UIM then deciding to do it again but harder.
---
The vast majority of the RS soundtrack is better than Sea Shanty 2, lol. It's not even that good of a track compared to some of the fantastic work of other songs.
---
Ill be fine, aslong as they dont go past 09, but to be totally honest this isnt old school anymore its been a totally different game, its just another runescape game!
---
Did you talk to the guy first?
---
Draynor is a big enough town to need its own bank and multiple armed guards in their market but can't afford a small wooden dock to support one of its primary industries?  Who in the world wants to walk all the way to the next town over just to do some fishing when you already live on the coast?
---
Just wanted to say, you're an absolute madlad/legend for maxing an UIM then deciding to make another one but this time make it harder. Keep up the good work.
---
what about xenophobes 
---
How do you plan on killing yourself after such a traumatic event??
---
Who cares?
---
Sometimes I wish I could play this game as much as other people...
---
But then I think, nah. 
---
Because Zuhaar
---
Your lifestyle as you described it wasn’t exactly the behavior I was referring to. You sound more like a weekend warrior as opposed to an every day neet. 
---
However, if you don’t mind, I’d like to share my experience as I think it’s quite similar to yours. The lifestyle you described has been exactly like certain periods in my life. I’m a 25 y/o introverted, sober, young professional. 
---
I found myself playing osrs about 5-6 hrs/day during the week and around 12 hrs on the weekend. This lifestyle was not super detrimental to my life, however I found myself unsatisfied with life. “I really didn’t find anything interesting”. 
---
I pushed myself to try out different hobbies and diversify my life. It wasn’t easy or comfortable at first, but now I can honestly say that my quality of life has hugely improved. Maybe you could do the same? Life is interesting. Amazing. Full of adventure. It’s just up to me to find it. I sincerely hope that you find the same. 
---
remember last time jagex added updates without polls? RS3 sure does...
---
Ooohhhh I'm getting a raging clue
---
Can we just move it back to Port Sarim? It's only slightly less convenient and I think low level quests are supposed to get players adventuring and discovering new places.
---
Also, player retention will be much higher if they hear Sea Shanty 2 early in their game 
---
It's alright, thank you!! 
---
Is that a salty pker I hear? Don’t you have more important things to do, like getting your drool on spades?
---
Seriously though, have you pkers not learned these Reddit’s posts are not salt? We are literally laughing at you guys.
---
Yea im pretty done with this community anyways i dont have alot of ppl in my life and i try to share stuff here and I consistently get shut down and shit on for whatever reason. 
---
1/400*
---
200k/hr is more than you'll get cutting some gems. rs3 is retarded wtf
---
Its an uncommon drop, not too rare.

Idc about being the most efficient lol, I'm still having fun trying to find new ways to skill within the very limited scope of f2p

Imagine being this cute of a noob in 2019
---
What swampletics push out a video soon??
---
and not everything is. It seems to be a combination of changing archaic scenery and the unappealing boat which has already been discussed by moderators and will be updated 
---
They showed the update on stream the day before it went live, so OP decided to prepare a joke in advance.
---
I think it should either be moved to port sarim near the top of the docks
---
Orrrrr turned into a rowboat and moved to the eastern side of wizard tower island
---
It doesn't let you interact with people, it forces you to interact with people.  You have the choice to interact with people all the time you just choose not to.
---
Not too flashy but I kinda dog that, 7/10

Dude do any research you’ll see gold is ~$0.82/m he’s getting ripped off

Considering how hydra are weighted I assume you were doing something stupid like not using Konar or not talking to Ozric before trying to get them on task.

Thanks,

Yessss

It's not a real holiday in most of the world. Meanwhile gay pride events are pretty universal in western countries.
---
Still waiting on my visage
---
I personally respect WHY you created the quest and WHY you chose to put the boat to zeah in draynor - a place highly trafficed by noobs/returning players at early levels may inspire them to investigate.  
---
I think this is a generally good idea which was just not executed with standard levels of integrity.   
---
no more unpolled changes. that shit is getting really scary in recent years tbh. 
---
&gt; _Schwing!_
---
Yeah I'm not getting any work done until I finish reading all these.
---
Your not even that good a track compared to some of the fantastic work of other songs.
---
I wanna see pics of the bottoms. That how you know if they're good. 
---
How can you be so critical of a series that you don't pay any attention to? I don't see any point to your post. "What's the hype about? I don't get it?" People have differing opinions - you don't *have* to get it, especially if you're not even really watching it.
---
Can I please get a link to the blank format? Great potential
---
The chaos rune looks so cute :)
---
Port Sarim docks need a completely clean up. It's way too clunky and if sorted wouldn't need a change of scene for Veos.
---
I just woke up and see this . Beyond grateful ! 
---
VERY unlucky, 798 KC
---
Lmao cya virgins
---
Trump actually won the popular vote, considering over 2 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary
---
I love the new pub.  
---
I guess Lumbridge home tele was meant for situations like this.
---
At work, can't watch yet.  What was your banking method for that profit?
---
Fuck I hate zuhaars so much, I wish a could block him or something to stop seeing his awful drawings
---
Thanks I’ll try tonight should work
---
Pvp community is hated by everyone so that’s a thing. Lame as fuck
---
There is no sandstorm spell on the poll. 
---
😂😂😂😂 Ik and thanks got it
---
Been on and off for 2 years with my acc and I'm 990 total f2p level
---
Well don't tilt then my dude even kbd is like 1/128 Hydra probably around there
---
Reanimate Troll, then shove your Magic Dart into her Flames of Zamorak
---
The song played at the water runecrafting alter.
---
At least you got the pet, I wouldn't be complaining 
---
Bandos and raids are both high level content. 
---
wheres his helmet?
---
You gotta stop crying.
---
Which is hard to do lmao
---
'free report'? i've never had to pay any fees to report anyone.
---
Lol fuck off you absolute cretin oh dear. 
---
I need you in my life.
---
Oh rip
---
Could be a client that takes screenies whenever he levels, and he decided to kill her for a 99 or something.
---
Man it could have been a much different game. At least I know where the dev time went instead of giving us knees in classic. 
---
Do you do any content where you have 3 8 way switches and 3 non cmb items??? Like raids???
---
Who TF snitches out their "friends" like that. If you have a problem with their behavior, turn your fucking head and mind your own shit you little fucking snitch 
---
Olm literally created the new meta single handedly....
---
Do you even know what the fuck you are talking about???
---
Olm added: Dhcb, tbow, ancestral, rigour and augury, claws, and dihns.
---
It has BIS against dragons, BIS against bosses, BIS magic, OP prayers, OP pking spec, OP ranking item.
---
That was absolutely game changing, because of tbow PvM was completely shifted and range became the most overpowered shit in the game. Where as before you had to learn to flick bosses like Sara, now you can 3 shot her.
---
Haha alright. Looking forward to the next one. Really like the concept and the manner you created the video. 
---
Fair enough. Was just wondering
---
That makes me ill. I got a Def pure, 65 Def 30 cb and just getting that where it is made me severely autistic. 
---
They for sure do a better job than the WoW team at blizzard.
---
Only true runescapians know he's talking about his wife.
---
Schuld van de sossen
---
Maybe, but better to report anyways just in case
---
Agree I missed out 2 whole.totems cause I didn't know about loot notification 
---
Wow.. I still can’t believe it’s not butter.
---
I have the same problem even when I’m standing still
---
It's runescape with an oldschool feel in my opinion... Too many updates happening is a problem though. they know updates spike playercount, but too many updates will start to lose players on average... and the more updates you do, the more you chance fucking up a perfectly functioning game
---
I honestly wish I had never found this place. 
---
Or just go to the archer shop in Varrock since its closer to the town square.
---
no home tele?
---
Imagine using PayPal in 2019. That guy is gonna end up getting charged back for many dollars
---
I’m laughing at the degenerates.   Im not even American but republicans are known around the world as laughing stocks 
---
Both should be changed
---
That little blue spot to the east reminds me of Berlin after ww2 lmao
---
Is OT good? I played the demo a very little bit and thought it might be enjoyable but wasnt sure if I should get it.
---
how is that a "complete oversight"? there's been tons of bars added to the game since that miniquest and the vast majority weren't added to the quest
---
This if you skip the fire phase he will shoot 5 like normal if you have fire on the groubd he will shoot one.
---
If i'm not mistaken, duradel is good for money, nieve is good for xp, konar for fun drops? 
---
Usually you pay private investigators to be sure the person you are reporting is guilty
---
Yeah. The worst part is that you can't tap outside of that area either. This is the same case on the regular pixel 3.
---
I’ll just kill myself and put my own head up in my house, checkmate!
---
Ahh, the non-American who delves in American politics and culture. You're so original!
---
That applies to any bot client made in the last decade though, it's not going to go away. The people that are using the referenced plugin know they're breaking the rules and would likely use it on a bot client if Runelite wasn't a thing.
---
Fixed, thank you.
---
What is volcanic ash I don't do fossil island 
---
Never forget that you've truly earned it! Your hard work and dedication to the grind is whats got you here! Keep it up you legend &lt;3
---
[Fucking Randall over here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/LHWtjeY)
---
Bro if that's a steal to you...
---
Yeah you wouldn't put a pub a few feet from the castle. Look at Varrock's pub. Tucked away, at the edge of the slums.
---
Thats not all they do, they also serve as a checks and balances system.  YOU must be new here.  If you don't like it, go play the version of the game without polls and that all the updates were by jagex and only jagex.
---
Yes, this is my first drop in 543 KC, and it's from a *minion*. Still dry at the thicc boy himself :^)
---
not even rs3 would do something this stupid
---
What are you on about? The general store is west of the path. it doesn't go above or below it. That's not changed since rsc 
---
well, the point of the x marks the spot quest is to introduce zeah, a large p2p only area, to f2p and new players. adding HAM members to the area as NPCs who further introduce f2p players to the goblin quest line would make some sense with the original goal.
---
IF the spell comes. Yeah ofc it's safe to use. If it's OP jagex should have done better testing
---
I think it looks more accurate if you flip it over the vertical axis.
---
The NSA has been notified. You’re on a list. 
---
Made me LOL at work holy shit
---
I think you're misunderstanding is that all 1 defence accounts are just pures that are either maxed or not maxed.
---
There is a good variety of builds in the 1 defence category. You could refer to a baby pure as a sub-build in this respect. Other sub-builds could be a edge gmauler, TSotD pure, a low HP rushing build, a low level dbower, f2p range-2h etc. Each build is as unique but has similarities. For example, you wouldn't call a void pure a zerk but could still categorize both as a 'rune pure.' 
---
The sub-builds above usually don't have overheads, nor do they excel deep wild. That's where baby pures have come in.  
---
In addition, baby pures have a very different set of opponents compared to maxed pures. You can 'max' a baby pure, in the sense that maxed pures get picked on by mains deep wildy. Baby pures are relatively safe deep wild.
---
Hope this helps you understand why the name exists. There's lots of videos on creating a baby pure if you're interested in what this build does.
---
Not really, you can stay at hydra for a long time, someone even did over 100 kills in a trip and its been out under a month
---
tl;dr people stop playing and come back years later, so maybe just banned accounts.
---
The dock in Draynor hurts everyones feelings and now you want to turn the general store 90 degrees? What is more nostalgic than Lumbridge.
---
I have a 4 letter name on my iron.
---
Nieve is trash, duradel is best xp in the game and best gp if you go that way. Konar shouldn't even be considered unless you want to farm hydra.
---
Ironman?
---
Do you mean casual Meta or try hard 100k  Xp/hr?  
---
If you're just casually grinding out slayer just use the highest level master and skip/block whatever suits your preference.   
---
im not gonna go into detail about barrage meta
---
Lol, the reference about raids not being nostalgic... I'm not entirely certain you know what nostalgia is. 
---
to be honest the wildy is probably safer on a pvp world than it is on a non pvp world
---
Can I ask why you risk 100 chins at a time (which is frankly quite a low number compared to a lot of people I've seen). Banking takes hardly any time with PoH obelisk or imps in a box so risking 300k seems a lot unless you're doing it for efficient XP rather than profit.
---
Pretty accurate drawing of mod mat k
---
For sure Im not saying it's common, just saying at least with runelite you can be sure you're safe 100% because of the open source nature of the client.
---
What did you have for breakfast?
---
Literally nobody is doing that and you know it. Fanboys like you on the other hand are giving people free passes for contributing to a serious problem that plagues the hobby we all enjoy just because "hurr durr you'd have done it if you were in his shoes". 
---
There's a massive difference between thinking someone is getting off too easily and thinking they should be jailed irl.
---
Whilst I agree that oversimplifying it like this is ridiculous, you don't need a degree in CS or engineering to be a content dev, as is the case for at least Maz and Kieren. The point being, it clearly is something that can be picked up and probably could be taught to someone who has just started computer science at uni (considering that to get there they must have decent maths skills).
---
crash or be crashed...that's how the game goes
---
What kind of idiots actually go to those links tho. I'm astounded by how much traffic they get.
---
there should be private instances
---
Honestly same
---
The update is fine it’s not a big deal, the community sure loves to shit on anything the mods do
---
unpolled changes are one logical fallacy away from MTX
---
It’s ok.  I gave him permission to post this every day for the next 6 days.   He paid for the advertising.   
---
I like that idea. I suppose it doesn’t really matter. Its awesome art 
---
Jesus you really sent out an email "tip" to try and get your buds banned? No wonder you don't have "friends"
---
i did it the day after it got launched (today) applaud me Jagex
---
I agree with you, but its better to focus on improving what we have, we have plenty of content, to much though isnt good! Quality over quantity my friend! 
---
Still too close for my liking.
---
\^This
---
Good sir, the humor of this post is that OP is suggesting the Veos Dock be moved to where Veos already was prior to the update.
---
Genuinely haven't seen anyone rage in capslock
---
Hes a bot jamflex nice bot detection :^)
---
I love your comics. Are you always taking suggestions for new ones? 
---
PvP is very nostalgic for me.
---
It takes me back to a day where people would keep telling me to kill myself on Xbox. 
---
Ahhhh that cancer nostalgia. 
---
Not an iron man never been fan of the mode don't got to play the mode to see the retardation of this update
---
T&amp;V getting the love they deserve.
---
Also that episode of Hot Ones was great. 
---
the system only works if the community isn't full of change resistant autists, sadly that isn't the case
---
Well yeah, Bob's house but where do all the level 2 men and women live?
---
32 games average. 
---
So everything is not canon. I was confused because you contradicted yourself in the first comment.
---
They're terrible for protecting sellers. A friend at work sold this guy a couple magic cards for I think it was $1,400 and the guy disputed the charge and got his money back and kept the cards.
---
Found the person trying to get OP's account
---
I get that this is a joke but thats basically what uims would ask for if looting bag storage was fixed
---
For real, I can respect this.
---
Fuck acting like a game is so important that you have to hold yourself to some arbitrary moral code. It's a game, and real life happens. If I'm in financial trouble and selling my RuneScape bank means keeping a roof over my head, guess I'm starting over. 
---
He chose to use an adbased revenue platform.  If I wanted to get products shoved into my psychi, I'd go watch cable TV.
---
Did you get the gloves yet? 
---
That’s some pulp fiction shit right there. 
---
please this
---
&gt; i only play 30 mins a day so its not fair that people who play more get to get further than me
---
It is fair.  No one cares that you can only play 30 minutes. Play more, don't play more, or quit. 
---
I am from the Netherlands too and i relate with everything you said.  
---
When i were a kid, people often asked me "How did you learn english that well"  
---
I always answered with the same answer every single time "Runescape"  
---
My english is no where near perfect but i am sure that if it wasnt for runescape, i would've never learned the basics as a kid.  
---
But it is though.
---
You may not find it funny, but considering the one you says isn't funny had a higher amount of up votes in less time shows that your argument is baseless.
---
If somethings funny. I'm sorry its funny. You crying that it's not funny just makes it funnier. 
---
In any mode, OP will be at a disadvantage compared to players that can play all day. This is a game in which your progress is largely determined by how much time you can spend on it. OP should probably find a different game to play if this is a problem.
---
And considering your only comments on this website are in this thread and you're strongly agreeing with OP, I suspect you might be an alt account, in which case that really is sad using another account just to agree with yourself.
---
That killed me hahaha.
---
F
---
Snitch
---
Paypal has protected my "virtual goods" from chargebacks numerous times. So, that's bullshit. The reality is most of the people selling things like gold through Paypal have no clue what would even qualify as evidence, they think a screenshot of trading the gold is enough, then get angry at Paypal for their own naivety. 
---
no lifers control the game.... sad
---
This is pretty much the only active community to get feedback on the game - where else are they supposed to get player's opinions from??
---
there
---
Lol salty ironman upset his crafting getting devalued. 
---
Taking the rowboat to a bigger boat out in the water is the best solution.  Looks infinitely more fitting with Draynor's scenery while still being accessible &amp; adding a little new flare to the area without feeling too out of place.
---
Also I know this'll get buried but thanks for the open communication.  I knew like the second the patch dropped that everyone was not going to be okay with Draynor..but I also knew that you guys would be more than willing to change it immediately, just wish the community didn't feel the need to have a fucking meltdown everytime to get their point across, lol.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking, but considering how I've never seen anyone online mention doing rune/addy armour stands it leads me to believe that it's probably just not worth doing over anything else, even for the added smithing exp :\
---
i thnk regular ironman should be made easier too because u have to play for hours if u want to get anywhere good in the game.. kinda sad. U should have 1 free trade per week or something.
---
then maybe instead of jagex changing an entire mode for someone, that person could switch to an account that is more appropriate for their playtime.
---
Nope would be too much like rs3 for this sub, shouldn't have said that.
---
only a complete moron controlled by ideology doesn't understand/remember the reverse being true.
---
either that or your very young.
---
Yeah unfortunately this isn't like true old school where items show up. Part of the ezscape. 
---
It’s worth it
---
I didn't contradict myself.
---
Both games are not the same game and therefore have separate Canon timelines.
---
If you dont have a switch get DQXI for a similar game.
---
Eyyy what's your mother's maiden name
---
Okay but should updates (QoL or otherwise) cater to Ironmen?
---
Furthermore, what use is sandstone right now? Pretty sure its basically worthless.
---
If you want to get your character rolling quickly, do waterfall quest asap. It gets your combat stats to the mid thirties instantly, and it's possible to do right when you start
---
As in, be able to trade items from a regular account to an ironman account? That defeats the whole fucking point of ironman mode.
---
Thanks Mr Gambit!
---
This game honestly sounds like it isn't for you. 
---
I love how Michaelrs showed how to remap the mousekeys with ahk so I can just drool on my keyboard and get like 1m+ xp/hr
---
I want to upvote this for the meme but I dont want to encourage the level of stupidity that OP is encouraging 
---
Farming only skiller? I dunno
---
Lesson learned
---
That would be amazing for us casual players, I was even thinking that we could transfer like only 100 items to our ironmen from our main that way we could get a little bit of a headstart on all these nerd ironmen who play 3+ hours/day.
---
Clue, spade, dds. If you die, try again.
---
Nice try Virtoso.
---
JK, top lads.
---
that little green penis has some huge balls
---
Yup, farther south spying on the tower.
---
I thought about that as I was posting this "Maybe it's an accent trying to be portrayed in text form?"
---
Thanks everyone
---
New quest where the wise old man moves elsewhere as Draynor grows in prosperity when
---
High quality stuff. Very well done
---
Yeah, you can
---
Where is this image from? 
---
Changes like these are what led to rs3. You guys seem to support it though so I guess we're getting rs3 again in a few years
---
And you chose to use a free platform funded by the ads. Can't have your cake and eat it.
---
You said everything that gets added is canon, which cant be true if both games have separate timelines.
---
What do you mean who checks and balances the players? Jagex are the ones who make the polls.  Nothing jagex does not want to implement will ever be implemented.  But with polls, nothing the playerbase does not want will be added.  There are some flaws, but this is the best system to keep horrible ideas that have been put forward out of the game.
---
JOBS JOBS JOBS!
---
The Easter and Christmas events in-game are purely secular. Last time I checked the Easter event included a giant rabbit and eggs, not the resurrection of Christ.
---
Devout boots. The new best in slot boots for prayer bonus 
---
Can someone explain to me the mentality of choosing a challenge mode, then clamouring for """""QOL""""" improvements to gradually strip away that challenge? 
---
Its good.
---
Ya I mean whatever let's you enjoy the game. You could buy the resources for a grind all the way to 99 for all I care, if end game is what you enjoy that's fine. I just get a dopamine rush when I get to a big goal after a huge grind. Like yesterday I finally got my Ava's assembler (took all 50 vorkath kills too lmao, no mercy for me). Felt so good. Don't think when I started RS I would have ever imagined getting this far.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers 
---
People are already asking for HD graphics.  We most likely will not end up with a variant of EOC but it is definitely a slippery slope.
---
I really liked the idea of a larger ship anchored off shore (within render distance) and him taking a row boat into draynor. 
---
Nah, it's a patch of onions xd
---
It boils down to skill set with nhing. 1 def 60 attack with a dds can easily take down a zerk build or even meds. 
---
There isn’t necessarily a right or wrong answer, more so what build you’re comfortable with and what your skill set is. 
---
75 attack gives you the upper hand on all pures from a stat perspective, but if you’re pking at chaos alter or 44s you also open yourself up to getting attack by a higher combat bracket. At the same time 75 attack gives you a better chance of landing specs/whacks on meds. 
---
No shit theyre real. Why would them existing be a problem.
---
Fletching can be done in less than 5 hours. Construction might be the next fastest?
---
You'd have to spend tons of cash on each though.
---
I understand people saying their peace in non question form, but they always ask a question then don't even wait for response.
---
Well, it was
---
They've already released names, you just missed it.
---
Thank bless
---
Ahk are bannable now though
---
Good point I’m buying one now
---
Serious question, why is this worth so much? It has the exact same stats as a dragon pickaxe as far as I know 
---
Seems like 'homophobic' is a pretty terrible word choice then.
---
And what if it was a pro pedophilia event? Is it only a political issue if you’re scared of pedophiles? And even if that’s not the case what does anything regarding sexuality have to do with a medieval fantasy mmorpg?
---
(Excuse me)[https://youtu.be/bfcZacwnVCk]
---
Low alch it, bigger balls 
---
Just watch or read a guide I think they're in the same.spots every time 
---
Yeah for sure! Just need to click 3-4 times until you start double picking and then its set. Works on herbs as well.
---
This is the push I need to learn pvp
---
It should've been the season finale, not premiere imo... The ones since Gordon just haven't nearly high as the bar they set themselves
---
I feel bad now for lowkey throwing shade sorry bro you're a nice guy
---
The imbues were not needed to begin with. 
---
And they unknowingly created the easy path to 99 CB skills for all. 
---
Could be rhetorical and they don't care about your answer or they're just dumb. 
---
oh shit lol whoops
---
yeah saw later that ring of suffering is bis apperently, pretty weird, but i can afford it, i'll get anguish aswell, crystal shield is also a possibility, i'll try it tommorow with those changes!
---
I'm f2p. I don't have that many places I can go, but I really treasure what I have. That cozy little house was one of my favorite places in-game. Now I can never go back :(
---
I personally use dwh so I can save an inv space. I get 5-6 kills per trip so every space counts.
---
I highly recommend woox walking with the DHL. It's easy IMO because the attack animation pulls the arm back before striking, and thats when you click on the tile behind you. Then you click on vorkath when your character turns 180 degrees.
---
Do you mind elaborating on the fletch one? Ive been doing yew longbows
---
It was one of the reasons, yes. The once hardest 99 was turned into an afk-able mess.
---
idk from 93-96 slayer i banked 4k points alone in prep for hydra
---
As long as it requires the elite desert diary.
---
Quite a bit, I’m doing it on my pure at the moment and I’ve reached 77 so far and I’ve gone from 97% scales to 50% in just those 2 levels, max range bonus for my level too minus an Anguish.
---
A masterpiece certainly, but not up to the standard of Mudskipper Melody.
---
Bad meme is bad. 
---
Yeah but remapping mousekeys using ahk is not - or even if it is it is it looks the exact same as mousekeys to jagex
---
The pub is a complete non issue. It's fine. It being where it is literally has zero impact on anything within the game. The dock may want to be moved because of its proximity to dark wizards that can kill low level players. 
---
To vote you merely have to be 18, breathing for 18 years isn't a lengthy achievement any person would boast about, now if voting was changed to a bachelors degree education minimum that would be a requirement.
---
They should have known that would happen with all the people running up to their attic and fight the same wizard every time...
---
it's a significant buff though, from 2k buckets/hour to ~8-10k/hour
---
the mining exp alone is enticing enough, it really doesn't need to be 4-5x faster
---
Okay?
---
&gt;Reply
---
It's not in there yet, and it hasn't been polled, so I don't care. People ask for stupid shit all the time.
---
I care
---
yeah, but 80M tho, could sell something for it, but really don't want to atm, i'll will probably buy it in a week or so, ancient staff was pretty effective too tbh, but idd had some annoying splashes... 
---
biggest problem was i used so much brews at the beginning when discovering the new monsters.. i hope to get to wave 60 next time. 
---
Congrats!
---
Later Virgins
---
ToB &amp; CoX are instanced? They have BiS across the board.
---
Need help boofing it?
---
Ignore the trolls, grats on the nice reward! If you didn't have a lot before, this will open up so many PvM opportunities for ya.
---
No problem, just trying to get some understanding. 
---
Hell yeah keep up the great work.
---
Thank you!
---
Just beautiful really.
---
Oh boy...  
---
SGS definitely, the prayer restore helps a ton. Anguish would be a big help as well. Kodai if you can afford it, the extra mage acc isn't important but the % damage and free water runes (extra inv spot) are. Also, justiciar helm &gt; veracs helm... But that'd be the last gear upgrade you'd wanna focus on. You can ditch the spectral, range def &gt; mage def (Mages hit harder, so pray from mage and tank the first range hit or two til you get the rhythm down for flicking or get spawns under control). Not really sure Ahrims is worth bringing, the nibblers have negative mage defense and you should only be using blood barrage to heal when you have spawns under control and can protect versus all incoming damage so yeah (might be better off bringing a few more pots and dropping them, then stripping down at the start of each wave for nibblers).
---
As for tips... Practice. Once you get the hang of the waves you should be able to get to wave 50+ without using any potions at all (with an SGS and proper prayer ticking/flicking). Use potions as needed to learn but don't get into the habbit of brewing constantly, you'll need those brews. If you get an SGS, don't wait for specs. You'll just burn yourself out with 3 hour attempts. Use addy or rune darts while first learning to cut down on your supply cost, but definitely switch to dragon once you have the hang of it. 
---
Also, even for a learning run you look really really low on restores. Prayer flicking/ticking is practically essential, ESPECIALLY if an SGS is out of your price range. With an SGS you really shouldn't ever have to use a restore for prayer until you get to Jad, but you'll definitely want to have a few restores for Jad / 3x Jad / Zuk or you're going to be in for a rough time. Also, don't use range potions until the late waves (50-60+, personally I saved 2 full bastion potions for Jad/3x Jads/Zuk and didn't use any during the waves) but definitely bring at least one since the DPS increase means you have a smaller window of time to mess up and die.
---
And how many times have people attempted to bury bones in that attic after killing said wizard?
---
Thanks!
---
These brainlet images are just too funny lmfao
---
The suggestions of "Put this here because my forgetfulness is inconvenient" are some of the most frustrating on here. 
---
That would be a bot
---
1376/2277

can confirm worth it

Retoast

Magic is the weakest of the three in the combat triangle in both PvP and PvM. On average, you will risk more than your opponent meaning unless you rarely die, you will most likely lose money. So you'll be risking more and it'll be really hard to hit anyone deep wildy using mage bc black d hide has such good magic defense. So it's just harder to make money/have a positive k/d using magic as a PKer. This is coming from someone who started playing again to make a maxed mage account. Kind of depressing tbh. Range tank seems to be most popular atm, its really flexible with spec weapons/setups so that's what I'd recommend currently.

Not sure how it is on your desktop, but there is usually a Volume Mixer which lets you change volume per program instead of just the whole system. But yah, there is no better ingame volume control; just the four options of off, loud, really loud, and too loud.
---
This happened to me last week, your email has been hacked. Do you get a email saying your account is locked and they give you a temporary password to log in and open a ticket with account info on? 
---
Getting downvoted even though you made a valid point. Of course no one has replied, they are more upset that you don't want a pride event in game than they are willing to actually give an argument. 
---
I don't even care if there is a pride event or not but the fact it's homophobic not to and people upvote that notion and downvoted you for disagreeing is actually disturbing to me. We keep taking extreme words like homophobia and racism and changing them to be more broad so they apply to more people so more people feel responsible. I shit you not I'm in college and have a friend who believes all white people are racist, unironically. Doesn't matter who you are. You're white? You're racist.

Welcome to osrs

Windows lets you individually control runescape client and chrome...just open volune mixer
---
How do you think you calculate the EHP of a player?   
---
If we assume that their Hitpoints level is more-a-less their raw Hitpoints and their armor is calculated as their Defence level then that fits the calculation 'somewhat'.
---
But where does their shield/hull resists come into the formula? 
---
Yes but if people have the option to make it easier, they will. They just all want to be like the streamers they see doing high level pvm without doing any grinds.

Good ol days back in enville amiright
---
Can confirm. 87 mining and I averaged 287k/hour yesterday. Peaked at 431k in one hour thanks to some luck with rune. 
---
I love how you’re getting downvoted for the obvious. If you don’t want to die, don’t go in the wilderness. Theres a big red sign that says so right when you cross that ditch
---
I just dont understand why there needs to be a new dock in the first place, can't we just have the quest ending at Veos's ship in Port Darin?
---
My best tips after level 2 accounts to quest cape and two other alts over my runescape career. Quest, dont waste your time skilling until you need to for quests. Look up a "osrs quest guide slread sheet", thats if your trying to progress asap.
---
Runescape is a time consuming game. If you can't put the time in then naturally you won't make much progress very fast as opposed to someone that can put 16 hours a day into the game. Why should you, who plays 1 hour a day, be on the same playing field as someone who puts in 10+ hours a day? That's just unfair for them isn't it?

Amen brother, those were dark times indeed.

Definitely give it a try when you can fund one dude.  Also, not all pures are expensive.

Lol that's such an old photo. 
---
LOL true actually
---
Don’t argue with gatekeepers. It’s getting passed with flying colors anyway. They can do their shit boring methods for 20 hours and we can enjoy the aspects of the game as well. 
---
The whole point is having to grind kq the regular way to unlock the better method if you want the pet
---
Imagine being an adult and typing this
---
If you don't enjoy the game, don't play...

What are you on about, agility is one of the most rewarding skills in the game
---
He is right about that
---
I don’t get the big deal it’s not like people go to draynor for anything anyways
---
It's nearly impossible to die with a dinhs so it doesn't even matter. If you just run to hobgoblins a little west you're instantly safe unless they have 20 people.

I’ll have to try it tonight for myself because I’m seeing so many varied numbers. Thanks for checking 
---
This is pretty good lol
---
Isnt 44 eagle eye and 45 the mage prayer?
---
I miss those amazing quests. So many good quest will never come to osrs just because the devs don't want them. It's one of the reason why I play both game.

Nice...
---
hey im just gonna start playing this mmorpg known for being very grindy, on a more difficult mode, but i'd prefer to reach the end game on day 1 because i cant play as much as others so just make everything fast as fuck please thanks
---
thats definitely a lot of sand pretty quickly. 
---
the goal of collecting sand oughta be a factor as well, come to think of it. it doesn't make the glassblowing grind itself any faster though, does it?
---
How did you actually pull off such a beautiful edit?
---
Yeah... because an NPC selling 3rd age and dragon pickaxes wouldn't effect supply and demand at all /s which, you know, affects the whole community.
---
More addictive than the dopamine rush
---
majority at that time wanted RS2 back(2008-2011 era) and not actually OSRS, but Jagex "didn't" have any other versions saved, so it ended up being OSRS. That's why we are seeing them recreating everything good from 2008-2011 right now. 
---
Problem is, if the shortcuts don't require diaries, suddenly the diary rewards seem a little lackluster.
---
They never converted a shortcut to require a diary. All the ones that do were made thinking it was a reward for a particular diary.
---
&gt;so you dont have to grind as much for things on your ironman
---
See stop pretending your argument is about game integrity. This is about you bring jealous that you had to grind longer than new ironmen. Ironman was never about having insanely long grinds, that was just a symptom of the game when ironman was released. Ironman is about being self-sufficient. It will still be a chore to get sand compared to a normal account. Ultimately the mode has to be balanced to a point where it's grindy but not ridiculous so you can actually reach end game content within 18 months. 
---
You clearly play ironman merely to impress others as you can easily set your own rules on what content you use. You should focus on doing what is fun and gratifying for yourself and not what others are doing. 
---
Yes, I said in my first comment to get 45 if you wanted them. 
---
Glad to see someone with stats like this and not 80 in every skill. Don’t worry about your total level
---
Your 99 strength will make doing slayer and many quests much easier, congratulations! 
---

Yeah, thanks, I tend to agree! I already have a DHCB for my main when I go for Vorkath pet. =) Now I'll have a pair.

Why dont u deiron and buy it from ge?
---
Is this a troll?
---
Try harder? You're attacking an argument I never made.
---
Pretty much everything I saw about PvP gets downvoted. I literally mentioned that spite voting reflects the maturity of our community and that got downvoted into oblivion. Kind of ironic actually.
---
But yeah I totally agree. 
---
INB4 the "ohh the wilderness is FORCED content and Jagex literally makes me go in how unfair" comments

Isn't that runelite

nope im just an idiot

You’re not getting your money back. You got scammed. If they refunded every person that got scammed people would exploit for free money.

I usually just pray melee, granted 98 mage/99 def is enough to defend against Sara strike.

Mid level, nice construction level for your stage though, most people tend to overlook it and it's the most useful thing in the game. 
---
Best mmo devs 
---
Didn't crunch numbers too hard on this but about half the cost for bp but 8 times faster when using black chins.
---
This may be super off as I did msb(I)+rune arrows or rcb+broad bolts for most of 92-96. Did quite a bit of blowpiping for 96-98.5 and the black chins for 98.5-99. if you can make 1m go/hr I'd say it's way more worthwhile to chin. I somewhat regret wasting 30hr not using black chins for the last 2m exp (all my bank could probably afford.
---
Sounds like a stat people would easily boost
---
Im doing it with regular void, magic shortbow (i), rune arrows, anguish, archers (i), and assembler. I was getting 70k exp/h at lvl 80 range, and now I'm getting 80k exp/h at 90 range. I like it because it's much cheaper than bp and very afk.
---
Well, this is more of a mistake in a shop than a mistake in skilling. It is like accidentally buying 10 Gold Leaves when upgrading your PoH for PvM. But the extra Gold Leaves aren't just wasted items; you can still repurpose or sell them. The same can't be said of Torstol Potions. And like I said, the punishment is wasting 200 gp per herb; the herb doesn't need to be made less useful on top of that.
---
Okay I've heard way too much about this series to avoid it any longer. Starting episode 1 now.

You're describing a sort of line where jagex doesn't need to ask the players if it's a good decision. I don't disagree with this but I think with precedent this is far past that line. Ignoring the green pixel change which in itself is plenty, jagex polls cosmetic changes all the time. "Should we change the look of x item to be more consistent with y". Shit like that is common. So saying "if anything there's a precedent to not poll everything" is twisted. Yes they don't need to poll everything, however there is clearly a line where things should be polled. The argument is this is one of those things. You don't get to call that entitled because ultimately we decide that line, not jagex. That's why I said you were white knighting the devs. You are treating it like because they develop the game they don't need to ask us for permission to do things. However, the game was made on the premise that we have a say in things and where the line is drawn where they don't need to ask is dictated by the community, not them. So if everyone on this sub wants to shit on them for not polling this they are completely within their rights to do so. It's not entitled at all. It's letting jagex know they aren't comfortable with this line being crossed when it comes to not polling.
---
Wait since when are people saying wildy should be safe? 
---
Move it further south

Lmfaoooo. This comment makes it even better. You don’t know how to screenshot on your phone??? Are you 87 years old or just a fuckin spade pker???

Alright i promise i wont be a fucking retard xD
---
so should doing my clues or nah?
---
You can repurpose torstol potions, make zammy brews; they have niche use and give more experience than you'd get making a super combat potion
---
Yeah I'm not really into it

I shouldn't need to warn you that sexualizing real people in OSRS entire is not allowed, but sexualizing real people in OSRS entire is not allowed.

Hello brother welcome to oldschool.runescape.com where updates are ironically posted about runescape 
---
The g maul is just ridiculously OP on 1 defense, so it will win most of the time. As a range only you're going to want to take advantage of dragon thrownaxes to combo with a spec weapon like ballista or dark bow. Dragon/Arma C Bow with dragon bolts is good too and let's you have four or more potential KO spec opportunities per fight, see Torvestas rigour tank videos as a reference.
---
But you were probably going to keep dying to maul as it's the absolute meta for pure fighting until high 70s combat. 
---
Small favor
---
Copypasta
---
Runes are grey, not cookie colored. Not impressed. ;p
---
Awesome! Nice rare drops tho man, I'm at 800kc and dont have any unique drop.. I think its just about luck..
---
That confirms it though?
---
^^^^^^^^/s
---
I have made around 400-500k passively flipping while doing slayer today! :) thx
---
6t seems to be okay tbh
---
Doesnt need to be reworked just needs to be completely removed and imbues moved to a new source.
---
First of all, there are definitely a few hundred thousand subscribers to osrs.
---
Second, I never really meant to insinuate that the sub controls the fate of the game entirely and alone. You can't deny that it has massive bearings on the direction of the game, though.
---
What do u mean one opponent? The one video where 3/5 are alfie I had to cash in on the clickbait for my rising YouTube career Lul but the rest are different people each clip I believe. And I initially reacted the way I did because at least in counterstike it took me like 3500 hours before I could even brush shoulders with people who were playing for years so I think that RuneScape isn’t so punishing even though I believe there is incredible depth to the point I haven’t nearly discovered all of its intricacies.
---
Yes she did. They're clearly just stacked. There's 150k fires and 30k natures there.
---
Yes that is it indeed
---
Jesus lul....
---
Why would they attack people with gear? They would die. Defeats the purpose.
---
Oh, this was a request by someone. Should i take it down?
---
The real question is who buys a 3rd age pickaxe anyway
---
Nah it could work pretty well as long as they don’t fight back. And most dont
---
I never said they couldn't be repurposed; just that it makes a less useful item. With how rare Torstol is, you shouldn't have your entire stack ruined because you forgot its potions work differently to every other herb.
---
Also, there is no reason an Unf Potion shouldn't work the same as an Herb for Super Combats. It is still the same ingredient, just in a different form but one still suitable for potion making.
---
That’s quitter talk double down spend another 50k you will break even eventually.
---
Then why are adblockers allowed on YouTube..? Lol
---
When everyone comments on the cookies but not a single person says "Happy Birthday". Happy Birthday, buddy!
---
I’ve had 5 hydra tasks and only used about 300 points to get them
---
I really think the devs should really look into expanding the cold war and sea slug quest lines in the future. Both were really enjoyable and the stories are just left unfinished, despite implying massive and urgent gielinor-wide conspiracies lol
---
I mean dog, not finising the school I went to is nothing rare, in fact unfortunately common. I could finish whatever shit you probably went through in my free time.
---
Ahh sweet. So if you’re on arceus spellbook, does that mean you can’t use magic at barrows? Or are there damage spells on it? I’m out of the loop for both barrows and magic from the last few years..
---
Really? I thought thought Christmas events were done around Easter.
---
Well, I already removed it. So it is up to you if you want to take it down further.
---
I’m wet
---
I've been playing for like 3 months now and he just caught up to my combat level
---
90 crafting is just a tedious grind that you have to do first before you get to the fun stuff in order to achieve maximum efficiency.
---
I honestly wouldn't mind if they made it afker/faster since crafting doesn't really have useful perks to anyone but ironmen(aside from some diary rewards perhaps?).
---
Especially if you're an 1 def ironman like me, that 15 def would be a huge help, but doesn't really make much difference for mains, so it's one of the reasons why I've not been motivated to play RS cause I know I have to get that out of the way which im not interested in doing until it's afkable.
---
Besides, they gotta add new jewellery to the game at some point, there's nothing wrong in making amulets which are going to be obsolete anyway a bit more convenient to get.
---
Looking juicy!
---
congrats! I'm currently only 1 step away from mine as well! (lvl 5 all roles at BA) It must be very satisfying. I can't wait.
---
Because it's a lower level method than granite?
---
clearly no1s agreed since they split up
---
They should add her corpse face down in the swamp.
---
Use a trident! No spellbook needed.

Do you have a reason for these things needing to have a use?

I love that the OSRS devs are open to finishing questlines. I'd really like to see Mahjarrat after the upcoming elf quest, though.

Lol people were actually upset about this? I thought we were just kidding around...

Haha ja

Was this Drake polled?

red chins are more efficient unless you can make like 5m+/hr

Eh, to each their own I guess. I kinda like the drama portion of this sub though since it happens around once a month and usually the memes are killer. I mean clearly someone else agrees cus this thing got gilded lmao. Oh well though no biggie have a good one
---
So a bit of a backstory to this image, this guy started half killing black demons at lvl 6 wildy, so i was finishing them off, he has the audacity to say i'm half killing them, i explained that it's completely pointless of me to do it as i'm an ironman, he then starts trying to try my account stats (even tho im a higher total at a lower level...) so i told him, come to level 7 wild and stand here. I'll bring my maxed pure and see how you feel then, he stayed in level 6 saying you're just going to get a friend to come, so i told him he'll know it's mine by the usernames, and this is the response i get when i finally turn up with my pure, he also didn't dare to come in lvl 7. PVMers can be toxic too...
---
&gt; longevity 
---
&gt;filling buckets of sand
---
I mean, why do you think people do it through livestreams or skype/discord/etc.? Hard to ban someone for scamming when all the game's analytics point to it looking like a donation.
---
yup, having a trident means you don't need spells, and with prayer I don't need to freeze the melee brothers so they can't hit me
---
Ironman mode has no place in an MMO
---
Soloscape is killing this game

You want a fucking parade and everyone cheering your name?

Been around for a while but I think NH really became the meta when f-keys were released making it much easier for everyone to get overheads up in time.

house tab &gt; pool &gt; ge tele (varrock portal) is what I always do. Probably not closest to the bank but I like banking at GE incase I need to restock something. 
---
Are you sure you were cooking trout? People usually drop salmon and trout. Salmon requires 25 cooking.
---
Trout is the cooked version. You can only cook raw trout.
---
Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I think the shitty grind is the draw of Ironman, when I got my first glory from crafting it was made all the sweeter by the hours and hours of grinding. Just my two cents
---
Are you mentally ill? I said not as many i didnt say noone does cox. Also something everyone wants to own will never drop too significantly. 
---
Interesting question! My [account's stats](https://i.imgur.com/E7sllTF.png) are very similar to yours (less 70 construction)!
---
Awesome! That’s the key. Start some flips, get a task, knock it out, and finish the flips. If you have profitable tasks it doesn’t hurt either
---
Same, idk how ppl don’t like the way it looks. The only reason I don’t play ra3 is basically because it doesn’t feel like an accomplishment to play when ppl pull out a wallet. I stopped playing soon as AoC and the ridiculous prize wheel thing came out

Get this image out of my head now

This is the first idea I've seen that actually makes any sense. I vote yes.

I feel like this most recent Seth Meyers one was actually incredible, such a genuine guy and funny too

My favourite part of the Elite Desert Diary is that it requires you to talk to Kq Head in your POH, but unlocking that shortcut to Kalphite Queen is pretty much the only reason I even want to get the diary done (besides having all of them done one day), so I can farm the Kq head faster.
---
Feels bad when the only thing you want from the diary is locked behind the diary itself...

With the addition of the new free to play quest "X Marks the Spot" Veos has come to Lumbridge in search of something, he has parked his boat at the newly installed cock in Draynor Village next to the market.

Now you are just exaggerating. There are plenty of viable methods for RC. There are none for collecting sand. This is a great update that still makes you work for sand.
---
Lmao. I didn't even see that it autocorrected to straight. Haha. Supposed to be Strength.

I have never had to use that feature. Now I know how. Get a grip.

I dig it

Looks reaaaaaaally similar.

Any advice for getting into Eve? It seems incredibly fun.
---
To be fair, the only way to make a port look like an actual port and not a random dock is for it to be "busy". Port Sarim is supposed to be *the* port servicing two of the largest Kingdoms in game, it would lose impact if it didn't look overpacked.
---
Rimming Jail, this shit is hilarious. nice work
---
Oh haha I don't know why I assumed that they were all the same person. Do you have an account for PKing? I'll sub if there is going to be more than tourney world PKing. One of the best reasons to PK is the risk vs reward system in play.

No this is terrible

Are you an idiot. The drop table was broken. If anything he was the one who recognized it was dumb strong. It needed a nerf...
---
Damn nice! Had 2 in 10 kills today. Very happy
---
So just like.. Tell yourself you're not ever going to buy a certain item off the G.E and hunt it as a drop instead. 
---
Tell yourself to do whatever training method you enjoy regardless of how efficient it is.
---
I spent a ton of time at mage training arena, and I got 75, 84, 85 and 99 agility at wilderness agility course on my accounts, I maxed my mains melee stats doing a bunch of random creatures but mostly wilderness ankous. I for a while didn't allow myself to buy gear, only get it from drops, skills or pvp.
---
I'm pretty sure you can get all the benefits of being an ironman except like, not having to do things like fill buckets of sand unless you want to and feel it adds to your experience by just playing a regular account, so if you don't want to fill buckets of sand against your will.. Why are you an ironman?
---
According to demographic analytics on my youtube channel, 33% of views are from US, 17% UK 10%Canada/Netherlands (almost identical)

we get it you got crashed
---
I’ve heard he was going to jail but don’t know what he did. Messed with a 12 year old or something?
---
The drop table was not balanced. So it’s quite good it was changed, aside from the fact many others were voicing concerns about it as well... not just faux 
---
your "runescape" account isnt an osrs account. its a runescape account. you login to rs3 and osrs with the exact same account. if you buy a membership on osrs you will also be a member on rs3.

I was over exaggerating for a reason, but i have personally seen threads about each and every example i used in some way shape or form. Not word for word obviously. 
---
Hcim in the wild, literally just the other DAY someone made a suggestion that its unfair because they arent able to do wildy content. And he said pretty much exactly what i wrote. 
---
If ironmen get their own personal instance for a certain boss or event, then *everyone* should. I play "solo" and im not an ironman..i dont like crashers either? 
---
By "equal exp gains" I meant more so as equal opportunity for exp gains.. So that could be a lot of different things. Again, i was clearly being a smartass with the way i wrote these.
---
I've also seen RECENT posts about drop rates being improved for ironmen and look at the whole bucket of sand shitstorm going on lol.. Essentially its similar. 
---
Once Again, i was exaggerating on purpose however i have actually seen what I used as examples be listed as real suggestions. Certain people DO feel that way. And i need to remind EVERYONE that YOU CHOSE THAT GAME STYLE. The wilderness one is the biggest that fucking kills me. The point of being a goddamn hcim is because ITS DANGEROUS. You can choose to do wildy or not. Hell even b0aty does a fair share of wilderness clues and activities and hes got a huge target on his back.

osbuddy says it hasn’t been traded in 3 weeks on the ge. If you do sell it, hopefully it won’t take you too long.
---
That doesn't work for a few different reasons but a very important one is that Ironmen have access to ironmen only shops and certain areas, I think ironmen get access to a corp beasts lair that doesn't have normal accounts on it but I haven't done corp in a dang ol minute.
---
Spam them on twitter, thats the best bet.
---
So you don't PK yourself duh
---
So you wear the serp helm and just attack them and they go down?
---
this isnt about sand lol, its about the continous updates almost every week that make ironman so much easier/faster (see contracts)
---
It's the crafting meta for ironmen and this raised the rate of collecting buckets per hour from ~1800 to ~23,600 so yes it's quite game changing.
---
Agreed it would be great to see quest lines be completed, especially since the quests you mentioned were very creative!
---
Probably Exilent

Rs3 players wouldnt notice it anyway, they don't go outside of prif

Would be a shame to move Veos since he's in a convenient spot atm and, some new players already did the quest. Imo, keep him there, but make the dock smaller and tweak colour a bit

Mining is much more enjoyable in RS3 - not keen on the smithing though. A similar system on OSRS would help deal with bots hogging all the damn ores. Equally I find the fact we can cook automatically but cannot add logs onto a fire weird.  manually making rows of fires and swapping ores should net you more exp, but it would be nice to have an auto option to make the skills more like Cooking and Fishing.

For the Cold War? Good.

IIRC he went to jail for racketeering and something to do with firearms; both unrelated to his lust for underage women.
---
I dont have a Twitter but I guess I'll make one if it's the only way that's way too much to just let go
---
A cock in draynor would be very nice tbh
---
These are really the best part of any change in the game.
---
Can you offer any extra details that can help us point out to you exactly how you got hacked and which phishing link you clicked on?
---
I dont have a Twitter but I guess I'll have to make one if it's the only way that too much too let go
---
That one was interesting as well! 
---
Hahahahahahaha wow devs are killing their own game hahahaahahahahahahaha
---
Real talk I canceled wow for osrs because of endless frustration from the direction wow is going. And because of where osrs is going. And because of the construction green pixel.

While you make a post crying about a guy “harassing” you at the ge

My friend, this is important.

But do that take people to other continents? A boat that sea worthy doesn't have a shallow enough hull to be there

Haha neither do I (although sometime I wish I could), regardless she sounds like a hell of a gal, cheers 
---
Why is it more effective than dragon? 
---
I was using the pest control teleport for getting to Zeah and now I can't do that anymore. smh
---
What was the method?
---
Gotta love ogres
---
Cold war is my favorite quest. Well DS2 probably is my favorite but it's a close tie with cold war. More scheming penguins pls.
---
All the memelords complaining about spadehunters. They don't explicitly say it, but that's the read between the lines. 
---
Unfortunately, no :/ what was it? 
---
The times for grammar is over
---
See if I was your gf it would have been 5 fire runes and 1 nature. Alch yourself boiii
---
Um... 
---
Legacy mode didn't at all compare to pre-eoc, and new content added in rs3 is balanced around actually using eoc.
---
Once you are on your third time through lmk
---
Basically you could you could equip any weapon using any weapon stance, like holding a dcim like a godsword
---
What? thats one of my favorites.
---
Fair point.

Good luck with it!

Yes.

Yo that’s peak efficiencyscape

That's not how I read it.

&gt; Should Unfinished Torstol vials be able to **be used in place of a clean Torstol** when making Super Combat potions? No creatures drop these items and the potion created from the unfinished vial is rarely created by players. Most of the unfinished potions are made accidentally via Zahur in Nardah.
---
"in place of" sounds like they're replacing it, instead of making it "in addition to" as I intended. I don't know, maybe /u/JagexGambit could clarify this for us?
---
Amethyst
---
No because there are stamina potions
---
Thanks all, ive now discovered volume mixer thanks to you people i am not no longer suffering from ear pain when i cast fire bolt
---
I play in portrait mode anyway. Makes one handed playing/playing in public easier. 
---
Ohhh thats why the picture of Tiananmen Square is on the front page.
---
Think you commented on the wrong comment, homie
---
&gt;If ironmen get their own personal instance for a certain boss or event, then *everyone* should. I play "solo" and im not an ironman..i dont like crashers either? 
---
Ironmen can't really fight back against Crashers.
---
You do 1 damage to an NPC that an Ironman is attacking and they can't get the drop.
---
On a main, you just outdamage them and you still get the drop.
---
You can see how getting crashed is a bigger problem for Ironmen.
---
They dont pick up loot because bandit camp is an afk training spot
---
As I said elsewhere in this thread, PKers are absolutely allowed to kill whoever they want, but people are also allowed to think it's a bit of a dick move to kill an unarmed clue hunter on the 0.1% chance that they might be carrying a cash stack. Its not unreasonable for the people you killed for nothing to develop a distaste towards PKers. If anything the main reason people vote down many PKing updates is not just because they don't like PKers, but also because buffing PKing spells and equipment makes their activities in the wilderness more difficult. A PvMer voting to buff entangle is like a PKer voting to make it so the person initiating a fight in the wilderness gets a disadvantage or something. You can't expect people to vote against their own interests, especially if that means voting to help people they hate
---
Is there a big difference between the two besides prices?
---
They aren't holidays though, they're political demonstrations
---
Just use osrs.wiki for quest guides and general information. 
---
There are also lots of excellent guides on YouTube you can just search the name of the quest and osrs and lots will show up.
---
SlayerMusiq has some really well made guides that are easy to follow.

We’re gonna need more alchs

Yo, fix the title. It's "\[Terrible Opinion\]".
---
Yeah but then he would have to introduce himself as 'Swampletics, the Swampletics-Locked Ironman'.
---
I think he's implying that you should have done slayer to 99 instead of afking at nmz
---
This is brilliant lmao 
---
you haven't been paying attention then

I’m thinking lighthouse dags. I don’t think the ogre spot is multi

That’s true. Hasn’t got the same ring to it!

Now all I gotta do is physically therapise my hand and start hitting the weights again and we’ll be skulltricking Venezuelans in no time

Mage is really easy to train if u have money, and would be the firdt thing I do to get those teleportation spell for ease of travel
---
After that you can train your combat all the way to rune

If you're thinking ahout going member, wood cutting and smithing are a must if u wanna do fletching

Doric’s quest for the smithing xp, get your 40s for tube weapons and armour, and work your way towards Dragon Slayer

ooooo wah xd
---
Sorry, meant to reply to the guy asking. Important that everyone knows
---
Easy, make the heads a certain color depending on the total level of the hcim during the death. So under 1k total wouldn’t be that great. Wouldn’t be a lot of boosting if you had to get like 1800 total to get a cool looking one
---
Justifiably so. 
---
Looks like shit if you ask me. We went from pixelated, somewhat medieval looks to a whoville cartoon lookalike with rubber bands for arms. OSRS is purty.

For some reason I immediately thought about the Fresh Prince of Bel air tune...

What if I forget to refill both? Then I need to bring a third one, but what if I forget to refill all three? Soon I'll be taking 28 ectophials, without even inventory space for my farming tools.

Efficient slayer uses duradel. He's better than nieve even for casual slayer, and even if you don't have karamja gloves 4. Nieve is nowhere close to duradel.

## QoL Month Poll: Combat
---
## January 31 2019 
---
The schedule for Combat Week is as follows:
---
* In-game poll live by 01/02
---
* In-game poll closes 05/02
---
* Week 2 - Skilling Blog live by 06/02
---
* As many of the combat updates given in game from 08/02
---
I  make sure you know they have already updated question 6-7-11. 
---
On the Shore or Tree Gnome Villiage Party are my go to's
---
Oof are you? I'm not sure where and how you trained your RC? Lava runes at lvl 23 can give 65k-70k xp/hr. It's no fun and loses money, but is an option. At level 50 you can get more than 32k xp/hr at Ourania alter. That goes all the way up to 43k xp/hr by 80! And last but not least at 77 you can do blood runecrafting for 37k-40k xp/hr!   
---
Now I assume this is all jokes here of course but some useful information for those who may never have looked in to it. ;)
---
Fake news, infernal pick is 2kg.
---
i disagree. osrs has a unique art style and is consistent with it while rs3 is like uncanny valley and the characters dont match the enviroment. 
---
That would be even worse idea. 100 knowledge players aka most popular or the best so only high lvl content and the sweatiest nerds with ticking every skill nty. 
---
It’s actually 95 and completion of the Varrock Elite Diaries 
---
Should also show cause of death so if someone dies to Corp is says that they died to Corp
---
This idea is brilliant 
---

I really liked 2008 HD, RS3 changed how too many items look. Better technical graphics, but everything is over stylized. I like my armor looking like regular armor, not whatever RS3 has.
---
Twitch prime offers free 14 day membership 
---
What would you say the profit/h and total profit was?
---
I kinda thought that them doing the Konar table without talking to us and then saying they'd involve the players more would have stopped this from happening. This is feels like the same sort of situation, doing something without polling it directly and then retroactively making a change after feedback comes in. They said at that time they'd involve the community more during the development process.
---
"In retrospect, we realise that a better loot table could have been designed by working with the community during the development process. Following these changes, we'll look to work with you all to see exactly what finer tuning is required and commit to involving you all with this sort of thing in future. With your help, we'd like to make sure we get this right as soon as possible."
---
I'm F2P as well. Wanna be friends in-game?
---
Is that real?! I'm kinda leery of clicking twitch links for osrs
---
Wizards tower is better in rs3 imo. 
---
legacy mode exists 
---
Not sure (should have checked honestly, but wanted to start buying oak planks with the cash), however, think I made around 80m odd, with the profit per hour being like 700k-800k per hour
---
can you get twitch prime for free or?
---
Fired for hacking accounts 
---
oh duh. then yep he's definitely fixed the helm by now
---
What movie?
---
It really, really isn’t. Shit feels like a mobile game. Get Xenoblade Chronicles 2 if you’re looking for a switch RPG
---
I vote moving it closer to the bridge to wizards tower, or changing it to a rowboat. I like both of those.
---
If you want to do only range pking, yes. Make sure to quest the defence experience so you can use quest gear (barrows gloves, heavy ballista, ava's assembler, etc).
---
Eh better to get with the program honestly than search for that such don't exist lmao...
---
Ouch not even ha ur a savage

in order:

Yea just remember to cancel it. 
---
main or iron?
---
It's been depressing, but i'll still do it.
---
You should really get on the slayer grind first lol
---
Lol the imp standing next you makes it look like you got wings.
---
From a game mechanic perspective, it’s retarded to get mad for the game to be working as intended. The wilderness is for killing other players. Every time you go in the wilderness you literally have to click to acknowledge you understand that, and are ok with it. 
---
If you don’t want to get pked, don’t go in the wilderness. Simple as that. You aren’t forced to do those clue steps. You don’t *have* to own ma2 cape. Just don’t go there and you won’t be killed. 
---
You’re being whiny baby about it and it’s a little embarrassing. It’s a video game and yeah there are parts of the game where other players can kill you. I’m very sorry you get so worked up over that aspect, but I’d rather you not group all of us non pkers into a group with you. Most of us understand the risk/reward for enter the wilderness. Please stop grouping yourself with us, you are the extremely vocal minority. 
---
Yea there’s definitely a balance
---
Play on mobile and get the 1 week free membership and just cancel right before you get charged at the end of the week
---
Really hard to tell without your stats. High level bossing could pay it off it 1-2 hours
---
The spam bots claiming to have had millions doubled are fresh lvl 3's too lol

While several J Mods are active on Twitter and/or Reddit, it is not that uncommon for them to be inactive. Wolf hasn't tweeted in a few months but he posted on Reddit a couple months ago. Compare that to Ghost who hasn't posted on Reddit in nearly a year and hasn't tweeted in around a month. Or John C who hasn't posted in a year or tweeted in a month (several months if you exclude retweets). There are also several example of mods being active on one but not the other. Anyway, since we haven't heard anything to suggest otherwise, Wolf is probably just busy with work and not posting as much on his J Mod social stuffs.
---
Hell yeah

She should have kept her house in the face of big business. It was her castle. It was the vibe... it was Mabo... where's the serentiy?!

Im acting like i know everything? I literally admitted I was wrong on stam pots on rs2, and you’re the one that’s been trying to lecture me this entire time.

Do you hear yourself?

It's actually just sweeping them under the carpet, this comic is inaccurate
---
Super autism alert
---
Actually retarded
---
This update would benefit ultimate ironmen more than any other account type, because we can't just leave our torstol in the bank like other people should learn to do. It shouldn't be in the game because it removes the punishment for making an easily avoidable mistake.
---
Yeah I pretty much quit playing my main on RS3. I recently started an Ironman since they don't have access to MTX or double xp weekends, feels a lot better.
---
DAE RS3 BAD
---
And I don’t give a fuck if you don’t give a fuck about my grind. I don’t want to spend 20 hours collecting sand, that’s not fun or interactive. 
---
It’s QOL month my dude. 
---
You can't really trust Bank Sales as people will put in items that are worth completely nothing compared to what their GE price is, for example the unstrung embelems are worth 0gp but their GE price says 260gp or so, don't go by trade price anymore. It's usually incorrect.
---
That doesn't change the fact that a very large portion of the players in Free-to-Play are new to OSRS and a large portion of those new OSRS players used to play 2007scape.
---
FUCK, sell everything
---
I dont want another one of these
---
\- ??????
---
\- lol
---
made my day, thanks.
---
they will sell for about 20% of what I paid 
---
PKMaster0036 would fucking destroy XxCowSlayer69xX
---
REMOVE THEM AND CHANGE THE QUEST
---
i will never spend real money on member again if this shit stays in-game. U do not change the iconic areas of osrs
---
You take that back!
---
All you can do is sell on GE for a shit price and cut your losses. There's lots of scams such as this. We have a ge for a reason, only use it. There's no need to hand trade anymore unless you're trying to bypass ge limits. 
---
Hey as long as it doesn't significantly impact mains I don't see the issue
---
tbh the servers have been trash lately.
---
Constant lagging and dcs. Why dont they work on that?
---
Holy fuck this poll is actually gonna pass because of a reddit meme
---
The dock is fine where it is, it just needs a redesign. Shorter dock, darker wood to better match the old fishing village vibe, and a rowboat (move the full ship out a ways, implying that he rows you to the ship before sailing to Zeah).
---
Pub is also fine as it is. Damn shame y'all have to cater to salty manbabies who lose their minds over changes like this, but I guess it's easier for everyone that way as the brainlets won't fling their feces as often.
---
im legit raging rn i honestly didnt expect to be scammed in such a crappy way 
---
wow it worked
---
But me pk big spadey split!!!!
---
I would rather die than take my statement back
---
Yes, remember, the dude could have sold the items in the GE effortlessly for more than he sold them to you for.  So there is no value in spamming bank sale to sell them to you (unless he is scamming).  Remember if something is too good to be true, it almost always is.
---
29 point turn - requires 85 Sailing
---
I can't walk on it and it has no interaction. Seems like a bug from the recent update.
---
yeah its one of those things tho when you think youre getting a bargain you panic and rush into things
---
Tassets torso is sexy
---
Then you are bad at coding.

Where the blessed D hide boys at tho?

It is Tian An Men when you attempt to type it out using pinyin
---

---
No, its things like getting our own herbs, combat items, food, or what have you. Ironman makes you train all of the skills in the game, its dynamic and interesting. Filling buckets with sand for no direct exp gain is not interesting gameplay. 
---
So annoying. Then there's a couple where your basically down the hill but yet you dig and it works 😂 
---
check your npc attack options
---
Buy buy buy!

---
PvP is different than other MMO's because there is no set class system, but rather a balance of bonuses and penalties on gear itself. It involves a lot of switches and burst damage rather than drawn out fights. You'll never get bored.
---
As for PvM and skilling, you're going to grind a lot. That being said, you can fit the grind into your normal life and can use your time that you can give full attention to the game for more fun stuff. This is especially true with mobile nowadays. Pop on Game of Thrones and craft some lava runes. Waiting in line at the DMV? Chop some teaks. In a lecture hall? Catch some fish. Got an hour break at work? You can probably finish a Slayer task.
---
There's also a SHIT TON of content. It will consume your life if you let it though; be weary.
---
Congratulations, you fell for the oldest scam in the book. Nothing you can do not but learn from your mistake.
---
Actually I think they had an event where players all helped repair the lumbridge area. It was a cool idea IMO.
---
Legit, I was really impressed when I found out he made it :) God Ash
---
Also he said the key word "and" 
---
It's the worst feeling when you go dry, although when I went dry I usually got something like an ahrim top after :) my low point was 3 flails in a row
---

Yeah, that's the scam.
---
Torso d legs d boots b gloves helm of neitiznot please approve me

Eh it’d only be seen by F2P - all of P2P spends their time doing skill caps emotes in Prif

*yoink*

I don't know it seems like this legit the multitude of bots convinced me
---
[Here you go](https://imgur.com/a/C41ma)

No lie, it'd be kind of hilarious if they regularly changed the HAM dude's dialogue based on the latest Reddit drama. 
---
If they made it toggle-able, I would vote yes for it. Even though I would LOVE HD graphics, I know that many people don't like it, and I wouldn't want to ruin the nostalgic graphics for them. With a toggle feature, everyone wins.
---
Tian an men is correct... Facepalm
---
You're welcome, any and all are welcome to my omens and portents that will guide you through these uncertain economic times.

Yeah I know, I'd just like to get a jmod to freeze my account or something at least.
---
Is NMZ easy mode or something? 
---
You did not sell it for 697m mate
---
Of course it's a bigger problem for them. But a lot of things are intended to be harder for them. I understand that its different than the ordinary "challenges" IM go through compared to a normal account, but im just saying. Prices would still take a significant hit tbh because ironmen are able to still drop trade technically to other accounts, and they would be able to get rid of all the extra items they obtain. Granted it wouldnt be a whole lot but the point is if they did instanced GWD for IM then they'd need to do it for regulars too.
---
 if you get crashed at GWD typically its a team crashing you..which isnt always as simple as "out dpsing them." I'm just saying it wouldnt be fair that ironmen get their own instances when normal accounts do not. Because normal accounts play solo too. And you can't magically make your rng better than the dude crashing you by hitting more and doing more damage every time so that ain't a viable method..
---
Na RS3 is for gays.
---
I'm more than understanding that OSRS and WOW are completely opposite spectrums of combat gameplay, and come to terms with that. I was just curious if anybody else was in my shoes in this regard and what they do about it.
---
More easier to get stuff now then. Might give it a shot if I see another one, I always never got any loot back in 2007 when it was always packed lol
---
Most of her drops are only worth like 80k, and you probably get them once a task.
---
I'd prefer getting a zenyte gem per black demon task and get 14m... and black demons tasks are somewhat common.
---
You can join “inferno rs” we are a med sized pvm clan. We do clan events all the time and everyone is extremely helpful. My rsn: bl0ddiamonds

swap to v skirt and you're good

The MASSIVE nerf to the Lumbridge House has severely hindered the value of pierce weapons. I dunno how, but I'm sure some Lumbridge Only UIM could tell you the details. This is why Jamflex should poll major update changes like this.
---
Someone who complains like this either has a mother named Sharon who constantly asks for the manager or is a mother named Sharon who constantly asks for the manager...
---
Instead of wasting their time for an ironmen only QoL update they should just make something new that will benefit the entire community. You chose to limit yourself, don't try to update the game to suit your needs as well.
---
If you don't want to do it then don't do it you absolute fucking mouth breather
---
i lost my shit at zulrah's guild
---
yeah like on Karil

they're also a little off-center, I'm kinda curious this even happened lol

I miss the Falador Massacre.

Nice feet Dino
---
It's the portal to a timeline where poll results are hidden and there's no dock in Draynor. 
---
If you have literally nothing else to do with your life, you can bang out a lot in OSRS. I've gotten a trade account to 1k total in like 72 hours played time more then once via good starting quests and some decent AFK methods.
---
Don't ever compare yourself to nerds who spend like 12+ hours a day, you'll go insane trying to compete.
---
It's the holy shining light of Saradomin.

Haha.  I used to play constantly when I was younger.  I imagine my previous character was around medium skill level.

Not yet.

---
Thanks for the reddit silver, stranger.
---
Ironman isn’t limiting yourself. They stated iromen would be able to do ANY content in the game, so you aren’t limiting yourself to anything but trading/staking. 
---
If you ran the game we would still be mining pure essence. 
---
Okay, so I have been grinding slayer.  I'm only on 20 so far.  Do other fish need slayer?  What about beef?
---
389
---
You know what to do!
---
we have peaked for memes. this changes everything
---
I’m not doing it lol Im just grabbing my dailies. 
---
Yes. Very afk and a bit of profit. 
---
I loved it. Like others said, it's got a final fantasy feel, and an *amazing* soundtrack. I didn't think I would like it that much, but it's great. 
---
Drop party?
---
None of it needs slayer
---
Metal dragons
---
Thou died my superior weaponry. Off to your designated respawn location you go.
---
Made any money out of it?
---
I think the osrs staff has much control over the servers
---
Why would you trade someone in the fucking ge like you can literally buy almost any item in the game there and you choose to trade some spam bot
---
Yep! 10m so far and it’s pretty chill once you get into a routine and I’d consider myself unlucky with drops. All my cash coming from the runes 
---
PKing has and always will be a luxury. I understand some people go around in 20k rag gear on a 60 range only pure and that's how they get their fix, but I'd want an actual pure with proper mage/attack/str/range levels and would likely try to tribrid. So yeah that's luxury for the sake of luxury.

People farming hydra for new drop, rapier crashing cuz its too expensive for little benefit.

I understand what you're saying, I'm an operations manager for a 25k sqft building of 35 people. That being said, in my company there are multiple people who put eyes on the customer facing side of our business and make sure that everything is correct and accounted for. By the time the customer gets the product, they are the 5th person that has seen and inspected it, and they make the final sign-off.
---
Polling is a huge part of what the players see and experience in the game. It's a really bad communication issue that you're having when the poll doesn't match a developed update, something easily could have been checked and had checks in place.
---
I also want to mention that after I made my post, I saw that Ayiza is calling for a change in the way players are polled, either removing it entirely or adding more depth and clarity to the system. He says that he is afraid the vote yes on any new content, for fear of the extra things that might come with it. He was in the company for a while and knows how it operates at least on some level, so this is extra concerning for me.
---
Yeah dude, no one expects to be scammed.
---
This is definitely one of the shittier scams out there; it bases the deceit off of the GE price, which is usually supposed to *prevent* scams.
---
It’s honestly super clever. But, super shitty. Not much you can do, as long as you don’t try to scam another person and pass off the bad luck.
---
No this subreddit is literally ruining the game with retarded fucking ideas

They are messing with you

What’s the pill this time?
---
You get 5m worth of items if you kill the boss and it drops it and you sell it to somebody for 5m. Maybe the gold market has inflated a bit since you last remember it but try turning that boss kill into 5m gp on an ironman.
---
I legit lolled at that line
---
I know, I was playing along.
---
You got any sources or just projecting? Did you miss out on those posts of kids playing osrs on mobile now?
---
I don't see where ask the fuss it's coming from. I think the docks fine how it is
---
It’s fun to kill people in video games. 
---
It doesn’t have special, which makes it worse than dpick 
---
Move the dock to port sarim but make it like a triangle or a more natural dock. 
---
In fact it IS limiting yourself, no normal normal account needs to do those things because people will buy orbs and battle staffs, or buy seaweed and buckets. You chose to not be able to do that, deal with your choice and quit bitching.
---
Upvote your post yourself then, ironman

With 70 fishing I was getting like 32k xp an hour with dragon harpoon and swordies/tunas at the fish guild. I know that doesn’t help much but i guess you could fish lobs and compare them?
---
If they intend the lore connection to stagnate, and simply be as it is now, forever, I might agree with you. However, as they develop new areas, and more quests, and add things to build up the world, it will leave behind whatever association of 'weird new guy at random location' brings, leaving the only connection to Zeah in the middle of nowhere.

He just as easily should be parking a large, ocean-going vessel with the other large ocean-going vessels.
---
Starting with dharok then over to ahrims. Down to Karils then the last 3 in any order. 
---
I actually don’t pray melee at guthans Torags and veracs 
---
1 prayer pot does me per run and an inventory of monkfish is way more than enough for me
---
(55 prayer, 70 defence) 
---
I usually being around this issue by not being a retard

You are fiesty about your sand lol

I am able to afk NMZ for about 6-7 hours a day while at work. Only get about 70K xp/hr, but I only have to click every 15-20 minutes to keep it going. 
---
Got a VPN setup to my home computer so I can run osbuddy to keep track of the progress and stuff. It’s actually surprisingly solid. Just connect to my desktop from my phone, click a bit, then go back to work.

Killing a boss a bunch of times for a rare drop doesn't harm anybody. Killing a bunch of clue hunters for the chance of one carrying a bunch of teleports or something inconveniences tons of people and builds resentment towards PKers. So I don't see how those two activities are at all comparable for the purposes of this discussions.
---
I love all of this except for the part in draynor village. 
---
Hah, congrats!

Did you study economics?

The only way you get hacked is by not having an authenticator.
---
I bet you thought EOC and MTX were great additions to Runescape.\
---
why not just play through the app?
---
Nah I quit after dung 
---
Or don't be a child and act like them pking you is an act of hatred. They are bored, they've been looking for a tasty snack for 30 minutes now, and you're the first dumbass to not log out on them. Maybe they only get a spade, maybe you skull accidentally and they get a whip, maybe you brought your cash stack or rune pouch with 5k law runes in it.
---
Seriously your entitlment of the wildy being a safe and kiddy friendly area needs to fuck off. You go in the wildy you better be trigger finger ready to log out or only 3 item/use clue box.
---
I don't even PK but motherfuckers like this need to stfu and get off this subreddit. It's the wildy and you knew the risks.
---
Sorry, you have to alch yourself
---
I've got a bit higher stats than you a lvl 80 combat, and yet I was struggling too. This guide allowed me to beat it! thanks much
---
Wow! Nice drop man congrats :D
---
a couple of years ago this wouldnt have been downvoted but now this game is full of rs3 refugees and nuscapers so
---
Damn jebaited
---
Gonna have to low alch yourself fella :'(
