Its just dumb for devs to cater to the small minority of players (pures who didnt do their research) at the expense of the majority of players

We have polls for a reason

That's gonna look great when you're 80 years old. Seeing as how you're a man of impeccable decision making, let's hope you vote too!
---
The ceiling isn't the problem, it's the complete lack of learning curve or ability to learn. As you said it's basically impossible to learn how to pvp without getting cleaned/skull tricked/massacred many times, which is terrible.
---
This is made 100x worse by how strong pures are. If you're a regular nooblet you probably will get curious about pvp when you're mid level, but since you have a typical nooblet account you will get absolutely destroyed by a similar level alt/pure/whatever.
---
So playing devils advocate. Would buffing high tier mage armours accuracy by 10 also cause such an upset like this has and be accepted by the community?
---
I feel like it people with low tier mage gear that requires low level magic wondering why their not catching their freezes on a 70+ raid tank item.
---
Yes it can tank and be obnoxious now but would -10 nerf on a +18 mage defence item be useful to you? 
---
I can understand the melee taking a -10 but having a tank item with +8 defence to magic is a joke.
---
While I do agree that it would be doable, the pk community screeches harder than any other whenever anything is changed to make pvp more dangerous for pkers.

Jsyk it takes 2.5-3 hours to get this kinda drop.
---
But the player keeps the defender?
---
The maul attachment is lost
---
Could also be something he was involved in so they still left credit.
---
Why the fuck would anyone buy that when there is Runelite?
---
I‚Äôll never fight back.
---
It's pointing out that you have to be a complete moron to be lured or scammed and the same is true for getting skull tricked. Most of those measures were added when literal smooth brain children filled the servers. Players do and should understand the risk, and they've been given the option to not attack if they do not want to undertake the risk. You can also bring less valuable items if you want to attack players back and are concerned about getting skull tricked. 
---
In what way is having accounts with similar names an "unintended loophole"? Most of these skull tricks are ancient and have been around longer than you've probably been playing the game. I don't do it at all on OSRS, but people are using similar tactics to what I used at west dragons in 2006 for fucks sake. It's hardly a work around it's literally using the mechanics of the game in the exact way they've been designed to be used and have been used for nearly the entirety of both rs2 and osrs history. You are just asking and begging for nuance and complexity to be stripped from an area of the game you don't engage in anyways for no reason other than "hurr I hate pkers"

It doesn't fuck with me too hard because I usually just DDS into gmaul, can't DDS spec right after but if I spec early I'll most likely get another DDS spec before the fights over. 
---
I just think it's really shitty to invalidate a fuck ton of 50 attack accounts. G maul has been the way it is since this game came out, and people built shit tons of accounts around it just to have Jagex ruin an extremely popular item for shits and gigs.

125 xp/hr is top tier. Have you even watched the latest Swampletics??
---
I was going to say it's their only way to give PvP an update without polling wildy updates, but they didn't even poll this shit. Fucking hamplex...
---
Neither of those are optimal so it‚Äôs very rare to see
---
I've watched raiksey, torvesta, c engineer, Kemp q and framed for 3 years. I know how pvp fucking works dude. 
---
You don't have to be a director or producer to be a movie critic.
---
Maybe if they added some reflect damage/ effect prayers and or spells that could reward good tanks and allow them to counter hit the boss. 
---
 You could add scaling equipment defense requirements to cast the spells or prayers limiting their use to people who are concentrating on the role of tank.    
---
Then, build some bosses around tanking being the most cost effective yet challenging method of killing.
---
But range armour being used for melee is fine?
---
Read my entire comment. Your reply doesn't make any sense.

What is so bad about RS3? You can pretty much literally play OSRS in RS3..... Land out of time release was pretty great, pretty decently sized new area to explore with decent first look exp rates.
---
Everyone loves to shit on RS3 but as someone that is getting their 15 year cape sometime this year, the game feels like it has actually grown up from when I was a kid.
---
What where did I say that lol? Once u realize it‚Äôs a skull trick the best option is to just escape. If your pretty focused and not risking too much/have skulling paranoia that most non pkers seems to have here, you can easily avoid skulling when fighting back. It‚Äôs not that hard to avoid the same skull trick uve seen over a thousand times.

On one hand I really hate pking and dont ever want to get into it. I hate going into the wilderness for any reason, and the idea of having to ruin someone's day to make a profit is just terrible.

On the other hand skull tricking has been in the game forever, and theres kind of an art to it.
---
That's what I was thinking haha
---
The lights are on but no one is home
---
Dropping 1mill in coins is gonna create a huge opening for rushers to come in after a kill to try to pick up that free 1mill of unprotected loot.
---
Quit fucking crying that you cant just pray range and camp d hide and bulwark. Its gonna take a little skill to tank now. Get over it
---
That's what I was thinking!
---
Armies of Gielnor was so good! I wish there was still a playerbase. I don't even know if it's still playable..
---
This is too relatable, this hurts
---
&gt; you don‚Äôt need any skill to tank to the bank with it

u probably pk at the chaos altar in salad robes and wonder why you can‚Äôt get kills. Sad

Me being unskulled won‚Äôt change that fact, normie or Ironman.
---
&gt; No that would just change the owner from the current owner to that person.
---
There is no actual independence from the owners ever.
---
They arent saying independent of ownership they are saying independent of a parent company. Currently the parent company is Shanghai Hongtou Network Technology Co., Ltd. If jagex were bought out it could become an independent company with no parent.

I only ever see the bulwark beinf used by spanish-spamming Venezuelans at black chins. Literally the only viable use: wild tanking to 30 wildy.
---
The only way you will get me to PvP is like clan wars. And the only thing that gets me into the wildy is the abyss, any content released in the wilderness is dead on arrival to me.

nah there's ways to bug it out and cause you to be skulled just from auto retaliate.

No, the point of that last paragraph that I wrote is literally that almost all diary tasks and rewards/perks that were introduced in March 2015 were borrowed or adapted directly from the RS2 counterparts. The fact that it helps ironmen out is a coincidence because it was intended to just be a copy of what diaries were when they were released in 2008-2009 in RS2. 
---
You can check out the rewards for the corresponding diaries on the RS3 wiki too -- the Ardougne ones are virtually identical, except for the fact that the Cloak 4 doesn't restore your full Summoning points once per day in OSRS.
---
Yes, regular players can use NMZ and have always been able to until the recent series of nerfs that removed these secondaries, but that doesn't mean that the update was "for Ironmen" -- all rewards for all diaries were just blanket copies, and the concept of noted drops was introduced well before Ironman mode was a thing in RS2.

Dinh's is such a niche item as it is, as a black chin hunter this item is essential to my kit and one of the few things that gives me a small amount of peace of mind when constantly being attempted to get pk'd, sometimes literally every 10 minutes. Black chins is one of the hottest pk areas in the game and the devs are looking to nerf one of the only items in the game that gives those who are looking to spend a vast amount of time in the wildy?

For the untradable items that don't stack in your bank and have the quantities stored on the item (blowpipe, gem bag, etc.), the info about the contents of the item is stored with a hidden quantity of the item. In other words, there are 32 bits allocated to it, just like there are 32 bits allocated to any item stack.
---
popular fact
---
Granite maul I get tbh. I don't agree with the method of obtaining it, the price, or the guarantee of loss-on-death though.
---
I think you keep untradeables. You can test it by bring untradeable quest items you dont need and some 3 30k items to be sure though.
---
But there shouldnt be a reason you die. Just eat to full every kill. On average you lose 20 hp and sometimes you lose up to 60 but fairly uncommon.
---
It's in runelite plus.
---
I made this poll mostly because I feel like the underlying issue of the PvM/Pker and PKer/PKer dynamics is more to do with how people interact with combat mechanics rather than the gear itself. If measures were in place so that someone could participate in single-way combat without worry of others abusing how it works into an extremely unfun and unfair scenario.
---
No because being friends with another dude is more common than being gay, and any sort of affection doesn't mean you're gay. This is why men western men can show affection with each other.
---
Just to clarify, Will the nerf be across pvm or pvp only?
---
you run the risk of running into a pker but you accept that risk by heading in the wild with the purpose of fighting another person.  You have the advantage of having the right tools to fight back, and the right amount of inventory spots for food and switches.  A person in d'hide and dins with an inventory of bones isnt looking for a fight, and do not have the means of defending themselves, and will always be at a disadvantage.
---
With how easy it is to eat to full hp, there‚Äôs literally no overpowered spec weapons right now since u only get 2-3 specs off max in one fight. Gmaul is the only one borderline op in some combat brackets depending the pvp fighting style (instamaul in pure nh is disgusting).
---
Well DT was an excellent quest, well done.
---
Well why not? That would guarantee he wouldn't be able to kill you right?
---
They will abuse it? You are acting like they directly gain some kind of benefit for it, they could have left it the same. 
---
Certain integrity changes can and have been effective at bringing necessary changes to the game- I argue this is not one of them of course. But why go out of your way to make a narrative like this?
---
This and a pj timer in singles. If someone attacks you  noone else can attack you for 30-60 seconds. Tired of clans just tagging off, it's not really single combat the way it stands.
---
Great false equivalency argument. But just to humor you, I risk 940k unskulled in this setup. So someone who's in about ~8m no risk, 200k risk setup (give or take depending on how many chins) is still able to be splashed on for 4 levels til they teleport out. Lmk how fair that is using a 94 mage spell against someone with 90 mage and a dinhs. 
---
Trust me, I'm 83 hunter and did 73-80 in kharils + dinhs, not dying once even to someone in full ahrim's. Stopped doing it because it was literally 0 risk and started anti-pking instead because it was more fun.
---
Saying the n word is a huge piece of osrs I don't want to see removed.
---
Usually 1m+ in gear, and if another pker logs in it's pretty possible to die. The wilderness is safe for the dinny wearer, not me.

Does that happen often that it would be impossible to level up?
---
OwO
---
and you accept that by heading out into the wild with the sole purpose of pk'ing.  The difference between you and the other person, is you are geared to deal with the situation and should have an inventory to survive said situation.
---
My supplies are just the brews (and super restores, obviously), and manta rays. I tried using anglerfish but I wasn‚Äôt making use of the overheal enough to justify the lower heal.

I‚Äôm also using a extended super antifire, antivenom+ and one stamina pot (I know not to drink stam in second phase).

I find the team of people in single combat fun to watch tbh. B0atys pking vids recently have been very entertaining to me in that sense how he can just bounce to whoevers on him and carry on the fights

I don't rly see the need for this but I'd vote Yes just to see how insane some people are for that high score lol.

Yes, he is saying an attack option would appear only on players that have attacked you.

Wrong
---
Swamp trident does more dps and is more expensive to use. Since you already have swamp trident just use that for everything, the extra dps is worth it.
---
it‚Äôs the same items lost as a normal death, untreatable are kept, anything on the FLOOR is lost forever

That's not the purpose of the skull system. It's supposed to encourage you to fight back by putting extra risk on the aggressor, but it currently does the opposite.
---
Funny it ended up being the best quest in the game

---
Gz
---
Not at all, skull tricking is not a mechanic, it is (usually) using multiple accounts to intentionally put the player at a massive disadvantage to no fault of that player besides them trying to fight back. This is similar to saying doubling money is a mechanic.

Like how ppl are saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like pkers and nerfing the bulwark isn‚Äôt going to bring back pvp to the wild‚Äù? It‚Äôs a step in the right direction has been my only point this whole time. Why are people acting like the purpose of the wild isn‚Äôt risk of death for rewards when they accuse Jagex of pandering to pkers with this update? The Wild was made for pvmers/skillers to risk death for drops and xp, at the same time made for pkers to kill other players.
---
As someone who's last grind is 200m in all skills, why would i waste a precious minute pk'ing for shit loot?  Believe me i dont need salad robes and gmauls, shit i have high alched more gmauls then you have probably ever seen.  Half of the shit you mention should not even be in the game, and was only put in to lure people into the wild because you guys cry every 3-6 months that the wild is dying.

You're unironically talking about how "getting the right prayer isn't hard lul!!!" as if it's some hot take when pretty much everyone who admits they don't have a firecape say it's because they don't have the patience to go through all the waves a few times and/or panic when they have to tag the healers while getting their prayers right and not going into melee range of Jad. 
---
I'm sorry but you really need to get a grip on reality if you believe that anything in this game is **mechanically** difficult.  The "hardest" part about  **the inferno** is blob flicking, yet there are very few people that have the cape.  Do you think it's because they can't alternate between clicking two buttons every 0.6s or is there probably a few other reasons behind it?
---
you do realize that teams require bis for most end game content right, which is made with teams in mind.  I'm either talking to a pure or someone who is still stuck in nightmare zone.
---
Not that this is something I would want, but, I think it is impossible with 100% accuracy to determine if someone has attacked you client side (especially with AoE), so I would probably not want to do it regardless out of fear of someone losing bank due to it bugging out/making a mistake and blaming RuneLite.
---
you can stack out 140hp of damage in 1 tick, but ok
---
Integrity changes should never be polled in the first place, if they believe it is truly an integrity change, then don't poll it.
---
If its not an integrity change, it shouldn't get integrity treatment
---
If you die to kraken you have bigger issues.
---
I see your point but it's their game that WE pay $11/month to play
---
1. Instead of removing Splashing XP at Lumbridge, how about bringing the cats to F2P?
---
2. Ever thought about allowing rats to be caught with cats for Hunter XP? This would mean no longer making it XP waste! Would probably be good for low level Hunter training.
---
3. Why has the question about polling F2P Snare been dodged? It was asked several times without definite answer. Bind (5 seconds) isn't enough.
---
Maybe there is already a clear precedent that nerfs don't require polls because everyone would just vote in their own interest to keep the things that are good for them. Especially when it comes to anything involving pking.
---
This is such a stupid thing for people to be up in arms over. The item has one niche use that it was not intended to be used for and it is too good at, so it is getting slight number nerfs to make it a little less good at it.
---
The guy 2 replies above me said that it's "getting nerfed out of pvp" which shows he is completely clueless about the subject and is complaining just to complain. Dinh's Bulwark will still clearly be the best option for exactly what it is currently being used for. It will just be a little less good at it.
---
Can you do this again for their proposed to be discussed change to magic accuracy? They want to take it from 70% being based on your magic level and 30 % based on your gear to 50% for both.
---
I remember them suggesting something like this on a Q&amp;A when ToB was in development. Something along the lines of escorting some sort of payload that required you to be exceptionally tanky to hold onto for long periods of time (I haven't done ToB so I have no idea if anything close to this was actually implemented)

On  Jatizso and Neitiznot there is a watchtower that has guards shouting at each other and includes a runescape version of the bottom line. It says "Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of winterberries."

look at the big brain on this guy
---
It states in this post that this was the first time they tried this, and I haven't heard of another try after this, so its likely only these three quests are the result of intern work, which is a shockingly good track record, even considering the one that had to be scrapped and re-purposed.
---
That's awesome I didn't realize
---
Yes its an unpolled nerf, because its currently too strong. Yes they should have just called it a nerf instead of a rework, but its still a perfectly warranted update that brings more balance to the wild. And if you cant see that for whatever reason, please ask me how and I will tell you.
---
You're an idiot. You watch entire fights happen start to finish. This topic is not about finding fights or anything that ever happens off screen.
---
I'm not an idiot, I know that gmaul is hard to hit against armor, so is literally everything else in the game. Granite maul is slightly less accurate than a dscim + rune defender, and they don't have much problem getting hits.
---
Gmaul is broken and needed this nerf. An entire class of pvp was born because this weapon is so disgustingly broken and cheap. 1 ticking the spec is the easiest fucking thing in the world and if your rng is even slightly average you'll deal 3 15's for an instant 1 tick 45 damage.
---
Stop. It's broken. The ONLY people bitching about this are pures who are upset they have to risk more than 30k.
---
Sure, skill should decide who wins or who kills who whenever gear is somewhat close. But I don't care how skilled you are, if I have 7m worth of gear, and you have 20k, you should lose every time if it's 1v1
---
Then mobile gets shafted
---
Its already not the best option, ely + any staff is better than bulwark, its just the cheapest option because it has no other uses and isn't as rare.
---
It is actually getting nerfed out of pvp, because now wearing suffering (i) as the +1 in the place of the bulwark, plus a random shield, will be better than the bulwark.
---
You're clearly incredibly dense, so I'll try to keep it as simple as I can; the issue ISN'T, that means IS NOT FYI people clicking the wrong people accidentally. The issue, especially the skull-tricking method of logging a near-identically named account on top of you, WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GAUGE WHO IS WHO IN A FIGHT, thus you run the chance of hitting the wrong person. And just to be even clearer; THIS LITERALLY GOES AGAINST THE PURPOSE OF SKULLING. YOU GET SKULLED BECAUSE YOU ARE THE AGGRESSOR AND THEREFORE YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SHOULD RISK ALL YOUR ITEMS, NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE ABUSED A GAME MECHANIC TO FUCK YOU OVER. My god the amount of people that said this and you just disregard it and ramble nonsensical bullshit is astounding, please get some reading comprehension.
---
Totally get it. I used to to windy slayer with a fight back set up. Got skull tricked (risking 500k-1m unskulled) for 9+m. Got skull tricked after the Halloween update that made people look basically the same as the area in front of the webs near ardy lever. While doing hellhounds. Fought back realized I couldn‚Äôt live and ran for the lever only to skull on a lvl 99 or something hidin right in front of webs who tbed me with almost no food left. Gg that 9m I had but I never did wildly slayer after that.
---
Am I missing something?
---
Whoops thought this was lava drags
---
If you won‚Äôt skull on someone that has attacked you doesn‚Äôt that mean the client holds information on who has attacked you?
---
I would just watch a YouTube guide or two on the GP/hr you can make at Barrows. A lot of it depends on RNG, Ibans vs. Trident, and prayer level to get more trips in per run.

Maybe something more relatable like steam, Should you forget your password or need to reset your authenticator delay you will have a period of up to a couple weeks where you can't trade or sell anything. Even Final Fantasy, Guild Wars &amp; Battle.Net authenticators are substantially harder to social engineer away
---
TLDR ; Stop defending Jagex's shit tier account security in 2019. I've seen 2 person uni-student teams make better support systems in under a week.
---
2 minutes?  It's up to like 3 hours with the best gravestone.
---
Inb4 nerf crashes prices and then it becomes a 40k rag tank item
---
I did the same after 5+ years off. Sadly, I got my account hacked and banned. I started over new and been enjoying it again in my off time.
---
Void ranger or zerker? Thoughts?
---
hit a clean 37
---
When people throw snowballs at me in the GE I pray flick range protection.
---
finally someone who gets it
---
I love the game but I also love the grind!
---
I don't think the grindiness of OSRS has changed in the past year or will in the future. If the grindiness is what's turning you away then maybe another game is best suited for you. However, there's also something to be said in trying something again -- worst that happens is you realize you actually don't like it and can move on!
---
First thing that popped into my head lol
---
Good idea.
---
Oh
---
I had this problem when I did the boss
---
I wasn't really getting killed, I would just run out of food and have to tele
---
I ended up selling most of my bank for a dhcb and did the fight only eating 2 food.
---
I sold it back for the same price, since the fight only lasts a good 15 mins I didn't lost any money on the items. Just be patient when selling stuff back.
---
You can tank 10 people on you across the wildy as is.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about viewer experience. I‚Äôm solely speaking to content creation, and it isn‚Äôt up for debate, it‚Äôs factual. It‚Äôs almost zero effort to create commentaries. The actual gaming takes effort/skill, yes. But that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. If you could read between the lines you‚Äôd realize that I‚Äôm pointing out the obvious thing... that when it comes to commentary, there isn‚Äôt much diversity in content creation.
---
Nah you're misunderstanding. Right now it's (simplified) 30% of your defense level+70% of your magic level+your gear magic defense bonus. They're just changing the ratio that your base levels are taken into account. If you have equal magic and defense it's no change. It's a buff if your defense is higher than your mage and a nerf if your defense is lower than your mage (pures will get hit more often). How gear bonuses affect you won't change. So the numbers I posted would be the same since they are for 99/99 mage and Def
---
Random question as someone who literally hasn't touched construction: is there a benefit or advantage to having people visit your house on house party worlds? Or is it done out of the kindness of their hearts?
---
If it's the latter, thank you everyone who shares gilded altars!
---
&gt;This community is so weird that people would start donating all their GP to streamers to help them throw more money down the well
---
should be added to the GE area, and lead into Keldagrim
---
Ideally you would want to decrease the demand for rwt gold &amp; discourage people from botting
---
Big if true.
---
Black dhide and 1 item should absolutely make you near invincible when you‚Äôre getting attacked by someone wearing mystics or salads and using a water staff. You should have to risk higher tier gear if you want to dps through one of the tankiest items in game.
---
Nah the maul has been broken forever. Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt fix it. Personally I think they should have just made it 1 tick slower so you can‚Äôt Insta maul instead of the 60%. The maul was complete cancer for the 90-110 combat bracket. 
---
As for the next steps I would go for 60 attack, max that. If you don‚Äôt like it feel free to get the 75. Ags/SOTD are always fun to fuck around with
---
Be cool if the higher rank you are,  the better rewards you get for killing someone. This would probably help with smurfing (which is probably gonna happen anyways) but will give people a good reason to rank other then just flexing status.
---
Okay obviously here there was a misunderstanding of the scenario. I clearly said in my original statement that if I was understanding the scenario correctly, they would be both dded under me and one would come out and bolt the person under me which is one of the if not the most prominent skull trick u see on day to day basis.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how u read my scenario and continued yours though lol. I haven‚Äôt seen two people dded on each other elsewhere because then it‚Äôs fucking obvious u shouldn‚Äôt attack either especially if they have similar names/cb. That car is literally so obvious that no one would ever fight back or use that for a skull trick ever.
---
and make the special attack 100% the players are asking for ACTUAL updates but they don't listen mystics enchanted all need halved attack and def bonuses only 40 mage 20 def
---
 So pitter patter, lets get at‚Äôer
---
And let's add MTX
---
For ironmen sure, to make money on a main, no
---
I‚Äôve always wondered how big runes would actually be
---
Ugh I hated getting that
---
Yea once u talk to the slayer master u can spend 50 points i think so cancel the current task
---
my 1700 total gmauler is now a proud 50 defense pure.
---
Wilderness is dead as fuck anyway lmao
---
You can go and talk to Turael in Burthorpe to cancel your task and get a new one, but it will interrupt your streak!
---
Zamorak GS spec / Dragon Spear not work?
---
You're not meant to get the kill every time, you know.
---
yeah, also make mystics cost ~5k and add tier 70 black dhide equilevant in magic gear which costs 10k per piece like dhide
---
Am away from the game right now. What was the altar change
---
Middle name is Kinsley
---
I saw this after I already figured everything out but a guy named Theoatrix I think it was has a guide on Youtube that is called like "important untradeables to get". There's a lot of stuff you just have to go put in work to get like void and barrows gloves and that's the stuff that when you have it people don't consider you a noob anymore. By the way, there's nothing wrong with getting full Adamant and going to train, it's just not as efficient these days.
---
How do I examine an items to see its stats? I know it‚Äôs a noob question but I can‚Äôt seem to find it and have tried looking it up but didn‚Äôt find out how there either. I just want to see if I can get some better armor than my bronze stuff. Thx
---
It will know npc vs player but likely not skulled player vs unskilled player
---
Go back to the slayer master and under rewards you can cancel the task, it does cost slayer points tho
---
It‚Äôs 30 points to cancel
---
How about you shut up
---
If you actually read the card you'd see that it says "No expiration date or service fees"
---
Either he dc‚Äôs or his dash lights up like a Christmas light.
---
Lol pretty sure not but I'd like to hope so.
---
One slay tip if u didn‚Äôt already rush the slay helm then rush the imbue for it
---
Approve
---
Just say it's integrity
---
this is great because its 100% accurate what are the chances jagex are scared to answer because they don't have a good answer to it
---
Nobody ever quits. See you in a year.
---
More like anku planku, amirite?
---
Muted players getting cleaned.
---
Right click the slayer master, you should have an option Rewards or something?
---
The menu that lets you buy slayer perks.
---
In there, you can click the Tasks button at the top, and cancel for 30 slayer points or block the task for 100 points.
---
Failing that, speak with the master in Burthope, and he will give you an easy task, but reset your slayer task streak.
---
Apologies if any of this is slightly off, unable to get on to get the exact names of things.
---
I carry cash if I'm buying weed or something, but yeah just get direct deposit.
---
Just started playing again after 10 years. Everyone used to PK in Ahrims in high level wild - what happened?
---
People in mystic were laughed at.
---
There‚Äôs an 8 tick delay for the damage absorption to take effect
---
this is exactly why we should just vote no on every polls regardless because they just ignore them anyways no doubt those "partnerships" will be some sort of integrity change next
---
won't quit can't quit. you probably had like $5 of gold anyway
---
G maul pking is exactly what allowed me to START PVP
---
It‚Äôs low risk and with it, I can actually compete with other pkers 
---
People who keep talking about how OP it is likely never even pk
---
If you don‚Äôt stack eat when the g maul is whipped out then honestly you deserve to die lol
---
And if you did die, you learned a lesson and lost 50k. 
---
Also, you know those pk vids you see? Do you know HOW MANY tries you need to actually get a good stacked double hit? The thing is more inaccurate than a bronze pickaxe. Even with 1def people still miss. 
---
Pking is literally supposed to be fun. Who the fuck is gonna spend 4m on a Gmaul
---
If this passes i quit. Noobs the whole lot of ya, and forever noobs you'll be with this mindset.
---
A small ominous black hole that always follows, get very close to you, but does not pull you in.... not yet anyway.
---
You can use a cat
---
He literally said max gear. Max offensive gear is 500m+ risk.
---
Lmao
---
I pk on a main, med and pure and would support this 100%. I also would love if every world included the BH world pj timer. Make singles actually singles again
---
Dude...how do you get hacked??? We‚Äôre grown men lol. You didn‚Äôt have authenticator and shit?
---
Of course you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs complicated! You‚Äôve been playing it half your life! 
---
Now this next bit might be a bit hard given the dire fucking limitations of your mental state, but try and put yourself in the shoes of someone who‚Äôs only ever played a bit of Skyrim, Halo, maybe FIFA. Fuck, maybe they‚Äôve only played Doodle Jump and Clash of Clans. Maybe they saw OSRS trending on the App Store and wanted a new game to keep them busy on their commute. I‚Äôd be impressed if they managed to figure out the UI, let alone what a grand exchange is and how to get there.
---
I guess all the brainlet memes are an accurate depiction of this sub after all.
---
same, just started again so feel free to add me ‚ÄúI crank 90s‚Äù
---
Lmfao
---
Look like multilogging or friends to me
---
Well sure, it probably would increase the base value of gp and the value of every item in the game organically. But at the same time, it becomes a contest for certain rich assholes for who can throw the most away, into the well. For those people that can throw away thousands of dollars and not care, they'll be throwing away gp as fast as bots can farm it. 
---
And again, if we could implement this alongside a better bot detection and removal system, we could severely reduce inflation and prevent it from increasing again. 
---
It could even make it possible for some f2p players making enough gold to join as members, and have a much better experience in the game.
---
ü§ìüòÇüòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a horrible suggestion.

:(

F
---
Those thicc pixels...
---
It moved, not gonna lie.
---
Yeah if I heard someone scream "taste vengeance" in a crowded shopping mall I would certainly be worried.
---
Im at work and cant google, can you link me something. I dont understand how that could work. When you equip the shield, it gives you the defensive stats right away unless iy gives you the stats but also gives a hidden stat debuff for 8 seconds
---
Am I the only one who thinks the Elder Chaos Druid/Earth warrior type of skull tricking is ok? But the type where they fall in and go ‚Äúbox me bro‚Äù is absolutely dog shit and should be removed from the game?
---
What exactly was the dialog that showed the distinction?
---
Nice one bro, everyone who died with bulwark was utterly SHIT at eating and praying, ergo incompetent. I don‚Äôt even think they had combo food. Those people are irrelevant because they will die in fucking any gear, max gear arma justiciar and all.
---
I don't really agree with the change or understand why they wanna do it but everyone saying the item is useless and now even more useless... Come on now, it's -10. It's still going to be a strong tank item and still going to be used in the same situations it's been used it. I'm not supporting the change really, but I don't think it makes a big difference one way or another. 
---
Being mad about the principle of an unpolled nerf is fine but being mad about -10 def is pretty insane.
---
Generate task is one of my favorites.
---
Edited my post
---
Close some of the other 10+ tabs you have open and give that computer a chance
---
Only 1 pray level 50 edge pkers lol. The other 95% knows the gmaul hits 0s 90% of the time lol. Nah rip gmaul ags 2019
---
Hey man, there are some species of birds that if you got a baby one tomorrow, it would probably need to go in your will.
---
(disclaimer: don't get a bird, they are demanding pets and definitely not for everyone)
---
Cute sized can
---
Better yet why don‚Äôt we just disable all pvp so nobody gets attacked and everybody‚Äôs safe !
---
Yeeeees. This will get 100%
---
He uses 2 mice legit
---
How'd that work out for crucible after the first day again? Oh right...
---
You're defending anime and calling out people who slander it as ignorant, that gives me as much basis as I need to assume what kind of person you are lmao
---
Crap cant believe i let that one go over my head lol
---
I lost my original account to "Hey do you want free membership". I was young and naive and I regret it.
---
more like its called last resort because poor scrubs are clueless on making money risk fight if you want to make money or get a better hobby its a desert out there literally
---
just dont be a retard and dont get skull tricked lol
---
u/uwutranslator
---
thanks haha
---
No one who wasn't already dying to pkers in hides is now going to be dying to pkers in hides just because their def bonuses are 10 less than before. 
---
I agree it's dumb to update without a poll, but I feel like we're blowing this a bit out of proportion.
---
1- it‚Äôs not broken because of how infrequent it is in most pvp brackets/styles. I‚Äôm not sure how ur still denying this, maybe u need to pk more diversely instead of pure bridding or dh venge stacking (rng as fuck). 
---
2- Remove triple eat if u want to even think about tackling ‚Äúop specs‚Äù
---
At least this is better then the meth guy
---
Joffrey really the type of nibba to shoot a javelin up a thots brown squirter smh
---
no even their great "revs" idea is dying out i bet they are gob smacked you see more pkers than pvmers in there these days
---
Keep doing slayer, you should net profit overall at your level.
---
Do herb runs on the side to make some extra cash
---
Are you serious? Dude they LITERALLY tell you to some to the Reddit to post about game changes. I understand you're new to this community, but why are you acting like you're not? Also, way to miss every single point I made.
---
Here, this was posted today, I hope this is good enough: [https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/small-game-improvements?oldschool=1](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/small-game-improvements?oldschool=1)
---
&gt;That's all the proposed changes for this blog. **Let us know what you think about them in the usual channels listed down below**. Please ensure you expand the various sections of this blog to read all of the proposed changes including poll questions. Pending feedback, we look to poll the "To Be Polled" changes from Friday July 12th until Monday July 15th.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Discuss this update on our official forums, **the community-led 2007Scape Reddit**, or the community-led OSRS Discord in the #gameupdate channel.
---
I bolded the significant bits. This community is read by Jagex, they give support on here, they've fixed accounts on here, they read community responses to changes, and they reply to the community. It's a problem that's regularly discussed on this subreddit. Including a meme that's "social media should not be your customer support".
---
Small pouch can cost you exp at ZMI if you have to empty an extra time tho
---
let gmaul be what it is.  just adapt like everyone
---
Most of us did the quest as kids, id rather watch a 10 minute video and do it as im watching.  Sorry they aren't fun enough for a second go around in life.
---
My joke wasn‚Äôt shit
---
So only the trolls speak correctly? What a twist
---
Rework thammaron sceptre, any chance?
---
We already have fairly good item sinks (alching and maybe warding). &amp; the sand casino removes a lot of gold from the game
---
I always thought the bulwark was garbage but I seen it used by low lvl cb players for tanking an I thought that was cool for clans to have a tank for bandos etc. jagex gonna take the fun away from the kids that can‚Äôt no life. It is a reasonable price. Leave it alone jagex. Nobody uses it besides a few tankers
---
&gt; Most of the people voting are adults who can understand the consequences of each poll question.
---
NMZ and splashing would like a word with you
---
You‚Äôre retarded
---
1.  It's not worth it because you can bring a suffering, a crystal shield + a random staff, I never said you had to bring an Ely.  I said it wasn't BIS, and now its def bonuses are under that of a crystal shield paired with random staff + suffering (i), which is virtually no risk as the item that would replace the bulwark is the suffering (i) (20 to ALL def + 4 pray bonus)
---
A suffering (i) + crystal shield = cost effective def with a TON of def bonus.  I mean if you're going to say to bring ely or spectral, that already outclassed the bulwark prenerf.
---
Crystal shield is +50 to melee stats, +80 to range and + 0 to mage which translate to +70 melee stats, +100 to range and +20 to mage with a suffering.  Add a staff and that's +30 to mage def instead.  That beats out the bulwark post-nerf because mage bonus is the most important.  Again, I'm not saying its better than an Ely, I'm saying that because of the nerf this setup is better than bulwark.
---
The setup you mentioned risks 2 items if you protect item.  Why would you bring a fury? That's a waste of an inventory slot for your glory tele lmao.  Not going to bother with you.
---
"You realize this is not a nerf to the Gmaul itself right? Its only a nerf to the absurdly cheap VALUE of the item." Looks like you're admitting it's a nerf right there, not going to bother reading out the rest of the shit you typed about the G-Maul nerf.  As I said I'm for a nerf on it, but they need to go through the proper c hannels.  They POLLED it, it FAILED A POLL, now they are NERFING IT ANYWAYS.
---
I'm not sure how you can't understand that if something is POLLED and FAILS THE POLL maybe it should either be REPOLLED or NOT IMPLEMENTED.  It isn't about getting MY way, its about changes being POLLED, failing a POLL, then being forced into the game as an "integrity change".  If you're going to force a change into the game, why even do polls in the first place? Why poll something to implement it regardless of it failing?
---
People like you are the ones who will accept when they decide to implement MTX as "needed for the longevity of the game" bullshit.
---
Fuck Jagex
---
because they lack original ideas and cant possibly think of a way of getting pkers to do something productive for money other than look for other people who spend time doing it so they can kill them with ease when they are focusing on something else not pking so easy pickings with little effort if they wana pk why dont they actually fight eachother i thought that was the whole point of it
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure the current bh point value is a good representation of the weapons power. I‚Äôd be fine if it added the same amount of risk as a dark bow or ballista, whichever
---
I can‚Äôt think of any cons. Best suggestion for the economy I‚Äôve heard maybe ever
---
Peen
---
Or just make the bulwark special a legitimate taunt. We don't need magic to be involved if the person using the magic is expected to be in full tank gear too
---
I've been doing herb runs and birdhouses for some passive money. I don't mind doing slayer but tasks like I feel like I overall don't profit much with Nieve. Should I just grind for 100 combat real fast then switch to duradel? Currently at 97.5 cb
---
You can find out client side, or at least you could in the last 5 years. Botting scripts that dealt with being attacked by players were able to identify who those players are and react accordingly. I'm not entirely sure how Runelite functions because I've never looked into it, but if it uses injection to get data from the client then it should be able to identify who is interacting with the player
---
By cc you mean osrs soa?
---
Visage
---
with my experience at wildy bosses id say theres a lot of pkers that would prefer it if you didn't fight back haha
---
That‚Äôs true. The date matches to a Wednesday, so it appears to be an accurate date
---
true. it doesnt have to be a new best in slot food, just another option
---
150 kc really is nothing though
---
There's no point if you are just going to lose.
---
Deserved
---
Hi.  So, the Ardy course is the only course where there is only one spot for the Marks to spawn.  And when a new Mark spawns on top of an old one, it refreshes the despawn timer on them all.  As such, if you are continuously running laps, the Marks will never despawn until you decide you are done, which can make for lots of Marks on the ground for the nerdier among us.
---
Don't try this on other courses, or your Marks will despawn!
---
I remember when dial-up was the best connection speed you could hope for, doesn't mean we should go back to it.
---
They already added a spec transfer delay. Pj timer is a non issue. If your frustration is singles teams falling in on you and taking turns dealing damage, that's not going anywhere.
---
I agree with you though, it works for pvmers because they aren't geared for a fight. But imagine if someone was geared as a pvper and just sat around waiting to be attacked so that they had the advantage. That's what I mean by it promotes passivity. The item advantage is huge in pvp scenarios. 
---
I also don't think you gave the pker's inventory enough credit. They have to bring items to get there and get away too on top of having more switches and runes for teleblock/barrage. They aren't going to have just 28 inventory spaces for healing. Yes they have the item advantage, but they always will because they specifically are geared to fight. I also think a pvmers distinct choices of 3 pieces pvm gear over using at least 1 expensive piece of pvp gear to do the same activity doesn't deserve to be balanced around considering it indicates they aren't looking for a winnable fight in the first place. At that point even saving 10 items wouldn't do them any good since it would all be pvm gear. 
---
I agree that pvmers are massively disadvantaged but I disagree with the idea behind trying to make unskulling fair for them because I don't see how it could work for pvmers and not make it a massive advantage for pvpers as well. 
---
Overall the best way i can think of right now would be to reduce the amount of pvm/skiller inventory spaces required to do certain tasks in the wilderness (without making them OP) using creative mechanics so that there is more space for counterplay by having more of your inventory with pvp gear still. I still think there should be a risk to it however as that's what makes those activities able to be profitable in the first place. For example, the chaos altar guy will turn your noted bones into some other item that lets you save inventory spaces while using bones on the altar up to a limit so you still have to return to him after 27 or so uses. Or stackable box traps in your inventory just for the wilderness. Just some ideas.
---
Sorry but if you're so bad that you actually get skull tricked you kinda deserve it imo. This would help people who wants this game to turn to some afk-pvm-borefest. Is it too much to ask to pay attention when you're in the wild? If so then you shouldn't go in there in the first place.
---
Can someone provide some context on the crab emoji and why it is so popular in reference to osrs?
---
As an unintended side effect of this, if you‚Äôre fighting someone in singles and they have a whole clan following you and dd‚Äôing, you can simply left click the pile of people to hit the guy who attacked you rather than right-clicking and looking for his name. Support just for this part lol.
---
With mory hard diary Barrows should be a solid 1m/hr if you don't have bad RNG on your unique drops. Gargs and green dragons will probably be around half that. I also enjoy plugging my own content so [consider using a Tome of Fire + Fire Wave](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bu4xnx/testing_4_different_methods_at_barrows_75_magic/) at your level to save money on supplies, get faster kills, and get more magic exp at Barrows.
---
Imo Duradel and Nieve are pretty comparable masters at your level, and although Duradel assigns Gargoyles and Skeletal Wyverns more often, I don't think you'll notice much of an increase in gp/hr just by switching masters. Wouldn't worry too much on rushing to 100 cmb just to switch masters at this point if your primary concern is gp
---
Remember, Hell has a tenth circle for skull trickers.
---
Really did not know this, thanks !
---
It either needs its price increased or to be nerfed, it‚Äôs a 8m item. Ely + Toxic staff of the dead is slightly better but you risk +1 more item and it‚Äôs considerably more expensive.
---
It was a meme. It is not Jagex's fault if you did not pick that one up.
---
That's the first tier, did it happen on the IP of the player? Did it happen in a different country? Is it a known VPN? Does the user have a history with offenses? Did the new device empty out the bank before turning on the bot? Is the activity the botting took place in an easily recognizable one used for deadbotting? Was the player inactive prior to the suspicious activity?
---
So it was cool when it was 20m+ but now it needs a nerf? It‚Äôs not like you can‚Äôt hit through the thing
---
Yesterday on my pure
---
You got baited
---
If every male on earth got a boner at the same time, the earth's rotation would slow down. Assume there are about 3.8 billion males, with an average dick height of about 80 cm off the ground. The average dick weighs about 100 grams.
---
That's a combined mass of 380,000,000 kg of cock.
---
Now we must make an approximation. For simplicity's sake, let us assume the penises are all evenly lined up in a ring around the equator. The equation for moment of inertia of a ring is I = mass*radius^2. The radius of earth is about 6.371 million meters. Therefore the radius of the approximated dick ring is 6,371,000 + 0.80 = 6,371,000.8 meters.
---
I = 380,000,000*6,371,000.8^2 = 1.5424*10^22
---
The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = 8.04√ó10^37 kg*m^2. The Earth rotates at a moderate angular velocity of 7.2921159 √ó10^‚àí5 radians/second.
---
‚Äã
---
Using Conservation of Angular Momentum we can find the new rotation of the earth.
---
L=I*omega= 8.04√ó10^37 kg*m^2 * 7.2921159 √ó 10^‚àí5 = 5.86286*10^33.
---
5.86286*10^33 = (8.04√ó10^37 + 1.5424*10^22) *omega
---
-&gt; solve for omega = 7.292115899502489e-05
---
This is 4.97511e-15 rad/s slower than earth's original rotation. This translates to 6.752*10^-10 seconds = 0.6752 nanoseconds longer per day.
---
If we all have a boner at the same time, we will collectively be able to last 0.6752 nanoseconds longer in bed
---
They are mad because they always want to be outraged by something jagex is doing.
---
He should shift his focus to diaries, got my account pretty high up :)
---
Yea no reason kebbits or something cant be used as a low level alternative. Would be cool if it was something that could be used in a convenience situation rather than combat training. Example: there are rabbits in the elf area that you can kill for food if you run low during the quest. Maybe we could have hunter creatures that are dangers and can inflict damage. And you could use their meat to heal while you train if you bring a fire.
---
But when you recovered did you have 1b in the bank? üòÅ
---
Leave gargoyles alone. If anything just remove g mauls from their drop table and make them a grotesque guardians only drop.
---
Very well written, I agree. I think that the most fun part about PKing years ago was that most people didn't care about the meta or having BiS items as much as they do now
---
When I was reading the post I thought they were going to buff it. It was like "We realize the item has a really niche use where it's only useful in tanking in the wilderness. We're going to be nerfing...", like wth.
---
"wake up sheeple?"
---
Players are not meant to be the consecutive board. If anything, it is ridiculous that this community thinks they have a say in the payment of Jagex employees, subscription prices/monetization models (even if the conplaints are valid) etc.
---
Polling is for *in-game content* - including things like Bulwark, yes, but in general, the polling system has worked wonderfully.
---
Doing Zulrah atm, I'm a little confused about what to do at the end of Rotation 1 or Rotation 2. Both end with her Jad phase, then she takes a break from attacking to throw down venom clouds, then she goes into her melee form to finish off the rotation. [The helper I've been using](https://imgur.com/a/sQPwXZ6) says to stand bottom-left during all of this, which makes sense during Jad phase as I can just DPS the entire time, but when she switches into melee form am I just expected to tank a little bit of poison damage in order to dodge her attack?
---
Litterally anything that you'd buy at a store today will get you 50 fps. Unless you happen to be buying at some sort of store that sells exclusively super old PCs.
---
Yea I like that idea. I was thinking of even tracking down a little pack of some type of rodent and maybe even adding some sort of obstacles so that you could get a little agility xp as well
---
Well if it's player attacking you it's skulled because you skull when you attack to other player? Problem is that when someone logs under original attacker or some other way tricks you and you think you are attacking same person who attacked to you first
---
Is there an actual decent way to get a team for TOB when you're just starting out? I don't mean to whine or bitch, but I've been trying to go on a raid for two weeks now and cannot find a team. I've been posting in We Do Raids and joining the Waiting For Mentor chat, but it seems that everyone wants you to have made it to Verzik and/or have a kc. I meet all the minimum stat and gear requirements, so it's nothing to do with that.
---
ur fucking bad lmao try doing it solo then i might be impressed
---
The reaction of a truly new player seeing for the first time a herd of cows appearing  just to donkey kick an Army of frogs would be worth it on it‚Äôs own.
---
Don‚Äôt be a drama queen? My does max mage splash barrages on it then? Retard go fuck urself stick to slayer and cutting logs in the bank
---
In terms of their actual gear they are risking less than that 50k set up. If you want greater defensive bonuses you should bring more items. No single item that you don‚Äôt risk should offer that much defence for a measly cost of 5m. Your bias is clear.
---
The reason people pk in these rags at revs is because every second world is cleared by a massive team and no one wants to lose 1m every time.
---
WHYYYY are you reading it that way. 
---
"The bulwark, while yes it is useless in most parts of the game, in the one place it is used, it is currently very overpowered, so we're nerfing it a bit" MAKES COMPLETE SENSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY
---
Yeah space mac slave having a cry as usual lmao
---
Jesus most this games life never had bs like the bulwark but all the rs3 refugees feel entitled to be invincible in wild for the wildy pvm skilling content they voted in while failing the actual pvp shit.
---
No, I don't keep up with the latest social trends of generic white people it's a damn shame. Must be missing out on somthing if yall are out here shotguning whiteclaws.
---
You get Sriracha sauce
---
You ok?
---
It took me a while to even want to try again.
---
Jagex's opinion and the law of certain counties are entirely separate things. Game companies claim the exact same thing. You're only buying a license to play their product, so you shouldn't have a right to sell it at pawn shops. They forbid you to do it, but people do it anyways because there's nothing they can do about it.
---
we need fishing of the land now
---
No. This isn't QOL and gives an actual very big advantage to only those using Runelite. This should not be a plugin, it should be done by the actual devs.
---
Or better yet, make it that the only way to get skulled is to ask the emblem trader for skulls. If you ok without skill you get less of what you would get when pking. No one can get skulled in the wild unless they ask the emblem trader. Also, if you do get skulled you get the normal loot that you would have gotten otherwise without the update. That way, pvmers can have other items saved and not lose as much to those who aren‚Äôt skulled. Also one item protect should be abolish in all worlds for those who are skulled in the wild.
---
Lmao talking to you IRL must be like talking to a brick wall
---
Gzzz
---
Huh?
---
"Can't even use it to get wines/chins in wild now, useless junk from end game content." 
---
Uhhh dude. Take a step back and consider your options for a moment. Yeah...bulwark is still BIS for tanking. Not useless junk!
---
No man. I don‚Äôt know who hurt you,but to try and ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù with the social trends by calling a video that was suppose to be funny ‚Äúdepressing‚Äù really shows where your mental state is. Hope you have a support system my man. It‚Äôs just a joke. Don‚Äôt take it literally.
---
Honestly wild is dying, i quit because legit everyone was only doing gmaul in 50-70 bracket...might actually come back after this. We need a change, switch up the meta.
---
So turn off accept aid.
---
getting skull tricked in 2019 LUL
---
I mean, not all internships are free? I guess I'm not familiar with coding nor UK internships.
---
may as well just use an ely because it gives dmg reduction instantly
---
Sit kid
---
But you got pet already, its 1/5000 so i think ur very lucky.
---
But the point is Jagex doesn't want us to use it in a lot of places... only in super niche places like raids.
---
They are trolling there is not glitched rng. Also skeletons/monsters in crypts have no effect on item droprate. The skeletons/monsters change what amount of runes/bolt racks you get. Just killing all brothers make the drop rate 1/17. You are just unlucky.
---
I doubt ArbalistDev said it ironically
---
Yeah that was the problem trying to look up guides lmao, everyone kills her before the jad phase ends
---
My timing is still a little scuffed since I'm learning all the rotations, I have 87 range and 83 mage atm with decent gear so maybe once I get better I just won't have to worry about it anymore
---
Yeah, just eat 120 hp in two ticks.
---
damn, i believe people way too readily to play ball on this sub lol. thanks for letting me know mate
---
No it gives you agility exp
---
its only being nerfed because jagex doesnt want us to use it at wilderness
---
Does it? Did I miss the hundreds of NPC's around wild that makes solo pking in singles near impossible
---
Mini-dailes are a terrible idea and there's a difference between slightly changing a house and adding one or two NPCs to make players aware of brand new worthwhile content vs adding a bunch of pointless shit, a handful of NPCs, a new house and an agility course.
---
Boi that's Doom not Halo.
---
Good. Gmaul is cancer for pking. Especially with xp drops so your opponent knows if they are hitting you hard before you do.
---
And the shield remains dead content
---
&gt;else we all look biased.
---
so you're telling me you're not, joke of the day
---
Yeah. A bunch of voting adults were selfish and voted to keep them in because they decided they didn't have enough time to do it legit. Unpolled changes are required at times.
---
Pretty sure they'll be polling this in 5 days, not forcing it through
---
Jiggleflex: "Why don't the majority of players like our play space?"

Take this to 25_Buttholes (Savage Robot) YouTube channel where all his boys have permission to light you up in the comment section
---
Hey buddy, you seem a bit lost.  Have you ran into trouble backing up that "voting isn't a right" claim of yours?  Sit kid.
---
You probably wouldn‚Äôt last one month back in 07. You‚Äôd probably cry about dying to a quest boss and not being able to pay 100k for your items back. 
---
Pathetic.
---
Is that 750k RC xp? Fuck it bro. 
---
You can add whatever you want, Jagex.
---
Gmaul is popular because its broken as fuck. Not because it's cheap and fun. It being cheap is just a benefit of people who use it.
---
&gt; I hereby declare everyone should get a free tbow. I demand Jagex integrity update that into the game 
---
This isnt an integrity update at all, this is bad for the game.
---
I never fight back now but I'd absolutely fight back with this option. It would be fun to take my ballista out and try to drop some shit pkers on my ironman without worrying about having to slave through another 2k demonics to get it back.
---
True, but it's still an option to expand the lore in such direction that there would be a guthix boss somehow.
---
It's a fantasy game afterall ;)
---
A garden of moderate left wing leaning normal people?
---
With Salve? They don't have high defence by any means but they are certainly not crabs.
---
I've never done that content so I don't know. But does it count the tortured gorillas? Is it possible OP is simply killing the wrong gorillas? Because that'd be a 46.83% chance, which seems a lot more likely.
---
 potato cacti arent the same chance as normal cacti.
---
Good idea, make pvming in the wilderness even more braindead than it already is.
---
Im the one arguing to make the game from becoming too easy to please idiots. It's the easiest thing to see a skull trick.
---
I was trying to read this to the tune of bonkers by dizzy rascal
---
How do they compare to Target bags?
---
This 100%. I have a very big love for nh pking. I have a maxed main and maxed pure on osrs, but I almost never renew my osrs subscription and exclusively play private pk servers for this very reason. I have 1000s of hours of no honor pking experience, and can confidently say I am one of the best no honor player killers to ever play the game. Regardless, every time I log onto osrs without fail, I run into clans of people. Lots of the time I'll be fighting someone and beating them bad, but then they call a clan of people to fall in on me, and there's no way to fight back or escape. Especially as a 1 def pure when you can't tank a team of meds there's literally no fucking point.
---
Go to lava maze tele, get hit by clans. Go to east dragons, hit by clans. Black chins? hit by clans. Surely mage bank is safe? Nope, hit by clans. Wines of zammy? clans. West dragons? clans. Lvl 20 graves must be safe right?? No wrong, clans here too. The list goes on and on. It makes the game very unfun for me and devalues my solo pking skill. 
---
Multi is a thing for a reason. Clans should be able to do their thing there, but spec trading and trading agro in singles just completely kills the game mode for lone players like me who don't want to join a clan
---
Check if yout payments have gone through for what youve baught. Ive had this happen to me ages ago where another payment came off my card making the runescape one bounce but because it took a few days i had technically recieved 3 days of free membership for which i was then account frozen and charged a weird amount which only ended up giving me one month of members and the rest in "j coins" or something that is a currency used on jagex platforms which i still have no idea how to spend
---
Right-alt spergs?
---
? This calculation takes 1 minute with the dps calculator he is using. Give Bitterkoekjes dps calculator a Google search.
---
They should not be changing PvM gear/meta because of PvP
---
N'wah!
---
This is the content I desire
---
No
---
I know.  As a runescape player for 14 years it means nothing. They've killing PKing all over again and it's a shame.
---
But there's already auto retaliate option? Or you could actually use your brain and carefully check who is attacking you.
---
 they might aswell just delete the blow pipe from the game
---
Instructions unclear, spade stuck in ram slot. My PC seems to be digging it though.
---
They usually conceptualize new stuff before polling though
---
This looks like a large amount of kc done before collection log.
---
A+ photoshop
---
I mean I'm kinda pulling their leg but many internships are exploitative
---
They should make it so each fruit deposited has a 26% (or just lower to 25%) chance to give you a point, and then give you an unlimited amount of seeds.
---
I would also be open to having the lowest seeds give 20%, mid seeds 25%, and high seeds 30% chances.
---
"Oh well I disagree with this so it's not an integrity update"
---
You're such a joke man.  You tried to claim that the same people complaining about this change originally supported this (FAKE NEWS), then retreated from that and now are prattling on about "oh well as long as I think this is a good idea let's just ignore the poll system that's keeping this game alive".
---
Like bitch we have a process for determining whether something is good for the game, it's called discussing and then voting.  If you're actually so much of a brainlet that you're willing to jerk off to a proposed subversion of community feedback because to you personally it seems like a good idea, then I mean, enjoy pking eating massive shit due to the horrendously executed maul nerf that Jagex are also pushing through.  
---
Fake "integrity updates" are a double-edged sword and children like you shouldn't play with sharp objects.
---
s
---
25 btw
---
Just been looking through your posts and I notice that you‚Äôre either 12 or really, really stupid. Which one is it??
---
what the actual..... How the freak did you do that?! teach me sempai!!
---
Yeah if you‚Äôre a wuss. Lava directly on the back is the way to show dominance.
---
In sofware development you often give interns the chance to develop something new. That's good for them. It's not free labor if you do it right. There's a lot of guidance required, and work after to fix their shit.
---
It's a pretty simple concept that if you give someone (especially a group of people, many of whom have invested years into something) a choice about changing something they're very passionate about, and then completely ignore that choice, that you're going to spark outrage. 
---
If jagex wanted to, and intended to, make this change regardless of community approval, they shouldn't have polled it. Anyone over the age of ten should have the basic level of understanding of human mentality to know that asking for someone's opinion and then going against it anyways would make them upset.
---
Because then it's not just that you didn't do what they wanted (changing something in a way they don't like) you're also openly slapping them in the face and saying "fuck you and your opinion" by pretending to care.
---
So basically you dont play f2p at all, this update doesnt effect you to the slightest but yet you took the time to vote no six times.
---
Wow man.
---
Someone got killed 3 times in a row...
---
Tbh blackjacking is the one plugin im not positive is safe but not 100% sure
---
Goopile
---
GoopiIe
---
Can you tell the difference?
---
Capital I and lowercase L looks the exact same
---
Ruined them piling lone players that have no chance at all?
---
That's gameplay that needs to be ruined
---
What's the point of adding this if you already have an alt?
---
When do the proposed integrity changes described in the small changes blog implemented into the game?
---
Pretty sure how magic defense currently works is that the game takes 30% of your defense lvl + 70% of magic level and multiplies that number by equipment stats. So magic defense stat is just as valuable as other defense stats.
---
Where do you get these numbers from? 
---
The PvP community is big. Yes there‚Äôs people who pk in rag but there‚Äôs also A LOT who pk in decent gear. 
---
There‚Äôs many of us not even Pking till we get a real PvP update. The state of PvP right now is a disaster.
---
I did it a couple of days ago and found that praying range during the 3rd phase instead of magic massively reduced how much damage I took
---
Nobody cares loser
---
Oh god please bring back Arcanists! Add it as a side game kinda hidden on the osrs homepage like RS Classic was.
---
If you fear you're going to get targeted by how much money you've thrown away with just your display name available as a lead (the thing everyone and their nan can see if they just right click your character), maybe don't throw away inordinate amounts of wealth. 
---
Or you know, make an alt and do it.
---
Nice.
---
However, this will be a good addition for Castle Wars, even Entangle. Have you seen how hard it is to take down a full rune-armoured player?
---
Bad luck dude. Nice cover up but next time dont bot.
---
Because some changes need to not be polled. It would be like if you needed t nerf a BIS item because it just destroys the balance of the game, it would still be really hard to get the community to agree to nerf it.
---
There are for sure changes that just have to happen even if most of the community would disagree.
---
This particular case is obviously bad though. It's literally end game raid item with literally almost no uses, and the one thing it's okay at is getting hard nerfed.
---
This would be okay, if they planned on reworking the item at the same time. But for all we know it could end up totally useless.
---
Lmao, replies like this and then people wonder why PvP polls don't pass. Skull tricking doesn't encourage PvP at all, just creates more loot for a very specific niche of people who bother to make similarly named accounts and sit there at the login screen waiting to login for someone to click on them by accident.
---
That‚Äôs a similar thing to signing a promise to your mum that you won‚Äôt masterbate, as a 15 year old kid! Lol not gunna happen
---
When I saw "dhins rework" my first thought was oh fuck I just sold that for a bond rip, then oh lol nvm
---
TBH they already set that precedent with making bp 3 tick in pvp or releasing the ballista without a poll.
---
Gambling should be out of the game entirely. Belgium already banning loot boxes etc.
---
I think that it's pretty cool too, but I think multi would have to be reworked because at the moment with the heal other spell it's too difficult for another clan to come in.
---
Just for convenience. As you say you can already kill someone and use an alt to pick up their loot, but the alt needs to be logged in the same world before the kill and be placed close enough to the ironman to be able to loot. You also need to wait for the loot to appear and it will appear to everyone else not just the alt. This would take care of all these annoyances without any additional benefit.
---
I agree, Ive come to see Hard clues simply as wilderness clues.
---
Do authenticators And login attempt lockouts not factor in to this? I'm not arguing but just curious. I suppose a program trying all the time would work over time without the owner knowing, but what about authenticators?
---
It's very easy to understand. Skull tricking is not in the spirit of PKing. This would remove skull tricking. This is good for the game. Doesn't matter how dumb people are for not knowing how to avoid skull tricks.
---
if only there was a setting in the game about not left clicking players lul
---
Turning on auto retaliate allows you to see who is hitting you when people are falled in on you.
---
Yeah, but why not a pking alt that can actually loot PvPers?
---
For example in deep wild team vs team in singles is a thing, and it's a completely different experience to team vs team in multi.
---
In any team individuals will likely specialise in some aspects. In pking the main ones would be tber/tank/hybrid. To give an example on how the above breaks everything I'll look at the TBer - The tbers sole purpose is to prevent people from fleeing via teleports and because of the setup are often outclassed by the tanks and hybrids in a one-on-one fight. Their role is to tb, not to fight. If the proposed system were in place one of two things can happen: if an enemy attacks the TBer there is no way for friendly tanks or hybrids to 'take' them. Similarly the TBer can't quickly step in and tb a target unless that target currently isn't shooting. You can completely disable an enemies ability to tb you by having a friend in dhides and a crystal bow rag them. 
---
The point of teams in single is teamwork, if someone is having trouble with an enemy better suited for another member of your team you want to be able to help them out.
---
A lot of people view single as 'edgeville' but that simply isn't the case, the deeper you go the more dangerous it is and the more utility is obtained from teamwork. 
---
Proposing a blanket ban over 'tagging' in all single areas completely destroys an entire aspect of pking and grants ultimate power to raggers to harass and annoy legitimate pkers. Imagine watching your favourite streamer do nothing for hours on end because people are kicking him and noone can get them off him so he can actually do something etc. 
---
At the end of the day edgeville is not the same as dingle and what works there doesn't always work elsewhere. It's unfortunate when a soloer gets caught by a team when they go deep but that's the point of the wilderness... The deeper you go the more dangerous it is, if you don't like that possibility then stick to edge.
---
"should we keep partnerships out of the game?"
---
"No."
---
Fuck
---
Take that to the sand casino and you have yourself a t bow ;)
---
I think this a great idea
---
i didnt, im literally asking if theres anyway a Jmod or something can check into my account to see that i wasnt even active during the time of the ban, or further investigate because im THAT 100% positive, i did not bot. Is that not a thing? or?
---
Melee has splashing now??
---
There are ways a few ways to get into an account without it. Some of the webpage log ins don‚Äôt require authenticator to access an account. 
---
Also a lot of players don‚Äôt use them. (I know it sounds stupid but it‚Äôs true)
---
Not gonna bother reading that big waste of time, you gonna send me your rsn or what mate? Still waiting for you to teach me in-game about pvp
---
I‚Äôm not even OP I just find it funny how you flipped your shit from such a simple comment, get some help ma dude, once you get to the real world you can‚Äôt just be a toxic prick all the time
---
Hit the nail on the head. Only so much client side can do and if you use AOE you can't guarantee to not skull. I made a toggle for RSC/RS2/RS3 menus for a private server so I can't input much about client side but that is what I do know
---
Who the fuck pls on Ironman accounts anyways?
---
We've seen it many times on the sub. You botted on it. Own up to it and either quit or start a new account. Your account is lost.
---
He definately wouldn't do the same.
---
Besides only virgins dont check their inventory before stakes
---
Instead of a gem bag I would prefer a Sack of Coal. Coal is incredibly annoying to accumulate for ironmen that it brings smithing grind to a halt.
---
Yes I use it, ignoring the typed up comment too I guess and formatting pictures in post with text
---

---
Have an upvote for my lost pegasian boots
---
well that sounds not to shabby :D thanks or the advise!
---
Light me up baby.
---
I'm quite sure most radical ones live in african or middle eastern countries where there is war.
---
Except the -10 nerf will be unnoticeable, all the ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù change does is make players whine about unpolled changes(which is probably justified). There is no reason to celebrate from either side.
---
Lol. Okay let's say it is as you say. So what can I do as a skilled player to avoid getting skull tricked? Only two things I can think of are skulling up on purpose, or not fighting at all.
---
You want f2p range to max 19s at a rapid speed vs lobsters and swordfish? Clueless boy.
---
Man, logging out to avoid combat sounds like some really fantastic PvP experience!
---
This seriously just shows how broken PvP really is, that it feels good to log out to avoid it.  Damn that's just shit.
---
I‚Äôll guild your rune armor, just trade me 5k and the gear so I can trim it up nice ;)
---
Entitled PvMers just want PvP to die. Expected.
---
Soon after the company was purchased last time they introduced MTX with this partnership idea being right around the same time I wouldn't say its coincidence  *i like how i say "I DONT THINK THIS BODES WELL" and you turn it into a "POSI VIBES ONLY" post btw*
---
Not to mention they scam players, usually new ones, who end up quitting.  They also buy hacked accounts to do this one, which promotes hacking, AND they RWT which lowers bond sales.  They're horrible for the game, jagex really should ban them even if they have to set a j-mod to hop around every world every day and ban them manually.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter about the law of certain countries - Jagex is a British company therefore British law applies
---
By removing skull tricking methods in those select areas, you would single handedly remove all the value from pkers who frequent that location. Chaos druids is a great place for low levels to train and make somewhat decent money doing it, pkers go there on the off chance that one will skull and make it worth their time. Elders is a bit different as its now almost completely dead altogether, BUT I still like the concept of some lone skull tricker hopping worlds to try and find a whale. 
---
To clarify I'm NOT condoning clan based skull tricking methods but I do think its good to keep the aforementioned skull tricking methods around along with a few more to compensate pkers to go pking in spots other than edgeville ditch, rev caves, Wildy bosses, ect.
---
My final point comes from the viewpoint of someone who has multiple pures of all combat brackets. YOU CAN'T FIGHT BACK IN THE USUAL HOTSPOTS! I can't solo revs and even if I could there'd be a maxed main on my 1 defense ass in no time. These skull tricks are fun and unique ways to revitalize for low level pkers.
---
Who's jagex? You mean jAmFl0x?
---
People who criticize someone‚Äôs grammar/spelling in an argument do so because they can‚Äôt think of anything actually relevant to insult them with
---
These calcs are really good, props to OP.
---
But have to be taken with a pinch of salt when put into a real scenario. Obviously, they don't account for the extra time spent frozen due to the magic defence nerf. While these may only show 43, 30, and 32 extra damage over 5 minutes for the above scenario's, landing even one extra freeze will result in roughly triple that extra damage taken.
---
If you die to a salad boy you're doing something wrong.
---
Someone's wearing range armor and another person is expecting a magic attack to land and it doesn't?  That sounds like it's working to me.
---
What a snooze fest.... you must be one of the pvpers who only pick on pvmers... once you see another person skulled up you logout.
---
Pvmers that are in the wild do not want to get pked, they arent there to pk but to skill/ clue/ slayer so why should it be nerfed if the shield is there to obviously be able to escape clans and rushers
---
Except they are breaking real world laws LMFAO
---
Couldn't care less for gmaul nerf as long as Dinhs gets nerfed.
---
Speaking as someone who is outraged, specifically because they ignored the poll results, no. You are objectively wrong. I have no problem with integrity changes, but I do have a problem with betraying the trust of your players. So, had they not polled it at all, I at least would not have been outraged. It is therefore an objective FACT that the outrage would not have been the same. At the bare minimum, there would be one fewer outraged players. You're wrong.
---
Uh oh, big pker YouTubers are gonna flame this thread on their twitter accounts! Cause fuck anyone who isn‚Äôt killing puppies in the wildy!
---
It has a use, tanking and it will still do a good job of that after the nerf
---
Runespan lol wrong game
---
because it would ruin this game lol
---
Getting scammed is almost an essential part of RuneScape. That‚Äôs the kind of shit teaching kids in a video game real life lessons. There shouldn‚Äôt be any kinds of safety nets or rules in the wilderness, that‚Äôs some real life shit. Just like in real life if you fight back when people are fucking with you there‚Äôs always a chance things can get worse.
---
While I'm on Jagex's side, hear me out.  It can be in the TOS all it wants, doesn't mean Jagex's TOS trumps any legal standing on the matter around the world.  Many times TOS conditions can get thrown out of court, at least in my country.
---
how about adding t60 weapons and armor to f2p.
---
Watch the framed video to understand this better. Its not "oh no i spam clicked on this pile of loot and someone logged in under". Its "What do you mean this level 76 guy named ItIIIlsDl is not the same level 76 guy named ItlllllsDl i was just attacking? Why am i skulled???"
---
Cant go a single day without having a Serene in my comment section
---
&gt; Now you're just arguing semantics. Of course ironmen shouldn't be able to "loot" stuff from other people in the meaning that they'd pick an item off the ground and use it to benefit their account. But if it's just picking the item off the ground to drop it to another account it really doesn't undermine any fundamental aspects of being an ironman like you claim it does.
---
?????????
---
Im not sure you understand what the word "semantics" actually means if you trying to say im arguing isemantics here, because im clearly not if you understood what that meant.
---
It doesnt undermine the fundamental aspect of of ironmen..? **Oh you mean the one where they cant loot things others drop in PVP??** I mean holy shit what kind of mental gymnastics did you have to do to actually convince yourself of that?
---
&gt; Show me how this would allow ironman accounts to benefit from other players or your point is invalid.
---
Not sure if serious, you must be trolling.

Theres a huge difference between killing a player a player for an AGS as an ironman in PvP, and then dropping it to your main and going to grind to earn one at Arma and then dropping it to your main. Its not about just the ironman account. Youre undermining a core feature of the game mode in order to make the account way more profitable than before, regardless of the fact you still cant use it. They obviously made the game mode like that for a reason. 
---
What about accounts like Kemp Q's 10 hp ironman pure account that he PKs on? He has a distinct advantage because he cant gain XP in PvP, hed profit a ton from that advantage while other accounts could NEVER be as strong as him at the same CB because they gain XP.
---
Or are you genuinely trying to say theres absolutely no difference between the two? In which case, may god have mercy on your soul if you dont see the difference there.

I've been at MLM for the last hour and a half and still got tons done lol

Only people worse than bots are those who bitch about people bitching about bots

I've made at least 100M over the years from drop parties
---
Hmm, big think time. Maybe if you did, this nerf wouldn‚Äôt happen, if people used above tier 30 gear and risked some scratch of their own they could kill someone using the bulwark, but no big titty baby pkers have mommy Jagex fix the bad bad pvmers only method of escaping
---
The more times it gets passed over to someone else the more opportunity there is for them to ruin the game
---
There are plenty of other viable options (dbow, xbow, ballista, dds etc)
---
I do this sometimes! Works pretty well

They are based in England, the UK has got quite the drinking culture running through it. I find it funny that kebabs seem to go with beers quite a lot during some of the quests (a favorite drunk meal of the Brits). Their office still has a drinks bar inside also, I'm really not sure if they are allowed to drink on the job but I could be wrong.

The top is not PUBG, it is Fortnite's but it was terrible made as it was made for GMoD the base game this was made on. I would know it was terrible made as I made it for GMoD. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1351566264

Ancient mace + BGS smiting are some of the biggest bullshits in the game.  This is a big thing that keeps people from going into multi in the first place.

I'm simply comparing the fact that I have a much higher chance of dying by simply being in the wilderness without a dongs. I'm not gonna plank to most people in the wilderness

We're all living an illusion

It's not the game it's you, most people are addicted to the sand casino or grinding, not cheating

And items like then bulwark reduce the interest in fighting even more.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I heard the word rework and then I immediately thought ‚Äúmaybe I should buy one because maybe it will get better.  Maybe jagex might try to make tanking an actual mechanic that is really useful!‚Äù
---
Nope. Item is just getting nerfed so it‚Äôs less useful.
---
Please explain why framed name is there ?

It's not. Half the players will leave with any form of MTX. They can profit off that, but the experience will be ruined for all

Using up 1k worth of supplies to kill you =/= investing your life savings.

People are worried because we are not talking about membership anymore, we are talking about currently redecorating your damn house out of all things and other "cosmetics".
---
We don't know what corperations they want to work with, the blog they made about it was hot garbage and not transparent at all.
---
Jagex has one of the worst community managers i've seen other then god damn steam.
---
I dont personally see a few harmless cosmetic purchases as predatory unless they go overboard as they did in rs3. 
---
No daily rewards, no currencies, no lootboxes. Just a one time purchase for a cosmetic that you can choose to pay for via bond.
---
That‚Äôs 100% ok with me. Gmaul is op for only a 30k risk

Being able to sell back gold to 3rd parties may be against jamflex‚Äôs terms of use. But it is not braking the law provided you a paying the correct taxation rate. This is generally sited in cases of this kind and will be taken into account if proof of transactions is provided. 
---
It‚Äôs sad to say that as long as there is a demand for something then it holds value in real terms. 
---
Jamflex are very on it in regards to real world trading and the reason for this is because if they were not active in suppressing 3rd parties, their case would be far weekend. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to rain on your parade here, I have very strong feelings for the game and it hurts me to see it fall down this way.

must suck to not have 99 prayer...

Why are you hunting pvm?? How is that interesting?? If you want to pvp go to a pvp world. If you hunt pvm you are a garbage pvper

I hope you don't kiss your sister with that mouth.

Pkers will just vote no to it like they did with spellbook resizing
---
Why should that be bannable....

Ok i see how that could potentially lead to problems although i dont personally think its an issue as long as it remains cosmetic and isnt tied to any of the addictive and predatory practices discussed in other comment threads.

Because you enjoy the false sense of accomplishment..

RNG is a fickle mistress my friend.

I recently ran out of Hespori seeds, too. Throw in a few mid-level fruit tree runs and you should get a few seeds again. Contracts are also a good way to collect Hespori seeds!

I'm pretty sure you get them from herbs but the chance is a lot lower than Fruit trees iirc
---
Yea same I also recently did my hunter grind and got attacked by Monni in full max (risking 600m+) + his tb friend. Im shit at tanking and still survived all the way to the ditch with tons of supplies left, never coming close to dying. I watched the vod after and he even commented on how shit I was at prayer switching. Don't know why people think that is okay, and a 10 def nerf is barely anything either. If anything, thats what I would be mad about, people are still going to use it to the same effect.
---
Don‚Äôt go in the wild if you don‚Äôt like dying it‚Äôs a dangerous area quit crying on Redding because you lost a black shoes set

this game does not need an in game shop. Fuck that, I will be out of here so fucking fast. This is one of the only 'pure' games left for me.

The amount of salt required to type this up is scary

My argument is that we should be working to make things better. I don‚Äôt think that MTX is the hot ticket to that in any way and personally will focus on finding new ways for companies to ‚Äúethically monetize‚Äù(if there is such a thing)

What are these tiers? Order of ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù or rarity? Watcha getting at here?

Not anymore, cuz they threw away all their bank's worth! XD
---
Yes this is exactly what i'm saying. I am also a PvMer but am curious about doing PvP, have tried it before, but am not really invested in it. But this change would be terrible for the game as a whole which is why i'm against it.
---
It will completely disadvantage new or poor players (let alone ironmen), and will certainly stunt pvp growth. 
---
This is the worst idea for a gmaul change I've ever heard.
---
I strongly support leaving it at 50%. It's iconic old school. But if you want to nerf it to %60, I can't stop you. But this proposed "integrity" change is absolutely abysmal. No ironman is ever going pay 10m bh points for an always-lost-on-death enhancement to a granite maul, (nor will noobs/poor/etc) putting them at a huge disadvantage when trying to defend themselves, or when trying to pvp themselves. This is not the same as "Ags being a 14m weapon so its more powerful," the gmaul is a completely separate beast and cannot be compared on any level.  You cannot give this item only to the rich/powerful, with a weaker, essentially worthless version for everyone else to have.

&gt; Pvmers that are in the wild do not want to get pked, they arent there to pk but to skill/ clue/ slayer so why should it be nerfed if the shield is there to obviously be able to escape clans and rushers

Because you're in the fucking wild bro, EXPECT TO DIE
---
Can it made possible to sell pieces of the Angler outfit back to Alry the Angler for Molch pearls - maybe 80% of the buy-price?

Sorry to break it to you, but that is not a pet. That is just a potion on the ground.
---
I sure hope you are not an ironman, because that would mean you could not even pick it up.
---
Rarity and how hard is it to get the pet, I just realised mole should be in tier F instead of E
---
A quick look at RS3 disagrees
---
Since when did it become a law that companies are required to make money? So you‚Äôre saying a failing company is literally breaking a law?
---
I get that. Which is why i said to allow paying via bonds. How is that any different from paying gold to an in game shop to change your house style? As long as the prices and what you can purchase stays reasonable, i think its fine for game integrity.
---
Pvp should be dead if that‚Äôs what they have to do to make people go to the wild
---
Would you consider adding prayer requirements for being able to bury/offer bones at altars? Currently the only bones that have a requirement to bury/offer at altars is superior dragon bones (level 70). Prayer is the only(?) skill that uses resources and doesn‚Äôt (well except for one type of bone) have a requirement to use higher resources or/and gain the highest XP rates. I would suggest something similar to the below level-requirements:
---
* No requirements: Regular-, burnt-, wolf-, monkey- and bat bones
---
* Level 15: Big-, jogre-, zogre- and shaikahan bones
---
* Level 30: Babydragon- and wyrm bones
---
* Level 50: Dragon-, wyvern- and drake bones
---
* Level 60: Fayrg-, lava- and raurg bones
---
* Level 70: Hydra-, dagannoth- and superior dragon bones
---
* Level 80: Ourg bones
---
* Possible extra level requirement or other requirement to use altars and such?
---
BUT HOW CAN I WEAR TWO NECK GEAR ITEMS
---
Would be better if the pixels were more like crack to you. Maybe you‚Äôd click for your own fire cape and gp. RS3 has lots of MTX though, since you‚Äôve joined the dark side already may as well give Jagex your money instead of foreign bot farms etc.
---
google the monster first, like every other slayer task you should have failed like this before...
---
Insane! What is your method? Ill get 200m herblore in under two hours.
---
point taken. i can only speak from what i see when i enter the wildy and you're right i dont spent all my time there especially at those high population spots but again my point is theres more than enough incentive for non pkers to enter the wilderness but there doesnt seem to be enough for people to fight each other, and if there is as you've suggested then as a genuine question could you explain exactly what is the issue from your POV?
---
Dhide is very strong for how cheap it is tbf
---
They must've lowered the drop rate a few months after release because I was getting the solely from herb patches at a reasonable rate. Time to plant fruit trees!
---
If it prevents all possibility of offense... then yes it should
---
aw cmon I love this dudes videos hes great
---
You don't need BIS.
---
Which is supposed to be the whole point right? Its a two handed defensive item that, when you use, you forfeit the ability to fight back, so shouldn't it make you really tanky? What other purpose does it have? And we're taking away from the sole purpose it serves why? So people in 40k robes can hit a freeze? Wouldn't it make more sense to incentivize PKers to use higher tier robes like ahrims that give bonuses worth risking to actually hit a freeze?
---
It would be cool if they could change the skull color and name color (or add a little skull to the name) whenever someone attacks you first. That way you know who you can attack. And yeah someone that attempts to fight back is more interesting than someone panic clicking his brews while trying to run south.
---
But then when they've pumped it for short term profits, the value will drop because of mass-quitting and unsubscribing. It's in their best interest to keep 07 mtx free. They will 100% be told (or already have) that mtx in 07 is a terrible idea.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt pkers want to target pvmers/skillers? I get the rationale of pkers fighting other pkers but would the point of a pker be to target anyone and everyone in the wild?
---
If it‚Äôs too true to be real it‚Äôs not real. Also don‚Äôt try to ever scam a scammer, they‚Äôre always a step ahead. Don‚Äôt trust anyone, they can be your friend but don‚Äôt trust them with anything ur not afraid of losing.
---
Bonds **are** a no-brainer. The problem is that "partnerships" aren't in any way similar to bonds. Bonds provide no benefit aside from membership, which is and should remain the one purchasable benefit this game has to offer.
---
An easier fix might be to change the icon of the skull if they have attacked you, that way atleast you can visually see who has and hasn't hit you
---
I thought IVP still owned before this buy   
---
  
---
WANT TO SAY 1 THING INCASE MODS SEE THIS  
---
the only twitch partnership that was lit was the free membership
---
Bud how about no cause I use most of that gear in pvm...
---
&gt; They don't want anyone to get a lucky gmaul stack defending themselves. 
---
I'm pretty sure the gmaul spec change will help PvMers more than it hurts them. Less Pkers using gmaul to smack you down.
---
&gt; They don't want anyone tanking them anymore.
---
Dihns Bulwark stats would go from: 
---
&gt; +141 +145 +145 +18 +148
---
to
---
&gt; +131 +135 +135 +8 +138
---
For comparison, here is the defensive stats of an Ely:
---
&gt;+63 +65 +75 +2 +57
---
Ely also reduces average damage by 17.5%, but still, the huge gulf in stats between the two is significant. 
---
The changes to Dihns is hardly going to cripple its tanking use.
---
&gt; i agree on the risk/reward side, i'd disagree with not being enough people at the widly bosses though, even at the best times vene/vetion/callisto are pretty populated (i have to hop a fair bit to get free worlds)
---
Honestly I dont even go to those bosses anymore, partly because some of the area is multi and because I rarely ever saw other PKers to fight there a lot of the time and if I did it was a team of 2-4. The point is still true though, for the risk of those bosses compared to how profitable they are (and that risk obviously plays a large role, if you die with loot or have to tele away and reset etc) it leaves very little inventive to do them over something like Vork which is an incredibly easy 3m+/hr.
---
&gt;  i just don't see adding more free targets helping (which is what will happen over and over again) it just makes that toxic divide between pvmers/pkers which will just make less people want to enter the wildy and forcing people into the wildy is just a terrible idea 
---
The thing is though, people WOULD want to enter the Wildy (and would probably go in teams) if there was enough incentive at a boss or something else. You dont think if a boss was introduced that was lets say...a wildy slayer specific boss(or something, doesnt have to be) that was 4-5+m/hr assuming little to no disruption/deaths that people wouldnt have incentive to go do it? People would definitely do it, and itd be big enough incentive for them to actually learn how to tank or Anti PK and come prepared so that they could stay there and not get hit off by a PKer. I think people would also start to do that in little PvM teams of anti pkers (I think PvMers who also PK would 100% do this) because there would be a big enough incentive. Or maybe there could be some other non monetary incentive as well. The point being though, if they want to add a boss or something to the wilderness they HAVE to overcompensate the profitability because of the additional risk, which is how it SHOULD be imo. Because of the extra risk you have to take, you should be rewarded as such, thats how it SHOULD work.
---
I see your point but I completely disagree that this is actually how runescape players think. I don't think a single one of us gives a shit if f2p's get some mems only stuff from the standard spellbook lol.
---
I'm just reiterating what you said to agree but yeah if only 10% of the community actually realizes just how broken something is, and the other 90% are in denial/don't care/don't know, it's going to be an integrity change.
---
???
---
\&gt;because a bunch of pkers complain about it suddenly they have to make an integrity change. 
---
We have pvm rats crying about removing skulltricking (lol) and bragging about "tanking" (lol) in PvP with a shield that is designed for PvM. It's been brought to their attention that it needs to be fucking nerfed because it's completely broken in PvP.
---
&gt; the value will drop because of mass-quitting and unsubscribing
---
no it wont. the whales buying the mtx shit will more than make up for the people quitting. look at rs3, despite having far lower player counts now they're making more than they ever did.
---
MFW I own all H tier pets but no high tier pets lol
---
I see that Link pose
---
My exact thoughts.
---
Rarely see one on a total level world, so use those or the RL plug in to hide their spam until Jagex removes the crown from PMod &amp; people learn to stop falling for 2006-level scams.
---
When the wild becomes void of pkers and the major risk of wild goes away I‚Äôll bet ya anything the rewards in the form of drops and xp will be nerfed in the name of integrity.
---
Yeah you can't get to 55 slayer without understanding the concept that some monsters cant be killed normally.
---
I mean they could always do whatever they wanted, and I‚Äôm sure they have been doing just that since oldschool was released
---
I'm pretty sure it's music from a game called Old School Runescape
---
Yea turns out when group A has fun at no expense and group B only has fun at group A's expense, there's some friction between the 2 groups.

idk I've read a large amount of comments that make remarks in the same vein, and say that "back in my day i didnt have that so why should they" and so on so forth. A lot of players now vote no to any QoL change for new players TODAY because they think everyone should have to lay the game the same way they did when they were 13 and had the same frustrations players had now.
---
It's like if your grandfather was polled on whether his grandchildren should have to walk up a hill both ways every day to get to school and back, but ever asking the grandchild.

Gl spending an eternity at BA to get pet. That pet takes forever and just because it‚Äôs 1/1000 doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get it at 1000. And leaching your way to pet will take ages, clearly you haven‚Äôt spent much time at BA
---
That title is way too long but have an upvote for spreading the spirit of giving
---
One of the runelite dev's commented on the other post about skulltricking and said they wouldn't be able to add this as a feature as it's clientside only and could cause issues. So it's pretty fair not to trust RL with a plugin like that...
---
Why go to the wild with the expectation of safety?
---
How many miles do you do a year that you need new tires every year? Seems excessive for just daily driving unless you track or autox the car
---
Or maybe jagex should update their 12 year old UI at some point.
---
Monka S my dude I too had a similar experience I was playing fortnite‚Äôs disco domination game mode while I was afking in nmz on my RuneScape account and sure enough as soon  me and my sister managed to clutch a win I look to my monitor and there was a max cape sitting in my inventory on my RuneScape character I could not believe my eyes!
---
This client is C L A S S
---
Tbh, most of these, if it takes a while for Jagex to fix there's something behind it.
---
Because you're basically just saying ''Fix this error!'' Why wouldn't they have already if it was that simple right?
---
first post on reddit. thought it was a description not a title loll
---
What if you added a warning window that pops up when you enable the plugin that says something like: "This plugin doesn't detect with 100% accuracy if someone has attacked you, use it at your own risk"?
---
"Should we not prevent ourselves from not removing partnerships and adding them? If this question fails, we will add partnerships anyway"
---
Your 2.5m risk is primarily coming from the shield. So yes I would say you are in basic rag gear. Congrats on only seeing one in 10 or whatever, but I‚Äôll go off of the 100hrs+ I was there and what I seen and experienced. On another note, I would love to see the stats that show the average risk pvpers take in the wild minus their +1, I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôs less then 1m.
---
Mage is severely under powered in pvp. In pure dps vs dps barraging still loses to a bolt ragger, even when maging on range pray and ranging on range pray. It's even worse when you compare dps on pures. Ice barrage has a high cost, takes up up to three inventory spaces at most and has very low KO potential. Ice barrage is a non issue.
---
To placate PvPers? I mean thats what they normally do. A lot of the PvP updates they have done lately have been extremely minor (or mostly PvM updates, inside the wilderness) and not really significant updates for PvP at all. Like Larrans keys? Its mostly a PvM update that they tried to push as a PVP update.
---
Its just to show "hey we know youre there, heres a bone" which is kind of insulting but I guess its better than the near ZERO updates they did for like 2 years? If I had to guess, itd definitely be to just throw PvPers a bone. 
---
They couldnt actually nerf it any considerable amount, just look at how PvMers reacted with such a negligible nerf. People are acting like its going to be useless to tank with now when its going to be very nearly just as strong and still one of the single strongest items you can use to tank in PvP. How do you think people would have reacted if they actually made a NOTICEABLE nerf with it so that it actually wasnt OP? Because its for sure going to still be OP in singles without a doubt.
---
Can you see who would be targeted by an auto retaliate
---
I'm very glad i started reading them. So much humour it's brilliant
---
Every argument I see is "wahh their 40k gear wahhh". Most people wear mystic which in itself is $=120k+ for two items. Are you yourself forgetting you're legit tanking with ONE 6m item and a d'hide set worth 15k against someone risking approximately 450k-800k? I mean their plus one is worth triple yours and you're unskulled.
---
Fix your argument before dribbling shit man.
---
That's like have your attack option on hidden with auto retalite on with extra steps
---
I drive around 2000-2500 per month depending on work so over a year we're easily over 20k.
---
fuck that doggo petto reddit shit mate. you should only be allowed to kick them for hunter xp
---
I got the pet after 15hours of BA?  My wife got the pet When she was doing req for diary.
---
No pet rock wtf!?!?!
---
This exactly, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying over and over.
---
thanks!
---
Exactly. People want all the benefits but refuse to accept the added risks (which justify those benefits) which is a pretty childish mindset. 
---
The one point I would consider meeting such peoples opinions would be clues because as far as I'm aware wilderness steps don't increase the drop chance of a better reward or ensure less steps required which would be an obvious benefit to the trade-off of added risk. An easy enough change to implement...
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the point of an integrity change to make an correction for the long-term health of the game, despite potentially not being backed by a lot of players? Zulrah or void nerf would never pass, but I'm pretty sure were good updates
---
So it's not about how much a key aspect changes, but rather how important that this is fixed, that is, how big of an issue it is
---
I personally have 0 idea if the bulwark is op or not, so I'm not participating a lot in the discussion, but you're looking at the wrong argument
---
This time we don‚Äôt have mod Mat K. Say what you will about the guy, but he was easily one of the biggest reasons we don‚Äôt have mtx yet in osrs.
---
Jagex wins either way because if you buy bonds for a player you‚Äôre giving Jagex effectively $14/month for membership on that players behalf.
---
No you guys just don't know how to do it lol. It takes a certain mindset to participate in. Mostly the only pvmers and skillers that properly enjoy the wilderness are competent because they have also been pkers and understand how it works
---
That‚Äôs so sick
---
No, as they said in the poll it was supposed to be a pvm tank item, not pocket invulnerability in the wilderness, and even of the item itself is 5m, its obviously going to be one of +3 items people are going to bring which makes them risk 0 too???
---
thats half the fun why I love dmm
---
Im joking about the gmaul nerf.
---
Okay
---
You don't get it lol. Do you want pkers to have to team up vs one lone person who has no idea what they're doing since the bulwark is a shit item?I thought you guys HATED being teamed up on and would rather be hit by solo pkers? But when a solo pker hits you you cry the same way
---
Smh my head. This is terrible, now when i go into the wilderness i might actually get pk'd.
---
I want this type of can. Looks pretty cool to reuse.
---
My FBI guy is just like ‚Äùholy shit stop bankstanding"
---
Thank you
---
I mean the fact that you can easily outtank a team of 5 is pritty broken.
---
Maybe he wakes up thinking he rocks üóø
---
What‚Äôs the secret??!?!??!
---
I mean it really depends, but say you're doing black chins.  Getting frozen or tbed could result in a death, so every bit of mage def matters.  If you're at black chins you're getting frozen 0-2 times before you're gone if no tb.  DPS calculators don't really matter if you end up getting frozen, then AGS'd a 70+ and die over it.
---
I think your a little too invested in rargh and myself lad maybe get a hobby, the videos do incredibly well and get a great like ratio (98%) So maybe you need to take a look at yourself and wonder why you dont enjoy the videos rather than taking to the internet to put others down.
---
Your welcome to your opinion but you should probably just move on with your life rather than post questions on a fourm of youtubers you dont like...
---
They dont get it man.  
---
You PvP. I can tell. The 90 people that upvote retarded posts like these have about five minutes combined pvp experience
---
Panic? A natural human response to being put under sudden unexpected stress. Easy to miss a small detail when you're panicking.
---
Since when is the bulwark so loved? It should have never been added in the first place.
---
Wait wtf, you serious? There are folks that want to make raids afk? Hahaha then might as well expect the rewards to be nerfed to oblivion.
---
Is doing goodie bags against the rules (picking 1-28 for item)?
---
&gt; That's because 70% of the pkers that are left in the wild are people in clans.. the solo pkers stopped pking deep wild a long time ago
---
What if the PJ timer for allowing any secondary person to attack you was 20 secs? If they freeze and walk under you then you have plenty of time to even type out insults before logging out in front of their entire clan.
---
The people complaining have literally never attacked another player and have absolutely no idea what is good for the wilderness
---
on certain phones you can clone your apps, and even without it you could use a sandbox like Island.

You can do it brother!! I‚Äôm past all that and it was a journey of suicide and trial. On that black mask grind now.
---
I assume, in some fucked up logic, if they get muted immediately, they don't get reported as much, which means the auto-ban thing based on reports doesn't kick in?
---
I was born into a family of non-yeeters. Every morning before I went to school my father would say, "if I ever find out that you've hit that yeet, I'll thump ya."
---
"Yes, pa," I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing homework.
---
"Y'all hitting that yeet?" he would seeth.
---
"No, pa," I would answer.
---
"Good." He would then walk out the room and shout, "If I ever catch ya, it's a thumpin'."
---
It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin' that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake.
---
I would swallow my pride. "No thanks. I don't wanna catch a thumpin' from pa." As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet.
---
One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin' that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air.
---
I breathed in.
---
"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!"
---
My father burst from my closet. "I told you I'd thump ya if I ever caught you hittin' that yeet, nibba," he ejaculated. Then, he thumped me.
---
I haven't hit that yeet since.
---
Until today. This morning was my father's funeral. At the procession, my brother asked me to say a few words. I told him I only needed one.
---
With confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone.
---
"Yeet," I spake.
---
Suddenly, my father leapt from his hand-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest.
---
"Y'all hittin' that dirty fuckin' yeet at my funeral?" he ejaculated. He raised his hand to thump me.
---
"Not so fast, pa." I grabbed his hand. "Yaint thumpin' no mo'."
---
My father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle. "The student becomes the teacher," he said.
---
"The student becomes the yeetcher," I corrected him.
---

HOLY SHIT. Did no one else notice that last sentence?!! **Those are the "invisible" ghosts in Morytania that everyone keeps wondering about!** So they're not part of some big conspiracy, they're just unfinished assets that some jmod decided to throw in for the lulz.
---
No, the people who are purposely trying to skull trick people will suffer and literally no one else.  It's not like they were attacking some other chin hunter and he panicked.  Their own team logged in under him for the sole purpose of trying to deceive him.
---
Black dhide is used by the majority of pkers but we still mostly agree that is should be nerfed as it is too powerful for the price? I use black dhide and bulwark every day but I still think it should be nerfed. I am also on mobile but don‚Äôt see how that is relevant
---
To be honest I have friends that are excellent brids that wear salad robes because they just don't really need mystics and can run into multi without risking extra. They drop mystics brids all the time, i have as well. Salad robes were just an unhealthy addition to the game

Unless you have to tank an extra freeze from the mage defence nerf, then it's 5-6 extra food.
---
Switched over from rs3 a few months back, got bored of it finally. Anyways, I'm working on rfd currently, but idk what I should move on to after that. Been doing a good bit of slayer, but it not very motivating. Anyone got some ideas/options for big goals to focus on?
---
Whew. Thought you were talking about old school runescape, not old school old school runescape.

Keep in mind this followed shortly after pulling the poll for partnerships‚Äîif you don‚Äôt think the result of the partnership poll impacted the selling price on this acquisition you‚Äôre crazy. Not saying they aren‚Äôt going to push MTX or other means of monetization, because they likely will, just saying that it may indicate that the schedule for these changes could be pushed out a bit by the results.

gl getting cox pet without actively contributing to a raid. Olmlet's droprate is like 1/45m points, so let's say you leech every raid and get maybe 2k points, you'll need to leech 22500 raids
---
There's always fringe cases, just because someone is there doesn't mean you're obligated to attack them.
---
If I came across a person who clearly wanted to be attacked like that for whatever reason I'd be pretty suspicious and suspect something's up. I'd probably nope out of that too, it just looks too much like a lure.
---
Probably starts furry-posting.
---
That 60 million in net profit really does hurt little Jagex and their investors. This company should never have gone public.

I think gmaul would have failed, because it failed before and everyone ive spoken to it in bounty hunter seems pissed lol

pvmers most pathetic lot. Why can't i afk wildy bosses for 3m a hr :(
---
It's fitting because Paul Walker was literally dead in this scene.
---
Ranged is already op in f2p
---
Accuracy is included in these calcs. 5 minutes = 100 casts. +2% accuracy = 2 more magic hits landing. There's a good chance those +2 hits will be during the time the opponent is already frozen or immune from freezing, but even if we assume the worst case scenario for the defender, that's two extra freezes in 5 minutes.
---
In that case maybe the integrity change should be to change it from metal to something a little more practical.
---
?? They polled to remove or keep the construction pixel. This wasn‚Äôt ever about it being a significant/insignificant change, it‚Äôs a matter of consistency.

Can draconic visages, skeletal visages, and sigils be given a make-all option after being smithed the first time?
---
I must be getting trolled. You argue "it's OP" and "it's not going to do enough" at the same time. 
---
Cut the bullshit about "a pvper abusing this". Skulls are still skulls, there's nothing to abuse. You still have the exact same incentives as before. It won't change that dynamic one bit just because you can't confuse llIlIllI with his alt llIlIllII.  
---
Cut the bullshit about "this won't help them fight back" because this isn't about advantage, it's about letting a fight happen in the first place. If you're scared of something fighting back &amp; getting lucky, try farming.
---
Cut the bullshit about advantage, that's not the matter at hand. Take your convoluted ideas to your own thread, and save your perfectionist fallacy for another day. If the only downside to OP's suggestion is "more people will be fighting in the wildy", mission fucking accomplished
---
...r-really?

I can *actually* make 5,000,000gp quick enough to stop paying? I had the idea of saving up for a bond, then trying to just maintain it with more bonds, but I didn't think it'd work when I found out a bond is only 2 weeks.
---
I can **actually** make 5,000,000 with only ~2 hours of work? What's the big moneymaker tasks for members that allow this?

Can other players smash one another's gargoyles?

Wtf they're taking 10 bonuses off of 150 lmfao
---
You could just get 99 fm and never open the cases till your other stats are lvled up
---
The bulwark is beyond dumb in pvp, being able to go into the wilderness and reduce your risk of dying by a considerable amount and risk nothing in return goes against everything the wilderness is about. Something had to be changed about, and this is what they decided to go with. If you genuinely don't know why people are complaining about it, consider trying to find out instead of screeching like a retard.
---
And look at dhins selling 1m+ below asking price
---
Exactly. Either you get it or you don't.
---
of course you have to rake first, but you can compost before or after planting.
---
you can‚Äôt pay for herbs for flowers, but it *is* worth it to pay for trees at a low level.
---
don‚Äôt compost trees *if* you pay for them. 
---
always compost allotments, flowers, herbs, hops, seaweed regardless of if you paid for them because it affects yield.
---
always equip your magic secateurs when harvesting allotments, herbs, and hops as it increases yield.
---
You're wrong. Nobody Gmauls mains lmao it would never hit unless you're bridding and hit off prayer and on robes, in which case yeah you deserve to die. 
---
Gmaul is cancer and you only like it because you can 1 tick noobs for their entire bar and there's no way to react
---
Rake is needed if weedy
---
Seeds and compost any order, don't bother with payment

In RS2 I was 99 all combat stats, still no Fire Cape. The waves were too much of a slog, and redoing them wasn‚Äôt fun at all

Unpopular opinion:
---
One of the reasons I like OSRS is the possibility to lose it all - no other MMO (from my knowledge that is) has this feature. Adds an element of unpredictability into the game. I personally liked it more when your items would appear on the ground automatically if you died. Just my opinion though.
---
Yeah ...cause it's an integrity thing... Gmaul is toxic af
---
Yet when I'm in 100 plus mage bonus risking 3m plus, I have a 42 percent splash rate against black dhide alone. It is busted
---
Maybe we should make the person rely on tanking by playing well instead of just owning a shield that costs 2 hours worth of gold that you won't risk since you're not skulled
---
Lack of critical thinking and being unoriginal does the trick too so is that where your username comes from?
---
No need
---
Also literally exactly what was said when they were sold to fukong.
---
&gt;So in all honesty, even if you didn't bot you are stupid enough to get your account "stolen" which also tells me you probably don't have authenticator, bank-pin and 2fa on your e-mail.
---
Lol this game basically has no security even if you use the shit Jagex provides you, stop bashing.
---
What a child.
---
"slow down on your nested parens there, I'm getting confused"
---
I forgot about that one it definitely is
---
This fuckin sub is overrun by people with no self awareness who think they shouldn't be attacked in the wild. It's literally impossible to die in singles with a bulwark and black dhides if you have any reasonable amount of food on you. I've never pk'd a day in my life so I'm not even arguing from the pov of a pker, people who can't see beyond themselves are ruining this game imo.
---
and when you try and PK someone with bulwark you risk nothing... they can't fight back, thanks for walking into that :)
---
Another reason I quit the game, all those pvmer and other noobs complaining about wildy which might be the only fun part of the game. Happy to have quit last year, sad to watch a game I loved die a second time.
---
I can't install any programs on my work laptop and sit close to my colleagues, so mobile isn't an option either. What can I do to afk some nice mining xp?

Tbh I don‚Äôt think they should nerf it at all, but if that‚Äôs what the community wants ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Early OSRS was fucking neat before they added G. E

Question: ...are people usually mad at Jagex?

I thought they were of the more beloved game devs

Oof alright, thanks a lot!
---
&gt;Gmaul should be nerfed but not in this way. Make it so if you spec with one weapon there's a cool down before you can gmaul spec. 
---
Why wouldnt its value be nerfed when thats exactly what the problem is? The problem is how strong of a KO weapon it is for being basically dirt cheap, not necessarily the weapon itself. 
---
You can still use the maul exactly how its always been, you just cant do so while risking nothing which is exactly what balance is. You SHOULD risk something when you have the KO power that Gmaul does, having it worth 35k is what made it unbalanced.
---
&gt;It's not like pure gmaul is some massive unprecedented problem and even if it is there are numerous other methods to stack full hp with the same low risk so this doesn't fix that...
---
Lmao bro pures is EXACTLY where its most absurdly OP and broken, like what? There is pretty much no better KO weapon from 50-80 CB than the gmaul, its pretty much BY FAR the strongest. And since most of those accounts are 1 def, its VERY accurate. 
---
What other weapon can you go 30-35+ spec twice, then another 30+ whack for a total of 90+ damage? Let alone do that for only 35k? Even if youre like 70-75 CB 60 att pure, a maul gives MUCH more KO potential than just claws because your strength isnt high enough for the claws to be better. So maul is still even better than Claws in the lower level pure bracket.
---
Its less accurate when you get into Meds+Mains but its still VERY strong when paired with AGS/Claws and youre able to 1 tick stack like 115 damage. Claw&gt;maul is basically the only thing that can fairly reliably KO in main bridding as well. Youll very rarely ever kill another main with just a claw spec unless you get godly combo RNG and get him down to 60-70 HP first and then you need a huge claw spec.
---
you can safe spot every wildy boss except vetion in singles, and vetion you can safe spot 3 tiles from singles
---
DAE pkers make no money?????? Xd
---
Some people pk for fun, if you weren't aware.
---
Its not the easiest because its RNG dependent.  You can't tell if you're going to get AGS'd or darkbow'd, at the end of the day its luck on getting the right prayer in that scenario.
---
Tanking a single pker yes there is skill, but tanking a singles team? Very rng based.  Sure there's a small element of skill to it but at the end of the day you're still just guessing and eating/restoring in the correct order.
---
That being said if changing the shield's def styles gave more of a certain def bonus, thats something id love to see in-game.
---
If they keep their super stupid idea of making it always lost on death I‚Äôm just going to rush with it and spec tab. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense for it to be 5m to use but only drop 1m. That literally just turns it into a rusher weapon.
---
Already have a 60 attack pure so my gmauler will just be a novelty account for rushing.
---
If Jagex decides to have half a brain and make it protectable like EVERY OTHER ITEM IN THE GAME or degradable at a reasonable cost I will just go 31 prayer.
---
Honestly though their nerf idea really shows their lack of knowledge of PvP so I think by this time next year we‚Äôre all fucked and PvP will be totally dead anyways.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt expect so win a fight versus a pker if you are pvming. I don‚Äôt know why people expect to vastly increase in skill just because of an attack option. If you need the option to be toggled, you most likely don‚Äôt pk avidly and there is a greater chance the opponent will kill you. 
---
Yes there is the chance to anti the pker, but seeing as how a pvmer usually is low on food due to picking up loots and using supplies already, they don‚Äôt have the option to fight for long.
---
Wouldn't doubt it. That thing had like 600mg of caffeine and over 120g of sugar.
---
You don't need to choose one. You can attack people, just make sure to attack the right people. If you click the wrong person you fucked up, voila.
---
Just use a suffering pleb
---
Jagex is just surprisingly unprofessional. Like it hasn't changed since I was 12.. and I'm 27 now.
---
Then don't fight back. It is truly that easy to not get skulltricked
---
Nah, we‚Äôre kinda repulsed at what you do.... so much so that we always gotta our the new guy on duty to watch you.
---
Moonman's dad back for round 2

Same as long as he understands me and sticks to his side of the bed. Maybe we can even play crash team racing.

Cries in UIM
---
They're holding PVP updates as a hostage because they're pissed off at PKers for being inconvenienced.
---
PKers are a minority in the game. They barely have any say in the polls.
---
Lol bullshit, unless the guy with bulwark is a whale with no brews
---
I absolutely deserve the money i get for trickin a guy into skulling on me. I spent months building an alt acc to do just that.
---
But by all means, stale, linear, dimensionless PKing is the wave.
---
The thing is no one at Jagex had any idea how modern PvP works so their unpolled updates that ‚Äúpkers want‚Äù are just going to kill PvP even faster.
---
cmonBruh
---
This can is used for the 24oz. Normal cans are used for the standard 16oz.
---
How is that cheating? We're arguing non polled vs polled, all rs2 changes were non polled so its pretty fair to use them, no?
---
Yeah I think around 10-15% would be more fair, and maybe the ether threshold can be increased to 1500-2000 for the pvp bonus
---
I think a great way to nerf BP actually would to lower the drop rates/amounts on Zulrah scales.  Make the BP more expensive to use so it doesn‚Äôt become the meta for everything while nerfing Zulrah farming for an instanced boss with low barriers to entry/no punishment for death
---
yeah i don't get how you can be mad about dying and losing 250k when 200k of that is literally because of the weapon you are using. Use a blowpipe and youre risking 50k
---
I am from Belgium where the healthcare is pretty good and I've been to some of the best ear doctors in the country and none of the provided with a working solution, because there is none, it's pointless to stress over it you just have to live with it, that's all there is to it...
---
Almost every PE firm is known for aggressive business growth. It's the nature of the industry to buy assets, grow them, and flip them to someone else when it no longer becomes efficient to grow them anymore. Like saying I buy groceries at a supermarket known for stocking vegetables or do my dry cleaning at a place known for having clothes hangers...
---
If you're taking multiple items to aid you in pking, you should risk those items, as it is the wilderness. Giving someone a 3 "good item" handicap because they have a game option enabled is a shit mechanic.
---
Literally says 3 Years Ago twice in the screenshot
---
That's tough luck, the original wilderness was always unsafe, and it should be kept like that.  This update would be nothing but a fuck you to pkers and old players.
---
Hopefully you will draw questions from this thread next week!
---
Lmfao cry harder dude ahahahahahahaha
---
Nerf imp boxes and I'll sit there for 20 minutes shit talking you and pointing out how you can't kill someone in d hides LOL
---
And they're there because there are too many bosses in the wilderness. They also have pet drops.  So someone bossing for money and pets are there as targets when they shouldn't have been there in the first place
---
The bigger issue I've had with the change is that it was unpolled, and the gmaul one (while in support of it getting a nerf) failed a poll.  This sets a dangerous precedent IMO
---
The sections I quoted were subjective statements, "but it is the wilderness after all" is an objective statement. Not sure how the last bit contributes to your opinion.
---
is melee or range at cerberus better? Bludgeon vs BP that is
---
Can't wait to get back in and RWT more eh?
---
I'm not opposed to a player being tanky, I am opposed to one item making them tanky. The shield will still be amazing for what it's used for.
---
As for the whole "it's a rare reward from raids, but has no value" argument, there is a very obvious solution: push for new tanking content. Stop using this as a reason to ignore proper balancing. 
---
There have been suggestions of new bosses that prevent the player from dealing damage, but takes heavy damage in phases of the fight. Mechanics like this would be absolutely perfect for what this shield was made for.
---
I still remember how close it was for option to skip Underground pass passing, funny enough thing that only affected ironmen got 10% less yes votes, *I am glad players are considerate of keeping integrity of ironman mode*
---
What if the prayer draining passive effect rose to 50%? This would increase the probability of smite in pvp situations.
---
Thats how it is now. Anyone with an AGS had a 70%+ chance to take out a bulwark if a freeze catches. We all know nobody pks by themselves so have 1 person with high mage offense catch the freeze, and have the AGSer pj.
---
Besides, fair isnt wildy, if all pvmers had to worry about was 1 pker you could remove bulwark for all i care and ill just tank with tsotd and granite shield.
---
U sound booty bothered
---
As a veteran? If you were around when wilderness and free trade were removed in favor of the BH crater and think it amazing then you are a small minority of the player base who in vast numbers voted to return the wilderness and free trade.
---
Well private servers have been on the rise and it's mostly pkers leaving the game
---
Questing sucks.
---
I would like to see 3rd age in my clue chest but you don't see me asking to increase drop chance now do you.
---
Make your own money u pussy
---
Yes, and much of the wilderness content is balanced around 'risk vs reward.' This update would be mitigating the risk, while keeping the reward part. 
---
It is just another example of casual Reddit hive mind supporting a flawed idea
---
This post is not catering to PvP at all, what are you talking about? If this post was catering to PvP, then OP would have suggested to remove skull tricking by making you skulled upon entering the wilderness (long stretch I get that) or to have a pj timer like in a PvP world. This update is only pertaining to pvmers who are worried about being skulled because they want to fight back with little to no risk. The wilderness is a dangerous place, the more updates that make it easy to survive, the less active the wilderness gets. 
---
So about your post, this is not beneficial to PvP in the slightest.
---
Yeah I will defend the bulwark nerf all day but only because it's just not well designed so I think it shouldn't be so strong. I think it being designed more like protection prayers is more interactive and has room for skill improvement. I would be ok with it being stronger than it currently is, if it was challenging to use properly
---
This game is not iron Man focused.
---
nOt aLl SKulL triCKs haPpen tHaT wAy.

---
You clearly were trying to offer a counter point to my comment, but now you‚Äôre saying that there is no relation between our two comments.
---
Nice. :D Thanks! I have more to it though: I'd like for the attack styles screen to be better split out into defensive styles *and* offensive styles. First of all, the whole concept of weapons being locked into certain exp styles needs to go. It makes no damn sense. I can swing a whip aggressively if I damn well want to. I should be able to block with a bludgeon too, I mean have you seen how frickin big that thing is? So, there should be an offensive choice between: accurate, aggressive, and controlled for **all** weapons. Secondly, defensive styles should be a new setting. Currently, all we have is auto-retaliate being on or off... but I'd like to expand on that a bit more: Much like offense can be focused on swinging accurately, hard, or controlled(ly?), defense should also be focusable to either only dodging (agility exp), tanking hits and reducing their damage (defense exp), or a combination of both (controlled exp for both defense and agility), which works exactly how it currently does.
---
There are many more details to my craziness of course, but I'll just stop it here. ...I've thought about making my own lil' GentleTractor-esque suggestion post in the past, but it'd be a waste of time, since it would never happen because it's too much of an... evolution... of combat, if you will.
---
Anyway, I enjoyed this discussion, Mister Beef. Glad we were able to keep it civil. ^_^
---
It is a new meme template
---
Microtransactions.
---
&gt; The "testing the waters / slippery slope" argument. If people get used to these promotions maybe they'll open up to worse crap later on.
---
so this is a valid argument now?
---
back in my day this was called the (slippery slope **fallacy**)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope] because its really just a hollow argument..
---
Not at all, the beast was tearing it's way from the spirit realm into Runescape. It's actually one of the favorite quest series out of them all. 
---
Everything that you do in the corporeal realm, is opposite in the spirit realm so by killing the Beast in the spirit realm it comes into existence.
---
To be honest it wasn't the mtx that killed rs3 for me, it was Eoc
---
No when u die it‚Äôs gone and turns into 1m on the floor
---
Not true at all lol, look at runelocus and tell me private servers have been on the rise again.  Totally the contrary.  You are speaking out your ass to back up your point.  Pkers aren't leaving in any noticeable number.  If the wilderness is ever safe, there should be absolutely no content to do in it, no wilderness bosses, no clues, no green dragons, no nothing.
---
I hated the free trade removal. 
---
I didn't mind the volcano. It just helped me find people to fight much easier because it concentrated the pking player base in one area. If I want to PK above level 4 wildy sometimes it takes me an hour to find someone
---
Generally the meta is either bludgeon or tbow, so I don't think bp would be great
---
I'll double check later on the dps calculator and will reply again
---
no one cares and no one cares
---
The special attack actually is useful. It is really good at aggroing a bunch of monsters to burst or barrage.
---
Omg I love you and him
---
What's sandstorm?
---
No, it's just wildy content is gay. Pking isn't fun and pkers and majority toxic faggots.

Maybe they should nerf msb 1 ticking and not the the spec weapon it self. Its kinda hilarious how a lvl 50 1k gp bow outdps literally any pvp weapon.

There is a way, you get the other persons loot lol. There used to be a time when you would gear up and walk around in the wilderness until you found someone to fight, and they were looking for you too. But all of these skilling methods shoved out there created this issue. Its stupid but working as intended.
---
It‚Äôs broken in singles. I have a good success rate killing anyone at chins or altar who doesn‚Äôt have a bulwark. With a bulwark my tent whip defender bring i hit constant 0s off prayer and it‚Äôs just a waste of time
---
Grats ur braindead
---
What is your ingame name my friend
---
If it is a war of attrition, like you just said, the pvmer would lose every single time. They don‚Äôt have enough supplies to outlast a pker, granted they use supplies when slaying or doing wilderness activities and picking up loot. People think that skull tricking happens in every single PvP instance, and it sounds like OP happened to get skull tricked because he wasn‚Äôt paying attention. 
---
If you are unsure of who had attacked you, then why would you fight back? There shouldn‚Äôt be a mechanic that allows a player to know exactly who has attacked them at all times. If you truly want to fight back, simply go to options and change your attack options to left click. They made it easily toggleable for a reason, and people want to change it to be so simplified.
---
full mystics? Yeah I wonder why a TIER 40 mage robe doesn't catch freezes on an END-GAME tanking item. Huh, who knew.
---
Because they have low Magic defense you don't need magic str bonus so ahrims is not recommended. Use melee tank armour and magic accuracy items
---
thats what I thought, you all bark no bite.  Thank god for integrity changes!
---
because old fashioned pking is dead. i will gladly admit that i have a pure whose express purpose is to make quick and easy money off people who don't know how to play around the wilderness. people complain about skillers and pvmers risking nothing while they also risk chump change and try to kill people with bulwarks. they just waste their time and then complain that people who spent 8m are unkillable against their sub 200k pk setup. it's ridiculous
---
single and solo is not the same thing kid
---
For the long term health of the game, putting such a high cost always lost on death to the gmaul is not good for the health of the game. Many low level secondary accounts will be abandoned thus less memberships for jagex, and 1m every time someone is killed is a pretty sizeable amount of gold to be spawned in game.
---
Yeah, I also thought they were buffing it at first, the wording was really bad.
---
Nerf is good tho, maybe not enough tbh.
---
Of course it's not in your best interest, you're the one profiting off the back of easy to kill chin catchers. They could just as easily go get "99 range for free" by catching red chins.
---
ok, so I do honestly enjoy cat and mouse games in this - I think instead rs should just make being ‚Äúprey‚Äù more entertaining. But I also agree that ‚Äúfighting over resources‚Äù is indeed the ideal state, better than cat and mouse. However I still think it‚Äôs good to have both. 
---
Part of what makes the wilderness unique to me is the temptation of value struck against the fear of risk, turned up unlike any ‚Äúdangerous pvm‚Äù due to the dynamic Unpredictability of pvp.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what systems would go into it, but I think it‚Äôd be good if it was in some way reasonable to have someone ‚Äúhire‚Äù a guard when accessing high value nodes in the wildly
---
I‚Äôm a pker who pks in salad robes + my entire cc ?
---
Farming expansion to raise livestock which yields more/better meat the higher lvl you are
---
Guess what I get from Tears of Guthix, damn Herblore xp and I'm glad for it. I boosted what I could to get Quest cape and honestly even Mining was much more fun than Herblore.  
---
When I think about it, I hate it more than any other useless money sink skills because you have to bank too much. Not only is each batch done 14 vials at a time, but you usually do it twice to finally get that pieces of shit expensive and useless potions.
---
Lmao that‚Äôll either make Wildy empty af, or every person in it will be only risking like 50k max, so killing flesh crawlers will become more profitable than that
---
The pvmers who are complaining are all terrible players to.  Idk why we let new players vote.
---
they've... always had barbacoa at chipotle?
---
probably none of the above i guess you felt concerned at if others use a brain to make points if jagex actually sees it and realises they make more sense it would be a big concern for people like you. even had to check my posts with all that concern
---
Nah don't you see Jagex are shutting the servers down tomorrow cause we said no to swamp man house
---
I'm going to take a leap and say you aren't actually a "spade hunter"
---
How is it overpowered? it‚Äôs a tank shield that prohibits you from attacking back. If i use one it better serve its purpose well because that‚Äôs all it can do
---
And they say you can't beat a dead horse back to life
---
Yeah 100%. Love getting a trident + tent each task.
---
We love (most of) the folks who work on Old School. But Jagex as a company sucks. Usually when we're bitching about something, it's decisions that are out of the Old School team's hands. For example, account security is dogshit, but that's a Jagex thing, not an Old School thing. The dude designing new quests has zero ability to fix account security.
---
Beyond that, even though we love the Old School team, this is a massive game with 10+ years worth of development, and everything is insanely interconnected. Developers will never know their product as well as their users do. That's why the polling system is so great. Sometimes Jagex is literally too stupid to function and tries to poll the dumbest shit imaginable, and we have to shoot it down. Sometimes at first glance they sound like good ideas, but if you play the game enough you know it would destroy part of the game. For example, they polled making clue scrolls stackable, since players can feel like it's a chore to stop what they're doing to do clue scrolls. The result would be clue scroll item prices tank since people can do them much more efficiently, and that 5 minute chore turns into a 20 minute chore because you let your clue scrolls stack up in the bank.
---
Exactly. It has been baby proofed. No punishment for pvm death, wildly ditch, attack options, etc.
---
If you think this is toxic, then don't play other games, because you might cry.
---
Or just design it so that PvP is expected and unavoidable, and skilling/PvM is designed as something to pass the time between PvP encounters.  As it stands right now though, PvM/skilling is the focus point and PvP is designed to be a "but while being harassed" modifier to it.
---
Instead of giving PvMers incentive to go to the wilderness, give PvPers incentive to fight each other with plenty of side stuff to do between fights.  Maybe make skilling areas "King of the Hill" style, so whoever holds the hill is the only one who can access the training.  Suddenly it's worth it to bring better gear and you're skilling as well as fighting others.  There's tons of ideas floating around, but for some reason, we're still stuck with 2001 era PvP ideas in the game.
---
&gt;They should lower the stats in the wilderness
---
&gt;It's useless outside of the wilderness
---
:I
---
lol gay pvmers
---
No bro that one's gone too, it's on meatspin.com now
---
Yeah right. Their main arguments boil down to "the wilderness isn't supposed to be fair" while hiding behind abusable mechanics that all but eliminate risk for the attackers
---
outside of his insults he's right tho
---
My fault for not clarifying, that part was mostly to answer his question about what barrows armor to wear. I was focusing on the magic bonus. Good call though, guys.
---
In addition to what the other guy said, the drop location of the mark isn‚Äôt considered floor, but a surface, so it has greatly extended despawn time (5 minutes I believe.)
---
Pay for them. It's cheap and guarantees that they don't die
---
So Jagex should just break the gamemodes they brought out? Veteran players pay for membership too and I'm sure that at least in cumulative hours played per week ironmanmode is the more popular mode.
---
trump 2020
---
We are fucked.
---
making it more expensive will not stop it being really good, for example people will use it at hydra because it's going break even when compared to something else. They need to find a way to reduce the dps,like the new spider boss is weak to range stuff like that
---
You've used interpunction and I still can't make sense of what you said.
---
that must be it never happens.  
---
also, anyone know what anecdotal means?
---
Quests
---
Should we really cater to it?
---
This entire post is just a used tissue of people who fell for a trick.  Some of the most entitled shit I've read on here.
---
Were we all not noobs at one point? Is that not a fun part of the game?
---
As someone who's been skull tricked and lost upwards of 100m, i get it, it sucks, at face value.
---
But I learned some cool shit, that I could NOT have learned on the wiki. And it was a REAL sense of adventure. 
---
Then I took that actual knowledge, and utilized it. Instead of grinding endless logs and fish, or clicking laps, I played the game.
---
Good
---
They didn't though.
---
They recognized their argument is a logical fallacy.
---
then they cited anecdotal experience of a path to mass-MTX that a separate team went down
---
and then they used that anecdotal experience to deem a literal logical fallacy, logical. 
---
what about that is a logical argument
---
I never even did stats, picked mechanics because I was doing physics as well and they tied together a bit better
---
The sandstone grinder! You can put sandstone in it and it converts it to sand for a bucket and 50 gp ea.
---
Yikes, that's rough haha. I'll definitely keep that in mind!
---
youre trash if it takes for 120 hours to go from 92-99
---
Mage prays
---
you can't poll balance updates the community as a whole don't know shit about that stuff
---
Way out of my budget for something that is gonna be replaced later anyways
---
Amen
---
By god youve done it! You figured it out!!
---
I also vote to re-enable it anytime a change is added, forcing people to acknowledge the change before entrance.
---
The issue is that I don‚Äôt have the money for it
---
I love doing wildy slayer. I‚Äôve done about 200 tasks there and am sitting with about 5k points because it‚Äôs so easy to farm. 
---
I‚Äôve probably been attacked by pk‚Äôers about 200+ times while on tasks and have died I think a total of 15 times while doing wildy slayer.
---
I risk about 300-700k in gear + drops so I know what I‚Äôm in for if a Pk‚Äôer comes my way. 
---
I‚Äôd say out of the 15 times I‚Äôve been killed, 14 of those times the pk‚Äôers is a shit head and says ‚Äúsit‚Äù, ‚Äúgf‚Äù, ‚Äúcya‚Äù, ‚Äúthanks‚Äù, or some other shit to put you over the edge.
---
I‚Äôm not going to fight back because I‚Äôm not going to fall for one of the guys trying to skull trick me. I‚Äôm not in PvP gear so your chance of killing me in a straight battle is skewed in your favor.
---
TLDR: Don‚Äôt act like a dick and that you are a god of a pk‚Äôer when you kill a pvm‚Äôer risking 50-300k when they have no intentions on fighting back. If you want to razz someone when you kill them do it on a real PvP fight and not a Player vs Slayer Killer.
---
I‚Äôm confident if you removed the toxic stuff pker‚Äôs say after they kill a pvm‚Äôer people would be less opposed to buffing PvP content. I could care less about being killed in the wild. The risk makes it fun, and the chance of escape is thrilling, but those end-fight words tilt me, and the pk‚Äôers do it just for that. So people vote no to PvP updates to spite them.
---
I remember my 12509540th trip, the trip that finally got me to level 50 rc.
---
\&gt; Panic like everyone in reddit  
---
\&gt; Buy bulwarks at low price  
---
\&gt; People realize item is still busted and there is no replacements  
---
\&gt; Sell bulwarks at normal price
---
\&gt; ??
---
\&gt; Profit
---
It is viable which is why so many ppl grind out pets and ironmen grind out drops.
---
Kills the pking
---
That's half the pk community. Killing pvmers and skillers in the wildy. Which is fair because it's the wildy but it's still lame af.
---
Probably some people on twitter, they get a lot of feedback there.
---
Max your prayer bonus and armor bonus, tank guthans
---
He is still trying for the inferno cape.
---
Pet isn‚Äôt that rare but getting a hard clue, elite clue, and pet in the same kill is insane.
---
dds spec the uwu doggo pupper back to lummy. see ya later rufus
---
lets be serious, bots are running rings around jagex now, the main youtubers making pk videos just killing a massive amount of bot farms.  And thats only in the wilderness. This problem is much bigger than people think and will lead to the eco crashing.
---
\&gt;_&lt; 
---
 An UwU has been identified! That makes 2007 UwUs in the last 16 days! 
---
 ^(Blep. Blop. I am a bot!)
---
There are more subs to 2007scape than there are active players if that tells you anything
---
Well yeah it will still be really good, but right now it feels like it‚Äôs meta for almost everything.  It‚Äôs not bad that it‚Äôs useful, but would take it away from lower level stuff
---
what the fuck
---
What's what?
---
Do you condense potions? The worst bit about Herblore is you have to touch 85% of what you make twice for absolutely no XP at all, and you have to make more to compensate. 
---
But super combats are the best gp/xp for the skill otherwise I would just make extended anti-fires the whole time.
---
Too much time on 4chan and you too can have yourself an FBI guy.
---
&gt; Also it depends where you tank from. If they get relatively consistent refreezes you can get down to zammy mage (you don't need to go down to 1 wildy like you said). I watched Abyss' stream when he pk'd in max at black chins daily quite some time ago, and he definitely still had people teleporting in single digit wildy after getting fulled (they're usually the ones with more to lose as well).
---
Well thats the problem, anyone in a decent dinhs setup its pretty hard to get anything close to consistent refreezes even in close to max. I mean you can still hit on just black dhide+Dinhs but its still more tanky than it SHOULD be against max. If someone is in something more like my Dinhs setup which is 160-180 mage def then even max has ZERO chance of landing consistent refreezes on it, theyll be lucky to splash less than 3 or 4 times in a row.
---
&gt; Lastly, getting fulled has got nothing to do with "knowing how to tank" most of the time. Protection prayers don't affect accuracy, so if the scim hits, it hits, and if the TB hits, it hits. Gear and Augury reduces the chance of it happening, but it can still happen quite easily and skill as a tank plays a relatively minor part.
---
Yeah I mean its true to an extent but being ready for the scim or TB and knowing when its going to come is skill. Good teams will do something barrage &gt; claw spec then hesitate 2nd claw spec and try to TB you there so that a scim isnt needed. But im talking more about just the skill it takes to tank period, MOST of the time people who are good at tanking can avoid getting scimmed and fulled. 
---
I think the problem is that Dinhs and a decent setup is so strong that it doesnt matter if they dont know what theyre doing (unless theyre getting hit by a good team who know what theyre doing) tanking. They can camp a single pray in their setup and just get down to 30 and tele. I mean you can be in really good gear and catch almost every refreeze from 35&gt;30 wildy and hit someone off pray every single hit and theres a pretty good chance they live unless you get insane RNG. Thats the part thats broken, where it acts like such a strong crutch. Its basically as close as you can get to TSOTD+Ely setup.
---
I disagree with the skulling idea, but people would still bring plus ones.
---
So jagex is pushing for pvmer hunting for you scrub wannabe pkers who can‚Äôt handle someone fighting back, as opposed to real pvp. Sure
---
I'm pretty sure Sacred Eels are more profitable whereas Infernal are faster fishing XP.
---
Omg ü§≠ i feel like such a loser for that now
---
Pretty good idea, we could even sneak MTX in there to double dip.  We can sell them this subscription at a premium that they can sell to other players
---
i always thought you had to do it before until a few months ago. i also learned after 99 that you don‚Äôt need to water anything if you pay for it lol
---
Trained to base 70 combat on chickens because I was scared of taking damage
---
Winter CC is an excellent choice. 
---
Friendly, and knowledgeable players.
---
so you like making pk‚Äôing harder?
---
What do you mean by "bond secondary accounts"?
---
Is there any way at all to train mining afk at the expense of some XP rates? I‚Äôm looking for something I could ideally only have to check every couple minutes
---
Kind of useless? It raised mining xp rates by 5% lol
---
Very good point, perhaps you could scale up the benefit zulrah scales give to trident/serp helm so they require less scales over time compared to the present.  This may be a roundabout way of doing things though, a direct BP nerf may just better serve the end goal
---
1 dollar 11 times
---
Most of that time is gathering funds to pay for herbs and other mats... I usually afk infernal eels or catch red Chins to compensate.
---
Lmao people like you do nothing but make me laugh anytime you bring up Jed. You guys act amazed Jagez didnt come right on out and say "Hey Reddit we totally hear you saying that this guy is stealing. We found some sketchy proof on him, but we have to look more into it!" They addressed how literally any reasonable company would have. Absolutely moronic to expect some flat out answers when they were trying to investigate it themselves.
---
As for all the old updates that ruin RS2, that was ten years ago! They know that killed the game, they aren't idiots. It amazes me this is even mentioned when this team clearly knows if they made changes even close to that, that's the end of their careers on OSRS. 
---
Please do yourself a favor, and remove the tinfoil hat
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt it? I heard your ‚Äúmetal door shouldn‚Äôt have mage def‚Äù but it‚Äôs RuneScape doesn‚Äôt have to follow logic 100% if the time.
---
I mean not that I want MTX but FFXIV does both and seems to be doing okay for itself
---
I honestly don't know what went through your head posting this
---
The wild is pretty dead outside rev caves, most pkers are in bh worlds or pvp worlds lol
---
Bring snakeskin boots instead of pegs
---
Not sure who that is either. Streamer?
---
I know mylife212 in game. Why dont you crawl back into the hole where you came.
---
Beating your girlfriend is now a bannable offence. Consider it an integrity change
---
Pvpers complain about it* But they can go fuck themselves.
---
of course the pker has a greater chance, that's why they're forced to skull, but you do have a chance. If you rely on autoretaliate it's impossible to win because if they simply run away you won't be able to hit them
---
obviously people don't expect to win the majority of the fights but "lol just autoretaliate" is stupid
---
More than just that though too, if you sit lower hp and keep a locator orb on you to hurt yourself it's super difficult to get smited. They can only smite 125% of your hp in prayer, so you sit lower hp and keep your prayer high. You also keep accept aid off so they can't cast heal other on you. You can also take off your bracelet so revs hit You, reducing your hp that they can hit with smite.
---
Its look is absolutely amazing üòÑ I agree!
---
Oh I found them good always.
---
Thank you.
---
Fought the caged dragon under hero guild to make money.
---
ITT people who fear for the state of attacking undergeared opponents in an impromptu threesome
---
[but really, can you imagine a world where PKers only attacked other PKers?](https://youtu.be/uG3uea-Hvy4?t=12)
---
Doesnt change the fact dinhs is still insanely strong vs ancestrals
---
translation
---
"We don't want to address the pvp stuff that came about in the last 24hrs".
---
You do have no idea. As do the other people crying about this.
---
there's varying degrees of how hard it is to get skull tricked
---
I'm not sure if it's fixed yet but there used to be a way to skulltrick someone with autoretaliate by attacking them when some timer would expire, which would make them skull if they were to attack you
---
The ultimate circlejerk
---
ü§Ø
---
So it has been deemed too good at what it does, so has had its stats tweaked. This happens in basically every online game I've ever played, to keep the game balanced. I really don't see the problem.
---
Luring/Scamming/Skull tricking are all part of the game in an MMO. It's one of my favorite parts of EVE. It's on you to not fall for clever uses of in-game mechanics. If you're ever scammed more than once in a game like RS then the fault is on you. Fool em once, fool me twice sort of thing. 
---
There are some instances in which there are legit bugs being abused to scam/lure, but even in those instances you usually need to drop all your valuables or go into a dangerous area. 
---
All it takes to not get skull tricked is to be cautious and careful when attacking someone that's attacking you. Check to see if their name is different, or double check to see if they're not cleverly disguised as an NPC or lever (never forget the legend)
---
All that being said, however, I would still be in favor of the suggested option of "hidden unless under attack by" option.
---
Why are you mad?
---
No, I'm pretty sure I want that actually. Skill gaps are exciting and something we need to embrace in PvP, not dismiss as boring rofl. Teaming in singles requires anything but skill. A bunch of sweaty virgins with anime avatars on their discord channel that spam hashtags like they're gang signs after tagging in and out on a solo player is just downright pathetic.
---
I just wanna do my clues without someone trying to kill me for a damn spade, shark, and energy pots...
---
Found the guy who didn't pass statistics 101
---
Why do you like 64 over TTYD? TTYD is usually the favourite in the Paper Mario series.
---
Ew. Wtf.
---
you risk d hide dont act like your risking.  Also don't act like 100% of pkers risk salad robes, I only use mystic and im 45 def so I cant use ahrims.  Should I pk in 200m risk for ur 100k loot?
---
Nah why limit myself?
---
34 hours? What was the kc?
---
So then whats the concern?
---
3400 dry. And I thought i was dry. D:
---
If they're in the wildy then yes... Every single player should be prey. Ever heard of high risk high reward? Those who are prepared to risk, should be rewarded.
---
[h]
---
I mean, best resources being in the wilderness is pretty old-school. Where else could you find runite? Also, HCIM and UIM can always get 3rd age pickaxe instead of dragon pickaxe. But I do get your point about wanting reward for no risk. A lot of newer players also want high reward for no risk.
---
PvMers almost never risk more than PvPers. In order to actually net kills pkers usually need to bring 3 combat styles of gear exceeding mystics in order to properly get kills on someone with brews/black dhide. I cant think of a single instance I've ever been in the wilderness and the PKer has risked less than his target.
---
You rite they should delete it, along with the pvpers.
---
He represents the community as a content creator so him being a terrible person makes us all look shitty and drives potential new players away.
---
Also I doubt someone who beats his girlfriend is a pillar of respect and decency to players in-game. They probably would just have to briefly glance at his chat logs or behaviour in-game to find a reason lmao. 
---
Also Runescape accounts aren‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs property and Jagex has the right to take them away for any reason they see fit. People have already been banned for being shitheads IRL to other players in the past.
---
PvMers are typically risking a lot more skulled than pkers. Even getting skull tricked once can cost you 10 or 20m or even more. Plus a lot of people are risking gear they can‚Äôt afford to use (for me even a blowpipe)and so don‚Äôt even risk fighting back
---
Hence the, say what you will about the guy. I agree with your points, but he certainly did help keep mtx out of osrs. Bonds are an evil I think we could all agree were necessary for the continued success and growth of the game.
---
If you roll 2 die and try to get snake eyes what is the chance? 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 same thing here.
---
but then there's no risk in attacking people, which goes against the entire point
---
The defender's benefit is that he gets three item slots that are protected without prayer, the attacker's benefit is that he gets to pick the fights and that he is prepared for them.
---
The combat triangle. That is one thing that is a good concept of runescape and certain things sway too far from it. Items that are strong in all three styles should be much less impactful slots, like staff of the dead is basically a kodai/Dragon scimitar, that's too much imo. Imagine if it had range too lol. Things like climbing boots are a good hybrid option, but significantly lower impact than the bulwark. In order to make the bulwark good it should be challenging to use and not a good defense option vs magic.
---
I would rather play ffxiv than this for 15.
---
teams would be useful as well
---
3rd age pickaxe exists btw. Not dropped by a wildy boss btw.
---
Although this post is a joke, the gear in the picture above should be more accurate freezing someone in black dhide who is risking even less
---
lucky man Alfred
---
Don't want to be skull tricked? Attack options - off. Done. How simple was that? This sub reddit supports worrying ideas
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this site, but my cursory glance at their politics board is 90% alt-right talking points, such as actual Trump defense or migrant fearmongering. Even an anti-antifa post as the top post. Downvoted homie up there was correct and it took two seconds to figure out.
---
I guess you guys dont like dark humor
---
I never bring +1 even if I plan to pvm in singles, there's honestly no point
---
Don't take this sub to heart. It's just a lot of bitching and complaining by no life jaded players.

I‚Äôve been in theoslounge for about a month now and it‚Äôs great

only megaman and yoshi can complete inferno, mario isn't cute enough

So for actual in-game content, Andrew Gower barely made anything? Funny, lol.
---
If you dont want to go into a PvP enabled area to finish your clue and accept the risk that comes along with it, drop the clue and move on.
---
You better believe it
---
This is my favourite smash meme
---
Not only the bronze scim, the woman in that building would give you 2gp if you talked to her ;)
---
Its supposed to be the lifecycle of the wild, pvmers doing stuff in the wild, shitty pkers trying to kill said pvmers most of the time wearing shitty cheap gear, better geared better skilled pkers killing those etc. Having activities for nonpkers in the wild does bring people and pkers into the wilderness, how annoying that might be for pvmers its the truth
---
Except very few people kill exclusively clue hunters or PVMers. It's complete spectator bias: because you always die to PKers while not PKing yourself, you assume that they only kill other people like you. It's solipsistic and not even close to the reality. If you're PKing, you have no reason to not use those 2 barrages and 5 bolts to kill a dude and make sure he has nothing.
---
When people are sure you actually have nothing, you get left alone. Check how many singles PKers stand outside Rev Caves. They'll nearly never attack a Rev Killer without a wilderness weapon because they know they'll only get a Rev bracelet at best.
---
I like the idea of completing the drop tables.
---
I always loved grinding for gear and I think that‚Äôs a cool aspect of RS that is overlooked.
---
Any melee armor will work even for using magic as the barrows brothers have 0 magic defense. Personally I use torags and a neitznot helm but proselyte is a good cheap option that helps with prayer bonus.
---
Teaks are the fastest xp and good for construction. They can be banked easily on fossil island, doubly so if you have 70 agility.
---
&gt; If you are against anything with the word partnerships then you are damaging to both the game and the community.
---
If you are for partnerships then you are damaging to both the game and the community.
---
Yeah it's definitely in their best interest to keep the players happy because we are their source of income. But OP still needs to chill out and stop acting like we own the place, because we don't.
---
To my knowledge it is 5 bonds for 3 months on ONE account.
---
In light of the circumstances of the screenshot the only variable here is 2. So it would only be 3,000 x 3,000.
---
Homie the combat triangle is the exact issue with Black D'hide. I don't think I should have to explain to you why armor that costs 15k should give you T70 offensive bonuses and more than respectable defensive bonuses.

Mage gear is expensive and gives a small numerical amount of bonuses.  Even T40 mage gear costs 120k.  Good melee weapons and armor are both expensive.  Then you have ranged, where double dhide and a crossbow costs 25k.  I hope you can see where the imbalance in the combat triangle lies.  Saying " Perhaps you should choose a target who isn't wearing range armor if you want better accuracy," just shows plain ignorance because literally every target in the wild who knows what they are doing brings Black D'Hide because of how absurdly busted it is for its price.
---
Don't you have one too?
---
I dont kill clue hunters because I think I'm good, I kill clue hunters because I've gotten mills worth of teleport scrolls, rewards, cash stacks, you name it from killing them over the years. Never assume that someone doesn't have anything on them in the wilderness, everyone is fair game.
---
Nearly everything is abusable in some manner or another.
---
As it stands there is very little solo pking, because even with 2 people in single combat the chance of you killing either of them if they have half a brain is slim. They will trade you back and forth while you are helpless to do anything about it, anytime you cause one to need to eat twice they will trade off.
---
 &amp;nbsp;
---
The wilderness is half single, all I would ask is that single pking in the single portion of the wilderness is not at an insurmountable disadvantage vs 2 people. You shoulden't be able to TB and send 10 sets of specs into one person in singles.
---
No youre an asshole for pushing him off a cliff instead of simply reporting him
---
Your post pretty much sums up the entirety of this year, there's been a big fuck up nearly every month.
---
BP with dragon darts is the fastest Cerberus method, although not very cost efficient. Id honestly just use a bludgeon or a hasta+defender/spectral. Or both if you have the cash.
---
\&gt; Im okay thanks. 
---
Then I guess it doesn't bother you.  Not sure why you're telling me to stop if it feels good :&gt;)
---
Would love to claim I was a pker, but being honest I know too little about the game mechanics; too scared of loosing my stuff in the wilderness and finally too uncoordinated to be able to gear switch..
---
Or pk‚Äôers toward pvm‚Äôers ü§î
---
Dude, I am flaming the fuck out of anyone if I see they MTX'd. I don't give a fuck if they're 6 years old and I don't give a fuck if this is "just a game why hef be mad."
---
I find your ignorance quite disappointing.
---
What?
---
You can‚Äôt even get to the boss with 10 range and magic you 4head
---
Zammy brews are also great for this as well, Lowers your up and gives prayer so you die faster while keeping prayer up
---
Bro you can‚Äôt even use a comma or correct punctuation, so I don‚Äôt think Jagex are going to be looking to you to solve their problems.
---
Mcdonalds are in need of workers though, so that is possibly a problem you could solve..
---
Yeah wasn‚Äôt too well received unfortunately. That‚Äôs ok I deserved it
---
Probably a bit of both. They weren't released that far from each other. As well, that post was talking about something that had occurred 10 years prior. Try to remember a series of events that happened 10 years ago in your life, there will probably be some inconsistencies from how it actually happened.
---
When the game forces me into the wilderness and I get killed yeah I'm pissed. They should really remove the wilderness clue steps. You literally dont even get any loot you're just killing me to be an asshole.
---
pretty coincidental indeed.
---
Black chins, chaos altar, all content in the wilderness?
---
Haha yeah, I'm good with regular fishing, want to be able to afk while fishing mostly
---
jagex would have to admit rsgp has real world value and if they do that then they can potentially get into some legal shit on rs3
---
You only lose the 50m if you fuck up. If you are good and play well you remain at 0 risk. So if your complaint is "I am bad and that has repercussions" then yeah, sure.
---
I play all parts of the game and it's insane how pvmers and skillers spite vote just because they don't/can't pk.
---
? I don't have that issue . Theirs an option in the in game settings whichever " screen" in settings is on the right is what I use
---
Nah my way does a better job of combating the problem while still keeping gmaul pures alive and not completely dumpstering the weapon for pures. With this fix you can still dds gmaul which stacks out max hp in a tick, so they aren't even accomplishing the goal in every bracket. Cba with changes to 126 PvP world bridding destroying an entire bracket of pures unnecessarily due to jagex just not bothering to think about it
---
I love that I've become FBI Guy this week.
---
i doubt the majority of the people who are complaining today about not being able to fight back have ever been skull tricked. Not to mention no one would use a skull trick prevention mechanic to fight back, they would just use it to be even more safe in the wild, where its already super easy to tank and get away in singles if you come prepared to do it whatsoever.
---
Hard to change habits, 99 herb was a choice I made while I was working on 99 RC, along with farming. I knew herb would be tough.
---
Because tanking 70% of the hits while praying wrong prayer n being afk in the brain is good game design ye
---
If you pk long enough it's easy to tell who's baiting, and 44s it's pretty hard to die unless it's a big team, which is the most active spot. As it's always said, don't risk what you're not willing to lose. I think extending the pj timer can be detrimental in terms of getting a box too.
---
It's definitely not as you claim "impossible" to get a kill in single.
---
Reddit PvMer gets DESTROYED and SKULLFUCKED by FACTS and LOGIC
---
idk why people get mad when they cant hit on the best defensive gear in the game with 40k in gear.
---
Didn't realise you knew every PKer in the game
---
If The guy is using 6m in gear then you should too. The fact he's not risking anything because he doesn‚Äôt want to fight makes no diff. If you have to risk mills with no chance to get good loot its because you aren‚Äôt interested in fighting actual pvp players.
---
Better yet, unlimited lumbridge tele that takes you straight to the general store
---
\&gt; You keep trying to put words in my mouth. Find where I said I was in support of the prayer buff. 
---
" Why are you pointing out some other integrity change that you subjectively don't like, and then trying to claim I'm making fallacious comparisons? "
---
You consider the prayer buff to be "some other integrity change" that I'm just whining about?  Feck off.
---
\&gt; And again, it's not an integrity change because it ONLY doesn't pass a poll 
---
Then stop using that as an argument.  Your original post had no defense of the change itself, just examples of actual integrity changes, no actual explanation of why you think this is one of them.
---
\&gt; What constitutes an integrity change for you then? 
---
"Holy shit the markets are crashing"  "Holy shit this is behaving as severely unintended"  "Holy shit a spot of content is literally inaccessible" "Holy shit a gamebreaking glitch"  "Holy shit this item/moneymaking method is far superior to any other item/moneymaking method it's not even close (i.e. 10 m/h at Zulrah)"
---
"Holy shit some pkers are triggered about this door doing what it's meant to do" doesn't have the same ring now does it.
---
Feel free to blame Jagex all you want for encouraging people who have no interest in PvP to go into the Wilderness, just don't be surprised when it's the community that includes Spade Killers who suffer as a result.
---
There is no alternative to Clue Scrolls that's not in the Wilderness, it's a mistake to not give players an alternative.
---
Sure, Jagex has given PKers the means to be assholes to non-PKers, that doesn't mean non-PKers wont dislike PKers for using the opportunity to increase their spade collections.
---
&gt; That notion comes from you stepping into the wilderness
---
Can you honestly not understand that some/many people enter the Wilderness and would enjoy themselves more if they never even saw another player?
---
-----
---
Lets not get off topic though, I was replying to someone suggesting that an item that currently works a specific way that is largely used by non-PKers be changed to forces people that don't want to engage in PvP at all to engage in more PvP.
---
Seriously though, since this isn't even being polled and is being defended by PKers I'm just going to go back to voting no against everything PKers seem to want with all my accounts. For the record, I've not personally died in the Wilderness for years, lol.
---
Do you think a -10 will change that?
---
Staff of the dead and ely offer higher stats then din, should those get nerf‚Äôd as well so you can kill someone for their bones?
---
Fucking time wasting troll. Hope you enjoy pretending to be female when you're just some useless incel.
---
&gt; have to check every couple minutes 
---
No, sorry.
---
Motherlode Mine is nowhere near minutes of afk, guys. It's the most chill mining that we've got, but you need to keep an eye on it for it to be even remotely reasonable.
---
The main reason we always kill all players we see is because of dmm and the pker hatred in the community sooooo
---
Years of outrage and pent up sexual frustration will do that to you.
---
Why is Pulse watching me
---
They will learn from those experiences just as we did when we were young and dumb. Regarding mental handicaps you can't seriously expect to work the game around a mental handicap never mind expect them to know to change attack options either.
---
Can my spare, identified fossils be used in the same way as unidentified fossils?
---
If no, what do I do with them? I have a lot spare
---
make it cost 10m to revert it to what it is now and you've got yourself qol change my friend
---
Currently using team viewer app to afk 20 mins at NMZ on my home pc. Crushin it
---
Thanks for the advice, I'll probably do that. Luckily I've made a few friends from prayer training so I'll PM them to borrow their house for teleports.
---
Other than interacting with other people? Probably not. That‚Äôs not terribly relevant to the cultural problem though.
---
If he convinces jiggleflex to make some healthy pvp adjustments whilst he's at it, I might too
---
Any1 with Varrock med has unlimited Ge teleports lol
---
Crazy how far these guys are going to DEFEND skull tricking. Like come on.
---
What's his prize?
---
I don't really have a problem with the skulltricking based on lack of attention to detail like camoing on the lever or chilling as an NPC in the arena. Legitimate strategy that takes advantage of not noticing the differences in options. I just don't like trying to tell the difference in similar letters on two players and taking a 50/50 shot at getting skulled. Seems pretty underhanded to me.
---
We should also add ‚Äúvoting no to all wilderness updates are welcomed‚Äù
---
Pvm brainlet logic xD
---
Pking at the 50 att bracket in bh is ridiculously uninviting. People monkey step and will one tick you for 90+ dmg with crossbow to maul very easily. Hp levels are low at that level. And 95% of pkers use maul. It's stale and frustrating for new players. Fights last 10 seconds. That's not a good way to get people to enjoy PvP. dds has much more counterplay and isn't nearly as frustrating. Even claws too. Neither are instant like the maul.
---
As far as I can tell that is unknown. For the changes they'll be "forcing" in they most likely will not say a date as to avoid people merching on it.
---
no cuz ely is like 600m not 5m. also sotd spec is only 1 min and u can get raped by bolts and barrages, with bullwark u cant
---
m a t h e m a t i c a l
---
its not about baiting, literally everyone just has 2 or 3 friends waiting in the wings to pj you off if you get even close to killing their friend. I didn't say its impossible to get a kill in single, i said its impossible to even find a 1v1 (obviously slight hyperbole) because no one actually solo pks anymore, which makes it an arms race of who has more friends waiting to log
---
I figured honestly, why I sold off some of my bank for an SGS since I kept hearing and reading it was an important item for grinding slayer and tbh it really has been. Made grinding out slayer tasks a lot smoother so I'll take y'alls advice again and level out construction then.
---
I just started playing OSRS and I have received just under a mil from two drop parties.
---
You're right... nerf Range.
---
then stop the complaints about being attacked and killed lmao, you cannot please pvmers.
---
You're in the wilderness killing our money ghosts and risking 500k+? We're gonna go for you. Having 1 item which is an instant 1 click "no die" option is dumb and negates all skill in tanking in pvp situations, not our fault PVM'ers can't learn to tank. Make the bulwark worthwhile with bonuses against monsters but also make it less OP in PVP is my opinion.
---
I know myself and a few friends would just abandon our 50 attack builds should the change go through as written in the blog.
---
MTX isn't good for the game in terms of player retention, i'd say if MTX were to be introduced less than 20% of the game's population were to use it, at a guess.
---
Yeah regarding the gold spawn i suppose i should have clarified it's a lot more in alchs though generally people buy bh teleport scrolls for more profit to sell.
---
Can this thread be sorted by new by default instead?
---
Old news
---
Meh. Rollbacks are common in a lot of online games with economies nowadays. The misstep there was waiting too long to do it.
---
It‚Äôs less about being offended and more the toxicity of the culture. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs some sense of sportsmanship about it and that‚Äôs not exactly banter - they‚Äôre just being dicks.
---
Jesus Christ. You literally need at least 15 people perfectly coordinated together to mace a main, and at least 10 for a pure. Even then, it only works about half the time.
---
You are not entitled to bringing a +1 into multi, and never have been.
---
-decent gear
---
-mystics
---
Definetly agree that they should remove skull tricking, simple reason is they already outclass the pvmers who looted stuff aren't geared for a 1v1 vs a pvper and skulltricking on top of it? shows how off it is. I don't mind fighting back i can stand my ground but with all the skull tricking going around i just dont try to fight back and run away.
---
True, once I saw a corporal beast guide using a POH for regens I've had the itch to spend most of my bank on construction. Just hard to sell off some gear for skills. I gotta do my PvM for some cash then.
---
i tried with bp many times, didnt have tank so i got dfs + r cbow, so much easier when you can tank healers and some of those waves where mage + range attacks. bp is over hyped if you do jad for first time.
---
A good example to understand the way client side plugins work is the arceus library plugin. It doesn‚Äôt know where the books are until you interact with a bookcase and then the server sends the location of all the books to the client which then displays them on screen. 
---
There‚Äôs no possible way to display this information before the server sends it to to the client. Skulling likely works the same way. I could be wrong but this would be my guess.
---
1v1 then
---
Motherlode is seconds of afk, not minutes. Maybe like 15-20 seconds on upper level, less on lower. Minutes, not an option.
---
The specific KC doesn‚Äôt matter here and you shouldn‚Äôt be considering it in your calculation because the outcome of a specific event occurring does not rely on previous events. If you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre going to get b2b pets in your next 2 kills the probability of that event occurring is 1/9M irrespective of your current KC.
---
fuck this is me
---
I also suggested stupid shit to add in the game and submitted a lot of garbage child-drawn fan art then got sad that they never featured it.
---
haha yea
---
theres no better gear :)
---
Thanks for the info!
---
exactly. This is literally all I can think today. Everyone is so used to it costing basically nothing to die, that if they die and actually lose something, even if its through a mistake of their own, its a huge problem to them and should be changed..
---
&gt;No pvmer has anything to gain by fighting back
---
If you kill the guy you can take their stuff. Pretty straightforward.
---
The feeling is mutual.
---
Can confirm. While availability/spectator bias is strong and I've fallen for it with pkers at times. The truth is plenty of pkers kill pkers. Yesterday I was doing prayer at the chaos alter and I got jumped by two pkers. A few seconds later those pkers got jumped by other pkers and I was saved. 
---
It's annoying to be killed when not wanting to fight...but that's the way it goes. There is a difficult balance to find however.
---
Mario is already on 200 KC and still hasn't received the mighty Koopa Shell.
---
Ngl, kind of looks like Pulse from R6S
---
1.6k kc missing 2 items btw
---
So you don‚Äôt use fixed mode then? That‚Äôs where my issue lies.
---
It was never polled in the first place smartass.
---
I would make sure to log out in a bank every time I was done playing. For safety.
---
Haha yes, but mate you realize there are public maxed houses that anyone can use right? It‚Äôs on the designated world 301 - house party world. You go to rimmington and there are like 30 players spamming their house name so you can join and use their house for free. There are hundreds of players using these houses, it‚Äôs nice to tip the owners but never required.
---
It'll be tough if it's your first time but you should be able to get through it.
---
I was going to, but I wanted to watch him squirm.
---
Great idea, now the blur will be even more noticeable.
---
Did that guy just shit himself*
---
I have never been skull tricked in my life and I spend probably 70% of my time in the wildy pking/pvming/chin hunting.
---
okay so lets say you get into a hundred fights and you get skull tricked once
---
that still makes it not worth it
---
even if it's once in a thousand fights, it's still not worth it
---
One thing is that if nobody killed clue hunters all you would have to do is wear no gear to remove any risk from wilderness activities. Like could you imagine if you were sitting 9n a fat stack of black chins and nobody would attack you just because you said "Enjoy the shovel"
---
Yoshimitsu?
---
My stepdad plays it on a lot easier.
---
you don‚Äôt even meet all the stat requirements for the quest, so obviously not
---
Shit person.
---
?????????????????
---
Tell me
---
Yeah, I agree. Resources is a hundred percent fine in wildy. :) That's getting yourself a step ahead by risking more!
---
Well, it's not that I don't want risk, but I want a path that's more calculated than running from 1, 5 or 100 PvPers. If I need an item to make my gameplay more enjoyable I get it.
---
The changes to the melee defense is almost negligible, but the -10 change to magic defense (18 to 8) is a 60% nerf. The shield is almost exclusively used to combat pkers using low tier mage equipment in the wildy so this is a large nerf to it.
---
REMOVE THE FUCKING CLUE STEP WILL DO

I meant combat stats...
---
"spelled what wro... oh shit!"
---
Are sacred eels more or less afk than infernal eels?

I always do it watching something on another screen. I agree with your sentiment. I mix it in with other stuff I do, say 20-30 laps at a time. I can't stand it if I have to do it for days straight.

I did it at canifis. Make sure you have bolts to fletch or things to high alch.

How do you ask barb fishing? You gotta spam click to drop your fish every minute or so
---
Reading over your post history, you seem to be projecting.
---
What‚Äôs useless about either of them
---
Jagex has made changes to increase the risk for PvMers, such as BIS items like the Craw's bow automatically leaving 200K for PvMers and items like the rev bracelet always leaving 40k. This more than offsets the cheapness of the black d'hide. There isn't an analogue for salad robes though. It's just cheap and that's all there is to it.
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
Who tf has a Portal Nexus built that hasn't already done Varrock medium?
---
I never suggested don't pvm in the wilderness. I said pvm with gear that allows you to fight back. You are free to elect not to, but you can't then come on reddit and complain that you are being killed by a bunch of noobs in salad robes. There is readily available counterplay and you are consciously choosing to ignore it and then bitch about dying.
---
Most wildy pvm is either range or melee, with a few mage ones. You could bring a MSB or Dscim with maybe 1 other switch, replace some of the sharks with karambwans and boom you‚Äôre ready to fight back.
---
\*hypocrite\* Okay, Thanks.
---
I legit just started abyss crafting again, and haven't seen a single person trying to pk there, but that Pic is hilarious. The point in killing everyone you see in the wilderness is because of situations like that, you never know how lucky you're about to get.
---
Also pkers keep the wilderness what the wilderness is. Really feels like we are coming full circle to the free-trade and wilderness removal updates
---
LMAO imagine getting owned by a door
---
Then why are you getting so butthurt at the idea of it being against the spirit of the game? Probably because you know it‚Äôs right.
---
Just because Jagex hasn‚Äôt done something about it yet doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt against the spirit of the game.
---
If it‚Äôs the wilderness why don‚Äôt you go fight against other players trying to PK? Oh right, because you don‚Äôt want to actually risk anything in ‚Äòthe wilderness child‚Äô.
---
Power mining iron in alkharid. And then at 60 you can go to the mining guild to continue power mining iron with an invisible +7 mining level boost with an available bank/deposit box for your ore.
---
All I asked for was a reduced drop table on current PvM pure gear in order to make it a bit more expensive and increase the risk. I didn't suggest making people show up in Armadyl.
---
&gt;asking people who do not want risk to leave the wilderness

Keep saying whatever you want.  I have a 1900+ total level account with a tbow and now almost a scythe.  I have 4 other pvm accounts with bank on em too.  I've seen more people try to learn to pk for skull tricking because if successful it is fast cash.  Overall that helps other pvpers because most pvp occurs at certain wilderness spots.  These new pvpers then get attacked by others.  "There's always a bigger fish?"  Overall though you just sound like a whiny bitch.
---
Being a hypocrite is what I'm accusing you of, yes.  I see that kink of yours is back though.
---
That's not how maths works
---
I played all 3. SPM was good but not as great as PM64 or TTYD

---
&gt;It's free, but it's a completely different activity than what I set out to do.
---
So? If it's free then fuck it, bring both. No downside. Unless you're just fiending for inventory spaces because the *28 extra spaces* provided by the looting bag aren't enough for you. 
---
&gt;You're acting like all I do with my account and time is write about this.
---
I know it isn't all you do, but you have almost definitely spent more time doing this than actually trying to get better to solve your problem (which you have probably spent exactly 0 time doing, be honest)
---
That applies to every ~~gaming~~ sub, bunch of toxic fools lmao
---
FTFY
---
I pk on a main in mystics, ags, dhide, etc.... Anything goes in the wilderness has always been in the spirit of the game.  The only people that are butthurt are ones that keep spamming my replies like yourself.

People got all up in arms when they said it was going to be instanced because of the recent stance about wanting more non-instanced bosses. However, people didn‚Äôt actually think about what this boss is meant to be before slamming their keyboards with, ‚ÄúTHERE‚ÄôS TOO MANY INSTANCED BOSSES!!!!‚Äù 
---
It doesn‚Äôt  make sense for this boss to be non-instanced. This boss was meant for mid level players, so they could learn and practice common boss mechanics of prayer switching. But with it being non-instanced, mid level players have pretty much no chance at drops once some maxed combat player shows up and starts smacking it.
---
People still get hacked with Authenticator apparently. And Dinh got nerfed
---
If you don‚Äôt fight back they have it easy. If you do fight back, you run the risk of loosing your $$$ gear. They have advantage either way
---
Haha I know. I played Endgame on release date\*, and that series of boss battles were difficult at first! Furthermore, when Endgame first was released, it required Ritual of the Mahjarrat, meaning Endgame was quite literally the hardest and last quest. Unfortunately, that RotM requirement was removed, so that doesn't apply anymore. :( 
---
\*Btw I have MQC on Rs3 and I'm like level 65 cmb on OSRS. Lurk here for the memes!
---
This is just dumb, the whole meta and wildy scene has been created with the idea of 3 items kept unskulled. Remove that and the meta for all wildy bosses changes, the meta for revs changes, Rev weapons are now useless as mace clans will be EVERYWHERE too, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
---
Yup great idea, you should send it to jagex!!!!!!!
---
I would say try and catch the grind bug if you really want to get some worthwhile content out of this game. What I mean by that is that to many people this game can be boring af due to how long you may be doing one task over and over. But the good feeling comes from achieving whatever goal you've set.
---
I would recommend getting Graceful Outfit because that will help a lot with your Run Energy and then questing. You can find guides on "Most Useful Quests". I've played on and off since 2004 and I always hated questing. Just recently I really started to pursue quest after quest and not only is it super useful but much more enjoyable than I used to think.
---
Now you're just being contrarian. For 200 years, everyone in the US would have shared my opinion, and now we suddenly pretend Muslims are our friends. Brenton Tarrent dindu nuffin.
---
&gt; simple and lucrative
---
He never said simple or lucrative. He said it could happen .1% of the time. I probably wouldn't want to go out and spend weeks or months maybe earning 50M. However, it takes far less time to see 1000 PKers than it does to go out and PK a thousand people.
---
People only skull trick cause they lose all their gear and money in actual pvp content like bounty Hunter or pvp world's.
---
People only do this cause they are actually bad at pvp.
---
Right, and thats awesome, but it would breath some life into construction for it to offer a passive gold generation
---
Pay a Venezuelan to do it.

The one thing that the reddit osrs community has shown over and over is that it‚Äôs petty and loves to childishly overreact. I get so tired of this sub tbh
---
They don't want them to fight back they just want high loot and low risk. If they wanted a fight they wouldn't hunt skillers.

So you‚Äôre saying you get to protect 3 items and would rather go full defensive than actually fight back with 3 high tier items against there supposed ‚Äúsalad robes‚Äù? If they‚Äôre wearing such low gear bring a couple of items and it should be a piece of cake right?

I know for sure there are differences, some spots do move more often than others, even sometimes for the same fish.
---
Well that's one way to end a conversation I suppose.  I don't have anything to say so I'll just insult their intelligence.  Not everyone lives their lives just waiting to be tricked.  I can only imagine how lonely and mentally exhausting that would be.
---
Quit your job and scape full time
---
I saw that video in the school library.... lol
---
You can stack out someone with 95+ hp in a tick with dds gmaul. You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Looking at every single character of heigajeb184brjsi and making sure that doesn‚Äôt change takes time that you cant waste in high stakes pvp
---
People get hacked with auth if email is compromised and dihns has been nerfed by like 1% üòÇ
---
&gt;!my kink is talking to people who seek arguments in anything but commenting back with as little substance as possible!&lt;
---
okay, thanks
---
Anything goes except the Bulwark apparently.
---
Well there goes that lame duck argument out the window.
---
So why don‚Äôt you explain to me how it is in the spirit of the game to *trick* players into getting a skull just because they try to fight back against PKers? Since when has abusing game mechanics to *trick* players been in the spirit of the game? Scamming is essentially the same, and it has been against the rules pretty much forever.
---
So please, explain.
---
They‚Äôre decent for beginners, they show a lot of different methods and what you can expect from them. They‚Äôre just certainly not for experienced players or those looking for efficient skilling
---
make up some reason you need a linux system
---
&gt; It is one of many strategies that one may employ to use the wilderness to their advantage, and get items from players who enter the wilderness with them.
---
And that is contrary to the warning you see when you enter the wildy. Players in that situation don't intend to attack another player and would in fact prefer to avoid it, because they DO NOT WANT TO SKULL. So, I think it's at the very least misguided to act like skull TRICK-ing is an intended game mechanic and good for the wildy.
---
Because if your attitude is that "oh you might keep your items, or you might not", then you're going to have way fewer people actually going into the wildy, making it even worse and shittier than it already is.
---
Unintended manipulation of a game's limitations that is outside of the design principals of that space is NOT good game design.
---
This has been my favorite comment as it's totally something id bait with
---
I guess it‚Äôs more of the widespread multi areas which were designed for clans to battle each other and has now grown into a system a huge teams abusing mechanics and piling you for 10v1
---
At least I won‚Äôt get tricked barraging the stack though, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important here
---
Eternal sleep
---
I thought you could also hit those lines that come down from electrical poles with metal and get a similar effect!
---
Right, that's basically "don't fight back". You don't skull trick because you accidentally click someone, it's because you accidentally click *the wrong person*. Simple right click won't solve very many skull tricks of "attack with account "MageBankKill" then log into account "MageBankKil1"
---
Or the way RoT does many do their usernames. "attack with 'R000OOOT', then attack with "R000OO0OT'
---
Yikes
---
I can guarantee wildy activity will increase if you implement a simple warning before skulling, which can be turned off.
---
Maybe they‚Äôre downvoting due to the condescending tone of being told the core functions of the game as if they don‚Äôt know them?
---
&gt; Since when has abusing game mechanics to trick players been in the spirit of the game?
---
Game mechanics weren't abused. That's what you aren't understanding.  If it was an abuse in anyway people would be banned or jagex would make a statement. Someone has a similar name and the "pvmer" couldn't tell a difference.
---
Not worth the time to fight when you are trying to do something else.
---
It‚Äôs already bounced back a ton. Looks like we‚Äôre already behind the curve :p. Might sink a little lower before it settles out. Right now it‚Äôs not even crashed to 5% of its value which is ironic because that‚Äôs how much it‚Äôs actually getting nerfed
---
I've got an *old* ass desktop that runs RS pretty smoothly. But I find certain areas like Fossil Island just eat my framerate hard. Even on my friends beefier computers I find that there are areas that just make the game crawl.
---
Ironman is the only way to play xcom.
---
I liked it to
---
My view of the wilderness is just different from your own, and it should be possible to accept that without having to put me down. My points of it being better for pvpers but not enough for pvmers are not mutually exclusive. If you bring a gear setup with the intention of fighting back then you are an anti-pker not a pvmer, maybe my definition is different from your own and that caused confusion. I also don't think more or less people are going to be fighting in the wilderness with this update because the people not interested in pvp are going to be the same people, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. Thinking about it, anti-pking while doing wildy slayer sounds like it would be fun if I got to use 3 more items. This suggestion could help that at least.
---
Because he has a good point? Lmao what a stupid buzzword
---
I would start with all the easy ones, then medium and so forth. No specefic order is needed. Altho desert diary is near to useless untill hard diaries
---
You are correct in stating wildy is risk vs reward, however you have to consider who pker's risk is for. Are they really risking when fighting one player as a team or when it is team vs team? Also, most good rev pkers will bring an expensive +1, when fighting versus teams smites are very common. I'd say pkers in revs risk a lot more than Pvmers
---
But they never had to interact much with one another.  Putting bosses in the wildy just made things worse.
---
What do you expect from someone who bought the orange skin cosmetic?
---
Rs3bad
---
its weath, not wealth and regardless, the jmods dont care
---
I know I don't , but I'd like to do the bosses or mage arena withour worrying about some sweaty brainlet constantly messing with me. The biggest argument against PKing is that PvP worlds and to a much lesser extent the duel arena exist. If they genuinely wanted fair , two party compliance PvP theyd go there. But 90% of PKers just get spades and pure essence because they're dogshit at PvP and can't do it against real opponents.
---
What is the "spirit of the game"? I agree it does disproportionately affect new players, but that's just a matter of being, as you said, less informed. Once they're properly informed as to how common scams operate and get started, they should be well equipped to avoid them.
---
just answer the fucking question, ok?
---
&gt; why should pvp be any different?
---
It would not affect the game I'm any way..
---
And it's really easy to not get maced nowadays
---
Because pvmers felt entitled to the loot without the risk. That's not the way the wilderness works.
---
Yup. Maxed account on GW2. I haven't played it in ages, yet here I am, struggling to get 70 agility and loving it.
---
don't know but i kinda doubt it
---
You can hang one half off the edge of a table and let one link at a time ping down and it makes the noise too
---
Can I just stop to point out how impressive PvPers must be now a days? Because according to reddit, the retaliatory response to "fight back" is that you will get skull tricked. It's impressive that 100% of these pkers have alt accounts with similar names and cb levels, at all levels of the wilderness, against all players who are fighting back. That takes skill to be so omnipresent on so many different servers at times of day at once. Wow.
---
I guess all the times I fought back and either ran them off or killed them, I was just super lucky that they didn't have their handy dandy skull trick alt ready to skull me up.
---
This was talked about shortly after release by the main dev behind mobile but hasn‚Äôt been mentioned since sadly
---
No. Even if you remove mtx from rs3 (which you didn't)... I hate eoc, I hate the xp rates for half the skills, and the graphics just don't feel like RuneScape to me.
---
Because they think it's fun? Why do you play
---
Its not about high loot, I pk for fun. If I see you walking in the wild with nothing on, I'd kill for the fun of sending you back to wherever you came from.
---
&gt;They'll nearly never attack a Rev Killer without a wilderness weapon because they know they'll only get a Rev bracelet at best.
---
My first foray into going to rev caves has proven this false. Never been there before and finally decided to go check them out. I equip black dhide, dds, and an addy sqr shield just to explore. Didn't even have a rev bracelet. Step one foot inside and get slammed by a 120 with toxic staff of the dead. I think, maybe it was just a fluke, gear back up in the same welfare gear. I am actually able to walk around the caves this time for a minute or two before a clan rolls by and steam rolls everyone in the cave. 
---
0/10 I'll probably never bother with rev caves again. It's not that I hate the wildy either, I've been getting more and more into the wildy bosses and practicing my KOs on green drag bots and have gotten in a few 1v1 skirmishes too and I've been enjoying it all. Except for rev caves, fuck that place. It's a death sentence for any mid level running around alone.
---
Runescape has been tailored so that you don't lose anything ever. The thought of losing progress is simply too much for some of these virgins to bear.
---
I‚Äôm apart of the pure community, we use sharkbrew.com . If you check out the website you‚Äôll soon find any pure team/clan over the combat level of 70 REQUIRES you to be quested. 
---
Most pures are in a team or a clan. 
---
80% of all pure teams and clans are on sharkbrew, it‚Äôs a smaller more niche community and most of us don‚Äôt look at Reddit lol.
---
the chance of a specific b2b is 1/36 yes
---
Why though? It doesn't make your own personal achievement any less. Some schmuck has to pay like 300m (or whatever they're going for) to get theirs, while you can get yourself another whenever you want and don't have to rely on anyone else.
---
&gt;	objectively better MMOs like WoW or FFXIV. 
---
Stating a subjective opinion as objective really undermines the rest of your argument
---
people who fight back generally bring gear they don't mind skulling in.
---
Damn 1 itemer was attacking me whenever I posted it
---
Is there even a difference between those two names??? They actually look 100% identical and I can‚Äôt tell if you are joking or not.
---
if something is viable for both then it's the same... if something is viable for one and not the other (blowpipe) then it isn't.
---
Which is why we're seeing so many posts about PVMers complaining about PKers and vice versa.
---
This isn't real life though, it's a game. It's illegal to kill people in real life too but we can kill other players all across the world of runescape and commit genocide against guards on the regular. That's not a very sound argument IMO. Sure getting scammed isn't fun, but I find that it makes the world feel more organic and lively to have shady figures trying to pull the wool over you. And, again, if all they're doing is something as simple as asking you for your items or to drop your items, is it really their fault when you oblige?
---
That isn't even slightly the point, you can have 150 people with bulwark in the wildy if you want. Nice try though.
---
You are making the good choice
---
I agree that f2p tb is a good idea. Not sure if you can say with certainty that pvm‚Äôers just go out and vote no because they hate pk‚Äôers. I do think there is an imbalance of players so it makes a favorable vote more difficult for PvP related polls.
---
Out of the percentage of users who can vote, I wonder how many did vote, and how many of them have actively gone to, or plan to go to f2p to pk.
---
there's too many worlds so finding a person in your bracket sometimes is far and in between. I never kill rev hunters unless they're running down to chins, or most pvmers in general. We'd fight other pkers if 95% of them weren't baits lmao.
---
Very epic
---
So then it's a pvmer entitlement or mental issue.
---
yes you explained mechanics. but seeing as im not talking about mechanics and don't give a fuck about them in this convo i ignored it
---
Also needs to be a login attack timer, so they can‚Äôt just login under you and spec you out
---
Nah, I've read reddit dude. *Every* pker has an alt account at the same cb and name, in every world, on every server, at every time of the day, for each pvmer in the wild with intentions of fighting back.
---
Oh wow. Well if you didn't close your eyes you would have seen that I clearly stated that the too are obviously not comparable in any true sense. I'm not undercutting what rape is. I'll own up to the crude humor aspect of it, and I apologize for the poor taste, but if you know what sadism is you could understand that it's a quality of both pointless "grief" pking and people to who take pleasure in violating clearly helpless people.   
---
Remotely similar on how it makes the victim feel? Of course not and you would have been able to see that if you read it.
---
&gt;5m shield
---
&gt;expensive?
---
Read your own post lol
---
Go play rs3 then
---
You guys fr need to take your tin foil hats off. No MTX is coming to OSRS. If you realistically plan this out, what Devs would even take care of Old school OSRS if it were to be released? Especially how old the code is. I believe OSRS right now is going into the right path. The Mods actually listen to our community which not many game industries do, so id say our dev team does a nice job doing, plus everything is polled on what comes into the game so it‚Äôs fair.
---
Idk why divine keeps failing it's not that good
---
was out in rs2
---
Like someone else has already stated, there is 0 way of telling what someone has on them. People accidentally bring their cash stack into wildy, they accidentally bring a stack of law runes, they didnt bank their teleport scroll for the wildy clue because they were too lazy. 
---
If you are strolling wildy and actually have nothing on you it doesnt matter, the pker doesnt know that. If they left you alone just because you were naked, then all people would have to do is keep their gear in their inventory.
---
if you get too far the freeze is removed, so you should stand under them and log out instead.
---
I think they have the game's best intentions in mind and I trust their decisions most of the time but I have a lack of confidence in their abilities as devs given the restricted pool of talent from the job's pay grade and requirements.
---
from what i gathered you think dhides are the problem and not dinhs...
---
Lmao right. They aren‚Äôt skull tricking pvmers unless they‚Äôre in full Bandos and even then you‚Äôd have to be camping something and completely miss the white dots in the first place.
---
Picture posted by my buddy in Discord, not my kill.
---
It is good when they become informed on how to avoid scams. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that scamming shouldn‚Äôt be against the rules. I wonder how many new players quit the game outright because some jerk scammed them out of their full mithril.
---
Do you think scamming shouldn‚Äôt be against the rules?
---
No, you're right, I didn't get rid of most things, however I did get rid of the ability to buy your levels (assuming the cold turkey method, which I'd prefer, and legislation might require), and I also allowed the ability to purchase the cosmetics through regularly obtained currency, as opposed to locking it to only the MTX currency. Is it perfect? No, the best model would be to have none of it, but since RS3 is so far down the rabbit hole, I'm not sure there will ever come a time where MTX is truly gone. I do think, however, this is one of the best ways to reduce the level of MTX in the game.
---
nerfing dhide is both for pker vs pvmer and pker vs pker. The magic bonuses from that 15k spent is ridiculous AND you pvm bois with the shield you're not risking jackshit anyways, i've read a couple post about the nerf of the dinhs and i see a lot of people saying "just use ahrims and dont risk 100k" should you risk lets say 5mil in gear + a ags as plus one and get a fair fight against some dude with a 7mil shield that is protected no matter what while they can have a full inventory of manta rays or brews, while at the same time being a fuckin waterpool of splashes and running like usain bolt????
---
 BIS is always ancestral, in revs its smarter to bring xerican/mystics because of teams.
---
It does happen (maybe not a single person with an alt but teams try to skulltrick people as well) its weird to find someone who's looking for a fair fight, so why fight back and risk a skull of 6m+ when pkers are risking 400k?
---
I didn't say anything about the risk, its obvious its there but being in the wilderness doesnt mean you are actively looking to engage in a fight, thats why people choose equip the shield and run
---
that's fucking hillarious, took me a while to find it but it's a good one
---
[deleted]
---
Most pkers I know don't vote at all either because they feel it won't matter. Most don't use this sub but use discord and a large majority have used sharkbrew since rs2.  I doubt jagex has reached out.  Many p2p pures and some mains have 40 atk pure alts specifically for f2p pking especially if they are active in the clan scene.  IMO things like snare and tb should've been added from day 1.  It would've made f2p and p2p more popular bc of training methods.  In both game modes I've always kept a 40 atk account specifically for f2p clanning or edgeville pk.
---
nothing could tempt me to play rs3 again.
---
This post is from 2015, which is before the pedos migrated to ResetEra. Neogaf is much more tame and sensible now
---
Yeah I am mad that this obese white virgin who thinks it's impressive to have an MBA from some degree mill has his shitty videos with gimmicks stolen from Misc and memes about them spammed on this subreddit
---
the "i" is an "L" in jim
---
There's no need for it then.
---
Yeah maybe those wildy ones, but they‚Äôre shit bosses in general &amp; have no point doing anyway if you don‚Äôt safe spot. Believe it or not, those 3 wildy bosses arnt the only ones in the game!! There are other bosses too!!!!! And if you put it like that, every single boss in the game is simple as fuck, even raids. You tryna say pking requires more skill than cox or tob?
---
This.  Savescumming ruins games that have chance based mechanics. Accepting that your poor decisions got someone killed is part of the experience.
---
You give Jagex too much credit
---
Pulse?
---
Drop rate on the herblore pet pet?
---
Even in max gear you can't solo kill someone with a bulwark and a reasonable (7-9) amount of brews.
---
Yes
---
They are! But unfortunately they aren't being discussed atm so Dinh's it is.
---
I meant, if it was polled and passed, it wouldn't affect normal gameplay
---
do you skull-trick for fun?
---
Here‚Äôs my upvote!
---
Lmaooo
---
What is better for training attack and defense; whip or full obsidian with berserker necklace? Does the best option change between nmz and sand crabs?
---
so your community's hatred is more valid? look i can do it too: the only reason some pvmers hate pkers is because of the mentioned reasons (otherwise would be no reason to hate them at all).
---
I feel you man. I guess the answer to your question ultimately is no. This would not tempt me to play rs3.
---
Ive never skull tricked and mostly, 98% of the time, pk solo.
---
"i didn't see the dinosaurs myself, that means they dont exist. Also, the earth is flat."
---
money pouch and tool belt led up to the killing of the game along with eoc.  This is not a direction people want to start going.
---
$11 ain't that expensive.
---
No one would vote yes for it... everyone is dumb and not ok with anything rs3 related even though there‚Äôs a shit ton of things that are from rs3
---
Gotta blur for the memes tho
---
Skulltricking isn't that though. It forces you to not fight anywhere in the wildy. Idk all the mechanics and theres quite a few different tricks so why should I ever risk my +3s.
---
I think it'd be a lot more fun trying to escape while actually being able to freeze/damage back.
---
Take a look at this bud, straight from mod ash..

It should also take an item at random from your bank and deposit it directly into the pker's bank because pking is [very risky](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cazb61/bulwark_rework/etcooen/?context=3), you [know?](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cazb61/bulwark_rework/etcmg85/?context=3)
---
Catch anything?
---
Let‚Äôs go to the top.
---
True, magic accuracy bonuses of mage armor could use an increase across the board.
---
*Considering UNSKULLED, obby pures risk 350k* LOL
---
ikr? S'cute
---
Then don't
---
If you have prayer and 59 magic it‚Äôs easy just make sure you use sharks on the ice diamond
---
It's called the skull system bud.
---
I‚Äôm not a pvmer, I‚Äôm almost exclusively pvp at this point. I‚Äôm just tired of the fucking ragging. Everyone in deep wild risks &lt;50k. The bulwark increases the incentive for people to bring mid tier setups to get kills because you can‚Äôt kill someone who has it if your in rags. I don‚Äôt even own a bulwark. I don‚Äôt know how raggers overall risk could be higher, even if someone ran out in bulwark and black d hide, 20k setup vs 40k raggers setup doesn‚Äôt make any difference.
---
You‚Äôre just bitching because you can‚Äôt kill get kills on bulwark with your shitty rag setup. Simple solution, stop being a pussy, get out of those rags, gear up and you‚Äôll have no problem taking down someone with bulwark.
---
It's fun to try and get away. Way of the road... IT'S THE WILDY!
---
Got a life sentence when I shot a [person from minority religious group]
---
I can confirm, this is 100% accurate
---
Finished mine like last week, went a solid like 20-60 K/D but it was fun as fuck lmao
---
no to contractscape.
---
and just never have the chance to kill somebody with Dihns, yeah, problem solved.
---
The problem you're running into is that you're using logic and aren't trying to paint the subject in the best light for pkers.
---
So you are aware that the skull mechanic exists. And despite that, you still bring 3 items. And then if you get skulled, you lose 2 of the 3 instead of just losing nothing because you only brought a +1.
---
I agree that skull tricking isn't fair. But where's that bike meme where they put the stick in their own wheel when you need it?
---
Neither of those are even remotely related.
---
That‚Äôs a good point... do you think a reputation log showing k/d &amp; quits might help that?
---
Ya know another game I play has similar issues to this. Sea of thieves. Like the game or don‚Äôt but the community whines and complains about people attacking people with no loot or who don‚Äôt fight back. But for every story like that I‚Äôve also heard a story about somebody claiming they have nothing when they really have a bunch of loot. Nobody knows what you have until they kill you. You could be lying. Killing ‚Äúobvious clue hunters‚Äù that *chose* to take a risk entering a PVP area is just part of the game.
---
This was OC from someone months ago you thief
---
That's the thing though, none of you risk 100m. You cant afford to keep losing that on random accidental deaths, it just isn't practical.
---
Also try killing someone without dinhs, this is usually another pker. Or do you only want to fight bulwark users (pvmers and skillers)
---
The PvP community complained about A LOT of things, nerfing d hides mage defence, pj timers etc. 
---
Out of all the possible things they chose to address this is probably the worst one.
---
Not sure if sarcasm...
---
Are you fucking retarded use some reading skills they taught you back in 3rd grade
---
Zero
---
Why stop there? Just destroy everything in the players bank to act as a gold sink. And randomly teleport players to the ice plateau with no slash weapon or teleports.
---
You give up all attack bonuses to use it...
---
SOTD is 4m. Toxic reaches up to 10 but doesn‚Äôt gain any attack stat in doing so, so that isn‚Äôt a fair comparison. Let‚Äôs also not forget you can get an offhand, Dinh‚Äôs bulwark is two handed. So it‚Äôs better to split that 7m into a main and offhand. So let‚Äôs do a regular SOTD and then a malediction ward. That‚Äôs +29 magic attack and +15% magic damage. Dinh‚Äôs bulwark has +18 magic defense.
---
Pvpers who complain about this are just retarded. There is no imbalance in the offensive to defensive stats per gold. If a pvper paid for their weapon and offhand slot what that person is paying for their weapon and offhand slot, there wouldn‚Äôt be any mysterious ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù splashes. Ya the pker would risk their mainland and offhand while the other person doesn‚Äôt. Cause they are skulling. That‚Äôs the point of skulling. You risk more. If you want to fight in equal gear and have the same risk, you don‚Äôt go to the wilderness. You go to the duel arena.
---
A while ago I never imagined doing jad with a really scuffed setup an ironman might use. After beating it about 14 times on my main and getting my ironman to the point where I could I realized the gear ain't that important.
---
Based.
---
Because the AoT only has 10 STR bonus, and removing 100% of a stat isn't the same as removing 6% of one
---
Dinh‚Äôs Bulwark is unbelievably strong at Barbarian Assault in Leeches. So now instead of two niche uses it has one!
---
If it was genuinely OP, it wouldn‚Äôt be 6m
---
You got some source for your claim? Black d'hide chaps are traded about 11K times a day, Bulwark is traded 200 times on a good day
---
The fact that a single 6M item that's protected on death makes you nearly invincible against a skilled solo PKer in top tier gear is pretty busted. 
---
Even as someone who only solo PKs, I'm not too bothered about the defensive bonuses, but it the very least it would be nice if there actually was some risk to using the Dihn's - EG, make it work similar to reverent weapons where it needs to be charged with a minimum of 1,000 ether to work in PvP, and the ether is always lost on death.  Right now it's something that probably 80% of high level players bring to revenants by default because there's not reason not to.
---
If they dont fix it soon i might actually quit, this is an insult to us man...
---
You're making it seem like i'm required to fight back. I'm not. It's easier and less risky to just not. Hence why I bring 3 items, not 1.
---
Do you mean the pew pew?
---
It's an rs3 account now. Osrs isnt what you played
---
No because there's nothing wrong with it
---
With turael skipping takes about 30min tops.
---
Sounds like someone was stupid enough to get skull tricked
---
you're still going to lose your D bones tho l0l
---
Most of my wow guild (myself included) unsubbed because of BFA.
---
It was a trainwreck
---
And jagex does nothing
---
I mean, that's its original purpose, a gold sink. I guess it works as intended in some respects.
---
I saw that! &gt;:0
---
Yes that is a dumbed down explanation of how the actual damage calculations are done. You wouldn‚Äôt expect a full nuanced explanation of how the algorithm works in 140 characters. The wiki link gives a full explanation on that. That link also proves you can‚Äôt understand basics as ash says in the tweet 0 is inclusive in the roll and you‚Äôve tried saying attack stops you from hitting 0. You‚Äôve got no idea how the game works under the hood and thats fine but please stop saying things that are objectively false even when you‚Äôve been given a full breakdown on how the calculations are made.

There is no tickeating in pvp. It was completely removed. You literally have no idea what your talking about.
---
literally the point, barely anybody risks that much because it's not worth the risk - in return bulwark users are damn near immortal. A majority of the time PKers are looking for other PKers - but if they run into somebody with potential loot from PVM why would you just walk by?
---
Ey wtf bruh at least give me credit https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cb6qgn/remove_skull_tricking_if_you_want_pvmers_to/etebt2r/
---
Still disheartening to see loot like that get cheaper when you hit a unique.
---
Yeah dragon bolts are a decent max hit increase either way
---
They did
---
Tbh most of the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù on osrs are bots
---
This is an ‚Äúintegrity change‚Äù? Literally unplayable.
---
Just started playing this game yesterday and I'm wondering if it's possible to find out what stats a piece of gear gives without having to equip/de-equip and compare? And how do I know if a gearpiece a merchant sells is better than mine?
---
Thanks in advance!

Jagex: keeps putting pvm content in the wildy to give pkers players to kill

Pvmers: use gear from pvming to avoid dying

They do gain from it. Think of all the time they save by not working with the community to find the best solution to the problem. If it weren't for the time they'd have to put into coming up with better solutions, they would gladly work with the community to solve the problem.
---
One of the biggest integrity changes I've seen was the removal of wilderness. The Gower brothers have admitted that they should have worked with the community to find the best solution. They didn't, and they solved their rwt problem (not really) but also ruined a lot of their game in the process.
---
Years later, they openly discuss bonds with the community, how it will combat rwt, as well as provide them with more income. That was polled, the community was well informed and voted accordingly. Jagex solved the problem, the community was happy.
---
What I'm trying to say is that, if they have to force a solution the community doesn't agree with, it is likely not the best solution, and they should continue working on it until all parties are happy, or at least 75% satisfied...
---
I think that would be better. However, most people who quit on you will already have completed their torso, and prob will never come back till way later. (Most likely for lvl 5 in all.) which im pretty sure 90% of the game will either never do or just end up paying for it.
---
Yeah, it's it's just abuse of things that shouldn't exist.
---
Which is why gmaul is getting nerfed. And why they are the ones primarily screeching about it.
---
Found KempQ
---
I reckon it'd be easier for old questions to be buried and go unanswered. The red flair on questions without replies help me finding the ones that need help while I'm scrolling down, so it's never been much of a issue, personally
---
Why do you want the opposite order? Just not having to scroll through answered questions?
---
How are you so dumb that you not only fall for skull tricks but also think that they're to blame and not yourself
---
Came here to say that but then u said it
---
Or if you want to make it easier but less fun, just buff the hell out of the current PC monsters just like challenge mode COX and add Void recolors
---
&gt;  it's that the 1 time it does happen, you lose all your shit
---
I'm talking from the premise of when you do fight back and this scenario occurs. I'm saying that if you only ever bring a +1 because it's the smart thing to do, then this above scenario is *never* a possibility. 
---
People are so focused on max efficiency that they *have* to bring the best 3 items to speed up their activities. In *the only dangerous area of the game* it's ok to forgo efficiency for safety.
---
People who use it most likely won't attack anyways.
---
Obsidian and then the obsidian sword
---
Dumb question- does asking Turael for an easier task reset your streak? I assume it does, but I've only ever used him for point boosting so I'm not sure.
---
I mean the pew pew
---
The game not spelling out something for you does not mean it is not part of the game. You are well within your rights to create two accounts with similar names to skull trick, multilogging isn't against the rules anymore.
---
And, again, the foundation of your argument is a literal game-breaking bug which I'm not talking about at all. Your falador massacre analogy is a non-starter.
---
They can add it as part of a mini game, like phoenix pet. Closest thing to a "buyable skill getting a pet" we have right now.
---
Yes, and you can't attack with bulwark. I'd say that's a pretty fair trade.
---
Tick eating doesn't work in pvp.
---
Ironmen are the perfect customers. Ironmen don't bot, don't inflate the global economy, don't scam other players, and some of them produce highly entertaining content ~~in a swamp.~~
---
85 I‚Äôd say, then train attack then def up after
---
Slayer is the new everything. Its too bad its the content people want because everything else gets left behind. We need to make skilling great again
---
The effort of getting charges is more than buying thread for 1gp each. Make it unlimited and this has 100% support.
---
Pkers need to wear better armour instead of a 50k set up if they want to kill someone using the best defensive shield in the game.
---
Nope, I just know bullshit when I see it. Nice try, though.
---
I've literally never gotten skull tricked, lured, or any other nonsense. I've been pk'd 4 times since I started back on osrs over 2 years ago. Once was while I was doing a clue. I lost nothing because I only had 4 items. The other 3 times were when I was training prayer and afk'd.
---
I also got killed once when I had finished a clue, but don't consider it a pk since I literally asked the guy to kill me. It was funny, too, he misclicked on a nearby mob before he hit me.
---
I‚Äôll bite. It says ‚Äúhigh level gear‚Äù not 300m gear. The pkers this is referring to are wearing salad robes and blue wizard hats with water staves risking maybe 30k and trying to kill someone wearing a 6m shield. Logic tho amirite
---
Wheres the others?
---
Yuri Vesp death reeee
---
He's complaining,  but not actually complaining.  It's gamer complaining.  Like how you complain every time you miss a shot in rocket league,  or when someone kills you in CoD,  or when you don't get the smash ball after hitting it a dozen times.
---
"Just move lol"
---
Should‚Äôve started in f2p. Rip you make a new account.
---
Even if I was in salad robes I'd still be risking more than you.
---
I'd assume this would also work for teleports?
---
I don't get skull tricked. I'm saying in situations where people do choose to fight back, what I have said comes into play. 
---
Thats one trick, another is to have a similarly named alt logged out in a known location, start a fight, then, when the target fights back, run to that spot and log in on the alt. I'm sure there's many other methods.
---
Op thinks racism is funny
---
This is how singles pking has been for years . And like someone else said there‚Äôs a spec timer . You clowns literally have bulwarks and can‚Äôt tank stop trying to ruin this game Jesus
---
This is super sweet. I think it would look even better if the lighting was less flat. Maybe some emissive light from the seals and/or the cracks in the ground or something.
---
Alotttttt of evidence that trump has had some sketchy relations with Jeffrey Epstein. 
---
Trump, along with tons of other big names. 
---
Basically, Pizzagate, the thing we all mocked a couple years ago, is pretty damn accurate
---
OK, let's do a little comparison, shall we?
---
For the PVMer we have a normal set up -- blk dhide, dinhs, bgloves, rune boots, serp helm, and glory. 
---
[As you can see here, in max melee the PVM gets nearly 150 slash defense in max pk gear (between 15-20m risk depending on prices) compared to the dinhs 4m.](https://imgur.com/a/DECqadq)
---
[next up, let's look at range -- here with armadyl cross bow, opal bolts (e), karils, imbued archers ring, and of course the book of law again the pvmer comes out with a 109 defense bonus compared to the max gear pker](https://imgur.com/a/sKuqJA3)
---
[last, but certainly not least, lets have a look at mage - with full ahrims, toxic staff, book of darkness, glory, imbued cape (which is lost on death should the pker die), rune boots, and of course his seers ring i finally the pker has one match up.....by 27 magic bonus, making the chance for a freeze to catch assuming the pvmer has 75+ magic and 75+ def still less likely than it is likely.](https://imgur.com/a/un4GeH0)
---
Now, when we consider that a pker must carry all three forms of combat with him in order to have a chance that puts the cost of the gear the pker must bring in order to lose 2\3 combat styles at roughly, of course, 70m while the pvmer must bring only 4m and some change while risking likely 20-30k in supplies in his inventory. 
---
Ya know, at first I was on the 'pro nerf' but after listening to you, someone who clearly has quite a grip on gear match ups in pvp, I think I've came around...
---
And 100k tier 40 gear should rival tier 75 8m why?
---
Rapier and cerb... all of that shit I know but when it‚Äôs a direct copy no one wants it, I love rs3 and all of it‚Äôs spell things minus the graphics
---
Pretty sure it was a while back and didn‚Äôt pass.

Makes more sense than complaining about ping when it's literally dependant on your connection and location.
---
The problem is that RELATIVE to other games, which is what you look at, not how expensive or cheap it is for an individual, it is an expensive game when most games are pay once for the game or free with MTX, or free games with seasonal passes.
---
Yes exactly - there was no apparent reasonable alternative. A few years later when credit institutes improved their security systems, trade restrictions weren't needed anymore and we got free trade back. 2010 or so? Not sure.
---
Can you quote which part of his post he said he was wearing salad robes and a water staff?
---
Tokkul
---
Lavas, Revs (yes I know revs doesnt count), wildy gwd, chaos altar, Venenatis, Vet'ion, Maze Rune rocks, ice plateau rune rocks, dark crabs
---
Couple side notes:
---
Dark Crabs - The one dude I never could escape from was using ahrims, I did 84-91 fishing there with bulwark so I saw a lot of shit, 90% mystics
---
Chaos Altar - seems to have the best geared pkers in the wildy, and the poor lads using bulwark there got shit on p often
---
You don't have to be a PvPer to use wilderness content a lot and get a good feel for what goes on out there
---
So you can't spare 2 or 3 seconds to read someone name but you can spare the few hundred mill you could potentially lose by attacking someone and getting skulled? Which sounds better? Sparing a few seconds and losing 1 hit and potentially still being able to win the fight, or just attacking someone and hoping for the best which then results in you getting skulled and possibly losing hundreds of mill...?
---
I didn't expect that sort of 5th panel when I opened this post.
---
Can you not read? absolute cretin
---
U can actually atk with bulwark btw. Theres also no penalty to just put it on during atks.
---
Right.
---
And what's the problem with that?
---
Is it perhaps the fact that you do not have max mage or that you're scared to bring it with you because an actual opponent who PKs might show up and kill you?
---
Fight the good fight, Salad brother!
---
Honestly they should just enable the 20% passive when you are getting attacked by more than one enemy. If they did this then I would agree with the nerf.
---
Sarcasm reflects off your max cape huh
---
You don't think logging into a similarly named alt to trick someone into attacking the wrong account and skulling up is an underhanded tactic?
---
I also think tick manipulation was mechic abuse, but jagex has said that it's here to stay, so what are you gonna do.
---
some boiz locker room shit going down here man
---
he joined isis
---
the Right click left click method would sound cool in theory, but for a lot of people who may be panicking would accidentally skull up during fights. Also people could just log ontop of traps when chinners go to right click reset them, thus skulling on them (unless they have the option turned off)
---
Then you're delusional
---
You do.
---
It's definitely not abuse. It's *ethically* wrong I'd say but I'd replace underhanded with clever personally. It's also a pretty sweaty tactic
---
Plz explain mechanics being abused ???
---
&gt; If you're PKing, you have no reason to not use those 2 barrages and 5 bolts to kill a dude and make sure he has nothing.
---
The top comment in this thread is a guy saying he literally does exactly that, lmao. I love the PvPers that come in and are like "yea but we're not all shitheads" but the rest of the community is like "Pepega :megaphone: KILLED THE CLUE HUNTER LOL"
---
When you jump the ditch it tells you you can be attacked, but that if ur not skulled u keep 3 of your items. Theres is the risk that the game lays out, pvp combat. But now theres this bullshit scammy risk of getting skull tricked, which the game did not intend. If scamming is against the rules, how should skull tricking not be considered scamming? With the rs font some names are identical, so you cant even say its a matter of "not paying attention"
---
Black hide is a tier 70 armor. It‚Äôs not the same as mystics or rune.
---
skull tricking is exactly that, a trick
---
it's basically scamming through wildy mechanics
---
is skulltricking part of the game? yes. Is scamming part of the game? yes. Can we complain about them? fuck yes
---
Revs, mage bank, green drags, venenatis. Doesnt matter what % i see when its the majority i see. According to comments by other people, they witness the same
---
&gt;So yes, how dare jagex take opinions of the people who actually pk
---
Because taking the opinion of a specific demography does not mean taking the opinion of your whole playerbase nor the majority of it. Which is the purpose of a poll and the reasons poll exist in the first place.
---
&gt;warding shouldn't need to be polled.
---
I'm pro-warding and even I know it would be stupid to add it without polling first.
---
I hate it when people say raids are the same thing as dung. like no not at all did you even play dungeoneering?
---
I don't really see how thats relevant, but okay.
---
You sound like a salad robes 'pker' who gets hyped to share 1/10 of a spade with your clannies
---
Honestly I highly suggest just bringing dhides rune cbow, dds, food and pots when doing a clue, it's no risk and you never know you might just have fun
---
Fresh as heck ultra boots Mann
---
I'll get right on it.
---
You do realise your comment is a prime example of why everyone thinks the 2007scape reddit comoonety is retarded right? I literally live in the same country that the servers are based in and should be able to expect a decent connection when I pay for these servers... 4HEAD M8
---
I don't really get this debate. I fully anticipate being attacked when I go into the wilderness, yet mitigate it as much as possible. 
---
Using a bulwark makes you a harder kill, thus making it less likely that you will be chosen as a target compared to the other players. 
---
Pkers will almost always go for the easiest option.
---
&gt;It doesn't take a "few weeks", you can get it done in a few days. 
---
   
---
Of course, but I'm being generous here. The average pvmer isn't that good. 
---
&gt;You'll feel more accomplished and can make a competition out of it with your friends, while not risking your account getting banned with the cape removed.    
---
I don't play this game for the feeling of accomplishment. I play it for fun. I get the feeling of accomplishment from real life stuff.
---
"Playing the game the right way"
---
The game lays out the mechanic of skulling. If you are tricking people to break that mechanic, that is NOT part of the game
---
Your argument for why pkers shouldn't just use better gear is basically "it'd be higher risk". The player in Dihn's presents a case of high reward. So shouldn't it be fair to expect high risk in order to take on higher reward?
---
love that light pouring through idea, thanks!
---
Literally just pay the bill it will be 1 month of p2p how poor are you
---
My ags isn‚Äôt a plus 1 if I protect item 5head
---
I think you're splitting hairs on the definition of underhanded.
---
I only played the base game. I'm good with osrs. Really, I'd like to not be playing any mmos, but you know. Addicts gotta be addicted.
---
If it doesnt pass, they should either repoll it one more time after clarifying the changes and their benefits. Or just not do it.
---
Well too bad your country is pretty big and your connection is weak?
---
Took me 500 kc of basement cyclopes for the ddef.
---
I'll be playing classic just because I'm burnt out on OSRS...but by no means is it a replacement for me. I'll probably be bored of classic in a month.
---
1/100
---
When I say I pk I don‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a no-lifer with it. Players can do pvm AND kill players without going full tilt either way. I just kill some randoms around the wildy and get killed by more experienced players.
---
Started doing it when I watched those bounty hunter bot videos looking to help stop the botting.
---
But be as butt hurt as you want, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that effective pking gear is super inexpensive. Yea I know you can buy more expensive gear to be even more effective in pking but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you can do very well with just a water staff and salad robes.
---
Even facing someone in max mage it's a joke to tank with a bulwark 
---
honestly feel like 90+% of the people posting this shit have no actual PK experience and are just spouting the same contrived scenarios as everyone else
---
any competent pvmer will have one because the negative trade-off is non-existent
---
Spirit shields are very late game &amp; d'hide shield have pretty high reqs for limited rewards. (It's hard to get addy nails)
---
Personally, I think item availability unique to the wilderness is fine. Why should everything be safe to complete or obtain?
---
The mechnaic abuse imo is that that some names can look entirely identical with the rs font. There needs to be a way to identify who attacked you vs someone who hasnt. Hate to say, but rs3 solved this, it puts an asterick next to the npc or person ur in combat with
---
Reddit and its upvote/downvote system is far more suited to brainless circlejerking hence the abundance of circlejerk subreddits across the site. 
---
Swamp man good rc bad
---
black dhides are pretty op tho, you know how everyone complains about dinh's and it has 18 magic def for ~6m? black dhide chaps &amp; top has 78 magic def for ~12.250gp
---
It's not even expensive relative to other games lol pls stop
---
Oh hey Lindybiege. I liked that dude until he spent far too much time talking about things which he was clueless about.
---
Exactly, this is why I attack anyone I see, if you're naked it's only going to take one freeze and a couple bolts so why wouldn't i/they attack you
---
I‚Äôm out of the loop, YouTube series? Need something to watch üòÅ
---
&gt; No one is gonna bring full ahrims or ancestrals and risk getting banged out by a ballista squad just to have 5% more chance to land a freeze on someone that risks black dhides, a snakeskin bandana and a rev bracelet.
---
Sounds like if they don't want *high risk*, they shouldn't get *high reward*.
---
He steals the show in literally anything he's in haha
---
My FBI guy " buying gf??? Boys I think we're onto something!"
---
People are going to get upset and say that comparable gear for offense is more expensive, which is due to there being much higher demand since it's used throughout the rest of the entire game for other things and not just niche pvp situations.
---
What part of the spectrum are you in? Do you like trains or fire trucks?
---
I pk fairly often and I would say those shields would not be something I'd go for on an iron man.  The picks wouldn't be so bad. I've gotten a couple of them from callisto and vetion on my main.
---
I just do everything in the Wildy in a 2.2k world. 99% of PKers are ADHD and can't sit still and do the same thing for more than 10 minutes so they can't even get into a 2.2k world.
---
That's how I did MA2, all my wildy clues, wilderness elite diary, etc.
---
Seeing as the black d hide that usually comes with the bulwark costs more than salad robes, and most people don‚Äôt just walk into the wilderness to afk with empty inventories and a bulwark, your argument is just beyond dumb.
---
Sure they can. Mod Ash has even said in the past if the Ely dipped below a certain price point that they would do something to increase the cost.  To increase the price Jagex could make an item sink (similar to tentacle whips) by requiring an attachment.  Alternatively they could increase the cost of using it in PvP by making it "break" like untradeables and require a hefty price tag (&gt;1m) to repair it.  At least that way when you die there is an actual risk to it when it is one of your +3 or +4 items.
---
Ok lets play a game
---
LIKED8S LIKED8S LIKED8S LlKED8S LIKED8S
---
You have 2.4 seconds (an attack cycle)
---
Which one is not the same?
---
Except you literally only listed spots where scrub pkers go to bully pvmers and not a single actual pvp hot spot. This here is the center of my point. You DO have to be a pvper to go the the areas where real pvpers are looking for fights.(well obviously anyone could go there but why would they) Ofcourse when you limit your interaction to only the PvM/Skill hotspots you will see 1 kind of player. If i went to the middle of a Ghetto and got robbed, it wouldn't be fair for me to say that all \*insert racial group\* are scumbags who rob people. Do you genuinely believe that majority of dedicated pvp players try to gank pvmers for fun?
---
Watch any pk streamer and 90% of the time they wear nothing higher than mystic. The only time you see ahrims or higher is if they're asked to high risk by someone. 
---
Go out into the wildy, and 99% of the time all you see is xerics/mystics. You can be a by stander and see that thats the load out of the majority of solo pkers.
---
Enjoy the freebie pvpers. Will continue to hard vote no to every single change that might benefit you.
---
Ask the someone else whos card you used if they charged back with their bank
---
I did start out in f2p
---
There is nothing that will make me go back to rs3.
---
Tier 70 armor that can be easily crafted, mind you. More of a problem with how easy it is to get than with how powerful it is. The level requirement is irrelevant in the discussion.
---
It takes more than a few seconds to meticulously read wiebrieu8237 when mils on on the line
---
Using a mental illness as an insult, you sir are the COOLEST.
---
Next thing you know, justiciar is going to be too OP to tank with and thats going to be nerfed, right?
---
Well then bring some actual risk lmao thats the point no?
---
inb4 BUT D HIDE IS CHEAP
---
Fuck fashionscape, go play barbie dress up online
---
This actually makes sense. increases survivability but makes you escape much slower which gives the pker a larger chance to win.
---
No I can understand that part.  Where I'm stuck is why it was polled in the first place.  
---
Why even poll something if the plan is to do it anyway? It looks shady as hell.
---
They already do, pvmers dont fight back. Are you saying that the pvmers only option should be to just roll over and die? That's how content becomes dead. Theres no point to a higher gp/hr if you are nearly guaranteed to lose it all because you have next to no option of defending yourself.
---
It was definitely a charge back
---
ahhh multi-logging. I tip my hat to you
---
Lets just remove the wild. Boom, problem solved. Then all the austists can shut the fuck up
---
So on the mystics front. Unfortunately for the set, its at alch price so it wont get any cheaper, even though, tier wise, it sucks. 
---
Price doesnt change the fact that tier 40 gear shouldnt be near as good as black dhide, especially taking combat triangle into account.
---
People who actually use max are complaining for the sake of it. They have a ~60% chance to hit and against black hide fury suffering augury 99 mage. I believe thats more than enough to take down someone who has literal max defensive items, i mean how much is reasonable? Landing every barrage? Only need 2 or 3 to kill most of the time anyway.
---
And maybe, just maybe, Jagex was trying to discuss the huge discrepancy in affordable mage gear with a crafting-esque skill.
---
fishing on two accounts? EHP
---
Swamp man put like 650 hours of play time into like a 17 minute video that was very entertaining. I gotta give it to him.
---
What will you be next week?
---
Aww he got herblore pet too, now they‚Äôll have their own adventures :‚Äô)
---
id say a better suggestion would be to remove the total level restriction on ccs and make a default channel that the current world is put in.
---
Yes, this is better than how it is right now, and way better than gravestones if we cant have original mechanics. Ironmen are entitled though and would have a fit.
---
It's been in the game for 2.5 years yo
---
Schizophrenic with aspergers makes reddit post about hallucination he had on runescape
---
I'm saying not only should pvmers be outgeared if they try to fight back, but they also shouldn't have a high chance to escape even if they solely focus on escaping.
---
\&gt;you are clearly angry at the way things are in THIS game 
---
You're actually brain dead. I'm not angry the way things are in THIS game, you are. You're the one crying about how tier 70 armor is better than tier 40, not me. Lmao it's embarrassing I have to explain this to you.
---
even if you're a clan who regularly clears other clans or small teams, you generally don't need more than salad robes, d hides or basic tank gear. the numbers matter most and weaponry matters infinitely more than armor.
---
literally no one complains about being killed in the wilderness.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Players that don't want to be pk'ed shouldn't enter the wilderness. Downvote away.
---
Magic isnt to deal heavy damage though, its to alter stats, snare, aoe, heal. It would be OP if it was more accurate and dealt more damage. Thats the point
---
The math has literally been done which directly contradicts your opinion. You have no fucking idea what you're talking about
---
When you‚Äôre being hit by atleast 3 people it seems like it‚Äôs 100%
---
This isn't the content osrs wants, but its the content we NEED.
---
It‚Äôs called auto retaliate and player att options on
---
No yeah, you‚Äôre right, the complaint here is that there‚Äôs no point in trying to attack people who wear the item. PvMers are calling it a great tanking item (which it is) - but I‚Äôm calling it a great pker-repellant - which to me is OP, in the same way that mosquitos are calling insect repellant OP. There‚Äôs not even a point in attacking them currently, which means they have no risk of being in the wilderness. Anything in any game that is High reward/low risk is usually in need of reworks/nerfs.
---
pvmers circlejerk, pkers smart
---
That's true, but pvmers think they are above pkers and when they go to wilderness they think they should be immune to getting attacked for some strange reason. Yea of course i get mad as well if i die during my wilderness slayer task but you dont find me bitching about it on reddit or voting no to every single pk update.
---
chin hunters / prayer trainers usually have a bit more on them than 50k. besides, pking is supposed to be riskier than other activities in the wilderness.
---
Chaos temple nobody was ever able to touch me with my bulwark, except for one guy who rushed me in full bandos and claws. He fully deserved my 2m in bones for having the balls to risk more than xerician robes.
---
man youre all over these threads
---
i've only picked up pking recently, myself. bulwark does add an insane amount of tank, but when im pking and see the shield come out, i dont get frustrated or disheartened. i see it as a challenge to the coordination of myself, my team and a test to our ability to use what we can do work around the fat tank stats.
---
Were you willing to lose those 3 items or not?
---
Well if range or melee had aoe, healing, snares, and stat alters we would call them over powered. Spec attacks not notwithstanding
---
Is this reddit assuming things again? There's no evidence Trump was involved in any of that. Epstein is himself a Democrat supporter, why would Trump ever have a relation with him?
---
Losing hundreds of hours of progress to one death or dc? Yeah its a no from me.
---
Just copy RS3‚Äôs vastly superior mechanic, just a flat % GP cost for lost items.
---
Goldsink and makes far more sense
---
twitter. they blame voting silences them. much like polling
---
Crudely said but i agree with your point really, i understand that fashionscape matters to some people (i am not one of them!) but we can't go altering the whole point with acquiring these xp boost outfits.
---
&gt;would you be in favor of removing the wilderness if pking is bad
---
Oof that's a huge strawman there
---
I actually think graceful suffers from a similar problem. It's really overused. But that one is trickier to solve. I'm not sure of a good way to address graceful, and besides, it's not something you would particularly want to wear when doing something like woodcutting or fishing.
---
tube cummies
---
Oh cool! 15 black dragon hides to make a chest piece. How do you think we can do that in one inventory?
---
This made me want a mini pet for my pet.
---
This was amazing. Such a display of skill.
---
Golden tinderbox should make gold fires, for like actual use make the gold pot hold infinite bones for the ectofunctus
---
Well I'm sort of confused what his opinion is? If PKing is, in his words, "very rarely ever good", then what benefit does the Wilderness pose?
---
I didnt say that was what he supported btw, I asked him and gave him a fair chance to clarify his position. That's not a strawman.
---
yes, quite so
---
I don‚Äôt really know anything about the lore of the shield, but if this works, then great!
---
Im a reddit masochist
---
DWH has a slower attack rate than hasta/bludgeon, more expensive, and it already has low crush def
---
People who make the NPC memes are always the NPCs themselves.
---
Have you been on reddit lately?
---
&gt; He also asked if im 18, and I said yes. 
---
&gt;**and I said yes**
---
Even with big risk you will have trouble killing someone with a bulwark, protect from range, and dhide. Which isn't worth it at that point. Why rush tens of mils to kill a guy with max a couple hundred thousand coins?
---
warding actually good pvmers dumb
---
&gt;whose collective iq struggles to reach room temperature
---
You sound a bit insecure there. 
---
If you come to the wilderness, expect to get pked. If you don‚Äôt like it, stick to your woodcutting. 
---
The dihns is overpowered, everyone knows it. I don‚Äôt expect a retarded pvmer slave such as yourself to admit it, as it is the only thing keeping you from a humiliating death, seeing as you probably can‚Äôt switch items or prayers to save your life.
---
At least a 20 min snare i mean cmon
---
That is not on by default.
---
*shaking in my boots*
---
pvp good pvm bad
---
Get that boi a dmed at least
---
&gt; removing the actual skulling mechanic
---
im saving this comment to show to people as a perfect example of a strawman
---
Lol that edit tho
---
If you're the aggressor on a tank who can't fight back, on a rival side of the combat triangle, then yeah probably.
---
What do you mean? The point of the outfits is to reward you for doing the activities they come from, not to reward you for looking a certain way. What value is there in forcing you to look a certain way to get the experience bonus?
---
it used to cost a lot more money.
---
I really like this. Thank you
---
Be careful what you ask for. This is how rs3 got ‚Äúcosmetic overrides‚Äù and mtx up the ass with it.
---
Jokes on them I was never winning anyway :D
---
If it‚Äôs overpowered then why is it only used in that niche circumstance and why is it the cheapest shittest raid item? Surely if it was actually overpowered people would be using it to tank bosses while their team kills them forever, but they don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs almost always better to just straight dps
---
so just because something is some way it should stay that way?
---
guess we never getting any updates bois
---
Oh Woops didn‚Äôt check usernames my bad
---
I mean the reason runescape takes so much skill is fighting the terrible interface. (terrible meaning it's hard to get anything done, which is the point of an interface)
---
If you had like a wow action bar control scheme it still would be challenging but less so.
---
Person: something stupid
---
Someone else: that's fucking stupid
---
Person: bruh I'm just kidding
---
None of this is a real reply to my comment. 
---
Yeah, there are more PvMers and skillers and non-pkers in game nowadays. 
---
That doesn't change the meat of my comment, which you ignored.
---
Thats pretty cool. More stuff than I knew it was used for. Ty for answering.
---
No one is forced into the wilderness lmao. If you don't want danger don't go in or don't risk.
---
using a client that tells you where to stand and everything? OK
---
Thank you, u/yellow-boxes very cool
---
sir this is wendy's
---
The thing is it's *your* fault if you get skulled... Unless it's through the auto-retaliate bug, fine. But don't complain if you click on someone and get skulled...
---
A bulwark and black dhide is four slots.
---
This is really good advice. Even when I'm taking a break from OSRS, i browse this sub because its just so over the top and entertaining. 
---
Small nerf to an end game item most of us probably never even used: OMG WTF?!?!
---
i love being toxic when i pk and i love being toxic to pkers when i escape at callisto/vene/vetion
---
Please keep you right and left politics out of it this is a video game. Also don't assume that most gamers are for alt right it has no place in this community. Calling some one a racist is not and argument grow up and stick to the argument at hand thanks.
---
Don't fucking attack them then.
---
No it shouldn‚Äôt because you just admitted it‚Äôs an overpowered item that has been causing problems for years. Integrity changes don‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt get polled because they will never pass they tried this before.
---
It should break and drop 1m coins and cost 1m to fix.
---
Definitely sus
---
It really seems to like you, though...
---
I wonder if RS code could pull off an item that has like scaling defense based on # of attackers but terrible defense otherwise
---
um no, 1m is not worth my time at all.  Peanuts.
---
You mean people would rather watch fast paced high intensity gameplay instead of grinding out skills for questing? I'm shocked.
---
No. We just cuddle
---
Dude it's not a fuckin lifestyle or something, it's just not leveling def. Basically all the quests and reqs and stats and shit you need for 1def, you will eventually need for 45def aswell. A quested 1def pure is basically just halfway to being a zerker.
---
‚ÄòPurely stack defense‚Äô doesn‚Äôt = bulwark + fucking black d hide
---
Luckily I work down the street from the company so I can pitch your idea.
---
Yes they should have a reasonable ability to escape. 9 out of 10 times is not reasonable. It should be lower considering the pvmer has bulwark, it is in singles, and the pker has some risk.
---
Just get all your little clan buddies and go get some guy in Dinhs while he‚Äôs training prayer in multi. Then you guys can suck each other off for the black d‚Äôhide chaps he was wearing and complain about them being too cheap and op despite the fact that you‚Äôre wearing cheap and effective robes! Awesome dude!!
---
NOBODY who is legitimately good at pking uses fucking salad robes
---
The fact that it can freeze you in place for 20 seconds or prevent you from teleporting means it *should* have a lower accuracy. Those are really powerful things to do
---
It'd be cool if different spells could have different accuracy values. Pure damage spells could have a high chance to hit while teleblocks and freezes could be tougher to land
---
It's dropped from a raids with the same rarity as the best mage armor in the game, and is one of the best shields in the game.  The fact that its valued at only 6 mil should signify that it does not require a nerf.
---
No, this is ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äjagexü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
People don‚Äôt consider that Dinh‚Äôs is raid tier gear (which should mean it is very powerful), no they just see ‚Äúless than 10m on GE, it shouldn‚Äôt be that strong!‚Äù
---
I don't really feel like this type of content and roles belong in osrs at this point and the bulwark should have never been added imo. If we did get an update like this, it would have to come with a lot of changes and a ton of discussion
---
Make it wieldable.
---
They are prison tats
---
Would hardly call it "new". You guys post this shit every day.
---
https://youtu.be/-15VC4Yxzys
---
well yeah? the vast majority of this playerbase arent people with 2-4  accounts who make pures/alts to gold farm?
---
fucking casuals and their fucking enjoyment of the game.. need to watch more kill montages and austitic flexes of skill tricking ppl for rsgp lol
---
Man there‚Äôs no point in arguing. PvMers make a bigger majority and one day the wildy or PvP will be removed once again, then they‚Äôll complain about how the game died
---
You could. Adamant is sold at some shops like full helm at barb village I think. Rune is sold at desert and guild south of varrock
---
Nice gains bro!
---
What app is that? It looks good
---
I've got 200kc Zulrah (no rare yet) and 350kc Vorkath, both are good money makers. Zulrah is a lot harder to learn, but faster and easier once you do manage to learn it. I alternate between the two if I get bored of one, but Vorkath is definitely easier to learn and better money
---
Truth is the player base is a hivemind.
---
If there was going to be a bone whip attachment I'd assume it'd be the Hydra tail as that's what was being considered before
---
If you want a gender bender, go see the MakeOver Mage
---
Jiggle ;)
---
Linking to facebook from reddit, you are a sick man
---
"You are not entitled to have a good chance of not dying if you invest in it"
---
How deluded is that? 
---
YOU are not entitled to get the kill. YOU getting the kill is at the expense of another player. Me living doesn't drop your shit.
---
In every fucking scenario you all describe a dude in black dhide being incincible risking nothing. THEN WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU ATTACKING THEM? YOU HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN
---
Jesus Christ pkers are so retarded.
---
The purpose of doing mlm for 20 hours was to get my xp boost. How does that defeat the purpose?
---
Bet, will do thanks for the advice
---
I hope jagex reads this and realise competitive castle wars comp is exactly what the community needs
---
Their vocabulary pretty much ends at "sit kid"
---
Are you serious? The whole point of the wild is that it's risky. If you're invincible in the wild that defeats every purpose of the wild.
---
i remember doing clan events back in the day, just us noobs, goingbossing for our first time. high and low leveled players all around 10 ppl killing bandos for 4h to end with like 500k loot at the end. good old times.
---
Sometimes you just have to remember you play this game for fun, not the xp.
---
You can buy adamant and rune stuff from some shops. Dragon is tricky because you need them as drops.
---
There is a 0% chance of you dying in singles with a bulwark. A bulwark is cheap as fuck and you don‚Äôt even risk it, stop calling it an investment. I don‚Äôt even PK I‚Äôm just not a complete fucking retard like yourself.
---
Here's the solution that'll make everyone happy. The Dinhs bulwark is fine for the skills and content it is locked behind in order to obtain it when relating it to its bonuses. The real problem is the price that PvPers are really bitching about. So here's what we have to do.
---
Step 1.
---
Push the bulwark lower on the CoX drop table (to where elder maul, tbow, and Kodak are at). That will decrease the rate of supply of bulwarks in the game, which will raise the longterm price if the bulwark.
---
Step 2.
---
Make more PvM opportunities to use the bulwark, because it's only use is niche PvP situations, which gives it a low demand, which is why its price is low. By making more opportunities to use it, which will increase the demand for it, which will increase the price. This could be in the form of new bosses or another raids where equipping the bulwark severely lowers damage of a special attack similar to a dfs to dragon fire. 
---
This may not entirely fix it or raise the price by that much, but it will be a step in a direction to fix problems that everyone (PvPers and PvMers alike) are bitching about the bulwark.
---
Since when has range ever lost to melee? Literally never.
---
Agreed bro. Shits super annoying to see. Can‚Äôt wait til it dies down.
---
thank you!
---
I wish they would allow me to remove the graceful blessing off my graceful gear and put it onto some other zero stat gear of my choosing. Let me boil my graceful hood down into a special soup I can dunk my aviator hat into.
---
I've been doing black chins since the update testing dinhs. Still busted. I have enough time to shit talk a trip brridder in ahrims and karils with like 15 Sara's left. 
---
Its too easy to survive the pking brainlets.
---
so funny hhaaha LOL
---
there was absolutely nothing humerous about /u/kingdom9999's comment.  just plain hating and stupid.
---
Also bottled water has to be bought prepackaged as opposed to fountain drinks which are bought as massive syrup bags and poured on-site.
---
Non-bottled water is almost always free.
---
Is there anything in runescape that says gnomes aren‚Äôt gay?
---
Shit. First reddit post. This is not a good look for me.
---
I laughed more than I should‚Äôve, this is great
---
Half an hour each month, better off hopping crafting store for 5mins and get like 2-3k thread.
---
Thanks for keeping the game free for me I guess
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
I might be a bit late, but if you're going to lower the chaos elemental's respawn time can you set it to 30 seconds rather than a minute? every other boss in the wilderness has a respawn timer of 30 seconds, it'd be weird for chaos ele to be more than that.
---
you read someone's math on a Reddit comment 1 hour ago that shows 50% accuracy against 15k dhides and a bulwark using mage mage.  congratulations?
---
&gt; &gt; yeah but i wanna do it in the wild
---
There's a difference between "wanting" to do the wildy content and Jagex putting some of the best xp and/or gp methods in the wild, "forcing" people that otherwise wouldn't go there. Causing even more anger towards PKers from said people. 
---
See: Black chins, Chaos altar, all the fucking wine spawns, wilderness slayer, revs etc etc etc
---
Also other question, should i use pearl bolts (E) over diamond bolts (E)?
---
Anyone who puts a word count in their essay title lmaoo
---
There was a whole to-do last week over Jagex "partnering" with other companies to introduce timed exclusives. Its all the sub talked about last week. 10s summary:
---
Jagex makes a poll basically asking "Hey, how does everyone feel about cosmetics? Do you want more house cosmetics like a mortanyia or elves theme?" And then you go on the blog and its like "Hey, we want more money, so these themes are going to be locked behind promotions with partner companies like Twitch. Go vote yes". People flipped their shit. Jagex fixed the poll to reflect that it would be 'partnered' content or something like that. Poll got voted down so hard Jagex ended it early. They then wrote a passive aggressive blog about how much they wanted this but are gracing us by listening to the polls.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, are there still cw clan chats
---
That doesn't change the fact your logic is flawed. You're trying to make an asymmetrical situation equal. Should you have a 50/50 shot of killing someone with equal gear as you if they're one tile away from you not being able to attack them? How about when they have a teleport? Saying you should have a 50/50 chance of killing someone who has equal gear is just laughable, especially when you take into account whether or not you're actually GOOD at pking. There's so many variables that you're just ignoring.
---
Rip :(
---
Thanks! I did like it!
---
How is this a problem? Putting a Bulwark on means the pkers' target has zero chance in fighting back versus equipping a weapon and fighting back.
---
With nmz points you can imbue berserker, archer, and seers rings as well as slayer helm. Gives a lot of damage bonuses.
---
Strong resemblance to Evil Dave.
---
Lol, this game sure is home to some special snowflakes

The purpose of doing whatever mlm is, is to acquire the outfit that gives the xp boost, not for just the ability to obtain an xp boost. The clothes gives the xp boost not the activity. If ppl don't like how they look with the outfit, then the solution is really simple, just don't wear it!
