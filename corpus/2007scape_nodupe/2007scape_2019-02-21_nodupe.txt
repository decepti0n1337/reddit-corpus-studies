Is time travel possible? All I need to do is go forward one week forever...
---
Lol nah I got what he was saying. I’m kidding. 
---
What, do you use Runelite lol?
---
oof
---
Of course it is. Jagex will most likely try to either revamp this piece or content or they will just outright start banning people that utilize the RuneLite developer tools for their own benefit.
---
As Settled said, it falls into a grey area, much like the puzzle box / clue scroll solvers.
---

---
I'm personally fine with it as I think it's unnecessarily laborious to complete the bogs otherwise.
---
Toggle click to drop when you click your Rune pouches and they will automatically empty, then just turn it off to fill them. Save me a lot of time on mobile.
---
hmmmmmm
---
I only hear Laurel Salika
---
This day has crawled by more slowly than the snails of Mort Myre swamp waiting for the video to drop. How will I survive this next week?
---
don’t follow rs YouTubers. what’s special about this
---
Did someone say Swampletics??
---
It was good wym
---
Swamp has turned into a god in the OSRS community. I can’t remember the time a large mass of people was this hyped for a new video. 
---
shud be ban for abusing runelite dev mode 
---
D O P A M I N E

Q&amp;A which I cba to link. I'll send you MLGudi's summary gimme a sec

Wait, that’s illegal
---
To share my tiny bit of bad luck of yesterday, I went to demonics since i got a black demon task (finally) and the first demonic I attack was at like half health, so I finish it off so he gets out of my way. This guy about 20 squares away got a zenyte from it.
---
Cheat client strikes again
---
You should be doing (1/140)^3 then multiplying that by 6. And then that’s just the odds of getting those 3 specific items in one clue scroll, there would be many more combinations of value that would bring you similar gp
---
Is there a new video. 
---
IkWhatUDidLastSummer is the new AutumnElegy now, havent you heard
---
M
---
Ooh do you have a store up yet? If so post the link. I'd buy some
---
Lol alright I guess. If I was working I wasn't playing at all, and if I had schoolwork to do I judged whether I could manage to do both that and look at my screen every few minutes to fish at the same time.
---
Thank u for the math
---
There’s your semantically important term there. “Inspired by their design” 
---
It's like seeing the numbers in the matrix.
---
It's the bridge near the Nature Grotto in Morytania.
---
I did 70 to 77 RC in less than a week on mobile at zmi in between working it's really not that hard.
---
The tab buttons are bigger. Not quite lateral.
---
how many people you shot?
---
Fam its not about the idea but how you package it. Basic marketing
---
But combat can be so afk that you could just train it while working on another account. 
---
To forge my own journey from scratch
---
Thank you for your advice.
---
This changes everything 
---
Not yet. Currently working on establishing an LLC. Hopefully in the next month the store will go live. I’ll certainly post about it here :) 
---
Only one who gets karma is settled. Hopefully everyone els gets mass downvotes 
---
That makes sense. Is there any bosses you would recommend?
---
China is classed as a developing country by the WTO and most economists. Guess those uneducated idiots need to listen to the smart-ass Redditors like yourself.
---
Its disruptive to the minigame for anybody without access to trading. I'm perfectly happy with using TT items of lower tiers for higher tiers such as seen in elite clues and the flared trouser clue. It seems like a logical progression in the minigame. Prior to the expansion of clues all levels of clues could be done with reasonable requirements and item collecting. For example: Halberds being a more difficult item/emote requirement to meet. 
---
A lot of people in the iron community can't complete relatively easy clues because they need a reward from the clue tier that they're trying to complete. See the Hard Khazari Jungle clue: *Beckon on the east coast of the Kharazi Jungle. Beware of double agents! Equip any vestment stole and a heraldic rune shield*. **Or** *Cheer at the top of the agility pyramid. Beware of double agents! Equip a blue mystic robe top, and any rune heraldic shield.*
---
Okay great. I need two rewards from hard tier clues to complete this hard tier clue. Its also a common clue to get. Its the "must have experience for the entry level position" fallacy. You can use Armadyl, Ancient and Bandos stoles which are rewarded from medium clues. That is reasonable. But needing a Rune Helm or Shield that relies purely on luck is a poorly balanced - granted  I understand that the clues were implemented before Iron Man mode was developed. Being able to use the construction version should be acceptable as the requirements to get the item rely on stats more that a lucky drop. 
---
The hard clue emote table is PLAGUED by this problem. There are 4 out of 16 hard emote clues that require tt items from hard clues. That's a 25% chance of a bad clue. If you don't have access to trading then it makes the clues impossible to complete. This is a trait that is shared by no other clue tiers. 
---
Imagine getting to step 5-6 and this happens to you. Its a waste of time for players. 
---
Implying I watch any OSRS YouTube content that isn't Swampletics
---
Next up: Jagex bans use of RL dev mode &amp; patches randoms.
---
After recently mixing my ultimate color palette, I’ve decide to up the spectrum
---
Downvote everyone els posting his video on here
---
Yeah I agree the community is too split on this for any meaningful updates to go through right now. Excluding pvp is just dividing the votes even further and with the recent pvp polls being voted down I see this just as more spite than anything. People are afraid of change when I think it would be refreshing and interest more people
---
I say use the Runelite feature for the bog, please don't be a masochist and do the bog regularly 
---
But the aesthetic mannnnn
---
no rewards will pass a poll that will make the activity actually played.
---
Oh god, I am ready. Take me now my sweet prince.
---
awesome thanks
---
Needs small 2xp drops above the bridge
---
Yea, but I don't have the quest reqs, I'm finishing up 99 runecraft before finishing up quests.
---
cmon mate give us a ring
---
You were wrong
---
3 months ago with those stats? I call either botting or severe autism
---
Is there any proof from the devs about this?
---
S 
---
Who has made that outro pic? Its so fucking awesome..
---
No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania
---
Implying I know anyone who isn't Swampletics
---
Meanwhile there is a couple dozen posts asking who Swampletics is... 
---
The average KC for a drop is 17.4 according to the wiki if you kill all brothers.  42 is pretty unlucky, but not outrageous.
---
Hard.
---
Too bad real world trading is against the rules. I’d sell these for GP! 
---
That is the perfect opportunity for him to take your items. Do not do this.
---
Great Easter egg on the wiki browser with "dopamine" on the other tab! 
---
Why is hunter the bottleneck for ToB?
---
Oh my god look at all those dopamine colors.
---
Keep it in mind bud, and keep up the work You managed to sum it all up perfectly haha. 
---
No banking, no trading, but this time, I can't leave Morytania.
---
Just bad luck, keep at it. 
---
H
---
its ban if u use it lol 
---
The general consensus is rc over 77 &gt; agility &gt; rc under 77.
---
Yeah but they’re not in Morytania
---
Rellekka course is like 52k/hour instead of 55k/hour tryharding at seers, way comfier you probably click half the amount 
---
He's doing a moritanya locked ultimate iron man, and the videos are informative, exciting, and just entertaining as heck.
---
Please daddy yes
---
Definitely autism. Between my full job and not having responsibilities, it's definitely a mental deficiency.
---
Is it possible anyone of you can link me the wallpaper at the end?
---
Just in time for the third cape of the series, but this time from a different account. Incoming: SETTLED 2
---
All leading up to eventually taking on one of RuneScape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood.
---
How exactly would Jagex know unless you recorded it like he did here? Also is there any proof this is bannable, just for argument sake?
---
yes mate lets do it on the down low, my rsn is swampletics pm me lol
---
MEET SWAMPLETICS 
---
Welp, never mind then lol.
---
Carrying an anchor an being able to run
---
Would you be making figures at some point? Like figures of Dharok/Verac/etc?
---
Yeah I just don't want to. Not a fan of ZMI, and it feels kind of wasteful on my ironman. Particularly since I don't have a huge stockpile of pure ess right now. For now I've been basically making cosmics, natures, and laws as I need them, and that's about it. If I stockpile enough ess for 77 (from Gargoyles etc.), I'll probably just grind it out though.
---
If he dumped 107m flax into the market all at once surely it would drop.
---
I can't wait to get ragged in this yepyep
---
I’m not labeling it. I’m giving a opinion. I said my support for the series and that I will continue to support it throughout it. There is nothing wrong with that. If someone can’t handle any sort of criticism other then good then how will they ever know if they are truly getting everything right.
---
most these ppl like easy scape cuz they're pleb lol, they same ppl who laugh at rs3 for being piss easy
---
i dont know what makes that mid level content though? mid level content is content which mid levels can do, yknow, efficiently?
---
100 combat can do all content, including "end game content," that doesnt make all content mid level content.
---
Wasn’t shit in any way. Just different from what we’re used to.
---
This, please god. I bet 90% of the people making Swampletics posts don't even watch the video and are just cashing in on the easy reddit hivemind karma.
---
The bog thing with runelite is kinda a scary trick. its a grey area... unethical but at the same time he is right no different than a clue solver... i personally find it perfectly okay to do. 
---
I've always wanted a ranged tank, so that's what i've decided to make.
---
But what about other posts about swampletics
---
weergave hahaha
---
Yep his moss list is wrong. Needs Warlord and Moss Giant. 
---
Dude wasn't joking when he said dissertation, that bog and random event stuff took way more effort than my actual bachelors dissertation wtf 
---
If its a supposed to be a challenge then relegate them to higher tier clues. Its supposed to be a challenge not something almost equivalent to a pay lock in the game. Its not good balancing nor is it good game design. 
---
Your disposition towards a problem that doesn't directly effect you is the toxic element in this situation. It isn't ridiculous to acknowledge that a quarter of hard emote clues have unrealistic requirements when compared to the rest of the minigame. 
---
Imagine needing an abyssal whip to kill abyssal demons - that's the absurdity of the situation. 
---
make a 10 hp ironman gmaul rusher.
---
ironmen don't gain exp while pking so you can stay low combat and rush forever :).

Yeet

Wow, how have i not realised after all this time that bring/archers is a hammer and a arrow ontop etc...
---
Yeah, it seems pretty simple, just a plugin that highlights that specific tile ID, so your screen isn't flooded with purple squares.
---
For XP and points both, I believe hard is always better. The first setup you mentioned, king roald, kendal, count, warlord, and spirit is very good for melee training, just play it on hard.
---
i banked 3k slayer points for this update. I'm decently lucky getting tasks.
---
There is simply no way to ensure you won’t get scammed, unless you use RS3 bonds to simply buy yourself a lot of membership (of course this gets a bit silly if you have billions to transfer).
---
There are steps you can take however to minimize risk. First, don’t use any swaps you see bots spamming at the GE, that’s a great way to get scammed. I haven’t personally done any swaps because I don’t play RS3 but the people I know who have generally say that “Prop Swap” is the most legit one.
---
If you do have a bunch of gp to swap, I would probably recommend doing it over several transactions, instead of one lump sum. People are less likely to scam you for smaller amounts and even if they do at least you don’t lose everything.
---
Ok shit was a wrong term to use. Different in a sense that the things that have made me love the series just weren’t here in this episode.
---
1
---
When I was doing Dungeoneering like 10 years ago you would get a random every time you left the dungeon area after getting like 25k~ exp. I assume nothing has changed about how it works.
---
Its a 20% damage increase to bloat, pretty useful to have.
---
I think we’ve all been there XD
---
I never saw the sword on the warrior ring until recently. Beautiful designs though. 
---
That's actually pretty cool. If I ever stop playing OSRS long enough to get a job, I'll try viewing it the same way. Even if I don't get a new position, maximum efficiency is still something good to encourage, rather than just working like a zombie with no care.
---
Bandos is also ok now if you are maging. 
---
But yeah, Zammy is pretty aids and not that good rewards which is a shame since Justiciar is so good there. If Zammy was worth doing we would also have a use for Justiciar other than rune dragon botting. 
---
He literally used a client to highlight a puzzle and show the fking object ID of the puzzle blocks instead of solving it himself lol. How does that sound right or okay
---
Subscribe 
---
Don’t waste your time talking to him, he’s not worth it.
---
I busted out laughing when he discovered Runelites ground objects 
---
the wait is over bois. now the new wait begins
---
on release week people weren't bringing salves sometimes. yeah its a huge dmg boost for bloat but bloats also a free room anyway.
---
oakdice is legit i just did 
---
Ooh good thinking, if this is how it works.
---
The 0xymoron has a pretty chill cc
---
If I can make a tiny suggestion; it would be awesome if you put the ad breaks over the "chapter" titles instead of interrupting the video randomly!
---
Anyway, awesome video as always! I love hearing about the ethical conflicts you're facing now as you explore alternative methods of progressing through challenges like the bog.
---
nty i did with oakdice thanks anyway :P
---
It's not rude to label it as anything other than awesome, but the way it was worded in the title was. I personally liked the episode, as I'm doing research myself and love knowing more about game mechanics and things like that. However, the change in flow of this episode was definitely different, so I can see where OP was coming from. 
---
The dopamine rushes we all know and love were lackluster in this video, but the technical side was astonishing. 
---
You generally develop a feel for it when you play the game for a long time. This is public knowledge to a lot of players without them really "knowing" it's there.   
---
Just kinda something you got used to apart of being a broken game in many aspects. You see someone farcast you where you can't reach them, then you do it to someone else. Figure out how that angel works and see you can use it in numerous spots.   
---
I am partially upset it devalues kind of a natural sense of it, and anyone can do it. That being said I'm still going to use the plug-in and keep my mouth shut.   
---
I didn't say shit about the barrows mini map, or clue scroll solver. Not gonna complain here. If anything it helps people learn these mechanics exist in the first place. No one new is gonna find out 1tick prayer flicking is a thing on their own time.
---
agreeance is a word you daft cunt
---
breh 
---
is it not efficient for bowstrings?
---
People have been bottting for decades bro it's okay for you to bot nmz people have botted far worse things bru
---
D
---
given how much of his account is based around that idk what you expect.
---
he said he personally went  thru 44 bog random events. You want to see double-triple digit hours of temple trek on fast mode? no.
---
Nah. Once the first wave of people who got scammed into buying CLS got rapiers, everyone used rapier at bandos and zammy. Even more so after Torva was introduced. 
---
lol how is he gonna grab your ip?, and if your ip is constantly changing like most peoples are no information is reliable via websites you visited and got hacked with the same ip.
---
Be a bit sensible, you know full well a new player at lv100 would have no chance in Raids/Inferno which is end game content. And if you use the efficiency argument there is literally nothing a mid combat player can do more efficiently than a max main so there would be no “mid level” combat content whatsoever by that definition. 
---
GWD sits nicely between stuff like Mole/KBD and Raids/Inferno. 
---
Assuming you know what an Ironman/Ultimate Ironman is, he took an Ultimate Ironman and locked it in Morytania with a few exceptions (The required quests for Morytania, a sliver sickle mould, Druidic Ritual, Getting a House, Talking to King Roald for Darkness of Hallowvale, and buying a saw). The biggest draw of the series, aside from the very fresh set of content, is the high production value.
---
i don't think this changes anything, anyone can download their own version of the client and modify it (eg lyzrds is a big one right now that has a 'private' runelite)
---
Everyone is good at something. You just gotta experiment to find out. Same way Settled experimented in this video today. 
---
This is the quality post I come to this subreddit for. Have your upboat good sir :3 
---
edit: this.
---
Really surprised that "force spawning" randoms isn't common knowledge, I know a lot of people who used to do bankstanding skills and leave the bank every 25 mins to almost always get a random instantly on RS2. Same deal with doing NMZ in OSRS nearly always spawning a random event after you leave the dream after a while.
---
A bush sculpted into the Alchemical Hydra, the five-headed Dragonkin experiment!
---
There are still those people claiming it right now on OSRS Reddit LOL.
---
They could be more!  I hope there is to be honest. It adds a new dimension 
---
Nope sorry. Congrats on 5 almost 6 already wow slow down. 
---
People do it all the time with puzzle boxes on OSBuddy and RuneLite. The game gives you a puzzle and it's purely RNG on how long it takes you to get it down. Regardless of using the tool or not, the outcome is still the same, he still solves it. It just takes less time. I guess you could say it's an unfair advantage, but regardless of what client or tools you use you will always have disadvantages and advantages. Mobile and the Vanilla Client are exactly the same. The point being made here is it is merely an advantage, not a cheat. There are no bugs being abused, and not bottom involved. It is merely an advantage that doesn't harm anyone else's fun.
---
Ok I still go "1.. 2... 3" then move lol. Thinking/saying 4 is just throwing everything off at that boss, my brain cant process passed 3 
---
I agree, the force spawn of randoms wasnt what got me at first. But, Settled made an account to show people his commitment and the pain he has to go through to get one random. Is he doing it thr normal way? No, but he still isnt breaking rules by making it come every 40~mins. The bogs are another story, this is for xp books. Their should be a chance of a crappy part of tracking, that's the way it was designed. This is taking a code breaking it down and cheating. I'm a huge settled fan and I think he is bringing this to light to show people that this is here and is wondering if it really should be used.
---
I can see how it would be cheating. But for the sake of content. I see it as morally neutral! 
---
gee, thanks, gee :P
---
&gt;And if you use the efficiency argument there is literally nothing a mid combat player can do more efficiently than a max main so there would be no “mid level” combat content whatsoever by that definition.
---
there is plenty of content that is efficient at a mid level wtf are you talkin about
---
again, gwd is absolutely not mid level content in any way. bandos is the only one of the 4 that is *kinda* sorta mid level content but even then its so packed now you are competing more vs players than vs the actual boss.
---
if theres a way i can combat-only run through temple trekk and get agility tomes, you better believe i'd do that over grinding rooftops
---
Yea that was the skill I was thinking about. 
---
Been rushing my 99 wildy prayer before it becomes explicitly bannable. 
---
Send it to settled. 
---
Why is crystal bow accessible but arclight isn't? 
---
Plz
---
I bet he doesn’t use the bogs method, I think he knows it’s not right.  Probably felt really good tho to breeze thru them for a few rounds tho lmao
---
I died to black demons while I was on my phone. Damn I forgot how that rush felt lol 
---
Let us change the colour of the private chat on mobile - I'm not even colourdblind and I find it rather difficult to read the dim red text on the transparent background.
---
Thank you so much! I think the the closer my prints represent the ingame item, the better. 
---
I do paint them, and I’m experimenting with ways of making them more durable and “polished” looking. 
---
I’m not sure how much to charge. Making the models takes several hours, printing takes several hours, and the cost of materials. I’d like to find a price that’s fair and affordable to all the RuneScape nerds out there, but can still earn enough to make it sensible for me to pursue this business idea. 
---
Wish I would have thought of this possibility when I did UP and Regicide

luv that ur all 99s except 81 smith 81 rc 81 mining
---
True, so maybe 81 :p
---
you give 15 year olds way to little credit, even mentally ill ones. im telling you i was a very mentally ill 15 year old not long ago but i damn well knew right from wrong. if i went out and stabbed someone id expect full reprecussions even if i was being crazy at the time. 15 year olds absolutely have enough sense to know what theyre doing, the way grown adults forget that is fucking astounding. she doesnt even show remorse now when shes older, she still tries to defend the abhorrent actions of isis, she named her child after a jihadi warlord. the girl knows what shes about and shes lucid enough to make those descisions so shes lucid enough to accept the consequences
---
At least osbuddy could be referred to as the catchy nickname cheatbuddy. Has anyone come up with a decent one for runelite?
---
I agree with you that object id shouldnt be a big deal however Safespots in the inferno arnt auto marked automatically you have to mark them yourself which you could just do with vials (like everyone did prior to tile marking getting popular) 
---
Do you really just stay check everyone you come in to contact with lmao??
---
When I said 70-100k xp/h I meant more so just for a single barrage task with the type of barrage tasks determining if it's closer to 70k or 100k, though smoke devils can be way over 100k without any alts, and I think abby demons might be closer to 60k xp/h or something without alts (it's been a while since I finished 99 slayer, I just remember abby demons being a hassle to barrage and not being as good xp). Maintaining 70-100k xp/h long term is definitely very difficult, especially with all the skipping you'd have to do get only extremely high xp/h tasks, not to mention skipping stuff like hydra task which is only 35k xp/h with max gear, but I was thinking more like oh, you get a barrage task, and it's not like ah shit I can't afk, it's more like ah sweet I get insane xp rates for like 20 minutes, so the temporary high intensity of slayer is fine, while the way agility/rcing does intensity is just unenjoyable for most people.
---
How can I do this? I am currently playing a one chunck ironman and use the this show map,squares
---
By this logic jagex should step in and remove bog event for being the easiest puzzle to do with the plugin
---
In today's video we're going to see if we can't get gifted Gold by a random event... Only 21 golds needed till level 2, I estimate it will take 14 hours

---
Just wanna thank you for the inspiration to make a uim gala for only. Love you man. 
---
yeah I'm just a casual so I don't know much of these, was just saying it seems a bit silly if people are upset over this when there's TONS of things like this built into runelite
---
Poll this Jamflex
---
I have 94 fetching banked in dart tips. It's not too bad.
---
I dont think those are really comparable with the oject id thingy, nor do I think that just because those things exist he should be allowed to use that "feature". Its way too cheatsy.
---
Just wondering, is his maxed UIM series the "Road to Dream Gear" or is it something else?
---
Rooftop agility is very chill while watching a show and you've done it a thousand times already so you know where to click every 5 seconds. It would have to be better exp rates for anyone to do that instead.
---
I'd do zenytes next. Anguish, torture, then tormented. I'm not sure how important suffering is to get. If you've done DS2, the ferocious gloves are also a good upgrade to get before moving onto the top tier boots.
---
That 2 minutes saved would have changed everything
---
Not that much..? But it does look good!
---
Can't argue with that logic
---
It's a feature that works in say places like Barbarian Assault. You cannot play Barbarian Assault without Accept Aid. Accept Aid also allows you to be the recepient of a lot of various "helping" mechanics. So think stuff like Lunar's Potion Share or Healing, if the recipient has accept aid off you cannot use these effects on them. If you watch jaykkeousaiur(I am so sorry but he has too many odd letters in his name, idk the actual spelling) and his bossing with a noob series he uses these abilities quite a bit to trade his health for heals on his noobie.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Where the lures come in is Teleother is also grouped in with accept aid. So an example that isn't luring is say you are doing the Random Rune Altar(Ouirana? Idk spelling on this either) and you are using lunar's, I've accidentally clicked teleother lunar isle because when I made my batch of runes it allowed me to then cast every spell in the lunar spellbook(for the most part) so it shifted where I thought tele oirana was and instead had me teleother lunar isle.
---
I think I teleported 3 other people with me on that day by mistake, if more people had accept aid on I might have accidentally teleported 12-20+ people given how many people runecraft there.
---
If the current outlook on pvp brainlets was that they would know not to use crystal bow why are you assuming that they would not use this bow. Only the pvm nerds would give a shit. /s

I imagined for whatever reason you had finished your final and weren’t allowed to leave for whatever reason and in getting caught on your phone would void your test
---

---
Nah it is the original

Yes.

You're a different person than she is. I'd measure you against very different meter sticks than I would her. Obviously.
---
Trying to compare your mental illness to hers is apples and oranges. You coped. But the truth of the matter is you have NO idea what motivated her to make the decision.
---
She talks about a belief in God and religion. Who in her family brought her up to consider ISIS as heros. Who traumatized her enough to think stealing jewels and fleeing the country was preferable.
---
Have you thought about how maybe she doesn't mind beheaded soldiers because home was already so bad that she sees no difference?
---
The complete lack of empathy or questions in this case is the real horrifying thing to me.

77 downvotes wow this reddit sub sux 
---
0% chance its bannable but honestly it probably should be.
---
At least you’re making OP look just bad as you, you got that going for you
---
A lot of players are using that yet I find it more fun to play without.
---
Because rotating low resolution images by small amounts with some rotation approximation algorithms can cause blurry artefacting.

I would like to see what all the hype is about but my eye sight isn't good enough for it

Should have just said "I know you well, John." Or some other really common first name. On the off chance you were right you could've messed this guy up for life.
---
Try waiting on Berserk releases =( 
---
Harry Potter and the Chambers of Xeric
---
Yes.

I haven't played RuneScape in years but this is dope. This is the content that drives RuneScape. 
---
&gt;After 77 RC
---
Yeah nobody thinks rc is awful after 77, its getting to 77 that makes me want to die.
---
(thank god for zmi though. 100m for ~50-77 @ ~150k/hr xp)
---
Obscure up until today, sure, but you'd be insane to think zero J-mods follow Swampletics. If usage of this rises a lot, I can imagine an increased focus on stuff liket his.
---
Is that Maxmoefoe?
---
I enjoyed this, thanks.
---
Serves you right, boot licker. 
---
No, in all these examples the locations are predetermined, while the bog is random. 
---
Well thats 4 karma from me you piece of shit
---
Protip don't play runescape on fullscreen 
---
I'll upload a modified version that re-enables it, when they do.
---
Mods please delete
---
Than removing free trade and pvp
---
Idk if you’re trolling me or not😂
---
Attacked is capped lower than 75. Bow requires 70 and 50 agility. It'd be nice to have the option of a demon-bane effect in ranged or magic combat styles.
---
Its actually mildly entertaining lol
---
Hahaha I wish you good luck!
---
most overhyped shit i ever seen, its legit ironman in morytania, cool
---
agility is definitely more annoying to train but the benefits are far better than what you get from runecrafting.
---
Chaotic good. 
---
Thanks. I'll try that out
---
Will trade 4 food XD
---

Check this, do the math and you wi find it out.
---
Tile puzzle in clues are random too, yet runelite trivializes that, but that's beside the point, I'm saying that it's a grey line, these obviously aren't gamebreaking super mega advantageous bugs, there's tons of examples and if one has to go they all have to go
---
&gt;because you’ve gotta click every other second
---
???
---
Agility is at least 4 or 5 seconds between clicks that you don't actually have to pay attention to.
---
The unique drop would be pretty worthless. If the normal drops arent worth much, the unique needs to be worth something
---
Great advice.
---
Small changes, made daily, will outshine the most heroic feats.
---
Lmaooo same. I feel bad for killing Venezualians..
---
Try to ask if they’re people or bots.. and it is indeed a good place to practise. I make a solid 500k p/h killing bots there
---
That’s a bot. Edge is full of them.
---
Meet my morytania Locked ultimate ironman
---
I’ve been there. I know what torture feels like(not the amulet). I am happy to be there for you. &lt;3
---
I hardly ever, I just loaded up the client and it put me into full screen, I tried changing client size but my attempts were futile
---
The problem is you need to bank, drop runes(zmi), manage stamina, and do a lot of menu clicking for runecrafting.
---
PLEASE MAKE IT SO WHEN ONLY VIEWING CLAN CHAT, MESSAGES SENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO TO CLAN CHAT
---
As already implemented in Mobile, this would make it easier to talk with clan members without having to type a slash before every message
---
If it is not possible on the vanilla client, then it's cheating.
---
In this case it is literally impossible to do without using third party software to read the game's code.
---
11k grapes and we have a deal! :’-)
---
fuck in that case bro scrap all the prisons just let murderers and rapists run free because theyre obviously mega tapped to wanna fuck someones life up like that.   
---
fucking unbelievable.  
---
i cant sit here and try and argue with you because you arent understanding the simple fact that she chose to become a terrorist. in your eyes all the kids that were raised into jihadi monsters in syria shouldnt be shot like they do to others, they should be pampered and given a therapist.   
---
i dont know where you people get off trying to white knight for fucking scum like this, peace bro
---
I asked this before, but never got an answer. Is Anti PKing frowned upon in the PvP community? I absolutely despise normal PKing and Pkers, but I feel like Anti PKing is so much more rewarding and satisfying to do. You don't target people who are actually trying to do things in wildy, and you can actually make it just a fractionally safer place by dealing with those annoying Pkers.
---
wow and i got so fucking mad after 40 dry chests from barrows but reading all these comments ppl with 150+ damn..
---
Wonder if that would work for tob's maze aswell
---
I'm going to have to get on my grind to make this deal happen. I swear it'll be the best trade deal in history!
---
You had me at hidden poll results.
---
Actual unpopular opinion here: I dont think he should be allowed to use that feature. I dont think its comparable to the features you listed because of how much more impactful using that feature is nor do I think that would actually be reason enough to allow him to use it. Its just way too cheatsy. 
---
The biggest difference imo is that the bog isnt supposed to be premeditated as shown by the results of his testing. Using a plugin that does so and solves it is too much.
---
Is the Werewolf agility course worth doing over the highest level rooftop course post-60 agility if you don't have access to stamina potions?
---
It feels like I'm out of run energy the majority of the time at Werewolf which isn't an issue on the rooftop courses I've tried.
---
Also, and completely separately - how do you fletch a battlestaff? The info doesn't appear anywhere I google it, not the Wiki nor elsewhere, but it appears ingame.
---
First account?
---
I’m going to be a bit of a dissenting opinion here and say no, it really isn’t ethical to use. 
---
Here’s my reasoning for that: The bog is terrible, but it was designed to be terrible. There’s no skill involved, it’s just a crapshoot designed to extend the amount of time it takes to complete a trek. It’s pretty obvious that’s what it was meant to do.
---
The big comparison people are making is to runelite’s auto solving of clue slide games. There’s one big thing wrong with that comparison, and that is that the clue sliders are an actual skill gam that run elite just makes quicker. Theoretically someone on the vanilla client could solve the slider puzzles just as quickly as someone who uses runelite, it would just take an absurd level of skill in a fairly useless place.
---
That’s just not the case with the bog. It’d be a straight up cheat that no one on the vanilla client could utilize, no matter their skill level. Of course it’s in a really minor and annoying area, but it’s still completely avoiding a designed part of a mini game using knowledge the player shouldn’t have. IMO that’s unethical.
---
I love this! 
---
Armies of Gielinor. There's a remake being worked on, actually.
---
I only need 66 agility for all of my goals. I don't think I'll need more than that. At early levels, Runecrafting is *so* much worse. 
---
yeah i feel bad for the kid, i feel bad for the other two kids that died too, they didnt chose that shit. but theres not alot anyone can do about that now they just had to accept the consequences of their mothers shitty descisions. it baffles me that she could even chose to put her children through that and bring them into the world like that :/
---
lol? No. It's not. At all. You are only reading the data the client is already giving you. So unless Jagex installed a RAT on your computer to actually SEE what you are doing, then they don't know. They just see an ordinary player and an ordinary client playing the game.
---
this is by far the worst money method i've ever seen what the actual fuck
---
You are a god
---
Swampletics good!
---
This is blatantly cheating and should not be allowed. 
---
quality level = gold
---
RL is removing developer mode in the next update.
---
I thought you said Jewish player.
---
A little disappointed now.
---
He's been out for 12 years and kills/h and kills/trip has gone up by an insane amount since he was released to osrs. I think it's fien to just leave him be.
---
This good. +1
---
I agree. Won’t be doing it again 
---
Ohh. Yeah that's pretty much how it was. Was definitely worried about being caught. I was really committed to the tournament for some reason lol

Click [here](/message/compose?to=twitchy_the_bot&amp;subject=Twitch.tv+request+%2Fr%2F2007scape&amp;message=https://www.twitch.tv/dog_monk), then click "send" to get your stream added to the sidebar.
---
No. As far as I'm aware, they're not interested in doing that, right now.
---
I wouldn't be, he put his time in. It was what, a 1,000 hours of just f2p smithing grinding? Let alone the 3-4 thousand he probably put into maxing his main. He also wasn't always the most popular and liked to get in fights with the community, specifically about gating content he's already completed. No one likes the fun police and AutumnElegy was very much anti-fun if he deemed an update to devalue XP he had already gained.
---
A popular story here is how he vehemently was against shift click drop even though he used AutoHotKeys to do literally the same thing. It's like if Jagex polled to add some popular runelite features but your favourite streamer kept saying no on stream and twitter. You then watch his stream and he's using Runelite. So he benefits from it but when it's polled to go to the general population that's too much.
---
Basically he wanted an exclusive cake to show off how good he was at the game and then wanted it to where no one else could have the cake unless they grew their on wheat, made it into flour, raised their own chicken, slaughtered it, and make their own cake from scratch. Then you find out the fucker uses a pre-mix of Betty Crocker but insults you for doing the same.
---
I still have much respect for the dude, and I will gravitate to his content first if it's still applicable because he's a beast when it comes to OSRS, but the dude was his own worst enemy.
---
Bro my feather stack is worth more than 1m lol. Nice outfit, but it's not much to brag about.

Congrats Paul!

Swamp... *crowd murmurs in confusion* letics *uproarious applause*
---
I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying, I'm not saying he should use it, I'm just stating that it's hard to tell whether or not this should be allowed, as there's tons of other examples (big and small) that trivialize game content.
---
at the end of the day everyone is entitled to their opinions
---
You could zulrah with those stats as he is entirely mage/range/overhead prayer. Ideally 70+ prayer for the range/magic boost but with 99 mage and 90 range you should still manage 2-3 kills per bank run and manage about 2m P/hr
---
Here we go again ...
---
&gt;comments on video instead of watching the first 10 seconds of the video
---
Third party clients should have been banned a long time ago.
---
Thanks for the reply, I was not aware!
---
Shouldn’t have said anything about the developer mode. I think it will  be removed and you will lose the opportunity to save all that time
---
Cutting magics is far from the meta lol
---
IDK how jagex allows that shit. Probably because they use it on their personal account lol
---
&gt; Tile puzzle in clues are random too, yet runelite trivializes that, 
---
Once you have the tile puzzle, you are able to solve it without ever interacting with the client. All the information required to solve the puzzle event are given to the player. The bog event can only be done by trial and error. 
---
In this case the user is given access to information that he could not get in anyother way. That is clearly way beyond any of the other existing plugins. This is beyond a grey area and should simply not be allowed.
---
Nah, volcanic mine, turned mining from my least favorite skill to just grinding 88-99
---
I think this post is kind of....shit
---
Just to point out how close you are, OP says 9.8m below.
---
I didn't really explain well enough because I got tired of constantly moving text around, but this assumes the only other bosses are KQ/KBD.
---
&gt;Anti PKing
---
the thing about "anti pking" is it's just pking lmao. if you see people in the wildy you wanna fight then fight them. the whole point of the area is that if you see people in the right level range, you can attack them and they can attack you. 
---
Eh overlay is ugly as fuck
---
He chose to limit himself
---
King of the pirates, vampire only, clue scroll only and 2005 only have been fun
---
14 hours... not bad.
---
&gt;assuming Jagex doesn't squash this.
---
Sounds like engine work, no can do!
---
Ah that makes more sense. It could use more items on the normal drop table still. Doesnt need to be more valuable just more different drops imo
---
I am not sure if it has been asked but why when the willow tree model changed one stayed the ole model in Draynor?
---
Do horror from the deep and equip a god book, do mage arena and equip a god cape, buy wizard boots or mystic boots for the bonuses. 
---
Tele and respec
---
flair checks out
---
the wiki having wrong drop tables for tons of stuff in morytania is hilarious. bless Settled and others for actually figuring out these random ass tables
---
Rly?
---
Quality post. Thanks for sharing progress.
---
I ran upstairs and hid in my bathroom for 20 minutes to watch this. 
---
Ethical is irrelevant. 3rd party clients are allowed therefore anything that doesn't trigger bot detection is fair game.
---
This is fucking sick. Way more impressive than the Microsoft Paint wankbait people froth over.
---
Damn 3? Thats crazy and oh yea will definitely keep killing them haha.
---
Chaotic good
---
Was about to comment that i did that quest like 3 months ago and was like wow
---
It might be true now. EoC took almost all variety out of the tiers, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is still a slash bias on monster defenses like there is in OSRS. 
---
like honestly how the fuck are we supposed to be able to wait a WEEK for each episode
---
Can I just create a new lv 3 account to scout for raids?

Hes a cheating scrub

Shhhush, this is how we lose developer mode!

Unpopular opinion. Kril is easier than bandos.

If you hold space it skips dialogue with NPC's

in your opinion jar generator is faster than swapping random implings for jars?
---
I mean, he didn't abuse it. In fact he specifically said he wasn't going to use the method after discovering it. So I disagree with you there.
---
Interesting?
---
Runecraft bad
---
Couldn't express it better myself
---
I think just blocking the spell and preventing them from casting the spell on you for the duration you would have been cc’d is better. 
---
So can Terrorbirds in Tree gnome village
---
Brainlets always get a smirk from me at the very least. They're so fucking dumb and absurd.
---
You might have been thinking of the granite hammer? Maybe?
---
I’m sorry but no more useless content like this. Give us consistent money and more resources and alchables 
---
Brimhaven arena is interesting but dead content. I didn’t mind doing it for a while to get my graceful recolor. Is it cancer, possibly, but it was nice to do something else in the 350 hour grind for 99 that wasn’t rooftop
---
In this case, I think it's fine. It's getting around pretty dead content that is only used in niche scenarios like this. The content also does seem pretty unbalanced. Doubling, or tripling the length of a run with no other way around it is kinda bullshit. It's not a matter of skill, it's just a much longer challenge that, without this, you can't do anything about.
---
If it gets used somewhere else, like maybe the that dog boss in Theater of Blood where you have to step on the right tiles, then they it's pretty busted and should be removed or fixed.
---
I'm 78 and haven't tried zeah rcing yet either, I liked ZMI it's just the right amount of repetitive
---
Huh, I haven't watched any of these, figured it was just another random account series and wondered why it always did so well, I'm interested now
---
Np but are you content overall with OSRS? I honestly think it's Pre-EoC done mildly better although there still are issues with the game imo
---
it started off as road to dream gear, then he changed it to max later on.
---
What necklace are you using?
---
You Tele and grab dhcb
---
I'm wondering if you guys are open to the idea of world events similar to what was in RS2? Things like the Evil tree's that would spawn around the world and the falling mining stars? I'm curious to what the mods would think of this idea and what old school events they could bring into fruition? Thanks for your time.
---
I can't even tell what's low effort anymore. 
---
...This is fucking glorious, though.
---
Ty bud
---
Go to hell. The only way you can "make America great again" is by killing yourself.
---
Craft your slayer helm.
---
Surely he could list it for higher than market price and not crash it though?
---
One immediate concern: Tier 75 is really packed (I wish they'd move Tbow &amp; Blowpipe to T80). Wouldn't want to add more to T75. 
---
Craft your slayer helm
---
Agreed, noted gold ore x200 as common drop.
---
Do us a favor and withdraw 2 fire and law runes from your bank and teleport back home ya troll.
---
If you have nothing to bring to the discussion then leave it be. 
---
Just try and pvm any wildy boss and they will find you
---
tuesday should be changed to 'hopefulness'
---
88 or 89 is the last shortcut in-game to my knowledge, at least listed in the agility page in-game, and it's for a revenant cave shortcut.
---
For all intents and porpoises around 80 when you get access to the last shortcuts in taverly and brimhaven dungeon you're good to go. For me personally 76 is where a lot of my account builds stop progressing agility because after the Zulandra shortcut I don't really visit taverly/brimhaven/relekka enough to warrant grinding out 20-40 hours of agility just to save 30 seconds once a week.
---
**Time for A rant, don't read, and if you do understand I am not as salty as this might make me seem, I just don't like skills that take 150+ hours to get to just 90 that then require another 150 hours of questing and diary rewards. Anywho read on if you want;**
---
Agility as a whole seems kinda lame. The amazing shortcuts are gated behind arbitrary diaries, and then the skill itself prematurely dies off at 80sh when the game could have some dank af shortcuts scattered all around the place. No one wants lodestones or any of that RS3 trash but would people really be against making agility open up the map? 
---
Make the Varrock river shortcut require 18 agility and no diary. Why is the Al Kharid shortcut gated behind a diary, just make it mid 70's so if you spent the 40+ hours grinding it out you access it, it isn't like the glory teleport is that much faster then the ring of dueling teleport, especially because if your plan is to go there your likely heading to shanty pass anyway. The Twa Bwa Wainnai shortcut is like Hard or Elite diary for no reason. And so on.
---
Then for example half the shortcuts are either 100% pass or like 75% fail/25% pass. So at 76 agility I still fail the lumbridge swamp caves jump and have my oil lantern go out constantly on my UIM, like why the fuck am I failing that at 76 when I 100% can complete the lava stone jump in the Brimhaven Dungeon as soon as I have the requirement. 
---
Agility has no consistency as a skill outside of the rooftop courses and the base recharge rate on your run energy. You then compound the fact that half the skill is inaccessible without diaries you're just like why does this crap exist. Agility is a complete mess of ideology and it winds up being used for about a dozen prominent shortcuts and outside of that is only used for it's natural run energy restore.
---
Im definitely going to get downvoted for this but I think the object id thing really is going too far. It defeats the purpose if with every inconvenience you turn on a clients plugin to get rid of that inconvenience and imo it will devalue the grind a bit if you are to use it. The argument that there are similar plugins lile the object id thingy is also irrelevant to your situation since you probably wont use those anyways nor are they anywhere near as impactful as the object id "feature" that shaves off actual relevant time. A lot of people want you to use it simply because they like you and want to make the grind easier for you and I dont think many are rally thinking about whether its cheating or not.
---
If the bog had actual logic to it, similar to puzzle boxes and whatnot, then it wouldnt be as cheatsy. But since the bog isnt meant to be premeditated as shown by the results of your testing I think it crosses a line to have a client actually do so and play the game for you. It sucks how awful the bog is, but in all honesty that is part of the game and area you chose to limit yourself to.
---
It's a "season" so to speak. He has a full UIM playlist with 80 or so vids which is everything together.
---
Nah it doesnt work for PP
---
I too come from a poor developing country but we don't have the following that China has:  
---
1) One of the world's largest navies
---
2) One of the world's largest airforce
---
3) One of the world's largest armies
---
3) Ability to harness Nuclear Power for Energy and for Nuclear Deterrents
---
4) The world's largest economy
---
5) A decent infrastructure system
---
6) Capacity to manufacture their own appliance/electronics/cars/weapons
---
7) A space program
---
8) Flexing military might by building several Naval Ports and Military Airports on Islands they don't legally own
---
China is still very backwater in the rural areas away from the major bustling metropolitan areas but throwing around the term "Developing Country" to equate it as equal to a developing tiny island nation like mine is just not the same. It's classified as a newly industrialized country and an emerging market. It's already in-between developed and developing, same scenario that South Korea, Japan, Hongkong, and Taiwan were  50 years ago before gradually being considered a developed country.
---
That's not a bug, though. It's just information a player using the standard client would never see. 
---
I agree with you.. if GWD is not mid level content, then Zulrah Vork and team raids is definitely not mid level content.
---
Also i agree that 100-110 is mid level, I dont think he even realizes that 80 base combats is like level 90 something combat which is basically agreeing with you
---
Support if we also change oranges to orange Faygo.
---
"do the quests so you don't have to get b gloves but then get b gloves when you actually pk in wildy"
---
No the werewolf course isn’t worth doing, and you fletch a battlestaff by growing your own celastrus tree in the farming guild then chopping off a few branches, which you fletch into battlestaffs 
---
It's frustrating knowing you'll never see a real girl naked in your whole life... So they come here to yell.
---
Every body knows what, what I'm talkin bout
---
Hide polls and authenticator delay
---
I have 17m slayer xp. I still prefer konar.
---
I read that fishing karambwan is the fastest way to get the fishing pet if you're not doing tick manipulation, is this true?
---
The text is too small to see...
---
I know right, *that* was the comment to get me to watch it
---
idk why but my notifications can take an upwards of 12 hours sometimes... 
---
not sure about werewolf
---
you fletch a battlestaff with celastrus bark which is from the new tree in the farming guild
---
Good use of the meme, 10/10
---
This is what im trying to say to people but they wont listen!
---
yep
---
There is a 0% chance, sorry to hear man 
---
I was saying its a possibility if Jagex doesn't like it.
---
Please send A link to the osrs specific rules (no existent)
---
Now we need a meta post of this with OP added as a brainlet 
---
Very nice
---
Winds of Winter, anyone?
---
Funny because osb is actually a cheating client :s
---
Much better than pressing the arrow that is most likely smaller than these tabs 
---
He didn't say he wasnt gonna use it.
---
Agility is worse. I think abyss rc is pretty chill
---
Throw on some music or a stream and you’re good to go 
---
That would have been a big mood tbh
---
That’s probably what everyone said about artists and content creators who are millionaires now. Popularity can occur in the blink of an eye to anyone over any reason. Targeting a demographic with your content is just a safer bet for a more consistent following. There’s nothing wrong my with bandwagoning, especially if you stand to profit when you’d otherwise not. 
---
Making YouTube videos and making even a few cents per video is infinitely better than not making the videos and making nothing. Especially in a day and age where you can abuse an algorithm to force your content into the recommended boxes of people you’re targeting by using buzzwords in your video details. 
---
Sure, ironmeme content is saturated as fuck right now; but I can respect the grind and effort people put forward to make money as long as it’s not a pyramid scheme. 
---
Red herring. It's irrelevant whether or not the games have different rulesets, the discussion is about whether or not third party clients are "cheating".
---
Dude, this is funny as hell.
---
Hey /u/Spineweilder , I'm planning on killing potentially several thousand of the skeletons in Tarn's Lair for my own restricted iron purposes and was wondering is there a place for me to give my data to the wiki once I finish with my grind?
---
you'll prove it or i'll kill you
---
But muh daily herb boxes
---
lol
---
As an entity completely separate from your discussion, I'm just here to point out that both games share the same ToS and rules.
---
Your right by the way, lets them raise cb levels while I buy a Regen brace if I ever want that same +1 str boost
---
nah i sold mine, pls keep it iron full helm stats 
---
["I'll need a little bit more time before I decide to use this."](https://youtu.be/iuJRi9_mplM?t=581)
---
Are you using runelite, you could tag the healers so you can see them more clearly.
---
Not sure if this’ll help you or not, or if you’ll even see it, but when I was a noob training in the security stronghold, I’d get a random every 30 minutes if I buried a bone. 0 randoms happened, for hours even, and then I’d bury a bone and get one, every single time. 
---
Good luck. 
---
You can sell anything osrs related, but if you make enough money they might hit you with a cease and desist, and if you don't stop they could have you sued. However, stuff like this is sold all the time and they can't do much about it unless you're making a lot 
---
Yeah they said in a q&amp;a and dismissed fixing it due to it being out so long
---
Lol yeah, for 15 seconds you can
---
I've just banged out 1-70 agility on my pure and forgot how bad it was (60-70 is 10.5 hours alone if playing truly efficiently), esp training on the main at the same time. I'm at the point where I have no clue how I managed to get 80 on my main, I gave up doing fletching/aching while training this shit skill, also how is this a skill? People say firemaking makes no sense but at least it's a lot better to train then running on roof tops for hours on end.  OP your opinion is valid take my up vote. 
---
can 99 rc pay for 99 con and herb? or prayer? or any 2 big money sinks? 
---
Is the detached camera plugin still going to be available? It would be nice to have considering the Oculus orb still isn't publicly available.
---
you do realize behemoths give a guaranteed full spice of any color
---
what the fuck is this 
---
Fair price would be eleven american dollarydoos
---
Nice
---
How the fuck this have any upvotes when the 10k Bandos book offers +2 str at any level as a shield, slayer helm offers +0 str bonus, Addy gloves=Regen brace. Your getting +1 str from Addy gloves unless you want to bring Regen as a protected item which gives 0 extra strength bonus between max pure gear for str and max 13 def gear for str
---
I mean, 6 chests isn't very many. As with every bossing related thing in RS you are playing against the odds. So the odds that you would get a barrows piece at 1/6 is pretty much not gonna happen, statistically speaking. The hard diary can help reduce some of the pain in the long run via increased runes.
---
i fear that he will get a bug abuse ban (possibly a temporary ban) for figuring that stuff out with the random events.
---
I play a lot of mobile and the biggest problem I have is missclicking things on my UI. It would be really cool if you could enlarge certain areas like your inventory/spells/prayer etc. enchanting or alching full inventories is a nightmare on smaller devices.  
---
My life peaked watching this in the shower.
---
I thought he was talking about player “X”
---
Because addy gloves are cheap as fuck and good. Black defender also gives the same melee attack bonus as Zammy book and same str bonus as bandos bookf
---
I received my record breaking downvote of 300 for standing up for rot among people who just bandwagon for sake of bandwagon.
---
What have you got? 
---
A mouth to blow settled’s tiny cock?
---
"But first, let's talk about parallel instances"
---
Just for asking nicely captain douche.
---
Cool man
---
I brought constructive feedback. It's not a problem to have value for clue items. Troll.
---
51kc dry at raids1 averaging 20-26k points per 3 man raid. Am I unlucky or what...
---
It would be awesome if there was an option to fill the coal bag from your bank while the bank interface was open, kind of like a rune pouch. There's an empty option right now, but not a fill for when you're smelting bars.
---
You’re being downvoted but you’re right lol 90% of the series are dog shit
---
Great meme format; you are just missing some iconic Swampletics images in the frames.
---
cuz fox is sick bro
---
By "them" I meant Jagex, not the Runelite devs.
---
People still play rs3?
---
FIX THE DAMN CC GLITCH
---
"remove the wilderness at we can take advantage of safely Skilling there"
---
What makes them think that even if pvp was removed, wilderness activities wouldn't be rebalanced to fit a less risky environment lol
---
Oof, wonder how I mistyped that particular stat. Anyway, I rechecked the stats and fixed it. Thanks.
---
Just fixed it. 
---
A streamer must have casually mentioned it
---
Tentacle whip, you add a kraken tentacle to the regular abyssal whip and it consumes the whip, giving a tentacle whip with 10,000 charges and slightly better stats. After 10,000 attacks, it degrades and you're left with just the tentacle (meaning you need another whip)
---
honestly they should just change the bog if they consider the bug that big of a problem. This series shines a light on a super outdated minigame mechanic.
---
I cant wait too get some glorious booty in runescape, its about time
---
I think so personally
---
Prayer bonus is also helpful. 
---
Greatest bettlejuicing lmao
---
Moreover, what song is that??
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
Examine texts have been "a chair" tier in general lately for most small pieces of new content.
---
A shame since they were often really good before
---
Is this true with atk/str 50 vs 87 range?
---
You seem to dislike reddit, how bout your dumbass stops logging in
---
Russia (or the USSR) never put a human on the moon, though.
---
Thanks. I hadn't heard of 2005 only or vampire only. Subbed to the others already haha
---
think of it as double xp/hr, its a big deal. Imagine if you found a way to train agility at 100k xp/hp, that would be huge.
---
You're going to need darts for blowpipe so just make darts. That's what I did and it was tedious but payed off when I got blowpipe and was ready to use it right away 
---
As of this release, no it will not be available on the release client
---
I killed a ton of the mobs in tarns lair during the first DMM. Almost every single drop table on them is either lacking or wrong for mobs there. Tons of alchables and the like inside of there that arent on the drop table, as well as some potions i believe.
---
Kril is probably the coolest looking and the best pet from god
---
Exactly what I thought 
---
Just so we're on the same page - be aware that this isn't some breakthrough. It is interesting that this works it trekking, since there are ways jagex already deal with it (ie. the change to farming to only show local patch states client-side)
---
A lot of old content is this simple to 'cheat' though. The tile you have to pick up in the Rogue minigame is another example where you need a specific item, and it happens to visually have another id so you can tell which one it is
---
&gt; Nobody I know uses FBI. 
---
Who else am I supposed to report crimes to?

If I were him I would've kept it a secret tbh lol but it's dope content and cool to know

Watch SettledRS last video
---
You don't need an account to edit pages save high-traffic pages, but if you edit without an account your IP address will be shown, so we usually recommend creating an account.
---
Popular opinion begs to differ dearest money, but that was some quality edge.
---
No account needed! The wiki wouldn't be half as good if it weren't for thousands of people like you editing this kind of info.
---
Thanks for the suggestions. Loving Rargh so far. I'm not a big fan of pking vids but I do watch torvesta and framed on occasion
---
Swamp man good 
---
Ferocious gloves before prims? Just curious what ferocious price is as well! I assume ge doesnt reflect real price yet. 
---
To add onto this, in the past they tried changing item/npc ids a few times and there were mass bans but then the bots were fixed to update their ids also after each time.
---
Just did it. You for sure have to pay more attention than usual rooftop because the stick ends up in like 1 of 3 or 4 spots every lap but you can still crush Netflix or something
---
Mashallah
---
I’ve failed jad twice and gotten a 100 kc at Rex.

Same interface not updating, i'm sure player weight is actually being applied tho.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. That first video worried me but the quality definitely improved.
---
I haven’t played this game in 10 years, I’m bout to fire it up these videos are really interesting, love it.
---
*Boaty 10 years from now levelling up his 9th hcim*
---
completely agree
---
this series shines a light on a lot of the morytania area being under developed and lazily coded 
---
That ties in with his examples of standing in a similar place, stronghold of security and gaining xp, burying bones. 
---
I don't usually swing by this sub, got a link explaining the runelite drama?
---
(I am familiar with the game to an extent though, like what runelite is)

No one is getting bullied for not doing the pledge of allegiance lol
---
sure, and theyre still tough af, end game content for sure.
---
Barrows, Zulrah, Vorkath
---
Yah, it was something like that; couldn't remember the specifics. K'ril probably doesn't need to be easier, but I think a mechanic like that which rewards you for keeping track and switching prayer at right time would be nice.
---
Nice! Are they for sale yet ?
---
I checked Hans for the first time on my account. The number no where near rival others but let’s say the account was made 2670ish days ago. And I had never checked it until just a few days ago. ☹️

Pk in f2p on a new account in Varrock wild
---
Go and watch the old wildependent series, wilderness only ironman back in the early days. I think maybe even before official ironman was released, been a long while since I watched them.
---
Especially from a class act like this.
---
Btw man mode 
---
Best series on ytube rn. Others that have similar series going just don’t have that same feel. It’s mainly in the editing. 
---
i was under the impression runescape classic was around in 1999/2000?
---
I'm no where near even completing the game on my main... do you think I still should give it a try? Haha
---
Jagex support bad
---
Swamp man good
---
Haha sounds fun! But what about on my main?
---
best-looking weapon in the game 
---
Pvp is dead on rs3 so it wouldn't make a difference anyway. 
---
Your whole bank?

Please remove the Feral Vampyre around the Port Phasmatys farming allotment area. One of the biggest pains to me doing farming runs as a lower level.

---
I’ve attempted chair and rope on several occasions on my grind to 77rc. Currently made it to 60 and fear I may never see 61. I get around 8k xp at zmi and I’m going to the closest to get the goods. How does one go through the struggle to 77. 
---
😫🔫
---
no way, thanks to his series. I'm never mining another ess as a btw. Such an annoying problem solved at such an accessible level
---
This meme was so innocent and cute
---
Are mahogany tables worth the money over oak larders and oak dungeon doors? it’s almost 2 times as expensive, but faster xp. (going for 83 cons)
---
I say go for it, I didn’t max on my normie and I’ve enjoyed ironman mode so much more since starting it. If you don’t like it after a month, switch back 
---
Get Gud
---
Yikes idk because I haven’t played really in two weeks because I got bored 
---
Fucking beast man! Do you have a specific set up per kind of clue you do?
---
Mining worst skill entire game change my mind.
---
already happened
---
im about to take on the dragon in dragon slayer, but im in adamant armor, wish me luck
---
Not at all
---
Good luck, Love you.
---
i find it funny when all of sudden people started makeing x place only ironman after the og settled did it first smh
---
Which I watched in 2 days because I'm now addicted to Settled
---
Statistically challenged, ditter, chunk and avrah have been pretty good lately in addition to the ones you have 
---
It's not the same as those things.
---
Also, it is how the game is. There's plenty of things in this game that double exp rates. that doesn't necessarily make it bad.
---
Nothing new to see here. Been like this since the release of OSRS, it's an ongoing issue.
---
What a strange thing for Jagex to do, but sounds like you guys deal with that almost daily based on the comments. 
---
Thanks
---
How do I add tags like humor or achievements 
---
Cool accomplishment man, gz
---
Wtf Woox is quitting?!?!?!
---
I finished it at 1986 btw decided to share now lol
---
On to easy hard elite and master?
---
Back in early 2006 I spent about a month at barrows doing using the poison and safespot method for kills. I’m guessing I did around 150-250 runs at this point before getting my first item which was an AH hood. Very next run Spear. It’s still one of my most cherished rs memories. 
---
spoilers
---
!!! This is like Woox breaking the game over his knee but in a whole new way. Can Jagex hire you for, well, anything?
---
Ty m8 next one on list is easy got like 400 to go for spade at least easy clue have alot more items that are worth something 
---
Herblore is fine how it is. It has always been an expensive skill
---
Yep hard elite and masters will be a nightmare probably years that's if am lucky
---
Look at mr doesn't pay glough over here
---
I've been playing for over a decade and I can attest to a time when making prayer potions was an amazing money maker.  There have always been expensive training options, it's certainly not always been the case that every single training method across the board costs you hundreds of thousands of gp/hr.
---
Currently cleaning specimens in varrock museum to get the clean necklace, wiki says drop rate is 1/51 but I've cleaned well over 500 now and still nothing, what drop did you get yours on? 
---
Good luck then man! Can't wait to see the completed easy log too
---
just take brews
---
"Dodge-rolling is the most efficient method of transportation, we can save hundreds of man hours"
---
And you too. If you ever want another friend online, I'm poimayes
---
&gt;but when it comes to Settled being able to bypass an intended event just to save sometime it's fine
---
Or when they themselves use the client for literally everything else that makes the game far easier lol
---
It's been the community's biggest point of hypocrisy since near the game's release honestly
---
Nice and you only had to piss away 5000 hours of your free time....
---
\&gt;serp helm. 
---
Downvoted
---
jk. congrats
---
I have also been playing for a decade and herblore is definitely a money sink. The only time a level 38 potion has ever been amazing money is when the scroll of cleansing came out on rs3
---
No
---
SWAMPLETICS!!!!
---
False.
---
I love you.
---
25 meds an hour. 80 hours 4 this ;)
---
Farm runs, buy staffs, miscellania, bird house runs
---
Yeah but experienced clue scrollers can solve all steps of a clue as fast as someone using Runelite. This method of speeding up the bog can not be done as fast in the vanilla client
---
Ironman. It's more rewarding unlocking and achieving new goals. Although Runecrafting is the most difficult skill to level early on as there is a lack of essence unless you mine it.
---
brb suiciding
---
hmm. Nah
---
If an ironman bots and doesn’t drop trade to a main, did it matter?
---
Anything settled does with this account will have 0 to very little effect on anyone else. There is no moral high ground to stand on when it comes to this. So take the low ground and admit that sometimes bullshit that can be skipped should be skipped.
---
Every time I lose, I think how that allows me to play this game longer. I then do skilling and try different methods of training that actually might be enjoyable even if it isn't efficient.
---
99 isn't about being a pro lol.. It's literally all about how much time you're willing to spend 
---
Herbs
---
you forgot "just got my first fire cape, so happy with has been a dream of mine since i was a kid"
---
“Cheat” ? Really? Did he hack the game to change his player coordinates to across the bog? No, he saw information about the game that the server presents to the client. The same information anyone with runelite can see.

Why would you ever do that though. God bless u impatient mother fucker
---
Remove the examine option for the items on the furniture creation menu on mobile. Reduces the number of actions to create furniture from 4 to 3 while in 1 tap mode. The examine text is unnecessary as is since it just returns the name of the object.

These are the perfect diameter for my skinny peen. Id love to use the blue one to go berserk while I crank my dinger
---
Ah yeah, latency issues make a lot of sense now that you mention it, it would certainly explain why I don't remember seeing anyone doing it back in those days, if not many people had stable enough internet for it to be worth the bother.
---
Exactly. I don't blame him.
---
Because both the game code and the client code need access to the tile id's requiring it to be an exposed feature. Programming dictates that if you want to use it outside of whatever its scope may be you have to expose it. Just because runelite makes it easy to see does not mean you can't go grab the same id's from the default client, because they're exposed there as well.  
---
Also going to add since someone's going to say it "why dont they obfuscate or encrypt the id's". Which should be pretty obvious since the hash for the same tile will be the same and therefore solve nothing. Encrypted data is still public.
---
I'll plan to reupload this later with a slightly different or sarcastic twist to it a couple hours later for a fourth of the karma
---
Send me your diameter and I can custom fit you one! PM me if you’d like to keep it anonymous. 
---
my slayer is 35. Been working on it since last week
---
Depends on what you use it for. It's useless for Slayer but definitely get it before Prims if you want use them for bossing.
---
Haha I kinda have the same story.  I actually majored in industrial engineering partially as a result of that same thinking and I'm working as a process engineer now.
---
Could be the Volcanic or Frozen Whip which are just regular whips with a cosmetic attached.
---
Right, but you have to expect the griefers to be there. To not expect them is foolish.
---
Eeeeeehhhhhh... I have a couple IRL friends I would want to do it with but one I wouldnt trust not to cheat the mode XD
---
I have nothing to hide? I just wanted to share what happened to my account. I feel like I am a victim since I did all the right things. 
---
What do you mean the old wiki?
---
You fletch a battlestaff from celatsrus bark, which is obtained by growing a celastrus tree
---
I wouldn't consider it cheating 
---
Trading with Robin for morytania diary should be able to use noted bones (and get noted items)
---
everything but spec.
---
1 - yes it is. these tile IDs are SUPPOSED to be hidden, there should be no way to automatically no the solution without manually testing it.
---
2 - implying that puzzle solver isnt broken as fuck and basically cheating anyway
---
Hmmm I agree with that, thanks for the info! How does 27 hunter unlock salve? Can’t he get that through tarns lair which he already completed? 
---
correct, they recently added it there
---
It's not a meme dipshit
---
all the energy from the destroyed rune gets focused into the spell cast.
---
Someone should make a plugin that highlights the firm swamp tiles for Settled if dev mode is going to be removed. 
---
I want to change the world...
---
Me too
---
Swamp Lizards are 29
---
He wants 27 to catch baby implings which can give a ball of wool.
---
Never thought I would be one of them but I started a fresh Ironman last week and haven't touched my main except for afk mining since.  It's a blast to collect stuff for quests and come up with plans to build your account.
---
Support 
---
Gz now get a champions cape &gt;8D
---
Honestly. I dont mind mining anymore. Once u unlock upper floor mlm. Is sooo much better. Mines depleting on time rather than ore mined is game changing. Also, its super close to the bag for dumping. 
---
Idk about kbd but id definitely like a friend too
---
ds2 is really fucking easy my dude.
---
I see three this hurts my eyes
---
Barb fishing is beautiful on mobile.
---
Yes it is really cheap and stable in price. 
---
It is also a really good upgrade over snakeskin
---
Solo only works well if you use chins.
---
“People who play a different game want different things out of their game than I want out of mine. Must be a dead game”
---
Why does he need 27 hunter? 
---
Accessing information that is meant to be kept hidden from the player. I can see how that would be considered cheating.
---
I would sell that mac and buy a pc
---
Used to be possible in classic. Tho you couldn’t go very far since the map didn’t load any further 
---
Omg this comment just made me quit rs 
---
There is an event in the temple trekking minigame called bog. You have to cross the mud pit one tile at a time. You check the tiles before walking across and it's a slow animation and entirely random low long it takes because the path is random.  
---
  
---
If you enable developer mode on runelite, you can display the tile id for different squares on the ground. The correct path and incorrect path across the mud pit have different ids. So if you just go by the new information you have, you don't have to check tiles to find the path, you just immediately know where to cross.  
---
Is this cheating? Absolutely. It's giving the player more information about a task than they should have, and remove the "game" out of it.  
---
Is this the same as using a puzzle box or light box solver? No. There is no additional info to help solve it given to the player doing this. It just speeds it up. (I still think you should learn to solve them manually it can be fun).  
---
Should you care? Specifically for temple trekking, probably not. There is minimal thought required to solve the bog event it's just trial and error adding a forced timesink to your trek. The issue is whether the same principle of pulling hidden information and giving it to the player can be applied to other things ingame, and the consequences of that.
---
Honestly, if people actually did temple trekking this would probably already be a Runelite plugin.
---
In this case yes -- don't try it with big corporations.

Why are they useless for slayer?

Well I mean that’s a pretty hefty con. 99 crafting Cape is mainly for the bank, why would a diary be worth more than a 99? 
---
Yes
---
Just post your 3d models so we can print them ourselves
---
Was referring to how each player has a pre-determined path through the entire maze / dungeon, not that one obstacle.
---
It's fine, they are going to down-vote us even if they know we are right or not :) They want to believe Justiciar is good so maybe they can one day get an infernal cape. Anybody trying to tell them to actually learn how the game works and improve must be brain-dead right? 
---
Play ur main like ironman. Need food? Go fish and cook it yourself etc
---
There is still an ideal spot to click, which is the same as before.
---
The bug where you could interact with the zipline before you even climbed up that slope has been fixed.
---
But life is just a game..
---
Dude... people have been making area locked ironmen for a long ass time.... get your head out of your ass.
---
It’s been maybe close to 2 years since I’ve done that quest, but I remember there being paths that you’re clearly supposed to walk on, but also it makes you chose a path at some point? Even though they’re paths to walk on, one of the paths will be incorrect or something?

Are ranarr prices dropping because of farming contracts?

Welcome to the club buddy
---
Don't look at people with 99's and think "man they're good at the game". Without exception it just means they had a lot of time on their hands and decided to spend it on skilling, or they were persistent over a long period of time in doing very low effort content and eventually got their way to 99. And it's totally reasonable to not want to do either of those, because most people don't really have the time to grind a 99 or aren't happy "afking" on a device while they do other things. 
---
I'm not trashing people who are happy to put in the time for 99's here either, even though it may read like that. I have personally spent more time on this game than I'll ever be happy to admit and I've got myself a few 99's, and it's because I spent time playing that should have gone towards study in college or doubled up on study and AFK skills. But I'd never value that very highly. 
---
Puzzle boxes can be solved just by looking at them, without touching the client at all. If you practice and understand the methods used you can learn to solve them very quickly. The puzzle received is RNG but the solution isn't. It's practice.
---
The bog is not meant to be solved through practice or memorization, it's meant to be solved through trial and error. The lack of information given to the player, which is intended to remain hidden, implies that.
---
It's not about advantages or disadvantages between players, it's about accessing information meant to remain hidden in order to trivialize content.
---
@everyone
---
Cool you got 600k
---
If you want to explain how we can access this "feature" without analyzing a text log then go right ahead. Until then you can drop the arrogance because you're just parroting the same bullshit I've called you out on.

If you can make more than the extra money spent in the time saved then yes. Depends how much money you can make per hour on average.
---
I shouldn't have to explain why reading game files/packet data to gain information you wouldn't otherwise have as a player is cheating/unethical.
---
Wtf are lodestones 
---
I fell victim to this scheme many many years ago. 
---
This is the guide i used, just maxed recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0huAx4pGSk

It's geared towards being the most afk (1 click every 20 minutes) by using normal rumble with absorption so absorb runs down super slow.  
---
Nah, look at his post history. It's just a spammer
---
If that happens to you though just open skill guide fast so you have interface doing 2 things : 1: blocking the poison damage and 2: letting you heal so that you can get runes to teleport to varrock and then ge.

pretty positive they could do something for directly copying their assets, unlikely they will, but its similar to how Nintendo makes sure to destroy every 3rd party pokemon game immediately, despite them usually having an entirely new roster of pokemon with unique sprites, etc etc. Remember pokemon uranium?

---
so you can dump what you farm from the allotment right away instead of doing it separately or needing extra tele's. Honestly though it probably shouldn't just because it's a good gold sink. Seeds are pricey for the cost of snape grass and aren't as useful but yield better experience.

how does one do this

I probably have 52 str irl even without going to gym

Did you do any werewolf agility? I’ve never tried but been curious bout it
---
You really don't need to protect him that hard, he gets the attentiono..
---
Hey retard you know that wouldn't work in this situation right. He had to have his mouse on right click to show us who he just spotted. Only way he could screenshot was with function keys on his keyboard 
---
/r/cutenoobs
---
I am introducing new tech for you guys - a real high definition table lamp 
---
Yeah, and I mean that you have the thing that shows what you can do at lvls not the have thing open where you can see total lvl and all of your skill levels. 
---
It gave me Autism.
---
Pest control in my opinion. You can complete it without fighting anything and use the points for xp. Not incredibly fast but a sure fire method
---
How OP manages to take a picture of his phone with his own phone blows my mind
---
Looks like he's sitting in the basket grinding while his GF pushes him around
---
This
---
His fame has literally nothing to do with boaty.
---
jajaja
---
Then why is it okay for the chances to be increased at 15x at 200M? Either buff it post 99 or just make it the same flat rate regardless of exp lmao
---
Thanks for the honest comment, appreciate it :)
---
Why would you pay him? Easy puzzle.
---
I think part of it does, Reddit wasn’t swamped with Swampletics until after his endorsement and discussion of it. 
---
Is it really surprising he quit as he reached 100 million xp in rc doing exclusively lavas. I’ll admit, I quite enjoyed my journey to 86 rc doing lavas the AutumnElegy way for Karamja elite diary. But I couldn’t imagine doing it to 99 rc let alone 100m xp.
---
Why tf you using a dfs at sire is the question
---
Forgot a few
---
&gt;RC slow  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Agi slow  
---
&gt;PK good  
---
&gt;PvM bad  
---
&gt;Zulra good  
---
&gt;Zulra hard  
---
&gt;Slayr only munimakr  
---
&gt;here's drawin jee-ef make giv moni
---
&gt;Either buff it post 99 or just make it the same flat rate regardless of exp lmao
---
it shouldn't be increase at 200m, you are correct. But its a relatively tiny change so its not a big deal
---
whether it was intentional or not, using the RL dev tools does essentially render the entire point of the bog useless since it requires no use of the sticks to click on a tile ID, even as an arguement that it's point is thematic and not balanced well it still renders the theme useless since the player character is not supposed to have this knowledge. 
---
Oh I’ve played about 10 minutes of RS3, but there’s one right next to the spawn (which was moved to the Catherby area, for some reason), so that’s how I know. OS all the way
---
Someone please shut that store off
---
Gz, now gamble it
---
i think it would be good. Cbow is really decent but bpipe is just too good. If we add charges it woulf be perfect since you alrdy run out of charges crazy fast using arclight.
---
Have you spoken to Oziach?
---
- Wrong font
---
It works, did MM1 last week.
---
Finally a non-Swampletics post. Good shit.
---
Nice game, Blizzard
---
It’s more than barb for sure. I believe kempq did some training there for his 10hp pure if u want to do research on that
---
You sound insecure/like you have more experience with gyms on tv and stuff. Irl people are there to work on themselves, they have better things to do than judge you
---
Kempq? I will give him a search. Thanks
---
Pretty sure they boycotted it and no one else can become a p mod, but not sure
---
Grats!
---
Jagex could fix this by declaring 3rd party programs that have options like this illegal.
---
Infernal cape&gt; fire cape
---
mimi*
---
If jagex chooses you, you become one
---
Fucking hate when that happens.
---
For fuck sake. I came back to this game to try my hardest to become one. What the fuck
---
Hire IQ points
---
What in the world is this fuckery?
---
Can I apply to be one? Idk if Jagex has that type of thing.
---
Agreed. Fucking fanboys are getting to my nerves quickly..
---
be a streamer
---
You can Max in one month with the best methods, so you can definitely get the cape but it's pretty hard without a money account to feed on and some dedication.
---
Holy shit haven't laughed this hard in months.
---
&gt;And get like 20k slayer exp per hour
---
So it's 20 times faster than agility/RC, I guess.
---
The Aztec gods of fitness are coming
---
I feel like you're splitting a hair so fine it's almost pointless. He could do the swamp legit it would just take much longer.  Same deal with puzzle boxes. I'm quite good at them but you can literally solve them in 5 seconds with a plugin. 
---
my mistake
---
Really?
---
Yeah
---
The meta for budget range training is Rune Knives now instead of MSB (i) because of how cheap Dragon Knives made Rune Knives.
---
How come Ive only profited on my med? Ive got 8k zulrah Kc and 500~ chambers kc. Pking is profitable if youre not a total shitter. Supplies are cheap af nowdays anyways. 
---
So fucking true. Take my upvote.
---
why do you want to become one?
---
Dunno, being able to afk for 10 minutes at a time already makes it far more bearable than RC/agility. Getting new tasks isn't an issue unless you don't extend your tasks or use low level masters.
---
There's a reason why Slayer has 3x the amount of 99s that Agility or RC have.
---
I'm not sure about comparing it to other fish, but a lot of people get the fishing pet from the Fishing Trawler minigame, so that might be a good option for you. The only downside is you have to do the Fishing Trawler minigame :P
---
Think they said they'd be down for offering it at a later date, but it'd add significantly more time to implement. So they'd much rather give us the basic implementation first and then poll that at a later date.
---
Honestly they suck I tried a couple of them and spent more on all the seeds then what they give.
---
AKSHUALLY you have to spend like 4+ mill an hour to hit EHP i.e. you'd be mental to do it.
---
BUT, are you an ironman?
---
I binge watched all of them a few days ago. Its worth it though! :D
---
You're not tackling a problem. Training methods for Agility at 85+ aren't a problem.
---
Agility Methods GETTING to 85 are tedious and not fun. 85 (90) is where Agility starts to get easier.
---
I don't like this, mid level agility needs some attention, our best option is to do the same course from 60 to 90
---
Yes, but no user can instantly see every single step to take to get to the solution. It's a puzzle, it's designed to test your brain in some capacity not just click the arrows
---
I was sitting at 16 marks per hour at Seers. That's 180k an hour. Ardougne course at level 90 is even more marks.
---
His point is that puzzle boxes are about skill, and the bog is about luck. One can be improved, the other can't. 
---
Id say yes. Because youre constantly fighting other players for kills and revs regen hp, high dps is crucial. Be the guy who has others helping you get kills, not the other way around
---
I rarely get pk’d camping the south monsters in sub30 wildy with a 1 click tele. I usually die because i get cocky and try to finish off a kill with pkers near
---
Not anime.
---
Any tips for Jad? I was listening to the sound effects for the magic and ranged attacks and found them to be quite similar, actually. I can definitely hear a difference but I'm not sure I can accurately recognize that, especially when there are also other sounds.
---
I didn't try him yet so I have no clue how long the window of oppertunity for switching prayers is.

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 UPSIDE DOWN 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Start doing birdhouse and farm runs.
---
It will take a while to get used to but once you are in a rythm you will get a lot of passive exp (yay easy gains!) and money from it.
---
Use the herbs you get to boost your herblore.
---
I get that. But no one is ever going to complete a puzzle box faster than the plugin. There is an upper limit to everything. In both of these cases they could be solved with time but both use third party plugins to make it more efficient. The skill vs luck thing is just semantics.

For someone who is just used to clicking an ore node and reaping a result, this skill sounds complicated... But I appreciate your reply very much!
---
2spooky4me
---
Hi mate, what's a birdhouse run?
---
The problem with contracts is you getting way to much mid level seeds like papaya pineapples maples willows calq etc....
---
Thats devalue the skiill dramatically since those seeds worth nothing nowdays.
---
Calqs are at the price of acorn seed.
---
Something must be done either nerf it or somehow find a way to sink those seeds...
---
Its boring af but if you really want slayer points fast do a low level master but every 10th task do duradel for the increased points 
---
The path is clearly intended to be hidden. A human has no way to distinguish between the safe and unsafe tiles without trial and error. 
---
Having a tool solve your clue puzzles is cheating too, but less so than the bog because the puzzle pieces in the slider puzzles all have different visual representations.
---
There was a dip in ranarr seed price, but it is climbing now. Maybe a latent effect and the weed prices will go up again.
---

Realistically the only thing you got right was the east coast, and even that’s a 50/50 shot so cool it grand wizard. Try not to be so socially stunted next time. 
---
Turns out I reset my progress when I fished a dark crab and cooked it. Apparrently you can only complete 1 multi-step diary challenge at a time and starting another resets the rest.
---
Rather spend 30 hours on b gloves than get void again every death. And if you just do the def quests for it, it's a lot less time and can just edge/pvp pk without any questing for a long time and just do b gloves when you want to upgrade to real pking

what about using crystal seeds on it to 'overpower' it. they are like 1kea and need a sink
---
God dam thank you 😂😂👍🏼
---
No seed vault?
---
I guess the reasoning behind it would be females have clothes tailored to fit their smaller frame. I wouldn’t expect this change to pass if polled either. Looking at you arma helm..
---
Weapons remembering autocast and attack style.
---
Finally some good fucking QoL.
---
Magma at about 4k, tanzanite at 4580
---
I know, but the collection log was only released fairly recently and I got very lucky to get all items in 2k kc
---
The guy's entire strategy is revolved around parasiting off of other people. He can not tank himself, he relies on only dealing the most damage while someone else tanks. This puts the other team in a somewhat interesting prisoners dilemma: they can either leave and get nothing (while also denying the other guy anything), or they can stay and get shittier loot while letting the crasher freeload. His game plan only works when other people do work for him. Can you explain why this is not griefing ? 
---
Fantastic to know. Sorry to hear, but thanks for the words :)

Where the fuck is pking?
---
I think they scaled it down to keep the same proportion on the cape. Female shoulders are skinnier so they shrunk the whole cape instead of making it thinner.
---
Something else is hitting a chaos druid that you were hitting. It's probably those lava sparks. 
---
Dunno why it's like that, but it just is.
---
I guess I could've seen that but I am on mobile so I wasn't checking the old school page and the in game one was a bit late iirc.
---
I occasionally get Swamp Linux in the captions.
---
My favorite flavor of Linux btw.
---
Thanks!
---
The thing is, that also makes the price of Ultra Compost almost exactly the same as Super Compost.
---
UC is almost double the price of SC right now.
---
This'll make UC pretty much only 100 gold more than SC.
---
They're basically hurting the price of both items.
---
You can gain and lose favour without starting the quest but the only way to “lock in” favour is by starting the quest, attaining 100% favor and then talking to that houses architect. Once you’ve talked to the architect the favour is locked in and you can start gaining favour in another house without losing your previously gained favour.

RC is just Agility with MoneyMaking.
---
     
---
RC is strictly better.
---
Good strategy, fletching is indeed a decent money maker, especially in higher levels when you just string the bows, I was able to make enough money for about 2 bonds in my last few levels, so if you're going for a 99 it's a good one and totally doable
---
Best of luck to you too
---
I have had complete log for a while [https://imgur.com/a/xWS2j8h](https://imgur.com/a/xWS2j8h)

Lel, you didnt even get all 99s and quest cape. What a waste...
---
Jokes aside it looks great, a bit of evrything
---
h
---
You ever heard of the spell ‘stat spy’ ? LUL
---
Exactly, the announcement wasnt made before update it was done after couple minutes into the update so anyone could of logged in and would not check their attack style would have got their account ruined.
---
Jagex needs to revert back these stats, and they can do it, i dont have a pure but feels bad for people have
---
I can't even tell if this is bait or just average slayer/main player intellect.
---
Yeah I got 2 cb levels tho... I wanted 1 attack not 5 
---
nice stats kid
---
support
---
wow I'm sorry man would be nice if they would roll back
---
They have never been private, even on the og client back in 2007... yeah, people are dicks, it's high school all over again, but it could be worse...
---
Nice that's alotta mutagens!
---
If it would be because i made a dumb mistake, i wouldnt even ask, but since it Was the Update, that changed the attack style and ruined over 150 hrs of progress, there is a Chance that its possible. If a mod tells me they cant, okay, but you dont know :) 
---
..until the next update, that is
---
Btw
---
Yeah, I still need to do more for holy sandals :( 
---
Or at least show the hours played. Yes you may be maxed, but you’ve also spent the last five years on a game with no IRL meaning.
---
Currently at;
---
* 70 Attack
---
* 78 Strength
---
* 70 Defence
---
* 77 HP
---
* 78 Range
---
* 62 Mage
---
* 70 Prayer
---
Is barrows do-able at these stats? Thinking of using Slayer Dart for Magic. Also, what is the optimum inventory / percentage needed for best GP per hour?
---
For real lmao
---
Well to some extend that would be a Nice Thing to have. Needs to be capped tho
---
With the update where weapons save what attack style you were using, it reset everything (EVERY WEAPON) to it's first (accurate) option. It's a bug with their update, ruined a ton of peoples pures (attack styles plugin saved mine) and maaaybe we'll see a rollback
---
Lol ikr.
---
I have a quest cape, something i dreamed about ever since i was a kid.  when i first put it on I walk into the ge and do the emote because im happy about it and want to show off. what happens, kid in neitznot helm walks up and say "not even 99 fletch rip"
---
a
---
Thanks! I wonder what will be my first 99, fletching, cooking or runecrafting!
---
Jokes about RC haha
---
Trident of the swamp will give faster runs and thus more chests per hour, but it does cost much more to use. I'd stick with Trident of the Seas for now if money is a concern
---
they're fine

If you watch one, kiss your life goodbye.

Hmm that's possible yes. But no other mob does anything like that as far as I know.  A bit odd.

im just happy im at pest control doing my training instead og attacking stuff so this dont screw my account ^_^
---
QA strikes again! *fist*
---
they're working to fix the accounts that were affected 
---
It's not only the QA team that should be blamed in a lot of cases. Many of the bugged updates that come out are very amateurish from a programming prospective (aka anything without Ash's name stamped on it). The Brimstone Ring bug is a good example of this. Obviously, the QA team should catch most of these very obvious, easy to find scenarios and prevent the updates from going live, but it's beyond questionable how some of these bugs were a thing to begin with.
---
They really shouldnt not release a specific update just because of different account builds... They want to make the game more bearable for people who play the game as intended.
---
Genuine question, is there any downsides to them?
---
In other news -&gt; The behaviour of the Altars in the POH Achievement Gallery was changed
---
Can this be elaborated on?

they're working to fix the accounts that have been affected

that is such a beautiful account, all ruined thanks to update

It is a group activity yes, there's a discord you can join to to make sorting teams easier. 80k/h with minimal effort is worth the hassle of finding a team
---
Yeah i have no idea what this guy's talking about
---
monkfish are shit, nobody should ever fish a monkfish in osrs ever again. barb fish for money, barb fish for xp. there are no alternatives.

Yes. When I am on melee hand at olm I use long range on my trident. And almost ALWAYS forget to switch my tbow back to rapid for p3.

Just watch a movie while training agility. Ir pretend you are racing the other players. Next thing u know you'll be 200k experience closer to bliss.
---
Just take all necessary precautions in setting up 2factor on rs acc, bank pin, security questions, 2factor on email that you use, etc. Sadly, no you cannot receive your items back because odds are, the hijacking was on your part for lacking security or entering passwords on phishy sites. Good luck on the rebuild man

be smart

that is all you have to do

Just Dragon Slayer II, all quests is too much in one month..
---
beware, this guy has no clue of different goals in fitness.
---
because its got a big prayer bonus and +20 defence stats for those times that you may get hit...
---
I've seen some of your videos, they're great. I didn't know you had a series for Zeah only. Definitely will check that out. Thanks! 
---
What did they do this time?
---
Imagine watching sombody play video games. Sad.
---
its a manual rollback on effected accs
---
Fuck pures and any other playstayle that isn't main-slayerscape, that's why. Polls will never be kind to pures, and until they limit who can vote for polls, they never will be. 
---
it's a shame but it's the truth.

Did she buy you a cushion? Lol you’re sleeping on the couch.

Devaluate my ragger only pvp but iron-man

They call it QOL update

😂
---
No one cares about Pures, I don't expect that to change now. 
---
"first they went for the farmers, but I did not speak out because I was not a farmer." 
---
Why even make us have to refill Gricoller's can at all at that point? Sure, it's just a minor inconvenience, but it seems kind of pointless. Just make it be eternal. 
---
How is it an integrity issue? You're putting in the same amount of "work" as you would doing it on your main, and also paying the extra sub fee.
---
&gt; Is there anyway to change my OSRS account to IM/HCIM via full reset or some weird thing like that? 
---
No. 
---
You must set your ironman status before leaving tutorial island. 
---
woooooooooo
---
That looks sick, I didn't even know there was a second CTC ongoing..
---
Its convenient for maging certain things, ice barraging is less annoying when swapping between knives and ancient staff for dust devils and stuff.
---
Swapping to DWH you can have it automatically be accurate rather than aggressive.
---
It's a nice little Quality of life feature
---
add negative exp lamps to revs
---
4 levels I was 1 attack.. and it got me 2 cb levels
---
Whoa. Careful there with that spade sticking out, pal. I’d hide that before hopping any wilderness ditches. 
---
I am 7000 hrs in to my rs3 acc And still I switched
---
How dumb you gotta be to not notice the xp youre getting though, its not like you can hit high enough to get a levels worth of xp in a couple hits
---
Gz on your steel scim pure, great for pking apparently
---
is it super difficult to screenshot your kill log on runelite?
---
Lol I built the account for 1 attack not 5
---
Nah would devalue my no agility only ironman
---
Just read updates 4head 
---
runelite doesnt have a light box solver. I think it used to, but not anymore.
---
they actually updated this today, you can no longer put box traps by the ladder, lmao

That’s dumb as hell, it affects no one and just lets people have more fun lol
---
Would allow some builds to obtain items they currently can not while staying at 1 defence. Would make low level pking even stronger than it already is. 
---
Serene deez nuts
---
for the greater good
---
Just buy it tbh, end up spending a lot less gp and time on it in the long run. It's not detectable with remote desktop
---
You can also go on the unrestricted worlds and do a lot of stuff without losing anything/any gear. You can alch some items for cash to get your items back
---
Problem is people wanted the autocast update (me included) but then the pvp side said it would be too op for wildy so they had to find a middle ground 
---
If you search on Google (or even this subreddit) there's about a million spreadsheets you can download and edit, there's usually a place for how much you bought and a place to put how much you sold it for. Save it to your desktop and you're good to go.

Submit a support ticket on the official website.

Iirc this has happened to a few people and theyve managed to get the membership transfered.

Vorkath/Alchemical hydra
---
Why? Were you looting there or something? :p
---
At least you didn’t say “today year’s old”
---
I did Not expect that they fuck that up lol
---
To be fair they didn't put much thought into any of the first updates. Old Nieve's cave, nmz and zulrah droptable were terrible game design choices which they later admitted.
---
Yes, bug. The one they had to temporarily patch by completely disabling attacks with staffs for like an hour.
---
Dude nice! 1 runecrafting!
---
Just got ancestral robe bottom at raids, hope a rollback wont fuck me over.
---
Unfortunately shit like this so guranteed to happen. This is more on jagex for not baby-proofing. You can argue pures didn’t read but there’s also too much room for error; the given time frame between reading about the announcement and logging in is short. You’re also placing the assumption that everyone will read the announcement. Although we can guess most will read it on login, there’s no evidence for that and is heresy; each individual is different.
---
Nice to see them finally owning up to their mistakes
---
This is really the pvm community 
---
They haven't before. 
---
Expect the unexpected. Should be extra careful on an restricted account 
---
There should be 0 sperm present in the seminal fluid post-vasectomy, which would mean no DNA with which to identify the account.
---
I guess what I'm saying is the taste test would still work.
---
Devalues those who have unique acount and never fucked up... :/ also there might be.possibilities to create weird accounts with them, like 9hp and all
---
Obby maulers and pures can easily go from 1-2 in att or def in a single hit.
---
Looool
---
Not gonna happen mate. Unethical, and wouldn't feel like an achievement. People are already roasting Infernal cape owners enough for buying their capes, regardless if they know how it has been obtained. I want mine well deserved. I'll do Zulrah or Vorkath for a couple of hours for supply money if I need.
---
&gt;what happens is you save 300 hours on fishing cape by doing barb fish over monkfish, then you go to vorkath and make 1 billion gp over those 300 hours. Monkfish are dead content.
---
What was the other game they made? Dragon something or other
---
Jagex doesn't give 2 fucks about pvp community, no rollback going to happen. If it was hc ironmen losing status or something, would have been rolled back instantly
---
Nah, I have 10k banked. Price should hopefully go up a bit if members have to enchant 
---
The phishers broadcast videos of well known streamers/developers on fake twitch accounts to phish with, they arent showing their faces.

Aaand you're doing it again... Sometimes you just gotta stop arguing. There is no win in internet arguments about pointless shit, and if there is, it's not worth it.

Wow, that IS an unpopular opinion. Unlike the sub.

gitgud
---
Just do bf then alch ur shit and it breaks even most of the time.
---
? Tbow is 1/30m points not 1/1m points...
---
If you read it, if ur capable of that, you can see they say they are changing it so weapons remember their previous attack styles and clearly state for everyone to check their attack styles as the update reset them to implement the new changes. Also they said it again on Twitter :) but brainlets be brainlets xD 
---
It wasnt even enough exp to let you go from addy gloves to mith without defense.
---
Getting to addy already requires you to get defense xp.
---
It was a very limited amount of exp that couldn't even grt you from level 15 back to 13.
---
Good call. Kind of surprising that Jagex didn't foresee this.
---
Appropriate for this post tbh
---
This is a great suggestion but range needs no help as it is the current DPS leader. What about a master wand / ancient shard combination?
---
Not every method is costly; some profit but they are slower exp. Gold Bars are the quick way to train, but they are other options. With Gold at the Blast Furnace, it costs around 1.8M per hour and gets 350K exp, give or take a bit.
---
But if you do Steel Bars at the Blast Furnace, you can get up to 70K exp per hour (5 times slower) but you'd make up to 650K profit per hour. Iron Bars are also pretty good at the Blast Furnace and can get 77K exp and 600K profit. It is a similar case for Mithril, Adamantine, and Runite, with each being more profit and exp than the previous. That said, Steel, Mithril, Adamantite, and Runite would benefit from a Coal Bag.
---
There is also Darts and Knives. Iron Knives seem to be a profit loss at the moment; same for Dart Tips. But sometimes they will be profit or break even. It seems Steel Dart Tips current profit 80K with 36K exp per hour; that is a ton slower but it is more AFK than Blast Furnace. It seems Mithril Darts are close to break even with 48K exp per hour and Adamant Darts are 60K profit with 60K exp per hour, but like I said the prices shift. You could also make Cannonballs which are a lot more AFK but only 150K profit and 14K exp per hour.
---
You could even smelt Iron Ore in a normal Furnace with Rings of Forging, then sell bars or make into knives... Though that would be extremely slow compared to better options and since Knives are profit loss it probably isn't worth it. But if you don't mind slower exp rates, you can do methods to profit while training. Or you could make money elsewhere and do the faster exp methods.
---
Agreed, I'd at least like an option for this.
---
Except all the ones who had a teeny tiny shred of prudence. 
---
Woox made a website in which you can find one book, then it narrows down the options as to where the others could be. Once you find 2, it shows you where every book is. You can do 100% favor in about 30 minutes. Books change every place every 90(?) minutes so if that happens you'll have to find one on your own again.

Thank God, I can finally do barrows in a more efficient order without having to re-set my Iban blast after karil.

only if you can use it if you stole my visafe
---
Yeah I'm really sorry for anyone who is a pure or a pvper coming to reddit for any issues. It's a lot of people misunderstanding the situation or just straight up hivemind hating. Best of luck to you. I would be devastated if this happened to me.
---
I believe they mean that you can now right click the tier 1 altars to choose which spellbook to swap to 
---
I am intensely curious to see what methods you're talking about.
---
This is the content people want to see.
---
Highly unlikely
---
No, its an integrity issue.
---
You're probably right, I don't remember the exact quest order. 
---
The only risk is balancing/drop rate. Jagex has a history of completely fucking up drop tables.
---
Great argument my guy.
---
is that mad mork?
---
They said there looking at there options at the moment. 
---
You dont have to check them while playing.
---
I do a run when i wake up and one before i go to work. Then check my phone every hour at work. When i get home and before i go to bed.
---
During my actual osrs playing time i only do them when they are ready and i happen to be at a bank and not doing anything important.
---
The profits improve with higher level birdhouses. Nests are 3k each now and you get seeds from them which can have insane prices since they are mostly tree seeds. 
---
when you’re logged out in an area where there are aggressive monsters so you retaliate before getting a chance to click anything bc you’re still on the “click here to play” screen 👌👌👌👌
---
I like it how you hid your name and not theirs because you knew you're the one who'll get ridiculed for this.

Enjoy additional 4 additional minutes

Honestly dunno why I waited. Think I've been doing runs for just under a week, try to do them as much as I can. Gone from 19 to 58 hunter with almost no other effort (went Puro Puro to check it out) soon as I unlock red chins I'm gonna spam them
---
"I made a decision that would be affected by letting f2p do something that makes sense, so no." Yikes
---
That’s bullshit because the experts put the time into learning it. You’re not entitled to their speed, using runelite is cheating. 
---
Serene and me are radically different. The only thing we have in common is that our comments are downvoted by default.
---
They should at least make it an option. 
---
Just make it leaf bladed battleaxe +2 strength.

&gt;Can we get the ability to only accept messages from an approved list of people?

 You could set your private chat to "Friends", this does precisely that.

---
in all fairness, i decided to not show my name because dutch people might report it as offensive. 
---
well, i havent used twitter before, since i saw no reason to do so, and i have better things to do, then read every update post. i rather expect them to state that clearly in the game, upon logging in. but thank you for your useless posts. have a nice day :)
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
That’s the answer I needed. I was looking last night but didn’t find the setting. I’ll check again today! Thanks!
---
Completely agree.
---
Let us stack clue scrolls in bank or using a special clue holder.  I'd much prefer to be able to go do 3-5 hard clues at once than have to stop what i'm doing every time I want to do one and re-organize my inventory x times.
---
&gt;10%  
---
Brought to you by statistics I pulled out of my ass!
---
i guess they could look for patterns of people with high strenght lets say above 50, that compared to yesterdays highscores have gained attack xp and then set them back to level one. Don't think it is as hard of a procedure but easy to screw up :)
---
All this talk of Cum Jars reminds me of the MLP experiment.

Stop standing on my loot pile right after I get kills noob
---
Not at all. Downvotes mean nothing.
---
I wouldn't settle for less.
---
Best news I've heard all week
---
I made steel arrow heads from 50 to 60 and lost like 10k...
---
Yeah it would be near impossible to update it case by case probbaly. And just locking all data from being used by 3rd party clients would upset a huge part of the community. Best they can do is review plugins made onrunelite then ask runelite devs to remove some if they think it's not good for the game integrity.

P

not since the latest commit, you'd have to build RL yourself now

It's accessed by rightclicking the "Private" button under the chat box, same thing works for public chat, clan chat etc

There's still a good chance it'll take him 15k+ kills to get to the droprate. The roll for a drop is always the same, and you never know where the universe has put you on the hell curve.

''PSA TO ALL PURES''
---
Who's in charge of this shit
---
With the update today, they made it so that weapon groups like swords or daggers share and memorize the same attack style. This however reset all the attack styles to Accurate and obby maulers that missed this patch had gained attack xp which cost them combat levels :(
---
Now u can make it into an account that doesn’t have to have the other guy intentionally sit at 40% HP to have a decent fight lul 
---
Fuck this, trying to find this "twill" book on the middle floor north west wing and once a-fucking--gain, I check every single fucking bookcase, and there is no mother fucking twill scroll, fuck this. 
---
They need to legit modify or add an additional way to get favor in this house "deliver dark essence for the mysterious stranger/etc to the dark altar, each delivered dark essence provides 0.1% favour, dark essence given for this task is untradable, unusable, and used up to gain favour".
---
This house needs to be fixed. I just went through the library middle floor north west side again, I wanted to see if I could get this fucking twill book before I submitted more comments bitching about this. 
---
They don't do rollbacks in the past to the accounts who had pures ruined from an update, there worded it correctly happy?
---
The true solution to this problem is to spend some (or a lot) of development time beefing up the official client and then ban 3rd party clients. The problem is only going to get worse.
---
Because they're doing an update to the entire styles function that you're either aware of or perfectly capable of reading. 
---
Did not know this. Haven't done any holiday events
---
hmmmm damn.
---
There shouldn't be any blood. :)
---
They didn't do rollbacks in the past to the accounts who had pures ruined from an update.
---
I think the post was sarcastic. But yeah, fuck this bitch
---
Says the guy with the useless post xD if the staff bug didn’t happen they wouldn’t be reverting anyone’s stats which would have been great. Stupid brainlets, natural selection 
---
I already expected it not coming out for months. Kind of sad when you default think that. "Let's keep adding in more items even though everyone is struggling with bank space already, but let's not help them in any way, make them have to drop things and make choices. Its a "feature""
---
Got a link for this website? 
---
the problem is, that they probably ruined their own pure by being stupid, and now hate on everyone that is looking for help, because they didnt get any, regardless of the issue. i am not even pking, but i had some plans with that account, and it would be annoying when 150hrs+ would be wasted.
---
Thank you
---
Yea... imps. 
---
Hope you get rolled back. It would be fucked up if you didn’t because you hurt some people’s little feelies with a fucking word. 
---
Big support for the graceful set change. I'm so sick of only seeing people wear the graceful set. it's boring when everyone looks the same.

Sure... That's why your post is on the front page of /r/2007scape, because you always get downvoted as soon as people read your name.

I'm sure you're different from Serene, he's on a whole 'nother level, but stop whining about this. You get downvoted for being obnoxious, even if your comments are factually correct.

How do you mark them?   Do you need to do it during the fight?
---
Which is sad because OP is right.. a nice afk task with shit drops and 1 unique drop of 1.5m... Nice design of monster loot
---
Imagine being you an actual fucking idiot. 
---
You're complaining about people complaining when they don't know what's going on when Jagex only stated they wouldn't work for melee combat, and not that they would temporarily be completely unusable. 
---
How dense are you ? Checking the attack style would've done nothing because the attack style display was bugged and showed it as something else when it was another
---
My point

Such a shame there isn’t a place to look up things about runescape.

In my opinion it’s further dividing the community without the intention of that. It’s unfortunate but when all these little minute details such as no prayer reorder etc come into play someone who is a pvmer isn’t going to want to go pk with they prayers they aren’t used to

How long does birthday event run for?

When a teeny tiny little change like this gets fucked up so bad then people wonder why we don't want them touching our game...
---
Congrats u will hit more accurately now 
---
How would pissing off several thousand people and making them quit paying for membership be good for the pvm community?
---
They literally polled shorter and less intensive events and it passed sooo...we get shorter and less intensive events 
---
this is a very valid point
---
Will give this a try ty. 
---
Sometimes i wonder if jagex knows that not everyone uses twitter..
---
Any update that frees up bank space is a good update.
---
Right behind the Hatius Cosaintus grave
---
CmonBruh
---
Can you please clarify. 
---
Why are you force feeding yourself cabbage?
---
&gt; foiling the combat system to gain an advantage in PvP
---
If that is actually how jagex felt they would've done something about it when they remade osrs. At this point it is a valid attack build and salty pvm fucks like yourself get sit on a dildo. 
---
how long did those teles take you 
---
I'm sure everyone will get used to it, not every change needs to be toggleable.
---
how retarded are you? It simply set your style to attack, not some mystery nonsense, stfu scrub
---
That’s like checking your bank to make sure everything is in there every time you log in lmao. Only a lunatic would do such thing you recommend. If I would take your advice I would have checked my combat style to see it remain the same for the past 4 years at least
---
“I was wrong. As the adult I am, I’ll call you names and be salty about being wrong. Being wrong is bad, and learning from a mistake is a no-no.”

Because some 70def max str account is gonna put on dh, then get enough negative xp lamps to drop to 1def and go PKing? As if there won't be plenty of safeguards to prevent situations like that?

So happy for this. currently 99 atk/str and working on defence, when doing DKs i so often forget to switch back to rapid on my blowpipe after being on defensive with my tent lol.

This is playing the game properly you ignorant fuck. 
---
you dont resort your bank every night and reconcile it?
---
Pretty much I pay $40 cnd for GoodLife but it has a sauna so it's worth the extra imo
---
50/50
---
it only affects pures so having a serverside rollback is a bit much, rollbacking affected accounts will be fine, like a 1 def pure having higher def now they can just fix that. 
---
Sure but not everyone reads every update before logging in.
---
Some pures definitely about to get fucked, 100%.
---
It’s part of my cabbage only locked iron man
---
im so good at reading, the best they may say, so good

You don't need all that equipment, I am ripped as fuck on just the basics.

5 months is barely any time in SEO terms. The new wiki is finally starting to rank well compared to the old one, but a huge number of people are still unaware.

Lol I can't wait until they add mtx because I will laugh at all the pvmscapers who wasted their lives on this game
---
Aww did someone else lose their baby pure
---
Why are they slightly tilted? It’s literally more effort to tilt them, since you can jusg printscreen and paste in paint.

When you take shrooms
---
idk i'm just sick of smug redditors that don't know what they're talking about
---
yeah, shot down because gatekeeping imo. I'm thinking polls to remove specs from pvp weapons and require defence for all armour would pass. The tiny spellbook icons look completely rediculous, just because some people were proud of their clicking ability lol
---
No my pures were actually not changed since I was on my main. Good try though idiot. 
---
What does this have to do with a third party client LMAO
---
you people are fucking retarded
---
Because you only get 70% of the cape compared to men 
---
as intended? the whole point of runescape is to play it however you want to lmao. 
---
What bug? Everyone was set to attack not defense after update, and honestly anyone not checking their style after an update like today deserve what they get.
---
Both.
---
So when will the SJWs come to RS and demand there be a neutral gender character?

What do you expect of people who click on virtual rocks for 7 hours a day?

That's... Not how it works

Let me just build a 20,000 sqft climbing wall and a 25m swimming pool in my basement real quick.
---
Lol nice should’ve read the homepage
---
Type of response I'd expect from someone that gets constantly smacked by pures. 
---
Good job making all ironman look bad with your comment
---
Bc apparently idiots like twiste think only the pvm community exists. They apparently don't know history or why osrs is even back after eoc. 
---
You'd still have your bank if you had a bank pin. 
---
Wait what is this? Where did you find it?
---
The resentment towards PvP is so hilarious, imagine being mad because you are shot at something

Hahahah true

No client is safe 100%. Use at your own risk. But, there is a non-client calculator which Woox helped popularise that you can use to work out where books are.

Are you stupid? This has nothing to do with 3rd party clients

don't train. possible reset incoming.

The clip's essentially 16 seconds long
---
Dude people build pking accounts in under a week
---
I don't think you need thousands and thousands, I'm saying that the money you spend on the gym is overall better spent because you get way more equipment at the price. So you have more variation, you're free to try different machines/weights etc without needing to invest and be unsure, and not only that you save on time because there's no maintenance, setting up, upgrading, etc. 
---
And who the fuck spends 70k on gym membership over their life? If I went to my same gym chain and paid every month for the next **50 years** It'd cost me 21k. And I get 5 gyms, classes, training, swimming, spas and pretty much anything and everything in any of those 5 centers for that price. I'd rather do that than invest in less, inferior equipment, my own olympic swimming pools, personal trainers and all the other bells and whistles.
---
Oh I did miss that my bad
---
Slowly but surely jagex is really giving it to you brainlets and I find it hilarious 
---
imagine if my account was cb 122 , total 1995 with  1.8b from pvm
---
[Update incoming](https://imgur.com/N951Rzt). Fixing pures. Thanks Baseflex!
---
Did they also do Fallen Swords?
---
tbh I'm a pvmer and I despise those pussyshits that come and whine how they've been wrongfully killed by a pker in pvp area, they're legit retarded
---
Yep... saddest thing is they’ve actually been decent with major implementations but the little things are fucked lol
---
Like the last poll with those prayer button moving updates or spell icons, hellll no don’t even touch it. I’ll let a third party client do it and do it right instead lmao 
---
I grinded strength on my pure at ammonites and omfg that was so infuriating
---
&gt; pkers that stick to pk worlds i have no issue with
---
LMAO every world in the wild is our wild dipshit. 
---
God, that game was my shit.
---
i'll take weekly, buggy updates over infrequent bug-free updates
---
I was thinking there could be some Red Dragons there. Heroes has a Blue Dragon and the RFD followup to Legends has Black Dragons, so it would make sense to have one or two Red Dragons.
---
Also double replying because [an update in 45 minutes will roll-back](https://imgur.com/N951Rzt), and this is top comment.
---
I count 10 blades of grass to the left of him gg account
---
2 def doesn't really make an account unusable by itself but getting an extra combat level is definitely a real disadvantage
---
yea you will get your stats back dw
---
As someone with no remorse for any issues pures run into, this whole debacle is hilarious
---
Why don't you play the game properly
---
Mod Ash already said on Twitter they were looking to sort the accounts that were affected
---
So.. what happens.. Do I lose all my pest control points ive been getting for the past hours?
---
press x to doubt. 
---
x
---
Half are anorexic actually.
---
I don't play anymore I just lurk to see the quality content. 
---
Uhh Ardy roofs I could consistently do 62k hrs. Did a few tick perfect 64.3k (I think that's the figure) ardy hours as well. As for werewolf no clue, never did it, check out yt or the skilling discord for a guide (easy 70k plus though). 
---
A fix isn't an update idiot. 
---
It depends how good you are at alting.
---
Most people that alt raids just have their alt doing prep (Killing scavs, farming herbs, filling vials, making potions) to shave a few minutes off the raid time. Also, having more people in the raid (alts included) scales it a bit more, so you get more points per raid (Better chance at a drop).
---
If you're good at alting, you can also use it to help with puzzle rooms. Prep rooms have trees you can cut for kindling (if there's ice demon in the raid), it can be used as a tank for tightrope, or help your team find grubs in the thieving room (And bring lockpicks along for everyone).
---
If you're really good at alting, you can even bring it into certain rooms to speed them up (Muttadiles, Vanguards, Ice Demon, Tightrope, Mystics, Shamen, Guardians, hell even Vasa if one or both of your accounts has a Twisted Bow) and be another account doing damage at Olm. Used to run 2+2's (duo raids with both of us alting for a total of 4 accounts in the raid) with someone like this, our average raid time was around 20-25 minutes and got about 70-80k points a raid. Compare this to your average trio that completes in ~ 30 minutes and gets ~ 60k points, and the difference in profit/h is fairly massive.
---
See y'all in 2023 when I have the cash stack for those last 49 levels then!
---
no. it's just good
---
This. I need to know if this is gonna be a rollback so i can stop training mining for naught.
---
PURE ^(entertainment)
---
&gt;Sometimes my non-opinionated neutral comments rake in tons of downvotes. 
---
&gt; are downvoted or marked as controversia
---
Loool. This is too funny. You realise this is exactly what Serene said too right? 
---
 If I sort the comments on your account by controversial, yeah by all measures it's a complete shitshow to be honest dude. It's you saying controversial stuff or being annoying or rude to other people. YES YOU CAN EXPECT TO GET DOWNVOTES HAHAHAHA. That's not because people are biased against you, it's because they're responding to you being an asshat hahahahahahaha. I don't see a single comment in there that is neutral like you claim.
---
I for one am excited to get 99 runecrafting through a bug. 
---
An additional attack level can make or break certain builds just as much as one def level can
---
At his magic level, he could also do everything to be able to use the fairy rings, too.
---
Hmm interesting. Not OP, but I'll give this a shot tonight. Is it better xp/hr?
---
But there has to be a line somewhere and this feels like the best to draw it: when the client is doing things for you that are impossible to do without it. People are only fine with this because the effect of it is so limited in scope. He didn’t say what the new average time per trek is though. This significant of a gain is shaving hundreds of hours off of his goal, and keep in mind it’s training 7 skills at once: Agility, Thieving, Slayer, Firemaking, Fishing, Woodcutting, and Mining - skills that aren’t too fast normally. If this method with the plugin became meta for training all 7 skills at once would that change the tone of this discussion? Because it shouldn’t - it’s still doing the same thing. 200-300 hours for level 85 in 7 skills doesn’t sound bad to me. 
---
PSA to all pures: maybe don’t train combat for a while sorry guys
---
Block attack styles you don’t need : runelite
---
another staple stat would be agility, getting graceful (weight reducing gear) makes running around waste less run energy. a lot of people on this sub gripe about agility but having that graceful will make your life a lot easier!
---
They have said they cant rollback single accounts on osrs, only server.
---
It looks like they will! Jagex has come through on this one, it seems.
---
https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1098560322376474625?s=09
---
I examine a lot of things for seemingly no reason. 
---
someone got 2 attack
---
Then the new pure would be 2 defense and all those "ruined" pking accounts w/ 2 def would be viable again. 
---
The game has been updated has it not? Idiot.
---
Nobody "forces" you to do anything, if you don't want to partake in PvP then it's not difficult to avoid literally the only PvP area in the entire game.
---
It's a joke not dick. Dont take it so hard. 
---
Reading too many comments in this sub will make you hate the game and the people that play it.
---
update coming letting them fix pures it seems. we'll see what that is.
---
&gt;melee combat
---
are you retarded bro? do you understand the differences in the combat triangle?
---
https://i.imgur.com/IRXxfpW.png
---
I think we just have to live with that if that's what's happening, but I don't think they would give us a warning if they were just planing to have a rollback. 
---
I'll take the sensible option
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Achievement_Diary
---
Was on my main. Pures didn't get changed. Nice try idiot. 
---
It's become a hivemind to hate on pkers because of the memes
---
Shadow of the Storm?
---
literally says update little brainlet, its okay your elite edge pking pure is saved
---
Get mobile :3
---
I probably overreacted. I'm replying to the idiots claiming we're bootlickin jagex ass. Yes it's a bug, shit happens, get over it. 
---
Its based on your search history, an incognito tab wont give the same results
---
Nah they just link you to official runescape pages
---
God you people get so fucking worked up over random shit, literally it's beyond obvious that this issue stemmed from them disabling melee for staffs but yeah sure I'm "Retarded"
---
pm me all the details, i got you.
---
Yes he initially said hard but he changed his mind and said that med was a better fit?
---
And you don’t have to scour the comments lol he’s said it everywhere
---
You blind???
---
How many times can you log out during fight caves?
---
I'm not arguing with your retarded ass.  It's a fix. All fixes are pushed as update because you have to update code and the game.  
---
The update is to fix the bug, not fix accounts affected.
---
Vrock diaries will help pay for bonds. Elite diaries nets you 200k a day right now.
---
I’m aware of this quest but still would be cool to have another that’s like “dragon slayer 2” for demon slayer 
---
Really nice collection! Hoping to get a white text stack or two of my own collection.
---
No, use the plugin 'NPC marker / highlighter', just type the name of the NPC you want to highlight. Make sure you spell it correctly, thzaar names are complicated :)
---
There will just be a roll back. Jesus relax.
---
the risk is exactly why you should put exclusive content there. Your argument makes no sense. If the wildy had no exclusive content, no one would ever go. 
---
You can go invalidate your own claim in incognito right now 
---
You realise the original reason for certain spots in the wilderness being active in the first place, pre-eoc, like West \*DRAGS\*, East \*DRAGS\*, 44s \*KBD GATE\*, 48 \*rune rocks spot\*, was because of the resources that were available, and not because Jagex made updates to make PvP better, right?
---
He finished at around 2k med clues, isn't 9 rangers just under droprate then?
---
hey OP, skip the middle man, I actually work at jagex. pm me the details
---
lmao best
---
90% of 1 def pures don’t pk anyway they stand at ge in ranger boots and a mage cape 
---
I mean, you seem like a prick to me.. Does no good to call you one, though. 
---
I assume you are both correct
---
That's actually really good lol
---
gg no re
---
They caught onto you bro. You're doomed.
---
It's alright man, soon you can hop back on and spec tab some people for 40k loot! A much needed update!
---
if it meant nothing why even bring it up at all.. bet it gets to you
---
not just after you log in but also after you use a different weapon 
---
You just had a stroke.
---
Oh the irony...
---
So sick of pitchfork shaking players who’ve been rubbed the wrong that I’ll stab em with my pitchfork for rubbing me the wrong way!
---
hahahahah you just brought back fond memories from my childhood
---
Just stop botting.

---
Go through the lists and see which master has more monster assignments that can be done in the Catacombs. Take note of the task weights as well.
---
Go back to that dead game LoL. No wonder your a shitforbrains dolt.
---
No disagreeing is something else lol. Even if you downvote someone because u disagree with them youre misusing and abusing the function and not following rediquette. 
---
It's cute that you think games still have real QA departments.
---
It probably gave all the old rewards too
---
Just went 50 barrows chests dry and then got 4 Torags pieces on the bounce on the next 4 chests. What's the worst luck followed by best you've had in the game? 
---
My bad, good call.
---
Imagine being a mong - oh wait, you don't have to.
---
When you tried to attack with a staff, you were given the wrong combat xp with the attack style. This affect pures and similar types of account as during the bug: Attack gave defence XP, Strength gave attack XP and defence gave strength XP
---
Go see a therapist for that anger
---
2 factor the email.
---
the cake item is gonna end up having +100 attack mark my fucking words
---
Because its indicative of a mentality. The actual votes doesnt matter. They serve no manner of purpose.
---
exactly, if it were possible to not abuse I'd be 1000000000% for rolling back 15 xp gained by a misclick or whatever. Mistakes happen and it sucks that a sick account can be ruined in one accidental click.
---
&gt; The developers likely did not intend for people to Prayer flick and save Prayer, but they intended to code Prayer the way it was implemented into the game. The way people use it, is an an unintended feature.
---
So we're in agreement then...? If you're saying this makes it not technically a "bug", then sure, I'll concede that point. The fact that this is stems from poor implementation and completely changes how people use the skill doesn't change.
---
Well said. Answered my question perfectly, thank you!
---
I don't have any BTW accs, so i dont have to worry about that high ass slayer lvl quite yet lol
---
Exactly lol. You don't even have to touch the camera on most courses so it's literally click once every 5-10 seconds while watching Netflix. 
---
get fucked and stop bullshitting 
---
What kind of rewards would be good from a mid-level raid when you'd replace gear with higher level stuff? 
---
I just googled it and ITS TRUE!
---
delete your acc
---
Falador museum\*
---
you should be ashamed that one of these isn't just watching the episode multiple times
---
I didn't tell him to do elite diaries, I was giving him the max potential profit for doing vrock diaries. Why so passive aggressive?
---
...you would be right lol
---
exactly, that kind of sucks doesn't it? or is it just me?
---
A part of me wants Jagex to poll the Evolution of Combat just so we have the highest no to yes ratio in history. 
---
Ha next time read the post
---
Cannonballs are about 130k per hour but you only click once every 2 mins 45 seconds. 
---
Fuck polling this, just add them, the only people who would vote no would be the people this doesn't impact.
---
How can someone honestly be this clueless...
---
This is why PvP changes never pass polls. 
---
Negative xp lamps and untradables like coal bags
---
What about upon death in castle wars? It currently doesn’t remember auto cast now. Is this also considered PVP?
---
I dont care, Swampletics is a god I will only watch his content. Fuck any other content creators
---
Oh shoot! You right!!!!
---
Maybe if they gave us a client that was like runelite we wouldn't have to use runelite to make the game more enjoyable. 
---
Is this why I'm fat?
---
Driver these kids are make mo2amrat on the pkin race. jastlex ful of bleck UKanian childs. 
---
going to end badly for you... say goodbye to your main :D
---
Gz mate! Same cc btw x
---
I always wondered if a zerk would destroy a 75 def  if given unlimited GP. Like 75 def in BIS gear vs a zerk in BIS?
---
Given a Dm and not some spec-tele shit. 
---
I know that usualy zerk always wins in pratice because the 75 def will probably not risk full BIS and use inferior items but what about in theory?
---
You are also dpsing the shaman with blowpipe tho. Not like you are afk with the cannon doing everything. But it's probably a bit more, maybe 7
---
For real! I don't understand how they keep getting hundreds of upvotes. 
---
ha next time read the joke
---
I would have liked the negative xp lamps if they were just that, something to un-do fuck-ups, but it would have been a mammoth undertaking really.
---
They'd have to find a way to make quest xp somehow permanent, to prevent people from doing things like removing the defence xp gained from Soul's Bane, or going back on several Prayer levels after unlocking Ava's or Ancients. Like, weeks of dev time to benefit so few people.
---
Real. The votes are one thing, but the way people talk on here about hating pkers and the way they reply to me when I try defending the concept of people enjoying a game the way they want to enjoy it, it seems pretty obvious.
---
People seem to genuinely think that they deserve pvp immunity while in the wilderness simply because they personally aren't there to pvp. Then they think that the people who are in the pvp zone to pvp are "toxic" for pking them.
---
For the most part though, it seems that the people crying about being pked are those meme virgins, whereas the people who understand that the wilderness is for pking are those meme chads.
---
I personally don't pk, but if someone kills me in the wilderness, I don't cry. That's just the way it goes. The people who can't handle it hate pvp so much that they even vote no to fashionscape for pures even when they have likely never been killed by a pure in the wilderness in their life.
---
Yep. Agreed! 
---
Most of my friends don't use reddit, they play casually and won't even touch the wildy because they hate pkers and it ruins their game experience.
---
Yes good bot
---
Pfft, you milkdrinkers. Real nords drink mead!
---
Yeah but Jagex didn’t test the update on a main, a pure, and a skiller to even see what happened.
---
They rolled the update out with zero QA testing, clearly. Not even 30 seconds of “yeah we cool, looks like it’ll work”. 
---
Uhh... there was a legitimate glitch that caused attack styles to give the wrong exp...
---
Not to mention it's pretty damn reasonable to assume that a mechanic wouldn't suddenly change and that you'd log in with the aggressive attack style just like every other time in the last 6 YEARS.
---
Save them for early zulrah now that it's been made super easy
---
But what if you could train runecraft faster?
---
I thought you said bye?
---
It's more Swampbugabuse but no one will say so because it's Settled and we love him too much.
---
Yeah, why doesn't the entire world know who he is?!
---
14 prayer is the same level as 15. 10 prayer is te same as 11. It wouldnt have made a difference there. And im not talking 70.25 is the same as 70.00. Oddpray levels dont have any cmb weighting so 10 and 11 prayer would both be 70.00 and 12 would be 70.25.
---
Could also just had a hard req onto ancient magics
---
Don't roll him back for that mouth.
---
ha next time read
---
Which I favour over some dances and cow outfits.
---
i like short events it's xp waste if they're too long
---
Probably would have been more helpful to give him a more realistic reference point for what he could achieve relatively soon like the easy or medium diary
---
But anyway, I did it to be funny on the internet and get some imaginary points, no hard feelings 
---
Nah I just don't like 1 def nubs. If it were up to me armor would give hp like it does in rs3
---
Exactly.
---
Power points?
---
I feel like this animation is based on Mod Ash's arm thing and him drinking his red tea mug.
---
happy birthday us, bois
---
we ruined your accs, bois
---
lul
---
This annoyed me to no ends while running barrows, enough to dissuade me from bossing for a while (along with dry streak).  
---
Guess I'll kill some brothers tonight.
---
You're 10 years behind.
---
"investigate" in Jagex Speak is "act like we care about"
---
i was an f2p player and i agree. i have never understood all the hate for dungeoneering really, that was basically all i did once the wild was killed.
---
Y’all might also like to binge through some 99 1 at a time videos
---
Your comment makes no sense.  It's a well known fact that pures absolutely dominate mid level PvP.  They can access T50 and T60 gear and get access to spec combos at a point where mains are in T40 and don't have overheads.  That's not a matter of getting good, unless by get good you mean go make a pure of your own 
---
If you can fight Vorkath, I think it's well worth it. Should be pretty quick to earn back your melee kit.
---
\[x\] Doubt
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH GET REKT NUB
---
IIRC 1 def level is 0.25 of a combat so in theory if your maxed combat level is below xx.75 1 defence level doesn’t matter.
---
Below xx.50, 2 defence level doesn’t matter. Etc.
---
I’m sure there are builds out there that are unaffected in combat level once maxed, but 1 def is just cleaner.
---
Yeah sorry this screenshot is actually from 2017. 
---
But still pretty funny.
---
Because he's a wee young cunt. 
---
No? The point is that a properly leveled pure destroys against non-pures at its combat bracket most of the time. How much a pure risks on average is irrelevant if they can still kill everyone else... besides any account can pk in rags and pures can risk hundreds of mils 
---
delete this 
---
I like it, but the blue of the backpack  sticks out a bit too much from the overall white/grey scheme. 7.5/10
---
Fair one =)
---
&gt; How can someone honestly be this clueless...
---
Haven't played this game for the best part of 12 years and when I did, I never played PVP.
---
So much flex in one picture. 
---
tnank you 
---
Man, you’d hate the wildly. 
---
Can’t even die gracefully without being told to “sit, retard”. 
---
idk but  i hate it, pls make it adult sized thanks
---
Dude all you do in your comment history is shit on pures
---
Relax and maybe don’t go in the wild if you don’t expect to be attacked by somebody
---
I never played starcraft but I'll just laugh and nod, hoping it wasn't a question.
---
Is it really an unpopular opinion though? 
---
Really, what did you do? 
---
It doesn’t sound like it, because a Dev’s job is to add in content to builds.   If there is any issue, QA bugs it and Devs return and fix it.  I know Jagex uses or used Jira from them mentioning it in dev streams, so they’re likely set up similarly to my experience.  
---
Yes, Devs can outright make mistakes, but the entire system relies on competent QA to say “hey this is not working as intended” before it goes live.  
---
I think if I did 1 minute breaks in between days when i do my 5 rep sets I think I would pass out.
---
There are definitely people that can solve those faster than the puzzle solvers. With the pathfinding, it's getting information that you can't get any other way.
---
Does anybody read that shit anyways? 
---
get that rs3 shit outta here
---
Ur suggesting its too many items. Im saying there is not and even if jagex misses one its no big deal. If they missed the worst one, the worst case scenario is 1.25 more damage until jagex patches it out.
---
If they wanted to turn this stuff into a successful esport they'd care but the state of dmm and the tourney states otherwise. 
---
Where is it? Or whats the first one, there's just 75 vids, dont wanna miss out on order 😂
---
Oof still too early, ty
---
Wait people pk with hallys? 😂 
---
That’s so lucky, I wish I had luck like that, I went 50 dry at barrows to receive Ahrim’s hood, now I’m 80 dry and it’s starting to tilt me
---
I dont even know what DDS spec means but I bought a D. Scimi and was real upset when I found out its locked behind a quest lol. 
---
I guess I'm more interested in the role playing aspect like bosses,creature farming, maybe raids. I'm just always afraid I'm not strong enough to do anything worthwhile without sinking gold into food and pots and not make a profit, or just dying and losing armor/weapons I barely afforded. I waited till I was lvl 60 to do Dragon Slayer. 
---
I mean I get going from 1-5, but how did you get 3 levels before noticing at level no 60?
---
Iron
---
Go get 7-8 kill trips with blowpipe and report back to me
---
While it's a dumb move on their part, you're just as bad for not noticing until level 5.
---

---
I've had an account banned for botting major and got it removed 
---
Interesting info, my question though was more about what did the update do that all these guys are pissed
---
I've always leveled up all 3 together, never thought about this advantage cause I'm a noob lol
---
Thanks man, I played a bunch of private servers after quitting RS after the EoC update so I forgot damn near everything about regular rs
---
Looks like a cave horror, spooky
---
Not bad dude. Pm me for my IGN if you want I'd be down to take you bossing once your stats are a bit higher. It's hard to play the game to its fullest alone so I enjoy giving noobs a helping hand.
---
 Whats your quest log looking like?
---
Thanks man, screen capped for reference :)
---
Have a seat dear, so we can discuss the details of this account ban.
---
"Why would you get a good chuckle out of people's missfortune?"
---
You mean how they get a chuckle every time they kill people for a spade?
---
Honestly if there was a poll about the wilderness no longer letting anyone PK in there, I’m sure it would get probably 60-70% in favor. 
---
Seems like people want the wilderness to just be a regular ol’ piece of land
---
Probably a coincidence. They must have code review process in place, with senior developers looking over and testing everything before handing it off to QA.
---
Does it count weekends? 
---
&gt; doing the pledge of allegiance in high school
---
Man I forgot all about that cult shit 
---
They almost never ban anyone for buying gold
---
LOL holy crap I almost spit out my coffee when I saw the pic
---
Cause that’s the only thing I said right? Lol get good bro, they won’t spec you out so easily if you were at least decently good. 
---
Oh no, I completely agree and I never would, but his terminology of BiS is correct is all I was getting at 
---
ah yeah that seems like how they did it :p looks weird imo though, it's like a toddler's cape for adults...
---
To be fair, in a more serious tone, the max cash stack bug was caused by a junior developer.
---
What do you do to contribute to the society?
---
It’s a god damn fallacy in the first place.
---
The downvotes are because you are trying to blame players for something Jagex has no issue's with. There is no rules against using 3rd party clients and the vast majority of players do use them. Your statement was just generally Idiotic 🤣.
---
Ok! I keep hearing about these Barrows gloves so they must be important lol. Thank you. 
---
I'm aware that Pepe is not strictly a Trump mascot. It \*has\* been increasingly representative of the alt-right and the political ideas that have emerged from /pol/, so that's where my confusion is coming from. 
---
My question is whether:  
---
a) Runescape fans are unaware of those ties and just like Pepe,  
---
b) They're aware of those ties and hold those political views or  
---
c) They're aware of those ties and don't hold those views but they don't care  
---
Note that I'm not trying to argue for or against Pepe here, I'm just curious
---
Teleports are nice for it, but the quest takes you in a giant circle around Gielenor, it's pretty cool to walk it, imo. 
---
World 2 for ffa
---
Maybe now you won't be smackin 0s
---
dg was awesome, but keybag took all the elegance out of it
---
Aye nice loot man, I've just been learning lately and am having a blast.
---
Yeah I am baffled as to why they just outright exclude PvP from a lot of these qol updates. They even said in the poll blog that remembering auto cast in PvP could be implemented if people wanted it, but there was no where to really voice that opinion. I’m in the mindset that we should keep everything consistent—especially something like combat. They did the same thing with the spell book filters a while back. It was a mistake then and is a mistake now. 
---
Over under on him buying gold on his "merchant alt" then transferred it to his main.
---
Dmm does need fixing. But they can only do a LAN can't they? To solve no interference 
---
But they ended up great pieces of content that attract players to the game
---
You actually fell for the whole Pepe = MAGA story? My sides
---
January was a good time
---
Decent spec weapon that only takes 30% spec and it can be done from 2 steps away so it isn't expected. 
---
I was permed for 5+ years over being hacked. "Rwt"
---
I then lost another account the same way about a year ago and was emailing them, figured I'd email about my main. I finally got it back, but as for the more recent account, their new rules state that you're responsible, even if your account is compromised.
---
I don't play anymore, so it's whatever. 
---
Y’all are so easily amused. 
---
Because when the people you are fighting only have like 60-70 hp, that little bit of damage may put them in kill range.
---
He can’t burn anyone running the head.
---
Reminds me of the old homepage 
---
MAYBE THEY WOULD START IF JADFLICKS PUT IMPORTANT THINGS THERE BUT HEY MAYBE THEY COULD CODE A BIG RED FLASHING LIGHT THAT SAYS 'HOLD THE FUCK UP, BEFORE YOU RUIN YOUR ACCOUNT AND WASTE CUSTOMER SUPPORTS TIME, YOU SHOULD CHANGE ALL OF YOUR ATTACK STYLES FOR ALL WEAPON STYLES THAT YOU USE BECAUSE WE CHANGED IT TODAY' OR JUST SOMETHING SHORT LIKE 'LOL YOU'RE TRAINING ON DEFENSIVE?' SO IT'S ALSO SOMETHING FOR THE PLAYER TO FIGURE OUT, LIKE PART OF THE GAME, SO IT'S LIKE A PUZZLE.
---
Idk man I just googled it and it has an old statue with a guy holding a sceptre for me
---
Quick way to land a ban on his main as well.
---
Nice! You gonna sell away the amylase crystals?
---
Currently I'm doing seers to 90 with the hard kandarin done, then plan to use the Crystals I get to make stampots for a ton of herblore xp. Currently farming a ton of avantoes for that eventual grind. 
---
Yeah I don't think it's really a big change to dps or anything; pyres just like the number to be 1 because anything bigger than 1 looks bad. Maybe I'm wrong though and it somehow impacts the meta greatly to have 2 Def.
---
It's a really funny thing, now that you mention it. The spread of 'community discussion' made all the hate way more visible. It's in all multiplayer gaming. I'm always surprised how people are able to whine about balancing/mechanics etc. It always was a simple solution for me, I either adapt and have fun or don't have fun and quit. That's it. I really wonder sometimes if people enjoy games at all. 
---
Well, for the mining your own ores/gathering your own stuff part I imagined that that could just reuse copper/tin rocks and stuff that currently in the game, or just give it a reskin to have it be unique looking, but not really.
---
I felt like this was the best way to go about it, because low levels could spend their time building up, while higher levels rushed through the islands. But at everyone one they would still need to get the chest to move on. And maybe as a failsafe to super bad rng, you could come across trading outpost. You can sell your goods for trade tokens (people out at sea don't have to use the same currency as us) for other stuff that could be gotten. Like if you were 10 islands in and found a trading post, you could sell food for rune ore/armor. And because you can't take everything back with you, it could be balenced around itself.
---
But however I didn't think about people like woox who would get to island 1m+. We can't just be throwing raids gear, barrows, etc at him. Maybe make the more powerful gear have a tag, sea bound. If you put it in your take back home chest, there's a chance of it breaking instead, with a higher chance for better gear.
---
The sea bound could because the native's of the land lived by what the sea gave, so in turn, bounded everything they have to the life giving waters. Sea bound effects nothing about the gear, except gives it a chance to be destroyed when taken back as you sever the seas connection 
---
And for clearing an island, I loved the idea you had of grabbing a chest/killing a boss being the only requirement. The ores and fish or whatever else is only there to help in grabbing that chest, or slaying that boss
---
Ok then. 
---
https://i.redd.it/4cknoni4kv8x.png
---
why do all that when he can just go do tob and get 10m/hr?
---
probably cause he fuckin can't yet
---
LMAO bro you're so sweaty you're leaving stains on your chair. Half of the fun of pking is creating rivalries through shit talking other players. For instance, my small team has been in a crash war with another small team for over a month now because we bs'd them because they were retarded. It's all jokes, even though it seems serious through text.
---
Thanks mate!
---
Seems legit
---
If you don't want to get PKed then don't go to the wilderness
---
\*later\*
---
There is a drama
---
I don't really agree with that at all. There have been 11 new quests introduced to OSRS since it came out, 4 that brought a bunch of new content (Monkey Madness II, Bone Voyage, Dragon Slayer II, Making Friends with My Arm), Taste of Hope which doesn't unlock much yet, and then 6 novice Zeah quests that are building towards bigger quests in the future. Monkey Madness II, Dragon Slayer II, and Taste of Hope all can't be completed by pures. So the only major quest-locked content that pures have gained access to in OSRS is Fossil Island, the herb patch + salt fires from Making Friends with My Arm, and some Zeah favor. As for diaries, I believe pures can only fully complete the wilderness diary, which seems fitting. And as for new gear that has come out, I can't think of any examples where something can be used by a pure that does not fit the RS2 precedent. For crying out loud, they even felt the need to poll the defence requirement on blessed chaps rather than just fixing that inconsistency. I wouldn't call that catering.
---
Rargh is entertaining, found him a few months ago. I like the Era locked content.
---
Also what's going on in this thread? Everyone's at 0 or lower. 
---
Go onto twitter of your own accord, it's not phishing.
---
My cellphone only screenshot region locked Ironman 
---
Messaged the last post aswell
---
 never got inv :(
---
He made fun of your bankstanding pure, RIP.
---
Plenty on youtube or google and some old guides from clans come up. Armor itself hasn't really changed for a pure just bis weapons and ammies for the most part. 
---
there's a difference between being livid and being an immature fuckbag
---
Exactly. And there would have been absolutely nothing wrong with any pure pking equipment, maybe entangle was a bit too far, to be kept out of the game. imo 
---
ELI3
---
Ok but if you're in a trio you're going to get 1/3 of the loot as well which makes it really inefficient. How I did Bandos for 5k KC (and how most high level pet hunters do it) is Max range on main and tanking in full justiciar and ely on an alt. That's 1b+ in gear easily and alt requirement, doesn't get much more high level than that. If you're trying to be efficient I'd definitely received getting both zulrah and Vorkath out of the way first
---
90% chance he's guilty of exactly the thing he's complaining about
---
They literally put it in the update post on their website though
---
You seriously think Jagex wouldn't know who is main is, especially after he traded over 400m? 
---
If Jagex wanted to have both accounts banned they would have been banned already. 
---
It's never perfect.
---
btw dev as well
---
Is this a great day for you or what hahaha
---
This was the most American-college thing I've ever read 
---
Something about being forced to play it as a child.
---
x to doubt. They said they wouldn't be rolling back on the update but would require you message them on the forums. 
---
Noticed that too when i went back lol
---
I have a main account with 90 def and thats it fam. Your joke is trash and you should feel bad. 
---
how rare is scroll sack compared to fish sack
---
Yea you sure? 
---
You can easily see if negative xp lamos would negatively affect portions of the game. How is that slippery slope lmao. I love you retards who think you’re smart for using random fallacy’s in your argument.
---
Yh I'm not really looking for money yet don't really have a need for it. And I actually just started Slayer yesterday night, did one task and had to go bed, good way to level combat
---
Nice. I just fished 20k of the little bastards myself and am slowly cooking my way through the stack. Mostly just afk'ing it, but I might have to start 1 ticking to just get 'er done.
---
I've completed 103 Masters exclusively through the completion of other clues. Clues are one of my favorite pieces of content so every time I get any level clue, I complete it. Between raids and other bossing I usually get 1-2 elites per day and get a master or two per week
---
I enjoy how people are calling it a phishing link. If you don't trust it here then check the Twitter for yourself. 
---
Lol. Just be prepared for a mod to cite some irrelevant shit. Afterwards the majority of the sub will take whatever the mod shits out as god's word and proceed to flame you, I've seen it happen too many times.
---
Yh ik I won't buy bonds unless I can get 1mill an hour minimum
---
osrs hacking 90% of the time is either phishing or brute forcing.
---
phishing is the users fault
---
brute forcing is jagex's fault.  jagex needs 2fa, or yubikey integration, or dump the responsibility on email providers and just have unique passwords generated all the time. Fuck, an account lockout for x amount of failed logins would be perfectly acceptable.
---
I’m 95 str 97 ranged 90att/def with rigour 
---
I love the irony here. You’re offended by a hypothetical person taking hypothetical offense. Looks like you’re the one who’s triggered 
---
I tested an hour of San Crabs vs. an hour of NMZ on a 1 def 13 prayer account with BIS gear and the crabs won by like 2K xp/hr. Plus crabs are way more passive.
---
What kind of argument is this?
---
If they can make it more fluid and intuitive that's a bad thing?
---
 just to be a smartass it's not one click, to resetup autocast it's 3-4clicks(mid pvp combat)
---
Electric imps hehe 
---
Jagdesk, where did my 13m attack xp go
---
Maybe an in game announcement like they did after the fact. They could have done it before the update 
---
What i did was force open dugeon doors in a PoH untill i got 9 str then boosted to 15 with str pots
---
Its one of the slowst but probably the most rewarding/fleshed out skill in the game. Theres a reason peaple use the phrase "slayerscape"
---
!Remind me 24hours
---
Wat
---
Funny thing is almost nobody is a pure by default. They've all been playing a main at some point so it's a stupid argument to begin with. A lot of the same guys people do raids etc. with probably also have pures. It's just flawed logic in general.
---
I used to do PC in those German worlds, it was always popping and never lost a game. The day I discovered that was magical. 
---
They embrace the meme
---
Can we get a "my 500 total highest skill of 50 Ironman was banned for botting for some reason" megathread I want him back now
---
!Remind me 24 hours
---
Having 2 defense does not make your account unviable, just autistic kids (literally because ocd) 
---
&gt; is it not useful for hunting black chins? that's the only thing I can think of
---
It is, until you get hit by an ice barrage to gmaul
---
Rofl, yea just go in an wreck havoc. Bandos gear is BIS, for off hand some can argue avernics others may argue Elly.
---
Dealer's choice.
---
While you're polling stuff related to Trouble Brewing, could you make depositing stuff into the hoppers there be automated? The game's pretty fun if you can find people to play with, but the nonstop clicking kinda makes it miserable.
---
Please note autocasting is still 1t slower so skill is preserved. The update you mentioned is also flawed from what i read because BH Pking goes beyond edge pking.(Not sure if it was worded differently in the actual poll)
---
Nevertheless, I always vote skip when it comes to these questions.
---
I did 20k karambwans over the last month with this combo. Pretty easy, very afk! 93-94 fishing, was getting 40k xp/hr when I was paying attention. 
---
It's the same thing as if you had a nice car and someone scratched the side of it; it's still as usable but it's still ruined.
---
Imagine having my dick and/or 1 ball in your mouf
---
Yea, maybe a legends Cape could complete this?
---
Or just regular avas. 
---
I am totally unafected by these kind of problems. But i still voted no on the poll because i expected something like this could happen. I thought the old system where the style is remembered regardless of what you equip was nice. 
---
Lock XP option would be easy, I write code professionally for a living and have messed around with RSPS coding locally on my machine, this is something I’ve implemented within a few minutes. Just allow users to right click the skill, hit lock XP, and then go though each block of code that involves XP gains and add a check to see if user has X skill locked, if so skip XP gain in that skill. Almost like the skill doesn’t exist.. I mean Jagex I can write this code for you if you want lol
---
People are against this because it's very very very private servery
---
Lol same exact thing happened to a low level alt i tried to start almost a year ago, gave up on trying to appeal that since it only has like 6m of stuff on it but gl to you.
---
If a jmod reads this the account name is prototypevi
---
I can’t afford and ely or acerbic white yet... my banks about 260m and most of that is in my bandos/zenytes
---
WHERE WE LEARN TO GRIND AND HEY
---
Yh forsure. I think the best part is you can train melee skills or ranged or mage alongside it. My 2nd task was ice warriors, it took a whole inventory of food to kill 10 ffs I'm going to an easier Slayer master
---
the update would cause all capes to trim if you have &gt;1 99, and would allow all capes to have a trim/untrim toggle. OR, everyone with &gt;1 99 will never be able to have untrimmed cape while new accounts will. its a shitty solution that makes nobody happy.
---
You only want to kill something to make money? you don't want other faster methods?
---
Outdated :( but nice job
---
What happened exactly? 
---
Pures are beautiful and some people just haven't been enlightened yet. No need to insult them. 
---
I can’t afford ely or avernic yet... only about 260m bank that’s mainly in my melee gear plus my zenytes
---
take yer pills nerd 
---
What was the bug?
---
Suffer how lol
---
I agree, not sure why it would need to be polled, wouldn't the only people against it be people trying to hijack accounts? If it were to be added it would be opt-in like with the current security checks, people who don't want it can choose to not use it.
---
In this case though, Jagex should temporarily offer users to have the option to manually set XP to 0 in defense, given they provide their bank pin
---
Upon further review of the account, we discovered you were using pray flicking which is an exploit and your account will stay permed. 
---
Feel free to read the terms of service and make a new account!
---
I'm 100 % with you on this. I just don't understand the people that whine. There's no sense in being butthurt when you know the risk you take by doing wilderness content. 
---
I don't PK at all but I personally enjoy getting chased by pkers. It's one of the only truly risky areas left in the game which makes it more fun IMO.
---
Wow you are a fucking snowflake. 
---
Bump when smackdown commences 
---
Thank you for posting to Jagex Customer Service!
---
You are using Jagex's number 1 (and only) customer service medium, Reddit! Thanks for your post, unfortunately due to budget cuts we cannot review your case unless you:
---
a) cause a community outcry and a few thousand upvotes that would result in bad PR if we don't respond
---
b) you are a famous streamer
---
Thank you again for applying for basic customer service rights to a company that hundreds of thousands of people pay $11 for, may the odds be in your favour! 
---
I mean just to be safe, go to the osrs forums yourself and type the quick find code
---
Pures are just a novelty account that want the world to be based around them
---
I was permanently muted in 2008 for saying "master bait" and my appeal a few months ago was refused. Dunno what else to do, messaged mods here multiple times to no avail. So I just quit the game entirely 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
&gt;Ope  
---
Midwesterner confirmed
---
Just watch a guide
---
I mean pures aren't the smartest in the bunch. They're usually the kiddies who can properly fight main v main so they invent this category to make themselves feel better.
---
I read that as missile-anus
---
I’d rather be able to get to bond money as fast as possible. Then I would work on leveling up. Currently I’m camping Ogress warriors for runite drops and big bones
---
It'd have to be an integrity input if anything, they stand almost zero chance at passing a poll
---
I don't go in the wilderness because I don't want to get killed. Can't really blame people for killing players in the literal player killing area of the game. Wildy is balanced around the risk of death, if they got rid of the PK'ers they'd need to nerf wilderness rewards. 
---
I do break my wilderness rules to go to black salamanders occasionally. I got killed there once, I kind of hated that guy lol. 
---
Wintertodt pretty good gp
---
What do you think if there would be a cooldown on the reset like maybe 3 to 6 months? and if its not hard to implement it could work there are some timers already in game idk if they can use those.
---
&gt; jerking off to the idea of wasting your time
---
Enjoying our time.  Nice try though.  So much ignorant meme shit from you.  
---
This is why you use unit testing and automate merges to check against these tests before pushing. Literally seems like jagex does none of this. Like I get it, they would probably need to hire a person specifically for devOps just to maintain this, but it's almost a billion dollar company. There's no excuse.
---
Make it available for one week for one skill.
---
Most attack xp in a day is 5,362,357 by Pee In Bed
---
Not possible. 
---
dungeoneering was the only thing good about rs3
---
I can turn on "legacy mode" and pretend for a few minutes that jagex didn't throw the game away
---
Selling is usually more looked for than buying
---
Can’t wait to see the Jagflex Slamdown
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah, Runescape is a skill.
---
My OG account from way back in 2002 got banned for macroing.
---
Didn’t log in for god knows how many years, came back for OSRS, trained up for about 6 months to a decent level but then uni started up again and I quit.
---
Came back a year or so later, tried to login and got the “you’re banned” message on the login screen. Can only assume somebody got into my account at some point in those 12 months despite having 2FA.
---
 
---
No option to appeal. Went to Twitter, got cookie-cutter responses over and over again that didn’t help. Came to Reddit cos that seems to be the only place to get Jagex’s attention, explained my side of the story as I’ve done here, and got absolutely railed on by this community for cheating and being sore about it. Was ridiculous.
---
Note that the castle wars halo only costs 75 tickets and the decorative top only costs 40 tickets now.  Also, Mage arena capes can be imbued, making them stronger. 
---
Honest question: is it pretty popular to use WASD to control the camera nowadays? Having used the arrows for 15 years I never thought otherwise until lately when I’d decided it was kinda painful to use those.
---
Barrows is hype. Just did my first runs a couple months ago, and got ahrim robe top on the 6th run. but I found that i was almost breaking even with the amount of prayer pots/food/runs for my trident that I was spending. So  havent been doing barrows anymore. 
---
Did you make this meme with your eyes closed at 2x speed?
---
Yeah but let's be honest how many people are maxed?
---
This area is grey, some pvmers will swear by specific off hands.
---
Dragon defender/crystal shield (imbued)/Dfs will get it done. If solo'ing, all three to see which you prefer. In a team: tank takes shield others take deffender.
---
I’ll always upvote these cause either way it’s fun
---
You bout to be downvoted in this circlejarking hivemind slayer pvm sub. 
---
Surprised you didn't reply. Anyways, let me break this down for you with an analogy. The whole "fuck your feelings" mentality is bullshit.
---
Words hurt emotions just like fists hurt bodies. Someone breaks your finger, and that shit hurts. You wouldn't tell someone with broken legs that they're "ovely sensitive" and that they should just get up and walk on their broken ass legs, right?
---
Imagine being hurt by physical assault with a baseball bat.
---
How about a more positive spin on it? If being hurt by hurtful words is seen as overly sensitive, then what about the opposite? Is feeling happy at nice words overly sensitive? Is being in love with someone overly sensitive?
---
Or perhaps, is it just plain **normal** to be upset when someone degrades you verbally or otherwise.
---
You act like you wouldn't care, but I guarantee you do. It is a normal, human response to feel emotion.
---
Ah, but people like you would've been better off as a stain on your mom's shirt than an actual human being.
---
Trying for 12/11 defense addy gloves boys. Wish me luck
---
Ah ok, I thought that was your point.
---
I can't agree that anyone DESERVES to have their account ruined, just because they don't check the website, however. It sucks and they didn't take full precautions, but deserve is a harsh word there.
---
enjoy lumby. 
---
Authenticator Delay
---
Recovery Delay 
---
These I think should be an absolute must. 
---
I kind of meant is as joke.  
---
I’ll try to elaborate. Runescape is a very old game.   There’s things in the game that could be considered offensive nowadays if if ever got released nowadays.  
---
One instance is where an NPC literally encourages you to commit suicide. There’s more things in there. You might have seen the joke why H.A.M Male members require 20 thieving and H.A.M female members require only 15 thieving. It’s kind of like that.  
---
I’m not triggered whatsoever, it was a poorly executed joke on my part.
---
Agreed but if all the pvmers quit the game would fail and shutdown. If all the pkers quit. Well we'd lose 10% of the game not 90%. At the end of the day all players are important and all types have toxic players, stop trying to be better than others because they enjoy different shit.
---
Jmod roast incoming 
---
Swapping isn't rwt
---
I got hard reading this
---
then finding a good group and going 10 minute dungeons for 6 hours
---
Lol get fucked
---
#&gt;but actually RIP
---
I think so yeah, you can feel guilty about *not* doing something like you say but guilt always has to do with yourself
---
42
---
Remove raids cb penalty plz
---
appreciate the upvote =]
---
i actually love dungeoneering and would love to see it return purely as a minigame and not a skill. having to apply all of your skills and finding players with a variety of skills to cover your weaknesses was fun as hell
---
dank
---
Delicious
---
Their posts are always way to long and filled with litter i never read it... i keep track okay by looking at reddit watching some vids thats enuff time spend for the game but now i HAVE to read these news posts or else i kill my pvp acount lol
---
I see. Interesting
---
Another noob thing I just learnt is that in OSRS you get 100% protect from NPCs
---
I'd always wonder how prayer switching was so much more efficient in OS than in RS3, TIL
---
Does going from 1 def to 2 def really make that big a difference though? You'll still be an  pure right?
---
Drakes are the worst task holy
---
The way they would fix it would be to have 10 different layouts..
---
Which means Runelite would make a plugin and it would be easier then ever
---
A lot of things get wrapped up into RS3, even good things. The anti-RS3 hate is one of those double edged swords, it's great for keeping the developer's honest about the communities demands, but at the same time it means almost anything that isn't pre-2007 has difficulties. The problem being that these reactions aren't always based on actual logic and thought, but the knee-jerk reaction to anything RS3 related.
---
It's hard to say what the majority would want cherry picked from the game so generally you'll just get equal hatred to RS3 updates being implemented even if the average player might agree to it in isolation.
---
I worded this several times and hopefully I made my point properly, I'm going to bed.
---
Make it 42
---
Pure accounts are essentially a way for people to abuse the pvp cb level system anyway so you might as well let them abuse it more by getting items and tanking their stats. It's just a matter of degree since pures already abuse the system
---
Did you even need to poll #2 lol, pretty unnecesary
---
Bitch it took me 15 years of playing to get a pet. Secondly, pets haven’t even existed in osrs for that long??  
---
I think some towns are okay, Draynor Village IMO is pretty good.
---
I've traded large amounts to my alt, never been banned, you obviously did sell gold.
---
Wasn't this a polled update?
---
Fedoras please, M’lady
---
Legit I bought gold from you last week. Wtf bro. Scamming 
---
 !RemindMe! 
---
Both ftw
---
All the osrs "double xp events" are just attempts to phish your username and password
---
Would u be nice to someone ur killing?
---
I posted this in another thread but for a game this size they should have a dedicated devops person that handles automatic unit testing against merges.
---
And it's 3-4 clicks every single time you need to aggro the monsters that shit gets annoying when you have to barrage for hours
---
Bgloves have no def req, just changed my def lvl on turny world and can equip them.
---
While veng needs atleast 65mage and 40def. (It says 65 mage in the chatbox even doe you need 94 to cast it. Someone didn't do a good job in QA)
---
Tested some other stuff on tourny world:
---
Ava's assembler has no def req.
---
Barrelchest anchor has no pray req.
---
Heavy balista has no def req.
---
Couldn't think of anything else good from quests that give def exp somewhere in the questline.
---
Would it be viable with those stats?
---
B ring = hammer, seers ring = magic thingy, archer ring = arrow.
---
By my exceptional powers of deduction, i must therefore conclude that the attack related ring must be a dildo!
---
Course its a fucking sword.
---
Every time, so much originality!
---
No need to flick, they drop prayer pots 
---
Honestly it’ll be easier to just tag the healers. Just focus on switch a prayer then hit one then switch prayers again and so on. You’ll have a hard time outdpsing any healers without nearly maxed range 
---
People who dont die all the time while in the wilderness lol
---
DECENT
---
To me rwt ruins the fun of the game. I enjoy the satisfaction of earning my in game wealth and skills. Buying gp just speeds up that process while taking away any sense of accomplishment. 
---
Then you also figure you’re supporting bots. If people didn’t buy gp from bot sites they wouldn’t have a market and they wouldn’t keep botting/ruining the economy. Ther’d still be people botting on their mains and stuff but if we cracked down on buyers as well as sellers there’d be more of an incentive to buy bonds which support jagex and fund the game. 
---
Yeah, I guess. Just weird how they're asking how much XP was gained instead of asking which skill players want rolled back.
---
I'm using full Saradomin D'hide, Anguish, Blowpipe w/ Addy Darts, Archers Ring, Ava's Accumalator.   
---
Which Bosses are good for range? I'm going for points so i can imbue my slayer helm and archers ring.  
---
Do i use Overloads + Rock Cake + Absorption pots for this method?
---
Not bad, good job
---
F2P, just for funsies
---
!remindme 48 hours
---
It really boils down to efficiency. The guide you saw probably involved using the slayer helm (i), cannoning, high combat stats, great gear, and having a ton of disposable resources. It will be hard for you to achieve all that in a short time period. On top of that you will need quest to use some of the stuff mentioned in the video. Blocking slow xp task requires quest points too. If you can't block task, you have to skip them, which means you have to have slayer points. If you skip a bunch of task you are going to run out of slayer points meaning you have to do the slow xp task. 
---
Overall, getting to the super efficient state has a lot to it, and even then it is still a slower skill to train. Well worth it if you can achieve a higher level though.
---
What’s novelty about having a use 😂 novelty pures are those who don’t pk only 
---
Or completely afking nmz for a couple of weeks without any attention required, ahh the contrasts.
---
People were salty because they formed teams with random shitters who made dungeons a nightmare. I felt the same way until I started doing them with decent players/friends and it became my favorite skill, got 200m xp shortly after.
---
Do you know where one would find those stats?
---
Idk, I'd say 2011, 2012 was when the abomination squeel of fortune ruined any achievement in the game and introduced microtransactions.
---
But yeah, I actually preferred 2011scape to what this game is now. It's nice to have so many bosses, but I miss things like soul split, yak and overloads, as overpowered as they often were. It's still fun, but the player obsession with balance in this game often makes it less fun. Things like blowpipe or twisted bow are fun BECAUSE they are unbalanced as hell.
---
Repost! I was mid read

nmz has ovl+powersurge
---
Yeah cuz u can protect from all attacks. You might want to get ur range up because Idk if maging ahrim is the best idea. Other than that all u need is 50 mage and ur good

Does Jagex rollback unwanted xp gains in the future too?

Might be able to see the weapon they were using when they got the xp but not sure how much they track.
---
Anyhow - I think the possibly 1 or few people who could have happened to ruin their accounts during this small window have lucked out and it's fine if they are fixed if they can't tell the difference.
---
Really though I double anyone ruined their accounts during that window that wasn't related to the changes made

Use dfs(not sure if re anti fire works) and antifire to take 0 damage from breath
---
If the rewards are garbage and if it's not a skill then almost no one would fucking do it and it'd be dead like any other minigame. Something that would take such a huge amount of effort to create on Jagex's part should definitely have very useful rewards.
---
Imagine being an adult and typing this
---
Would it be game breaking to have a right click option on attack styles and disable xp gain on them? But still use them? Obviously still gain xp from quests. 
---
That's just dumb. 
---
Jagex makes mistakes. A player shouldn't be fucked out of their potentially thousands of hours and have 0 chance to appeal it because Jagex is cheaping out on proper customer support. 
---
Oh of course not I definitely agree, but my point is it wouldn't be the first time. The max cash stack bug was caused by code a junior developer wrote.
---
My point is that their testing practices seem to be kinda insufficient for a game of this size...

Ah, apparently they hired him june last year (so 8 months since they have hired a QA tester), it hasn't even been a whole month since they've hired a new content developer.

Appreciate it, brother. :)

---
I agree it should be repolled. 
---
I get the feeling that its first poll didn’t pass not so much because of people afraid of the possible exploits (there can surely be a way to avoid that) but instead because of the large amount of players that just hate PKers and vote no to any update in their favour. 
---
Should be repolled as QoL tbh.

That's not bruteforcing, that's credential stuffing.

Can someone start a 400m exp all skills Morytania 1 tile a day locked HCUIM YouTube series already?
---
1 tile a day movement
---
Morytania locked (it’ll take like 7 years to even gain access, so better get started last year!)
---
Once you hit 200m in a skill you must obtain enough negative lamps to reset back to 0, and then do it all over again
---
Shit would be so cash
---
Make it a random event NPC: You are forced to teleport to Morytania where you see Swampletics and then the video plays on your screen with no X option 
---
Could not have said it any better! Salute to you, sir. Keep up this mindset and many people will eventually follow you!

They hired mod bruno after theater of blood release, I believe that was the last one.

I said 4m/hr max. That means maxed combat and gear so I think it’s very reasonable. For a mid level player it will be much much less. Zulrah is 4m/hr too but mid leveled players get like 1.5-2m/hr
---
I study cs and I agree. Not everything is simple like python. Java and C++ can have RIDICULOUS errors if theres a space somewhere wrong in a file even, could wipe a hard drive if you fuck up bad enough.

I was getting annoyed after about his 4th original post on the reddit. Thought he would go away but instead he blew up and some how won the artist award. 
---
Lol, exactly, you can't explain it because you're trolling. Oh well, rebuilt runelite and am already good to go
---
The issue with polling is of course that sometimes you wind up doing nothing. If you go back and read the posts for the 2-3 previous polled skill additions they are all honestly pretty cool and I don't think OSRS would have been worse to implement them.
---
People of course have differing opinions on what OSRS should be, so typically anything that isn't completely retro or PvM content isn't going anywhere.
---
*Side note: Not only does it have to be PvM content, but it needs to be 2-4m an hour GP. If your creature is like 300-999k gp an hour Reddit is going to say its trash. If Reddit were to be believed Wyrms and Drakes are auto skip and ban, even though for only requiring 64/82 slayer they can make just under a million gp an hour.* 
---
I've said it before, but it makes me wonder what is going to happen to Vanilla WoW. Like are players expecting it to be released as Vanilla WoW and anything post update like 1.4 or w/e it was shouldn't be added? 
---
What then? You run into what OSRS was running into the first two years of the game where people just kinda wind up pvping until bored and the community slowly dwindles. Luckily OSRS started updating or it seems that there is a good chance it wouldn't be here today.

TBH every faucet of this community has some toxic people in them, and this is coming from someone that both pks and does pvm/skilling. Reason it seems like the vast majority of pkers are toxic is that we have a very small but vocal toxic group of pkers.

&gt; I’m just lucky enough that someone was smart enough to realize that it is probably impossible for someone to be hopping back and forth from China to California 6 times in one day.
---
That shouldn't be good enough though. Using VPN's, it's definitely possible to appear like that. I use a VPN myself and while I most off the time play with it on, and thus already moving external IP's basically every time I reboot my PC, sometimes I have it turned off or even relog to turn it off. This makes me appear to move over the place a lot and it shouldn't cause Jagex to lock my account or preventing me from recovering it.
---
Out dpsing the healers is a meme and should not ever be anyone's gameplan. 
---
Sure gear looks good. bp is pretty expensive/per xp for nmz. Could use a msbi. Yeah use rock cake + absorbs for everything. Pray is more afk than using overloads. Absorbs will take up a % of your points tho. &amp; be quick to re overload when you go back up to 50. Rock cake to 51 then overload. The reason i use super combats + absorbs is the absorbs will lasts tell the super combat is out. Could do same with super ranging. Overloads will get you higher xp but require more attention &amp; points.  
---
I suspected that chat bans are not even a thing anymore because it was happening 24/7
---
So he can make 1m "alch self" potions to end his account
---
Im going to say unethical. As much as I want to throw Settled a bone I see 2 problems with this:
---
1. The draw of the location locked content is centered around the added difficulty it places on leveling. It distinguishes the player by being unable to use the efficient methods we have all become accustomed to. This is especially true of a series like Swampletics, as the thought of doing hundreds of temple trekks or lamping to 27 hunter is insane to us, but so glorious to watch someone actually do it. In this way, RL Dev mode has removed a large difficulty and annoyance inadvertently due to the old code in Morytania. This makes the ridiculous amount of trekks he has to do a tiny bit less impressive. It benefits him, but cheats the viewer (granted, only in a very small way).
---
2. Unlike clue scrolls or boss helpers, the bog is ungoogleable. Without RuneLite, clue scrolls can still be googled for the same benefit that RuneLite provides. Similarly, a boss fight like Jad can be learned, and there are visual and audible cues that enable us to know what is coming next, with or without a RL plugin. Settled determined that the bog is procedurally generated. This means that even if it weren't dead content, a guide would do you no good, and you would still have to use the sticks to get across each time. Using RL Dev mode eliminates the need to even pick up the sticks and drastically reduces the time it takes to cross. This is definitely cheating, as it doesnt simply make the activity faster or less idiot proof, it essentially Game Sharks your way across.
---
I doubt this matters, as the rumblings are that RL Dev mode will be removed soon. Id say this is probably a good thing. Who knows what else is identifiable via tile/npc/item IDs. I just hope they add a plugin that will allow the use of the camera feature since it isnt game breaking and helps out content creators.
---
TL;DR: its cheating.
---
You train attack which makes your combat higher and higher eventually which defeats the purpose of a pure. Go fight a 1 def pure with 99 str and no overheads with a tent. It’s not even fun you just eat all fight
---
Right but you still gain attack levels, no use for over 75 attack on a pure
---
Thank you!
---
Are you retarded? Marks of grace are profit period. Diaries dont make them profitable, they are by default.
---
no those are lame and weird and doesn't make sense, simply having customer support fix these things is a viable solution. Other games do it just fine.
---
At twice the cost. $7 for 3.3m or or $7 for 7.5m. Your choice. 
---
A little bit of both

He's saying he likes all the bells and whistles and is being beligerant towards anyone that suggests anything against/diminishing RL. Btw I love RL, it makes OSRS look like an actual decent game

Don't like the sandstone one. Prefer the initial polled use a chisel on sandstone to make sand. Needs buckets in the inventory for this to work.

Could of been a special chisel or mini quest for this to be unlocked for the player.

It wasn’t bad, I was watching a YouTube tutorial on it while in-game. Unfortunately I was the only one trying so by the time I gathered all the materials and lit the burners the game ended rip

OOTL, which change made pures get defence xp?
---
Just make them not able to wear them, disable untradables like firecape until they complete the content again on new stats.
---
God these absolute paradoxs you guys think you've made are always so simple 
---
That's kind of a stretch right? I mean, it's possible to make it to endgame with a maxed account and never learn anything about merching. It's not intrinsically tied to other parts of the game like skilling/questing/bossing. I'd imagine it's entirely possible to learn how to merch with very little in game knowledge/skill.
---
That said, I'm not saying that it isnt also a possibility that he was rwting, just that his in game stats being an indicator of more game knowledge doesnt really seem to be, in and of itself, evidence of that.
---
Not always. You can do a full brute force. I. General you would use a password list though
---
Let me know how it goes please :D
---
Not against talisman but sand method is more expensive than charters and is only slightly faster at 99 mining while 3 ticking
---
This was polled twice I believe and failed both times because “pker bad”
---
Uhh magic shortbow with amethyst arrows is at 50 plus it has a nice spec. 61 would be ideal for rune crossbow. U don't want to mage him cuz ull just be wasting prayer pots and runes.
---
Move your overlays by holding alt. Probably have two on the same spot. If not that, adjust the size of the boxes and how many rows/columns you can have in the Runelite settings (wrench, runelite in the plugin list.)
---
Apart from that in not sure what to tell you, don't use boost prayer indicators personally. Feels like too much screen clutter for not very useful info. 
---
It's 2019 man, no kink-shaming!
---
Someone needs to be that guy, but slayer  is similar stats to adamant scimitar.
---
Nah... one it would lower the value of certain bars and items used for training. Two most people do not just drop staves and decent armor.  This would devalue gathering skills and cause a massive market crash.

Having graduated college somewhat recently, my economics professor would be outraged that I didn't think of bond price in game. Idk how they could make bonds more appealing...

Dungeoneering post release was the most fun I've ever had in runescape. Lots of puzzle solving, liked the fact that all skills were involved and felt useful, bosses were nice, rewards were nice. But honestly for me it felt like a better version of runescape.

“That's why their initial design was -50xp per lamp, 10 times per account or something. You can't possibly get barrows gloves and lamp your way down to 1 def again.”
---
This guy knows
---
Noooooooooooooo! the extra CB levels are just not worth it. Honestly if 2 def bothers you too much just go zerk.
---
Seems to be what happened here haha.  This could've been seen after instantly attacking an npc after implementing code. 
---
Back with 3bo and #keyers, selling off floors was so profitable.
---
Waste of time? It takes less than a full second to tab to the attack style page and back to whatever you were on before. And some of us don't feel the need to write down what attack style we were last using when we logged out.
---
I just checked warped floors release date and they were in late 2010. I always thought they were in late 2011 for some reason. Also I thought EoC was 2013 but it was actually in late 2012. So you're right, 2011 was definitely the peak. 
---
And you're bang on with the prayer/summoning/herblore. Overwhelming opinion on this sub is those things are OP. But is was actually really tough to achieve 95 prayer, 92 herb, and 96 summoning back then for a casual player, even with the double exp weekends. 
---
I meant the guide made it the slowest skill to level, 300 hours is what they put down so the 2 weeks sounded super quick to me.
---
But it depends I just got an ice warrior task which I'm too low leveled for so it's gonna take a while.

Only 500 more kills to fm cape

People make rash decisions, his behaviour is inappropriate yes. However i'd argue the fact his emotions got the best of him, regardless he didn't go overboard, simple use of that word should not exclude him of having hundreds if not thousands of hours reverted due to a mistake from the company.
---
Yeah so that was back in June of last year, 8 months ago, whereas they've hired another developer less than a month ago. That's not really a good thing...
---
Some people do or they wouldnt still send so many scam links out 
---
That’s not how this meme works, hes supposed to be oblivious to the situation 
---
I wouldn't mind Jagex spending a year to develop DG and releasing a couple of qol updates in the meantime, as long as DG made it into the game. Doesn't really has to be a separate skill either, a minigame would suffice.
---
“I would never do such a thing and never have”
---
At least try to word it to make believeable... I never understood why people think acting robotic and innocent will help people believe your lie
---
Note: rfd gloves got an added def req when someone glitched mm to be undone and had rfd complete. Jagex added them as a failsafe. 
---
Still veng tho. But if u dont edge pk thats worthless
---
What an awful mechanic. Way to release dead content on release and tie it to an already broken, borderline game-breaking tick abuse exploit.
---
JaGeX needs to get their head out of their ass and fix 3 ticking and replace it with something more dynamic. This is a game integrity issue if it is affecting future polls and content which an overwhelming majority of players will enjoy. The new Drew will only appeal to 0.001% of players which is not what people voted for.
---
If one of the previous quests in a series has defense it already locks it so they don't need to add defense shit to the later ones. 
---

I suppose they could allow you to get cosmetics with it but that would mean fally riots til the end of Oldschool (and also something I myself would be very much opposed to).
---
The T80 dungeoneering weapons was part of what ruined the game. Contrast that design decision to current upgraded whips. Dungeoneering weapons were free, untradable, and skill locked. 
---
Where did I ever say that we were writing down what attack style was used?
---
The vast majority of pures just leave it on strength(aggressive-rapid) 
---
Sorry that bugs make you butthurt, fuck off. 
---
I'm a bad memer but what would've been better?
---
Think of it as a business. They have 90% of users buy with whatever price they want, if they make it closer in price to gold selling sites the maybe you get some buyers to just do it legit, but you lose money overall.
---
Plus I think you just tell yourself that you only buy gold because jagex charge too much, but even if it was closer in price you would do it the illegal way
---

I'll go for 61 thanks for the tips man. I enjoy having a goal in mind it's makes it so much better
---
Very cool statement thank you 👍🏽
---
I know it’s super entertaining to see these posts on Reddit... but can we just poll removing the inability to repeal some bans...?  It just seems silly to not be able to question a ban. 
---
I’d support being able to reset a stat provided suitable restrictions were placed on it. Maybe with a time delay and required 2 factor authentication too
---
Any task from any tier of any diary will reset multiple part tasks
---
Clicking it from your inventory sets the offer at market price. Clicking it from your history would set it at the price that you previously sold one at. 
---
Buying currently works that way, whether you click a buy or sell offer in your history. 
---
TBH.... Seeing as they literally sell GP already in the form of bonds, I wouldn't be against them selling gold... Bonds can still be tradeable and shit... But selling packages of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mil would do nothing major 
---
Enjoy the popcorn while you can
---
WOAH WOAH WOAH STICK TO THE STUFF U KNOWWWWWW
---
So you're essentially requesting them to add in completely replayable quests?
---
Not to mention if I got a no prayer firecape, accidentally got 2 defense because of a bug, reset my defense to 1, and was no longer able to wear the firecape you can bet I'd be pissed. That's unfair.
---
This is why people like you would make awful game devs. Balancing shit isn't as easy as you think it is.

Maybe he swapped a lot more cash to osrs, to then used that to merch a fair bit of wealth? Idk I'm just as curious as you

You need to google it with American English (scepter) to have the OSRS image appear.  At least you do on a computer that hasn't ever searched anything OSRS related.

Been saying this quiet of bit lately. The pussified death mechanics caused the hate because they got used to being babied and getting to keep all their shit.  I enjoyed the game so much more when the death mechanics were more punishing.

Just be careful. This guy said he did this to other clans, just be careful.

I’ve got 2 in 300kc. Gl 
---
I got banned for the same thing (I think). It was when I first came back into the game after 10 years and was fairly new to osrs (like 3 weeks). I didn't even know macroing was a thing, so obviously I didn't know how prevalent it was. I felt so isolated because I couldn't appeal and couldn't reach out to anyone, and when I tried to talk about it on Reddit everyone said I was macroing. 
---
But your op was talking about elite not easy.

thanks

&gt;As for diaries I believe pures can only fully complete the wilderness diary, which seems fitting.

It would be fitting but pures can’t fish the lava eel so they can’t finish the hard diary.

In my experience, g maulers were never really good to begin with. You have terrible accuracy and you are all defendant on a lucky max hit with the maul. Anyone that fights you knows what's going to happen so they safe the whole fight.
---
I had a gmauler back in 2008 or so and it seemed almost impossible to get a kill if you weren't ranging into the maul hit and you had to be extremely lucky for the maul to max hit.
---
Tbh I’d love at least 100

Wouldn't work because your mom already has everyone's cum.

Honestly this is a really good idea.

I love how you guys are not acknowledging how I am the victim here. I'm literally being shamed for jagex causing this glitch, it's seriously not fair
---
Why would someone do something wrong, get banned, then come to Reddit and call it bullshit if a mod can literally check logs and call OP out. I am not dismissing the people calling OP a liar. I just can't imagine someone being stupid enough to try that.
---
Same shit happened to me. It got banned during a period I wasn't playing. Came back, banned. Go to check and appeal, can't.
---
Then jagex did those few occasions when you could submit your account to be reviewed or whatever, and they unbanned it lol. It's a bit pathetic really but oh well.

Recent update killed Volcano Mine for Ironman. Currently, a player with 97 Mining can receive 6.5k Ash/h, while  only 365/h participating in VM. Could the shop be updated to make Ash cost 3 points? This would allow a player to receive nearly 5k Ash/h and make VM a viable option for Ironman again.
---
Since you're 55 magic you could consider training magic "passively" through high alchemy - while you're travelling you can just alch an item now and again, the XP adds up over time. High alchemy gains a little bit of profit, probably only around 100-200k an hour. It's not much but at least it's not costing you money is the idea.  
---
Good items that are typically slightly profitable or at least don't lose you money are rune armour/weapons, dragonhide bodies, adamant platebodies, single element or lava battlestaves, and onyx bolts(e) - make sure onyx bolts are enchanted, because regular ones lose money.  
---
Course there's other items in the game that you can do, but for me, these were quick to buy when I was doing them and lasted long enough for the 4 hour buy limit that I didn't need to look into other items. Just be patient when it comes to buying them since you don't need them immediately.
---
I'll try and give some suggestions on what to plant.   
---
Allotments - once you're 47 I would suggest you do watermelon seeds, because using 15 of them on compost bins makes supercompost rather than having to use a compost potion on top of volcanic ash. It's just a little bit more convenient, plus they get more XP than the lower level stuff.  
---
Until then you can do strawberries or sweetcorn. strawberries give more XP per harvest but the downside is they cost a little extra to protect them, as you have to pay 1 basket of apples each time you plant them (about 1500 gp), while with sweetcorn, if you have a scarecrow in your flower patch that will give it a 0% chance of becoming diseased, no need to pay the farmer. both the items are about the same value, 140 gp each. 
---
Also you can use any farming produce on the tool leprechaun and he'll turn it into a noted item. Makes a bit more money if you get more than 15 items for the compost bin. If you find yourself not getting enough items to fill the compost bin consider using ultracompost, as it raises the minimum yield of a crop to 6 items, so 2 allotment patches will get at least 12/15 compostable items needed but most of the time more than that.  
---
If you are not using your flower patch to protect your allotments, plant limpwurt seeds. They're only 50 gp each while limpwurt roots are around 1000 each.  
---
For herbs you're fine with ranarrs. Once you get snapdragons you can do them if you like, they have a similar average profit but they give like 3 times more XP than Ranarrs. I wouldn't worry about it too much.  
---
Hops you'd want to do yanillians. They're about 1k each but can sometimes go a bit higher, and they have a really high yield in my experience. I'm probably getting like 15-20 on average and the seeds basically cost nothing. Definitely worth paying for the protection and using ultracompost on. It's about 2k gp to plant considering protection and ultra but you're guaranteed at the very least, 6k in harvest but often much more.  
---
For bushes you don't have to if you don't think it's worth your time, since you can't plant janger or white berry bushes yet which are the money making ones, and they don't give much XP per harvest. I'd just plant dwellberries without protection and hope they grow since they're only 2gp a seed, but the protection is quite expensive.  
---
Regular trees are completely optional, the higher level ones are an expensive method for people who just want the most XP possible. Acorns and willow saplings are pretty cheap, though it's up to you to decide whether the extra time is worth it. Personally I'm just too lazy.  
---
When / if you have access to Fossil Island (Bone Voyage quest), there's 3 hardwood tree patches next to each other. They take a long time to grow (around 3 days) but are cheap and give high amounts of XP. Protection is expensive so it's less costly to just take your chances and only use whatever compost you have on them.
---
No, he said that he traded 400m *to his main*, not from his main. 
---
He says it right here:
---
&gt;I did trade about 400m of wealth to one account, and it was **to my main "Xutten"**. This account I still use, the money is still on the account 
---
An outfit for an upcoming event has been added to the Costume Room in players' POHs 
---
http://services.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/6th-birthday-and-qol?oldschool=1
---
He said his friends play casually, so they would probably be in the mid level range, which is the prime demographic to get anal raped by pures. You aren't gonna survive with your shitty 60 hp when these fucks are pulling ice barrage into ballista bolts.
---
No idea why you're using PvP as a baseline for player skill, either. The only really difficult shit is tribridding, which a majority of PKers don't even take part in.
---
I pk anyone I see.  Regardless if they are above me or below me. If I die I die. I got the bank to keep coming back and enjoying pking. Good try though my little npc.  
---
"0 risk meta" and "hunt us down". I bet you have never hunted anyone down and can't even f key to switch tabs.  Not even pker risks 0. Enjoy that meme too. The protect item is typically for one expensive item such as a ko weapon.  
---
Pet is 1/5.000 and d axe is 1/10.000. Good enough for me lol.
---
I wouldn’t trust anything they said with a username like that.. 
---
Yeah but then the issue becomes that there are two passive methods for gaining sand. I agree that an active mechanic is necessary to replace the current methods but the rates proposed makes this particular one dead on arrival. 
---
Oh mb so you did.
---
I really don’t think it falls to the player to have to anally check something they really shouldn’t ever need to check.
---
That is a system failure as a whole, blaming the player for the system change and mistakes is pretty not great.
---
I have had pures for three years and am a top 2k bher, I never check it because it never changes. I also do not have 2 defence on any of my accounts, it is simply a waste to check.
---
Woah what they did that? Man I missed out 😑
---
Yeah I am aware. Tho I don't think the revs idea was fitting for the content, but I still voted yes on both occasions.
---
Right. It's not even like this is some unexpected corner case. This would literally be the first issue that I could foresee happening, and would make sure I had plenty of unit tests to avoid this. 
---
You could also lower other stuff, like your prayer after desert treasure
---
If they were to add negative xp lamps they would have to store what xp you get from quests so that you could never go below that number.
---
It’s good for tanking gwd too 
---
Because this is a freak accident.
---
It's like calling bullshit on someone dying in a car accident and your counterpoint is that you drive all the time and haven't died.
---
and make it sound like a dying rat
---
People weren't buying sand from shops though, if you're buying from shops then there's no reason to use giant seaweed as you can just hop at charters for better rates. The thing to compare this to is the ~2300 buckets of sand you can fill an hour at yanille.
---
Yes it is, you can attack vasa on exact tick you can without losing a tick switching to rapid with bow
---
also vanguards in solos are stupid easy now..
---
More attack means you hit more on higher Def... And if you're 75 attack you will definitely be fighting zerkers. Think of the gold sink for people gaining attack levels then buying negative xp lamps to reverse it. They wouldn't fight other 1def pures because normally 1def pures don't risk much money. This would be used for 1def high level accounts to have a chance against zerkers. Which is actually a cancer match up. 
---
You have to drink an attack potion before you can deal damage and reach level 1
---
If it ain't broke don't fix it. This was his point. I think you got lost in your mountain of words... that's all he meant.
---
Buying gold too is RWT
---
People unironically saying people deserved this if they didn't check their combat style upon logging in, fucking lol.
---
 !Remind me 24hours 
---
If it affects combat level then it can put you at more of a disadvantage. The main thing though is having to see it everytime you look at your stats. It looks a lot less clean and players will go out of their way to call you out on it because "Lol account ruined, start over" is practically a meme.
---
It's like you missed the hundred other posts about this very topic 
---
brute forcing is very common. Infact, much easier on runescape that other places. Last time I checked, passwords on runescape aren't even case sensitive, which literally rules out hundreds of thousands of attempts.
---
This is why I am afraid to alt.
---
bet is or cleverbot, dont bet against people who break the rules and then waste everyones time. The fact that you know what middlemen are and bring it up just shows ur from the rwt scene. 
---
Bro i have a ironman and ultimate ironman thats near maxed and on my uim i dont enter the wildness because of the risk, why? Because the wildness is a place without rules. Yes im also a pker and i pk everyone i see. Even clue hunter and guess what, even if you say i habe npthing i beat the shit out of you. There are dumb people that take there entire rune stack and i can make easy money of them because they need to 'sit' if you actually have balls meet someone in wildness and pk even if they are clue hunters and you will see it makes fun and the heart beating moment you see a another pker that carry possibly a risk with them and you can make money. What i mean, there is no rules in wildness, if your a clue hunter and die, i still enjoy. So sit
---
You think I tell myself that I'd buy gold legit if it were cheaper but if it really were I'd still buy gold illegally? Is that meant to be a general statement as to how you feel the majority of RWT consumers think or are you just saying I in particular am a pos by insinuating I RWT and will regardless?
---
It's obvious once you notice the trend even once. Babied really is the perfect term. Even mentioning bringing back old death mechanics or any type of increased risk makes them start screeching about people DDoSing entire worlds to make someone die to loot their.
---
Even though that shit barely happened and LizardSquad kept destroying the servers for years after the new death mechanic was introduced. They just don't want to go back to actually paying attention and not being able to bring max gear for everything. The insane risk at any moment really was one of the things that made RuneScape unique, and the wilderness is the only place to find it anymore. 
---
&gt;I pk anyone I see. Regardless if they are above me or below me. If I die I die. I got the bank to keep coming back and enjoying pking.
---
lol if any of this were true you wouldnt be camping skillers in wildy
---
like i said there are real PVPers out there but the fact that you got so triggered by my post tells me you're not one of them
---
Farming yanillian hops is pretty fast and decent money, 5 minutes for 50k up to 100k, chronicle teleport, camelot teleport, and glory to draynor are needed.
---
Bruh how is this even real lol
---
Just check what you’re doing before you do something haha
---
“Ruining my account” HAHAHA
---
‘Knowning’
---
Or just post in the sticky on the forum and have them reset it back to 60...
---
Ditter "SO LUCKY he didn't die from 80 hp" bitter
---
Very economically illiterate comment. The prices of bonds are determined by supply and demand, therefore 3rd party rwt is always going to be cheaper than buying legit bonds from jagex. 
---
Yet another blunder due to Jagex's lack of a real customer support system. How embarrassing can this company be?
---
I see you too are a 9 hunter pure
---
I see more toxic pvmers then pkers. And crashing me in pvm is most toxinc you can go. Comes from a ironman
---
Yep, totally possible.
---
Happened to me on mobile release. My maxed tank is now rs3 and I logged out after 2 minutes. Still have bunny ears though which is nice. 
---
Everything here is just our opinions. This is an online forum. 
---
I cooked tuna/lobster till lvl 86 and from then on swordfish. Lobsters aren't recommended though because they were a huge loss at the time. If you time it alright you can make even a little profit with cooking.
---
For smithing, I made lots of steel nails. They are by far the least amount of gp/xp
---
Void is good to get in general. Good budget option, and the elite version is useful at a few places. You’ll need a BGS for Vork, ideally a Spec restore pool as well. 
---
Either the account you're thinking of played before OSRS and that's what you're remembering, or you signed into the wrong account.
---
Imagine how many pures that don't use reddit or twitter just quit after today's amazing fuckup 
---
As a sellable, it's incredibly dependant on whether it can keep it's value. It'll be worth a ton in the weeks after it launches, but given the niche use-case and proposed usage limits, I don't know if it would stay that way. For Ironmen, it's a junk drop either way.
---
If you chainmace revs with salve you get 80k xp/hr and 2m. Very worth it. 
---
Imagine being this much of a rat. 
---
Would devalue normal membership subscription tho that is the other hand, and 5$ ish for a month of membership is never going to happen because it's a bad business strategy

Might have to test this out for Lunar Diplomacy during the “Dream” state where there’s an 8x4 grid that requires trial and error. May knock off an extra 5 minutes 😁
---
!remindme 24 hours
---
All you are doing is repeating memes since you've clearly never done any pvp content. I don't really give a fuck about what you believe. You're some npc equivalent pvmer on the internet.  I do edgeville, pvp worlds, and check hunting spots.  These hunting spots also have other pkers to you ignorant fuck. 
---
You're on the wrong sub.
---
The real issue is that it's necessary to use Reddit as a support forum h in the first place.
---
So everybody just follow me
---
Pretty sure there's a forum thread you can post to to get it fixed. Granted I did it back in 2012 or something so it might not exist anymore.
---
How do you raid in RuneScape? Aren’t we all technically of the same race?
---
You still have to change it whenever you log in. They only "hotfixed" attack styles giving wrong experience. You still have to change attack mode to strength mode. Very stupid hotfix on their part.
---
It should be placed in bh shop like loot key scroll aswell.
---
Everyone knows what a fucking middleman is lmao. You say that as if the term "Middlemen" came from OSRS. They exist IRL too, so your statement is actually so ignorant lol.
---
Never blamed the players, I already said this was Jagex's fuck up. The fact that they're rolling back effected accounts proves that too. That doesn't change the fact that some people could have avoided this issue by doing a check that takes virtually no time.
---
Maybe I'm just more cautious than most people. If I know something is easy to fuck up, I check it from time to time. Even without glitches like this, it rules out user-error on my end. I don't trust myself to have never misclicked while playing.
---
weirdly enough, if you join the hardcore ironman cc, it ends up being way more casual and discussions fly about anything.  And nobody cares what or how you do anything.
---
I guess the better question is which untrimmed cape looks the coolest haha
---
I’m on mobile, my pages are shorter maybe? That could be why if they are shorter
---
U need only 85 craft...
---
Use ground item plugin from runelite.

How do you even get hacked twice with two different accounts? I'm not sure I could if I tried. Up your security dude...
---
Have you considered the fact that the *rs official forums* are their customer support outlet here? Twitter is just another means of spreading the word. They have their own forums, it's not their fault nobody uses them. 
---
It is true bc in this case if its cheaper its closer in price so, same thing. 
---
Everything else, I couldn't agree more. I'm just trying to spur discussion on how Jagex can more effectively combat RWT, bc im not smart enough to propose a working solution.
---
Could a bronze pickaxe spawn be added to MLM? I always forget my pickaxe after doing a farm run and can't even get to the agility shortcut without one
---
Theres a very easy way to not make this a thing on reddit though.
---
Have a customer support section. Only way to contact jagex is twitter or reddit.
---
Most bans/mutes get put so you cant challenge them.
---
Sure 90% of the reddit posts are smackdowns but for the 10% that were incorrect bans, without reddit, they dont have a chance.
---
I don't think making anyone suffer is pleasing either. 
---
The game should be updated, shouldn't have to rely on clients for everything. It is qol month 
---
So you just assume that I'm one of those people that wishes the game would just stay the same and never change or evolve? Great assumption. You really nailed my way of thinking when it comes to osrs.
---
I think that different items should have different timers proportional to alch value. For example supplies such as food and potions should only last 1 minute but expensive gear should last up to 10 minutes
---
Smackin \*Less\* Zero is more like it
---
Had a rando call me this when i wouldnt give him my boots for some reason. 
---
Enable 2FA On email and account. Use bank pin. Big RIP
---
if the character is still logged how EXACTLY do you distinguish a DC, nice idea but flawed.
---
They deserved it for being pures.
---
yep:) unless you're wearing a ring of wealth, it is possible to land on the RDT and then roll nothing. Ring of wealth removes the empty rolls on the table

Didn't take BGS with me cuz it didn't help

There was a post on here earlier that showed what it would look like, but I cant find it anymore. I'll PM you if I bump into it again.
---
I make more money from 1 kill on my main than nearly an hour of pking on the pure. 
---
"my kill times are slow"
---
"i dont take bgs"
---
"why are my kill times slow"
---
What's with all the censoring?
---
You're right. Jagex may not know this is an issue because no one brings it up because people now use plugins that help out. 
---
couldnt said it better &lt;3
---
That's why I knocked out 99 fishing first so I can, just machine gun karambwans lol
---
Amazing.
---
I thought it was fairly common knowledge that instances tend to give you a random when you exit. This has been a thing for fire capes for ages, you almost always get a random on exiting. People with full inventories would have their cape dropped on the ground and then get mime teled and lose it, was one of the great fears back in the day. 
---
It's cool that he's actively trying to exploit this for lamps but the concepts he covered have been known anecdotally for a hot minute haha
---
Nonono ive used BGS but it didn't increase the time so I decided to rather take more food with me
---
Dragon dagger. The most runescape weapon of all time
---
Same thing happened to me. Got 2fa thinking I was safe. Returned to osrs banned with my account robbed. Got a few mining levels but I lost the bond I was saving and my graceful
---
For real it wouldn't be a hard photoshop.
---
Wait... But isnt prayer flicking the only way to feasibly get the fire cape?
---
It's almost like the game doesn't revolve around iron men? You chose to play a style that makes it harder to obtain items and skills. Broken record and all i know but still it doesnt make it any less true. The game will not and absolutely SHOULD not ever be balanced around anything other than the main accounts. I dont see why ironmen chose to play a restricted version of the game only to complain about the mode being..restricted..I mean c'mon now.
---
And here you are casting judgment on someone with barely any facts. Let's say he is lying. His case gets reviewed and they figure it out. He still stays banned. If he is telling the truth then he would be unbanned. How hard is that?
---
hahahahahahahaha are you serious? The servers know when packet loss occurs, the ONLY reason you stay logged in is combat, and that's to prevent cheating death.
---
Imagine being offended by pixels on your screen not even directed at you. snowflakes bring on the hate
---
Must be photoshop
---
some people would prefer to spend a few more dollars to ensure their account doesnt get banned I'm sure.
---
I loved Dungeoneering. It was hands down my favourite skill to train, mostly because i was able to do it with friends. Ofcourse, you can do skilling together and some Pvm with friends, but to me it's nowhere as exciting as Dungeoneering was. Wouldn't mind it at all if they released it as a skill to OSRS, or if not that, at least as some sort of a progression-based minigame with some nice rewards. Would no-life the hell out of it. Plus it gave me kind of a more accomplished feeling when i was able to do something in the dungeon that my friends weren't able to do because i had a higher skill level than them, with raids i just don't have that feeling. It felt like the skills i had were actually used, now it's basically just to level them up and try to max. Idk, that just might be me.
---
I forget the rates but after I got the graceful set I swapped to werewolf straight after cause i didn't have the requirements for improved cammy tele
---
Noticed a considerably higher exp rate- 55k with stamina potions + paying attention. I remember it being roughly like ~50% faster which is how i justified pots. And it just kept getting higher and higher rates with each level/ the milestones written in guides. This was without another account too.
---
I for sure remember at least like 58k an hour at ~65+, and 61k an hour past the 70 milestone
---
One time I was hitting 68k in the 80's as well
---
I feel like Zuhaar's art has been the same shit ever since he started posting. And yeah, OriginXYZ is in the same boat with Zuhaar, posting shit wank material.
---
&gt;An outfit for an upcoming event has been added to the Costume Room in players' POHs 
---
They didn't say that they added the set itself, but I assume they wouldn't add a slot to the Costume Room without also adding the set.
---
I think Twitter works
---
Throwing him under the bus, and jumping in front of it too. I like your style
---
he forgot his username though
---
Think that's exactly what they want tho. These posts often show that the jagex banning system is broken making it harder to say "our system works properly"'. We hear it all the time, "go play twitter/reddit lottery to get your account unbanned", probably trying to fix that so it stops being a thing
---
One of my favorite NPCs. Looks great!
---
Do you pk at all? 50 attack is THE meta build
---
You got banned got using an autoclicker. Bot detection doesn't work like that. 
---
Blowpipe is stupid op for a 5m weapon but atleast it is quite expensive to use at current prices, compared to chaotics
---
Aaah. Makes sense. 
---
Ironmen are objectively the best type of account and actually require skill to play on. Nice try.
---
D bow and d hal something, always loved the looks on them, oh and crystal bow 
---
They probably planned on it but are putting out fires since $11 doesn't help QA. 
---
Lol reeeeeee thanks.
---
Fully think death mechanics should revert to how they used to be brings back the fun aspect of watching someone die lol 
---
support.
---
this place pisses me off every time i have to go there for a clue and i forget pickaxe lol
---
Are you wearing the gloves and range helm too lol
---
thats what it looks like, but if thats the case, then the guy wouldn't be making this post. 
---
Did you use the double XP promo code? I think there's a weekend coming up too
---
Some good photoshop on the text asking what helm then. 
---
Good bait
---
Ofc
---
T. Some dumb faggot whose bank isnt more than 10m. Kill yourself.
---
When you beg jagex to remember spell auto cast because your fingers are too small to press fkeys. 
---
buy and unpack feather packs 
---
Sell for 3-4gp on GE    
---
You can make up to 600k/hr
---
Itd be super handy for the prospector clue scroll step aswell!
---
You go to the Falador Party Room. It's right below. 
---
Damn that’s a nice acc 
---
osrs is not against easysscape at all,
---
the original death timer is much needed but todays community is too soft for it
---
I miss dungeoneering so much. PepeHands
---
People could still max their combat, get a clear advantage over pures / berserkers / etc when doing the inferno / ToB / Raids for items, or just money making in general, and then reduce their stats back to the desired levels to have a finish pure / zerk / whatever build, while still having had access to all best money makers / best gear upgrades. its not as simple as it sounds really
---
Maybe you should have used a chisel and been more delicate instead of ashing everything with a hammer
---
was a nice acc
---
Could be an alt or talking about something else.
---
Unfortunately it won't happen and the only talking point will be "but muh ddos".  It's caused the game to go downhill and is now a major crutch and part of the babying that has created ezscape.   
---
jagex has better protection now and shit happens
---
TB didn't have anything to do with RuneScape tho.
---
guess im owned
---
fair. The wiki says the items were released today though. 
---
Chatting while you bot doesn't mean you didn't bot. Reports flag an account, they don't auto ban it. You got banned for botting because you botted.
---
Jagex is reverting all the pures who were affected by the bug but you're welcome I guess
---
Oh no
---
You're right, it is a shitty reason. 
---
rs3 has a better detection system than osrs for rwt 
---
Whip is prob more iconic than dds
---
no it isn't. 
---
Welcome back serene 
---
Lmao that could be hahaha
---
Eh, while I get where you're coming from, are you really enjoying yourself when you PK a guy doing a clue for literally less than you wasted in runes/ammo?
---
There's no real fun in fighting a guy who is pretty much defenseless and has no desire to fight. 
---
No it isnt. Literally anyone playing during the games release would tell you why its a bad idea and objectively terrible game design.
---
You're a life saver, thanks man!
---
Seeing this display this morning actually messed with me for some reason. I got super nostalgic walking through that museum, and remembered lots of time when I was a kid spent with friends that I never see anymore. Simpler times indeed...
---
He could have experience merching in other, similar games.
---
Just got my account banned three weeks ago after not playing for a month because it said I was boting, no appeal. I have never used a bot through all my time playing RS. Though that was one of the most salty experiences I’ve had, realizing all the grinding was for nothing.
---
No people just didn’t read
---
Idk the current penalty, so maybe id agree with it being lessened depending on what level it's at currently. However level 3s or 30s should NOT be able to leech a raid and get same benefits. Theres a reason for CB penalties and its so you can't abuse boosting mechanics. 
---
Honestly i wish people thought for half a second about things before suggesting them all willy nilly. Again, if you are level lets say 115 and that gives you penalty then yes I agree..it should probably be lowered to 105 ish.
---
But no, level 40s free loading should still have a penalty. You could make the case for level 70s or something that are pures and have BiS gear who actually provide some sort of help - and in that case id say to rework the penalty based on your usage in a raid or something like that. 
---
You are right of course but it feels kinda pointless at xarpus.
---
You could be the one to add the page :D

You need to hit 45-75 of total specs with bgs for it to noticeably help

You keep asking for help but refuse to understand that bgs is critical for using bp on vorkath

You are correct. But I'm assuming he means autoclicking it, like you'll see at NMZ lobby.
---
The one-time Saniboch fee should be paid in Trading Sticks...

then get 99 ranged
---
Exactly. It’s so heartbreaking knowing you have to start again from scratch. The only reason I did was because some friends and I decided to make fresh accounts and play together. Wouldn’t have bothered ever playing again if it weren’t for that.
---
Are you ok?
---
true. lets wait and see.
---
My friends gave me gold and in exchange I play the game the way they want me to. Would that be banable?
---
I wouldn't even call that a nooby question, honestly. Its relatively new content and the answer isnt as straightforward as it may seem. I'm talking about the hundreds of people who always seem to have the dumbest questions that are more quickly answered with a google search. I cant think of any off the top of my head, but I think it's due to being bombarded by such an amount of sheer stupidity which has made me retarded. The kinds of questions THAT KID in your class would always ask the teacher and you werent sure if he had a learning disability or just wanted to hear the sound of his own voice every 5 minutes.
---
assuming 85 att/str, 80 range.
---
6.2 dps no specs 7.2 dps 2 specs (avg hits, 72% accuracy spec%1, 76% accuracy spec#2 hitting an avg of 34 dmg because max hit is 68) so ~15% dps increase.
---
with 0 bgs specs its  120 seconds  to kill, bgs specing twice is 103 seconds.
---
this is constant dps. 
---
15 seconds per fireball phase, 10 per freeze. assumes you dont dps during fireball phase. 
---
assume you eat 8 food per kill ish (so +6-8 seconds assuming you eat during fireball)
---
thats not near 5mins.
---
Not sure how this'll turn out, but the way they said "I would never do such a thing and never will" sounds exactly like what someone would say that actually did rwt
---
Since when did OSRS cause mesothelioma
---
&gt;Rather than focus on the combat level, you could make leagues like: level a new account with Ironman status until you hit total level 500, then you must immediately stop gathering any resource or gain exp. Fight with the players in the league.
---
The most efficient thing to do there would still be to make a pure of some sort. Your pure would also just happen to be a 500 total ironman.
---
Who cares how difficult it would be? A mistake on their part ruined accounts that some people have hundreds of hours invested into. They need to fix it.

Does every in game item have a sprite? Is it possible he could have cycled through numbers until he found the new helm sprite and photoshopped it?

Ooooh, I thought that was to entrana. Was really confused when it wasnt in the bottom of the port anymore. My bad!

Meet Kentucky Friedletics, my chicken-locked Ultimate Ironman.

I know but still like there is nothing that its better to do on mobile. Well besides fletching maybe? Than doing on pc. But barb is one of those that when you have access to mobile but not pc. Its quite nice. 
---
Sorry brother, they're rolling that back soon
---
For real 2FA on the runescape is not enough you guys need it on email too.
---
Honestly sounds like op was lying. I have a flipping account where I sometimes trade huge amounts of gp between them and I've been good so far
---
Kid you sit in your parents house all day on reddit, playing runescape, and watching TV. Get a job you fucking bum. I'd say you can call me on discord and I'll flame you in a video call, but I am guessing you are to much of a pussy to face a man. Now go clean your room before your mom bitches at you for it.

"local virgins gather to protest such long system update timers leading to xp waste"
---
Give them to imps instead
---
You can make an effort to avoid problems caused by other people. You don't have to solely rely on them to monitor themselves.
---
&gt; JADFLICKS  
---
I've not heard that one before. I think it's my new favourite Jagex name.
---
I'm assuming you botted because I have extensive knowledge of the system from having botted and written scripts and know your story is bullshit. 
---
Do brainlets actually sleep then?
---
i had it :/
---
All that is correct and it's what I'm complaining about.  It grinds my gears my are choices are pay for a second account or go on a long ass grind.  
---
Nice of you to call my account shit just for being new and casual.  No wonder people hate PKers and fail their polls. 
---
Nah.
---
world 443 come trade me on ape atoll
---
Yeah, definitely got banned for "using an auto-clicker" 
---
However, I still put 20ish hours of real work. Legitimately clicking, dying sometimes and even chatting with people in the game during that time. 
---
I shouldnt get punished for cheating because their system is too shit to realize that I am legitimately playing the game. Sure, I played a pretty unreasonable amount of time (because I was unemployed) but that doesn't change the fact that I got a week ban and lost a bond all because of a broken system. 
---
We see these things time and time again and it's honestly laughable at this point.  
---
That's.. actually smart as fuck
---
Sadly I think it's real... I guess when you've been told "Sit" while doing a clue scroll one too many times a switch just flips that can't be unflipped 
---
It depends who you got the task from (turael tasks don't give points) and if you've finished 5(? Maybe 4) tasks without resetting at turael 
---
Lol this is just getting sad. 
---
No problem dude, just do things the way you like to do it. DDS is what people call the Dragon Dagger (P++), which you can use after completing Lost City. It’s a popular weapon to use for it’s high value special attack, which does 2 hits at the cost of only 25% special bar. 
---
DM me your username in game and I can help you out whenever I can.  
---
I dont get it...
---
Dear 123kg,
---
rekt
---
Sincerely,
---
Mod Weath
---
Yes it is. 
---
Btws get it from dks, very few have even gotten it from wintertodt.
---
I guess you are right. This whole fucking "booot world deedoooss" is literally the only thing people keep regurgitating. So stupid.
---
No but I wouldn't trash talk them because i'm not a man child
---
&gt; objectively terrible game design.
---
The game should have some risk and people shouldn't be able to use BIS to farm bosses and continue to bring high end gear's value down.  
---
No, bond prices are determined by the free RS market. Gold prices just undercut that to get people buying
---
I imagine bank standing is fun for you 
---
I think jagex is trying to compensate for something
---
Can we also give lizardmen tutus for when they do that beautiful pirouette melee attack 
---
Maybe if you get an average of one rare per hour probably.
---
Sure.
---
Just sometimes when I’m AFKing I like to chop Yews at Seers cathedral. Since the Seers bank starts the agility course and ends back at the cathedral Yew trees, I just run the agility course on my return trip. Every time I do this, it seems, there is a Mark or Grace waiting for me on the agility course. 
---
This makes me think the Mark of Grace spawn mechanic works based on the amount of time spent within the area. Since an inventory of Yews can take like 10mins, I’m guessing this coincidentally works as a spawn timer for the mark of grace.
---
I know. I realized that almost as soon as I posted the comment. Figured I'd leave it to hopefully spur discussion on what could actually work.
---
I played in pre-eoc when it was around and there were not near as many world ddos's and it worked out well. If they have the proper protection something should be implemented.  At this point you can literally use it in your favor at a boss to have food stacks for an hour.  
---
Good luck brother 
---
Everyone saying it's photoshopped, I don't think it is. Remember when they released corrupted armour? People found the platebody by accident before the clues were released too
---
I got glaucoma trying to watch this
---
Oh yes middlemen. The guys only exclusive to the rs rwt scene and literally no where else in life. 
---
That's poker attitude there bucko
---
my boy
---
Woox will have it beat within an hour of release
---
Seriously even if there were no clay item rewards to power level skills with I'd kill to have stealing creation come back. It was the only time in the game you get rewarded for actually training all your stats.
---
Just don't be a fuck up
---
-Flair
---
why are you only denying selling? did you buy gold?
---
Don't hold your breath because false locks don't happen, idiot.
---
"50 000 people used to live here..."
---
There’s a reason people hide poll results you fucking brainlet.
---
Nice high pitched raspy ass voice in that cat video you posted nerd LOL. Balls havent dropped yet have they kid? Btw your arms are fucking tiny. How you like those insults kiddo?
---
Looks more like a lolipop.
---
If you open the questions let's say 6 hours after it went live, thousands of votes will have been done. If you come in and see 80/20 you will likely feel your vote would t matter anyway and skip or follow the crowd. This will start happening pretty early in the polling process. 
---
If that's how you wish to look at it, yes. They added the new mechanics with ddos problems in mind, players got used to it, UIM abused it.
---
Not sure if you're the one that downvoted me, but I agree with you on having the old death mechanics. Stop being so hostile. People will listen to you more and be more willing to look through your perspective.
---
if a recovery is instantly failing that means you arent providing enough or accurate info
---
I completely agree. 
---
The smack downs were fun to read but kind of unprofessional. Already pretty unprofessional to have to get a ton of visibility on social media to have your ban looked at. 
---
But I know the team is small and the vast majority of bans are warranted. It would be a waste of resources that the team really doesn’t have right now. 
---
Maybe they should come up with a way to let accounts with a certain amount of playtime, total level, total xp, or quest points or something appeal. That would weed out most of the goldfarming bots and let legitimate players have a chance to appeal if their ban was falsely implemented. 
---
That's sexy. I'ma go find it.
---
You're pretty much correct, but because you said "fairly common" when in reality probably about 0.01% of players know this, people are gonna think you're a hater and downvote you to oblivion lol
---
Easiest way is going to be using blood spells (they heal you) in ancient spellbook. If you haven't done desert treasure, you should do that before completing DM. 
---
So you're saying your sweeping generalisation of osrs players doesn't apply to me, or even yourself?
---
So far your statement is 0/2 lul. 
---
Nah if you even mention efficient skilling on here you get fucking crucified
---
Trade and walk away I guess
---
Oh I thought you were memeing to get him banned
---
This is what happens when you give your armor to those armor trimmers at the GE.
---
dude its suffering its like going through life only having one testicle instead of 2
---
There's a forum thread for complaining about how much XP you accidentally got due to the bug.
---
Which is why most people are probably signed up to my fitness pal.  So you can try to pretend you are being healthy
---
"peace250 was not found in the Overall table"
---
Have you considered the fact that you and your friend both got banned for RWT because he RWTed the wealth you just gave him and that is tantamount to you yourself doing it? Otherwise everyone could safely RWT by just giving their 'friends' the money before RWTing it. 
---
And I still hate that decision. My go-to fashionscape included using those long fremmy boots along with the morytania legs. They fit so well together, and now Fremmy boots literally look like ugly little socks. 
---
Changing the look of an item completely without polling, because of "clipping issues" that probably a very small amount of people care about, is wrong imo. 
---
Look at all those chik-....wait....WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! NOOOOOO
---
My account from 2007 got banned for this same issue. Never touched a script, didnt even know they were a thing, unappealable. Rose tinted glasses after I left the game fucking tricked me into coming back though
---
The definition of fear
---
You gotta understand usually stuff like hopping worlds is not an intended function on the devs part. Doing that is thought up by players to speed up the process of something. 
---
&gt;Stop being so hostile
---
Nah at this point it doesn't matter. The ezscape damage is done.  People are used to being sheltered in the game and that bandaid isn't being ripped off. I also think it is part of the problem with hostility to the wildy seeing as how the rest of the game doesn't have the same death mechanic anymore.  
---
Maybe I guess? but he does exist, we've been playing for 10 years. I've got a folder of at least 500 screenshots.
---
nope.  Items never show for other players.  After an hour it just despawns.  Been that way for a long time now
---
NICEEEEE
---
Yeah I wish I could do more activities with my friends. osrs feels like a boring solo grind sometimes. I just want to gain exp and have fun with friends. I'm newer compared to my friend group and they all constantly say "hurry up and get x level so we can raid"
---
Hey, I got criticized doing slayer more often than not for doing it. On MANY occasions people would be genuinely offended that I wasn’t using a whip and tell me that I was “doing it wrong”. Even during the scimmy stage, the same thing happened. 
---
Idk why you’re getting an attitude tho.
---
Oh, then there is a bigger problem. The card is no longer existing.
---
I think there ban system is having some super bad issues right now my friend was banned for botting for like 9 days, and he had only ever played on mobile cutting trees and merching. He flamed them daily on Facebook and it eventually got unbanned after 9 days, but the e mail didn’t even include an apology, just a hey we looked at it and I guess you weren’t botting. Unbanned. It’s so annoying that they don’t even leave you any way to contact them to talk about it though.
---
Yeah fair enough, also true 
---
&gt;do dragon knives have any use for ironmen?
---
Not really unless you pk on your iron. You could use them for some ranged xp but I doubt that's worth your time at all.
---
How much for buying gf
---
what do you mean most often they show its broken, 99% the time they are correct bans your just some conspiracy fruitloop 
---
Suggestion approved
---
Inb4 everyone who ever accidentally ruined a pking build before yesterday also tries to get a rollback. 
---
It is the most retarded update ever....
---
Most of the players been playing about 15 years with muscle memory on the old switches way and now change that all of the sudden
---
They split that update aswell, not affecting pvp/pking but shit so theres 2 mechanics now to remember inside pvp and outside pvp, now pures wont fuck up pking because it is the old way. But go train ur pure to max it out and you are guaranteed to fuck up
---
&gt;  update blog
---
We don't really get updates. Why would we check it?
---
How bout a nice round 50?
---
&gt;against "ezscape"
---
lol?
---
Hahaha you did research to find merit to your insults because I called you out about not knowing what the hell youre talking about what kind of life are you living where you can get so salty!! Lmfao, that was quick too, I bet you rolled your sleeves up for that one, bravo... I’m actually impressed. I’m glad I can teach you how to properly insult someone. Keep looking through my profile I have a lot more stuff to make fun of. Come back with some more good ones... balls haven’t dropped yet, lmfao how original.
---
He stopped because he knows what he's doing and doesn't need good stats.
---
But not everyone plays runescape so this is dumb
---
I upvote this to worship the cabbage god
---
honestly though how fucking stupid is this... Jagex needs to actually use the homepage, lobby screen, hell an in game message or two...
---
For a level 3 or lvl 40 to leech, one of their friends would have had to bring them in in the first place, you understand that right? No one is bringing these low levels in in the first place unless they are friends. 
---
That's fine idc lol. Idk about .01% though I think even way back in the day we sorta implicitly knew this without ever really considering how to exploit it. 
---
I don't... just turn the sound off.
---
What's a pure?
---
Got it, I get it now. Thanks for educating.
---
1 minute of afking at crabs could send you from 40-41 atk if you logged in.  I think the staves were also giving out defense exp on strength. 
---
HCIM doesn't become a useless account after that tbf
---
What does that change? 
---
glough has nieve pet rip 
---
Tfw I’m just 26 and sad inside

Better get that nmz in while you still can.

Guarentee the whole game has to be updated to change the message.

most pkers don't vote in any polls, the only part of the pvp community that votes are organized clans.

Not hiding poll results creates a bias

Nah its essentially like an expansion

With cooking guantlets
---
u/JagexGambit balancing the newly prosed sand method around 99mining, 3 ticking, and adding a fee is absolutely atrocious. This serves as proof you listen to the top tier EHP players far too much. You’ve balanced a training method you want to be liked and used for a very marginal number of players.
---
Not to mention, you did this after explicitly stating you wanted this method to be better than charters in the last qol poll blog. But now... you bring this out and poll it needing a slow 99 to be better than charters but the vast majority of players won’t get 99 mining first because they don’t care about post 99 cp.
---
No he means mode that u need friends for sorry you cant join it?
---
Panic buy black armor
---
*panic becomes armor trimmer*

Jagex-fuckups like today aside, you choose to limit yourselves for an advantage over other players.
---
Deal with it.

I'm using Ethernet (because this is a desktop), so I doubt it's internet. Speed test says DL was 91.15 Mbps and UL was 11.33 Mbps.
---
The only .jar file that I see is called, "jagexappletviewer" and the only option for "Open with" was "Java(TM) Platform SE binary", which did nothing and the launcher still will not open. I really don't know what the problem is here.
---
No seriously though if you wanna have a discord call and continue this conversation we can do that. But as I stated before you are a pussy and we both know it. Have fun being a virgin forever, and it sucks for your mom she has to grind her shitty 9-5 job just so the nasty old bitch can die and leave you a measly $100k inheritance. Hey man dont sweat it though maybe you can lose your virginity to a prostitute or something when you get her funds lmfao.
---
I was curious to hear what it sounded like so I flicked game noise on for a second. Saw my life flash before my eyes, never again.
---
Ya a bank that requires a pick axe to get to.
---
Stop posting it multiple times a day too.
---
Im not sure how you even like.. Start looking for this armor?  I'm lost.   How do you start " crack the clue " ? 
---
Rune and Dragon throwing axes have niche uses already as spec weapons. I don't see how increasing their range would add any new reason to use them in practice.
---
Also that's not what QoL means.
---
I got pet before head LOL
---
Name checks out 
---
Just play rs3, they give u the option to block pvp xp, defense xp, quest xp!^^^^^/s
---
Also they have Dungeoneering.
---
Niche account builds are cool because it shows that they never fucked up. When you take away their ability to fuck up it ruins the integrity of their niche account. When you look at KempQ with a 12 hp iron with a granite maul it’s impressive, the amount of dedication/effort/and planning that took. Remove his ability to get hp xp altogether and it just ruins the build
---
Lol deserved
---
HOLY SHIT MAN!!! I was the one who told you to post it my man!!! YOUDAMAN! Get it reversed homeboy!
---
Pures are amazing &lt;3
---
6-10 years prison time and a fine
---
Seriously dude I'd love to buy that
---
\&gt; But the issue is PvP players lol. 
---
the issue is that most PvP players don't vote, the only part of the community that does are clan pkers which are largely influenced by streamers.
---
And how exactly do you expect them to make pets for every gear combination? 
---
wait what it doesn't transfer over to pvp?? what are the os devs thinking... splitting pvm and pvp mechanics is the worst idea yet.
---
Honestly...with that many 99's you should get a response.

I like smackdowns

M’lady.

It's 10pm there.
---
No worries 
---
Yeah regular void range is shit get elite
---
&gt; I'm going to post one of my accounts in hopes they fix it from my fuck up about 6 months ago, lol.
---
This is the exact reason they stated "they couldn't".
---
So morons wouldn't abuse it at any possible opportunity.
---
Which was solved before they even gave us the clues lol.
---
Play the game like everyone else 
---
Exactly, i prefer playing 3 hours to progress my account than buying 2 bonds, maybe when i get the more endgame stuff and maxing buyable i start buying it.
---
They probably could have included a warning upon logging in re: attack styles. idk
---
Are you defending nmz rewards?
---
"Solved" I'm still looking forward to figuring out the clues.
---
It isn't. Because of the way damage rolls occur, strength bonus is almost always better. Especially so for f2p because most monsters have extremely low defence.
---
Por que no los dos?
---
that one guy. Nice sample size
---
u/BurningKiwi is right here, it can be a bit time consuming because I haven't had one follow me more than 1-3 tiles at a time but I heard that if you do this with vengeance, you can get them to follow you farther

Basically my pc is going off the fritz?

Also "Come here toady!"

Did it on phone...

Only here for the rake content tbh

Yeah I’m 75 farming and get less than 45 irits every run with B’mless Bucket and atlas tree. 
---
You really don't get it do you. Maybe go learn something about how transfer protocols actually work. I doubt even google or amazon could accomplish this under current protocols.  
---
You want to reroute the entire system to a new connection without terminating the old one. Good fucking luck. Current TP's do not support that and wont for 20-30 years to come.  
---
You should rename your thread to 'hey jagex spend billions rewriting data protocols so my half thought out idea on a downvoted reddit thread can work cuz i know sum java k'.
---
OP please post this message to us. If he doesn't we will know it's a Jmod smackdown!
---
Forum posts aren’t enough. I want to be able to call into a support center and be directed by an employee with more knowledge than me when I have a problem. I’m not saying I need a case worker to follow me through the process but at least point me in the right direction or let me submit a ticket instead of sending me to the same loop of FAQ pages. I don’t even have a pure I have just had questions about my account in the past that have taken far too much effort to answer
---
they are looking in to it, but it could take a couple days, about to get my 19th 99 in 5 mins =P str is incoming, 2 lvls from max total and i get 46 defence'd :c
---
ibans the new ironman meta for zulrah?
---
No 87 slayer requirement for trident.
---
It's in a weird spot in between, it has the depth of a skill but the diversity of a minigame. It should have had it's own tab in the quest tab similar to favor in zeah. You could unlock  additional benefits and content by playing the minigame and getting "favor" in that section. They could be the basics; combat, gathering, and artisan, or something more in depth. 
---
Not effectively. Jagex does not dictate the in-game price for bonds, player base does. If they were to lower the bond price to, say, $3, instead of 3mil being now legally $3, the bond price would drop, likely to somewhere around 1.5mil where the margins would stay the same.
---
then do it
---
Not sure that would fix the problem, every time you equip a different weapon now it will now default to accurate.
---
Why do people have to go abusing the client? Gonna end up getting it shut down for the rest of us that just like using it as a smoother client and not to bug abuse shit. 
---
Don't worry Jagex, I'll eat lots of pineapple pizza

---
Different teams. They should just get oars engine devs but I dunno how things work there
---
Right, but the "slash" bonus only applies to slash attacks (labelled strength in the combat options menu).
---
Or does the bonus apply to all attack styles?
---
Would OSRS players like Dungeoneering as a minigame instead of a skill in OSRS? How would they feel about t80 chaotics as a reward as well?
---
Poll Question #1 why can't we just make trouble brewing fun and more rewarding? It's like saying instead of completing a game of castle wars just go into the portal. Castle wars is fun and has some cool cosmetics. Trouble brewing has cool cosmetics its just out of the way and way too confusing/dull to play. 
---
eli5 pls
---
Now that you mention it I have been getting 15% less herbs. I thought it was rng.
---
You might be able to check his post history for some. 
---
now you can run like 5 accounts at once
---
I wonder if some kind of combination of these two is having some kind of unintended negative effect...
---
My understanding of it was that it was just the 1st time equipping a weapon of each type not every single time you equip
---
Hmmm seems like Reddit doesn't show the clip but the stream... click the link for the clip
---
&gt;dungeoneering  
---
&gt;as a solo activity
---
You had my interest; now you have my arousal.
---
Why do people make HCIM instead of IM when they are functionally 100% the same? And when they lose their red helm, they remake a new account, even if they had 1k+ total levels? 
---
And before you say "for the challenge of not dying" why not play unofficial HCIM on your regular ironman and just retire it when you die to something that's not a DC? 
---
The answer is because people take pride in the red helmet. They want to show it off to other people, plain and simple. That's why they don't play unofficial modes. Because they care about what other people think and they care about highscores, which is an extension of caring about what others think.
---
1 def vs 2 def is the same concept. It's functionally not different, but people will rag on you for being 2 def because it's cosmetically inferior to being 1 def. 
---
Tl:Dr - People care about what others think.
---
I thought the same thing lmao 
---
Ancient cloak was my last item and  didnt expect to get anther  so quick too
---
Your antifire potion helps to protect you from the drake’s breath.
---
Skip them
---
You can't hit every second in RuneScape, do varies from game to game. In RuneScape the fastest possible would be a damage roll every .6 seconds, next fastest every 1.2 seconds
---
i actually wouldn't mind chaotics considering blowpipe is stronger
---
hopefully this post will gain some traction and a JMod might look into it.
---
Says the illiterate fuck. 
---
Targets overpriced. 
---
It wouldnt change average damage taken whatsoever though....
---
Nothing is different.
---
That has nothing to do with Schrödinger’s cat lol
---
Oh no. This content is going from crack the clue to cracking down on 3p clients real fast. 
---
KenpQ definitely fucked up.
---
Abysal Dagger because it looks cool.
---
Dragon Dagger (p) is second place :)
---
I realize the tent whip is significantly cheaper, but the blessed sara sword is straight up better on a 1 def pure as it has a +2 strength and +10 slash bonus over the whip as well as an aggressive attack style. 
---
You definitely wouldn't. I would quest a lot of that experience and then move on to slayer, crabs, pest control, experiments, etc.
---
There are a lot of options. If anything I would just watch some yt guides and go from there. 
---

plant some trees or if you dare,  tithe farm,   i tithe farmed from like 40-66 in one day.   just listen to music and it makes it way easie--- sucks dick either way,  but fook me xp gud 
---
Those hunter gains were crazy. Didn't expect that much at all
---
*THIS GAME IS SPAGHETTI*
---
When I see old posts like that (2015) I wonder if they're still accurate today. When was the last time Jagex updated the combat system, regarding melee?
---
I have noticed this too with both the bucket and attas tree.
---
This just isn't true.  Clans vs Edgeville vs pvp is a fair statement but a lot of people are in clans also solo pk.  
---
Assuming thats true, imagine some pker saves up for d claws 3 months from now, if they remember this update they'll be fine, if they aren't thinking about it and are eager to go try them out I could foresee a problem.
---
Why did they get rid of that anyway, it was insanely helpful
---
Oh anticlimactic
---
Look at my name
---
r/whooosh
---
Make easy. Me hate challenge. Me want xp
---
If you find out who and how much tag me lol 
---
Just voicing my opinion 
---
The worst part is they polled dungoneeeing before OSRS started to get really popular and it failed. It would pass with flying colors today
---
15 years was an fyi considering you think a 3 year article is old.
---
Now this might be mean, but helpful to you if you heed the advice: stop being sensitive;especially when someone is helping you.
---
Can we get #7 (remembering chatbox open/close status) to apply to the desktop client too? Would be great for resizable mode users 
---
I loved it
---
Do y'all think people will get banned for finding it early? 
---
I think (might be a dumb idea) that Jagex should award the first person to do a complete write up of the solution to CTC2.
---
How do you know that's how he did it
---
I feel like I was averaging more than that per patch prior to obtaining an bottomless bucket. 
---
Well FWIW, you come across as a gigantic dickwad while doing so.
---
Lol, so he unplugs. Stays logged in because combat, and dies like a dumbass. Logout mechanics do not change here. Only login mechanics.
---
No way I want it as a skill again unlocking the stuff you have been working on was ssooooooo satisfying. 
---
“We don’t want to pay for a customer service line to easily fix obvious mistakes”
---
Just got thieving as my second 99 so this armour makes me pretty happy
---
People really overestimate their man power. Sure they could make a copy of runelite as the official client and update with new features as runelite does. but their man power is limited too. Would you rather have client updates that already exist from a 3rd party kindly providing it for free over actual updates to the game? I dont think its even kind of needed besides maybe SOME feature to aid mobile, such as ground items yes. 
---
But you're on a PC, just get runelite lmao. They have enough on their plate to implement something that is already provided for free.
---
That’s not an unpopular opinion that’s just you being a moron and possibly disliking pvp
---
Forget about the King and Queen, i'd rather see Zanik take on that Big Fat Ogre cock!
---
You should try sinkholes. It is all the fun of dungeoneering, but instead of having to compete with 4 braindead idiots that do not know to make traps for the damn ferret, you can steal all their resources and play a dust devil card at the end. It is really cathartic after the dg grind. Try it out. 
---
Wasn’t this a proposed update? Neg xp lamps? Pvmers coulda been getting rich from this 
---
Yes. I was afking nmz and suddenly my attack dinged instead of str. Not a big deal seeing as both are mid 80s
---
I mean would you say pest control and barb assault are dead content? Those have worthwhile untradables 
---
So that you can spend all your time on your main account doing shit you like such as skilling or pvming without worrying about teleporting to the grand exchange every time one of your offers goes through. 
---
I appreciate sinkholes for getting me tokens, and I get to have fun with a prepare group 
---
Aight seems that I dont understand the meaning of this post in that case. Ill be off.
---
I never got summoning. It was just too much for me
---
Because I go gym to life weights not sit there like a lil bitch on my phone , playing a game, clearly have issues can’t put osrs on hold for a gym session, sad, fact
---
Great content as always

It's still wet and hot and karamja
---
I got my first fcape with rune cbow at 70-ish ranged. Took over two hours (something like 150 minutes) and I had barely any supplies left, literally waiting for my hp to restore, so yeah, sad times.
---
So first off: Blowpipe will make it a laugh. If you can afford it and REALLY want that cape, go for it (which means 75 ranged). You'll end up going like 600k over the blowpipe price, to buy scales and darts (mithril darts will do just fine), so keep that in mind.
---
Other than that, learn the safe spots from Italy Rock (easiest way), take like 3 ranging pots (I recommend saving them for when the lvl 360s show up), 8-10 saradomin brews and fill the rest of your inventory with super restores. 
---
From my experience, you'll only need 1 super restore to fight jad. Also, lure the healers and line them up so only 1 can hit you (whilst paying attention to jad). Don't do more than 1 action between prayer switches (eg. Sip brew/lure healer/sip restore).
---
But what is most important is keep trying until you get it. First try to get as far as you can, repeatedly, until you spawn jad. Then GL killing it.
---
Sorry for not putting these tips in a chronological order or anything of the sorts, but there are TONS of guides on YouTube and you do more research for yourself. 
---
Good luck man. Don't stop trying.
---
yeah you pay me and the squad 2mil, we escort you up and keep you safe and *definitely* don't kill you ourselves
---
Who said anything about him price manipulating?
---
Yeah, it's the "simple" job of just making objects with the same id act differently based on info that only exists server side. Would probably require overhauling some very fundamental parts of the engine though.
---
Really? I tried finding it before I made my comment and couldn't. What's the plugin called? Is it just the Puzzle Solver plugin? I thought I tried that one when I last got a light box puzzle but I guess not :P
---
I never 100% understood what everything did but just thought that it was cool as hell having a big ass titan fighting alongside me 
---
dude u just dont wanna hear the truth hahhaha
---
Just go there and start asking people lmfao
---
At best he could log back in during the fight if he dcs, He would be greeted in the middle of combat if he was fast enough. Which is the whole point of this.
---
they could always claim it's fake
---
As I said, I sometimes tap my phone once inbetween sets (time I spend doing nothing anyway) so I don't get kicked out of nmz. Sue me.
---
Yeah you can abuse the timer to get max xp in a 24 hour window. 
---
Basically train for 5 hours and 59 minutes, track in crystalmathlabs, log out. Now you’ve got 6 hours worth of xp 1 minute into your 24 hour window. 
---
Dumbass gave me a free quiz answer. Cleaned
---
Jagex offered to roll back the affected accounts' unwanted XP after the issue was confirmed, so the jokes are all in good fun at this point.
---
Jagex probably messaged him to let him know not to make a fool of himself because they found evidence or something. In which case, that's a real good guy move on their part 
---
That’s like saying buying illegal weed is ok because the legal recreational stores in your state are more expensive lol
---
Because they haven’t even released the clue?
---
And maybe because there are several other posts on the subreddit currently with the entire set, titled “Thank you Runelite Dev Mode”?
---
Nice, Reddit is basically asking for jagex to ban 3rd party clients at this point
---
Thank you.
---
Juna? Don't you mean runecrafting snek?
---
if you dont log in for an extended period of time your username will be wiped for someone else that plays can use.
---
I appealed a manual perm ban this week which was non appealable, I just ticked the box that let the appeal go through. Reached out to them on Twitter, no reply. Put a post on here, didn't appear, asked the mods about it, no reply. The day after I put my appeal in I get unbanned, I've posted with the full story in this subreddit but my posts aren't appearing, kinda glad I didn't have to rely on a Reddit post for my ban appeal! But sometimes the official channels still work somehow
---
What if he modified his armour id to reflect the new armour. I know it's possible to change your character model to anything like jad but it only shows for the client.
---
Tribrid is pretty popular on bh world at wilderness hotpots e.g 44s, Green dragons 
---
That's a shitty argument A because those don't exist in osrs, and also B the entire reason that blackmarket gold is bannable is because of the dent it makes in Jagex profits. 
---
You have to press all the buttons and it's calculate the fastest solution, shown at the top of the interface
---
2 kill trips with bad RNG.. 3 with standard and 4 maybe if u spec BGS and luck out on RNG.
---
You should only be taking damage on the range hits.. rest is avoidable.
---
this shit is why we always rock saradomin halo fr
---
Elaborate 
---
Wtf are you talking about that wasn’t the point of his comment lol
---
maybe this will make more sense when I get higher level and don't have loot that instasells on GE? currently I find I rarely need more than 8 slots
---
Do I need to do something to get different slayer tasks? I'm at Nieve and  3 of my last 4 tasks have been greater demons. Skipped and then blocked black demons before that because it was so slow. I've had 6 fire giant tasks and 3 jellies. I'm at 63 slayer at the moment and it's really making it terrible to level up getting the same dull tasks over and over 
---
Well, the idea is that there's only so much to test. 
---
Get goals for quests. I was at 455 total skills in early nov I just 1525. Watch a lot of YouTube too very good guides to level 
---
I was originally rank 2 thieving on my hcim at 200m xp, I basicly stopped playing a month after 200m xp because I had almost no lifedthieving followed by 100 hours 9f post 200m xp at pp trying to get a sceptre then 3500 kills dry for a whip.
---
anyway shortly after that my SO and i go to the states for around 8 months, 3 months into it I get one of those phising emails sent to my hcims email which isn't linked to anything besides that account, I brush that off and don't think about it again, I get back into WoW and basicly play that up until a few months ago where my SO wanted to learn dungeoneering so I hop on my main and grab her a bond, she goes to log in she perm banned first offence macro major, I check my iron man banned, dead hcim banned, ultimate banned, hcim banned. 
---
so I'm freaking out I out in appeals for all of them within 24 hrs all have response emails and are unbanned except my hcim, my 2 normal iron men are deironed, my SO's account that has never touched osrs has 20 thieving 85 crafting those 3 accounts have over 2m flax in there banks collectively and a heap of bow strings 
---
my hcim never got a response and is still banned and removed from the high scores, I assume this is because I had a prior infraction for abusing ahk beyond where I should have.
---
it's still pretty depressing to think about :/
---
It's misinformation mate, there are no ground tile IDs to find
---
q
---
I was wondering that too. Why even attempt to block your levels if you leave your username in chat.
---
'This' wasn't inevitable, it could have been done correctly.
---
'Some issues' are inevitable due to the nature of the update.
---
It's the way you structured your sentence.
---
Dude wtf do you mean ruin your account, you can do obby maul to steel 2h swap now!
---
Are the RWT rules not the same for osrs as they are for RS3?
---
What's the truth lol? this game would be fucking dogshit if it stayed a 2007 clone with no new content
---
I mean, I guess a cannonball alt would be dope and helpful and profitable while I do everything else. the merch alt I don't see as overly helpful but I guess that could be for some people. different stokes and all.
---
When you die completing your 100th master clue scroll after completing 200m defence exp
---
I can already hear the “Hop Fag” 
---
At least shade out his name too if you're gonna do your own.
---
Kinda trashy if you don't IMO. Context before this text could of been you calling him the n word for all I know. 
---
1  Actively spite vote anything that positively effects pures for years.
---
2  Pures stop bothering checking updates/ polls.
---
3 Implement unnecessary weapon change because slayerscape too 
---
      brain dead to use f keys.
---
4 Pures log in and go straight to pk like normal.
---
5 Congratulations on level 2 Defense.
---
I’m not saying rwt is okay. So, it’s more like saying illegal weed markets will thrive because legal stores are more expensive, but even then there wayyy too many variables to use an analogy to compare the two. It’s apples to oranges
---
&gt;lmaoooo i dont play runescape 3, ezscape, pay to win and the gear doesn't even feel medieval lmaoooooo
---
While he buys bonds and sells those on the G.E to fund his buyables, afks in NMZ and wears this.
---
Big difference in adjusting an existuing mechanic on OSRS code than creating a new mechanic when it comes to bugs. Just because they reference old skills does not mean they will impact them. While my coding experience may be limited to a senior in a cybersecurity degree, I wouldn't exactly call myself clueless on the subject. 
---
You can remove attack styles in Runelite's settings
---
The OP. He admitted to it. However, I've offered a compromise. Remove the GE and I'll support this guy getting unbanned not that I'd have the authority to do that anyways. I just think he deserved it for trying to ruin the game for the rest of us for his selfish benefits. Merchants are like the plague.
---
o fuck its the bug today. Thanks jammyflex 
---
Lmfao I fished half that much in 2 weeks not that much effort 
---
Nothing is fun about losing an account for no reason, jewboy :/
---
Engine work. Thats not gonna happen ever. 
---
If you already have  70 pray, You need to do knight minigame to unlock piety in camelot
---
And if spins/keys dont exist in OSRS, what profit is black market gold putting a dent in? People only pay for membership. Nobody is dropping their monthly membership just to buy gold from someone lol.
---
I concluded it was either a misplaced meme in an otherwise serious post or they're frazzled enough to forget.
---
it's basically herblore with extra steps
---
I afk train at sand crabs and can only gain strength xp as shown in pic 1. But today with the update, my attack style was force-changed to Attack. So i got 61 attack without realizing
---
have you examined a banker at the different houses?
---
To be fair, not that these guys would know about it, but until FunOrb shut down, you were able to stuff an unmetered number of requests at the login servers without getting locked out.
---
One of the crates in the center has a bronze pickaxe in it
---
Isn't kodai better at raids2 now?
---
The logical thing to do seems to check your attack style so you know what you're training 
---
Okay but they're not the same game, they have entirely different economies. If I were to trade steam items for OSRS cash, I'm sure people wouldn't think that's okay.
---
What contracts are you doing? I'm always doing the hard/ high tier ones
---
You couldn't before?
---
But like what the fuck is 3 bread is it 3 loaves 3 slices, 3 what?? 
---
Scammed.
---
Please note: this post is only for the lulz. I'm going to main OSRS soon as I finish questing in RS3
---
holy fuck this post is a work of art
---
It’s a common scam with new items. They won’t sell unless you remove the poison and then after that you will be lucky to get 90k each for them. Sorry bud.
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with what he said.
---
Don't buy into people trying to make "retard" and "faggot" bad words. It makes you sound like mentally disabled old people who wince their buttholes when people say crap.
---
Imagine hating a whole group of the community that you wont let them get a targeted update every once in a while.
---
Anyway you could look into why my main of 3 years got perm banned for the same reason? Got a friend to log on my alt and send me 50m from it and you guys slapped me with a perm... working on a new account now, doubt I keep going though bc these quests got old the 2nd time when u made us male new accs with the rs3 shit just to re enjoy the game we had already spent years getting to where we were. Now I have to make a 3rd main? The system is ridiculous.cant count how many time I've been hit with false bans that "are not appealable" with no good customer service to even try and get an explanation except your system detected it... 
---
Only if you let me pp on your head
---
How is the video so smooth
---
Is it possible to simulate a first-person view using detached camera mode, or is it impossible to aim the camera up and down? I've wanted this for so long
---
thats because it is a serious problem you fucking melon
---
Fair point. And yea wholesome disagreements do seem to be more sparse on reddit, especially in this sub
---
I see. Thanks!
---
Who the fuck autocasts magic anywhere switching is required besides barrage slaying
---
dds(pp+)?
---
Or just p?
---
&gt;Brute forcing doesn't mean random numbers, it means trying out a lot of common passwords
---
**That is categorically incorrect.**
---
Brute-forcing is trying every possible combination of characters until you get the right result. You are describing a cred-stuffing/dictionary attack.
---
When you switch to it, for some reason it takes forever to start auto casting, so it may actually not be worth it
---
Milking that gold drop
---
Then put a cap on how many u can use to prevent these builds from starting. It has been proposed this way. It needs to be approached carefully, but it should be able to be accomplished.
---
Double deaths
---
Brainlet found. 
---
Jagex is upfront about their mistakes when it comes to wrongful bans. What makes people mad is that they don't give very many specifics.
---

---
Pures are gay anyway.
---
Lol my dude, assuming i "hate" ironmen because I think the game shouldnt be catered around them is by far the biggest reach you could make. I could care less on your play preference. However its a simple fact. You chose to play the game that way under CURRENT mechanics. Expecting a change to suit a game mode that isnt the "main" play style is absolutely ignorant and arrogant. 
---
I'll just leave this here, but as already mentioned by others(including runelite devs) runelite cant solve ctc2 for you... what was done here was just the ingame model was changed visually to reflect the new model.
---
To clarify a bit more - I'm def not going to be using bandos or statius armour or anything like that. I just want to use regular d hide, ahrims, and ags/gmaul switches. I have done some pking on regular worlds but I find that I get wrecked by people my combat level (\~100) when they know what they're doing. Practicing that way is going to be pretty costly. I also haven't finished alching to 94 mage, so I thought it would be good to get practice in between alching sessions. 
---
Wrong sub
---
This is why games need decentralization—no need for questionable centralized figures to govern and take away our hard work with little to no legit reasoning.
---
Pures are gay anyway
---
Honestly I think people should just suck it up and remember to bring their pickaxe lol
---
I'm talking about database files not the fucking code &gt;.&gt;
---
sucks to suck
---
OSRS General Forum, not OSRS Reddit forum.
---
Its not that bad
---
A
---
Sweaty*****
---
Yeah, when is that coming?? Has it already been polled, and we're just waiting for the update? 
---
Then put a cap on how many u can use to prevent these builds from starting. It has been proposed this way. It needs to be approached carefully, but it should be able to be accomplished. Just because something is risky doesn't mean it should be completely avoided. Think about how risky space travel is and how much good can come from it.
---
Tons of other people have made literally the exact same suggestion for years, then Tractor suggests it and everyone sucks his dick for it. Maybe we could get him to suggest hiding poll results and they'll actually do it. 
---
It was hitting defense and attack in strength mode but talk more about what you dont understand
---
Hahahahhaha 
---
As far as I understood from Settleds video it doesn't just work. He's trying to make it consistent
---
Sorry but you are asking for top tier dps in the most dangerous hot spot in the wilderness to be less risk?
---
ah yes I forgot about the clan pking treaty of 2014, those pesky clans refusing to attack each other, what a shame
---
(just kidding that doesn't happen)
---
Scroll sack max cape
---
&gt;15m
---
Not everyone wants to kills vorkath over 100 times in one dag
---
I mean, I dislike the ~pure~ combat system exploiting community but you do get an ingame warning when entering pvp areas. 
---
Don't forget using the remote desktop inside of an Oculus or Vive to play with a controller pointing at a screen like a laser pointer in order to click on a mobile emulator for osrs mobile.
---
Because using F** is hella disrespectful and rude. Its not a good trend that the osrs community is so brazen with homophobic jokes and slurs all the time.
---
If it's to good to be true, it is.
---
If you have to ask then you got scammed
---
what?
---
No. You just make a new account and that's a fact.
---
As already stated for those who think ctc2 was solved it wasn't. The model was simply shown over a currently existing armor set. Runelite doesn't have to ability to tell you what items to have where to stand and what to do because that information is server sided.
---
Man you're 99 rc..shouldnt you be knowing this kind of stuff by now?
---
youre retarded.
---
sorry bud they made this feature only work outside of pvp combat 
---
It would be nice for ironmen to get content catered to them once in a while.
---
I play a main account but I think you’re wrong about this statement. Yes, the game should be primarily balanced considering mains. However im/uim do make up a fair share of the playerbase and their game experience should be considered too.
---
Wtf? Imagine being actually retarded LUL
---
Bonds are way more expensive. Can get gold for 1.2m/$1 instantly
---
Chinning is 100% worth the investment. The amount of time you save makes up for the cost. If you chin to 99, and then go bossing with the time you saved, you will profit in the long run, and have free 99 range. 
---
Add a stack of pots and food right outside every boss, and add a rope outside everywhere that needs a rope, and lets add teleport runes everywhere incase you forgot the ones you needed. We should probably just add every single item to every single tile in the game just in case.
---
No. This idea fucks a lobotomy hole.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tij2t_p4TTw) is a video of me from mid 2012, would describe myself as moderately good. There are options to vary the size and number of players between 1 and 5, that's the largest map with the most people.
---
At the very end you can see I got 74k xp in 13 minutes (15 minutes if you count banking etc.) I was level 113 here - dungeoneering goes up to 120.
---
Traditionally you do a simpler version for the lower floors which takes probably an hour so the xp rate isn't quite as simple as 74k*4.
---
Also the ones who were bad at it/bad total level and only good combat level lol
---
Double checked and [I don't know how I missed it before](https://imgur.com/a/PhNlnlT).  Sorry Bobby
---
Adding a combat level would change your combat bracket in BH. It makes a difference albeit not a huge difference.
---
Lol I guessed
