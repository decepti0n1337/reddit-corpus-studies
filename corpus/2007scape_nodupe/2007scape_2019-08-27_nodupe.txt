Start by finding snd following a guide to get barrows gloves. They make everything combat related significantly easier.

Yes but I think by the time these cards existed in stores it was up to $7.

still better money than the other log cutting options.

Well at least you cant do wintertodt. This might be one of the most original ironmen out there because of that.

You want 50m? Nah POTIONS

mining is regarded as one of the more aids skills in the game despite having several training methods. I’m on the road to max and going to 100% do mlm. I’d rather keep my fingers happy.
---
Honestly. Most people pking, aren't pking on their main. They're pking on an account with dedicated stats to pk. You will be at a disadvantage and most people will be able to tell pretty quickly. Pking is very unforgiving but very rewarding. Which is why most people enjoy it. Try leveling the playing field with an account dedicated to pking. I think this will help you a lot. I always kind of struggled pking until I made an account dedicated to pking. Which is now my main account. And now I have two more accounts dedicated to pking. Watch torvesta. The accounts he's using are legit.

Damn she thicc

Some guy at the GE was dropping a godsword and picking it up as people ran to get it. One time he was to slow and a lvl 32 me had a fancy new sword.
---
Actually, the problem is that there isn't better gear. Justiciar gear is the best gear to use for the easiest run through the inferno, which is why people think it's less legitimate when people use it.

you mean treating the 20 million amazon residents like normal human beings in need of care and opportunity, just like everyone else? yea sure buddy, no. 
---
the fact is that mainstream media hates Bolsonaro, globalists that want the Amazon for themselves hate Bolsonaro and probably you too hate him. It's also a fact that fire isn't nearly as big as the one we had in 2015, which you heard nothing of. 
---
I recommend watching Bolsonaro's most recent statement on the whole situation, published on the official twitter account of Planalto, if you want any real info on what's being done.

When did they release reqs?

there are multiple calculators online, for any skill

If you go to the volcano on karamja and climb down the rope, i believe you can go north up to a gate that will lead you to the entrance of the Dragon. As opposed to going through Entrana or whatever Island you originally came from!

haha yea i thought his name was quite fitting!

I just got mine too with 20 hours of playtime. Gz man!

Liked and subscribed. The edits you made were pretty hilarious. My suggestion would be to make an intro to use for every video that outlines some of the logic for your account.

Yeah the grey handle would just change to the standard brown if you attached any bronze-rune and the wooden one worked on the dragon axe head as well.
---
Also you couldn't re-equip the axe handle once removed so I doubt the fashion scape statement unless he literally never did any combat.
---
Better get 20 RC levels now

Yes just rock cake down to 1hp, also look into using the overload potions as well.

Yeah for sure, that's why discord calls can lag until for everyone in the call at the same time.

Learn from your mistakes and grind for it again bro, slowly, dont get discouraged and when you get it back just continue as if nothing had happened

1 invent at a time. The wine merchant is closer to the menaphites thugs than the bank unnoter is anyway. Just hop twice or so to fill up the invent. 
---
If you want mass wines, I can only think of making them yourself. Could buy them from rfd chest, or pvm drops.
---
Do people reject stuff like this? My understanding was that jagex doesn't need to do any work on their client and use dev time when it could go other places. Content and the like
---
This is exactly what I've been doing. Finally got Lumbridge hards done thanks to lamps. You know exactly what I put that lamp on.

What is your fanatic kc? Can get a drop there and its added to the ele page

Isn’t base 70 level 70 in all skills nice clickbait

Since others seem the have the first questions answered.
---
On mobile I usually do afk skills like fishing (fly/barbarian fishing, turn on one tap dropping) or mining at motherlode mine while I'm at work to get those slow skills out of the way.
---
Runelite is generally preferred since it's source code is public so people can actually look at the code and verify nothing wonky is going on (keyloggers mainly). Also from my experience Runelite has more features.
---
As someone who has recently unlocked the red slayer helm; I wholeheartedly support this upgrade.
---
Are they gonna update the game? Or leave it without any new content? If so then they will probably face the same fate as osrs when it didn't receive updates

Why do you keep posting the same thing over and over again.
---
If you have YouTube premium you can listen to a quest guide in the background
---
From my understanding, people don’t want Jagex spending development time on the client when they could be spending that time on new content, fixing existing content, etc. Old School has a pretty small staff and since RuneLite has already taken care of the interface, it allows the main focus to be on updating the game itself.

I don't like it because it seems lazy. a set of wings and a face mask? you can do so much more in terms of designs with a helmet like the nezzy.

Keep your strength as low as possible for max xp
---
Right now the top streaming channel for osrs on twitch wants you to link your account through a link for double xp, it claims to be the official jagex osrs channel but looks really sketchy. Is it a viewer bot scamming channel?
---
It really depends on your current gear, but try and get a set of zenytes between you two (they rlly good)

Rex bro!!!!!

I was wondering if anyone else had noticed that, my guy literally always gets downvoted lmao

I got gifted a rune scimitar , at what point can i use it cuz ive only been playing for 4 days and idk if its even good.
---
how do u change ur golden gnome vote? Anyone?

just like osrs was when it launched, even i dont think vanilla wow is boring
---
Wait
---
Do you play on mobile? Do some simple afk skilling like fletching or crafting or something on your phone at work if your in a situation where you can.

Word
---
Just look up the drop rate of the item you want and find an item on the table with the same drop rate. If you wanna calculate for yourself the chance of having one by a certain kc the formula is (1-dropRate)^kc  -1

Nice

Or how making it *look* like you're ready to fight, but not risk much, is enough to get pkers to fuck off sometimes

Dont be so addicted. 😂

Work is a priority and obviously comes first. RS will always be here.

That being said, Id get used to only having a few hrs to play unless you're one of those madmen that can function on a few hrs of sleep.

To get a roll of any 3rd age piece is the same as noted pots.

Don’t you know that if you don’t at least open the challenge clue step before answering that Jagex will take a fat dump on your reward? Just a conspiracy theory my dumbass unironically believes

Yup, if you wear B'Dhide top and bottoms with a Crystal bow you wont be attacked.

Yeah because we're rope salesmen

I think the raggers are people who did it without justiciar and are salty that they're putting things in the game that makes it easier.

There should be a lfg rs subreddit or something, always get really sad seeing these types of posts down voted.

Damn very good! Got my first piece on chest 39, Dharok’s body!

Probably not. Failed a poll.

There’s plenty of people who would buy it...

lol wut? "plug into the discord client".

I have no doubt this dude OP met was doing some shady shit but I think you're well off the mark. You're not going to get hacked just by joining a server unless you're doxxing yourself by doing so. 
---
My guess is that he wanted OP to enter a voice call or channel with him so that he would seem more personable to OP and from there he would try to convince op to hand over more items/gp for his 'youtube series'
---
Usually I don’t risk...but then again there are times I feel bat shit crazy and bring max melee with lance for KBD 🥵
---
How? Is takes 2 min... there a bank in myths guild, can also bring myth cape so speed it up.
---
It's not going to be a big difference because neither have a rare drop, they only have consistently good drops.  
---
But if i had to pick, gargs.
---
It looks like he hit the RDT/GDT 13 times, but KBD rolls for both RDT and GDT at a rate of 1/12.8, so the average number of  hits on 150 kills is... 11.7

Nechryaels are better GP/hr but they're also a lot more annoying to kill because of Death Spawns and no aggression.

Whoa how do people speed run rs?
---
That skill proves there’s a limit to the mundane stuff people will tolerate to make money. I’ve had a run of exp lamps from randoms and some quests lately and it’s the only reason my RC skill has gone beyond the reqs for Proselyte, along with Tears of Guthix.

I believe the only source of black nails in the game are from cleaning up Burgh De Rott's basement during In Aid of the Myreque. The 4 you got are the only 4 you could ever obtain on your account.

No waste of dev time
---
Lol is this a serious question? Obviously your job comes first. It’s a bigger priority. Play OSRS when you get off work and play more on your days off and/or play on mobile and do AFK things while at work if you can.
---
i get more loot on a nech task in comparison to a garg task so id say nechs but its personal preference
---
Get used to it. This is the rest of your life. Your days of regularly playing 10+ hours a day are over, except maybe weekends.
---
As you get older and get married, have kids, and buy property that needs maintenance it just gets worse and worse. Sucks growing up sometimes.

I would highly suggest theoatrix's clan chat dude makes best guides on youtube and his community is sick and beyond helpful... when you click join chat you can type "theoatrix" and youll join a chat "osrstips"

See you in chat ;)

What was warding?
---
Ultimately, you will just have to accept that you won't be able to play as much as you used to. For me, I work 8 hours + 2 hours for getting ready and commute + 1 hour (being light here) for miscellaneous things like errands + 8 hours for sleep because I need it and that leaves at max 5 hours a day for OSRS. As others have said you can no life the weekends away, but I know that's when I personally take care of longer errands or spend time with family/friends too. I know when I first started working I kind of burnt out because I felt like I was falling behind everyone else, but eventually you realize other people's progress doesn't matter.
---
You got your money now let the rest of us losers have some wealth please

Hey man, yeah sure, I managed to get a couple kills already but I would be down for a couple of runs. I will PN you
---
How do you know rs will always be here??

Not suggesting additional wings here, I'm suggesting change of the wing shape + a brighter boi. There's probably a ton of different configs that could be done,  here's a reverse farseer shape, for example: [https://imgur.com/a/3xJ5nfR](https://imgur.com/a/3xJ5nfR) (obviously not flexing graphical prowess here, just illustrating a concept).

You literally made it into less of an achievement by your own admission and expected to get praised the same as someone who did it in a way that inherently shows a better understanding and mastery of game mechanics/execution. What did you expect exactly?
---
Is there any validity to the bottom left "pro" image? Thats how I've always played cause it feel like my wrist is flush with the ASDW keys. Never knew it was a strat

Best is to check the item on GE and volume sold. If it’s high volume turn over, you should be good but if someone’s trying to get you to buy huge volumes of items that doesn’t ever see. Beware.

For example,

Hover over the bar graph at the bottom of the fire runes page: http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/Fire_rune/viewitem?obj=554
---
Millions of them get traded daily.
---
Now do the same with maple roots:
---
http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/Maple_roots/viewitem?obj=6047
---
It shows in the past few days, they have been started to be traded more. The all of its history, it has not been traded that much before. The rise in trade started because it was targeted as a scam item and lots of players have fell for that scam.
---
How common are these? I’ve never really noticed any
---
I was assuming he'd have a 1 hour break whereas that would equate to OSRS time on mobile.
---
Fremmy Helm looks excellent because it's open. I'd rather have it be open and "looks like RS3" than to have a tim allen biker boy bandana on it.
---
Vanilla wow was great imo, but I always played wow more for the leveling/progression itself rather than end game raiding (hence why I enjoy OSRS so much). I think that vanilla has a lot of the problems OSRS has in that the end game content will get very stale and it will quickly lose players as they get closer to end game content unless they do consistent updates.
---
Bro why did you paint your nails?
---
Which raises skill cap, a good thing.
---
we'll meds aren't exactly bustling with money

and excuse me been grinding all day lol

I wouldn't mind hd in osrs as long as it's optional to turn on and off.

I just finished 68 mining for ds2 at mlm, just watch a show on the side and keep your characters mining animation in your peripheral vision.
---
Lmao I've seen that guy too, not the best
---
Its not my opinion that anecdotal evidence is poor evidence, that's a fact. You say its the 'Best' but how do we define 'best'? Would it not be more valuable to take a learning experience within the cave and translate it to better play elsewhere? Is 'best' what gets it done fastest? Or in the least time? Or in the least amount of attempts? There are lots of parameters here to define 'best' around. Sure, its safer to have the justiciar, but you're in control of less of the waves less of the time (because youre relying on ranged defence + damage soaking to mitigate damage) wheres if you found react to a spawn and work it out, youd likely be better off for it. But thats just my 2 cents.

I just assumed by the title he was complaining about how the players chose to not pass warding but chose to pass agility (which we didn’t). Rooftops were by far a good agility improvement and brought decent content into the game (graceful and staminas).

Im in the middle, I don't like it and I don't hate it. I couldn't care less about its looks I just want it to be op.

I made the mistake of purchasing a month membership with OSBuddy before I realized that Runelite was essentially the same thing, (and free) so I will most definitely be switching over. The only thing I really like that OSBuddy does was the OpenGL and smoother graphics.

Don’t think you would speedrun anything more advanced than that as you’d go well over 24h, but I suppose it’s possible to simply log out and start again the next day too, like using account age from Hans.

Don't be fooled, SHE put that on

Because it's free labor for jagex. No need to pay employees to add these features and most people use it.

the aggro lines arnt "walk x squares away and come back" there is an invisible box around u when u first come down the ladder so sometimes walking 1square is enough to reset aggro... there is a runelutw plugin that shows you the lines i think

It was done in F2P only. Air runes vs fire runes is 5 vs 7 xp/essence, but you get a lot more runes if you do airs. Lvl 70 is 7 airs vs 3 fires per essence. These days people do body talismans for f2p RC. Not sure if this was always viable, or if something  new on OSRS made this the best method.

You should easily be yielding more than 50-60 herbs. Ultra compost and magic secateurs?

Yes. I rarely go above 60.

holy fk does that look gr8 though
---
I did and yes I'll grant you that he's harder than them both for sure. We didn't get him down in time for CE, mainly because we spent way too long on Avatar. I sure was grateful for all of those addons I had for tracking soak timers though. I will be just as grateful when we see similarly implemented things in osrs.
---
I really couldn’t care less about the raggers because I know most of them are 16 yo and younger.

Just lock it behind Wildy Elite. Simple fix!

Hmm. I average about ~70 and I'm only 83 farming.

I just chill at the ge

I definitely made the most profit with ranarr at 70 farming, this was about 3 months ago tho

well yea. u have one more patch. which is gonna be on average at least 6-7 more herbs. I get around 60 most times

People sell their dignity so people can buy a sense of righteousness.  Also if you get scammed I feel like you deserve it.
---
So osrs is a fairly massive game with a lot of odds and ends and it takes a while to build up the game knowledge required to do things efficiently. I'd recommend just finding differnt things you enjoy doing in the game and just doing that for a while to learn the basics. A great way to jump start your account is going to the wiki and following the optimal quest guide and getting the ardougne easy diary done. The difference between a quest and the achievement diary is that the achievement diary is random jobs while the quests tell stories. 
---
As for the difference between slayer and regular combat. The skill of slayer is learning how to kill specific monsters. If you open the skill description there are monsters that are locked behind the skill that drop valuable items and core gear. Essentially you should train your combat skills by doing slayer tasks because it lets you level your general combat skills and another skill at the same time. Sorry this isn't the greatest break down of the skill but it's the best I can do late at night and on my phone. Ignore most of the comments and just go about the game at your own pace and don't feel like there's anything you really have to do in it. It is a game after all. Here's the wiki url and don't forget you can always look up guides and what other people recommend on youtube. Also, feel free to pm me if you have any questions. Best of luck.

Ranger boots on my 8th med clue.
---
I think if you get there in under 1 or 2 minutes you can get it back because it doesn't despawn. no-one else can see it though.

At least that was my experience with a hard clue death to an NPC in lv 40 wildy.

Lmao.

"God dang boot lickers always giving jamflex them authoritayyy!!!"
---
When i "lost" my crystal shield i was by entrance. When i "lost" my defender i logged in in the area north of the imp and black demon, and didnt have a chance to attack anything nor did i even have time to do anything but protect range and combo eat before dying.
---
There's no rush. Just do what you enjoy. 
---
For your questions about skills, hunter is for setting traps and capturing small critters, slayer is more of a meta skill as you get given a task to slay some certain creatures.
---
Just keep doing what you enjoy and keep doing quests, you'll figure it all out. None of us are getting this info in a week, we've been playing years. 
---
As an example you'll eventually do a quest where you have to do favours for kourend, this will explain what it all means. 
---
People have been doing to same thing over and over again for years so instead of saying that you'll kill the king black dragon they just say kbd. If someone says an acronym like that then just ask.
---
Well. I was just saying that the few times I've tried snaps, I actually made near or less than with toadflax. Maybe just bad rng.
---
We play runescape for hours on end. Our time IS worthless

I really don't like questing, but I finished most quests by needing to access an area or wanting a bunch of experience.
---
I find questing way too tedious though. Good luck when you continue questing!

There are no double jads in inferno. It was my 4th zuk, and it was my 4th triple jads, never failed them:)

Or quests for majority of the playerbase

Yeh I absolutely agree. Violence is violence plain and simple.

i have tryed make tickets on osrs site but no. and problem is that while ago i gave 200m from my pure to new fresh made account and got banned on that new account.

How does one even make any money fishing at that level lmao

Keep the wiki open

It really only becomes suspect when theres something off about the build doesnt it
---
Behind the scenes, it took a long time to get a +5, meaning that I was teleporting away to reset my negative skills (faster than restoring with prayer, cheaper than potion use) so for every RC task, the burden of carrying 28 essence has been completely removed.

You either go to an all boys school or in a computer science class

fits with almost everything.

On RL, where you have the XP tab, you can right click on a skill and click “Add to Canvas”. I think you can also right click the in-game skill from the skill menu for the same option.
---
Oh main i hope i see your post
---
Thank you!

I dont have a fully built poh so i use w330 when doing vorkath or something. sometimes if im using their house alot ill give em some noted dragon hides as a tip since it has like 40kish value usually and is stackable. they always accept it

Naw man, normal english lesson. I'm doing this double degree thing where I graduate from vocational school as well as high school. There's only like 3 girls for whatever reason. Idk the proper terms becouse I'm finnish lmao.

I meant gear-wise ofc but yeah I really want zulrah pet so I'll be here for a while.

Exactly, my tbow is like 2/3rds of my bank value and Ive lent it out to like 7 people because Ive known thek IRL for years
---
Idk why people put hundreds of hours into non money making stats like fletching cooking and fire making. And then go on reddit and ask how do I make money with this ? Meanwhile they have subpar combat stats and useful gathering stats to make money.

Really depends on your definition of afk. Playing alongside a main? Doing study? Stealth playing at work? Watching youtube/netflix? Each one has different answers.

D visage from black dragon on wilderness slayer task. Kc was like 6.
---
Not really, it's obvious why. Hardest piece of content comes out and people were hyped. New stuff made removes some of the skill required out of the hardest piece of content. Lowering the difficulty = lowering how epic of an achievement it is.
---
HaHa I ALSO REMEMBER THIS POST!!!!!
---
Inventory tags on runelite. Makes it easier to see if I missed a switch at zulrah (I made range - green and mage - blue).
---
whats wrong with me wanting to use the kq head for the diary to make the slayer helmet? do you want me to do another 256+ kq kills?
---
this is a special case. you dont gain anything by doing the inferno. the stats you get from the cape won't ever make up the time you spent there even for 200m all combats. it is ONLY a flex cape. what is flexing? a achievment. waht is an achievment? doing something challenging. what is justiciar? removing the challenging. basically cheating for a useless flex cape to flex on others while cheating.

---
That 1 runecrafting tho.
---
I mean you already figured out that answer, no? Your not gunna be hitting 1 for long then at like 10 or above run over to crabs

Not great for wildy altar though :):):):)
---
Don't forget contract farming in Zeah for over 250k xp/h with good spawns.

Yes very complicated stuff to use later in life.

It's weird, you'd be an idiot to not use justiciar for your first inferno kill attempts
---
You act as if there arent a fuck ton of high volume items at any given time with similar margins lmfao. Keep at the grind dude. only 4 hours of sapphire flipping for you and you too can be a twisty boy owner! no more dhcb at brutal blacks and abby whip drops!

Have you ever tried runecrafting on F2P? No rune pouches, no teleports, only regular essence and low tier runes.
---
There is literally 0 chance of getting banned for buying gold unless you talk about it and if you do get caught which is highly unlikely its only a 2 week ban not perm for buying. Plus it's a Lot cheaper than bonds
---
Your art? Impressive. I've always loved the look of watercolor. It captures art in the such a peaceful way.
---
I wish I could juggle classic wow BL3 and osrs but there are not enough hours in a day.
---
yeah i dont get what it means to buy something and sell it for more, its a difficult concept that I've never done before myself. Keep drooling over a 700k flip.
---
Yeah there are some things that should be up to the artists and then maybe revisited after.
---
Y'all ever hear of the giant mole?

Slap him 20k times and make seriously bank.

Even more obvious lmao
---
Sorry, forgot to mention i'm trying to be a ranged pure, keeping melee stats level 1
---
This, ibans blast the tits off barrows brothers, just bring an el cheapo range set for ahrim
---
Stored there as well
---
I can get behind this.
---
I like the middle one looks sick
---
Also, when they *do* finish them it's only for the really high-profile stuff. Once they've done Fremminik Exiles, I expect the next big one to probably be Menaphos (the last black square shield) or Ritual of the Mahjarrat (they've already modeled the area around Weiss!) or maybe Varlamore - but how high-priority is King Arthur? What about the actual cliffhanger endings, like Rise of the Red Axe or Cold War or, fuck, the entire Sea Slug questline?
---
Back in the day cliffhangers were alright because you could probably count on them being followed up on within a year or two, but the OSRS quest release schedule can't keep up with that.
---
fuhhhhhh...... Looks like i'm heading down this path too.
---
Yikes, I was at 1.4k KC before my tentacle, 2 jars
---
I also like the third one. But i dont think its right to make the new full helmet a med helmet. It just makes no sense. Every full helmet in the game is closed. Every single one.
---
If you dont like the full helmet then wear the normal one. Sorry. No Support.
---
Tbh they both should exist they look amazing so you can switch between by talking to a certain NPC in the fremminik isles..
---
rs bwanas finally doing some good
---
Wonderful suggestion, then they'll for once be perceived as useful assets.
---
Is the helm gonna have any negative bonuses on mage/range?
---
6 strength bonus POG
---
This is like the world record of the walking backwards mile. It's cool but no one really cares
---
So last time they nerfed serp from +5 an then suggested the new neitz upgrade to have +5 and it got a  lot of negative feedback and now they slap massive prayer bonus on it and give it +6 str when neitz is already better than serp while it has less str bonus?
---
Holy hell the helmet is so powerful I love it
---
Ah so that's why my friend didn't reply to me yesterday.
---
How...?
---
But dragon equipment is a whole series meant to be a non-craftable superior to all smithable gear whereas the neit helm is an odd one-off. Not that the med helm -&gt; full helm upgrade logic doesn't make sense in its own right, but there's room for liberties here (and if you don't think so we'll probably have to agree to diasagree).
---
I like your design, but I do think it's too little of an improvement to the regular neitz to consider it an upgraded neitz helm. You'd almost have to zoom in to see if someone has the full helm or the regular one. West's version you can spot from a distance, which should be the intention, in all fairness.
---
Nobody is gonna kill the ballisk bosses If the rare drop isn't expensive. Giving us a bis rare will be fine it's only 1 strength bonus
---
You actually pitch a good point. Making it even with the serp (str bonus wise) would still make the serp useful at certain places. Making this helm +6 makes it BiS, and BiS is BiS so the serp would become niche to venom protection/dps situations.
---
Gona need that runecrafting xp quest reward to at least be doubled, Jagex.
---
Love your dedication, but I am also with Mod West's.
---
I've updated the blog to include more information about the Attack bonuses. Thanks for flagging!
---
I do love some free RC xp... and it's thematic!
---
I went to the post you linked and was glad to see that most of the people shitting on him were downvoted into oblivion.
---
People that disagree with something always feel a greater need to comment about it than people that agree with something so it looks like there are a lot of haters, but you can also tell that theyre in a vast minority as all the silent lurkers downvote them
---
Don't think so since it's an upgrade to the helm of neitiznot which doesn't have any negative attack bonuses.
---
Is this secondhand butthurt?
---
Looks OG as fuck, is it a trend for this sub reddit to talk shit about any proposed update. Smh
---
Forgetting to do your tears of guthix bro?
---
Yours is many times better
---
Regular neitz is already better then serp for almost everything. The only thing it had going for it was str bonus and now they take that away aswell lol
---
I definitely think he can use some style choices you made like the star shape on the forehead and the gold lining along the faceguard to improve his version, but I do like the idea of the second one better. Maybe have yours as a option after the OG quest or fremmy hard diaries.
---
depends what kind of monetization and support it gets
---
They can though the drop rate of the unique is substantially worse in comparison to being on task (like hydras).

Just did some quick maths , the answer is 50/50
---
Since when has the word Snowflake been used solely to describe 60 year old balding white men?
---
It will not. It will stay a hybrid helmet with its new strength bonus.
---
This helm is beautiful and I will wear it always
---
Also how many people gonna finally reach base 55 for this quest? ♥️
---
I would've liked to see a bit higher requirements because with low reqs it doesn't feel like a master quest
---
runelite.net is correct and yes they are already in the client. Check the settings/options
---
Would you consider adding basilisk tasks to (some of) the higher level slayer masters then? The task is not given to people for which the helm would be relevant currently.
---
"Poll Question #3
---
Should you have the option to pay 80 Slayer points to unlock Basilisks as a new task from Konar, Duradel, and Nieve/Steve?
---
Poll Question #4
---
Should you have the option to pay 100 Slayer points to extend basilisk tasks from all Slayer masters that can assign them? This will increase the task to between 200-250."
---
dude nobody pvms in a serp helmet anymore. everybody uses serpertine helm bandos, or elite void. if you arent using either of the two youre doing yourself a disservice.
---
I don't accept this blatant lie. If it's ok the internet it must be true. No one would lie on the internet.
---
Buying gf
---
that is correct and no reliable way.
---
I agree. It should stick to not having any negative attack bonuses. It doesn't have a resistance to venom and the defenses are significantly lower than the serp so the +6 str  balances it perfectly.
---
I'm probably clueless but how is serp worse compared to neitz? Serp has +2 str bonus, way tankier def stats (except has +0 magic def compared to neitz' +3 magic def), can't be venomed/poisoned and easier to venom. Only downsides it has is -5 range &amp; magic attack compared to neitz, no prayer bonus and you have to charge it.
---
They're some of the higher quest requirements for stats in game.
---
Will always be voting yes to new quests. Love them. &lt;3
---
Potentially dont have this info yet, but if we did buy the task for these slayer masters, what sort of weighting would they have from each of the slayer masters?
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
New helm design is absolutely fucking mint.
---
The highest quest req in RS3 is Str 85 and that game has been out for much longer and has was higher xp rates. It should take quite a bit until we see 80+ reqs in OSRS. The avg player has stats far below Base 80s.
---
Good analysis
---
This jaw has to be a pretty rare drop if this helmet is getting +6 str bonus and +5 prayer bonus. That makes it BIS by quite a bit.
---
Comprehensive reading is hard :&gt;
---
Not really, no upkeep cost and no negative range or mage bonus. Ppl would use it for raids for sure.
---
ZMI (which is as afk as agility, maybe more even) at 73RC is 35k/hr. So you would get about 10 minutes or 30 minutes at your proposed 15k.
---
Hopefully it gets noticed before people start going "ERMAHGERD +6 STR OP VOTE NO!"
---
Really do not like that wearing the helm is locked behind isles and not exiles.
---
What's the reasoning for this?
---
Or you aren't a pro and like some food.
---
What lead to that decision? (legit asking, don't have an opinion on it yet.)
---
I guarantee that 99% of the people ragging on you don't even have the balls or skill to even *attempt* the inferno, let alone beat it. 
---
Congratz bro!
---
Which is totally worth it
---
Auth delay
---
Fair enough
---
And WHO said memes couldn't save lives?!
---
Of course! I’ve been tanking graador for a while, so if you have any questions dm me or something!
---
1/7 currently
---
Serp helm should not be BiS forever. Zulrah has been out several years at this point. In top of that serp still keeps its niche as "anti poison/venom" helmet and the extra +1 Str rarely makes a difference in max hit.
---
Yours is more of a med helm but I do prefer the look over mod wests proposed design
---
Well my point is that devs thought what they were doing was improving it. To be fair to RS3, it is a quality game that's been irredeemably brought down by MTX.
---
That helmet LOL.
---
+5 prayer bonus on serp.
---
Doesn't need to be charged.
---
Can be used for tribridding.
---
+1 str on serp.
---
Comes from a mid level slayer monster.
---
That's way too much lmao.
---
Something dropped by zulrah that requires expensive maintenance should be niche.
---
Something dropped by a slayer monster that doesn't degrade should be BiS for most things..?
---
This new helmet makes my peepee hard.
---
Fucking awesome, will vote yes to everything.
---
Since both the Neitiznot Helm and Basilisk Jaw are tradeable, why not just make the  Neitiznot  Faceguard tradeable as well?
---
Even at 55RC you could get 30k/hr at ZMI, 15K would save 30 minutes
---
middle one looks good
---
WTF do you mean, people still use un-upgraded neitznot.
---
Holy shit your complaining about getting 1-30 ranged, yet want to be a ranged pure. Go back to club penguin.
---
This fails to account for future str bonus creep. This helmet is objectively better than serp because of the +5 prayer bonus AND you can tribrid in it AND it doesn't need charges. The only reason to ever use serp would be to poison purple nylo in tob.
---
\-Air Obelisk. Mostly bots who dont run once they are TBed, but also a lot of nooby PKers who bring expensive stuff. 
---
\-Chaos druids. A lot of low levels train there, and because they have to protect mage, you can bolt them down or rush them with Gmaul. People often AFK there.
---
\-If youre good, Venenatis.
---
I think zuks max is 151, which is still beyond what anyone can boost to
---
A few years ago quest completion stats were released. Devious minds with 50RC req was the least completed one.
---
Because not everything needs to be gatekept.
---
Whats the point in the devs spending weeks on a quest if only a small percentage of the playerbase will ever play it
---
Does the farming level affect the yield of herbs from each patch?
---
Moving on.
---
Grow up dude.
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
From the wiki:
---
" As the rates use the player's base level, [temporary skill boosts](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Temporary_skill_boost) such as the [dragon pickaxe](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_pickaxe)'s [special attack](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special_attack) or invisible boosts in areas such as the [Woodcutting Guild](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Woodcutting_Guild) do not affect the rate at which players can obtain these pets.[\[3\]](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pet#cite_note-3) "
---
Bursting nechs is good because you get a ton of shards on your way to a higher mage level. You also make like 100k/hr afte rune costs.
---
Suddenly all the trees are mysteriously wearing dhide

Is that the helm they made for the Doritos partnership?
---
Awesome thank you
---
Whats your fishing lvl?
---
Yes, we can do this :)
---
Congrats bud
---
This is one of the places where attachscape *really* isn't necessary. The base item is extremely cheap, tradeable, and freely available. Just make the new helm drop fully completed from the new monsters.
---
S
---
Nice.

i wish that was an actual feature. Jamflex, where you at? smh

yeah, ignore the quest requirement and how much it's going to cost.

If you can't do any of those you're out of luck. You sound pretty damn impatient if you can't possibly train it at cows, maybe a btw isn't for you? You probably could've done a good chunk of it in the time it's taken you to make this post and get answers lol.
---
I needed a jug of water for a quest and thought I could save 10 seconds by decanting, but ended up spending 5 seconds teleporting near somewhere with a sink in the end
---
it's literally just gatekeeping

and they're absolutely oblivious to it
---
It's dropped from a lv 60 slayer creature, wont be high priced regardless after a month or two
---
Not only that he was wants to be a btw as well lol

Glad he picked one name out of that randomly generated list.

they can't even affort it to being with

---
Welcome to out reddit community
---
absolutely needs to require fremennik exiles to wear, 100%
---
otherwise it's just a cheap one-up on the serp helm.
---
That's true, but future items could also be combined with it to increase the max hit further. Not to mention that this doesn't have the negative stats in mage/range like the Serp helm is. I think it'll end up being a very good item even if it doesn't increase melee dps over the Serp helm atm. This thing won't use charges which is also a plus.
---
The thing is, they literally cannot give us less of a str bonus upgrade even if they wanted to. 
---
If +1 str bonus is enough to complain about power creep, we're going to end up getting no str bonus upgrades in future and pvm gear will become stale unless they add better attack bonuses which will increase accuracy and, therefore, dps too. We'll end up getting reskinned bandos armour with identical stats if we keep complaining about +1 increases.
---
It's a tough problem to combat.
---
You need to wear the armour 
---
Most players will be at the Grand Exchange, north western part of Varrock. Otherwise I'd recommend hopping to a more populated world.
---
God imagine not knowing what a joke is.
---
Must be difficult being such an angry autist every day.
---
It's dropped by a lv 60 slayer creature and the requirements are minimal. Wont cost much after 2-3 months
---
king crab boss
---
This hurts on a personal level...
---
1/5k? I guess it would make the helm upgrade very expensive... I could get behind it.
---
55 rcing??? Oof, hope this releases summer of 2k21.
---
id rather see the faceguard as a drop from Dagganoth Kings instead
---
We don't need more BIS items just for the sake of having a BIS item. You can already stack people for their entire hitpoints with the amount of overpowered gear added and this will make the problem worse so unless you can convince me otherwise I'll vote no.
---
Why the fuck would I use melee when range is bis
---
Will this quest come with any un-polled graphical reworks?
---
I think you need to manually toggle on the loot tracker, it will appear as a permanent tab on the sidebar once on
---
Most people highly rate the GPU plugin. Try that out. I personally can't use it since it crashed my laptop but most people don't have this issue 
---
Probably my favourite plugin in menu entry swapper. So you can customise some left and right click options (bankers become left click bank instead of left click talk etc).
---
The nerve on this guy. Literally posts asking for help 3 days ago for an infernal setup then rags on a guy that does it for the gear he is wearing...
---
Congrats man. Post your cape up **if** you ever get it so we can all shit on your setup too
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
Either burst nechs/jellies/dust devils or kill hill giants
---
Ironman is boring because of the none pvm grinds. If I could play ironman without having to do all the tedious stuff that makes skilling even more effort than it already is I'd happily play it. Different strokes I guess, but I like untradeables.
---
so you acknoledge that justiciar is ruining the achievment of the infernal cape. good. were done here
---
raids 1 and also this new helm would be good there too since its better than serp
---
The rain forest is basically always burning, but not too this extent. Illegal logging and clearing of the jungle has lead to a lot of dry product on the forest floor that the fires feed on, leading to one of the biggest fires in history.
---
I thought one of the mods said the majority of the zulrah people weren't bots and were actually really world traders but they couldn't ban them unless they actually broke the rules...
---
They’re the same people who would complain about beating Castlevania using Holy Water. Yes it’s really strong, yes it reduces the difficulty, and yes it’s part of the game. 
---
I’d be clowning all over that dude if he used full justicar to beat like demon slayer or some shit, but why not use the best tools for the hardest jobs?
---
Don't ever post again.
---
Why would you farm dark totems? You'll get them from training slayer regardless
---
The go and play ironman with the rest rusty helmet bois where you belong
---
Lol I've protected a bunch of people. I'd rather pk some salad robes loner risking 500k ish in gear overall than a guy doing MA2 risking like 100k worth of pots
---
It's a minigame dedicated to griefing and fucking over other players. What more can you ask for you helmie
---
They are adding group ironman at somepoint but we don’t know when. Honestly, you could just restrict yourself in game to not use GE and only trade with each other
---
Let’s be real, I’m sure a lot of these kids are mad that you have a full set of Justiciar.
---
Its ridiculous that jagex still hasnt shut down these scum. BA is such a shit minigame and this makes it worse
---
Yes thats literally his point, serp is the only better helm
---
who are u
---
Irony*
---
And I'm not agreeing with the post so this isnt irony at all lol, quite the opposite actually
---
Locking it behind the Fremennik Exiles is definitely the way to go. The Fremmy Isles unlocks the Neitz, it only makes sense that the next tier unlocks the better helm
---
I went to 96 firemaking then finally got full set lol
---
Hell, even Helm Of Neitiznot (f) I’d prefer.
---
As I'm an innocent victim of their bot detection system I totally relate to this post. Worst experience I've had with Jagex in 15 years.
---
But that is the perfect advice. It's shark fishing vs minnows. "You can do it this slow way and you will eventually get what you want, or put in more effort, and get your goal done sooner."
---
Damn dude nice rng I have 400 done on the dot and only holy sandals
---
you can tele home and walk away at any point safely lol
---
Wilderness until 60, then do the Seees Diaries. The 5 Marks of Grace you will get between 54-60 is not worth the much slower xp.
---
Definitely lock it behind the Exiles quest.
---
Better for the devs to add content without consulting players' opinions at all?
---
Lol I was making fun of the people who say that about BA. but how did you know I’m a helmie . Teach me to Reddit.
---
Didn't even think about that, rip serp helm
---
Giant spiders in level 3 stronghold or the newish ogres you unlock after Corsair cove.
---
Have you tried taking the plug out and blowing on it?
---
You know you can level melee stats without changing your combat level, right? As long as your ranged lv x 1.5 is greater or equal to your att plus str lvs, you're good.

All of these are with super set + Piety:

Youre not even guaranteed to keep the cape if you cheat it either I guess lmao

Either way, whats your response to the tbow argument?
---
I think that if you consider justiciar to be a cheat then you should consider tbow an even bigger cheat as its a much larger difference, and if youre going to shit on people for using certain items then you should at least be consistent with it.
---
But I bet Tbow is alright because you used it huh?
---
Sounds good to me, fuck chargeable armour
---
&gt; which lead to naming my own choob account 
---
Not even gonna ask :)
---
Can't say I like the better droprate when on task. Keep the droprate consistent, being on task boost the kills per hour significantly.
---
Also 100% lock the helm behind the Exiles quest.
---
I don't mind the jaw being tradeable (provided it only drops after the quest).
---
That’s how I feel lol
---
No Jmod to help ?
---
How about the authenticator delay silence?
---
Because they want to get Skotizo kills and maybe elite/master clues
---
donny you fuckin druggo
---
69/420
---
thats a way to overcomplicate things
---
maintenance costs makes the item way less valuable, you'll see scythe price keep going below 500m, as its 1'3m/h to use, once all raiders got one, who are FEW, new production wont meet any extra demand so flow of new scythes will cannivalize its price a lot, could as well drop 60% just rapier/sanguinessi/avernic will be more expensive because of balancing out incentives
---
I ran out of examples lmao
---
He will teach me it once he gets back from the store
---
If you want to instant PK go play an RSPS or something, this will never, ever happen. It's terrible for starting players who dont have the bank to insta buy 94 magic via alch, or high range via cannon (could go on all day). Also, a game which supports macroing will be exploited to breaking point. Venezuelas economy would thrive, but the game would not.
---
i would be okay with this if the helmet was not trade-able and you need like 80 smith/ craft to make. and fuck it! make everyone pay 1mil to take a fremmy "class" on how to make it. this would make a BIS item feel earned not just drop you slap on.
---
Because those clans have a higher standard of player skill than the minimum difficulty of the Inferno.
---
Once again, thats completely irrelevant, noone asked, the guys that upload justiciar infernos arent trying to apply to said clans.
---
Time invested doesn’t disqualify something from being BiS...
---
The attachment is a faceguard and for an increase in stats, there should be a cosmetic change to match. I just don't see #3 being that.
---
Weath is horrible at his job. He will NOT reverse the ban
---
Lmfao cringe. op is about to get ran for some gp by a sweaty neckbeard pretending to be a girl
---
It's just screaming into an endless void though. Nobody who's so far gone that they'll actually get a sense of superiority from judging how someone got an inferno cape is going to change their minds because of a Reddit post. In fact they get a kick out of seeing people get butt hurt by it enough to react and it reaffirms their beliefs. They really need no attention, good or bad.
---
Why do they need to? Genuinely curious because lots of people at my university wear hats in class.
---
This is the biggest single feature for me - I don't love the way the helm of neitiznot looks. This new one though - that's hot
---
[DDS isn't affected at all](https://i.imgur.com/h9PnPeU.png) +1 str bonus definitely wont add +2 max hit to a dds so I think you might have done something wrong

Thorry but that's thmite tyson you have the wrong person
---
That is slightly funny lol
---
*nervously tucks away tinderbox*
---
Oh your spending time sleeping, eating, working, and doing the necessary duties to progress in society? You're basically paying 3m an hour
---
Ridiculous
---
I dont know but I do know I dislike you.
---
Never played wow. And just by looking at the screen, wtf am I looking at lmao
---
Make the helm and jaw untradable.
---
Its a master quest, not a grandmaster quest
---
Oh I used to be less skeptical. Let me know when you put too much trust in your irl friends and it comes back to bite you in the ass.
---
+6 str combined with the +5 prayer is a bit over kill honestly. +5 str would have been fine that serp isn’t completely killed off.
---
With +5: you still have the hybrid option with the helm and nice prayer bonus. 
---
As with serp you still have +5 str but lose the prayer and have negative range/magic accuracy but the trade off is +20 in most defense stats (besides magic, facegaurd is still better) and the venom effect/immunity.
---
Both would have good roles and wouldn’t kill each other off.
---
There was already a thread about this man
---
Oh I hate it, it's the first one I played because I just wanted to get it out of the way. I can't stand it though.
---
I think they are too casual rn, if you botted it shouldn't just ban the acc you did it on but also others you own.
---
Couldn't be worse than all the work they ppl ut into warding for it to be shot down xD
---
Fucked eyes? Unsure if trolling or just stupid
---
Nope, I think the RS experience is better when earning your own items
---
How can jagex call them RWTers if they haven't broken the rules.. if jagex is calling them goldfarmers ban them?
---
And then u need to walk back and reset the kill. Where as rc u can just stop clicking at any point except in the abyss and you're safe and u just pick up where you left off.
---
Group ironman when?
---
I think negative feedback can effect people. If you make a comment on someone's post and time after time hundreds of people think you're a pile of garbage for saying what you did, it can make a difference in a person. It's possible they eventually will look inwards and ask "wait.... am I being a pile of living garbage?"
---
omg i feel like its explaning to 3 year olds.
---
it doesn't matter if its best in slot item if it doesn't give you anything of value... aka saved time. more experience. it does none of that.

Love your redesign! The face mask on West's helmet makes me think of an evil clown smiling.
---
Thanks man appreciate it
---
Z spear is bis for corp and hasta bis for stab bonus. Bandos boots arnt bis cos its beaten by cerb which is a harder boss with higher pre req. And it is a rare drop from a hard boss that would be more expensive if there werent so many bots there
---
If he is then he might be my new favourite of the team. Best part of introducing my fronds to the game was telling them to go do that quest with everything they need on them and hearing their response as they read that.
---
Thanks, that's clarified a few things quite nicely!
---
No proof other than knowing folks who are victims of his ineptitude and having access to wrongfully banned accounts. It happens literally every day
---
Oh was there? Mb lol. I don't think it can be said enough times though.
---
Well I mentioned it’s a master quest in my post so I knew that
---
You’re absolutely wrong, BiS = BEST IN SLOT, the cape is objectively, without any discussion, the best cape, it provides the best stats, therefore, even if it takes 10,000 hours to get, it’s still BiS, time has literally nothing to do with what makes something BiS
---
its too early for me to read everything in a list (of 3 items) apparently lol
---
Yes just use the other route
---
I didn't realise I had even gotten the first pet until at least 10 minutes of aimlessly doing agility out of my mind, wasn't even paying attention to the screen and I had my chat down so I didn't see the text for it at first.
---
Hasta are pointless. Save for 1 DWH, both lances. Use a tentacle whip in the meantime (Dragon sword for vasa crystals)
---
Yeah the 2nd is only if you want to go back up
---
Sure it's not 100% immortal but you can easily hunt in big batches, bank and repeat, with a really low death count.
---
Too dumb to even understand how to reply to comments. Don't know what else I expected from some 13 year old kid still using "you have two dads" as an insult.
---
Technically every time you Runecraft you're interacting with remnants of V's work. I certainly hope they don't merc him like in RS3, maybe since the final quest in this storyline is apparently going to reunite the Moonclan and Rellekka tribes we'll see him somehow.
---
This is absolutely the answer.
---
Stat restoration seems kind of broken at the moment.
---
Can we see something done about it?  
---
My suggestion is removing stat restoration from Clan Wars and moving every tier of the POH pool down one tier down, and then letting us "imbue" it with the Desert Amulet 4, so it's as good as it is now, but with what I think is more fitting requirements.

&gt;"elitism, but we'll attempt to artificially add extra negative connotations to it"
---
it is by default the negative version of elitism. elitists could be neutral and being elitist doesn't inherently imply you're gatekeeping. it is by definition the belief that a community should be led by the elite.
---
what's happening in the community is gatekeeping guised as "elitism", they pretend they're doing it to better the game or whatever self-righteous reason when in reality they just want to put others down and feel better about themselves doing it.
---
hurr durr what is 2+2

You mean you don't enjoy that fancy new bis crystal armor? 👉😎👉
---
Bruh. That’s literally a waste of tears xp. Make sure it goes into slow ass things like rc, mining, maybe wc, fishing, agility... not freaking cooking one of the easiest and fastest skills to level
---
He's a really picky eater, hardly will eat anything besides his catfood
---
Haven't done rfd or a RC god?
---
I'd say because it is a higher level degrading item. Not every degrading item is BiS, but if you have a Level 75 non-degrading and a Level 75 degrading, the degrading should be stronger; if it isn't, it is just worse.
---
Most your comparisons kinda fail to account for this. This isn't like upgrading from a Dragon Chainbody to Barrows (which upgrades from non-degrading to degrading btw). You are taking a Level 75 degrading item and replacing it with a Level 70 non-degrading item... It is like if you made a level 70 non-degrading weapons that were better than the Scythe and your reasonings is because "not all degrading items are good and scythe was BiS for years".
---
I have no issue with Neit getting an upgrade to make it better. But replacing a higher level degrading item with a non-degrading item is questionable for balancing. It would make the Serp pretty much useless; even more so than it did when they were both +3 Str since now it has a higher bonus, not tied, even if it costs an upgrade. The initial cost, and quest, are trivial when compared to upkeep costs and both helms should be useful, not one overshadowing the other. At the moment, the Neit is still useful since players don't want to pay the added cost of the Serp for +2 Str, but if you get one more Strength with no concern of cost, there is no choice; just one item replacing two and that sort of simplification is not great.
---
There's nothing racist about that comment.
---
Like with most things in life, always be a skeptic. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.

You will go triple the drop rate on one of those drops. You have now been cursed.

Kids who sink 10 hours a day on a clicking game don’t have the best social skills? Color me shocked.

I farmed 3k for the mutagen and didn't get one. Maybe this was a sign? Now I don't have to leave my mutagen helmet to gather dust. Daresay this crashes the serp helm.

Ping is mostly a meme, world feeling is determined primarily by player count. I have not felt that they're universally worse, no, but just choosing the lowest ping world and expecting good connection is misguided.
---
Why would you not like a new quest?
---
None, clans will rag you for 500k loot
---
This is very similar to either crystal singing items yourself or paying the elves extra to sing it for you. 
---
It’s not a bad concept, but it’s not a feature I want to see implemented immediately after an update that features it.
---
Raids hydra zulrah mostly. There's some other shit you can do with it, sara being the funniest, but most of it is meme stuff that isn't actually worth and is just fun to dick around with the bow.
---
So inconsequentially, this renders the serp helm as a niche item because of its immunity/ability to inflict venom damage. The str is a passive bonus as are the high defensive stats.
---
There are like 3 melee BIS items left that aren't tradable now, bit of a joke
---
I really hope they stick with mod wests, I think your proposal is nice but it doesn't feel like it really changes the helm at all.
---
alch yourself
---
How do I get it
---
Still fucking stupid to have to get a basilisk task
---
132 coins.. nice
---
IDK have you seen stuff like zenytes? Plenty to aim for.
---
He has black eyes, he has a little purple in his body so that explains where the purple comes from but I still don't think the eyes should be purple. They could add purple tips or something along those lines to keep the style
---
New uim storage method confirmed
---
i am taling no about drop rates but about user-pool
---
with 70 def there are +100k accounts, with 70 def, the skill reqs and quests ther are way less, the more elitist it iss, the less the sustainable price floor of the item, cuz new accs wont create competition on the demand side
---
Range, rigour, wooxwalk, and don't make mistakes. Every mistake you make basically costs you a kill per trip. It sounds like overstatement but with perfect execution you can do a kill with 2-3 food and if you tank one fireball for 39 that's 2 food gone lol.
---
Yeah I'd prefer non purple eyes but I dont mind it tbh
---
Tears is already a thing. Do you mean Fist of Guthix?
---
guarantee i have higher zuk kc than you will ever get
---
It's only a master quest. Not grandmaster.
---
asap needes
---
??? Sote was like 3 weeks ago tf u mean finally
---
My method of completion so far has been to not complete it. Get good
---
Yes it is a niche item as it should imo. 
---
The str is a passive bonus on the new nezzy too, what’s your point?
---
habeeb it
---
My theory is that it is rising because I've been saving for one and the game doesn't want me to have nice things...
---
I'm not too sure on the requirements but the saeldor blade seems like it will become a 70def pure meta wep and rapier will continue to, in my eyes be, endgame all purpose weapon and prices will continue to reflect that
---
Ensouled heads with cannon is fairly afk and cheap prayer xp also. Alot less banking then gilded alter
---
that's because your brain is smooth

What exactly do you need?

---
Oh is OP exclusively talking about ToB? In that case yeah. Also when I say slayer I guess I was including bossing. Meaning rapier for Grotesques, Cerb, and supreme. A lot of people don’t care if it’s 2nd BiS because of the charging factor they’d just prefer tent whip. (Not saying that’s right or wrong just a factor)
---
You could just use a leaf bladed battleaxe lol
---
lol same
---
fullgracefull
---
What are the other 3 items you are missing?
---
The new helmet will primarily be sought for its str bonus. This was once the serps initial feature tbh. No point; just talking about the items in general. I think this has been a good way not to nerf the serp(again reeeee wolf) and to implement a new item.
---
I think I speak for most when I say ideas like this are very welcome. It creates diversity in the midfield, doesn't break current methods (key to maintaining quorum) and perhaps most importantly, it's a bolt on to existing content rather than reinventing the wheel.
---
Good work.
---
The GE. You can also get it by killing the level 221 TzHaar-Ket located inside Mor Ul Rek. You'll need to have a fire cape to access them though.

Desert treasure added a whole new spellbook with the best combat spells in the game. It’s rare but not completely out of the question

I can enhance your next 2 trips to Dagannoth Kings only, I'm afraid

But to assume everyone is only doing something once thus encouraging them to take the lazier route seems incredibly flawed.
---
Yeah I guess, but elite and master clues take quite a while to obtain and the mimic rates could take hundreds of hours to get unless you’re buying dragon impling jars lol
---
Thanks
---
How much is it on the ge
---
will have the same bonuses as the Helm of Neitiznot but with the following additional stats:
---
Defence Bonuses
---
Stab: +36
---
Slash: +34
---
Crush: +38
---
Range: +34
---
Other Bonuses
---
Melee Strength: +6
---
Prayer: +3
---
The way this is worded makes it seem like these bonuses are going to be in addition to what the current helm has, but that can't be right can it? These are the actually stats of the helmet? Or is it gonna give +9 str and be super tanky?
---
SotE is grandmaster and has 70 requirements.  I think this fits fine.
---
you're both dumb
---
Lucky implings are fine.
---
Lol they don't release info like this until after the update has been introduced
---
Thank you very much! :) That's what I was aiming for. I will continue to make suggestions in that same spirit. I appreciate your support.

Well this makes me feel a little better about not getting a mutagen in 3k kc at zulrah! I won't be wearing the serp helm anymore.

Serp helmet wouldn't 'die' because its price is tied to Zulrah's scales, as you can dismantle the visage and get 20k of them. So that alone will hold up the price, just like high alchemy holds up rune prices.

Do you dislike seeing microtransactions for accelerated progression? If so, point for osrs. If not, point for rs3.

Do you want to partake in pvp? If so, point for osrs. If not, no sway.
---
Do you care about temporal consistency in lore? If so, point for osrs. If you don't mind that you can still do quests that led up to a major, world changing event after doing quests that came after, point for rs3. Rs3 has more quests as well.

Do you want a more traditional mmo experience with abilities, cooldowns, damage resistances, etc? If so, point for rs3. If you want something more unique that focuses on mastering and being consistent with a smaller variety of skills, point for osrs.

Do you like retro graphics, or does a consistent style mean a lot to you? If so, point for osrs. If you prefer something more modern, point for rs3.

Do you want a game that remains more consistent over time? If so, try osrs. If you prefer something with shake-ups, try rs3.

I do not like how the helmet looks, it looks fine but I'm would not be satisfied by the look, I don't want it to look to much like an the actual neitiznot helm. Some people quite like it but that doenst mean everyone thinks the same. You might not understand why someone would not like it, but that is your opinion. A discussion about a look of helmet doesnt need a detailed explanation. You either like it or you don't.
---
Yeah I don't mean die as in price wise, but die in terms of usefulness. I'm thinking the scenario goes more serps dissembled, more scales, lower scale cost.

Thank you for that.

You can also get it from other activities within the area. There is a shop that sells them for tokkul. That was a big chunk of the gp/h when fishing infernal eels.

The instance is optional, you get the privacy of being alone but the risk of losing stuff.

If you just kill it without the instance you can run and get it like any other boss.

The major part you missed is that serp helm requires charges. This helmet does not.

neitiznot is fine but burg is unwearable

What others have said + sire (if low on arclight charges mainly), jad tasks, inferno.
---
Wait is this your picture?
---
That is backasswards and contradicts itself. Nice attempt at a smart one liner fuckin loser.
---
Literally  clueless.
---
It's prolly the crack
---
It has other issues too, no doubt, OSRS isn't perfect either. But ask someone here why they hate RS3. Their answer will most certainly be "EoC".
---
Terrible idea. The bank is always safe. No need to mess with it.
---
Whooo can sayyy where the road gooooess
---
I mean obviously everything is subjective, but the only thing worse or close to equal in my mind is mining. Blast mining is tedious as fuck, 3 tick mining is just mega shitty, and mlm is only acceptably afk. The worst part about rc pre lvl 77 is just the constant attention required and emptying the essence bags. It’s not the worst thing possible in the world, but it’s pretty tedious and the xp rates make me sad.
---
Chill Steve.
---
Currently in world 365 at black chins, people can attack others with the coloured dark bow and then drop before dying so they risk nothing. It's untradable when changed to a coloured dbow. 
---
Can this be changed so they can't drop the coloured dbow in the wild as there is no other reason other than to avoid losing it which is not fair.
---
And if you can't do it only using your feet, you might as well just not do it cuz it's no longer an achievement.
---
When the trees burn, there won’t be any trees to chop chop
---
yeah it was me all three times
---
dO YoUr cLuEs
---
It's not even an expensive armor set anymore either
---
Yeah that’s a big one to avoid because wt is super easy and almost kinda half afk
---
A lot of people use this game to sub for real-life accomplishments, and every single one of those is going to either have to macro their way there, or spend a *whole* lot of time playing OSRS.
---
That affects the quality of some peoples' attitudes.
---
I don't want that to come off as having a superiority complex of my own about *not* being hypercompetitive; I'm just a random dude with a troubling observation.
---
People get nasty and elitist when games start to matter more than they should.
---
But if i were to get dclaws i would use those instead?
---
CONGRATS!! Inferno is one of my long term end game goals and I'm so far from it. Really impressive achievement.
---
Well sometimes i do screenshot with my potato pc, then again osrs crashes i have to restart.
---
Ok
---
Have you tried not smoking crack?
---
Improving at things is fun.
---
I would like to ask this question on behalf of all noobs on this subreddit:
---
What are those noted items, why are they worth so much and why was he holding them?
---
One pool will almost always land on the tile you're standing on when he fires the acid attack. Apart from that, there are a few tiles near the back of the room by the entrance where acid generally never lands. I use a DHCB so [in this image](https://i.imgur.com/8LA5b0M.png) I stand on the yellow tiles to attack Vork and I walk back one step to the green tiles during his acid phase, and I can usually avoid all damage. If using a blowpipe it can be a little more awkward to find a safe stretch of land, but that row near the front might still be worth going for. If woox walking with a blowpipe, this isn't really relevant to you.
---
In the post it says that jagex is providing a private (offline) world for this.
---
I have a couple reward suggestions to add to the Basilisk drop table that will give content to lower level accounts that have access to the Fremennik Province: 
---
Basilisk's tooth - This item would be tradeable and would be attached to the untradable fremenik helm with Thorvald's help creating koschei's Spangenhelm. This helm would have +2 strength, +1 prayer and the same defensive bonuses as a mithril med-helm. Requires 20 def to equip and fremmenik trials completed and would be untradeable. This item would be dropped by regular Basilisks as well as the Basilisk Knights but at a much lower drop rate(1/1k on task, 1/5k off task)
---
Basilisk's skull: This item would be tradeable. This item would be taken to an alter located in the daganoth king dungeon along with an archer helm, a seers helm, a beserker helm, suqah tooth, and dagannoth hide. The player will make an offering by constructing a pyre ship with the aforementioned items summoning a barbarian spirit. This spirit will grant the player with Horlov, a spanganhelm with +4 str +5 Mage and +5 range with the same defensive bonuses as an adamant med-helm. This helm would require 45 defense to wear with the completion of Freminik Exiles and would be untradeable. 
---
These helms would give both I initiate pures and zerkers a better footing in Edgeville PVP which is currently dominated by pures and mids. 
---
Notes: The Fremmenik helm currently has a 30 def requirement and the same stats as an addy full helm, adding the tooth to the helm would 'break' the helm resulting in lower defense bonuses and requirements. Basilisk's skull would drop exclusively for the new Basilisk Knights 
---
These items would break in PVP scenarios like other untradeables, dropping 100k for Horlov and 50k for koschei's Spanganhelm to the player who killed the wearer
---
Special Attacks are very situational depending on what you're doing. If you're just bossing, you should be using a melee spec attack for magic because there's just no good Magic spec attacks for PvM (which I'm assuming you're doing since you're using a Trident), so something like DClaws, DDagger, or Sara Godsword.
---
For Ranged, usually Blowpipe is a good enough spec attack, but if you're doing NMZ then you'll want to use Dragon Thrownaxes as a spec weapon.
---
I’m offended.
---
When will the new LMS and Bounty Hunter come out? Many in the PvP community have left the game or gone inactive. Since so many people blindly vote no to any PvP poll, could there be a separate polling system for the PvP Community? Maybe a requirement of 5 kills in the wilderness or something small.
---
i did inferno...with my vagina...unlubed
---
hasta
---
Intelligent retort.
---
????
---
How can you be this bad with ideas?
---
I mean....they're only worth a few mil, so even if they plummet to 0 that's all you lose. Wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
Seriously?
---
AFK construction? BUWAHAHAHAHAHA....
---
Fuck those bookshelves....
---
You realize those comments are either sarcasm to OPs elitist (satire) title or spergs that don't understand satire and don't represent the community at all?
---
Personally I would like to see the helm fill a different neiche. The serp uses up scales, and has negative range and mage. This helm is free to use, has more prayer bonus and more str. I would prefer if it has for example some accuracy instead and just +3 str so that different helms would be useful at different places.
---
I might be bias because I have a tanz serp helm and I don't want it to be dead content.
---
All ranged specs are worse than melee specs, so people use melee specs unless there is a reason not to
---
Right now training Prayer is just buy x number of Dragon bones and put them on a gilded altar (which is free to use) so I can see why people would want some change. I wish Ectofuntus was still relevant, it's such cool content
---
Thank you! Hopefully it still gives the bonus XP like the giant
---
Not noted items, they're teleport scrolls. They're worth a decent amount because they're all a bit difficult to get and take you to some otherwise hard to get to locations that are useful for one-offs like clue scrolls etc. I assume he had so much because he just withdraws his whole stack while doing clues so he doesn't have to bank, but to bring that stack in to the wildy is super stupid.
---
lol fuck
---
Those are teleport scrolls you can get from doing clue scrolls. You can put them in the black book he also dropped. I'm not 100% sure but I guess when he died the scrolls came out of the teleportation book.
---
Does it require you to be on task?
---
They’re not noted, just stackable teleport scrolls that all go in that book (so they only take up 1 inventory space in total)
---
They’re worth a lot because they tend to be some of the fastest ways to get to unusual places that don’t have other teleports like Mos LeHarmless, Tai Bwo Wannai or Lumberyard
---
When you've done it enough times you can see the splats go up in the air and interpolate where they will land in time to dodge them. Start moving as the throws them and then track the blobs that look like they'll land close to where you're headed with your eyes
---
Low tier bait
---
Elitism will destroy this community and this game if its left unchecked. You don't have big brain energy because you have the "optimal" build. People play games to have fun and fuck anyone who thinks people shouldn't have fun unless they do it their way.
---
teleports, some are only dropped by bosses while most of them are only dropepd from clue scroll rewards.
---
Spoiled?  Interesting choice of words, especially since you chose grinding ring imbues as the counter example.  But you seemed to just have missed my point.  Anyone can throw money at a game.  Not everyone kills vork 50 times.
---
Isn't it great?!?!?!? I love me some more slayer
---
even if the helm would disappear from game, all it would do is bring neitiznot helm ge price closer to the shop price.
---
He has that many because he legit just does clues as far as i know. 37,000 and as someone pointed out I'll killed him while he was doing his 1000th Master clue.
---
One of my clan mates ended up in one of his videos and everyone was trying to tele-other him all day today.  Lol
---
Because if you got downvoted the previous 2 times then it’s not gonna be any different the third time we see it
---
I like J1mmy's by release series. Very entertaining.
---
Opportunity comes once In A life time YO
---
Literally anything out of game offering rewards in osrs is lying
---
Thank you for the detailed response... As someone who has never broken 1m on their year old account. Even I can agree that was really stupid of him.
---
I find stopping and asking "are you having a bad day?" Usually gets them to step back and think about what they're doing.
---
I believe it makes them think "oh this is a person I'm talking to" or maybe it makes them reflect on their life. Either way whenever I ask this to someone who's been replying to my comments as soon as they're posted, they always take way longer to reply and it's usually way more civil.
---
"Increased drop rate while on task".
---
I think that is my least favorite "mechanic" they've ever added.
---
Great argument when inferno is actuallly one of the few things in OSRS that require skill and not just time. 
---
Like spending time bruteforcing the waves.
---
This is the part that hyped me up the most.
---
Those are teleport scrolls. You can only get them from clue caskets and the allow you to teleport some important clue locations and places where there is no standard way of teleporting i.e. spellbooks, oranate jewlerybox, and skill cape teles don't take you there.
---
If you do decide to go for the diary cape, boost everything you can with stews and other temporary boosts. It will save you lots of pain. Hah.
---
lvl 60  slayer only though. 9? lvls lower than mm2.
---
worm
---
Yeah same for farming, I went for profit over AFK lol
---
For the bows, I would always recommend just fletching the highest level bow you can (except magic shortbow) because its always a bit better experience. Profit will be lower for shortbows, sure, but fletching usually isn't done for profit, even if the incidental profit can be nice. I agree with you for the most part but don't know how to say that\^\^ succinctly in the thread lol
---
In my experience with WT, since fletching and adding to the brazier both get interupted by damage, you have to click significantly more when you're fletching instead of burning the logs directly.
---
How do the dungeon doors work? Is it with the butler? I've never tried it but would be interested in learning more.
---
When the only thing that sets you apart from others is how many times you performed the same repetitive task, how else are you supposed to feel superior to other players?
---
It’s all about the nostalgia brother.  We want it looking just as it did when we were younguns
---
For real. I just started my first RS character in 12 years about 2 months ago. I’ve seen seen such elitism in an MMO community before. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve bene called a scrub because of my total level and the armor I’m wearing and it’s just like dude.. I gotta play the fucking game the progress here, whata you want me to do?
---
Check out classic there are people forming random queues lol
---
I don't think you understand how annoying his title for the post is.
---
I hear that some of the production lunar spells are good.  Tan Leather (120k xp/hr), String Jewelry (150k xp/hr), Plank Make (165k xp/hr), might be more I cant remember.
---
Nice, I'll add that. Seems like there's a lot of good fishing methods :) Do the fishing spots move at about the normal rate?
---
Ive been through this scam before. The scammer will tell u to log onto a pvp world with all your stuff banked. He will say someone is dropping “x” amount and u should log onto the same spot and pick it up rq and anti scam. They will let u do it. They will then split the drop with u which is probably 2-4m in value. Then the same guy will ask u to follow him and anti scam more people like this. He will ask u to wear your best gear and bankstand in ge for lurers to approach u. (His alt/friend) after which he will tell u to go with the flow and listen to the lurer and he will claim to log onto the spot that you tell him to stand on where the lurer will drop the items. Meanwhile they will ask u to wear “x” item after they tell u they wanna make a video of pking that “x” item. In the end they hope u believe them and ask the original lurer to log on you but he wont and they will skull trick u and kill you.
---
Castle wars is where maxed mains with maxed gear go to “finally play the game”
---
How about we don't need another fucking slayer dungeon.
---
grandmaster which sote is has lvl 70's so what would be good master?
---
Middle one reminds me of Bane from Batman.
---
Where at?
---
I like how were skipping over the fact that he had an elysian and a tbow, rich mofo needs to be knocked down a peg.
---
Also people like myself that use guides to save time getting all the items during the quest.
---
Was gonna type this haha
---
I know right????
---
There's also a link to the same website in the account management tab down next to your friends tab.
---
Please explain
---
Value to lower tier bones
---
By that logic pretty much all BiS gear isn’t worth it due to the cost of acquiring it.
---
You could try if you haven’t already. 
---
Settled morrytania uim
---
Verf karamja uim
---
Torvesta 
---
And jimmys quest by release is pretty good.  
---
Depends what you’re looking  for.
---
I know, I've already ran through a bunch of different weapons including the ags in one of my other comments
---
Devious Minds also had NO quests after it. It was a one off quest with no reason to complete it. Stack that with a rc req and ofc its going to be the leats completed quest
---
Nope, nor does it matter if people are using automation to brute force your account
---
Ah, my bad.  I mean when they say "you can kill this monster as part of a slayer task" its kinda implied that you need the task.  I didnt figure theyd sike me out 2 sentences later.
---
CHOFL
---
It is impossible to get 1 shot no matter how bad your spawn is if you react fast enough.
---
Np:) goodluck on your cape;)
---
obs is free and easy to use 
---
But runelite isn’t laggy at all for me it’s probably a problem on your end
---
I'm not sure saying calling out elitists is analogous to elitists ragging on people for 'lesser' achievements. One is inherently toxic while the other is not.
---
However just because calling out elitists isn't inherently toxic doesn't mean you have a right to be vitriolic in your callout
---
Fucking yikes dude.
---
As a pker who often found himself lobbied, i feel its positive effects first hand. Such a small amount of pking overall happens in bh/pvp, pkers previously would sit afk for minutes at a time waiting for someone to appear rather than face the hop timer
---
I haven't done all the GM quests in RS3 but in my experience, OSRS GM quests are longer on average. RS3 has WGS which is really long but the rest of the quests are about the same or shorter than OSRS GM quests.
---
There's some drama over who they allow at their events and what kind of speedruns are allowed, but at the end of the day it's a gaming charity stream, so they're definitely good guys.
---
My b, I consider doing going and killing.
---
Thanks, feels like I’m getting close same setup but no ely using crystal shield.
---
It's a lot more even when you look up OSRS. Still WoW has more interest.
---
Netherlands represents well for OSRS interest.
---
Having the same prob rn
---
I never said you were good at it.
---
🤔
---
LMFAO!
---
Aah thanks!
---
I am not opposed to a new bis STR, but having it on a non-degrading helm that also has a +3 prayer bonus, locked behind only a master difficulty quest? Not so sure about that myself.
---
“SuPeR tOxIc”
---
You’re literally a bot on osrs too
---
I think it should have raised defense bonuses, and no str increase or maybe +1 str, not +2 from helm of neitz. The helmet looks more defensive, like the full helm version of something, not more aggressive. Plus if str is +6 it will really kill serp helm value.
---
The biggest is for Prince Ali Rescue. You can talk to Lady Keli to get the key mould before even starting the quest. This saves you a trip back and forth from Al kharid!
---
Yeahhhhh I feel you. I definitely want a method to denote a bit more about each method, but I also want it to be concise. Maybe some sort of symbols would be a good idea. Ooh or maybe a chart.... I dunno I'll look a bit more into formatting. Thanks :)
---
Wow someone submitted something that will be declined! Upvote!
---
its not an achievement worth posting i think just like the fire capes, thousand of ppl already did inferno
---
ur not special
---
You can just add the jaw to the nezzy and sell the new helm.
---
Love how quickly you guys respond to feedback, mad props, you guys are awesome.
---
Then we will *hug* in the shade
---
Uhhh...ok. 
---
Done.
---
Same problem for me too. Works fine on another device (till this happens) then I can swap back to the original
---
The downvotes id assume are your pretentious way of writing plus your response. It’s not because west has a “luxury” it’s that his design was better. Take some criticism and fix it or move on.
---
its not about dps its about stacking hits to ko. Since you cant really stack 2 melee hits its harder to go scim to 2h and get a kill.
---
Right they are dead so give them some love, and they can do fremmy isles, I had one for awhile before I made it into a zerker, I agree that maybe the second reward is a little strong, it would probably be better balanced at +4 str rune med defense and +0 mage and range
---
The helm remains tradable only the middle piece between nezzy and the new helm doesnt. You can still buy the nee full helm of the GE, you just cant buy the jaw.
---
Why do you think the Achievement tag exists on the Reddit?

Agdq is a yearly speedrunning marathon, a straight week of speedrunning.

You have to submit runs to be selected to appear in the marathon, so who knows if this will get it, but it would be cool to see!

Thats what happens if u xo waste for 30 mins
---

The stream ends at 6pm, I’m guessing that’s when they go home so they probably wouldn’t want to do one after hours. I agree though, I love the quiz but I don’t like that it takes away from Q&amp;A time

ikr lol

"new". Yeah you're the 11th person this week to post this.
---
The name of the song is "I wanna fuck you" unless you're talking about the blasphemous version on the radio.

Here to say I got the pet at 42 kc (sick brag, I know) and another at an unknown kc &gt;1000
---
You should go loot in edgeville. World 308. A bunch of pkers hang out in the wilderness and 1v1 eachother. Pick up the adamant arrows and sword fish, bank and repeat. You’ll make about 100-200k per hour. Just did this last week on my new account :)
---
Hyper casuals dont earn zuk capes
---
Is your day really that slow?
---
Yeah with cheat engine
---
Interesting, I am able to login via android, but not from desktop.
---
Same for me, I can't log in on osbuddy runelite or normal launcher. But can on mobile
---
Awesome PK
---
I have a feeling this is a circa 2007 story and not a recent one
---
Oh no it's definitely poorly worded, I was confused the first through read-throughs as well until I realized what they meant. It should be worded either what you said, or show a table of current stats vs the proposed face guard's stats.
---
iOS works fine as does my android phone. I can login to my alts but my main on PC is blocked. There’s another post where some dude found out his entire account is blocked.
---
Mine happened when I went to switch world, kicked me off and can not login now on PC
---
SoF was already in the game at this point, i'll @ you all day.
---
Still mad at jamflex for eoc
---
Man that makes sense but damn I hope people from your own family can look past that.
---
On most things venom doesn't guarantee activation with those weapons unless you're also wearing a serp since makes the venom chance on hit 100% instead of 25%. Are the ToB purple spiders different?
---
In my oppinion though I’d rather see the gear receive better over all buffs, (to stats) and slightly lesss specific to waterbirth island.
---
Rockshell would be T65 upgraded and be slightly weaker than dragon, but have accuracy bonuses. (And about 20% accuracy and damage buff to waterbirth, maybe make the special attack of the sword apply everywhere too)
---
Spined be equal to back dhide, but slightly less defence, and 20% boost to waterbirth 
---
Skeletal be similar to infinity robes but much tankier and deal 20% more to waterbirth.  
---
All 3 be T65 and require 65 defence. 
---
Still fuckin awesome though.
---
Can i ask a question? Ive been away from the game for a few months. Was this content mentioned in the past? Despite not playing i do follow reddit and kep up with the updates but i never heard about this.
---
Im guessing this is content to be done next year if it passes the poll which it probably will. Also is this content being worked on seeing as warding failed? 
---
these are all shit. why the shit do we want a helm that looks identical to the one we already have
---
haha im so silly guiz i said sumthing i kno community will get &gt;:( about haha am i get attention now haha so silly
---
Ah is it actually? The explicit version on streaming services is titled “I wanna love you” even tho it says fuck. I guess I never thought about it lmao
---
i dont think it should be here but since it is then like low cb lvl inferno capes and no supply inferno capes, 3 cb corp kill etc. real achievements
---
I too like Mod West's design and it makes more sense how it should look based on the jaw drop that is attached.
---
Me and my family are sleeping don't @me please
---
Could maybe be buffed now that it's not BiS.
---
Fair enough. Well thought out suggestion.
---
If they ever add new random events they have to use these models
---
Probably not
---
fyi this is the guy who took 100+ tries or whatever before finally managing it with justiciar and the next day made a serious post shit-talking people with fire capes
---
the only reason yesterday's post got any heat is because he similarly said firecapes should be removed. Obviously it was a joke but it doesn't seem that different from people ragging on him for using gear that trivializes the inferno (though even with justiciar/ely/tbow it's obviously way harder than the fight caves)
---
Thanks :) What would you change, if anything?
---
This triggered my PTSD
---
Omg! That's the same day as Mod Archie's birthday!
---
He's really not too hard, just gotta practice.
---
Complaining about justiciar for inferno directly links to people feeling attacked for using it in the inferno so it's definitely not something someone can complain about without also getting downvoted/called elitist.
---
.. Fuck off Clarence
---
wepay2pk
---
&gt; elitism in general is not that bad in rs
---
That is just false. This is the only mmo I've ever played where I consistently get flamed for being bad (which of course by bad they actually mean using some training method they don't personally like), and this is doubly ironic because this is probably the lowest skill cap mmo I've ever played. Combat wise the game is very, very shallow. There's some tick manipulation and understanding how your character moves, but that's about it.
---
Yea the I can log in on 1 platform but not another is weird. I'd think if someone were brute forcing your account it'd lock you out entirely, not just on desktop and not mobile, then again, mobile and desktop did used to have separate login timers so idk...
---
And he’s playing hunter 🥵
---
Would it still be more worth it to wear slayer helm on tasks?
---
Are tan leather and string jewelry afk? I thought they were pretty click intensive but I may be remembering wrong
---
The waves weren't made with justiciar and bulwark in mind and neither do i think they understood how big of a difference it would be in inferno when they polled it.
---
And you can see that in this clip where he's just mindlessly running around in the second hardest wave.

Tars for herblore
---
I care. I love seeing people excited about their achievements.
---
Currently to attach a Sigil (elysian/arcane/spectral) to a Blessed Spirit Shield, you can either do it yourself with 90 prayer and 85 smithing, OR you can pay Abbot Langley 1.5m gp to do it with no requirements.
---
I noticed that if you try to attach a Holy Elixir to a regular Spirit Shield, you can only do it if you have the 85 prayer req, theres no option to bypass this with a payment. This seems odd and out of line as this one has lower requirements but technically has higher requirements as you can just pay for the other one. Is there a reason for this?
---
You currently can't even boost your prayer to attach the Elixir onto the Shield.
---
but how does that answer the question "What are the sequence breaks involved in a Champion's Guild run?"
---
lol no one realises this is a troll
---
Uim btw
---
I got Rocky and rift guardian pre 99 but tangleroot im coming up on 40m dry
---
I get you wanna run clues fast but this is just actually brain damaged. Why do you need to carry this much on you?
---
I just started on a new account three weeks ago. I haven't fought a single boss, and my Slayer level is only 21 so far. I have hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of enjoyable/viable gameplay left in PvM alone before I ever even have to start thinking about endgame boredom.
---
You should get blues clues decorations
---
Defense doesn't affect how much damage an attack deals just how often it hits, attacks that hit deal 0-max regardless of how much defense the target has.
---
The bots are gonna start Botting oh no
---
I suppose I'll pull out my old dusty laptop and see if I can sign in on that. I can't play on my iPhone the screen is just too damn small.
---
Gz hope your enjoying your time with osrs
---
OSRS is a very casual game, even the hardest challenge isn't hard compared to some of the other games out there.
---
I knew that this thread was going to be full of people campaigning to make everything easier the second I saw the OP. 
---
I genuinely think that theres an even worse attitude in the community than elitism, and that's acting like everyone who disagrees with you is a sweaty neckbeard who has nothing in their life other than RS. People are incapable of rationalizing that achievements in a video game CAN have value. 
---
Theres a huge portion of the community that achievements in RS have no value because the game doesn't "take any skill, and thus there's nothing wrong with devaluing them, as they have no value in the first place. It's a pretty frustrating attitude to see and makes me question why these people are even playing RS in the first place. 
---
The truth is, a lot of the people getting mad at elitists for shitting on others achievements are the same that will shit on someone for feeling proud of 99 Rc or any other Skilling based accomplishment.
---
Yikes!
---
Honestly I think there is a lot of room for content here but the amount of parts required to make everything is a little confusing at first glance
---
Was literally making a joke about this exact mentality

Can you guys stop arbitrarily restricting where you can cannon? You can cannon daggs, but not the new knights in the same dungeon. Unless these are a boss, which it doesn't sound like they are, this is completely arbitrary.  
---
So sick of every new slayer monster being a tedious grind for new items before it gets blocked again. At least give a legitimate reason beyond "We don't want these to be enjoyable to kill" on why you can't cannon them. We have enough shitty tasks from the last slayer update that you can't cannon.

Yeah that's the joke dingus

IDK, why did people not want a new skill? Some people are just neophobic.

The can't ban a gold farmer until the account does something wrong.

Now that you mention it, it might be more click intensive to get the faster XP rates, since the auto cast is fairly slow

# ranged gear questioné
---
I have been rocking a green d hide shield for ages now (84 rng)
---
ive been grinding for the odium shards and hard clues but unlucky af...
---
is there an easy alternative i could go for ?
---
thanks a lot me dudes
---
As someone pointed out, different people. My bad.
---
I have had numerous times where I kill a pvmer/ non pker in the wild, and they specifically say that they are going to vote no to pvp content as they drop.  So “killing a player doesn’t make people spite vote” seems like its up for debate to me.
---
V isn't just a character from RS3. He is referenced in OSRS in the moonclan book.
---
Not even gloves? What gloves beat barrows? Hydra gloves are bis for melee and they require ds2 which is BASICALLY gotten to by doing RFD. And 200qp and a 3+ hour quest isn’t exactly a quick thing to do.
---
how many hours is 55-77

Have you guys ever seriously discussed adding a Completion Cape to Old School? It would solve tons of problems with content that isn't played much (Trouble Brewing, Castle Wars, etc) and would add something for people to do after maxing or even during maxing. As is, there's really no point in completing majority of things after maxing all skills in the game as there's really no incentives to do so.
---
Music Cape has plenty of requirements already. Making it easier to obtain this track would still require the completion of an elite/master clue which is not an easy thing to do already. Locking achievements behind rng is annoying. This is the reason they made the kq head a guaranteed drop after a certain kc. They should do the same with mimics.
---
That's sort of the irony of the situation, though. A lot of people are congratulating him on the cape, a difficult achievement, by shitting on the fundamental principle of achievement in this game in the first place. 
---
But yeah, the dude is right. If you actually think the Lions share of this community is elitists then lmao
---
(p++) is the same amount of characters as (unf) but it's spaced correctly
---
Couldn't have said it better myself m8
---
&gt;I think implying that you won't also get better at the game by completing the inferno with Justiciar is the probably here.
---
Completing the inferno in anyway will help you improve for sure, but comparing the two the non-tank method definitly helps you improve far more.
---
&gt;Still requires a ton of skill.
---
People, especially on reddit, hype it up as a bigger challenge than it really is, the vast majority of which havent even set foot in it themselves.
---
Then u should know how easy it is, i have infernal cape on pure and 80hp zerker, got my first infernal cape on max acc in 2 days with ahrims crystal shield, armadyl and t bow, and i have done inferno for fun on main after that, and i need maybe 1-2 brew mostly for zuk, its so easy to do inferno with max gear its unreal, the content in runescape atm compared to gear is trash, gear is way too good for what content osrs has.
---
I did astral but zmi didn't exist then. Do zmi if you have the mage level for Ourania tp.

Screw that place, even when it's one of the best starting methods for Ironmen - I'm doing Agility path instead, then **MAYBE** Wintertodt if I am still playing after reaching my goal.

Nah, i went into the ironman cc a few years back to call out a d imp. Someone pointed out i was a 1 def pure and said i was lying. The whole cc believed the ironman and flamed me for being a pure, so i went on my main and caught the d imp myself. Even now, i started my iron 2 months ago and checked out the ironman cc again and theyre full of elitist thinking theyre the best, and flame any other game mode.
---
it hasnt even been polled yet my friend, settle down

I expected more but brings back nostalgia when nezzy helm was BiS 9/10

&gt;Also, It'd be nice to have a crafting stat that wasn't a sink.

Money is good, I'll give you that.

You can save money in future too by buying raw and cooking your supplies

I made 500m dicing, loved that time
---
Closed is better.

This is the "calling out racism is actually the true racism" of runescape. News flash if people werent elitists they wouldnt have these threads in the first place.
---
Make helm +5 str. That way it's not a straight upgrade from serp.
---
i kind of liked it i guess, i really missed messing around with friends just trading and doing shit in the wild. also, scammers/rwters found their ways around the trade limit
---
I really dont get the RC bad joke.

It's a million times better than thieving or losing mils training construction or herblore.

Holy shit that burn

Get the water
---
I like that, you snooze you lose. That's true, I guess some kind of embarrassment related to me not picking it up and the 'value' that I perceive it, like it would annoy me if it despawned without me picking it up as well.
---
Where did I say anything about slurs
---
Anyways have fun giving money to a stream that's showcasing someone do tutorial island on a private server lol
---
Could the "Clear Redwood" option on the patch in the Farming Guild be moved down the list of options, or, alternatively, removed?
---
Clearing the patch requires paying Alexandra anyway, and it is easy to misclick when trying to climb up the rope ladder.
---
Thank you.
---
Hell yeah.  I'm excited :)
---
Sick addition to such a nostalgic piece. Glad to upvote on this one.
---
Yours is better, fits the Viking theme thematically. The other one looks like a it's got some cartoon teeth like a Halloween mask.

This was never me lol. Why would I ever be excited and proud of literally doing nothing special. It's like when moms post on facebook that their newborn took its first shit in its pants.. hell yeah grats.

Who woulda know that a joke turned into a way to attract interested people? ;)

If they're doing it then it probably works. People are out here anti-scamming anti-scammers, it's ridiculous.
---
That's actually not a bad idea I just don't think I can get proof of them deleting my email. It sucks they make this account recovery so difficult for people. I get they want players to have as much security but God forbid something happens it's almost slim to none odds getting your account back. Thanks for your advice.

Break the Edicts of Guthix so Zamorak can be his dad.

Yeah idk how people complain so much about getting torso and not void...torso I got in 2 hours with randoms after work in a hotel room...void I've spent like 6 hours so far and only have the shirt, legs, and gloves.  I quit bc I was too bored it was making me want to totally quit the game.
---
I've never seen this exact scam before but usually it's something like they stall you at the trade screen and hope you lose track of time, trusting the person you're on call with so they can pick up the TBow, or they cancel the trade or something when they think you click accept so you accidentally click the boat instead and lose your items.
---
Or because a new BIS strength helm was announced?
---
Shut the fuck up sweaty neckbeard. Stay mad
---
I'm sure it works, I just want to know how.
---
&gt;Still gotta unlock the quest to use them tho?
---
You unlock one of the items, you can buy the other. Therefore you're not required to unlock the ferocious gloves by yourself.
---
&gt;They’re not a “let me just buy these real quick” gloves like regen brace/ granite gloves.
---
They're "to make this bis just lemme buy this upgrade."
---
You literally put a bar across the regular helm and used the wings from the new one.
---
are you trolling or are you earnestly like this

You must have really long arms then

---
Less of an upgrade than whip was over dscim upon release.  More gear gets added over time, get over it.  Part of an mmorpg is new content, and we have an extremely robust dual consent system where not only do the devs have to agree to make something, but as few as 26% of the playerbase can veto new content.  As such, bis will change over time.  This is natural, and trying to tell people theyre not allowed to use certain gear for certain content is laughable.  If you have an issue with the power level of content, criticize from that end, instead of whinging at people playing the game with gear you dont like.
---
 \&gt;The blowpipe 
---
Funny you should mention the bp -Ive noticed literally no one tries to talk shit at people for bringing a bp to Zuk, despite the fact that its the biggest example of power creep since osrs shipped.  Therein lies your hypocrisy-just because it shipped before zuk means suddenly its a "kosher" overpowered weapon.  You create this mythology of items you claim are too powerful and youre a noob for using them - this mythology being entirely arbitary (for example, justiciar is like, not even the 4th biggest upgrade for inferno) and based off of a small circlejerk of really toxic people that have realized they will literally never achieve anything special like Woox or Rendi, and everything you will ever achieve in this game is mirrored by countless thousands.  And instead of taking the hint and playing a game with more actual challenging content, youd rather stratify and gatekeep to pretend youre a special zukflake.
---
Any random who approaches you with a neat little trick to anti-scam is trying to scam you. No one would bring a stranger in unless they want to scam them.
---
NUT
---
Think most of them just accept the small risk for the convenience whilst farming masters.
---
considering its just an upgrade to the helm and not a new item, I think it's pretty fitting.
---
&gt;I think it's more of a griefing issue (closing doors to get in the way of the runner), and potentially availability (dependency on servers to run the block)
---
Obviously
---
Not sure why then they would pick an MMORPG for the stream then
---
huh, i actually didn't thinked about brews reducing my magic level, which means less magic defense. if you didn't told me, i'd just be full of brews and drink all of them every hit, which would make me an easy target lol but thanks for telling
---
Berate me even more that will show them.
---
I feel that. The game is great and all and it's nice that we get updates for it but man, I think that digging into XP rates and drop rates and the mechanics of the game kind of killed most of the "awesome" factor for me. If you had told 12 year old me that I'd have 90 Slayer and could go kill dark beasts, I'd have been like FUCK YEAH DUDE LETS GO because it was a high requirement and it was a fuggin DARK BEAST DUDE. 
---
If I get a beasts task now? Eh. Loot is sub par, can find better exp elsewhere. Skip.
---
A lot of the content in the game has fallen to the wayside because it's not BIS/most efficient/best XP. Consequently we constantly push for more updates that **are** BIS/most efficient/best XP. Content is now backseat to numbers, stats, and "efficiency".  And I think that's kind of sad, because if we still didn't know about all the rates and mechanics of the game we'd probably still be doing some of that content regardless of what we got from it.
---
Provided you're not ignoring the nibblers, Several later waves can subject you to having to tank several hits on bad spawns. For instance, on wave 62, at least one ranger hit (max hit 46) as well as two bats (max hit 19), and if the meleer is behind the pillar, it can attack you while you're still being attacked by both ranged and mage. 
---
So instead of just relying on luck for later waves, you can sacrifice 2 inventory spots and actually use strategy to handle these situations.
---
I disagree, I think Mod West has done a good job keeping it in style with OSRS and the Fremennik theme.
---
You keep telling people they don't need this service because you came here at 6 in the morning and for the last time EVERYONE WAS LOGGED OUT WAITING FOR A BIG FIGHT. You will NEVER pvm in these worlds for more than these little bubbles. We've currently had 48 people logged in all day today for the last fucking 22 hours. Where are you now? where are you when nothing's going down and we're all here for the whole day? 
---
If you believe you don't need our service because you pvmed ONE TIME at 6 am for 12 fucking minutes when we were setting something up then good riddance to you. Anyone who actually wants to game here for hours would find it quite impossible without joining us. Which I'm betting is why you haven't come back yet.
---
Please grant me the opportunity to send you back to lumbridge with our whole ops. Come back like you said you would.
---
The cc is not shitty just because you made a whimsical 12 minute video. Your evidence is dog shit. Try to spend an hour here,  or a day here. I hate to break it to you but if you tried that you'd very quickly realize all your hopes and dreams about  us not being there get shattered in seconds. It would literally come cascading down on you as you find out we've got 15 pvmers in each world and 30 pkers waiting for someone to write in the cc that you're a white dot.
---
What's the matter? you keep spouting about how nobody should pay for our service because there's nobody here. Well why don't you put your money where your mouth is and come back? or are you going to wait until it's 5 am and make another 10 minute vid lmfao

---
Nah ironmen are the sweatiest salty boys in the game.
---
I didn’t think you were being rude, I can see where the confusion came from
---
Talk down to others because of their choice of gear that will show them.
---
having PPR about all that money you gave to GDQ?
---
Rune Dragons are great for AFK melee, while bringing in 1m+ gp/hr. You need Dragon Slayer 2 at minimum to fight them though, and full Justiciar with a dragonhunter lance to actually make it afk and efficient.
---
yikes
---
tell us about how transsexuals oppress you constantly on a daily basis please
---
is it possible to add a small amount of cooking exp to things that you dont currently get exp for like cooking seaweed into soda ash for example, it doesnt make much sense to put the effort into something and completing the action for literally no exp, there are several other little things like this throughout the game that yield no exp, and i think it should be changed to at least a small amount of exp
---
&gt;​Funny you should mention the bp -Ive noticed literally no one tries to talk shit at people for bringing a bp to Zuk, despite the fact that its the biggest example of power creep since osrs shipped.
---
Simple explanation being that Justiciar was added after inferno, while bp has existed since before inferno. There's no reference point to inferno existing without bp because the inferno was, to some extent, balanced and designed around the bp. It was not balanced and designed around Justiciar, which significantly trivializes portions of the challenge. I have plenty of issues with blowpipe in its current state and I guarantee you if you ask a number of people who hold the same opinion I do on Justiciar they will share that belief.
---
&gt;You create this mythology of items you claim are too powerful and youre a noob for using them
---
Please, I'm begging you, cite where I called ANYONE a noob or insulted ANYONE. 
---
&gt;and based off of a small circlejerk of really toxic people that have realized they will literally never achieve anything special like Woox or Rendi, and everything you will ever achieve in this game is mirrored by countless thousands.
---
Weren't the "elitists" the ones taking the game too seriously? Relax buddy, you're doing a lot of assuming and projecting.
---
&gt;And instead of taking the hint and playing a game with more actual challenging content, youd rather stratify and gatekeep to pretend youre a special zukflake.
---
I like Runescape and I will continue playing it.
---
Try upping your offer
---
I figured you didn't have experience from your comment, but no, you're incorrect. Talented streamers still die from time to time from bad spawns at later waves. Every guide mentions this possibility. 
---
In the future, I'd recommend having at least some knowledge about content like this before commenting, as you're objectively wrong and just spreading misinformation.
---
I'm on the PP Grind(xd) right now.
---
It's horrible. Literally useless skill
---
Luckily for you silver bracelets are better than bgloves in almost all slayer scenarios now
---
2007 scape will never be better than 2009-2011. You can argue until your black and blue in the face. The game died after eoc
---
The criticism was to take your head out of your ass rather than the design of the helmet
---
Don't think that was a dig at transgenders, more of a dig at how gdq has acted in recent years
---
You dont get that lucky for 8 months. At that scale luck balances out. Im 19m farming xp. If you’re still doing magics and dragon fruits you’re either wasting money or still leveling. If you’re just going for pet cut the magic trees as they’re not worth the cost compared to rate, do inexpensive/low level fruit trees as all fruit trees have the same pet rate. 
---
As for hespori seeds, you need to be doing contracts consistently if you want them. You can easily pull 2-3 seeds a day if you do them on time. Herb runs can also add a seed or two per day. You’re doing the least work possible for seeds from what you’ve said.
---
You're welcome ;)
---
Holy shit this sub lacks reading comprehension. If you want to use an inferior setup by all means do so. I do not give a fuck how you do something but if you say that it’s a better option when pound for pound it’s worse you’re going to get called out on your bullshit. News flash some shit is actually better than other methods. It just comes down to the player but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s still a better option.
---
Not 100% of the time you don't
---
Pvp is already dominated by range. The guys with scimitars are getting merked
---
Good point, a lot of people forget about that
---
The game died after they took away free trade and the wildly, you can argue until your black and blue in the face.
---
ill try
---
That freaking face what Joe makes cracked me up...! XD

I mean, it's real for people who have invested way too much self-worth into levels in an old MMO, but hey, you do you I guess

There's nothing racist about wondering why people name their children stupid shit. The fact that a lot of stupid names are given by black parents isn't racist. It's factual. There are a lot of people with dumb fucking names out there. Black, white, Asian, doesn't matter. Black people simple have the majority of them.
---
you mean the cost of 10 seconds it takes to buy it from the ge?
---
So if i'm a racist or an homophobic the only reason people will get mad at me is because i hold a different opinion than them?
---
If you're opinion is hating on someone and talking shit for no justified reason, you truely can't be surprised why people think you are dumb.

Yeah I kinda do silly stuff like that. When I'm picking up items unless it's a whip or something I'll generally offer it back, would rather not make an enemy over something small.

There we go. You're not just doing daily tree runs, you're doing multiple herb runs and a bunch of contracts.
---
I was waiting for you to comment, you will always be my favorite troll.
---
I support Penance master helmet idea, but its design it's just... shit. Stats are fine and good in terms of usage - it's not BiS in any style, but it's multipurpose item for various activities like Chambers of Xeric.
---
In overall I like this, but the design as that is a big no from me.
---
Question for pkers: do you do it for the loot, the challenge against another player, or for the LULs of killing the helpless?  The loot is usually shit (here is the exception), pking pvmers seems to be a very popular thing to do (no challenge), so that leaves me with....
---
are you *genuinely* stupid or just being facetious?
---
Yes, it is a scam.
---
Can the moss giants in the wilderness drop the mossy key at a half the rate (1/75) like the hill giants do to stay more consistent. The moss boss should also always drop an ensouled giant head just like Obor. I asked this around December last year and they said it was a reasonable change but nothing ever came of it.
---
On a side note if this were to go threw I would also suggest some more moss giant spawns maybe east of the ents or east of the mammoths near the wooded areas.
---
But, but... RC bad. I don’t wanna grind more RC :(
---
You do know afk stands for away from keyboard right? Half of these methods arent afk lol

I mean the gear discord has all those sweaty ass strats on it. Of course they’re going to take the elitist attitude towards it all. They’ve got 0 damage GWD guides and all. Not really attainable for the average player, which most people “abusing justiciar” apparently are..? The gear discord is run and maintained by the same people this thread is referring to.
---
Some comments:
---
Runecraft: ZMI is not even close to Zeah, but what makes it more AFK than regular altars is that it is easy to follow other players, giving a few seconds of free time (protip: don't actually follow others, use an essence on them), but you still have to pay attention, especially if you have low defence and HP.
---
Agility: there's a semi-AFK method in the underwater course: stay inside the southwestern air bubbles and only loot the chests that spawn near you. You also have the opportunity to get thieving exp and make some money. The exp is mediocre and I wouldn't do this over regular courses or even barbarian fishing. Bring bolt tips to spend the time inside the bubbles.
---
Thieving: (see the underwater agility method above.) I don't see how ardy knights are AFK; if you are including low-attention, high-input methods then there are some agility obstacles that can be clicked over and over, but they give garbage exp. There's also a semi-AFK method that can be used in the summer garden, but you still have to pay some attention.
---
Mining: for early levels, essence is AFK but it's garbage exp. For higher levels, amethyst is rather AFK, and runite is kind of AFK because of how long it takes to mine, but you have to keep track of worlds with empty rocks. Volcanic ash is slightly AFK, but the exp is garbage. I disagree that only the upper level of the MLM is AFK.
---
Cooking: any range/fire really. If you find yourself not burning many fish, the Mor Ul Rek vent and the Myth's Guild range are better than hosidius.
---
Woodcutting: sulliusceps offer the best exp without tick manipulation and they are somewhat AFK, but not as much as your other methods, not to mention it is a dangerous method.
---
Farming: the closest thing to AFK in the usual sense is composting and seaweed, because of how long it takes to harvest; seaweed is also moderately good money and exp. In my opinion, the best value per time spent with a low cost is mahoganies.
---
Its a joke you prude
---
divine potions are horrendous herblore exp, you get 2 xp per divine potion
---
sulliusceps are a good middle ground for WC exp, there's some movement involved but you can afk pretty hard and you get fossils while doing it which turn into exp lamps
---
for cooking you can do wines which lets you do other things between inventory, it's faster than sharks/etc on the hosidius range but costs money
---
similarly if you consider 14 + 14 bankstanding methods afk then battlestaves should also be mentioned for crafting
---
platebody smithing isn't quite as afk as making darts but it's better exp and is still super afk compared to blast furnace
---
My monthly skill calculator has my name in it
---
Yes which is why i said farm runs and not tree runs. Youre the one that got upset and said i was wrong when you made assumptions. You’re also still wasting money on the dragonfruits if purely for pet and not xp. If going for 200m as well then carry on but otherwise it’s a waste of gp when  apple trees give the same chance.
---
Pattern sucks, but material should be metal since, you know, wood isn't as sturdy as metal and metal also doesn't rot away like wood does - rust yes, but it's much slower process and it depends the metal type.

Quit projecting your greed and spite onto me mate.  I feel nothing but grief for the Amazon.  This grief may come upon you too, when you have to answer your children when they ask you why theyre breathing ash and eating soot.  It would be too late at that point however, as it always is.  Spite is a powerful emotion because you only realize its stupid once its too late.

Yet another toxic post from you all the while you cry about how toxic we are. Imagine getting so triggered by toxicity yet openly calling someone trash simply because they disagree and don't take your side?

LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO you're a lost cause kid. You're legitimately clinically insane. You're a psychopath. You wreak of lack of empathy, narcissism, dunning kreuger syndrome and a complete lack of ability to assess your surroundings and process peer to peer information properly.

not really. it's only 50k per instance to keep from having to hop worlds constantly. maybe not worth if it you're trying to do kbd to make money instead of pet hunt... in which case good luck to you lol
---
Annoy hundreds because a few are complete morons
---
I wish they’d just give more spear and shield love, or more Spartan-ish (is that the right way to describe it?) stuff to the game.

Yup. String jewellery is still like 90k xp/hr at autocast speed too. Dunno about any of the others' autocast speed.

Time to go make 100 red berry pies
---
Hey, today, after about 10 years, I wanted to play runescape. What happens is, I logged in my account, it says it has been \*probably\* stolen and I should recover it. 
---
 After doing this, I need to start all over again, is this normal or should I have got what I had back in the day?
---
Last time I bought redberry pies I think I had to pay around 250 to actually get any. 
---
It's because they are used in a Quest and usually quest items sell for higher than their worth because everyone knows people will pay more for the convenience of getting it quicker so they can do Knights Sword.
---
I have RC, Construction, Agility, Thieving, and Slayer all at level 55. Everything else is 60 or higher.

Mud Runes are okay profit and kinda chill while watching YouTube or something (Castle Wars teleport + balloon travel).

Agility and Thieving are kinda similarly chill, while Construction is expensive, and Slayer is just slow.

Didn't realize how bad the xp was on divine potions, thanks!
---
I trimmed skillcapes are often seen as more of an accomplishment depending on the skill (e.g. untrimmed slayer cape)
---
I got into pking by going rev pking, started about 6 months ago. "Moi world" cc . It's an open cc, we use discord. Hold down 1500s/529/447, slowly taking over 1750s too, we offer paid pvm protection, we hit other worlds too. Then I started playing the LMS beta to learn how to brid better. Pking is addicting af. I've got a few ags' and zgs' smited, an 16m relic, some BP's and maces too. Easily 2-5m and hour without any big smites.
---
Those are for maximal efficiency, and your stats already cuts out that option.
---
Ps: My OSRS knowledge is very outdated so I cannot give you good advises what you should hunt with such stats. But I recommend mentioning your wealth too so what sort of gear you can afford.
---
You seem pretty offended there bucko
---
Well that’s fine as long as you have to have completed the quest to equip.
---
My ironman is at his first birthday party, but it has 10x the time played, oops.
---
More like 20 minutes after.
---
Really? I never saw any complaints about the sulphur lizards.
---
I was around during the release of runespan and i remember both, it took ages and ages for slow and tedious exp with no profit, or no exp for mediocre profit. It was basically a skill that only botters leveled to 92 for double nats and real legitimate players didn't train or use for any other real circumstances other than the rare human double natter lvl 3 skiller and spirit ghrakks. Runespan immediately took it from the skill everyone hated into a firemaking bonfire v2, but a lot of people ended up grouping up at runespan by the end to go hunting and other altars like the air altars actually became quite active again with high levels making armadyl runes as well which were one of the best spells in the game at the time.
---
Because it's patronizing at its core; which is a step away from elitism.
---
no thanks I don't want orgesses to be buffed even more tyvm
---
They should make an archer npc that shoots from long range so even the level 3 skillers perish 😡😡😡😡😤😤😤😈😈😈👺👺👹👹👹
---
Does this include all the leveling and preparation beforehand, or just starting with a stock, standard set of stats and gear specifically for the inferno?
---
Poll adding Nintendo Switch to Runescape!
---
91
---
Eh. I took a 3 month ish break too.
---
I'm really hoping the quest reqs are raised. This is laughable reqs for a new BIS helmet with double the strength bonus of a nezzy, better than the serp helm by 1 which costs 3m and about 100k~ an hour to use.
---
That's true man, bigger battles to fight
---
Im the one with a problem man, breaks are great!
---
You still look at those helms and think “Vikings” and I feel like this design doesn’t fit. I’m still voting yes and I wouldn’t be mad if this was in the game, this is just my opinion.
---
btw
---
Buy one from the dude just north of zalcano bank
---
Go Blazers
---
Oh okay someone was saying they got fangs and serp in a low kc and they were iron so we all were super happy for them
---
Suggestion : buy membership 😂
---
Still painfully grinding out neglected skills for SOTE.
---
Now, Jagex is going to force me to complete Mountain Daughter. They're monsters I tell you.
---
I mean the whole point of the gear discord is to show the BEST setups for the most kills per hour. It isn't a website like the wiki boss strategy guide or osrsbestinslot which shows multiple gear setups. It's literally meant for the people who want to go hard and get the most kills as fast as possible. So I really don't get why you're complaining about that? It isn't meant for you. It would be like going on the ironman discord and asking why they don't tell you what the best upgrades to buy first from the GE are. That's not what it's there for. 
---
You are completely right about the advice channels though. People aren't the most helpful. It's like those reviews on amazon that say "I dont know. I never bought this. 1 star" People will respond to you without giving you an answer and you wonder why they even responded.
---
Looks like a normal rs main account to me
---
I haven't looked at his profile and don't plan to, but from just reading the comment chain that seemed like a pretty massive jump to make. I just don't much care for people defaulting to it as a random insult without a reason. Seems to be way too common recently.
---
Bunnies ?
---
Stop gate keeping runescape from adults, what the fuck? This game has been around for a long ass time and many who played it all those years ago grew up and had kids. You know once people get kids their interests largely still stay the same right? You can balance playing video games and browsing reddit with having kids and a job in a very healthy way, fuck off
---
Rs3 still sadly makes more than osrs. But id imagine if they didnt introduce the shitty combat system they would be making bank rn with the microtransactions in rs3
---
Downvoted for having an opinion. This sub fucking sucks sometimes.
---
You used brews?? You are literally a Beta Runescape player.
---
I loved soul wars with the boys. Why the hasn't yagex brought that to osrs? It was the most popular minigame they ever made.
---
actually kinda fell for this 2 days ago with maple roots, luckily I tested the waters with 100 instead of 10k like the bit said and when he refused to trade I just sold them back at pretty much no loss, it sucks because these scams prey on the more friendly players
---
If you're telling someone not to try it while we're actively there then that obviously means you were forced to leave because we were there ... you do realize you're riddled with contradictions right?
---
And no, I'm pretty sure we weren't the ones panicking. You teleported. Exactly how does it suck that you have to deal with pkers in the wilderness?
---
Youtube &gt; Runescape classic pking
---
Runescape classic release date;
---
 January 4, 2001.
---
Wilderness was created for pking since 2001.
---
Yeah... sure sucks you have to deal with pkers. Go play a different game lmao.
---
Pking that last week was so much fun
---
And all these things can be found in osrs just about except they are in different forms lol. Like do you not realize they implemented pre eoc, and eoc updates into osrs already?
---
You should add in farming runs and birdhouse runs to your bond sustaining. Good gp/hr for zero effort basically
---
Addy gloves/accumulator flex I see you
---
I think it's more the beauty  mindset / cosmetic appeal , they think being tan or darker will make them look better , ex : fake tanning or tanning beds , atleast that's my understanding.i always thought girls with tan lines looked weird personally , with big white streaks in random places
---
The phase transitions are not \*nearly\* as bad as Cerbs lava pools, idk what OP is smoking to think GG's deal as much as Cerb. They deal like 5-9 damage and have a cast time and Cerbs lava pools do like 10 PER TICK and have insta-cast
---
sick
---
Your old gear and stats are on what is now RS3.
---
This is what the final moments before the world ends must feel like
---
Holy shit why is nobody talking about this? What a stupid way for this item to work.
---
Frame this and post it on your refrigerator. You seem proud
---
Yours looks like shit
---
If Percival dies Imma kill u
---
An update that felt more damaging than even the removal of the wilderness and free trade.
---
&gt;how embarrassing
---
Yep that's your comment chain alright
---
just hold down 1 and spam click the enchant spell i think?
---
It’s not hard, you just kill people who can’t defend themselves like the OP
---
I had no idea OSRS was popular in Lithuania. What worlds do you guys play on?
---
I feel an upgraded version of the previous BiS item should be the new BiS item, yes. Just like how you'd want for an upgraded serp helm to be better than the upgraded Nezzy.
---
I think the best would be to combine the gold trim/ornaments from yours on top of West's.
---
I think the "face* of West's model is a bit too smooth/flat.
---
Despite whether you like it or not PKers, or at least their threat, is an integral part in this game. It's easy to say that they're bored trolls when we individualize the victim, but when we step back to look at their purpose as a whole we see that they are keeping some of the most overpowered content in check while also being unique gameplay and exciting lore to the game's world. 
---
PKers are Runescape's necessary evil and like it or not I'd much rather prefer they be in the game than out of it.
---
I have like 30 tutorial island speed run attempts under my belt. Going to go practice though, it's been over a year. Gl me, nerds 😎. Thnx
---
Obligatory u/spinewielder
---
I'm not gonna say I splashed to 70 mage, but I'm not saying I didn't.
---
How is that possible? I thought you could only have one book at a time.
---
inferno is long as fuck. i think the fastest inferno run is like 53 minutes. don't think anyone has sub 50 yet.
---
Osrs on release varrok "market" was mostly bots selling merch and players meeting by using zybez bid/ask system to match deals
---
Fuckin same! I thought the white dot meant an armor move or something you hopkicked in time, cuz it has those weird looking white sparks:D Understood it the second picture
---
I like things the way they are thank you
---
shit, how do i tag the bro bot...
---
Yep!  I’ve done all quests. Tele to house is outside by default, but that’s technically the “alternate”.
---
I must've missed something? What is EOC and what the heck is happening?
---
25 with scimi and pray and pot
---
While raw dps with addy and maple is higher, scimi has better ko potential into 2h (assuming the other person is eating perfect ticks)
---
Yknow how people complain that new additions don't fit the art style or are trying too hard?
---
This isn't that. This fits the art style perfectly. I love it
---
Why does the drop rate have to be affected by Slayer? Can it just have a consistent rate no matter what? Slayer has enough.
---
Yeah, I agree. People already use Neitz as not to waste GP, so to buff it even more is a godsend.
---
It's bad money, that's why you do lavas, and runes come from pvm and shops
---
yo, look at all them black dragon masks tho thatll make the kbd emote clue a breeze.
---
The brave Spartan guarding Arandar against the Persians.
---
Ephialtes betrayed the Spartans and told the Persians about the Underground Pass through which they could flank the Spartan guarding Tirannwn.
---
Too bad all the Persians only had like 30 Agility, so they all died in the Pass. 
---
Sparta stands to this day.
---
They really should do something, not just at Varrock mines but anywhere that's there's a big problem with them. 
---
I don't see why they can't just put aggressive Muggers, Guards or Mages around which attack  low cmb levels. 
---
Sure the Mage pissed me off when I was trying to fish draynor at low CMB, but not half as much as the bots pissed me off when I got to Karamja. 
---
There's also teams of bots that pick up grain from Draynor, or eggs and feathers in Lumbridge, I'm pretty sure I've seen one for everything at this point.
---
nice that's almost 42.069 seconds
---
Congrats dude! I'm really happy for you and hope you will be taking on the inferno sometime soon :)
---
i enjoy things the way they are but i give ya mad props for putting in the effort to make this, my favorite part was his quotes.
---
how am i being a dick? this speed run would objectively bore people who are used to fast and glitchy speedruns.
---
His voice is also monotone. I am not being a dick because I point that out.
---
Congrats man
---
I took a short break before EoC, and came back either during beta or right after release. I got into a tutorial for it and couldn't figure what the fuck it was telling me to do, there were so many UI changes and new buttons everywhere, I got frustrated and logged out in the middle of the tutorial. Never logged back in until after old-school came out.
---
I miss multi steel Titan pking, wildy wars etc.
---
There’s still bots in members worlds.
---
But he bought imps for those 100%. Likely spent at least 3b on those.
---
he was also going for 200m not 13m
---
1.6M per hour isn't exactly bad money; not too far off Zulrah these days without as much gear investment. And not all runes come from PvM or Shops.
---
D
---
okay but that still doesnt answer my question, how will paying for membership eliminate the bots in f2p worlds, all you’re doing is making it more convenient for yourself.
---
U gay now
---
you literally do nothing to retort to what I say other than insulting me. It's yet again obvious that I go against the grain so I get insulted and downvoted. 
---
How the fuck could I be considered stupid for thinkings an hour and a half of osrs gameplay in gdq, a tournament known for glitchy and really fast speed runs, would be boring. People would be pissed and ResidentSleepering the fuck out. No one is going to be pogchamping because you can get a key mould a step earlier. 
---
Like are you guys being serious or are you following the crowd? No way the majority thinks this would be good.
---
/r/wow is leaking.
---
His point is they were not clear and the phrasing made it sound like they were doing KBD at that moment not traveling to do KBD.
---
Didn't the recent Financials show osrs makes more than Rs3 now? Or am I misunderstanding
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/bVv0pOD.png](https://i.imgur.com/bVv0pOD.png) 
---
Yeah that's right retard. Don't reply because you just got fucking incinerated. No name change so you lied &amp; you can spend the next 10000000000000b in bonds I'll always know who you are thanks to notes plugin.
---
You haven't been back and you're not coming back. You know you got proven wrong and now you're scared to die to us. I'll be waiting for you again just incase you think you can sneak on in the morning. And this time I'll make sure I tb you on the first tick instead of bolting you. Then I'll entangle and have 40 people log in. Looking forward to taking your ether. My bet is if you ever come back you won't try more than twice before giving up.
---
I don’t think you being illiterate is jagex trolling but ok.
---
Imagine having this kind of mindset holy shit lmao
---
I could definitely see that being the truth, alas, EoC seems to be kind of cemented now.
---
-"that is ultimately locked in how fast you can do it?"
---
you literally fucking quoted half my sentence. 
---
People in GDQ hate specific runs because they are bad games to run. 
---
How the fuck can you people hate my opinion this much lmfao
---
I guess
---
Vorkath head is retarded tho
---
That is just blatantly false information. Toxic trident is a minimum requirement in the we do raids discord for chambers of xeric, and it's only upgraded to sanguinesti staff when you can afford a \~750m gp gear set up. Even then a lot of players will delay buying the staff because it's really only a minor DPS upgrade albeit a huge QoL upgrade and is almost 3x as expensive per cast as the toxic trident. For the same reason it is much more commonly used at Zulrah and Kraken. Serp helm is very useful at Vorkath for meleeing off task. It's also very good at chambers but you only really melee Olm, Tekton and Vasa crystals. You spend the huge majority of chambers ranging with a crossbow/BP/Tbow. The fact of the matter is serp helm is already extremely niche. If I had to estimate the amount of scales being used on average in the game it's probably something like 65% BP 25% trident 10% serp helm.
---
Nani??!!
---
You tell em
---
Fremennik kilt
---
you have to consider the magnitude of the effects for these two groups you've separated, although i find it hard to believe theres more people with serious f2p accounts just pvming than people engaging in pvp
---
the difference is in this case the amount it effects the 'majority' is basically none, a bit of powercreep in to a mostly non existent pvm wont change much, but it could potentially disrupt the meta for the 'minority', possibly ruining the whole sub
---
is it worth causing a lot of harm to a minority for a negligible bonus for a majority?
---
Arguably the game had to change drastically to fix the powercreep. Everyone seems to forget just how OP gear was getting before EOC.
---
ok literal teenager
---
this game is almost as old as you bub
---
And even when it isn't BiS, it's often #2 or #3.
---
eoc is the update that changed combat
---
I played the beta and hated it. Started with OSRS but quit for a few years all together. Spent so much time on my maxed range tank only for EoC to ruin it.
---
Im sure he will sit there and listen if you really need someone to talk too.
---
So he doesn't believe in clue boxes?
---
Yeah I'm just generalizing
---
"Don't slut shame people"
---
"Lmao a man is a virgin"
---
I’ve played on and off for years. I never had my own computer as a child so I couldn’t follow all the updates and news. I would go months without playing. But I did try it out and did not care for it.
---
60 or 65 def build won’t ever exist because they can’t use piety. A new helm isn’t enough
---
So they could have updated it a little bit
---
Yeah but why stop at 13M.  
---
Especially if you're doing 1K Master Clues, it wouldn't be weird to think he would do post 99 stuff.
---
John Madden
---
master quest with level 60 requirements...if you want me to come back into the game, how about some actual high tier content.
---
His point is technically right. He was an arse about it yes but on your way to do a thing is not doing a thing. I thought the same thing when I read it at first but as it was obvious what you meant there was no real confusion other than those first few seconds of "but you have already passed the pvp area if you are already at the KBD"
---
nah con and herb are easy once you get used to pressing the right keys or clicks
---
For cooking add 1 tick karabwams
