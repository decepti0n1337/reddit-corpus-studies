Oooohhh, you‚Äôre approaching me!
---
---
---
Wym? Dude's got way more levels than he needs. If I were him I'd bring a poison dagger and a few recoils though...
---
\- Yes 
---

---
\- No 
---
\- No, but set another one up anyway
---
Jeez. Youre a very angry individual and you clearly dont want your mind changed so im not gonna bother trying lol.
---
You believe what you want my dude.
---
Hmm. Idk tbh. Probs just unlucky. Good luck in future though!
---
Average loot 24k - bones and hides that you cant pick up. Youre talking out your arse mate lmao
---
2016 wants its pepe back.
---
#everytime lol
---
‚ÄúContent‚Äù it‚Äôs not really content unless it‚Äôs satisfying. Endless weeks of grinding isn‚Äôt satisfying. Make RuneScape Fun Again.
---
A landfill of trash. Shouldn‚Äôt have allowed it to happen but now comes the grind I suppose ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wasn't it an A4?
---
Not even blue rings.
---
Pieces of paper with a blue ring drawn on it by some overworked banker.
---
Meet me at ardy lever and bring your bank
---
It would just be nice if someone wearing torags and a rune scim actually would benefit from full torags
---
[removed]
---
It doesn't have any advantages over dharok's though, so the only thing that causes it to be used is that it has a lower price because it's less useful.
---
Even if the hammers were a decent weapon, I dont think it would make the set op
---
Rude.
---
You accuse me of cherry picking than bring up dark wizards? As if they are an accurate representation of danger vs combat level?
---
&gt;Mobs die too quickly to kill you?
---
?? A mob with 1 hp that can hit 99 is more dangerous then a mob with 99  that can hit 1.  It's RuneScape, rarely is there a situation where you can't just walk away or teleport from any enemy.
---
How to make the game not fun for other people: Tell them their way of having fun is wrong.
---
So wait how is he taking 2-3 dmg from the jad but not dying? Same goes for the lvl 90 ranged monsters
---
I think starting with quest cape is a good idea, after that you should probably focus on training combat up for raids.
---
If you want, go for it. 
---
I've only gotten a single one in all my time playing, and that was the easy one. I doubt I'll ever bother killing enough Earth Warriors or Jogres or Lesser Demons to get the scroll.

---
It's valid, there is a rather close f2p community. Gameplay is very simplistic. 
---
Membership increases the amount of content by like 20x though, it's a good purchase if the game appeals to you.
---
I thoroughly enjoy f2p, don‚Äôt expect an engaging story but you still get satisfying gear upgrades and crafting opportunities.
---
I‚Äôve twice now logged out at the Grand Exchange and logged in to a room with three colored portals, west of Yanille. What‚Äôs up with that?
---
12 minutes. Lol
---
I aint got much but i will bring what I got
---
The point of the game is that you can choose how to achieve your goals. There's a most efficient route ofc, but no method is wrong.
---
My advice would be, take your time and explore. If you dislike a certain grind then look up guides to make it quicker, but otherwise figure it out yourself.
---
Enough attempts will get it, baskets of straw berries and you will be right üòÅ
---
Thanks for your feedback I'll start now
---
Aaaaaand it's gone
---
I'm gonna put some hours into it and if I feel like it I'll get membership. Thanks for the feedback mate
---
Well it also got super inflated because of the mvp drop and a crystal pick being the best way to get mvp. But it‚Äôs floor is certainly so low because of the points you made
---
All four of the melee sets have a "weak piece" 
---
Guthan legs
---
Verac body
---
Dharok helm
---
Torag weapon
---
Its just how it was designed.
---
Welcome to rs. On bounty patch a guy pretended to be friendly just to skull trick me for ags lol. Most people arent this scummy but is sad that they strill exist here. Rule of thumb make friends with people but never give them any gp. If hes buy limit he can buy ur 75m in stuff, you give nothing, no risk.
---
The result is both correct and expected if you understand the mechanics which were intentionally implemented
---
People would absolutely exploit the shit out of it though, just like bh crates
---
People need to learn that all you need to do is to break the ice to start conversations, of course as an introvert like me that's a difficult challenge.
---
Yeah kinda dumb that their logic is ‚Äúyeah you should be banned but fuck it‚Äù while other people are still permed for doing the same thing
---
Don‚Äôt call them out until you play along and get the free whip and maybe arcane
---
I have only just started playing again 2 weeks ago and had this drop in today. 
---
Always be wary, I am no fool when it comes to this kind of thing, but it is very real looking, especially sent from an email like that. I went straight to my account messages to double check...
---
Always use your account Messages to check for these things, never follow the links and enter your account information.
---
Black dude calls you brotha
---
My bwagga
---
blowpipe with blessed dragonhide of any type, anguish, barrows, etc etc. 
---
2 range pots, 8 super restores 15-16 saras, 1 summer pie (if ur 75-79 agility for faster agility shortcut)
---
So they should stop updating the game because it goes against how you think runescape should be?
---
I have never seen such level of ignorance since the last time I went to have dinner with my strictly religious family.
---
Some would call it bug abusing but to each their own
---
He got cancersyphilaids from the 99 RC grind.
---
Haha upvoted because the thought of sex alone gave me an erection.
---
rcb would be better
---
Tbh it happened at such an age that I think it really impacted how I view people in some ways.  I'm not discouraged, just a little more jaded than I probably would be.
---
When I was trying to get my firecape a couple weeks back, I was on the verge of doing exactly this.
---
Sorry but emojis aren‚Äôt accepted on reddit, especially those, make a credible comment instead
---
Then quit the game.
---
To anyone getting a stroke:
---
This is clearly a joke.
---
Tldr too high to read
---
How is it wholesome to call someone the n word? That‚Äôs implied here.
---
This was amazing
---
Grinding my slayer level on TL. Getting 92 today hopefully.
---
What was your setup
---
bloat gets teleported 2 tiles every tick, because his movements are consistant and not random its possible
---
Bro if this is so good keep it to yourself, fuck ungrateful redditors.  You‚Äôll just make this not viable.
---
Could probably get a couple piece of blessed d'hide from clues too
---
I just had to turn mine back on
---
You actually took the time to type this shit out, as if the real 2007 version of runescape didn‚Äôt suck absolute ass and have next to no content, AND as if a game with no updates can survive and thrive. Please think twice next time.
---
When you buy the account lmaoo
---

If you want your hopes and dreams crushed I suggest giving sire a shot :) 300kc here with absolutely nothing to show for it!! :D
---
Rendi was selling 1 prayer inferno capes. IDK why he gets a pass.
---
Hey man I'm in a discord where people have been friends for years and the other day one of the guys on there decided to just scam everyone for as much as he could, sell it and quit (well over 4 bil in total)
---
Rendi addressed this in the video. The Recoil charge count reset that feeding a Recoil to a Suffering causes is by design, and the ability to feed a noted Recoil to a Suffering is by design, so it's not a bug. He used the interaction of two intended mechanics to achieve a probably-unintended result.
---
I‚Äôve done a couple of those but I have more fun doing solos and panicing when I get flame walled
---
So untrimmed con cape is the rarest, makes sense to me!
---
Piss on
---
too much effort for me lol, plus can kill bosses for same gp pls clues + pet
---
just thought lower lvls might like to try it
---
Rune Hasta la vista
---
Okay so you got to barrows. Now what? Your 2007 server is finished you hit the end game.
---
Weird you got unbanned when you were botting meanwhile some people are still perm muted for saying the most unoffensive shit or wrongfully banned lol
---
Sounds like someone just a little bit jelly
---
I think we should poopoo to space 
---
Look i contributed to space discovery!
---
You forgot the humour tag.... I hope.
---
meh. looks good as is, why change what isnt broken?
---
I can't take your spade without getting closer.

fucking awesome holy shit

Hes talking about logging in with a username instead of an email not his rsn

Looks amazing bro:)

shutup it was 7 years ago

"Don't dish it if you can't take it. "

And don't judge someone while doing the same thing

Telekinetic with RL is the easiest one

!remind me 75 days
---
I‚Äôll take march
---
I'm all for it being a persona, in fact I hope it's a persona.. unfortunately i don't believe it's the case though 
---
What social cues ate involved in me watching someone talk to themselves lmfao
---
Yes. As others said it isn't the same. I played *before* most of the content thats current on OSRS (like 2003 or 4 something) and was confused as to why I couldnt play my 15-16 year old characters but then I did a simple google search and solved it...
---
More of less what clem said, but I do ALL of my farming in the guild. I do Maple/Yew/Magic for wood trees. I pay the basket of oranges for maple protection because it's cheap, but I use ultracompost for Yew and Magic as well as my palm trees (Dragonfruit trees have a much worse gold/XP ratio so I don't use them). If the tree dies, I try the resurrect crops spell, making the chance of losing the tree very slim, thus not worth paying for. I also use amulets of bounty for snape grass, which cost 300-400 gold and save 4k worth of seeds every time they proc, with 10 charges each. Redwood and Celastrus trees are both cheap sources of XP with cheap payments required, so I pay to protect both of them, while also using ultracompost for the Celastrus tree. Spirit trees are great XP while also being cheap to protect. Add in torstols, cactus, and poison ivy (which all get ultracompost) and I make consistent profit with each run.
---
Is anyone else still getting dc‚Äôed on a regular basis? Seems on mobile I get dc‚Äôed every 30 mins.
---
Literally this, I dont think there is a single book in game that you actually have to read (got to flick thru some books for quests but dont have to actually read them). So who cares if you cant use them in pvp worlds at all. 
---
All the  stall lures seem to make use of items that have literally no legitimate use in the game, much less in pvp worlds so just make them unusable on pvp worlds.
---
I wonder what else in his inventory üëÄ
---
Why did you add a stuttering no? That's fuckin weird dude
---
6ix9ine nine dragon meds baby
---
3.5k kc without limbs, vissy, or lump
---
Thos is a great sub
---
yup thats normie mode for u death to the normal game mode!
---
&gt;All I really see is Rendi expressing his disappointment (not even really mad, it looks like) then Settled, of all people, being a dick about it.
---
That's my impression too.
---
Plus if you appealed it before you'll get auto rejected, even if just as much time has now passed as OPs.
---
spread some of those legs my way
---
Piss on you because you‚Äôre the dead naked and I‚Äôm the geared guy who hunted you down for your rock.
---
I hope not üòØ
---
I'm with 2degrees in NZ. It has worked in the past on the same provider but I might be able to test on another network.
---
No idea what I'll do if it's my provider
---
Thanks for the reply
---
I've never sold them to the shop since I haven't got an ironman that needs an onyx so I'm not sure. And obviously its a different amount if you have karamja gloves for better shop prices.
---
actually when i used to do that kinda stuff i used a brute forcer with a common password list and a highscore name leecher with revolving proxies to bypass the 5min cooldown. Leaks from companies are out of your control too, as are other exploits etc...
---
Keep this battle up... helping me make money off clues and sweets
---
I‚Äôll beat my meat yes.
---
You've killed obor 11 times on a p2p account?
---
Do rune dragons no longer drop dragon javelin heads?
---
Bitter? Sure.
---
I just think that its awfully *convenient* how everyone likes to ignore the fact that rendi only started talking about lilsmokey after Settled baited him.
---
But rc and mining are 2 of the slowest skills in the game. But I get your point.
---
it is indeed pretty terrible
---
i think it was woox (as usual)
---
Did this yesterday and it's 5-6k planks an hour with concentration
---
seems like some worlds are still shaky
---
I had a dude try to scam me like that too, asked me a bunch of personal questions and stuff barely 10 minutes after we met. I gave him incorrect answers, so there was no way he could recover my account
---
Who in the generic psych major "I think I'll take the LSAT" bullshitting dropout stoner doctored up this email?
---
No, the assembler is, but I'm far, far away in terms of quests from Vorkath. Technically, the accumulator is also better. But 99 range is great for 50% of Zulrah.
---
Whip and dragon dagger for sure.  A hasta (or lance if you can afford) is a good weapon to have for slayer because it offers a solid crush bonus (for gargoyles, wyverns, etc.) as well as a solid stab bonus (for dragons and other things weak to stab).
---
OK, so what do you care then? Did it adversely affect your game play when Classic servers existed? Did you celebrate when they were taken down?  What do you care if there are a couple of niche servers that allow a small portion of the game to enjoy themselves?
---
It‚Äôs good to have a friend that you can trust completely to play with, it makes end game content way better. Grats on the fire cape
---
Yes, I don't misclick it enough on mobile, I'd love to be able to fat-finger it more often.
---
Bossing question:
---
Current stats are 75 attack, 83 strength, 75 defense, 87 range, 83 mage, 70 prayer. Any boss recommendations? Or am I still a little ways away?
---
God swords aren‚Äôt good for training, just specs. Sara sword‚Äôs different cause it has a higher attack speed, and some people like using it for strength training since whip can‚Äôt effectively train strength.
---
Care to share your method and how much it cost you? Currently at 80 whole training Slayer and not sure if I should stop, level ranged and start bossing.
---
Yeah.
---
Absolute legend Rendi
---
Whip and d+defender is doing to be your primary slayer/training weapon for attack and defense until 99 unless you can afford a rapier 
---
For strength it'll be an abyssal bludgeon or abyssal dagger, or these days most likely you'll just get strength levels from NMZ
---
Why bother with a DWH when the kills are already so quick?
---
My reaction everytime i open the jewelry box on mobile haha
---
um..raids? lol
---
wow, you got a well thought out response that blew you out of the water and can only respond with K?
---
lol
---
I mean it couldnt be hard than how small it is now
---
Gratz on the bofa
---
I got two in 5 kills from fire giants and I had no idea what they were but knew to pick them up.   Never seen one since on thousands of kills
---
NOICE
---
I‚Äôm a mobile only player and this just an over reaction haha, I‚Äôd be so salty if it was actually this small though
---
Nobody else's greentexts are nearly as good. Sadly they've kind of ruined the format for me on 07scape but you've rekindled the love once again. Keep them coming, king.
---
Iirc you could multilog by using two different types of browsers e.g. IE and Firefox. I remember finding a workaround back in the day.
---
Thanks! It's kinda funny, the whole reason I got it is cuz I was asking about afk fishing methods (I work a lot and like to afk things in rs3 mobile, but im maxed and would like to start afking some osrs skills, and was sick of Sand Crabs.)
---
They mentioned the Infernal Eels, but you need a fire cape to access it (I actually thought I needed to sacrifice the fire cape to get in, so luckily I didn't have to do the fight twice)
---
So yeah, 7 hours of constant reminders that I do not know how to PvM, for a fishing method that doesn't require me to ever bank.
---
you seem miserable
---
You can easily see the daily traded volumes.  Insta selling 6K planks should not be a problem.  They have a lot of uses; it's not some niche item like a basket or oranges or some such thing.
---
I played cod with a dude for something like 4 years. 3 of those 4 years we played literally every. single. night. Every single one. We had a lot of good laughs, and met a lot of cool people. He leaves for another country, I say my good-byes and he goes for 6 months back to his homeland. He comes back. Doesn't talk to me. That's weird, we hung out literally every day for 3 years, why wouldn't he want to talk to me? So I join his game in session. I figure ey what the hell, I'm on a team with randoms and he's got a full team, no way I can beat them right? Well I end up beating them. He un-friends me and calls me an annoying person. He then gets most of my friends list, some of them I've played with for close to 10 years at that point to all un-friend me and hate me. 
---
Stop playing cod pretty much after that. Swapped to PC and have some pretty good friends now from it. I think the main takeaway is, friends don't last as long as you might want them to. Gotta just take things in stride. Enjoy this ride while you're here. Don't let it get you down.
---
Thanks for the detail.
---
Drank water from the hose as well.
---
It's not about caring on a personal level. It's about it being sustainable and profitable for Jagex (the company fronting these servers).
---
Isn't windows mouse keys not allowed?
---
Kinda like Annakin
---
I think it already was.  The portion of this game playing twisted leagues is not as big as reddit would have you think.  It's highly unlikely it would ever affect the polls.
---
... bet you have peasent resolution. Try it on a modern smart phone my guy, otherwise ill assume you have toothpicks for fingers.
---
lmao why make it easier just so you dont die? go practice
---
Wtf is this from and why do I know it lol
---
whats bofa
---
I used nightmare zone. Took about a month, but I used a super afk method. With the longbow, I went through about 15 mil from, like, 60 to 99, but given more focus and discipline, I probably could hade shaved off an entire 5 mil by just remembering to use the super ranging potion.
---
BOFA DEEZ NUTS CROSS DEM CHIN BWOY
---
Anyone knows where the "reload" sound comes from? It sounds familiar to me but I can't remember where I heard it before.
---
Ok
---
k
---
Thanks!!
---
Nice
---
Hold up. Which bow? And ammo?
---
That‚Äôs actually kinda affordable and I might just go for it... hm. 
---
Also what was ur NMZ boss setup if you don‚Äôt mind sharing?
---
Shop or if you wanna cheat, JaGeX's new BH update is amazing. Some HC in my cc bought 100k or 1m of them, I forget.
---
what do you mean?
---
No this devalues the accs I bought capes on
---
reducing hp from 300 to 200 isn't going make a 40mil item crash to 5mi.
---
Even if it does, i don't really care.
---
&lt;3 you too bby, meet by varrock yews at midnight?? uwu
---
You're definitely right, it's a horrible analogy.
---
I‚Äôm still trying to figure out if it was a joke...
---
Q
---
No worries I‚Äôll catch ya a msg, could just pvm or something :)
---
If your decently high stats (70s combats) the best master you can use is Nieve it duradel.  Say you get a dagganoths task you can pick between decent money (Kings) or the best possible xp (lighthouse) whereas with konar you may be forced to Melee them in the catacombs 
---
One bad wildy/konar task offsets so much
---
r/SubsIFellFor
---
That‚Äôs because you have no concept of what‚Äôs good for the game.
---
Go do your dust devils and leave these to people who understand why they are the way they are.
---
‚ÄúWrappers everywhere‚Äù lmao
---
Gottem
---
My first comments were more joking, but this other lad made a poor troll attempt so i played along.
---
What do you mean?  This is the perfect example of what this subreddit does every day.
---
Any civilian job involving flying a helicopter typically requires it.
---
That‚Äôs how I read it and then I got lost üòÖ
---
Not as fun tho
---
Okay gotcha. I was just curious cuz I have 80 all melee and 75 range and was wondering if I was close to being able to kill them.
---
Some would argue there are minigames that require teamwork, but in reality... not really. It's just a whole bunch of people doing the same thing simultaneously with absolutely no coordination. 
---
Wintertodlt and Pest Control are pretty good examples. Its not a team effort, it's just playing in parallel. 
---
Other minigames it's actually detrimental to have people, and would be best done single player 100% of the time. (Why the fuck is tithe farm even multiplayer??)
---
Runescape really feels like it's much more of a multiplayer game than it really is... at least until late game content (group PvM, raids, max clan PKing)
---
no
---
Region lock Venezuela
---
ngl i skipped over most of that sentence and completely missed the joke lol
---
I quit RS again a few months ago but that‚Äôs what I did and it was really fun. There‚Äôs a lot of little F2P clans u can link up with and u can PK in the wildy these bots that sell items and bandit camp 
---
If you want a real good time. Make a new character on members. Cannon to 60 range 10hp and enough pray for protect item. And then go DBow the black chin bots and guys in wildy. Me and my buddy did this and we were making like 2m an hour at some points and having a lot of laughs at the same time.
---
Then u can still transition into a 40atk rune 2h on f2p before u go member pk. U can misty quest the whole 40atk with members quest to keep how low as well
---
provide evidence where nerfing hp from 300 to 200 will somehow crash a 40mil item and maybe i'll take your comments more seriously.
---
I was setting up for the third small fingur joke but couldnt find a way to fit it in. Toothpick, paperclip, needle tip, bees dick. That was the order i was going for.l haha.
---
Bis helm?
---
Ranarr herb farming for making extra money while you're using other methods, Barrows is fairly easy to do with your stats and fairly cheap.

What diaries have you done?

Team 31 cape for life&lt;3
---
Get your combat 110 plus and join me, discord = Benny#2484
---
I wouldn't hold that bit against them, they're just trying to make something of a shit situation.  It's not like you or I have anything to do with the success of the American economy giving us endless opportunities of &gt;$1/hr.
---
trade it to me, i'll make it 22m
---
If you make the monster easier the drops will come into the game faster, you are on the wrong path here.
---
Use your brain
---
Lmao yeahhh
---
I think this particular argument is weak because there are all sorts of benefits to a company to producing in bulk, and selling in bulk is literally cheaper or more beneficial to  them, so they pass some of that benefit on to the consumer.  Examples would include:
---
Cheaper packaging - the packaging is often more expensive than the product itself, so increasing the product/packaging ratio (which increasing volume does) decreases cost/product
---
Getting guaranteed money - this is especially relevant to sub models with yearly prices such as rs membership, wow membership, and other such services.  People who are on monthly subs can cancel it freely and save money if they decide to take a break, but if you take a break on the third month of your three month membership, there's no way to recover the money you already spent
---
Offloading spoilage risk to customers - Product spoiling before you sell it sucks, product spoiling after you sell it because the customer bought bulk and didn't use it all is great
---
my skill levels got dropped when i logged into the same account ages ago, i just grinded it out again since jagex support didnt say it was an issue
---
But then cry when they take too long? Wtf
---
I still think this game mode was made for solely for streamers and to make OSRS appealable to people who play Battle Royale games.
---
I wish it was never put into the game and Castle Wars got the attention instead, I tried to find a game the other day and the most that was on each time was like 5. It's sad.
---
Wow so varrock dog is good enough for pets but meiyerditch is trash. Unbelievable jagflex
---
That‚Äôs a photo of a screen, not a screenshot.
---
Charges are stored on the character, not the item itself. If one ring has 39 charges, every ring that account has will functionally also have 39 charges. What Rendi is doing is using charges on the ring until it has 1 or 2 left. He then uses a noted ring on the suffering which a) adds the last few charges of his universal character charge count to the suffering, making his un-noted recoil reset to 4p charges and b) destroys one noted ring.
---
You call people names because they have different opinions, you haven‚Äôt helped in this discussion, you are just stirring the pot for your own enjoyment and I‚Äôm not silly enough to entertain that.
---
Goodnight
---
Do they flick POM or do they just spam pots?
---
they are level 60 slayer monsters.
---
Pre-buff the 200 hp was fine, in between abby demons and dark beasts. 
---
The buff was not justified as the jaw was extremely rare anyway.
---
No it should be smaller
---
probably because most of the premier club benefits are on rs3
---
Byeeeeeeee
---
Like I said the only change I would make is put the at 80+ slayer, but even so I don‚Äôt feel the need to pursue that because in my honest opposition they are fine the way they are. Put the time in and you will be rewarded.
---
Which means about 350.2M profit.
---
I got an offensive language major back in 2008 for calling someone a noob lol
---
feel free to disagree.
---
Also he's releasing monkeys and penguins, can someone tell me what is going on
---
your parents did that too and you didn't complain so i don't think you should here either
---
187 is below drop rate, checks out!
---
It‚Äôs not hard to get into, but does require time.
---
This isn‚Äôt something that you will master over night, nor will you max out in just a few hours. 
---
Having a few months worth of real world cash is a great starting point to get you prepared to be able to just purchase membership with in game currency.
---
Nope, it‚Äôs something you need to earn.
---
What does membership do?
---
Are you challenging me? Let me show you how better I use the my ticks
---
Enjoy the raw hand chad boy
---
Thankyou.
---
The game has 2 formats, free to play and members. 
---
Think of free to play like a trial or demo, you don‚Äôt get access to everything and there isn‚Äôt much to do in comparison to members. 
---
Members opens up I would say 85-90%of the total content that the game has.
---
we should call new boss mechanics power creep so the hivemind of reddit will REE against it instead
---
How much?
---
When your skill training you just want to break even. Making a 1mill profit while skilling is great. Basically made money for getting smithing xp. 
---
Take me for example. I purchased 20,000 Gold Ore for like 5m, and then 20,000 Nature Runes for the same price, and now I'm buying Ruby's by the 5,000 for also about 5m a stack. I then smelt the Gold Ore into Gold Bars, then craft Ruby Bracelets, and then High Alchemy them for a total profit of roughly 60 gp per Ruby Bracelet (raw materials cost: ~1335 gp, High Alchemy: 1395 gp)

It is a fucking slow process. That yields, at best, 300k for every 5,000 Ruby Bracelets. Less if I cave in and use the Blast Furnace to smelt the God Bars instead of the Edgeville furnace. But what I'm getting in return is fast xp rates (300k to 400k per 5,000 Ruby Bracelets in Smithing, Crafting, and Magic).

But for profits you really can't beat good old fashioned monster killing. Slayer especially. Any run-of-the-mill level 3 fresh off Tutorial Island can bot their way into lots of resources and sell it off on the G.E., but you've gotta put in grueling time and effort to get to the points you can kill a Hydra. Crazy how the RS economy works.

OK

You may have lost 75M and a companion, but he lost a Girthy Dad. His loss really.

Depends where you live, but a good guide is $11 a month.

After say 3-4 months of casual play you can be in a comfortable position to never have to pay again.

With time investment that can be sooner.

It's always impressive how this sub seems to be a haven for people like you who can't even seem to function like a normal person.

I mean you're probably autistic though so it's excusable, just remember there's equal opportunity for people like you in the world!

Combat changes ruined it for me. Mtx's are trash, but they changed so much of the general game that it just wasn't the same and it was not fun to me anymore.

A few hours for a quest, *assuming you have the requirements***, but it also gives you more drops to pick up and decreases your trip time. 
---
Mm2 is a grandmaster quest, with decent skill requirements and annoying quest requirements. I'd be surprised if a lot of people have it done on a combat alt account. Doesn't seem worth it for ~11m, in the grand scope of 412m minus supplies
---
Yeah, Ikr where they are. my question is, for example if you get hellhound taks you can go do cerbs, can I get something else and go do drakes ?
---
It‚Äôs an ark alt so they just camp prayer
---
Do you think dfs or defender and Super extended is better?
---
If they have the money and aren‚Äôt doing something too intensive on the main then yes. A lot of people prefer it being slightly more afk than a slight increase in profit
---
Jikton.

have a good day bro :) hope you‚Äôre getting the attention you want on reddit that your parents never gave you
---
No, but who actually enjoys Drakes anyway?
---
Why do you WANT to kill drakes lol

so that's what it takes to play adhd champions like yasuo riven irelia etc?

Why do so many people still use a dramen staff to use fairy rings when a lunar staff works too? 
---
A lot of higher level players do this too, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because the lunar quest wasn‚Äôt completed

My parents gave me lots of attention.

Not sure where everything went wrong.

Hah, I'm actually saving nuggets up for a gem bag so I can go do the quest for the gem mine.

Oh boy, it's another person that doesn't know what socialism means.
---
Rune drags are a popular alt method because the money is solid and it‚Äôs also quite afk. Trips last around 10 minutes and 4 prayer pots cover that nicely with protect from mage and piety on the whole time. No one flicks them because they‚Äôre usually doing other things on their main account at the same time

EoC brings no new source of revenue, and severely tanked an existing form of revenue. that makes zero fucking sense

Hahahhahaha that's funny af lol

I knew about the gem chance on other ores, but not about the gem rock thing. And I've played this game forever D:
---
I mix it in with my nightly calquat tree run. Fairy ring to miscellania, mine a coal, fairy ring to ckr, plant calquat, do a birdhouse run, go to bed. It‚Äôs pretty simple. I‚Äôd just put a couple mil in and leave it alone in terms of adding money. I‚Äôve put probably around 15m or so in and will probably collect it one of these days, but the most profitable items gets you around 130k per day (subtracted from the max 75k it takes out to pay the workers, that‚Äôs a little over 1.5m in profit per month). It‚Äôs definitely not going to make bank, but an extra 1.5m per month isn‚Äôt bad.
---
If you have that much trouble just open the damn keyboard and press "K"
---
Because they felt like with computers getting better and other games gaining traction, they had to change it up. Honestly, i feel like if the game never died and came back strong like it did, i wouldnt be as attatched to it as i am now.  It was really a terrible decision, but i feel like it kindve had some positive effects when we finally got to play the game we remembered so fondly. We were all united through nostalgia, it was awesome.
---
Brilliant
---
Stay away from the guys with helmet next to their name, super toxic

I started my OSRS journey following a guide posted on this sub. Title was something along the lines of "how to maintain a Bond".
---
It'll help you set-up a decent money maker within 2 weeks so you can start using that money to buy bonds.
---
If you want to avoid spending real life money, start training your skills up in Free to Play and then follow such a guide. If you don't mind the 11$ a month, just hop on and enjoy yourself!
---
I'd recommend playing a bit of F2P before paying anyways. Maybe doing all Free quests before you head into the member's worlds?
---
Cool...
---
A bit late, but iirc they got rid of the phone trial for members, which was being abused en masse to create accounts.  That's what increased bond prices.
---
There is nothing "by design" here lmao. In fact I'm pretty sure they mentioned (way back in the good old days) that they reason they made all recoils share the same charge and tied it to your account instead of the ring was so it could always be tradeable.
---
Having the ROS consume remaining charges makes no more sense than having it consume a full 40 and leaving the remaining on your account.
---
Use your head, use the one attached to the account.
---
why u even got d stone scrolls on lvl 3
---
I've been afking rune dragons since this summer and have seen multiple people in OPs gear use a DWH spec a several times per trip. I think you can get 3-4 specs per trip (which equates to half the kills/trip total). This is fairly substantial given the -30% defence if it lands.
---
It's definitely not necessary by any means but since most people are playing on their mains at the same time it's likely not a substantial investment for then since they've already bought justiciar, DHL and torture for that acc.
---
Not really, you basically just do birdhouses while questing, and you want something like 70 range anyways for ds2 so just cannon slayer for itthen just do mm2 as part of the qp reqs for ds2. 
---
You barely even inconvenience yourself if making a rune drag alt.

Why are you booing me? I'm right.

Reminds me when once I had to go outside and forgot to log out and bird flew in and downloaded, installed and set up autoclicker over my cammelot teleport.

Taking a picture of your screen with your phone? That's fine, I guess. But why in the world is it not at least centered on the clue rewards?!

People often use super combat (1) and 3x prayer pots. Keeping PFM, Piety and Preserve for the whole trip.

Dont perm mutes actually only last for about a year?

It literally is. Prayer flicking works by design of game ticks, congrats that was a terrible example for your case

Unlimited prayer via flicking. Not lazy flicking.

You should probably still make a new account considering you started from scratch and if there's 1 doubt you'll be perma'd
---
Xp wise is not really efficient. But who cares, if you enjoy doing them go do them, you will profit and have a good time. Plus, it may seem as a break from te repetitive barrage tasks
---
Don't pay any attention to this guy. It's a troll.
---
This post is implying that the text you recieve in the chatbox is from the lorax himself
---
So in simple terms:
---
* Rings of Recoil all have the same charge as the charge is tied to the account.
---
* Depleting one ring refreshes the charge to its base value of 40.
---
* Adding a noted or otherwise ring of recoil to the ring of suffering adds the current amount of remaining charges to the ring and resets the value on the account.
---
* Bringing 5k noted rings of recoil and a single ring of suffering allows someone to indefinitely reuse the same ring of recoil so long as they can add one of the noted rings into the ring of suffering.
---
Not for low alch
---
Boss tasks should be first unlock IMO. The free few thousand XP you get from killing them is huge at lower levels. Plus more chances at heart
---
I had the exact opposite experience with an old account. Was stupid and botted bone burying because I was lazy and in f2p. Banned the first day (Jagex did well there). Tried to appeal recently because some time had passed, I learned the lesson, and got denied. Glad to hear so many people are getting their old accounts back though. There‚Äôs nothing like having that OG account

u/W-Virginia another WVU fan on osrs?
---
Some context:  
---
This account got perm banned back in 2016 for macroing (no evidence provided) even though I don't even know how to do things like that. Got an email today about the new client and my account's name is now 17movepown supposedly. But logging into the website shows my account still has it's original name. Interestingly enough, when I go on another account and add my original name it exists. When I add 17movepown it also exists but has been renamed from [#71RY53J21]. I've read online that if the username is jibberish like that it means the account has been perm banned. I have also read that Jagex sometimes releases the usernames of banned accounts for other ppl to use. So my question is what happened? My theories:  
---
  
---
After my account got banned, it's username was released and got taken by someone else. Then when Jagex emailed my banned account it assigned a new name to it.  
---
OR  
---
My account got temporarily banned for a different offense, it's username was released and got taken by someone else. Then it got unbanned and renamed to 17movepown by someone else who macroed on it getting it perm banned.  
---
Tbh, I just want my account back or at least be shown the evidence...
---
Yeah, think I was mixing it up with the way he tick ate melee.

I'm pretty sure it was that the skiller option gave you 10hp but they changed slightly the xp needed for 10hp so the same xp transfered over would result in 9hp

Gz man, always a great way to start an account.

I was in the exact same situation! I am glad that you got your account back.

I definetly learnt my lesson to never bot again though

Why don't they just delete one of the ticks and make it 2 ticking smh my head.

It‚Äôs just part of killing them, you have to deal with it

no lol the best part is that he killed jad lvl 9 cmb

i swear, kempq had such great content, then he decided to move in with alphie and it all went to shit.

It‚Äôs cause they‚Äôre bwanachompas

You lost most people in the first paragraph where you immediately come off as shitty. You're in the minority of players that think this way and it's not worth the time or resources for jagex to split their focus to add some servers for you and your 4 'true oldschool' friends to circlejerk at endgame barrows.
---
I guess so, yes
---
Haha, I saw! Made my morning.
---
Well tbf, being max combat could just mean the guy spent most of his time in NMZ before starting to knock out the other skills.
---
uh... how? Blast Furnace is just faster, it doesn't affect xp rates. So it's dealers choice on paying the fee to use or just smithing slower.
---
They didn't though, both his low cb ironmen weren't banned.

I have been unlocked too after 8 years, had the same problem i couldn't get my original username. But after picking an other username i was able to change it back to my original username for some reason. Try it. I had 1 free name change.

Just load them into the ballista like a blow pipe...
---
Creating a script that quests and trains multiple skills while doing it in a random order to reduce getting banned is not as difficult as some might think. Such as creating a module for each task and having the script "run" each module after a certain parameter is met (time played, exp gained, quest requirements met, ect). Implementing a system that is "all-in-one" is pretty easy with the available API's. Once one of these basic methods has be written, you can often reuse it for different scripts.  Rest assured there are multiple very successful all-in-one bots currently running in the game.
---
Can't really see why something like that would be exclusive to mobile yeah.
---
Hahahah
---
When i saw this post i was terrified you were gonna make a unilateral decision- thanks for not.
---
I think it‚Äôs comical to even suggest trophies should be sellable or obtainable later-the accounts people spent hundreds of hours on will get deleted, giving them a unique otherwise unobtainable trophy is the least y‚Äôall could do.
---
The other rewards have cosmetic value outside of the event.  The trophies are trophies- they should mean something.
---
I appreciate the effort in avoiding item discontinuation for random items, but i feel like discontinuing something that just signifies how well you did in an event that won‚Äôt come back (in its exact form anyway) is not something anyone should mind.  
---
Hope the holidays are going well in britbongland

Meh, I‚Äôve realized that 10000 points is like a lot of points.  Putting in that much time for the Quaker suit only for at some point seeing every level 3 in draynor wear it- naw.  It should stay expensive.

Honestly if you can afford it, get a dragon hunter Lance. Took me 400+ of these to get the chewed bones, was dam painful. Mith dragons are the only monster to drop them, yes.

Idk if your case is similar but my phone got a button to turn on and off the wifi regardless of network availability try leaving wifi on and tyrn on data as well. If that doesnt work check if u got any data saving feature enabled.
---
&gt;blast furnace is just faster, it doesn‚Äôt affect xp rates
---
faster xp = less time spent training smithing and more time to do something that‚Äôs more profitable. spending the money to increase your speed is almost always worth it unless you‚Äôre looking at some of the crazy expensive methods. blast furnace gold is worth.
---
making a profit while training isn‚Äôt that important as long as you have some other methods of making money. it just depends on how much you value your time. i don‚Äôt want to tell you how to play if you‚Äôre enjoying what you‚Äôre doing, but it sounds like you‚Äôre trying to do things in a logical/efficient way, and it really isn‚Äôt.
---
This is golden
---
&gt; Firstly if someone earned more points than required. Say, 8000 points. They buy the Slayer helm, banner and teleport and now they have 500 points leftover. We want them to be able to spend those on future leagues.
---
&gt; 
---
I don't think people going for a high amount of points are necessarily doing it for the rewards alone, but also the clout/trophy of getting to Dragon.  
---
Plus now that we know the price of things people can just stop playing when they reach the amount they want, so "wasting" points shouldn't be an issue.
---
&gt;On the other hand there's the person who got to 9,500 points and just barely missed out on getting the slayer helm/blueprints so he's going to save his points until he can get the 500 more from the next league.
---
They should have played more efficiently then, just like how people have to grind for anything else in the game.  
---
Yeah it would suck to fall short, but it's completely up to themselves to earn the points.
---
&gt;We really don't want to have a discontinued tradeable reward system where let's say there are only 5,000 sets of Twisted Horns in the game, they will then have a price that will only go up because some people could get banned, stop playing, or even die with the item and not make it back in time to get it.
---
I totally understand the reasoning behind it, but it just removes a lot of the achievement, could there be any way to show when you earned the reward?
---
https://i.imgur.com/KkJTmFl.png
---
Bonus sketch piccy
---
The trophies should have differences based on the league they were from. Anyone who cares that they can't obtain a trophy with a slightly different appearance needs to get a grip.
---
next time dont sell it lmao
---
The truth is, Jad was rigged from the start
---
if you need i could help you with it in like an hour
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they would make the slayer helm recolor a tradable item. If anything, this decision only deters people from playing Twisted League because instead of playing Twisted League for however many hours it takes, they‚Äôre more likely to just farm Zulrah for gold and then buy it off the GE.
---
That's absolutely fair feedback and when we review all this we will definitely take all of that in to account.
---
Regarding your other point, I don't see us as changing how the league works because we weren't clear in the original post how it would work, which was an oversight on our part. I've spoken to various people who agreed that after reading it the Trophies would be unobtainable and we were only referring to the trade-able rewards and I've seen other people argue that the not being discontinued applies to everything.
---
"In the Twisted Leagues reveal blog we stated that League rewards will not be discontinued. However in the rewards section of the Twisted League release post, we specified that the trophies 'can only be claimed by players who attained the specific rank in the League' "
---
What this blog is trying to do is correct that issue and involve the community with the decision because even as a team we have people on both sides of the debate.
---
Trophies should be league specific (unique), and untradeable.
---
The other rewards being tradeable is a good thing.
---
Overall, the original reward system was well designed. It's good to take feedback into account, but I think you started questioning yourselves a bit too fast just because a couple people would like the system to be a bit different.
---
Thumbs up if you're reading this in 2019
---
MonkaSsssssssss
---
Isn‚Äôt that how you play minecraft?
---
And these ‚Äúpopular‚Äù players you speak of are a few neckbeards kids like you dick ride. It can go both ways really I‚Äôm sure half the people don‚Äôt care and other half frown upon rwt
---
Not if you play less than an hour a day.
---
If you play 23 or more hours a day it‚Äôs pretty easy with insane RNG
---
Trophies need some kind of distinction for when and how they were achieved. If you can't have that then it's not a trophy.
---
That aside, I get the feeling that removing distinctions in the trophy between leagues may also hurt player involvement in the Leagues: "Not sure if I'm going to bother with this League, I already have a Dragon Trophy from last year." Or: "Never doing any other Leagues again now that I have my Dragon Trophy."
---
Personally, I want Leagues to continue and think keeping some kind of record of past accomplishments *in-game* is paramount for the future success of Leagues. This League probably got a big boost due to its novelty but OSRS players in general don't like spending time on something that won't have any staying power. The temporary nature of Leagues already gets a fair amount of jokes and jabs about how one's effort is "wasted". Creating some feeling of permanence is critical to holding player interest. A unique, cosmetic Trophy for each League (or at the very least having it inspectable in a POH, denoting your placements in past League) is one of the least invasive and most acceptable ways to do that.

The problem is the cannon, they only teleport you if you have attacked them, so by using the cannon, they all teleport you. If you kill the ones you have attacked you will no longer be teleported.
---
Slayer is generally fine as long as you dont expect top exp per hour and steer clear of anything that requires focus like chinning tasks or barraging. Probably skip stuff like kraken too...
---
doesn't hydra require 95 slayer? I reckon most people would skip task anyway until they have 95.

Remember to have her enjoy the game. I know you‚Äôre very nostalgic of it, and want her to enjoy it too, but telling her when she‚Äôs making a noob mistake will be the death of her love for the game. She hasn‚Äôt had 15 years of playing the game like we have, and if you move her from the ‚Äúnoob enjoying the game‚Äù straight to ‚Äúmax ehp‚Äù she‚Äôll for sure drop off and not want to play. I made that mistake years ago, as my girlfriend at the time was selling her items from her bank one inventory at a time and I tried correcting her, and then this, and that. After me correcting her too many times it turned from her playing to me playing but her clicking, which is never fun. My now wife loves the game, and even plays Wow with me, because I learned to step back and let them play the game for the first time like I was able to 15+ years ago.
---
I feel completely opposite.
---
I love to see people with rewards that show they've invested time in to the game before others.
---
For example seeing rare mounts in WoW used to be amazing.
---
Fun fact, he went to my rival high school (Jon jay) while I was still living in New York
---
No clue. i'm searching it too.. :D
---
I wouldn't mind a buff if anything. Maybe a tick faster or increase it to 40%, price is dropping and Jagex needs to intervene!
---
The most efficient method is making darts (usually mith or addy) while doing other things. Personally I did mith darts while doing 2 tick teaks to 99 fletching.
---
they do get automatically denied when there are automated systems evaluating their worth. When there are real people however there mgiht be a chance what you say is the truth.
---
Keep them unique and un-tradable. Keeps recognition for the league and the accomplishment for that certain league. 
---
If every league is the same trophies it takes away part of the achievement after every league afterwards.
---
What is this camera angle??
---
yeah but.. its woox. Whenever jax sees his name he trembles, now Rendi showed a strat that it is possible for any lvl 9 to do it.
---
the worst kind of person the shit internet troll

Don't hate a man's hussle
---
Plot twist: you're the owner of these bots and posting this on reddit as a cover up story for when jagex ban you

---
I'm at 21M exp without the agility pet. The average drop rate is 1/26M exp.
---
A big fat NO to making players play different game modes in order to unlock things in the main game.
---
Stuff you get to take into the main game should definitely be tradeable.
---
Untradeable league rewards that can only be used/seen/interacted with in league worlds are ok.
---
Also known as the opportunity cost of doing a particular action
---
He could of but chose not to
---
300 isn't indicative of anything. You need to actually do this for an hour and physically make a 3.3mil profit before you can claim anything. Just doing the math isn't enough.
---
You're right in that something will be the hardest task of the hard tier. But when I was doing my hard diaries, I felt there was a relatively large gap between skill requirements (not only combat but also personal skill) for Zulrah compared to most other tasks in the hard tier.
---
You technically can do Zulrah at a really low level, but this definitely does not apply to people who are new to this boss, that wouldn't be a fair comparison... Don't forget that many people struggle with Zulrah even at 75 ranged/magic.
---
The 100 cb requirement takes a long time to get, that is true, but it is not "difficult". I got my first Zulrah kill after 100 cb anyway, and I'm also quite sure that Zulrah was my last hard task.
---
Seeing as most other difficult bosses are in the elite tier, I think Zulrah should have been too. But as you said, that is just my opinion!
---
Step 1. Make enough for a DHL at vorkath with blowpipe, salve and void.
---
Step 2. Make enough for justiciars with the DHL.
---
Step 3. AFK
---
Step 4. ???
---
Step 5. Profit!

"The black ones are the far more aggressive breed"  - WistleOSRS
---
Starting at rank ones slayer lvl?
---
Instead you get "oh that cool looking helmet is actually worthless because without any achievement to obtain it no one gives a damn anymore"
---
Outside of raids, a lot of people consider zulrah to be one of, if not the most difficult boss in the game. Sounds like an elite task to me. It‚Äôs easy to say it only ‚Äúrequires‚Äù 75 magic/ranged but not everyone can kill it even with those 2 weapons at 75/75.
---
This should be bannable, stealing stuff other players have earned, legitimately or illegitimately you should be ashamed OP.
---
That's exactly what makes things "good" why should someone who starter playing 5 years later have access to limited time stuff.
---
my 30 million slay experience will tell you have many battles staves ive made from drops! im almost 87 crafting now!
---
Horrible because all I want to do is play the game. It‚Äôs almost like their priorities aren‚Äôt straight.
---
This game is nothing but positive, wholesome fun! No toxicity here m8s
---
Wrong.
---
So if I have only 6k points and miss out buying the 10k outfit, the next league I only need to earn 4k points and I can get the outfit?
---
No need to change your mind, the use of /s defeats the purpose of sarcasm.
---
but they are not going to be, and it was stated at the start of twisted league.
---
I love you.
---
I'd love to go with you! Add me, ign is doubletalk. I'm not ballsy enough to go to revs by myself yet, so I'll probably hunt the slayer grounds, chins, bosses, stuff like that. I'm on east coast time. My time on varies dramatically, but add me and we can figure something out!
---
I just take the shield off when casting spells and camp it for range.
---
Sit kid
---
I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it‚Äôs a peach of cake.

Just drop 10m wait for someone to pick it up and see them get permed for the shits n giggles

I originally voted no to trophies in the original reward poll as I noticed this issue in that blog. 
---
I‚Äôm of the opinion that trophies should be unique, so as to incentivise league to league play, although I do think that players should be able to obtain ‚Äòreplica‚Äô trophies after a certain amount of leagues have passed. 
---
Perhaps when league 3 ends, the league shop will offer freebie twisted trophy replicas. 
---
The replicas will be named as so to avoid the actual trophies being devalued. This will allow players to fashionscape with unique dragon trophies right away if they work for them, or after (2) other leagues have passed if they are more casual.
---
I hovered over to read the URL, still got a hearty chuckle from me!
---
487 KC and I got two jars so far..
---
13m in gems from 73 to 80.. not bad, but not afkable.
---
You can kinda do that with Crystal trees, but obviously that's not really comparable.
---
He says all accounts which traded his main. Which makes sense.
---
The rewards should be tradable for good reason, and on top of that unobtainable items have failed every single poll since 2013. The trophies are different though. They aren't really a reward, and they serve no purpose for people who did not place in the League.
---
They're for flexing your personal achievement. If anyone can get them, we'll probably see it kill future League motivation. Why even bother hunting for Dragon rank when I can just play a League casually and for fun, and then just buy a Dragon trophy (as a POH completionist) later on?
---
Damn I forgot about that. Walking past the dueling arena gate and feeling jealous you couldn't see what that part was since you didn't have membership. My computer was so bad it took 10 minutes (literally) to load up, so I'd just read the runescape manual on the website. Fun times
---
His repentance should've been getting banned. That's it. You're telling me he repented by... making more money for himself?
---
dialogue reader spotted lmao

/*/points and laughs with the spacebar gang/*/

@herbyfreak dude I can't even access osrs rn. It just says too many log in attempts. Am I the only one having this problem?
---
I'm pretty burnt out, but I want to skill, and have little reason to. I need artisan badly.
---
An easy set up is blow pipe, serp helm (for learning), salve (ei), and karils.
---
Should of *
---
A little bit of healthy griefing is good for the server, ain't Minecraft without it
---
I think we'll keep the base models of the trophies and change the logos for each League if we go down that route. In which case, replicas wouldn't really work, right? I think this is assuming the whole trophy looks completely different in each league.
---
Dude I never said anything about changing anything. I was just having a discussion before your condescending ass decided to jump in. 
---
I‚Äôm well aware it‚Äôs tradeable and not discontinued, as it will continue to be. Thanks for being a dick though.
---
There are COX bots now
---
That's just a dialect
---
That hurts
---
Just crash them?
---
Hey buddy, I‚Äôm here if you need a shoulder to cry on.
---
Are you able to PM me the RSN? I won‚Äôt share and I ask because someone recently asked me to get them dragon pickaxes too. I have not and I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs the same person..
---
Haha thank you, but you can also check out GE Tracker. It's a website that has a few indexes.
---
Looking at the comments, this seems like a common point of confusion. Maybe the reward currency should be called something else to differentiate it from your league points. League tokens or something.
---
Got my shard at 62kc xd
---
I wish I had members to participate I got all excited then:(
---
#JagexIsOverParty
---
Wouldn't it be cool if you you obtain multiple throphies at different Leagues, they would be stackable tower that you could wield. Would make some nice colour combinations :).
---
Limit for baskets is 10k. In Rs2/Rs3 I collected 10m baskets over the course of like 7 years. Made it to the green stack and then quit the game lol. Their limit is 1k.
---
We have 2 choices, the rewards items are untradeable or the rewards are the same from league to league. Making them tradeable and only obtainable once will recreate rs3 style rares where the price continuously rises as less are available. If you want the rewards to be different every season then you have to give up on the idea of trading them.
---
GAME'S GOLD FARMERS
---
Have you tried just getting a different piece of Guthans, that'd be simpler than Jagex making changes to their spaghetti code to accommodate your stupid ass in keep getting the same drop over and over
---
Could cap it at 100k per exchange or something
---
Maybe not this exact variation as evidenced through [KarmaDecay](http://karmadecay.com/results/u13094951). TinEye and google reverse search also can't find this exact variation. So there's no 'crap' to cut.
---
I only play UIM haha! But this is a fun discussion nevertheless! :D
---
we've got people online here atm, so it might be on your end
---
I think if we did the same league again it would be stale, part of the beauty of it is that players don't know what the metas are.
---
I'm not opposed to doing a Zeah locked Ironman league at some point in the future but if we did I'd want to change up the tasks and relics substantially. We've learned a lot from this league
---
I've noticed the same thing so it's not just you, but I dont think Jagex has addressed it
---
I'll be there
---
&gt; *at level 9! with a box of purple sweets
---
I don't think you can reach level 362880 in runescape yet.
---
Oh boy another person who can‚Äôt accept the fact that 100% of nations who have attempted have failed eventually.
---
gympecks needs to get their act straight.
---
Limit for baskets is 10k is osrs.
---
In Rs2/Rs3 I collected 10m baskets over the course of like 5 years. Made it to the green stack and then quit the game lol. Their limit is the 1k you mentioned.
---
I think you're right - cheers!
---
He is toxic as hell on this sub. Regularly lashes out against people.

The joke was that it‚Äôd be so hard because he‚Äôd have to make a new account each attempt.

Good luck Dor7123

Hunter crossbow great for rag ranging for certain situations

99.99% sure you don't need waterskins in that mine
---
figured it was. feel like the last place I saw my baskets was fist of guthix lobby. lmao. it has been quite some time since I collected them.
---
I was one of the idiots that fell for this sham. Thankfully I had a bank pin so they only took what I had equipped, around 30m or so.
---
this guy is just tryna stop the rest of us from getting our double xp
---
This is pre GE RS my dude
---
Trophies should be unique. Trophy is proof of achievemnt. I dont get why would other player should be able to get them from other sources? Its not any gamebreaking reward. 
---
About other rewards. Make them whatever you want.
---
Even just the intro for that series annoys me, made me unsub.  Just be honest, he's rebuilding his main because he got banned, not just because he wants to try playing runescape properly....
---
Lmao what a sook.
---
Twisted League is the best thing OSRS has done in years. The only issue is they‚Äôre going to once again cater to the vocal minority of sooks who don‚Äôt want to let people have unique rewards, it‚Äôll devalue the game mode and remove all incentive to play it.

I can't tell if you're playing along with the joke super hard or if you're actually the biggest melvin
---
Have unique trophies for every League (differentiated by the logo style on the front) that cannot be obtained if Leagues were to stop.
---
Wow imagine the thing that makes them money directly is something they provide support for.

More like 'People like OP seeing the top meme and figuring out which other shit meme to tack on the bottom to try and ride the repost train'

Naw u gotta get a pro team.. 100% more better

If you are the one to initiate combat with another player (you attack first) then you will receive a PK skull over your head until you die, or 20 minutes after leaving combat. If you are skulled and die then you lose everything you were wearing and carrying.

Could just turn the trophies into medals and introduce a medal case, one spot for each league that's released.
---
Is the man not wielding a defender (or an ely for the FLEX), what a choob

A little bit? Every server needs some 2b2t style griefing.
---
Oh yeah, because nothing ever happens. Some people like unicorns and get excited when they see one in games, this is a very real thing that happens. Dying to it is also possible when you are the noobiest of noobs.

Shareing a game you enjoy with someone you love, also quite possible and very likely. Stop being so cynical you piece of shit.

Imagine caring about the economy in 2019. Just make an Ironman already, best decision I ever made.

I got my double xp and it stacks with all the twisted league relics, man i'm swimming in the xp now everyone should try it out

Ya it's down for me as well

It is for me

Here we go again

I think it's Runelite

Yup, just got kicked off mobile :(

yep it crashed on me too

Same. I was in the middle of bursting in the MM2 tunnels F.

My world (495) also crashed, can't reload the client either. Some people are still connecting and playing on Twitch.

Just stake smart
---
It makes a lot of sense to keep the trophies available, but my personal dilemma (as well as I'm sure many others) is that I played on an alt for TL. I'd love there to be a way to do a one-time transfer to my main of the TL trophy if that's possible, because I only created the alt for this and future leagues. I won't play it otherwise. It would be cool if I could transfer it to my main to store in my POH or something, cause otherwise it will sit on an unused account till the next league, but it's still my achievement.
---
cant log on
---
+1 while I was in the middle of bursting.
---
We should add a skill that won‚Äôt pass polls b/c it‚Äôs not nostalgic enough for at least  25.1% of the community
---
I think trophies should be discontinued and unique to the league. 
---
Even though I personally will not be participating and therefore will miss my chance at a trophy, those who did deserve recognition. I am overall not a fan of discontinued items in RS, but this just makes sense.
---
 I like the idea of making it very small though like an examine option in a trophy case. I am not sure how I feel about the trophies being unique in appearance as that could really feel bad to have cosmetics that you can never get back. An examine option would provide a small nod to their origin but keep the same model so anyone can have the cosmetic value.
---
I believe that trophies shouldn‚Äôt be traceable as it would completely devalue the idea of someone working so hard for 2 months to get a reward which some guy can just go to the Ge and purchase one. To me that just makes no sense. As far as making them different from league to league I think they should be different logos representing each individual league. After the league is complete the trophy would no longer be available. I don‚Äôt see this as a problem because if you truly wanted that dragon cup you would try and get it and being as it would be untradeable it would not create an item that would skyrocket in price because it was no longer available. I see this item more as an achievement cape in game per say it‚Äôs something someone put a lot of time and effort towards receiving. Let me ask you this if you could just buy completion cape of any kind at  the Ge would it not devalue the person who went and worked really hard for it?
---
Second day in a row ive been dc'ed at kree. This game really wants me to loose my items.
---
Bout to take a final in less than 3 hours that I'm totally unprepared for. Open book, open notes though, so I'll learn as I go!

I actually spent a few mins calculating the max gp/h you can get at miscellania. The more often you check, the higher your average favour will be (which means more profit per day), but also more time spent (which reduces the gp/h). The peak happens to be at checking every ~81 days. If you spend 5 minutes gaining favour + collecting resources, it ends up being ~20m/h (but only for those 5 minutes).
---
Damn I hope the servers come up in time friend

Reminder that jagex wants to revert the death mechanics

Yep DC'd. I also had a slight DC about 40 mins prior.

If your prayer is high enough to last a minute you will likely live...

I empathize with the painfulness of the grind but it's well worth it, trust me!

Down for me. I just beat Kruk in MM2 and collected his remains, then got disconnected before I could leave the room.

Hope I'm not gonna lose all my gear :(

It makes a lot of sense to keep the trophies untradeable, but my personal dilemma (as well as I'm sure many others) is that I played on an alt for TL.

As another user pointed out, AGS may be a bit risky for a noob to use. You could get smited or just forget to pray. DDS or AGS, up to you.

Just got DC'd myself. Load runelite but can't connect to update server? playing from Japan. Not sure if location has anything to do with it

Valid. Especially since hydra is the best money in the game outside of raids

Yup, I just got dc'd in w512. I was doing my brutal black dragon task.

I'm playing from Japan too. Disconnected as well but I don't think location has to do with it.

Same. I'm always down to play barb assault
---
Just came back up for me, give it a check
---
How can you say the first one is the best without even 1 other for comparison? They may have all the bugs worked out in a later league with another creative theme. 
---
&gt; Plus jagex is already being lazy on the next leagues, same rewards and task, carry over points, etc. 
---
You can choose to look at it that way. Another way of looking at is that it‚Äôs less time for them to work on a whole new set of rewards each league and more time to work on other aspects of the league.
---
Pretty sure it's a diary req if that counts for something
---
Finished cerb task, 380 kc with no sign of a crystal :( finally got a jar this task so I guess that‚Äôs something. Grinding 400k xp for 95 slayer now
---
Only if the implement my suggestion and bring back aggressive random events. From yesterday:
---
&gt; My suggestion would be to bring them back but since players have gotten  better, make them use all 3 forms of combat + ability to TB + heal and  if you die, they have the ability to loot your items aka you'd lose it  forever.
---
one sold gold and one promoted an rwt gambling site to hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

why is no one talking about this very thing that was posted yesterday and the day before????

I agree, I think his 'playing runescape properly' series is one of the most boring series being made atm, and he lost all support from me after the RWT stuff.

That said, I don't think all the jokes about physical harm coming to him are acceptable at all. This is a joke about him killing himself of the frontpage and I even just saw a comment where somebody was wishing sexual violence on him.

Obviously that is a troll account, but I think its clear that this has breached into the realm of cyberbullying and it is more than "jokes and memes" in many cases.

I like to do Slayer boss tasks for variety but in terms of xp efficiency it's not good

*After the laughing finally ends, tears of joy are wiped off and breathing has calmed down, the gang cluelessly stands there staring at each other for a while. The feeling of panic and not knowing what to do next starts to creep up their spines. Suddenly they all rush to open up OSRSWiki and RuneHQ like their lives depend on it. After a quick search, the gang releases a collective sigh of relief and continue on with their journeys.*

The one in the forest south of Varrock?

I have country cousins who were taught this way. They had an animal in a cage, a big ol' barrel of water, and a .22 leaning against the barrel for later use. I asked why they didn't pop a .22 in its head. Turns out they simply hadn't considered it.
---
Get out of my swamp.

Make the trophies unique between leagues and not obtainable anywhere else.

It's been pretty irrelevant ever since Rendi got a lvl 18 cape way back

Yeah that unicorn slays

Seriously one of my biggest pet peeves
---
Ok but seriously National Socialism had it's perks
---
Cool.  I know that, hence the "your brave" part of the first comment.
---
If a mod has confirmed it's ok that's different.  Which is great because I can't wait for apps that do avoid the rules externally from the client so I can use/make them too
---
Truth is humans pretty much can't be creative, they can only associate things they already know to make new things. How well you do it is how creative you are.
---
BH store. Hopefully they will change it since they aren't PKing content
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, you see countless people with twisted bow, Bandos etc who bought their success. Yet when you go to world 1 there are still people earning 200k an hour and that‚Äôs being extremely generous. We aren‚Äôt doing anything to fix the f2p problem yet we‚Äôre worried that a few billionaires elysians are going up a few mill, duel arena tax should be raised, why are we buying into this rhetoric. News still claiming varrock is brand new when the reconstruct was what 10 years ago? Sort it out BilFlex
---
diary tasks are so fucked. i stopped bothering trying to make sense of it long ago
---
The only thing this will do is make specific bosses with alchables even less profitable because high bulk of useless items will be dumped and basically 0 gp like you said. This will not fix anything so lets agree to disagree.
---
I'd prefer the cups be unique and unobtainable after each league, they hold no value and are the only proposed reward that prove you did the content, which is the whole point of them.
---
Instead of trophies what if we could make a character banner like in other games. So replace trophys with emblems. Or even keep them as trophys tbh. Cosmetics that just flex account age are common in most games.
---
Im not sure where a banned would go.. maybe an emblem in chat? At the top of trade screens? Etc
---
You‚Äôd think this would be common sense
---
Boys, we‚Äôre gonna have to learn to live with reposts in the future of the internet as our niche little online communities inherently grow along with improved internet access around the world. Not everyone sees every meme. I understand removing it if it‚Äôs made it to hot 2-3 times or something like that, but e.g I‚Äôm here everyday and I‚Äôve never seen this meme. Just food for thought.

(:
---
wtf jared
---
is it possible? yes, it will take a long time but whats a grind to an ironman?
---
BUT First off, you'll have to drop trade to your main to buy the bond &amp; unlock it so you can use it on your ironman to give it membership. And you'll be spending money on bonds when you could be using it on stuff like construction, or purchasing useful items like runes and other consumable supplies. On one hand late game ironman isn't really short of GP, but early ironman there is a lot more buying of stuff than you expect, and it's harder to get gp out of items when you have a limited supply of things like Nature runes, and you're not killing bosses for large numbers of alchables.
---
It would be faster and more efficient to buy membership from Jagex or at least do some afk money making on the main like gargoyles or wyverns to buy bonds.
---
My personal opinion is that all the items should only be obtainable through the twisted league. They are just cosmetics, if they are discontinued so what. The fact that holiday items aren't discontinued is the biggest part of osrs that keeps it from being like it was back in the day. It was always exciting seeing a p hat or trying to make money for one and knowing it was unique and old and had been in the game for so long.
---
It's a very weird mindset that people have regarding discontinued cosmetics. It's not like they're missing out on anything if they don't get it and it gives those items a special level of prestige
---
Premier club costs less than just buying membership *at normal rates*. You're either intentionally trying to misrepresent the situation or clueless on how much membership costs rn.
---
Oh, I'll cancel the free trial then and just stick to the free version, I do not have  ¬£10.99 to spare.
---
Could do just a single League Trophy item that has a context menu upon right clicking it, that let's you transmog it into whatever tier trophy you recieved in a given league, ex you get Rune in TL, but Dragon in league 2, and Iron in league 3, then right clicking to open the menu would show transmog options of Twisted Trophy, League 2 Trophy, and League 3 Trophy. Of they used a Spirit Tree style interface for switching transmogs, then it would be easy to scale for later leagues. However idk if they can dynamically generate a list of leagues you played in, so that leagues you skip don't appear, or if they have to be greyed out.
---
He is trying is best ok?
---
What do you mean ahead? saving points from previous league doesn't put you ahead inside the league at all. It will give you more purchasing power in the main game but you can't cry about that, that is part of participating in each league. The concern is starting the specific league on the same footing.

I can try. I am not exactly sure how to, but I will look it up. Phones are weird because the resolution too, so you need a very vertical picture.

Maybe they don‚Äôt enjoy the content and don‚Äôt want to take the time to learn it? Who cares.

Agreed, those comments take it too far. But I‚Äôm sure when the Fire cape back and forth stops the trolls will die down as well.
---
Ofc he doesbt have a firecape smh
---
I agree with Chemocamel here. I honestly think the trophies for each league be unique in shape. Heck, the untradeable award for each league doesn't have to be a trophy. Like like next league you could give out medals that can be equipped in the neck slot, the one after that could be a cape, the one after that could be a shield etc.
---
A different shaped trophy, that is more representative of the individual league might be better to do going forward. For example let's say you did a League based in Kandarin, the tiered trophies could be gnome trophies. Twisted League was basically a trial run league so it's okay that the trophies look more generic this time around.
---
"May of" isn't a stylistic choice, it's just incorrect.

i can already hear danny phantom's theme

Upvoting as this also worked for me? Potential issue with Mobike carriers allowing connection to osrs services?

Just got my wife to play too. She wanted to know how to get the ‚Äúpizza cape‚Äù (firecape). She also went crazy over the Christmas event, Santa costume, and ‚Äúcolorful crowns‚Äù.

Would the cave be the jagex client?
---
There is also BA Boosts cc, which is only 24m. They have way shorter queues and they have no premium option so no one skips ahead of you.
---
Yes It Is.
---
Same here, was my first time seeing that.
---
Can you explain what it is and how it would help with completing the fight caves?
---
Why are you asking this now? Of course the players that have earned the trophies will want it to be unique and those that haven't earned the trophy they want or haven't participated in TL will want it to not be unique. This is the absolute worst moment you could ask this.

where's the most wilderness loot for f2p players to grab?  specific worlds?  specific areas in the wilderness?  i've found nobody.

Yeah, it's not like people would have a fucking Klan rally over the notion of a gay pride event. Not toxic at all!
---
Yeah, I'm sure it will. I think 99% of the time this is one of the best communities in gaming, but the drama surrounding this firecape race has really tired me out of it tbh.
---
Its not, Look up my stats in the official site or runelite
---
Or Ba Boosts. Shorter queues, no premium so no ones skips ahead of you and one flat fee of 24m. The cheapest cc around
---
We certainly do live in one.
---
It is but it isn't, veterans know what I meme

It's supposedly to help them avoid RWT bans. There was a youtuber who realized that one of their most used method was to put huge stacks of cash and tokens on tables in the 2nd floors of houses in Varrock. He went in with ghostly robes and robbed them blind. Shit was hilarious.
---
I would absoluetly no doubt in my mind sell rs gold for real life cash if I had enough

Most of those videos are easily faked so I'd take that with a grain of tice

Uh. Mythic cape is BIS crush noob

Unfortunately, until I can be logged into my main and my TL characters at the same time with one account I'm just not going to be that excited for Leagues.  It was fun for awhile but once I started hitting the bigger grinds I just felt like I was wasting time for cosmetics that I could have been spending making permanent advances to my account.  I know I could make an alt and buy extra membership then trade any rewards I get as a workaround, but I shouldn't have to double pay just to participate in an event like this without abandoning my main for two months.
---
Just my two gp.
---
Lmfaooo right I can never bring myself to buy it out of pride but god damn if I ever get good at money snake/raids
---
If you think there's no toxicity in OSRS then you should see Zezima clan chat. I'm sure that will change your mind. It's a cesspit of racism and shitposting.
---
Rcing'll do that to ya
---
Ur still mis understanding. 
---
Yes rares werent in the game. The same way ags wasnt in the game. They polled rares as an idea. They were neither continued nor discontinued. They chose to put discontinued in the question. If they would have said continued they would ‚Äúfail‚Äù and we would have got discontinued rares. Itd be like polling ags then asking if the spec should be 50% req and since the spec only got 70% yes, we got a 10% spec requirement. Thats not what people voted for lmao.
---
I have the exact problem! I have over 30 hours on my Ironman too.  I‚Äôm hoping it can be fixed or addressed soon. Want to get the account fully secure.
---
I'm not ranting I can't get any better, I couldn't care less about pvp and lms so I've never even tried. If anything I'm ranting about brainlets like yourself.
---
Letting someone advertise via content creation that you can RWT and only lose your main account is a really bad look for the game and for Jagex.
---
PvP vs PvM?

PvP = Player vs Player

PvM = Player vs Monster

This would only be useful for people doing low-level firecape attempts.

Is that a Corsair K70 RGB RapidFire by some chance?

no purpose beside the master clue step. it doesn't really help with alching, because if you bought this item it will take you more than a lifetime to return the money you paid for it by alching, so it's better to not buy it in the first place

Pet location?
---
I like the idea of having only one spot taken up in the POH. But what if the same spot could be used, just adding a new trophy model each league, showing each new trophy as you obtain them, kind of how the upgrade feature works? Kind of like a single shelf or a cluster of pedestals with a space for each league's trophy.
---
I thought players typically did range only if they were going with 1 combat? Regardless nice job! Lol I remember doing zulrah for the diary and this is back during a nice staking streak so i had ancestral/arcane/sang and BiS range (no tbow just bp) and on my first attempt ever i got the kill with like 25 hp left lmao. I forgot about the jad phase and took a shit load of damage there not having my prayers correct, and i prob had to many switches for my first attempt. But hey it died and I didnt :p
---
But why? Surely you would want to learn Jad for the big slayer xp it gives? Do you just hate learning new things or do you play from satellite internet or something?
---
even astrals is more than 4m an hour...?
---
There was a poll awhile back, asking how much time we wanted them to spend on events, because they took up alot of their time, they could be spending on bigger updates. That's why they're so short now, because the community voted them to be that way.
---
I try not to talk to folks because i don't like it but they're generally pretty nice when i do talk to them
---
He's gonna catch em all cause he's Swampletics.

Can ironman accounts even partake in the event? Seems like a way to by pass the whole no trading thing.

I just did my first zulrah thanks to your post lol

No they can‚Äôt pick up drops, that‚Äôs the joke lol
---
There's like one school in Runescape and the only thing they teach there is matching similar items together, so I don't know why it's so hard to believe that not everyone speaks with perfect grammar.
---
Yeah could be! As soon as I am actually connected it's fine, it's strange
---
I like the idea of higher xp rates, but at the same time need to respect the grind. I feel like certain instances, such as zmi, should not have been nerfed as they were. 
---
I also feel that there should be more lower level pvm content beyond questing. Bosses like the giant mole or sarachnis are a nice start, but something that is designed to be fought using rune armor would be nice. It wouldn't be phenomenal gp or anything, and probably only have 1 unique (or 2 if a pet?), but after the first couple weeks most high lvl accounts would ignore it cause the rewards wouldn't be worth it. I'm thinking something even lower than Obor that could be done with a group (instanced would be baller, but unlikely). With 1 unique that would be solid for low level accounts, but awful for anyone who can afford like, dragon or barrows gear.
---
RWT isn't hard, I used to buy it when I played and sold it back when I quit...
---
They paid be about 70 cents to the dollar, so I mean he has the numbers right.
---
The "inner community" is a few neckbeards on discord and reddit lmao
---
If you ask any of the 'popular' players if they care about rwt they will say fuck no üòÇ
---
And when most of us started playing there weren‚Äôt 1M+ drop parties all the time. It was about doing inefficient moneymaking methods and hoping to get a rune 2h for under 60k. I remember finding out about world 16 air running, it was insane gp/hr.
---
Quality post

Why wouldn't there be audio?

play for 6 hours straight now, don't know what the fuck happened
---
I used to do it with fifa coins it's so easy
---
It seems like only people playing the twisted league is commenting so here is another opinion.
---
The reason why we don‚Äôt have veteran capes in OSRS is because everything should be obtainable within reasonable amount of time. Please don‚Äôt make the trophy discontinued because there might be people who want that item in the future. I hope that some of the old mods step in and stops this or at least poll it.
---
Sad I didn't knew about this. 
---
Ty tho :)

According to the wiki page your right about range only, but I'm not that rich(yet) lol now that I can do zulrah hopefully my RNG kicks in and I can afford all the goodies! I sense zulrah camping in my future now lol thanks again!

ah i see.  so pvp world just means that's the world where people should go if they want pvp?  the entire world is not pvp.  it's like the trade 301 - nothing is different, just where people congregate.

It is trust me, I have done a lot of item grinds already, none of them bothered me at all, I'm very patient and willing to take on whatever grind that I have to. But this one? this one is the definition of waste of time.
---
My number one reccomendation: Never give her items or things to skip progression. Let her use steel until she can afford mith. It maintains the sense of worth and accomplishment.
---
It's not very useful because it would be over leveled by a new player in hours. It takes about 4 hours to do 1-60 ranged for example, at which point you can easily start killing the existing midlevel bosses like Obor and Bryophyta

Exactly, that cc is a godsend for anyone who wants to save time, not have to deal with all the hassle of finding a team who will just disband on wave 9, or simply dislikes playing BA and wants a fast torso on their new account

30m is nothing near extortionate
---
They aren't there to help new mains with a 7m cash stack get their first torso

But apparently suggesting that someone pay 30m for a torso to avoid having to multilog 4 accounts at once because they can't find a team deserves to get downvoted to hell

---
"points earned in any future Leagues may be used to purchase the current rewards from the Twisted League - as well as any other past leagues." -This is a terrible idea. We have no limited rares in this game at all. It would make sense that Twisted League rewards can never be obtained again in future
---
It's like in a MOBA like league of legends, you grind all season for a seasonal skin that can never be obtained anywhere else again.
---
Jagex has proposed that Twisted League rewards, and future season rewards will ALWAYS be obtainable, meaning no novelty, no rare, no limited items at all. ANd the worst part is is that they phrase it in the news post as if we are excited about this.
---
This game lacks limited items. There is no better place to implement it then Twisted League, something everyone can participate in.
---
As another person responded, it's an aversion to new things. I got 99 slayer with addy gloves. It doesn't seem worth the hassle for the measly xp increase.

You‚Äôre right I did that as well! Glories were like 50/60k back then so the dragonstone alone covered the costs of the key, rest was pure profit
---
I disagree entirely, I would not have started this game if I had missed out on items from the past 12 years and could not get them again, make things a challenge to get yes but not limited.
---
ghost boy good
---
Duoing KQ for the d chain which was about 15m or camping abby demons, I think a whip was like 6m back then. Last thing I did for cash was rcing nats (below 91rc)
---
Ok, so most of your tasks youll probably melee with a cannon or just afk and melee
---
How adverse are you to buying a blade of saeldor and keeping up with the charges? Daily crystal tree runs would keep you stocked up on charges for pretty cheap, if you have the levels for that.
---
If you want a blade of saeldor Id buy the following in order:
---
Blade &gt; torture &gt; hydra leather (see below) &gt; prims &gt; tassets &gt; bcp 
---
Only grab hydra leather aka ferro gloves if you have done ds2 (to make them) and arent using the slayer bracelets. Technically it is never efficient to use ferro gloves for slayer, but if youre not being super efficient, then the gloves are great.
---
If you cba keeping up with blade charges, you could sink your whole cash stack in a rapier (not sure if that is a good idea or not, lol, most likely not) or just buy everything above minus the blade and use a whip / abyssal bludgeon (depending on what melee stat you want to train)
---
Id save the rest of my cash to fund consumables (cannonballs, prayer pots, super att/str pots)
---
Let me know if that makes sense. You basically dont range any task and you'd only mage tasks via bursting, which isnt afk.
---
Wait... People read the dialogue?
---
F off no discontinued items through a ironman league thing are you insane
---
On both it probably made a decent amount of profit, nice way of thinking out of the box :)

You're going to not play the game because you missed out on a few cosmetics? game changing

You could buy some lower end slayer gear and go to town on some slayer. A whip, fury, neitz, d boots etc would still leave you with money leftover
---
What if you didn‚Äôt need to be in a CC if you‚Äôre doing a solo? 
---
Even if it‚Äôs just a 5 min timer until you‚Äôre kicked, at least I can go from phone to computer mid-raid.
---
It will (obviously) only be worth it when going to activities that take advantage of its' passive. I also wouldn't buy it unless your bank value is 1.5b or up considering you'd have to sink your entire bank into it otherwise.
---
Oohhh okay tight I could use that
---
Lol shouldve just bought it from GE kek
---
Downvoted for high quality content.

No, that's not the same logic. Character building is fine, this is just wrong. Anti-Santa isn't writing either, it's him talking.
---
Yeah split the community, thats sounds smart. Its not for me. But for new people...
---
Keep a twisted league server open (non-scored). the fast XP and smaller world make the game shorter, but that might be more enjoyable to people who can only play extremely casually.
---
Are you asking for downvotes

Just gonna leave that there.

---
Ok, I get what you mean, thank you for the feedback
---
It is good. You'd get an average of 1 bandos items (including hilt) for (approx) every 95 kills. You've received 16 where one would expect around 9.
---
This is definitely not your original idea...
---
Agreed on broads for sure. That dps is only better for black dragons and higher. I just read " rune arrows + MSB is **a lot** better than rune bolts" and had to comment about that.
---
I'm 100% towards non-discontinued Trophies and am a big fan of how you're approaching the tradable rewards. That's easily one of the most appealing things about OSRS is item availability. That is, if you see someone with something, it's realistically viable that you can obtain it too, albeit probably not immediately, the fact is you *will* be able to get it at some point. A point made in previous comments is that it can be majorly discouraging to new players to find out something they think is really cool can't be obtained anymore. It annoys a lot of people in RS3 who want old holiday items and the like, so best avoid it here while we can. 
---
tl;dr - No discontinued items, make things always available in some way, shape or form.
---
I
---
The G.E. did open up lots of doors! Ruined a big part of the game though imo
---
This is how you get cleaned
---
50mil firemaking xp gives 1500 points. Tithe Farm to 80 gives 1200 points. Those are the big boys. Other than that the gem stall for 250, a bunch of level 80s for 200 points each and a pet for 500 then a few small things here and there.

Not sure why you're being downvoted. That is what that message means.

Don‚Äôt need 22 hp, just take a rock cake as it doesn‚Äôt require any combat stats to get.
---
Lol we've all been there until we could finally afford the Zammy. Before I quit (got hacked and lost everything) I had 2 sets of all the God armors, one for me and one for my bro when he could finally equip it...he never got to that point lol
---
I was doing 1 quest per day which are needed for completing diaries. I was starting with easy/med, its doesnt matter to completing these diaries after quest, but at least when you will do that you wouldnt do these quests again. My advice to do these quests are setting most important features for yourself like ive done yesterday Lunar Diplomacy for Magic Imbue to do lava runes yeah with 65 rc its still pain in the ass, but not as much like used to be.
---
I was referring to Leagues, which already exists. If you want more XP play leagues. If you want an easier, quicker game play something else.
---
Seems like Nomad's pose (from RS3) didn't it?
---
idk why tf this has 78 upvotes but i wish reddit would stop fucking telling me about it
---
I haven‚Äôt done Jad on mobile, but I did do Zulrah on mobile a couple times.
---
As long as you keep focus on Jad and manage your prayers on one hand you should be fine.
---
I think just keeping the prayer interface open is important. Take plenty of supplies so when it comes to Jad, you‚Äôll have plenty to work with.
---
Lol out loud
---
Recently bought a whore on RS for 5k behind Varrock East bank. She was a good time. You just gotta know where to look. Watch out for the guards at the gate nearby though.
---
I think it‚Äôd be a good inspiration for future leagues.
---
That CC tho
---
I mean, what are you gonna do with it?
---
Bought rune shit and power ammys and sold sets for like a 20k upcharge
---
Then bought rune god stuff and made sets and sold for a 50k upcharge
---
That didn't stop the music industry from threatening incredibly expensive lawsuits against YouTube if they didn't implement a better system to deal with copyright infringement on their platform.
---
Jagex probably doesn't have the power or the will to do that obviously, but they're not safe just because they're not currently getting sued over it.
---
You think a game with Soviet penguins, Christmas and Easter events and multiple questlines about race relations had never been political before now?
---
r/wallpaperengine would love this, have you posted it?
---
Wasn‚Äôt able to quick enough as I was on mobile and if I went to report, when I close the duel screen the chat disappears. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to.
---
I really like this format
---
That was my original thought tbh.
---
Give me the D
---
I'd like to see the rewards be available in all the future leagues.
---
Examining items (slayer helm for example) could have a text that says when the reward was added to that item. Like "You really don't want to wear it inside-out. [Reward] obtained from the first Twisted League in Zeah" or something.
---
No, maybe they did it when the shit wasnt at 33%+
---
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
---
Talking shit about people or interest in such ttash makes you look very dumb, consider it
---
Ridiculous man I‚Äôm sorry
---
True.  Probably pretty easy to scam younger kids too
---
I never heared of Jagex support before... What is that?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie I‚Äôve at least seen this at least three times now, but I do understand. It just sucks because he claimed to have made it himself, and that pisses me off the most.
---
If you reduce the melee attack speed by a tick (from 5 to 4) you make the staff BiS for sub 50 attack.  Since it only requires 30 attack, you might create a new type of pures.  That's a cool way to create demand for this item.
---
Imagine caring so much you run to Reddit.

Yeah, it‚Äôs gonna happen. And in the future it‚Äôs gonna happen more. And there‚Äôs really not a way to stop it lol.
---
I dont know how to post mutiple pictures on reddit lol.
---
What is your problem? I see you shit talking on every single post.
---
Love it guys, can you do link from BOTW next???
---
Surely if someone invests more time into the game, they deserve to reap greater rewards? You're not entitled to get the best rewards without putting in the effort just because you have a job. It's okay to have some rewards that you need to put a lot of effort into getting, even if that effort might be hard for some people due to life circumstances. 
---
(Also, you can 100% still get dragon tier while having a job as long as you're efficient with the hours that you do get to play and plan an efficient route points-wise.)
---
Also kinda sad that the tier 1 set looks better than the tier 3 imo.
---
Didn't think I needed to specify that I'm talking about tradables considering the trophies are not tradeable. But just for you, I'm talking about the tradeable cosmetics.
---
Gonna catch em all cuz he‚Äôs Danny Swampman!
---
You could do some sort of humanoid standing up. I can picture a barrows brother or a knight or something with flames in the background that flicker or his cape blowing in the wind.
---
technically (of you do the math, at least) you can actually complete the fight caves theoretically one level lower than 9 even
---
This is a low tier scammer. Anyone who falls for this likely doesn't have that much on their account anyway.
---
It‚Äôs got a great high alch value
---
Coming from the person who has negative karma for antagonizing the trans community on reddit, you can just leave, friend.
---
That is 100% Pan1c 07 in his last vid
---
You just got problems weirdo
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you. Just explaining for the other dude.
---
However, saying it‚Äôs dumb to immediately sell ur day 1 rare isn‚Äôt really logically. New items are historically their most expensive on day 1 release.
---

Well, tier 3 has the cane :) One can own both and wear tier 1 with the cane.
---
cause its a literal reskin and people would complain and call it lazy

I would if I was any good, I suck at zulrah
---
Yo this is so good you guys
---
Keep only the trophies unique, I started playing TL with the assumption that the 1% trophy would be unique and has been my only motivation. I honestly had no idea you were even planning for it to not be unique and that‚Äôs just a bad idea. If anything now to satisfy both sides make a unique 2nd untradable trophy (or any other decoration) that you get in addition to the others. Otherwise it‚Äôs devaluing and there‚Äôs no real reason to play leagues, in my opinion, because the untradable rewards are the only reason I have motivation to play. If people can just get the same thing by playing the next one then who cares about your achievement, you could have got it in any of the leagues.
---
The point and reason why you're downvoted is because you didn't understand it was a joke. It is a known grammar mistake.
---
OSRS uses so little ram I don‚Äôt think that could be it.
---
Not as good as your stuff!
---
There's no such thing as everyone lived happily ever after. West Ardougne is the Yin to the East's Yang. The balance must be maintained and if you got a problem with that then go pray to Guthix till your knees bleed.

There's two really, really bad haircuts in this picture.

Also, I did the same thing, no need to feel bad, I got lucky that slayermusiq1 mentions that in his guide.

to say it got worst after trump was elected was dumb, this community became toxic the more exposure our generation was to the news.  for a majority they blindly follow either a liberal agenda or a right agenda.  way to many extremes on both sides.

Damn you‚Äôre poor as fuck lol. So sad.
---
Not sure if you're trolling or new here, but this is common knowledge. Jagex has posted plenty of blog posts over the past few years, it looks like they deleted the original blog discussing changes since it received such negative feedback, but here is a [revision](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/protecting-game-integrity-revision?oldschool=1) that they never followed up on because they got such heavy pushback.
---
Or just make the dynamite yourself like intended
---
Plank make on Lunar spellbook.
---
Back when bonds were only 1m, and osrs gold was actually valuable
---
They should just tax the GE at 0.01%. The amount of transactions happening there, even with such a low tax, would far outweigh the gold sink happening at the duel arena.
---
From my point of view, Guthix is evil
---
Bravo Six going dark
---
I believe it might be because he is promising 20% interest on the original lender. He has not given any of his lender's money back because of his immense debt. He is scamming for content and if he does win, he does not pay his people back.
---
I wouldn't complain if the type of person to want free xp weekends got hacked, honestly.
---
Yeah i have seen this a few times now. And just testing it just now I have the same issue. Probably something having to do with the update and hopefully will get fixed later.
---
My slayer is 62 at the moment. That is mostly what I have been doing recently, but I have been plagued with blood veld and blue dragon tasks. I don't have 70 agility so I just bury the bones to avoid the run back.
---
A guy uploaded a video few months ago where he 4 hit Jad with it. Pretty powerful weapon against the right boss.
---
you can either make it, or you can do diary and get free dynamite as well.
---
now this is a cape i can get behind, better then seeing some boring as lvl 80 getting a firecape.
---
Gratz my guy! I‚Äôm working on the same, will have in the next few months! Thanks for keeping me motivated
---
please let me know if you find anything.
---
They can investigate further based on provided evidence
---
need those internet points and need to feel like they have real friends
---
I'm not accusing you of faking a drop, i was just asking why you added the RL ui.
---
This is how I felt when I saw this post.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve watched him before and it‚Äôs sad. He thinks he has a methodology to winning, and thinks that he can find relationships between losses and wins. To him each stake is not independent
---
I‚Äôve learned any of those steps that require a long grind are only worth it for doing that same step in the long run. 
---
So far masters have gotten me to acquire full anglers and prospector, make an anti venom, and other unfavorable tasks. 
---
Every single time I get a shit reward and feel bad I think ‚Äúhey I made gains along the way‚Äù keeps me sane.
---
Ohhh ok, and there is calculator for this stuff right?
---
My high ass was staring at the first frame paused for a minute. After i realised it damn this is fuckin amazing cingrats!
---
No he doesn‚Äôt lol, he sold some rsgp to make ends meet most likely. If he really cared about money then 99% of his content wouldn‚Äôt be on maxing 10 hp ironman now would it? This sub is brainlet material nowadays.
---
Grats on 99 hp
---
Oh fuck yea, i love that category
---
Yeah I would‚Äôve reported him ASAP. You don‚Äôt need that toxicity in your life. Keep enjoying your OSRS adventures or Sand casino addiction lol (:

How would you flip the exp rates when it is based on your damage?

Does ring of pursuit work on herbiboar?

[See this comment from yesterday‚Äôs question thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/eb73ce/have_a_question_about_the_game_or_the_subreddit/fb5kb35/)
---
You‚Äôre making the assumption that colloquial dialect changes can occur, we don‚Äôt talk like we used to in literacy and verbally too. Is Shakespearean the right form? The point is, English is an evolving language. The idea that a character in a game is incapable of having imperfect grammar is pretty ridiculous, intentional or otherwise.
---
Looks badass, awesome pose :)
---
Fuck em
---
Honestly, I see this cape as more of a completion of the game than max cape.
---
Status bars hands down best plug in aside from ground items
---
If you get your defense level to 75, you'll get access to the nezzy facemask and serpentine helm
---
Its both. The only reason it shouldve been polled is because its political. And to reiterate i would have voted yes.
---
Look at spellsey OSRS on YouTube for his afk nmz guide. It involves a remote app allowing you to afk away from the computer.
---
OP was being condescending and elitist, it's fair game to be condescending and elitist in return.
---
The new staff that passed the poll can increase standard spell dps, and the best standard spell can benefit from the tomes damage boost
---
The problem isn't to whether you're right or wrong, the problem is in how simplified that observation is. Everything is influenced by one thing or another. You, me, and the first rock to ever land on Earth are made of the same matter formed as consequence of the big bang. To say "Humans cant create anything new" is true only because matter cannot be created or destroyed. We interact with the world around us by combining matter and seeing the effects of other matter interacting. 
---
So no, humans cant "create something new," but its not due to any sort of psychological limitation. Its an issue of existence.
---
Classic. As you may know, in statistics that is literally called the Gambler's Fallacy.
---
Ive known a few phishers who do this and they Said they make about 500m a day. Often targeting countries like Venezuela/Brazil etc
---
Those bars above your head are disgusting.
---
1 def bro
---
How did you post this if you died, I‚Äôm confused
---
What?
---
Right, just level it up. You can do it with melee, range, or mage. It's great. Makes other things really easy as well.
---
Why would I want def I‚Äôm a pure
---

I‚Äôm a fan

We also need the ability to mount monster heads in pohs

So make something useless like firemaking your level 1

this post is shallow
---
Dude that 70 mining and herbore are putting me off personally, even the agility I'll manage but goddamn
---
I‚Äôm level 30 fire making btw and this is for pking
---
Bis for mage melee or range?
---
Just an FYI sharing your creation date isn't a good idea since it's useful in recovery. There is definitely people on reddit who would try to further social engineer based on that.
---
Why can't I buy a halberd in the grand exchange? I need one for the Holy Grail quest.
---
I said that already I‚Äôm asking for alternatives but thanks anyway
---
apologies if I came off aggressive. Anyways, I would agree with you more if it was audio. But for text, I would lean more towards unless there is an implied dialect, text should be correct. But here, looking at all dialog, there is no such implication.
---
Pink hat is the best for me
---
Oh my days
---
Uninstall OSbuddy
---
Sounds like you should just get 99 def then
---
Extremely! The d spear drop might be worth something tho
---
Said that already read it fully looking for alternatives
---
Hey /u/JagexGambit will you be checking Dragon ranks to disqualify account sharers and bots at the end of TL? 
---
Wouldn't be fair to compete against them just like in DMM tournaments.
---
On trophies I feel that these should stay the same cosmetically between leagues and there should simply be a note on the hi-scores showing your points for each league. Provided leagues are once annually the top tiers will probably require relatively equal blood, sweat, shit and tears to secure.
---
Since they are percent of players based rather than a specific points threshold it won't matter if it's easier or harder to obtain leagues points. If I can easily get 18k points this league and 30k next league then so will other players.
---
Eww! WTF?
---
I tried with my girl but she immedietly realized it was boring... she‚Äôs right it is boring and god damn it I fucking love it

He means you don't have to grind out the reqs for it anymore. For example the master clue step that requires full anglers. Sure you grind 40 hours to get the outfit and ultimately a 100k reward for hours of work, but now next time you get that step you're already prepared
---
no it is just lend me 10bil i swear it'll work this time
---
Any person I‚Äôve ever met who sells game items for cash eventually gets lazy and it becomes a less than minimum wage job for them lol. 
---
Ex colleague from work on rust, friend on rs, previous friend and the dota market place. 
---
Fair enough if you get a big drop at once. But some of them grind 24/7 just to live off it. It‚Äôs kinda sad
---
Thank you
---
Also it's worth pointing out, assuming you are a non-member, Bryophyta's signature item (Bryophyta's Essence) is member locked, even if the boss itself isn't.
---
I wonder what 30k would look like
---
You've very clearly missed the point entirely. We are shaping things that already exist, what is around us. Of course we're using memory because we remember what we can immediately observe. We recollect what object A. is and its relation to object B. in order to COMBINE OR CREATE A REACTION to achieve C. 
---
That is because we, sentient matter, are interacting with other matter. We cannot create anything unique, only combine or recreate portions of what we immediately observe. Once again, this isn't a problem of psychology, this is a problem of existence. 
---
I quite literally cannot be more clear than this, so I won't be continuing this conversation. Make of it what you will.
---
Whatchu spelling in braille there dude? Any blind people here who can read it? Smdh
---
doesn't even know who thehate is
---
I feel so bad for all the streamers and people like you. I wanted my music cape and figured ‚Äúwhy not kill moss giants for the staff‚Äù like 2 days after it came out. Spent a few hours afking in the catacombs and got like 7 keys which turned into me getting essence. 
---
I think i was legit the first iron to have it because back then it was useless. Like, as a main you need to get like 50m magic xp just off alching to have the staff pay for itself (based off current prices yeah but it wasnt much difference when it was a brand new item)
---
I mean I don't like the skill to begin with lol, I want to do the most efficient way possible so was basically looking for some low exp/hr tasks to just block outright
---
Thank you.
---
Reverse the gif and combine the two to make it seemless.  Amazing otherwise :)
---
He said long
---
Commission staking is already against the rules and the person in OP is doing that

depends on how fast you click really, probably have to figure it out yourself

Happy for you man! That's amazing!

What a rookie didnt alch ur un tradable items
---
I see. Thank you
---
Nmz is fairly afk idk why people bot it lol.
---
The dicing bots are so fucking annoying.
---
I would say to just create a checklist of all of the gear upgrades you are looking to get. You'd be surprised how much of a dopamine rush you can get by simply checking a box on a handwritten check list. That way every time you earn money you can be putting it toward better gear. Aim for a t-bow.

Owe a player 100K that‚Äôs your problem

Owe a player 5B that‚Äôs their problem

Why would they do that? They can't pay the money back but what are the money lenders going to do? Nothing they can do about him not repaying.
---
IMO leagues should have instanced shops that keep track per person. What should have been done for ironman modes. You're not wrong OP, this sub is just ignorant and will blame you for bad game design cuz apparently jagex can make no bad decisions.
