yeah too bad you played the cringey and shitty remix
---
I mean did we confirm he sold it or someone stole it and wanted to sell it?
---
Shit, Now I need to go looking for it just to hear the way he said it xD 
---
I‚Äôm now glad you made the typo, just so we could get this
---
Turns out we're using JS and coercion fucked us, we should've used `fuck up === fuck up`
---
You literally just check their account, I don't need to "look through someone's history" 
---
Well... yeah. I tried to summarize every facet of this discussion, and sorry if it came across as ramble-y. And I only concluded it like that because people are so quick to take sides, this is really the only logical conclusion to come to (that I can see!). I know it‚Äôs not the hottest of takes but I think it‚Äôs fair and accurate
---
Revenant cave, cave in the wilderness where you can make a ton of money, and this is his collection log of uniques he‚Äôs gotten there.
---
well I'm so sorry to hear that but unfortunately you are never getting your shit RSN back. Idk who would want the RSN "Tracy" unless they were called Tracy but I'm chofling at how you are called Tracy and you are never going to get your RSN back :) That's what you get for being stupid and getting scammed.

Do you actually use Twitter on the built web browser?  Or do you use the actual app?

It's the season finale and he's learning new editing software so it's delayed.

I like lantadynes for xp and slight profit

Hope you figure out whatever issues you got have a good night

In all fairness that could easily be the hacker typing that shit so if it‚Äôs looked into it just looks like it was sold but probably not likely

They‚Äôve said they are working on it still and it takes a while because other more pressing issues, but they plan on fixing this kind of thing when the other stuff is settled, iirc.
---
turns out I got hijacked and they bought a bunch of bonds üò≠

Neither I just checked to see the new episode when I got to work but I saw it wasnt up so I googled his Twitter to see if anything was up 
---
You gotta remember that for a long time runescape only 'allowed' you to have one account. This was relaxed a little and you were allowed multiple account so long as you didn't log in at the same time or trade (or something like this). 
---
Of course the above weren't really enforced, but that makes the membership structure make a bit more sense. 
---
Multiple Alts: At one point had 8 alts and my main all members at the same time. Paid the membership cost and only really did that during times when I had annual leave or a work schedule that allowed me to play a lot (and in which case I'd AFK money-make on most of them or half and train the rest). 
---
Perhaps if you break down the cost on a per hour played or total enjoyment it would be much easier to justify that $22. Also remembering that if you're playing more than a few hours a week your alt should be able to make some money on the side to either help fund itself or to funnel GP back to your main (essentially to get the best value for money).
---
Because I'm 20 fuckin mil runecraft xp with no pet

gratz sick account ill attend tomorrow. how did you train prayer?

Ah okay. Well fair enough.

yeah, im just saying taking trading out doesnt solve the problem if you can still kill people for loot.
---
It's the nature of reddit karma. Most people you see commenting enjoy getting positive karma. They see other people using words, it reminds them of something; a reference. References are funny, cue laughs, upvote. Follow suit. A cog in the karma mill.
---
Same. Was fine until the update where they said the bug was fixed üòÇ 
---
Surely what is ultimate proof is if they show that her IP was the one that said that chat..
---
But then there's the issue of whether her computer was hacked, had spyware which allowed the attacker to act like her and then plan this crap all out. 
---
The latter option seems faaar to sophisticated for an account name steal tho 
---
Thank you for your kind words and good feedback!
---
I'll try to include that a bit more and see how it goes next week (especially since it can kinda change the context and each Jmod does have their own opinions). 
---
Only thing is like with real life discussions they tend to build and add onto the answer with back-and-forths and it's nearly as if they've all said it.
---
Does pvmers crashing each other count as being toxic
---
Why does this not have more upvotes
---
Change attack styles. Aggressive trains strength, defensive trains defense, controlled gives 1/3 xp in all 3.
---
Did you not go through the mandatory tutorial. If you skimmed it this time go through it and read. Should be more than enough to get you started.
---
Otherwise join the ba world or enter ba clan chats. Google should find you something.

Ah, I see your point. My bad.

I remember when memes got the world out of the Great Depression.
---
That's what I always say, I mean to each his own but god damn, runescape is so grindy already.  Depending on how you define "finishing" the game (like what combination of maxed stats, maxed gear, pets, money, etc. etc.), it already takes untold thousands of hours of grinding just to do it normally.  It's actually pretty incredible to me that alternate game modes that just serve to multiply that several times over are as popular as they are.
---
This would devalue my 99 mining.
---
Charging orbs isn't really worth it
---
Guess the Tv Show, Movie or Game. 
---
Name a character, a location or a plot point. Whoever guesses the thing first wins. You can also go more abstract and give multiple hints.
---
For example Clue: Gordon Ramsey is mean = Kitchen Nightmares.
---
Its for bank space. And especially for ironman mode where you wanto keep as much stuff possible as you may need it in the future. Also when doing farming contracts, you need to grow  a specific tree/plant and its nice having the seed in ur bank ready to go. So its a nice update for every account 
---
Is there a reason not to use malwarebites 
---
Agreed. No idea how this crap got so many upvotes. 
---
IMO should be polled.  I know I'm going to get downvoted for saying this, but I'm not in favor of it.
---
I need the gold, the crafting exp is just a bonus.
---
I don't wanna slay for gp without a glory.
---
It‚Äôs good money and good crafting xp 
---
No system is completely 100% safe. I can recover other peoples accounts pretty easily thru the site. 
---
gross. Clean it up
---
As long as it‚Äôs not degraded at all you can drop it even unnoted.
---
Secure your account and it won't get stolen.
---
yup
---
What I did was make a ton of rings of returning and paid the 5 mil for edgeville spawn.
---
Is void mage better than mystics?
---
Zulrah and the such is a goal I've had, as well as trio'ing gwd 
---
&gt; I have a degree in information/network security

Then you should know that no account is 100% safe.
---

Victim blaming. Nice and classy.

It's slow crafting xp and not good gp since slayer shits out so much gp
---
Mod weath is a fucking  clown 
---
Why should I use this vault exactly? To clear room for my bank?
---
A glory is an _incredibly_ marginal upgrade over a power amulet. Depending on the monster it may even be worse than a strength amulet.
---
Take it from a guy who's made ~10000 battlestaffs from scratch, it is not even close to worth the trouble.
---
I would love that. No explanation, no lore friendly reasoning, just a random escalator.
---
RSN SSStolen
---
I made 4m siting st the GE
---
Because the premier membership or whatever it's called auto-renewed 4 days before I actually ran out of membership, so I'm stuck with this game for 3 more months.
---
H
---
I just buy the battlestaves every day and when I start getting low on cash I go charge a bunch of orbs then alch them all.
---
it's only somewhat passable w/ daily or passive staffs.
---
Zulrah is a goal as well as trio'ing gwd
---
You guys suck lol
---
It's not a terrible method for training but op asked which is efficient. Neither orb is efficient. 
---
that's probably a smart idea xD

---
Lol. Two ppl have black eyes. 1 is black the other is purple. They must be extremely similar because they both have black eyes huh?
---
And your calling me ignorant?! Bahaha
---
He didn‚Äôt ask if it was efficient he asked which method is more efficient
---
I keep getting attacked at lava dragons while trying to get those done but that‚Äôs kinda to be expected. I‚Äôm really hoping to not get them for awhile after this task is done, it‚Äôs taken forever
---
when did the "hide completed quests" button get added?
---
Fire orbs are just as viable. Obelisk is just past the black dragons in the Taverley dungeon, just west of the ladder up to the water obelisk.
---
If you can get a rune pouch - cosmics + water + laws, with staff of air and tome of fire and 27 orbs per run. Tele back to falador, bank, and then run SW, jump wall back over to dungeon entrance, rinse &amp; repeat
---
If no tome of fire, just do water orbs instead.
---
Unless you can mount a glory in your house - airs aren't very efficient without edge teleports.
---
All battlestaves alch for the same price too - so no increased profit doing airs over the other staves.
---
Hope this helps - good luck!
---
(81 agility opens up strange floor shortcut in dungeon too - very very worth considering doing before the grind)
---
(poisonous spiders are fn annoying too so make sure you sip an antipoision before leaving bank, poison tick will interrupt orb charging)
---
Neither 
---
I don't care about the upgrades, the teleports are the main thing I want. I have a solid amount of construction xp banked and decking my house out with portals and a mounted glory will make life easier.
---
I don't want a glory for the stats, I want a glory for the utility. Getting to Edge/Karamja are annoying as an iron,
---

Have you considered buying some skills, like range or construction?
---
Torvesta wasn't banned. He was disqualified from an invitational competition.
---
No because your security code is never saved in a database, and the rest of your card info besides the last 4 digits is secure through encryption.
---
Where do you see that? 
---
I like the sound of that one :)
---
He does become an Olympian, he becomes swampletics
---
Yeah u can mess around with those stats, but without a strong melee, you miss out on some benefits. Whats ur ko weapon? Ballista, dark bow? Hard to trick your opponent with only 2 combat styles 
---
If you watched some youtube videos already, you are already less clueless than many people in the world playing the minigame randomly. The in-game tutorial is a good place to start, and I think that a few of the youtube vids you saw were helpful, but that it'd be better to start with the easier roles (attacker and collector) and then try defender and healer once you've got a grasp on the minigame as a whole.

Everyone understands that it becomes much more common once you factor in people's KC.. the maths themselves no, but that's not what people are talking about. In this thread they're specifically talking about the isolated instance of getting one from graardoor and then immediately one from the first minion, which would be the 1/6million figure someone posted earlier.
---
I can't imagine this being comfortable honestly 
---
eho 4Head you know nothing about his series is efficient right?
---
I‚Äôm finally watching his videos again since he‚Äôs actually doing PVM now, I was worried that post max he was just going to go for ranks. In that case I would‚Äôve happily never watched again. 
---
Wait. That was a real competition??? I thought it was a phishing scam. What the fuck jagex. I thought you're trying to eliminate scams. Not give them ammunition to emulate you.

I wouldn't know, never pk there.

Said a day or two ago that Torvesta was gonna pull a manked and get smuggled into this upcoming tourny as well. I still stand with that.
---
Upgrading your house is something to consider. If you can hit 83 you can boost for max pool, jewelry box, fairy ring and spirit tree plus some others depending on what you like. Super helpful for almost any content. Great for clues, slayer, questing, bossing and various skilling like runecrafting. It took a good chunk of my bank at the time but I never regretted it.

Didn't catch that. RIP in peace I guess. :(

Their account recovery system needs a rework but if people stop making their accounts easily hackable with 3 guess passwords and recovery questions it would go a long way.  I feel like there is a middle ground here everyone is willfully ignoring
---
That's some shitty policing right there. Sorry to hear that. In my view, a criminal's act is what constitutes the crime, not the victim's.
---
Why do non-btws care so much? Is it impossible for me to like a game mode and you to like another and us both be happy? Yes, yes it is. Its almost like people are different and like different thing... who knew??

Honestly, I was just watching to see a HCIM max. After that, no interest anymore. Prime example of his format, I swear episode, what, 50ish? He spent the ENTIRE EPISODE just making a Glory. And EIGHT minute video... making a Glory. :)

Yay. Hopefully the series dies soon.
---
How have you seen that? Can you tell who gilded a post?

---
It would be the exact same speed you can currently do a farm run?? You still have to pull everything out of your bank to do a farm run with teles ect but this way you don‚Äôt have to visit the farming guild every single time to pull seeds out of the vault that was designed because everyone was out of bank space in general because of seeds.
---
Where‚Äôs the trailer park of runescape

Well that‚Äôs what I was addressing earlier. Any psychological issues depend on the person. Whether that be addiction or desensitization mentally to sex. A lot of us can do something addictive, like drinking, without getting drunk. We can also differentiate fiction from reality, like with a movie

I brought this in every single QOL suggestion post and didn't get a single responce. If we even could get 1 overstock buy per year i'd be estatic. But nope, anything that benefits ironman, even if its it's completely reasonable, get downvoted to shit. 
---
Took a while to get here, but they arrived on a rainy day with no Swampletics so it all panned out. 
---
It's ok, after some therapy a little bit of humanity, I was able to recover.
---
Some random bits that may help you friend:
---
Achievement diaries are very rewarding and have plenty of goals that you can work towards.
---
Rock crabs, sand crabs and ammonite crabs are good early melee training monsters, although its recommended to get your combat stats up with slayer as slayer is a very rewarding skill at high levels.
---
Join a CC, if you browse YouTube for tutorials and such content creators will often have clan chats for you to join. (quality of CCs can vary greatly though...I've found smaller clan chats are often friendlier that huge ones) They are great ways to make friends and do group activities with such as PvM.
---
Don't give money or items to random people at the GE (including beggars), instead report all obvious scammers and add people to your ignore list accordingly.
---
Runelite is a great 3rd party client to help optimise your gameplay experience, it has a bunch of very helpful plugins that you can turn on /off and customise to your liking. Make sure if you decide to get it you are downloading it from the correct place, Runelite.net as there are loads of phishing sites that will steal your account if you're not careful.
---
Make sure your account is secure! Bank PIN, 2FA on your OSRS account AND on your email account, a strong unique password everywhere, you get the idea. It really is important to make sure your account is safe down the line. Also don't go giving out details that can recover your account such as where and when exactly it was created, how many hours you have logged online etc.
---
If you are doing something in the most efficient way but aren't enjoying it, it's not efficient. Do what you want to do, don't worry about the most efficient methods if you don't enjoy doing them.
---
Remember that at the end of the day it's a game, it's fine to get annoyed at it from time to time but if it starts to affect you irl take a step back and take some time off. Obviously this affects some people far more than others so might not apply to you at all, but it's good knowledge so I'll mention it here anyway.
---
Hope these were helpful : )

It doesn't use both your wifi and data plan at the same time unless you specifically enable it to do so. Normally if you're in wifi range, it'll disable your data plan.

Yeah only thing you can do is to secure your account to the best of your ability. Set 2fa on a google email and register it to your runescape account.

Your math is wrong. Two independent events are added. Two dependent events are multiplied

Ex:

Independent: P(A&amp;B)=P(A)+P(B)

Dependent: P(A&amp;B)=(P(A)+P(B))-P(A|B)

2 questions about the inferno.

-How many super restores and brews should I be aiming to have by the time I reach the jad waves? In my current attempts I'm being very conservative with them and abusing my sgs, in the my 3 attempts thus far I reach to the mid 50 waves having only used 1 each at most, I feel like I might be too paranoid about my supplies, and could be going much faster.
---
-Can the armadyle crossbow reach Zuk on rapid when standing on the far west/east sides (4 spaces from the edge that is) or do I need to be on long range?

Equivalent exchange lol
---
Imagine losing a name like [this one](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore/compare?user1=0) only 9 other names like it, out of the millions of accounts.
---
&gt; As the account is no longer in the correct location, I have re-secured it for the creator to recover 
---
If account sharing is allowed, then you're being a d**k to this player for no reason.
---
Go ban Torvesta's accounts for not being played in the creator's location. 
---
You can use them while questing, or to restore energy at the bank you don't have a PoH pool.
---
How long ago before it happened had the account been inactive? Was it part of the name release a few years ago?
---
The fact he even thinks of tweeting this truly shows how wholesome a dude Settled is, quality &gt; quantity, always.
---
Yeah, okay good, I didnt wanna hit 85 farm start doing them and lose 60k per seed, so 10-15k is negligible.
---
Tracy is fucking retarded

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Dev‚Äù okay DevThrowaway1320

They should do something to people who lie like this. It really hurts their reputation but reddit should slow down on screaming at Jagex every time something like this happens because 50/50 of the time it‚Äôs some bullshit or some truth.
---
You want a safespot that turns single combat into multi as long as you dont get hit. Its also good that the monsters have a lot of hp so you dont waste many cannonballs on overkill damage.
---
Just keep trying my man. You had the right strat of luring Jad behind the rock. It just takes practice to get the good hits in on the healers while watching Jad's attacks. 
---
yikes all around honestly 
---
&gt;Yeah but then what's the point of using the box if you also have banked seeds?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If the intent is to save bank space, you have to go to the box every time you get more seeds.
---
Bank the seeds until you do a farm run that requires going to the farming guild. You don't HAVE to go to the vault as soon as you get any seeds
---
Turn it to non blurry mode
---
Gang gang? Are you theo von by chance?

Yep, that's fair. I'm the same, though that certainly means that if I ever made a HCIM I'd die somewhere along in the process. It's too easy to make a mistake tbh (I'm not an elite player).
---
&gt; Jagex doesn't care about your account security
---
  
---
They absolutely do, players quitting because of lost accounts is bad for business. Being known as a game with bad security is bad business and PR.
---
&gt; their passwords aren't even case sensitive lmao  
---
This is literally irrelevant. No one is getting hacked via brute forcing and I can guarantee you changing your password from "memes4u" to "mEmEs4u" won't stop people losing their account when they share it.
---
There is evidence that you're lying, but there is no evidence that you're *not* lying. Why do you insist on repeating the same "I'm not lying" comment fucking everywhere. Do you think it will change something? Why do you think that?
---
If you can provide solid evidence that you're NOT lying maybe people would believe you. But all you do is say "I'm not lying", like "wow the word of a random player is greater than all this chat log/IP evidence!"
---
like honestly mind blowing that people as stupid or entitled (can't even tell which) as you exist
---
What do you chat in if you don‚Äôt mind me asking
---
Truth me too
---
Because I'm super depressed and the small achievements I complete daily are distracting to the fact I'm going to flunk out of University. 
---
-I shoot to have at least 5 brews and 4 restores for jad+ you may need more if you‚Äôre using acb and get unlucky on some hits
---
-you can use rapid in the east corner but need to use long range in the west corner 
---
yes i just dont understand them because of the horrible english. i see some mentions of account names and selling bonds but i dont see how its proof beyond reasonable doubt of selling accounts.
---
Man, if I get scammed by PayPal through my own stupidity they still get my money back.  It's not your job to judge the intelligence of the player, but to provide support for a paying customer, especially when it's such a simple thing. 
---
Go to every two weeks if needed. that‚Äôs just more dopamine to build up and unload. 
---
harassing people that actually enjoy the game, unlike you obviously stuck in the endless loop of making new accounts. thinking, "hey this username is funny, maybe ill stick with this one". but u wont u never do and never will accomplish anything with this game.
---
How common is it for people to get the actual difficult big-ticket type items with bonds?  To be honest I can't believe very many people do it, but I don't actually know.  I can pretty easily see a novice player chucking in 8 bucks or whatever for a whip, but when you start getting into like a couple hundred bucks for full bandos and an SGS or some shit it's like... is anybody seriously paying that?  I know most/all mobile games have whales who spend hundreds or thousands of dollars but it tends to be a microscopically small percentage of players, does it not?
---
Yes. This is a business. There are rules, policies, and strategies. CS management cannot take a laissez faire approach and let their teams do whatever the fuck they want. They'll have internal policies and clear rules, i.e. in situation X, we cannot do Y. 
---
Ive made bank doing this. From 80-99 fishing ive made somewhere around 100m :3
---
I don't know if I would call it humor - it's a lot of regurgitated karma farming, and I think this sub is the vocal minority, constantly shitting on Jagex.
---
No matter what Jagex does, this sub finds a way to find issue with it, and it has gotten exponentially worse in the past few months.
---
It's nothing but memes about $11 and customer support/account security mixed with people jerking off to Swampletics.

How does her living in the Philippines explain her choice of poor grammar and weird internet words?

lol wtf whos going to grind 5k kc at a boss lmao i got all my pets at like 100 kc if needed 5k i would have no pets ur legit retarded
---
That is insane dude
---
I just wanted to thank you for getting me my name back, you're a true hero.
---
Literally unplayable

Or change it to something with racial slurs and have it changed by a jmod for free, thus freeing up the name. 
---
RIP name
---
Nah just an autistic Scandinavian of some sort, most likely a Swede
---
Bummer, probs the keylogger option
---
look at their task lists. generally if you just wanna casually afk melee slay konar is fine. duradel offers tons of tasks which have boss variants (which at your level doesn't matter yet)
---
He finally decided to shut up
---
Tracy still dumb 
---
Oh sweet. I guess I was just worried that I wouldn't be ready stat wise until 90s or something. Don't want to take tasks and get stomped or something. 
---
Damn, if that's true, what an absolute shit stain of a human
---
Then why do Mage Training Arena? You don't have to
---
No they won‚Äôt go back to it for updates but odds are they‚Äôre gonna see at least one of the 25 memes about the smack down. 
---
I fucking lovvve itt!
---
It even has the names of the seeds! Pretty neat for herb seeds tbh
---
*pulls out meat scepter*
---
Yo I'm exact same except I have the herb lvl. 
---
Don't be afraid to push against the zeitgeist.
---
It has nothing to do with combat level. Combat level is just a requirement for using higher tier slayer masters.
---
Every slayer master has a list of monsters they can assign with different weight. Chance of getting task of monster A from master B = (weight of monster A in master B's assignments list)/(sum of weights of all monsters on master B's assignments list you have access to (not locked out by slayer level or quest)).
---
Fire giants aren't locked by anything so they can be received as a task as low as 40 cb (if using Vannaka) or even 3 cb (if using Krystilia). If you aren't comfortable with such tasks, you might want to use lower tier slayer master (Turael or Mazchna).
---
Also aside from cancelling your current task for 30 points, you have an option to replace it with a task from Turael if you talk to him while having a slayer task by another master. But in that case you will reset your 'completed tasks' streak (which gives you extra slayer points for every 10/50/etc completed task).
---
comfortably 6 and 6 for an acb cape where you dont make much an effort to avoid dmg from healers on triples,  don't flick the rangers at all, do a slow zuk healers etc.
---
with a bow? 3/3 or 4/4 is fine.
---
&gt;-Can the armadyle crossbow reach Zuk on rapid when standing on the far west/east sides (4 spaces from the edge that is) or do I need to be on long range?
---
yes. you only have to longrange to hit the jad on the west corner with an acb.
---
Mate, did you see the last one of these that blew up?
---
have fun getting gangbanged by 50 people at once and crying about it later
---
Oh I thought they did for the QA
---
Can someone hire this fucking guy?
---
Wealth would've probably known if the account had been hacked from IP logs. I think that chance of someone being hacked in spite of supposedly having bank pin, jagex authenticator and email 2-factor auth (which was claimed in OPs post) is especially low if not impossible. And it there was some chance of that (remember MOD Jed?), I doubt that MOD Wealth would so confidently lay the smackdown so promptly if there was a potential hacking vulnerability especially considering these protection measures were in place.

SGS please

Can one of you guys come up with another Ironman concept for me to watch while I shit at work?
---
This is a great idea 
---
isn't that ehputroya?
---
Mod Acorn,
---
I have one concern regarding this matter. The update to 178.3 did not fix this issue. Not sure if the update details meant it was for this specific issue or not but the issue remains.
---
Can you let me know if a fix is still being looked into for this issue? Thank you very much!
---
Regards
---
Really worth my time, here have an upvote
---
Did not know that.
---
That's the joke
---
I feel you. I‚Äôm working on a collection firelighters at the moment. They‚Äôre dirt cheap though so it‚Äôs not an issue f they drop
---
This is the sword that goes good with it.
---
&gt; it was because he got a big head 
---
when I read on my phone I didn't see the "start" bit and thought he autocorrected "lead" to "head".
---
Boom roasted. 
---
Is this even in OSRS? I've never had that bitch appear.
---
That KC got me feeling really lazy. 
---
This is actually the most piece of shit comment I've seen you post.
---
You KNOW your security is shit and how you can disable you KNOW is shit. 
---
I wish we did have proper security to take advantage of. Unfortunately the DISADVANTAGE of your customer support makes things hard to fix. 
---
11k kc how much have you made roughly if you can even estimate 
---
Make an ironman, they can't trade or use the GE
---
Ohhhhh stab because like, penis

What happened

I don't think RSNs should be being bought or sold in the first place.

/u/JagexKieren hey, while you're at it why not add the N word to the list of blacklisted words..
---
This is why we need 52 drama weeks
---
Thank you!! How did you get that?  I wanna use one on slayer helmet once I get it and then one on my house I think lol
---
Fuck I love this sub 
---
There is no way to save the emotions for jagex, they have no customer service lol.
---
Did you talk to Oziach?
---
2 good items in 60 chests is pretty much on par for barrows.
---
Technically speaking..it is in the users user's hands (depending on the PI you've linked to the account). I'll admit it isnt a realist approach when dealing with accounts that are 10+ years old tho..
---
For new accounts, however, haveibeenpwned can be a proactive tool. 
---
If I made this account and could only play when I was stoned then I‚Äôd have a maxed account in about never bc I‚Äôd get too fucking lit
---
Dual wielding crossbows, jamflex pls
---
You can't very well expect jagex to punish some random player who happened to take your name just because you let your account get stolen and lost your name. I can't even take this post seriously. 
---
1 in 42000 chance of cancer yahooooo

Is he living off the money he makes from YouTube? Or does he get it another way? Seems like a bad decision if the former is his situation

RS3 does this; along with trying to drop items of value, or do mostly anything.

(inb4 nobody wants this feature now)
---
Y‚Äôall a bunch of haters
---
regardless, it cuts into time where he could do something productive instead 
---
Hey. These people either get support or a smackdown and both are equally satisfying.
---
Im not saying im completely innocent, I did say Fuck words, like any other mature person who plays this game. But thats what the in game filter is on for. I don't see it being a reason for a perm mute
---
Probably said something racist. Gf
---
I would buy
---
They would likely have noticed from IP address logs
---
I've seen it suggested before to have your odds of pet increase once you hit the droprate - I'd be okay with something like this but a gauranteed drop at a certain KC for something so coveted just feels anticlimactic. 
---
Proactive in a very limited sense. Change the password on your account occasionally regardless, use a strong password, do not use the same password for any account, and 2fa your accounts whenever possible. Check haveibeenpwned occasionally, but everything else is more important. haveibeenpwned isn't even all-inclusive.
---
And a lot relies on Jagex. The character range for passwords is a joke. And if they have anything open in their network and someone gets in and they have less than optimal security - game over. This is not at all outside the realm of possibility.
---
Drunk comment noted :).
---
Yeah; a small handful of people get affected by that, and now that makes it a valid excuse for any other random person ~~getting phished, selling their name, having a RAT, sharing passwords across breached accounts, not using 2FA on either RS or their associated email, leaving private details in public view on social networks~~ "hacked"
---
The rule was changed to allow swearing, we just can‚Äôt direct it at people;

‚ÄúI fucking hate RC‚Äù is fine.

Reminds me of:
---
A city boy, Kenny, moved to the country and bought a donkey from an old farmer for $100. The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the next day.
---
The next day the farmer drove up and said: ‚ÄúSorry son, but I have some bad news. The donkey died.‚Äù
---
Kenny replied, ‚ÄúWell then, just give me my money back.‚Äù
---
The farmer said, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do that. I went and spent it already.‚Äù
---
Kenny said, ‚ÄúOK, then just unload the donkey.‚Äù
---
The farmer asked, ‚ÄúWhat ya gonna do with him?‚Äù
---
Kenny: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to raffle him off.‚Äù
---
Farmer: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt raffle off a dead donkey!‚Äù
---
Kenny: ‚ÄúSure I can. Watch me. I just won‚Äôt tell anybody he is dead.‚Äù
---
A month later the farmer met up with Kenny and asked, ‚ÄúWhat happened with that dead donkey?‚Äù
---
Kenny: ‚ÄúI raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at $2 a piece and made a profit of $998.00.‚Äù
---
Farmer: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt anyone complain?‚Äù
---
Kenny: ‚ÄúJust the guy who won. So I gave him his $2 back.‚Äù
---
Your lungs have balls 
---
Sometime next week. Then after that they're no longer going to be weekly videos as he's hit the stage where it's going to take longer for him to gain progress on the account.
---
The n word is what triggers this most often. So have fun in mute land you bigot racist. 
---
Alright boys, you can lower your pitchforks. He's clean.
---
~10,328kc, never fuckin killing them again.  went from 84 to 94 range tho so thats...something..lol, gl on the grind, it'll end when you least expect it

I don't think Slayer Familiars really make sense... I mean they could do it, but why would Slayer let you create a companion with an activated effect in this one minigame and not anywhere else?
---
Uly raz amount of peope gettng hack

I'm actually confused because... are we just gonna ignore that the chatlogs show messages in all caps when you can't all caps in rs? Has nobody noticed that?

Im never gonna give you up! Not gonna let you down!

If you buy a bond and change it again it frees the name up immediately
---
&gt;PROFIT OFF OF THEIR GAME USING THEIR SERVICE. 
---
that's... the whole point of the black market. That's what a BLACK MARKET is
---
you seem confused at how the black market works, they regulate themselves pretty well. If this name was scammed it would be added to a blacklist of scammed names and likely would never be able to scam with it again, which already exists because people do it without Jagex's help.
---
&gt;They are preventing black market abuse. 
---
They should be aiming to kill the black market entirely. Why should they care if they abuse each other? It's not their problem, in fact it just creates more problems for them. Preventing black market abuse versus actually helping people that do need help in these kinds of situations? Which would lead to more happier customers? hmmmmm
---
Try the osrswiki money making list 
---
I get what you mean but money arent based on subs, but ads viewed per video. If you have 1m subs and post a couple vids a month you wont make much. If you post every day you will make good money even with a lot less subs (assuming subs correspond roughly to ammount of views which isnt always the case with YouTube).
---
Anyways, runescape isnt really a good place for youtube unless youre pking and content can be uploaded regulary. Mrnosleep has a good system for pvm with his x hours doing a boss. Otherwise streaming is really where the money is in this game.
---
good call, don't wanna get your rsn stolen.

Just keep at it!

Hahah osrs is a grind man tbh, with those stats I doubt you can do pvm to make some good money. You can do pvm but nothing great tbh 
---
Nobody here checks if the binary they get off the site was built from the public source code, and RuneLite doesn't do reproducible builds. And most people don't compile RL from source either. So basically, who knows...

I get where people come from with this kind of stuff. It might just be me, but I find his personality fun to watch. It's not even that he's the most entertaining guy out there, but it simply warms my heart to hear him talk about this game and his progress. Shit, his maxing video almost made my cry. I think he's a great guy

idk man iv never grinded a money maker i just play the game and end up with plenty of gp if you only think about money it gets boring fast

Yes

Attempt to change all your details now including emails and everything, like right now right now, it‚Äôs possible for the dickheads to wait for you to gain wealth again and clap your shit again, get a bank pin and authenticator, and never ever click on fishy links again, jagex will never ask you for your information so don‚Äôt give it out, it‚Äôs possible your acc is already a rip Chief, Gl

Make sure you add an authenticator to your email address as well

I‚Äôm confused how is linking a YouTube channel proof

I bet the twitch chat would keep it interesting. Maybe stream for an hour or so before he logs off for the day? He'd have a couple hours of progress to talk about and could capitalize on people supporting with twitch subscriptions and bits. It seems short streams aren't really that common but why not when there are people willing to watch. He could also stream some of the video editing he does and maybe it'll spark inspiration for some other content creators. It'd be nice to have more *good* series to watch.

Yup, thats how my account got hacked, account got compromised from using same pass/email on another site they just easily removed my authen waited the 7 days for my pin to drop and took it all

Right but someone can Rat you pretty easily with an IP and a few other details. Idk man.

what happened now?

Yeah but ratting seems like a waste of time on low level accounts. Most of them don't have the security and click dumb links. I get what you mean but I for instance as well, never been hacked on OSRS
---
I'm ashamed that I knew what it was before I clicked.
---
Sounds great, doesn't work.
---
glory and rangers from a clue :( rip
---
Nice avas
---
What are you eve talking about? You can recover your account if you don‚Äôt have a bank pin or authenticator. You are a fool to think otherwise. 
---
This man has his account, he just has a different display name. His name was one that might be seen as ‚Äúsought after‚Äù. Also there is a market for people that want to purchase these usernames. This means that rolling back this change could potentially put some random poor sod out of his money he just paid for his new display name, just because this guy didn‚Äôt use an authenticator. This is potentially one of the reasons that they don‚Äôt return lost items. It can be liquidated into real world money. 
---
This isn‚Äôt even the main reason they won‚Äôt give his name back. The main reason is that the account owner is at fault here. If his name was really this important to him, don‚Äôt you think he would take the 3 minutes that it takes to setup an authenticator? He could have prevented this entire situation from even occurring. 
---
I‚Äôm sure that if authenticators did not exist, then Jagex would have a different stance on this case, There would be no way to prevent an account from being compromised.  But the thing is that they do exist. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you think that someone ‚Äúhas to‚Äù  use an authenticator. The reality is that you don‚Äôt. But at the same time, don‚Äôt go crying to Jagex because you didn‚Äôt. They can always give your account back, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs in the same condition as it was before.  
---
But it's up to you to actually say what you mean. He can't provide proof when he doesn't even know what you are questioning 
---
Incorrect, its from this one video of the bald re man dancing with a background of millions of crabs, tropica music and player requests to jagex like. 
---
$11, hide poll results, delayed authenticator, lol customer service, etc

Yes that‚Äôs the point 
---
Nice :)

Between Settled and 9rain, we will survive on an IV drip of dopamine.
---
Most of us burst slayer task.
---
Right, the Mods first comment wasn't very clear, but if you continue reading....
---
The person gave both the Username and Password to the "hacker", so that the "hacker" could obtain the username. The lack of authenticator functions as further proof of his intention.
---
Another example of this scam is a person RWT all their items for real life money and asking Jagex to return their gear because they got "hacked".
---
It‚Äôs not a mode the jedi would tell you of
---
Yeah just grind for a week bro most of those stats are AFKable / you can work on your main at the same time 
---
Seriously, I wish the possibility of that even happening was addressed. It was so random, and at the time, it almost seemed deliberate when they said they wouldn't roll it back.
---
Then again I don't know the first thing about game code.
---
The dude will think about the game everyday imo. The game shaped his entire life, I do think he cares a huge amount. If he were to buy it back, it‚Äôs not like he wouldn‚Äôt make profit. It would be a cool Reddit AMA tbh.
---
Do you do your farm runs? If not do those. Otherwise just camp some monsters that have good seed drops like nechs or abarant specters to keep your seed count up
---
What career? 
---
It's called Teeth grip, so my educated guess is gripping with teeth.
---
New account? May have gotten fed up of the meming surrounding him.
---
Lol if you can get into w420 you‚Äôre probably welcome 
---
Its a good suggestion as additional security but I would still prefer that they addressed the underlying problem: people getting access to that screen in the first place. For instance why isn't the authenticator required to log into the website when you have it enabled?
---
he just did
---
I'd say I agree, but it's up to the individual to watch it and if he limited the amount of time streaming, he would be able to hold onto some of the big reveals for YouTube channel. I don't see it much different then people looking up his stats to see what he's trained since the last episode.
---
They need a raid location in the wilderness in which two teams fight against each other to gain access to boss fights 
---
baja
---
True, but there's a difference between seeing what has been done and just seeing a stat, though.
---
I'm just happy he's considering his mental health above trying to keep the hive mind happy.
---
It's surprising how these "jagex fucked up so I got hacket" posts are getting upvoted. It's like they expect something else after the previous 20 people that made similar posts been shown to break the rules even though they said they didnt't.
---
A wilderness city, but is safe inside the city and had loads of things to do, that would be bad ass! 
---
It almost reminds of soul wars to an extent, but that's goes back to my issue of its just more pvp/bossing/slayer content which already veeeeery abundant in the wilderness. But I could see a soul wars esque thing like that.
---
Go do slayer
---
Is this a pun?
---
Maybe... &gt;.&gt;
---
Your in prime zerker prey territory bro. Correct me if i am wrong but wasn‚Äôt it corrupted weaponary which made 20def so strong? Including curses? Also a lot new raid weapons help 
---
I was wondering if runelite was safe myself. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve used for playing osrs. Not even the main client. I logged on one day to see my bank pin waiting to be canceled and everything I was wearing gone. I lost about 30m of gear. I didn‚Äôt have Authenticator then so it‚Äôs mostly my fault but still. Who could have gotten my password? I only use runelite and have never gone near a phishing link or stream. 
---
I have Authenticator now on my account and on my email and I haven‚Äôt had an issue since. However I still bank everything before I log out. Just in case.

ice bursting certain slayer tasks, it gives back maybe like 60-70% of the cash in loot. and about 100k magic xp per task
---
Looks like Reddit ones Tracy better
---
Yes. You need to level your combat stats anyway, so why not do it through slayer? Cannon just means quicker slayer experience, but if you're mostly after the other combat experience, then it doesn't really matter.
---
As someone who maxed melee via the NMZ equivalent in actual 2007 runescape... Training slayer by itself with 99/99/99 atk/str/def sucks. No regrets maxing through slayer this time.
---
The meme didn't start on 2007scape though, the earliest I saw it was on r/okbuddyretard
---
What I did was smelt gold bars into bracelets, make cannonballs and farm herbs to keep my account going while I worked on the stats and quests required for Morytania hard diary. Once you get that done Barrows becomes sooo profitable.

+1 for Chins. I got my first cape last night using Chin method. Also unlock it as a Slayer task, higher dps = less total time for kill = less jad hands kicking in 
---
Dude, no.

The whole premise of the Wilderness is that it's a desolate wasteland.
---
The "rejuvination" referred to content in the Wilderness, not the aesthetic of the place.

This is a work of art

What the hell is Ash doing with his left arm? I swear I‚Äôve seen that picture before but never have I noticed the pretend/ photoshopped stump arm.
---
Just stay calm and chill. Literally the only hard part of jad is people getting nervous. Once you've killed him once you realize it's super easy and you'll never die to him again.
---
Swettled

can we have placeholders please

Magic accuracy works off of multiplying your magic attack bonus by your magic level, so yes your magic level will increase accuracy as well as magic attack bonus.
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
anyone who didn't see this coming probably has a double digit IQ 
---
it's either weekly episodes of very little progress or twice a month, eventually probably monthly quality episodes with actual progress in them.
---
Yeah I do the farm runs just always running out of seeds even when I was doing slayer all day everyday just seems long winded at end game content to have to go camp Necs or something for seeds 
---
And now you never need to go back. Congrats. 
---
He can bend his arm backwards making it look like a stump in the picture

Tag off the healers one by one, in between attacks. As they are all on you, watch jad's attack, put on the right prayer and run through Jad. As soon as the attack hits, put on melee prayer and once you are back at the other side, watch the attacks again. The healers will be stuck and agro on you. Sounds complicated, but easy to do and exactly the way I got my cape
---
Guthan the toxic
---
You can't report an offline player through in-game can you? And it'd be suspicious going to tipoff, they'd discover the name is being traded.
---
If you could, I'd see them returning the name. But regardless, I see them adding authenticator to the website soon enough.

---
Enjoy that fire Cape bro üòÅ
---
Search PotUpSonRs on yt. He has a detailed jad luring guide. 
---
After luring jad correctly you don't have to move anywhere else. Healers spawn behind jad and are all in cbow range so you can gain agro to stop them healing. Then you can continue to kill Jad without having to worry about them.
---
Its good when we get on the band wagon for j-mods as well as when jagex fuck up. top meme.
---
Sounds about right.
---
Right. She's a criminal, he's a criminal. Simple. She abused her position to take something from someone illegally while drugging them.
---
And she was employed as an escort, assuming sex wasn't a part of it is a bit naive. Cosby used his fame as an asset, she used what she had as an asset.
---
Stop defending her because she's not accused of it. She ADMITTED to it. We don't need people to come forward unless she's the most retarded liar the world has seen
---
maybe first time buyers only
---
So basically she was just salty she got scammed for her name then lied on Reddit saying it got stolen? 
---
Can't you just call the pet or teleport/relog?
---
For lumby hard diaries, mta is tedious af with or without runelite, but runelite makes it slightly more bearable 
---
I don't think what you're saying is that implausible at all, and if it's not what happened this time then I could definitely see it happening in the future.
---
The thing that bugs me about the chat logs is that weath posted them without comment. I don't think we've been given any proof yet that they came from her ip, even though people on this sub (who know nothing about it) and running around stating it as a fact.
---
Thanks for the tip, edited it out. I was working towards DS2 before i had to take a break temporarily, but that 70 mining has me backed up. Ill follow your advice, I really appreciate it!
---
Tbf, this is insufficient evidence.
---
Not calling Mod Wealth a liar but he most certainly couldve typed that up. From the 
---
&gt;in game chat logs
---
AFAIK, you CANNOT type all in caps. So I'd honestly like to see Tracy make a hit but clearly he/she is too retarded.
---
Hey guys I found a t bow in my seed vault!
---
You waited 2 months to post this shit?
---
Well of course! Unlike some people I had to wait in line since I scheduled it for this date
---
Idk, it sounds pretty legit
---
It is also buried underneath the whole Tracy smackdown 
---
Just do 30-60 mins of mining a day, once you've got some cash from Gargs and Herbs you'll probably be 70 mining.
---
The chat input logs are in code. So you would see the input despite the games changing the displayed text to lowercase. 
---
Took me 9 tries to get my first cape! Congratulations it‚Äôs always a nice feeling getting the first one :)
---
Dont know if i have that kinda time per day to dedicate to mining, any other ways i can make the minimum for a bond?
---
You spend 6 days grinding rc nonstop and try to not get a little greasy.  There are sacrifices to be made.
---
Agreed. The potential for downvotes has never dissuaded me from speaking my mind. Accept the fact that he was DQ‚Äôd fairly and move on. Continue watching DMMT content if you enjoy it, but otherwise just don‚Äôt watch it and chill with the torvesta spam.  
---
yikes

Oh that's from the wart

Might sound harsh but sometimes it's better to start a fresh account because once you've been hacked there's always the possibility they can try recover it again in the future :(

This is honestly impressive. "She was nice enough to fuck him, while he was blacked out from the drugs she gave him and after having been robbed".
---
What if we just didn't repost everything?
---
You got to utilise the safe spots. That way nothing will spawn on top of you. Always stand by the Italy rock when a wave starts and then decide what to do by where everything spawns. :)
---
Yep, thats what all the evidence points towards. Jagex has made it clear, situations like these will not result in the name being given back
---
Hmm I don't know
---
I changed my password and bank pin, is that not enough? If that's the case it looks like i'll have to quit permanently :(
---
=-P

Alright guys I‚Äôm going back to bed

Thing i‚Äôve noticed is that low level players are such a dick toward even lower levels with even worse gear. 
---
People aren‚Äôt used to it anymore because that behaviour vanishes around lvl 90. 
---
So here i am being called a noob for using studded armour at ogress warriors at 30 range for a rune battle axe while he‚Äôs trying to hit the monster so i won‚Äôt get a drop.

This makes people salty :D cuz some 3 weeks trash player is harassing you and it‚Äôs common.
---
They don‚Äôt even understand the concept of ironman or don‚Äôt like that people are doing it.

I'm so sorry but it sounds like both your accounts are not only perma banned but chances are you're going to Jail. I would expect the police at your door within the next 24 hours

If your account get banned but the streamers and youtubers can share accounts then just go to each channel grab every link they are using a lent account.. And make your case on how is that different.

Funniest comment I‚Äôll read all year right here kids
---
Jad isnt bossing and jad hands have nothing to do with normal boss killing. 
---
Listen to the bot. It speaks the truth
---
i never thought I'd be disappointed that something wasn't bass boosted and deep fried
---
It depends how fast you can get them off of jad. If they are not able to heal jad to full hp and you kill them, they won't respawn. If they get jad to full hp, they will respawn.
---
What i did on my recent clear (last tuesday) is this :
---
If you can trap jad behind italy rock, and you have the healers on you before jad is healed to full. You can kill the healers first without the need of prayflicking jad in the meantime. Then, when they're dead, you can go fight jad 1v1 again. Like that the fight is a piece of cake if you can control your nerves. :) 
---
Is it productive for a fire fighter to put out a fire you knowingly started

Well, then this guy pressing charges is currently the key to bringing her to justice. The statute of limitations hasn't passed yet.
---
We shouldn't be afraid to make helms that surpass Neitz. It looks like trash, comes from an easy questline, and costs next to nothing. The DFH should have much better defensive stats, at least comparable to justiciar full helm. It should also probably be taken up to a tier 70 armour, along with the dragon platebody, as that should probably be stronger as well.

Spending 1B!
---
and what have you learned
---
You're so full of shit, it's unbelievable. A quick google of your name shows all your accounts on two legal advice forums where you type using "ur" and "u". 
---
I'm more than happy to link you to screenshots of these posts, if you've forgotten. 
---
/u/GoPlayOutsid hit the nail on the head with tagging the healers one by one in between each attack. If you're using a blowpipe, it might put you in melee range when grabbing one or two of them, so be mindful. You can switch to Long Range beforehand if you'd like, then just switch back after you've got the healers.
---
If you've never stacked mobs, I'd suggest rolling into NMZ with an absorb or two and just see how you move to stack them. If you just take a step to the side after every healer you get, you can eventually stack them in a straight line, so that you have all 4 on you, but only the 1 next to you is attacking you. You may also get them into an L shape, where you're the bend, so that 2 are attacking you. That's a bit riskier since they can hit up to 14 and that can start to add up depending on what you're wearing.
---
I did it at 70 defense as well, and I considered bringing a Verac's Plateskirt or something, but the loss of prayer compared to God Dhide was a bit too much. You can do it full in god d'hide, but it's very important to get the healers stacked right, otherwise they can start chunkin' you.
---
Other than that, the suggestion to use dragon darts in the blowpipe is nice, too. That way if you only get 3 of 4 healers off, you can still out DPS the one healer, and it gets the fight over faster so you have less time to make mistakes.
---
Along with that, as someone pointed out, if you didn't know, on wave 62 where the very bright orange-yellow mage spawns, that is where Jad will spawn. I personally stand right next to that while I kill the last mage, so I can immediately pray for his first attack without having to guess, but it's up to you how to handle that part.
---
I know you're getting bombarded with information, but you got this, dude. The nerves are all mind-games. Remind yourself that the mechanics are literally as simple as watching for him rearing up, or slamming on the ground, and hitting either mage or ranged (respectively,) and that's about it. Then you just spit darts at his stupid face until he's dead.

That was my issue. I live in Korea, and my first 2 Jad attempts were loss to 3-5 second lag spikes. It was absolutely gutwrenching, only because it was entirely out of my control and I had just wasted so much damn time on him.
---
Having to go through those waves over and over because of it just made me even more irritated about doing it, since at that point, the waves were literally just arduos background noise to get to the main show. I ended up doing it finally when I logged out on wave 61 and just came back to it the next day, so I wasn't just drained from going through the waves and staring at that god awful bright-red-black ground.

That‚Äôs incorrect it also relates to children of immigrants.

Like someone else suggested, absolutely utilize safespots. I got my firecape at 70 defense, and if you're using safespots well, you shouldn't even have to sip a brew until the 30-tier of waves. Italy rock is an absolute banger of a safespot.

Someone has probably said this already but I cant find it easily by scrolling down this chain-

You would have to name change 2x to free up the name to transfer it to another account-which means they have to have access to his auth if he had one- AND his bank pin to use the bond to name change again.

There are areas where you can mostly avoid this... Or instead of running  away, kill the iron dragon, and stick in the same area. After a while they'll de-aggro and you can just fight the steel dragons.

Ik there are spots to stand but it wasn't working. After every kill I had to fend off iron dragons. And I just think it's stupid that for a 59 steel dragon task I have to kill one iron dragon for every kill. Or wait 15min to lose aggro. I realize I could work around it but that's pretty fucking ridiculous to do one tadm when jagex could make it it's own room.

You can afk in the catacombs, can't really afk in the slayer tower. Maybe gargs, but don't leave the loot laying around too long ;) so just do what u want / can (afk, go to cok, if not afk, maybe alch in between hits at the slayer tower for some extra magic xp / gp profit)
---
What quests should I do first?
---
interestingly enough, you still can burn the first shrimp if you cook it on someone else's fire, it just treats it like you cooking normally outside of the tutorial.  by doing this you can skip the woodcutting section completely if you successfully cook it.
---
this is a new thing with the new tutorial update btw, wasn't there previously
---
i dont play rs anymore but i come to this sub everyday for shit like this. 
---
Account gone in 1....2....
---
Seemed like the obvious route, it's what I've been trying to do. 
---
He's pretty on point. I do believe there was editing done for sake of output to Tracy but it could've been a table where it was timestamp,  userid, message and weath just extracted the message that was typed by Tracy initially. 
---
Storing chatlogs of whatever was the output of f(input) is a loss of information meaning: instead of storing what was posted into the game after a users message,capture the message at time of input. 
---
This allows jagex to see website that's were advertised, instead they would just see ********. 
---
Also they have the function to convert input to chat output so they can always run user input through at their disposal to see what it would look like in game.
---
Source: bought some tinfoil shares

You cannot burn the first shrimp since October 2018 update

Would be weird that they're aggressive though, unless they were doing some dark necromancy shit but then you'd need to add some small quest in there to explain the lore to it all. Would add necromancy to F2P world though, which I guess would be pretty cool.

It's funny, last time there was a "J Mod smackdown" they were lying to us. Or did y'all forget [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b32evs/update_3_acct_returned_350_mil_bank_gone_tons_of/) already?

20 defence was never really "strong" if your opponent knew what they were doing, in the old days of hiei, meleed and people like that, success of all pures was based on stats and the majority of people in the wilderness not really having a clue what they were doing. Watch some of mahatmas and fear figments videos for evidence of this. 
---
Back then even the "famous pkers" couldn't eat more than once between hits, let alone eat, switch gear and prayers and click a barrage/spec/next hit. 
---
Once PvP gear and curses were released people like bonesaw, rendimento, l0rd of day started coming out of the woodwork with 20-30 defence, but even then in most cases the DPS was just more than people could handle rather than being as proficient as pkers now. 
---
There were very few (there were some) people who could hybrid like you see these days, or handle prayers and switches like the majority of high tier pkers now. 
---
Tldr; 20 defence was better when nobody had a clue what was going on. You'll get kills, but mostly you'll get wiped by rune pures, and almost anyone else with a gmaul. 
---
How was the ass eating experience?

Make it unique accounts killed. If someone wants to bond 100s of accounts and get them to the same combat as their HCIM just to have them die so be it.

Congrats!! I had no idea there was so much behind doing clues, whether it was doing X amount for an item or emote, or rolling the dice on a pet. Good to know there's more I'm working towards doing all these things.

Enable Loot tracker in the plugins list. Now you will see a little inventory icon in the side bar - whenever you kill something, the loot can be seen by clicking on that icon.
---
I legit was thinking this ever since coming back to the game on osrs. The one thing I miss or think was a great thing back in pre-eoc was the lending system.

It would destroy the prices of all of the high end items you‚Äôre lending and crash prices of boss loots.

---
Really cool how you lucid dream at the southern entrance of vorock
---
The wiki has an optimal quest guide that's really nice to follow. 
---
In no particular order, good unlocks/goals will be
---
- fremmenik trials for the helms (berzerker, Archer, and farseer are all great until you get some really high level stuff)
---
- fairy tale 1 and start 2 (don't need 2's reqs, just get to the part you can use fairy rings)
---
- tree gnome village or whatever it is to unlock the spirit trees
---
- ardougne easy diary for ardy cape (free tell to an altar that's close to a fairy ring and a spirit tree, really good for getting around for free)
---
- monkey madness 1 to get a dragon scimitar
---
- recipe for disaster gloves
---
- underground pass for iban's blast (be sure to upgrade the staff).
---
- dragon defender
---
For gear, mystic robes set is nice for magic, whatever dhide you can wear for range, and then for melee rune is fine, get a dragon dagger p++ for its special attack and work on getting dragon scim. 
---
Also get a combat bracelet until you can get mithril/adamant gloves.
---
Nice, I love to see different weapons get used in pvp like that roulette series someone made, can't remember who. Pugger maybe?
---
Also as far as rings/amulets/gloves go, rings are virtually useless in terms of combat, a handful raise stats by a few points it you‚Äôre likely paying bank for them, it‚Äôs not worth it till you can really afford it. I say just buy whatever ring has the best benefit or teleport you want.
---
For gloves/amulet, if you want a great strength bonus use Combat Bracelet/ Amulet of Glory. This is also decent for ranged since both give attack bonuses to ranged. 
---

A significant portion of the community is weirdly opposed to more accessible banking and changes that effectively increase the amount of bank spaces you have. They always argue that "no one needs 816 spaces" but that's beside the point. No one *needs* to play runescape lol.

You can make as many as you want In the quest. And they‚Äôre kinda useless imo.

Being a prostitute is a choice just like being a drug addict or a gang banger is.

Only motherfuxkers our here giving free passes on this kinda bullshit are the people who has silver spoons in their mouth their whole life.

Ah okay thanks. I took a break after that update maybe a week later. I never thought about how that would effect rapier price so much. I think 150m more accurately depicts it‚Äôs value though. I had one at 315m and it was good but not game changing. Interested to see where they‚Äôll settle.

Completely guessing, but I guess they mean messing with shop limits. Like the main sells 20k steel arrows to an arrow shop and the iron man buys them. I don't see why this would be an issue, though.

Thanks for the support. I don't even think it needs to a BiS, it just needs to beat other pre tbow/scythe items somewhere so that it has a proper use.

Biggest piece of evidence to me was that by the chat logs it actually looks like someone approached them about it rather than the person on the account looking to sell it prior. 
---
Is that what they did to your reddit name?

Splashing is just casting a spell over and over on an NPC (usually level 1 rats) and it missing because your Magic bonus is below -65. Whenever you cast the spell you will get the XP for the cast regardless it hits or not.
---
Splashing  combat spells like fire bolt or something are **extremely** afk. So it's favorable cause you don't really have to pay attention at all to raise your magic up.
---
Please sell these bobbleheads
---
It speeds up the kills so much that the additional profit almost always makes it worth using. I just listed all the places where scythe is objectively worth using.
---
Same here, got it in my third try with three years in between the second and third attempts  Completed in 65 minutes, blowpipe is OP. Gratz man!

It's not cost or time effective, but it is afk

After his 100th failed attempt at conquering the Theater of Blood,

a young Settled once again finds himself plodding towards the entrance of the great swamp of Morytania with his Karil‚Äôs gear in a the hue of a deep red, degraded past recognition,
---
his crossbow broken, 
---
and his amulet corroded brown and ingrained to his leathertop. 
---
Yet,

his blue cape, maintained with sedulous care, still flowing gracefully as the warm and heavy swamp air sweeps past him, seeping into his coif.

A breathe of fresh air.

Sorry everyone got so out of hand. After all, the max cash stack drops, xp fuck up, and the tbow spawn were all very minor and in no way were errors that seriously fucked the game.

I ment it like this:

Everyone that uses Runelite has the plugin to track the loot. Regardless if the player has that plugin enabled or not, the Runelite client may/can track it.
---
As there is a project now to gather all that data, does that mean people manually gather the data (via the plugin) and edit the wiki?  Or does Runelite track it (automated)? If that is the case, far more data would be gathered than a bunch of people manually hunting all the possible drops!

You're taking it way too personal though. Nobody cares about gender on the internet. Especially Reddit and OSRS, the majority of people are dudes, so it's easy to assume others are too.

That's exactly what the merchers want. People see the price spiking and are scared to buy -&gt; less buy offers from normal 'non-mercher' people -&gt; merchers can place higher buy offers with their alt and sell to themselves -&gt; price goes up. After some time, when 'non-merchers' seem confident that the price is 'good' and stabilize/keeps going up slowly, they start placing more and more buy offers. At that time the merchers dump all their stock and it crashes.

You literally just did nothing but make excuses for incompetence and then on top of that prop jagex up on a pedestal because they can't be allowed to decide on content for their own game which they already ruined once. The fact that you don't see the irony behind the content polls blows me away. They literally fucked up so hard before that people wanted the ability to decide what updates happen so they can insure Jagex won't fuck up so massively again.

Anyone want to buy a cheap rsn btw? Ill sell for 45m (never seen 200m stack). Not me btw.

That's only true if you look at probabilities as being seperate for each skill - they are not. Probabilities do not have measurement units, they're a simple ratio and can be pooled together. As I have over ~70m total "petable" exp (so to speak), I'm well above the drop rate (~26m exp).

I could afk for about 1 minute at a time at 97/98 ranged with ranged pots. At lower ranged levels (and without elite void and ranged pots) kills are going to be slower as well, making them more afk. I guess you could also kill them with fire bolt as an afk magic training method but I haven't tested it out.

They drop 1 dose pray pots, so I was able to keep on sharp eye (the +5% prayer) the entire time.

In the key of C, the mode starting from A is called Aeolian scale, or as you said, all the same notes as a regular minor scale. So yes, all the same notes as C major (all white keys).

Honestly theory is tough to understand because it's a systen where the foundation isn't logical, but it becomes  relatively logical once you fully understand the foundation, if that makes sense. It's often redundant too, which doesn't help.

I watched it a couple of days ago. IIRC the method consists of trapping them and running away when they're about to change attack style, which makes it so that they always alternate back and forth between magic and ranged.

Regardless, this is exactly my point. The sub is just infested with endless and disproportionate negativity. If you have such issue with Jagex's mistakes over the past few months, then stop playing and stop giving them money.

Reddit posts and nickname could lead further, if you're lucky your find their social media. And once you do that, oh boy, people share a lot on social media. Family name, family members' names, hometown, location, phone number, e-mail, pets' names etc. Of course each of these steps requires the user to make a huge fuck up, but a lot of people just don't care as they're ensured they're safe online.

You're in the wrong place if you are expecting inclusiveness on this subreddit. You're not going to get special treatment for being a girl here, unlike real life. There's plenty of other places where you can have your own safespace, where your opinions aren't actively challenged. Reddit isn't the optimal place for 'mindfulness', and you are not mindful yourself when you're blaming men (hello, that's sexist?) for being rude towards others because of gender and race. Which isn't true at all, sexism and racism are topics which are heavily moderated all around Reddit, including this subreddit. 
---
That said, you're definitely showing off how entitled you are, you're new here and you're expecting people to change their behavior and their way of expressing themselves because you think they are in the wrong. Reality check: people have different opinions than you, if a majority likes something and you don't then you are either in the wrong place, or you are wrong yourself. As I've stated before, nobody gives a flying fuck about your race, gender of whatever other nonsense you can think of, stop placing boxes around yourself, and don't pull out your victim card. You're just a username, nothing more, nothing less.

You realize posting on reddit aren‚Äôt his duties, right?  You also realize he had no need to comment here right? He did so of his own accord to reassure the contest winner that they really are taking steps to ensure things happen more smoothly and in a more timely manner than they previously have.
---
With that said, I guess there will always be ungrateful cunts like you around.
---
Ps: Scroll through his comment history. Seems to be FAR more than ‚Äúonce in a blue moon‚Äù to me.

Look at the smiley face use though. Nobody uses ‚Äú=-(‚Äú emojis but both the reddit comment and chat log use then.
---
 I think that's totally different. That's the situation when people go on ridiculous dry streaks and then finally get the pet at like 40,000 KC. In this case, people are just astounded by the RNG and think it's a fun thing to imagine what the odds are of a single instance of killing bandos and a minion ONCE and getting that as a drop. Just because the figure is more impressive and much more simple to calculate than the odds of someone getting it considering all their KC.

With a tbow you will have enough time to kill a Jad without using any restore as long as you're 80+ pray and rigour on. All you have to do is focus on the pray switches. When healers come out, take your time. Pray-&gt;tag-&gt;pray-&gt;tag-&gt;pray-&gt;tag. Only do 1 action at a time. Then all you have to do is concentrate on the jads. If you are even unsure in between pray switches, dont tag a healer and instead focus on prayer.

When you have 2 left, use the extra time to use and brews/restores if needed.

Goodluck!

Reddit is a psuedo-anonymous website, people behave differently because as a username they can be whoever they want to be, and yes, that IS a positive thing. Would you rather have these 'angry men' as you proclaim them to be to be like this in real life? It's an outlet, a way to get rid off negative emotions that most don't want to project towards the real world. Sure, some take it too far, but the moderators get rid off those full-blown idiots. 
---
Nobody is entitled to respect, respect is something that is mutually earned, and not a given. 
---
Discussions on the internet have become a form of entertainment for many, and you shouldn't expect anything worthwhile to come from most sites like Reddit. Join a local debate club if you want a proper discussion. 
---
The internet doesn't have or care about feelings, and any rational person in real life wouldn't care about your emotions if they are factually right regardless. Getting emotional is a choice and should never replace factual arguments in a discussion.

It's not an emoji, and nah.

Personally attacking someone because they don't support attacking the developers in the same way you do. lol, nice.

Youch, either way that's really rough. Hopefully it either gets fixed or you find a way to stomach the reset because if that's all true that's really brutal.

I agree with /u/Lord_Ahrim1536 - go down to 8 brews, take another restore and another ranged pot.  I would also swap the helm, you want to be a bit tankier against any melee hits you take accidentally and the healers at Jad.  For example, I do my Jad runs with a Justicar helm.  
---
Also, this is a personal touch, but I found that prior to my first Jad kill, I had a few extra potions, but struggled to drink a brew/restore combo AND keep up with everything else.  I swapped 1 restore for a Manta Ray.  This allowed me to only use 1 click to eat the 1 time I had to eat during the Jad fight, and I didn't have to bother with reduced stats or anything.  That just helped me in the heat of the moment, but it's not entirely standard.  I also don't do this anymore but the fight is easier for me now with much higher stats.
---
My yew log business would go under. 
---
That would be sweet
---
ok, hold the fuck up.  Someone EXPLAIN to me how these situations differ:
---
Scenario 1: I bring monks robes, unholy/holy amulet, minimal food, willow bow with steel arrows and begin to attack pvpers, im 'ragging' them as i risk nothing, doing so is considered a dick move and potentially bannable.
---
Scenario 2: I 2 item at revs with those same monks robes, unholy amulet, etc.  but this time i have a blowpipe and nieznot helm, becuase im only carrying 2 items of value any 1 item that i get at revs gets saved if i die.  Thus, there is no loot to be had, but i get PKed anyways despite clearly not risking.  This is NOT considered ragging?  Why?  
---
Scenario 3: A PKer, we will make up a fake name off the top of my head... torvester, goes into the wilderness and starts killing unarmed clue scroll hunters.  Torvester is only armed with 1 real item hes risking, and he is not risking... so hes killing without risking, but this ALSO isnt considered ragging?
---
Scenario 4: Torvester wants to skull trick people, but he doesnt wanna risk, so he dresses up in a black dragon mask and junk items he cant lose, or that have no value when lost.  He APPEARS to be risking, but only to people who dont know the game well enough.  As per usual, torvester is only carrying 1-3 items, like D-claws or a maul, and he goes out and attacks players.  HOW IS THIS NOT RAGGING?

Yes but this sub sees anything in rs3 as bad no matter what.

why knife?

I dont get it :D upvote!

Prices would inflate exponentially, then coins would effectively become worthless. Scrub accounts will be forced to actually do content as opposed to buying their way through the game at the GE.

Ironmen, as the superior account types, would be largely unaffected.

I took the CC into the wildy on stream for a laugh because we're all (mostly) bad at PKing, one of the guys i was in voice chat with (for a joke) decided to get the cc to backstab me, there was no risk, it was just for a laugh and then after i died it was just everyone fighting each other. It was a joke thing we were doing with the CC and the guy who PK'd the cash stack was an outsider, joined the CC because he was watching the livestream of the occasion, and seems to have killed a common member of the CC for 20M.  
---
Personally i feel a little guilty since it was something i organised for a joke and the guy lost his entire cash stack but if you PK a cash stack in a 1v1 its fair game. Since it was an honest mistake to bring the cash I'd probably return half of it but that's me. 
---
If his name was changed to a # combo then he didnt change his name to sell it.
---
His name was force removed if that was the case

Dungeoneering should‚Äôve always been a minigame or some sort of fighting dungeon. Its not a skill and never should‚Äôve been added as one

I hope that you get some Jmod attention.

Though Jed's method was to recovery hack the one letters (and the accounts with 350b) whereas your name looks like it was force changed by Jmod?
---
I don't believe for a SECOND that a one character was traded for any word names, that was either a red-herring or straight bullshit. 
---
What is the timeframe on this name change stuff? It looks like the character has been been the same since just over a year ago with the Jed thing happening a lot later on?:
---

Everything aside, I think the entire name system and rules/methods are broken and dodgy and only encourage hacking, deceit and leaves players in a weird grey-area with little recourse.

A player with the username "Tracy" tried to sell her username for in-game gold but got scammed. She then came onto this subreddit and created a post claiming her name was stolen and Jagex should give her name back, but Mod Weath came in and told her she wasn't getting it back as she tried to sell it. She demanded proof, so he posted the chat log for it, showing her bartering her name away.
---
Use mouse keys. By default 5 and + are left click. Spam through and clean everything just going back and forth. No dragging because its an instant click/release

Does it matter what I say? These people have been dragging me through the mud for three years. I have tried to reason, I have tried to explain why they are wrong and, most importantly, I have no  way to even scam anybody since I used to play an UIM account :').

But hey, you probably already made up your mind too. That's what you get when a bunch of people decide to frame you and combine their downvotes.

So you guys just run to reddit after Jagex says no, begging for public humiliation? 
---
People pay for protection as it is.
---
Haven't you seen the long reply threads of "Nice"?
---
Any tips on clans? xD
---
Dude same
---
For every example you should ask yourself the following:  
---
1. Am I potentionally risking anything of value? (e.g. revenant loots, clue scroll gear etc.)  
---
2. Is the person attacking perceived to be risk anything of value?
---
3. Is the person attacking specific players again and again to a point where it could be considered harassment?
---
And a follow-up question to question 3: What is likely the intent of the player repeatedly attacking that specific player?
---
By definition ragging requires the attacker to repeatedly attack a specific player or group of players with the intent to harass.   
---
In Scenario 1 you are being a nuisance at first, but only if you spend a couple hours attacking the same PVPers over again with the intent to harass and not to fight for pking/profits sake I would consider it ragging.
---
In Scenario 2 You are potentially risking money and seem like an easy target to kill for profit. Being attacked while engaging in any type of PVM by a player with the intent to kill/harass and not harass is not ragging, but pking.
---
In Scenario 3 &amp; 4 you must consider what Torvestas intent is: he is not harassing, but pking. However "scummy" it may be, there is no problem in that. If he were to attack specific players while risking nothing without a realistic chance of actually killing them then I would consider that ragging.
---
Time frame, risk and intent are the three most mportant factors when assessing whether or not I consider something to be ragging or not. There is no clear line. That is why it is up to the discretion of the jmods to assess when a players toxic behavior is or isn't "Player Harassment".
---
If you do more PKing than PvM than don‚Äôt - if you do more PvM than PKing than max out the def and att.
---
Correct!

How/when did you get 99?
---
what the hell
---
If they could, they would have back in 2005... or 2006... or 2007... only any of the following years. They cannot.
---
I'll try and provide a short summary here: 
---
I joined a PK'ing trip via Twitch. The streamer got BS'd by his friends in discord as the trip was ending. Then the entire clan chat began attacking each other after this (apart from me). From this, I got piled by five people. I survived and killed the majority. One of them had 21M cash on them. 
---
Enjoy your pineapples!

I bet dude, barrows gloves is bad enough lool

Ahh man I still need ds2, only just got piety which was a 15 min quest... Nowhere near ready for an hour/day long one üòÇ

Gl on your acc though boss, add me ig if you like rsn is Wrenny :) 
---
Link to original context?
---
unlucky not to get the pet i guess.
---
Most of these guys getting their rare old names stolen are idiots then honestly.
---
If you accidentally got phished or keylogged its a simple mistake and it really sucks, there's nothing you can do about it. 
---
But I feel as though that's not the full story with these because pins are very hard to get. In a game where there is no recovery process for victims of security breaches you should likely secure your account. So much time and experience in the online community and these guys can't figure it out.

Because sgs restores prayer making it a highly valuable weapon in pve.

EDIT: It's ike the Dude says. You're not wrong, you're just an asshole. 
---
Rs3 is a great game but the pay to win ruins it. The whole chest and keys for exp is a total fucking insult. 
---
Like I said. It doesn't matter what rank you are in pvm or skilling.  It's pretty typical when individuals like this come to the wild.

 Love how they censored the name and then left it in one of the comments.
---
i mean you aren't really contradicting what i'm saying. Even pre-void nerf arma still was used in many places. Just not raids.
---
&gt;Meanwhile the Dragon Claws, a far more useful item in both PVP and PVM, have maintained a much higher price than Elder Maul despite having a higher drop rate. 
---
which also doesn't really contradict what i'm saying. Claws is included in the "useful high demand raids1 items" because theyre used heavily in raids1/2 and a few other random pet hunting places, as well as in pvp.

Rule 73 of Reddit: if you mention downvotes, your chance of being downvoted increases 10x

Is there any point to smithing? I feel even on an ironman you could get rune items before you'd ever have enough smithing to craft them.

?

they didnt say they got rid of them, they said they made a plan to fight them or something like that.
---
Ahahhahahahhahhahahah

Something about jagex = bad ?
---
Yes, it is. :)
---
Damn that must have taken all 20 minutes. The grind is finally over!
---
Is this by purchasing a bond?

You can cheat by practicing on some rs private server that starts with jad/triple jads and then try it in main game.

Idk why, first thought was osrs ge overlayed on top of the mm1 final boss platform

How did you not notice your character model change?

Birdhouse run takes you maybe 3 minutes.

There are 23 skills.

Birdhouses are gathered every hour. If every skill has a passive training method like birdhouses, you will literally be able to train every skill 'passively'.

Think about it.

Uh there's a change name option on the website that will let you change your name to the previous one you had, I don't know if you need to use a bond to have a name change for it
---
They get banned within 10 minutes and put back up within 10 minutes. It's a difficult problem to stop.

I made a post about this a couple days ago, I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. I was shown [this video](https://youtu.be/EXJl-33AUAE) and told to quest my ass off

Omg you hit a 0 has spec on a cow twice!!!! That clip is golden!!

made my week thanks

F2p and p2p are almost completely different games. It depends on your goals.
---
If you intend to keep your account a lvl 3 skiller, start up asap.  Mems just has better training options.
---
If you are a Skilling heavy account that doesn't mind combat, pursue mems asap. Mems has better options.
---
If you are staisfied with how your are playing the game right now, don't get mems.
---
There is an entire world of low leveled content for members. Your skill levels don't need to be higher than 1 to have an enjoyable time.

---
Fishing is in a fine place as it is &amp; it's already AFK enough that adding a passive way of training it would be overkill. There's enough dailies in the game as it is.

Lol the g/a in place of g#. 200iq

It still wouldnt be worth doing 
---
Youve taken everything out of context. The people who bitch about single players in DMM dont give a shit about the tourney. The people who complain about 11$ just say it to complain. Has nothing to do with how good or bad they feel the game is. The people who complain about contest winners also dont give a shit about them either unless someone brings it up.

A lot of the community does it just to do it, whether it be for karma or an attempt at attention.

I really hope your account gets banned and you're part of that 1%. Will give you the opportunity to view things a different way.
---
Thanks mate, StyleScape B)
---
TzHaar are a good task to have unlocked though and it only costs 100 points. For a new player that ~15% increase in DPS is great, it means you take less damage while enemies are alive, use less potions and ammo, and have less time to make a mistake. No it's not necessary but it will be a less expensive, less time consuming, and less stressful attempt
---
Yeah they did dude. read top of the thread. 
---
GG hacked
---
My point was that it's purely a demand issue, not a supply one. If it were a supply issue then the AGS would have plummeted in price in mid-2017 when Void was nerfed and Arma GWD became insanely profitable. Instead, the price of AGS didn't budge.

I'm just going to reply once cause I have better ways to spend my time, but don't you think perpetuating the idea that you can only choose between PvMing or pking content and that every player makes this choice just shows that in reality you're insecure about your ability to participate in the other activity? I do both, I enjoy both, and most of the people I know in game do both. Do you realise you're the exact same as the PvMers (that I'm sure you despise) who make the pk brainlet memes?

LMAO I pvm and pk but whatever floats your boat. What I'm "perpetuating" is that this is typical for pvmers.  And is the case for those that don't do both or pk at all. They typically lack skills, the ability to stay calm or think, and game mechanics.

TLDR - projecting little bitch is talking out of his ass.  You can come find me when you wanna raid though shit kid.

Make it upgradeable too: chance to unlock a top hat, monacle, bow tie, or something like that

Their ability to put it over a video has no correlation to if their idea is good. One is an editing skill and the other is a creative thinking skill.

I mean- why is it so easy to set up a new bot in runescape/most mmos?

There's a lot of people who play and if you can make money, people are going to abuse it. Accounts are free and easy to make, which is impossible to fix. 
---
That‚Äôs like day 1 bruh

I agree with this, with essentially 2 banks for seeds, it can be a little annoying to have to deposit seeds in 2 different places if you like to keep certain seeds in both places. Miscellania automatically handling this based on what‚Äôs already stacked in the vault is amazing, maybe add something to bankers or deposit boxes to allow the vault to be deposited into more easily

Get your woodcutting to 61 for yews/woodcutting guild/dragon axe....get fishing up to either 68 for guild or 82 for minnows, by fly fishing since it‚Äôs fastest xp for skiller anyways...fishing guild and woodcut guild have invisible +7 level boost, get your mining 30 at minimum for mother lode mine, do knights sword to get to 29 smithing right away and smith whatever you have saved up to get to 35 for cannonballs, get your crafting up a few levels right away then take any money you come across and buy gold bars and craft the highest level necklace/ring/amulet you can to raise crafting and make profit...any questions you can pm me your in game name I am a skiller as well

On RS3 there's so many daily activities that are insane gp and xp that it's crazy to not do it. Result is that every day you spend your first hour or so doing the same stuff every day.
---
OSRS has a few things you do on logging on like fruit trees (not really a daily but you do it once a day) and battlestaves. I dread them expanding that list as it's really not fun

Lmao yeah, barrows was the worst lol. Alright man, gl to you too

I'm at 1500 and 0 unique so far. Although my GP per kill has been higher than avg at almost 170k at this point

I was logged out of the game the same day I got the name during the name release and that's a fact. I didn't sell anything, the account with the brackets is mine. I re-added it each time it moved "Zebede" was the account it went to when my name changed to the brackets.

I love stories like this about rust. The steam reviews on it is some of the funniest shit you‚Äôll ever read.

The ban does say it was for botting though, like i said i haven't played in just under a year and last i did was merching up to getting the bond that i got. never wanted to use it and waste it so i stopped playing.

Ive looked around and couldn't find anything about any appeal things. Thanks for the wishes.

If we had a yearbook, this guy would get the "Motivator No-one Asked For" superlative.

what's pid?

Ty for the explanation

I have arthritis and heavily use AHK/python scripts etc. to 1:1 remap things like clicking etc.

I think it's technically against the rules but you'll never get banned for it, and morally I don't think there's anything wrong with it as long as each key does one thing and does the same thing every press.

I always assumed it's because he's Guthan the Infested and therefore he's all bloated.

I like to think that in life all the other Barrows brothers had these mystical powers obtained from divine sources, and then there's Guthan who just has extra food hidden in his pocket and hopes none of the others notice because he really wants to fit in.

41 Attack and 7 Strength??

yeah dude aha

wow that is fucking edgy  
---
Depends on the context, if your only goal is to solve clues, then probably spade is your best bet. 
---
If the only reason you play is do make an obby pure, then obby maul is pretty good choice.
---
If your settled, then probably rune and pure essence to finish priest in peril to access canifis.

Context matters.

Not sure which is more cringe, blocking 665 people because they mentioned something you don't like or posting about it afterward as if anyone is supposed to care or think you're cool. Big yikes, kid.
---
To stop people from cheating with screenshots taken days before the event start, release a specific criteria for the screenshot (e.g. have "XYZ" typed in chat box) a couple of hours before the start.
---
It seems someone has a life haha :D
---
From lookin at your gear, you seem like you don‚Äôt have very much trouble making money
---
The fuck are you talking about you literal mongoloid, I made the last comment, you didn't. Just how much stupider can you get?
---
it would have to be the gold coin
---
Either you didn't understand what I meant or I completely missed the point of OPs post. I completely understand the point that OP didn't have the prayer level. Let me walk you through this. 
---
I WAS SUGGESTING THAT OP SELL THE REMAINING 20% OF HIS BANK TO BUY THE REMAINING PRAYER LEVELS. 
---
As I remember it, the prayers didn't do as much to the prices of boss items as summoning did, but I didn't remember it all that well so I looked it up.
---
Unfortunately, the price history doesn't go back far enough to determine it definitively. The earliest date is 20th of May 2008, 4 months and 5 days after summoning was released. It surely took some time for most PvMers to use it against bosses, so it gives a very clear indication even though it is 4 months later.
---
I checked the 4 hilts. Armadyl hilt crashed from 112m on May 20th to 53m on 23rd of September. That's a 53% drop in 4 months.
---
3rd of December 2009 was when curses were released and Armadyl hilt was worth 117m. 4 months later, 99m, 8 months, 80m.
---
Saradomin hilt: 95m to 38m in late October. 60% drop in 5 months, took a bit longer. Curses? 81m to 69m in the first 4 months, next 5 months it's lowest was 53m.
---
Bandos hilt: 35m to 19m in early October, 17m in late November. Again, curses didn't have as much of an impact. 27m to 25m in the first 4 months, a further 2 months and it was still 24m, yet 2 more months to 21m.
---
I think you get the point and I can save myself from looking up Kril, who wasn't that popular because of no Zammy hasta.
---
Summoning made all the items crash hard, while curses had a similar, but lower impact on Zilyana and Kree. Graardor went free which is understandable imo because he was easy enough to camp already just with summoning there that curses didn't matter too much.
---
Curses would have a huge impact on OSRS without a doubt. But honestly, I feel like summoning would have the bigger impact.
---
But it‚Äôs not that fun
---
that magic def bonus doe!
---
Why the fuck is the Walmart spark up there as well?
---
&gt;!It says that Hewey was killed and I should be able to take advantage of the situation, which corresponds to the scene resetting every time I re-enter the room: Each time, I can take the knife and kill Abigale, but the (presumably) last cutscene just does not happen.!&lt;
---
But thanks for the idea, I should have checked that earlier.
---
Exactly.  üçø worthy. 
---
I hope they're 30 minute vids
---
Then you either took it unfairly or they thought you took it unfairly, or you hoarded names. There's only two options there then
---
Also if you dont mind do they have a problem with you making a new account if a previous one gets banned?
---
Lol I did that same shit with my graceful

inb4 hacked post
---
this man is my hero, you got 70 agility? so what dont stop till 99 loser! thats what he would tell you.
---
Can we get a jmod investigation? It seems like a hacked account
---
not the best greenscreening
---
&gt;I never mentioned viewers being a requirement. You need to work on your strawmen. I said the top streams for the game, which is exclusively where the phising streams reside, should have a requirement for time streamed or affiliate/partner status.
---
top streamers is entirely defined by viewer count.  Literally descending order from highest viewer count down.
---
&gt;This is just retarded and doesn't deserve an explanation.
---
Literally strawmanning in the same post as criticizing other for stawmanning.  Absolute classic.
---
&gt;&gt;I didn't suggest that.
---
&gt;"...or require partner/affiliate status to be displayed as one of the top streamers for the game."
---
oh ok.
---
Sorry my in game name is Shane Falco 
---
You right.
---
Yikes
---
Yeah. He had the level for the agility shortcut, but going that way would require going through multi. So he probably though it would be safer to go through the long way (which is mostly single combat).
---
&gt; You don't have to sell an account to sell a name. 
---
No fucking shit, but you have to have an account to sell a name, therefore names are real world objects just as much as accounts are, and selling them for gold is still RWT with extra steps.
---
Just got the mith kite g btw ;)
---
Penance queen titties?

That's funny, I've been playing since 2006, and haven't been hacked a single time. 
---
Are you sure it's Jagex' fault that your account is being compromised?
---
Lol!
---
He's not nicky minaj tho
---
I don't think most PVMers deny that PKing takes skill, they're just pissed off that they're being PKed when they don't want to be PVPing in the first place.
---
&gt; I didn't say it wasn't against the rules. Just that it's a different rule. 
---
&gt;Buying names with gp isn't against the rules.
---
Pick one, Name selling is RWT, its simple, if you do it you should be banned for RWT.
---
ME2 isn't even that bad when you compare it to MM2, which I think is by far the worst quest in the game. At least with ME2 you can follow a guide step for step whereas with MM2 they're constantly assblasting you with BS.
---
How many hours a week are you pulling? Theres a bunch of 500-1m/hr methods with pretty modest requirements.

Then don't use it you gomper.

Wow a screenshot = ultimate proofsicles.

thats jagex fault for trying to cut corners instead of updating pvp i agree with u

Hi,

I'm going to do woodcutting first so that I'm able to get enough logs to burn for that good firemaking level.
---
Then going to try out Wintertodt and hope it's going to make me good cash. 
---
After that or before that I might do some thieving because that gets you good money too and I stupidly forgot that until Tobiz mentioned it so shout out to him. 
---
Thank you for your reply I'll surely have a look in to it. 
---
selling a name for gp is not rwt. How fucking retarded are you?
---
How fucking simplified do you need it. You're nitpicking shit and using it in the wrong context to prove a poiint that's incorrect. 
---
&gt;ok selling accounts is fine then if you use GP, good to know theres loopholes in jagex's rules, its not RWT if its pixels for pixels, Infernal capes for all
---
No, selling accounts is against the rules. But trading gp for account would not be RWT
---
&gt;i guess its ok to to have people power level accounts for you for gp, because its pixels for pixels, hooray for RWT loopholes!.
---
No, those fall under a separate rules. Still not RWT. 
---
&gt;You're a mongoloid if you don't think people selling names on scythe aren't turning around and selling the gold for real life money, just as they're selling gold from infernal cape sales and powerleveling.
---
Doesn't matter what I think. innocent until proven guilty, motherfucker. If they rwt then congrats they rwt'd. You can't just claim that everyone that's sold a name has rwt'd the gp. 
---
Infernal capes and power leveling are against the rules, though.
---
&gt;Selling names, Capes, Accounts, Powerleveling for anything is RWT regardless, You're facilitating the trades for Real world money for ingame things, even if its indirectly, as weath said you can indirectly give someone your password and thats your fault.
---
All of those things are against the rules except for selling a name for in game currency. Which is NOT RWT you smooth brain retard fuck.
---
&gt;If you sell your name, you're a RWT'er and should be banned
---
False, how fucking 1 track is your mind.
---
&gt;where does it say buying names is against the rules? seems like you're just making shit up at this point
---
With gp, it's not.
---
&gt;Pick one, Name selling is RWT, its simple, if you do it you should be banned for RWT.
---
&gt;You can try to justify your cheating all you want, ill just keep responding.
---
No, it's not RWT. If you rwt the gold you got or sell the name for in game currency then it's rwt and you deserve to be banned. 
---
How's it cheating? Jesus you'll make up anything to prove a point you clearly can't even wrap your fucking head around. 
---
That‚Äôs 2 quarts and half a cup for the fellow Americans 
---

---
See, now this is a bad implication that a child having gay parents influences them to become gay, as well. This is simply not true.
---
what world is this?
---
trueee
---
So basically you took it unfairly or were hoarding names, and that's the only reason why they would do that. So yeah.
---
That thing isn't worth 150mil more like 30-40m is what it would be worth. Having in mind the only place where is truly is BIS it isn't worth the extra slot
---
look at the video again. There are two squares in the exact spot where the uim stops. The pker in the video runs through the two squares and you see the multi sign pop up. 
---
OBVIOUSLY if they were going to stage a kill on a hacked UIM they had to give a reason for him to be @ lava maze.
---
He had no food, same name format, the video has all the regular pking memes -- "IM SHAKING" "I CANT CUT WEB" "COME HELP". Bro.. even main in welfare was there to attack him after he got the kill to add suspense. 
---
Literally the first time I saw it I thought it was a joke but now I realize people think its real and it was made to be taken seriously. Are you really that easily fooled?
---
Hey, upvote J Cass's comment so people can see what really happened. Cheers.
---
I don't deny there's skill in pking, though I would strongly oppose the implication that PvMers lack the ability to posses that skill, instead I believe that since it's a skill they elect not to practice and refine, they don't particularly possess it. For the same reason most pvpers have 0 olm kc. I don't doubt most could learn raids, but most just haven't taken the time two. It's for these reasons I think the whole pk vs pvmers thing is nonsense. The above vice-versa comment was really just to trigger /u/schlamboozle, cause he was spewing nonsense all over this comment section.
---
But them being gay means their gay-dar is way better then most. Bold of you to assume I‚Äôm politically correct boi.

Guess if you're able to get saradomin brews from somewhere or anglerfish from somewhere you could be safe to. But I'll surely train my hitpoints up once I've made some money to actually get gear and all that from thieving probably.

Definetly going to do agility because as you mentioned the pyramid is pretty useful wen it comes to cash and because you're going to be running around a lot having agility is very neat indeed!

Thank you for your reply surely appreciated &lt;3 !

"Gay-dar" is a myth, and heavily relies on unsubstantiated assumptions based on typical stereotypical behavior.

You seem more upset than me, and farm runs for exp would just be tree runs and they didn‚Äôt add saplings to seed vault which is actually an oversite.. and if you are doing herbs for gp/hr there‚Äôs other methods for 10m+/hr that‚Äôs more efficient

You clearly thought the comment I made earlier (see: yikes) was his, and then when you realised you fucked up you tried to play it off that you were referencing his other comment (even though that doesn't really make any sense). Tbh I'm surprised you've not re-read these comments after calming down a bit and decided to delete them. I guess for those with a weak character it's easier to just believe you're right (even in the face of overwhelming evidence) than to eat crow.

in just wondering if i‚Äôm wasting time getting full graceful at 55 agil
---
I have 89 range and 99 mage but I do have rigour xD... Surely I can help a little :\[
---
The incentive is to train the skill actively to reduce the time needed to get to 99. Any passive skill should never be the best training method.
---
You have to level up more to around 90+ combat stats.Just slay and it‚Äôll breeze through plus you‚Äôll make money for gear along the way..assuming your p2p.
---
Its a series of unfortunate events. I got banned from the cc after I retreated in shame (based on an imgur link from pyro i saw earlier i understand the reasoning behind the ban now). When icame back to the cc, I was banned. Groupme was blocked, and I was so fed up that i didnt want to spend more time on it. I thought it'd blow over eventually. 
---
If it wasn't for Satirian's comment just now, which struck me as disarming and open, I probably wouldnt have taken the time to write it out. As for the talk, if you mean discord sure, shoot me a pm. Ingame is gonna be hard, as I quit some 7 months ago due to a lack of spare time.

She doesn't assign boss tasks unless you unlock bosses, so most tasks are really easy even for low levels if you don't have them unlocked.

I say keep it. It‚Äôs things like that for which people attack any and everyone in the wilderness, because sometimes people accidentally (or lazily) bring big loot into the wilderness.

The problem with this game is that you can just do tick-perfect agility runs and then there's nowhere to improve from there.
