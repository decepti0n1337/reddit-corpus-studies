Your wording is disingenuous. If removing 50% of the required clicks only improves the effiecent xp rates by a small amount, then the game is barely made easier. If you call everything that literally makes things easier ezscape, regardless of how much easier it makes those activies, then "ezscape" loses all value. It means nothing at that point. I can't fathom why you would want to click 50% more just for the sake of clicking more. That's not "playing the game more", it's just tedious.

Stats on the accounts?

---
Setup/walk through of the method? Much different from his old d2h vid?
---
I'm at 5ghz so I'm going to try changing that to 2.4 somehow, should be better for going through the floor apparently.
---
I'll try and run some of those other tests you mentioned as well. thanks for the response
---
He said it's a remembrance day for Australia/New Zealand for all those who died in WW1, and other wars.
---
Hmm good idea, thanks for the tip!
---
The top two UIMs are both ranked higher than every single HCIM that has ever been made. Insane lmao. I know the mode is two years older, but it's also like 3-4x slower...
---
Actually, HUGE support from me. This would let people "lock" in their pures.
---
hey you're not supposed to let ur health hit zero, that kills you
---
I would like to see it eventually added, but not as a skill. Also they gotta make sure the rewards are OP af again
---
Why did u even ask then if you're not gonna listen to advice?
---
You forgot the 3 or 4? other title games they have made billions on. Jagex doesn't have billions lol
---
not on somebody else's account
---
Woosh
---
I figure I'd notice in Battlefield or Apex if I was experiencing it this often. it's been a pretty consistent thing for the last couple days, and made training pretty unbearable. When I hop on other games its definitely not like this at all
---
Updates bad
---
I lost my hardcore status attempting my first squat.
---
&gt; Closer geographically = less latency and less chance for something along the highway that is the internet to Eff up
---
Depends how its routed and how many hops and shit it has to do but yeah.
---
LOOKIN AT YOU CHAOTICS!
---
Just remember 2.4 maxes out at 144meg which realistically you won‚Äôt pull anyways. It‚Äôs also way more susceptible to inference. Anything from Bluetooth ,microwaves, or neighbors could cause it. While the range on 2.4 is better you‚Äôre sacrificing speed and stability. Just a heads up. Also if you have ANYTHING in your house for some terrible reason still using 802.11b you‚Äôre in for a bad time.
---
Trick question, by definition if you're a trap, you're cute.
---
Mine was a Brazilian girl. We actually talked over MSN messenger using our web cams. We did quests and shit together and trained. Even scammed a few people together as a duo to make our banks better. She got into modeling and about a month into it she stopped logging into both MSN and RS. Considering this was Brazil and she kind of lived in a shit area, hoping nothing bad ever happened to her but documentaries of Brazil kind of cloud that bright thought. That was about 12 years ago.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt see much difference. Nice work, but this looks like a week of progress.
---
&gt;nylos are 9 hp
---

---
31 shards for 10 kills is very impressive too... I always get 1 per kill. You know the thrill get yourself some nice fire rune and nature rune and alch yourself please
---
Can't wield a dds without completing Lost City so that won't work :/
---
Agree, the thing i miss is that you need several skills to unlock all the rooms which was fun
---
Same thing happened to me man! Fucking bullshit.
---
maybe if they make 50-60k each. You ain't doing that shit on 40k total
---
d plate looks very nice in his defense
---
Yeah I think he should continue as a series until he gets TOB, stream the attempts, and make a series finale for when he finally gets his drop
---
Damn this would be so cool, also seeing as the base colours of BP are tanz themed already having it turn green with tanz mutagen so it goes with the green ranged theme would be cool to see. 
---
They said in the Q&amp;A that they had problems with this before cos they didn't have enough devs to dedicate time to QA test but it may be more viable now with them having a more extensive team now.
---
and the top
---
I can't get a router in this room with my living situation, so the advice is pointless lmao. I tried to state that multiple times, but apparently the English language is really fucking difficult for you lot
---
I think that would be 1/32k chance. 
---
Rate of getting one fang with one of Zulrahs drops is 1/256. So to get the second fang as well it's just 1/256 * 1/256 so 1/64k 
---
But there are two combinations of getting this drop so you divide by 2. You can get fang 1 and then fang 2 OR you can get fang 2 and then fang 1. They're both equivalent to us; we'd never know which order they came in since the items are identical. So divide by 2 and it's 1/32k.
---
Hello, thanks for [reposting my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6en6so/when_you_sacrificed_your_fire_cape_but/) from a year ago, without even changing the title.
---
I like to think if I did that I'd be smart enough in the moment to just log off asap, and then maybe go to a very low populated f2p world to get back.
---
fuck, my mild annoyance has now increased to serious concern, OP ARE YOU OK I CAN CROP YOUR PICS FOR YOU IF YOU WANT
---
My biggest complaint about people who don't support climate change is that, what is there to gain by saying it's not real? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Even if climate change itself isnt real, what's the downside of striving for clean air, clean water, clean energy? Not wanting any kind of change?
---
If you're arguing against it, youre just fighting for the gas companies, why would you do that?
---
I‚Äôd prefer it as an optional mini game. If you add it as a skill people feel they need to grind, it probably won‚Äôt pass.
---
this.
---
What kind of republican bullshit is this
---
Any change that makes things easier for people will be also be easier for bots.. how could you not grasp that lol
---
What an idiot, honestly
---
and also this.

Hahaha fuck trump üëç

I see, thanks for answering my question

I use fire surge over trident. Trident isn‚Äôt always the best

Me neither, but I'm reading this at the bar I've been sitting at for the past four hours.

If you can't take the heat stay out of the inferno
---
Usually they take issues with how they achieve that. A big problem with the Paris Climate accords was that it recognized China as a developing country and obligated the 1st world to pay them money. Also taxes.
---
its like 6.5k
---
Yeah but who cares about your opinion?
---
Merching elegant sets and flared pants
---
Bought most female ele sets for 300k and flared for 400-500k.
---
Wait for a few hours and resell them for 550k and 700k respectively.
---
I didn‚Äôt get extremely rich out of that but the little me at that time made enough to buy a dchain for 10m
---
You do realize that most people use teleports through their nexus portal right? Blood spells are pretty good, pking is dead. All the niche spells are useless bc there is other, more efficient methods that usually replace them.
---
Aaaah
---
And to think there's probably a level 3 bots out there with one.
---
That's one of my main reasons for swapping tbf. I have 15 pray so it would be a big help to be able to melee some tasks

Is this a troll? Are you implying mains don't cause item inflation?

Thanks a lot I will go and seebif i can find some people around to help me first and I will watch some guides on youtube to learn the fight

Super fast to do and you‚Äôll make bank on points. 90 at 50 and 270 at 100

/r/iamnotretarded
---
You get Xerican Robes as well which is probably the biggest thing after Slayer Helm and Addy Gloves (possibly even better than the gloves).
---
I would say to go to 15 defense though to get the Varrock Platebody 2. You gotta do some defense quests to do the diary. You get infinite mithril platebody equivalent armor from it. I'd imagine you only get like 1 extra combat level.
---
Petition to get God Ash on the show
---
10/10
---
I don't think you can do it even with 3rd party clients. The only one I know for sure you can is HAM, as there's an option specifically for that. In Runelite at least I haven't found any options to swap Talk with Pickpocket.
---
I guess if 90.5 compared to 92 crosses the line, good on it. Also remember that each skill's time to max is different, gated by the purely arbitrary exp/hour assigned to various training methods. (I'll point to 1tick cooking karambwans as a obvious example off the top of my head, as bringing tick manipulation can severely reduce times as well).
---
Could he setup an irl business for trading osrs gold?
---
Why would we want another big update?
---
Adding things just for the sake of adding things isn't a great idea IMO.
---
Have you perhaps checked your spam or made sure you are checking the correct email
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm honestly just trying to get all max combat skills so I can pvm anything and make gps. My long term goal is raids, for now I‚Äôm grinding for GW, know I can duo good enough now but jus wanna keep the grind up and get well rounded.
---
UNHIIINGE YOUR JAAAAWS
---
You should do an ama sometime.
---
That is a new one. Someone actually thinking burnt lobsters are rare
---
See how nice it is to get changes without this stupid polling system?
---
This wouldn't even have passed a poll because no one would have given a crap experience for a couple UIM.
---
Doing it with a kitten atm, it sucks lol.
---
Imagine playing ironfag mode in a mmo. Lmfao
---
I know how to EoC pvm.
---
However many hours someone else plays a game should not be anyone else‚Äôs concerns but the guy playing. If someone wants to no life the game then it shouldn‚Äôt mean a thing to you or anyone else lol dude got an insane amount of xp and set a record, that‚Äôs what ppl are celebrating.
---
I was drunk last night and found his post, scrolled through his post history and saw he‚Äôs like 12 and uses tinder to catfish weird looking guys. Weird fuckin kid.
---
It is begging
---
i‚Äôll probably do it long before i‚Äôm ready for inferno cause i want that music cape one day
---
Fuck kinda country you from where 12 year olds can drive?
---
It's both harder and different than legacy combat.
---
See you next tuesday
---
Where'd you get the shirt? I'd love to buy one of these.
---
I‚Äôm down. It would be fun if they made the bosses more hard since most are super easy
---
So essentially no more buying extreme rares in GE? If I was going to sell a tbow, scythe, ect, I'd do it outside of the GE if this was implemented because I'll be damned if the government gets 1% of my 1.2b. as a buyer this doesn't affect the market. But there is no reason to punish a seller because you can't get enough gold in the game you want to take everyone else's gold away because you lack said gold.
---
It's called a mirror.
---
Grats!! Must feel great! I have yet to get my own pet from skilling or otherwise other then cat lol.
---
Aaaaah
---
sorry buckaroo but if you beat recruitment drive you're gay
---
Other than skipping them, definitely try maging the. The kills will be MUCH faster. I'd recommend iban blast.
---
Cool, if you want a new skill you should consider trying RS3. They have tons of new content and skills to master. 
---
Most of us on the other hand, basing off the feedback from the warding blog, don‚Äôt want it as it ruins the atheistic of OSRS.  
---
I‚Äôll be voting no on my 10 accounts.
---
Tremendously crooked from the standpoint of RNG. Crazy Obama-era TzTok-Jad is a total loser! Nobody does fight caves like me folks, believe me. Look, having infernal‚Äîmy uncle was a great Ironman and PVMer and skiller, Dr. Trumpletics; good RNG, very good RNG, OK, very smart, 2277 total, very good, very smart‚Äîyou know, if you have a fire cape, if I were a noob, if, like, OK, if I fought Jad on my pure, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world‚Äîit‚Äôs true!‚Äîbut when you're a maxed main they try‚Äîoh, do they do a number‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I always start off: 1B bank, Ironman, went there, went there, did this, built a maxed house‚Äîyou know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we‚Äôre a little disadvantaged‚Äîbut you look at the infernal cape, the thing that really bothers me‚Äîit would have been so easy, and it‚Äôs not as important as xp is. Infernal cape is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right‚Äîwho would have thought?. But when you look at what's going on with the three Jads‚Äînow it used to be one, now it‚Äôs three‚Äîbut when it was one and even now, I would have said it's all in the prayer switching; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven‚Äôt figured that women don‚Äôt play RuneScape.
---
I got mine at like 54 mining at MLM.
---
Agreed, jars are long overdue for a update also.
---
Shit reason. The game should only have a new skill if the new skill will actually improve the overall quality of the game. Don't just add skills for the sake of adding skills.
---
Devalues ham joint /s
---
Obviously any of the f2p bosses, but barrows and the mole would easily be manageable. There are some other bosses that are very easy like the crazy and deranged archaeologist. I don't know about the other wilderness bosses because I've never killed them, but I imagine you could do them too.
---
Start by looking up a list of bosses, then you can start finding videos on methods for mid level stats. At 80-85 stats you can do most gwd bosses with a small team relatively easily, but 75 is a *bit* low, although still totally doable with the right gear and items.
---
Hey guys it's those funny numbers from the Internet!
---
Good guy. Keep playing your part, don‚Äôt let this shit pass.
---
Me big brain ü§ì
---
That's why it's a bigger change in DPS more room for accuracy to matter
---
ranarr
---
Dunno why someone downvoted you, this is a good point
---
yeah np. As someone who's kinda a noob who doesn't play as much, I actually finally had something to say on this thread
---
Man if Kq hit any harder she gunna stack u out her attacks too accurate. Also I‚Äôm all for giving those jars a better use. Maybe used on Abby whip n d bow aswell since people love cosmetics.
---
Gotta be that one prick with retribution on
---
36.6m hunter xp no chin pet btw
---
The original commenter compared the plague to playing a video game lol
---
Yeah, but it doesn't make sense to trade them until you are done doing slayer tasks. I think that's their point.
---
You looked better on the left now you look skinny fat with some breasts
---
Super out there question, but if one wanted a tbow  would practicing enough at solo raids with maxed stats and optimal gear and doing 25-30 min runs be a viable method of getting the bow?
---
An how do you know it won't do that? So much can be done in the future with this skill. This is only the beginning of the skill, future updates could enhance the quality of the game. People like yourself just don't like change.
---
 Mod Ash is a stud, I mean come on.
---
It will be called hard mode for a reason :-)
---
KQ will be a bitch to kill.
---
There are tons of trumpeters playing 07 scape it's insane.
---
&gt; Your entire defense is based on: 5% of runescape players who only use barrage so they can actually hit someone with a good weapon
---
no it wasn't, learn to read.
---
&gt; and yes most people have portals in their poh.
---
having a few portals isn't the same as having them all.
---
&gt; Nor did I say "absolute" efficiency, logically it makes sense to have portals for your poh because house tele tabs are 1 click instant teles...
---
not everyone plays the most efficient way either.
---
&gt; Once you get over 1k total level you will understand my point.
---
i'm over 1700 total and have been playing on and off since 2004.
---
And what happens when someone dies because the worlds are getting ddosed?
---
Im jelly lol
---
Slayermusiq is doing quick guides too now.
---
i agree but i'm shitposting here
---
This could be quite helpful. I have a direct connection to my isp provided modem/router with a 1gbps connection, and I get quite a few lag spikes. How do I go about running the ping tests at the same time, just two instances of command? How do I find the ip of the server I'm playing on?
---
I‚Äôm not going to entertain 9 year olds in this post anymore lol
---
what is wrong with you
---
Finally I get a reference
---
"Discussion" lol.
---
This guy
---
They need to do the ammo style info box for weapons that have charges, like BP, trident, toxic staff, etcc
---
it will though, they are trying way too hard. I'm still at a vote no but its def coming in due time.
---
I asked my female mother which she liked more and she said "stop been weird"

Looks like tits bro

Nice repost, make your own memes noob
---
You've only lost 13lbs between these 2 pics?
---
Looks like a way bigger difference
---
If you got max might as well keep doing it
---
Welcome, brother! I quit about 5 months ago and have logged on twice just to chop some trees and say what's up. It feels good man. This game is great, truly, but it is a waste of time at the end of the day. It isn't a waste for everybody, but it was for me. I want to do something with my life, and spending every waking hour of my day to smash some iron rocks is not where I see myself in the future. I want to be an academic, which isn't possible with runescape since I can't control my time well enough to play it responsibly. To those of you that just want to scape, more power to you! I'm not here to bring you down. This spiel is for those out there who, like me, get addicted to things too easily and end up missing out on the big picture. If you are like that just give it up, the game won't miss you my bro.
---
Ahh makes sense and valid point. Wasn‚Äôt trying to be all ‚Äúwell actually.‚Äù
---
Just wait till you need construction spicy stews
---
unfortunately I don't have the attack level for it yet... I'm a slacker lol
---
Tilou Tatey Ham
---
Just because no one is forcing you to use it doesn't mean it does not effect game integrity...
---
No time to even jerk off when you‚Äôre getting that much xp
---
Nothing. Brainlet efficiency scapers are usually deeply insecure IRL so they have to find meaningless ways to put other people down so they don‚Äôt end up necking themselves from depression
---
Thank you so much for taking the effort to calculate this. This is super interesting to see laid out, as I was on mobile in an airport and way too lazy to calculate it myself.  Firemaking is pretty much the worst case scenario as a skill that constantly changes xp rates as you level. Interesting that my original floor of 91 (I originally said 93 but I had a brain fart and meant 91) was wrong, but not by that much üòâ.
---
Ye but the tp would be a good meme
---
Yeah and 1/3 of America is obese and I have to be disgusted by seeing them with my eyes everyday, but they try to celebrate it. There are many behaviors that are far less healthy than no lifing a video game that are not only accepted but glorified by our culture. At least he's not ruining anyone else's life by wasting his own playing a video game, besides possibly his parents because he's most likely a NEET.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Scrap Warding, that is my suggestion.
---
It would pass to me as a viable minigame.

Im against using dharoks cus I don't want to keep repairing the armor and don't wanna use the rock cake method cus I'm trying to be as afk as possible.

Currently I'm 95 att 95 str and 90 def with a bring(I), torture, bandos chest plate and tassys, dragon boots and defender, Regen bracelet and berserker helm (too busy to quest). 
---
Buying the abyssal dagger for str training isn't a bad idea but currently can't afford it. So do you think is better to use obby set and do one skill at a time or use my current armor get my def to 95 and do the share XP method
---
If he is doing it only for a week, who really gives a shit, sure he is going a bit too hard, but in the grand scheme of things, this isn‚Äôt too bad. If he was playing like this for prolonged times, it‚Äôs pretty bad.

If one charge is 1 death, chaos, 1 scale, and 5 fires. you really cant figure out what:
---
20,000 x 1 chaos = ?
---
20,000 x 1 death = ?
---
20,000 x 1 scale = ?

20,000 x 5 fire = ?

Nah, lets go conspiracy mode - OP's friend is trying the old "I got scammed, give me some more gold?" on him
---
Imo if I can‚Äôt readily get the skill in a day or two (quests, couple levels, or fast xp skill) I drop it because odds are you will get another one or get burnt out on a grind you don‚Äôt want to do and isn‚Äôt worth it outside of the clue step. I‚Äôd say drop it if you‚Äôre at 61 woodcutting

&gt;" I also want to point out that people exist who could play this game 100 hours a week, every week, for a year and probably make dozens of times more money than you do in salary too. Why are you discounting what other people do? Wow! You go to work 5-6 days a week and probably make 30k a year, exciting! You're such an outlier in society, very special and unique! "  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Are you on the spectrum? At an average of 3m/hr, which is on the higher end of profit in RS, they're making $300 a week for 100 hours. That's 14 hours and 20 minutes of play time a day every single day to make what most adults do in 16h. Being able to no life RS has no translatable skills to IRL and you're incredibly naive to think that it is remotely profitable. Streamers are the only ones making relative bank off this game and even then you'd make more with any office job than an OSRS streamer makes.
---
I always go onto my friends list to check what world I am in if I‚Äôm risking

For range he raises his front legs and stomps. For mage he keeps his front legs down and stays standing.

This helped me tell the difference. Focusing more on what hes doing with his legs rather than just the stand/stomp animation.

About how much time is in between these pics? Curious so I can motivate myself by saying "it's only x number of months for that much progress" to myself.
---
Yes, records are counted as exp gains on a single account.
---
Not every skill is firemaking. There are a lot of skills where you unlock the best XP method very early on. You picked a skill where the level 90 xp rate is 10x the 1-15. Pick a skill like smithing, runecrafting, woodcutting, woodcutting, prayer, construction, and others. The half way point for those skills is basically 92.
---
Give that man a gnome

Quests then plant oak, willow wood trees, and then fruit trees

Nice

Can we give a small buff to the treasonous, tyrannical and warrior rings (similar to the buff that was given to the seers ring)? I think the Berserker ring shouldn't necessarily be the BIS melee ring for every situation.
---
never seen this before haha cool
---
Good old fast Eddie is going to make sure of that
---
Doesn't that mean twice a week, though? I wondered at that in the vid...
---
So cringy to post after you were exposed for lying.
---
If he uses 1 of those shit free ones yeah, I've played on VPN for years without having an issue.
---
You can do the same with Zeah runecrafting too but it slows your effective xp down so much. You'd have to do like 4-5 weeks of 0 RC xp runecrafting and then 1 week of high runecrafting xp
---
*continues playing*

This was posted by a legit player months ago when mobile was released you karma farming son of a bitch.

and that is the problem. we need to stop depending on ads and move on to relying on donations and individual pledges instead. the quality of the content would increase, and viewers wouldn't have to get brainwashed by companies wanting to make a profit.

Fuck that quest line, honestly. Was all a nightmare.

Think there's a difference between a max main being able to make money than some guy who looks like he doesn't even know what he's doing. it's a common symptom, play enough and stop white knighting dudes on reddit.

thats not a yes or no. clearly almost nobody gives a shit about what you just said.
---
I see on streams and on youtube where people have items in their bank and there's a red circle with a line going through the circle on the items they aren't using to grind. I'm guessing that's a Runelite feature but where can I find/enable it?
---
Pets are like bottom of my list after all else is done, just because may as well at that point
---
ive had all those unlocked thats original client text in the chat box.
---
I switch my brightness frequently. 
---
When bossing or high lvl pvm, I use 100%.
---
When skilling or anything chill, I use 25%.
---
Higher = easier to see the small things.
---
Lower = better looking fashionscape.
---
anybody have that ugthanki meme "if it aint ugthanki then no thanki"

it literally filled the entire scroll of the chatbox. it wasnt runelite

I mean if you wanna max mining quickly and you're paying enough attention to mine iron, just go 3t granite. almost 2x the xp rate
---
Fun game, just don't get too addicted
---
I simply stream the hardcore ironman nowadays and just hoping that will prosper because staking obviously isn't going to!
---
Its a new runelite feature that probably bugged out. That isn't an official feature...
---
well deserved
---
btw his name is cammy the camel

Could they make something that could detect a fairly new account that suddenly has hundreds of viewers and automatically disable the stream?
---
Tf u talking bout
---
No nerf, probably just RNG, unless you're on a different account with lower stats? 
---
Yes you have to get at least 500 points for a roll for the pet
---
Haha me like too

WoW has run longer and is still considered a good MMO. Runescape is very laidback in comparison imo so I enjoy it more, even 12 years later.

That would be amazing

More like the blowpipe spec

Seriously, just saw about half a dozen people actually DEFENDING giving them money as it is "just gambling, bro" even after losing millions. It is freaking painful to watch such stupidity. Is this natural selection?
---
Location is key. 100k in some parts of the US is a very nice sum of money, but in some cities on the west coast, and where I reside, that's pretty much average.
---
Your an Ironman. They don‚Äôt sell

Strange. I was thinking this today
---
Coco its a 3tic 1 handed weapon that doesnt give negative stats. The tic counter on lzyrdlite is just a bug and it is BiS nylos room as its so fast and can 1 shot 9hp nylos

thank you, I will try this

Karma farming, to sell the accounts (probably).

Or to use for item manipulation posts.

Did you provide them with a new email address?
---
they werent needed so I drop traded.

thx for keeping the game free
---
Bro
---
Hey bud. Don't stress about it too much :) it's never too late. Yes it'll take time to learn, but I have great osrs friends who just started playing in the past year. 
---
The game itself isn't as old as you think. It's a reboot of the 2007 game engine released at the start of 2013 due to the request of players who wanted the game returned to its golden years. There was a major update that changed the game entirely (what is now called rs3) and a large portion of the player base stopped playing including myself. The update was called the evolution of combat if you're interested in knowing.
---
Try not to get anxious, the game is huge and it takes time to learn, but there is a whole wiki dedicated to the game which answers everything you'd ever need to know. Also most players in this game are more than happy to help new players out if you ask in game. 
---
Good luck in your adventure friend

OP is implying he is paying a Venezuelan to login to his account and power level Agility for him

Why wouldn't anyone do it? I beg to differ. If it had good rewards and balanced and well thought out, it be very fun to play imo. To say no one would do it, is false.

you said mobile was being laggy. Maybe the items are there but the slow connection was causing the items to not actually show? I'm not sure how many times you checked or if u checked on a pc but if you only checked while using mobile id try again with a better connection
---
Na dude, it's all relative isn't it?
---
Rich people / 'good players' usually occupy the limelight, for someone who doesn't play that much or is fairly new, this is huge!

Took me months and months to get 17m to buy a green mask back in the day.

Preventing people from creating accounts that start with OldSchoolRS_ would be a start, but not a permanent fix.

Ok picture this: you're doing solo zammy on task and you keep getting potato drops but you're full hp.
---
You don't want to waste the potatoes so you 1tick 4way switch into jester and drop them then switch back into your combat gear. 
---
The potatoes stay on the ground til after the kill!
---
Does earning money ever get faster on these grinds to purchase items like the twisted bow? Or is it just as slow as earning this first 10 mil until you reach 1200M though?
---
Quickly pray flicking the last 5 kills is probably going to get you back to fapping quicker than making sure you don't die or banking and coming back.
---
1. Was your authenticator removed?
---
2. Was your password changed?
---
3. Was your registered email changed?
---
4. Any suspicious login attempts on your registered email?
---
5. Did you have a bankpin?
---
He understands what you're saying the issue is your stats are wrong. The whole terminology of dry is wrong because people misunderstand statistics 
---
If you have a 1/100 chance and do something 100 times. You statistically only had a 65% odd chance of getting it in those 100 tries. When people say "I've killed X 1000 times I should have got the 1 in 1000 item" they're not only obviously wrong due to rng, but also wrong from how odds actually work. 
---
I won't be able to explain it best but it's called the Bernoulli process.
---
The chance of not getting the thing in one go is 99%, times 0.99 by itself is 0.366 (36.6%) chance of NOT getting a 1/100 after 100 goes. Or a 63.6% chance of getting it.
---
Hope you get it back
---
I'd agree but the official client is dog shit, I'll frequently get the not responding bullshit occasionally meanwhile never had that problem on RL or OSB
---
On a serious note I might end up moving countries and because of the ping difference from where I live now, I may be able to finally attempt the inferno.  Should I wait a few months before going for it? Whats a safe period to wait before attempting
---
I completely disagree and feel the exact opposite way as you but that's okay. I think Sean Evans is annoying and very off-putting at times whereas it's at least when Nardwuar is annoying it's because he wants to be.

---
One of the weirder quest. If you have other stuff to train/unlock, do that first. Having a house with all teles/fairy ring/spirit trees/jewlleries or whatever you can get helps speed up the quest.
---
......still a weird quest.....
---
its fine I got it to work. It was a problem with my authenticator. thanks anyway
---
Oh wow beginner clues have bad rewards? Nice discovery man nobody knew or anticipated this!

Congrats! Just got my first mil as a f2p, I'm stoked too!

I have just had 120-130 trolls as a task. I did not set a timer, but banking travelling to the ice trolls on jatiszo and killing them took about 15 minutes in total with a cannon.

It is probably one of the fastest slayer xp in the game, together with dagannoths.

Nice fishing net ornament kit (or)
---
Explain the god Swampletics
---
Eh, I disagree honestly. If someone is younger and getting into the game that doesn‚Äôt know better, them losing their account and/or valuables on the account because of curiosity would be a big deterrent for returning to the game. 
---
I also think it supports RWT in a way because I‚Äôve heard and spoken to many people who have gotten hacked, then saying, fuck it, I don‚Äôt want to spend a month to get back to where they were, and buying 10, 15, or 50m because they feel like it‚Äôs fair for their situation.
---
For fast slayer points just camp death plateau, no good money, but you use little supplies so you still do make SOME profit only its minimal.
---
i was in the same boat as you with 66 wc. imo it is only worth it to grind it out if you dont plan to do any activities inbetween that could result in another master
---
Hey! Congrats! Little over 3m more at the time of writing and you're good for a bond!
---
1. The last time I was able to get on the account the authenticator was still on.   
---
2. Yes  
---
3. No  
---
4. No  
---
5. Yes

thats like a 600 gold beginner clue. thats actually pretty good, considering.

I played in Hong Kong on Australian worlds for a while. There was a delay of 1 or 2 ticks, so I wouldn't suggest to do intensive content.

His steps are actually the longest if you account for the time you take to train the skills
---
You can always attack the superior and  leave the normal garg half hp or w/e.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, as much as I love osrs it's still nowhere near as popular as WoW.
---
So he is a Skinny?
---
I used black dhide, helm of neitiznot, barrows gloves, salve (ei), granite ring, d boots, and toxic blowpipe. Adamant darts and I still had like 8 sharks left. It‚Äôs a real budget setup but it worked I guess. I hear void is the ideal armor set. For final boss everything was the same except I used a fury and rune cbow with anti dragon shield. Ruby and diamond bolts. That one actually came down to the wire; completely ran out of food as I killed him after maybe 15 tries. I‚Äôd imagine it will be much easier for you, especially if you dont cheap out on gear as much as I did lol. Good luck :)

You are such a fucking prick

Live-stream moment of gameplay, making sure to show yourself entering passwords and bank pins so anyone can verify
---
I got one of the new rare items today on my first easy clue since the update as well. The ham weapon thing. Apparently it's really strong for 1 attack pures, since even though it has no bonus it's the only one handed weapon in the game that as a 3 tick attack so it's selling for like 5m. Am a BTW tho so i'll just keep it for fashionscape.
---
Sorry to hear that. Now go take a shower!
---
Not laughable at all.  First green cash stack for anyone is an amazing accomplishment.
---
Holy shit mate 202 marks :O im jelly fuck the cash :D
---
Hey man this is my goal too after coming from rs3, managed to get 100qp so far, how much time were you able to play? I normally get a couple hours a night in, just wondering a rough timeframe!
---
&gt;Pick a skill like smithing
---
You want to claim that the halfway point of smithing, which unlocks it's fastest leveling method at level 40, is level 92?
---
i actually like both games, but i like the rs3 community more, 07 community is cancer mixed with aids bundled in swamp juices

&gt; Holy shit mate 202 marks :O im jelly fuck the cash :D

Would have had about a hundred-fifty more had I not cashed out a few levels ago

Simply playing for 10-12 hours a day wouldn't be enough to send a false botting flag or else all of the top few thousand maxed accounts would be banned.

Ah yes, the economy of trades in action

Not to mention those marks of grace!

people like you are why begging is still such a fucking problem in this game

Woah. You just changed my life.

That's helpful and all, but they can add a home world too.

What are you using customer support for? Chances are whatever assistance you need is one that they cannot provide

I'm fairly sure they implemented it but only for the bank interface

What game is this?

Pls dont do this

I think he means that they get in the way of clicks when you have to run from its orb attacks
---
First to come, last to go. For me it's my love handles. I just can't shake them.
---
The earlier you unlock the best method, the more likely it is the half way point in time is roughly equal to the half way point in exp
---
Is it a requirement to be severally mentally ill to be maxed or does it just help?
---
I tried googling for modern shows/movies where you have bad guy endings like this that aren't ambiguous and idk if people just suck at making lists but I couldn't find any popular media from the west in this century that actually gave the bad guy the win, but I see tons of anime where they do.
---
Well then just don't take those into account and you're fine

ye thatd be worse i reckon.

What do you think an ideal project looks like?

I fucking fell for it. "O shit double xp? Must be because of holiday" clicked on link, realized and closed browser before page loaded. Did a scan and found nothing but changed password and put up an authenticator. Im not good with computers but I am ashamed of myself for falling for this.
---
Never seen this much scamming in a game before, and it scares me as a new player

You prey on young Vokraths and come here to brag? That's just sick.

Yeah being able to actually check off what you‚Äôve done with the wiki quick guides are super handy.

It is literally mathematically impossible for a buyer and seller to split the price of an item because of taxes if that tax is only 1%.

This project should undoubtedly interest both investors and ordinary consumers. Thoughtful and clear ideas make it really attractive. I recommend to everyone.
---
ya by taking literally one guy‚Äôs suggestion and adding it without a problem, just when you thought making a post on here was the meta for suggestions, turns out DMing mods is better.
---
Yeah I don't get why they haven't done that, no legit streamer is going to suddenly get 2k viewers out of nowhere on a fresh twitch account. Not to mention, having their chat in sub-only mode while having no subscribers because they're not even a twitch partner

Deep mismanagement since RS' inception. Jagex is not an efficient or well-run business, they just made a great game and got an immense windfall which has kept them afloat.

I‚Äôm at sand crabs
---
That's not how it works. A server can drop upload rates causing people further away from the server to lag out while people closer to the server have no issue. It's not a black and white issue. People further away can DC from the server *because of the server*, while people closer to the server play with no problem.

Yet you thought your internet speed was related to your connection to the server and are unable to recognize that you disconnecting from the servers everyday is on you and not the game.

If you have access to fossil island, go to the ammonite crabs. More hp and way less populated than sand crabs (vast majority of pures dont unlock fossil island). If no fossil island access, go sand crabs. 
---
Sand crabs are just better rock crabs (more hp). 
---
And no not really. I mean you could quest and get like base 50s from it but Ppl like crabs because they don't hit anything, and you can completely afk them for 10mins before resetting aggro. So they have that appeal to them. Only other super afk place would be bandits in desert but that requires ppots. Other training spots aren't afk.

The point wasn't that any movies which follow that series of events is intrinsically bad, rather that the Marvel movies are hollow Disney products aimed at raking in as much money as possible over any innovation in story telling or character building. If you enjoy the movies that's fine since they are some of the most popular movies of all time; however, in the same way you'd struggle in arguing a Katy Perry or any other corporate money-grab product in the music industry are the epitome of good writing, trying to claim a movie equivalent is anything more than a hollow product created entirely around marketability is somewhat inane.

Smh people still don't use Runelite that offers the ability to choose a home world...

rock crabs for cannoning or if you dont want to compete for sand crabs.

otherwise sand crabs are better for training as they have more hp

That is your interpretation dude. I knew it was a bad word but not that it was considered so offensive (like in the US it is like the worst you can say) in some countries. But yeah, go ahead and call me a racist. I never said i hated black people or whatso ever^^.

Well ya could get some ok gear and work on getting higher slayer levels for the better gp tasks. Maybe grab a trident of the swamp with a book of darkness, a whip and a rune crossbow with broad bolts and try out barrows. Umm you could get 99 cooking as you make a little money from that. 99 firemaking from wintertodt isn‚Äôt a bad idea either. I can‚Äôt remember how much I made from cooking but 99 firemaking made me about 15m.
---
Dayum, do this for 2-3 weeks at a more moderate pace from a fresh account handing in void points to get 1-99 strength, then starting this. And bam, you have the 200m month record forever. Thats nutty.
---
It‚Äôs not wrong to express these respects in game. It‚Äôs ironic after reading the responses to the Pride event from a few years ago. A big part of Pride is celebrating open sexuality, including gayness, and the people who died because they were gay. People who were ostracized by their families and communities for the longest time. Most of them died on the basis of who they were.  
---
When something like this picture happens, it‚Äôs an online community coming together wholesomely, and that‚Äôs great. But when something like the Pride event happened, I don‚Äôt know what to call it.

Well, my friend got the pet from motherlode at lvl 52, hope that makes you feel better o.O

Is the one on the right your sister?

I started playing again when I was living in China. It was pretty easy. Mobile was a paint to download but i had zero problem on pc. I even played on my work desktop computer. I lived in Guangzhou, had a vpn for a lot of things but didnt need it for RS.
---
Congrats! What ended up working for you?
---
don't tell settled, you'll end up hearing him all the way from morytania
---
Quested fremy helm instead of buying dfh this is clearly a beta in denial
---
You're really missing the mark with your savagery
---
Yeah i have a few of those in the clan. Afk stuff while at work

Do you only have to sacrifice one for unlimited attempts?

The world should be fine, there were no issues when Woox &amp; co got the first ToB kc in the game

Why isn‚Äôt it wearing gucci

I assume you have a staff of fire with you already no?

It's called a permenant mute for a reason. It's a punishment for being racist, you need to accept it. You need to build your skills back up and cba? Tough shit.... That's part of the punishment. Play muted or start again. Changed or not, you fucked up, man up and move on
---
Genuinely asking, what the fuck is the point in this? Bragging that you got the most X exp in Y time frame is the lamest shit I've ever heard.
---
why did you black out everything? I understand why you blacked out your username, but why all the other numbers?
---
I doubt anyone cares how many darts you have in your inv...
---
Right? I don't understand how it even got the upvotes that it did. I assume people are either horribly gullible, or they just upvote and scroll on. I'm too grouchy and cynical for that shiznit.

Stack of karamwanjis work too

Doing a quick ge visit in bandos which isn't even that much you get at least one lurer/scammed try to rope you in every time

Whoosh

so go back and fetch it?

Oh you think you deserve something? HA that‚Äôs cute

There is a book called "Collection log''

Lol
---
Yeah it's so dumb. Honestly makes you wonder who's out there trying to anti scam with a t bow.
---
I think 90 + str and range is good enough and if you are on task you should use slayer helm otherwise use void setup with blowpipe and saradomin sword
---
Can we talk about those schnozzes. I feel like they can smell me through the internet

I mentioned Japan because when I was moving here I thought my account was going to get locked for making such a large geographical change from the US. I'm not saying the two are alike in anyway

Welcome, I hope you can play TE
---
Yeah I'd invite my friends to crash this guy until he left.
---
If you're still doing this lmk and I'd be happy to crash, if you want to remain anonymous I also get that. I have about 3.5 hours before my lunch break and I spend my morning crafting and anti-crashing for any of my friends, but I can make an exception if someone is especially cunty
---
Unpopular opinions are supposed to be unpopular.

Get good.   
---
For real tho, it's pretty impossible to get in to unless you are willing to put in 100s of hours and mills in it since ppl who are doing it have been daily for years.
---
Noo, noobs asking for 5k is part of the game.
---
False

And maybe we can seperate races by worlds and not let certain races drink from water fountains

Who is that?

Nice  (  Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Drastic is right. I think it‚Äôs unarguable that bots are a much higher priority than lazy newbs. You can always turn public off, ignore, or inform them. Suggest ways they can make money without begging. If you‚Äôre bothered by their begging being successful, like rewarding the lazy, you‚Äôd be as well off to argue the people handing things out should receive a ban as well.
---
Makes sense RoT members need a plug-in for zulrah.
---
The branches here in the Philippines haven't closed, even my small hometown that has a 2 small Toys R Us are still open after more than a decade.
---
Beggars are like black mold, block one of them and a thousand more are ready for you to block, and i shouldn't have to disable chat completely and also block off legitimate messages just to get rid of beggars, that defeats the purpose of having a chat to begin with, that's just a blanket fix.
---
250g of protein is way over what's needed lmao
---
Don't say that.  I'm at 5200kc and deserve that little bastard.

They should
---
Nope unless it's not allowed anywhere you can pvm also so basically only allow it at the GE
---
Yes. Most likely, in fact. I've seen almost the exact same thing happen myself. 
---
Hilariously, the sub you linked is full of actually very plausible occurrences lmao. It's such a joke.
---
Yeah don‚Äôt get me wrong I have thought about this the people that hang around grand exchange have been doing it for years, and I‚Äôm willing to lose which I have over and over till I git good,
---
Funny enough I continued on yesterday and managed to get 2 kills against people who loiter around there which made me feel really proud about it, and I can tell I‚Äôm getting better!
---
Thanks
---
P.S getting those kills were the funnest things I‚Äôve ever done on this game even though I‚Äôm 50m down haha
---
I remember my first green stack, anout half a year ago, never got it that high since
---
Someone has to pick them for others to be able to put them into sacks. 
---
It‚Äôs truly a noble profession.
---
Sure it doesn't, if you're only doing gmaul in BH. PvP is way more than just BH. Dharoks, main pking, anyone with sara brews really, bridding. PvM, any boss where sara brews are required. It takes way more attention than the fucking puzzle.

At the end of your searches*

Max cash is meh on an ultimate. Id set a goal like achievement diaries or end game pvm.
---
86 range using BP with addy darts. Eagle eye, salve ei and archer(I). Using BGS spec at beginning of fight. Should I continue to use void (melee and range) for vorkath or would full blessed d hide be more efficient? Averaging around 2:50-3:45 kill times
---
It is possible, however you really should be using your clues when you get them. You don't increase your chance of getting the elite by holding onto the other ones, you just are missing out on tonnes of clue nests while going for the elite.

Getting lured would be heartbreaking

Guy's I decided to pay some Venezuelan kid $4 to train my agility for 15 hours a day. How do I make sure jagerx knows it's really me and not some gold farmer on my account?

Yeah, and 92 is 37.5 xp off of halfway to 99
---
Zezima
---
Most people of high skill can compete against each other, at the end off the day it all comes down to RNG and luck.
---
jagex can‚Äôt tell what plug-ins you‚Äôre using btw unless they‚Äôre directly interacting with and/or ‚Äúplaying‚Äù the game, so no, they‚Äôd have no idea you were using a helper for zulrah lol
---
If you say that, I'll say this. It will be really funny trust me!
---
And people in the cinema cream their pants because of this.
---
Kinda monotonous to block like 25+ people on a daily basis and having to re-block new beggars every single day because there's bots dedicated to doing it and jagex doesn't ban them because they don't look for text spam relating to begging.
---
definitely ice trolls, it's one of those ones where you can use a cannon and recoup or profit a little and it's really quick

&gt; Making Money
---
If you're F2P, most methods will be slow/take time to make meaningful money. Best ways are usually gathering skills like Fishing/Mining/Woodcutting.
---
If you're P2P, then there's tons of stuff to do. Best passive (not much time spent, but over a long time) ways are Herb Runs, Daily Battlestaves and Kingdom of Miscellenia.
---
&gt; 2007 RS2 compared to OSRS
---
Realistically, a fair bit has changed. Most of the more "efficient" ways to play for GP/XP didn't exist in 2007. In terms of actual playing experience, it's still fairly similar and doesn't feel like "the same old game", rather, it feels refreshed.
---
And I am telling you that a normal player grinding for the T bow is doing the same thing..you are wasting your own time and mental energy by being concerned about this.
---
tumbleweed
---
Doing a 9-5 is like runecrafting. It fucking sucks, but it‚Äôs great for your cashstack and the perks you get from the achievements late down the line are just awesome to have.

You cant say selling wolfbone arrowtips is a money maker. No one buys these things so their price is highly inflated. Fletch about 100 arrowtips and proceed to wait 3 weeks for them to sell.
---
Any evidence that he died?
---
Well if you take Infinity War as a standalone movie, that's exactly what happens and it was extremely satisfying.
---
Possible unintended side effect that may have already been mentioned: when it comes to high alchemy, having a 1% tax might possibly really mess with alching as a money maker/mage trainer given how most alchables fluctuate to cost about a nature rune's less than the alch value. Whether messing with alchers is good or not, I don't know. People getting alchables in slayer and smithing probably would take a hit as well because of alchables that have a high price yet low margin like battlestaves, mystic staves, mystic robe top/bottoms, most rune gear, etc...  would all drop in price and especially for higher cost gear that gets alched like dragon equipment. I'm not an economist but i bet the tax would screw with alchers in some way.
---
In hindsight I realize that alot of alchers just buy and alch rune in f2p from smithers directly, I think there's an unofficial world for it, so I guess I have no idea then. but keeping in mind the small high alch margins is probably a good idea
---
which world i wanna come hang out with him
---
Bots i understand banning but banning a non-bot player for begging is ridiculous and even more ridiculous to ban someone who gives them anything. A player can play how they want. If they want to ask people for stuff then they are fully aloud to, same with people giving them stuff. The only arguement you have is that they don't play the way YOU want which isnt a strong arguement at all.
---
red spiders in stronghold maybe
---
This is why I don't understand his point.  It takes so much more time and effort for an ironman to get to the point of, in his example, grinding for a t bow compared to a normal account which further minimizes the 'problem' he is complaining about.
---
You know damn well there's no girls in f2p cuz we don't have to do that one quest lol
---
If the video is correct and running ahead of you, I don't really understand the difference between that and reading a few lines ahead. I really feel like the vast majority of the time I'm wasting almost 0 time with a quest, and only wasting time to my own error.
---
No, delete now..
---
Wonder how the game would look without bots, sadly it's one of those things that will never go away.

If you really want the pet, you should just go for as many points as possible, fletching all the logs you can.

How does a big streamer not have better internet
---
I am writing from Japan, I got instantly locked upon log in and had to reset my pas5word. After that and a few recovery things I was able to log in from my account as per normal
---
So for vorkath, I had the same set up here (red d'hide, archer's helm, barrows gloves, snakeskin boots), but also has an elemental shield and a salve amulet. 
---
I used four prayer pots, one super antifire, one bastion potion, and one anti venom +. Also had runes for crumble undead, and diamond bolts (e).  The rest of my inventory was filled with mantas. Probably would be better to go with brews and restores but I needed that quick healing to keep attacking.
---
Think it's hilarious people want to make it so if you want to remove an authenticator it takes days. I have like 8 things on this authenticator and if I can't get in I want to remove it right away. It's like losing your keys and having to wait 3 days to get into your house so they can verify it's you, even though you just showed them proof.
---
You don't really have any knowledge on programming so i don't really think you are credible at all with what you say related to implementation of code.

Hi, new member here. I dont totally understand how Favour on Great Kourend works. Do i need to get 100% on each house one at a time, or is partial favour locked in? Appreciate the help
---
I think it's completely fair for it to be removed and idk how you could possibly be complaining about this lmao
---
Yeet.
---
Wouldn't this imply customer service exists?
---
So much wrong with this
---
How can you go above 100%.. you cant even REACH 100% as its never a given that you will get the iten, even after a billion attempts its still 99.9repeating. 
---
I suggest that being dry is a scale, going from 0-100. Starting at 50% chance, which for a 1/3k droprate is at like 2100 kc where you just started to be very slighlty dry, to 40k kc where you are like 1 in a million, which would be insanely dry.

Yeah, Ruby bolts (e) are definitely your go to, as well as diamond (e) after he's less than 30%

Why not just allow pmods to temp mute particularly obnoxious beggars? I heard jagex is recruiting a couple hundred more pmods. I dont think someone should be banned over it, but there is a line that can be crossed into obnoxious or outright spam with begging. And a possible temp mute I think is fair with no further repercussions.
---
Ehh. It is what it is. Just noticed it and was like ‚Äú damn, this dude can‚Äôt catch a break.‚Äù
---
Wow, it's almost like Reddit is just an echo chamber and people will complain all day because it's popular to do so for e-points that mean nothing.
---
Working there is not very accessible unless you know/want to know Japanese.
---
This is only unpopular among beggars. I'm sure the majority of the people actually playing the game and earning their money agree with this lol. Nothing is more annoying than that one kid in the cc who is literally always begging.
---
Yikes

Dont be a racist, toxic, dickhead. Fuck you.

Right so using bernoulli trials to reach a point where you have a greater than 100% chance is clearly an idiotic way of defining going dry, as evidenced by you. You're claiming that if you're 100,000kc without a zulrah unique, you're still not dry, but obviously everyone who plays this game would call that dry.
---
So the statistically relevant definition that fits being "dry" is having an expected value of more than 1 drop, but not having a drop. Conveniently, that occurs right when you cross the drop rate, making it an intuitive and statistically supported method for defining being dry.
---
People don't misunderstand statistics, you're just caught up in 10th grade math thinking everybody doesn't understand bernoulli trials when no one is concerned with them anyway.
---
Its fucking incredible that you thought you could post this and have people empathize with you.
---

you used to lose favor in the other houses if you didnt lock it in at 100%
---
they changed it a few updates ago do you dont lose favor when you gain it in other houses
---
You should have asked that question instead of the stupid as fuck wording you used. The other person answered exactly the question your stupid ass asked, they don't deserve "thanks for nothing" you juvenile imbecile.
---
Even when I trained fletching to 99 at the GE I didn't see many beggars. I blocked maybe at most 5 a day and that's with a long play session of like 6 hours. I guess I'm playing a different game, but I'd much rather jagex ban all the actual bots spamming websites constantly at the GE and spamming that stupid dice rolling scam and various other scams. I did fill up my ignore list with bots, but never beggars. I've never seen beggars as a problem and it would only hurt the community to start policing if you are allowed to beg. Begging can technically be considered roleplaying or just a shitty way to make money. I think beggars add to the atmosphere of the every mmo. It's like the scammers in Eve online. They are part of nature lol
---
I gave my vorkath advice in another comment, but for Galvek I used this armor (red dhide, barrow gloves, snakeskin boots, glory amulet, archer's helm, ring of wealth [for quick teleport in case] .
---
My inventory was diamond bolts (used ruby until 150 health), two mantas, one stamina pot, one extended antifire pot, one prayer pot, 6 super restores, and the rest were brews. 
---
For phase 1 I used protect from magic, and phase 3 I used protect from ranged. Phase 2 I usually stuck with protect from ranged since it seemed 50/50 on if he would use his ranged attack or magic attack. Phase 4 I went back to protect from magic. 
---
The mantas saved me from where I needed that fast big boost of health, and the stamina was helpful for me in phase 2 and 3 when energy was low and needed to avoid the one hit KO attacks. 
---
Other than needing a last minute escape, I preferred walking. The biggest advice I can give since a lot seemed to be RNG is walk and don't panic. 
---
Not sure how much this helps but it is what worked for me.
---
Trolls

you used to lose favor for getting favor in a second house before the first was "locked in" at 100% but they removed it!

do it in any order in any amounts and youll be fine

Other games refer to the combination of melee combat and prayers as "paladin." The game even gives you a prayer bonus for using a bludgeon weapon.

Took me forever to read that all lol.

If you weren't 14, you might see the irony in:

It's definitely a shell of the game it was.
---
Lol just wait till our polls start getting rigged now that polls are hidden. You ain‚Äôt seen anything yet
---
That‚Äôs not true. Accuracy only determined your chance of hitting in the first place.
---
When you attack, 2 numbers are rolled. The first is to determine whether or not you even hit (Attack and accuracy bonuses).
---
The 2nd determines how high you hit. This can range from 0-your max his (strength and strength bonus). Every single one of these outcomes has an equal chance of occurring, and having a higher accuracy does **not** weigh your damage roll on the higher end.
---
You're literally asking for transmogs..

This is actually an order of magnitude larger than (1/512)^2. How do I know when to use probability mass function instead of multiplying the individual probability of each roll? So for example, to calculate the probability of two coin flips on heads as a probability mass as well?
---
Thanks Peter, I'm still weirded out.

There's new rooftop agility courses, these have a random chance of giving marks of grace, which can be exchanged for (among other things) the graceful set. Graceful reduces your weight and increases your run energy more quickly.

Wintertodt is a Skilling boss that gives good firemaking XP along with pretty decent rewards (depending on your other skill levels). It requires 50 firemaking and there's official worlds for it

is that not the intended function of those weapons? people have been abusing alt methods for skilling and pvm forever, why is this specific instance of abusing alts a problem?

It was untradeable, took 2m dungeoneering XP to achieve and degraded to an uncharged state that needed 200k dung XP worth of points to recharge. It's the same argument for having any untradeable gear, like a torso. I don't really see anything wrong with that tbh, just gives people that can't afford it an alternative option (even tho the time it takes to get is comparable to the time it takes to make that much gp)

Also why you dont leak personal information

Just wanted to tack on that this is absolutely not allowed by twitch, jagex, youtube, or anybody else really. The nature of anybody being able to stream on twitch means that its a big game of whack-a-mole trying to keep them off the site.
---
Twitch is already doing as much as they can to stop these scammers, but so are the scammers who are doing as much as they can to circumvent bans.
---
The best thing we as a community can do about it is continue reporting the streams when we see them, and raising awareness among inexperienced players about phishing links, and the common strategies scammers use to get you to click them.

Best GP in game is \~12-15m GP/hr doing trio ToB. Obviously depending on luck, but on average would take 10 hours. Which is only a couple hours more than it took to efficiently get 200k dung points to buy a Farhseer

---
I copied Slayermusiq‚Äôs guide and was able to complete it with worse stats than you. The only thing I would do differently is use Blowpipe (with Addy or better darts) with Super Anti-fire at Vorkath. Galvek is kinda RNG based, so just keep teleporting out if you are running too low on supplies.
---
115m xp in 1 week seems a bit too high

I believe it's called "status bars"

Huh. I've been playing rs3 and was annoyed that I always got put in a world with 1k people despite starring w97. TIL
---
Because you can have unlimited of each book, it would probably be hard to make it where you take the pages out of one and they all become empty
---
Be aware that quest Vorkath is a lot easier than normal Vorkath.
---
Ultra. There‚Äôs no reason to use super
---
It‚Äôs okay for learning, but definitely not something you want to use long term

You could quest 2 accounts at once

Most impressive thing for me is that rc lvl

Its not hard to find fixes for it. Make it so if youve used the altar 2-3 times in xx u cant use it again. Make is so you cant trade in xx after u have used the altar due to some energy in the altar.

---
I think its awesome! I dont remember the names of them but the 2nd Avas (steel arrows, 50 range) could perhaps be given to Ava with the monkey and 100k and she'll tinker it into a small backpack for the monkey on your back - its not the best but its usable fashionscape and a goldsink
---
Not awful with Teleports
---
I did it 6 months ago and made 1300m. Had an account that was low hp 99 range I used for rushing and I stacked up void point while getting 60 attack and strength, used all my points in 1 log and went Dds staking at the duel arena. My stats looked low on the highscores but my str was actually much higher and my combat level was similar because I started ranged based.
---
If they had placed more emphasis on exploring new dungeons outside of Daemonheim (like the Elite Dungeons, but for various levels), I think it would've been more well received and worthy of being called a skill.

No, Zolcano is more like Wintertodt. The Gauntlet in Prifddinas is going to be akin to solo Dungeoneering.
---
Why waste money on wines when you can afk and profit for similar rates or 1t karams for like 1m+/h
---
Happy cake day. üç∞
---
Agreed, people seem to forget that this game is an mmorpg, if someone wants to sit on the streets and beg for their time playing the game that day let them. If you start banning players for shit like new players will get unsuspecting bans when asking for help and quit. Terrible idea for the longevity of the game.
---
I don't mean to say untradeable items have to be bad, which is why I mentioned void (I may have worded it poorly), but they should not ruin the current value of BiS items. The drag defender had the biggest impact of these items due to it crashing the DFS price, but since DFS is better in niche situations it kind of worked out. 
---
Chaotics were very bad for bossing when they were added. They were easy to get, easy to maintain, brought very little risk when using them, and were BiS in every situation you wanted to use them for. That is the problem.
---
Once again, I am not trying to say all untradeables have to be weak. I am just pointing out how unbelievably OP the original Dungeoneering rewards were, and the harm it did to the price of other items.
---
There are some real solid options here.
---
I did it with these stats as well, but my ranged was a tad higher. Nice work!
---
Someday you will look at that list and have them all crossed off :)
---
81hp and 200m in gear using mantas for a Turoth task lmao I‚Äôd say quite a bit

He's on his knees begging for mercy
---
Because you have not gotten the drop
---
Bro, what?
---
It is pretty grindy, but agility is grindy in itself. And yeah, it's best on official worlds. Some people solo, as I think it gives more XP per hour, but honestly it has a very high rate on the official worlds anyway, so I wouldn't.
---
Not sure why everyone justifies it because it takes a lot of effort. It‚Äôs clearly OP. TBH using an alt to assist your main account for xp rates shouldn‚Äôt be allowed imo.
---
Child bearing hips and nice titties.
---
Good job bro

&gt; without having to pay for friends.
---
Are you really that dumb?
---
Did I miss something?
---
Always seen this guy figuring out top-tier skilling methods over the years, cool. Nice to see that this exceptionelly op method got patched too
---
Happens. I did 2.4k from steel. Then steel to dragon before 3k.
---
Crafting holy symbols is pretty chill.You could also smith the silver bars reuired to make this yourself and then start making the symbols in the same inventory, which makes you bank less often
---
Neat
---
When doing birdhouse runs, do you have to wait an hour lf ingame time or does logged out also count as time passed?
---
I got 7 whips and the abyssal dagger in like 700 kc... Best rng I ever had in this game.
---
This is the guy you see yelling at disabled homeless vets on the street to "get a job"
---
Ah, the good ole days when I understood absolutely nothing about the game and everything was a new adventure.
---
Lol? 
---
That's a little bit funny and spoken like someone who doesn't want to take the time to make an alt!
---
My Rune Dragon alt makes me ~1.2m per hour without MM2.
---
I think it's cause players didn't realize just exactly how much xp/hr you could get. This would give incentive to gold farmers to make max combat bots in 1/5 the time using this method rather than NMZ for weeks.
---
Both of those are pretty close to skull scepter tele. Draynor wheat field is the most isolated one, and shantay is the longest walk overall.
---
Oh no, not this. I'd set it slap bang in the middle if I could.
---
You'll make about 6 or 7m
---
Way too OP. Unexpected effect of this weapon.
---
Same thing happened to me, I was busy getting out of my chair going fuck yeah
---
Then the healers got me because jad takes 10 fucking seconds to die
---
Lmaoooo I remember back when I first started playing in 2004 I died and lost all of my tutorial island items by the dark wizards in varrock. I spent like an hour begging outside the wizards tower and I met a "mentor" who gave me free runes and taught me "the ways of magic". I ended up doing the same thing for other noobs for years after that.
---
Begging has been in this game since it's launch, and to make it a banneable offense is just sad. 
---
I don't even play this game anymore but logging into an f2p world with my maxed main and having a train of noobs begging for free stuff gives me a rush of nostalgia every time. If you don't like begging just add chat filters into runelite.
---
Next thing you know people are gonna be asking to ban people trying to buy gf's. Lmfao.
---
feelsbadman.jpg Alexa, play Sad Violin

"whats a good moneymaker for new player like me" "i played this game for 10 years lol"

---
Scamming too. And botting/rwting etc etc (rules should be more strictly enforced).
---
Like 99% of them are pures so yeah, you‚Äôre probably right.
---
Assuming he did poh he had to keep entering the ring when they died.
---
Its 1/ (512√ó512)
---
Yeah it's a decent dynamic I wish they do more, especially for single combat areas. Revs has created a pretty good ecosystem for multi
---
If you have a high defence level then arcane might be better than spectral, so it depends if you find +20 m. accuracy better than +30 m. defence
---
It also comes at a high gp cost, which is better used to buy ancestral for % m. damage, and at that point you already have high enough magic accuracy but instead lacking some defence, so I would have spectral.
---
For the other options: Dragonfire ward(+28) &gt; twisted buckler(+26) &gt; odium ward (+24)
---
Go to edgeville..talk to Oziach and they‚Äôll start dropping

Don't really know who mod acorn is, but he must have the best job at jagex. Only ever heard of him doing stuff like this and commenting on reddit (and not the smackdown kind of posts)

When I first started RuneScape, I remember being in 4th or 5th grade getting together a group of friends to take down a Black Knight and dividing the black armor it would drop....

Long story short, we were very disappointed lol.

You really couldn‚Äôt be bothered to go to clan wars/ rejuvenate pool 10hp/prayer? Rip 13mil

You can do that in chrome itself.

My next goal is to get full Graceful and knock out a bunch of quests that I have the requirements for
---
Great work man, keep at it!
---
Jagex can't even prevent offensive names from going through. How ar e they going to monitor begging. Also, would certain word combinations like "give me money" give you a mute? People will always find a way around it. Instead of relying on Jagex, a good idea would be to filter chat yourself, i.e. filter "give me money".
---
No one cares about the points. Claiming that the opinion is unpopular raises discussion and increases attention.
---
Giving money to people who need it is being nice person, beggars at ge aren't that 99% of the time
---
Nothings far from anything in f2p.
---
Just keep doubling down on the word you didn't understand lol. Makes you look incredibly smart ;)
---
Dungeoneering was a shit skill, should've been a minigame tbh
---
You chose the specific reward or accept a random reward. He's only picking tomes, so he only gets tomes.
---
I started January of 2018 and I think I have 25ish (?) days of play time. I definitely wasn‚Äôt super efficient though
---
If you have the money to get nexus then get it, but otherwise just make the portals, and wait till you have the money to sink into a nexus
---
whats hard in the game lol just click yellow pots when ur low and try and not get hit üòÇ

big moni snak
---
I think in this instance it works. Correct me if I am wrong, but are there any Zamorak followers that have blue? Their general make-up seems to follow red and black, and imo, I prefer that for consistency sake.

I check it off but it doesn't sandwich the inventory like his which is the part I'm confused on

9 alts to be hit or whatever then the rest spec xfer.

7. profit
---
he meant 1/1,000,000
---
Ok you clearly know my motives better than myself as I followed up saying I didn't blame runelite. I came because it was a thread about hacks when I recently got hacked, trying to see if anything would be done about it. I know nothing probably ever will as Jagex customer support is basically nonexistent. Does a data breach count for 99.99% times people get hacked of their own doing? As you say I got fooled, but you didn't have any proof of that. I haven't used my email in over a month I said, I haven't typed the username/password in like 5 years because of autosave.
---
Nah I just love pussy
---
U could spec xfer with enough people tho in 2007 and get the same xp rate with d2h minus kiln cape, etc. it just required a lot more people.
---
With these two anecdotal pieces we have learned that things do be different sometimes
---
Why are people so embarrassed about buying bonds lol?
---
No it‚Äôs a pretty bad skill too.
---
wow worst clue tier ever gives worst reward. wow.
---
Aren‚Äôt a lot of the beggars bots, though? Don‚Äôt they beg, wait to get something, then automatically world hop and repeat?
---
I would love to see some form of development in pvp for two reasons. 1. I love watchin‚Ä¶
---
Not everyone is an unforgiving toxic shit.

This is all false

---
Thank you for the help once you're home, usually I understand the options but this one has alluded me
---
Dude stop some of us haven‚Äôt seen it yet üò≠
---
I did DS2 with overall higher stats than you: around 79+ range, 85ish HP.
---
Vorkath: I got him on my first try. Well, first try that I didn't dc (I believe I DC'd, either on my first attempt during quest OR first post-quest attempt, w/e). 
---
Robert: easy enough overall for me with mid 80 melee stats.
---
Galvek: OH GOD I wasted over 20 attempts. Some from misclicks (My B), some from auto-retaliate making me run into waves, and some from bad RNG. 
---
I once got him to 6 HP, but he hit me for all 7 of my HP. I had no more food. I felt defeated.
---
This is quite an achievement.
---
Skotizo is also Zamorakian but is purple, and that helps it have a distinguishing flavor think. I guess blue might be too non-Zamorakian
---
People do but bots don‚Äôt and I think a lot of the beggars are bots
---
Appreciate the quick response. Working on it right now.
---
I did it on a sunday morning at 6 am. Didn't see a single soul. Highly recommend.
---
Think Jagex said bunch of people are out of the office this week and there‚Äôs a UK holiday or something.
---
Didn‚Äôt use piety, smh.
---
You're quite the delusional optimist.
---
I mean obviously its easy to fix. But why should it be fixed? Getting 1m range xp an hour in mm2 tunnels using alts is okay, this isn't?
---
Wasn‚Äôt the crystal halberd supposed to stack up to 3 people maximum?
---
Also since I‚Äôm here... what‚Äôs the maximum amount of targets a barrage can hit? I wanna guess and say it‚Äôs 9 targets at once, but maybe someone else here knows
---
Gives you negative attack stats and allows you to xlog in single combat.
---
Np, 9m wouldn‚Äôt get you close, I think i spent 40m getting 86 con and paying for all my house upgrade, the nexus, pool, occult altsr etc
---
Why do you assume I bought bonds? Fletching is a profitable skill...
---
This post would  be gilded if I wasn't so cheap.
---
14/14 skills are easy enough to do while doing zulrah on an alt, so u profit. same goes for air bstaves etc
---
Still
---
It really isn't bad. It's got a lot of varied training methods and moneymaking methods
---
that subreddit is more cancerous than lymphoma
---
Does anyone really use dragon armor? My combat levels are in the 60s and I still wear either rune or proselyte when I‚Äôm doing slayer and quests, along with a dragon sword.
---
The cost seems retarded for the full set so I‚Äôm guessing most people just ride it out until Barrows gear.

How fast was the slap, how close were you to 1665.65m/s?

Not knowing what this setup is for I'd guess a malediction ward
---
all demonstrably and verifiably false. Why are you attempting to smear our good names?
---
Bots programmed to beg should be banned for botting, not begging.
---
Fair point, forgot about Skotizo.
---
Alrighty, this is going to be my last response. I assume you won't be able to resist getting the last word in, so get a good final response in :p Perhaps use a dictionary this time.

What do you think happened to sailing and artisan? They both failed so the time and money invested disappeared.

that seems like a lot. is anyone actually doing 10 alts at RDS? cause I mean .. . .I could probably do that too

It‚Äôs a meme about Visage drops

Has Settled received any pets yet? I assume he has to have, but I don't remember see any in his videos.

I just use it for general slayer/pvming.

Still have to get the stats to equip the hally though.

That or chins

I see, thanks for the tips! If it's not too much trouble, can you help me out with some good tips for my skills? And things I should/could do? [My rsn is 'gaesko'](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/hiscorepersonal.ws?user1=User)
---
Yeah I think I knew about the D2h method in 2009 lol.  Just finally someone decided to put in the effort and push it to its limit and now they finally go around changing it
---
Just because it differs from your opinion doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs cancerous. Same could be said about every left leaning echo chamber on Reddit.
---
Flip a coin 4 times and you might get heads every flip
---
There's also the fact that more people play efficiently and are looking for stuff like this. Used to be the hiscores guys pretty much exclusively doing this shit.
---
Rules pls
---
I never asked about moneymaking methods, I asked about "varied training methods"
---
But true, you can do afk bloods/souls
---
That gives us two different methods of training rc, that's not really "varied"..
---
What‚Äôs stops people from doing this with barrage or chins?? Is there a max number of people that can enter the ring? Or is it just more efficient to barrage/chin at other places.
---
I've never done Slayer. How do I initiate that and what are the downsides?
---
much love ya crazy hot girl
---
That's like saying mining doesn't have varied training methods because it's just all swinging pickaxe at rocks
---
I'm a maxed zerker almost max total, and I pked for years so its not my build its just pking looks lame atm.  Also I want brews to stay there balanced, my point was that the other option kwarwambi isn't.  Granite maul I agree is inaccurate at higher levels but due to its ability to potentially hit high causes safeing.
---
Can I be your friend too please! I can pay you coins
---
What if a counter to this was the ballista, so you can hit both players
---
About as wrong as you, neither of us have empirical data to back up our claims so what is the purpose of your post.
---
In reference to brews I think they were saying that there is a nice trade off because of the stat reduction. I don't have an issue with combo eating because you burn through your inventory when you are tanking damage.
---
j1mmy doesn't really pk lol this was a joke

Harry Potter, but even more handsome and powerful.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for my dopamine hit with Konar keys and clue caskets. Gonna hit 1k keys in the next year and hopefully 1-2k caskets

Yeah I agree that having to replay low floors was pretty shit.  The only real big problem with the skill imo
---
Isn't it?
---
Haha well fair point, you're right. 
---
I take my point back in this context
---
You need to finish the quest to do that.
---
&gt;in a thread about this very fact
---
An Ironman can‚Äôt pick up anybody else‚Äôs emblems
---
Super good luck on those drops! Finish off another brimstone ring and you‚Äôre done lol
---
I remember a video of someone crystal harlberding at Nechs and getting like 400k cb xp/hr with an alt - so this definitely has practical uses which were eliminated by the update.
---
Construction is also crafting then, and fletching, and smithing.
---
I'd start working towards barrows gloves too. You have good enough combat stats to finish rfd, just gotta get the skilling stats up for quest reqs
---
ZMI too, so thats 3. That's not bad for skills in the current game.

&gt;It's also the only skill in the Pre-EoC game where your skill had no influence on reaching max exp rates.
---
I mean "no influence" is ofc untrue. But yes it was impacted by other people and IMO that's fine. I think it was really quite a lot like any team game, where everyone wants to believe it's the fault of their incompetent team but the truth is that the vast, vast majority of people below 110 dung were just bad lol. 
---
The bind system was RNG but also fine IMO. It's way different now than it was then, the reason hex was so rare was because 99 slayer was rare. Nowadays everyone and their brother has 99 slayer so gazers would be spawning twice a floor lmao
---
true my bad. Thanks for the correction
---
Congrats man! That is an achievement! I didn't realize how rough this boss is, I must have gotten hella lucky. I had almost the exact same setup and stats as you except black dhide and no mantas. My only death was to Vorkath when I wasn't paying attention to his fireball. I was pretty happy when I one shot Galvek but in seeing the other posts I think I should have been even more excited in hindsight. I just watched one of those guide vids for the quest itself and watched the Galvek portion twice. It was my last quest for the quest cape and I just wanted it over with haha.
---
Vork only has 3 legs m8. He's missing the front one.
---
It still exists in RS3 so I could easily see it. It's faster for everyone.
---
I'm spoiling avengers endgame to everyone I see on osrs.

you get your first task from the guy in barthoupe with the slayer icon on the map. the downside is you might need to spend money on supplys like ppots and food and wont be making money till you a big chad with at least 60 something slayer
---
Someone could lock your account at any time too by spamming recover attempts.
---
Dude has no chest

Only missing the fire runes or staff and it would be the perfect clue.
---
If you're sweaty enough to successfully train up and run 10 alts at Rune Dragons then go for it. Why would that be a problem?
---
It does seem a bit silly since their specs intentionally multi-hit and this was a known thing for ages now. I don't think their actions so far are unreasonable though; best to temp remove to take time to evaluate it. But it does seem like the issue wasn't so much the specs but other factors or else this would have come up a lot sooner.
---
Shit man, back when you actually gained pride from games.. Now all you need is to know how to do the "floss" or "orange justice". Which also both cost more than the Amulet. 
---
I miss AQ... Them Zards man..

[Rules of RuneScape](https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules): "Multi-logged accounts must not interact with each other to exploit gameplay mechanics, such as attempting to rig the result of a minigame. "
---
I get it that this particular part of the rules are hard to enforce in general, but when someone posts a picture of themselves clearly using alts to exploit gameplay mechanics why is no action ever taken?
---
No,  mine just says pouch: 0 Invent 0.
---
I mean, CoX is already similar to Dungeoneering, and so is the Gauntlet. I'm not saying that it's similar in the sense that you have to go around searching rooms for keys, doing puzzles, etc. I meant more in terms of "you start the dungeon searching for materials to make gear and then finish the floor by killing a boss".
---
I don't want anyone thrusting with kids
---
check the rank and total xp
---
If you're sweaty enough to train up 14 alts and do this training method, why should it get nerfed?
---
Ah, basically melee splashing. Nice.
---

They're capped at 4000.
---
what is the best use of alts in the end anyway?
---
yeah used it twice now, thanks for hosting, no more shit ping hosts
---
The flip-side to that, though, is that most jobs in that rural area will also pay a bit less. For me at least I know that if I moved to the Mid-West and landed the exact same job I'm doing now, I'd expect about a 4k/year paycut, which would be between a 10 and 15% decrease. The cost of living would drop by a much higher percentage than that, though, so it more or less evens out
---
But at the same time, it's good for the game to make every item distinguishable
---
was having a good day till my immersion was ruined
---
entirely depends on what you are trying to do
---
be careful though with some of the open unmoderated clan chats, some can be toxic. If you land in a bad one, don't think that means they all are horrible.

"gotrippedoffbyjagex"
---
Idk it‚Äôs pretty fun for me atm, if you want a real challenge try bridding or no honor pking, which has a high skill ceiling. If you look at someone like St0ney idk how PvP can be lame, but I understand what you mean when it‚Äôs just regular AGS.
---
I'd be okay with the micromanagement stuff if the game was responsive. But it's still chained to 1.666 ticks per second, which makes any intensive combat feel abysmal and unsatisfying.
---
I have no clue what any of this means

&gt; Discredit him with policy and not with these smears.

The skeletons in his closet are his god awful, shit policies.

You just brought back a childhood memory from like 15 years ago.   Wandering south of Fally and watching some dude plead with a highwayman to leave him alone.

I'd be lying if I said I've never thought about packing my life into a van and going on the road

I totally agree the wild is great overall. There are a few things that I think that can be tweaked to make things more enjoyable for PvMers in the wild. Right now I think a lot of them are too scared to fight back at all due to being scared of getting skull tricked. One way I can think of to solve this is to make left-click attack only work for players that have skulled on you. This way PvMers can fight back by left clicking and not worry about getting skulled. After all they usually should have an advantage if they bring a spec weapon due to being unskulled and able to bring better items. I also think multi-combat needs to be toned down. IMO multi should mean 3-5 people can attack you, not an entire clan. Or at least have only a few areas be truly multi (rev caves). Also some of the cheezy weapons need to have their effects removed in the wild. D-Spear, ancient mace...clans are effing people over and that player has zero recourse.
---
That was...ok.
---
no honor bridding i what turned me away from briding, went from setting up to kos to who can outlast the other.

Yeah right..

Fire Cape, barring a high-difficulty methods, is entirely based on Ranged and Prayer, with defense being a bit helpful. If it's you're first time doing it, I'd say 75 range for a Blowpipe and 43+ (higher is better) prayer is fine to get through the whole caves as long as you look up how to gear and lure properly beforehand. Honestly, I think it's just as easy at 70 with a Karil's Bow, but most people disagree.
---
I saw all these do your clues posts and liked the sound of it haha
---
Tbh next solo boss I want is the QBD.
---
Damn the internet is fucking wild these days
---
Yeah I've seen it. Pretty crazy stuff. I think people are assuming my previous comment was me calling BS. I just meant to say its a crazy thought keeping that up, while using the alts for what I can assume is 140 hours(?)
---
Im guessing he was averaging much higher rates? I really dont know for certain how hard these guys push themselves for these 168 hour periods.
---
38-70 herb doing prayer pots costs about 4.4m.
---
They‚Äôre more dangerous than their combat level suggests, not the actual technical skill of fighting ...
---
Whaaaaattttt
---
So I have a theory on this. Why damage the karils but not the other piece? I don't think he necessarily died on purpose, but it seemed a bit self sabotaging. Being lighter for the 500 hours of trekking, should get him to 27 hunter. Another objective which being as light as possible will be a benefit. And the ivandis flail is a decent substitute to the scimitar, and deals bonus damage to vampires.
---
As far as herblore goes, he needs 90 to make super combats. He can get everything to make them. Im not sure how ToB works, but it would be the only way to get super restores. However he could make brews. 
---
 
---
I don't think he died on purpose. But I don't think he was upset by dying. He can get more seeds from vampires while hunting clue scrolls. And he would want his whip for that. So all those extra inventory slots will help. So I think gambling with his life was a willing risk he took.
---
literally all I would do as a Jmod.

Why not disable it just for poh?

Here I am struggling with fucking jad
---
In before: "Guy with 300 alts gets 99 range in 47 minutes"
---
I think he means effort in terms of manually controlling your account plus 15 alts at the same time, as opposed to training in NMZ where it‚Äôs pretty much fully afk.
---
Go to a cooking range, hold 2, use a karambwan on the range every tick.
---
Nothing. It's been in the game for a decade basically untouched
---
With a duo option!
---
Castle wars was fun content, but it has no motivation for players other then fasionscape. Duel area... Let's be honest here is the sand casino and barely qualifies as PvP content. That straight gambling. Clan man mode is getting removed for restructuring. And yes I know that the wilderness is a PvP area, that's not to say that PvM doesn't have resentment towards PvP. It's an overlap in two different play styles that the other decided not to do. I'm just giving an honest view on the situation. And even with those minigames... It's still a very small portion of game itself.
---
Wtf you used an email you have accessed in years? You never changed the contact email for jagex?
---
The intended purpose wasn't for turbovirgins to create 40 alts and spec all of them at the same time in a POH.
---
But where is group iron Man
---
Doesn‚Äôt incognito mode even say that when you open a tab of it? Like something about how your ISP the FBI and people behind you can still see your traffic
---
There's actually a lot of untapped potential for smarter bots in the wildy. 
---
Imagine having 100 pure bots of the same combat level and distributed 1 per world. Then having them roam the multi wildy syncing what tile everyone was on, so if any bot on any world saw a player it could attack, all bots from all other worlds could instantly hop to that world and obliterate them. Even if a bot or two died as everyone was hopping, it seems the other bots could still get the kill and reclaim the loot.
---
One is nornally playing separate accounts while the other is a "clever use of game mechanics" I'd say they are mostly different. 
---
However, this hally tactic still shouldn't be fixed imo.
---
I only listen to podcasts when I'm driving
---
They could definitely make decent quality Dungeoneering, there's private servers that made ok copies without the source code.
---
Fuck trump

Well it looks like you kind of contradicted your own disagreement.  It can be fun, you just need friends.

No it won't. You'll be able to make wards anywhere on the map outside of a bank. The runecraft style element is simply an alternative faster method of obtaining vis, which you'll be able to buy on the ge, though it won't be the fastest method of gaining xp.
---
Hahahahah this guy get its! I just got it bro! Ahahah gonna get a suppressor and do it chill! Still crazy that it‚Äôs legally a ‚Äúpistol‚Äù lol
---
My personal preference when I was a new member was to get every skill to 50. This helps cover a lot of the requirements for quests and co-skilling skills (Like how agility is useful for pretty much everything, herblore for farming etc). This also gives you an idea of what skills you enjoy doing the most and can help guide you that way. So I'd start there.
---
Otherwise I'd encourage you to create a spreadsheet or document on what your goals are, and then you can always reference that whenever you are looking for something to do. I have all my goals for each skill laid out and can pick and choose whatever I am feeling like working towards.
---
*Opinion*: Also slayer and farming are dope. Get on that.
---
New meta: paying 20m/hr for people let you hally spec them over and over
---
Thank you
---
"relatively low stats"
---
FML my highest is a 66 and I thought I was doing decent
---
Is the symbol meant to be dungeoneering? I stopped playing around that time so idk. Fun activities like that don't need to be skills, that can simply be a mini game. There are a ton of fun things to do in rs, while there aren't that many money sinks.
---
I was going to argue that dungeoneering doesn't need to be a skill and can be a minigame instead, but then I realized people don't really do the fun content for fun anymore anyways, in favour of efficiency. In which case, making it a skill would actually make people more likely to engage in it, and do it together to make it less boring.
---
An elo system would take a lot of dev time though, so it wouldn't happen any time soon. Also would that even solve any of the issues with PvP? You would need a separate arena for a ranked PvP mode with rewards, which would just fragment the PvP community even further. Like why would you PK in a PvP world if you can just go to the arena. Or it would just be dead, because it would be lacking the thrill of killing someone for loot, or the fear of losing your own shit.
---
Fuck me, would have been nice to know this was a thing before it was removed lol
---
The state of RS3
---
Holy shit, people need to report these accounts.
---
he posts on the donald, so idk why he is complaining when he has a safe space there
---
Hey man Predatr here. OP is my clan mate and I'm pretty sure he didn't bot. He's been stuck in the hospital and been fetching all day long while he's there (tells us about it in cc), He's always talking in CC when he's online. Pretty sure Jagex messed up wouldn't be the first time.
---
dungeoneering is pre eoc not rs3
---
wow, I've never seen anything fly so far over someones head. He was making a point that your stats are too low for any type of efficient money making. Idk how that wasn't obvious tho tbh
---
Eh if I get banned it‚Äôs what ever, haven‚Äôt yet and it‚Äôs been a couple days so we‚Äôll see. Game just isn‚Äôt fun anymore. And you can never have to many guns
---
It's just another exploit people don't want to lose.
---
If you're going 44, might as well go 45
---
Ihavebeenpwned generally does give you the leak it was compromised in, unless it was one of those massive ones recently discovered.
---
And if anyone has access to your email they can get ahold of a ton of shit that it‚Äôs connected to simply by submitting reset requests, and no jagex shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for ppl getting hacked unless it is a mod Jed.
---
You should maybe have used a bank to store items????? That would have saved you unless they could get into your pin.
---
Jagex does need to up their security protocols for password strength and as well as I think 2fa should have a delay. However not using the same info on multiple places is also a good place to start.
---
You not storing items in your bank is 100% on you
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a desk chair, pretty damn comfortable
---
I DON‚ÄôT KNOW YOU!
---
Took me over 5k to go from rune to dragon.  Got like 10 key halves, 2 cut dstone drops and like 700k in alchs before that damn defender finally dropped
---
Do you have a lot of viewers?
---
I agree the shop-determined rune supply and price ceilings aren't good for both runecrafting or the economy. Although I think bloods and souls rcing is the best method for ironmen to get those runes.
---
I pretty much associate them together. Did they not come out really close to each other?
---
Even when I agree with what is posted on that sub, I still find that echo chamber jarring.
---
Why? Hahahah because I sold GP, game isn‚Äôt fun if you can afford everything
---
I got the alert for this post from the reddit app too. Definitely paid to have it trending.
---
Well, Chambers of Xeric does already scale somewhat:
---
 &gt; Scaling difficulty - The difficulty of the chambers are based on the player with the highest combat level. So the higher the combat level of the team is, the stronger the enemies will be.
---
From the [Wiki page.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chambers_of_Xeric/Strategies)
---
However, I do agree that maybe a lower levelled raids type minigame with more fair scaling could be interesting, to introduce it to a much greater proportion of players including mid levels. That being said, with that comes to the fact that lower level raids would lead to lower loot, in which case it is difficult to say whether it would be popular enough to warrant the time spent on it. It would be unfair to introduce a minigame which, similar to Wintertodt, is easier and more worthwhile for lower levelled players.
---
Thanks for the downvotes, I can downvote you too buddy.
---
Wow you just saved the game! How did we not think of that before?!

OK.

The only fun in the wildy is watching them spam splash 2-3k casts of barrage on Black D'Hide + Bullwark.

---
make sure you pm me when you do so I can help you laugh at them!
---
Yea, Its a clever use of mechanics. An exploit isnt a bad thing. Exploiting everything to its maximum potential is called metagame. Remove one exploit, another takes its place. Remove them all, you cant play the game or the game has zero variety.
---
Clearly was a joke.
---
Dg is a shit skill pls don't ever make that a thing
---
It's Cvv. friggin amateur...
---
&gt; An elo system would take a lot of dev time though,
---
I mean they told us that too when it came to the CC kicking people out constantly when we were asking for it to be fixed for 6 months but people got kicked out of raids once because of it and it was fixed in a day. So I don't believe it will take up too much dev time.  They could implement this in the bh world.  It already counts your kills.  They have discussed wanting to be more of an esport like dmm so it would make sense to invest time into an elo system.  I've never understood pvp worlds to begin with.  Pvp should be focused on the wilderness which is in every world.  
---
&gt;because it would be lacking the thrill of killing someone for loot, or the fear of losing your own shit.
---
No one said this would go away.
---
Depends on what you're looking for, XP or money?
---
For money it's herbs, I think ranarrs provide the best profit, but any herbs that sell well should be good.
---
For XP, I think hespori and trees are your best bet, but it gets expensive.
---
Not bots, just lazy noobs. A long time ago, when I was more generous, I sometimes gave them basic supplies and explained them how to make money for themselves.
---
U don‚Äôt need dragon bolts at all at brutals lol. I was getting my best times with regulars ruby and diamond e. Even just addy diamond e was barely slower than using ruby e for the first half. I got 12k kc on my alt with max range setup   All the dragon bolts do is just eat into the profit
---
Says the man who's name is "a_name_for_reddit"
---
Mechquest was some good shit, too.
---
Makes sense. The main reason I asked, actually, was because when I was younger I would create new accounts all the time for no logical reason (I am not saying your reasoning is not logic or that you were not hacked, I am talking solely about my own experience here). Anytime something "weird", even really small stuff, happened, like logging in on a different square than the one I thought I logged out on or missing a level up message, I would feel a crippling discomfort. A feeling like the account missed something or that I would never feel accomplished if I didn't get every single step moved or XP gained on my own.  I later found out that I have OCD, which after treatment is now much more under control.
---
Anyway, as the others said already, you cannot reset, but you can start over and do a double name change to transfer the names. Send me a pm here on Reddit with your username if you need any help in-game.
---
How does ranarr give good money when the seeds are that expensive?
---
But did you shit your pants?
---
With that logic everything not in wildy is content for pvmers?
---
Too logical mate
---
I hope this is unpopular.
---
I agreed 100% until I changed my own mind 5 minutes ago. Someone said that it was a fun thing to do with friends, and I was going to say how you can do the exact same thing if it were a mini game.
---
And while that *is* true, we all know that minigames have a very small number of active players. More people would do it if it were a skill vs a minigame, and you could train that skill together so it would arguably bring people together more as a skill. 
---
But as for the actual content of it, yea it totally felt like a minigame, absolutely.
---
Lol in rs3? I‚Äôm taking about pre-eco you monkey
---
Its because its the only cape that looks like that and its really hard to get and such
---
what if i'm using a radas blessing 4?...
---
To answer your question I suggest you... Train a brand new account from combat lvl 3 to max. Plot your xp/hr and do some quickmath. EXP/hr goes on ur X axis, total ellapsed time goes on your Y axis. Analyze your graph.
---
Slayer helm imbued then.

Even if the death timers were to be reverted the d scim wouldnt be above alch price, it‚Äôs the main weapon used for melee pking, more d scims are dropped on the floor by pking than pvm deaths.
---
How is d long and d med a ‚Äùniche item‚Äù, they are used by none other than cute noobs that havent began questing yet, they are alch value because they are useless and unwanted, but keeps entering the game. Through various pvm drops, most d meds are probably from barrows, and barrows existed on release.
---
I cant recall the d med ever being 100k+ in osrs.
---
Bruv I'm 1.1k with none lmaoo
---
Yeah, but unfortunately that's more of a Reddit problem than a r/politics problem though. The subreddit could definitely be improved by limiting sources like talkingpointsmemo or shareblue and stuff though. But then the problem is that it requires sources to not have paywalls so you can't have good journalism like NYT or WP.
---
I remember my first beer
---
It gets downvoted by the community..... that‚Äôs like the entire point of upvotes, downvotes, and subs.....
---
Haven‚Äôt been around for a while. What exactly was the weapon being abused?
---
Jagex: Hey guys we just made this new weapon, which we clearly intend for you to use to rapidly gain combat xp by exploiting alt accounts in your POH
---
Nobody:
---
Some dude years later: Guys check out how i used 14 alts and a crystal hally to rack up 200m xp in a week
---
Repoooooost
---
1k kills and only 1 jar so far :(
---
I understand your point but, that sub, politics, is a literal cesspool. I've had someone threaten to find me and hurt me on there before all because I made a pro-trump comment.
---
I also got mass downvoted and banned from there very shortly after.
---
I'm pretty sure no other sub does that based on political party alone.
---
tbh I use to enjoy Dungeoneering back in the day. The only problem was that the chaotic weapons where busted.
---
Is that laptop a budget 300 dollar laptop? I'm not just making things up here, this is from personal experience with this tier of laptop. They're junk and not suited for running RuneScape smoothly. And has runelite added a feature to go above 50fps that I'm unaware of?
---
What a silly thing to fix and prioritize. Its such a impractical method for the vast majority of players, due to whats needed and the lengths you need to set up for it. Its just funny what jagex decides to pick and choose and deem integrity change.
---
Btw they missed spec xfering dclaws and bulwark AOE spec in PoH. 
---
This does nothing to stop you from using alts/paying for other ppl to spec xfer you in catacombs or mm2 tunnels and using aoe there btw. Just adds even more layers and convolution to it. 
---
Btw the same dude posted/tweeted a video of the same method a year ago, using poh dungeon and d2h to get 800k exp/hr, with the help of his clanmmates. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlNouniMCbY (which the set up for this was - 2 spec xfer 2 heal other, 1 heal group/off heal and a 14 stack of players with zerker necklaces with 52+hp) https://twitter.com/1_Defence/status/998314521189126144 (he even made diagrams for ppl to follow)
---
The method was known well before then too. It was fine then and all those years ago. I guess it being posted on reddit is what got it changed. Which explains why claw spec xfering and bulwark weren't touched, because those other recent reddit posts didn't mention them.
---
This also could've birthed some low entry money making methods for ppl, just like ess running for players at zmi. Even if it was temporary like dancers at mm2 tunnels when that method was first discovered.
---
Because people are in awe at the size of this lad. Absolute unit.
---
This person can probably vote üíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
&gt; So you options are to either fight them or to not fight at all, which gets even worse if you arent on a main and you have to consider account builds.
---
Which are already the options.  This is more for the bulk of players not the combat level outliers.  For whatever reason most of these people choose pvp worlds instead.  The better solution is to get rid of pvp worlds to repopulate wildy and specifically edge bh wildy.
---
Jesus reading this and the other comments is fucking nightmare fuel
---
So should the climbing boots, bear head, defenders, dscim, etc. not be unlocked through quests? In the same vein, infernal cape isn't unobtainable to pkers, they just have to try harder. Kelvino has a cmb lvl 57 with the cape. Fire cape used to be the same, it has the same restrictions as the inferno just a little easier. Should fire cape be tradeable?
---
On your first point, voting on high end PvM should be locked to high end pvmers because you can't make a judgement on something that you don't know anything about. Low level players have never done difficult pvm and can't judge the difficulty of the inferno, while high level players have gone through all the low level stuff so they know what changes jagex should bring. 
---
Also, I'd like to add that the inferno isn't impossible or unfair like you're making it out to be. It's a very doable challenge but requires you to understand the waves and know how to set the monsters up. Almost all the damage is avoidable if you know how to do it correctly, in fact most speedrunners bring 2-3 brews on task because they really dont need more than that.

It's cause the game doesn't save your player ID when you log out (as proved by dropping an item as an iron, logging out and then back in and being unable to pick it up) so they would have to rework the entire player ID system to not only give people a permanent ID but also have systems to remember and track those ID's
---
My brain cells..
---
I want a poll saying a new skill is forced out of these options, highest percent wins. "Summoning, Dungeoneering, Warding, Skip"
---
I dont see how that is a counterpoint... he found a way to train without putting more gold/items in the game... rune drags farm bring milions of gp into the game per hour, ots way worst aint it? Or am i missing something? And this methode takes a lot pf runes for spec xfer i think, wich is good :)
---
Nah, shit players who can‚Äôt kill other, far better pkers should quit this fucking game. Why are none of them going into Bounty Hunter and having fun with a challenge, but instead killing people who stand 0 chance against them? 
---
Because they fucking suck at what they do so they get off by being big and bad by being trash. It‚Äôs the equivalent of a level 126 maxed Chad going into F2P and telling all the noobs how shit they are. 
---
Also remember to vote no to pvp polls!
---
Approximately 1:10000 ratio, carriers to carried. Why do something for free when you could also get paid?

Yup, black graceful when it comes out. Getting more tempted just to recolor it to white every day.

You‚Äôre not even saying anything of substance here? You just don‚Äôt want to realize that left leaning subs are cancerous circles jerks in their own right or something

Or just use total worlds. You'll never see beggars on 2k total worlds.

Either friends, alts or gp to pay for the help.

So you're saying right wing ideas on a sub filled with Democrats get downvoted? Who woulda thunk it.

I got banned from the Donald for asking a simple question, ‚Äúrepublicans market themselves as conservatives, that being said how can anybody claim that trump is a conservative?‚Äù  Banned immediately. I trash Republicans, Democrats, and capitalism on politics and world news yet I‚Äôve never even begin warned by them.

Technically it was like 500 brand new. But accounting for wear and tear over 8 years I would say it's about the same if not a bit worse because of overheating issues. A newer one should perform better.  I also have a notebook that runs rs pretty decently too. You are right that it doesn't run at 60 on anything but mobile I think. However he can certainly get more then 17 fps. There is a runelite plugin that helps more fps though
---
Yup along with flower and you'll keep hitting 0 so the pker can't jump you
---
I never said it was wrong or right just pointing out this hypocritical argument people like to bring up. And are you dense ? Obama deported more illegals than any other president ever and the policy of separating the children and parents was introduced by Clinton that‚Äôs why I know it was practised for 8 years under Obama. And btw how do you know there never were more than 10 000 detained children ? Either show evidence or stop exaggerating to make a point :&gt;

The biggest hurdle would be people losing their shit at what they paid for rapier then getting a better version for free from dungeoneering. Everyone mentioning that it's available in rs3 is still ignoring how much the community loves the insane amount of reskinned or directly copied content that's been brought into osrs from rs3

Low tier bait
---
We already have dungeoneering it's just not a skill. They could retroactively make it skill if the community really wants it. Bit of an odd thing to do though.

Sea Shanty 2 is mid-tier. Even Sea Shanty 1 is better, imo.

/r/t_d is mega trigger happy on bans. Not saying that makes /r/politics any better, just saying they're both 100% safe spaces
---
Heaven forbid somebody have to actually work for some item rather than being able to buy it through other means. RS is one of the only games I can think of where you can just straight up buy the best gear rather than having to actually obtain it yourself.
---
This is exactly right üòÇ
---
Keep going until it turns into RS3, not a single person actually willing to fight someone who will fight back. Take everyone who might actually be interested in real PVP, and set them to just ganks skillers and PVMers who risk nothing anyway.
---
You do realize all the top RC'ers in the game all had runners, right? I literally had 200 or more runners every day. I never once did an actual run myself.
---
If you dislike the idea of paying people to help you level skills, don't play MMO's, or play ironman. Just because you're not happy with it doesn't mean there is something wrong with it.
---
F2P has been a demo ever since osrs. Runescape and OSRS are very different games. OSRS was released with NO f2p mode

This isn't OP.
---
&gt; People are just up in arms because it's change.
---
That's fine though? If people don't want it to change then the JMods should listen. It doesn't have any effect on gameplay so if it's a change that people dislike then it's just a waste of effort to do.
---

---
Awesome man, glad I could help you see another side. When people are open to the idea at least, it opens up more room for conversation about the actual content itself. I definitely don't like everything proposed, but personally I *do* like the idea of breaking down items, crafting new magic armors, and moving imbues to this skill. When it comes to the hard details like how good will those items be, how will it affect current BiS and other items, I don't know but I think it can be implemented in a way that doesn't disrupt other items too much.
---
Does calc work on mobile?
---
Nobody is gonna go to the permanent wards tho, people will just draw wards at ge and train there.
---
Oh are those talismans obtained through combat only? I thought maybe chaos could be obtained through random events or something, but I have no idea really.
---
Nothing needs to be a new skill, sailing and dungeoneering can be mini games, summoning could be a spell book, artisan could be a guild revamp. That doesn‚Äôt mean it should fail because of that though.
---
sure, but again how do you enforce that? what are you going to do about it?
---
obviously runelite won't mess with jagex, but someones personal modded runelite client which he shares with other people?

pretty sure lyzrds gets more pressure from runelite devs than jagex, idk if theyve even acknowledged it.

Most the people you gave stuff to are probably not new players but instead old players that prey on others kindness.  Next time you see a a "noob" begger at the GE I implore you to add them to friends so you can see what world they hop to and they will be begging for the same item/amount of gold they just got in their first world.  
---
For example there was a guy begging for an obby cape while I was training fletching.  I saw him thank someone for giving him the cape and then log out about 30 seconds later tohop to a different world.  He forgot to turn his friends chat to private so I added him and followed him.  Within seconds he was typing the same thing begging for an obby cape.  I followed him to like 8 different worlds telling people he had already got the item before he turns his private off.
---
New players don't beg for items they just play the game.  They might ask for an odd-ball item they can't find but if someone is asking for something specific (that tends to be a "noob" item like a warrior ring or obby cape) they are hoping someone takes the bait and either gives them the item they are asking for, which will add up after a while, or does something like you did and gives them a basic kit of like rune + weapon and/or a decent amount of coins.
---
oh, true. sry, im used to rings bein gutter tier price but theyve gone up in the last year or two.
---
Noob pker here. Not even a few months ago me and a couple friends would go out in cheap gear, find someone at one of the 3 big wildy bosses and try to kill them. Was a good time, and eventually you run i to another group of 3 and you have a mini clan battle.
---
I do thjnk there could be some more added fun though. Ive gone back and forth, but i vote for longer entangle duration on normal spellbook to make normals pking viable in singles
---
I liked that there was a BiS that didn't require millions/billions of GP to attain as well. Unfortunately, I never got any of the chaotics. EoC dropped soon after I got into the skill, and I quit outright after that.
---
All worth it when you get the cape though. Biggest feeling of achievement I've had since I started playing osrs
---
I see no harm, in fact I think it would improve free to play. It's just that it's failed to pass multiple times now.
---
You don't get banned unless you are being insufferable, but it is a downvote brigade there for conservatives.
---
But just to dabble with your logic, just because something is transparently a rule doesn't make it better. If politics made it a rule to ban conservatives from commenting, that would be much worse than allowing the sub-viewers to decide for themselves the merit of a comment.
---
That‚Äôs one way to look at it ya
---
Funny way to spell true when there is literally multiple pieces of evidence throughout this thread.

How is Raids a skill?

---
Barrows armour gets quite costly.
---
They do a decent job but the general rule of thumb is no one ever bothers to read the retraction/correction notices. But when you have a publication that's clearly anti-trump (I'm willing to bet most of the staff are liberals) make these mis-steps, you create a perception they did it on purpose by putting politics over ethics. 
---
I don't personally don't think the NYT is any more egregious than the other publications though FYI.
---
True
---
There is much more to learn from this website.
---
First off, you need to start over if you haven't played OSRS before. Your old account will still be there on RS3, if you can recover it. You can used to log into OSRS, but you'll be at Tutorial Island. 
---
&gt; Is there a way to speak to someone directly about recovering my account
---
Nope. You won't be able to verify your identity as the account creator to Jagex that way and therefore they're unable to help you. 
---
&gt; should I just keep trying using the system on the site?
---
Yes, that is the only way to recover the account. Well, unless you can remember and access the registered email of that account.
---
Ruby bolts e man... I had around 70ish range when I did this. It's not hard, just takes some time to get used to.
---
If a dude could afford that would he really be a noob?

My pure got it at 27, only took 2 levels on a stall. I did the first 25 levels with pickpocket. Was pumped.

I wish people stopped recommending Twitter. Jagex is unable to help players on Twitter, as they can't verify their identity as the account creator. All they do is basically link their support page.
---
Then you still have a bandos item
---
I always report beggars/panhandlers for "disruptive behavior" just because lol, while they end up on my ignore list after the report. 
---
Theres also a ton different ways people fake being a noob in hopes of receiving hand outs, that its borderline deceitful/scamming. 
---
I know the reports do nothing, but no harm no foul. I find them disruptive though!
---
No such spoiler blinders on mobile.

I dont think that shit skill should lock you out of half the diaries, but here we are.
---
Dungeoneering. This comment chain is about dungeoneering.
---
You‚Äôre getting upvoted a lot but ignore them, what you said is wrong.
---
Dungeoneering and fun in the same sentence? Maybe for a few runs. But it is complete aids when you want to grind it to 99, or to 120 if you are a maniac.
---
Yeah I edited in a second quote that I saw when I took a screenshot of the first one in case he deleted it haha.
---
But agreed. And that's far from the worst thing he believes from looking at only a short period of comments.
---
Hell yeah man. Gz, the first time is always exhilarating.

Bursts, Barrages and Chins are next on the chopping block boys. Everyone get that xp while you still can

So the story: I was doing Zulrah and some dude asked if I could bring him 2 recoils because he was out... Next kill went really smooth and then this drop came... I wasn't expecting it at all.... Still a bit shocked at 81 KC...

Are you fucking kidding me man?!?!?

Everyone knows Baroque is hands down the best song in RuneScape.
---
I don't mean to be a music snob, but seriously, wtf are you thinking?!?!?!
---
(back in the day I was really hoping they'd add Linkin Park to the soundtrack)
---
&gt; Remember when people cried about runelite getting banned? Yeah, this is one of the reasons. Runelite has made private clients and plugins a lot easier to develop.
---
That wasn't the reason at all for runelite getting "banned". They were warned/banned for sharing IP of Jagex on a public forum. Jagex quite literally has to tell them not to or they open themselves up to a lot of legal issues in the future.
---
That being said, it also doesn't make it easier (by much), as you could already find everything you needed to develop a client in the back alleys of the internet and if you're making a useful, functional addon for a client, you could likely figure out how to add it to whatever client you want.

Yesteryear uber allies.
---
At high farming levels you average 8+ herbs per patch so you begin turning massive profits on Ranarr
---
At lower levels you will break even or lose money when one of your patches dies, or when you only get 6 herbs from a patch. I recommend Avantoe or Toadflax at lower levels, as you make slightly less profit but the profit is much more consistent as the seeds are cheap. 
---
Also even at low levels you can still do ranarrs at ‚Äúbetter‚Äù patches ie the ones that can‚Äôt get diseased like Hosidius, or the Catherby patch with the diary bonus
---
You realize that was an Obama era policy right?
---
Nope. I don't know how popular it is now, but people would and I'm sure still do speed run Dungeoneering. Literally all you had to do was have the Dungeoneering level required to do their set of floors they chose to run and while you can leech and afk, you're expected to be paying attention because if the runner calls for you guys to do something you need to be quick as it is a speedrun. At the same time, all you and the other 3 leechers have to do is I believe enter the boss room once it was dead to leave and not fuck up puzzles that require more then 1 person.
---
They wanted to speed run and get fast times, their payment is essentially you enabling the 5 man scaling on the floors while they play solo. It's still faster to pay someone to leech as they'd usually do 2 or 3 man carries so the floors are faster, but it's expensive.
---
i think the most fundamental difference between raids and dungeoneering is that in dung you had 
---
1. actual branching paths with decisions to make as to who went where, 
---
2. not everyone could open each door, so who went where actually mattered, and
---
3. the majority of your time was spent navigating the dungeon, not killing the final boss (as opposed to raids 1 where olm is &gt;50% of the time and raids 2 where it's just boss rush)
---
i think the fact that the raids we have in osrs and completely linear and everyone does basically the same thing in each room makes them way less of an appealing piece of content than dung was. i think there's a lot of huge differences but imo these are the ones that feel the biggest. and i agree that raids could be made more similar to dung, yes. but the ones we have so far aren't much alike.
---
This but unironically
---
I was alching battlestaves while doing Seer's, so it was decent money for what I wanted to train

I think it's be something like

"The zulrah you've been facing is actually only a young child, after killing it's child you awaken the wrath of mother zulrah"

Can‚Äôt tell if bait or federal
---
I have no problems with them existing, or being high tier, or being an amazing unique useful item like Ava's Accumulator - but I think better alternatives need to exist for the most part. To me the player driven economy (largely supported by gear) is one of the major iconic aspects of Runescape that doesn't really exist in most other games.
---
I can absolutely agree to disagree, and I'm just glad you're a reasonable person not trying to shout me into the ground for having a different opinion!

It has nothing to do with the context it's the fact that he flipped flopped out of nowhere.

Isn't that what the point of that Gauntlet shit is going to be? You go in, collect resources, craft shift, get loot, etc. After your run is done, you go back to step 1.

I mean, I imagine it'll quickly become repetitive especially if there isn't anything worth doing it for but still.

Dungeoneering isn‚Äôt a skill, it‚Äôs a minigame.

first off and probably the most controversial.. the mexicans are rapist comments, he was talking about the coyotes who smuggle women and children across the us Mex border and sexually assault them while doing so, media made it out to be that he said "all Mexicans are rapist" but that wasnt what he said.
---
Secondly, the socialism doesnt work bit; nothing is free, someone somewhere has to spend time and effort to make products or services that a bunch of people deem a human right. everything has to be paid for and the individual should have to work for what they have.
---
third, the Russian collusion bit; we have sources and evidence that prove that the opposing party (the democrats) were actually working with Russia and other foreign actors; the FBI which was full of obama cabinet apointees were texting eachother about an insurance plan in case trump won to take him down (not necessarily impeachment, but essentially filibustering him through a fake hoax is good enough)  also they are finding out that Hillary clinton committed felonies when she had the unsecured email server with government classified documents on it; and that obama knew about it yet did nothing. remember the democrats have accepted donations from russian sources through their "charities" while in office.
---
tldr; i dont like trump but i keep up with the news from both sides and it is obvious that this is a cover up aimed at taking him down because they lost the election.
---
Plus can get IP from teamspeak and forums anyways
---
I like that idea a lot. 
---
Or there'll be a kye dropped by Zulrah you need enter the abyss of mother Zulrah.
---
I have never traded anyone in the game since the G.E. came out. I would recommend you do the same. Anyone trying to trade at the G.E. or a PvP world is scamming.
---
Also, never drop an item and don't play games with anyone. Antiscamming also doesn't work, they will win.

They could start by giving xp based on runes crafted, aka 2x air runes at lvl whatever would also give 2x XP from said air runes. Maybe scale it, I haven't done the math and can't say whether the xp rates would go up too highi
---
Should check the moneymaking wiki.
---
Been done playing for a while and wanting to get back into it. This just motivated me to do some questing. Thanks!
---
ew nice
---
You can loot pkers left overs in revenant caves, all you need is a burning amulet, an amulet of glory and a loot bag. You can up tp 1m/h there doƒüng this without any requirement. Do that but dont bring anything else.
---
Yea, I stopped playing a lot near that time. The first time I quit for an extended period of time was when they multiplied health and damage by 10. Looking back, it's not actually a bad idea. It's not what made me quit, but it was just one more thing that Runescape had done that showed it was moving in a different direction than the game I enjoyed for so long. 
---
I'm not sure when this happened tbh. I quit again around the time they multiplied damage and health by 10 again, but I *think* this was right around the time, or just shortly before EoC was being introduced as an idea, and later in beta form.
---
3 runners would be x3 your normal rates which is what you said. If that‚Äôs not what you meant then fair enough

You either get f2p with hella ads or the f2p you play is meant to be trial for the p2p. Game companies aren‚Äôt funded by charity atm. They need a source of revenue.

---
&gt;like (previous) passwords 
---
There have been at max 1 previous password + the current password. Which I did a password reset on because I couldn't remember it. That is on me.  
---
&gt;None of this is proof to Jagex. They won't be able to confirm any of it  because it's all third-party stuff. There is nothing on Jagex's system  to verify it. Other than the email itself, which you can't access. 
---
Except that this is a valid form of login, and since I have previous reset mails on my email account, is proof that it was ONCE linked, that is important. The fact that I own that mail, **is** important.  
---
It's about building a complete picture, if my old password is where this ticket starts and ends, the additional information is completely useless, why even bother to include it in the first place. 
---
&gt; If you can't provide enough evidence to verify your identity as the account owner, then they're unable to help you.
---
Which isn't true, since as you stated earlier it is instantly flagged because of the password question 1/2 right, thus they never see the rest of the EXTREMELY relevant information such as Region, ISP, Login Date. That doesn't seem right. I **can** provide enough evidence, I'm just gated by the password, and since the system doesn't have a security question, phone number or similar practiced recovery methods this is pretty damn weak.  
---
If Jagex is unable to help me out getting my account back, I can be fine with that as long as they un-link **my** email account as the login mail so I can make a new account using that mail address. If we are playing with the scenario that someone that is not me is using my email for their account, then I should be able to contact support about that, but I can't.

rune dragon alts are actually like 2.2m/h, so thatd be over 25m/h

---
You're using your own fallacies against me. Bye bitch.
---
Nice bait
---
Honestly why are you even able to get combat xp from pvp/within a poh
---
as dumb as this sounds most bots are good for us, the rs2 bot nuke killed literally every single minigame, butchered the prices and much more, it wouldve been better if they just left the bots there.
---
r.i.p stealing creation i still miss you.
---
in a perfect world we would have 200k real daily players, in reality tho we have like 40k at best with the rest being bots if not even more of them being bots, it would kill the game.
---
You don't use the ring, you do the dungeon.
---
and yes, MM2 tunnels. 350-400k mage exp/hr, 800k-1m range exp/hr
---
it's not a requirement tho

All his alts are purple meaning he got the twitch benefits on all of those so probably didn't even pay membership for those for the week. That's what must of rattled Jagex to hotfix this lol
---
Agreed, it's refreshing to see isn't it?
---
Sounds like a lot of work. I got maxed melee the old fashioned way: overnight AFK @ nightmare zone with guthans.
---
Idk how it happened but it is 100% your fault this happened. It could be as easy as using the same password elsewhere, or having your email address compromised through a leak. It is not Jagex‚Äôs problem and they should never return items, they give you all the tools and knowledge to keep yourself and your account secure, it‚Äôs your problem when you don‚Äôt use that info to your advantage.
---
Well it's been 4 years... Yout had your time to learn Zulrah, I guess.
---
Imagine you kill little Zulrah after the big one gets released... What a noob.
---
I can't believe this guy is actually legit. It is definitely impossible for jagex to increase the drop rate for any individual player.... Do you think each character has some sort of Luck stat, that they implemented just to give a few individual players an easier time?  
---
I'll tell you what is way more likely than that. You've gone a little dry on a drop, and now you've come to reddit to complain...

Dude when I was going for the elite kandarin diaries I was thinking about buying it through ba services. Then I saw how expensive it was, like wtf. It wasn‚Äôt even that bad to do.

I‚Äôm not sure I exactly understand this comment but I don‚Äôt act why anyone cares about the ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù of combats when I can tap my phone 3 times an hour for 100k/h
---
They only start development after a piece of content passes the polls. They also test all content with high level PvMers and streamers so they can be sure that the community will enjoy it. 
---
&gt; Even for the Inferno poll, high end pvmers did not know exactly want to expect other than a hardest pvm content ever.
---
That's a positive, not a negative. Jagex didn't fail to deliver the 'hardest pvm content ever'. If everyone knew exactly what to expect then the content wouldn't be very exciting, with the surprise getting ruined. New PvM content also serves as an important item and gold sink, which is great for the OSRS economy.
---
&gt;That's why I said to have beta servers to test out the pvm content to all players get an informed impression of it before voting.
---
Why should all players test out difficult content to judge the difficulty? Someone with 1000 hours of bossing will definitely find it easier than someone with barely any actual bossing experience outside of quests. If your bossing experience is only 300 barrows kc compared to someone who did 4000 solo raids, your opinion should have less weight to it. Obviously a new player that's only 1000 total will say no to it because they think it's impossible, but players like Kelvino, Woox, xZact, Lake, etc. will say yes because they have the experience to know how to beat the challenge. 
---
Anyways, I'm done replying to you seeing as you probably don't even play the game. Git gud, scrub.

Wait people are actually against ess running?  I thought that was a meme.

I‚Äôm so confused. What are they doing?
---
With your logic StarCraft2 is the funnest game in existence??? If the extra shit that you add isn't fun then complicating your game with different shitty mechanics and spells doesn't make the game more fun. The momentum mechanic is extremely stupid and boring and doesn't make for more fun gameplay. Sure it might add a little depth into the game, but it isn't making the game more enjoyable to play.
---
Its not a bug. Just hop worlds until she‚Äôs there.

True expensive is subjective as someone who started 2 months ago and just hit 15m bank it‚Äôs out of my budget for the time being

Repost...

Unique drop: offhand blowpipe. You can dual weild blowpipes for double the dps, breaking the game and making every weapon inferior to it.
---
Sure it does. Unless you're doing something like RC where you're running 95% of the time, or something like fishing where you're idle for 95% of the time, you'll benefit from increased energy recharge‚Äîand even then, you still benefit from shortcuts.
---
Congrats dude!
---
yes yes thanks for pointing out its fucked up u can do that, thats not a reason to allow 1.2m methods.
---
I love video games as much as the next guy but video game addiction is absolutely prevalent in a game like RuneScape and is linked to anxiety and depression and can negatively affect other aspects of your life. I‚Äôm in doubt that Woodworking or learning the piano or collecting coins or going canoeing can lead to those things.
---
I really wish dungeonering (however it‚Äôs spelled) was in OSRS. Even if it‚Äôs not a skill, the game mode is just fun
---

Well since no one is doing it it quite apparently is minimal enough to not be deemed worth it. So it doesn't really matter how you try to spin it
---
Another repost
---
&gt; Read this article on the subject. It is clearly stated that b0 = 1 for all b, including b = 0
---
That's a wikipedia article, that might as well have been written by a 3rd grade english teacher :p
---
You can do some super basic proofs to show that 0^0 is undefined:
---
1 = x^0 = x^(1-1) = x^1 / x^1 = x/x = 1
---
But if x = 0, that would mean that 0/0 would have to = 1, which it obviously does not. What we can do is use L'Hopital's rule to show that lim x -&gt; 0, x^0 = 1, which can be functionally useful. You can also check lim x -&gt; 0, 0^x, which is a complex infinitive from the left and 0 from the right. That's the reason why there is no exact standard for 0^0, but is most often treated as 1.

There‚Äôs literally nothing in conservative ideology which prevents weed from being used. Just because some old skeleton aipac golems in Congress want to prevent people from smoking weed doesn‚Äôt mean I need to.

Considering the amount of backlash and hate they get for suggesting change, I'd probably be demotivated to give those people my time. 
---
I think the PvP community has a lot of growing up to do before anything can be changed. Not everyone can get their way, or get changes they want.. you guys cannot seem to grasp that.
---
Kinda sad that this is one of the only places on reddit outside of T_D where you can say shit like that and not get banned
---
Did this actually happen? Looks shopped but i see mod acorn so maybe?
---
There doesn‚Äôt need to be a max cake variant of every cape. The scarcity of the champs cape should be enough motivation as is imo
---
&gt;I remember people on tip.it in 08/09 talking about training in the PoH with D2H specs and getting very high exp/hr, this method isn't exactly new.
---
I was one of those people, loads of pures would get together and d2h spec each other for massive strength xp.
---
And that makes it not a problem how?
---
There's absolutely no logic in that "all or nothing" reasoning.
---
Teaks if done with tick manipulation are like almost 5x faster. Just do redwoods if you don‚Äôt plan on tick manipulating imo. They‚Äôre still slower than teaks, but not by much and much more afk.
---
If we had the bot team of rs3, bots would have a hard time.

Gnome Village

i agree to an extent but there‚Äôs like 6000 max capes and less than 1000 champ so having both is the ultimate flex

---
Yo i fucking hate that Little Mermaid ripped boss design. Shit is legit ugly

You have such an ironic tag lmao. Against easy scale but in favor of nerfing high effort methods. Let‚Äôs all go back to doing fortnite zone for combats because it‚Äôs balanced and anyone with a 5m bank can do it

I mean... if somebody has 12 accounts that have done lunars...dont they deserve it? That's a shit ton of time.

Wait... Can you flick mithril dragons? I always assumed the prayer worked like most other monsters where you had to have the correct prayer up when the animation starts (before you can see what style it is). Are they one of the unique situations where it actually calculates it when it hits the player?
---
Regardless of if it is good that's not what he said.
---
people did it before for fun but yeah they would bot green drags instead if all they wanted is money.
---
Ah, this must be it. Had no idea. Thanks!
---
Is that a self diagnoses?
---
I love it
---
I am using overloads, but I guess since they were continually hitting me it didn't matter. Thanks!
---
Let‚Äôs just nerf all moneymakers too. A turbovirgin could do rune dragons on 40 accounts and make what, 60m per hour? That‚Äôs not intended, let‚Äôs get rid of it.
---
You leech? I just 24/7 botted it and never got banned.

Yeah I‚Äôm the 15 year old because you go on chatlogs and use racial slurs. That definitely adds up

What was the lure? I can help you with a few mil

Who cares, it requires a shit ton of money and you need more than just one runner to achieve 200k rc xp/hr.

I fucking wish I had one

Can you do most high level content on mobile? My pc recently broke
---
It wouldn't be very viable for anywhere outside of PoH. Close proximity to spec pool is what makes this method. You could still do it in wildy or clan wars, but those spec restore trips + resetting alts would be a pretty big pain and reduce xp/hr significantly.
---
I got banned for TD for explaining that the holocaust happened because of beliefs that one race was inferior than the other. 
---
The post I commented on claimed that the holocaust happened of gun regulations. 
---
TD and politics are both pointless echo chambers that everyone should avoid.
---
So right now the bis for pures are regen/combat/mith gloves. If you could not get exp from quests, you could then get barrows gloves, which would be a pretty big step I think. 
---
Right now if you are 1Pray, you can't get Ava's. If you want Ava's you need a min of 15 pray, so that is also a new BIS for pures.
---
I'm sure there are some other ones too.
---
+1 for this

I flipped so many of them when they released. That was fun

Man I hope this is a joke.

I see

Someone in my Rs3 clan actively does speedruns as described above, and I was even apart of one of those runs. He was disappointed when someone crafted runes because he that didn't get the guy a "leech" status, voiding his run. So,
---
"Ahahahahahahha"?
---
This is a honest argument to someone who said that dung is was not a skill and just a mini game. Who cares, it was fun as fuck.
---
Specing his alts with chally which does area damage and then getting spec. Basically gives insane xp/hr for melee. Think of it has chinning or barraging but for melee and much easier with zero costs except your time.
---
Instead of typing "how do I deiron" into the title, try typing it into Google.

I always hop if I get crashed, arguing is entirely pointless and I'm not going to waste my time engaging in petty acts of disruption.
---
I don't, however, understand why people crash. I can almost always find an empty world in seconds. Surely it's more efficient to hop a few worlds to find an empty world than risk an argument and potential disruption?
---
If people enjoy getting a reaction out of others that's fair enough but in most cases crashing doesn't seem all that worth it.
---
Generally speaking, they like to avoid designing content that's in RS3 because you can play it in RS3.
---
It‚Äôs not about heating power...it‚Äôs about ventilation.
---
I don't really mind the concept of ess runners in general, it's only a problem with zmi because zmi gives 2x exp per ess compared to other altars. Zmi running never existed in pre eoc due to there being no free trade. Essence runners at the nature altar for example were never a problem, since the max xp rates cap out similarly to lava runecrafting. Zmi runners are uniquely bad because they've only been viable now, unlike nature/law runners which have been around forever.
---
the weak should fear the strong
---
No one is stopping you from stepping up your game and matching my 6 man alt army. Step up or shut up. I do the work required to maintain them, you aren't willing too and instead bitch to Mommy and Daddy about how it's unfair that I'm willing to be a sweatier nerd than _you_. How narcicistic can you get to tell me It's MY problem?
---
The only way I see myself playing again is starting over 100%. I just can‚Äôt see myself grinding for all that stuff all over again. I am probably just gonna take a break for a while and see what‚Äôs up. Idk man. That is why I kind of want to get rid of everything, a total loss can be better than a partial one.
---
No and tbh the only ones you do get loot off of have become scarce. 
---
Noted bones used to be an actual method but then some big brain figured out you can just single inventory and suicide with black dhide and bank in PvP worlds at spawn. 
---
You can usually do an entire inventory of bones on the altar while getting PK‚Äôd if anyone ever even touches you. 
---
It‚Äôs just not a good spot anymore. If someone gets PK‚Äôd then next round of bones on the altar breaks them even. So they don‚Äôt really feel risk doing single inventory and world hopping. 
---
It‚Äôs a really big waste of time. You can potentially get 20k off someone on their way to the altar but it‚Äôs like.... idk why bother.
---
afaik at 85 range youll never be better off using void with a bp. at like 88 or 89 onwards, void has 2  max hits over dhide in which case you'd use it.
---
this is just off the top of my head though. on mobile or id calc myself.
---
What do you not like about T\_D? Other than the fact that everyone says its bad, or that you disagree with Trump
---
Aight thanks
---
It's a minigame Jamflex didn't want to die.
---
Dunepneering is still the same game, slightly different as I remember the combat triangle being a major part of fast runs. You would need to craft runes to even have a chance to hit those warriors. Not you just need a 2 hander
---
Hackers: writes bday down.

;)
---
I did it with 70 range and a rune c‚Äôbow and void (because I‚Äôm broke) and beat him my first try. I feel like the rune dragon was harder.
---
Any news on what skills will be used for it?

That's highest I've seen tbh

That time was so much fun

It was the most realistic, nobody really knew the best way to get the best items in the world

Pretty much, trade me in a safe zone.  Then my character started running backwards and get killed at the doorway. I didn‚Äôt know something like that could happen. I thought I was safe.

Dungeoneering is the only thing I ever decide to play rs3 for. If it was in old school I could finally ditch that shitshow for good.
---
Who's blaming the current 2007 game?
---
&gt; The power is in the hands of the people that want to leech
---
Definitely not. I'd suggest you just go into "free leech" fc and check it out yourself. It's almost always near full, but doesn't always have even 1 person actually carrying.
---
This really isn't something up for debate, you can just go look for yourself :p

---
Alright, thank you so much! I got void yesterday and kinda wanna use it so I guess it‚Äôs time to get my range up before I start farming vork
---
Thank you for not being an idiot, I mean this sincerely. Far too often do we see reddit flooded with people bashing the other side. Be it the pvp community complaining about pvp polls and taking it out on the pvmers, or pvmers crying toxicity in an area where they knew the risk they took. 
---
I do however believe that the wilderness needs to be improved upon. Something to get people out and engaging with each other. fighting other players is fun and all, but I feel there should be some bigger picture put in place aside from simply doing it to get other people‚Äôs items. If there was some sort of pvp grind involved that would open up new pieces of content, I feel that you‚Äôd see a lot more pvmers learning how to fight other players. 
---
Player versus player skill rating, with certain resource areas locked behind rating would be neat. Though you‚Äôd likely just see clans running the show and turning it into some kind of extortion of average players.

Thanks for the silver!
