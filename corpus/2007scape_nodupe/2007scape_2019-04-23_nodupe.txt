Words change meanings and gay used to mean many other things before it meant homosexual.
---

---
Why should the LGBTQ community get to hold language hostage when it's not even being used to talk about homosexuality? It's like if white people suddenly got in a fit about the word cracker and demanded all crackers to now be called dried flour wafers or whatever else.
---
Of course nobody would take that seriously because "white privilege", but when a minority does it it's totally fine and we should be more sympathetic to accidentally hurting their feelings when we're not even talking about them at all.
---
Unpopular opinion I guess.

Assuming you have MouseKeys activated in Windows, simply hitting the 5 Key on the Numpad will register a left click. I would have a cheap USB keyboard leading under my desk. It would be connected to a laptop at my side while I used my computer in front of me. All I did was mash the block that I glued to it using my big toe.
---
You could do it without the block. Block just made it easy so I wasnt blindly searching for the key.

No, this post is stupid. If you jump on another player's vein, you have no clue how long before it depletes. Picking a newly spawned vein will be more afk because you know it hasn't been mined yet.

You can buy 30 a day for no loss in gp. If setting records then buy like 120. Which is 240k xp which would take long.
---
Treat smithing like farming and 90 to 99 smithing is good profit.
---
I always wanted another monitor but don't have any space for it. My desk was custom built in like 2005, so the space for the monitor is like 19 inches wide and it's walled in on both sides (with a cabinet taking up the other half of the desk, with the modem/router beneath it). We just haven't bothered replacing the desk I guess, would be a pain to fit a new one in the same spot.
---
19 inches is 48.26 cm
---
more larger bosses should have that mechanic. it just makes sense.
---
With mobile existing I'll never get this attitude. Like I don't get it to begin with but autism is a special kinda thing.
---
Just pick up a phone, lose 2 seconds to log onto it, continue smithing at EHP rates while pooping, showering, preparing food, heck even up until you pass out from exhaustion and sleep.
---
Mobile helped these kinda idiots out and here they are sitting at a desk in their own shit smh

If three people are mining individual ores, then when those deplete there are two fewer ores for you all to move to. If they do it again then there are six ores down where there would only be two if everyone was on the same ore.
---
If everyone stays on the same ore then when it depletes you can all move down the line to the next one, leaving a more consistent line of ore for everybody.
---
Which one did you use?

There is a reason why I didn't do the example as 1000 and why I I said ge limit of 30 per day. But also spending 5 bil for a speed run up front to only lose a few hundred mil max isn't unreal. It's like doing darts for fetching and do dragon darts. It isn't feasible but it can be done for a record. Even if not the whole thing like fetching you can do some to give you an edge that someone when challenging you won't be able to break.

How many waterskins do you usually bring for lava mining?

I used a foot pedal for at least 8m xp and use an Xbox controller regularly. I don't think there is really any worry or even any way for them to know you're using a foot pedal... Its basically just a single key keyboard as far as your computer is concerned. Are you sure you didn't do something more than just setting it to left click and esc?

It's quite simple, jump over things, get very small amounts of exp. What is there not to love?

Is it generally recommended to plant your own seeds or buy sprouted saplings from the GE if both arent very highly traded?

i mean the difference between them in price is pretty negligible imo, probably just worth buying the saplings.

---
Reading this made me sweaty
---
I was thinking this too. You focus too much on the end game, money, but with this in mind you go for completion of the game instead and is a really relaxed way to play the game, and you progress just as fast as others just at a different angle. I wouldn't cut quest guides out though or buying the required items from the GE, it's still a modest approach to the game.

there was a period of time in osrs history where jacmob left the rsbuddy (bot client) team and went to work at jagex as anti cheat. for a couple years there, rs had legitimately no bots. he had the whole thing down to a science since he literally wrote the biggest bot client in game.
---
since he left, we haven't had nearly the same success with anti-cheat specialists.
---
You get the blade stuck in the boss, and get to keep the hilt (which is untradeable) for free. You can then combine the zarosian godsword with darklight, to create "starlight" which if it hits, deals holy damage to demons at 1 per second until they die.

You start with magic so your inventory should be:

- your ranged gear switch in whatever order you like

-antivenom potion, range potion, prayer/super restore
---
-good food + karams for combo eats
---
-teleports to restore you health/prayer and to return, there's different methods so I'll just let you choose
---
im sorry but what makes u think pures dont bring restores

Why exactly did he poop his pants

Ah ok, so how does that relate to pvp and $11? Sry I don‚Äôt know a whole lot

Only 300k in alchables and gold.

Not true, I lost access to my email address that I created the account with (forgot the password) so I recovered the account and changed the email address, but I still have to use the old email address to log in. Meaning my current email address is the one use for all correspondence with jagex, but the old one is my log in email. OP stated that he recovered the account and changed the password, so I can see how possible.

What is the point of all of us?

On the braziers lmao

I currently have 75 attack, 75 strength, and 70 defense. When should I stop focusing on strength training and train attack and/or defense again? Or should I just train strength until 99 and then train attack, then defense?
---
How much did that cost? I believe I have around 23m in oak planks banked. If it's not too much more I might do that instead.

I think it's a bit too late for this. It was already suggested prerelease of the tbow and the idea was rejected.

That said, not every dead content item needs to be given a use. Just let it be a RP lore relic

he's got hp xp proportionate to the strength though, and his week record is just as ridiculous
---
You're not the the first to suggest this idea, and it was even brought up multiple times before the tbow even released.
---
What is it that I described, in exact detail, because I think you think I said one thing, when I definitely said another. When I said you can randomize the clicking down to tens of thousands of a second you could say something like .375787 to 6373848 it will click once, that way it doesn't look like a clear and awkward never more than X or less than Y type of interval, and you could even randomize this further, that every X clicks, it uses a new randomized algorithm and so on, indefinitely. You could even code it to randomize based on arbitrary information like what your current exp is and divide it out. The possibilities are literally endless, and if you think how often a bot clicks on something is why they get caught you're high and have no idea what's actually going on. Humans will in almost all cases click more often than bots do, which is why some botters literally code their stuff to be less efficient.
---
Randomizing a click for say thieving you're going to use something like every .3-.6 seconds you'll do an interaction. It will use any random time between those .3 seconds, into the tens of millions of seconds, of course that isn't really relevant.
---
A human doing quick clicks over and over with about 2-3 clicks per second, and you think a bot doing the same would be more detectable as cheating than the human?
---
I'm all for education, so please feel free to explain the logic.
---
No no no no
---
Your account value is now increased, congratulations
---
I like this idea. You could trade your items you don't need for items you do need, it's genius
---
cant be assed
---
Like watching CP videos?
---
I absolutely will in fact judge
---
why'd he have a Kodai wand for raids 1?
---
I used one for 55-99 thieving at ardy knights. There is an ironman in my clan that did it to 200 mil. You did something else and are trying to blame it on the pedal. There is literally no way that they can detect you are using a different input device.

I got base 80s once I got 90 strength, and then I blasted out 99 str from there. It depends on what you wanna do though. If there's content that requires you to have a certain attack level, it's up to you if you wanna be inefficient and train the skills that don't increase your melee xp/h. I don't think it's that inefficient though, an extra max hit only gave me a 4k boost in xp/h at NMZ

Ppl did point this out in the original thread.
---
But your main wep options are retarded. Can't use tent or whip because of attack and controlled xp, so you gotta use a d scim just like a 60 attack anyways, or a leaf baxe or a abby dagger. I have a 60 attack Zerker and until I have spare gp laying around for a second rapier, it'll stay that way.

You either don‚Äôt raid or pvp if you don‚Äôt get this. Both pvp and high risk worlds have ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù messaged before hopping to them and if the player is used to skipping this they will be desensitized when the pvp message pops up and won‚Äôt even read it

---
Maybe I'm losing my mind, but being 'NOT sure that it does NOT qualify' is a double negative meaning that you think shitting your pants on purpose does or may qualify as a medical condition...    
---
Like, take both of the 'not's out since they cancel each other out, and you get '**I'm** ~~not~~ **sure that it does**~~n't~~ **qualify.**' Get what I'm saying?  
---
or am I reading it wrong? Was it more of a, 'I'm not sure. (Pause) It doesn't qualify.' type situation and my brain is just squashing it all together into one thought since there's no punctuation or anything there?

To build off of this: 
---
- Agility pyramid is good for making low level Ironman gp. You can usually squeeze 200k/h there. 
---
- AFK banshees in the catacombs is great free mage xp (fire strikes) and you profit ranging with a bone crossbow. Aside from gp here you also get a lot of seeds and herbs to help with early game farming and herblore. This is a great place to afk to 70 mage and ranged. I did and it helped a lot for building up my herb stash but also for getting some annoying levels out of the way. 
---
- Get to 45 prayer ASAP.  Will help a lot with questing your account. Easiest way to do this is afk blue dragons in taverly dungeon, and use them on the wildly altar. 
---
- Slayer to train combats will yield a lot of alchs and therefore gp. Also useful to train to get items like a whip and trident to start doing some higher level PvM like Zulrah and Demonic Gorillas.

He‚Äôs got 2 99s

Some are, some aren't. I believe everything in the game is soloable. I mean, there are Ironmen who can't trade people, use the GE, or get loot from anything someone else attacked so they're basically playing single player. Only exception is they can do raids in a group and get loot. Some bosses are instanced so can only be soloed. Vorkath, Zulrah, Obor, Bryophyta, Skotizo, and some others.
---
Check out the [bosses wiki page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Boss) if you want to read about them.
---
Oh oops.
---
Still, with telegrab you can keep your untrimmed.
---
By using Runelite you authorize a 3rd party to have your email and password so you don't have much room to stand on if your account is compromised according to Jagex
---
Champion if I ever saw one
---
His own fault was not swapping to mobile
---
scythe at nechreals in catacombs with spec transfer is 300k xp/hr right? howed this guy get almost triple it wtf
---
I mean even if you're that level of sweaty it's just not worth it. Jagex's bot detection seems to be really bad for private shit, because Rank1EHP was very high up and autoclicking agility. 
---
Speedrunning scene is also the same. People hold fake World Records for years. 
---
I think these people just want to be the best and are challenge seekers. But instead of pushing those two attributes IRL they do it in games. Many of the world's greatest ideas live in the graveyard.
---
If that's the case then there is no such thing as a random number, every person is subject to influence in anything they do or say, that includes white noise, just because we don't know the source doesn't mean it isn't true.
---
More so you said this to a programmer, and this is something you literally learn as a intro to comp sci, something everybody who touches computers should and does know.
---
General knowledge is hard.
---
did you actually "play it in the OSRS sound engine", or did you recreate it from scratch using more OSRS-like sounds? If the former, please describe how. I make music and I would be really interested in running my songs "through the engine" if that's a thing. If anyone knows about this feel free to add

Nice bro. I make 100m+/hr with a certain method!

You can collect the book from the Varrock museum which lets you see kill count and rewards gained from a variety of things.

I definitely saw you at mlm a few days ago. Nice fire cape!

Surprisingly not even the worst beginner clue. I think the lowest valued one is a single steel dagger.

I forget what comedian said something along the lines of "There's people who admit they've pissed their own pants as an adult, and then there's liars."

So this dude is playing the game the way he wants? Who cares lmao as long as he‚Äôs having fun. Much better than being on of you EHP skiller nerds, that shit is fucking wack as fuck

Gold sink is always an issue and I agree we do need an item sink as well.

---
Uhh.. yeah if you check through the pics posted you'll see I bought way more than 300m in bonds lol, also I bought a rapier before I could even use it.
---
I bought all of the gear before I could use it, because bis is bis I wound up selling Arma crossbow and the tridents because they didn't mesh with my playstyle.
---
You'll also see in one of the pictures my accounts age started August 26th but yes feel free to hiscore the name 2070ish total.  
---
Also if I wanted karma, I'd stick to the crypto forums there is no need to come here randomly claim to be hacked so someone can upvote me and a jmod can dunk reply me like they did that one kid the other week.
---
Osrs was a waste of $4k+ for me in 8 months due to being hacked so I'm probably better off not playing.
---
why tho
---
The amount of people on this subreddit who are genuinely angry about someone doing this is laughable. The HLC thinks its a meme, yet the 1800 total levels on reddit are actually angry about this

Ive been playing since 06 and never thought i would have the focus or drive to actually get one. Im proud of myself for sticking to it!

You could transform that in no time. Why live like an animal, certainly not something to be proud of, can only imagine that room smelling like feet.

Hey respect man. I started in 05-06 I can‚Äôt remember the exact year but I was 9 at the time. I‚Äôm at 98 strength right now and will have my first 99 within a week. If it wasn‚Äôt for mobile I never could have done it

Most efficient is to sell them all and do whatever with the money. If your goal is herblore, buy already cleaned herbs with that money.
---
vOv reddit is very polarized.

Don't agree to splits with anyone you don't trust I guess :/

That's "1 Defence". He does a lot of crazy stuff with with the game if you look at his YouTube channel. If I remember correctly, he came up with the Bandos alting method that was posted on here in the past few months. I would bet he's doing something that not a lot of people know about rather than botting.
---
You can report him for scamming, but nothing will happen. You were silly to trust a random third.

Plus i see how this could be implemented, they could add an island with red crabs.
---
Random unrelated question from a noob here: if i understand correctly, every blowpipe shot can inflict venom on a monster. And venom does more damage over time (contrary to regular poison which deals the same amount of damage every x seconds). Doesn't that mean you could simply hit each monster once to venom it and then wait as all monsters die from the venom? It is probably a lot slower but it should be a lot less expensive, no?
---
Have them all alch able for a few weeks at ge price, then, clear the game of them

---
slayer helmet is top prio unlock imo. always keep a few skips worth of points banked, just in case.
---
like you said the best xp/hr tasks aren't always the best gp/hr tasks. in general you're just going to have to figure out which ones you prefer doing and which you'd rather shelve and skip or block. i would look at a task weighting table from whatever master you're using before deciding what tasks to block, being as efficient as you can with points and least amount of skips is always nice.
---
Thanks Ayiza
---
You lost so many spades huh
---
this made my day
---
amazing resource, thank you!!!
---
Good taste, amigo. One of my favorites as well, but the Archer‚Äôs Helm is #1 for me still after all these years.
---
Bracelet of Slaughter for tasks that you enjoy. Expeditious Bracelets for tasks that you hate. Anything other gloves for Slayer is kind of "pointless". Don't bother trying to min max by bringing your other gloves and then switching when mob is almost dead, it's not worth it.
---
Yeh that‚Äôs understandable. I feel like these would be the ‚Äòinfernal cape‚Äô for skillers in a way though
---
Obsidian armor for the strength bonus
---
Fury or torture
---
Dragon or primordial boots.
---
The main difference I see is infernal has stats 120s are pure cosmetic
---
Quick update, dry streak was broken at 1061 and 1062 with BACK TO BACK visages rofl. This game sometimes I swear.
---
W
---
It would be cheaper yes, but you get no xp for the venom hits so you'll just be stood there gaining no xp, other than the slayer xp when it does if it's your task.
---
thank you  very much for that info, i didn't know these bracelets even existed :)
---
Dinhs and 89 agility or join a clan
---
Yep. It would be cosmetic it‚Äôs more so the time required to achieve one that makes it to the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô of a pvm cape
---
I‚Äôm glad.
---
So you have to agree before viewing it now. It's not gone. Fuck that carebear sub
---
I have it but ive been casting the spell through the book not the ring
---
Gratz on the pet mate. What level did you get it at?
---
No.
---
So they make alts and get around this problem? How would it work with iron people who keep everything? This idea just creates other problems. Ge tax they raised a while back is way better. They wanted to release it as a small tax, which overtime buys the item and deletes the item from the game. Example 1% tax on item worth 100gp,after 100 transactions of that item. One item will be destroyed.
---
thank you for the reply, im going to need to save up some money to buy some of these items, which ones would you say are best to buy first?
---
They built in then broke it down to build it again idiot
---
I do, but i'm not actually sure what you're supposed to do with them - just that they're the safespots.

Twisted remains then? I don't really care what it's called. Just make a Twisted 'something' that attaches to the Seercull to make the Twisted bow.

Gonna be honest, I always mined another rock for maximum afk. I know I am the scum of the earth.
---
That sweet achievement cape bruh

Yeah it‚Äôs all very interesting for sure. Never under estimate what someone in the osrs community will do to set a record tho! Lmao
---
Currently I‚Äôm using mele, my mage is only in the low 50s and my range is only level 30
---
Yeah do this OP. I leave most of my loot on the ground and it's always a few hundred k. I see other people leaving their loot to despawn too. If you ask most people probably wouldn't mind since it's worthless to rich players.
---
Do you have anything in place to either filter out repeats of the same account and/or tally repeats? 
---
IE  The twitter feed won't repeat the same bot in the given day, but it can tally up how many days in a row it sees the same one?
---
Got it right around 330, so pretty early on
---
Although it is a very nice picture, the art style is extremely contradicting
---
Sky and the tree are in the same quality
---
The player and the sword are in their own quality
---
The sky, the grass and that pier are some yet another, arguably worse, quality
---
R U ok

True dat,  give him a blowpipe.

why the fuck is that sub quarantined, its just water memes lol
---
Just being a dramen staff and use Zanaris to bank, makes it very fast!

u could ez play multiple accounts at once on a athlon 200 ge pc build that costs around 200 usd
---
probably one of my favorite soundtracks in the game. Not that many people know about it and its so fucking awesome.
---
I have a few things in place to prevent this. It may tweet the same bot out twice in the early stages of development due to me deleting the log for bug fixes.
---
I wrote the world hopping in a way that it will iterate through a list of white-listed worlds that I've specified (excludes Deadman worlds and high total worlds) in a random order, and won't hop to the same world in a rotation, once it has hopped through all of the worlds it will start another rotation.
---
But yeah, I log the bots that have been tweeted and once it's finished it won't tweet them out twice. :)

Maybe see if any of your friends have old pcs for sale? Doesn't even need to be anything fancy, I'm sure almost anything can run osrs.

The only alternative if you're too lazy to get 65 slayer is the Ah Za Rhoon dungeon, visited during Shilo Village. There you can spam click a coin drop to spawn a huge amount of monsters.
---
Currently leveling my construction. I keep coming across posts of people saying to stop at 83. Is this because of the ability to boost your level with the crystal saw? Can anyone clarify this for me? I'm not sure how you'd be able to make the items like ornate pool without a bigger boost than the crystal saw gives. 
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Neat.

You keep the logs right?

As someone else said, if someone mines 1 ore and starts the timer, it'll count down until there's 1 ore left, that'll be why that happens

Is it possible to have more than one account? I want different settings for different accounts.
---
The difference is this is a video game and people aren't actually suffering.
---
At least you got ava's before 99.
---
I wouldn't even waste my time bursting, next best option is Dust Devils but that's click intensive and only returns like 120k/hr. I'd Fire Surge in NMZ.
---
I've been noticing the exact same thing over the last few days. Lower herb yield and more dead herbs using the BCB with Ultra.. So if it's any help, you're not alone. I think we're just unlucky though.

Lol, maybe tweet at jagex and hope they refund? But I kinda doubt they would

Well I think its great that you can apply motive to the entire Jagex team and read their minds like you do but they have said repeatedly that some things just don't have to be the best, some items can be shit and thats ok. You can observe that Jagex haven't made a specific item BIS, and you can say that that's because they are powerless against merching clans, or you can not be retarded.

Yeah that's what I was kinda thinking. Using Duradel mainly, which tasks should I be looking blocking and extending? I've only done about 10 or so from him so don't have too good a feel for it yet, although so far I like daggonoth and lizardmen tasks for cannoning xp

Hey man, not built an obby tank myself but I do have a couple of different other obby alts.
---
From what what I understand, you would be best training Strength until 74,  which is high enough to gain 50 mage without affecting combat level. This would allow you to get the slayer staff (with 55 slayer) which would be your best in slot for your remaining strength and defence training.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say this is 100% necessary, but the increase in XP compared to the Event RPG is definitely noticeable.
---
Doing this would also allow you some time to PK as a regular Obby mauler before you transition it into a tank.
---
Hope this helps and good luck with building!

You don‚Äôt lol.

What‚Äôs the rates for this do you know ?

It still exists but not the way it did in 2005. Now people are paying a ton of money (think like 3-4m/hour) for people to run them ess at ZMI. 75 rc is required to be a runner but anyone can pay runners. It's prohibitively expensive for most people though.
---
&gt;jagex wont update them to be useful because a few people will make millions or billions in one update
---
Why exactly does that matter though? If an out dated useless item can be improved what difference does it make to anyone if some people make billions?
---
It a quarantined community lmao
---
pure essence running is actually the best money maker in the game outside of raids, you need 75 runecrafting and lunar diplomacy to maximize the gp ph though. I believe there's a discord community dedicated to it;
---
 [https://discordapp.com/invite/dtEqAD8](https://discordapp.com/invite/dtEqAD8)

I've been told it's up to 4.5m ph if you're efficient and consistent but i have no personal experience.

Engine work.

Not even close
---
Sometimes its because people think they‚Äôre going to be rewarded for being generous. They play on that, and it‚Äôs surprisingly affective..
---
Nmz summons 4 enemies per person. 2 Friends/alts and you can burst 12 enemies.
---
&gt; full guthix
---
blessed dhide right? my first thought when you say full guthix is the rune armor with pray bonus
---
He shidded and farded too?
---
Adderall and OSRS...damn good combo
---
How do play?
---
Firemaking cooking and thieving 99s are all very easy to get.
---
tl;dr: OP is wank, not Jagex.
---
You forgot 75 attack for Dinh‚Äôs, tsotd, zgs. All useful for pking.
---
Paving a hash driveway is still the greatest thing in television history.
---
I did the quest. Im still getting same message
---
Politics on white supremacy? Yeah actually I do view them as Nazis, or at least morally equivalent such as it makes no difference.
---
Because they have different drop tables.
---
Lmao, that's hilarious. I know you're making a joke, but banning or cramming down on others' politics you don't like while operating under the guise of being offended or removing "hate" (things you don't like) is not the moral high ground.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are salty about these posts, congrats!
---
Wish i'd bump into them in the wildy - they can have my 100k before I tear them asunder.
---
This is the reason why we are still here
---
Im sorry but I think caring about silly names is a lot more immature than having said silly names
---
Are you making a joke or is there method to safespot brutals that I don't know about?
---
I fuckin‚Äô a toad a so
---
By weird he means stupid.
---
I don't like white supremacists either, but as long as they don't commit or call for violence, they should have as much of an opinion as anyone else.
---
I don't believe in thought-crime, and I definitely don't believe in giving other flawed humans the ability to make that decision.
---
‚ÄúRelax cc‚Äù very active, raids, gwd, and bossing all day long.
---
Try running out of scales with 10 hp left..
---
I dont think OP is complaining, I think he's more demonstratkngthe fact that he's has such a large dry streak.
---
There is no bigger thrill in this game than earning your own drops, I'm sure when OP does hit that blowpipe, he's going to be over the moon for weeks - I knew I was when I finished my Dharoks set and that barely unlocks anything.
---
Idk, remember the times he almost got got in dmm?
---
This is me at barrows

---
Assume u train the defence to 99 just using melee?
---
Not gonna lie, I had no clue until I read this comment.
---
He is rank 6 on the highscores that went for rank 1 smithing xp in a single day. He got rank 2 and shit himself in the process where he sat in it for 2 hours. He admitted to shitting himself expecting people to praise his disgusting nature as dedication?
---
Pay a clan to let you chin on 10+ of them at clanwars
---
This.
---
If your trying to get just 80 temple trekking is a way to get slayer xp without doing slayer
---
No need to have a safe spot. Drink antifire potion and pray mage. Don't run in melee and you'll never be hit. But I guess he'd run out of prayer or antifire so probably won't work.
---
Yeah, why wouldn't you be able to?
---
Since jagex fucked shilo tunnels, get 52 or 65 slayer and chin warped jellies/dust devils.
---
I know, that's why I said that it's easy on Runelite but otherwise it's a bit annoying
---
Construction is super useful tho
---
0/10
---
What do the letters on the side stand for?
---
nope. they just destroy all their enemies.
---
Nice.
---
&gt;How do you know if swampletics isnt cheating?
---
You can also track his ehp
---
Also, I'm positive someone would've spotted him by now. Like there really isn't anything for him to gain by cheating but so much to lose.
---
Should i*
---
Well why on earth would anyone use rune claws..
---
Yeah man the payment system bugged for you only and never for anyone else. Crazy stuff how that works a massive system just bugging for you.
---
He even mentioned you have extremely similiar emails so you just logged into the wrong one. Just move on and transfer the membership dude
---
Depends on your stats and what you're doing
---
you‚Äôre a pussy for reporting them
---
Where do you make these?
---
A grown man shit himself and sat in it for two hours to try to get rank 2 for a single highscore for a single day on a video game. At that point he needs fucking help
---
 lets not drop shade on crypto just cause op is dumb. Every currency is used for illegal shit
---
finding a straight line that has enough spaces for 28 fires o the west side is not always available. some times burning a fire north would be much better as there no more space to be utilised
---
this not true
---
Wow, a screenshot of your TV?
---
true it just killed my wrist haha
---
Rich get richer
---
Shit himself and sat in it for 2 hours going for rank 1 ehp smithing in a day. Didnt get it...
---
still 100k exp burying them tho, so better than 0 lol
---
He sat in his own shit for 2 hours while getting the new #2  daily smithing ehp exp record
---
You're right. Shucks. Guess I'll have to shut 'er down.
---
Look who just died doing a clue
---
I blame streamers
---
OwO
---
My favorite part of the dueling arena is losing 8 stakes in a row whilst only ever winning 2 in a row
---
You can spend hours ingame making the money. You could also just work 1 hour in the real world and pay $11 for the membership.
---
What‚Äôs happening here? That thing updates fine with xp for me
---
Yea im a main so im doing everything
---
If you believe this is a real thing then your account deserves to be hacked lmao
---
Something to do with shitting his pants and didn‚Äôt do anything about it. Don‚Äôt know the whole story
---
aka unchecking no magic and checking no melee
---
Show me on the doll where the bad man hurt you
---
infinity recolours actually come from clue scrolls :)
---
It's not good for everything
---
true mod west doesn't take criticism well, pretty sad.
---
[This.](https://twitter.com/Oslo_RS/status/1119437419084955648)
---
Only effective combat form of mage training is bursting really, not sure where you could burst in the wild that would rival MM2 tunnels. Super risky also as if someone logged next to the monsters your bursting your now skulled. Plus you'd risk heaps of runes or be forced to non stop bank
---
Generally it lasts for ~3 weeks although I think last year it only went for 2. Either way, you've still got time!
---
Starting point is just outside of Falador's North gate if you've forgotten.

I can‚Äôt get off the tatorial island

Blowpipe still beats tbow at many places though lmao

Average of 14.3k per kill. Amazing.
---
Despite all the customer support jokes, they're actually really helpful when it concerns payments.
---
116 checking in with 2123.
---
The best method is paying a rev clan in the max total worlds. Insane gp/hr
---
Depends on the boss. Generally Void is better if you're a high level and the boss has low defense.
---
The activity bar is actually quite strict, you're basically required to kill everything as it spawns. Virtually nothing survives past a few tiles from the portal lol
---
Someone maxed just by picking flowers on WoW too.

Swampletics isn't the first, true creator of limited playstyles.

you're kind of a dick.

It doesn't run off this way lol

Wow this is good! Kind of has a Gorillaz vibe to it.

nice man what is your setup? I tried DKs yesterday for the first time but my dumbass brought a metal platebody with my avas so none of my darts were saving.  I might try d'hide next time

Procrastinating on doing Mournings ends pt 2 for my master clue scroll
---
I power buried bones on my phone because it was less intense than power burying on pc. I think there are some click intensive things that are nicer on mobile.
---
Runepouch with tele runes, tele varrock Square, stand middle of fountain, make fires to west Bank, Bank, repeat, you're welcome
---
Aw for telling the guy the odds of the entire system being bugged is far less than him making a simple human error??
---
For being such a new company in a really competitive area yeah they‚Äôre doing pretty well and have a good rep
---
&gt; AFAIK there aren't going to be any rune stones dotting the landscape.
---
From the link:
---
&gt; Step 2: Locate a Ward
---
Wards can be created within the world by left-clicking on a wardstone while stood outside. Wards function much like fires do ‚Äì players may use each other's wards as they please. Players can also choose to ward at *the nearest Runestone Monolith, as these mysterious structures have permanent elemental wards around them.*
---
&gt; When I said that, I meant it as "the community won't vote in an update to Runecraft," now that you personally were against it.
---
Fair enough. I guess it'll come down to which is more iconic? The landscape and having 23 skills or Runecraft. I bet it would be the former since the latter has already received 2 substantial updates in Zeah and ZMI.
---
&gt; Then people won't vote it in because it makes Runecraft a defacto combat skill
---
Good point. If they were untradeable, they would have to not be BiS and/or very niche in their application. It was as a way to make it a reward, but I can see the issue with that.
---
The point of banning all accounts is deterrence. It's a message to everyone else, don't make bots to farm items, or we'll ban every account of yours we can find.
---
The repercussions of not banning his main, is letting everyone else know that they can make bots with no risk to their actual accounts. Then other people might make goldfarming bots, just to RWT the profits with the feeling there's no risk to their mains.
---
New copypasta
---
Yep. 75 attack wouldnt be a terrible idea though. He could use TSOTD and bulwark
---
A whip with 13 d scims on it
---
‚ÄúLoser‚Äù
---
He shidded and farded
---
&gt;Is there a list of 'profitable' tasks?
---
I wouldn't worry about trying to be profitable with slayer in the 30s, 40s, even 50s. I'd argue you won't start getting to the real good stuff until the 60s and upwards. for now, I would say maximize XP and make your money through some other method in the meantime
---
I'm honestly impressed how patient you are being with this guy
---
$11 says he didn't because they have always been incredibly responsive to me in the past.
---
Like I forgot to end a recurring subscription once and they went back and refunded it to my card the same day.
---
I also had an issue where I had multiple accs on the same email and I accidentally put membs on the wrong one and they sorted it out in less than a day too.
---
Everything eventually drops in price with time. I remember back when a rune full helmet was worth my full bank. I remember when dragon longswords were the best weapons and were worth mini 100k each, I remember when herbs used to be 1k each, I remember when Santa hats,party hats Easter eggs were worth fortunes. If you have thousands of people farming the gorillas every day it is logic the prices will drop just like every item in game. Sure the alchs will still be good but for the zenytes I'm 1000% sure they'll eventually drop when better monsters will come out or when there will be better equipment than the zenytes. Even if nothing comes out, in 1 year or 2 years of intense farming the prices should drop. Look at rangers they're basically bis with the crystal but they still dropped 4-5mil in a few weeks just because of intense farming from clue scroll hunters. If you're the only one possessing an item it makes it valuable, once this item is flooded into the game it loses value over time for sure !
---
If you have any spare range or mage exp you can trident/cannon tasks. Cannon yields 2 range exp per 1 slay exp and trident yields 2 magic exp and 1.3 hp exp per 1 slay exp. In addition, you can also add guaranteed venom to some tasks, especially those you can do in multi-combat areas, by using toxic trident and seep helm
---
noob get noober
---
6 max kids running up w dh looool
---
My bot.
---
bruh I can totally understand hating NMZ, I'm with you 100%, but not imbuing your slayer helm is no bueno
---
You‚Äôre supposed to write the text on the poster not in impact font like a 2012 meme
---
Go for it man, Pc builds are lots of fun and you'll get years out of it. If you only plan on simple stuff like osrs you won't need to invest much at all.
---
Boss tasks are the profitable tasks, so doing demonic gorillas for black demons, vorkath for blue dragons, cerb for hellhounds.
---
Yes but it'll probably take a while to get used to desktop controls.
---
Why darts
---
Wtf?
---
What's so great about the equipment? I've looked at it and it seems... just okay, mostly in line with black D-Hide stuff but for much greater time investment. Is it mostly for the lack of penalties to any combat style, for monsters/bosses that require switching?
---
i kNoW iTS NoT mUCh TO u gUyS BUt....
---
Because it is literally no achievement or anything special nowadays
---
Doubt it, this is probably trivial to implement.
---
Probably some regex pattern matching is all it is.
---
I think that's 1pm Central Time which means I'll be at work. If I'm on break I'll hop on mobile.
---
No problem pal, you can add me on Fake Monkey ingame!
---
Iirc one of the game backups was 2011 after the bot nuke. I think 2011scape was considered when deciding to bring back an old version of the game until they realised it would completely kill off rs3 so they offered us 2007scape
---
It has to be. Like I said, I only have one account. Not to mention, when I went to reset my password, the email said "Character Name Unavailable, we have recieved a request to reset the password...."
---
Oof I always just think someone was too lazy to switch after recruitment drive
---
Alright I've only seen memes hence my comment. If someone is actually *threatening* him, then that isn't right. But I feel like "threatening" is a term thrown around quite loosely nowadays.
---
My dad is your dad
---
You should get your skills to base 70 and con to 99 so you're either 70 or 99 to really perfect the account.
---
Dharoking isn't worth it until 92+ hp.
---
nah, just the offensive and aggressive way of wording it. Even in this comment you're talking down to me. It's like you've lost the ability to talk normally.
---
Yeah I was gonna say surely tsotd would rock with 99 mage
---
Yup my divine ss became worthless overnight
---
This might be the one time where only a single person has this thought.
---
Yeah this is afterwards, his mom demanded change or no more computer time for mister Oslo
---
Have you considered the set effects of the equipment? It is only really used for the set effects. 
---
And as you mention it can be good to reduce the amount of switches because you only need to swap the helm.
---
Can I see it?
---
Thanks dude this helps a ton. It's annoying when fandom is the first result in the page
---
poppy fards haha
---
It doesn't last time I checked. Unless it's a wilderness boss, konar will not assign tasks in the wilderness as Krystilla handles that area.
---
I mean I still don‚Äôt get why, you could have easily bossed for a few hours, bought chins and been done insanely faster.
---
Its spec does have some niche uses. I recall it used to be used to lower Corp's Magic too but I think it has since been replaced for that. But there is room to make it a better bow without ruining its current uses or replacing MSB.
---
Just hit 85 defence. Have 85 attack and strength now. Going to NNZ to my strength now, at 91!
---
Literally unplayable.
---
does anyone know if these dicing bots are EVER legit? like do they ever actually pay out to make it look legit, or is it a money sink 100% of the time?
---
Not considering trying it, just curious
---
hire a runner?
---
Read who liked it.
---
It's 0x0
---
"Close the fucking door"
---
Probably doesn't even know he can collect 150k per day from NMZ.
---
Its almost as if there was a fragment within him that was proud of this moment. The unbearable desire to share his shit stained fiasco
---
Definitely some weird, rare bug then. Changed my name over 20 times since it was first introduced. Hear anything else back from support or is your account in limbo?
---
$11 and save your gp
---
Reminds me of one time I was in the GE and saw a maxed out guy suggesting to someone else that they may get something good if they got his fury. When I came back, I saw the guy complaining that his fury was scammed.
---
Yeah runelite is a gamechanger
---
You do by leveling slayer instead.
---
i wood berry my sgs so deep in ur ass that whoever pulled it out would be crowned king arthur
---
some of us have to work nearly 3 hours for that,  some even more. Doesnt mean so much but every dollar counts for some. Just putting it out there.
---
The bots were giving away money
---
Same. Found it on his arm after staring.
---
Well they made 0 gp and 0 exp, so a meme
---
People do that every day irl and in video games, i mean look at hackers n shit in FPS games
---
Keep trying homie you'll figure it out
---
How do you know that he is going to bot Green Dragons after this?
---
if you're too poor for bis gear then yeah, it's not that much worse anyway.
---
Boots tend to be larger than the foot they go on, rather than smaller
---
It's a good meme but the fact it was found and stolen from Instagram disappoints me
---
You actually do as your music tracklist shows where you've been
---
Idk how getting killed by clans is fun. It might be fun to do the killing
---
Anguish probably
---
is that supposed to be a bad thing? its a wake up call that he's an addicted shitter that needs to check himself
---
While true, a lot of location locked accounts (including swampy) had to do quests n stuff to unlock a lot of content prior to the series
---
Did op get offended, oh no.
---
No, I'll take it off your hands and dispose of it. Lol
---
Depends. Slayer for instance is a highly coveted untrimmed cape just because it's difficult to get 99 slayer before naturally getting 99 in another combat skill.
---
Untrimmed is special because it shows it was your first 99 as well. So every player can only get one untrimmed cape making the individual untrimmed capes more rare.
---
And of course fashion scape is a consideration as the trimmed look different (sometimes better of course but the trim changes the color scheme).
---
Don‚Äôt have membership. Wanted 43 prayer
---
Nah mate, you should just trade it to me.
---
Wadi hek is dat
---
Great idea! But what would be the closest tele? The sceptre to barbarian village and run down? 
---
Currently I use glory tele and run, it's kind of far. Could also use arceuus draynor manor tele tabs but these wouldn't utilise the shortcut.
---
Your bank account will be a good drop. Gg jack
---
If all you play is rs that's like getting 99 mining on copper ores
---
I got 4 zenytes within 500kc.
---
These are honestly one of the best money makers in game, especially on task. The zenytes are 1/300, which is an extremely low drop rate for what they are worth.
---
Would you share your detection filters for their chat strings?
---
Left-hand muscle adjustment.
---
The implication of the post is that they are people. If they're bots then the whole argument falls apart clearly.
---
First you gotta learn to survive, than you can learn how to kill.
---
I dont understand why the community is fine with it, they always complain about ez scape but NMZ is peak ez scape if you ask me.
---
1000 IQ
---
Make your runescape character's pixel skin a real life "oppressed" minority so you can claim "virtual racism" against people that question your cyber criminal activities
---
They pay out, but the odds that they advertise are not the real odds. In short, you are getting scammed if you use them.
---
You could bring an inventory of anti fires, and tick flick mage prayers and probably do a tonne with a tbow... Although definitely would need to bank the loot, unless he's using a second account to pick up his loot and bank or bring supplies...
---
Use a herring on a tree
---
And now it's alright, it's okay
---
And you may look the other way
---
Is the floor pattern freaking the fuck out for anyone else?
---
How are you holding 29 herbs? Damn hacked clients üò°
---
Why can't you get fire cape
---
It is what it is I guess -- I am expecting a ban wave, so I won't be disappointed when it happens.  Had fun making it.
---
I usually use spirit tree to Port Sarim and just run around while doing my herb and cacti runs.
---
I agree with what you said as well as the other guy. But you both make it sound like karma is used for something when it's just imaginary and worthless.
---
Tfw there are kids in high school now that weren't even alive to see this on TV.
---
People want a GE tax because, for some reason, a huge portion of this community is nostalgic for a falador market that would be a huge time waste and dominated by bots, and would only serve to increase Zybez' ad revenue.
---
You don't bring a ring swap when you have Anguish/Torture right?
---
It will.
---
Yeah that's fine
---
Most likely.
---
Congrats. I'm just blown away by the fact it's not fletching and cooking.
---
Who came up with this sound? There's been so much meme-ing I've forgotten what the original post was about, does anyone have a link?
---
Who gives a flying fuck dude??? Honestly you tell me. By him not doing this quest does it make your game harder? Does it ruin the game for you? The point is whether he made a dumb decision or not, even if you have the right do berate him for it. You.are.still.an.asshole. Stop denying it, we are all assholes in some way or another and when it comes to this game, you are a dick, if somebody isn't doing something exactly how you want them too, you berate them. Because your an asshole. Get over it and move on
---
I panic too much when jad comes. Like it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
At first I was afraid, I was petrified...
---
Whoosh
---
My account never went anywhere, the login username was the only thing that reverted. I was able to get back into the account, so everything is fine now.
---
?
---
You are delusional if you don't think that telling people about a lure, will help make the lure less likely to work on more in the future. Oh well. Done arguing with you
---
sadly you will probably be the one that gets banned for botting
---
Oh hey, /u/ResidentSleeperino! Found a telegram for you!  
---
Just because something is legal doesn't make it isn't morally apprehensive stop  
---
I don't care if a countries laws allow you to fuck children, they're still children stop   
---
If you truly believe legality absolves morality you should be put on a list somewhere stop  
---
Get help you creep Full stop
---
Let me show you
---
Join a clan. Friends lists are often useless unless you're close cause a lot of ppl keep private off anyways. I'm the same. I have like 2 people on my friends list who I ever really talk to but being in a clan is fun even if you're afk cause you can still see what's going on
---
Explains why the assembler is perfect. Dragon head is scared of you after killing him 50 times and doesn't want to fuck up again.
---
Thank you!
---
I understand why everyone says that, and I guess I get downvoted for not being efficient; but I rarely range/mage my Slayer tasks so my priority right now is imbuing the gear that I need to make cash for any type of bossing, which in this case is Vork.
---
While you and I can agree that it was stupid as fuck, for sure, that just isn't how it works in situations like that at all, sadly. 
---
In the hypothetical situation that they don't ban his main, (which again I think is stupid as fuck that they did, but that's besides the point) all it takes is *one* person who was already blatantly botting to try to use his not being banned as a cop out. "He botted and he wasn't banned, why am I being banned? Botting is botting!" Then whoever made the call for not banning his main, too, gets some sort of stupid talking to about "Well even though he's obviously stupid and wrong, he has a point, why didn't you ban all of his accounts?"
---
It's just stupid wishy washy corporate type shit. You can't really leave any room for anything in situations like that. Even though we all can agree, things just don't end up working out like that sadly.
---
No problem!
---
Reposted for corrected title.
---
I‚Äôll allow it
---
This time....
---
But it wouldn't stop someone from trying to use it as a defense. The point is to absolutely 100% without question send the message "don't do it."
---
Yes I think it's garbage that his main got banned. But that is how these types of things are always handled.
---
Once you get good at demonics you realize you don't need tankiness at all because you only ever have to take damage on the 5050 after a melee phase. So the blessed dhide is actually better than karil or bandos imo, since the extra range attack is way more valuable than 2 str and you get pray bonus over karil.

why does it matter if you go over 80?
---
Eskaygee. Same as my name on here
---
Exactly. I mean, just sitting in a pit of recurring monsters for 6 hours while absorbing their damage with very little focus needed?.. What happened to when we use to enjoy Slayer in a way that is was actually fun? A strength cape use to mean something. Now it's just a cape expressing that the majority of players spent half of that time in NMZ

You can pretty much afk slayer now with the fossil island wcing. Once you're 50 range (cannon) and mage and do 2(?) Easy diaries you can fairly afk the rest just chopping mushrooms. The WC XP is good too, I'm at 75 on my obby mauler from the fossil grind. 
---
Only really takes about 12 hours too. Its not like it used to be any more, there's no 70+ hours of slaying with a maul nowadays.
---
Please explain how???
---
Nothing, they‚Äôre just saying that even though he has high stats, not much work went into the account. He‚Äôs probably unquested, and any skill that requires effort (most) are not trained.
---
Yes. You‚Äôve left tutorial island, you could have done anything. Obviously you have to start again.
---
Your argument doesn‚Äôt even make sense. If your dogs  checked the world description then you wouldn‚Äôt be calling them dumbasses
---
Sadly they do leave room for it. I also like KempQ and don't really care that he sold gp, but they let his main stay. They are already inconsistent in who they ban, so it's extra stupid to have banned Crumb's main. Additionally, this is just an mmo. Nothing catastrophic would come from letting mains stay unbanned in situations like this. Sure, people could TRY and use it as precedence, but at the end of the jagex has final say. They can't really drag them into court for it
---
If this is a serious post then wow
---
If you were to get 70 prayer and piety. Stay 75 attack and 70 defense and train strength high. You should be good to do pvp as a main in dharoks or godsword fights.
---
That‚Äôs a quite a bold statement to make when in the tweet you linked he says he is 21, and only likes people over the age of consent. Since when is this a witch-hunting subreddit? Fuck off.
---
Nothing, I‚Äôm saying I bet he bought 1k prayer pots to grind slayer with piety 24/7 and cannon because he didn‚Äôt make that money with those stats
---
Mining level?
---
yeah i saw gunschilli clicking, but why when he respawns at falador is the other player with the whip able to click the knight and it reacts without trouble?
---
Slayer, because ladies like men who can slay üòèüòè
---
Thank you for the advice, it was extremely helpful.
---
Well, you‚Äôre sort of at a point where you need to get 99 strength and 94 magic for vengeance to start pking on this account EFFECTIVELY. You can go out there and most likely get a few kills but die quite often. So that is sort of up to you if you want to grind out those stats or not. 
---
Starting a pure is always fun as well. You can get started pretty quickly by cannon if ranged to 70, stay at level 1 prayer, 1 def, 50 attack and 60 strength. That usually takes about a week to do with ~3-4 hours a day put in, and the output is a pretty fun baby gmauler pure that will shred a lot of accounts in its combat bracket. 
---
It‚Äôs not a bad idea either to build a pure while playing your main. Those 30-40 hours of grinding to get a pure ready could easily be 10m+ gp doing afk money makers.

I get it isn't efficient, but any xp is better than no xp. 5 minutes to shit while playing mobile wouldn't have changed his final placing. He would still be 2nd place ;) Also, if we really want to get into this, he could have kept a shitty PC in his bathroom set up for gaming while he shits. $200 can get you a rig that can run osrs.
---
Yes, whatsup my dude
---
main pking is dead
---
They'd be using it as a defence because they botted, they wouldn't be botting because they thought it was a valid defence. 
---
Botters are going to come up with bullshit excuses whenever their banned, since their aim is to literally waste Jagex moderation time.
---
Just host a new event and replace all the current statues.
---
Also better than running another DMM tournament thats just gonna be plagued by bugs again.
---
Quite a bit more than 25% of players are opposed, pal. I'd like to see where you got the assumption that it a new skill is the number one requested update though... were the 2019 content survey results released?
---
I 100% support the "play the way that makes you happy" method of Scaping. But why aren't you ranging/maging some tasks? Ranging just being cannonballs in most cases, and maging just being bursting.
---
If you just don't want to drop the money on a cannon/cannonballs, then I totally get that. But it just makes so many tasks so much more bearable. :(

The effect of MTX is way overstated imo. Hi Score competition is dead, and it only affects you if you Sabotage your own reward system by buying into it. Nobody is really killing their own game experience by getting the free daily keys either. Rewards from TH are pretty meager if you're not spending money on it. 
---
Area looting and scavenger pets are a decent QoL update tbh. The pets don't really do much, and area loot makes it 10x easier to gather shit because you're not fighting 1-3 things at a time any more, with EoC you could be fighting 10++. 
---
The economy is still strong, arguably stronger due to Invention driving up the cost of typically obscure, useless, or obscure and useless items. $50 in bonds on both games buys you about the same tier of gear, there's really not much of a difference in terms of real buying power between the games. 
---
Honestly it's not nearly as bad as you think, and it doesn't seem like you've given it enough of a chance to really justify your own opinion on it. Not trying to throw stones or whatever, or egg you on to try it. I play both, and they're both rewarding in different ways. I tend to enjoy RS3 because it's rewarding to max, it's rewarding to go kill stuff, it's rewarding to do quests just like the old game - but imo in a less grindy and click intensive way. 
---
There's satisfaction left to be had from the game. Ya just gotta try it out for yourself I guess.

Doesn't change the fact that their is their solution. We are still unable to have multiple characters even with the price hike.

Only on bh worlds. It‚Äôs still pretty active on PvP worlds.
---
Zenytes are 1 in 300 drop rate, but that doesn't stop them being bis. Yes everything drops, but your example of the rares, such as santas, partyhats, and so on is wrong. They are still rising. The only reason they arent the same price as rs3 is because jagex didnt want that and neither did We. Demonic gorillas are a reward of doing one of the hardest quests in the game, it's not like you can grind it out in a week, and I'm pretty sure anyone who has the ability to do them already does.
---
Thank you

Could you explain what‚Äôs going on here? What are you killing ?

Whats the point you would still end up going around anyways
---
I know the feel brother, my gaming group has just accepted it, but I can tell they are annoyed when I wanna play this grindfest instead of a sweaty shooter.
---
I would say gambler's fallacy instead, for sure. People think just because they got a rare drop on the same table, that means literally the next kill, they can't get that drop again. The chance is the same every time, it never gets better or worse!

Poor gamblers.

I have a PC but havent logged in on it very often since mobile.  Made account during beta for mobile been playing since and I'm nearing 1800 total.  For me mobile feels so smooth after getting use to it.  Actually died at grags boss on PC the other day and it was a real ????????? moment I just laughed and went and got my stuff back and logged back onto mobile.  Mobile just feels a lot nicer to me.

Yeah redenomination does have its benefits but often the effort involved in exchanging all old currency to new currency can end up being a nightmare and very costly to certain industries. An alternative is using the same currency but exchanging a portion of zeros for a sequence of letters. First example in Columbia they exchanged the last 3 zeros of their currency for "mil" or in english "thousand". They quite literally did what rs did with 50k, 400k, etc lol

Joys of now getting to within 1 jump of Iban....and then falling again.....and again.....and again......
---
takes 10 minutes to do tutorial island... admit your mistake and get on with your life.
---
also, if you get out of tutorial island not being an ironman, then change it later, it defeats the integrity of ironmen. you could make a fresh account, trade over an entire inventory of cash stacks from another account within 5 seconds of leaving tutorial island, then change your status afterwards. that wouldnt be fair to the ironman status. it's just logical to be unable to change it. doesnt have anything to do with spaghetti code or jagex being inept or lazy.

But RWT is; Roger. Your opinions were misinformed because you said this is the same as actually getting money from bottling. Good job picking and choosing where your points relate and where they don't though.

Start out with a few quests to get to know the area. Good ones to start you off are Doric‚Äôs, Goblin Diplomacy, Cook‚Äôs Assistant, Sheep Shearer, and Romeo and Juliet. The Knight‚Äôs Sword is great too because it takes you up like.... 28 smithing levels.

Not gonna lie noob setup raids are amazingly fun esp with friends, but probably not the best to learn on. But if you have a bp Trident bgs and decent melee mage and range gear you can raid. For like 30ish mill and every split makes it so much better.

Ok thanks, that'll help a ton. I still need runes though. Oh well, guess I'll get them sometime later. Thanks man!

How HOWW HOWWW
---
Because there are 8 octillion+ passwords available with the limitations they have.  Which, even if the jagex servers could support that many attempts (they can't) would take just ages to brute force.
---
For the record the number looks like this:  
---
8,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

I mean you don't need theory you can literally go do it, it doesn't work lol.

I was getting about 3:30-ish average when I started. I'm now around 2:40. It's almost entirely 1-kill trips, and banking/resupplying/telporting/running to the boat is about 1:20 total, so I have about 4 minute round trips. I got 82 construction for Ornate Pool+Fairy Ring this weekend which really cut that resupply time way down. I also have the agility level to use the fairy ring/shortcut.
---
Honestly, why aren't there HCIM only servers that have beefier hardware less prone to disconnections?
---
Thanks man. Really great comprehensive list :)
---
Does RuneScape have it set up to where if you incorrectly type your password wrong 10 times or something you have to wait like 10 mins? I wanna say that happened to me in Rs2, but it may have been a different website
---
if you're doing bp addy darts is definitely good enough but you pretty much NEED a BGS at your level or your kills are all gonna be above 5 minutes. pray mage and piety, spec until you do at least 50 damage. if you don't, tele out, restore spec, try again.
---
Haha well.....maybe in some cases
---
What does the left label as hate that you believe you should be able to do? Maybe I'm just too far removed from most the discussions that happen between leftists and conservatives, but usually the act of removing "hate" is almost always someone calling out some extremely racist or transphobic etc opinion, at least from my point of view.
---
accounts get locked after a few incorrect tries so brute forcing isnt an issue.
---
as for why they haven't updated i assume they just don't see a reason to, no one gets hacked because they don't have a special character in their password these days.
---
Have it tweet @jagexsupport every time it finds them.

It‚Äôs more akin to ROT having their face covered in chocolate and a chocolate cake vendor working for them but denying they ate any chocolate cake.

---
Strongly provable:  
---
1.) Rare RSN hacks  
---
2.) High-value gold account hacks  
---
3.) Leaking updates to RoT in advance (as well as involving them heavily in design guidance)  
---
4.) Leaking DMM final location to RoT in advance (specifically al-kharid one)

Reference sheet for proof &amp; timeline of Jed activities:

---
For the IP grabbing, I'd say it's **HIGHLY LIKELY** that Jmod powers were used. 
---
Proofs:
---
1.) Cheeky Alerb ddos'es took place in **Oct** 2017 - suspiciously close to the first RSN hacks (**Nov** 2017). IP's are a part of account recovery info, and it makes sense that Jed picked a less detectable crime to start.
---
2.) Victims tried **EVERY** trick in the book to avoid the DDoS'es. There's video proof of victim getting ddosed with 1. fresh new ip, 2. official RS client 3. no other applications open.   
---
3.) There's also video proof of a victim getting DDoS'ed **while pk'ing on a friends' account** - which should be 100% impossible and is a definite proof of heavy foul play.
---
4.) This one should be taken lightly as it's not binding evidence, but RoT internal IRC leaks have included multiple references to Jed and DDoS'ing. One example:
---
&gt; vuhsachee (nnscript@rs-rot.net) has joined #1  
---
&gt; [14:30] (@derek) vuhsachee im so happy ur on  
---
&gt; [14:30] (@derek) lemme get some ips
---
 
---
With the information we have nowadays about the Jmod power abuse, all the pieces finally line up together. 
---
I think this is solid proof that the IP's were not "normally obtained" (aka databases &amp; grabbers), and were pulled up from the account recovery info pages that Jed later ended up abusing for account hacks as well.
---
This is most of why i dont enjoy HCIM content (anymore). I've seen far too many DC deaths to give a shit at this point, theres no thrill in watching someone do difficult content, especially when they play the gamemode as "i'll just play it as a regular ironman if i die". At that point you didnt really lose anything, other than a "bragging" status. 
---
In Gunschili's case, i just dont care for his HC due to the ways he approached the gamemode. I'm all for playing it safe, but he was having friends help him out by tanking mobs etc during quests, or going with him into wildy to do clues. That kind of ruins the ironman part of the gamemode.
---
Lmao can't lie one game there were only 2 of us at the purple portal and that was the first to go down, like 5 spinners spawned and we we're just panicking tryna kill them.

Personally, I'd like all Guild Teleports to be bonus perks in addition to perks actually relevant to the skill. The reason we asked for Skillcape perks in the first place was so the skillcapes would be useful when skilling; Crafting Guild teleports dosn't make the cape anymore useful for Crafting... Thus my stance that Teleports aren't perks.

RoT thanking Jed on their forums for all the IPs.
---
Slayer has been drastically sped up over the years, so I don't mind if some updates slow it down a tad. If you really dislike those tasks, you can always block or skip them. But I think it is stupid to add special bonus blocks just because certain tasks are unpopular and that it is harmful to the skill to make such exceptions. Slayer isn't supposed to be only tasks of things you want to kill; it is intended to give you a reason to kill things you wouldn't otherwise kill.

I don't think we will see any stats get changed to be able to go over 99 in osrs, it has too much of an RS3 vibe
---
The reason for no Strength related gear is to balance the other options.
---
You're multiplying zero by zero, zero times. So it's still 1.
---
Wintertodt is good because it not only gets you a little cash but also other resources that will be helpful later on. I know many people say to get 99 firemaking there whilst you're still lvl 3.

No. It's a known IG meme account with 20k followers.

Why should there only be one belladonna patch? Annoying af that it takes so long to grow and only having one, every other type of patch that people use has multiple available. Been grinding for a year to get enough belladonnas to match my poison berries
---
Huh? Warren is almost 70 years old. College was way cheaper than it is now. I have never heard of anyone that went to college in the 70s "drowning in debt."

Cost me 20-30m on scales from 85-99. Keep that in mind.

Spoken like a true RoT member, I'm confident most clans would've been fine with RoT winning had it been legitimate. I won't deny that RoT was good at multi fighting but as I said earlier, they ruined the integrity of many tournaments and it's confirmed.
---
No one likes to kill is a subjective thing. They may not always know if players will like or dislike a new creature, but the solution is usually to improve the creature than to pretend like it doesn't exist. And they have already tweaked them because of this. Also, this isn't the same as a quest like with Fossil Wyverns where players avoid the quest to skip the task; this is baseline like Harpie Bugs, Killawatts, Waterfiends, and the other post-Slayer task additions.
---
But in general, saying "I dislike this task so give me an extra block for it" is not a good thing. I don't think they should have offered it for Fossil Wyverns since it set a bad precedence. Like you could argue that Konar assigns a lot of Dragons which makes you feel punished for completing DS1 (required for Dragon Tasks) so you want a toggle for all Dragons... And before you say that is not the same thing, even for Duradel, he has higher weights for Dragons (9 Black, 7 Steel, 5 Iron, and 4 Blue) than for Wyrms and Drakes (8 each).
---
Yea I skip all Drake and Wyrms tasks, they are absolutely garbage haha. I'm ok spending cancel points every time though, I feel like the 6 slots currently available is more than generous already
---
I really like this idea. Doesn‚Äôt devalue anything and gives perks (Most skullcaps perks are useless anyway) for you achieving your 99. For Skill capes that don‚Äôt have a guild, potentially teleport to location such as Agility mentioned above, could teleport your to most agility courses, Prayer to the Monastery, Fletching to Seers Bank, and so on. They might be repitive teleports since of jewelry, redirection scrolls, and diaries but it‚Äôs a perk worth having for you to achieve the 99

Can also do Belladonna patch last; that's what I've ended up doing. I also use the Draynor Manor teleport tablet so it's not a pain in the ass to go there last.
---
Fuck yes! Thank you
---
I did the same thing. I also was like YEAH ILL JUST DH THE PORTALS. Don‚Äôt do that in veteran boat. Games end too quickly and it‚Äôll feel like s chore real quick to get 1hp and points.
---
Found the RoT member
---
If you are that high combat I assume you still have a fair amount of brews/restores left over. That being said when healers come try getting their aggro one at a time. As in pray, attack one, check prayer again then attack another. It will take longer but less prone to mistakes.
---
&gt; Ok so clearly you don't understand context, but most people do.
---
It has nothing to do with understanding the context, the context is irrelevant. If you're botting to save starving children, or botting to kick puppies, they're banning you either way. They want everyone to know that they're banning you either way.
---
&gt; People were surprised he was banned for botting in a totally harmless way.
---
And that's why this was done. To inform those people that Jagex does not view any botting, in any circumstances, as acceptable.
---
&gt; what good did that do?
---
All those people that were surprised, now know they can't bot on alts for any reason. Jagex doesn't them to cheat, because they don't want to have to ban then, because that costs them money.
---
&gt; It's not like the game's integrity was under threat from trick or treat bots.
---
The game's integrity is under threat by blurring the line of what is, and what is not, against the rules. It is a very clear line right now: ANY botting means you and all your accounts are getting banned. No confusion, no doubt, no gray area.
---
Never going to happen. RS3 is over there -&gt;
---
Well, it's run on a VPS and the account was created on a VPS. Jagex doesn't normally chain ban bots. In a situation like this though, they might.
---
Gz on the guy that got all the songs unlocked

as much as i want to agree with you, at the end of the clip the guy wearing dragon later goes on to say "wow lag everyone in my cc says they lagged too" and they werent a part of the stream just a random bystander
---
Do not engage with these types of people. They‚Äôre disingenuous and always argue with bad faith to waste your time.
---
Yup, it makes it even more impressive that Runescape's sound designers did all of these great songs with just a general midi soundfont.
---
Looks like the background of a "lo-fi hip hop beats to chill and relax to 24/7" stream
---
Yeah college tends to be super expensive when you give out loans to everyone who asks for them. Of course they are going to hike up prices, thanks leftists.

Has Jagex ever responded about the RoT drama or did they keep their head in the sand about it ?
---
This clan is toxic af
---
there goes my hero
---
I hope the reason these bots are still so prolific is because they're saving them for another bot-busting stream.
---
I was on another world and got a major lag spike as well. Server maintenance seems to have brought some issues.
---
I feel like they are fully capable of doing so. Maybe they are just taking a different approach.
---
Because he would've reposted everything from that IG for more followers. Seems a bit odd to have a Reddit account as old as his and this is the first post from that IG. It's likely he just stumbled across it and thought "I can post this to Reddit for karma". Use your brain plz.
---
It‚Äôs a meme starting with people not hiding their user in screenshots and then getting targeted with phishing/hack attempts.
---
Great for low/mid zul-rah
---
So I've done this a lot since the mace came out on several accounts. Its more checked spot now then it was several months after release, but its far far more checked by lv 80ish pures then mains for some reason (i barely got bothered when i got 99att/str on my max range tank for instance, but my 1def pure got attacked a bunch).
---
Its not hard to pay attention and tab before they get a tb off, theres a singles area not far away either you can use to try to escape a team as well. 
---
Its probably worth bringing some anti gear as a pure. Most of the ppl that attack you are going to be super shit pkers and probably easy to k0 (esp if they are also 1 def). 
---
I'd probably bring only enough ether for 12mins at a time (1 extended anti fire dose) but bring the full pot. I think it'll be about 300 ether. 
---
Gauge how often you get attacked doing that. Sometimes you'll last awhile w/o getting bothered, others not.
---
Basically what I did was anglered and used an imbued heart at bank before goin up. Stayed under the effect of anti fire, then would tab out, use my pool, re heart/angler and head back up. Sometimes I stayed for a full anti fire pot w/o banking but not a lot. This was on my tank so I was risking like 1m for best exp rate. So a little more precaution went into it.
---
If you don't want to lose money, bring a looting bag and pick up the ranarrs. They should pay for the ether and pots. The elder robe drops are bonus/pay for deaths. 
---
Also look out for skull tricks from players dressed in full elder robes (turn player attack options to right click only).
---
Doesn‚Äôt bad faith mean the person is just fucking with you to win the argument? our community here is actually this dumb, they believe this shit. It‚Äôs an obvious result of never leaving your house or experiencing empathy for people dissimilar to you tho

I know it doesn't help or do any good but I if I happen be passing by I like to spam the door and watch them run around into the walls. Until the door gets "stuck" that is. "Fucking bots" I say to the void, one guy "hey I'm a person :("

Imagine calling super fucking weird racism all the time just ‚Äútalking‚Äù. eat shit, bitch
---
You said it yourself, magically
---
What does mine say?
---
Boarding could be a part of it tbh. Have a naval battle with one person navigating and the others doing odd jobs like using cannons or rigging sails to go faster.
---
Then a melee can break out or you can range/mage each other if your ships are close enough. But everyone gets sailing exp.
---
Could be based on an expedition system to have loot on your ship and the other team gets it in PvP if they manage to claim your ship/a portion of it if they sink you. Youd have to have a massive sea with numerous islands on it though like sailing was supposed to have.
---
Basically what I'm saying is make dungeoneering but with boats and pvp and actually good.

I don't support banning them, but these people should absolutely be openly ridiculed and told to grow up.
---
Holy shit you're triggered. Maybe Reddit is a little too much for someone as sensitive as you, try Neopets forums instead
---
I don‚Äôt agree with some of the disgusting things people say but it‚Äôs never ok to censor people imo. Everyone should have the right to share their opinions, even if they‚Äôre shit. Banning is the worst possible way to approach this. Just ignore people.

Disagree that they're an eye sore, I like seeing them if I ever tele there
---
Imagine trying to debate politics on a RuneScape sub
---
Just let it go man, can‚Äôt fix stupid
---
I do not think this is the proper solution. I think if they just reduced the task weights to like 5 or 6 for Wyrms and 4 or 5 for Drakes, it would be fine. Also, it would be nice if Wyrms were hostile mobs and not neutral. That would help a lot with the enjoyment factor.

I snagged 800 d bones and torags legs off a dinh's the other night.  Killed some nakeys that had 50-200 noted bones and a couple were lava and superiors.  Rart pvmers love risking shit while not wearing anything for defense.
---
You pick the 5 easiest bosses on Normal, instead of Hard. Normal bosses will rarely hit you, so one inventory of absorption pots will last 6+ hours. Since you're in combat, the logout timer is 20 minutes. I usually set a timer for every 18 minutes on my phone and click. 
---
To take this to the next level, install Chrome Remote Desktop tool (by Google) on your PC and on your phone and enter the NMZ. Then, every 18 minutes, click on the Remote app on your phone, and then click anywhere on the screen to reset the Runescape timer. Since you're logged in on your PC, you can close out of the mobile app whenever you want without signing out. I've gotten millions of exp at work doing this, leaving RS running on my home PC. It only takes a second to click the app and reset. Since you only click 3 times per hour, it takes almost no effort.

It's literally in the ToS we've all agreed to. They can ban any account for any reason, or no reason at all.

But no one has given literally any other explanation besides "precedebce."

Nope. Nopenopenopenopenopenopenope.

context please
---
&gt; The game's integrity is under threat by blurring the line of what is, and what is not, against the rules.
---
Except your "worst case scenario" here is that people think that making completely harmless bots that *contribute* to the game is a bad thing.
---
Again: **nobody is going to think that regular botting is ok because somebody gave out some halloween sweets and didn't get their main account banned *as well as* all the bots.**
---
Your entire argument revolves around "the rules are the rules because those are the rules".

Is there a reason people always cannon the ogres outside of castle wars?? I‚Äôm a noob and always see people doing that there so thanks

&gt; It was never counterproductive to raid more hours. Sure they got less and less efficient
---
I'm saying that you can do better things with that time than smash attempts into a fight.
---
&gt; you can watch Method stream for 12+ and still play to a level they are happy playing with.
---
But they are world class players in relatively good physical and mental health for the most part. The shitters in your "world top 300" guild are not going to get anything going 12+ hours.
---
&gt; I have raided 10 hour days, and you never get that tired where you start 'de-learning' a fight, per say.
---
You might get that way but I've seen the results of 8+ hour days on my guild, and the fights get objectively worse after 8-9 hours.
---
They have to play at very high levels of efficiency in order to max in that timeframe. Lots of tick manipulation, paying zmi runners, and cannoning slayer tasks.

It's obviously not true in the extremes. Just because my numbers are semi-realistic doesn't mean you have to use absolutes.

~300 defence in all areas but magic, so about as strong [better in some stats worse in others is why I say that] as third age, both only being beaten in non-degradable melee stats by Justicar. I'd say that qualifies for 'stupid strong' for level 60 gear.

Ty, i should probably just get my range up a little more. Melee is pretty high but I can't seem to hit him

The only idiots that get brute forced are ones who have ‚Äúpassword1‚Äù or ‚Äúhunter2‚Äù as their password.
---
Also don't grind seaweed spores, they spawn about as fast as you use them.  Just pick some up right by the farming patches.
---
The spirits of all banned bots end up in ya basement
---
The reasoning behind it is they regularly DDoS and do other scummy things in the wilderness as well as got one of their members to become a J-Mod and hack/leak info on big bank accounts, but they _did_ win so it should stay as-is until a new tournament is hosted and they win again lol
---
Except the whole thread is about that? Sorry you have negative IQ
---
There may be some copyright issues there. Im not sure how parody/cover laws work in this scenario though.
---
That's pretty intense, although it depends on your given stats, for sure. To add onto that, Melee Void doesn't even get the same buff as Range/Magic with Elite, so it could be more competitive numbers for those styles, too.
---
Still no defense, sadly, but that's what trade-offs are for!
---
I know but do they only hack my runescape acc or do they also havk other things. I don't really care about my runescape account.

As I said, you need to use L'Hopital's rule.

1^infinity is not 1 that's true, but it can be treated as 1 for any real world math. The lim x -&gt; ‚àû 1^x = 1. Just as the lim x -&gt; 0 x^0 = 1. It never technically gets there, but it gets literally infinitely close.
---
&gt; The thing is we don't know what it is, it could even be 19.
---
We do know what it is, it's undefined. That does not make it 19, it's never 19, it's not unknown. It does not exist. But it does exist as a limit. That's why we treat 0^0 as 1.
---
It's not zero times zero.
---
CML has a fuckton of broken records. Not sure if some are buggy, but some are from Jagex manually giving people's stats back due to some update mistakes
---
To be fair it would be easier to believe with evidence. Not everyone has the ability to just accept things without asking questions, which is only useful for dogmatic thinking.

Do you catch sharks in ration sized chunks of shark meat tho?

You may already have it but Piety is of course a great unlock

Love it.  Should be animated into a gif with rain

looking pretty scary but not being able to attack the opponent is a lot scarier.
---
I advice you to kill revs for an hour to make money and use that money towards crafting. Much more efficient than settling for 100k gp per hour and getting terrible crafting exp
---
Its still not 1
---
Feels like it would be game breaking for 1 attack pures. Imagine if a 1 attack 99 def 75 str pure could just smack ya with a rune warhammer aftet a barrage of bone dagger p++ pokes.

okay what I meant, is if you aren't PKing you don't really care about the combat level, so might as well be 75 attack, yes?

This statement is mostly accurate, there are a few exceptions to it. The only one of the top of my head is within the woodcutting guild, boosts above 99 stack with the invisible boost, I believe its stated on the wiki as well.

How did they fuck up in regards to that specific statue? I agree they've fucked up pretty much every DMM and how they handled the Mod Jed stuff, but the statue is from the clan cup - something Jagex hasn't hosted in 4 years. 
---
I mean maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I don't remember mass outrage over the J-Cups back when that's the pvp event Jagex used to host. 
---
It was definitely preferable to DMM, actually organized the clanning communities against each other rather than the mish-mash of fuckery that happens to lead up to DMM finals.

There's obviously HCIM that are going for this, you get a permanent spot on a leaderboard. If anyone was successful, it would be on the page. It wouldn't fall through the cracks
---
Dba?
---
It effects yeild atleast
---
With the power of booze and basketball, nothing can stop you
---
They can't hack anything else, unless you used the same email/password combo. What happened was they grabbed you IP address and sent a D/DoS attack to your network. You didn't get any viruses or anything, you're all good. Just change your password and make sure not to use that same password again anywhere else.
---
You sure about that?
---
Or just use draynor manor teleport.
---
It definitely is for sand crabs
---
Mother fucker!!!!
---
Cool didn't say that there wasn't but kbd is a very safe way of grinding d pock on a hcim
---
It crashed when CoX was released since there were newer, more useful high tier items added to the game.
---
It regained some value as people started buying them back as they made more money, and out of speculation that it would be useful in ToB.
---
It crashed again on the release of ToB when it proved to be unhelpful.
---
Maybe those tomes from killing criminals for shayzian house? You get a shit ton of tombs cannoning them and I'm pretty sure you can bank them.

When construction was introduced placing a scrying pool in the dungeon is what led to the 6/6/6 Falador Massacre, if you would scry whilst PvP was toggled 'on' undergroundthen having the owner eject all from the house, the attack option would remain. This is what happened on 6/6/6 @ Cursed You's house party and maybe why the game kicks you outside the house now, to keep the world safe from it all again... at least for the time being :}
---
Inflated items based on ‚Äúhype‚Äù and less on functional use would likely drop - like 3a. A good example of this is when Ely dropped by 300-400m just because tbows were released and took its place. 
---
A new gp sink could easily be implemented. However, the duel arena has already removed years of gp that‚Äôs come into the game. They could probably hold off on another major gp sink for a while. First thing that comes to mind though is a small tax on items sold in the GE.
---
Oof. Almost like ya coulda done that 10min ago lmao
---
Wonder how much it cost him smh
---
Or they could do little things like this lad did to help increase their bot control effectiveness.
---
Finally, gosh..
---
True. Oughta see rotmg, just as bad if not worse.
---
The official rule is "player run games of chance" in the case of staking, it isn't player run. The game is pretty much the host.
---
Good for you man! Personally I stopped smoking completely when I got really into osrs because for some reason I just cba to do anything but watch youtube videos when I‚Äôm high. No motivation to grind at all.
---
Yup
---
But would it? There is SO MUCH in the game
---
I mean I could have, I was mainly curious how accurate this list was.. obviously not very.
---
Fuck yeah
---
Dude he didn't say "I never pk" he said it's not his main activity...
---
Man if only Jagex was big enough company to have funds to hire people making bot detection and spam detection automated.
---
Again, who says they don't?  He's reporting them (as many others do) and then they get dumped.  There's a good chance they're going to get dumped even if we didn't report them.  Not even for botting, but for breaking the rules in other ways.  It's really naive to think Jagex don't already do this.
---
Ice trolls from fremmy isles
---
You'd have to do Falador hards to do it efficiently, there's better alts to make than Mole but it wouldn't be too bad.
---
Yeah its an odd location with little to offer. I wanted to use it a couple times when I was taking breaks from canafis agility. Was grinding out early graceful on my ironman and didnt have teleports yet. Now I have ghosts ahoy done and will never need to use the shortcut. Even more so after I get access to fairy rings.
---
My dude, the fact that you think the a definition is the a good defense of fucking 16 year olds tells me all I need to know about you. 
---
Much like the guy who tried to make the case about age of consent (which becomes irrelevant with specific age gaps ANYWAY and is only meant to protect other children around those ages) I've only got one thing for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flBqojLpAnI
---
this guy is a pedobear....you're likely just as creepy since you feel the need to feverishly defend him. Go rub one out to your weebo pillow and fuck off already.
---
Im not a millionaire.
---
It increases your max hit with obby weapons by 20% when also wearing the full obby armor set.
---
All the quests, reqs and shit . Plus I study full time
---
Suck it up, Buttercup.
---
73. I want to level out all my stats to 80, But I always keep putting it off and just do slayer lol. Just started actually working on 2000 total as well! doing some winterdot right not now for 85 Firemaking so I can finish my master clue possibly as well.
---
Ah ok then thank you! I will try after I hit 100k on this :) ty
---
... So?... Does he think that woodcutting is somehow making me pleasure my wife any better?
---
Dwh actually feels p nice for cerb. It almost always hits cuz its crush and makes ur subsequent hits nearly unmissable
---
S
---
Why were you at the GE on an ironman?
---
There's no point in even trying, millionaire or not.  If your phone has 1.5GB of ram, the processor is most likely going to be shit and not even worth playing on.
---
it would be 200 gp at lowest
---
I see someone's subscribed to r/antifastonetoss
---
Yeah, but let's say you get a recording of yourself getting disconnected. Jagex wouldn't be able to tell if it was your ISP that failed, or if it was their servers that failed. If you disconnect because of your router or something other than Jagex's end, then that's on you and doesn't warrant HCIM status back, imo. Which is why streaming a disconnect is solid proof that it was 100% the servers fault. If only there were an on-screen network graph that could indicate if the server is tanking (like other games), then I think it would work.
---
Thanks for the self esteem boost ü§ô
---
Great suggestion.
---
- It makes sense, war hammers demand strength to lift but less technical skill than swords
---
- Might let warhammers not be useless sometimes?
---
- Not a merch attempt because they‚Äôll remain at alch value anyway
---
Please let trailer park boys rs memes make a return.
---
While we're cutting holes in fences, could we also do one in Mcgrubor's Woods by fairy ring ALS for easier access to the hops patch?
---
Depends on where you intend on pking
---
https://imgur.com/UlaWo7X Case closed indeed. Fuck you by the way :)
---
There's a spell on the lunar spellbook that lets you give your special attack energy to another player. If you have two alts doing this ans then restoring at a pool, you can spec constantly.
---
Gertrude?
---
that attitude was actually more rampant back in its hey day. The places that were known to be most efficient were packed. Youd be lucky to find a coal mining spot in al kharid. Youd be lucky to have consistent combat with hill giants in edgeville dungeon because it was too crowded. If you world hopped youd probably find more people than the place you left making it a gamble. World hop to chance finding less people or give up your spot in this one.
---
I'm talking about when you have multiple options of things to craft, pressing the number keys lets you select which one to make instead of having to click it.
---
11$
---
What is the best boots for magers then?
---
I mean, it's obvious why it's like that, but it still bugs me that they have to so blatantly go against common sense to make the game balanced.
---
How do they ban all your accounts, based on your IP?
---
just birdhouses. I get 2, 20 min breaks a day and whenever I go to the bathroom I'll do a quick run. going to add tree or herb runs to it aswell soon. can do 3-4 runs of BHS during my 8 hour shift
---
I beat him with 72 range and early to mid 70s in most other stats, it costed me about 2m or so. I didn't really bother with vorkath until I hit 90 range, supplies are absolutely brutal before that and kills take so long that you have a good chance at not even getting one kill. 
---
I would really suggest sinking a few mil in chins and just getting 90 range, those extra levels make a dramatic difference. Can kill almost 3 per trip at 92 range, when at like 88 range I was getting about 1.
---

---
I looked up a min ago, my phone has 2gb ram.
---
When the app came out, it was there, on the play store, it played well with no problems but later it needed and update and i couldnt do it because the app wasnt there for my phone anymore so i deleted it.
---
This guy politely requested a comment...
---
how were you fighting 1 def pures? you'd be way higher combat level
---
They never changed the email/password on my account.  Just logged in, took everything and suicided my account to I'd guess themselves or an alt.
---
So I still have the account, but I don't feel motivated to play it.
---
nice troll
---
dont worry, neither is Blizzard..
---
or GGG...
---
or Riot...
---
I cannot find a game where player input matters : ( 
---
OSRS is the best I have found so far.
---
Eternals are BiS for magic, but they aren‚Äôt as beneficial to magic as primordials are to melee if you get what I mean. In raids for example, eternals are not good enough to justify an inventory slot so people will keep their Prims on while maging or just take them off.
---
Found the dds pure
---
I never said that it was an intentional nerf, I actually said the opposite.
---
And nah never gonna do them as they‚Äôre really inefficient
---
Notice how I said, "am both"  you can just make the tablets
---
Hop on any total world and they're gone.
---
Once I get to that point. Still at 64.
---
A lot of things ruin the game and bots farmers arebt the only people who sell gold either.
---
It was a hectic two or three days and I still haven‚Äôt gone back
---
I mean if you can already afford that expensive an item I‚Äôd take sgs over it all day. Blowpipe if ranging
---
I've lost track of time - but last weeks may have been the one where someone posted a bunch of passwords in the chat, prompting them to delete it
---
Indeed
---
You?
---
I say it as it shouldn't be a surprise. Everyone under the sun knows it's not a good idea. I even called it "shit". Dafuq u on tonight Mr. Mod?
---
The Kraken pet is afraid of the whirlpool.
---
I've decided to up the ante.
---
This is the kind of thinking we need for the game :)
---
Now for med helms and square shields... (I guess chainbodies have a niche for crush defense?).
---
no accounts get temporarily locked after a few incorrect logins
---
You could afk mine essence so much faster, the profit margin would be huge. And a 2k pure essence drop worth 200k? Sign me up
---
That's true, but it also depends on which build we're talking about. Obby tanks are in a higher level bracket and could definitely use the extra accuracy.
---
And don't forget would also affect PvM. Pretty sure it would improve exp rates on skills like slayer, which could make some maulers unhappy.
---
Five hours are up, reminder turn on 'runelite' filters!
---
VPN on, ran on VM, neighbors wifi
---
Reminds me of Courage‚Äôs room from Courage the Cowardly Dog, granted the computer is in the wrong corner
---
I see then. So slayer is pretty much blowpipe for range and whip for melee then. And tasks that can be barraged is when magic comes into play.
---
I remember it being 150 and the RS3 wiki has prices back to May 2008 which shows it being 160 at that point. 4.2k/trip and about 30 trips an hour would make it roughly 170k/hour. With the only requirement being one of the fastest quests in the game, it was pretty decent.
---
Stop trying to make the game easier. You know what you signed up for. Deal with it.
---
This is correct!
---
D
---
open
---
Someone said the same thing on my Facebook page for my art! Lol. I see it though.
---
get 75 rc, go to the zmi world and join the cc they're spamming to advertise and offer to run for people
---
Tfw you have to wake him FROM a whirlpool.
---
To be safe id use their computer as well
---
ohh! duhhh
---
You're right check the article he linked it says it there.
---
They lose stored items, which is essentially their entire "bank"
---
Anything a UIM stores at a boss collection chest is going to be valuable supplies, PvM gear, etc.
---
It still isn't super detrimental, but a chat icon changing color is way less punishing.
---
I think wilderness shortcuts are the biggest bullshit, there already massive risk to be that deep in wildly why make it even harder unless you do dairies.
---
This was a little bit short video but if you wait under him, attack, go back he wont hit you. Its just slow since you have to wait for like 5 seconds before attacking him again.
---
I mean yeah they do because they are faster
---
3k kc since January? Seriously doubt it.
---
Thanks man, appreciate the help, I‚Äôll do exactly that.
---
-laughs with untrimmed slayer- who's the loser now? Probably still both of us
---
lol i should do this
---
i like asking what they had for breakfast.
---
Easy. Remove or lower the attack penalties from meds, which might make them a tanky alternative to early magic/ranged gear - especially on F2P, since it lacks good options for both. As for the square shields, I'd go the chainbodies road: give them a single bonus that would match or be greater than kites'. (Crush, ranged?)
---
I just don't see how anything more complex could work.
---
1/10 is rate for someone getting a purple, roughly. If you mean 1/10 in your name then yes you are unbelievably lucky.
---

Bountiful here

&gt;which is up to the individual officer.
---
LEOs don't make the decision to push for probation (or any charge), that's down to the judge. This is all part of the judicial system, which is why people call it a systemic issue. 
---
Whether you agree or disagree doesn't really matter, certain races receive different penalties/lenience for the same crimes. They're also policed differently based on things like economic status (which ties into the areas they live), which if you go back just a generation you'd see the influence that race has to do with that status. 
---
This treatment doesn't just apply to black people, even white people with lower socio-economic status will face prejudice that anybody from a higher class won't deal with, but the amount of people in that economic grouping does have to do with historical prejudice.
---
I just wish I were a woman. I like the armor designs more often, too.
