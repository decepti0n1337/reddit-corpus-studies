I read the entire thing and agree you should get your money back, but why even include the part about staking? You could’ve just had the very beginning and the very end parts and been fine but you wanted to fit in this flex.

I think you're over-exaggerating. If you want the benefits all you have to do is plant a new seed. You don't have even have to change gear. It is literally faster than doing a birdhouse run, which can be done in under 2 minutes. If life gets busy then you aren't playing the game so you don't get the benefits anyways. There is no penalty for not playing.

What you described in your post is essentially how pretty much all farming works, so I don't fully understand your argument.

Yes but it works best with two people. Freeze graador and trident/sang staff him to death. You're better off freezing and swapping to ddarts bp for dps though.

Alright good, you showed your run energy gz say goodbye to your account. Nah but really congrats I’m jealous 
---
Just so you know, I've actually done this from 70-75-70 to 80-90-80 and you get more xp/hour and NMZ points if you do hard rumble and Dharok's, sure obby is easier and more afkable but i've gotten better xp rates since I've switched starting at 75-80-80.
---
I really like this idea.
---
I remember before this glorious game came out I played private servers. One called Pattonscape had a glitch where you could equip multiple rings. Used to put on 20-30 BiS rings and hit 250’s like it was nothing. 
---
is there a way for faster farming exp other than buying trees for your house which is really expensive? i want to start raids and have all the stats and gear but a low farm level and don’t want to have to wait for my tree runs to get 2 levels a day at level 30.
---
1. Doric's - don't have the mining level for clay or iron ore. would need to grind that (with a bronze pick, mind you)
---
2. Rune mysteries used to be in the route before X Marks the Spot was released. It's faster to substitute due to not having to go to Wizard's Tower again.
---
3. Corsair Curse is also a fairly lengthy quest for the run, much like how Misthalin Mystery is 10-15 minutes. And actually, on a fresh account, you're REALLY poorly equipped to fight Ithoi (55 hp, max hit 6, no safespots).
---
4. Knight's sword isn't really RNG, it just requires 10 mining. Worth for a mining route Dragon Slayer run.
---
5. Moss Giants for Dragon Slayer run are useful for leveling up magic, getting law runes, and the biggest thing: steel bars for the steel nails. The alternative would be have low combat stats and do a mining/smithing grind.

Thanks for taking interest and asking questions.

Reeeeeeeepost
---
Bad. Get your mind out of the gutter and go to church
---
Because that's the only reason I was trading that much GP between accounts before the update. If I hadn't been trading at all it wouldn't have disappeared. That's the only reason I mentioned it. Not to flex. 
---
People who know the PK scene well. I'm 70 def and want to stay there. Should I stay 75 attack or gradually get 99? 
---
It wasn't all stakes but a good portion of it was. I've been doing a lot more pvm on my account lately since im around 108 combat. 
---
Wait are all those runes from one run with Morytania hard diary ? 
---
It doesnt have to be easier just more fun
---
Literally what I did at Sparc's tribe event last night.
---
How brain-dead are people.
---
Yeahhhhh that’s was 100% wrong and made you look stupid as fuck lol.
---
Yeah, there you go. You could’ve just said you were trading the gold from your main to your alt or whatever, you didn’t need to go on a giant tangent about dueling
---
How dare YOU?
---
Even Swampletics is dissapointed by the lack of mind runes. 
---
That's expensive
---
Get 41 more and maybe you'll get some luck.
---
I got to about 1450 before I got my first. Keep going! Defeat the final boss RNG!
---
Did 94 str on my pure through afk nightmare zone and slayer
---
If somebody tells you can you let me know, also curious
---
That's like finding a five leaf clover, it doesn't mean anything.
---
Gz though
---
probably never, the devs have no fucking clue what they're doing when it comes to pvp and the playerbase spite votes every suggestion into oblivion.
---
Lame
---
No camel toe. Pass. 
---
Yeah. They do provide unfair advantages. Denying they don't provide advantages is just plain stupid. You're retarded. I don't know how you could possibly argue that they don't give advantages. They provide people with information otherwise not known by a vanilla client user. They show people how to play the game without any experience. These are advantages third-party clients provide.
---
&gt;buhh it's free
---
so are bots
---
&gt;  Jagex keeps the overpowered features in check. 
---
no they do not, it's an open sourced project and anyone can get their hands on older "banned" plug-ins and/or simply create their own, which people have done and are doing, because they can. Along with the recent fiasco about the PKing 'bots' and then Settled's Swampletics using the developer tools to bypass a game mechanic. Totally fair bro it's free.
---
&gt;If they didn't want it they would have continued the lawsuit against them 
---
yep they could have filed a DMCA against their github and gotten Discord to kill their server, but that would just be dumb and would not benefit the game so there is no purpose to following through with that
---
People downvote if your criticize anything that’s “free” and someone made “an effort” to make. So people don’t criticize. I got downvoted for complying about a stream cutting out to commercial during a crucial point of the stream 
---
75 att, 70 def, and 70 prayer for magic would max you at 108 combat with 99 str, range, and magic.  Its what I use for pking and it works really well.  99 att really isnt worth the extra combat lvls in my opinion.

Tekton

Tithe farm

Herbs, allotments, and tithe farming

So the people who don't want to spend hundreds of hours recoding and testing something(that already works) are more lazy than the people who are upset about 2 extra clicks because they dont know how to price stuff... Ignoring the fact the game is litterally just clicking all the time anyway? get gud ezscaper

Herb runs?

Thing is, slayer is new for me, so I know nothing about good and bad tasks.

I’ll take the spoiler. 
---
Jagex really needs to hire a developer who actually PKs since Ayiza left. Things that need to be fixed ASAP for PvP:
---
- CC glitch (a whole rework/redesign would be awesome for clans too).
---
- Loot bug.
---
- PvP bots and scripts.
---
- significantly nerfing wildy altar suicide method.
---
- Stop adding loads of worlds makes it so much harder to find people in the wild.
---
- Stop making wildy only content outside of wild (Rune pouch, side note: also remove konar elite reward of more slayer points per further devalue wildy slayer).
---
- Remove impact protect from magic prayer has on entangle (integrity update).
---
- F2P Teleblock - F2P is dead and it has only failed because members hop to F2P world in the wild to get ‘risk free access’.
---
Could of had both though
---
Im sorry onyx ruby e but theyre 163 loss now unless you can buy under but i dout that low
---
The best bosses to use for melee or ranged is Moss Giant, Sand Snake, Ice Troll King, Count Draynor, and Arrg. Those bosses give bonus xp and/or have low defences
---
1/10k sounds good to me.
---
Why the fuck are people spamming Tekton
---
Not boostable either
---
Well it's a 1/5k drop so not having it after 2.5k kc isn't really dry
---
Dude, you should have just contested those charges from your bank. You should probably STILL do that.
---
Yes
---
I felt like I was taking way more damage in full void ranged as opposed to dharoking melee, eating through my absorbs
---
I'll try ranged with hard rumble agains see how it goes
---
600 dry. 
---
To be honest I don't even consider them a money maker anymore, just a long ass Slayer task 
---
There are a couple rules for it. Where are you trying to use them?
---
Mike is livin large in Venezuela alongside Mod Jed
---
85 chest!!!! Only 2 equipment, Torag hammers 110k and Guthans chainskirt 725k.
---
Gz man
---
Everyone try it, I think its not just me
---
Worked for me about four hours ago
---
I immediately thought of him when Swampletics got a Dharok's helm
---
Honestly you can do casual raids without the farming level for a while
---
Literally everyone else will have the level and no one will notice if you are just grabbing vials or making potions instead of picking herbs during prep
---
I may be drunk rn but not that drunk
---
I remember this time so clearly. I had just gotten into rs seriously, like fcape, torso, zenyte items, etc. For about a month id watch him kill shamans for hoooouuurs everyday. I remember so many days just because of that and how good of a time it was in my life, like freshman year of college or something.
---
You should be at 1 HP regardless, so each boss can only hit 0 or 1 on your absorbs
---
me as a furry  (plz dont hate me) this is weird
---
me as a normal person but still not a normie this is weird

Still one of my favorite runescape memes. That face in the final panel kills me every time

You look ded m8
---
They don't work if you're in PVP Combat, this was deliberate and changed so people couldn't easily outeat people doing damage. 
---
Works in any other instance I believe though, just tested and worked fine while out of combat
---
This. I'm pretty sure the only rollbacks were for people who got xp due to a bug NOT due to the mistake on your end. It's very unfortunate, but good luck anyway.
---
At fossil island wyverns, it also was not working at kalphites, maybe I just don't understand them like I thought
---
or they are bored of it and want him to start a new HCIM so they are just spam giving him every drop

Rune arrows stay pretty consistently a low-loss alch item.

Did you just steal this meme?

dead as fuck if I may say

Just tried one. I'm at 121 hp now.
---
can one fucking person answer this seriously please? jesus christ
---
Eye rit
---
Sooooo, that’s a mulligan? :-(
---
I was at fossil island, not PVP so it should have worked
---
Is that the best for lower levels? Or should I invest time in hunter?
---
Jagex would ban the bots saying bot and ignore the botters fishing you mean.
---
You are a stronger man than most
---
I mean I just think it ruins the achievement when you buy it. 
---
And if that’s your first 99 then I really doubt you have any other stats to help build your bank. So you just bought bonds for gold. Which is fine, but runescape is more fun when you don’t pay to win
---
Yeah it worked for me once I left fossil island slayer area, maybe something about that area is coded wrong?
---
Step1: Be a girl.
---
Step2: Twitch.tv

Step3: I appreciate it sooooooooooo much (💩)Thank you!!

I was trying to explain the whole situation as my night progressed so jagex could see my story matches up with my trade history.

Hey like, Scoobs! It's totally wack in here, we better go find some grub.

Very very true

woah buddy we're respecting women tonight please delete this right fucking the fuck now

isnt this the exact method they used last time, then sent themselves down a rabbit hole for 1 year more than it should of lol

What a stupid suggestion 
---
do we really need more unlimited teleports?
---
what am i saying of course we do, upvoted
---
this is really cute i wish there were roses around konar's lil campout 
---
Too. Lose. 
---
Your situation sucks ass. I seriously suggest you consider the fact that you lost months of progress because Jagex made a mistake they're not willing to take responsibility for with you rolling lucky on the Reddit support lotto. Do they deserve your support? 
---
The status of support in this game is so awful that anyone who plays a lot needs to seriously consider these outcomes at this point. Was the journey good enough that you're left satisfied when jagex deletes your cash stack and then ignores you because your Reddit thread didn't gain traction?
---
Despite ragging being an issue for almost anyone in PVP worlds, I feel that there isn't enough awareness and enough being done to combat the issue. Players rag you because they either want money, want the satisfaction of "winning"/breaking your spirits, or just to straight-up piss you off. If you spend some time at PVP hotspots there won't be an hour without seeing people saying "permed", "off nfs", "u want rag?" etc. The fact that people (often successfully) force others to do their bidding solely by threatening with ragging shows how serious of an issue it is.

Here I have some goodies from pking:

With this I'm presenting a problem, but for now I don't have a perfect solution. I've heard someone suggest so-called "voluntary PVP mods" which would have the ability of locking players out of PVP worlds if their observed behavior is considered rule-breaking. These mods would not be able to PK during their time as a volunteer due to a conflict of interest nor can they gain any XP/be in combat with NPCs or players. How they would be contacted by other players without being harrassed for their decisions is one of the many issues I have not found a solution for yet. This is just a rough idea and by no means a full-fledged suggestion, however I think it is something that could be considered.
---
Whether or not you agree with me or not: **\*There needs to be an easier way to deal with players engaging in this type of player harrassment.\***
---
\*I made a 6 minute video explaining what is going on and what my take on ragging is, however I most-likely can not share it here due to witchhunting rules (I cba editing out all of the usernames)
---
TL;DR: Rag(bots) bad. Need better way to report/fix issue. Discuss.
---
While they're at it, the low and high alch options are grouped into one option. Please split them yo.
---
Angler alt isn’t to bad. Low effort to be honest. 
---
Nice

Thank god, someone with a bank pin, this will literally save your ass 99% of the time if it’s a secure bank pin.
---
and what the ironman got back was extremely negligible, it was a ss and a fury which takes less time to reget than 190m on a normal account does(outside of staking).
---
Best way to start grind towards fighter torso? Any good chats for players new to Barb Assault?
---
ok guys i just found a way to wear 2 rings at once, uhh... but you do have to be a guy. ill figure something out for the girls in a little bit.

Might have to go out of combat for you to get the overheal

Absolute madman

clip of tbow?
---
who's voice? 
---
I always read it in D double E's
---
IIRC after the Tbow drop he said Rigour -&gt; ACB from Sara -&gt; Inferno/ToB was the plan, but Tbow let him skip the ACB step. He wants a Lance also but i have no idea where that goes in his priority list. 
---
Strictly on the topic of Ironman only worlds, this would be op as far as the wilderness goes as noone would be able to pick up someone elses items.

Olm is a bitch to “learn” but the rest aren’t too bad. Lots of trial and error.

I think it would take longer to get to a point where Hunter would make real money than herb, but I'm not sure which is actually better gp/hour in the end
---
Barrows gloves, fire cape, base 50 stats.

Stop slut shaming, incel.

At least it wasn't HCIM Dozla. His name is more appropriate now.

If someone tells you let me know, also Tekton.

Ah yes, the ol’ bellybutton ring. 
---
yea just dont sell them now, they should go back up when summer starts hopefully.

Hate how ppl talk about the fally massacre like they were there. It happened for what, like an hour? Only 2k ppl/world. And I can personally say anyone on the east coast wasn't there, and they didn't skip school to attend cursed yous 99 party. Seems like most ppl talk about 09 like it was so fantastic when the game was already trash at that point. Anyway gl getting your shit back.

good luck mate :/ its really not fair
---
It would be better for the economy considering iron man already cannot trade with other players , items won will be held by the ironman at hand and items lost will either be lost from the economy (maintaining value) or reintroduced through Skilling as more players level .
---
Dick ride!
---
that's the dumbest thing ever
---
Nope, but a RuneLite plugin doing this is going to be released soon.
---
Was mostly wondering if someone had information on it that I had missed. I know it's been asked before and had good reception by the team, but that was almost a year and a half ago. So not sure why it hasn't been added.
---
What, i was toms to kill imps
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Thanks for the info!!
---
polar kebbits and potato seeds
---
Certain shops, certainly
---
while holding every item in the game at once.
---
No.

Bad.
---
Don't forget to not poll that dock placement!!
---
Just YouTube a guide. Use runelites plugin

You’ll tear through it with a trident

Shame there's so many fuckwits on Reddit. I know you guys are genuine mate I hope they can trace it back.

Thanks !

All of them, unless you know of any exceptions?

Welcome to your new main
---
OMG ur gonna get hacked
---
Herb runs aren’t even doing anymore on mains.
---
It's black and white with no flavor
---
Most ironmen and he'll majority everyone else doesn't even bother to make or craft the armor because so many other activities reward the items crafted 
---
My suggestion makes it more interactive with each other and also a more appealing process to gaining levels while keep the old school touch 
---
as rare as a shiny pokemon using the consecutive fishing method and shiny charm

I haven't laughed this hard all day. You do you, man

&gt;the bog tiles should have the same ID's client side because they look exactly the same, they're not graphically different and they should be treated the same on the client
---
That's not how that works
---
&gt;otherwise you can just change the tile ID's on your client and walk straight over
---
That's *really* not how that works
---
They have different ID's because they're entirely different entities in the game.
---
Changing the tile ID on your client wouldn't do anything. It would be the same as changing your cash stack to read 10m, it's not changing anything server side its just changing the text displayed to you.

IMO, the official rules are too vague in what type of services are not allowed.
---
According to the [Official Game rules](https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules):
---
&gt;Game items must only be exchanged for other items/services within the game. 
---
However, would you not agree that  the *services* bit most-likely encompasses only *legitimate* services? Since ragging is not allowed, a "ragging service" *officially* can not exist.  
---
Therefore, a ragging service can not be considered a service within the game and exchanging game items for such a "service" should be considered RWT.  
---
I plead for a change of the official rule to "Game items must only be exchanged for other items/*legitimate* services within the game.

Ss...sauce..?

Jagex staff can see the proof if they look into my account.
---
More so that they care about money maker bots
---
I stuck my wiennie in a cucumber once ,but this is much better
---
Did you read his post? You can recover accounts without access to the email or the password of the account you are recovering. Try it. 
---
The phrase 'ragging' didn't come from rags. It's a just a phrase from outside of the game. 
---
This is exactly what we need. Twitch just needs the pressure from Jagex.
---
Yeah dude, PKers will hate this guy because he just refuses to take damage now! 
---
Ive tried to turn it on then my game froze and i was too pissed to wait
---
Ill give it another try

They can influence Twitch surely, make them take more positive action?
---
Don't post on reddit then literally not our problem.
---
Its not about the fights. Wildy is high risk, high reward, basically more rewarding than anywhere else in the game. This world removes the risk. It would be extremely unbalanced.
---
Make yourself a plugin then 
---
I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself.
---
F u mike
---
I wouldn't worry too much about efficiency. Just work the skills you're interested in.  
---
Honestly, I just stopped playing the account altogether. Prob just gonna stick to other stuff for a while if Jagex is going to do me this way.
---
Go get 99 FM at Wintertodt. It’ll only take like a week and you’ll make a little money. 
---
Imagine thinking runelite is remotely close to cheating
---
Mincraft mode BTW

That time I got reincarnated as a slayer master 
---
The twisted bow in the top right should also add about 50k in value
---
I don't think you get the point of OP's comment. Piety requires a simple quest to do, rigour/augury requires you to grind hours dependent on RNG. Rigour/augury is relatively more difficult to obtain than piety.
---
I did read it, but it's irrelevant because the other pieces of OP's statements render a recovery unlikely. 
---
&gt;saw a "forgot username" e-mail from Jagex,
---
No emails are sent to the current registered email upon. Why would they attempt to change the email if they have enough information for a successful recovery attempt... if it were a successful recovery attempt, RIP his bank pin and his bank, yet that wasn't the case.
---
Whats the point in even playing the game if you are going to buy your way to sucess... lol.
---
I think it was a grown cat
---
What makes you think you do?
---
Actually, raggers tend to look for you at various other spots. Edgeville, Varrock square, even at clan wars if they know you are passing through. And if you do go somewhere else and they find you, they will complain about you "avoiding" their ragging. I'm not exaggerating, that is how serious many take their ragging.
---
But If you vote against or for something, you'll know if the opposite happens because they show poll results. 
---
Fucking hate this, miss the good old fashioned "gratz"!
---
What?
---
&gt;Amulet of glory
---
Maybe worry about your own outfit there bud.
---
Ok nvm I’m trying to recharge ring of dueling and that doesn’t work
---
You've got to be absolutely kidding me. PVM/Skiller here.. You can't possibly expect anyone to genuinely believe that you think following someone around so they can't fight in a PVP world is the same thing as someone Min/maxing? You've got to be legitimately dim-witted.
---
Stolen meme but it fits perfectly

Only jewellery made from dragonstones can be recharged

Who is this man!?

Tbf If you're dumb enough to get lured you probably staked for the money anyways

Id imagine that people who earn their wealth by playing are more careful with it, just my assumption though.

you guys removed all of the hydra pets sounds.. even the stomping noise.. now it is comparable to the zulrah pet which many players do not agree with.. but yet bandos pet/ skot as well as zam pet still have theirs.. unfair... however I along with other players do agree agree witht he elctrical phase removal as it was annoying ( I have a hydra pet ).
---
Yup good luck! 
---
You should definitely get slayer helm next. Superiors are nice after. Also saving up for the rune and seed pouches are a must. They cost around 1200 pts and 700 pts respectively.

WI was trying to casting lvl 2 enchant on a ring of dueling it keep saying, “can only be cast on emerald or jade..., and on shapes in the mage training arena”.  It just confused me. I just wasn’t reading/understanding 
---
LMFAO
---
While it would help attract new players, there are some problems with this. The first is that I doubt OSRS could ever compete with other games graphically. RuneScape has never been a game known for graphics and while RS3's NXT doesn't look bad, for the most part anyway, I don't think the graphics are really going to sell the game. OSRS is marketed as a Retro MMO and it doesn't just look retro, it plays retro. If you market OSRS with modern graphics, you'd likely get a lot of players expecting a modern game and OSRS is far from that. So I don't think better graphics would lead to as good of results as you'd think.
---
Then we get to the technical issues. First, the way the current graphics are rendered are not compatible with HD or such graphics. If we did get better graphics, it would mean replacing the current graphics too. That is why the 2008 HD update redid both Low Detail and High Detail instead of just High Detail; the only Low Details wouldn't work in the new system so they had to be reworked too. While they'd probably get it looking pretty close to how things are now, it is doubtful everything would remain exactly the same and that would not go over well.
---
But assuming they could get past that by having two different rendering system yet still letting you freely toggle between them or such, you need to consider cost, both to Jagex and the players. Part of why OSRS is doing so well is Mobile, but if you had higher quality graphics, that would have a notable impact on the size of the game and also performance. Even if they made the higher detail graphics download only on request and warned players of the risk to performance and battery life, they'd still need to support Desktop Standard, Desktop HD, Mobile Standard, and Mobile HD. They've already had a lot of trouble getting everything working smoothly on mobile and some things like the whip recolors are still broken, so adding even more versions is not going to make it easier there.
---
But the biggest cost factor is that higher detail graphics aren't easy to make. Making HD version of all the existing graphics would take years; originally Jagex had to outsource to another company on top of their artists working on that and the OSRS Team only has 4 Artists... But even if they did manage to get HD Graphics for all current content, there is still the issue of updates. Graphics can already be a bottleneck on a lot of updates since there are only 4 artists and they are near always busy as is. If you ask them to make the current lower detail stuff but also a version that is 5x more detailed, that would be a ton more work and have a huge impact on the pace of content. The simple answer may be "well just hire more artists", but even if you double the artists from 4 to 8, that may not be enough to keep the current pace while supporting higher detail graphics. Also, the cost of 4 more employees is not a trivial thing so why hire 4 more artists just to make the game look nicer when they could instead hire say, 1 Dev, 2 QA, and 1 Artist and be able to provide more content updates, like working on the suggestion backlog and addressing issues players have more quickly. So the choice isn't just "do you want optional better graphics"; if it isn't that, the same investment can be used to help other parts of the game and since most of the player base doesn't mind the current graphics, chances are they'd prioirtize other things first.

That skelebro is like” what did you get?”

again. you're camping several spots not moving continually and that's why they keep finding you. oh no you went to a pk hotspot and someone's trying to pk you. just kill em or stop getting sweaty for a sec

&gt; No, you do not need access to their current email. If you try to recover an account, it will send a link to reset to your current email, however you can select “i do not have access to this email”. It will take you to a new form where you can provide a new email for them to contact you on.

why fire cape for mage lol
---
They should try fixing their servers then.
---
There is no risk since you can just go back and pick up your own items since everyone else is an ironman and can't take them.
---
Yeah I can see his point. But you don’t have to be entitled to feel like you deserve them to be as easy
---
Ranging potions drop infrequently from lvl 63-79 zombies in Tarn's Lair, can be safespotted, and also drop rune warhammers frequently for around 125k/hr in alchs
---
I know the person who owns these bots! He's aussie and one of his accounts got over 105m fishing xp at minnows.
---
It's subjective because there are people who want to see poll results. It's personal taste, which is the definition of subjective.
---
I didn't say that hiding poll results doesn't affect the vote, which is what you seem to have thought I said.
---
They can fight in a pvp world though.
---
Haha holy shit these “raggers” are fucking pathetic.

Btw bottom of last image in your comment shows your username

ANYONE HAVING TROUBLE DOING ZULRAH LISTEN UP

type “Zulrah Helper” in on google. gaurenteed you’ll get it in your first couple tries and you’ll be an expert within 50 
---
I thought it was clear but I apologize if it was described poorly. Yes hacker used a stolen card aka not mine, then the owner of said card charged back later locking my account. Meanwhile all the bonds were transferred over to hackers account and I get fucked in the process. 
---
Im not really into questing that much. Honestly I forced myself to grind b gloves first thing on my account and did it the first 2 weeks I started. Back when i played a decade ago i was strictly a PvP player..so i never really pvmd, ever. I also never really quested. I was that guy pking with addy gloves/dragon gloves for the longest (it worked. lol got plenty of kills, Smites etc) but i knew that this account i wanted to pvm and raid etc so i forced myself. Felt proud to do it within 2 weeks of a fresh act after a 10 year layoff. I played very efficiently - it also helped me get necessary stats. I grinded out all untradeables before i really started grinding combat/slayer. So i had a pretty early fire cape etc too. Really helped my grind become more enjoyable tbh. Hitting 40s on tasks with 70 str is awesome. 
---
There are some quests i should do though, because i havent yet. Big ones are lunars, all the kourend ones, mourning end, roving elves. I think I'll get stats up for ds2 soon too. 
---
Maybe I'll work on morytania hard diaries for now. So agility. I do want 90 str though. Might afk that in nmz after a few quests. Also bursting to 94 mage at maniacal monkeys has been a thought, because i would love to do some PvP while im still mid combat level (106). 
---
dude your rng is actually sick bro, thats rare AF! 
---
&gt; Remove impact protect from magic prayer has on entangle
---
This already failed a poll. People want the protect from magic prayer to protect them from magic, believe it or not.
---
Also it makes no sense for the rune pouch to be wildy only content.  It's basically an essential item for PvM so why should it be solely accessible by PKing? Generally when PvM/skilling content gets put in the wild, it's usually more efficient or profitable than non-wildy content (wildy slayer for points, black chins, revenants), but doesn't usually contain exclusive untradeables. The notable exception to this is the mage arena capes but I'd argue those shouldn't be in the wildy either.
---
That's just plain stupid. He literally played the same way for five years. It's completely reasonable to assume that nothing was changed. Out of over a million users only about 1/5 actually browse Reddit. There's less people in Twitter and even less on the forums. There should have been a note on the login screen mentioning the xp issue in order to ensure everyone knew prior to logging on. Otherwise affected players are not at fault here.
---
 Also, the xp counters reset when the update hit so you had absolutely no way of knowing you were gaining shared experience while attacking. Jagex fucked up, plain and simple.  
---
Not dyslexic, just really really stoned. Look at those eyes, that's the face of a baked Romeo.
---
Or you can hop worlds 
---
wat.
---
Good and bad highly depends for slayer. Good can be good xp but bad gp, good gp but bad xp, high afk, etc. What are you looking for? 
---
You're doing something wrong. Obby should be better up to 94. 
---
Imagine completely forgetting Zammy Hasta exists
---
An illegal in game service is still a real in game service.  You've somehow got it in your head because its an illegitimate service, it doesn't count as a real trade in game and is therefore RWT.  That's some serious mental gymnastics.  
---
And here's the kicker.  The person paying for the rag is already breaking the rule about encouraging others to break the rules.  You don't need to do these mental gymnastics to interpret the rules like an ancient holy text in a way that pushes your agenda.  Go further down in the rules and you have a legitimate reason to get mad without any further work.  
---
I am not Huid, no. Huid also doesn't have 70 defence iirc.
---
Never really worry too much about these sort of 'stats'. It's leisure time you would've spent doing something equally non-productive, what's the difference between splitting that time equally between Netflix and other games and putting it all in OSRS if you enjoy it? As long as it doesn't infringe on your responsibilities, no harm done. 
---
You probably have a lot of AFK time as well you had in the background in the other things, so it's not as simple as RS hrs played/total time available as they'd overlap to some degree.
---
You're kinda dumb for paying up. 
---
Treat them exactly as they work now. The ornament kits are always attached, even when they break. You just can't trade the item unless you detach the ornament kits.
---
Do we have ghostly robes in OSRS? 
---
Well he has multiple accounts, you seem like those POH standers that spec + tele and someone got annoyed and began to rag you. Deserved tbh
---
I understand now! I'll leave the comment up for all of Reddit to yell at me.  
---
Probably because when your killin Vetion only risking monk robes and a team kills you 3 times trying to set up a skull trick you kind of get fed up with the pking community
---
Le'Lady *tips fatroll*

The 13 mushrooms on a stick 
---
I'd feel pretty ashamed if I wore one of these.
---
I was in your spot a few months ago, I personally quested to about 150 QP before touching any of my skills. Some major things I recommend would be 50 firemaking for wintertodt, around 55-60 magic, and when your combat stats hit the 60’s I’d grind slayer real hard. Whenever you feel up for it go for 175 QP and finish off recipe for disaster, at that point it’s smooth sailing (but a long ass boat ride) to end game content. You can also throw in some important but boring skills like agility when you feel up to it as well! It’s not a race enjoy your time :) 
---
Yes those familiar with the osrs client code, will tell you one of the first things it does, before even loading the cache, is handshake with the GE servers.
---
It me
---
Lmao, chill it's a game.
---
Well any sort of conformation is what I’m going for. Just getting someone to say it’s a active case and someone is really looking into it is my goal here.
---
It's about prestige. Pking also attracts the sort of person who enjoys ruining someone else's account. 
---
&gt;The reward isn't from killing other players, but the bosses, revs, and wildy slayer as far as pvm goes. Also 99 pray becomes a lot easier by using the wildy altar risk free.
---
This is pretty common.  I don't think Jagex has ever helped anyone with this issue.
---
I feel like this is more to get jagex to look into what has happened and not taking his word for it.   Trades over 300m are recorded apparently. So they should be able to see if its legit or not.  It has happened to a few people
---
Its the wilderness, there are no rules, nor honor, you agree to the possibility of being attacked going into the wilderness/pvp worlds. Hell theres even a pop up giving you fair warning. 
---
i mean a zammy hasta is a lot harder to procure than a d sword lol. either you spend 13m or however much its worth now or camp kril tsutsaroth, or you just go kill wyrms for a bit and get a d sword/buy it off the GE for 80k 
---
I’d be happy if they just stole my $140 I already gave and unlocked my account without making me pay another $70.
---
Imagine getting mad over something good happening to someone. How sad do you have to be to prefer everyone be miserable?
---
Perhaps to you but with accounts that are as old as the game and the amount of time put in, you have no room to speak if you want to join us come.  If not move over!
---
These problems with Jagex are ridiculous any other company would have remedied the situation.
---
just do slayer with slayer helm and it wont take you any time at all
---
Then take pk out of the situation, the risk remains the same . Items will stay until they fade and it is up to the player to make it back to find them.
---
High risk high reward
---
Update after 5 bowls of beans he has officially run out of beans. Take a moment to tell your loved ones you love them.

35 euros for 20 minutes btw
---
Cute face. I've always been a fan of runesquares. 
---
As an official-client-only normalman, I can relate.
---
wear an amulet and mine them. I think that’ll be your best bet 
---
I only ever flick it, and that's when I feel like putting in effort. It'll cost a ton in prayer pots if you just leave it on for a whole task/kill
---
Meh
---
I actually payed people 100k to some random in a cc to pay runesquares with me a couple of times.
---
There’s about 10 people that consistently spec tele at POH everyday for long amounts of time, you’re one of them it seems like. I know a few rag clans that purposely have their clan setup just to rag blacklisted members which is you probably, it’s justified for me personally you spec tele’rs are annoying af more so than raggers
---
They need to provide enough information to jagex to convince them that they are the original account owners. Some of this information can be guessed pretty easily, (age of account, existing passwords if they have been leaked) or can be social engineered out of you.
---
He gets the one drop that osrs changes everything Hcim 73 
---
K you're the one that needs to chill here dude. You're ragging on this innocent guy for nothing, acting like his expectations are completely unreasonable. That's horseshit. A crime was committed and he needs reparations immediately, not in a week and not in 48 hours. Now.
---
The blue dragons must’ve taken you ages hahaha, trolls are a little annoying because they’re locked behind a couple of quests! But that happens early on in slayer so don’t worry about it, you’ll get back to the grind soon enough. 
---
I believe after your first 5 slayer tasks you start getting points for each task, I suggest waiting till about  70 or 75 combat then you unlock good slayer masters and it’ll be a better experience overall. I had a slayer task I couldn’t do for a whole month or something cause it wasn’t viable to do till I finished a bunch of quests so it happens 
---
Do I fight players in what you consider a "fair fight"? Of course. And yes, I surely have rushed players. Have you?  I'm not trying to justify rushing or whatever and you can have your own opinion. Mainstream youtubers rush, skull trick all the time and they are endorsed by jagex. 
---
In the end what matters is that rushers aren't the ones breaking rules.
---
Lmao then just put those kind of items on drop tables, or introduce more methods that bring in higher quantity of those resources. It's really not that difficult.
---
3 torches and a tome before 150 is considered lucky. You got shafted.

---
So I still see many people asking for the right click delay on mobile to be shortened, but it has been 4 months ago since I saw the first post about the delay. Has Jagex released any statement regarding this?
---
Like, do they not consider it a problem and so are not planning on fixing it?
---
I would love to give more use to firemaking, and this also gives logs better uses as well. I'm surprised how cheap redwood logs are for being the highest level tree. 
---
bigger dipshit moment is being in the rune essence mine for any reason other than a quest
---
Why are you making this personal? This is why you're being defensive. 
---
Our different playstyles directly contribute to the way we're treated. You aren't special. You are morally bankrupt and now you face the consequences of the people you've pissed off. 
---
But yeah, keep blaming everyone else. I'm sure that'll do wonders to solve your situation. Jagex banning someone still wouldn't resolve your problem because they would just create new accounts. 
---
Don't start nothing won't be nothing. You underestimate the autism of other people in the community when you yourself are pulling some autistic shit yourself by camping a portal. Unfortunately for you, your actions are only 4/10 autism and now that you've pissed off someone that is at an 8/10, you're crying because you feel helpless in a situation you created.
---
I got all but Phoenix (inc. d axe) at 193
---
What the fuck lol
---
Well sure if you're counting that, but I don't care about time not spent in game. I get that it's possible, and it'll be quicker if you don't want to make the charcoal, but I don't buy that it's quicker given that it's 1/4 the favour. Even if it is quicker, that only really proves my point that lovakengj favour is fucked up
---
he didn't mention losing anything though and specifically mentioned they didn't get into his bank?
---
50:50. It ether happens or it doesn't.
---
RS was ahead of its time.
---
I think it adds a sort of human immersion to the game. Even in a fantasy world, if there are humans there will be conflict between them. An exchange of goods to a third party, to provide an inconvenience between an enemy and their goal, sounds pretty realistic. I think it's important to remember that at it's base, runescape is a game in a genre made for immersion. 
---
Just like Dungeons and Dragons (a game I think we can all agree MMORPG's developed from), the people running the game want their players to be interested in other characters, fascinated by quests, captivated by discovery, downcast by loss. Maybe most importantly, they want players to be able to feel a wide range of emotion while interacting with other players to enrich the experience. I mean, isn't that what we want in games? A wide experience? And if your answer is no, then I suggest examining the average gamer, and the contrast between the types of games they play. Racing, fps, sports, rpg's, all to satisfy this craving for a variety of emotions and constant attention retention. 
---
The average number of hours played by old-school RuneScape players is 3.5-4 hours A DAY. Yeah, there are people who play massive amounts of RuneScape that skew the reality of that, but it points towards the idea that an hour a day person could be considered a "casual" player or a "noob". RuneScape is such an immersive and diverse experience that we still call daily players noobs, that's crazy for a game! 
---
For that reason, I think that ragging should not be against the rules. Honestly, it's annoying, I understand. However, it adds an immersive aspect of human interaction into a game which retains player count. I understand some people don't want to feel certain emotions when playing games, but actions spur different emotions in different people. What may frustrate one may relax or motivate another. A variety options of how to experience the game results in a wider marketing audience, which means more players. At the end of the day, I think we all want to keep the number of players at a robust number. 
---
People in the comments are expressing passionate opinions, and as long as there is passionate and opposing opinions, the game will stay strong. 
---
TL;DR
---
I think the immersion of being able to hire an actual other person to do your bidding, the immersion of being able to actually have player-versus-player situations OUTSIDE of combat, the enjoyment people get from a that outweighs the inconvenience of being ragged. At the end of the day, a diverse options of ways to enjoy the game keeps the player count up and I think we all want the player count to be up.
---
Never stop being passionate, scapers!

Very nice! One question though, do you use regular ultra compost or the bottomless bucket? I seem to harvest less herbs since using the bottomless bucket for some reason, especially in combination with the Attas anima.
---
Same thing with the pope

Wow. Please tell me more about how they magically guessed a randomly generated number that changes all the time. Next time don't buy your account, dumb fuck.
---
Highly appreciate your thorough response! as a matter of fact there are many mods there that witness it happening yet they do nothing about it not to mention my reports not making it to J-mods for some reason. Not to act like a complete angel, I do have my moments yet most of my mutes are in retaliation for the same players camping me on daily basis :/

Tell me that when you experience it.

You can just repot and it will bring your hp back down to 1 again, you have to do it once every 5 minutes. You can either pray or run away slightly to reduce damage while it works then turn off ur prayer or come back to where u were once its buffed.
---
Lennie ;_;
---
In most circumstances, I agree.
---
But, having being put in this position myself, it's almost impossible to not retaliate at some point. Whether it be out of anger or sadness.
---
My issue with this is, if Jagex were to punish these players, they wouldn't have the opportunity to try and "Troll" others online.
---
Bullying is not okay.
---
If you enjoyed it then no 
---
Nope, not at all. 
---
Love the tele 
---
Why did they add that when we have right click + select drop???
---
&gt;This is not the place to accuse players of wrongdoing. Report abuse in game and contact Jagex for serious issues. Feel like sharing? Please censor names wherever possible.
---
You sure do like to break the rules OP.
---
Do you even know what brigading is? Lol
---
Clip Chimp
---
Oldschool Runescape is different from 2007 runescape and trying to keep a grasp on that time will only hinder OSRS' growth for the future.  Warding is a part of the game evolving and increasing its lifespan.
---
hows balancing the stats out? getting 50 overall then 60s then 70s then quest cape. Its what im doing im at the 70's overall and its made the questing grind a lot more enjoyable. Before you say anything yes RC is still the most difficult grind for me
---
I'll finish my master clue when i get that damn d chain.
---
Its a dick move, nothing to do with choosing ironman.
---
You have over 158k karma.
---
Nice karma.
---
Public -&gt; Off 
---
Group hug
---
Youre an idiot
---
If bots were all gone that'd be *ONE* way to **compensate** for the massive reduction in resources entering the game.
---
People don't like skilling resources on drop tables because they further decrease the value of already low-value items and because they further devalue obtaining resources from skilling.
---
Why'd you only comment on the drop table suggestion btw and not the alternative methods? Because I specifically mentioned alternative *skilling* methods to counter exactly your kind of comment lol
---
Settled was about that dry too.
---
Keep attack and strength within 5 levels of each other. Do defense last unless you want to use less absorbs/make it more AFK. Defender is obviously more exp, but more effort. DFS makes your trip last longer and helps you get closer to the 6 hour limit. 
---
Either way it’s going to make the game less old school. I’d rather the current skills stay they way they are and have a new skill
---
Kalphites, Fire giants, black demons and Hellhounds are all bad gp and/or terrible without a cannon so that would be a start.
---
Lmfao people are braindead
---
I know, it would be barbaric
---
Possibly, but I don't want this to be an open and shut case. I would like the devs to keep this issue in mind for future pvp reworks/QoL polls as well as future Q&amp;A streams and events. You hear people call the pvp community "toxic" a lot, and I understand why. I'd like for them to bring this up again in a future stream just so I can hear their current opinion on the situation. If a vod discussing this was recently uploaded please share, I haven't been as active on twitch as before.
---
Or you could get a good job and buy bonds
---
I wish there was a “last online” feature :/ it’d be bittersweet, and I’d be able to have some closure too
---
you don't get hacked from rwting tardo
---
I have around 430 kc and I've got two dragonbone necklaces as well. Fucking hate it.
---
But you have time complaining here about it on reddit.
---
An astute observation 
---
I feel so sorry for you... good resources though ey!
---
Use ahrims, torso, blessed dhide. U dont need those. 
---
So either you go through a long period of unrewarded grinding or you turn real money into pixel money. Yeah great advise lmao
---
I agree. That would be a useful feature. I can get why someone would have trouble getting closure from something like this, especially if there was never a goodbye. I sometimes wonder about some of the people I met and how they’re doing now.
---
I am waiting for plants to grow so I can get 80 farming then boost
---
wow i'm the dipshit
---
Search up the underground pass quest, it has some requirements but without 75 magic it’s 100% worth it for lower magic levels 
---
Use the spade, Chance. Peya
---
What are youre stats ?
---
Also hydra gloves + torso &amp; serp is basicly the same max hit as bandos with bgloves + neitz. 
---
The things thats helping the agility grind is that stat tracker on rs set a goal and watch the % go up its odly satisfying when you hit mile stones like 10% 20% 25% and so on
---
You did 99 fm at wintertodl but don't want a new skill because it will make the game less old school?
---
Damn these duck responses be gettin this foo KARMA. It’s like beaver fact guy but half avian half aquatic. I support whole duckedly.
---
Both
---
TLDR: Duck's please Jagex.
---
You tap where it says "Roll Dice!"
---
Gonna cry, Iron dipshit? Piss your pants maybe? Maybe shit and cum?
---
Should allow the dharok's greataxe to chop down a tree patch in one chop but not award logs instead tbh. Would be handy for collecting yew/magic roots.
---
But no rag is worse than Rag and Bone Man II
---
When you gotta, you gotta.
---
Do people just leave that shit lying around
---
i believe people do this to show that its not shopped
---
Will probably get down-voted for this, but the support is actually quite good for these types of problems, since the solution is very obvious.
---
Although, that's not to down-play how poor it can be for other issues.
---
People who dont pvp talking about ragging in pvp: "hes not specificallyharassing you by attacking you on with 1 item every time you ever a pvp zone, hes just using the content as it is intended."
---
People who dont pvp reacting to me doing my bird task on ape atoll next to the teak trees: "ENJOY BAN IM AM AN IRONMAN AND I WILL SCREENSHOT THIS AND POST THIS ON REDDIT THIS IS HARASSMENT!"
---
has woox made a plug-in similar to the one at demonic gorillas yet ?
---
He’s practicing his clicks for infernal cape bro. 
---
This kind of shit it why I can't risk investing more time in your game.
---
That's the problem. It didn't respond. 
---
In the lumbridge kitchen sink, right?
---
They banned gambling a while ago...
---
Surely you'd want a ring of suffering there not a b ring...
---
Thx got steel pickaxe
---
200 death runes
---
Any luck yet? 
---
Edgy name, check. Skull as his flair, check. Crying semen, check. Guys we found the PKer!
---
Keep the switches in the first inventory spaces?
---
more like buttgrope amirite fellas
---
I hear what youre saying but if they added a rune crafting method which was 1xp to 13mil xp, I would take my chances.
---
Wow that's a fat F in the chat 
---
Their customer support is complete garbage, don't kid yourself. It truly does seem like you have to play the social media lottery to get any sort of meaningful support. 
---
STONE VOODOO SLOW

What setting is it?

No. Yours faithfully, the green crew.

I would love to have a non game-breaking form of Summoning.
---
The skill was cool and interesting AF, but it was OP and pretty much mandatory for anything...
---
He literally said he wants a new skill and wants old skills to stay the same. He also said think harder which you obviously ignored
---
they should try dummies, or go to a house party and fight in the ring.
---
brb. Taking a massive, multi-course shit.
---
You mean like the one we already have?
---
I would love either Tangleroot, Callisto or even Rift Guardian
---
You win some, you lose some.
---
Equipping d claws and void, randomly unloading your specs on someone in the hope that they die, and teleporting out in case they don't.
---
Eh who pissed in your cornflakes? I'm on my phone you fucking pissy lil girl. 
---
Darn, guess its back to 2T swordfish then
---
My previous name was 'Zenbeno' which has no bad intent, and I was able to just choose the same name again.
---
Damn I'd quit if I were you lol
---
This bot has Fortnite.
---
Ah yea, getting 99 in a gold sink skill is bad money management, just like getting 99 FM means you're bad at handling wood.
---
Going for barrows gloves is a great way to train your account, will get your skills up and give you plenty of skilling goals. It's a very long quest if you're new but you complete it in stages so you don't need all the stats / quests right away, you can sort of do it as you get them.
---
As for barrows it's doable in full rune with ibans blast (50 Mage and I'd recommend 60 ability for the quest - Underground Pass) get 55 slayer and use broad bolts with a rune crossbow for ahrims.  You'll need at least 43 prayer but higher is better so you don't have to stop at 43.  Once you get some money you can buy a trident at 75 magic and a blowpipe at 75 range that will make it much easier
---
If you're charging your bone crusher and using it regularly the daily saves time, otherwise just do wild altar 1 inventory at a time 
---
It's really not hard to imagine why you're getting targeted for harassment you're so obnoxious...
---
No one gives a shit what you are on, and after you figure out where the screen shot button is, you should start working on some better insults, you fucking retard.
---
How is this controversial...? Majority here most likely agree that botters are bad.
---
Quality of life is generally good here. That's not to say there aren't still some glaring flaws. We can still do better.
---
Its almost as if they're the sane colour as the in-game skill capes
---
It’s a typo. He meant came and that’s the hours he has been alive for.
---
At least I can take a joke unlike your virgin ass 
---
who?
---
At college they gave a class bout multitasking, saying that it will always be worse than focussing on every task 1 by 1. Also said something bout it not being a skill you can enhance. 
---
But that’s for professional jobs, i’ll make em lvl account per account while i multi log 6 accounts on 3 monitors at sand crabs &gt;:( actually that’s not multi tasking :&gt; you set up 1 per one. One by one requiring your focus.
---
OP safe spots a king with magic only instead of doing all 3 kings. 
---
He just right clicks and drops inventories on barb fishing
---
Just right click on wyverns.
---
All at different times which doesn’t overlap, the fisher has least priority, the melee has 1st and the safespot 2nd. 
---
Multi tasking is impossible, we’re incapable of it. (Or are we? Piano players are multi tasking with both hands, i can’t do that, but can i learn that or am i a pleb at piano for life?) 
---
Anyways, i’m sure nobody rly multi tasks a game like osrs, would burn too much energy and you’d need to sleep a ton.
---
Always wanted my first 99 to be firemaking because my account had "fire" in the name. I changed my account name when I joined OSRS and stopped caring, so I got 99 fletching. Did it for the 13m you could make at the time, just for some startup cash.
---
That'd just make another point of entry for hijackers. With the rest of the current implementation it would make users security weaker.
---
People come in social media so much because they've sold their account or shared it so much jagex can't figure out who the owner is. Almost every time there's a recovery / "a hijacker botted on my account" there's a jmod reply that calls bullshit. The problem is then exacerbated by people like yourself who just assume the system is crap and spin a worse picture with assumptions.
---
F
---
Judging from the other replies to this comment were now into the stage where the counter circlejerk becomes more annoying and widespread then the one its mocking. 
---
lmao
---
Past 83 construction there isn't much relevant content, same with past 90 herblore, 77 prayer, but I am wrong about 99 crafting
---
Weath is actually the biggest fucking clown I have ever meet thinks he’s a bot busting expert and rwt banner. Nothing more then a little skid 
---
&gt;This has already failed a poll.
---
Ofc it has PvMers and Skillers to do not want marginally higher chance of being killed when running around the wildy. This poll should not have been polled as it just allows selfish voting. Yes people want protect from magic to work from magic: firstly entangle only does pitiful amounts of damage (like max hit of a 5 IIRC) so that doesn’t matter, second having only 7.5 seconds to attack your opponent before you have to entangle again makes it extremely difficult to ever PK and just makes the meta to bring a friend to TB on the standard while someone else is on ancients. Also, standard spellbook PKing is already weak as you bring 3 spells (TB, entangle, flames of zamorak/ fire surge) meaning that you have 7/8 slots worth of rune (depending on if you bring an elemental staff) and 5/6 with a rune pouch. This already puts the PKer at a significant disadvantage as they have way less food compared to what they would have with ancients. With ancients you only need 3(no water staff) / 2 (with water staff) /1 ( Rune pouch) inventory slots. That is why standard spellbook needs that needed buff to entangle.
---
The rune pouch should stay wildy content because with it being moved it removes significant wilderness activity Whether this be through BH or Wilderness slayer. Furthermore, you wouldn’t put BCP in Zulrah so why change it from wildy to slayer? Not hard to avoid being PKed especially with the significant amount of worlds being put in.
---
botting is fine but some harmless plugins are bad
---
That's not ragging
---

---
these look like shit
---
I see it as “you’re in the wildy so we kill you because naked people have good loot sometimes when doing clues”
---
Vs.
---
“I’m gonna rag you because you chose to be in a PvP world where anyone can attack you with whatever you want because you never know maybe I’d be able to kick you to death!”
---
it's a juke ring.
---
A scam is underhanded tactics to deceive people out of items or money.
---
A juke, is a prank.
---
&gt; However, would you not agree that the services bit most-likely encompasses only legitimate services? Since ragging is not allowed, a "ragging service" officially can not exist.
---
No, that's literally you trying to redefine the definition, just like the other guy said.
---
If you don’t find the wildy fun fine I am not gonna force you to go there. You can very easily stick with the Rune Pickaxe. But don’t just demand it be put somewhere you don’t have to risk anything like a new skilling boss.
---
not if theyre better than mystic with a way more rare droprate
---
i meant the engine in the back. it is an legendary engine for sure
---
No one could maintain that.

Nice joke
---
hell no

R/slaycringe
---
so basically what they do is find an item that is rarely traded on ge. they then buy out all the available stock on the grand exchange.
---
Buyer places a bunch on grand exchange for an absolutely absurd price, and the seller then puts in a buy offer to match that price. when my friend caught this trade happening, teak armchairs were insta selling for 200m a piece, and it quickly plummeted down to the price you see in my image. Its a way that gold sellers are able to sell multiple billions of gold at a time, and get away with it. 
---
wtf is their "support system"
---
that bullshit where if you have an issue they just redirect you to some site?
---
How do you open a ticket if you have an issue? I'm pretty sure LITERALLY the only way to get an issue solved thats not "billing" related is to get a frontpage post on reddit.
---
Or maybe I'm missing something. You seem to be well experienced, lets take for example that ironman that lost his zammy hasta due to the reroll. How does he contact support to resolve that?
---
think the guy that bought an ags for 1m got you beat
---
Stop using the fake wiki then. 
---
Use the proper wiki
---
is this waxi? lol
---
Do you guys know about pork and beans
---
Just double checking something here for anyone else who farms limpwurts during their farm runs
---
Now that ultracompost prices have plummeted due to the volcanic ash update, I figure it's more efficient to use ultracompost on limpwurts now. Compost doesn't affect yield on flower patches but it should increase survival rate by about 5% compared to supercompost (I couldn't find anything confirming this for flower patches but those are the rates for other patches). With limpwurts costing 900 each then if you average 3.5 or more limpwurts per patch, you should definitely make more profit by using ultracompost now
---
That's where you're wrong
---
Neither. Its the old wiki thats no longer in use. 
---
But you're not talking about ragging. Ragging is when someone constantly attacks 1 player over and over again, not just a random guy once.
---
stop
---
using
---
the 
---
wrong
---
wiki
---
Yeah I use em both, but it's too much troubles lately so I'll better stick with the wiki indeed 😉👍🏻
---
Haha purple man
---
16hr a day is not even that much. 
---
That's ridiculous. You call spending all your waking hours every single day 'not that much'?
---
don’t be a smartass. It’s about comboing right and switching gear.
---
Also - the other drops still feel great. 
---
Got some magic logs? Great! They convert into much more than just GP you would otherwise just sell at the GE.
---
I'm currently doing the barrows grind on my BTW and simple things like blood runes feel awesome to get. 
---
I mean I’m just saying that when someone rags you in PvP it’s mainly because they’re mad from something that either happened to them while they were Pking or in the wildy. 
---
Not saying it’s okay to just constantly attack PKers especially when they’re on a PvP world and I agree the bot raggers should be stopped. 
---
Just needed it for hard diary. Kill vorkath on the daily
---
Try and read the warning next time when jumping over the wildy ditch. 
---
Yes. 
---
I know, but asking I am asking Thurmod
---
Fucking hell
---
so as long as i pick up but even if i didnt shoot any i can still get max points?
---
Most players to my knowledge kill all 6 brothers and then 3 skeletons to hit around 88.8%
---
I wish I could unsee what I have just saw.
---
Do you know about pork and beans
---
&gt;Anecdotal evidence includes direct quotes now?
---
Yes, it does.  Don't get mad at me just because you didn't read the article I linked.
---
&gt;evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony
---
Argue if you want, but I'd say that copying reddit comments is pretty casual and is definitely personal testimony.
---
&gt;&gt;attack you
---
&gt;I've done nothing of the sort.
---
&gt; You're pathetic.
---
&gt;Were you not here for the "streamer favoritism" bitchfest
---
&gt;I'd assume you were a troll except there's actually people that think like you do which is kind of sad
---
Try again bud.
---
I've consistently provided arguments you chose to ignore and instead attack my character, and then turn around to claim I haven't provided anything and you've been an upstanding citizen throughout the entire interaction.  I'm tired as fuck and you're clearly not interested in anything related to the actual point of the thread, so I'm done now.  You may (and probably will) continue to disparage me but that's fine.  Have a good day and hopefully going forward you find someone less "pathetic troll" to argue with. :)
---
I mean in case of runescape it of course is stupid as there's no profit to be made, but calling it impossible to maintain is straight out false. I know poker players who are doing 16hrs per day with the correct sleep cycle if they need to rebuild their bankroll. 
---
Its your weekly reminder to learn how to draw eyes.

Why metal dragons?
---
How did you type the comment if you're dead? That makes no sense.
---
Imagine if you had to get a item as a rare drop to unlock customer support but all of us have really bad RNG. 
---
I cross posted this from idiots in cars I didn't see it was originally from calimariraceteam, that sub is full of fuckheads who think it's cool to ride like a cunt on public streets.
---
Main rule is I cant say any personal or embarrassing chats unless its WC'd into public.
---
So far I'm still just as ashamed as anyone else who does it.
---
I'm sorry, but someone not willing to take micro-naps between game-ticks is a casual worthy of our ridicule! There's no debating that point. It's an xp waste to NMZ for 20 minutes to play the real life adventure game, period.
---
Personally I've not wasted a single tick in over 3 years, my Doritos and Dew are delivered to me and I use weekly game updates to empty the jugs/buckets.
---
gz best item to get on iron imo
---
Calm down there buttercup 
---
tekton
---
Yea, I used to use supercompost but now I'm using ultracompost for it also, you can just get a bottomless compost bucket if you do a lot of farming cause 1 ultracompost = 2 when you add into the bottomless compost bucket
---
Yeah, thats what I though of doing too! :) 
---
Someone on twitter suggested we should be able to have 10 rings because of 10 fingers and I tried finding the picture someone already made of a gold ring in the leg slot but I couldn’t.
---
So I made my own and now I’m a karma farmer

Because the task will take you 472828 hours with those stats
---
I’ll believe it when I see it... support really does suck dick on this game unfortunately 
---
I did 24 chests last night... Got 2 dharok plate legs, and karils coif.. 
---
Fair enough then
---
PSA some dipshit is still using an outdated, no longer updated, constantly vandalised wiki instead of the proper one. 
---
Barbarian pking would be neat though
---
Gotta censor the shark count 
---
Stop using the fandom wiki.  Use the new wiki on the subreddit and osrs homepage sidebar.
---
Early game is when all the best money is made. You can go the safe route and do agility pyramid. Other than that rushing slayer, or herb, will be the next , and pking is always the best
---
Rigor and Aug might be worth looking into too. 
---
Why would they get rid of that??? 
---

---
Yeah sorry man. This is completely inaccurate and very silly to even suggest. 
---
Their customer support can do nothing more than fix ultra basic issues that a google search could probably answer. Any issues with your account are almost unfixable unless you win the Reddit or twitter lottery. 
---
And saying it’s on par with other gaming companies is almost laughable. Have you ever contacted blizzard customer support before?

No one in this post ever ridiculed him. I was trying to show that the game is obviously growing, and evolving with new players. You never used to see players like this. The guy was obviously lost, and didn’t understand all the components to the game. I talked to the kid and explained mechanics behind dragons, and that he may want an anti fire shield. Don’t be so quick to jump to conclusions.
---
for me it was just surpassing my kid self.  i was around 104 combat in 06 with 1400 totals, so its nice to finally be past my childhood account
---
Wouldn't accept it anyway, I prefer grinding my stuff

If it was cheating it wouldn’t be a functioning part of the game. If you don’t like it don’t do it again but I wouldn’t call it cheating. I personally think bonds are good for membership but buying them strictly for GP is a little...distasteful? I would say lol. 
---
Do whatever you want man, if you wanna buy bonds go ahead. In the grand scheme of it, a bond is about 3m, there are quite a few end game money makers where you can make that or more in less then an hour, one bond isn’t going to corrupt you or something.

Haha I downvoted you. You sent from 83,102 to 83,101.

You can do wildy altar at any time of the day if you have half a brain.  I did 74-77 at peak time and lost maybe 20 bones
---
I disagree. Terms used are taken from one game and applied to other frequently. The true definition isn’t always the same but I thought the first comment was pretty pedantic so I did the same
---
He was spotted at rune drags a while back
---
His last message was “thanks for the support, signing off now!”
---
He probably feels accomplished enough to take a break. He did say he isn’t going to do it again on an ironman. I feel like he should come back and hunt for every pet and actually complete the game but aye it’s his life lol
---
Pretty sure getting attacked in wilderness and getting griefed by a bot are two very different things
---
Almost as if other countries don’t exist. That have these weird things called holidays :o. IMPOSSIBLE!
---
If it makes you enjoy the game, then it's okay. Bruh, I see level 80s with full bandos all the time. 😂😂😂 I mean, you do you. 
---
my current goal is barrows gloves, piety and lunars
---
what do i need to work on most?
---
Thats what theyre designed for. Taking it out of the hands of gold farmers to a degree at least.
---
Ive never done it but no point throwing it away. Invest in some skilling supplies like planks or something. Youll be throwing gp down the drain later with herblore, construction and prayer anyway.

The most effective method of accumulating karma, 52% of all posts are reposts. Reddit in latin is Reddo, meaning return, restore or to give back, which could be conjugated as reddit, meaning it returns or redditor meaning one of returns.

You can see on the screenshot that he leveled up to 3 after getting the pet, completely wasted oppurtunity

Ok, ill give it a look. Thanks!

Your iPad is not compatible it has nothing to do with software, it’ll be a hardware limitation preventing it most likely. Source: I used to work for Apple.

Basically if it says in incompatible that’s is what it is and only Jagex can change that.

That was beautiful. One calculator is hard, but two??? Amazing.

Dude... Just don't play the game? If it's that much of an issue for you, then just quit playing. Shit. Happens. Its. A. Game.

Hmm, I'm 27 and have played fortnite on a few occasions. The game is a blast to play but I can't fucking stand squeakers raging and yelling obscenities because I managed to land a headshot, it ain't just forknife, I avoid pretty much every online shooters cause of that shit. When I come home from work I want to relax not getting yelled at by prepubescent teens who can't fucking manage their emotions. Viva la single player fuckers.

Impressive

What is spec tabbing?
---
You are raising a good point, one which they also state that they encountered. I can't really think of of a way to counter that other than if they can now (or should be able to) trace where the last few successful login attempts came from, if one account always over several years have logged in from New York, and a few hours later from Venezuela and then New York again, it should suffice as evidence that a third party was involved. However I also think this would be a problem with VPNs.

It counts the members skills in total level but not when entering the world. It means you need to take away whatever levels you have in members skills even if it’s just level 1.
---
You're not wrong. But that is a misleading oversimplification of the situation. You're being ragged because you're spec tabbing. So your real complaint should be towards spec tabbing. 
---
I'd definitely take dude up on this offer. I mean, why not? Dude obviously had some kind of weird submission fetish someone might as well benefit from it.

That seems really easy and I could even use the budget setup when learning?

Autoclickers have only recently (read: ardy knights pre-nerf) started making a comeback. Almost nobody used autoclickers when this update was released, and has only recently gained more popularity.

No shit. RC is slow but you can't even talk about it without 80 replies full of "DAE RUNCRAEFT SLOW???" cancer.

Maybe it was funny once but you've killed it.

Nah fuck that it's xp waste

Sounds good tbh

I'd at least like to see that interface reworked. It may be possible to get all the options to list on a single interface instead of a scroll bar in the middle. Perhaps it could also get shortcut keys (i.e. 1-z) to select the type and then the item. Make X on top of that may be a bit strong, but I still wouldn't say it is unreasonable given the flatpack delays. But even without Make X, Flatpacking could use some improvements; it shouldn't be slower than build and replace Con and clunkier to use...
---
These stupid bandaid fixes get coded around in like a week by the premium bots. People using simple autoclickers are likely to be caught anyways.
---
Shit like that inconveniences normal players at such a larger scale than bots that it's almost not worth comparing. That's why they got rid of actual punishing random events as well.
---
Killing players for profit is always going to inconvenience the person who dies. Attacking and harrassing others without the intention of profiting/killing them but instead just trying to deter them (especially when using bots) should be criticized.

Not punch, wrestle them and suplex the damn tree

It's not high risk, there's no risk at all, just high reward.
---
They would have to collect the bones yes but the wildy altar is the fastest exp in the game for prayer, and they can bring noted bones.
---
There is no risk, and that does not make it fair. Everyone has to grind to obtain wealth/items regardless of whether or not theyre an ironman.

Funny I'm doing my first fire cape run and this is my reaction when I have to agro the healers.

Its called dry humor lol anyways its just an exaggeration thing. Forgot that someone might take it as a literal comment. Wups
---
As a matter of fact I am being targetted by most of these raggers due to the fact that I am friends with players that they don't like. If those players they dislike aren't online, they will take it out on others. First just once, or twice. After that it'll become routine to rag those other players consistently too.  
---
Now I'm not 100% sure that this is the case for all raggers, however I do know that a majority do so because of the clan chat I am in.

Oh ya bud, that first post really looked like you were “defending” pk’ing. This is the entertainment I love reddit for :)

What? No, duh, by far not. I'm not as retarded as all of you. At all.
---
I never got any of my skills to 99, I always just played for fun, never too much and mainly out of nostalgia.
---
I needed close to no time that this retarded system is grindy as fuck for no reason at all.
---
What do you have achieved when you waste so extremely much time to max your skill levels? Nothing.
---
I loved the game back then, and it had always been fun, but. It. Is. Dead.
---
I have a life. And if I still play the game then I go to barrows or do slayer tasks, or just stride around and play for fun. I certainly don't sit around at the GE making fires or creating arrows all day and just clicking around brainlessly, wasting my lifetime.
---
It's harsh to put it this way for people who actually max their skills, but it is the truth. There is no logical point in doing so. It's an option, but a bad one.
---
So you scrolled through the top posts of all time in the sub and then just reposted one of them? Good one.

Turn on bot client when your mom calls you upstairs

Tyrannical(i) would be better anywhere you're trying to land dwh specs and warrior(i)'s better when trying to land arclight specs. If you're doing non-stat-drained corp, treasonous(i) should be better (same with an ardy cloak 4 over a fire/infernal cape).

Lmao. Yesterday some of 30 crashed me and I said he's lucky I didn't kill him. He gets super pissy and tells me to suck his dick and shit. 
---
He then asks if I wanna fight his main in a 5m risk fight who's about the same lv as me and I say sure so they dude logs, logs on his main, gears up, and heads over to duel arena.
---
I keep saying stuff like "gearing up", "forgot pots" and so on while talking trash and making him more and more mad.
---
He finally comes back to sand crabs mad as fuck and calls me an idiot. I had to go shortly after anyways so it worked but the man was so fucking mad.

86 technically (2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm) to not have a chance at bolt racks. If you don't get a bloodworm, 3 skeletons will give you 88 which is also fine, but you may get bolt racks.

Yeah, but for some reason they are way less offensive than most. Now a mtx to recolor your armor, that'd be some shit.

I mean.... Doing underground pass unlocks several things. And it's not THAT hard. It's just annoying with lower agility. But a Trident is way better than I and blast. So... Yes?

Absolutely love it lol

I mean you make a good point but you're no better than the raggers and you're being extremely disingenuous in this thread.

**AUS** means **A**dditional **U**.S. **S**erver amirite

Virtual runecrafting boosts(only work for the purpose of getting multiple runes/using the ourania altar) would be a much less controversial addition, but even that would allow for the boosting of diary reqs. Unless they only worked with specific altars, and none of the covered altars were involved with diaries.

What’s the difference between ragging and spec tabbing?

Them why does no other company have one? It’s an unnecessary nuisance

Mine freezes sometimes, so i have to turn it off(keep the client open) then open a new one with the GPU off, Log in, then enable GPU on the 2nd client to make it work again. happens maybe once a week and takes 2 seconds to fix, i feel like its everytime i restart my computer

In his post history he shows he's maxed melee and 160 qp, he needs to get a questing bot smh.

Pretty impressive, but not nearly as much as it used to be before Zeah. Bloods and Souls really devalued the skill.

better than skilling so

They don't have to spend to their means, though. They have the ability to live a modest life without ever working again. So, that's the commenter's point.

Don't they put on an entire PvP game mode multiple times a year with a variety of rulesets?

Reading the responses to this has been interesting. I'm assuming the people saying "this guy pretended like he got lured to cover up RWT" or something are all lurers who know its real, the same lurers that keep asking me to take down the video, and are only saying that to try to convince other people this is fake so they will disregard it and their lure method won't spread. I would hope no one is actually that stupid- after all if someone was really RWTING the 12b, why the fuck would they record it and post it to youtube in the first place?
---
No, this is a real lure, from a common lure method, and this is just one of the bigger loots is all.

I'm not against mtx. From what I've understood very few people are truly against the idea of mtx, usually they're just so fucking bad when implemented that no1 wants to take the chance and find out if their favorite game is in the 0,01% of games doing mtx right. 
---
Honestly now that I think of it a lot of players might be against mtx as much as they are against things from rs3 because SoF already ruined their favorite game once

How do you change your layout of runelite like that

&gt; they simply dont ban them right away or something

Make a new account and bot for 5 hours or so, if that particular script is detected, you should be banned within 24 hours, they don't wait a long time.

I know they have developed "new" quests for osrs so you are getting more then what was around in 2007 but why don't they re-add some thay were developed afterwards?
---
I really liked the Red Axe series that ended with "Forgiveness of a Chaos Dwarf". Finishing with being able to use the Hand Cannon. If the wiki is right, the last quest for thay ended in 2009, I can't see the harm in them adding that and a few other quests that were developed. 
---
Fuck off retard
---
I would say I hope you're not actually this stupid to think its "cover to rwt", but I know you're not, you're actually a lurer that isn't done with pvp lure yet, pretending to think its rwt so people will disregard and your method will live longer :P

I'm quite certain they changed it to that not too long ago. Timer shouldn't keep going f you're offline

That ragging is isn't far more detrimental to pking than rushing is something that only someone would say who hasn't been ragged (for whatever reason!). I've mentioned this in a couple replies, but I am not solely being ragged for what I do or have done.  
---
Raggers tend to do what they do to force you to pay them off or because they just hate your (or friends') guts. It's not as simple as saying "you're being punished for what you do."  
---
If rushing is considered to be as bad as ragging, shouldn't it also be against the game rules? Regardless, that's not the point I'm trying to make.  
---
Rag(bots) have no place in this game.  
---
Whether or not rushing should be allowed or punished isn't what I'm trying to debate, but I understand why people many of their commenters with their whataboutism.  
---
And then it's down the same rabbit hole of boosters and powerline adapters.  
---
Going to the extent of moving the location of a router means you may as well just keep the drill out and network the house.

I got mine at 74m exp, good luck matey

started as an inside joke with the fam, then I did a 24h trout cooking stream, then I put up a sub goal, reached it, and got the tatt as promised
---
Sir, step away from the rabbit and nobody gets hurt.
---
Look into it, definitely worth
---
They are both bad for sure.  But it's not like this guy programmed his bot to go around attacking anyone, he programmed it to rag a specific person.  Maybe that specific person shouldn't be a total dick and he wouldn't feel the wrath of a true autist coming down on him.
---
Kappa
---
Don’t think people hate pking, just pkers lol
---
You mean wanabee botters were reeing?
---
That could work, boost for the alter you want.. e.g put crushed water runes in for multiples when crafting them.. same for the other altars? 
---
Yeah, millionaire also isn't as strong as it was in the last. Nowadays you need to be planning to be a multi millionaire if you're getting out of college. 
---
Inflation in 40 years will be a bitch
---
85 actually, you can boost with summer pies and go to ardy
---
Haha yea, at this time i meet more than half of the requirements statwise so i'll have to grind the rest of 'm out before the quest goes live!
---
You’re not even near close. If I had 2 million invested at 6% I could live off 120K interest a year. 
---
which is fine and all but they aren't 1 iteming.  they run around, sometimes with absolutely nothing, with the sole purpose to keep the person in question preoccupied.  they believe they can shut someone out of a world if they will it.

Also, telling a funny story == bitching for you? Gosh your life must be depressing. :(
---
range is more dps than melee at bandos. get that up.
---
if you wanted to melee i'd say you would need base 80 or 85s minimum.
---
tbf you can't tele immediately after unloading a spec anymore, so someone with a range combo can probably go do something about that.  
---
Halloween event from a couple of years ago iirc, you can get it next Halloween!

How the fuck do you do all this and watch shows at the same time 😂😂
---
So if you take a months break from rs you have to read all the new updates before you can start playing?
---
Ok, so you spec tab constantly at the house portal, and it looks like this bot was designed to keep you away from the portal. Not that I condone either of you, but pretty ingenious 
---
he thinks that, despite knowing ragging is bad, some circumstances make it justifiable.  i believe the proper term is "Hypocrite"  
---
? 
---
Well yeah, how you think YOU came about?
---
Only takes a few hours to set up and like 20 hours to pay off the first bond
---
Just because the MAJORITY think something shouldn’t happen it doesn’t make it right. Look at 6 hour NMZ and splashing but went in without a poll due to integrity. The only ‘defence’ to magic is not just protect from magic you can very easily bring more mage def armour like D’hide. Or even fight back. Making entangle a 15 sec freeze whether protect from magic is active is not OP as explained is my first response (simply you already have less invent space and have more spells to go between and deals little damage). Also ice barrage freezes opponents for 20 seconds regardless of protect from magic.
---
&gt; Is chasing people down in no gear not good enough for you?
---
Don’t know where that came from - probably a dumb stereotype when you PKed once when doing a clue.
---
Rune pouch is not only unlocked through BH PvP it can very easily be obtained through wilderness slayer so it allows both PvPers and PvMers to get it.
---
Without updates which make PKing more fun and diverse it will die. That is why Jagex really need to employ someone who knows what is going on. PKers are the ones that actually resurrected Old School in the first place.

Tbh, the part of mtx I'm against is how everything can so easily become a panda outfit or a beach outfit. Imo disguising armor and weapons as flashy outfits isn't how it should be. And obviously the fact that being able to buy keys that instakill bosses and shit is a bit overkill. 
---
To be honest, you can still find fullfilment in productive things. Of course it's not easy to fully abandon the counterproductive activities (I too struggle with that obviously).

Wow that hit awfully close to home :(

No. If you want a entirely one dimensional experience there are 10000 mobile games out there for you that will hold your hand. I think literally everyone who makes it through underground pass has at least partially figured out 'gee there might be more to this shtick or I just wasted the last hour of my life in that cave'.

Ammonite crabs. Really good xp per hour and can AFK until they become aggressive, which is around 10 mins or so I think.

For me it freezes on certain MSAA settings. Currently it only works on 4x I think? Try changing them and see if it fixes

Haven’t gotten to bloods. I’m hoping that’s the case. At 71. Up to this point, I will never complain about thieving or agility every again. I despise this skill

---
Do you think balancing the exp bonus would be enough to counteract this? Or just less punishing locations to end up at?
---
[Yes, that's what I keep telling myself... :(](https://i.imgur.com/jwTAEe0.png)
---
Bonds do a lot of really good things people don't understand. 
---
* Bonds tie real world currency to in game currency, creating a price floor, combating in game inflation. 
---
* Although people grind more to get bonds, causing more gold to come into the game. Bonds simultaneously act as a gold sink when you pay 10% of its value to activate it. These two actions cancel each other out. 
---
* It undercuts the market for RWT and gold farmers, which are arguably the biggest cause for inflation. 
---
this is definitely not the case. no one would want to buy a teak chair, lets be honest
---
This doesn't actually hurt anyone right? The buyer sells the item and gets their gold and the seller gets to keep theirs. The seller gets free money lol. 
---
You can also survive witout those extra 5% if you don't want to do content to get it
---
What do you think would be a value of risk people would be willing to take?
---
Irrelevant, not hardcore

I went to get a slayer task from Nieve and this random lvl 90 goes "wtf 124 combat and 75 slayer??" Ffs dont judge i like afking
---
In OSRS, my first was Farming. There was about a 4 month time frame where I could play maybe an hour a day but in increments, so I did fruit trees, herbs, and eventually hops throughout the day to 99.
---
In RS2, I just thought the Ranged cape looked cool, so it was my first.

If you work a 40 hour job, sleep 56 hours a week, that leaves you with 72 hours in a week to handle all your other responsibilities + social life + free time
---
If 40 of those 72 hours are spent on Runescape... it's a bit of a problem

Congrats! That's my goal atm aswell. Up to 210 qps, haven't done any grandmaster or masters yet though.

Why? Still have 32 hours left.

Pking shovels takes more skill than it looks.

Imagine having to ask someone to stop stealing from you. This is what DMCA's are for.

RS3 gold is worth about 1/5th OSRS gold.
---
So to clarify (since /u/Shitpost5000 apparently knows nothing about what I do yet feels the need to shitpost):  
---
&gt; OP sits in a safezone
---
- the POH area that is seen in the clip is not a safezone, so rushers at that area are not in a safezone.  
---
&gt; waits till someone it looting
---
- players that rush in that area rarely target people looting, there is little to no point 
---
&gt; runs up and specs  
---
- true
---
&gt; he instantly teleports away for no risk
---
- instantly teleporting away is not as easy as it used to be due to the most recent pvp update, so there is always time to antirush. there is risk involved contrary to /u/Shitpost5000's assumption  
---
All in all - is rushing scummy? Sure.  
---
Does that mean that people should go out of their way to break game rules and harass you a better part of the day? Debateable.
---
Note that - as I have mentioned in multiple other comments - In *my* situation I am mainly being ragged because I am friends with players who these raggers dislike, so they target me when their "original target" isn't around.
---
I have only ever been hacked using osbuddy.
---
I never shared my data with anyone since i dont make Friends online and the irl people i know dont play.
---
So, you have your answer right there.
---
Especially when a theoretical die determines how well you’re going to do lmfao
---
Obviously you got greedy and staked his bank
---
Mobile and an ability to multi-task gives a lot to work with too.
---
Salt like this is fuel for pkers lmao
---
Why would it be so unbelievable anyway? You can see he has a quest cape in the pic so he had to do quite a bit of slayer for that.
---
Wait what lol 
---
No, quest cape was the first cape I got in the game with hp being second. My hp one is still untrimmed.
---
Not using 2fa on email. 
---
You guys probably clicked on GPgenerator.exe and it gave your friend’s computer a RAT.
---
I question the effectiveness of bonds as a sink.
---
You only need to pay 10% to activate a bond if you buy one with gold (or are otherwise given one without paying cash), and then choose to sell/trade it away again. 
---
If I buy a bond for personal use, I don't need to pay the 10%.
---
Vasa. But if this is a thread asking whether you should scout that boss out or do it, then always fucking do it. It can be a bit rough on learners initially but trust me, it's so fucking worth it dude. And if you cba to bring a crush weapon, just put the lance on crush. That works just fine from my experience. Maybe, I over thought this thread. Maybe I didn't. But in the event that you wanted some advice, I hope I helped. :)

---
It's the wilderness mate. There's a ditch with a warning to keep you out if you do not wish to die. PvMers shouldn't be so salty about getting Pked. It's part of the game. 
---
I thought this was normal? I always have 2-3 accounts going with netflix/YouTube on another monitor. 
---
It isn’t PKers fault that they are using PvP space in the way it is meant to be used. The only reason Wildy activities have high rewards is because PKers can kill you, if they stopped then they’d need to be nerfed.
---
D
---
Why is eating beans something noteworthy?
---
Exactly. In this case the guy is literally a ragger himself. Some pkers who got tired of his shit probably used the resources available to them to counter his degeneracy and give him a taste of his own medicine.
---
It would be like one of the old runecraft pkers on the 2k world when i was getting 99 runecrafting in 2015 trying to report me for ragging when i geared in a crystal bow to make them go away
---
It sounds bad when you put it like that. But for me it was great to catch up on what was happening in the twitch community every day as I don't have time to watch streams. Also a lot of the content uploaded to channels like RSMoments never get uploaded to youtube, such as stream clips of B0aty and Sicknerd dissing eachother. It definitely isn't fair for them to upload content that streamers want to upload themselves, but I do think a happy medium could be found
---

Well if I owned a company that was literally being put up for sale as we speak, I'd give no fucks on how the community feels either. It's a 2001 niche game with little to no apple to the majority of people. Also mind you it has only reacuring players only that have already made up there mind on how they will support the game via bonds and memberships and the community has Expressed countless times they will not stand for micro transactions so in all reality this game has NO APPEAL so has no chance on going to any type of decent game developing company.... so I see jagex squeezing what they can from there player base then scrapping the company.... we all love osrs but let's be honest and realistic... games not making it much farther in life
---
Or just have a GE in priff so I don’t have to see fucking gambling bots and beggars. 
---
The same way you would descredit someone for bowling with gutter guards, for example.  It is objectively more difficult to know where to run to without a visual aid, hence respect for doing it without the advantage. 
---
People being salty over people playing the game ONE of the many ways its meant to be played, imagine that!!! 
---
Also you have to be 75 combat for Konar, 43 prayer is good to have for tasks, and get a black mask then slayer helm when you can.
---
Fucking bots

Cute that you think you're on rate for the pet at 30m xp
---
Because it's either rare on the universal RDT, or it's uncommon from abyssal leeches. Problem with leeches is that you don't have access to the (pretty safe) abyssal plane by fairy ring at the time of doing the quest, so you have to go to the one in the wilderness. Teleporting there is basically russian roulette(obvious problem for HCIM), also I think the leeches do plenty of damage.
---
Locked out of content by getting targeted as soon as they enter the wilderness. How about PvP world raggers that attack Pkers as soon as they step out of the safe zone? That basically locks out the Pkers from actually finding fights. I know Pkers hate that too. Same concept applies. Players attacking other players that don’t want to fight back, thus stopping them from doing that content.

---
you can try appealing your ban by logging into your account and checking account status but I wouldn't get your hopes up.  
---
from the support faq:  
---
&gt; The account holder is responsible for the actions of the account. Offences may be applied no matter who was playing at the time. Extenuating individual circumstances will not lead to the removal of a penalty and it is your responsibility to ensure your account's security.  
---
this way people don't try and circumvent bans by saying someone else was in control of their account when it was being used to cheat on.
---
It can be fair use even if it's for profit. Enough citation is given simply by referencing the streamer from twitch. They key is if the video offers an experience that is different than what the stream would and it does. Watching a collection video namely rsmoments tends to create a narrative among clips. This narrative or even the defection of which clips to include could be argued as making the entire video protected under fair use.

That's gotta be the shittiest comparison I've ever heard. You can still lose with indicators. Gutter guards make it impossible to lose. Zuks max hit is still 250+ with the tiles marked. Jad, ranger, mager, healers spawn and still do damage. Tile indicators dont make the fight as easy as you make them out to be, lmao.

The other side of the story can look like this - someone only has an hour to play every other day or two. They need to get 80 mining for a master clue or some quest or something. Getting those mining levels would probably take months of play time a rate of an hour every couple days. I could see how someone that values their precious free time trying to cut corners.

I had the same idea myself, so I gathered the reqs for Vorkath, chinned 99 ranged, got a POH pool and started to grind. I’m at around 900KC now and got bored so decided to learn Zulrah (only had 1KC for Elite Void). Let me tell you - Zulrah is infinitely more enjoyable for a number of reasons IMO. The chance of a unique is much higher (around 1/128 for any unique) compared to Vorkath’s 1/5k and the fight itself is so much more fun. I’ve already had around 5 unique drops at about 300KC compared to literally none yet at Vorkath. I’m also sure I make more money at Zulrah but that might be because I don’t have DHCB.

OSBuddy didn't hack him and anyone who thinks so is a moron.  He was likely leaked in a database because he can't keep his information safe or use different passwords or he clicked or responded to a phish.

I used to bot back when RS2 was a thing. I botted an account to max without ever being banned. It was awesome to see those sweet milestones reached but the sense of accomplishment was gone once I had nothing to actual grind at. Botting everything gave me more than enough GP, so I didn't need to camp bosses for it. If for some reason that was the case, I would just bot it. It still amazes me today that account has yet to be banned. I don't really play it because it is a RS3 account now... LUL. After reaching maxed, I still knew very little about the game. I couldn't even kill Jad and have friends do it for me.
---
Flash forward to today, almost maxed on OSRS and have not touched a bot to do it. There are days and even weeks that I lose motivation to log on because I can't be asked to grind away at MLM to get the levels I need for the achievement diary, but when I do reach that level, it feels oh so good. I know exactly what I need to do. My game knowledge has improved drastically and I can't wait until I have the motivation to max myself instead of a bot.

Not to mention if you three or four hit an abyss runecrafter you still profit, like those rune casts are worth maybe 3-6k gp and generally you're going to make back the glory + pickaxe so roughly a 17-19k pk. You also run into that thing where you have no idea what someone is carrying. A lot of people do stupid things because usually they are safe, the most common place to pk a eternal glory amulet will of course be at abyss runners.
---
So you guarantee yourself a 19k kill that can range all the way up to 25 million gp should they be risking an eternal. Shit just use your dragon claw spec and you don't even need to spend more runes then to teleblock/freeze. There are also so many people running the Abyss that you're likely going to profit 200k+ gp an hour as long as you can kill a singular person every ten minutes.

It's not that the individual investment is bad at all, but the ping already screwed me over last time just at wave 56, and it was decently disheartening to wanting to try again just to get to Jad with a good run and then not have a flick register fast enough. 150-200 ms is still low enough to pull of the flicks for sure, but I still got room for human error to fill that 450-400 ms gap, sadly.

Actually a well written post, excellent points. And to be honest - i agree with all of them. However, in the case of a hard locked combat req that means lower levels cant do it at all. So in a way its still more accessible content since more can do it, but its most efficient at a higher level. Which goes for a lot of activities in OSRS. Like i said though i understand completely if someone is holding their weight they deserve the same amount of points, but the raid is "soft capped" at 115 for most efficiency. Which i can understand that part at least. I do agree it may not be the best way to go about things though.

So instead of saying they should change how account recovery works, people want jagex to add something that will lock players out of their accounts for multiple days? That would be more of an issue/annoyance to people than help. Especially when you do get recovered and can't get help because the support system won't get you a reply unless you spam Twitter and Reddit. Remember, not everyone who plays this game is on Twitter and Reddit.

yeah i have plans for her eventually.
---
Usually just ignoring ppl like this feels better than responding 
---
They're so miserable with life, why even bother 🤔
---
haven't kept up with osrs in a while but its probably talking about how pvp clans usually win the dmm tournaments and never solo players no matter what changes jagex make to it
---
What message do you see on the RS website? Did you receive an email on your registered email?
---
I don’t have the stats to do any of those but battlestalves lol
---
tl;dr "REEEEEEEE People treat me the same way i treat people Reeeeeeeeee"

I did it on about 17 and I wanted nothing but the sweet release of death.

&gt; When we were growing up we had to beg our parents for membership but now kids can work their way up to greatness
---
good times, lol
---
eventually i used my allowance and then money from my first job to get membership cards from sevs :D
---
So far yeah! I'm hunting for Tangleroot right now at 94 farming. It's my favourite pet so I can see myself going 200M XP dry as karma for getting so lucky on the other two haha!
---
You can rebuild that pretty easily. Secure your account!
---
To complete.. YOUR quest
---
"you stand alone"
---
Got it twice before 99 farm both on fruit trees 
---
Jagex discarded this idea, because it could help botters/scripters out to improve their bots/scripts.
---
But unironically
---
Yeah same here lol was not fun!
---
Is he “spending several weeks” if it take ten seconds to initiate and then he doesn’t do anything until it’s done?
---
Holy oof
---
I should be okay for supplies, I did a lot of mining in Falador so I have around 900k, but thanks for the offer :)
---
Simple. Use a different trainer. 
---
Would be a nice qol update imo
---
I mean, John Wayne Gacey literally existed on this Earth, so this shouldn't be too surprising.
---
Don't they have 100% protection from white lily flowers..?
---
No more dailies, please :/
---
what is 2fa?
---
Does wielding a dagger and a scimitar let me attack twice?
---
Switch to elite void mage unless you have a tormented bracelet (and occult, but I’m betting you have that) that didn’t make its way into the pic.
---
Can we please get rid of this bot, it may have been useful in the first month the wiki changed but now it’s just a nuisance  
---
Silly me. seems I dropped them.  If you could return them that'd be great. thanks. 
---
Better idea: Fuck PKers because they are huge pussies who wont kill other PKers despite always having anywhere between 100k-5mil in gear on, and instead kill me while im my monks robes farming rev imps, obviously not risking anything.
---
You are very u/Dedicat3d to firemaking it seems
---
Osrs has enough dailies as it is. No.
---
Amazing. No other way to describe this....
---
Bullshit. How would this help bot developers? If they get banned, they're told the reason why they got banned anyways.
---
Sorry I didn't take a screenshot like you professionals.

***Skulltricking prayer trainers on pvp worlds (little did they know I had d-claws)***

As much as I would personally never do this because I'd feel awful ruining someone's day, I mean... You go into the wilderness, expect it to happen. 
---
Big RIP to that guy. You should get "No" and "Why?" tattooed on your body somewhere to commemorate.
---
No

As some people have said but for some reason their comments are getting downvoted. Its that yea you should try to do every task at least once and figure out if you like them or not. And then from there, figure out what are the most efficient tasks for gp and/or xp. Depending on what you want. 
---
For example. Suqas are a great 'xp task' because they have high health, meaning more xp per kill. And you can cannon them. So they are great xp/hr. But I just hate doing that task, so I blocked them. Efficiency wise, its not a good block but for me its a good block.
---
Kraken is a good 'block' xp wise. But for me I like how afk and good money it is. So I do kraken tasks. 
---
Point is, its good to try out all tasks and then look into what makes it enjoyable for you. Then, look into the efficiency of it and make your own list. 
---
I cannot speak from experience but if you can kill something faster, why would you not want to. Even if you do use more food because of the loss of defensive bonuses, that is negated by the fact that you're killing something more times per hour and therefore able to make more profit, and if you're looking for a unique item e.g. ironmen, paying a few more sharks/brews per hour to get that unique quicker is a small price anybody would pay.  
---
That being said fury is the best tank amulet so if your main role is to tank while your teammates do DPS then it does have a use, but at that point if you can afford full justiciar to tank, buying a fury is a drop in the bucket. prior to that you may as well use that 3m from selling the fury to flip stuff on the GE or something rather than it sitting in the bank doing nothing.
---
Downvoted for being right. Smh. 50m ain't shit, that's 1 day of Hydra. 3a robes are also the 3rd best in game behind ahrim and ancestral, and they don't degrade. Fucking AWESOME on an ironman.
---
Wholeheartedly agree, and it’s annoying as fuck to have them constantly be suggested by YouTube when it’s just a re-cap of content I’ve usually already seen.
---
Kneegrowz is the homie
---
Lol mate I’m just annoyed by these at this point
---
Got my rangers on 491, 6 wiz boots up until that point. Don’t give up!
---
It takes like 3 ticks from when Jad telegraphs his next attack to when you have to be praying against it. Plenty of time to protect against even with a 200 ms ping; just change pray ASAP when you see it, and barring fluctuating lag or packet loss, you'll be fine.
---
getting full prospector or w/e its called armor is a lot harder.  
---
For prayer now is pretty easy and not that expensive as it used to be
---
That's what a friend of mine said lol. He just started to play afaik, after much thinking my theory is that he wants to run a bot and have the funds go through me, then to him so he doesn't get banned.
---
for this quest i will be using ranget
---
Last thing ive heard is that he was going to play some other games.

Barbarian Runecrafting?! It's already barbarian enough!

The day that this happened, i checked the GE-Tracker stats for this item. the amount traded had jumped from practically none, to over 500 of them sold on that day with an average value of over 200 million gold a piece. They were using the grand exchange to launder stolen runescape gold basically. That is 100 billion gold transfered from one account to another without trading face to face... if you do it face to face, it will definitely be caught, and you easily stand to lose 50-70k dollars worth of product.
---
This whole thing happened about a week prior to the mod jed scandal coming to light. 
---
if you don't believe this was a rwt scenario, you are fooling yourself.

---
If this gets implemented, the PKers would have much less motivation to kill you at Revs unless you're lower level, and you'd see fewer :) however you would not be getting as &gt;consistent&lt; profit as you would currently.
---
kk thanks for all the information! :)
---
You got the video source? That looks so sick

---
Someone did the math recently and with the new ash buff, it’s more time efficient to use the fertile spell, even if you have to mine more ash. However, it was VERY close to equivalent, and I personally cba to use the spell since I like to stay on the standard spellbook and just use my bucket.
---
Is there that much time between? I thought it was basically the range/magic tell, then one tick to change to the right prayer, then the damage. I can deal with a couple of ticks time.
---
I'm totally fine with failing on my own accord, but it feels real bad when you're just losing connection and something goes wrong. I'll probably be giving it another go in a day or two.
---
Not really cheating tho
---
u wont ragrat that 1
---
I feel like googling iban staff would have been much quicker than asking reddit...
---
I'll probably just wait until clients have autoclickers and shit before I waste my time playing the game anymore. No reason to play when they just keep making it easier and more convenient for people who are too lazy to learn to play the game themselves.
---
Examples could be something like: learning recipes for cooking that make current food untradeable but additional buffs. (healing over time, stat boost, etc) - Perhaps something like adding spices to current food?

I mean, they kill you because you’re in the Wilderness, regardless of risk. They’re in the Wilderness to kill people and you are a person, therefore a target. I don’t get why people go into the Wildy and get mad when they die... in the Wildy... 
---

There's nothing to be done. That happened to me too. With the state of account support, really the only way to get help is to tweet at devs and hope that they're feeling generous. As of now, there's no way to appeal a permaban and submit your case (photo evidence that you may have been hacked etc). It's honestly something I think they community should be way more outraged about considering the amount of energy they put into bitching about docks that got put into Draynor.
---
What you're saying is just bullshit. Jagex literally make Runelite/OSB remove features they deem OP on a regular basis. Go get an infernal cape then come back to me, that's real difficulty, not bullshit indicators or other QoL client addons. 
---
Im so happy
---
The profit for skilling has greatly decreased in the past few months. 
---
Thanks to everyone who showed up!!!!!!!!
---
The budget setup really isn't bad, you won't be far from people with max setup (excluding scythers). You can definitely learn with it. Also taking budget gear leaves more inv spots for brews. Fair warning though, learning ToB is cancer ffa. It took me like 50 ffas to get my first kc because everyone is learning in the 0kc parties.
---
Dude i didnt fletch man... im so sorry got it at 230kc :(((
---
He dced and died so hes continuing as a HCIM regardless of the helmet.
---
It actually is, though in this case it is such a small amount of money it may not matter. The money he had sitting in the GE was money unable to be used on other investments. 25k isn't much, but if you apply this to, say, 250k, there's a ton more you can do with 250k that will get you more money than a 40x flip on 25k. Flipping isn't purely about margins it's about opportunity and time. The longer money sits in the GE not being used to actively buy/sell, the more time and opportunity are wasted. Ideally you'll be flipping things that move fast and often rather than sitting on your hands for a long period of time hoping you strike gold. 25k x 40 is 1mil. 250k x 4 is 1 mil. It's much easier to turn 250k into 1mil because you require a profit margin of only 4gp. The 25k requires a profit margin of 40. Despite profit being the same, time invested is not the same. 25k into 1mil is pure luck, and even if it works it's like comparing cutting willows to level 99 vs tick manipulating teaks. Might take less work, but it's more time and less longterm profit.
---
You’re implying they can’t already do that?

 So, on to of being punished by training rc to begin with i also get ramdomly teleported to the wilderness so griefers get an easy 500k.  with all the ess and the pouches there isn't much space left to get food to defend yourself not to mention the run energy problem if you take combat gear. That ramdom teleport kill the whole thing, that would be too inconsistent to be worth the time

How is someone shitty for enjoying PvPing and killing other players in an area literally made for that? It's nothing to do with anonymity, it's just they have an activity they enjoy doing that other people hate being the target of.

Or if you want to support a content creator they should be rewarded for it with views, add revenue, or subscribers. There are people who are completely unsubbed from boaty or any other top streamer who help support the promo channels but don't care about the person actually making the content.
---
If you want content you should go to the source, not be lazy and give viewership/revenue to some shill who sits around all day abusing youtube search algorithms. 
---
If you don't care about the content creator enough to get their content from their channel or to directly support them don't act like you're supporting them by giving viewership to their competition. You could care less about who made the content and whether or not they have a roof over their head or if they can eat, you only care to consume the content. 
---
Then anytime this fact is brought up people usually say "well maybe they shouldn't be relying on a kids game to support them". So you want the content but wont support who made it. Then when questioned about why you don't want to support them you call them a loser. The end result is it looks like people who get their content exclusively from clip reposters don't care, and it's why posts like this pop up saying it isn't fair. Which then just repeats the cycle of shit talking as no one really cares.

Hi. So this is pretty unfair he was perm muted and the people who are at Castle Wars w334 are still there cyberbullying him even whilst he is already muted. They go out of their way and sabo[spamming cades/helping other team win] which also ruins the game for the rest of us. This pretty much links to the other reddit posts about people complaining about sabotagers making people pay to stop them from saboing. But the people who he listed are pretty much people who sit in castle wars flaming 24/7 and after going into the game and sabo. If we can get some Jagex support maybe anonymously actually coming to Castle wars to see what's going on that'll be great. You'll legit see Pop A Glock and Annakaryl or whatever flaming there. My in game name is Str8OuttaMLM just incase trolls try to say i'm an alt reddit acc. FYI this is my first time using reddit so idk the rules here of exposing the flamer's rsns. Bye. #unmuteSallom - Amy

isn't the rate for pet boosted a shit ton after 200m? does it not count towards crates?
---
all of reddit seems to think that 2fa on email matters.. truth is, it doesn't
---
you can gain access to an account thru account recovery without ever touching the email - and, auth is automatically disabled if you recover so it's pretty useless
---
and let's be real, people who get hacked for alot don't click phishing links / get ratted.. most of the time it's from the broken recovery system using info from database leaks / using a vpn to connect to ur location to send a recovery
---
If the person wasnt an iron man they wouldnt have gotten their shit back. It's nice that some people can be helped, but sucks that not everyone can.

---
I think it's just a meme at this point
---
If you go in the wilderness you should be prepared to get pk'd. A lot of times players pk not just for loot, but for the sole fun of killing others. I assume you've never pk'd before, but when you have a group of friends and you pk some random player it's so much fun. 
---
Ah man, don't look at it like that at all. I'm normal passing as hell; I'm fit, am with a beautiful woman who I love dearly, have a career, good social life, blah blah I'm jerking myself here, but really I'm just as much of a geek as any of these other people.

Not everybody is given the right tools to work on their charisma, or given the benefit of conventional attractiveness, and some people have it manifest in certain ways. I can't shit on someone if they're a basement-dwelling recluse, as long as they aren't hurting or blaming others for it.

Nah listen here man, you shouldn't feel like it's cheating. I bought a good amount of bonds when I was a low level because I had money and it saved me hours and hours of grinding green dragons.

I see it as taking a loan from yourself. At the time I was paying real money for membership, and now I'm at the point where I can make 3m in-game in a single hour, so now I use GP to buy bonds for membership.

I use an extension called LastPass to keep my passwords. They're all encrypted and you only have to remember one master password. You can auto generate new passwords and update most of them from your vault.

Access to an account through recovery is possible, but barely ever happens. Most people get phished and others hacked through leaked databases, because of using the same passwords. Please stop scaring people blaming Jagex's recovery system. And for account recovery to happen all your info must be available online, which you can check yourself. And that's not enough. The hacker must know so much information, like previous passwords, IP address, billing information. It's specific information that's not available in your general database leak.
---
Most hacks can be prevented by unique passwords, auth, 2fa and bankpin.

That is highly unlikely though. Hackers need specific information about you and aren't going to put all that time in you when there's nothing to gain. You have to be a target, they have to know who you are. You're not randomly gonna get your account recovered by a hacker. They need so much information from you which isn't available if you care about security and personal information and even if it is, then still that doesn't mean appeal will go through.
---
Risking dying does nothing but waste like 1 minute of your and the pkers time. You regarding and then hop worlds. Abyss rcing is not a true high risk high reward wild method like chaos altar. So that's a false comparison.

That is... unfortunate. As long as you didn't leave anything on the ground when you died, I think a break isn't a bad idea. But to answer the question, it would depend on where you died and when in the quest.

Haha well I try to be as proficient as possible but as you know I haven’t been on as much as I want to be due to other things going on lol

You finally did it!! All those times people were asking you why you was still there, now you can leave an enjoy the rest of the game!

Jagex opened a way to falsely appeal banned accounts. here is the link.

This game used to thrive around pvp. It was one of the first full loot pvp games out there. But yea the game has become a slayerscape/farmville type game catered to more casual/easier type gameplay. So a lot of people dont understand how huge pvp was back then, especially if they started playing 2008-2012. 
---
Yup, I did it as a mage pure with minimum requirements.
---
Yep, don't need a pin if you do this. Makes it so you can only be hacked if someone has access to you'd phone
---
Source?
---
I know the emote babyrage bro thats not even an extra extension emote but babyrage is for people crying/whining. 4Heed
---
You should probably explain more in your OP lmao..also you were probably safe spotting it, meaning if vena wasnt hitting you that means you technically werent in combat with it meaning yes someone can come attack you. 
---
Catch anything?
---
50/50
---
What settings do you use in game. Also do you use like a stylus 
---
i got mine at 30kc/71fm ;)
---
Let's be real, the only people who fall to phishing scams tend to be new players (and they only lose like ~5m.. pretty much nothing).
---
there's legit 30+ people who recover accounts for a living, but yeah let's say the recovery system isn't busted.
---
third, you don't always really know if your data is leaked. if it's on a  public leaked database, then sure you can use leakedsource or other sites to find out.
---
you do realize there's private database leaks aswell, correct? and, also, once ur data is leaked (e.g. address, isp, ip, name, etc) it'll always be on your account, as Jagex has no option to delete ur personal info. I'd say that a high percentage of OSRS players played this game when they were ~12 years old, and the majority of 12 year olds don't know much about security and thus may have old info leaked.
---
tl;dr: account recovery is busted, and a decent 'fix' would be to add an OPTIONAL authenticator delay.. this would legit fix 95% of problems and it wouldn't cause an issue, because it's optional
---
They honestly could’ve been higher but the last month I hadn’t played every day and had other things happen. But yeah i focused hard on quest first then did everything else after I got b gloves
---
More proficient than me holmes! LOL
---
I think you deserve a bit of down time ;) 
---
Well if you do not want to obtain the Rune Pouch for yourself you can always purchase emblems if the Rune pouch is so ‘essential’.
---
I love TheLillyPad 💚
---
Close to hitting 99 str and hp as well as 92 slayer!!!
---
And a creature that can be easily killed by mid level accounts should be 3m/hour? You could also make uniques like D pick more rare to compensate, I was purposefully unspecific about how things would be balanced.
---
What song is that that it turns into?? Been trying to figure that out every time I hear it
---
Trying to ko someone instantly and then tping out if you don't get good hits.
---
Great

hahaha... dude u made me cry

2 step authenticator is only used for bank space not account security

This was asked recently in weekly Q&amp;As be worth checking the VODs too since they might talk about it slightly more than my transcript:
---
&gt; Q: Teleport to WC guild on WC cape?
---
&gt; A: Yeah be nice to add guild teleports to capes.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/372358887?t=01h01m06s
---
&gt; Q: Can skillcapes more consistently take you to the guild, as it is about half do and half don't.
---
&gt; A: Would be up to look into it! Would have to look into where and how they'd impact them, and whether the teleport would replace the current perk or as a buff.

There is an axe in the bar in brimhaven, i always make sure i have an axe before entering and quickly run there if i forget
---
The problem is Revs are the undisputed best money for mid-level accounts. If the common drops were the same but the gp/hr was held up by uniques, these people wouldn't feel the need to go to the wilderness and wouldn't complain so much. 
---
Use a clue box..

You have to also consider that killing vet'ion takes far longer than the other wildy bosses so there's more time for pkers to show up.
---
Zezima is a botter confirmed.
---
Did 99 not long ago at bloods. 
---
No pet. 
---
Yes but he has the diary that allows 1 safe death per day (even for HCIM) he stopped zulrah after he died (3 times I think) and waited for the next day to continue. Hell hes still wearing a ring of life for kq.

nice work man

great

A human crashing someone for an hour should be bannable? I'll be sure to report. I'm sure Jagex feels the same way you do, that players are allowed to own squares in the game to stand on.
---
There's some in osrs I thought. Ice demon is definitely weak to fire.
---
That's what most people do. The slayer points option was mostly for HCIMs.
---
That's a brilliant idea!

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked ultimate ironman. After recently maxing my ultimate ironman I decided to up the ante, and forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can’t leave Morytania.

You can already autocast good spells with the staff of the dead and saradomin staff though..
---
Fuck you. #BeansRiseUp
---
Why are you playing so many mental gymnastics? Its objectively easier with tiles. The coloring, how bright they are, size. Even tile markers on click to walk, makes it easier. We can argue how much easier for years but at the end of the day it makes it easier, if not why use them? 
---
'Anti-client' agenda. Ok relax, we are not debating healthcare policies. 
---
There's some "debate" about the h sound, not so much being a vowel, but it's soft/silent enough that it sometimes warrants the "an."
---
It's not really a debate, but people get real uppity about it sometimes.
---
It's decently useful as a spec weapon. But if you need the gp you should just sell it at the ge.
---
There is a cc for it. I think its osrs soa 
---
Vegans
---
Nigga you smart
---
Really shouldn't be doing slayer at a low combat level. At least wait for Konar/Chaeldar for tasks. Generally speaking though you start making good gp at kurasks/dust devils.
---
I literally just watched someone lose a mil to a money doubler. People are still falling for this in 2019. God I love this game. 
---
That kid plays RuneScape?

Chair + rope for wildy clue pkers

This guy knows it, that cc is the best

Quit crying and get good. You got exposed, now leave.

The average player can make 3M a day through simple farm runs. 
---
Swampletics really needs to get access to more kinds of food. 
---
You’ve clearly never touched pvp because you genuinely shake when you think of it. You also use cancer as an insult which makes me believe you’re 13. You probably still comment in content creator rushing videos because you love them, yet come to reddit to cry. Nothing in your comment was correct or even rational, it was hard to read, thats how dumb you are
---
Playing osrs were all kids mate. It's as if we never got older and eoc was never a thing. 
---
Yeah, it'd just speed up the process. Not gonna duo with another TBow cuz I wanna snipe the pet l00l but yeah work for Barrows gloves and the quest cape in general should round out your account
---
Sub fee went up because dumb reasons like esports prizes because rot needs money.
---
Hahahaha

You can click the wall in front of the person and it'll auto bank/exchange

Just googling ”osrs alfie” answers most if not all of ones questions. I don’t understand everything going on in the subreddit but I don’t question its relevance to osrs like the post I replied to seemingly did. 
---
TFW you're 99 Thieving and no pet :'(
---
The average player is in the end game? Im a bigger noob than i thought
---
I don'tt get it
---
The relevance is 0. How did you even correlate those two subjects 
---
I kinda miss summoning sometimes.  I did really like Stealing Creation.  I wouldn’t mind Conquest getting added back to the game either, I spent so much time there.  It was easily my favorite mini game.

Duradaddy if you want both, Konar is most money nieve is most xp
---
Vanilla. New item called collection log
---
You're saying when people get hacked they don't do anything about it? 
---
Yes, I agree with you. Auth delay wouldn't solve everything though and would give new problems. If you use a bank pin the only thing you have to do is bank before logging.. I don't see how you prefer auth delay over bank pin? People can get locked out of their accounts, lose days of membership. Would have to wait for days to regain access..
---
It’s special attack.
---
When you click on the two sword ⚔️ tab “combat style” you’ll see a green bar down at the bottom that you can click which will activate the special attack. Not all weapons have this option.
---
If you hover over the green special attack bar it will give you some info on what that special attack is of that weapon.
---
As has already been said it requires engine work and the engine team is *still* working on mobile. 
---
I could just multiply the frequencies by 10 to make it worse for the ears lol
---
I can't be the only player who has literally never had an issue with jagex support. They've always been prompt and helpful to me.
---
My god 
---
I don't get it
---
what con did you end up with
---
i'm not saying it isn't any of the above. 
---
obviously if you bought an account it can always be recovered by the OO
---
if a friend knew all the info to the account, then yeah he can xfer stuff off and snake his friend. generally this isn't the case when people lose their bank though
---
you can look thru weath/other jmods post history, some say "yeah you got hacked cos the recovery had a lot of personal info, etc". if this info was leaked ~6years ago when you were not very smart about security, why should you get punished 6yrs later by someone using this info to hack you? Jagex offers no option to change/delete the details/recovery questions used to recover ur account, so essentially once it's leaked it can always be used unless ur account has a custom note.
---
obviously this pertains to user error in the first place by having personal info leaked, but that doesn't mean that individual should lose their bank to an account recovery when there's ways to circumvent this (auth delay)
---
my email got hacked and now my car is gone...
---
Care to elaborate or you just gonna leave it at calling my opinion dumb without any supporting argument?
---
My eyes hurt with all the blurring going on. 
---
Yes it does:
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows#Rewards
---
&gt;Each brother killed has his associated items added to the possible rewards.
---
&gt;In order to receive a piece of Barrows equipment, the corresponding brother must be killed before the chest is looted. Thus, if you wanted a piece of Guthan's equipment, you would have to kill Guthan before you are eligible to obtain his equipment. Therefore, it is impossible to acquire Barrows equipment if no brothers are slain.
---
If you don't kill say Torag, you won't get any of his barrow gear as a possible loot item.
---

This is absolutely incredible. If this acoustic version was in the game, I'd be listening to it on loop. Very well done. Extremely talented.
---
Would probably make it inaudible
---
So yes please do lol
---
generally a individual is scouted and info is built up overtime to create a successful recovery. sometimes it's the acc owners fault, and other times it's due to the broken recovery system. an option for extra security (maybe ID? not sure about legal, or 2fa deletion delay) would help so much and cause virtually no problems to anyone if it's optional
---
I don't get it.

Yup also I'd suggest using Gmail for your Rs account, it'll automatically block any suspicious IP from accessing your account. Another layer of security to secure your account.

Generally a good goal for free to play is to do all of the free to play quests. By that point, you’ll have a great starting point for the rest of the game in members. Of course, you could do whatever you personally find the most fun.

Sounds like a person that should be watching Twitch. B0aty is overrated and boring.

My thoughts as well. There are a thousand other things to clear from your bank besides pets. Additionally, could just put them in a menagerie
---
what a good idea! It probably won't pass.

Seriously though, I'd love this. It'll be a wonderful addition to my unlimited teleport collection &gt;=)

No, not really. You're much better off going to chaos altar if you want a consistent money maker. Rcers carry a glory as a risk. That's literally it. That's 10k. You spend 1k tabbing out, another 3 or so on supplies killing the guy, you're making roughly 6k per kill. Assuming you can even find someone your level consistently at lower wild levels, which is hard, you're really still not making that great money. Go to chaos altar , thats in lvl 30 woldy so plenty of kills and consistent 70 to 300k pks or more if you get someone with noted bones. Killing rcers is a waste of time efficiency wise people only do it for the kicks.

50-56 bank spaces is still a shit ton for an ironman.... Out of all the bits of content that take bankspace (herblore, pvm gear, runes, etc) farming takes up one of the largest chunks.

I started soloing around 500kc, and just improved over time. All it takes is practice and you will eventually be able to do the efficiently. You don't need max gear for solos but items such as sang staff/tbow/dhcb really helps
---
This is a an AMAZING list of changes that could be done and would greatly improve POH's without making them more overpowered.
---
One additional thing is. Make the Boxing ring for pets so that we can fight our pets against other peoples pets. Make the boxing ring for pets work like the normal boxing ring. Right now you can only fight cats and only your cats, so it's worthless and useless. Plus I think it would be cool to be able to have people battle their pets., See what his golem does against that guys racoon

RoT, a large and well-known PvP clan, has been known for a while now to have, on multiple occasions, engineered DDOS attacks on people, especially during Deadman tournaments. They also have ties to the disgraced Mod Jed and iirc he was abusing his power to funnel gold to the clan. The main controversy is that they have an ingame statue honouring them for prior achievements that were likely achieved by cheating.

Yeah it's a shame. It's something that applies to a small audience but would be extremely helpful to them. Maybe one day.

You got comments about birdhouses so I'll tip you for farming- you dont have to run all kinds of crops, but at LEAST also run hops. It takes an extra 5 minutes for around 90 to 100k straight profit on a run if you have all the teleports unlocked. For fastest access you want to do enlightened journey and watchtower quest (or just use nightmare zone minigame teleport with a certain combat level). 
---
Chronicle and run Southeast
---
Camelot and run Northwest
---
Ring of Dueling to Balloon to Entrana 
---
Nightmarezone and run West inside Yanille 
---
Supposedly you can make more money with jute fibre but yanillian hops are traded more frequently and are more consistent. 
---
I am 82 farming and have never used resurrect crop and would advise you put that time instead into those two quests and adding hops onto your farming runs. If youre farming ranarrs you can potentially make 200-250k a run which is a bond in 3 or 4 days with the minimum amount of teleports on diary items. 
---

Graphics arent a big deal. No one has ever or will ever play rs because of its “good” graphics. The 2008/2010 graphics are shit. Osrs’s is shit too. Hence it dont matter
---
&gt;&gt;That'd just make another point of entry for hijackers. With the rest of the current implementation it would make users security weaker.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;How would adding a secondary email make security weaker? The point of it is by adding an email you never use for anything else besides it being the backup email for your RuneScape account. If you need to reset anything account related and you lost access to your primary email, then you can send those to your secondary. It's the same system Google implements along with other added security that you can optionally enable. Not that I'm comparing Jagex and Google's security measures in the slightest but we can't just sit here and complain about the current system with no ideas on how to fix it.
---
Because for some reason RuneScape players put more responsibility on jagex than they do Google for security of their accounts. Imagine you're a hijacker, rather than one target for hijacking emails you have two emails you can target. The RuneScape account is now twice as insecure. 
---
Just because the point is it's only used for a RuneScape account doesn't mean it is. Can't someone do that with the primary account now?
---
&gt;&gt;The problem is then exacerbated by people like yourself who just assume the system is crap and spin a worse picture with assumptions.
---
&gt;I've always thought the system was good. I came into this thread with the mindset that the system was good and it was OP who messed up with having an unsecured account and made it too easy for hackers to get in. I can see that I have zero idea on how the new system works and I'll have to look through it to decide for myself.
