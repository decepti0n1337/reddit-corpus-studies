I guess i dunno 
---
Illuminate confirmed
---
And if you say it in real life you die
---
What's RWT? But yeah screw all these botting plebs. 
---
Finally finish 99 fishing that I've been working on off/on for a few months now. 93 rn 
---
Haha! You sure got me! 
---
2019 Jan is going to be related to one of the Kebos rewards or monster drops being absolutely stomping overpowered
---
But for how much/what skill lvls?
---
Is that the chance of seeing 2 out of 2 attempts, or 2 out of 171 attempts?
---
Happy New year guys 
---
"Accidentally"
---
back then when I did this which was maybe 3 years ago, it'd cost maybe 20-30$ a month for the bots. I'd sell max accounts and pking pures. you could sell them for a lot more if you got a fire cape on them so that's the only grind id really have but it gets super easy after a while 
---
Just like you sure got OP!
---
Been drinking already... damnit I zoomed in.

It was a j, I found it 
---
If there‚Äôs an update on it you‚Äôll know. Quit asking 
---
It's okay Serene, when you post thousands of dumbfuck comments in any given day typos are bound to happen
---
THERE‚ÄôS NO ‚ÄúPLZ DON‚ÄôT‚Äù OPTION.

Edgeville tends to give a lot of low level tasks at my combat level of 79. At least in my experience. I get lots of Turoth and Bloodveld tasks etc in Zanaris. 
---
I enjoyed this very much 
---
lolwut. im almost 1.9k total with an almost 500m bank, 83 con augury/rigour,etc
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nope its about 107 last I checked
---
Krakens aren't from Greek Mythology, awesome post though!
---
Yeah? It‚Äôs only 200m. Literally just double my entire bank. Cheap.
---
Erase post ffs
---
Tbh. Id lockdown ogresses on a world with 2 or 3 of your accs best thing I can think of. You can use the extended area of that cave after dragon slayer but lets be honest that shits not hard
---
You can just rush tob and get a rapier though
---
It's honestly so exciting to wait and see what memes 2019 will present us. 
---
And make it so ToB doesn‚Äôt profit you brews...

Haha! You got me again! Dang, dude, you must‚Äôve learned all this at the gym. Maybe you‚Äôre on to something.
---
If you can get Jad to spawn in the SE corner of the map you can tag all the healers and run behind the wall in the NE corner. You can kill each healer 1 by 1 without having Jad be able to hit you. They won‚Äôt respawn if they don‚Äôt heal him back up to full health. I like this method that way you don‚Äôt have to deal with prayer flicking while killing the healers. I had 1 def so I prayed melee on them. 
---
Can confirm, just got back from 2080, pray you aren't around for it.

Never knew you could snare them. Would have helped back when I hunted them for money like 10 years ago haha.

I assume you‚Äôre now maxed? If so congrats!!!

The hunter grind for glories feels antiquated. You can passively train hunter with bird houses now so I don't really see a reason to train it other than chins and implings.
---
Happy new year everyone! Hope your year goes well both on RS and real life.
---
Wtf why do you do it like that? Rotate your screen and zoom in Jesus you're a fucking moron
---
Gets 99 smithing, doesnt even smile, doesnt have any friends to tell
---
Now you can finally play the game
---
Nice

Either that or hydra is gonna be complete trash

That's so awesome! Also very wholesome. Good idea to hook him up on RuneScape for Christmas! ü•∞ If you're still in the Christmas spirit, you're more than welcome to hook me up with a little something. I'm saving up for Dragon Claws (I play on a pure). Feel free to message me on here for my name. üòâ

Make them!

He's the Ken M of /r/2007scape

Even still that‚Äôs like $2 an hour which is basically nothing unless you‚Äôre being paid minimum wage lol

I've played for about 1.5 years and I'm 2050 total but I'm a retard no life
---
I wonder how much it would cost to do this for a week or so
---
That way you‚Äôre over halfway to 99
---
Happy New Year from Aus.  
---
How many of you scapers here are Aussies?
---
You can permanently highlight players regardless of if they're online on your friends list or not, so you can easily find your ragging target. Also, there are very few worlds/locations that are active pking hotspots now, so with highlighting it's trivial to find a specific person as long as they're online and pking.
---
There is no way to counter ragging.
---
Sad but true
---
No they only want spades, not challenges 
---
Step 1. Kill the thingies
---
Nice username 
---
depends on your task but uh some tasks you can easily pass 50k/hr i have no idea what you are doing to take 3-4 hours for 50k
---
Ouch :(
---
That's quite sad.  
---
They have a gaming edition, so they just might
---
Still a little niche though, doubt it'd be accepted unless some competition appears
---
If it's your dying when the healers come bring a rcb to agro them instead of the blowpipe. If you're just mispraying then watch those feet and you got this.
---
Probably didnt pull out in time 
---
makes me wish i had a saved pic from the beginning of the year. Just started playing regularly after I got the mobile beta.

i always felt bad about catching these. never anything else. lol

We have some in the PvP section

Hahahahaha what

When should I start sharks? I have 6k total karams I‚Äôll cook which I guess puts me around 85 cook? I think I saw somewhere do karams to 90 then sharks? Or anglerfish..i think sharks
---
No, it was from elite clues :)
---
I used to mine iron ore in the Al Kharid mine, at the triple rock spot. When my inventory was full, I'd run south to the entrance of the mine, where i'd trade all ores to an alt account. I'd bank the ores on the alt account and resumed mining new ores with my main. Both accounts would be ready for the next cycle at just about the same time. 
---
I believe it was around 150k gp/h qt the time, with decent mining xp and just 2 accounts to manage. 
---
Gz 
---

How did this get a positive upvote ratio

Tldr seriously

Why not just add lasagne as a food item? And have the examine text be a reference to Lynx.
---
Is it possible to AFK train in NMZ with rune armour? I've been in Ammonite crabs but as you know, they don't give much money (to buy better gear I mean)
---
And happy new year! :) 
---
Whew, you‚Äôre one to talk about post history bud. 
---
The closest thing to an actual answer to this question comes with a hefty requirement that can't really be achieved in f2p without unlocking the autism perk - 99 smithing. Smithing rune 2h/platelegs/skirts all give consistent profit, probably something like 400-600k/hr. They're reasonably afk so it'll be easy to do on multiple accounts.
---
Tl;DR simply get 99 smithing on multiple accounts easy peasy :)
---
Happy new YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE√ãEEEH-aw
---
I love getting paid to poop but sitting on the toilet is smelly and uncomfortable
---
Dude. I‚Äôm 26 years old. I‚Äôm not about to waste $10 a month on a game. That‚Äôs $120 a year. I could buy amazon prime with that and watch tons of shows and movies. Or get Spotify or a number of other things. Hell, even could buy a planet fitness membership for that amount and work on my health lol. Yes, it‚Äôs easily affordable but it isn‚Äôt justifiable for a game I played back in middle school when I was 12 years old
---
He‚Äôs most likely an iron, those scales would basically be useless :^)
---
Are u gonna vote yes on warding?
---
(Hard).
---
I‚Äôll take 10 please 
---
Same
---
I'm not going to pretend the game is perfect or bug-free but usually when someone comments about the game's pathing, their character is moving in a completely predictable way.  I see it a lot at skeletal mystics with raids groups.  The pathing isn't perfect, but it is consistent.
---
Maybe i need a break. Ran it again and died when jad spawned because the off color mage was literally in the fucking middle of the intersection so jad could have spawned to either the left or the right. I use runelite and i was zoomed out and my draw distance is up high (i have the gpu settings on to use my video card as well) and of course i cant see where he's at. He spawns and i guessed the wrong way and sure enough im praying range and he mages me, 1 shot. Hit a 77. First time his mage attack even hit me so high. 
---
Thats the bloody worst. Feels such a waste of time. Getting super burnt out now with these caves. Not to mention beating jad but dying to healers probably one game tick before it actually completed the caves really took a toll on me. Sigh. Im having no issues with the caves now and im pretty experienced with jad too I feel. I always have plenty of supplies and blowpipe has made things much quicker and easier. Jesus though thats irritating. 
---
The mage was literally smack in the middle. I really wish you could see mobs when they spawn with your distance turned on and zoomed out like that. What a frustrating way to die. Didnt even get a chance to redeem myself against the fat bastard. Time to woo-sah for a minute then give it another go. Im determined to get this damn thing done tonight. Beating myself up over the fact ive done 6 attempts and haven't gotten it done yet. 
---
Mtx as well then
---
Nice.
---
My dog is requesting link, for study purpose 
---
Well with ~30 k pts chance of an items is like 1/24 so youre like twice the droprate and i would call it lucky
---
If we could set a favorite pieces of jewelry to open too, or it could open up to the last pieces that was used. 
---
Hah. Nice. One of the few memes that have made me smile recently.
---
Where do you sell your cans? It takes me 21.5 cans a day to buy my membership 
---
N
---
yeah i got a serp vissy on 2 kc and am now at 567 without a unique, i feel you man. lucky im a main 
---
I upvoted and clicked the post just because I was asked not to upvote lol
---
You need to find yourself a better work toilet. At my current office the toilets are okay, I can chill on it but it‚Äôs not a great experience. 
---
However directly under my office is a hip independently owned coffee shop and their bathroom is divine. Total pricacy, always super clean. When I have time I Waltz down there and poop like a king
---
You need to make your own bread, none of this bought shit 
---
Because the osrs community doesn't *really* know what they want.
---
Most of the plugins don‚Äôt really give you an xp advantage which is what most I feel like are trying to preserve, how easily xp is earned 
---
He‚Äôs not obliged to give other people shit lmao noobs should earn their own gp 
---
are birdhouse runs still a good method?
---
Yeah I didn't play a whole lot for a couple years, started a lot when ge came out and selling wasn't aids then started no lifing this past year
---
The jumping jacks killed me
---
This had me rolling lmao
---
I work in a court building and the toilets I use are very rarely used and very often cleaned. I still don't wanna spend time sitting on them. 
---
Why those levels in particular?
---
Great way to start 2019!
---
Some of the plugins are very EZscape. The clue scroll plugin solves everything for you, including the puzzle boxes
---
the fucc d pick too? Undeserved
---
Any other use for bird nests would be a simple solution. 
---
Slide me a couple mill first? 
---
I average 200m every 100 solos so it's not lucky
---
would it be worth it for me to boost for light orbs?
---
‚ÄúUGLY SINGLE MOMS WANT TO FUCK *YOU!*‚Äù
---
Uh, no thanks...
---
runelite.net is the real one
---
Just use a friend's video for runelite offical link
---
Clue scrolls don‚Äôt really give you an xp advantage 
---
Thats true! Thank you!
---
You just sound cheap af considering you listed these things you ‚Äúcould‚Äù get so I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt have any of those things either. 
---
Of course!!
---
Was saving it for a special occasion 
---
nah d pick was from KBD, it shares the drop on all wildy bosses for some reason. Got pet like 2 years ago, haven't killed it since.
---
Also... illegal? 
---
Oh it does? Huh. They should fix that.
---
You‚Äôre missing out brotha
---
no its not. 40 hours a week times 52 weeks = 2080
---
Is there another version of the meme (same idea but drawn differently) or is this the one that's been posted before? Been looking for it
---
I can't wait for the meme waves
---
If you're blowing glass and have the pies (assuming you're an iron) then I would say definitely yes.
---
Only EZscape thing about the clue scroll plugins is it saves you time from checking the wiki or YouTube for the answer. EZscape is more directed at XP gains.
---
Ahh but for max profit they should get the mining level to acquire runite on their alt. 
---
Which one are you referring to?
---
No idea, I found the image on a different website but it had different text in it, I deleted out the text. 
---
i assume he ment the price of the bars to make the plates lol
---
If this comment reaches -5 I will commit suicide
---
I‚Äôll try it after dwh then
---
Dude your using the old and out dated wiki. Use the new one at oldschool.runescape.wiki
---
mental thing, leveling got really slow and it felt like it would take years to reach 99 probably the reason why alot of people ditch mother lode mine around 90-95 mining for faster exp rates
---
Oof my bones
---
It's possible to get around 100k/hr iirc but you need to lure nechs and dust devils with an alt
---
Wish tbow was better at vork.. I‚Äôm dreading learning zulrah. Got one kill but had to eat a ton the whole time
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
10/10 would bang
---
Terrible bot
---
Yeah, bones for example bury for 4.5 exp, you'll get 4 xp and 5 xp alternating.
---
Yes its fake
---
Sure it‚Äôs possible, but crabs are better. You‚Äôll need to grind awhile to make money from combat
---
As someone hoping back into the game, you're saying smithing addy is the best way to lvl (vs gold bars?) What about until you reach addy smithing level?
---
Not even a 2 hander
---
Smoke devils lose a lot unless you loot with an alt which is fucking aids since you need to manually barrage for max xp/hr
---
Not to stake
---
I added a vote towards your seppuku.
---
Because the goal is to get as far as possible and even if someone hates ezscape, its the most efficient way to play
---
People use alts to lure certain slayer monsters (mainly nechs and dust devils) and barrage them on their main)
---
Is kebos lowlands in the wildy? Im confused
---
Place chisel against forehead. Immediately strike with hammer.
---
Nobody is seeing the fatal error that he is using internet explorer/ edge. Absoulute unit.
---
Such a fat    k i t t y   c a t
---
I read that slayer is good money but I need at least 70 in my stats, is that right? 
---
Fyi to get rid of them you can enable the incinerator in the bank
---
In Australia we typically get 10c a can :)
---
Its not even confirmed to be polled yet. It requires a lot of engine work and engine devs are tied up with mobile, including rs3 mobile. 
---
It would be a byproduct of something that they want to do, which is an official clan system, instead of just friends chats
---
The trade window said 1b.
---
still takes 50-125 hrs depending on stats and gear. on par with other boss grinds. it just has a low rate because of the time it takes to get to jad unlike zulrah with its 1/4000 rate that can be rolled every 1.5 minutes
---
devalues my 1 tile only UIM
---
Your misery
---
But the issue is that the gwd grind isn‚Äôt finished for this particular Ironman. He can get the blade at any of the other three, which I‚Äôm assuming he has not completed.  So he isn‚Äôt even wasting time yet. If he had 6 full blades and no hilt it would be much worse of a situation, so to say his rng sucks is a bit facetious. 
---
Should I bring a dcb and some high end bolts for jad anyway? I always seem to have excess potions at the end.
---
Why not just start selling 2x xp boosts?
---
Hmmm I don't like that. 
---
Deironing should only be for when people abuse mechanics to get around ironman restrictions. 
---
Should have just received a temp ban for bug abuse for that. 
---
2009 was better
---
Also, imagine the stench of the bank. You have like grimy herbs, leathers of creatures and all kinds of other shit. Not to meantion 99% of peoples bank are like your mothers purse, good luck finding my stuff you fuckers. Being a banker in Runescape would suck.

No

Bro I'll be damned if I ever post on this subj again lmao
---
Memes? I thought we had an official drama calendar.
---
i think his point is that you really don't need to learn any skill to get b gloves, whereas with a fire cape you do need to learn a skill.
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with hating America lol this country is a shit show 
---
I really hoped the community would upvote my comment and keep me alive, however I am a man of my word. Goodbye
---
You're probably better off maintaining p2p alts. You only need around 250k gp a day per account to pay for each account's bond, and the rest is your profit.
---
No change. Just sold my nest. I‚Äôll nech myself if the price goes any higher
---
Because OSRS has the dumbest players I've ever seen. To them, difficulty is defined by how long something takes to do, rather than a test of knowledge or skill.
---
I miss FoG and Soul Wars. Castle Wars was great too but last i played it was just people ticket boosting
---
I bet you suck dick behind lumby castle 
---
?
---
2k total currently 1618 so a way off. Fire cape quest cape and a green cash stack
---
I may have freaked when I saw the items but was still being hit by a skeleton, so I TP'd before thinking I should take a screenshot. Forgive me for this failure.
---
Since it isn't even in the wildy, sure lol. I'll take 2x exp for a useless skull. 
---
Kebos comes out in January... I predict Alchemical Hydra drop table drama. :)
---
Ah ok, yeah I suppose I can see that being ok then. 
---
Get 500m bank and not stake it away
---
Those are some niiiiccceeeeee fucking banners you got there. Hella fucking nice banners.
---
Iban‚Äôs blast until 75 for trident 
---
Nope... Sorry lad
---
Yeah don't worry your account will work on both :) SMS package means paying by phone 
---
Okay thank you! :) 
---
Free money, reasonable xp, takes only 2min at most. Why not?
---
Does f2p have access to the mining guild? With the deposit box so close to two three iron spots you can easy mine 2k an hour at 60+ mining
---
Sold everything at the end to get most his money back I'm guessing

Fr the Ugly Part is a *really bad sellin part* imo

Thank you, I never knew I needed it so much I Guess 2007scape has fuckloads to block 
---
It's available on desktop and PC, like everything on your account. 
---
No clue what the SMS package is.
---
You need at least 70 combat stats, and also 70 slayer to get profitable monsters. 
---
The wiki‚Äôs historical price data is currently stored in modules, page names in the format of `Module:Exchange/item/Data`, eg https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Module:Exchange/Bones/Data. You can get this as plaintext by adding ?action=raw https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Module:Exchange/Bones/Data?action=raw
---
This is a lua module which returns data in an array of strings, each of which is in the format `unixtimestamp:price` (or `unixtimestamp:price:volume`, if volume data is available (though IDK if that was setup for OSRSW)). This should be easily parseable using regex.

yeah i got it figured out, thanks for the input! :)
---
Wah freak nice lie you crashed me, and i stand by you being a N*gger.
---
Yes. Ahrim's is godly unless you're in the small fraction of players who can afford ancestral. It costs 11k an hour to use the top and bottom if you don't use an armor stand, which you should. 11k comes out to about 25 spell casts on a trident.

Think I got abyssal head around 50 kc 2nd one around 1k, both abby demons.

Back in the days of dial-up, every bit of data was pretty important. The developers of the game decided to save some data by taking an image and mirroring it for the log in screen. Its been discussed on the developer streams in the past when the question had arisen before

i will play with you IGN Neasvish

It troubles me that you cannot communicate effectively while being in the position you‚Äôre in

Watched when it came out, may have gotten emotional during the sigil clip

My IGN is PsychedToast
---
I want. Cute monkey 
---
Haha three an hour more. This guy
---
But doesn't that logic apply to the ironman stealing the imp?  For all he knows the other guy is an ironman on the same shitty grind.
---
Nice Dlong fucking noob
---
Actually I‚Äôm 13 get it right IDIOT
---
Yeah it is. I‚Äôd probably focus more on completing quests and unlocking as much of the game as you can. You‚Äôve got plenty of different options for money making that are less of a grind. hunting implings, blast furnace, herb runs, etc.
---
Only like 6x mine!
---
Nope, maybe don't sign up for double xp streams or 'streamer' giveaways next time. Don't sign your account in anywhere except official osrs website 
---
Congrats you spent 60 hours making $0.12/hr.
---
He got 24 pages
---
Honestly, probably just filling bowls with water. 
---
Nonsense ? You spasstic dont even live in Germany how can you reconfirm it ? 
---
l&lt;
---
Are you thinking that lots of people will have a New Year's Resolution of "start grinding OSRS"?
---
I thought it was referring to the OOF sound that plays when you get shot in PUBG
---
Informative or not prt scn Ffs,  happy new year
---
But that‚Äôs what I said? 2080 is a full time salary job, but other people sometimes are built around higher hours, such as CPAs.
---
Which Runelite plugin makes your buttons look like that in the bottom right?
---
It's been revealed many many times that the population does indeed grow significantly around this time of year. 
---
Shh, people don't like when this is pointed out. The Jad prayer notifications and Dragon Imp highlighter require the utmost skill to use and provide no benefits related to Ezscape whatsoever!
---
Why would you post thi
---
This is the funniest thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub in a long, long time. 
---
I just did agility with tele‚Äôs in my inventory and waited in the Ironman cc for someone to call dragon imps out. It was actually so much easier and less stressful than puro puro. But crafting is more beneficial as an Ironman. To each their own. 
---
Spastic, he is on 30kc with the top and 24 pages.
---
Clearly not talking about him, switch on.
---
By retarded people standards you meant to say right? This guy was probably telling the crasher to get cancer and using the n-word or something all while the crasher is laughing at him, reports, and hops.
---
Literally impossible. 
---

This is downvoted a lot, but I always feel sad at the end of a book of tv series, I imagine with the amount of time he's sunk in there's got to be some level of melancholy. It's like leaving a part of you behind.

I have interacted with pkers. Pkers usually don't talk, because that's how you die easily. There are toxic people all over the game, but I haven't seen any that I can remember in PvP.

Love you ModmatK played since 2001 and came back for ironman and have not had this much fun on a game in years. Will always love Runescape thanks to people like you.

Honestly, I lost huge respect for this community back when RuneLite was threatened to shut down... there were tons of posts of people saying they couldn't play the game without it. Even nowadays with mobile I see some people with remarks about not having RL there.
---
Are those people *really* that unintelligent that they can't play a child's game and need everything highlighted in bright colored boxes?

I think Anthony Bourdain did it in Asia somewhere as well.
---
Okay! IGN is PsychedToast

Dont forget them saying they will quit if MTX come in the game when they already are! Everyone ignores bonds when they are legit ways to buy gold with real life cash!

Make bird houses convertible into kindling which would act as stackable logs soyou could make fires without banking at a higher prices of training or you could make fires at fishing spots etc.
---
No jagex motto is too make the drop table OP at first then nerf it.

I mean im not really surprised as great as the game is and as cool of a community is brings there are always toxic shit heads like this.

Up to 3k if you're a trusted person. If not then probably way less than that

Except the problem isn't solved since people still fall for this daily, and there is no reason it should continue.
---
Maxed accounts go for about $1000, most good but not maxed accounts go for $400, although considering you put 8000 hours into the account, you lost about $120,000 in money you could have made working a $15/h job during that time instead. 
---
Why do you care

How many ahrim's sets do you have in your bank?

I know and im not trying to change that, op asked what part of quests i hate most and that is that i have to do them 
---
Why do you care about a 5 day old thread
---
Exactly. More MTX will come into the game gradually, and people will find all sorts of ways to justify it.
---
Guess you forgot about vorkath, they made it shit then super OP then they made it balanced at last

If your registered email has one, where's the problem?

My office doesn't have service in the bathrooms. I've been contemplating complaining to the safety manager. What if I slip and fall and break my back in the bathroom? Do I drag my limp lower half out of the bathroom or call for help? I need service in the shitter.

Runelite gives QOL updates that the main client should have. That's it. 
---
It's based on state. Some states give a 10c deposit other 5c. I think there's a Seinfeld episode about it
---
hop to f2p pvp world or wilderness world and looting :) . but seriously buy membership for 11$ or a bond for 6$ for 14 days membership. money making in members is 10x easier and faster

How can you make the runescape client smaller on your screen? My screen is fairly large yet it take up almost half the screen.

Dont forget to laugh when they ask if your piss clean

Pick them one by one, don't try to pick all of them off at the same time, your main focus is still Jad. So get one, switch your attention to Jad, get the next one, again focus on Jad and getting the prayer flick. Put on steel skin because they can hurt sometimes. 
---
Once you picked them all (think it's 4?) move in one direction so that they gather in a line. After that you don't have to worry about them. Just don't freak out about them, as long as you get your flicks right, they're not a problem. 
---
There were no arguments about being unable to play the game without it. 
---
There were arguments saying "shut them all down or none of them down, what the fuck?" because a paid client (osbuddy) was allowed while a free client (runelite) was being disallowed.
---
(Until it was clarified that the reason for termination notice was due to the open source obfuscater decryption)

Depend on what you are ironman or not. Wildy altar is pretty damn good but if you don't wanna die or deal with the stress of pkers doing gilded altars is the other alternative.
---
:)
---
Because people don‚Äôt fully understand binding keys aren‚Äôt against the rules. So instead of calling it ‚Äúpushing the rules‚Äù legally is more like correctly informing people they CAN do it.. with no worry of breaking the rules. 
---
Trimming armor for free

that's what I meant too. I purposely made the distinction between display name &amp; log in username

---
True. The enjoyment from playing Runescape should be what you value.
---
I know my future son, Capp, will for sure become the new Zezima
---
Not an iron man, what are gilded altars again? Haven't played this game in 10 years.
---
Allow us to craft player worn wigs from birds nests for fashion scape. 10/10 would wear. 
---
added you
---
Ensouled heads = cheapest and longest
---
Wildy alter = half cost of guilded alter on average , more exp per hour but have to worry about pkers ( unless you have an alt hold your bones which eliminates this risk) 
---
Guilded alter = most expensive method but safest and most afk.
---
All that effort when you could just pay $11 for a month. That's like 36c a day.

Yes, there's no difference between mobile/PC accounts

So world 330 is House party world that people use other peoples houses to use bones on a gilded altar that gives increased experience. Im not 100% sure what house portal they use on OSRS but the concept is you get your inventory of bones go to the house portal join a house thats advertising gilded altars and use your bones on that altar for increased experience. Rinse and repeat.

Got excited just typing that

I‚Äôm not so poor I can‚Äôt afford the membership fee and, in fact, Runescape is currently offering a 7 day free trial to its mobile members. The point of the whole thing was to have *fun* doing it. We play OSRS for that sense of accomplishment at getting 99s or even just meeting some random goal. I wanted to do something that probably not a lot of other people had attempted and I achieved as much. It was no more a waste of time than any other game I have chosen to play over the years. 
---
lmao thats what i was thinking. with such a specific amount of gp he probably paid for that 100m too
---
The good ol' pump n dump.

Not with wildbloods though

Ha, yeah I have a tendency to run away with my thoughts sometimes...

Wait yeah. Happens all the time. If your weapon can‚Äôt reach him because of the distance, then tour character SHOULD run out of their safe spot. You just learn the distance you should atk at

You're trying to fix something that is unsolvable without damaging the game. When I was a kid I got scammed and I learned to be more aware because of it, it's a good thing to be honest.
---
I‚Äôm looking for a girl clan!
---
i was joking about the infernal capes. but if you're serious, very, very few people can live off runescape. it's something that i would only do on the side. don't make it your main source of real life income
---
Fair enough. It still applies to a lot of the people who do rediculous amounts of things in F2P just to get 14 days of membership.
---
How to make one annoying and tedious grind fun? By making another account and going through the boring and tedious grind of getting that in a position for it to be efficient enough to get max xp rates on the skiller and not to mention I'll be then doing that awful method on both accounts just for it to be only worth it on one account. If I was ever going to consider this method I would at least want someone with me for it to even have a chance at it being slightly entertaining. 
---
Nah paid for 20 mil and staked it all a couple times:) sorry I don't have time to train it all out! ;)

Uh, if you accidentally jerk the steering wheel, it‚Äôs gonna do exactly what you think it is. Your character doesn‚Äôt randomly run out into the open by itself, the player does it on accident.

Okay here‚Äôs my situation: I‚Äôm leveling mining and smithing right now, just finished getting the coal sack, and full prospectors kit, and access to the upper level of motherlode mine. But now I want to switch to blast furnace to level smithing, should I stick to mining mlm to get all the coal and ore, or go to the mining guild to farm up coal for the other bars?

by the way you add the question flair by making a reply to your thread with just "Q". you should have gotten a pm by automod telling you this

Soloing sucks. With 15m, team raids would be NEAT
---
i started in 2002 and trust me we never had customer support.
---
In terms of defensive stats (after looking at the wiki), Torags Dharoks and Guthans top are the best defensive barrows piece and equal stats (veracs is better than rune but not as much as the 3 above)
---
For legs, veracs plateskirt, Dharoks, and Torags legs are the best barrows piece also with equal stats.
---
I recommend Torags just cuz from my knowledge, it is the cheapest of the 3 around 300-400k for the top and 200-300k for the legs (unless they went up haven't checked their price in months) compared to over 1m for each of the other pieces
---
Hope this helps

Yep saw that after posting.

and jagex laughs all the way to the bank

So I just comment on this thread?

I'm high as fuck and this was my biggest laugh of 2019 so far. Thank you for this.

i never got a shard 3 unfortunately. Completed zamy and sara. I hope i get my shard at bandos. I already got a bandos hilt, the only item i still want from gwd is a bandos chestplate to complete raids with solos.

Its about reading things. I read your thing, now you read my thing.

What? Fairly certain this is just someone not understanding the mechanic of wearing warm gear to reduce damage taken in wintertodt. I did 99fm on an ironman not too long ago, and there were rounds where I didn't have to eat anything at all.

Yes, GE is generally where to buy things. The only thing that people really still trade outside of the GE are bulk junk items (like coifs or loafs of bread).

Oh no biggie man I‚Äôm not the guy you were replying to earlier so no need to get defensive lol. I was just throwing in my $.02 :P if you don‚Äôt wanna be a member then yeah don‚Äôt be a member. I just personally don‚Äôt think the game is worth playing f2p anymore like it was back in the day simply because f2p hasn‚Äôt barely changed since 2007 whereas members has had fuck tons of updates. You do you though man hope you have a good new years
---
Yes, rip to the $200 you just spent on it. Original owner will likely recover it if they didn‚Äôt give you the info. Even if they did they can still recover the account by providing info to Jagex that you‚Äôd never be able to know.

It‚Äôs also very against the rules to buy and sell accounts.

[Serious] Why is Wintertodt so retarded in every way imagineable?
---
Seriously who the fuck designed this stupid ass minigame?
---
What the hell is even a Wintertodt?
---
Why are only the most LEGITIMATELY toxic players playing it?
---
This minigame is so stupid. Literally you spend 5 seconds here and 90 percent of your health is gone. Doesn't matter if you have 10 health or 100 health. 5 seconds and your HP is down 90%.
---
Then it's so fucking tedius. Ok you cut roots. But you feed the brazier. Every half second, cold hits you. You need to click feed brazier again. Half second later, cold hits you. You click again. Of course this old ass fucking game has a delay of 2 seconds per action. So your stuck having your character click the fucking brazier every 3 seconds like some dumb fuck!
---
Team minigame? Yeah if you're team is 60 other assholes with nothing better to do one night and you have to make a world for it. A team is 3-6 fucking people playing and working togeteher like in DOTA or League of Legends. Not this stupid shit.
---
Fuck you jagex.

Fuck this newscape shit.

Fuck you twitch kids.

Comment a ‚ÄúQ‚Äù  for question

If you only play mobile then that rules out about 90% of the options if you want to make money consistently.  Flipping on the grand exchange is probably the best bet.

But I mean, how can I switch it between it's two styles? Don't I need to get kills in Bounty Hunter?

i used to stand inside the varrok palace and be in awe of all the people selling r2hs for like 1m making b0nk
---
well first i would buy it and see if it lets you switch between them with zero kills. if not you can just wait to get a target who will let you buy the kill
---
The average player has multiple accounts these days, do you really think players who are profiting irl from their in game activities don't have more accounts than Jagex can reasonably ban?
---
have you tried wearing warm clothes lmfao
---
\o
---
Fantastic post, Serene. Wins best of 2019 (so far) for sure!
---
Merching clans are not against the rules. 
---
Price manipulation is. 
---
There are lots of people who like to merch who form clans just to talk, hang out and so on. 
---
Wintertodt is a snow monster trapped in there for ages by the people of Kourend to stop it from running around killing them.
---
I don't know but I feel everyone meming on here about it being toxic could possibly draw toxic people over there. (Also the non-toxic people are likely silent there, and for good reason.)
---
Wear warm clothing and you won't take as much damage from the cold, you shouldn't lose 90 percent HP in 5 seconds, it should be about a minute or 2. 
---
The delay is 0.6 seconds as long as your ping isn't too bad, due to the tick system working that way. There is a Wintertodt world hosted in US, UK, and Germany, so pick the closest.
---
60 people is still a team, just because most competitive games use small teams doesn't mean it's not. The world is so you can find people to do it with because it's really hard to do it with a small group.

This is still a farcry from modern MMO's, even if it doesn't have something similar 2007 and before.

If you just want to do something different for some xp, it can't hurt. But, from an efficiency standpoint, I believe the veteran boat is way faster for points. It is nice to have void earlier if you plan on grinding range xp though, so up to you.

Chances are your email got leaked. That or you might have clicked on one of the fake double xp streams. Plus you not having an authen didn't help either, so it made easier for whoever got into your account.

\[T]/
---
The term originates from Latin, then in Medieval Latin which it then took place as French, which all educated, sophisticated people of culture know was brought to England by the William I and Normans in the middle ages.
---
Fast forward a lil and the mighty Brits bring the English language over to the Americas, along with the common cold, devastating the native population and forming the always grateful colonies.
---
A fun fact I doubt they teach in the American syllabus, the French and the British actually fought over territory in America, the British won, but at some financial cost, the Brits asked the colonists for compensation for basically saving their skin but, ever grateful, they refused, so the Brits declared taxation to recoup their losses.

Isn‚Äôt that what a merch clan is? Price manipulation? 
---
Your 2nd point is more a community clan that throws around ideas, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call that a merch clan since there isn‚Äôt a concerted effort to merch specific items as a group. 
---
&gt;  That or you might have clicked on one of the fake double xp streams.
---
You dont just 'click them' you gotta click them, go to the account section, go onto their spoofed runescape site and then provide your account details. 
---
Can you imagine the diet and sedentary lifestyle of most people here?
---
Fake double xp streams are run by scammers. They download the latest dev blog livestream, stream it saying double xp is now active. they provide a link to a fake Runescape website and of you log into the fake website, it steals your account info, it's called phishing. 
---
There is also fake streams of popular streamers such as B0aty or Faux or Sparc Max saying they're quitting but as I stated before it's fake, same concept as the fake Double XP scam. They set up a fake website to make it look like the actual RS website
---
I literally just explained that in another reply.
---
but... it's literally called English...

Thats because the game has been made much easier as well.

Thanks!
---
Nah. Merch clans have been around forever, as people who like to well.. merch, flip, invest, sell rares and so on. That is what you're talking about when you say merch clan. 
---
Price manipulation is something that was done by some specific merch clans that caused a problem. 
---
There are likely still some people out there manipulating prices either alone (I know of a guy who does) or in groups. 
---
But eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevery single time a item changes in price quickly, there are people here on reddit blaming "merch clans" with  nothing to back it up.

Maybe runelite's site is a better place to ask this?  I know that runelite wouldn't allow certain plugins such as a zulrah helper that Jagex don't want in the game. If I were to write my own plugins would they have to be approved by runelite and added to the next runelite release before I could use them?  Or is that not bannable?  Mostly curious because I have a few plugin ideas but I don't want my main to get banned while I debug them. 
---
You'd be far better served (from an efficiency point of view) spending the time you do on getting the new amulets getting your crafting or hunter up instead.
---
From a fun point of view, I'm not going to tell you you're wrong, because we all have different versions of fun. If you find it fun to do it the way you are (and I don't mean that in a condescending way) then power to you. You do you.

Wow what Authenticator did you use? I thought most only work with one device at a time

Just hit red chins man, I loved doing it and made it to 99 that way

They picked her for you since you're also fuck ugly btw

That's 2 spectrals in 2 rolls

If you‚Äôre f2p it‚Äôs hard to get the 2m or whatever they‚Äôre at now but the easiest way is to just kill stuff. But if you‚Äôre a member it‚Äôs incredibly easy because herb runs (through farming) only take a couple minutes and can easily pay for a bond if you just do a few a day. The initial bond will take a little while if you don‚Äôt play much but after that you‚Äôre in the clear
---
Haha this is accurate but cancer
---
Flipping death runes made me realize how big this game is right now. I can buy and sell so many, so fast, that it's more profitable than going to the store even tho the store price offers a way better margin.

I used the google Authenticator for my rs account with my bank pin. For my email I used googles 2 authenticate factor and both accounts had 2 different passwords.

Let us pvm'ers play in piece? Cmon man, you're not that naive. The game would be boring without risk, and you should be greatful the wilderness exists whether you pvp or not. It's very positive for the game.

I think he has mouse pointer acceleration on. It seems like his mouse moves different distances each time, which happens if you move your mouse at different speeds with acceleration on even if you move it the same overall distance. Easy to do if you're nervous or excited, which is part of why everyone who plays games should have it off.

&gt;It's totally arbitrary which obstacles the game decides you can or can't mage or range over.
---
I mean, obstacles were arbitrarily designed by the game devs but are consistent across Runescape. It's as easy as looking up a guide and learning where safespots are, how your character interacts with them, etc. Everybody knows how to use the Italy Rock in fight caves for this, Wyvern safespots, etc.

I‚Äôve been on and off mainly because I want to uderstand what I‚Äôm doing before I do it so before i renew yet another bond I would like to know how farming makes money. Currently have 51 farming and havent a clue of an optimal herb run route (i assume i‚Äôd be using avantoe). Also are birdhouses still a thing? Heard they were nerfed and never tried. Also any pvming that I can do at my level other than zulrah? Ign is Lntix and I can do zul in about 3min. 
---
yeah i‚Äôve never been able to do it consistently. i got a lucky a few times here and there but it‚Äôs hard to not get pk‚Äôd
---
Mr.Satan will beat everyone's bitch ass

It's a popular spot for PKers to check. Not really worth doing IMO. There are money makers that don't require for you to constantly be on the look out and stressing that are as good or better.

I want Freddy Krueger gloves that fletch my logs while I put them in my bag.

How is this changing the core game

I believe it‚Äôs on average 1 extra nest each run of 4 bird houses. That alone is pretty close to making up the cost increase going to magic logs.

I think the issue with Runelite is that people generally shrug off 3rd party clients as just being toggle-able QoL additions when a lot of plug-ins take away from the initial skill or difficulty of certain activities (Kourend Library, prayer prompts, to name a couple). 
---
I'm all for updating QoL and 3rd party clients really are some fantastic software, but they're undeniably becoming more problematic when every discussion around some game-changing QoL updates often turns into "just wait until Runelite adds it" and then it's suddenly okay to exist as long as it's not attached to the main game/client.

It would be a good idea to sell the whip and use the scimitar. Train strength with it until you have enough money/bis items everywhere except for main hand then buy another whip and start training attack and defence again. That‚Äôs my personal opinion!

Happen to me like two weeks ago. Had Authenticator on RS n bank pin. Not sure How he got my email Because I never use that email, Only When I made the account. And that was few years ago, do I press links? No. Lost around 40m, lucky me he never got into my bank.

Oh baby. Amazon fire for $40. Download google frameworks and playstore. Get runescape mobile. Best

Yes. That only makes it even better.

I'd say what's unnecessary is balancing npcs around end-game items that only the few have access to making everything else underpowered in comparison.

Runecraft nature runes.

Thank you :)

It's only for the charge spell. To cast the god spells themselves you'd still need runes.

Damn, he covered the berries. Would have got him otherwise :/
---
Why do people keep saying this when its really not true. Who goes into ToB with space for extra brews that doesn't fill those slots with extra switches? 
---
No it isn't. It's very consistent. One type of obstacle is going to work every time: Not just this one is okay, but the one two squares east of it is not. No everything can be ranged/maged over, but that would still be consistent. And if you're using an obstacle for its corners, you need to make sure it's east/west not north/south.
---
i hope so

You do realize the fur is like 70% the difference, right? They are ice trolls that adapted to a different environment; it isn't unreasonable for them to look different. And there is more than just the throwing animation.

I'd say there's a good chance it's a bis item. If the boss is tribrid, dhcb or tbow will be bis depending on magic level and how fire protection works, although dhcb is guaranteed to be a good range weapon. Lance or scythe will be bis melee, and sang staff will be bis mage. There's no reason those items should go down at the moment relating to the hydra.

Well my goals were to max and complete inferno before the end of 2018, which I completed on Christmas. So now I have no goals and can have fun doing whatever I want while not worrying about not working on goals 
---
it would require defense reduction to not work, the boss to have good hp or the boss to require an anti shield. in order for the dhcb to justify the huge rise it would have to be better than bow or pipe. The dhcb is not particularly rare from raids at all.
---
&gt;There's no reason those items should go down at the moment relating to the hydra.
---
i mean there is, the smart thing from a merching perspective is to dump before the update, theres way less risk selling now, even if dhcb is bis it'll be very unlikely to rise above its recent peak.

I never said anything about being time efficient???

Thats fine whats your username

Eh, I‚Äôm one of those I don‚Äôt want the game to keep changing types. I played back before runecrafting came out in RuneScape 1 (or classic or whatever you wanna call it). I was increasingly disappointed with the skills that came out after RCing. Farming seems super pointless, I hated/still hate the idea of player houses, slayer was ok I guess. I just don‚Äôt want to see another half assed, unnecessary skill added. Perhaps an unpopular opinion on reddit but I think in game most people have a generally same feeling. 
---
Yes. Anything is more constructive.

What if your account got hacked at lvl 125? Hmmm.....

I have a few methods. With your levels you could either Blast Furnace steel bars you can look up a guide on youtube for this but to make it efficient you're gonna need to get the coal bag from motherlode mine, makes things alot easier and it doesnt take too long to get.
---
Or you could level hunter to the point where you ca  red chinchompas but this make take a few days to get to that level, decent money though.
---
Lastly, what I recommend, do some quests to level farming to the point where you can farm ranarr's then look up a herb farming run guide.

Sick loot mate keep it up
---
That's not the correct gem rate. I looked up a "99 mining at mlm" post and saw that he received 1751 gems after mining 96169 ore, so about 1 gem in every 55 ore mined. This was without a charged glory on which roughly triples the rate of receiving a gem, putting the rate at 1 every 18.3 ore mined.
---
This would put the probability of getting 4 gems as the first 4 drops in your inventory at 1/(18.3)\^4 = 1/112k, or for the probability of it happening somewhere in your inventory (25 trials) at about 1/4.5k. This is 1-(P\[not happening\]\^25\] = 1-\[(1-1/112k)\^25\].
---
The guy whose post I looked at had 96169 ore so 3434 inventories completed for 90-99. So from this we know that you can expect 4 consecutive gems in an inventory from 1-99 mining at mlm but not expect 4 consecutive gems in a particular spot.

thats what im saying he's been going on and on and on and on all week about how he wants a scythe soooo bad and my bank total was 1.35b and scythe is about 1.255 so thats what im saying he took the exact amount needed to either buy a scythe or stake my shit cuz he's too pussy to stake his own bank and figured if he staked my shit and won he'd have a scythe and could put back the gp/items he stole off my acc b4 i logged back on and noticed my shit was gone.
---
Void is only really worth it with 90+ ranged at certain bosses (Vorkath for the most part). 
---
The real usefulness comes with the opponents defence levels. There is a threshold where the accuracy bonuses of hides out dps‚Äô s the damage boost from void. Woox has a chart he posted on his Twitter a few days after the void nerf. I‚Äôd check that out.

I hear they will be used in the new kebos slayer area. The devblog says you need to wear boots of brimstone in the area but people are saying that granite boots work there as well which offer better stats. I can't find any info on were it says granite boots are needed in the new slayer area though
---
Good idea. However, if you don't boost its DPS, accuracy or max hit, holy water's still pretty much useless since even mith or bone bolts are much better.

Actually I think it‚Äôs better to train combat stats to around base 80s before really starting slayer. That speeds up the early levels a ton.
---
Here's what you're looking for https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Worn_Equipment

and then if you click the cape slot you can see every wearable item in that slot on a table.

Making 13m with the opportunity cost of not having your gear to boss with and make money. 
---
How much bossing did you do in that week versus your normal amount?
---
No, ogresses drop some god alchables whereas hill giants don‚Äôt.
---
Ogresses are also like combat level 70 or so (I think more than that), whereas hill giants are about level 27/28
---
cant wait to see alfie getting arrested of using all that aderall
---
I just don't see what special claim OP would have because he logged in 2 seconds before the other guy and saw the imp first. The way I see, op fucked up the snare (he was super slow and had plenty of time to freeze it in his location), so honestly it was his fault. But personally I enjoy competitiveness.
---
For any actual new player, know that this is a scam. You cannot trim armour and anyone who says they can just wants to scam you of your shit. The commentor above was just making a joke.
---
and make sure your official osrs website is actually official and not a phishing site from a youtube link that looks exactly alike
---
Shut up Serene

No, uncreative swine. Seek help.

Do you know what warm clothes are? you typed all that out to only find out ur the retard who doesnt know how to play the minigame
---
why do they use 0 instead of o l
---
no it's not. the clans im in become sexist once they find out I'm a girl, that or try to find me on social media etc. thats why I want a girls clan. please leave this thread, it's not for you, why are you even here? 
---
They rebooted from a 2007 server and everything from that point on has been added via polling. 
---
The community are largely against anything resembling the game closer to its rapid fall, with some exceptions.
---
"Welcome to part 7 of my ironman series, today we will be hunting for dragon implings so that we can make glory amulets!"
---
No, amateur. Lurk moar and adjust to the environment before spouting baseless hatred against top-tier individuals.
---
Yeah D W D is an amazing community, absolutely one of the best clan chats in OSRS
---
Insults and ad-hominems isn't worth reading, and shouldn't be tolerated.
---
Runescape had a rapid fall?
---
I must not've been playing at that point. I honestly thought it was popular right up until runescape 3 was released.
---
oh..my..goodnesss..burned!!!!!!!
---
So you‚Äôve decided to become toxic / sexist and attack people responding who have mean no harm? Maybe the clan you were in wasn‚Äôt being sexist you just turned out to be a huge cunt bitch and you were just treated equally oh the irony 
---
It's ok bud. I'm glad you found something that makes you feel important.
---
Nobody really likes being the big spoon anyway
---
Idk, I think to make it look all capital letters, in which case may suggest they are trying to get a point across i.e. laughing out loud
---
you wasted like 10 minutes of your life coming on here, reading this thread, commenting, then replying - when it had nothing to do with you HAHAHA WTFFF what the actual hell is wrong with you dude get a life, this is my thread ofc I will comment. It has nothing to do with you, so why are you?
---
Because it's skilling boss not a minigame
---
Giant seaweed has made crafting on an ironman as easy and passive as farming and herblore.

No..

Ah. My one experience with a PK'er was terrible :_
---
What is RoT? I've seen it talked about disparagingly several times but I still don't know what it is...
---
You brought me into this by being toxic I commented my username and you went full sjw bitch cunt you want to be toxic expect nothing less back 
---
Ps: are we best friends now 
---
&gt;31, no job, no degree
---
Partially due to participating in incest, perhaps. Yep. Not exactly a healthy mindset there
---
Who have I attacked? 
---
Who have I been sexist toward? 
---
you have called me a huge cunt bitch, a dumb cunt and a bitch. now I wonder who is attacking who, and who is being sexist hmm? 
---
Removing the wilderness and free trade was a pretty fall during RS2

you tried to join this to stir shit, I can tell because I know you're not a girl, and I know you don't like women from viewing your posts. Not sure how telling you to re-read the post and wondering about your literacy is 'toxic', as its clear you either didn't read the post, can't see the post, or are trying to stir shit :)

thanks, bye now.

Can I join? I want to finally try to connect with other players in this game. It‚Äôs pretty much been a solo rpg for the last 3 years of my playing and I want to do things with other people.

I also got bcp at 9kc so that‚Äôs why I was so excited.
---
You'll get licked.
---
jagex can barely manage computers 
---
That's a very different situation. A more apt comparison would be someone getting 500-1k points. You'd expect a kick from a raid with that "contribution"

Yeah sure mate. Just join the cc if you just want to chill in it. If u want to official join and get a rank you can search ‚Äúelysium cc‚Äù on the rs forums and apply. Then you can also get an invite to the clan discord :) we do fun events, skill of the week, god wars, raids etc :p 
---
i love this map
---
Finish off all the skilling pets, 4 left and go for ranks.

If nothing else, I'd love it for mobile. On PC I can make quick "oh shit nonononono" corrections, but on mobile it can be really annoying, especially with the long hold-menu delay.

you do have. but mobile remebers it for you.

 when you first started you had to put in a password

I make pixel art myself and I gotta say impressive stuff bro!

I'm pretty sure even saying 'Doubling money' or anything like that will get you automuted anyway so we don't need to.

Oh wow. I dropped my loot earlier and thought if I switched worlds it would despawn from my previous world. It would still only be on the ground in the world I dropped it in though, correct?
---
I get 0.05%
---
I would like something like this + a lot more open spaces on the map, similar to hunter areas. OSRS must have one of the most crowded world maps of any RPG. This would be a good excuse to add some more open spaces. Also, OP, don't get dispirited if this post isn't heavily up-voted. I consider this a first draft of an even bigger and better follow-up post.

that's your fault for trying to attack other players my man. Only bring to the wilderness what you're willing to lose. You attacked someone else knowing there'd be a chance you'd get skulled. Poor choice. Better luck next time

You‚Äôd actually need the APR in this case, since we are withdrawing interest, which is only 1.98%. The 2.0% number is the APY. You‚Äôd actually need a little more than $6692.

If you have 500 points, you get 2 rewards. If you have 1000 points, you get 3. 750 points is a 50/50 shot at 2 or 3 rewards.

Obviously they were about to by a tbow for 250 mil but it could only be done on a pvp high risk world. OP got jebaited somehow by the trade person running out of the GE into the area around it, weird I know. THEN a perfect combat level ahole appeared out of seemingly nowhere and barrage dclawed him to death. It's just random you know, impossible to predict. OP still trying to buy that t-bow but the seller hasn't logged back in yet for safety reasons.

It's not as if the tool belt gives additional XP. It simply saves you walking to the bank to get your axe. The grind would stay the same length.

As others have said it's ezscape, it isn't hard for you as a player to remember if you need a tool to do something.  As for the gold pouch you already have a bank and don't need an extra inventory slot just to hold your gold.

I like the way you phrased this. It's not so much an empty mind that's important, but not being judgemental about your thoughts.
---
If you tried to be ignorant of thought, you'd fail 98.5% guaranteed. What you can practice with meditation and actively being positive is allowing thoughts to pass by as if they were clouds.

Let me retell a story. Eckhart Tolle had a story that was probably from his book Power of Now where a girl blamed a monk for knocking her up. He replied "whatever", everyone hated him, and they had him raise the child. A few years later, she admitted that it was actually Chad who knocked her up and they all apologized and took the baby back. He said "whatever" again. By not reacting the baby got it's best possible outcome and grew up to be Mod Ash.
---
TL;DR: thinking is inevitable, but reaction is exp waste

for any one wondering yo ucan do way better things with 7 grand and get way better % then 2%, 2% is just keeping up with inflation so you arent really "earning" anything.

If you‚Äôre talking about the account you used before osrs was released that still exists on rs3. Everyone has to start fresh on osrs

Hey, since I'll be able to see everyone else vote yes, I'll vote yes too. Just not my thing.

Not who sees it, but who actually gets it. Typically if one person gets one item, they are able to get the majority - this indicates that the game favors pid when items are being picked up.

Probably getting ~85+ Strength on my Obby Mauler along with trying Fire Cape. On my Def Pure I want to get to 75 HP 70 Def after getting 40 combat for Pest Control, along with getting my first 99 in Hunter. And on my new 20 Def Pure I want to be fully quested, get to Slayer bossing, and learn pking.
---
Where is that?
---
Ahh my bad
---
Get 75 for blowpipe and it‚Äôs easy Peezy japanezy
---
If you're going for 75 attack I would recommend staying 42 defence with 44 prayer so you can keep a lower combat. Also 85 strength is perfect.
---
lucky

arent u scared u could get banned any moment even after ur done lol

Oh no... It's retarded.

It may be a reboot from 2007 but it‚Äôs hardly frozen in the past. There‚Äôs tonnns of new things that never existed in 07 that have been slowly added to the game since it relaunched

Dont bank iron if you decide to mine it, its a waste of time. Power mine iron to 75 then do blast mine for around 100m+ profit to 99. Or do mlm all the way for a lot more profit but slower xp. Its really if u want quick xp or slow with the benefits such as coal bag, and pros outfit

Myths guild after dragon slayer 2 
---
I presume OP wants steam to just launch the client, meaning it tracks how long the osrs client is open, and when you launch from steam it doesn‚Äôt autolog you in. 
---
Jagex would have to pay for it, and considering they can't hire 1 employee for proper customer support for a game with 600,000 actively subscribed accounts I doubt they would do this. 
---
But yes also looking for work btw. 
---
I believe you mean Y35
---
Actually it was OP who did a lot of the work required for the wiki. Thank him instead!
---
You pay for the opportunity cost of investment though.

Don't jerk it

I'm closing in on 2k total which means I should start knocking out some elite diaries for rc xp. Any tips for the upcoming barb assault guide? Beyond 3 torsos over the years I don't have much experience and I struggle a bit with defender.
---
First tip would to have an authenticator on email/ RS account
---
Okay this is actually pretty nice. I liked it. Thanks.
---
Wdym?
---
Oh nice, thanks /u/Scuzzy_Beta!
---
Negative interest is common here nowadays.
---
Each account has separate trade limits per 4 hours, yes. 
---
Lmao! Hey!
---
Osb prices and then try to predict general trends. 
---
Max cape 
---
It's all the skill capes in one
---
I've used it for a long time. I can't go into the wild without it anymore. The owner seems like a nice dude. He is in a pure clan or was and thats what scares people. No one has ever been hacked or banned because of the client.
---
Wow fucking rip me man bought it at legit 169.
---
Okay but that's completely different. No one is harassing the osrs devs by posting a question on reddit. You're over reacting. I haven't seen anyone giving the devs shit over this. Just because a question is asked more than once by different people, doesn't make it harassment. The term harassment gets thrown around so easily nowadays.
---
Ok pepe . I‚Äôve tried stretch mode. I‚Äôve tried doing custom windows size. I‚Äôve tried low detail with and without stretched mode. I‚Äôve tried many more things and I thought I could ask a community that‚Äôs for the game for some help because I couldn‚Äôt find any help. So since you know the answer .. what is it Pepe? 
---
Sucks
---
Ok thanks 
---
Thank you!
---
Me too. Bought at 170 thinking it was a great deal.
---
They just don't make games like they used to
---
So sad of you
---
H
---
Ah ya. Prob not good idea to bring that many laws in pvp hah 
---
Eh as long as we keep killing vorkath we should be okay
---
Lol just hold it and don‚Äôt worry about the price
---
I‚Äôll break his legs...
---
At the moment all the pricechanges are basically just merchers trying to merch other merchers.
---
Happens with every pvm item before every new pvm update. Its just more noticeable with lower volume items.
---
wow this pic is so hd
---
Well, from a quick google search it seems like [average inflation in the US over the last 60 years has been 3,7%](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/average-inflation-rate/)
---
And since you're getting less than that from your savings account you're already losing to inflation without using your intrests to pay for membership, and you lose even more by using them to pay membership.
---
So you just think you're not paying for it, or even profiting by it.

I thought I‚Äôd give you all an update... All the feathers sold on the GE for 3 gp each!:)

The main purpose of this thread was to see if I could help anyone out so they wouldn‚Äôt have to go through the GE buy limit. 
---
Wow, pretty cool someone is viewbotting an anti-scam warning.
---
You're supposed to lead them into the wild you silly billy! 
---
Because if you click on someone thats too far from your attack distance your character should run towards him. Thats how the mechanics work and Its something that could be avoided by just learning your attack distance
---
My brother let me see if I can help you out, Pking stands for Player Killing that happens usually in the wilderness. The best way to acquire better weaponry is usually buy buying them of off the grand exchange. The players who are buying and selling determine the price of an item, most items have a buy limit for example say you want to buy a bunch of air runes to train magic, you could only buy a certain amount every 4 hours. Good money makers usually comes from PVM which stands for Players vs Monsters. Buying n selling in ge is pretty simple too whoever has the highest offer usually gets the item. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much you buy depends on how much you‚Äôre willing to spend :) Gl hope I answered some questions! 
---
What fucking 1 week trial I wish I knew about this before I fished all of those lobsters/swordfish to get my bond.. 
---
What's that item next to the rune pouch?
---
* PKing is Player Killing. Basically pvp.
---
* Buying them is fastest. How you get them depends on the item. Most of the time it's monster drops. Better weapons increase max and accuracy. Generally speaking attack speed &gt; max hit &gt; accuracy, so Scimitars are generally the best for melee.
---
* What people are willing to pay for it.
---
* Cows, hill giants, telegrabbing wines of zamorak.
---
* GE price, I believe.
---
* I believe it sells to the highest buyer. If you sell 10 it'll sell them 1 at a time.

I unlocked and put off jad til i got task. You can go one step further and kill terror dogs for range pots but I was too lazy to do haunted mine.
---
Pass it forward! :)

Same. Never done anything like this, but figured why the heck not. Definitely worth the time investment.

i made like 500 of these in preparation for the ice demon in raids but little did I know they are garbage =/

Thank you sir!

Holy shit those runes
---
The real doubling scam is actually reverse psychology. 
---
Everyone, even noobs, know that doubling isn't real. 
---
But some people still want to experiment and see if they can beat the scammer at their own game in some way (spoiler: you can't).
---
They might just 'test' the doubler in increasing increments, just for 'fun', and end up loosing a small amount. But often times the doubling is the start of a larger scam, just to find targets who they can lure. 
---
If your interested my irons name is pawn exile I think I got 3 range levels since.
---
Western Province Diary banner? 
---
But if you got a hydra task, wouldnt that cover everything?
---
Can confirm.
---
Yea but that is if the first 4 trials result in a gem... to get 4 consecutive out of how many ores you‚Äôve mined is a lot higher chance... still pretty rare tho
---
Shut up Serene 
---
Ay do what makes you happy man. You seem to be taking it pretty well. Stay strong, brother. 
---
Needing brews doesnt mean you're shit. It probably means you're low stats, or have non top tier gear. Depending on the spawns its not possible to flick everything when the all 3 styles spawn, and depending where it can be very time consuming trying to trap a ranger or mage. When both range/mage are hitting you simultaneously you can't flick. And if youre low stats then the ranger could do some damage. I didnt flick any of it with low stats and I was 70 range/rune cbow with 60 def. Only issue i had was usually low amount of restores, but had good amount of brews usually. Just takes so long. Got 75 range and did it with blowpipe, game changer and I ended up getting first cape with only using 3 brews. So yeah. Your TTK (time to kill) matters.

Thanks! Worked perfectly

Lava drags is a really popular clanning spot, teams hopping round with 20+ people will kill anyone in case you're risking something or scouting for another clan.

Oldschool Runescape has a centralized place for trading all items called the Grand exchange. You can automatically sell and but any item you want there.
---
It is located just north east of Varrock. [Here it is on a map](https://i.imgur.com/eb029r8.png)
---
And [here is the wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange) page about the place. 
---
The grand exchange located northwest of varrock. You can either list your items for one coin, resulting in receiving the highest available price at the time, or you could determine a price and be patient.
---
Time to make archon only ironman and mke 10min video me staying in Lumbridge waiting for mans come closer
---
Or maybe they're looking for other pkers and you happen to be there. Why would a team be needed for someone who isn't fighting back.
---
Either chuck them on the GE or just drop (assuming you‚Äôre crafting steel or below). If you‚Äôre f2p and trying to make money you probably want to just sell the bars. If you‚Äôre p2p I‚Äôd spend some time looking at the OSRS wiki for money making guides. 
---
Fools.
---
That said, at some point in time iirc before eoc it was believable because of rumor about an exploit, that literally doubles money (and it turned out to be true after some time, I think it involved duel arena in someway)

Basically run to the trap asap, drop a few correct food one square north of the trap. Drop a couple correct food in the trail area marked in the video, then drop the rest of your correct food at the mainstack. Grab logs and hammer and run back to the trap and stand on the food to pile runners. Wait until the runners stack up then walk onto the trap, spam repairing
---
1,3, and 4 are the ones that apply the most
---
I mean it sounds like OP probably isn't super experienced at fight caves.  Neither am I.  Not to mention he's an Ironman and probably doesn't have the most optimal gear like dhide/ranger boots and Archer ring.  No need for egotistical and degrading comments
---
There should be a mage equivalent, but no idea what should it be....perhaps saradomin strike? i dunno.
---
Was keeping it secret but i wrote it on another post, got lucky off med clues from my wildy slayer tasks. Got rangers. I also have archer ring/b ring/blowpipe, tho i spent s lot of money cannoning and spent a bit on supplies during fight caves. Have a shit load of addy darts and scales in my blowpipe. Im a bit low on cash now though so may sell that and archers.  
---
Only bond I bought was for membership. 
---
Just slayer. I even had Chins from Hunter aswell which I used so I really don‚Äôt use range. 
---
I love it when people are nice while pking me. Made a good friend last time 
---
I felt like that for so long üòÇ. You‚Äôll get there. 
---
Can't wait to see people camp outside of fight caves begging for an obby cape.
---
Then you‚Äôll earn 1/4 of that just for 1 gargoyle task once you get 75 slayer! It‚Äôs crazy how much it speeds up gp/hr at 75. Although dust devils and kurasks also give good gp, but it looks like form your loot you didn‚Äôt do those?
---
i think boosting their base stats should help a bit. 
---
Would love to see a written guide based on what you did with them!! I bet a lot of people would. 
---
It's a 1/100 drop rate so it should normally take like an hour at most.  It sounds like you're just unlucky.... Keep grinding, good luck!

Closer to 3.5B , and many long time players have at least max cash. These new accounts on osrs with money are not strange in the slightest . Sorry your poor bb

What legitimate streamers would be affected by this besides maybe like 9 year olds who want to stream fortnite to 2 of their friends

I relate to this one the most.

If so, what kind of format would you want it in? Another thing is, it doesn't really matter what you do as long as you do something :)
---
Due to the game engine, a monster couldn't have more  than 255 hp. Ket zek has 160 so it couldn't be doubled, so Jads health was capped to 255. Combat levels weren't set manually, they were set like players using the monsters stats. So jads combat level suffered as a result of a capped hp.

Probably not for a long time. Grandmaster quests will probably have high 70 stats and maybe we'll get an 80+ req for something basic like cooking but I don't think we'll see runecrafting or agility etc for years and years, if ever. Don't think there will be any 90 reqs for yeeears either

no, it still happens today and that's because people get phished and give away their password, auth code, and bank pin.

Well, bank pin's do help because no matter what if the hacker needs to get to your bank they have to wait a few days so you have more than enough time to recover it then.

It's either this or telling them you are vegan.

You were hacked and it was stolen. They're gone for good with 0 chance of recovery

From Lvl 58-84 I spent mining iron rock with Varrock Armour. From 84 until I reach level 99, I am spending my time on MLM. The profit increases because of being able to get runite ore at 85. I was also burnt out from constantly mining iron rock because I have to be very focus. You get more profit in MLM compared to mining iron rock at the guild. 
---
At MLM, I first unlocked the upper floor because I hate how the bottom floor is random. I have to constantly check my screen to check if I'm mining pay-dirt. The upper floor is time-based from the moment you first start mining the pay-dirt. Then I unlocked the outfit just for the XP boost. After, I unlocked the gem bag. I keep the gems because it is extra profit. I always keep the gem bag in my inventory, which is very convenient for me and less bank trips. Then I increased the sack which make it even more AFK. Finally I unlocked the coal bag.
---
I am currently Lvl 92 and will be staying at the MLM until 99. Good Luck.

The community in general is toxic lol.
---
Also those people you're pking have probably been pked several times by toxic players, and are taking it out on you. If people kept slapping you on the head and telling you to sit down irl you're probably still gonna be annoyed at the last guy who slapped you on the head even if he didn't tell you to sit.
---
I kill people and take their stuff in the wildy. I see these people getting mad. Are they toxic? Thoughts?

The rant about MTX is mostly inaccurate tbh. KI gets a lot of (deserved) hate for putting pack releases above content releases, but looking at best in slot gear for max level, only the boots are bought with crowns. Hat and robes are Mali or exalted dungeons. Ring and athame are from darkmoor. Deck is paradox. Amulet is arguable between rasputin, darkmoor, and morganthe, but all the contenders are farmable. Only the purrzian boots/givehs/galesh are crowns only, and the mali boots are a perfectly viable alternative for those who don‚Äôt want to buy ghulture packs.
---
The crafted wands actually are better than the pack wands for the first time in years. That‚Äôs probably a controversial opinion given how long crowns wands have been dominant, but hear me out. The revered wands have excellent stats, with the second highest damage on a wand behind paradox, armor piercing equal to or greater than pack wands, two square slots, high pip conversion, and a bit of energy and fishing luck as a nice non-combat bonus. The pack wands are superior in only one respect: critical/block. In PvP, critical and block are no longer relevant, so revered wands are the obvious choice there. PvE is a bit of a toss up. I personally don‚Äôt bother with critical anymore because level scaling has destroyed my critical %, even with a pack wand. If you run a critical-dependent build though, you‚Äôre obviously going to need to buy some packs.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I wish KI would lay off the crowns as much as the next guys. I would love if they would put more of that development time into reworking some of the other areas in wizard city or making a new max-level dungeon, but I think we should be honest about the extent of the problem. You can absolutely get a high-level set of gear with great stats without spending a single crown, and revered wands have made crafting useful again for the first time since Khrysalis. I think we should encourage that kind of progress. Rant over.
---
I grinded out 70 range to get my fire cape and honestly dagganoths (the smaller ones under light house) are fantastic exp. You'll have to spend a little on cannon + pray pots but you can bring noted pots and food also and sell them upstairs/buy back to unnote. I was getting like 150k/hr and they drop good seeds frequently. 
---
You may not break even but You'll make a good bit back from it. And the exp is so fast. Just wear your highest range gear + pray bonus (i wore zammy book, a blessing, and crossbow) then just keep auto retaliate on and keep filling your cannon/check prayer (I prayed melee. If youre high enough defense it's possible to just wear tank legs and helm with a shield and wont need prayer, just lobsters or some food). 
---
Fastest exp at that level imo. I got really good exp doing it. 
---
Yep.

Except for those really aren't that easy to get

The funny thing is that if Jagex made it to where you couldn't get hacked so fucking easily these streams wouldn't exist. There's a reason hackers focus runescape players... they're the least protected because the security system is absolute shit and they have no customer service call center / game admins to fix problems.

anyone know how many brutal arrows I'd need for 1,000 chompy bird kills, roughly? to finish the western hard diary

You can thank /u/jaydenkieran for the automatic dark mode :)

But wouldn't profit be next to non-existent for each team member as you have to split the loot very thinly? And what if the pvmer is in a single way combat zone? The other teammates would not be helpful and you still need to split with them.
---
Very nice work
---
There's a neat number you can call.  But you gotta tie a rope around your ceiling fan on one end and your neck around the other before you dial.  Turn fan on for best results.
---
I‚Äôve heard good things about Astrals! Good money too still I think. 
---
I mean you could just click the track on your music player 
---
Also call people "adult" instead of "kid" since a lot of us have grown into big bois since we started playing
---
Some bossing content is easy on mobile (bandos is really easy for me.) while vork and zulrah prove very difficult for me. Skilling is easy while 3 ticking (for me) is impossible. 
---
Other then that, there‚Äôs certain things that I don‚Äôt like to do on mobile simply because like wilderness slayer, i miss tapped on seed pod the other day and got killed lol, and I prefer runelite because loot tracking and drop notifications.

If the pkers main pvp goal is to pk other pkers, why would they deliberately go to hotspots that will have more pvmers or skillers present than pkers, and yet still pk the former two? Why not go to places where they are more pkers by default, like pvp worlds, edgeville ledge, or BH worlds?

Thieving is the fastest on average. But just a heads up the average xp for most skilling pets is well over what it takes to get 99. If you want to commit and go for it then by all means do it but just wanted to let you know what you‚Äôre getting in to 
---
I am a complete noob, recently (mobile release) returned to the game after many years of not playing.  But ever since I learned about the Kebos update, I've been rushing slayer like an absolute fiend and it's starting to look like I'm actually going to hit the 95 in time.  The trouble is, I still have no idea what the hell I'm doing in the game; pretty much ALL I've done is slayer, since that was the only way I was ever going to hit this goal.  And not even boss type slayer either, it's all been either XP slayer (cannon/bursting) or afk slayer (gargs/abbys).  
---
Can any more experience player tell me what kind of gear and/or supplies we are likely going to need for the hydra boss?
---
Statistically not scamming their risk, but w a very low probability you can kill them when u play to risk to get a kill
---
Ehhh apart from the loot glitch system that isn't really scamming. 
---
Are you dumb or what lol? Safing isn't scamming
---
Same! Never clicked a link, just logged in one day and my alert email had changed. They got off with 900k and my full rune but even doing a regular sweep with a 30 minute gap they got in
---

Are you serious?
---
How bout you reveal the 1m you owe me first
---
There no need to invest a lot of the money into seeds. Go ahead and buy 20 ranarr seeds and look up a farm run guide. Make sure you are using magic secateurs. You always profit from farm runs so you can just sell the ranarrs and buy back more seeds when you run out.
---
As for flipping, there‚Äôs some guides on YouTube but I‚Äôve never watched them. I was very hesitant to start flipping too, but then I starting flipping items which are tied to alch value. If you buy an tune or dragon item for ~400 less than it‚Äôs alch value then it‚Äôs impossible to lose money. Worst case scenario you alch it for a small profit.  
---
It lags a little when the vid starts, if you rewind it you can see him press it.
---
hey that hurts
---
But how is killing players who can't fight back fun? You know you will win nearly all the time. They might just as well fight goblins. The most fun I had with pvp is with other pkers because I never know what to expect from them or who would actually win or not. And world hopping for pvmers or skillers to pk for is pretty boring as well. I rather go to a spot where I know there will be pkers and have fun right away instead of relying on good luck to find someone to pk in deep wildy.
---
Why don't you just buy it? Idot!
---
&gt;Eating to 95 HP/Safing mostly, but some of them are still abusing the loot glitch's as well. The people who safe, they only die to max hits, when most of us play rng vs rng, they abuse the eating system
---
10/10 for effort
---
Doesn't change that Jagex has been "looking into further security measures" for 5 years. Nothing introduced ever since they mentioned it.
---
The only fireworks I need in my life :)

You most likely got report botted and an auto-mute on their end triggered.  It's highly unlikely a JMod would be rigging fights right in front of people.

---
Why not have both? 2000iq.p
---
people have gotten extremely good at pvp, abusing teas/pizzas/karams/brews etc to pretty much never risk hp isn't scamming, its just smart risk fighting. if you care about profit you shouldnt give your opponent an opportunity to kill you unless you are also getting a shot to kill them at the same time. In which case you can risk while still having better odds of coming out ahead.

I'd suggest looking up the Optimal Quest guide and just progress through every quest in an efficient order. There's a few I've done out of order such as The Priest in Peril quest as I was farming the Graceful set and needed access to the Canafis agility course.

It‚Äôd be nice if you gave any proof instead of just talking about nothing in your 25min video. Cut it down or write it down and actually provide shit. You‚Äôre ‚Äúundoxxable‚Äù but you‚Äôre pandering like a bitch for attention. Thanks for wasting my fucking time.

Good luck! If you have any other questions or run into other problems, let me know! One other helpful thing to note is that the corner of the cave with the entrance does not spawn any monsters. This can be useful for blocking a few of the monsters in the late waves.
---
Loot glitching is cheaty, but it turns out that the optimal way to riskfight is to never die and fish for 1% chances. Nothing wrong with that

Post your evidence in something other than a 30 minute video. Screenshots would be good. I jumped to the 'discord convo proof' you listed in your description and it was just more of you rambling.

Frankly, it seems like your just pissed you loss something valuable. Even more so considering your reaction to any critique. Calling safing scamming? Really?

Stylistically this looks great, but The Logo/UI covers 3/4 hydra heads and 90% of the Tzhaar guy.
---
Did these scammers ever say "yea I won't safe, I promise!" or any variation thereof? Just because they pk in a different way than you do, doesn't mean they're scamming at all.
---
Welcome home! Jagex has been pretty good about keeping us un-spoiled, we don't know much yet. If it hasn't been heavily changed between the teaser and now, go in with a stamina (dodging lightning) and all three combat styles (boss changes color between red/green/blue, we all know what those colors usually mean).
---
https://i.imgur.com/o3le9rx.jpg
---
Congratulations!
---
If the government (Jagex) orders a hospital or school (any pvm or skilling hotspot in wildy) or any spot where non-combatants are to be a killzone, would killing anyone there make the killer an asshole? 
---
It depends on whose perspective you take. You are not considered an asshole in the eyes of other pkers or Jagex because the former does it themselves and the latter allows it. But you are one in the eyes of pvmers or skillers because you still deliberately chose to attack players who do not want to pvp but must enter a pvp zone in order to access content that can't be done elsewhere. Jagex does not force pkers to pk everyone on sight in wildy. They just allowed them to, so they still have free will to choose to pk non-pvpers or not and yet they chose to. You may not be literally killing them, but you are still causing displeasure to them. So the difference is free will. If Jagex forces pkers to kill non-pvpers, then pkers aren't assholes. Jagex is. The wildy right now would make both the pkers who hunt the non-pvpers as well as Jagex themselves as assholes.

You both have similar names, i personally have 100 reddit accounts myself, and come from the RWT scene. My entire comment is about the discord who sells your fucking gold, but you're to braindead to realize it, 370 others do though, so i could give 2 shits less about you, or svantes opinion. I wanted my voice to be heard, and it is.

oof

Being a dick to everyone calling you out is not helping your case man...

yes and yes

2 people, is "multiple people" to you? Sound's like me 3 days ago. 370 other people see otherwise.
---
That just seems smart. Why doesn't everyone do that?

When did i ask to be unmuted?

Did you just reply to yourself and call yourself stupid?

Man, what a trainwreck.

Yep, thought this would be some juicy drama to start off 2019 but its really just the unhinged ranting of someone with 53 mutes on their account.
---
in fact i said several times here, and in the video, this isn't a request to be unmuted. Stop trying to cause shit and be a troll.

He's admiting that this is new levels of Pker stupidity.

I've only experienced it when doing things like wilderness bosses, or straight up money makers.

And it's always been teams that do this. Usually when I see someone and they try to 1v1 pk me both of us don't say a word through out the whole thing.

You probably got the 2nd one before you picked the first one up.

How did you make the GP?

No one said "unmute". You were implying that you were falsely muted by a Jmod (see: title of this post), and he's saying it wasn't a false mute.
---
how is this funny

You havent actually told us what they are doing wrong. All you have said is that they safe constantly in fights which has been in the game since rs classic and people just choose not to fight them.

Nah i don't really play often and I've never been hacked before because I'm careful and know not to click on dumb crap. This doesn't apply to certain other people though lol. I'm not upset I had no way to anticipate this and didn't really lose that much. I lost my void, magma mutagen (that one hurts). Imbued slayer helm and fire cape. And about 20m gold which isn't the end of the world. I also learned a valuable lesson. Don't lend your laptop to osrs players if you play osrs.

He claims to be a "social engineer". Well, he's certainly socially engineered me into thinking he's some deranged retard with a persecution complex. He's mentally damaged to the point where he blatantly harasses others and immediately assumes that there's this elaborate conspiracy to silence him. I also find it absurdly funny that he thinks Chris the fuck Archie is out to get him, and that they share some unacknowledged rivalry.

Woah dude chill. He clearly has a mental disorder and that's just awful to say to anyone
