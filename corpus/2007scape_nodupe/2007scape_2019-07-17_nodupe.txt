Agility is the dumbest skill in my opinion in terms of training. Fire-making, smithing, and thieving are all pretty fucking useless apart from diary requirements which is frustrating.

What.. lol

Ok

I didn’t bother fighting cause customer service suck there goes 11$ it was only a day ban

You’re so rude.  He misunderstood and you didn’t even try to act civil.  It’s not an attractive way to act.

Item sinks reduce deflation, not inflation, and OSRS is in deflation.
---
Train travel was invented by industrialists who wanted to make money so your point about airline companies is ridiculous. They weren’t invented as “public transportation.”
---
I’m not mad, just disappointed
---
You do realize that 1-99 is 99% filler in the form of low level armor and weapons, right? You listed everything the skill does in 1 sentence. How is that a "really wide skill?" The only skill more worthless is Firemaking, but you can at least level that quickly without investing 65m to do so.

---
&gt;Just release some content without consulting our shit playerbase once in awhile... It seemed to work pretty well until Eoc.
---

---
There were lots of bad updates before eoc. Even still you manage to encapsulate why its not a good idea. It works pretty well right until it doesn't and once it doesn't there's typically no going back.
---
I hated its introduction as a skill.
---
As a mini game i wouldn't mind as long as i wasnt forced to do it for some BiS item or w/e
---
Lol I just realized DVS is gonna have to go back and re-max his two other ironmen
---
Is this just Photoshop? Or is there a tool for this?
---
In what world is a new skill not a large amount of new gameplay
---
remindme! 2 hours
---
So what? Any new content can break balance. What matters is it is quickly corrected.
---
Jagex is already balancing content around Tbow. So how is balancing around new content bad?
---
Haha, I love it XD
---
And yet they quickly became one of the best forms of public transit, in some countries. There's a good reason we don't use them in the USA. Airline companies managed to lobby any development of them into the ground while also creating a bad public image of them as a "poor man's transportation".

---
are rangers going back up?
---
I think it would have been good if wards were created from fires by use of a lamp. Firemaking could have a lot of potential that way.
---
Lol I still want new things to come from osrs it becoming its own game no rs3. It has to change to survive other wise what would I do when I reach max go pk? That’s dead content.
---
\&gt;Should we vote to remove Firemaking because its a shitty skill which is not up to our standards?  
---
...yeah
---
The game you grew up loving is built on content that wasn't polled lol. Most of the skills we have. Most of the map. Almost everything.
---
Why home? Get it on mobile man!
---
I'm still waiting to hear any sort of reasoning to be opposed to any new skills.
---
I didn’t say you were? Do you just assume what people mean or do you read their comments and genuinely not understand arguments?
---
[removed]
---
None of the buffs are helpful for botters, especially when requiring 85 of the artisan skills and costs extra 400 gp every time it activates, but it's cool, convenient and a nice flex for real players.
---
This was taken a while ago.
---
Yeah rs3 rates are easily 1m+/hr with the best methods
---
I think a really good example of this  is the difference between d'hide and blessed d'hide. we can make d'hide. but we can get better d'hide from something else. Right now other than xercian, we can't make any good magic robes. everything is buyable. So why not allow us to make some better robes, more easily.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Condense the skill properly while we're at it. Put the boots and stave making in warding as well. It makes more sense.
---
Say goodbye to your account
---
Brought to you by Twitch(tm) Prime(tm)
---
I don't like this
---
RuneScape has always been like that.
---
I think you have it backwards. I think future Elemental Workshop quests should use Warding, not that Warding should require the Elemental Workshop quests.
---
Those gathering skills are tied to a production skill.
---
Mining provides ores for smithing.
---
Woodcutting provides logs for fletching (firemaking being a way to remove the logs too, we all know that's the most useless skill design in the game)
---
Fishing provides raw fish for cooking.
---
Then we have crafting that utilises some of mining, and hides from monsters. Hunter ties in as the gathering skill for this relatively well as well, but hunter is kind of its own thing as it was introduced later.
---
Warding is being proposed as the production skill for mage robes, but what gathering skill does it have? Warding... Or hunter? Or farming? Idk they can't seem to decide there. It's where its odd where it is. It's essentially an identical skill to crafting in practice... But where you use magic to afk and gather resources... Or you can use warding to quickly gather resources at a cost..
---
See the confusion and weird design issues? Warding is a production skill that is essentially magic crafting, but it's also its own gathering skill. It would be like if for crafting you went and afk'd range to gather thread. Or for smithing you had to afk firemaking to turn ores to bars for use in smithing. It's a weird gameplay decision that is the only thing differentiating warding from crafting.
---
Without that concept, and with a regular "tool and gathering skill" warding would be "use this resource from gathering skill and craft it into magic robes". Which crafting already does for Xerician and could easily do for other robes if we wanted a way to craft them 
---
That's why it's a reskin, and one with confusing design decisions and a massive identity crisis imo. And after all that it doesn't even change the game, the only changes it makes are flat buffs to existing content that could be brought in anyway, and mid level mage gear changes. Other than that it will just be a buyable / afk'able bank standing magic crafting to get a skillcape and forget the skill after that.
---
This is very good. Let's make this happen. Step 1: pass warding.
---
Not really, they still had to sit there in the dungeon for 20 minutes and are 80m short
---
[Yes](https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1102306828829057031)

ah, gotcha.. grats though brother

Lord shayne defender guide. There u go
---
You already have one on your bank if you're smart, why wouldn't it be there to log in too? :/
---
That’s the one where you gotta run around over and over right? I think they made it more manageable in like 2017
---
Jesus....
---
I think it's pretty accepted that range is currently, and has been for a while, the strongest 
---
combat skill with three of the most OP things in the game all being for range. Blowpipe, twisted bow, Rigour.
---
This definetely took some time. To put it in perspective, during the 50-99 range grind 
---
[I was able to create a member Hardcore Ironman, die at total 2066](https://twitter.com/HCIM_Deaths/status/1124245879404355584) ,
---
create a new hardcore and get to close to 1600 total level.
---
The loot is pretty much all in my inv. Rune items were alched and I used most of the gold for addy arrows.
---
I also used up 30k death runes,5k chaos runes and around 50k mind runes, and dropped between 15-20k cosmics to my alt together with
---
iron, steel and mithril arrows which I didn't keep track of (probably around 100k arrows in total).
---
All of the mithril kites, earth and water runes and limpwurt roots were just dropped, I also cut all the 
---
gems I got and dropped them as well. 
---
I got from 70 to 75 crafting just cutting gems they drop, and also from around 43 prayer to 68 burying big bones. 
---
Lastly, I also used an Earth Tiara instead of a Coif because Coif looks awful.
---
Gz on 200k
---
\&gt; Is superior adamant better than regular rune? If so it doesn't make sense.   
---
The bonus stats don't have to be directly related to melee combat. Maybe one bonus is the negative bonuses are reduced, or the armor is lighter, or it could just be something lazy like a prayer bonus. That way, improved adamant will never be better than normal rune with it's primary purpose.
---
Yeh it's not even really the tool, like a hammer is a tool or a knife is. We still use the lamp as our "tool" to harness the magic. The ward is simply the production station.
---
Even though this is /r/2007scape and I've never played nay of the Elder Scrolls games I still half expected the Skyrim meme when the screen went black.
---
Because some people think that any change what so ever to osrs will be bad for the game. I understand their point of view because rs3 but it gotten to the point where they complain about it because "it's not osrs". I'm not saying we should blindly accept changes to the game but some changes are helpful are in some cases needed. Personally I'm all for adding content to the game, the problem is that they have to add something new but not something that will heavily affect late game shit but also wont be "dead content" atleast that's how this sub acts on new content.
---
No ty, next.
---
You are welcome son.
---
Make ta bank with two bankers side by side. A red and blue. Tedious but not too bad. Or maybe a bank for quest items over to the side?
---
This is actually one of the things that kinda drove me away from rs some. I dont play much anymore and a big part of that is my realization that most non-combat skills have no end-game. fishing and cooking can make decent money, but in most other skills you are better off grinding mobs for the drops that you would be making. Do you grind mining up to 70 and compete over the rune ore, after grinding smithing up to 85+ and then barely make any money on your rune items, or do you go kill mid-level monsters and make a lot more money for the effort, even getting the benefit of being able to safely alch most of the drops because of how much higher the profit margin is? 
---
TL:DR I feel like the classic crafting skills could use a rework to make them relevant to pvming.
---
Hahaha, so far I do not. But now I will be looking out for them.
---
Nice achievement man that’s nuts!! Gratz. True gamer
---
what a shit reason to vote yes
---
Or log on Rs3.
---
spend 3.5m a day ? dumb decision. just don't post incriminating info online and/or just use a different username from anything related to your public profiles
---
You're maybe spending too much time unconsciously at those efficient places too. I come across full dragon equipping warriors all over the place just wandering around ahha. Mobile definitely helped an influx of returning and newer players who weren't as experienced or caring to be efficient.
---
Hol up. This is cool but how did you get 70 crafting f2p?
---
You were literally arguing that they shouldn’t vote no just because they didn’t want a new skill. I didn’t say you were saying they can’t vote no. I was saying that you shouldn’t force people to have to let content into the game that they don’t want.
---
Ok few problems with the stuff. 
---
1. Nightmare zone isn't dead is the sad thing. It is actually the best way to get melee xp in the game. And is profitable at that and no other skill has the fastest xp be the most profitable way to get there aside from melee. The devs agreed awhile back that nightmare zone was a mistake and that it is the one content they would remove if they could. It doesn't need to be revived as they are actively trying to kill it with the removal of most of its rewards.
---
2. Castle wars is not dead you have a thriving competitive community. Yes a activity bar would be nice to have.
---
3. Soul wars would need a massive revamp of its rewards as the xp from it was stupidly high. FoG sure I'm game as the shields are interesting for PvP. Stealing Creation no sacred clay rewards try again IMO.
---
U really should choose a handle that cant be traced back to your name at the very least
---
So what youre saying is we need new ranging gear?
---
Nice
---
This would be great location, super close to a bank too. New warding got me hyped
---
This better be on the calendar or riot
---
&gt;compare "dead"games
---
ahh, right where we don't want to be lumped in.
---
The Hosidius revamp shows that it’s possible for them to eventually fix all of Kourend, though. I have faith that in due time we’ll see the rest of the map look great.
---
Lol this is great
---
Binging with Babish makes it.
---
Is autoclicking considered a low level offense that jagex pretty much ignores or is a simple autoclicker not something their antibot picks up?
---
Depends on the set. Guthans is better on females but Dharoks is definitely better on males.
---
You do if you want some rng!
---
you have to be joking if ur asking for more
---
i dmed you
---
Same.
---
Idk anymore I can say, you are always killing something different per task and i like that variety. Im not sure how you find it lacking in that department
---
Probably so everyone could bitch about them and then the dev team removes it making everyone happy and less likely to say no to reasonable content additions (basically, always add something stupid/ridiculous/wrong to your presentation so the decision makers feel like they did something when you remove it)
---
Room temp iq locked ironman btw
---
I like C the most. We all have our opinions though. Good job.
---
Because they could easily criticize the art without making it personal, but they do.
---
Chicken, egg
---
Thieving, Hunter and Agility are three of the most appalling skills to train, and none feel all that rewarding. The only rewards that stand out to me is Dragon implings in hunter and Graceful from agility. No-one enjoys levelling these skills, would you have them removed from the game because they aren't "fun" or "rewarding"
---
The fact that I copy and pasted the same reply shows how little I care about you and all the other little brains out there. And the title doesn't imply that at all you inbred.
---
They shoulda said “prepare to squirm like a worm”
---
Nah lol for my wrist
---
I'd rather vote no and give feedback to tweak it before introducing it. Why start bad and hope it improves when existing skills are testament to that most likely not happening
---
Dude can you be my DM holy crap!
---
Ya I mention it in the little blurb at the end, that I like how Bloodbark and Astral fill that gap by a little.
---
Ok well i'm not really against new skills in general but here it goes. 
---
The game is great as it is. There is no need for huge changes like this. They already add tons of new content, especially lately. There is already 1000's of hours of game play in this game. Do we really need another skill? Everything in Warding could be put in to other skills,
---
That's the argument. If you don't agree fine. but it's not invalid just because you say it is.
---
What content? Magic robes? We've had them added already. Does warding change that?
---
The rest are ["Here We Are"](https://youtu.be/y49b8aiQVBg) from UNDERTALE for Fareed, ["Chaos King"](https://youtu.be/BlfSQKSkXo8) from DELTARUNE for Damis phase 1 and Phase 2, you nerd, is ["Phase 2"](https://youtu.be/pIKAxdzVesw), from [a fan-made animation](https://youtu.be/VC-yGc8WQfc) if Papyrus was the final boss of Undertale instead of Sans.
---
it hasnt even passed yet lol talk about counting your chicks before they hatch
---
I'd rather this than pandering fot little kids that little kids don't even like
---
Cartoons back then had so many jokes for the adults that had to sit through the shows. Makes em hold up well to today.
---
I personally would like runecrafting to NEVER be updated so that it remains a prestigious skill that's a painful grind to 99
---
It actually depresses me how much time some people have on their hands
---
Thanks.
---
Unrelated but is it me or is her audio kinda borked?
---
First
---
That’s what I always say. You literally weren’t there. Nobody was. That’s why I took the world. Because...nobody was there....
---
you won't be disappointed in this method.
---
What makes skills so compulsory to you? are you trying to max an account or something? I've, to this day, leveled hunter for 45 minutes. I dont even remember why i did it, but i do know that i didnt HAVE to. I would say that quests are just as compulsory as skills as there are large blocks of content locked behind quests in similar ways that skills lock content. 
---
Also i'd be willing to bet good money that almost all, if not all, end-game content (quests, pvm, pvp all of it) is taken into consideration when making future content.
---
This is fantastic. If you have any notes, quests etc you used and don't mind sharing - I would absolutely love. Always thought of doing a RuneScape DnD campaign
---
I love ash haha
---
Mostly the same as /u/Spazeyninja. I just don't want a new skill. Warding feels like a needlessly complicated skill that is created just for the sake of having a new skill if that makes sense? 
---
The other thing is that the skill doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I play OSRS because it's simple* and I can understand each skill. There's basically nothing complicated about the other skills - farming, Runecrafting or slayer might be the most complicated and they aren't hard concepts. 
---
??? Silks and VIS and dissolving/unpicking ???
---
Not interested.
---
against warding until smithing is made viable. sorry not sorry.
---
That being said, warding would be a cool implementation with runecrafting if it gave shit xp
---
Why does it matter how old the tweet is? I saw it once and it was on twitter and that was yesterday hahaha. I said I didn't know it was posted 2 weeks ago meaning that I didn't know it was posted to reddit already :))
---
It's ideas could branch amongst runecrafting, crafting and magic, with "dissolving" becoming an awesome base idea to implement on ALL production skills. Give benefits to having higher smithing, crafting, fletching etc. Not just one skill that does that because its "good for the economy" but really doesn't utilise it as a core mechanic / identity like invention.
---
Well done!
---
If you say so...
---
Wonder how many people have spent more on buying glories that the cost of an eternal one?
---
Actually doing all kraken tasks for the 10 tentacles. Small goal of mine and I’m at 6 rn.
---
What about "you accidentally burn the shrimps" yourself?
---
Masochism is a kink, and you shouldn't force it on others.
---
Only need 25.1% no votes.
---
Very true, I imagine it would be tough to find a reason to justify decomposing such high level gear, I hope this skill does have more to it than being a buyable
---
It doesn't have to be training methods. It's rewards for training the skill. Currently there are no reasons to train the skill for non ironmen aside from meeting quest and diary requirements, which are essentially arbitrary.
---
Raids 3 content. Raids 1 has a mage set, 2 has a melee set, 3 should have a ranged set. Desert themed T75 ranged set would be so fucking cool.
---
Shoutout to all the rich level 138s who gave me random money lol
---
I hate rc, and i unironically want it to stay that way.  I dont want the game to cater to me, if i ever get 99 rc i want to know that i bled for it
---
Adding a thing you can make with runecrafting does not mean it needs to be a training method.
---
Doesn't have to be
---
Imagine elemental robes that get enchanted at their respective altars
---
That doesn't look like any stream I've seen
---
Runecrafting currently infuses crystals to make bis boots my dude.
---
Magic is involved in that process as well, and the same would be done for rune pouch, essence pouch and/or imbues (I think they just belong in magic which you know... Has a spell called magic imbue)
---
The map would have more of an OSRS vibe going if it had squared off black edges instead of the soft, rounded fade to black (even if yours is nicer)
---
This is cool
---
Well yeah...
---
I like skills like slayer where requires you to be active and not just camp near the g.e till you hit 99.
---
I'm talking about the date in the screenshot, don't need to spend your life on reddit to see that you absolute babboon
---
Was making this map a part of that one hour map session?
---
nice, works in IT and has a potato at home :D
---
I dunno, if Ahrims top is +30 magic bonus and Soulpaek is +24, I bet PKers will still favor Ahrims even though it's got somewhat less defense. Are there any other factors besided the defense and non degrading component that I'm missing?
---
250k+ xphr is fast
---
Poor Torag sitting alone under the 1m cost for Barrows armor. I wish they would buff it, the twin hammers idea is great.
---
I know your joking but it actually is. The more you get into pking to more you see the flames as a language of love. 
---
Like sida fuk down kiddo. Ur whole family tree is trash. Back to lummy. I doxed ur nan. Your mums baler than yah dad etc. Etc. Its all love.
---
What's the point of this?
---
Well nobody is forced to train it
---
On Reddit anyone who doesnt suck women's toes constantly is considered an incel.
---
It’s the conservative mindset
---
Yes it does make sense. Runecrafting is a skill about infusing magical properties into stones... The infusing of crystals into boots is using your prowess in that skill to harness the magical properties of a stone (prim, peg, eternal) and infusing it with a piece of armour 
---
It uses magic to assist. That thematically makes perfect sense. Just as weaving fabric into robes and then infusing it with magic would make sense for crafting +runecrafting and/or magic
---
Theres a discord for this that use middle men to avoid scamming. 
---
Take caution to anyone before they go waste their time for someone in the promise of "making lots of money".
---
Bruh its pvmers and ironmen that watch pk vids that are saying its dying. Pkers dont say that l0l
---
Damn how didn't I think of this?
---
Sailing needed far more work to justify being a skill. I wanted it because it actually seemed exciting and interesting. But the work they put into the actual skill elements was lazy.
---
If you must do it on mobile, maybe look into getting a stylus?
---
FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMALE
---
nerf me
---
Do it on pc
---
But I would say that the prayers a little less responsive on mobile
---
Someone really because to nerf this kid before he goes into the wilderness
---
The plates definitely look like Ontario.
---
Jok
---
I think you misunderstand the concept of an MMO. Google some private servers
---
Panic buy gems
---
Yeah took me a few deaths to get the prayer switching down it definitely needs to be a lot faster on mobile. Don't have a PC right now keep getting the option for Jad as a slayer task and can't stop myself from accepting and trying.
---
Fuck it... nice.
---
Is there a program for making this
---
Meanwhile I’m 600k fucking xp dry of catching a big bass. Salty asf lol
---
PS4
---
Devalues my merchant guild only Ironman
---
Damn.
---
At least do a sling bikini style this time. I wanna see the sides of the boobs.
---
Red pilled dumbass redditors will come at me hard but to be 100% honest it is because she is a women.
---
Note guys: as you’re downvoting me you would all be less lonely and miserable if you had a healthy view of the opposite sex.
---
Hearing the sound effect in my head is proof of my PTSD. Send help

Found the white knight neckbeard I was talking about in my comment.
---
Someone’s bot broke? D:
---
how did u make this, is there a tileset? a generator?
---
Any news on that reaction?
---
B town is pretty much the wildy of the GTA tbh fam.
---
So you're saying if my skin color is the same as the cloth, it'll look like I have the smallest bikini top ever? I'm down
---
I mean I just explained why it thematically makes sense. That's what all this pro warding stuff is saying. Runecrafting as a skill is infusing magical properties into stones. Infusing crystals does not stray from this or magics identity. Infact it would make less sense in a skill like warding.

It was a joke though

U beautiful? Prove it son

yeah seriously i couldn't wrap my head around that sentence but now it makes a tiny bit of sense
---
If you're on a slayer task, have high enough range, use range pots, and use blowpipe you can probably out dps the healers.
---
What? Lol get 60 attack. Gmaul is busted and needs this fix. Obby mailers will be fine
---
70%???? That's about 65% too high
---
That's a divination spot, where diviners can infuse quartz shards with mystic energy to use for crafting magical weapons or armor(I'd like to say I thought of this idea 3 years ago when I made the Magicraft skill for my campaign lmao so I beat out Warding).
---
Spots of divination are places tied intrinsically to the fate and history of the world, usually places with lots of death or carnage associated to their name, like abandoned cities or war torn battlefields, or sometimes just temples where people were often attacked by monsters but had to keep coming back to maintain the shrine
---
Pussy
---
Do you mean a combined RC/warding training method? Is that mentioned in the blog post?
---
How about no. I will spend $100 to vote no on multiple accounts.
---
That's just a stylistic thing to make the map look more like Runescape
---
and the new dungeon? oh my god its amazing looking.
---
I put Dancing! A mixture of Osu and the dancing game from kingdom hearts 3. Idk how it would be useful but I've had a few beers tonight and it sounded cool.
---
torm first, not sure about the other 2 but I think heart next?
---
Dude you didnt understand. I was talking about raitos. Like ye 95% of the pker i meet flame but thats apart of pvp lol. So what you see ass "derogatory" lol is actually love and just banter. The kids telling me to kill myself because i attacked "their" hellhound. Lol toxic pvmtards.
---
... if theres a program to make OSRS style maps, I want to know. for reasons.
---
If the world would work like that I would be gayest motherfucker ever, I treat my homies right.
---
The campaign evolved around the players, it started out with them joining a holy order to fight demons and purify the demon infested world and ended with them making enemies of greater demons, tieflings, and even just humans and elves caught up in the civil conflict
---
Home tele of shame
---
Yeah but everyone just AFKs the wilderness safes for like 300k xp/hr for clicking three times every five minutes.
---
Are you looking for OSRS specific podcasts?
---
You should be King of Reddit.
---
I am 98 range. Been range potting right before I start jad. Didn't know this was possible. I can just ignore them completely?
---
yeah its a difficult situation for sure
---
the duel arena tax has taken a very large amount of gold out of the game however, which is nice.
---
its also the reason they wanna introduce warding. removing(dissolving) items is a great way to remove access from the game, and atleast extend the life of the game
---
thats what rs3 did with divination.

&gt; running around gathering equipment
---
Sure and firemaking is interesting because we run around and cut down all different trees in different areas to burn them. No, you'd buy the gear in bulk to dissolve. That's part of training it. Sure you could save some from slayer, but that's training slayer, and then training warding. 
---
&gt; Mid level players want content too
---
I'm not against this and never said I was. I'm against a skill being introduced that serves no role or purpose outside of explaining things and doing this. All of it's rewards and introductions are not required to be included with the skill. I like some of them and will vote yes on them despite not wanting the skill as a whole.
---
&gt; Don't see how it lacks any more depth than existing production skills
---
It shares an identity with crafting, magic and runecrafting while being shallow like other production skills. Therefore I'd rather see the ideas and effort put into expanding our already lacking skills.
---
The argument of "other skills are lacking so it's okay if we make a new one that's lacking too" is not a good precedent to stick by for new content. Why don't we use some of the exciting new concepts to bolster less exciting skills that already exist? Are you against that as a concept?

Did 65-92 at sorceress garden, and have to say that there is nothing more satisfying than turning in 5m worth of xp at once.

I mean. I like my bankstand skills. They're good good when I have a bus ride with spotty internet or I just want to shot around on cc and make a couple mils. Not all of us need everything to require prayer flicking and woox walk to be satisfying for some of us.
---
And bots taking up worlds doesn't effect you at all? On my ironman, mining gem rocks was absolutely miserable because of all the bots. You can't tell me you've never been impacted by a bunch of bots filling up worlds. Saying botting doesn't impact your gameplay is naive.
---
Whoa, people are happy when someone insulting them had something bad happen to them. Shocking.
---
In other news, water runes are wet.
---
Even past the idea of "if it passes you're voting on what passes with it" I think high yes votes on certain things will show the mods that even if the skill isn't wanted some of the ideas are good. Similar to sailing where a lot of the ideas came to be
---
Not sure what you’re getting at but my point is that people will be upset if better ways to train runecrafting are introduced (meaning faster xp rates or at least more tolerable) which I disagree with. I think Jagex should revitalize runecrafting despite the protests of people who already suffered through the current methods. Warding has the potential to be that revitalization.

People argued that dungeoneering should just be a minigame instead of a whole skill, which is frankly ridiculous given the far-reaching scale of dungeoneering.
---
Likewise, warding is a whole new class of magical crafting that is being proposed as a new skill, which we are overdue for. Sailing or artisan should have passed already, but now we're left with warding which isn't nearly as interesting but still good enough to me.
---
Ill definitely check it out when i hop on! My only problem is i usually play on my main that is muted and chat with my zerker that isnt muted. My zerker is only lvl 97 would that be okay? It has fire cape and b gloves!

Man isn't it weird how people are attracted to different things?
---
Am I the only one who likes warding? Just because it's old school doesn't mean it needs to be a carbon copy. Content in the spirit of osrs is the way to keep this game going.
---
Yes please, so irritating to have to go close the gate after everyone..
---
To add the new armors in with artisan would be a cool feature they can spice it up with, like needing slayer level for a monster you could need artisan to make certain robes, maybe this is just me hating warding tho idk man just brainstorming here lol
---
Because people voted no.
---
Name checks out
---
I've been playing Runescape a long time. I don't have a max cape, but even if I did, I'd welcome a new skill to the game I obviously love. Warding looks cool, and I'll vote yes.
---
At the same time, RS has a lot of dead content and quirky mechanics that could use some work. I'd prefer the dev team to focus on those aspects of the game before they go around creating brand new content.
---
Prolly because of the time/resources spent on it, i wouldnt be surprised if they rigged it not gunna lie
---
You should use a password manager, and third party clients allow you to paste in your password.
---
I don't see why it would have to adhere to what RS3 did with it in the slightest.
---
I don't believe it will be a successful sink people are claiming. It will bring some cheap treasure trail items out of the gutter. But not to any notable value, as once they're above the price of a steel plate body why would I not just use them? They're fixed on an alch price Afterall.
---
Wardings identity is better, but that identity essentially feels like a sub section of crafting with some "mystical voodoo" shoved to make it be more unique. It's just robe crafting with some tacked on rewards that don't feel like they belong (rune pouch and essence pouch being upgraded within warding? Why?)
---
I think it fits fine. But I think it's purpose is overstated. I see it as a bit of a boring bankstanding buyable that I'll spend some initial gp on, spend a week training, get 99 and then never touch it again. Similar to smithing and crafting as is.
---
Your brain literally doesn't work does it? I'm talking about people that are old as hell that grinded accounts back in original rs2 and were founding/core members of clanning back in the day. They've done the grind, their work got reset with OSRS, etc.

---
You cannot make a staff with crafting.  You attach an orb that you enchant via magic to a stick that you either buy or fletch.
---
Crafting has been a catch all for various magical shit for a long time because it made no sense to put it with runecrafting.
---
The argument that you can just slap more shit into an already bloated skill is idiotic and needs to die.
---
It’s crap
---
Then just remove voting, i cant even exercise my democracy right to vote. 
---
I didnt force you to vote yes to all PvM content. I already stated my reason why i dont like warding, but you dismiss them as “horseshit reasons”.

And sadly, things will start to include warding like quests etc. So how can i not train warding to fufill the requirement ? I cant have fun grinding skills.

Over 1/4 of the playerbase not wanting something is not a small minority. That's how polling works. Don't blame a system because something you like doesn't make it.
---
This is legit tho my dude
---
To be fair, it's like that in most games. It's only really OSRS where the best gear is straight buyable.
---
It does help sort the biggest issue though, which is high level skill rewards are totally pointless at present.
---
Not even close.
---
Lol
---
Did you make all that money just from loot?
---
I mean, no they don't? If you want to make the argument that warding will be crafting/smithing/fletching/cooking 4.0, then sure whatever. But I enjoy all of these skills so I don't really mind.
---
Realistically all crafting in the entire game is basically a menu swapping game. And that's fine for plenty of it's.
---
"let's not forget" implies you know that we've already seen this, and it could only have been posted here 2 weeks ago or less because that's how long the tweet has existed you fucking donut
---
No.
---
&gt; bloated skill
---
This whole argument is flawed. If crafting is truly bloated why does it serve little to no purpose for non ironmen? Why does it's identity remain intact?
---
If it also crafted runes, and arrows and armour yeh sure, it's bloated but as it stands it is not 
---
Also a "Battlestaff" is a staff believe it or not. It can be equipped, it does give bonuses. To give it an elemental bonus you use your skills in magic to create an orb, and your skills in crafting to combine that. I never said crafting did it alone. I said crafting creates these final products

Personally, I think it is really bad how Magic armor goes 1, 20, 40 with nothing in-between. There is also nothing at 60 and the Level 50 really isn't practical to get for Levels 50-60 (or even 50-70). So instead of getting to go from Steel to Mith to Addy to Rune to Dragon or from Leathers up the colors of Dragonhides, you just go Wizard, Xerician, your preferred color Mystic, and Ahrims which loses so much of the progression that OSRS is all about. 
---
You're weapons don't tend to matter much either. You do get some progression with spells, but chances are you won't upgrade to Earth Blast or such; you'll stick with the cheaper low-level spells for training. And while for Ranged you would upgrade from a Maple Bow to a Yew Bow even if you keep the cheaper ammo, for Magic there really isn't much to go for since a Staff of Fire is just as good as a Fire Battlestaff or Mystic Fire Staff. You could say that 1 to 30 unlocks the combo staves like Smoke, but still pretty lackluster compared to upgrading Shortbows or Scimitars every 10 levels.
---
So even if it is low or mid-level and not too relevant once you're 70+, I'd argue it is a problem that Magic is so hollow compared to the other combat styles.
---

Speaking of Bandos, I saw a bandos bot farm the other day. Weird shit.
---
I said that Smithing was OSRS's dedicated melee armour production skill, and that Crafting was OSRS's dedicated ranged armour production skill. I used the word irrefutably for a reason - that's fact.
---
You're talking about Smithing being about working with metals and Crafting being about working with leathers, fabrics and woods. Yes, that's also true. You're not saying I'm wrong and you're right, you're just expanding my purely 'game design' definition to a thematic/world-building definition. ...so, okay?
---
**Back to the topic at hand:** If you want magic robes to go into Crafting then the only way it would work is if the base fabrics are stitched together with crafting and then you use Warding to imbue the blue robe (for example) into a wizard robe and therefore confer it magical properties. There is nothing inheriently magical about bits of cloth sewn together - in my mind it's the Warding process that grants the item its magical offensive and defensive stats.
---
So evil tree, but expanded across more skills and as a raid.

Snipping tool is a friend that you have in you so why do you neglect him? Are you being serious right now? He's always been there for you and will be.

Are you living at your granny who only knows how to snap pictures with her Nokia brick? Babe, you deserve better. Just use the snipping tool. Not only will your marriage make you happy, but it'll make us others around you glad as well. Please, just remember the next time.
---
RS3 player here (and OSRS) - IMO the Mining/Smithing update in RS3 was one of the best updates in a long, long time. Would love to see this get reworked in OSRS too. :)
---
New skill: pvp smithing. The more people you kill the more iron you collect to make blood-iron gear. Not tradable and gear stats are a median of all the people you've slayed attack/str/def for melee gear, range/def for range gear, mage/def for mage gear.
---
You recover an account via "lost/inaccessible email", supply a new email you know the info of, this bypasses all the security on your email, including 2fa, as well as 2fa on rs. 
---
Thats what hes saying.
---
The difference is that those are all the high-level payoffs of doing the skill. Those aren't how you train the skill - nobody's mass producing DFSs. I think the point in the OP isn't that high level skill rewards can't be cool, but that the day-to-day training should be mundane.
---
I think warding succeeds at this though.
---
True, but it's a lot slower than just using one that you've got on you
---
I used black chins and pulled all of the healers in one attack. Then I ran them behind the Italy rock gathered myself and when back at jad. At this point only one healer was attacking me and I was able to finish him.
---
As fuel for a minigame or item. Or as a sacrifice for purchasing items in a reward shop. There are definitely ways to do it.
---
I hated warding when they first mentioned it but today I read the entire public view google doc (40 pages with every detail on it) and I actually like it. I wish they didn’t try to jam every single thing they want to add to the game into this one skill and just kind of stuck to hunting for silk &gt; dissolving vis &gt; creating armor. 
---
However, if you take the time to read it’s clear that they devs are listening to everything we have asked for and the addition of a new skill would be really fun. You would get better low level/niche mage armor, QOL with runecrafting, QOL with pking as well as PVM (rune pouch upgrade), new hunter/rcing training methods, etc. And none of the bs AOE wardstones, imbue changes if you already have rings, etc.
---
OSRS needs the dissolving mechanic. I don't care about warding honestly. I'm most excited about the economy changes that dissolving could potentially bring. 
---
Just speculating, but some parts of skilling will probably become a better money maker
---
Yeah and I don't like those skills, I think they need to be fixed rather just add more dead content to an already bloated game

On top of that, voice your opinion. If you have a problem with warding then let Jagex hear your feedback. 
---
When the only options are "yes" and "no", the intentions behind the voters become blurred.
---
To be honest Im not a fan of buyable skills. I want something I can grind out like thieving or hunter or woodcutting, something not effected by your bank value. I dont care a lot about the new armor or content warding offers because I like what there is to do right now. Im not against a new skill but a buyable skill like warding is not what I want. The lore gap people point out also just doesnt matter to me. Never thought about it before warding and I still dont care about it.

---
Why add any skill? Sailing could be a minigame, artisan could be what the farming tasks in the guild are now, etc. It should be a matter of scale and how much it affects the game and economy. This will affect the economy enormously. That's not something you just tack on to another skill.
---
What are good skills/activities for multitasking? Doing a lot of skill leveling right now and I just want to be as efficient as possible without spending millions I don’t have. So I’m hoping there’s at least multitasking or certain ways to go about things. 
---
Most of my levels are 50-60s, some 70s and one 80(mining((RS goal is getting it to 99))
---
Hey cool, they added Hitmonlee as an integrity change
---
If warding passes and none of the rewards do they'll find other rewards. They won't just add an empty skill
---
What..?
---
&gt;You can add item sinks without a skill.
---
A new skill is the best way to add an item sink. An item sink needs some sort of incentive for players to use it otherwise it doesn't fulfill it's intended function. It can't be monetary, because we already have that in the form of alching. Adding low tier item rewards defeats the purpose of an item sink. Adding high tier item rewards is always an issue because new BIS equipment always has game balance concerns. If those high tier rewards are untradeable players will inherently hate the content (see: dungeoneering). 
---
Adding the item sink to a skill solves these issues because the incentive for using it is inherent in the levelling of the skill. Players like maxing and will always pay to do it. It's literally the best solution for the economy of the game. 
---
&gt; Bloat is not an argument.
---
Bloat literally is an argument. These things may be accessible to veteran players who are already familiar with the skill. But it's common game design knowledge that new players will quit a game if overwhelmed with confusing content. New players are, surprisingly, good for the long term health of a game. We want players to come in and feel like skills are accessible and crafting is, flat out, not accessible to new players. It's incredibly difficult to figure out where to start and what content to move on to without the help of in depth guides that, again, new players will not be familiar with. 
---
&gt;It doesn't fit at all with the rest of magic crafting content like jewellery or battlestaves.
---
Exactly why the new content shouldn't be put into those skills. It doesn't fit :)
---
the sauce is nerdy gamer hotties
---
Yea but the unique component for making dagonhai stuff wouldn't be ubiquitous like vis is, it's just there to make dagonhai slightly rarer.
---
So so the  you should probably say that you don't notice that botting isn't effecting your gameplay. Not that botting doesn't effect your gameplay.
---
Why? You could home tele and if that is on cooldown, use your minigame teleport to go to Pest Control, Castle Wars, Clan Wars, Barbarian Assault or ToB and bank there.
---
Just do birdhouse runs.
---
Idc if warding gets added, I just know it’s gonna be another aids skill that isn’t fun to train but I’ll have to for diaries and quests. I would like a more interactive skill like something similar to dungeoneering which was really fun to train. Either way I’m not voting because I don’t really care

Yeah, I guess yes voters are too big brained to explain to lowly no voters the reason why warding should be a skill without coming across as a self-important jackass.
---
Depends on what you’re trying to do. EX slayer is ok at 45 def, but raids is way harder as a zerk, I’d suggest going for a high slayer level while training str/mage/range in the process and gain some money so from there you can decide what you want to do personally

Second, your argument here boils down to “it’s just a joke bro” which is immature at best.

---
BACCY CONES AND...
---
I think that's just far too niche for a skill. Do we need an enchanting skill instead of just letting magic keep handling that? We have a magic skill, and a skill about infusing magic into things to create magical runes, why not utilise those?
---
something something bigotry
---
Fuuuck i forgot tome gave fire runes &gt;.&lt;
---
I mean, I literally did explain in my first comment why it should be a skill but like we covered, you can't read lol. If you gain the skill in the future just go back to my first comment and give it a go
---
I find it interesting that you had the right word, affect, the first time, but then got it wrong the second time.
---
I don't remember resource dungeons so that's definitely something I didn't witness.
---
No one said it wasn't expansive, but it was still structured like a minigame. It had no core elements like a skill.
---
I think it was a great piece of content, but still to this day it's the weirdest idea of a skill I've seen in RS. And that's even after shit like divination came out.
---
Didn’t like your guide so I guess I gotta make my own
---
I was one of those 9 year olds playing just to merch way before the ge and it was not uncommon.

For the reason we have attack and strength, and not just ranged and magic.

Oh it definitely has a cost associated to it, but so do most of the combats due to having gear + degradable gear + supplies.

Cheeky. Maybe you are a no voter trying to get people to vote no with your shit arguments. You're doing just fine if thats the case.

Maybe a small buff to the game in general would be good. Not that great but it could be better to have some activity.
---
Crafting is not saturated. Don't just rinse and repeat poor points you've read. What makes crafting saturated if its place and purpose in the game is simply crafting raw fabric and items into armour, weapons and jewellery? It doesn't cover every single thing ever, smithing covers metals, fletching covers ammunition, herblore covers potions.
---
I'm so tired of simply seeing people say "can't put it in crafting it's bloated and saturated as is". How? Explain to me how?

Because xp is one of the few things of value which is always removed from the economy when it is acquired. By making it possible to convert more items into xp directly, it removes items from the game and prevents items from being alched (which effectively removes gold from the game. Ultimately it helps to maintain a healthy economy by reducing the oversupply of certain items, increasing the value of items that aren't worth as much as they should be, and keeping prices more stable.
---
       
---
The reason it is necessary to put this into a new skill instead of an existing one is because it would mess with the balance of other skills and activities if it was lumped together and competed with other xp acquisition methods. Dissolving, if not done through warding would completely overthrow existing training methods, or it would not compete and just be dead content itself.
---
It never ceases to amaze me how virgins desperate for female attention throw around that word so much.

You must be sad and small. I'm almost certain.

False, making magic shit, making ranging shit, making half of the stuff applicable to everything, that is all crafting, and even so, the majority of mage gear that is worn is not craftable, as opposed to ranged gear where most of it absolutely is and melee gear where nearly every bit is except for the top tier.
---
Mage gear has always been hugely unbalanced and it’s one of the (many) reasons that wildy is so dead for members. This update would be a huge step towards both fixing that and allowing a totally new form of gameplay in the mage pure account
---
fyi for the jad phase you have to switch prayers before he spits

I know this is a really old post but I get this same exact email like several times a week.

So much so, in fact, that I had to block [a.runescape.com](https://a.runescape.com) since they're spoofing runescape email addresses.

Hopefully not very many people are falliing for this.
---
You’ll be fine.
---
Right but we don't have ancient magick as a skill, we have it as a spell book 
---
We don't have "armour crafting" and "weapon crafting".
---
We don't have "armour Smith" and "weapon Smith". 
---
We cover these sub categories in one skill. Just as magic can cover "magic" related things
---
Sure I'm game. But i will scream again and again. If you want to rejuvenate the wildy fix the games death mechanics first then put stuff in the wildy for PvMers and Skillers as we're spoiled with the current death mechanics and as such no1 really likes the wildy because of the risk.... As the rest of the game is safe AF

A common issue in democracy is people thinking "How will this affect me?" when they vote instead on "How will this affect everyone?" In broad way, short-sighted or tunnel-vision voting historically leads to worse outcomes.
---
Hello, I'd like you to meet Firemaking
---
Yeah, as I said, I finished the miniquest and claimed the rewards days ago but just logged in the other day with the lamp in my inventory.

"I care more about a pixel flag on my back than I do about preventing a game I sank hours into from becoming stagnant and dying."
---
Have you ever asked yourself what will happen to the game if literally nothing changes?
---
support
---
Except if you looked at the newspost they changed the Warding symbol to be a circle
---
We don't know if it will work on boss items or not. It could but without directly listing them there seems to be little reason to assume you would salvage them over other options. That said, it still does help the economy; it is a gold sink and it will sink some non-alched items like God Pages and other clue items. If someone smiths a ton of addy platebodies, salvaging provides a way to remove them without turning them into gp, which means less gp coming into the game. That won't stop players who alch to train magic (those poor souls), but it will help with things like Slayer where you could choose to salvage your loot for energy and sell that instead of alching directly for cash; it could end up being the same, or more, profit for you but it won't bring as much gp into the game.
---
Its a 1/2500 drop, you can hang them in your house as decoration. Besides that completely useless.
---
I don't multi pk myself so no
---
Practicing for Galvek is fair. He's a trickier one on the first few attempts. Gz on the cape
---
SOMEONE IS BUTT HURT
---
Beta testing LMS is hardly the place for it. It's like a [pro soccer player scoring against a child and laughing at them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqOxNspUPyE).
---
If both of these players were real PvPers and there's something at stake (even bragging rights) then I'd get it, but it's someone who is clearly experienced taking on someone who has no experience in a context that is meaningless. 
---
Trash talking is competitive, toxicity is not. This is clearly toxicity.
---
holy shit man so much nostalgia.  played RS and toontown quite a bit in the day
---
The blowpipe was introducex
---
Oh i know that it’s not good for the game, Jagex, or the community, but it’s how I wish to play the game.
---
I have Lance but not justicar. Is bandos a good replacement? What about for helm?
---
I enjoyed Soul Wars as a minigame a lot but I don't think I'd want the same reward system in osrs
---
Nah just making a point.
---
Sadly theres quite a few skills that have practically no reward, woodcutting you just drop every log you ever cut in most methods, barbarian fishing is meta and the same can be said here. And sadly, nearly all of the skills in game are outdone by AFKing gargoyles
---
I have an avernic because I ffaed it at raids.
---
Well.. fair enough.
---
Sink? 🤔
---
rescale the pet so it doesn't clip as much would be better
---
Lmao, yes, I'm a nerd but you going through my post history multiple months back because you got hurt by one comment calling you out is ironic. Get a life lol
---
I'm kinda old school and still go to Catherby to fish because that was the best fishing spot when I got my first membership as a ten year old (fourteen years ago).
---
Ahhh anyone know the best place to fish now with like 65ish fishing.
---
God no yeah, def needs revamped but not so outrageous that bots don’t sit at the aid station so you can throw chins at them
---
Context?
---
I work in a cancer lab and play rs mobile during down time
---
Sounds like reddit to me :^)
---
🐈
---
Huge facts lmao
---
Thats crazy man, sick *prayer switches
---
If you want to use a book, try mages book perhaps.
---
Yikes sweaty
---
Good argument
---
Magic is already really bloated, so that's understandable. Runecraft on the other hand, has no other reason than "devaluing other people's achievements". RC is a terrible skill. To train, to utilize. It desperately needs more content but people would cry a river if their 99 RC (or rather, 77) got made easier to reach or, god forbid, less miserable.
---
Warding would work perfectly as an expansion to Runecraft but I haven't seen Jagex ever even adress this. They want to make it a new skill for some reason. I'm still going to vote for it but I would much prefer to see it as Runecraft expansion. And I would **love** if Jagex adressed this point and why not consider it.
---
Great job. B all the way
---
UIM?
---
Maybe i just love killing shit
---
Man, I remember playing back in like 06, when people trained at the mines and trading the rune essence was faster than dropping it. 
---
I made a good chunk of money running inventories of essence from the mine to Varrock east bank, then selling it to the guys sitting there in the bank.
---
Ok cheers 👍
---
Dude I love to PK but this is just sad.
---
Same thing happened to me last year. Just got back into the game and a guy I met ended up giving me a bond and enough d bones to get my prayer upto 50! Even showed me how to use a player owned house/altar to level it!
---
Then Runescape is maybe not the right game for you cause grinding Skills is a major part of the game.
---
PvMscape wasn't even a thing back in 2007.
---
Your last point is the only reasonable one so far and yeah i totally agree on that. Quest/Diary skill requirements are a bain in this game and shouldn't exist.
---
I'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong
---
Then they just added left click anyway.
---
If you want to unlock various high-end magic and melee options (Ancient magic spellbook (Spells with utility such as life leech and freeze) and Ferocious gloves (best melee gloves)), you'll need to do specific quests that require a small amount of range (Temple of Ikov and Animal Magnitism require 40/25 ranging, respectively).
---
There are some mid-high level bosses that you can do without range if you have the right gear, like General Graador or Kril' Tsutaroth, who are primarally taken on with melee. There are other mid-high level bosses that you cannot do without range, like Kree'arra, a boss that is immune to melee and has absurd magic defense.
---
For end-game raids, you're required to use ranged combat, as well as mage and melee too.
---
Basically, one of Runescape's core combat features is that you're not locked to any particular combat style. A lot of content is made more engaging by creating scenarios that incentivize toggling buffs and protections prayers, properly timing the right utility spell, and swapping between whole sets of equipment mid-combat. If you're not playing with all 3 combat styles, you're not going to be able to experience many aspects of the late game.
---
damn thats a shitty friend, sorry for your loss but still
---
Based on one toxic cunt? I have had a great time doing this as a PvM player.
---
I got bandos pet at 25kc and didn’t tele out right away, next kill I got reckt by minions... #feelsbad
---
They didn't charge it with YOUR card, they charged it with a stolen card. Your account was simply the middle man for the transaction. You need to be more clear when you say they charged $500 on your account, because it wasn't $500 of your money.
---
Good luck. Not sure if they unban for this type of stuff or not.
---
Exactly that, he has a higher chance of assigning better monsters in better numbers
---
Is it literally impossible that someone could disagree with her opinions, dislike her personality, or find some of the artwork she's done since joining the team to be questionable? Is "being an incel" literally the *ONLY REASON* why anyone would dare to question her? It's a rhetorical question, I know that's what Reddit believes.
---
Do you ever wonder why Mod Maz hasn't been targeted by these "incel hordes"?
---
Im curious as to whats wrong with it because I dont know a lot. What is actually wrong with it?
---
Today’s salt harvest is bountiful

+1 for treasonous. If BiS stab isn’t gonna do best damage here then it won’t anywhere.

How much was your bank? 20M?  
---
Also do u know where he lives?   
---
Time to pay him a visit.  
---
If he is not your IRL friend then sorry but serves you right.
---
He was be smart but afk on runescape or other similar games can mean literally out of ur chair or where u dont have to pay attention
---
&gt;beautiful
---
Go outside more, bud. Look at some real girls walking around.
---
Wahhhhhhhhh
---
Brutal blue dragons are never worth doing. Skip if possible. Even if you're an ironman looking for a blue dhide body, it will take less time to train your ranged with weaker equipment than it would to get that body.
---
Tbh I think all 3 skills Artisan, Sailing and Warding should all be in the game however we vote on the content to build them further. As they have been proposed they're too packed with stuff imo, they should start with just the basics.
---
But I also wish they'd come up with more ideas for Firemaking as it has gotten very few updates over the years.
---
And if maxed players complain they'll lose their cape then let's just remove the cape. The hiscores are a thing.
---
not everyone that plays this game plays enough to get 300 total level in a day
---
We literally have a firemaking skill. OSRS isn’t above niche skills.
---
I was one of those noobs people would hire for a really low price. 
---
My first 'money maker' was mining silver ore in classic. 
---
I'd mine 1k silver outside of varrock, turn it into certificates, and sell it to some guy for 30k. 
---
Eventually he didn't need silver anymore, and needed yews. 
---
So I started cutting yews outside draynor, and would sell him 1k yews at 200k. 
---
I don't know how much I lost on the silver, but I eventually saw people buying yews 350gp each, and called him out on it. 
---
He started paying me 300gp each, and I reasoned that it was better to have a consistent buyer than try to negotiate with others for 350gp ea.
---
But hey, at least he gave me a great deal by selling me my first rune pickaxe for only 35k!
---
Imagine unironically thinking that neckbeards don't make completely untrue compliments just because they're desperate for female attention.
---
1 asshole is more memorable than 10 alright blokes.
---
My first alt just hit 93 str today! 
---
Gonna get that to 97, attack from 75 -&gt; 95 and defense from 70 -&gt; 90. After that I’ll be finishing up ds2 and I’ll finally have a bond machine ready to feed my Ironman B\^)
---
You could have been an ultimate Ironman with like raids gear or something, gotta check to be sure
---
Yeah it’s unfortunate lol now I’m going to just bank stand if you ever want to join
---
That would imply that I never thought that. That’s totally true. But to respond “she’s not going to fuck you” when someone is just making a compliment is silly as hell.
---
Yeah but the point is my kc is 148 hence I've not done Cerb much at all
---
My bank was that 30M lol I’m not a good player and wanted to try them out since I hit 75 defense, and yeah I said I can only blame my self just kinda sucks I’ve got nothing now lol
---
I saw this comment first, but I have no words to say. 
---
🦀Jamflex good🦀
---
Edit: now that I've gotten the stupid out of the way, a lot of us have been waiting a long time for a skill like this. Thank you 🙏
---
What is DnD?
---
Where's the proof?
---
There's actually an archery shop in Rimmington.
---
Grow everything. Hops, grapes, fruit trees, hespori, cactus, everything. It'll be a lot but it's good and if you be careful with it it can work out for decent exp/gp. 
---
Otherwise, Tithe farm. I enjoy it, most dont but it's really up to you.
---
Do herb runs every hour and a half, and make sure you have em all unlocked as soon as possible
---
Doesn't matter if a majority wants it if 26% of people don't.
---
The Grand Exchange is as big as Lumbridge and Burthorpe and Faldor castles
---
Because maz doesn't appear on camera at all? 
---
Pretty fucking obvious that they're going to target the most front facing female jagex employee because that's how they think they get noticed
---
hot people play osrs but not all people that play osrs are hot
---
Give me an example of something she did that she got reasonabel criticizem for? The design of the crystal armor needed some feedback but it wasn't garbage. For the rest I can't think of anything bad she did. Other female jmods who don't show their faces have done bad things, but you don't see the incel hordes attack them. The incels attack Gee because she is a good looking woman doing "a man's job".
---
Very true.
---
I have absolutely no idea what this means
---
666666666
---
Goddamnit Clara!
---
you took the hit but this is true lol
---
Since reading comprehension doesn't seem to be your strong suit and you come off as delicate and easily upsetable, here's a piece by piece breakdown:
---
&gt;I'm gonna need some references for those wild claims.
---
I didn't make any wild claims, I said it's important to consider the bigger picture instead of just personal impact. There's nothing novel or wild about that.
---
&gt;How can we know what's best for everyone?
---
I'm not claiming we can, I'm just saying we should consider multiple angles. 
---
&gt;That takes a lot of audacity to think you know what's best for everyone.
---
Again, never said I do. I didn't even weigh in on what I think about the issue. Just pointing out that thinking more than one step through is a good idea. 
---
&gt;Maybe we should ask people what's best for them so we can know what to vote for. Oh wait, that's literally the entire point of voting isn't it. 
---
Yeah, usually getting the opinion of many people is a good idea when researching a voting topic and coming to your own conclusion. It's called informed voting.
---
Yea I had a clan mate who split a ely from corp then one day he went ape shit and scammed a clan mate (I think he has real life issues). This other clan mate was addicted to duel area and lost everything and decided to log on to his friend's account and take his stuff to go back to staking.
---
As south park learned us, girls totally have bawls dude
---
Have you tried just going in with range gear? I had a hard time then I decided to say fuck it and ditched my mage switches. Made it easier to concentrate on prayer.
---
Does a higher farming level reduce the chance of a patch getting diseased?
---
Yeah and loads of people liked it in the beta. But this is just assuming every piece of content with a beta must be as bad as EoC was. This is just a false assumption.
---
Anyways as far as I understand Warding will have multiple betas which may reduce issues significantly.
---
Thats the incentive to make you destroy items, we dont want to always give better and better armor for every new update, leveling up, getting the new rune pouch and rings(now its just an alternative to nmz, which I think they do to not scare sceptics away) and maybe some new stuff in the future is enough motivation so far.
---
Which end do I stick in count draynor?
---
Just vote no and do your part.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blackjack
---
Its literally on the osrs wiki under uses.
---
There's also a gif showing that's its multiple different options to continually pickpocket someone
---
Well youre getting burned my man but I just wanted to say, SKOLLLLLLL and LEGGO VIKES!!! #purpNgold4ever 
---
Godspeed my dude..godspeed.
---
your language usage in context regarding women indicates you are a mgtow or an incel and now people will believe it whether you claim to be one or not.
---
Rs2 right in the feels
---
Firemaking is used for lightsources, wintertodt, Weiss bonfires. As I said; over the years they have been adding new things into every skill. Each skill really doesnt need to be overcomplex, as long as it has some kind of purpose. Firemaking has become useless since its easier to bank for food than catch it and cook it.
---
What’s wrong with you, why would you do this to yourself (congrats btw)
---
Why does Mod ash not have his own sub Reddit yet? I'd love to see his shenanigans on my feed everyday!
---
You looked in the mirror?
---
I think there's just as big of a problem of letting mostly max levels vote, or people who haven't played actively, or people from RS3. I've seen people saying they're resubbing just to vote no, or coming from RS3 to vote no, which makes about as much sense as having someone from a different country vote for your local laws and policies.
---
Additionally, your thresholds are way too high. Sure a new level 3 account shouldn't be able to vote, but 1200 skill level is too high to decide on low- and mid level content. At total level 1200, you're already kind of past Forthos Dungeon, depending on how you trained. Same with warding coming up, there's a lot of low level content in there - should the only voters be people who have the money to level it to 90+ right away? That makes no sense.
---
On the other hand, it's also kind of weird to have &lt;1000 total levels vote for end-game content.
---
But this is why we have voting for everyone - everyone plays the game, everyone decides.
---
Im honestly less skeptical about how bad EoC was in terms of Jagex being out of touch after watching the Runescape Documentary.
---
Apparently the reason they pushed EoC even with the massive backlash was because all the content developed while developing EoC was using Eoc as its base. Meaning they would have to scrap over half a years worth of updates if they went back on Eoc.
---
In hindsight, It would have probably been better to scrap EoC. But I think with how much people tend to go full outrage mode on the internet, they could be forgiven for thinking that people would warm up to EoC
---
Nice , mind if i use it in my next dnd session?
---
Yeah it’s all fucked up dude, wanna bank stand at ge with me lol
---
&gt;The icon still kind of confuses me. It's not used anywhere within warding itself as a stone tablet looking esque thing. Why not just have it be the lantern we use or the wards we draw? Crafting is just a hammer and chisel. Smithing an anvil. I'd say a ward is to warding what an anvil is to smithing.
---
From /u/DivineInsanityReveng
---
Why not?
---
Yeah man. Rune scim + Clue + Prayer Pot + Spade, and Protect Item.
---
whyd do people in this community hate women so much
---
&gt; Cool opinion Mr PvMScaper, but yes it does sound fun to me and the majority of players. The couple twitter brainlets are just a vocal minority.
---
What a great way to start your points. With needless insults and broad statements. I'm far from a "Mr PvMscape". I'm maxed and have spent very little time doing PvM. I thoroughly enjoy relaxing grinds in skills. Buyables are the least interesting skills to me. Thats called an opinion. Its different to yours, that doesn't make it wrong or a "brainlet" opinion. You also don't speak for everyone, so don't claim the majority wants it. I will agree with that statement when a poll passes with the majority saying so.
---
&gt; Warding has more than enough content to deserve being it's own skill
---
I disagree. As it is it is a sub-section of crafting made into a new skill for "lore" reasoning essentially. You need magical warding skill to make the armour etc. That could easily be combined into crafting with magic/runecrafting, similar to staves currently or boots. 
---
&gt; You're clearly uninformed. It fills in huge gaps to gameplay elements and lore.
---
Am I? What lore is it creating aside from a "reason" for mage armour to be created. The lore has been in game for a while, warding is just the skill behind that lore. And no where have i said that doesn't make sense. I'm simply stating "making sense" is not enough of a reason for a skill to be added into game.
---
&gt; 90% of skills aren't "useful" for any normal account.
---
I totally agree. I'd rather attention be brought to these skills being made useful for normal accounts using some of the ideas presented (dissolving / dissassembly mainly) rather than making another skill thats the only way to do that, and useless otherwise. I don't think this is a reason for it to not be included, but i think combined with it just being a buyable bank-standing skill its not very exciting, hence not intriguing me to vote yes for it.
---
&gt; How is dissolving not well designed? You're throwing out statements without any explanation. **I don't have a clue what invention is cause i quitted RS in 2012.** 
---
Maybe do some research then, and you'll understand why i said this. Invention gave value to rarer items (treasure trails and boss drops) by having them give unique ingredients necessary for better augments. It also sunk these items to augment your own item, and when you levelled that up you either siphoned it (kept item but lost level, at level 12) or you destroyed it at level 10 giving more XP but losing the item. It was a true sink. Dissolving will sink budget gear and low-cost items that are already at alch values, to get resources to make armour.. which you will dissolve. Thats the gameplay loop i see happening. Its not a nonexistent sink, but its no where near as effective or useful as people are making it seem (comparing it to Invention, which it simply isn't designed like).
---
You can say you hear no valid points, but simply diminishing legitimate ones because "lol brainlets" isn't exactly a great counter argument. People disagreeing with you doesn't mean they are wrong or uninformed.
---
I'm guessing there is no easy OSRS  map maker? This would be sick for my DnD campaign!
---
had to take 3 minutes to tele to edgeville, pls nerf
---
Or just add summoning 🤔🤔🤔🤔  
---
Thats a joke. While I really love summoning. I know alot of people dont want it
---
so ur account got a nice long time of member ship? kinda sounds nice, just start doing qeusts and stuff and train stuff u slowly will make money  that way.  just make sure u get 2 step verification and stuff.
---
Spotted the teamviewer inferno max

nah taking a break from osrs. xD

I dont tho..

---
Some are probably abit bitter about the times they didn't get rejected and ended up getting fucked over instead too. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
nah it was shit
---
How does it save the game.
---
Yea, it's in the video they released at about the same time as the warding blog. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOSHHdMoe4I
---
At about 2 mins in.
---
Warding not making sense? Warding is simply allowing people be able to make mage equipment, makes perfect sense considering the skills uhhh smithing and crafting. *Neckbeard noises*
---
Just add sailing as well for 2475... problem solved.
---
We used to tape a blanket over half the screen and sit under it to prevent screen peeking in our super serious 1v1 GoldenEye matches lol
---
I have reservations about that, but my primary issue is that I don't want to vote for a skill with no high level content. I'm of the opinion that basically every level (or at least every other level) from 90 to 99 should be unlocking valuable content and/or training methods. After all, 90-99 is more than half the skill by xp
---
To be honest. I think summoning could be a really good skill if it was purely a combat or skiller skill.
---
And instead of making fucking pouches you would train the skill by, you know, actually summoning creatures and using them.
---
Necromancy could be a pretty cool skill... Though it would probably be lumped in with magic
---
This might be true
---
I know it isn't feasible, but how cool would it be if sc still had the summoning aspect but it was just based off your Hunter level or something?
---
Legit if you didn't go for bump mapped textures and instead used "flatter" textures it would legit look like one of the old school renders
---
Then skip lol, just like you’d skip that person
---
I'm probably voting yes, because new content is pretty cool, but it seems like Warding could potentially just fit under crafting which sucks.  I dont think they would ever add crafting mage sets into the pre existing skill, but thats my only gripe with it is that it is very similar to a pre-existing skill.   Other than that I hope it passes and see what kind of new content arises from it.
---
I'm lvl 62 now and I only started farming like a week ago. From 1-29 there are a couple quests you can do to skip the low lvl stuff. Just go on the wiki to see what they are (I forgot). From there I did multiple runs a day (4 max but at most it was 3). First run has fruit tree and the rest doesn't include fruit trees since it won't be finish yet. I do fruit trees, log trees, allotments, herbs, ultracompost, and cactuses. For fruit trees I do best available and logs I do willows because its the cheapest log tree. Allotments again best available with a flower protecting it (Did sweetcorn then strawberry and now watermelon). Herbs I initially did harrlander til I was able to do toadflax. Now I do toadflax for all unprotected patches and ranarr for protected patches (had to get hosidious favor and do Big Arm Adventure quest). Cactuses I only plant once a day because it's 9 hours grow time and I want to be able to pick spines off it multiple times a day since it's a good source of gp. As for making ultracompost, I buy the volcanic ash from GE and pineapples from a charter ship trader (super cheap). 
---
My route:  
---
\[Start at GE\] \- Varrock (Log tree near palace) -&gt; tree gnome stronghold (fruit tree and log tree) -&gt; tree gnome village (fruit tree)
---
\[Fairy ring\] - farming guild cactus
---
\[Home tele\] - lumbridge (log tree) 
---
\[Duel ring\] -&gt; al kharid (cactus)
---
\[Falador tele\] - taverly (log tree) -&gt; \[tele again to Falador\] falador (log tree) -&gt; \[run south\] falador allotment
---
\[Tithe farming tele\] Zhea Hosidious allotment &amp; Herbs
---
\[Camelot teleport\] Catherby allotment -&gt; Catherby fruit tree -&gt; \[Go to docks near bank and charter to Brimhave\] Brimhaven fruit tree
---
\[Ardy teleport\] Ardougne allotment &amp; Herbs
---
\[Ectophile tele\] Morytania allotment &amp; Herbs
---
\[Troll Teleport\] Disease free herb patch
---
There are better ways of getting around like Ardy capes, Xeric talisman, explorer's ring, etc but I haven't gotten those yet so this is how I do things efficiently. Anyways doing this got me to 62 pretty quickly. Will probably hit 64 tomorrow. Toadflax, ranarrs, and cactus spines make up the profit. I stopped doing ultra compost (to save bank runs) once I got 500 buckets of ultra compost. If you have the cash you can do best log tree available but it gets pricey. I probably won't stop doing willows til I can do magic trees since they're the same price as yew seeds (meaning better xp/gp.
---
they have a thieving mini game that is exactly this
---
Nope, just kinda happened
---
Just wondering, what does expired even mean if it's not truly expired?
---
Even if it was true it’d still be a dumb post, sorry
---
Zulrah and Vorkath are instanced, meaning you get your own boss.

GWD is fairly busy, especially Bandos. Other ones aren't too bad and you'd only need to hop a few times.

New content is *always* huge money at first; at one point shortly after DS2 release superior dragon bones sold for 1m each, but no one complained about that. Cudgel was traded at over 20m for a bit, despite being a t65 weapon with no special effects.
---
And high level warding doesn't need to be BiS. It's a tough balance to find, but they've spent so much time and effort on warding I think they should have found it by now.
---
Lastly, the first people to get high level warding will have spent upwards of a bil on it (or at least a TON, several hundred mil). The prices of vis will be really high because there wont be much in the game yet, and everyone wants it to train the skill. If you drop a bil on a skill, I think you're entitled to making some back off the first pieces of high level armor.

Stealing creation + dungeoneering motivated me to get Max cape on RuneScape before that EoC cancer. Bring back SC pl0xxx
---
meme review sucks now
---
100% deserved 👏 hard work pays off 👏 definitely legit 👏
---
Hey mate, Thanks for giving me this in depth answer. I was afraid this was the case. Yeah I think it's better to just go with 6 brother runs. Just killing Guthans was ridiculously fast, but that drop chance for an item is just extremely bad.
---
I think you just dont read the comment enough then. Not that doing so is virtuous or anything, but plenty of people (like me) complain about how the skill is like a giant "we don't want to improve skills, so just have a new one that has some neat stuff that lets us ignore skills that need updating"
---
Didn't realise yeah came over a decade ago.
---
Besides the new pouch from warding would change rc
---
What do you suggest they do? Buff and make every ring in the game have double the stats?   
---
The difference between ring and no ring would be too huge. It has to be locked behind something.   
---
The problem isn't that it got locked behind NMZ, the problem is NMZ is too afk.  
---
But NMZ is fine.... i can bang it out in a few hours....  
---
But if it were to be behind warding, and being a BIS item u can bet i will need at least level 80+ or even 90s.  
---
I can't get level 90 in a few hours!
---
2k total world's are very stable in them always
---
You mean the Iron Man dungeon?
---
Hosidius and Shayzien were way to big at first, luckly they fixed Hosidius, I hope they fix Shayzien soon, Tents are waaaaaaaay to big, and the landscape is flat and empty as fuck :(

dudes gunna walk all the way into area 51 and gunshots wont stop him. hes a fucking tank. a fucking god among men. after he reacges area 51 hes gunna fuck all the catgirl pussy and bring world peace, making hime the world president.
---
There's a low level boss that's like 1m per hour. It's the epitome of good mid level content.
---
There have been a few strawpolls on reddit b4 this week some with 1k votes
---
That's the most stupid shit for not liking content I've ever heard in my life, Gz.
---
I was in a stream when people started to figure out he was gone from the hiscores, someone in his clan said he was asleep cuz he had just been playing for 30 hours in some skilling competition (or whatever it is they do). Whatever he did to get banned it was during that so I guess that makes it less inexplicable.
---
I honestly dont see all the fuzz.
---
I think Warding looks and sounds great.
---
Deff a yes for me cant wait to start training it
---
They aren’t at all. They have complete control they could rig it either way.
---
I just did this as well. I also died during the kill, but it still counted. God I suck...
---
Did you just combine wait a minute or what does waymint mean
---
Is it just me or does the crab on the right look lighter and smaller than the one on the left? Using Reddit nightmode btw
---
I don't really think justiciar counts as a melee set, since you're not like "Oh i want to whip some abby demons today, lets slap on the justiciar"
---
So, we should have coloured tourmaline items from new bosses, that we can apply to our bandos gear to improve it to tier 75 with better stats and there's our t75 power crept melee armour. It makes sense since the description of the black tourmaline core talks about the bandos metal reacting with tourmaline
---
But fletching is also used to make shields and battlestaves. And honestly crafting is too overburdened. I think it would be a fine idea to move leather armor into fletching.
---
But that's beside the point. I think jamplex is too obsessed with the need to release "more skills!!1!" when the real need is just for more content. Runescape shouldn't stay stagnant, it absolutely deserves more updates. But warding feels like a skill for the sake of having a skill. All these great ideas fit into the game just fine under the already existent framework.
---
Granted, kids TV and Horror do seem like two odd genres to merge, but I some how find this more fucked up.

I’m saying they will keep polling it and promoting indefinitely

HCIM , I want prayer to 43. My plan is grinding agility until I can use taverly dungeon shortcut and then kill blue drags and use at ecto, does that make sense?

Any update is RS3 AND EOC!! REE i'm a manchild how dare you update my nostalgic gameee
---
He doesn't represent the majority of TD posters. Don't try that shit.
---
I agree, I'm all for new mage gear but it seems pointless in adding it through a new skill when it's basically parts of multiple other skills that have very similar concepts in parts.
---
-.- read the blog
---
Fun fact, RC isn't objectively as horrible as you portray it to be. Give it an honest fair chance.
---
Given the age of the email, it's not unlikely that it may have cropped up in some kind of database breach. But yeah, I'm not really sure; this is the first time that it's been this directed towards me before.
---
He mines iron for that genuine nostalgia rush
---
Bots get fucked.

sexualized or hated? the problem here is gee getting hate, not cat called. incels are the ones who hate women for not giving coochie, simps are the ones that beg to lick toes. there's a difference, and both are bad but the counter-overreaction has taken people to defend damsels against any form of criticism
---
ur mum looks like a chad
---
Any macro is shtty and should result in severe repercussions
---
Surprised its not been downvoted due to lack of toes.
---
&gt; I have 20m+ ranged xp on my own f2p uim.
---
I kinda doubt this, there are only two F2P uims that have 20M range xp or close to that and the both have reddit accounts that are not yours.
---
What a piece of shit NEET this guy has been lmfao. Jebrim-tier shit personality. Hope he takes this opportunity to divorce himself from the lifestyle he’s lived and become a different person
---
That would hurt like hell whilst running, no thanks
---
A or b but honestly A because it has the background base of the rs login screens
---
Thats literally the only way you can train prayer in f2p
---
Maz refuses to even have her picture posted because ~~of this reason~~ she is secretly a squirrel.

I mean.. that's not really something for customer support. All you can do is talk to the guy or tell him to keep his personal life to himself really.

&gt;&gt;rather than waste time picking them up
---

---
&gt;They appear in your inventory. 1 click on your herb sack is a lot faster than manually dropping it all.
---
Herb sack isn't infinite and droppi g it takes 0 time.
---
 And banking takes like a minute.
---
Perfectly understandable to not interrupt what you are doing to bank what is worth almost nothing.
---
What I love the most is that these people genuinely think that their shitty opinions matter. Like they seriously feel authoritarian when they pull this bs.
---
orange man tells it like it is

make runescape great again
---
Take a look at the in game Lance attack animation. The shield gets swung behind almost exactly like this artwork
---
What is tilting about that?
---
downvoting =/= sharing opinion
---
Ogresses to 99 range gets you to ~68 prayer, 99attack/strength/defence would bump that up to ~82. If you want faster prayer exp your best bet is picking up bones in the boneyard in wilderness.
---
I think bullseye is 49 firemaking. But it's easy to skill and you need the levels for quests anyways.
---
Because magic is overpowered as it is already in pvp
---
Is dhcb any good for these?
---
Notes: I made this character for an Intro for Oakdice. I could make short osrs animations if many ppl would want to see it. For anyone curious, my youtube channel is "Thoom".

voting yes because mod west is best mod. (obviously below ash duh)

Came here to say this and realised my house is almost identical except for the teles being beside the garden

This would be godly for like LMS or even DMM
---
Nobody uses macro keys for their passwords? Yikes. The lobby was good. You could talk to friends, and your clans without even having to play the game. Ditch the warding attempts, Jagex. This is what the community wants and needs.
---
Jesus, stop nitpicking OP, just say GZ and move on with your lives.

I personally hadn't thought of it like this but now I am thinking maybe they didn't want to add loads of new content to the skills already in the game due to people that have these skills maxed for example so would just be dead content for them players? Just a theory really but even for players that have high levels in these skills anything low level would not be worthwhile for a lot of the long term players which could then cause more disputes, by creating a new skill entirely it adds a wide range of content for every single player and different levels. That's all I can think tbh.
---
The problem is sometimes you have no idea if they are leaving it. I once accidentally stole an ironmans ranarrs from his farm run because he was juggling and had left them too long.
---
Moot* 
---
The argument isn’t silent my man
---
He's not accusing anyone of anything. He is just asking how they got that cape.
---
Are you implying it isn't already?
---
Gear is shitty, nice log though
---
No, the highest of any f2p iroman (regular, hardcore or ultimate) has got is level 97. [Here's the top 24 f2p ironmen for runecraft.](https://i.imgur.com/4IMudUC.png)
---
Yeah true, I was listening to Lagnarium who's an amazing pker if you've seen him he's a good looking brother and he's in great shape! Faux is another good looking brother, it's just the stereotypes of Runescape I bet there are DOZENS of non-incel bed wetters that play, dozens.
---
this is starting to worry me. i'm not sure if i had looked at either of those pictures back in 2013 i would have recognised them as old school rs. i'm getting a similar sort of feeling when i look at any rs3 content, it doesn't feel like runescape at all.
---
Most of his clan still think it was a "false ban"
---
100x modded server
---
Who said I wanted new content?  There’s already more than any normal individual could ever play.
---
Thanks, also; is level 99 the max or is the breaking point Lower?
---
Not *every* game support does this.
---
I'm proud of the ones that do though.
---
Could be pet hunting!
---
Was this really the reason the guy got banned?
---
But I do like other new content but I really don't want a skill. But sure, go ahead and think your opinion is a stated fact and everyone with a slightly ifferent opinion is wrong.
---
Your brain on reddit, seriously please leave this echochamber because people like you are truely a cancer.
---
It wouldn't actually be *that* much worse than 99 f2p rc in general. Aubury isn't much further away from the altar than the bank, and earths aren't *too* much slower than bodys...
---
In other words a continuing force of this crap down our throats?
---
I remember doing that quest when I was a kid by myself, it gave me nightmares lol. Good days man
---
nooo...
---
noo...
---
I think you forgot Lunar armor.
---
Raids 3 is area 51 and we will get alien rangers

Hello im a lvl 83 Combat, 71 att 66 str 63 def, name is Broski132. Got Whip, D boots legs d defender and d med and run Platebody, if anyone wants to do Barbarian HMU, im completely new to the minigame and have only watched tutorials so far. Want to farm my fighter torso
---
Weren't even smiting. Multi bots really are something else.
---
Don't forget the other requirements like defence
---
That's true, but I don't think using herb sack would lower the amount of herbiboar snags per hour by such an amount that ignoring the herbs is a good idea in the event of pet hunting.
---
I've had some back luck, 1k + dry as well as some lucky moments [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bej07h/best_task_of_my_life_and_im_not_even_done_yet/)
---
Holy shit
---
Indeed. For him it has turned into a serious addiction.
---
Learned is a perfectly acceptable use of the england language.
---
That's why it probably wouldn't change.
---
Wanting content to be changed to make sense with more modern skills is just my opinion and I don't think they'd ever even poll it.
---
I was sure I'd vote A but seeing B for the first time makes me reconsider.
---
That's gorgeous.
---
For any raiders that understand defense stats and Olm.
---
I have a 25 KC now on raids 1 with 99range/mage and 75/70/85def and 77 prayer. (Just going with a group of buddies as I’m a range tank generally that pvps mostly so don’t want to raise combat). 
---
Have close to bis mage w/ swamp and great range gear. Also a Z hasta and bgs for rooms needed. 
---
If we just trio/duo I just take the mage hand myself but sometimes also need to attack the left hand. 
---
Would maging or range be a better option for me even on on the melee weak hand? Anyone have an idea if that would make sense even with a better resistance to those on that hand? Mage bonus is usually 160s? With around 21%+ and also augury.
---
Photoshop is hard.
---
What’s the line for?
---
Ur mum suck
---
Why would you juggle ranarrs on a farm run? The leprechaun notes them
---
Prob used like 4m in supplies very very cheap
---
OP wants them to just develop and entire skill for us to test and reject.
---
I said I can't hear you.
---
Hahahah genius
---
I'm like 90% I did that quest on release and can't remember hating it, what was wrong with it?
---
Yea but it's better to melee them as range gear is hella soft
---
But if you only make robes then why can't it be called weaving or tailoring? Because they absolutely want the dissolving aspect.
---
I'm not against complexity or having multiple steps to a process, I just think it'd be better design to have cloth/silk drops from mobs/farming/hunter, and you make robes. No vis, no wards, no dissolving, just weaving robes.
---
Xp waste
---
I will still tweet him.

Mod ash how about that 22$ meme?

Yea 1.5m/h afk is pog

My awesome Photoshop skills when I cropped... ;\~;
---
Only a few dozen players on some U.S. servers at 4-7 am on a Wednesday? What a surprise!
---
This is exactly why poll results should be hidden. It is hard to influence people when you can't see how many votes are needed.
---
This is a great explanation
---
Get your prayer up to at least 43, preferably 50ish, then you can do barrows. Pretty much one of the simplest pvm activities.
---
I'm going in as soon as I hit 70 range just to try it, don't be a lil bitch
---
no u
---
it's shit mate, you gained atleast 420m just of the shards and your Setup costs like 10m or smth. Saradomin sword is trash compared to a bludgeon, you are using a fury instead of zenyte amulets, Dragon boots and proselyte man, how the fk is that not trash. Get some fucking Upgrades.
---
Well no I don't actually, I don't even play anymore and I am indifferent to warding.
---
It's reddit dude, they're all snowflakes when it comes to PKing. It takes a bit more skill than PvM and they can't handle the banter either, PK bad
---
Was playing on rustafied long but I joined later than everyone else so it was already end game and all that happened was just raiding and raiding moving loot etc got too rich I slowly stopped playing and mainly have been practicing on UKN to get back to my former level of gameplay
---
You can probably sell those coins for around 4.181k
---
Okay, but what offensive bonuses do the melee armors offer as compared to range and magic?
---
I got vorki after 1.6k kc and then sold gear and went to rune dragons was not disapointed.
---
 Yeah, the people who made Warding should just go back to their poverty-stricken, war-torn, corrupt countries!
---
What about the gear? I have whip and the cheapest armour possible. What should I aim for? Also is going for that quest that makes farming profitable worth it?
---
At least like 4 years lmao
---
My unpopular opinion is that UIM Karamja is better then Swamp man(both are very good) but I just like the Karamja scenery much more.
---
I made this statement on the original concept and it got heated, it just reminds me a lot of RS3 armor in the sense that it has 2 major colors that don't coincide due to color theory, 
---
and the fact that few **ARMORS** in osrs have 2 very different colors (most armors have a base color, then either highlights or small added effects, eg. justiciar, bcp, void, etc.).
---
again, that's just me though, it looks nice, but it also looks very "out there" in the sense that it probably won't look good with other items for fashionscaping
---
I’m using dead meme for my own pleasure
---
It changed everything, it's bis or 2nd bis at like half the bosses
---
asking you to provide a source as to who said firecape selling was legal is a weird question to ask...? dude lol what?
---
done caring about his series now.
---
just milked dry and a dude makes a video what, every 3 weeks?shits fucking lame
---
Aw it's too classic to be removed imo but it sure has become annoying.
---
Nice chart.
---
Scythe is also criminally overpowered
---
Did the Stronghold of Security teach you nothing? smh
---
If it was up to a simple majority this game would be filled to the brim with garbage
---
There isnt even proof lol stop tryna get clout
---
The cost of using it is quite big too and its also a bil
---
mit látsz?
---
Justiciar has like -40 mage and ranged attack, it's as melee as a set gets
---
Ewwww
---
I know but most people get the pet in less the. 600kc
---
Should be fairly easy to provide some examples then, I hope.
---
Perhaps it was a different account or rs3
---
Thank you!

I love this man

Eating purple sweets and ring of recoils are exciting?

Not really, these claims are just factually wrong. You may however try to find TD posts that are sexist against women, if there's any.

U don’t need points wildy slayer assignments are classed differently from normal slayer
---
How do we get into the beta?
---
Are there any good social PvM groups that aren't too noob-unfriendly? I'm getting to the point where I have the levels/gear for some endgame content like GWD and CoX (91 attack, 94 str, 90 attack, 91 range, 87 mage). My game knowledge is pretty weak to the point where I'm just starting to feel comfortable with Zulrah, so I'm kinda nervous about being dead weight with a bunch of unknown people since I don't know anyone IRL who plays OSRS.
---
It’s really bad, the picture isn’t even in the video it’s a thumbnail
---
Literally the first word of your comment was "lol". If you don't see how that doesn't come off as condescending I can't help you bud lmfao
---
They’re a certain skip if you’re training Slayer for xp
---
41 page blog, “hollow”
---
No
---
I guess I should’ve been more specific: Burying bones is the only way to train prayer in f2p
---
I mean sure but it's not like making money is hard with tob being well over 10m/hr and alts being allowed
---
Translation: "warding bad sailing good"
---
You could always just sell the gear afterward, and it can save you hours.
---
Are you dumb lmfao
---
He's simultaneously milking the series, yet not making videos regularly enough? Im not sure that makes sense but to each their own I suppose
---
It's not even like he has to keep the bludgeon as he can sell it after he's used it.. So weird
---
Cc: gloom scape
---
99 hunter, catching implings now, really interesting video again
---
That can't be, there's already a river connecting it to the sea.
---
Woah... that is it. You are comparing fucking old skills to new one and acting surprise when we have better standards. Don’t fucking compare it to another skill try to make it stand on its own
---
You can do that already. Just go get a fishing job
---
You can still use turael.
---
It gives no benefits to whacking stuff
---
That's like €1100,- cash.
---
Dress up like a jackass and kill the imp, I did that for 20+ minutes at a time without getting pkd
---
Haven’t been this excited for a video/episode in a long time
---
didnt ask
---
Need 16 alts to compensate for his 4
---
Man I love your shit so much, keep on doing what you doing!
---
&gt;!he's already had people scout implings for him!&lt;
---
Yea most players will be alive, I wonder if the game can live for 31 years tho.. that would be impressive
---
You gilded yourself didn't you
---
How serious of a clan are you looking for? IR (Intense Redemption) frequents revs on a regular basis, but you’ll need to attend weekend wars/pk trips in order to join/be a member. 
---
Otherwise, if you’re looking for a more laid back clan, then check out the website sharkbrew.
---
Check out swimming on fossil island as well, it's meta for agility + thieving training
---
Ok, there's a huge difference between an outfit that gives a 2.5% xp bonus compared to items that give a 100% xp bonus.  And my main point was, the game itself wasn't that fun and it felt like a chore because if you wanted to train something it was almost always worth while to get the items that doubled your xp.
---
The first few were good but then it became obvious that pewds hates it and doesn't find them funny
---
u mom gey
---
Yeah, very good argument for warding.
---
We got our 99's....but what did it cost?
---
98-99 is unimaginable for you in under a couple of months? Are you incapable of playing for longer than 10 minutes at a time?
---
"pewds"
---
please dont
---
Ayiza finally got his Bandos upgrade?
---
Not creepy at all...
---
lmao not really the same since when you wake up you didnt just take catastrophic physical damage and then wake up 2000 miles away completely better instantly

That’s because we managed to get rid of our bots crisis.
---
Over to you -&gt;
---
He probably did yes but even I’m the real world 1/6 people suffer from some form of depression. Lmao so no the rate for people playing RuneScape and having depresssiom is probably higher
---
Lmao sander, get over yourself. Du lukter fisk
---
Im of the opinion that a thematically coherent addition to mage armour sets/imbues/item sink that doesn't produce gold is a valid reason to add a new skill.
---
I'd love to see the hat you pulled those numbers out of by the way
---
Yeah exactly. If every despressed person had to go through support they would have to hire 20k people
---
not even close, you won't get any kills.
---
Everything you explained didn’t answer my question at all I asked how magic is overpowered you answered by saying hybrid lmao ...
---
Because the content can be added to Runecrafting and crafting..
---
If i had a few more days to play around and tweak things then sure i could have gotten something better, but honestly i dont think it would have come out better than the entry they chose =P
---
💀
---
he's gonna say bwana
---
I don't understand why you try to present them solving 2 huge issues with the game as something bad? It's objectively a good thing.
---
It's like you've already decided to dislike the skill and fill in your lack of arguments with shit opinions.
---
Do you want downvotes? Cause this is how you get downvotes
---
Tell that to my liver and walking up somewhere I don't recognize!

---

---
????? you miss the point of voting - you vote based on what you want??????????????????????
---
big question mark to you.
---
&gt;Also a cat would be nice to have.
---
I have some news for you .
---
pking is a part of the game where you do something interesting, and it is unpredictable and competitive, yet the majority hate that too. some people just wanna see the numbers go up
---
No u
---
what. dont project your life onto me.
---
but dw i have a good advice: search for a social chatting app in your app store. you may find some friends there, gl :)
---
That's.... Not how statistics work...
---
Most content creators / streamers account share.
---
Some are given specific builds to test for 'content'. They are a part of a special club though, probably the only fucking reason they removed it as an offence, to pander to the content creators
---
The f2p wiki uses the same ehp rates for all types of f2p ironmen (3820 xp/hour). That's based off essence mine -&gt; run to earth altar -&gt; Varrock teleport. This is the same for all 3 types of f2p ironmen.
---
However, regular and hardcore ironmen can get faster xp rates than that by farming air talismans via the drop trick at the start of Rune Mysteries and using them to make air tiaras, which is faster than the quoted ehp rates. The f2p wiki doesn't base ehp rates on this method because most f2p ironmen complete Rune Mysteries before finding out about this method. So in reality it's slower for UIM, but the ehp rates don't fully reflect that.

Something about Rendi's videos just doesn't grab me. He's had some good ones, but the most recent Mourning's End video was just kind of... eh? Can't tell what it is that I don't like, maybe they're a bit too long, maybe it's the same tick eating, maybe it's beating the Chestbrah meme a little too hard, I dunno. It's impressive as all-get-out, but I find them kinda boring. Swamp Man feels a bit fresher for some reason.
---
Shout out to Tedious's Generate Task ironman series, absolutely love that one.
---
I think the icon its self is cool its just the weird poh portal around it. If you took that off and just had the purple infinity logo it would be better. Another player suggested using a lamp as the icon as that's the tool used in the skill -  like crafting/smithing/construction does.

We should have an event/gamemode where every resource is limited.

GL bro! I enjoy grinding skills sometimes but this is different. Also look up 991atatime/shaynoh of YouTube he's doing the same thing, you could get some ideas from his vids :)
---
Exactly . Delete, or better - avoid vape shitters
---
Its actually Lynx Titan occupying his spare time
---
Literally none of the stealing creation items were that op. They would likely need to be reworked to be lower than they were, but let’s not act like that is any reason not to consider it
---
yup, that is the difficulty of balancing crafting skills in an MMO. It is pretty easy to incentivize skilling by making BIS things untradable. IMO ferocious gloves were a good example of this. They are not over the top OP compared to previous BIS melee gloves (which were already quest locked), but you can't just buy them at the GE. not everything BIS should have a requirement like this though, which is why it is difficult to balance.
---
Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuusss.  Finally someone agrees with me.

Apparently you don't read either. It will remove metal items and you didn't answer OPs question. Condescending jerk

Ok but why is there only a single cloud above the ge and not the rest of the world lol

Yeah I woox walk, no shield

I watch him for that content... I dont want a stupid news video of him killing werewolves. That literally had nothing to do with his account. Keep the editing to j1mmy he is actually entertaining with it. Swampletics whole series is around progressing I'd much rather watch him catch every single one of those lizards in a video than him doing some stupid skit for half the video. We have been waiting so long each video give us content not a polished turd.

This is what he'll look like when Warding actually passes a poll

This. Pretty sure NMZ herb boxes basically give free membership if collected daily

---
2 Reasons:
---
1) I read all the posts about it and truly do not think I would enjoy the content.
---
2) I'm sick of you pro-warders calling everyone who doesn't agree "anti-change neckbeards."  I want you all to cry when it fails.
---
Your first offense and only a few hours of NOT botting!? Outrageous
---
It’s fine for areas to be not often traveled. That’s kind of the point. They’re meant to be big and sprawling. There’s a purpose to having things that a player will only experience a couple of times in the game. Otherwise the whole game might as well just be a big series of rooms with different activities and monsters you can teleport between.
---
Big if true
---
What is impressive about any of his vids? Purple sweets poison and tons of alts, you've seen one you've seen them all

Both are harrassment.

Re-read the OP.  The guy insults the people he's questioning before he asks the question.  Screw him and all the immature pro-warders like him.

---
This is it boys, we’re in the endgame now
---
It is extortion. Look up the definition.
---
I will be voting yes.
---
Well I think crafting is already way too crowded. RC would make sense I think, but I imagine they would make xp rates for this worse than from doing normal RC. So in that case you've got high-ish level skilling content locked behind a shitty skill most player hate.
---
I dunno, I think there's no right answer here, but it is fun to discuss the options :)
---
That's sort of how economies work though, a good gold (or item) sink will affect the market as a whole , especially a gold sink specifically , because the value of gold changes as opposed to prices of items changing in a positive or negative direction
---
To point C, my entire point is that yes gathering resources can be fun but to actually train the skill you just stand at the bank is boring and something the game doesn’t need.
---
Check it out tho nerd, no one gives a fuck
---
you tell me idk, but it seems oum-asaiah is 1:1 slang for butthurt
---
I mean, all of the new content looks like RS3 graphics, because it's a natural evolution of art over the last 10~ years. Karuulm, Zeah, Raids, Fossil Island especially, all "look like RS3" because RS3 is literally just what Runescape looks like using modern art techniques.
---

Is COX drop rate working better in 2050??
---
The Golden gnomes nominations this year are insane.
---
Just cause you vote no for warding doesn't mean it won't enter the game though.
---
Regardless of how you vote, you should get the other part of your maxed cape back if they add it.
---
Sometimes the only way to save a persons life is to take away a bit of their freedom while you force them to get help.
---
While I don't think that's the case, I think this is a good illustration about how big changes are harder. If Jagex said "hey we're polling a rc/crafting expansion that lets you make a couple extra mage armors for mid levels" then people would probably be like "eh ok, kinda cool, good in some situations, go for it." But since warding, as a skill, should be fleshed out with high level content, if the entire skill just made mid-level armor then it would be as shitty as smithing. That would be monumentally stupid -- a skill released in 2019 having the same problems as one released in 2001.
---
Do some herb farming runs in betweem tasks to help with the gp loss of cannoning.
---
Why are you making such a high quailty content for this sub,  we don't deserve you.
---
You can be doing mid level bosses, you can start farming (it's easy and passive)
---
Please read my comment again. I stated something along the lines of "if it has an impact on the way you play the game". Pretty importsnt you don't ignore that point.
---
And yes, even if that only means there's a new source of magic clothing, price of mystic robes rises or whatever the consequence may be.
---
Many subs have a minimum karma requirement before you can make posts. Contributing through comments is a semi-decent way of accumulating the necessary karma to make posts.
---
I mean, calling everyone who disagrees with you stuff like "deplorables" and "neckbeards" has always won elections in the past, so I think people should be optimistic.

Try mixing in herb runs or bird houses runs between tasks, it’ll break up the slayer grind and help you recover some of the cost of cannonballs.
---
Nice man! Good luck! :)

Also, the blue paintings on the wall are too bright, stand out a lot and are way off-center. If you would have used a darker blue and blend it a little more to the wall, it would have been decent-ish.

And yeah, remove the diamonds and give the white fireholders texture and shadow; they look too clean and bright.

There are few methods:

a) checking music tab to see if you unlocked p2p music tracks (doesn't always work though, you can train prayer with chaos altar without unlocking p2p music track)

b) logging on rs3 and checking solomon's store to see if you got loyalty points that you only get if you have membership
---
c) use crystal math labs to see if you got more xp/h than normal for f2p
---
completely unused spells, I would support a buff
---
Most pkers that I’ve spoken too don’t understand why it’s being nerfed, along with myself. If only the logical pkers were to be able to speak out about PvP and what needs updating, then maybe people would listen to us
---
Fire cape is absolutely doable with 61 ranged using rune crossbow and diamond+ruby bolts, it just takes a bit longer. 75 ranged and a blowpipe would speed things up a lot.
---
The best boss you can start with is barrows. You could get lucky or unlucky, but that's with everything and barrows is a pretty good entry dip into PVM. You could try KBD but I'd recommend higher ranged for that as well. With higher mage and ranged you could attempt duo DKs if you had a higher level willing to take you. Eventually you'll get to the various GWDs and finally raids. All of these have gradually increasing stat bars and with everything you'll perform better with higher stats.
---
For anything you do, I'd recommend training ranged and mage up a bit, and then your melees.

It's not that the attacks hit through prayer, rather on the mage phase it'll randomly throw in some range attacks, which are annoyingly accurate and hit hard. Makes sense or you would eat practically no food.

he just does videos that other people already did and usualy worse then original ect.
---
&gt;Um.. did infusing crystals destroy RC xp rates? Nope?
---
purely because of buy limits on GE, if you could obtain a lot of them it's miles ahead of the other training methods including the now nerfed ZMI with runners.
---
get 75 crafting for slayer rings, then just go on a slayer grind.  
---
set yourself a slayer level goal. and a long the way when you unlock monsters that make money IE gargoyles, nechs, abby demons go ahead and camp them for a day or so. it makes it more interesting.  this will help with your combat  stats as well. also go for 70 prayer. piety is a must have. 
---
have you thought about hard diaries? DS2? the new spider boss?

lots of things to do.

By that logic shouldn't jagex be refining older skills instead of introducing another one?

Pull up the rotations right next to your game, even better if you have dual monitors. Some find it helpful to only learn one rotation at a time, if it's not the one your comfortable with tele out. And as others said, ring of suffering is basically a must, recoils if you can't afford it.

People do lava / astral running, the price vary but experienced lava runners USUALLY cost 7-8m per runner, 2m less for beginner lava runners and astral 4-5m/h per runner, 1m less for beginner astral runners.

Good suggestion - need to get into NMZ I guess
---
definitely recommend 75+ for blowpipe, it is an absolute gamechanger for the fight caves.
---
When you can die in one hit to the boss, the difference between an hour to do the caves and 2 hours is honestly too big to put into words.
---
Seeing as your username is crippling depression people really shouldn't expect optimistic views from you.
---
I agree with alot of your points. i just don't think 25 hours of gameplay is enough to understand "old school" runescape, even if you play(ed) rs3 its very different. Like i said subject to change 1200 may be too high but my idea is 1200 total would understand enough to know whats good and bad for the life of the game. 25 hours of gameplay surely is not enough time to know.
---

I’m really glad you’re using OSRS as material to improve
---
Idk which is better on melee hand but if you have a handicap that significant, you probably need to adjust the way the whole team works around it i.e. have the runner scoot to melee side when possible or even straight up have 2 guys on melee hand for a while.
---
buh mah ironcat!
---
seriously he was always influencing the game, i remember when i raised him on first 99 str in OSRS he even had a head start and me and other guy took him over and raced againts each other, remember him even back then bitching on stream "how i am probly doing something else or botting"
---
i did exat same thing he did, bandits with prot melee lol.
---
I know, but you still need to get 2k first to even get access.
---
ah, the peak of runescape pvp videos. 2009-2011/2012ish  where it was overedited and it was always edgy rock music. 
---
miss those days. tried looking for similar osrs pvp vids the other day, no one makes that type of content anymore. 
---
now its all progress/ commentary stuff
---
I could be wrong, but I think you need the key to get to the mithril veins.  So you do have to kill the boss.
---
Even if its possible he may not be able to.. I would just like to know its actually possible
---
Definitely the highest quality in terms of effects and art that we see.
---
Still pretty hard to argue against Settled though overall.
---
sarachnis just needs a good crush weapon and protect from range. 
---
she will bind you up and won't close the gap every time if you are away from her, so when adds come you take them across the room to smack them down with protect range on, then go back to her and protect melee until she scurries off again.
---
thanks for all the suggestions, very helpful! I might give barrows a try this weekend and see how it goes, train up ranged a bit to make fire cape easier
---
Range is the most powerful corner of the combat triangle
---
Check out caveman only also, cool content and great production quality in videos IMO, he has two uniquely limited Ironman modes rn which are interesting.
---
Calling him a content creator is a stretch already.
---
Why the fuck would you kill 10k demonic gorillas without Arclight?
---
Non degrading alone is a massive factor. Even if repair costs are fairly minor, it's an annoyance most people would rather avoid. It's also important to keep in mind this is craftable armor and will thus not be very expensive, compared to Ahrim's at 4m with continued upkeep cost. Imagine if black dhide had better defenses across the board than Karil's for only a small accuracy difference.     
---
Soulbark body has literally more than double the slash defense of Ahrim's, and each piece has a prayer bonus as well. Drastically higher defenses for only 11 less overall magic bonus.    
---
And then in cases where your accuracy is all that matters and you don't need the defense, say safespotting or praying melee, you'd be using probably the Dagon'hai set anyway, not Ahrim's, which ALSO has a prayer bonus over Ahrim's.    
---
There is just a massive imbalance basically across the board in these sets. I like the ideas, absolutely, but there's seemingly no thought put towards current magic equipment.
---
With all the controversies surrounding it there's no way in hell it passes a 75% poll

Saw something similar to this suggested a while back called [Grand Theft Gielinor](https://redd.it/7vpzen). This would be a pretty cool way to train thieving if implemented as thieving just involves clicking nonstop until you get carpal tunnel.
---
28m/h for 4 lava runners and u get 170-200k xp/h.
---
I mean if it was only 100% one time, is it really 100%?
---
I kind of agree but that seems like a flaw with most crafting systems that are possible in the bank system of RS.
---
Currencies regularly change value, it's not something which is worth doing (to create a consistent value).
---
They'll change prices if they range too far out, but it's out of their hands.
---
You have to pay for rigour. You will eventually get 99 range regardless. Get rigour.

Not a matter of policy- but there's been times my membership has lapsed &gt;2 weeks and Ive contacted Jagex and they were nice enough to reinstate it for me.  
---
No idea what the maximum cut off is, or if it's because I've had a nearly continuous sub since 2004/2005 but I went AWOL after EoC came out till when OSRS came out (although I started a bit later than the release date).    
---
I know we give Jagex a lot of crap over customer support but they've been kind to me and it's nice to see.  Now I just wish we could transfer that grandfathered rate to a new account (It's currently on my old main and I play an ironman) but it's peanuts- I can use the old main to make money and between the 5 and 8 (premier) I'm paying less than a sub for WoW and I'm okay throwing them that extra money.

Did you report this incident in game ? If you did we will already be aware of it. If you didn't please call your local Police to report it. Tell them they can contact us for details on the player and chat logs if they need them by emailing lawcontact@jagex.com, we will respond within a few minutes of receiving a genuine request.

Please note that that email address is primarily (if not only) for verified law enforcement. Contact the police and they'll contact Jagex.

Since always. It's been pretty well known amongst F2P players,  but mostly member players don't seem to know or care that it's F2P.
---
I really *love* debuffing (and buffing) in games. I don't know why, but I just find it to be so much more fun than any other role. So I've always been kind of sad that runescape has the foundations of a good debuffing system but with no practical use. Especially with warding (probably) coming out, I would love to see how curses can in some way be buffed through equipment or new skills or adjustments to existing spells. 
---
As an addendum, I'd also love for the Heal spells to have any use outside of jank multi-account stuff. I don't think that Runescape should be balanced around having some "Tank, DPS, Healer" setup like in other games, but I'd love at least the *option* to be this "healer" (or "debuffer") even if it's not the most optimal strat. The best way I can see this being implemented is equipment sets that may have low magic offense stats but have bonuses to specific "spell types".

---
Yeah the void is worse than ahrim's/d'hide but requires fewer switches so you can focus on Zulrah. Unfortunately the best way to learn is to just jump in there and keep trying. Good luck
---
The game looks like shit. It was made in 2007. It's fun, I play it a ton, but it looks like shit. Nothing in OSRS has ever gave me the urge to sit and admire it. I've never taken a screenshot of landscape in OSRS, or a screenshot of my character. The game is ugly, and no amount of aesthetic sprucing up will change that.
---
I think adding new skills and item sinks to the game is very important for it's future. Warding handles both.

Same, but with full anglers

Isn't there an auto typer built into the actual osrs chat?

Saw that one. Loved it. There were some great little easter eggs in there.
---
Smithing rework when?

I know and he blocks you if you point out that he’s straight up stealing people’s content and not giving them any credit, but he has 1k+ followers and any tweet he makes that isn’t lifted from Reddit gets at most 4 likes.
---
Suddenly Modest Mouse starts playing in my head like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2qgEl4KWB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2qgEl4KWB4)
---
Oh, I didn't realise the Post button is greyed-out. That's odd. Try using the desktop website instead and see what happens. The official app can be really patchy.
---
Ooo that'd be interesting, maybe like some sort of curse that you cast on one monster and it becomes aggressive towards any other monster
---
His salary at his current job is also guaranteed to be beyond what jagex employees make, so yea, but no.
---
Thats why you gotta aggressively advertise absolutely everywhere
---
I don't know about level 77+ stuff or whatever, but it's the combination of extremely slow rates with being very click intensive with inventory management and running around.
---
For me, doing lavas even though not that hard just feels like a ton of effort for pennies.
---
Agility and mining seem to be the next most criticized but mining is less click intensive (and has far better rates iirc, I only got 72 mining so I'm not sure) and agility is equally click intensive but better rates (again iirc, I could be wrong) and no inventory management. Plus, you get those dopamine hits every graceful token drop.
---
It's all subjective, but for me doing an hour of runecrafting feels worse than an hour of anything else I mentioned.
---
pretty sure its "The Flower Duet from 'Lakme'"
---
People also liked it. I want Konar's hair on my character.
---
If you’re Walter White-ing is right now...
---
You'd think it rhymes with Bourgogne. [No one at Jagex knows for sure though](https://youtu.be/kFM6RSCzPgI?t=19)
---
Not to mention if you do herb runs, allotments, etc you'll be constantly busy unless you have a really efficient method of getting around.  Throw in birdhouses it felt like I had no time to do anything else lol
---
you can only craft them if you have ds2 done, which has many skilling reqs
---
I agree it benefits ironman accounts. But if it is anything similar to RS3 than I know it will help. It’ll take things that no one has use for that are worth nothing and when you dissolve them you get valuable things to raise your warding skill. For example a leather coif, or mithril armor, if you dissolve it to get sort of unique warding items then they’ll be more sought after, therefore increasing their value. 
---
I don’t think I’m totally right this is just my line of thinking.
---
download more ram, it will help
---
Wildy is cheaper, poh is more afk. I did 99 with ensouled dragon heads. Slightly cheaper than poh and more afk than wildy altar. And you get some magic and combat xp.
---
Hm, I like this. I think I see what you're saying, but can you elaborate more? I'm struggling to understand exactly what the idea is, but I want to know.
---
Mod West did the Hosidius rework, IIRC? I think pretty much everything on Zeah looks similar to RS3, though I don't think it's a bad thing.
---
Ikr! I had this same thing when I wrote the jmod name as Wealth and someone else on the sub corrected me :D was shocked
---
Might want to do something besides a gmauler, but Gz on pet either way!
---
you are a very angry person
---
I would say Rendi and Swampletics are about the same level of quality tbh
---
I used to play ors when I was a kid, (not saying its a kids game I just dont play it anymore) and seeing my favorite line of movies mixed in 1 is absolutely amazing. Thank you for taking the time to create this, keep up the good work man!
---
spend it all on buyable skills
---
Im not sure, is it? If so, where can I find this function?
---
Complete farm outfit here o/
---
99 prayer when?
---
Warding is a production skill without a gathering counterpart. This thematically doesn't fit with the other production skills. The reasoning as to why it doesn't fit, is the reliance on other skills for out-of-universe reasoning (item sink). The true purpose then, is to create a skill for the sole purpose of creating an item sink (like construction, so not unique). My position is that this could be done thematically better. That is not an overreaching opinion, nor am i getting hung up on unimportant details. As mentioned in this thread i feel as though straying away from the established form of a game, thematically or aesthetically could lead to an undesirable game. A failed game. A game whose lost its identity. This is a serious concern for those who enjoy their time playing.
---
I guess we'll have to wait and see, but if the players want it, then yes, it will be forced down your throat
---
what world?
---
F
---
Lmfao I'm not surprised
---
Should have snapped 100% of people splashing in lumbridge
---
Something like that sure
---
This happened to me a few months ago so ever since then I tell myself rhyme since it's easy to remember: 
---
Inventory red, you're a fucking idiot
---
I have a car, therefore I won't pick up a dollar bill?
---
Curses miss too often and don't have enough impact.  Using them wastes time that you could have been attacking. On top of that they use odd runes requiring you to waste inventory space.  Recommended changes include adding a base reduction (IE 3 levels) along with a percentage, or increasing the percentage.
---
Well nmz is slowely being deleted but I doubt they would delete a skill.
---
It had a small community that played it actively just for fun, I was one of them and I think I had around 300K points by the time I quit the game, this minigame was all I did the last 3-4 years I played original rs.
---
Doing some quick maths those points would be around 4000 hours played if I'm not mistaken :p from what I remember you would gain up to 26 points per game and averaged 24 is my guess per 20 minute game.
---
Then again as much as I loved that minigame I don't think it should be added or at the very least not the rewards, and in the current game with "efficiency scape" and all, if there isn't a good reward it probably won't be played much now.
---
And if there is a worth-while reward it'll lead to those no fun clan worlds and feel like a chore like fishing trawler, then again I'd rather have this than fishing trawler lol.
---
Is this what we're doing now that we've hidden poll results?
---
No ferocious gloves? Barely 8500 imo
---
honestly this is why i hate doing tree runs, then it does that shit where it regrows itself and you need to cut it down again.
---
Welp. If it's in RS3, gotta downvote this post.
---
Item sink yes. New skills is an awful idea.
---
I was about to upvote you, but i would be the 70th.
---
Oooh. I was not aware of that as I have the quest cape :) thank you for the information fren.
---
Ass*
---
Runelite has a chat filter plugin, find a good regex and it'll remove 90% of the spam
---
Dont care about Seerz but its an opinion not a rumor lmao
---
I still don't get the point of sailing.  I know a lot of stuff in OSRS is pretty pointless but- it's like making running a skill and it would, arguably, have less functionality than running/agility would.
---
Crafting is already quite bloated, RC exp rates are too sensitive.
---
what a little fucking cutie, raccoons are just cats with bandit masks on, change my mind.
---
It's a potion in rs3, so technically it's new.
---
I mean it's basically free considering he can sell it back after using it
---
It definitely wasn't f2p when it was released, because I remember thinking it would be super useful once I was a member but it wasn't
---
Thanks haha
---
thx, because people don't like my setup/gear
---
I'd say go for tassets-&gt;prims-&gt;bandos chestplate
---
If only he had heard flute salad distorted.
---
Right click public chat
---
He didn't only get banned though. He botted, got banned for it and then vehemently claimed that he shouldn't have been banned, even though this wasn't even his first offense. 
---
I'm obviously not saying that he deserves the hate or that it isn't wrong, but if I leave my house open on vacation I also don't deserve to be robbed and it's still wrong, but I still messed up myself.
---
 He put himself out there, asked for reach to get himself unbanned and was then detected to be lying. I don't have much sympathy for him.
---
On that note though, I obviously don't condone or support any serious threats of violence and harassment.

---
A vote fore warding is a vote for pados.

OSRS3 Sounds pretty nice the way I'm envisioning it.
---
No MTX
---
No EoC
---
Loads of bosses, lore, and quests 
---
Motherfucking DUNGEONEERING (before a half assed EoC adjustments)
---
A beautiful soundtrack that never gets enough credit.
---
All the minigames we shitpost about daily that we wish we had in OSRS like stealing creation, Fog and soul wars.
---
Jagex why cant you make this game?
---
Ah! Thank you for telling me! I still a total noob and I'm trying to get back into this game.
---
I skip all afk tasks so your point is invalid
---
Where? I dont see an ash tag anywhere
---
Don't think the "snake" charmer would have had a girlfriend
---
Community: Poll results should be hidden!
---
Jagex: -hides poll results-
---
Community: Fuck, go back!
---
The fact is that new skills should not be added to the game. No matter what skill. No new skills belong in osrs. Go to rs3 for that and osrs will just get more and more from rs3 and will literally be called rs3v2 soon. In 5 years people will make a petition to have jagex release OSRS again because it's gone.
---
Are you using runelite? It has some smoothing features
---
I would prefer either having a brand new 'curses and hexes' skill, similar to prayer. Or, rework the arceus spellbook to use curses and hexes
---
Now get some tree roots, someone's hand and a heart, and just rub them all over that thing for more power.
---
how can I remove my skull? I thought going in and out of clan wars removed it.
---
Trips to DKS. Sitting behind that ladder would be great. I hate waiting for it to Regen normally.
---
Just make an new account lul.

You click the Fill option on the Herb Sack and takes all grimy herbs from your inventory and places it inside the Herb Sack with a max of 30 of each herb. You can also Use a grimy herb onto the bag to deposit that single herb. You can also click the Empty option to empty out the contents into your Inventory. With the Bank open, you can Empty the herbs directly into the bank, while the Herb Sack is in your inventory.
---
Oh fucc
---
This is the official 1

Which is strange, because the song is about frustration between the heart and brain contradicting each other emotionally and rationally resulting in conflicted suicide... which in my opinion is my whole understanding of Runescape PVP as a whole.
---
No it was definitely the copper one because she didn't want anything messing with her hormones. I've been unlucky 3 kids and 3 times shes been on different contraptions responsibly my sperm must have 99 strength
---
You can’t use the trident in pvp
---
Give it a go! Lots of people like them, lots don't! You'll never know until you try! :)
---
Listen, I was taught this by a 5’6” Greek, size doesn’t matter. You just whip that MF’er out and smack it right down in front of them while you stare into their souls like a chimpanzee. If they aren’t soaking wet within seconds they are fucking gay.
---
Only time its annoying is multi area.
---
But i disagree no need to be even more afk
---
Yet the world feels really "empty" at most places. Adding random people like this would fill it up much more. Like when I travel between varrock and falador, two supposedly huge cities, on the main road I meet what, 4 other travelers?
---
That's a funny way to spell Coil.
---
humor
---
Catch me tweaking off 20 stamina pots i havent slept in 4 days. I'm seeing shades in my poh out the corner of my eye

Like 4-6 hours if your rng is as bad as mine.

Yeah go to sleep not answering you, your view of the game is dangerous to it's future

DON'T YOU TAKE SLAYERMUSIC AWAY FROM US.
---
This reddit is full of noobs who dont pk and dont have good accs
---
They take the hit by going for the aggression. So it's more like "kodai vs bulwark".
---
To actually explain, grades (atleast In america) have a specific weight to them. Like a 94-100 would be an A or a 4.0 , so if you average all A's then you have a gpa of a 4.0. All the grades have a set value which just rounds to the scale. It's really just a "simplified" version of a 0-100 grade scale.
---
New players that don't know the history of the game are a danger to the game. Literally the only people that will vote yes are the new people that came with mobile release.
---
Brendan Schaub, is that you?
---
Would it not be a good idea if we could retrieve lost graceful pieces for a small fee. Like we could insure them beforehand maybe
---
What's the reference?
---
wow, you got the angler gloves that quick? that's crazy good RNG, dude
---
Nice. Could also add some wavy-shaped wires to give that crinkle effect.
---
Just a new mod engaging with players while roleplaying my username.
---
After tutorial island you’re pretty much free to do whatever you want. Go skill, fight, or do some quests! The f2p quests are a great start to learning the map. I’d mix in combat whenever you feel as well.
---
They called him a mad man
---
You can configure notifications in runelite so that you don't even have to look at your screen until you need to do something.
---
Notify on low health, low prayer and highlighted drops (highlight a runite bar).
---
Gpa is out of 4 for whatever reason. So 4.0 = 100%
---
Oh right thanks for the explanation
---
my first big one was 75, then camped gargs for a few mil.
---
then i went for 85 for abby demons
---
i was 98 strength when i got it. I then decided to camp abby demons from 98-99 str (mostly for nostalgia)  and got like 9 whips making over 20m. I am now 90 almost 91 slayer  and itching to do cerb.
---
its all just progression, just set goals and make sure to smell the flowers along the way.
---
id still highly suggest slayer rings/ piety it makes slayer more fun/quicker and easier thus you will be more motivated to play. flashing on that piety for big specs is always fun too
---
Then why is nobody laughing?
---
grammer bad
---
Lol yeah, i play for 15 years and im gonna vote yes, go to a private server if you want a game without progress
---
She risking 6m, soooooo. Kill her.
---
I’m 600kc with my only drop being a magma mutagen
---
It's not well explained on purpose, the idea is that you get immersed in the big world and just go exploring and figure stuff out. I would recommend questing, as it will open the world up and give you exp to level up skills, in some cases jumpstarting you from levels 1-30 in certain skills. You can find an efficient order to do them in on the wiki but if you're completely new, I would just do what seems appealing or start with the F2P quests as they are constrained to a smaller area and will be easier.
---
You shut the fuck up this game will exist until the day i die. If the servers shut down I'll just play ironman offline.
---
I think itd take years
---
Because swampman is cursed with knowledge.
---
Have fun. P.S. mr no sleep has a loot from 100k gobos idk if u seen.
---
Priff gets added.
---
Players without braincells: We want content! Give skill!
---
It’s pretty open as to what to do in the game.  You can do a lot of things, from skilling, to combat, and questing.  I’d recommend questing at the beginning if you are looking for some purpose.  If you talk to some of the NPCs in Lumbridge, they can direct you to some early quests.
---
I see. Thanks for the answer
---
im sorry to hear you had dial-up until 2010
---
Why out of 4?
---
Show me a clip of someone dying for max to a one itemer with a gmaul. It doesn't happen.

Wait wait wait. Other youtubers arent stuck in a swamp doing very inefficient skill grinds

Runecrafting.  Most amount of gp for a low level. Might as well start farming and bird house runs as well
---
Reason 1 why I wont do it.
---
Fuck purple
---
time to break out the camtasia free software and sony vegas.... lol
---
Why switch to astrals?
---
No problem! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, I've been playing since about 2005. Assuming you're a member, you should be able to do any step on a beginner or easy clue. You may run into some hiccups on mediums, but those are ultimately pretty easy too.
---
Can we just get OSRS VR or a OSRS styled WASD MMO? Honestly if Jagex kept it exactly 2007 styled + content wise, I’d totally play something like “World of Gielnor”.
---
Hard leather body is missing.
---
Zanaris is one of the moon's of osrs.
---
Ive never seen it. Im new to OSRS and haven't played since my childhood.

Everything

Find something to afk and make money while you research quests and things you want to do. Make a plan and start inching towards it, but building your bank will make things a lot easier in the long run. This was the biggest challenge for me after returning after a few years was to do Monkey Madness 2 and Dragon Slayer 2, but I've made a lot of money as a result.
---
Time for revs

I got the drunken dwarf during the maze of me2. I will never be able to repay my mate.

What software do you use to edit your videos? I'm also interested in learning... eventually.

Rip slayermusiq
---
I see. This makes sense, thanks.
---
In one of the bank scenes it looks like all the bots survived the snap while all the players got gotted.
---
&gt; I am absolutely certain that if polls started off as hidden, we would demand for them to be shown in suspicion of rigging.
---
You have no idea how easy it is to rig polls, whether the 'current votes' are shown or not.
---
New player here
---
Combat stats are 70atk/61str/61def
---
Slayer 48
---
All other skills 30 or below
---
I just got a wilderness slayer task for 50 revenants
---
How hard is this both PVM and PVP wise? I know very little about the revenant caves but they seem like a PKer hot spot
---
Lol acoustic? Are you restarted?
---
dont bet on fakes
---
Still not as bad for the music cape as that stupid-ass clue expansion update.

Based purely off of what needs to happen in order to create pregnancy, I’m gonna go ahead and say there’s a 0% chance between everyone in this sub

Here's a VOD of the process for anyone interested in taking a closer look.
---
Literally everyone in this comment thread is ripping on OP's gear, and I'm sitting here wondering why the fuck anyone even gives a shit?
---
Go kill 10k gorillas yourself in more "efficient" gear and be happy about it. OP clearly had fun doing this.
---
He already said that he would not be doing warding if it came out
---
Will have to try it out. Thanks.
---
Counting macine lmao
---
Kurasks are a god awful task unless you're a low level ironman. Can't burst/barrage, can't cannon, and can't use a good weapon.
---
I think instead of disabling the use of the potion that the curse should work like overloads in raids. You can chug stat boosting potions and still use brews and such but the curse will just set that stat back to the reduced amount over and over until it wears off.
---
Only played soccer for 15 years but y'know oh well
---
That’s why you never put your name or real info in a google account lol. I always use my spoof info for any sign up
---
Again, how? I picked blue because it's my favorite color. Not because other people pick it
---
Get 75 range for blowpipe and work on the fire cape. Also work on slayer. You are nearly to the good gp/task levels.
---
Your ring pretty much accounts for 75% of your setups worth lol
---
What do you mean? It's only been two hours!
---
watched a bulwark guy get chased down and mauled to death last night. I was running around with an inv full of bank trash because I find it funnier to get pked for my unneeded stuff then to just throw it on the floor someplace and I saw the chase down happening. ran in with the group of pkers and got a prop sword hit in on the bulwark guy (it was a 0). I got frozen and stabbed to death but also got to witness the same thing happen to shield man. cool times.
---
Is this real Undertale music? I never played it but I heard the music is amazing and that Kamil track is fire
---
I'm not that active during the summer, they could have done any time this week,or like last weekend
---
I guess people actually do it for the xp. The main activities I can think of that aren't very useful outside of getting the outfit are fishing trawler and temple trekking. Trawler is still minimally active, I think, but I'm pretty sure  temple trekking is dead for non ironmen
---
Try EV scapes guide on YouTube. He takes you through it live. You just keep trying until you are on the same rotation as him. I did that over and over with each rotation until I had it memorized
---
NoooooooOOOOOO! Slayermusiq1!@!$!@@$@! :///
---
Because it reminds me of world of warcraft.
---
Got 99 range and fletching, worth it every gp
---
That's only way to rebuild
---
I kind of agree. I have put mine in my poh and just forget about them.
---
get out of here with your commie bs, not everything needs to be taxed to shit
---
What’s is the book on slot 2?
---
Definitely. As someone who is low combat, I’ve found that now my new grind is just being forced in a way to get my combat level high. Without it I’ll just be getting mediocre money. The only good money you can even make now is from PK’ing, bosses, and slayer. Unless you literally want to spend 12 hours a day grinding a boring skill you already have 99 in, like cutting magic trees
---
Lmao retirement good one
---
Splashing mage in lumby
---
thanks!
---
warding won't pass
---
You have to be pretty thick to think hiding the poll results would've made any difference to rigging polls.
---
It just seems too extreme, you can choose to give said beggar money or not. Theres also ignore options, begging should not be punishable. We were all broke af at one point in our osrs career.
---
Clan leader btw
---
Except it's not easier but go on.
---
Ditto.
---
I think you commented on the wrong thread?
---
Yeah I don’t even want my twitter associated with runescape opinions. I don’t use twitter regardless, but I doubt my friends would enjoy seeing me bitch to mods about my opinion all the time.
---
I have moved to wizard tower
---
He meant "beta" icon, as "not release version" warding icon.
---
Nice try FBI
---
What’s your current level? Just do it, the graceful set is worth it
---
&gt;then 
---
Than. You're comparing two things.
---
Literally not how it works at all but whatever
---
That’s why he’s her ex
---
Slayer dungeons, slayer master, runecrafting dense essence, new spell book, different way to train prayer, wintertodt, farming guild, hespori, etc.
---
I always welcome new quests. They one of the things what makes this game so great.
---
Let's hope so. If you ask me, a vote for warding is a vote for pados.
---
No fuck shit?
---
Say no more!
---
46 damage a minute, yes that’s a huge difference.  This is why basic math is important.
---
I did it on my btw too. Took me 4:49. Fuck Iban's staff sucks at moneysnek.
---
I see you, GCHQ
---
Shit act nerd
---
As could fletching/crafting, runecrafting/magic.
---
Skill tab being ruined may get the award for the least convincing argument to date though
---
Sorry it doesn’t compare to your maxed uim
---
Can’t wait to go around to calling players wearing full abyssal noobs. I mean it’s 2025 at least get full demonic. I bet they don’t even have elven prayers unlocked yet.
---
So you’re saying we should automatically believe that people didn’t get banned for actually doing the offence? Because we rarely see evidence provided that they weren’t breaking the rules.
---
Civil warding
---
Just let him be. If stuff like that actually has real world consequences people are going to feel less comfortable talking about it
---
Mimic is a 1/15 chance from Master Clues and it took me 29. I feel your pain, but it did make the cape more uncommon.
---
I haven't done the math but it doesn't save that much time to have the RoW pick up coins for you. Your profit/hr would be higher with a zerker ring because you can kill more gargs each hour. it's good for afking but you're losing more on wasted alchable drops than coins.
---
Dont forget how he complained about the drop table without even having done konar slayer himself
---
:( post history
---
Imagine telling a person with a serious mental disease contemplating suicide to “keep his personal life to himself”
---
like as though people with depression don’t already severely isolate themselves from society.
---
The mere mention that they are suicidal even on an anonymous internet platform is a rare glimpse at them opening up about literally anything.
---
Did you factor in each lamp give you more or less xp based off the level? Just wondering
---
personally I think all those skills are fine, crafting in particular is very useful
---
I don't really understand your comment are you for or against warding?
---
it was a joke my guy
---
Well I mean the standard book spell already has tb, god spells, are the useful tps, high alchs, etc.
---
I mean we don't want redundancy so if we're gonna buff the curse spells  I rather just add newer stronger curse spells to the Arceeus spellbook because that one is clearly lacking more.
---
give us the sauce!
---
Yeah it can get pretty confusing with all the rules at times, but that’s part of what makes it unique and different then the 1000 other Ironman series that exist
---
It’s just like one of the only things you can’t buy on any account. I don’t actively seek them out cuz I think that would be insane, but it’s awesome getting that little message in the chat box along with a little fella popping out. Losing one would feel soooo fucking stupid because you didn’t insure it.
---
Try r/ironscape for ironman tips/tricks and discussion!
---
You're not really supposed to take drugs while pregnant so I think RuneScape as a whole is off the table. Sorry mate.
---
Ncie
---
That's pretty good dude
---
Some people hit 12h+
---
$20/month for the HD toggle and I'm game. Otherwise, I do not want them spending a full year doing nothing but that.
---
I was really mad at myself on Monday because I forgot to swap to Excalibur after flinching the Black Knight Titan for 8 minutes while doing Holy Grail on my iron. 
---
This makes me feel much, much better.
---
if verzik is on you when this happens you should pray melee
---
you got any other skills at 200m? or was fishing your first.
---
You can set your banking option to ‘all’ and just left click it ?
---
why does it desperately need a new skill? are you just after a new counter to tick up from 1-99? 
---
thats an ok reason to be in favor of a new skill, i just disagree and dont think we need it.
---
I get like 1-2 every tree run
---
Even if this were feasible, and even if there was a lot of interest, I think most people would still want to stick with RuneLite. 
---
Maybe not everyone, but I’m sure that to many people, even HD graphics wouldn’t be incentive enough to downgrade to the official client.
---
I like your joke you posted last year better

Bone yard in wild is meta I believe
---
Any enemy with a magic level of 1 can be easily killed with magic in almost any gear.
---
In this case minotaurs also have negative magic defense, making it even easier

The fact is that jagex doesn't own shit to you or anyone else, they're a company and the amount of work they put into making us happy is something to be proud of look at any actually big company and you'll see how little they give a fuck about peoples opinions, the system's fucked but that's because of the community that has a small portion of autistic (not actually, although some actually autistic people are probably autistic in this sense too, but no shade on those people) people who voice their opinions the loudest. The average player isn't a god at the game but that also means there's no reason for the average player to have any visibility, you don't want to watch someone who's basically you do something.
---
I genuinely wouldn't mind them removing the polls, I genuinely trust people in the dev team to make good decisions, the problem is that I don't trust the people who give the devs their salary and at the end of the day if one of those guys want to fuck up the game they most likely will.
---
Good day
---
Yea it’s really obvious. I think people legit think that Pkers kill you because they want your spade.
---
Well I respond to almost every comment, thanking people for their feedback.
---
But I did receive a lot of hate and targetted harassment from one (or a few) people on this sub and all of their alts who brigade to downvote me, telling me that all my ideas are literal trash, telling me I'm not a game developer and therefore I shouldn't feel the need to suggest anything.
---
The interesting thing about OSRS is that many players have been playing it in some form for over a decade. Myself? Almost 18 years, on and off. Players understand the spirit, the feel, and the patterns of the game almost better than the developers do. They've put in the playtime that developers haven't, the exploration and the iteration of content over and over. Players, in my opinion, have great ideas for OSRS. And they shouldn't be afraid to showcase them just because they aren't a developer. Having the title of developer doesn't make you a good idea fairy. Just because the developers make something, doesn't mean it's a good idea. People here worship the developers as experts but truthfully, the players are even more expert at figuring out OSRS than the developers, in many cases. That's why so many cases of Bug Abuse and other mechnical shenanigans occurs in this game. The point I'm making is that, I've decided that maybe players DO deserve as much of a shot at designing content for a game that they've literally played their entire life, rather than a half-hearted developer who only pushes out dull and unpolished ideas that only look fancy.
---
Yeah I would love an OSRS3, we can keep moving forward with this version of OSRS and have less players whining for updates from a shitty era of Runescape
---
They actually do now in a lot of places
---
After they added the alch warning for untradables it transferred to drop too
---
Assuming he just got it, looks like he has many more 200M skills.
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
Right, I see. Many people have suggested moving them to a revised Arceuus Spellbook, which is also a great idea.
---
Because A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1 and F=0
---
0-4 allows for the 5 possible grades
---
The graceful hurts although you did go rainbow so at least when you get it back you can fix that mistake. Either way sorry man gl hope you do a hard clue and get some 3a
---
Works fine for me.
---
It’s definitely not as responsive as using a desktop client (there’s no sort of visual indication that you’re switching worlds, other than the game freezing up for a couple of seconds). But the functionality is there.
---
This is my full run order:
---
Weiss, Trollheim, Hosidius, Ardougne, Camelot(or Catherby tele), Falador, Port Phasmatys, Monastary, Skills Necklace to Farm Guild - Castle Wars, Entrana, Yanille, N.Lumb, Seers NW
---
Starting Gear/Inv:
---
Graceful, Magic Secateurs, Xeric, Explorer, Chronicle, Explorer Ring
---
Seed Box(Toadflax, Snap, Watermelon, Limpwurt, Yanillian), Spade, Seed Dibber, Icy Basalt, House Tab, Ardy/QP Cape, Camelot Tab, Ectophial, Skills Necklace, Volcanic Ash
---
When you get to the Farming Guild: store your explorer ring, and I usually store whole inventory and then get
---
Farm Guild: Dibber, Spade, Seed Box, Log, 4Note Tomato, Dueling, Cam Tab, Watchtow Tab, Varrock Tab
---
If you dont think the game is more difficult now then you just confirm to me how little you know.
---
So you're saying Jagex should ignore scamming?  
---
Why would a new player know every scamming mechanic in the game?  Telling people not to get scammed is a dumb approach, developers should be actively against scamming and cheating.
---
But I suppose I'm talking to a wall, no point in talking to someone who thinks scamming is fair game.
---
What security measures did you have on your account at the time?
---
K, thanks bye
---
Once you get maxed house i find you don't need graceful. Its almost always faster just to port back and pool then tp wherever.
---
"dude just have a different email for everything you use and use different passwords on every single mail &amp; account"
---
Yes I too like to remember thousands of details
---
What do you mean? Phishing is not limited to OSRS lmao, or gaming. 
---
Skull tricking isn't scamming anyway.
---
grey cape with purple trim would be fire
---
ahh yeah you're right, I was thinking more bright turquoise I guess kinda like blowpipe's lighter accent or the Karluum themed blue
---
or maybe even a lime green like the lighter green on alchemical hydra. or rose/infra red, something non standard could look cool
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
 Strength seems to be one.
---
Don’t farm where you can get PKd?
---
Stay out the wild/pvp World then. Lol
---
RuneLitePlus
---
You enter the wilderness that's the risk you run.
---
Isnt it pronounced our dong
---
You’re going to get  a lot of no’s but as somebody who has played it a lot, it really just depends on what you’re into. Both games have their place.
---
**TLDR: RS3 has a lot of great things like questing and boss mechanics as well as really fleshed our things like the mining smithing rework, however it doesn’t feel like runescape to a lot of people due to the evolution of combat, MTX, and less grind**
---
RS3s main selling point at this point has to be the quest lines and the bossing. Quests are much more immersive and engaging, including voice acting on all the NPC dialogue. Quests incorporate a lot of cool game mechanics and in my opinion are a step up from the OSRS original quests bar Dragon Slayer 2.
---
Bossing is something that is big over both games, and it really just depends on your preference and the style of combat. The day that RS3 died for most people was the evolution of combat, which changed combat from click to attack combat to abilities on a cooldown based combat. 
---
For a lot of people that ruined the nostalgia of the game and I totally get that, but for those that do enjoy it, it’s allowed for the creation of really complex boss mechanics and really satisfying, engaging fights. Also with the new engine there’s a lot of really fascinating updates like player owned farms for farming zombies, big game hunting for hunter, and the mining:smithing rework that makes way more sense for the tier system. 
---
Along with the evolution of combat, another huge turnoff was the introduction of micro transactions. It made the game really easy for some people to be able to essentially buy all skills to bypass training, which in turn updates have made easier as well. Hiscore table chasers don’t agree with the idea that MTX can pay to pass them, but otherwise MTX that other people use will have little to no effect on your experience with the game.
---
The last thing that I’ll touch on is the fact that due to the desire of constant updates, skills have become really easy to train. If you use different things like Auras, potions, and lots of other interesting skill boosts in RS3 effectively you can get massive XL rates which makes getting 99s take very little time. The trade off becomes the fact that all skills now go to 120, also that it’s difficult to reach those max rates an hour. Lots of OSRS players take pride in the grind.
---
The game offers you some very useful options to prevent that from happening. Auto retaliate is one of those, and an even better method is making your left click attack option hidden.
---
Oh damn, 1.7k+? Good job!
---
what progression do you think is missing from magic? I think there;s certainly gaps/niches that can be filled, but overall I still think it has good progression
---
Wdym that’s where the only viable gold is
---
absolutely beautiful
---
Good suggestions.    
---
Curses are one of those funny pieces of dead content that is left over from RSC, and never seen an update.    
---
Reminds me of smithing, with rune platebodies made at 99 because they were once upon a time the BIS melle gear.  Even though they are low level garbage gear only useful for alching now.  At this point it makes more sense to have them smithed at 70 or so.
---
dude shut up Serene
---
I didn't make this. ALL HAIL RUSSIA
---
Then why aren't you also given a skull when entering?  Losing all items is significantly different than losing all but 3.
---
Then dont play on pvp worlds or go into the wilderness until you feel comfy with the game. 90% of the game isnt in pvp zones.
---
I'd pay more than $11 for that
---
The value of the legends cape is that it's cheap
---
Not if there wasn’t asshole pkrs
---
Not everything needs to be useful. 
---
Also, this would trivialize the inferno.
---
that was brutal
---
I think it’s a part of the game. All OGs have been scammed once upon a time. I’m just saying it’s part of the game and there’s not much they could do that they haven’t done already
---
That's the point of the wilderness it's not safe for anyone.
---
I don't really understand your point. Add x item to the top would upgrade the stats to y. That the base of the skill..
---
If the Lunar set became better than mystic, in exemple, it would maybe make the set used more often than mystic if you did the quest.
---
It make no sense to me that low/med level player should stick to mystic until they are level 70 magic and defence with a spare 2m.
---
Yeah, we have the infinity set that are a in between, but a lots of people don't even have the money to think of buying that at this level.
---
&gt; I genuinely wouldn't mind them removing the polls
---
Please never repeat that here.
---
they could’ve destroyed your fire capes 🤷‍♂️
---
falador park duck here
---
Tfw I don't know if he is trolling or not
---
Go do no prep CMs effectively without a Sang staff. Osrs is a game of margins. It's not that you're doing 5% more dps or anything, but that you're being enabled to skip certain milestones with gear advances. The same goes with sang staff.
---
I voted yes. If it doesnt pass this poll and gets repolled, I'll vote no on the repoll. No reason to keep pushing it if the community said no imo.
---
Literally got my first one last night !! Such a fucking rush
---
Okay.
---
People like this make my day and make me want to PK even more 😂😂
---
Keys that function like brimstone keys + emblems + 25 points per task
---
You're exactly right.
---
I have an idea for a Mining and Smithing rework, but I'm not sure how it will be received by the community. I've held back from developing the idea, because I fear the backlash I might receive.
---
Mage is not a must until you want to brid. But u can get mage as high as ranged for free. So no combat levels
---
Pure for me is the most fun. But all depends ofc. Zerkers are not that strong these days
---
But another good and fun account, but taking more time is 60 att/75 att and 70/75 def. But that is a lot of questing, magic more important (veng) etc.
---
You did me a mean.
---
u/JagexHusky can we get a quest that takes place on the surface of zanaris
---
Time to keep on runnin
---
The only ones left would be the bots! Damn R-strategists!
---
Especially these days
---
[Dabbby]
---
I bought the graceful boots first not realising that boots of lightness were actually better...
---
It's mostly because your response to the criticism. You could have bought better gear and then sold it when you finished for the 99s you wanted and would have saved a fair bit of time. Instead of listening and taking any of the advice people tried to offer you kept doubling down stating that it was a small amount of dps increase while completing ignoring that over time it would have saved you hours.   
---
     
---
Frankly, if it wasnt for your rude/ignorant responses, you likely wouldnt have been downvoted at all.
---
Yeah defo this 😂
---
Y’all fucked up the drugs when the cabbage fell into the cauldron
---
Head to the website and deactivate the authenticator then **RE-ENABLE THE AUTHENTICATOR** on your new phone and you will be able to log in with the code generated on the new phone
---
I’m mad as fuck about it tbh. I’m not asking for much, just 2 or 3 toes is all.
---
Can you justify your position? I see an occasional "Warding is bad for the game" but most elaboration is just "No new skills. RS3 had new skills!".
---
Yawn. I'm mad because people are advocating for scamming.  If you attack another player who is attacking you, you don't get skulled.  Someone planting an account with the exact same name and outfit to trick you into thinking you're fighting them is scamming.  Get better arguments, I'm not personally the one getting skull tricked or scammed, but its disheartening seeing so many people so desperate for a loophole to scamming.
---
sell. robinhood hat/body/legs are only useful for pures/fashionscape flexing.
---
With a Mith helmet
---
You're going to want most other upgrades first:
---
- Bandos, Armadyl, Ancestral
---
- All four Zenytes
---
- All three boots
---
- Kodai (if training slayer)
---
Lategame slayer uses all of these equipment depending on how you train it. Also most lategame content (bossing, raids) use all of these as well.
---
I'd also personally go for a DH Lance before a Rapier as well because it's good for many slayer tasks as well as for raids 1.
---
Pprtal nexus or portal rooms. Nexus keeps it nice and tight but costs alot more.
---
Menagerie for all your pets
---
Superior Garden for pools/fairy ring/spirit tree/obelisk
---
Achievement gallery for jewellery box and occult altar
---
Treasure room (i think its called?) To be able to store capes, certsin armor sets and skilling outfits and clue scroll rewards
---
Workshop for an armor stand so you can repair your own barrows gear cheaper
---
Kitchen with maxed shelves so you can get the best tea (boosts construction when you drink)
---
Colbat room for the dummy - lets you spec with ancient mace to boost your prayer before say fight caves or a slayer task (i always use it)
---
Along these lines od highly recommend getting a spirit tree planted in the farming guild, I love it.
---
Home tablet -&gt; spirit tree a few squares from bank-&gt; spirit tree back to house and all tps.
---
Hate them beyond belief, dunno why this subreddit finds them so hilarious
---
You do realize that the corporation won't give a ahit about the polls, right? It'll be the devs ya'll despise standing up for us if that happens.
---
No anti cheat company reveals the details regarding the ban. Why do you expect Jagex to reveal it ?
---
Did you read my comment?
---
I didn't factor anything it's on the wiki already and yes they factored that in
---
The real ticket is that a ridiculously insignificant number of people decide to do stuff because they're insulted. It's post-hoc justification for things they'd do anyway.
---
I had a seizure trying to read that
---
bounty hunter of course thats where they farm embelms idk if they are still there cause  its 3 hours past

I hate the fucking autism ya'll have in you, mtx isn't a bad thing. Being able to buy things that would otherwise require time and dedication is. Making the achievements buyable is. Not having a fucking cosmetic cloak that goes for 5USD.
---
I have one account and I'm voting yes because it seems like pretty well thought out content that would be a massive boon the magic in general.
---
Took me something like 6 hours. I took a break and logged in on mobile later when I was out and about with some time to kill and literally the second jungle I cleared I got mine. Rng be like that

There's nothing wrong with what he did, it's his responses to people saying that he could have done a few things differently that would have benefited him in the long run.

As a kid, I used to pronounce is ardoo-gone. Dunno how looking back on it.
---
Make that a 100% everyone gets that joke at this point

He has 200m strength it looks like from the fake xp drop

The necromancy part was just an example (albeit Arceuss spellbook needs some serious work) 
---
And you can’t really change skills now that they’ve been out

Going from having 99 crafting to being unable to make d’hide bodies because of a retconned crafting would be silly

Hey, I'm too dumb to work this out on my own. Why is justiciar better than bandos at abyssal demons off task?

How did I learn this then?  I feel like I've known for years, possibly prior to osrs.
---
To craft double nats in down time to afford pk supplies. Every member has a weekly 8 hour shift. So far the open slots are Wednesdays 3 AM GMT and Sundays  8  PM GMT - start of the shift.
---
It was:
---
Ranged lvl 78. Loadout: Rune crossbow + diamond bolt (e) (no Kandarin hard diary) + black d'hide top/bottom + Ava's accumulator
---
Magic lvl 82. Loadout: Iban's staff + mystic top/bottom + mage arena 2 cape.
---
I used barrows gloves, helm of netiznot, Mage Training Arena book and infinity boots, and then either the unholy symbol or glory, can't remember. My inventory was two antipoisons, two prayer potions, runes and then sharks + karambwans for the remainder.
---
I was absolutely only able to get the kill because I already had experience from my main account. I got the kill on my third attempt. On attemp #1 I got double clapped during the first melee phase because I couldn't focus. I got killed on the Jad phase on both attempt #1 and #2.
---
I’d hope most people who are able to defeat the mimic would far enough into the game that they’d know to enable it first. At the same time... people surprise me

&gt;Salad Robes and Elder Chaos being better than most of the stuff that comes after them despite having nonexistent requirements.
---
This makes 0 sense
---
salad robes are literally garbage, they're only a tiny step above ghostly and people only use them because they may as well be free
---
elder chaos robes are BIS 1 def, they are significantly worse than mystic for someone with def
---
theres definitely room for more magic armor im not denying that, but i dont know how you can claim
---
wizard robes &gt; salad &gt; mystic &gt; infinity &gt; ahrim &gt; ancestral 
---
isnt progression
---
Bojler eladó
---
Yes.
---
What like?
---
Ty might try pure
---
the defense rn is 75 bro are you off the xan or some shit? how much do you think 5 defence levels will give holy moley
---
honestly i don't even mind his voice as much as how slow moving his progress is. 
---
if you're a fan of pure grind then Karamja only is better but in terms of entertainment and a more goal oriented story, i think Swampman is way ahead.
---
i binged verf over a week and after getting to like epi 20, i realized that i had probably seen multiple full episodes of him training to just train and farming to just farm and getting clues just to get clues
---
Like its still really cool but its more of a pure "locked ironman" series rather than one with a goal like swampletics
---
I must be out of the loop...what is this from? looks cool.
---
You clearly didn't read the post and yet, you are against it.
---
Look at the astral armor stats. It's an upgraded version of the lunar set.
---
Its really only an issue pre BiS. BiS mage bonuses are pretty similar to BiS melee bonuses, while BiS magic defenses are the lowest of any defenses by a large margin, even without Dinh's.
---
You obviously don’t either.
---
You obviously haven’t.
---
Rs2 didn't become Rs3 until EoC
---
My Ironman started doing hespori (on release) with probably around 73 att, str, and def. used proselyte and helm of neitiznot, with d scim and defender. I pray magic and have an inventory with anti poison, super set, 1 or 2 prayer pots and the rest monkfish. I’ve never had a problem with it. Could probably have done it with high 60s.
---
Its coming seeing as how ds2 and mm2 have mid 60s required i wouldn't be surprised if the morytania grandmaster is 80s
---
You can't know everything about the change by reading the dev blog. It only tells you what the change is, not what effects it will have. When it comes to making those kinds of judgments, it seems worthwhile to gather information from other people who are thinking about the same topic, because we all have different experiences. There might be important reasons to vote one way or the other that would never occur to me because I don't have the relevant perspective.

You can make staffs, but smithing has weapons, and fletching is honestly just crafting split up. I did think of that point though I just think it would be cool to have have a skill that was super fleshed out in this manner.

Certain waves will definitely eat more than a brew if you're bad, such as wave 63 (2 blobs, a melee, a ranger, and a mage).

This also allows you to almost certainly tank a zuk hit.
---
I'd fucking love it, tbh.
---
no
---
Thanks, a lot of it is definitely nerves too. I may try to learn one easy phase and just tele out on other phases for now just to get comfortable with it. I’ll also get at least 80 magic before going back just bursted a quick level before work but i have about 3000 casts left.
---
What are the gear/level requirements for NMZ? I’m 69/65/60
---
Actually Obsidian is even better than Dharoks always. It’s what people going for 200m str exp use as well.
---
they'll likely send out invites to random people via message center. Or, it'll just be open beta worlds like the LMS beta. Regardless, it has not started yet, so you're not missing out.

Also, I'd like the XP.

Okay Alex, and I'm sure they're putting chemicals in the river Lum that turn the goblins gay too.
---
I feel like this is one of the underlying problems for everybody though. The PvMers are bringing an OP shield to not get bukkake'd by a clan
---
Downvotes were to be expected to be honest, was in a very bad mood when I wrote my first comment. Thanks though :)

Bottom inv is closer to spec button, less mouse movement, better strat.

You realize he's the founder of OLY who are notorious for breaking Ironman EHP meta. I saw a guy posting clips of his Dagannoth slayer task where he was using 5 alts to lure and stack the Dagannoths.

maybe getting stats up for some X quest and X location for botting later on?

Ok mifht try it since i realy want to learn to hybrid.

even if you don't think new skills are necessary doesn't mean they wouldn't improve the game

the game could only have strength and still function, doesn't mean the other skills don't add to it

The ultimate bot buster.

Permabanned for botting?

They Grinch even took the Gmaul. What a dick

they didnt do nearly as much work on those as warding

Thanks! I also thought it fit thematically with the idea of cursing a target.
---
I can't imagine why it wouldn't as those sought after gear loadouts are the most in need of stabilization as eventually...given enough time even Justiciar armour will tumble in price. With the skill there could be a big incentive to dissolve your set for huge XP gains and the ability to use your levels to make some equally viable or more niche magic armor that are exclusive to training it. Equating to either big GP gains for selling it or getting to that skillcape faster. 
---
It all makes sense to me at least, your mileage may vary.

Yea i tryed it but wasnt that good . And they say pvp community is cancer 😂
---
ty for being the only real answer
---
I was getting 80K - 100K P/H str xp with bludgeon from 80-99
---
Checks out, welcome home brother
---
Even Crumble Undead could use a buff, I agree totally.
---
They already have the capacity to calculate Magic Strength through the use of Salamanders, and certain spells could use that same scale to become effective at higher levels. Kinda like how Trident or Slayer Dart become more powerful.
---
I love new ideas, but there is so much in the game already that needs updating and modernization.
---
Nah man the HD graphics are objectively better. Just because you don't like them for whatever dumb reason doesn't somehow mean they aren't an upgrade. Higher resolutions and increased detail is better no matter what way you slice it.
---
That is like saying "7 is not a higher number than 6" just because you don't like the number 7.
---
Thanks man, I am having fun with my life and I do my best to have fun at parties
---
Better late than never, I guess?
---
You're absolutely right.
---
I love that the Dev team always looks forward, but they refuse to look back and it can have dire consequences on the health of the game
---
98/99 oof
---
The "correct" way also makes no sense. How do you get an "oi" sound from "oug"? Sometimes the English language is fucky, but it's never that fucky.
---
🦀 show poll results🦀...?

Would rather have 2011 rs

No one is going to see this, but decimation would only remove 10%, not 50%.

Reductio ad absurdum.

Opinion ≠ Fact, no matter how loud you shout it.
---
Go home brocus, you're drunk
---
Exactly, won't be making the same mistake this time. No prizes for guessing which skills were botted
---
You don’t get eternals for their magic attack at kraken, and you don’t kill thermy for slayer, you barrage just the smoke devils
---
put 11 of them next to each other, what do you get?
---
Well, I suppose you're right. I just mean stacking, like casting two Attack-reducing Curse Spells.
---
I have no problem with people being able to use all Curse Spells against an opponent, but not allowing them to CONTINUE reducing stats by casting a second time.
---
I'm must just be really dumb and you're really smart.
---
You can sell it back
---
I always said "Ar-Dough-Nn"
---
This is real content miss me with that swamplectics shit
---
It's remove the kebabs
---
Why do you think thats ACTUALLY the reason why? Youre spending too much time in the circlejerk listening to people who havent actually ever tried killing people in a dinhs even in good gear.
---
Why would Jagex not only nerf but make an INTEGRITY UPDATE based on people wearing water staffs and salad robes? Like surely people cannot be this dumb, as it makes zero sense.
---
It was nerfed because it makes you pretty much invincible (if you have ANY idea of how to tank) in singles even against singles PKers in good gear. You can easily tank a half TB with a virtually 0 risk Dinhs setup (so like Serp+Dinhs+K top+Suffering etc.) even if you have someone on you in max. As long as youre semi competent and can switch a pray (although not completely required, bulwark in the right setup is that strong) then youll be completely fine. And thats against max, your average upgraded mystics setup (TSOTD, occult, seers ring, d boots, blessed SS) that is usually really strong for only 3m+ risk probably has no virtually no shot killing on a half TB let alone without a TB. 
---
Ive tanked max teams with 8-10 people all the way from level 38 to 1 wildy easily in my dinhs setup and by easily I mean I had 9 or 10 brews and I still only used like 5 of them, which is ridiculous. Thats the power of a dinhs if its in the hands of someone who knows how to tank. I mean if you know how to tank, you can tank even a full TB if you have 9-10 brews, and in like a TSOTD+Serp+K top+Blessed SS+V skirt setup no bulwark needed. When you add the bulwark in with someone who knows how to tank its near impossible to die even on a full TB.
---
Why though?
---
Rsc would be unbearable with the player count osrs has, good luck talking to anyone
---
S for save our skins!
---
It'll probably pass this time seeing how the community is becoming more and more open to it. It's been fun I guess.
---
Fun no like me have
---
Gg
---
Scrubs mad.
---
Kurasks are undeniably shit xp.
---
The point was also to show the lack of low level magic gear, so I took that
---
Where did I claim it's OP?  I'm only challenging the assertion that Xerician is the source of why it's hard to hit
---
&gt; Halfassed updates? 
---
Yes? Thats all we're getting. 
---
&gt; And Jagex doesn't care?
---
They care about making money.
---
I didnt say Hydra was good or bad. Just an example.
---
Yeah it’s weird I love watching people grind agility for 7 hours at a time
---
or a drill, or a toy.  they designed it off of a stereotypical jousting lance.. a form of non-lethal sport.  Actual lances were spears with weighted ends, and actually killed people.
---
pkers are retarded. of they want to have better accuracy bring better gear. YOU chose to pk. attacking someone who does not want to pk.  retarded children.  just go pk eachother at some corner. the rest of us dont want to participate
---
Impose a tax on members which will fund the f2p base to get members as well! #Commuscapism
---
Try a different trim than brown, maybe a dark blue or white
---
I like it though pink skillcape would be dope
---
Why is Tears of Guthix bad news?
---
This could have been fixed and I've missed it, but if not, you can be skulled by autoretaliate if a pker barrages a NPC and hits you
---
So did the toy variant, to be fair. Just not nearly as often.
---
I tried to make it more neat, for aesthetics, did not mean to diminish what the OP made
---
Is there a guide for this somewhere? I'm having trouble finding it and there's not much on the wiki
---
I got the 1/5000 pet on 95 kill count.
---
Bro ur off the xan
---
Nice meme mate &lt;3
---
i will never understand how people sink 100s or 1000s of hours into this game, but they don't take 5 minutes to secure their account and email
---
Not sure how I feel about the brown/pink combo, but I think a pink skillcape would be really cool!
---
Sounds good enough to me.
---
How would you implement the item sink without the skill?
---
My thinking is that it's like saying you can have a reason for people to turn logs into planks without the construction skill
---
looooooooooooool
---
Exactly this. Summoning wasnt a huge dps boost pre eoc, very few people I played with took titans over yaks/torts or unicorns. It allowed people to not need alts/bigger groups and I miss it. I'd drop osrs for a version with summ/dungeoneering in a heartbeat
---
Well anything is possible if you overwork the shit out of your devs lol. Though from what i can tell it isn't like fortnite gets massive content updates every week either. They have the big season change update, and then some smaller stuff like new equipment in between.
---
Work on diarys aim for base 70s theres loads for you to achieve go for ds2 or mm2 quests?
---
Salty about downvotes lol
---
What's the point of this video??? The pker catches 2 freezes on him in salad robes with bulwark then runs away because he fought back. The guy wasnt even using bulwark for most of the video. Are you trying to show that bulwark is op or the opposite? I really cant tell.
---
There's people like you that will make it fail, 25% to fail is easier to reach than 75% to pass.
---
Alan Holverson is way to sensative if he cums that easily.
---
Not an excuse to not add it either. Its top tier Runescape content.
---
For a second i thought those were all individual states
---
Why democracy is flawed
---
I mean, they did the same thing with the dungeoneering cape back in RS3 when they introduced that. I'm certain some of the designers aren't quite aware how important consistency is, despite how "cool" they can make new stuff.
---
Correct, if you don't have seers unlocked, use the camelot teleport (~29 seconds to patch), QP cape to fairy ring is next fastest, running from farm guild or monastery to their closest respective rings, then going to mcgrubor's woods takes ~50 seconds.
---
TL;DR:  Warding bad, Rc bad, Revitalizing dead content good, extra unnecessary grinds bad, variety of grind good.
---
I dislike that the content of the incoming skill would fit better placed among other skills to add some variety to those grinds. Another disenchant + enchant function is redundant when we have Alchemy spells for item sinking and enchant bolts for an example of using magic over warding and runecrafting with a bunch of lore to it about imbuing objects/transferring magical energy already.  Spinning robes from crafting and enchanting them with magic/runecrafting energy can be implemented just fine without the new skill. 
---
The day a skill fills an actual void or ties together things without just shoehorning in extra grinds better done by bots than people I'll vote yes. Which is disappointing because warding was meant to be like that and with all the work people have put in is close, but they didn't see it already can be like that. 
---
Shoehorning in a redundant skill instead of expanding upon the skills already there is also silly. Sailing wasn't needed because then we'd need flying skills for gliders and balloons when most transportation is done via teleports anyway. Dungeoneering was implemented in a good way that encourages people to gather with others and take on a challenge, I think they call it the Chamber's of Xeric, Theatre of Blood, God Wars Dungeon, and a plethora of other boss names hiding out in dungeons throughout the world. Summoning would better fit as a spellbook such as the Arceus necromancy book but messes with the combat triangle and I think they mentioned polling/adding in summons with warding for some weird reason, part of the ol' pulling out runic energy out our pixelated behinds or something. Armour Set effects could be done easily and for say the ancestral/mystic/skeletal/splitbark/etc. sets might be warranted. Gathering around a big rock, drawing a rune on the ground, and pulling energy from it is just RC in reverse. 
---
Take the content suggested/created, and distribute it among the blank spaces where it fits IF IT PASSES POLLS; And don't be lazy about it saying well we'll just slap it all in a new band-aid skill because we have a black square in the leveling tab, one day we'll actually need it for a good use, but warding is not that IMHO.
---
That's not my point

you should thank us

&gt;either my comment or the OP?

Read the title of the post.

&gt;I'm only challenging the assertion that Xerician is the source of why it's hard to hit

&gt;Even in BiS it's hard to hit on the bulwark. Dumb post

Ok then.

Homie those videos were 300-500 hours of grinding progress into a single video.

holy fuck give me a pink skillcape

RS3 wasn't inherently shit, theres a lot of features in it that are quite alright.

MTX being the best for everything however is shite.

You're a cancer to the game's future and a pain in devs' backs. You're the reason game developers don't like coming to work.

drop it onto a table so it doesnt despawn, then talk to tutifruti or whatever the dude in the caves name is during the quest. you should be able to skip
---
My last post didn't have the name censored which I felt was fair, it had undeniable video proof. This one though is just two images. I imagine it would be heavily more scrutinized for calling someone out without exact proof they were botting.
---
Took me 46... It was sooo infuriating
---
YES!!!!
---
how does that make sense at all? do people not read the title of their own post before posting it?
---
&gt; The majority of the game population does indeed visit/use this subreddit.
---
You got a source for that?
---
I think you may not fully know what the max cape offers. It's every skillcape perk combined. Which in turns gives it the fastest bank teleport, instant and infinite teleports to your PoH, it acts as a graceful cape, a HP cape (faster recovery), an accumulator (pickup ammo), a holy wrench, and also has a bunch of other useful teleports (farm guild, fish guild, warriors guild, any Poh portal location). 
---
So it's super useful for any general tasks, mainly clues I use it a lot for. And for farm runs.
---
As for copying skills I totally agree, I want new and exciting ones, not repeated ones. It's also why warding just doesn't interest me. It feels like a repeat of skills we already have, just with different output (and not even unique output, just existing items moved into this skill with some new robes etc.) That's why I'm not intrigued by it.
---
To let you know, I voted no for artisan as it had no resemblance to a skill to me, it felt more like contracts, which we now have with farming contracts and I think that's a great concept, but not a "skill". I voted yes for sailing because it truly excited me. It felt like a combination of what makes construction interesting (your own POH, you'd have your own ship instead), slayer (exploring around a new part of the world where the higher your skill is the more interesting and rewarding islands you can visit) and group content in skilling, which is entirely lacking even with loved skills like slayer.
---
Unfortunately they didnt do much to flesh the idea of the skill out, and people saw it as minigame esque, which is fair enough. I essentially imagined it as similar to construction, but with "contracts" put in like people want for construction. Go to specific ports and do different contracts based on level (port sarim starting training area for example) and it would be about preparing ships and such. That would be the grindy buyable way. The exploring way would be going out on ships in a solo way and beating challenges. Then with your skill prowess you could go in groups to explore islands not for sailing XP but for other rewards. 
---
I think that sounds exciting, refreshing and new. While warding sounds like we're all just going to stand at a bank and do the same stuff we've always done, now just with new animations and a different skill icon to put the XP toward.

OSRS had 50 million players and Ash has purchased his own private island

Almost like some people read it when it was released and don't revisit it daily to see if they update the icon???
---
I heard swampletics doesn't want warding to pass
---
Just be patient, they are installing double xp to your account
---
I mean, yeah, cause they have no reason not to use it there too
---
I agree remove them
---
&gt;Warding in the lore is something that gets discovered &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; in the game time. its not supposed to be something that has always existed
---
????
---
Warding is supposed to explain how some of the **current** robes are being made, like mystic. You'd have to make a gargantuan lore retcon to explain how suddenly we make mystic robes through a different process than whatever way we used to.
---
It's definitely a ward, which is one of the markings you'll draw on the ground to use as your surface (like an anvil)
---
I would be fine with this playing everywhere.
---
DO DODODO DODODODODO DO DODODO DO DO DO DO
---
DO DODODO DODODODODO DODODODODODODODODOODDODODO
---
I mean.. yes? It's important to have the thing you look at to reflect a skill actually reflect it. It helps new players a lot. If construction has a saw and log but is trained inside a purple portal...but the purple portal skill isn't trained there... That's confusing and poor design.
---
That's definitely the best compliment I've received so far; thank you very much. I like to draw out all the possibilities, and then narrow it down to something feasible and reasonable. Thanks for your feedback and support.
---
You're right; they currently take up Spellbook space. And I do agree that the Standard Spellbook is becoming quite crowded. It's possible that other utility Spells or even Teleport Spells could be condensed, but I am not sure what this would do to players who really on a quick teleport away from danger. Filters are already such a useful tool, and could be used to narrow down available Spells. I like your idea, but making Curses harder to cast would only make them less viable.
---
Maybe he is just learning

Man that's whack. I got scouted and jumped by two maxed mains at rogues the other night doing slayer. They were in maxed gear and multi-comboed me out while mocking me, I just lol'd and let them have their 25k split 😂

what did you guys do for masters?  I'm currently tryna grind barrows for elites but the boss is more than twice as rare from elites than masters

probably multi bait

I played the game for months straight when it came out on mobile. There's literally no possible way I could have botted. I don't even think the software was there to bot last year and surely they could have detected it a little more accurately? Kinda bummed as I've been playing off and on since 2006 and if they just ban random accounts now (especially ones for botting played solely on a tablet), there's not really a reason for me to create another one and spend money just for the same thing to happen. I want to appeal so they can see it didn't happen, but there's no option?
---
I mean if ur ratted and go afk it’s possible your account could be remotely controlled.
---
Lool, I'm sorry I might have watched him but I don't remember.
---
Just reminds me of pussy and asshole. Tho i recognize this is a benefit for others.
---
Jagex mods don't care. And that's the honest truth once your account is banned there's no point even trying to reach out.
---
Why warding can be added and fit in*
---
It fitting the game is not the only reason you should vote for a skill, thinking that simply is dangerous design as well.
---
Ayy TY, I'm dumb af
---
I looked up his gear again to make sure I wasn’t crazy.
---
Seriously, almost every skill in RS is boring. Even the most exciting ones - combat skills - are boring. Hence people trying everything possible to AFK tasks and their combat skills to 99. The only active thing people do combat wise that is fun is boss content really, and raids.
---
how do people have the time to play this much, I don’t understand??
---
Amazing video.
---
RIP Slayermusiq1
---
Nothing against warding but this is a terrible argument. 
---
He can't just say "EVERYONE just wanted pre-eoc runescape not 2007!" because that's not true at all lol. The game died for a large portion of the community before EoC even happened (Ex: No Free Trade / Summoning).
---
Once you get elite, you can just open/catch implings for easy and medium, and same with hard or grind something quick for a hard and trade it all in to Watson.
---
Well clearly... Seeing as you can't "lose" pets in the real sense

How do you even bring enough food to last 6 mins lol? Vorkath’s ranged attack fucks me up enough in some 2:30 kills to nearly eat my entire inventory.

I see you didn't mention authenticator at all... Bank pin is only a 3 day delay if you do nothing. Authenticator and email 2fa is the true form of security. To get hacked past that you are no longer using a unique email as you've used it enough to be leaked alongside enough critical information to be recovered.
