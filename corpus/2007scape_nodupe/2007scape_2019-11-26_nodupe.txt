Im currently safe spotting at the end of wave 59, 1 dose of sara brew left and 6 doses of super restore
---
Dayum solid. That'll be my next 99 after 200fm. Hope I get as lucky as you :P
---
Yeah it is, not on you to say "these people don't understand anything about the real world" lmao, it just seems like a simple mistake and it's obvious why he made it
---
What someone not posting from a pure account, is this even OSRS reddit????
---
Isnt there a runelite plugin already that reorders your prayers?
---
Skip was the second most voted option. Many people probably don't care which one gets picked.
---
Calm down
---
HAHAHHA LOL! CORSD IMUG.!!!
---
You don't have to use Runelite and yes I just had to right click on the XP globe and hit ''setup''. Thanks a lot!
---
The mount karuulm mine has 3 iron next to a single tile.
---
What if literally the next needed task is a couple of hundred hours of the same content what do you suggest ?
---
If you right click on the XP orb near the map you can go to a certain skill and set values on it.
---
I just don't follow streamers at all.
---
He used god wars as an example of an area where the risk of obtaining a pet would be nullified by banking actually.
---

---
I don't actually know how the game handles rolling a pet if you have one out, and a full invent, and kill a boss. Interesting question.
---
Collection log highscores please
---
Neither I wanna go check on my alt but at work ahha
---
Exactly. And you should be able to if you have the forethought and skill to do so.
---
You're talking about a grind at gargoyles, where he has 2 open inventory spaces, prayer flicking the entire time, hoping for one of 2 drops. This grind is going to take even longer than temple trekking. Not to mention he had to go to RF before he could start it, and took a vacation for mental sanity.
---
Imagine voting no on something that doesn‚Äôt have to affect you and makes the game more enjoyable overall. Leave it to the osrs community.
---
During pking a lot of your activity is limited more by your APM than the ticks in the game engine. Gear switching, prayers, combos and specs all require fast and precise clicking. Reordering prayers makes this easier.
---
No. He goes out of his way to produce great content that the entire community enjoys and spends more time on it than a full time job. It doesn‚Äôt benefit him to take this long, he does it to ensure the video is amazing each time. He produces this content for YOU and you have the audacity to bitch and moan. Sit down and wait like everyone else.
---
A couple hundred hours
---
 7 hours a day which he plays at least subtracting the 11 for runefest and taking 15 days off still leaves 30 days for 210 hours so hows it been 56
---
You're taking this way too seriously lol
---
Nice now I can cosplay as drug addict.
---
And then multiple people up voting it.
---
Listen it was just a silly comment
---
This community is full of petty insecure losers who hate people different than them. Even if that difference is how you play a video game.
---
Can I be honest with you? 
---
You‚Äôre kinda fucked unless you have an amazing strategy for these last 3 rounds and then Jad himself. I would just Yolo it and pray you can make it to Jad. You won‚Äôt need brews at JAD anyways so pray you make it to the end with a few doses of restore.
---
This sums up this subreddit lmao
---
No he doesn‚Äôt go out his way he chooses to play rs instead of getting a job
---
I doubt it, there was enough pushback on this design that they had to design, model, and poll two alternatives. They could have saved a lot of work by starting with a less offensive (so to speak) design.
---
managed to get a really scuffed kq kill on my iron early on for hard diary and it didnt count even though i did literally all the damage. fun
---
Range is already OP
---
Not good enough
---
Takes about 3 hours of infinite run in library to get 80+ sooooooo y‚Äôall wrong again lol
---
they can earn way more than $40 a month lmao. If a venezuelan farms zulrah for 8 hours a day at 2m/h thats already $4 a day.
---
Bad troll is bad.
---
[removed]
---
lmao who buys magic potions
---
You try perfectly prayer flicking at gargoyles with his gear, no auto rock hammer, or food for 7 hours straight every single day. You‚Äôre hilarious. If I were settled I‚Äôd quit making videos because of ungrateful entitled fucks like you who can‚Äôt appreciate the work he does for YOUR entertainment
---
Getting skull tricked in edge dungeon and losing my D2H and Dlegs
---
Uh fuck no lmfao
---
1 solution , chest. 
---
Price we have to pay should be based around the boss/monster loot table we die at rather then based on gear.
---
For example if you die at dumb place on a slayer task lets say due to dcing, like while barraging nechs. One guy with bis mage shouldnt have to pay lets say 5% im just throwing a random number where one other guy with proselyte pays that same % for that same death. 
---
If the avg monster kill give you 25k, then price to pay on death should be around that in my opinion
---
These last 2 months have been the busiest of my life. I've been away from home for at least 3 of the last 7 weeks. You'll see when the video releases this week why the hold up has been so long. Gargoyles aren't all sunshine and rainbows :) sorry for the wait.
---
i assume it's because of dwh specs and such
---
I voted yes to a few because I know I'll do activities in the future but the last ToB question made no sense to me, so I skipped it.
---

who even cares about this ugly armour, it's dead content it should be removed.

It feels a lot nicer than rs3 honestly, so i‚Äôm about 50/50 on it
---
You hardly need brews even on the last few waves unless you're a low level.
---
I started this thread trying to be a troll I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve actually seen this and replied I‚Äôm gonna delete this thread sorry
---
I remember in my early days I used to hang out at the general store and watch the items going in and out of the store just for fun. It was really cool just to see the icons of items that were out of my reach.
---

---
Beat me with it üò£
---
Well, I don't remember tbh. I always kept track of the gp/hr not the kills.
---
Jagex: Do you want to hide and change the magic tab icons around, to make things easier in certain situations?
---
Community: Yes
---
Jagex: What about prayer?
---
Community: Yes but actually no because some of us hate the game improving.
---
Sorry you interrupted my final point about how Jagex probably considered calling Ectofuntus, Ectofunctus, because of the funky smell that's likely emitting from that area of Gielinor
---
Thats what happens when you go to the small town stores. Gotta take that baby to varrock
---
No, the poll just ended today.  You can see full results here: http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1582

Okay, if they make it $20 a month, do all of the problems get fixed? because if so, do it.
---
They‚Äôre really good servers.
---
An mmo is a massively multiplayer online game. Not massively single player, no need to communicate with other players game.
---
Yeah I buried the loot somewhere in the desert and forgot it's location. In other words, got cleaned.
---
Alch em
---
Fun fact, you can do that but animation cancel the watering by planting the next seed/watering the next plant the instant the ground changes from dry to wet, you'll save roughly two ticks per patch that way.
---
Wasnt this less than a year ago
---
Proof?
---
13 def and get slayer helm, 42 and get void. Salvagable!
---
I love watching everyone with their endless run not teleporting because they cant afford runes. Or running around picking up ammo like trash.
---
How does it benefit mains? They could still attack the monster, some people honestly don't care if your an ironman
---
\&gt;Then when they couldn't cheat any more they got it polled again
---
imagine thinking people aren't still using 3pc prayer reordering lmaooo
---
I wanted it for Nylos, Zulrah and smite/retribution cycling to pretend to be the cops.
---
Looked at his post history his previous 2 rsns were ‚Äú16 inch bbc‚Äù and 18 inch bbc‚Äù 
---
I think he‚Äôs aware it was justified
---
It still doesn't really benefit the main, if they come back fast enough (which they will, there's a teleport for everything), they can just pick up the loot.
---
&gt;I have the past 2-3 years of Q&amp;A in transcript/archive and am working to centralise them all into a spreadsheet to make searching and filtering easier. Hoping to get that done in the next few weekends so that they can be public start of 2020.
---
Goddamn I'll never not be impressed by people who do things like this. Thank you.
---
Not to rub it in because it's not much better but this makes me feel less unfortunate about the one draconic, two jars, and one dbone necklace in \~2k kc
---
Happy disability day bud!
---
I didnt vote no but this is more than just quality of life. It has an actual functionality difference
---
Nah bro its okay, he's a streamer.
---
Mod Ash confirmed that Void's accuracy works with Chompies. Does the damage boost apply as well?
---
I guess you'll bank around an extra 25-40k per day, at a guess you'll spend ~25mil to rush 99 (really depends on the method though, assuming 5gp per xp) it will take you about 2 years to break even... So... probably not worth it unless you want 99 for achievement purposes
---
?
---
Oi!! I didn't even know it was mine! Thanks!! :)
---
F
---
With the average kill time of 2 minutes a billion kills would take you 3,802 years. If Jesus started in the year 0 and used his immortality to kill Zulrah, he still wouldn‚Äôt be done.
---
I'm sure the economist really prioritizes referencing niche memes from niche communities in their articles.
---
How are we going to pretend this is some game integrity change that doesnt need a poll
---
Honestly I would be happy if it was just removed altogether
---
Lol so many scales
---
There were much less players before the GE was released so you're just wrong.
---
Can you reconsider adding blood and death rune packs? Currently ironman need to buy 10's of thousands of both of these due to scythe, sang staff, tridents and barraging. Which is quite honestly just RSI inducing.
---
No because jagex is run for profit by Chinese overlords and takes 85+% of the profit. A sudden raise in price would be terrible and basically say that company is trying to bankrupt jagex to liquidate them.
---
Good question. As they're tradable, I would hope so! Everyone wants those horns, with the house theme also in demand.
---
I'd like a 70% threshold or some system that repolls questions that didn't make it by ~10%.
---
It's not really an improvement though. I didn't use RL's prayer reordering for a while and I managed just fine. Then I used it to switch Rigour/Augury with Eagle Eye/Mystic Might and I got on just as fine. Then they said that wasn't okay so they switched it back and I'm still getting on just fine. There are better things to spend the dev time on.
---
Surprised no one quits over prayer reordering? Jesus, I think so many of these things are great, but hearing people say they'll quit I'd runelite is shut down is just laughable.
---
It is similar to what happened when Wintertodt was first released. Not as drastic though.
---
This was Wintertodt after only 1 month: https://i.redd.it/3i0xf6hrxgpx.jpg
---
There's some thieving minigame in Pisc that requires a lockpick. Playing it once is a hard diary task and playing it a lot gives you a lot of League points.
---
So like 1000 league points are locked behind the lockpick, Young Imps are the only source, found consistently at only one spot on the map. I've spent about 12 hours hunting so far, looted 10 maybe, but I am unlucky.
---
Well that was entertaining and all but like you said ;
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave it up to me to keep picking names‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôve done, took the ability to do that for you and chosen something they deem more appropriate
---
ToB is roughly 6-8m/hr, or $3-4/hr.
---
160 hours per month = $480 - $640 per month. 
---
Approximately 65 to 85 times the monthly pay on minimum wage in Venezuela.
---
$105k - $135k per month when compared to 65-85 times the minimum wage in the US.
---
I will live like a king... until I get shot, robbed or kidnapped of course.
---
I used to do this sort of thing to my older brother when he was playing Warcraft III single player against Insane bots.
---
He would ask me to just keep mining gold and cutting lumber and spawning troops, while he was brb. I thought I was a genius and such a good little brother by remembering a list of cheat codes I use when I play War3 like greedisgood 100000 (gives you gold equal to the number after the word) and whosyourdaddy (makes your troops invincible and 1 shots everything) and I would even throw in iseedeadpeople (reveals the whole map and shows where the enemy bases are).
---
I threw in all those cheats while he was away and I'm like hey rob check it out you're rich as now you'll smash them! Then he started to bash me with his boney knuckles for 'ruining the game'. I had no idea what was wrong, but damn it hurt.
---
Oh is that what artifacts are?
---
Same im from New Jersey
---
Yeah, that's it.
---
It's only nostalgia that makes you think that. That's why the ge was reintroduced.
---
That doesn't seem very ironman-like to me.
---
GE made the game worse because the inconvenience of trading encouraged players to use more content to get certain items themselves.
---
People who wanted the GE loved to attack the strawman of "people opposed GE because they *enjoy* trading.
---
Yes let's not let people vote that we disagree with.
---
You know I thought about that but luckily Jamflex used their Galaxy Brain and completed Dragon Slayer for us

Can the white defender be added please (with no attack requirement) this is my suggestion:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e1lwrz/suggestion\_the\_white\_defender/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e1lwrz/suggestion_the_white_defender/)
---
How was that even a joke? Do you do stand up comedy for Sheldon Cooper conventions?
---
And if not Clan wars it'll be the eating / drinking while the bank is open once it comes out. The pool is no different from any other infinite item, you spend a shit ton to have something you can use forever. Enchanted lyre, Trident of the swamp (e), eternal slayer ring, eternal glory to an extent. It just happens that the pool is more useful in more situations.
---
I don‚Äôt pk my man.  Just don‚Äôt let myself die to pkers either, at least not without a fight.

Never forget selling bowstrings in seers

I thought account sharing wasn't against the rules, aslong as you don't do infernal for them?

I thought about doing that for a split second since I got thieving up early but I thought surely with increased dps and picking Lizardman tasks it would be faster, fuck me right?

Fuck that‚Äôs a great episode
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Wait logging in through locations is against the rules? I some times use a VPN for netflix, will Jagex ban me for this?
---
void is good for basic afk training on low defense monsters. once you start slaying, dhide+blackmask imbued &gt;&gt;&gt;, and for many bosses dhide &gt; void
---
The thing is I've talked to people who love to play the absolute garbage  I see in the game, and then there's me who plays different content that they see as garbage in the game. It's surprising but everyone enjoys a different set of variables than the rest.
---
Who cares j√§ger literally made the new bh to farm the hot zone with alts and punish legit pkers lol...Loser snitch get a life.
---
Thats why i like the idea of group iron men it removes access to the Ge and you have a small group that you can trade among so you can have a designated fisher/cooker, farmer/herbalist, mining/smithing, etc... i do wish it was on a bigger scale like it was way back when but sadly i dont have a time machine just the knowledge i have now that i wish i had back when i was like 7
---
How so? It's uniques are cheap. And it's requirements are high. 
---
Or are you just in the camp of "it's a skilling boss so it should be shit loot and shit gp so no one does it"
---
Why is getting defense bad I‚Äôve never really played much more than a few hours of runescape.
---
typing class
---
What happened exactly?
---
Falador Massacre, never forget
---
I don't play a ton myself but I think he was a "pure" char meaning he didn't do any combat skills at all. It didn't really truly wreck his character but now he isn't a pure character anymore basically.
---
Thank God I'm not the only one with this problem.
---
People wanted this because they PK on pures as well as mains where the prayers are in different spots. This is about muscle memory and QOL not making PKing easier.
---
That‚Äôs such an interesting thing to try and do why would you only want to play half the game?
---
I think he might be referring to the fact that plasma TVs are older than flatscreen/HDTVs. Older pic = older TV. However, just because it's blurry doesn't necessarily means the picture is old, just possibly shared a lot.
---
Sorry for being a nub but what is the player character wearing in this adore the outfit.
---
Charge it?
---
I completely agree, this would even be useful in PVM but people spite vote because it's QOL that positively affects PVP.
---
Is 75 atk / 70 def / 70 pray a viable med build?
---
It's not just the onyx on the drop table, it's also the chaos runes. The price of the two have been tied together since forever because of the Tzhaar shop. 
---
It costs about 29k chaos runes to buy an onyx from the shop. Zalcano drops about 16 chaos runes per kill. 
---
Because of this, the droprate of onyx is effectively 50-100% more (depending on damage done).

---
Ah alright sorry misinterpreted your original comment
---
People want to fight back without skulling. People are quick to say "lol just fight back" when people complain about getting attacked by salad warriors, then wonder why people don't when skull tricking exists. 
---
Also ma2 skull tricks come to mind.
---
Didn‚Äôt know it was my cakeday, thanks you too!
---
Lmao so fucking what? Vork is bank without uniques and you're just at the drop rate. Somebody has to go dry so it might as well as be you. There's a good chance you will go 10k dry without any visages.
---
Not sure about the BIS part but I like the other stuff
---
Lmao take his spade
---
most of the good gear comes from clues anyways so its a toss up for me personally, i think im going the clue relic purely for quickly getting gear
---
Pures only keep their defense at 1 so their character level stays low for PKing. You're thinking of skillers that don't level their combat at all and stay at level 3.
---
I'm guessing it may prevent some irons from accidentally crashing mains?
---
Every combat stat leveled can contribute to your combat level. Having a low defense means your combat lower can be lower.
---
This is useful because places like the wilderness only allow you to attack players within a certain range of your combat level. So if you are level 35  combat level but you‚Äôve only leveled attack and strength you can hit a lot harder than someone your combat level would be expecting. This can help you kill people since they might get taken by surprise with a big hit.
---
Made me think, is it even possible to get amylase to make stamina pots in Zeah?
---
It's not that it's no combat, it's leveling up your combat stats while keeping 1 defense to keep your combat lvl low
---
Isnt this the guy who red skulled and was slashing a reanimated imp at the ge?
---
The hero we need
---
Wait this is like the meta isn't it?
---
We've come too far.
---
That‚Äôs not it, what the guy is talking about are skillers, people who avoid combat. It‚Äôs just a different enjoyment of the game and different challenges. 
---
A pure is an account that keeps 1 defence and raises offensive stats. The idea is to be glass cannon, hit hard and often at a low combat level. It‚Äôs the center of many pvp builds for low to med level accounts.
---
thanks to people like this guy, i can have an afk alt making gp every time i'm sat at a computer to bond up random accounts whenever i want for fun.
---
actually a hero
---
Try fighting back with right click on if you‚Äôre using brews as your main food source... it‚Äôs about as effective as just turning on auto retaliate. Especially if you‚Äôre going for a spec which pretty much has to be a 1-2 tick or they can just shark brew up to 115hp and you stand no chance of getting the kill. In order to stand a fair chance at getting a kill you pretty much have to put left click on.
---
Well they should
---
You're right, they don't need to at all but that has no bearing on IF they will do it anyway.
---
Are you serious?
---
Oh no is that a t2 relic? I already got the Slayer relic if it is.
---
I think jagex banned osb/runelite plugins that aided in killing demonics around that time.
---
Barrows gloves
---
Yea because even with right click, how am I supposed to be able to tell the difference between the username IiliIiiI and Iiliiil ?
---
my alt
---
I actually like how it is, but didn't mind D so I voted for D just because I knew it made a lot of people mad that it looked... new?
---
What part of 87 slayer, 83 magic is early-game ironman with a trident?
---
Also in order to put the arceuus barrows teleport into the nexus, you need 2000 soul runes and 1000 blood runes, which means bloodvelds for quite a while.
---
What does your alt do?
---
An osrs edition of a star wars version of a Brooklyn 99 joke?
---
How do you guys train smithing in twisted? It seems to go so slow since youre either mining iron and losing half the ore, or mining a ton of coal.
---
Fair enough, but going through your post history would have been a lot more time spent just to bitch that
---
did you think it was worth it to get that early rune/dhides though?
---
1 def accounts seem to be better for pvp. They maximize damage output? That's what I remember last time I saw a post like this.
---
Who cares?
---
this man predicted endurance gang
---
&gt;Am I a brainlet for enjoying the game differently than you,
---
No, of course not. You're a brainlet for pretending you have enough incomplete clue sets that that its the reason your bank is full. I've got 75+ clue loosies, about 40 completely uneeded quest items, every single seed in the game, 20 random pieces of useless jewelry, probably near 35 farming products that serve no purpose, and I'm sure more random shit I will never touch. 
---
Guess what? Still got near 100 bank spots left on a 2k+ iron. You'r bank is just full of trash.
---
scared of my game design expertise arent you
---
Name checks out
---
None of them look good, a complete overhaul would be the only way to save it imo.  The colors just don't go well together.  The purple sticking out looks like some kind of disease.
---
Imagine being that bear in real life
---
It was announced at runefest. It sounds like it'll be pyramid plunder but for agility
---
there is a lot of unbalancing with points but it was just the first time they are doing it will probably be better balanced it the future, at least you would hope so.
---
I think blast mining is the ideal way to get lots of ores. Wintertodt also gives a good chunk of coal and gold drops as well
---
expensive? 5m to build+ 9m for teleports vs portal chamber that cost 1m.
---
It gives me 2 ticks saved every time loading the house (which i do plenty of since its basically a hub with pool for a full reset) 
---
Also you only have to walk 5 steps instead of running all around your house. which saves you 10~ ticks average, which makes it about 15 ticks saved every time you go to the house. 
---
That is 9 seconds every time you going to use your house
---
That means you have to use the house enough for making back 13M.  That is 5.2 Hours at 2.5M an hour. Which is 18720 seconds
---
That makes a fully upgraded portal nexus worth it if you go to your house 2080 times.  Something a lot of people does. I enter my house everyday about 20-50 times.
---
So let‚Äôs say your max hit is 50, eating at 60 is called ‚Äúsafing.‚Äù Basically, if you safe throughout an entire fight, it‚Äôs literally impossible to die. So if you both agree to eat lower, it allows for KO potential for both parties. It‚Äôs possible to get stacked from full hp, but very unlikely. 
---
If you allow to eat above KO threshold, for majority of competent pkers, 95% of fights would end in someone teleporting because they have ran out of food
---
See the other comment I just made above you to the original commenter
---
Buy 95k ea, charge them and sell 120k ea. Heroes quest was a beast moneymaker
---
Range is legit OP. With the right RNG u can 2-3 hit someone if they aren't expecting to be damaged
---
Wtf
---
Snitch
---
Aren't there other clients out there that still have this feature?
---
To elaborate more on the other responses, you have three skills that contribute to your overall combat level. If you keep your defense at 1 and train the other two skills exclusively you will hit much harder (more damage per hit) than another character at the same combat level who has evenly trained all three skills. The advantage of doing more damage with no defense allows you to quickly drain their HP before they can do much damage to you.
---
Hop on twisted league, that seems to be where a lot of people are, every activity is packed lol
---
I'd argue it is. Not everyone is rich. In RS3 learning some new bosses once we (my team and I) each blew around 30-50m in deaths trying to learn, that was a crap ton for me at the time. How punishing do you want this then? 10m?? We don't want it to be so bad that it's prohibitive to bring expensive items.
---
  
---
&gt; That's literally like 6 mins at Vorkath  
---
Vorkath is 10m gp/hr now? We can't rate what is good or bad based on the absolute best case in the game, it needs to be like a scale but again, not overly prohibitive.
---
Eh, c'mon, it's definitely a bit overblown. Before I had a max PoH I would just withdraw the runes for the teleport I needed from the bank, and now with a PoH I just teletab home and use a portal which takes maybe 3 seconds less time?
---
Maybe 85 attack i think you will stop hitting 0 around there
---
harvester is a nuisance in some skills i.e. barb fishing. why does courier get a way to toggle off when beneficial but harvester doesn't?
---
He wasnt talking to you!
---
Killing rune drags, casually waiting for Friday November 29 7PM PST to come up so I can have my Maxing party at tears of guthix on world 303. Oh, what's that? You want to come? Ok but Ill be having a drop party so make sure you have empty inventory spaces
---
Slayer bad rc good sums me up pretty accurately
---
thanks for the replies. Leaning toward the damage but still not sure. Jagex certainly did well for a few of these making it super hard to choose.
---
What does harvester do to barb fishing?
---
Ye. I normally do 10k, then 100k then 5m but sit at the second trade screen on the 5m till they decline.
---
I also flame back for the pvp world trade stall. Then pretend to get my cash stack.. actually get 423gp and say "dude lmao" when they lure me.
---
I like winding these people up :)
---
Your brother earned her trust as a friend, there was a falling out, then he cleaned her bank. Sounds like your brother is kind of a shitty person.

Might they be Shade Robes? They look the same. Shades are found in the catacombs, south of steel dragons. Requires running past Ankou, Dagannoth and possibly Spectres as well.
---
Could be difficult, but could also be worth it if you don't have access to other prayer gear.
---
Construction as a skill is very important to the game due to the amount of gold and items that are sunk through it (considering coins are consumed in the creation of planks). There needs to be some kind of payoff to make construction worth doing. The runes and jewelry saved from teleports, for instance, are much smaller than the tens of millions of gold that are taken out of the game by attaining the bare minimum required level of 83.
---
Don't really see how this is widening the gap. Isn't it maintaining the gap? People already can't reorder prayers. And if you think clicking prayers in slightly different locations is significant for the skill gap then you are silly. If people are using custom clients I'm far less worried about them actually clicking their prayers - no matter where they are, than if they are using a bot to pray switch.

For stone chests?

Port P artifact stealing requires lockpicks, there are some tasks for stealing certain amounts.

U said eating above k0 threshold is frown upon when its not. Only thing that matters is max hit which is true, but people camp 99-115 hp. And while pures can hit a 40x3 gmaul, they realistically arent. And no one fights their combat and below. They also fight higher. A 92 zerk with 99 str is just gunna wreck a 88 pure. And then once u hit over like 80 cmb, zerks start hitting higher. 
---
Its fun to fight pures as pures tho. Pures are also better 3-83ish combat butttttt theres rarely any noobs worth killing in that bracket.
---
Soros funded BH2.

he left her stuff, who leaves 50m in the bank when cleaning someone out
---
I guess, but that is only a specific flavor of pking on an account build I do not have lol but good skills regardless I guess. thanks!
---
ahh. thanks for the info.
---
I just wanna hit people with tomatoes üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Oh shit I didn't even notice that when I made this. Just assumed it was the standard login screen but I capped it after I got logged for inactivity.
---
The problem stems from how strong combat is compared to non combat. There's little reason to cut logs, catch fish, or mine ore when slaying monsters brings in those resources much faster. As such, the only way for skills to be useful is for how well the skill or its products help with doing more combat.
---
For my pure yes, main I'm not sure what's best and obby no obviously lol
---
This was the case in like 2007 but since 2009 its gotten less popular and its basically non existent today. Watch any big name youtuber or streamer and they will eat outside the range or ‚Äúsafe up‚Äù. Amenity or abyss is a popular one and they never sit below 90. Their whole mindset of pking is to not give a chance. 
---
But other dude is right, if u eat at 99hp, its impossible to die. I could fight amenity for 10hours straight and its likely neither of us would die. Pvp in osrs is broke.
---
Oh child
---
"pools is what is truly OP"

"However it's not absurdly strong"

Tell me how this isn't a contradiction.

Getting a lockpick change for this league would be incredible. It's so fucking stupid that the hard diary is locked behind a random reward from a randomly spawned imp (I'm aware imp spawns are consistent, but the imp that spawns is random) that everyone else is also hunting - let alone other tasks being locked behind it too.
---
Musta needed some place to park their cars.
---
I voted for A. I thought the outrage to begin with was kinda dumb lol. I‚Äôve only seen the armor in game once since its release. And that was today at the GE
---
&gt; it‚Äôs literally impossible to die.
---
Seems broken, idk
---
Naw
---
lol look at playerbase before and after GE
---
its fun to say the grass is always greener on the other side, but using in-game/zybez/trading post got really old once the nostalgia wore off

Can you add a requirement to play LMS similar to bounty hunter. LMS bots have been insane since twitch prime membership promotion, and there are ai bots in there that play better than normal players.

This is how big a redwood is

The results on the website don't factor out the skip votes. On the contrary, almost every question passed this time around. You can verify this by checking the results in-game.
---
I mean...I can see your desire for rune ore out there....
---
look at this badass
---
Or - and hear me out - it's both.
---
It's not bis for rune drags, it's BiS for afking rune drags
---
are we serious going to lock more convenient impling catching behind 99 hunter?
---
I would say anyone eating to a point where its literally impossible for them to die is a good pker. Especially if they manage to kill you, isn't that what makes them a good pker? I would call a bad pker someone who listens to the "safer" taunts and gets killed when they could have easily eaten.
---
People only call other pkers bad for safing because they're angry at not having enough skill or know how to stack them out. Then when the other person finally caves and decides not to safe anymore and dies, they get called a nub. It's like 90% the reason for the caved in brainlet pker memes....
---
Tbh Tanner you are a fucking idiot and a scum bag, we‚Äôve all known Emily for years and all had access to her account likewise she has with ours, he only ever gave her 50m once on her birthday so I don‚Äôt know how that justifies stealing over 1b you fucking moron but you of all people should know how easily he is manipulated yet you pushed him to do it, what about the cut of the money you took for making him do it or when you told him to hack her hardcore and kill it.. we treat him like family for years and his own actions had him removed from the stream and our group, you really are scum and you walk all over the poor lad, grow the fuck up.
---
Why not chopyewboys?
---
Rs drama is zo stupid. Your brother is the worst out of this whole thing because of the untradeables tho, gold is w/e but untradeables dont have to be dropped. Because of that i feel like your brother is leaving a lot out of the story to spare himself from judgement, its a common spastic tactic
---
If account sharing is against the rules then why did you give his brother your account?
---
Sorry kiddo, going to be busy with work, won't made it.  
---
haha, no clue why that came to me. Congrats champ.
---
And now another one. [https://i.imgur.com/AX8oPnw.png](https://i.imgur.com/AX8oPnw.png) Same location. Wtf.
---
You're not wrong for sure. I was more talking in regards to how OP is about teleports being the "OP" part of houses. When instead its often the pools that are called OP. 
---
I don't think they're overly strong, but they're definitely the best grind unlock to do on any account. So its fair to say the combo of having nardah statue next to infinite sources of all teleports is actually "OP". But the pool itself isn't absurdly strong.
---
It looks like absolute shit. Full helms looked retarded. If your character idled it would sway side to side and look a mess. Whip would swing from the sun to the earths core in every rotation and looked stupid. The animation for shooting arrows looked horrible. Everything looked dark. Run animation was over the top. Just disgusting graphics and didn‚Äôt fit the simple look the game had always had. My worst fear for this game is this shit being implemented. The day that‚Äôs even considered in a poll is the day I know this game has more post 07 players than pre 08 players and is going right in the direction rs3 went.
---
Its not against the rules, its an "at your own risk" type of thing

It's a name auto-assignment when your username is deemed offensive and you need to change it.

Ehh how do you give it points without rewarding rng too much, a pet is 500 and so it a tbow so I think 250 points is fine.

A month ago you were renting the account out. Scamming. Reported to discord too.
---
The skill gap comes in when people have to switch prayers, switching your offensive and defensive brid fights is critical for people to be able to win. Making it easier to do so is a no brainer. Most people who pk have also pk‚Äôd for a long time and have it like muscle memory. Forcing people to cheat is braindead

You clearly do not know this guy. He's been pking in BH since it came out in day 1. He has been at the top of the scores since day 1. He even streams every now and then! Get some real proof before accusing someone, everyone in the pking community knows that furiousfast7 is #1 rank n BH
---
How‚Äôd you simulate this
---
wave flashbuying rune scimmy 27k - Bignerd
---
Dragon ores - lol nty
---
10 rune rocks, one spawns every 4 mins, *near-ish* bank (I know it‚Äôs not to scale) - Nty
---
Agility course that rewards noted rune ore and crabs that do the same... - Seriously? Lol
---
Dragon Metal Dragons - I would enjoy these in game for the memes. It‚Äôs been joked about on stream a few times
---
‚ÄúRequires DS2 and Quest Cape‚Äù - Can‚Äôt have a *functional* quest cape without DS2 completed 
---
Two chaos ele spawns - I don‚Äôt know much of rs lore, but I‚Äôm not sure that makes sense since there‚Äôs only one of each boss/Demi spawned on any world at any given time (not counting instances). 
---
I would actually enjoy a wildy expansion, but before that I think we need the mechanics of the current wildy bosses (for the most part) reworked.
---
He didn't say it killed the game.
---
Idk what world you were using at seers course, back when I was playing the main game and training agility, I was doing laps with a lot of people.
---
As someone who never played this game, this just sounds like terrible design
---
Konar keys can give a lot of coal, sulphur lizards drop a lot of noted supplies, you can mine iron and coal right next to a furnace in lova
---
Easy clue scroll  
---
They have the clue scroll relic
---
Haha it really bugs you that you can't control how other players play the game
---
but then...cant you turn around and kill them easily? wont it work both ways?
---
I started a couple days ago. IMO its better to start a little later than everyone unless you're going for ranks. (The low level stuff isn't insanely crowded after the first week like it was on day 1)
---
get good

wait but then isnt being a pure unconquerable then? because your misleading your opponent as to what is safe? in that case why bother being Honorable yourself if you opponent is a pure?
---
His response was woeful
---
I disagree, even with those stipulations I think there are way too many gilded pieces around. I have seen way too many gilded pieces, megarare is around 1/1000 right. But just off the youtubers I watch a friend has rolled it twice, mudkip once and I believe solo mission did as well (might have been one of the other youtubers). all of them combined aren't at even 500 clues, I only watch 2 other twisted league youtubers. Maybe all the youtubers are getting lucky but those rolls have looked pretty common.
---
Won‚Äôt need any pages for those either
---
Honestly, what as time to hit it. Usually absolutely fucking useless in the main game, but getting that many antifires without having to kill brutal blues is actually awesome.
---
dw I also failed calc 2
---
What did gambit say?
---
Huh, TIL OSRS invented Player suggestion and feedback.
---
It‚Äôs that 816 luck :P
---
It depends on the style and bracket. In all brackets you can get 1 popped. AGS to gmaul combo in all brackets can 100-0. What makes a good pkers is consistency. You will get 1 popped frequently from RNG, but the better your reaction to eating and specing etc, you will kill more than you die.
---
Dharok's has higher skill cap because of vengence timing with removing armour etc Also hybriding especially NHing has high skill ceiling
---
You also have to remember about lag. I live in aus and I play on like 250 ping to a US bh world. So if I don't eat within a half a tick window, my eat will not go through and I will die. If you don't have that lag issue, you can have a 1 tick reaction with all your eating and still live.
---
Don‚Äôt you just have to touch the lodestone once to unlock it? I‚Äôd say unlimited teleports with barely any effort is a lot more op.
---
6 Million Yews
---
&gt; Zulrah all over again 
---
Yeh no it isnt. Reach of the century. You clearly didn't experience launch Zulrah loot table..
---
You're using the same arguments to justify it so yeah. Point is "don't like it don't use it" is a shit argument
---
So called pure accounts for PKing(player killing) where you keep your defence at level 1. this results in a lower combat level, which allows you to attack lower level players than you otherwise would in PvP scenarios. Training defence that high could ruin an account spent many hundred hours on.
---
Its what i dont like about Vorkath is the 2 uniques worth anything are 1 in 5000 and ones a measly 5m and the other 30m.
---
I know the normal loot adds up. But idk i like to boss knowing theres a realistic potential of getting something cool. This is why Hydra is the perfect boss, for me at least.
---
Because that's entirely subjective? There's no clear threshold for what's considered game changing
---
definitely worrying considering streamers were actively talking about it in their private content creator discord while it was happening.  they were being told to check the discord by other streamers as they went online and then would go silent on it or dismiss it (gimp boys and sick nerd are who i was watching specifically)
---
how much of the vote do high end pkers represent?
---
Its most likely a bug. I had this issue a couple months ago and was given a link to an faq explaining there is a bug causing this and saying they are "working" on fixing it. But this was from the Twitter support who didn't even have my username so it was just a guess. When I tried a support ticket thru the website to confirm it was just a bug, and that no foreign ip address was trying to access my account I got no response. When I sent 2 more tickets over the course of a week I still got no response. When I sent a 4th ticket the next week saying "I can't log in. Is it a bug? Is it a hacker? Who knows!!! Fix your fucking game" I got a response in 30 minutes telling me that if I'm rude they may stop replying to my support requests. O the irony.
---
Yeah I'm also really happy about it, I spent a shit ton on my house and was kinda bummed that I couldn't use Arceuus teleports - it didn't make sense that normal, lunar, and ancient spells are available but the newest ones aren't.
---
I'm a main so I don't give a shit how this will affect irons, and what percentage of irons rushes construction of all skills so they can do barrows? That's such a small number it shouldn't matter to anyone. Arguments against are delusional.
---
that would be because a good amount of knowledgable pkers don't waste their time and effort picking up kills that are worth 50k. a lot of pkers prefer an actual fight and not a stomp, but the pvm community labels the entirety of them as racist assholes who type sit after killing some dude at chaos altar. 
---
i was busy doing mage training arena crap to get some more imbued capes for my mage hybrid and some max combat dude tries to pk me with nothing but ice barrage and dragonstone bolts. i was so bemused i just swapped prayers when necessary and walked back to bank - he didn't even wait for me to actually leave the area. most of the time inexperienced pkers are looking for players who will panic and forget that they have options available to keep them from dying
---
honestly osrs needs a pvp update that introduces simple concepts of surviving in wilderness. it's honestly really fun to be on both sides (skiller trying to survive/anti pk, pker trying to get a kill), but nervous players will never bother to learn about it
---
And its absolutely insane exp. Finally got a lockpick after 15+ young imps and the exp rate with full buffs is around 3.5-4m/hr
---
Buff thermy then
---
so how did you fix it? 
---
or should i just email them and hope for the best
---
follow the optimal quest guide for barrows gloves, youtube herb runs
---
i use the old portals for wildy teleports and put them kinda far away so i don't misclick them
---
&gt;	the jew box
---
something something ash tray
---
To my knowledge, smithing the shayzien armour sets in lova is the fastest method for smithing xp, with the down side being that you don't actually get anything as a result.
---
If you want to smelt iron, I highly recommend making yourself some ring of forgings. That requires 44 construction to get the ring mold, as well as rubies which I got plenty of from the lizardman chest and konar slayer keys.
---
The fuck is a golden chinchompa
---
&gt;multi
---
ya no I'll pass
---
&gt; Some things just fucking suck to do, like training Runecrafting,
---
Dont do it then you reddit baby. Its a sand box game.
---
most stuff you kill on slayer task ends up favoring str ammy too provided it's that max hit interval.
---
I just checked and you are correct, I have the wrong pet drop rate there, I shall fix
---
No one fishes swordfish because they're shit gp, shit xp, and shit food.
---
ya like I know that a lot of people have said they should sell them in general stores but they don't even need to go that far imo they need to at least increase the droprate on lockpicks significantly or increase the number of young imps to other imp ratio for TL
---
It just stopped doing it eventually. It's possible they did something but if they did they did not communicate it to me at all.
---
Man you guys in this chain talk a lot about pj timers and spec trades but dont actually know how they work. A long pj timer means not getting an npc box. So tb = death. As for spec trades there is already a 10 to 15 second timer between different peoples specs.
---
This pvmer circle jerk is going to make it worse for you guys. 
---
If you keep running into single clans. Just keep an alt logged out near ur wildy spot and box urself when the fall in on you. They cant do fuck all about that.
---
Can we please keep untrimmed 99s?  Also, can we get an updated count of untrimmed and trimmed skill capes?
---
For sure - you save a bunch on prayer/stamina potions in the long run, and a few seconds of time. But construction is expensive to train so it does take quite awhile to pay off
---
The spec restore is the only thing you can't put a price on - but IMO even that is a bit overrated
---
Well that's a good change, though I would have preferred if they just made it enjoyable of course
---
Damn nice, too bad you can only use the bloods and cape in TL.
---
Interesting! I didn't know that the game would prioritise the pet over the resource or that you are limited to one of a specific pet - thanks!
---
Nice I literally just watched this move last night
---
Btw boosting with the clan i can still make like 40m an hour but it isnt fun.
---
It got removed recently, but is still part of some "cheat clients" like runelite+ as far as i am aware.
---
Don't give money to f2p noobs, give energy potions.
---
WASAAAAAAAP
---
Crashing item prices ain't cool, idgaf what boss it is.
---
"walking"
---
well there's your first mistake
---
Use rune scimi with chop
---
what if he used 2 hands tho
---
Thought he said 'the obnoxious guy' referencing the other person not odablock L
---
I don't get it he levels up?
---
Most players plant in a specific pattern (3 on one side, 2 on the other) for efficiency. Generally one person takes one side, and the other person takes the remaining 5 spots.
---
This guy joined and started planting randomly, ruining both players' patterns and forcing them to just leave to avoid wasting any more time. Most likely this was their intention and is a reportable offense, unfortunately Jagex almost never ban for griefing though.
---
Most people have just relocated.  People are social in clan chats and discord these days, not so much random social interaction at skilling spots.
---
Imagine working, this is why I've been maxed and ur just now getting to it
---
Just got 93 slayer and would like to double check my magic gear. I don't have the money for ancestrals atm but I do have imbued heart. As far as I'm aware mage bonus doesn't matter for dust/nech but does matter for smokes (is that right?)
---
Up until now on dusts/nechs its been kodai, holy sandals, imbued god cape, god robes, ring of wealth and bracelets of slaughter.
---
For smokes I am just swapping god robes for ahrims and the ring of wealth for seers ring (i). Could get eternal boots if that helped much (?)
---
Other than that is my gear fairly standard for a non ancestral setup?
---
&gt;25% to keep it or 75% against it to ditch it
---
Nah if option D got 50% of the votes it would win, doesn't matter what the rest were
---
... turning my 20 second return time into 5 minutes.. that is 500% worse than what we had for years. I like change but im not a fan of backwards game design like this.
---
I don't play ruinscape but I do know accounts with lvl 1 defence are special or something?
---
POHscape bad
---
Ok
---
Thanks !
---
It was one of the best added features.
---
stop it, get some help.
---
And how can you create a reddit account just to be an asshole?
---
Imagine not taking the free tele to edgeville 
---
This message was brought to you by 3 item gang
---
Ahhh thanks for the explaining, what a fucking cockrat
---
If anyone do this to me ill skin myself alive
---
Should we feel sorry for you?
---
 yes daddy tell it like it is**üò©üò©üí¶üí¶**
---
Omg... could you imagine mindless skilling in VR Runescape? non stop swinging your axe at a tree in game till 99...
---
What? I don't blame the community as a whole, and never said I did.
---
I can understand the notion that voting on your own interests, and thus against those of PVPers is a reasonable perspective for PVMers. My issue arises when updates that have ZERO negative impact on PVMers but help PKers don't pass.
---
Give me a justification for why ring imbues in LMS didn't pass. PKers are literally the only people who need to imbue the same rings several times.
---
Give me a justification for why tradeable Rune Pouches were effectively removed from the game, despite always being tradable since their release.
---
Give me a justification for why these moveable prayers didn't pass.
---
On top of that, enough with this bullshit "baiting PVMers with good gp/h". How long have you been playing? Have you forgotten the days where the Wilderness offered all the best gp/h and xp/h?
---
You're right, I should be mad at Jagex, but not for the reason you think. I'm mad that they still haven't reintroduced any form of risk in this game because a couple of losers now in prison could take down their servers on a whim. That is the root cause of all animosity towards PKers.
---
Before safe death mechanics, complaining about the wilderness would get you openly mocked and called a little baby, even in this very subreddit. I saw the changes happen, and the brainlet memes accelerated the phenomena exponentially. Several people form their opinion of PKers based purely on the satirical way in which they're portrayed here.
---
i swear to god the majority of this community has brains atrophied from third party client usage. just click the prayer idiot, it's not hard.
---
Nice, also what do you need those 102k buckets for
---
Yeah, he really showed him how gay he was.
---
I understand you may be being sarcastic but yeah, I'm kinda excited by this. Gotta get that Guthix scimmy hilt anyway.
---
Ardy knights are pretty brain dead, pyramid plunder also isn‚Äôt bad
---
With that being said, brutal blues aren't too bad to kill with just protect from mage and some food.
---
I know because I had to get some antifires and was dreading it myself, but an MSB with Broad Arrows and a few invents of salmon were fine in the end.
---
Thanks for this, you just altered my current goal significantly
---
Oh god.  This game was only about a minute longer than usual and with max melee minus inferno cape, dhing only gets me about 550 on games that I end up carrying.  Granted, I pretty much afk when there isn't a portal with a shield down or a clog to barrage.  Or a brawler is in my way and I'm too lazy to click around him.
---
No, you're arguing for the sake of arguing. If you were making any kind of valid mechanical or game reasons why they should keep it that'd be constructive. Everything you say is just condescending.
---
I think the vast majority of this community doesn't actually care even remotely about the direction of the game. It's really all about the "right now, right here" mentality and you can see it with the way voting in this game has gone since release. I do kind of agree with your points, however, I think we are very much past the point of *trying* to turn a retro experience into something it isn't. We've already turned it many times over.  If you took what osrs IS currently and showed the launch community what it would become, they'd all scoff. 
---
But in reality, it's they who voted in the nmz, the zulrah, the Slayer easyscape meta, etc. The game isn't a retro experience anymore for the core community. I'd argue it's something more of a drug to most of them and any update that makes that dopamine hit harder is always going to trump the health of the actual game.
---
80% chance to have skeletal visage or vorki in 3k kc, 89% chance to have either visages or vorki in 3k kc
---
Most reposted meme: Holy shit Jim where did you learn to type so fast? Idk haha... (Varrok west bank in background)
---
because that's the entire point of a reboot of an old game - there is a direct and measurable tangible value in that experience, if there wasn't retro reboots wouldn't exist. modern pixel art games wouldn't exist. modern games running on the 3d realms engine wouldn't exist.
---
constantly updating a game to bring in almost all and every modern features detracts from that value.
---
I'm capable of playing without prayer reordering, but it's just annoying...
---
50% of the prayers are never touched again past a certain point, and basically every MMO in the world allows you to reorganise or remove useless UI assets if you don't want them.
---
Apparently spellbook filters to remove clutter is okay, but prayer reordering is just easyscape
---
charged glory amulet for 120k damn miss those days
---
Trimmed skillcape is +4 prayer, 3a cloak is +5 prayer.
---
Cloak has 5, trimmed con has 4. I was obviously assuming it would be trimmed, hoping people aren't that insane but tbh I'm expecting some 99 construction untrimmed capes to show up later
---
ye dont worry if you check my post history I made a troll post about the bounty rewards and farmed one of these redditors nh staking for 10m lol
---
Morals though
---
Do you need to buy the cheap tiers of outfit for the lvl 3 one?
---
keeping it the way it is preserves how that interaction occurs. that's a valid reason.
---
Lol check dm. I sent it before seeing this btw. Spooky haha.
---
People saying this is good for pvp for pkers killing people, yeah it is. Its also good for bossing as you can move your prayers under where your switches are in you I ventory to make it easier. It's also good for people being pked as you can swap prayers quicker, tank better and have a much better chance of escaping! This is literally an all round QOL update
---
Nowadays I‚Äôm happy to get less damage and have super fast games.  Idk if you remember that PC clans back in the day that would have literally 30 second games because all the portals could be attacked at the same time and there was only 1 boat, so there was a swiftswitch group that had all mains that would switch worlds whenever too many low levels found the world.  
---
Not gonna lie it was crazy to have games where you barely hit 50 damage.  People were such garbage at PC back then if you wanted to get good xp you had to find a way in to the PC world.  It‚Äôs good they changed it though, now everyone seems to know to attack the portal so most games are done in around the minimum time anyway.   But yeah getting 1500 in that time is a lot.
---
Dude read the rest of the thread before you try breaking into a comment chain that's almost an hour old lol
---
Because the RS3 web team does the OSRS page also and haven't fixed it
---
It changes, I think the cc thievinghost

Then join the world where people are in

if you think that you don't understand the question.

Hey neighbor

Alright, thanks!

Ten bucks says my Weenie is a substantional amount larger than yours, pal
---
The corrupted should be revisited as well, it still feels too RNG in the fight. You can prepare really well and still get trashed and waste 10-12 mins.
---
Mate there's been multiple threads on it and a yt video postes about it, it's not made up
---
Henky penky
---
Lol wildy content
---
People would just use bots for optimum moves.
---
It's not about the time, it's abiut the fact that a lot more had already been said but you're responding as if it never has.
---
Even if vote would be "any Armour different than option A" it would not pass.
---
&gt; Osrs isn't a retro experience anymore.
---
it is in some aspects - the game hasn't completely altered into a modern MMO experience. i am for preserving what is left - out of my own self interest of enjoying those aspects and qualities.
---
&gt;can you genuinely sit here and tell people that they're absurd for wanting updates and changes??????
---
the position of wanting to change a retro experience into a modern MMO experience is absurd, there really isn't any getting around that. the equivalent would be "i want to play this really hard sport without training or anything that i deem too hard".
---
also you're falling into some weird sunk cost fallacy, where you believe that since OSRS has received lots of updates to modernize it, that it is now completely not a retro experience. when in fact the way people interact with prayer in the game now is more like a retro experience than that of a modern MMO. if it was a modern MMO as per - "People are not TRYING to change osrs from a retro game experience. They already HAVE." - you'd be using far more modern methods of interacting with prayer i.e. keybinds.
---
Weird parent flex but okay. Nah just kidding, congrats ;)
---
&gt; Lets be honest, your no vote is just purely selfish. This would have improved pvm and pvp.
---
Every vote is selfish. A player likes a feature, votes yes. A player doesn't like it, votes no, and is labelled a dick.
---
If you want to play a game where the community _doesn't_ have a say in updates, there's plenty of those out there.
---
If you want to play the game at a clunky disadvantage that is all you. If players would like to improve their experience, have modern features, and play the game like it's 2019 they should fully be allowed to. Obviously there have been things third party programs have over stepped in with removing actions typically required for things, and to that I agree is too far. But simply being able to re-organize prayers, or even as far as PvM overlays should be up to the player if they want that kind of experience with the game. I don't think the dead horse of this isn't 2007 anymore, and even other retro games are modded and updated to expand their longevity and playablilty for modern times. If you enjoy the vanilla experience, and don't want to play that way then I wholly believe the stock client should be left as is. Jagex should worry on making good content. Let the community worry about the QoL client side options. But no matter, I've said the things I need to say to make my point. Continuing this would just be kinda silly for me. Cheers mate.
---
that's your opinion. at least i didn't paint you as x y and z to add what is ultimately nothing to the conversation.
---
Yesss, feed me
---
So you return with looting bags to where? If you are multi pking why would you bring looting bags lol, and if youre single pking why are you dieing so often? I mean Im just trying to help you lol, what other solutions do you have atm? Screaming and crying on reddit? Sorry for trying to help! =P
---
Right in the feels
---
You literally started the comment chain with a condescending remark, you painted yourself that way from the start. I mean a quick look at your recent posts is all anyone really needs to know. Cheers!
---
I see Zeah I assume twisted league, gl on the main though

That‚Äôs why he said mostly

Hi Daunt, this was asked on a recent Q&amp;A and added to the backlog :)

---
"too common". That's what I thought, aye?
---
&gt;I would say anyone eating to a point where its literally impossible for them to die is a good pker.  
---
In an edgeville style fight with a specialized account? No, they're not. Those fights are extremely fast paced and if you want to stay above 80+ hp you're going to be eating most of the time and if you're eating you're not attacking. You will never get a chance to kill anyone before you run out of supplies. Now consider that if you do this, then your opponent will either do the same thing and constantly safe to full hp or just teleport away because escaping your attacker in this setting is extremely trivial and they don't want to waste their time with a fight that has no chance of anyone dying. Also, a big part of pking in that sort of setting is knowing when to risk having low hp for an opportunity to kill your opponent. You may never die, but you'll never kill anyone either.
---
yeh i know i was just saying id pay that much for an instance sick of people crashing
---
It‚Äôs about using common sense. If you‚Äôre trying to anti someone in a singles team (pretty much all the people that have names like that) you are begging to die anyway.
---
its not real broski lol
---
They did pass by a large margin. Check in-game.
---
Was going to get the Giant Pouch for runecrafting, since im still missing 77 rc :D Using Abyssal Bracelet so i dont get skull when entering the abyss :D
---
Ayyyy
---
Imagine believing that they will get banned. Im just sad that i ll have to go rogue just to compete
---
Imagine staying at that shit boss after getting the pet
---
yeh but it needs to b better especially if u doin 25 x 4 only room for 1 there
---
+12 ranged str for magic longbow would change absolutely nothing I'm afraid. Being 2 ticks slower than shortbows warrants a much bigger buff than that to be competible. Their accuracy and dmg have to be comparable to cbows, and then we're talking 30-40 ranged str on the magic longbow itself.
---
Ahh makes sense! Wasn‚Äôt sure if I was missing some strange new meta for gwd!
---
I know but I'm curious how much it is if it were to be sold taking out the fact that it would inflate the market causing prices to drop (unless sell limit stops it)
---
At least they had a safe spot brother, I got temple spiders at lvl 50
---
Check the poll :)
---
Ugh I really don't get why the clue available to F2p and designed to get people into real clues has been given a stretch goal. :/
---
That title hurted
---
Lmao you're acting like such a cry baby dude..
---
No you suggesting people go play a different game because they disagree with what you think osrs should be is hypocritical.
---
License plates are in public and you really can‚Äôt trace identities through them.
---
I feel attacked
---
Once you get to 77rc it sure is. Before that, it is complete aids.
---
Cya
---
That UI tooltip to show your jewelery charges in the top left corner is the most pointless plugin I've seen ROFL.
---
But grats on the boots I'm definitely not filled with 309 more clues worth of jealousy ;)
---
Having spec refill is a pretty big difference for a few later game things, which clan wars doesn't refill.
---
If anything, I'd just consider the fact you have a "one stop shop" of world accessibility from your POH to potentially be viewed as a little wild, but like you said, you have to spend millions of GP and time to get construction up to 83+, so it's kind of a tradeoff that I feel makes it alright.
---
Did you per chance test this on a device you'd already logged into and authenticated..?
---
&gt;Every vote is selfish. A player likes a feature, votes yes. A player doesn't like it, votes no, and is labelled a dick.
---
Wrong, some of us try to think if the update would benefit the game or not and vote that way.
---
I mean there's a time to risk and a time not to risk, it's all about taking the opportunity whilst never giving them the opportunity. If someone won't fight me because they haven't got that opportunity then I've already won because that's one fight where I don't have to risk it.
---
I get what you mean by saying that you wont ever have a chance to hit but it's all about RNG, not to keep using Torvesta as an example but he's just one of many great pkers out there because he picks and chooses his fights. People say he safes all the time and by many people's standards he does. He just knows when to go for a kill and what bare minimum HP he's always safe at. Yeah he dies on occasion but 85% of the time he's safe.
---
Whats your point? he posted a picture of his bans without any context and its from may 2019.
---
Is there any point in pking on pvp worlds if I don‚Äôt have a maxed main or some sort of pure?  I started off with the intent of being a range pure a while back, but that didn‚Äôt last long.
---

Pretty all over the place, but I really liked pking back in the day, but I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll just get wrecked.  
---
Tl;dr Can I Pk without a pure or maxed acc?
---
Website polls count skips as no. This was a known and warned about side affect when the feature was pushed into polls. Check results in game for accurate displays, or calc percentages manually.
---
Yeah, but I don't think that re-ordering prayer makes the game a lot easier. Regardless, having randomly ordered or clunky interfaces isn't a good way of introducing difficulty. I'll repeat what I said in a different comment. If the situatin was reversed, and we could already reorder prayers, would you yes in this poll: "Should we rearreange everyones prayer to some random configuration and disable the ability reorder them, in order to increase difficulty?" If you can't move your prayers, why should you be able to move your inventory?
---
This only deactivates the 2FA for your device
---
Hugh, I haven't done it to cause financial dmage to jagex, I just stopped because I wanted to (even if the occasion of being falsely banned is extremly rare etc., it is a threat I don't want to be exposed to). It was meant to be an adivice and mental support to the op and not to you. Don't worry you don't even have to care, if all you do is being dumb in a sarcastic way. ;P
---
I agree. You can also think of construction as a money sink. Same effect as duel tax, removes money from the game
---
These aren't probabilities per piece, just for hitting the mega rare drop table. It's about 1/1600 for hards and 1/800ish for masters
---
Sorry, what the heck are you talking about? Did you look at the post?
---
Vote yes, thats all you need!
---
Yeah even that would be better.
---
Welcome to OSRS, I hope you're having fun.
---
I was playing f2p a while back and barbarian village fly fishing was popping. It seriously felt like I was playing RS2.
---
You have them hards in a junk tab?!
---
My home base is GE cos I use ring of wealth to tele there are pretty much doing anything. And once I have the cash I will change my respawn location to Edgeville
---
From what I understand, they're the only ones who can, and that's why it hasn't been done.
---
Did the graceful poll question pass or fail?
---
Or did I just imagine the question?!
---
The ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù for me were 08-10, when Trade limit and no wildy was a thing.
---
Resources were actually worth a lot which is what kept me into the game. 5.5k Dragon Bones? 900GP Big Bones? 3.3k Limp roots? Near 400gp Iron Ore? 
---
What id do to go back to those days
---
Yeah you kind of need to give context instead 9f vague stuff like this. Otherwise this post has zero traction and comes off like you were botting
---
only actual pvm'ers think that, cox and tob have been out for ages already
---
ofc the average person is like 1k total with not even a fire cape lol.
---
If you word it that way it seems unfair, but imagine if the armour didn't exist in game atm and there were these 4 designs with the current votes. Would you still be upset? The majority didn't want that one design, but it still had the most votes.  If any other choice had won, it'd still be the same. 
---
If they did poll for a redesign and that won a poll, you'd still end up with people being upset because the one redesign they wanted didn't win. Then they might regret ever voting for a redesign. No matter the scenario, it would be a pain.
---
Exactly. All in all, I think it's in a good place. By the time you can afford to spare the gp to get 83+ construction, as well as pay for the pieces that make it so great, it's kind of like "you've earned it" levels of QoL benefits.
---
Would that shit be *wild* early game? Hell yeah. But I think it's very comfy where it's at.
---
Gambit is also the same guy that thinks that we should poll Ironman stuff in a way that only Ironmen can vote.  
---
Not sure what you'd expect from him.
---
Just delete this set from the game honestly
---
Underrated post today
---
It's honestly not that bad :) most people kill it within a minute or two.

Get full obby set with berserker necklace and go do nmz instead

It's the account I had since I was a kid, it's the one I grew up with and the one I had the 10 year cape on on RS3, so I didn't use it much true but it's the one with the memories and old friends on
---
No you don't lol, if you have the stats for it (high 80s at least), you can do it at 100% success rate.
---
Correct. What I'm saying is that if runelite didn't implement this add-on to the client, there most likely would have never been a poll.
---
Du din j√¶vel
---
Yea, it is, it is just slow. I just like having options for skills that offer decent xp/hr without being ridiculously sweaty. But maybe thats ezscape. I feel like runs are like 90% focus for little gain compared to other skills. Might just be a symptom of how the skill is designed to work. Just wish there was a bit more afk to it without suffering xp but again, maybe thats ezscape.
---
Elysian is only ‚Äúniche‚Äù because of pvm meta. But it is 100% designed to be not a niche shield lmao. It it the best defensive shield in the game; that is not even close to the definition of niche. Spectral on the other hand is niche because prayer draining attacks only happen at some bosses and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt mention it. 
---
For attack speed I get why it should be slower, but if it‚Äôs slower then the str bonus and accuracy have gotta be much higher than being just equal to rapier and saeldor. I know it has +1 increase in crush accuracy and +2 prayer over the other 2 but that‚Äôs must marginal
---
The staff has a +15% dmg boost too. Like wtf?
---
Surely you‚Äôre being a bit disingenuous with your argument because magic already does all of that now and yet no one pks with it as a primary dps style. It‚Äôs always simply been a support style because auto casting barrage (blood to heal or ice to freeze) is worse than just using an MSB and amethyst arrows with dhides. In fact, you chose to exemplify all of the positives of magic without equally stating it‚Äôs woeful cons, such as inventory space management, terrible DPS, extreme accuracy debuffs when hitting someone with a simple black dhide top on and nothing else, expensive gear to ensure that you have acceptable accuracy (which means huge gp risk compared to the other combat styles) when the other styles only primarily require a good weapon for decent accuracy, non-existant KO options and the new KO option will be the only one in existence for magic and will be expensive when ranged and melee can KO you with weapons as cheap as 20k gp.
---
All in all, yes, I do support magic having a KO option since it‚Äôs miles more expensive to utilize in PvP compared to the other combat forms, as well as magic coming with a ton of other negatives that you failed to mention to bolster your argument.
---
And yet this is the part most people enjoy and benefit from (and has created better metas of killing bosses, like solo corp, sire, zulrah, even pking. It's streamlined the entire game and it comes at a steep cost and level requirement.
---
&gt;Also, if runelite never introduced this concept, no one would be asking for it.
---
I dunno about that.  This has been polled like 37 times now, I wouldn't be surprised if the first few were before RL was a thing.  Hell, RL having it meant that for a while no one particularly wanted it in vanilla.
---
Because the game was absolute shit when stuff like that existed. They got rid of it for a reason
---
Look up a guide on youtube?
---
Theres no reason for the threshold to be anything other than 100% health and stats. The problem is atm that even then it isn't considered reset atm
---
Not sure why people are screaming powercreep. Mage has always been the weakest combat type outside of ancients in pvp. Mage is the most expensive combat out of the 3 as you can't get runes back. Don't see what's wrong in making it at least viable with the other 2. It's still not as strong as other 2 for most things
---
It definitely doesn't make it obsolete, it's only better when using the crush style, otherwise the new armour has a negative slash/stab bonus and MUCH lower defense (Especially ranged), with identical strength bonus
---
I want to specifically address this part of your seething rant:
---
&gt;Lmao. OSRS is mindless grinding and clicking. The fuck are you talking about plenty of difficult content? The only difficult content in this entire fucking game is the inferno. This is genuinely the stupidest take I've ever seen on this subreddit.
---
As I mentioned earlier there's a big difference between something being 'hard' because it's boring and something being 'hard' because it's a grind.
---
For instance I think RC is a pretty common complaint around here not because it's a long grind, but because it's a boring and repetitive grind. (I personally believe RC is fundamentally broken because of its small scope, but that's a different story).
---
But compare that to pretty much any other skill and you can see the difference in 'difficulty'. If I'm doing farming I have plenty of activity options I can jump around to. Slayer gets its difficulty from extensive knowledge of monsters.
---
Skills more comparable to RC like mining and wc at least are a bit more afk and provide a few more training methods. RC is very much not AFK AND lacks variety. But for some reason you can't bring that up around here without a bunch of elitest pricks making fun of you.
---
Honestly I've always felt being a more casual player allows me to enjoy the game more. You're right that it's essentially repeating point and click tasks. Imo the best way to keep it interesting is to let go of a concern for whatever is most effecient and just play the damn game.
---
Until it becomes the strongest thing.
---
&gt; I wouldn't just say 'well, let's just play around that gapping hole in the board and pretend its not there'.
---
Cause you wouldn't play that game at all. But here we are.
---
Wooooow
---
Any chance I‚Äôll get to have fun with 6 jads in this tournament world?
---
Why? It's a large part of the game.
---
Can i ask why?
---
^ Also there's a "peek" option on the door to quickly see how many are inside. At peak times you may well have to 5 man, but most of the time it's polite (and smart) to hop to try to find a world with less people.
---
&gt;  jagex caters to them far to much.
---
how so?
---
I mean he‚Äôs got a point there
---
Doesn‚Äôt give a shit gang ü§ô
---
Also, someone else said it, but ‚ÄúReddit isn‚Äôt always the popular opinion. A lot of people who aren‚Äôt on Reddit think differently‚Äù
---
Degrading doesn't add anything to items other than making them annoying to use. It's already annoying enough to refill your blowpipe or trident.
---
I really like the Nightmare's weird body contortion/spin attack thing, looks freaky as hell in the best way possible. So, you know, good job and all that
---
Have you actually done the inferno before?  It's really easy to sgs spec in any scenario that you would be able to mage spec considering you can hide behind pillar after each attack turn and negate all damage through prayer the same way you would have to with any spec weapon (you can't magically skip monster atk turns via a mage spec).
---
RIP arcane spirit shield, will be completely useless. A new mage book with 25 mage attack AND 10% damage? Lmfao
---
philosophy of eve online tbh
---
That is good, what will be the best way to give feedback once that is out?
---
&gt; They got rid of it for a reason
---
Yeah, EZScape.
---
The tool seeds aren't actually in super high demand, due to the fact they require crystals to charge, and the fact they are detachable and resellable means there are only ever more entering the market.
---
Even if the numbers can‚Äôt be fixed, once the poll closes can ‚ÄúPassed‚Äù or ‚ÄúFailed‚Äù be added to the questions? It‚Äôs not an ideal solution, but it would save the inconvenience of doing the math if you can‚Äôt log in to the game at the moment.
---
With negative pray and no defense bonuses. Its strong for sure but its not far off where it needs to be
---
Because if you wanted an easier gamemode, you shouldn't have signed up for Ironman mode.
---
panic buy tome of fires
---
I bought bottomless bucket at release of farming guild because I wanted that sweet timesave that it gave me doing tree/fruit tree/herb runs. At the time it was 2m. Now it's 400k. This is just how uniques are at release, because the market hasn't stabilized on that item yet. At launch, demand is MUCH higher than supply, but it evens out eventually.
---
That makes me wish it fired an orb that burst into 4 projectiles or something similar
---
Because the fee is there for a reason, circumventing it by doing it in a world where everything is free is so dumb.
---
There is nothing preventing this.
---
If you do indeed do inferno, you would know that sgs specs are free in there using pillars.
---
I personally haven't seen a poll regarding the rearrangement of prayers. 
---
I agree with your last statement.
---
Don't you dare.
---
Agreed.
---
Voting no to the book. Too op
---
I get more kills in dps than tank 10000%
---
Doesn't going with a group count as long as you get the kill?
---
You don't find players cheating using steroids and then put your whole team on steroids to compensate. You keep the game as it is, with the rules as they are and you learn to play by the rules with the equipment you are given. If you can't click a prayer because it's 12 pixels too far away then turn up your dpi or mouse sensitivity. Don't even give me that crap about "oh but my muscle memory" everybody deals with muscle memory, get used to it.
---
imagine barraging slayer with it lol
---
Yes it's a good ring slot.   Personally I bring a three way switch, zerker(i), seers(i), archer(i)  but if you're new to DKs or item switching I'd reccomend just sticking with the brimstone boi
---
Ah yes, the questions Jagex should be answering.
---
Powercreep exists in pve too btw
---
In under 10 wilderness fire surge is crazy good if you intent to use magic for dps.
---
Fair nd square
---
.... you cut off the whole part that the "this" was referring to and decided my tinfoil shit was a direct quote from a jmod like for real dude, grow the fuck up.
---
Tbh ur stats are pretty low for callisto if u do not set up a safespot
---
I see your point too, it feels weird for it to have that defense requirement and it could easily have a higher requirement, I'm not sure why they chose 30 either (Maybe they base the defense requirement on the defensive stats? That would make sense)   
---
That being said, I don't see anyone at all equipping this early-on as you say since it'll likely be hundreds of mils for quite a while haha
---
People will just wear trash. Which makes getting good gear pointless, ruining progression. Theres more risk in having to pay a fee after you die than if it was the other way around and people risked nothing.
---
Nobody is going to risk prims or anything good if you have 100% chance to lose it because you got bad rng or servers lagged.
---
Autocorrect and didn‚Äôt check the spelling in my rage my bad
---
New proposed boss
---
That's one of the propoaed drops
---
Defense bonuses don‚Äôt matter really, with prayer and sang. Pray bonus is a little better but you can just bring an extra pray pot and poh between kills for most things lol. No reason for the book to have more accuracy than arcane and more magic str than full ancestral and ma2 cape
---
Wasn‚Äôt sure what the card game had to do with it but figured it was some weird figure of speech I wasn‚Äôt aware of haha
---
Alch urself, i hope u used up the rest of ur lifes RNG
---
Why does everyone say the same thing when someone apologizes for bad English lol
---
I have a feeling English is their native language too
---
I'm so set in my ways with the current positions I wouldn't use the feature but I really don't see why this is any topic of great debate. Where other people put their prayers affects me all of about none.
---
For 27m they need damn pockets to
---
I agree are quick prayers are super OP and I don't agree with it's implementation either. You're right on that. 
---
I personally disagree level order isn't neat, but that's ok I can see where you're coming from and that's valid. 
---
In terms of the inventory, every game ever allows you the freedom to do what you what. I don't think it's a great comparison honestly. 
---
On your last point, no. Like I've said, my opinion isn't based me being accustomed to the current layout. I said it's because of the 4 reasons I listed.
---
Why is this rip zerkers again? a 30 def account doesn't have access to void or barrows gloves which are pretty big items
---
There is several quests? Morytania quest line
---
What does the % mean I‚Äôm the titles?
---
The overheads are still all right next to each other, and for the most part, so are the boosting prayers.  
---
On my screen, the prayer box is an area that's 5cm by 6cm. Those prayers you're mentioning take up an area that's about half of that.  
---
Then there's the tick system, which means there's a limit to how quickly you can change prayers anyway. I think any benefit from this is being severely overblown, and is inconsequential to almost every player in the game because of how niche those benefits are. Yet it's being touted as some gamechanger that'll send shockwaves through many pieces of content.
---
im fine with that, but this poll has been decided if they fkn repoll it again im gonna lose my mind
---
So did no one use BIS gear back before the death update?
---
Boggles my mind how after six years they still can't get any type of poll questions that aren't YES/NO done correctly first try
---
You won't have to worry about the tome passing with 10%, that will come down if they want to get it in game lol.
---
please stop with t75 gear :( let us get some diversity
---
PKing
---
It's locked being a group boss and requiring high stats + gear. We still don't know how difficult it will be and what mechanics the boss will use.
---
What an absolute unit
---
what's the song in the background? (not the vocals) i know it but can't name it and it's bugging me
---
Obligatory "get good" comment.
---
uh, what do you mean? all the fremennik names given to players are random
---
Pvp accounts keep their defense stat at 1 to keep their overall combat level down
---
How does fully expressing an opinion make me an elitist? 
---
Actually, having 2 prayers next to each other makes clicking them significantly easier and faster. If this wasn't true, then players wouldn't want this update implemented. 
---
Using your logic then, if you already know where the prayers are, why do you want them to be rearranged?
---
Places you can teleport to for free. Theyre in every major city.
---
Also agree Book should be 5%, agree with mages book add-on. Armor should be higher def level (50 sounds good).  Orange orb NEEDS to be lowered, 55 is better. Being bombed for 90s from magic attacks offscreen is EXTREMELY bad for gameplay.
---
Maybe parts of the set will be used. For KQ slayer helm is probably BIS still but body + legs is open. As for Raids it may be used there but what Crush weapon will be used at raids? Scythe is best at TOB and TBOW/BP/lance probably at cox. Maybe very specifically at tekton? 
---
I can see the armor being used when speccing with DWH or general use of the mace.
---
The poll that added the buttons in your bank that let you left click an item to withdraw/deposit 1/5/10/X/All of them.

Even if every single Venezuelan dies from their poor life circumstances, what does it matter to you? Will you cry at night thinking about that? You just want to virtue signal with a moral high ground and pretend to be a righteous human being. It's a naive and idealistic child like behavior. Grow up and act your age if you're an adult. Self benefits outweigh the well being of strangers.
---
So like smurfing?
---
Tier stopped mattering with both Raids. Tbow and Rapier being T75 is absolutely laughable
---
ofc to keep you warm
---
It levels up so easily! Why did you wait so long to train it?
---
Since its same str bonus as bandos I was thinking you'd just bring it over bandos.
---
How bout we just remove the armour
---
You are trying to explain yourself but failing, but I appreciate the effort. While I'm quite decent at skilling I also like to pk. And while I avoid the pure scene since it's aids, and I avoid multi and teams cause they are aids - I don't encounter much in the way of client abuse - at least that's obvious. And again I probably don't see much of it since I don't take part in the toxic parts of pvp. Also you are the one acting like you know everything about pvp - since you seem to have had the need to tell me just how much I know about pvp.
---
Armor is probably a bit too good for 30 def given that it matches BiS str bonuses while giving a decent amount of accuracy.
---
It's important to ask if the Volatile Orb's 65 base damage is including the 15% damage boost from the staff or not. If it's not then the native max hit with just the staff is a 74/75, which is nuts.
---
**Since BH 2 is out, can we address the problem of emblem boosters?** 
---
Its frustrating to play the minigame with the majority of players stepping into wilderness to get target and then step out to afk til the target gets canceled.
---
Since crossing the wilderness ditch doesn't mean we can automatically attack players, one of the solutions would be after every target skip, players would be having to step further into wilderness to get target (lvl 2) and once attacked by target, they can still be attacked 5 sec before crossing the ditch fully (currently after crossing ditch first 2 tiles into wild are safe in BH worlds).
---
I did the two trips thing like the other person said
---
Wondering when it's time to train rc, if you'd take food or not
---
Fun fact: when I was younger and played, I didn‚Äôt know everyone used auto-Typers, so I would just manually type and constantly try and improve my speed when I was like 11 years old. When people ask me how I can type 120+ wpm with 100% accuracy, I tell them Runescape. I‚Äôd bet that there‚Äôs a lot of people with incredible typing speeds simply because of this part of Runescape.
---
Excuse me: scamman smart, fury good. :')
---
Going to be honest I forgot the RSOF exist lol
---
you keep plants adn seed  in inventroy
---
This was a war... not an accurate representation
---
I'll risk the ban at this point. Gimme a shout-out if you make one.
---
You're proving me right again. You arent reading.  I'm talking about what you said gambit said. It's wrong. Quote me where he says what you said.
---
Look man I'm not trying to embarrass you but not being able to admit you're wrong when there is literally no possible way for you to he right is some middle school type shit. You gotta grow up and just say "my bad" and admit it.
---
I mean if you were learning a language it'd be pretty encouraging to get told that your skills in that language were better than some native speakers of said language.
---
Design change needed
---
But there‚Äôs also not an entire venue and prize money to go along with it to be fair
---
They still exist though, they're a classic build even if they aren't amazing they're still prominent in non-clan PvP settings.
---
The more and more outlandish looks of the weapons just doesn't ring with me. The mace looks unrealistic and too top heavy, just like the staff with the basket below it.
---
The scythe, sangi staff and now these two.. A little too RS3 for me
---
Found a good safespot guide, thanks!
---
God, this is so stupid. I love it.
---
You remember a few weeks ago when they posted pics of the Inquisitor armor to Reddit and asked what the armor should be made for?
---
So many awesome cool set designs showed up and then they were all completely disregarded. Now some of those were definitely overpowered and I‚Äôm not necessarily saying that this idea is bad. Can definitely fill a role in some type of weird mid level def build. But it‚Äôs just saddening to see the community get asked for ideas, give such sick ideas, and then none of them be used.
---
&gt; I don't see why bandos would be devalued here, it would just have a competitor.
---
What do you think happens if bandos has a competitor that is cheaper?
---
My only concern, is that when a ton of new items come into the game, there should be an opportunity to add more gold sinks aswell. Add a golden sink by the Cooking guild, and make a new leaderboard to track who has donated the most money to it or something. Money needs removed from the game in other ways than just the Duel Arena tax. I would also really like to see a GE Tax personally. /u/JagexAcorn
---
Honestly, the mace looks bad imo. The first mace or flail you guys made looked far superior than this. Also why must everything be at max level 75?
---
The vast majority of mmos have movable ability icons though, so you can't use that excuse for an inventory but not abilities (and normally hotkeys, but hotkeys for prayers would be so OP)
---
yikes hmu when youre maxed
---
You mtf made me laugh
---
I think the mage book is a little overpowered especially for deep wildy singles teams
---
Rip rapier? What are you smoking lol
---
So this build uses 70 atk, 70 def, 77 prayer. does this mage and range level matter with this?
---
Been out of the game for quite a few years now

No point in Ironman mode if you can do everything with a main.

I wish dude :(. I was a scrub the one time I saw him in game. His badass was in Edgeville in his infernal cape back in the day when it meant something and I was still trying for mine in an ACB and shit. Daddy didn't wanna add me back in game &lt;/3. He just said hi and moved on.

They don't ban for trust trades gone wrong afaik.
---
OK cool if you want to pay money to learn that's fine with me. By definition that's not free. Also, it wouldn't be 0 time because you'd have to have an account with the requisite stats. Way to miss the point completely
---
What's ur username op

Outllier?

Imagine that lmao
---
Yeah I've noticed this, I think most people on Reddit are pretty predictable lol
---
Only 38% do not want option A.

Over half of those who voted will be fine with A.

Option A registered as many votes as all other options combined.

No people are just more and more dumb and easy to separate from their gp.

I've been a strictly mobile player on this account for the past 6 months or so.

I was temp banned once for macroing minor but by the time I logged back in my ban time was over so I didn't raise an issue.

Where is my customer support? Where is my email option or phone number? Why does it even matter when you wouldn't listen either way.

Abstaining from voting isn't voting. It's still not a majority, though, since those against add up to 39%.
---
:(
---
Well yeah. Those will all be 99 when maxed. But like you can have 99 range 60 atk and get str to 88 before gainong a cb and bcoming melee based. You need to watch a guide and also play around with an osrs combat calculator. 
---
You can get 88 str at 60 attack before deciding if you want to stay 60 atk snd grind out 99 str or get 75 atk to make the str grind faster. 
---
Btw a 60 70 def would be more for edge and hunting pures. An almost maxed 75 atk 75 def med would be better in deep nh and multi fights etc.
---
I do this whenever my friend lends me an item to be fair so it might just be that

There is always this kind of comment on these posts so I'd also bet on that lmao

Maybe. If this game got every QoL option, maybe a lot of subs would never come back and the game would be losing people fast. We just don't know. At least now can blame each other rather than Jagex

No

Nice

Ok parrot

I wish dabbing was an emote.

Just to quash this stupid post, yes I was "boosting" ROGUE kills with the help of a few friends, but since when was this bannable? The top page of rogue kills is all boosted and for years no action has been taken, so it's safe to assume this is allowed? Anyhow, this wouldn't be any different to killing looters, 1 itemers, or even green dragon bots for the rank.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Ihuvnmw.png](https://i.imgur.com/Ihuvnmw.png)
---
All these people have boosted, and not a single post was made against them, but no when FuriousFast7 does it, he has to be banned!
---
What happened to the 2 handed flail that mod west made? The mace is so ugly.
---
Obby Maulers rejoice.
---
Rip the Dwarven helmet if this passes more like.
---
For any future melee armour set that has both melee attack accuracy AND strength bonus, let it be an attachment to bandos armour. Otherwise, strip the strength bonus for the individual pieces and just get a % dmg boost to the full set.
---
I read a post above this one saying it would be like a 4% increase over sang staff except no healing, sounds pretty balanced to me and makes normal spells way more viable in pvm.
---
This is how redwood a big is

Also dude my first paragraph in my firat comment was for the plugin change and a rebut to your comment.

We learnt muscle memory for Mystic might and egale eye for years and now we have new prayers, that is more than enough reason to add a reorder feature.
---
I never rearranged my prayers so I wouldn't know, I just know others do and for them the default arrangement is no longer natural.  Luckily someone else has answered your question more usefully.
---
Why is always everything t75? Why cant it be t80 or higher.

Unlocking litterally everything ingame at only 75 att/magic/ranged is so boring and stale.

Can somebody elaborate about the impling posts for a player who doesn‚Äôt play twisted?

I can't find a logical way to explain this, even a Jmod was not impressed lol.
---
The rewards are all too strong. I'm not against power creep, but it has to be slow. These are all absurdly strong. 
---
The mace is better than a bludgeon... AND it's one handed. Can we get more creative than adding 4t melee weapons in different styles? Rapier, Saeldor, now this. Rapier was meant to be a cool unique reward, the "BiS" 4t melee weapon that dethroned the whip. It's not really a big deal honestly, the rapier is already basically completely dead content with lance in the game, I'm just sad that it's getting blurred out even more. Seems like every big update has to offer another rapier alternative. Additionally, this would dethrone scythe as the BiS cerberus item, wouldn't require as big of a DPS loss while swapping to spectral, AND doesn't require charging.
---
The Harmonised Orb staff adds *six* max hits over sang staff when using tome + fire surge (in current max gear). That's over an 11% DPS increase at zulrah for instance.
---
The volatile staff doesn't really do anything in PvM (I guess you could spec kraken out or something) but PKers might care. The special would max *86* (assuming it doesn't scale with magic level and the 15% damage bonus from the staff itself doesn't apply). If the 15% bonus applies then it maxes *96*. Still not as high as a dark bow spec, but it's 5t so you can follow up with something.
---
The tome is absolutely absurd, arcane will be literally dead content. There's not a place in the game you'd choose arcane over this crazy ass tome. Should be +2%, 4% at the ABSOLUTE maximum, that would still make arcane dead content but at least it would be slower power creep.
---
I don't really see any reason to use the new armour other than low defence builds + fashion, maybe if it had some high melee accuracy bonuses it would be useful (although in that case, it shouldn't be 30 def to use).
---
#Suggestioins
---
Change the mace to 81 str bonus instead of 89, that way it's still +4 strength bonus over bludgeon with an avernic rather than +12 (lol) and beats zammy hasta.
---
Make the harmonised orb staff have 10% magic strength bonus instead of 15%. It would still be the best DPS with fire surge, but you'd have to manual cast sometimes to not lose ticks while moving around and you'd lose the healing effect.
---
No comment on the volatile staff.
---
Drop the tome down to 2% magic strength bonus and lower the accuracy (maybe remove the magic accuracy completely).
---
Give the armour some hefty melee accuracy bonuses and it'll be in a nice spot where it's reasonable to take it over bandos. Also up the defence requirements.

**Supplement comment:**
---
I tried to run a few max hit calcs to see if the Harmonised Orb is really that broken as I first thought, tell me if I did something wrong below.
---
Max hit with sang staff is 35 with imbued heart, and fire surge + tome of fire is 36. Current max magic dmg bonus is +38% which won't change for 4-tick fire spells since the Staff of Nightmare also has 15% dmg bonus. So 4-tick fire surges can hit 49s (36 * 1.38), quite strong indeed (note the tome of fire dmg boost is applied first). 
---
Max dmg bonus with sang staff is currently +23%, or 33% with the proposed Siren's Tomb. However from feedback I've seen it will likely be reduced to 2% or 5% dmg boost, so let's say +28% is the end result. That gives a max hit of 44 (35 * 1.28). Should add that sang staff heals ~8.33% of damage dealt, has +9 more magic attack (+26 in total if including the Siren's Tomb vs. tome of fire) and is slightly more expensive to cast than fire surge + tome of fire. So yea, even if the max hit is quite high for fire surge, it's not as accurate as the sang staff where you can also freely choose your off-hand.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
That said, my reaction was also directed to PvP, where tridents and sang staves can't be used at all. That's a big difference. The best single-target dps spell is already 5-tick fire surge, so IMO the ability to cast 1 tick faster without any downsides (swap TSotD or Kodai with Staff of Nightmare as your +1 item) is a big buff to magic. Even with occult, staff &amp; tome of fire, you can hit up to 45 damage every 4 ticks with Magic as your only high stat, meaning around a cb lvl of 70.
---
**TL;DR** I think 4-tick fire surge is fine in PvM, I'm more worried about PvP where tridents and sang staff can't be used anyway.
---
To make that change you‚Äôd essentially have to make Jagex make fighting back as brain dead as possible by complicating the mechanics of fighting multiple people while unskulled. And this would also complicate things for people who do fight multiple people at once in single way, something I have found myself doing far more times than you‚Äôd expect. 
---
As someone who pks and anti pks and also just PVMs/skills and runs away, I‚Äôve accidentally skulled and been in situations where people have tried to skull trick me unsuccessfully. Besides it being a rare occurrence, and the fact that it is difficult to fall for most skull tricks if you‚Äôre paying attention or not making silly mistakes, skulling by accident is not without countermeasures already put in place by Jagex which is why I am against this. 
---
I‚Äôd also like to point out that skull tricking isn‚Äôt the same as scamming just because of the sheer mental manipulation involved in scamming. Skull tricking is just that - trickery - which really preys on new players or people not paying attention. All of the times people have attempted to skull trick me it has been easy to escape or simply just die without being skulled. And all of the times I‚Äôve skulled by accident have to do with misclicks and not paying attention. Skull trickers hope that you will make a mistake. Meanwhile, scamming is usually a well planned scenario that involves manipulating the target. Some of the elements are the same but the idea is to manipulate the target into thinking they‚Äôre not making a mistake or doing the wrong thing.
---
RS3 players can use/join OSRS CCs?
---
It won't affect icon size or speed, and if anything it will slow down how fast you switch prayers initially as you get used to the setup.  
---
Also, I've been playing since 06, so go fuck yourself with that shit.
---
The prophecy is foretold... Durial is back boys

Thematically I can see where they were going with the item, but wow is the devaluation of arcane spirit shield a huge oversight.
---
Really. All my comments were genuine and it took me a while to understand this dude thought what i said was a direct quote of a jmod. I did honestly try my best to explain everything to him. Have a read of the chain and tell me what you think?
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they can. I think the friend chat in RS3 acts as the OSRS's clanchat system.
---
Is posted in the /r/2007scape chat?
---
Because the rewards have to actually be good if you are adding in an end game boss. Like those boots you mentioned would useless, because you can just bring staminas. Also skilling upgrades from end game PvM content doesn't seem right either.
---
You could have a team bigger than their log in and tag all the bolt raggers and then work the dude in max down or bait him into multi where you have a clan waiting. Point being if a random in a 3m set could evem chsnce him he wouldnt be in that risk, so you couldnt fight him. The max guy is risking it by being in the wild. Doors and caves give easy boxes to your alt, you can also dip multi and back single to box your alt/friend. Im aussie dont talk about ping with me. 
---
Just so you know i do get angry when i loose sets like that but at the same time i understand it. You can also 1v1 below 30 or edge. Pretty sure pvp worlds still have a massive pj timer so you could NH deep on those solo. 
---
As for combatting single clans jagex have already made many changes. Most recent being the 10 or 15 second timer between speccing someone after someone else has speced them. You cant spear someone after theyve been speared either. I think some more smaller changes to make deep single clan piling harder but nothing like a 10 second pj timer.
---
How would you do crafting?
---
*sigh* I've said it so many times. 
---
The only thing stab is good against is dragons which the DHL already has covered. The Mace will be BiS in a style that's actually useful. It has +1 more accuracy, +2 more prayer, and armor that makes it incredibly strong. 
---
It can train strength, it can be used in *every* place the Rapier is used at, and will be BiS for Cerberus for instance. Not to mention it'll pair incredibly well with the DWH when wearing the armor.
---
Sure the Rapier will still be used, but not by max mains.
---
Zae-uh
---
I had an idea for something similar but as a main hand weapon. Gorgons head or something like that but the connected content design is dead. It‚Äôs certainly something I‚Äôd be up for making in the future.
---
As for this update, Mod Ry made the weapons while I made the armours but we‚Äôre not in a position to start from scratch with these unfortunately :/
---
Yeah I agree, I do have 87 construction and all maxed out stuff in the house but I do spend a lot on house tablets so that‚Äôs why I was leaning towards construction
---
Would think that as well, might be a setup for views then
---
I was thinking maybe amethyst bolts
---
Can you post your stats? It‚Äôs hard to help you without knowing what you can do. As a blanket statement, I‚Äôd say slayer is a good way to make money. If you need money to buy a bond before the two weeks is up, that‚Äôs probably your best way. Another easy way that I‚Äôve used is hunting red chinchompas. You can get to 63 hunter in a day and then spend a day or two hunting red chins.
---
Yes but how many of the people who voted skip, only voted skip because they were happy with ALL the proposed redesigns, and didn't mind. Or they couldn't make up their mind but did want it to be changed. You cannot determine the outcome of a poll from results that poll different things.
---
No, because they are 2 different updates. They said that the boss would come first, and the quest would be after.
---
In 2019...
---
What a P0rnstar
---
Well they also made a lot more worlds so areas wouldn't be a competition for things such as bossing or tasks.  Also the game is much less populated in general because its a grinding intensive game with little actual mechanics so people are opting for more rewarding games.  Also Twisted league is a thing rn so less people playing on normal worlds from that also.
---
I know I probably wouldn't use it as much, but I voted against moveable prayers because I know others would really benefit from it being in the game.
---
Maybe I'm dumb, but how is it not as good as the rapier? It's the same stats as rapier but with +1 accuracy.
---
I think 99 construction is the pest because crafting cape only for fast banking, but with max house you can do multiple things and you can teleport to the Grand exchange from your house and bank really fast.
---
You‚Äôre the straight definition of a fucking NEET. Get a job, get used to what sunlight feels and stop prioritizing a game over your real life. You sir are a fucking loser
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd definitely do construction if you already have a good house. Having unlimited house teleports is more useful than unlimited crafting guild teleports
---
Where in this picture did you get the idea he was RWTing...?
---
Could you imagine being the guy paying $4,000 doing it to 1,000 viewers? I don‚Äôt think this is real.
---
I've never in my life thought hm yes, I wish I could move the prayers. They're find, we don't need rs3 menu adjustment in osrs
---
You absolutely can. 33% voted on A. You keep throwing around that word majority like it's  relevant but 75% is the magic number.
---
Could this fee be around 1 m ?
---
I don‚Äôt think the guy paying $4,000 would risk having a thousand viewers see him RWT and risk losing his money.
---
I remember someone trying to get me with that. I was skeptical though, so I dropped my tinderbox instead. It was still no small loss though. I had kept that tinderbox with me since Tutorial Island and was very attached to it.
---
Nope
---
You'd 100% get muted for talking about irl stuff with your friend in-game.
---
ohh yeah for zerker accs because of the helm...i can see that. dont know much about special acc builds. Id also be fine with lowering the helm by 1 str to make it equal...is it somthing that most pkers wouldnt want or would most not care about a mew bis?
---
83-87 con be best imo
---
Please stop giving him free publicity lol
---
&gt;password

You just did it for him
---
Already have 87 con

Void melee generally sucks. Basically, increasing strength bonuses is the most important way to boost dps, especially against crabs which have almost no defense. Void ranged gives damage boost, while regular ranged armor does not. However, melee armor does give a ton of strength boosts. Instead of void melee, you should use nezzy helm, fighter torso, obsidian legs and barrows gloves. If you don't have all of those, you should really go get them asap, but in the meantime whatever the next best replacement is would still be a lot better than void melee. Also ammonite crabs (fossil island) are the best crabs.
---
Why?
---
Oh shoot, Sorry dude!
---
Yeah but then the reward is also the single most overpowered thing in the game.
---
If you can't make the GP, then you shouldn't get to use the pool.
---
Just get the drop 4head.
---
Yeah correct. 13 + 7.4 + 18.6 + 28.1 is greater than 75. Is is possible that all of the skip question voters would have voted for a redesign, but were undecided which.
---
However, you can never truly know until you poll it.
---
Either poll: Should the dragonstone armour be changed to one of the proposed redesigns or remain the same?
---
A - Remain
---
B - Proposed redesigns
---
And then have another poll where it is first past the post to decide which of the redesigns to implement.
---
Or, a ranked voting system for multi choice.
---
Currently, first past the post does not work for split vote multiple choice.
---
You do know that for like half the world right now the sun isn't showing up for much of the day as we are getting close to winter.
---
Blade and rapier are tiny DPS upgrades over whip. This is much bigger than those at least.
---
And in both cases, making it easier brings more competition to the table. And that‚Äôs the reality the ‚Äúexperienced players‚Äù face. Why worry about being mechanically skilled in the game, when you can superimpose a ‚Äúskill gap‚Äù in *where you click on your screen*?
---
It‚Äôs laughable honestly. It‚Äôs why RuneScape PvP is considered such a joke.

shoot sorry i didnt see that. I agree with goldnblade. Unlimited house tellies. More useful than a quick bank imo.

Not sure how you did your math but. 13 + 7.4 + 18.6 + 28.1 = 67.1
---
Lvl 88 fishing and am starting to believe this pet is a myth.
---
You do realize that the playerbase is growing, right? There was a drop off over the past year because of the giant spoke from mobile, but the game is the biggest it's ever been barring that spike.
---
Also why do you even post here if you hate the game so much
---
0 of the best pkers play without F-keys, and probably near 0 of the best pvmers. Could you mention any of these "best players" that you know for a fact?
---
Idiot: Hi Yes I would like one OP boss that shits out BIS please!
---
Jagex: say no more
---
People are so afraid of power creep in osrs.  That's why bandos has been bis melee armor for over 5+ years.  GWD hasn't been meta content since raids 1 released for high-level pvmers outside of the pet.
---
Congratz dude! You are worth easily 500x more than me lol

Shopscape is bad, but shopscape + massively farmed is even worse, obviously.

Some people say that auto weed isn't worth the time. But the sanity saved from not having to worry about weeds growing back was well worth the time at Tithe farm.

You might want to re-read the title.
---
&gt; step 3: place promotional content immediately after interest has been peaked
---
It's not like they had this planned from the beginning, I can almost guarantee this was a recent development for all popular OSRS content creators as I see it more in videos by B0aty, Pugger and (I'm pretty sure) A Friend lately. I think companies have started to think it's better to just pay a creator directly and advertise in the middle of a video (it's not better) rather than pay YT to queue up the ad as normal.
---
As a content creator how would you possibly turn down a deal that guarantees some extra $$ per video, especially with how sporadic YT payouts have been in the past few years?

---
i'd prefer one well thought out bit of content than the mess with zeah where they make something square and the community has to redesign it for them
---
you're right my reddit account is my only form of human interaction please help
---
Nah dawg your items will stay there for an hour regardless. Did you hop worlds? Or go to the wrong place
---
Max Nexus is 2.8m for materials, and 9m in runes. One of the Most expensive teleport is catherby tele, which costs 1070 gp. 
---
If you teleported to catherby 10,000 times you would get your moneys worth.
---
once again, in your opinion. but currently 40m is a third of my bank and i‚Äôm sure it is for most people too
---
Defenders give a higher stab/slash bonus than crush bonus.
---
Imagine thinking of yourself as the end all be all in the world
---
I know it'll never happen, but I'd legit play a VR mode where you view the world from god's perspective. Like having the game playing on the floor in VR except with the 3D graphics.
---
I don't know if I agree.

Corrupted gauntlet needs higher levels than Zulrah/Vorkath. But gauntlet requires no gear.

how?

Because the tome would be like 1b+ so the arcane would now fill in a role of an in-between item that is an upgrade from 6m mages book but not a 1b BIS

---
Not sure why he said crafting for pvm.
---
Construction is better than craft for nearly everything except a very few methods like runecrafting.
---
I got 99con and craft on my med level thinking I'd use crafting cape perk and I legit use it for almost nothing. It's like 1 second longer to poh tele -&gt; jewelry box to edge/cw
---
Especially in pvm a poh gives you all your pvm teles, your pool for recharge etc. There's no way id use crafting cape for pvm.
---
Because end game PvM has become too safe.
---
Having more fun than *all of us*
---
I heard it was changed to be considered a skilling pet task-wise though, is that wrong?
---
The tome is one of the best proposed items and it looks very cool IMO. It is too strong in its current state though, making the arcane and spectral shield almost useless. My suggestions:
---
* Completely remove the attack and def bonuses of the book with just 5% or 10% magic strength bonus. (Magic is still the lowest DPS in PVM'ing so a damage boost is acceptable)
---
* Make it match the stats of the mages book (+15 attack and +15 magic defence) and give it a small magic strength bonus (2% or 5%).
---
It also depends on the drop rate and the average time to achieve the drops. If the drop rate is 1/4k (like elysian spirit shield, very rare) then a higher damage bonus would be more acceptable. If it's just a 1/128 drop, then a 10% damage boost seems OP.
---
I really hate how people in this community try to spin it as the scammer 'doing them a favor' by 'teaching them a lesson'. The fact of the matter is that scamming is an entirely human made problem and only exists by virtue of humans practicing it; they are 'teaching a lesson' for a problem that only exists because they created it.
---
I'm not saying people shouldn't be wary of scammers because they shouldn't exist, merely saying their actions shouldn't be spun in any good light and the victims shouldn't be blamed. Blaming the victim is like being angry that someone never heard of a musician you like or a show you watch, or because they dont know a 'commonplace' term/fact that you grew up with because they live somewhere else.
---
You sound like a psychopath.

This is a scam to get you to give items/gp to the guy who just got scammed.
---
Yes I am a cynic in real life as well because of runescape.
---
What the fuck did I just watch?
---
I got 99 con and craft on my med level. I almost never use crafting. With a properly setup POH (check my post history and I have a max efficiency house setup) the only thing I'd use crafting for over construction cape is runecrafting lavas tbh.
---
I'd prefer a few well thought of pieces of content. I would love for there to be multiple dev teams all working on seaperate content.
---
How does skull tricking not involve manipulating the target into thinking they‚Äôre doing the right thing, ie attacking back? 1 dude log in under you at Callisto safespot, his un skulled friend hops in and attacks his friend under you and gets a skull so you think you‚Äôre good to attack back but get a skull yourself. 
---
Sure it‚Äôs easy to see a skull trick happening sometimes, but when you‚Äôre in the moment just trying to survive you‚Äôre focused on that and not wether some dude is under you or what ever. 
---
Also my bank is only 75m, if I get skull tricked for my blowpipe, slayer helm and archers ring (assuming I protect anguish) that‚Äôs still a decent chunk of my bank, and could be worse for lower level players if that is 75% of their bank.

Love it so far. My one complaint is the appearance of the new mace, in the hand it kind of looks like a bouquet lol. I was expecting a flail, 1H or otherwise.

Any chance of a Lovakengj favor rework or rebalance? Twisted League shows how miserable it is to get the favor compared to any of the other houses. Sulfur mining is unbearable and armor crafting has higher requirements than any house for a fraction of the rewards.

Am I wrong in thinking that people recently started getting punished for luring? I swear I saw that somewhere.
---
Get armadyl book tho
---
Shura will charge a fee to reclaim any items when you die inside the Nightmare boss fight. Could this fee be higher than for example the 100 k at vorkath?
---
I'm a friendy man, I play in a clan so they got a nice split.
---
The designs of the movies were actually pretty good. Even after many years, I still think most of the armor and characters look pretty dope. However, it's still not enough for me to forgive how much Peter Jackson butchered the story
---
I think it's a symptom of a more general problem. Every new mob that gets added to the game is spawning more and more resources without a way for those resources to get taken out of the game. *Most* items in the game are considered alchable. 
---
As for why that's a problem specifically, there's a number of reasons. Deflation disincentivizes trading. People are unlikely to buy an item which is currently crashing because they'll lose money on the deal. That drops the demand, which then drops the price further, causing a deflationary spiral. A further effect of that is dicincentivizing things like bossing over time. The tool shard and the onyx drop being devalued is making zalcano less and less profitable to do compared to things like Vorkath and Zulrah which are propped up by alchable and consumable prices.
---
I've always wished we got the pelican pet instead of a heron.
---
Jagex mentioned wanting to incorporate pvp, so to avoid clan domination, I would like an ironman only mode like twisted league with relics and all that, but your final point total is a currency you can spend in a pk shop to get good pking gear, prayer unlocks, and better/more consumables for each round of a final pvp tournament/battle.
---
As for variations on the current mode, a uim style mode would result in some crazy strategies, and to make it more fun, you could have relics that mitigate the inventory issues you will have (like final relic being a choice between bank access/unlimited stacking of any item/insane drop rate boost).
---
But if a poll ran which said:  
---
Should Dragonstone Armour be changed?   
---
It would've only gotten 54%, based on the numbers above. This is way below the 75% threshold for a poll to pass.
---
Because it‚Äôs a book.
---
It won‚Äôt devalue the arcane as much as you think at all. The new tome has negative prayer and only magic stats, while the arcane has prayer bonus and better defences. 
---
However if it does devalue it, that‚Äôs what all new content does, if you didn‚Äôt want stuff being devalued we wouldn‚Äôt have anything past bronze armour..
---
Jesus christ you killed him
---
It depends on what you want to do. I went endless endurance, harvester, artisan, konar, and I'm gonna do wisdom. Pretty satisfied with my choices, except I'm 50/50 on harvester. Sometimes I regret it cuz choosing your slayer tasks sounds nice and you don't always want your inventory to fill so quickly, but it makes herblore and farming easy. Clue hunter sounds fun, but it probably gets old constantly doing the same clues. I'm mostly skilling with some slayer. There're a lot of points in skilling.
---
The price of chaos runes is tied to onyx. They go hand in hand
---
Customer support is very different from the team dealing with bans
---
So the armor seems to have a lot of people split. Firstly, it‚Äôs not better than Bandos. The extra crush isn‚Äôt really worth giving up the defensive bonuses, especially when you‚Äôre doing a slayer task. I really don‚Äôt see this armor being used much if implemented as is. For most crush applications, you‚Äôre probably just gunna use a full Justicar set or Bandos for the defensive bonuses. Therefore, I have a solution to help this armor fill a niche without making it overall BiS offensive gear:
---
A set bonus of +10% melee strength.
---
This allows the armor to fill the fairly rare niche of off-task, fully-offensive melee bossing armor while making it worse overall for stuff like Slayer where you can‚Äôt utilize the full set. The armor would still get some use, and would be the final melee niche needed - this for full offense, Bandos for a more balanced style, and Justicar for full defense. Bandos will still by far be BiS at most things, but just as Justicar picks up the slack at places where high defense is priority, places where ‚Äúglass cannon‚Äù styles work would favor this new set. Maybe the defensive stats can be lowered a bit more to balance it out, making the niche use even clearer.
---

They weren't meant to be permanent but things change and now it's a permanent death mechanic. Get over it or go play something else. I think you're the only person who wants to lose a fuckton of gear for dying and honestly that would make the game super shitty.

That's not a scam that's a revolution
---
Did he talk to the NPC or did he just go suicide?
---
Yeah for sure, I'm just saying from a personal perspective I'm assuming those people with huge leads are just account sharing, not that Jagex should take action against them just because it's suspicious.
---
Ya I have no idea why they went with 1H mace when people  have been begging for the 2H mace

They have a lot of free time...

I feel like if you get scammed it's your own fault, I've been scammed for 500m before, we learn from it and stop trusting people, I guess the community becomes shit with people not trusting each other but at least its safer

All tier 70+ should've been degradable from the get go.  Gwd gear should have been rebalance to accomodate. But it wasn't and now it's so hard to make any gear degradable without making it ridiculous.

---
Nah that old armor looks sick af, like a conquerer from for Honor or something
---
It‚Äôs really to stop people from selling accounts and will only really happen if your account is like created in Venezuela or something
---
BIS items should be very niche. Then you can have a lot of BIS that are BIS for specific activities and not for the rest of the game. That‚Äôll slow down power creep
---
Check my profile same thing happened to me :D
---
Yes I think making it an arcane addon would be the way to go when it has stats like that. This would also open up the way for addons for the other spirit shields and giving them more use other then being niche for 1 task.
---
You could also use both mage book &amp; arcane for this upgrade if they really want to make a book out of it.
---

---
Have you thought about incorporating things like living trees by draynor in to boss fights area as trade offs to wall hugging or safe spots?
---
I like the tear that you put into the cloth, suits it very well. Also the change to the slits in the facemask.
---
Looks pretty good, maybe also make the spikes on the helmet slightly taller, to throw in some Sauron inspiration as well.
---
This does well to seperate it from Justiciar a bit more.
---
How many people PK in bcp + tassets + neitiznot faceguard? These items are cheaper than what the Inquisitor's parts will be.
---
No the difference between using a spectral and no spectral is roughly 1-10 prayer points a kill. Less than a single dose of prayer potion. The ghosts only subtract prayer points that you actually have when they hit you so as long as you float just over 60 prayer you can't lose the whole 90 (45 with spectral). Its merely convenience
---
Back to full health, prayer, spec, no status effects, right in the place with a ton of teleports to all around the game.
---
e.g., EVE Online
---
some of the shit people to do each other in that game *and then get away with* is ruthless
---
I‚Äôm looking for a clan and discord server too, would be nice to play with others

Yeah i might focus on skilling with that auto banking thing, should be easy points
---
Have you seen the items you need for elite and master tier clues?
---
We need variety, not powercreep. The staffs look promising after maybe some damage tweaks but tome in current stage heavily powercreeps over arcane.
---

---
Agreed, looks exactly like a revoked Justiciar just recoloured would be nice to see a slight different helm like in your design or something
---
And about 375m in regular drops but ok
---
It‚Äôs like the Siren quest from RS3 in Rimmington, but without shoehorning in a new boss. Looks nice.
---
Agreed on everything, but just to be pedantic, wasn't addy already bis on launch, meaning it would've have actually "devalued" bronze?
---
We shouldn't cater to a game mode, if you choose to sign up for Ironman mode then you do it because it's a "harder" mode, making it easier is just dumb.
---
nah dude just do shit raids with shit times and u'll see bows meanwhile i consistently do sub 18 minute scaled raids and get fuck all to show for it cba
---
I'd rather not have any stackable clues in the main game so that it's always a choice to grind them out specifically. Stackable clues just mean you'll have plenty of them to do by just passively playing the game.
---
If I had to compromise though, I'd be fine with a 2-4 limit so people can get a couple from a single slayer task, and letting elite clues pile up while raiding in a team.
---
Player Killing. People make "pure accounts" as to maximize damage at low level, since defense doesnt affect damage dealt they leave it at 1.
---
Looks more suited towards RS3 imo

I used the whip purely cause I heard the sound it made when my brother was using his, I didn‚Äôt even care that it was good. And when I got my first whip I had my volume turned up to the max for days

---
Great content.

Never heard of the anguish? Better for damage bonus then fury?
---
Uhh... how high were you guys when you suggested these stats for the tome?
---
"its too big to be 1h" ok then put it behind 99 str
---
Keep the armour at 30-40 defense. There should be an option for strength bonus armour that gives moderate defence.
---
100%
---
I'm 44 iron drags dry on limbs: started at 60 mage, I'm now 75 and my 2m cash stack is gone. I couldn't imagine not taking accumulator *or* unnatural selection. If you took endurance and end up on a metal drag task without a rcb or hasta, good luck.
---
That'd be a good point if we weren't discussing an end-game content mage offhand that's going to replace the Arcane. Did you even read why I made my comment originally? 
---
The spectral *barely* has a use and is 60mil which means that the Arcane must be used a lot to maintain its 140mil price. But for both shields max people like me absolutely buy them. This new mage tome will be worth even more than the arcane considering that magic strength is actually useful.
---
I feel like you lost the context of why we're talking. We're talking about max level players with tons of money and what they view as necessary. If the arcane is more valuable than the spectral then this tome will be far more valuable than even the arcane.
---
Bro your league comparisons are fuckin wack its an action MOBA and OSRS is a point and click idle game with some additional elements
---
&gt;If in leauge of legends they made every skill 10% larger so lower level players had an easier time playing the game and landing combos, high level players would have a SERIOUS gripe about it.

That was a shit idea i haven't trained mining in like 2 months
---
The entire experience to get 256 kills was a nightmare. The boss sucks ass.

Get full obsidian and sit at nmz till about 70/90/70 melee stats then you can start doing a lot of end game content. Go back to nmz afk when you aren't actively playing to finish off those 99's, str first then att.
---
While you are actively playing you can work on quests and gear unlocks like fighter torso, fire cape, barrows gloves and void
---
Can you detail how the boss is killed and looted? Is it like Zalcano whereby people receive drops based on their contribution? So Irons will receive drops in a group?
---
Well it will now be more niche armor. Which isn't a bad thing considering how cheap it is and that it's a shop item. This new armor will also only work with crush weapons.
---
Yea it is kind of unfortunate that you get the last relic so quickly. It takes like 2 weeks of casual play or a few days going hard.

Sure in theory if 93% of all people who didn't vote for A would would vote for the secondary choice, then maybe B could pass.  But I think we both know that's extremely unlikely and if there was a ranked choice voting, A would almost certainly win.
---
bro you're playing a game with elves dwarves and orks in it simmer down. if we're doing a guy who already has a dark crown of thorns and giant mace, you might as well go the full way and also include the flame sword.
---
also legit how many games have flame swords
---
Why did you post this shit twice. Nice spam
---
I used rune claws because dragon claws were 114m or something and the rune ones had a spec
---
I do pk with claws, but do pretty alright with gmaul/dds. Also, rigour with void, d knives and heavy ballista is fantastic in that bracket with that build.
---
I'd argue most of those things aren't that great.  The inferno thing is pretty cool but not game-changing and while it will be pretty good for slayer it will be balanced by its price tag.
---
because i made some changes that i thought would change people's opinions on it with this edit, and it didn't look like the first post was going anywhere at the time.
---

---
As much as everyone wants this it has turned out to be very challenging if not impossible. The new crystal armor or justiciar armor are both great examples of this. Great idea but, still very little use outside the one or two places where its actually good. These kinda items become dead content very quickly which is very sad
---
I just dont like it because its not the game I grew up with. I dont even have hotkeys set, I have to manually click on the prayer tab and then click on the prayer icon to activate it. Makes attempting Jad an actual challenge instead of just pressing a key on the keyboard and moving your mouse slightly or something.

Not to bash on F2p only community and what not because I want people to play how they want. But that's kind of an extremely niche and "limited" account choice that I don't think endgame content should be made for.
---
Like look I'll grind out 600 beginners same I did 500 easy and 400 medium and 300 hard, and currently working on 200 elite and 100 master.
---
But it's the least enticing of the bunch. Very few uniques. Absolute garbage average clue value. Boring and limited amount of steps due to the F2p limitation. And they can't give master clues. So I look to earn nothing except clearing a completionist step and ungreying an emote which is now tied to a large amount of the easiest content in an area of the game
---
Endurance - Zeah is huge, and I knew it would be a pain getting around until I got my talisman. 
---
Unnatural Selection - if there's one thing that going for a RCB has reinforced, it's that metal dragons are ass, and getting stuck with them as a task early is likely the next week of your life. Seriously, pick accumulator in tier 1 or this one - save your sanity. 
---
Artisan - construction is super important for the cape, and smithing/herb are a pain in the ass to level as an IM. I don't mind afking gathering, especially when the xp is so fast. 
---
Treasure Seeker - the single best method of getting gear and cash quickly. Hards take a few minutes to complete, stack up fast, and throw rune items at you. It's also the only method for some bis gear like blessed d'hide.
---
I would rather they make it a crush version equivalent of the tentacle and keep it non degradable. IMO, it makes sense for the tent to degrade considering that it comes from Kraken, which is probably the easiest boss in the game.
---
I want prayer reordering. 
---
But it does reduce the skill gap. For an analogy lets say ur the best archer irl. U hit the bullseye 100% of the time.  A new scope comes out that lets you literally point and shoot. Well now everyone can hit a bullseye 100% of the time. Ur skill is now irrelevant. 
---
But prayer reordering is so so tiny. And 99.9% of people are just going to put aug/rig on eagle eye and mystic might so its consistent across accounts. 
---
Now spell resizing is pretty much analogous to the scoped bow. 1 tick barraging is end game pvp skills and with it being huge as fuck you just make it mid game pvp skills. The lower the pvp ceiling, the more boring it becomes and the less people who do it. No one is not pvping because of the spellbook size because even beginning those types of switches is reserved for experienced pvpers, not newbs.
---
I voted yes because firstly I don't see any harm from coming with it, while there being some good. Also I am doing Inferno and I thought it would be cool to have prayers over ice/blood barrage icons for fast(er) actions. I also think it's cool to have customization in mmorpgs since they often have extremely high play times compared to other games.

Yeah, they were the good ol days when we were all young i was 9 when i started runescape back on windows 98

I wasted 7 hours today trying to get something as stupid as a lockpick. I don't mind the grind but this is ridiculous. Plenty of other accommodations have been made on Zeah the past year to facilitate the Twisted League, this is not really different.

AGS doesn't freeze you. It should max slightly lower than ZGS, since it's ranged as opposed to melee.

"prayer switching literally isn't even close to anything league asks of you"
---
"OH YEAH NOTHINS HARD IN THIS GAME HUH? YEAH PUSSY?"
---
Especially when meta spells and prayers like vengeance and piety are already in the same click space as the spec bar. Like, it‚Äôs already as easy as it‚Äôs gonna get lmao.
---
Pssst. It‚Äôs not Twisted League making you feel that way. It‚Äôs Ironman mode
---
As someone that plays mobas and has played at a competitive level in the past, your argument makes no fucking sense in the slightest.
---
First off, people who are good at PvP and PvM content are not marginally better because of their ability to click spellbook icons or prayer icons because they're placed in areas that you can't change. It's just getting used to placement and it's not even a big deal. Re-ordering them is literally just a convenience factor that would make remembering where they are a bit easier and just easier to manage. Instead of having several rows of completely useless prayers and spells clogging up the window that you use.
---
Secondly, your absolute mental gymnastics goalpost shift to the god damn Amazon Rainforest with "making skillshots and AoEs in mobas bigger would make it easier for less experienced players to be good". This has NOTHING to do with the argument presented.
---
The ability to re-order prayers (and spellbook icons) is **entirely to do** with the UI being customizeable or being able to move around things so you can more easily activate them. MOBAs actually let you do this because it's about creating a comfortable experience for the player.
---
For example, you can customize keybinds in any way you see fit so you can activate your abilities on whatever keys you wish. You can use shortcut commands in order to send out messages or pings. Your items in your item window can be re-ordered so you can click them in the places you want to click them in. You can assign keybinds to items so that you can immediately use them when you want to on the keys you want to. You can assign keybinds to categories and items **in the entire fucking shop** so that you can quickly buy what you need to and reduce the time you spend not in the field and lanes contributing to the team.
---
Runescape doesn't let you do this. There's no customization in this respect. You are forced to deal with default placement of prayers and spells and are forced to adjust to where they are and get used to it. Allowing the player to shift them around and customize them to their leisure is a *good* thing because it benefits everyone and doesn't harm anyone.
---
You insult tay tay reee
---
you're a flail
---
Correct
---
the best quality of a pvp build in 2019 is hp first and foremost and as def levels = hp levels, you want to avoid any defence if possible to get the most hp.
---
trading 3 hp levels for 1 strength bonus is not worth in any scenario, not even if the 1 str bonus might push you to the next maxhit on last combat.
---
Voting yes for the emo/goth fashion-scape opportunities.

Oh and a toxic community can‚Äôt forget that one

Looks awesome! Happy for all of the content. My personal opinion is that the armor and all of the orbs on the staff are overtuned, but the rest are okay, provided that the Siren Tome actually becomes an attachment for the Mage Book instead (and if overtuned still, make it like a 5% or 7.5% damage boost instead).   
---
The Inquisitor armor also adds too much strength and defense (imo) for its def requirement, invalidating the whole reason for lower levels to get obsidian armor (which has higher requirements barring strength). With its stat requirements, you can keep the strength bonus the same, but the defense needs to be nerfed for sure, OR some kind of obsidian armor (e) or stat buff to obsidian armor needs to happen. Power creep of this scale -feels- unacceptable to me.  
---
Those are just concerns. They may actually be fine as-is, and might be the boost pkers need to compete with ranged in the wild. The aesthetics of everything looks amazing and very much matches the theme of OSRS. Love it, guys  
---
Questions for us Ironmemes:  
---
1) if they participate in a group boss fight such as this, will the loot be instanced? Or are they automatically ineligible for everything if they take part in this fight as intended?  
---
2) Will the Inquisitor Armor count as an armor set to store in the POH?
---
Same. I only have 2 99s o my main, but it's so much more satisfying to play twisted league.

Lol then 7 year old you would have loved the dragon mace XD
---
Prayer reordering is just another step to making this game something it wasn't back in 2007: easyscape. Like okay, I understand it's painful to move your mouse every damn time you want to click that specific prayer, but honestly I wouldn't have it any other way. These small things make osrs the kind of game it was made to be.
---
However, I think hotkeys is something we should rather have when it comes to prayers and mostly talking about overheads. There are hotkeys already but for some reason we can't have prayers hotkeyed. Keyboard is mostly unused even tho it would very much make sense to map prayers in your keyboard. The way I propose it is simple: player needs to open the tab (spellbook, prayers) and just simply click a key in your keyboard (say there's a certain area of the keyboard mapped for tab-hotkeys like for example numpad) respective to the place of the slot in the actual tab.

Are you by chance using runelite? Sounds like a problem I had a month or so ago. Disable the login plugin. Should fix it
---
Out of all things to read about and prepare for while reading about the twisted league, I gotta be honest, a lockpick was very low on the list.
---
&gt;The people who put time and thought into figuring out strategies like this should be rewarded.
---
Sort of, sure, but not to an extreme disadvantage to anyone that didn't start playing hardcore on day one. I think it's a little silly to pretty much lock people out of completing the diaries with this. Surely you can agree this is a bit on the extreme end... Make it accessible through high smithing, or thieving, or Queen of Thieves. I don't care if it's hard, but that's different from a grind where you can make 0 progress running around for HOURS on end.
---
Baxe hits higher but slower. Scim is a tick quicker but slightly lower hits.

are you being this dense on purpose? he‚Äôs obviously not saying they‚Äôre exactly the same. he‚Äôs saying that both take practice and skill and that there‚Äôs no reason to make it easier when people could just practice

&gt;there‚Äôs no reason to make it easier when people could just practice
---
"It's shit" isn't enough reason? Imagine if RS released today and we could actually make QoL changes without people hissing boomer shit -- there's never a reason to improve a game at all, just practice bro
---
I went for a pretty well-rounded set up as I like all aspects of the game.
---
*Tier 1:*
---
**Endless Endurance** \- Best one hands down. There's no option for Graceful and Agility training is painstaking even with XP multipliers.
---
*Tier 2:*
---
**Hardcore Harvester** \- I can see why people would take Unnatural Selection but it's just too niche of a relic for me. I got 99 farming without the contracts portion and the upside of choosing your tasks doesn't appeal to me over getting 3x my resources because I like skilling as well as slayer.
---
*Tier 3:*
---
**Gift of the Gatherer** \- Receiving  twice the amount of XP from my gathering skills outweighs the artisan skills for me. Normally artisan skills produce more XP than gathering skills (i.e. Cooking fish gives more XP than the catches.) Coupled with the previous rune, I'll already be receiving that XP with a little time investment and I'll have 3x the results to show for it. Pots, food, etc.
---
*Tier 4:*
---
**Konar's Blessing** \- Unless you're going for 200m Firemaking, Dhin's is trash. Treasure Seeker is good, but I feel like it's more personal preference. After you get your BiS from clues, the only real perk is the alchables you receive and money only gets you so far on Twisted Leagues. However, depending on RNG, Treasure seeker may be the better choice.
---
Tier 5:
---
**Xeric's Wisdom** \- What's better than a 20x XP drop? Defense is mediocre and IMO not worth it over the other two options. Machine Gun Relic seems like it could be fun, but that pertains to a such a small portion of skills. With the 2x XP on all skills, the rune amplifies the other rune choices as well.
---
I'm having a great time with Twisted Leagues so far and it's nice to see a little bit of strategy coming to a game where grinding is a majority of the content. Big ups to the team over at Jagex for putting out something that everyone seems to be enjoying so much!
---

Kinda sounds like I should just vote no so you guys stop wasting time on another addition to the game that won‚Äôt have any rewards pass with it, and try again on a new thing. Since I don‚Äôt even know if it will be enjoyable/doable.
---
Bronze med helm and leather chap combo
---
Idk how that atrocious anime dildo made it into the game but I suspect bronies
---
i don't care much about the armor, Melee atm doesn't need a few set. We need a level 75 range/magic gear. Melee has justiciar already.
---
I think only the mace will pass the poll.
---
I think that would then be considered a player run game of chance.
---
Yeah, and the content is not something I‚Äôm opposed to; it‚Äôs just the sheer power of it is too much. I‚Äôm not opposed to a magical spec staff. I‚Äôm not opposed to dark justiciar. I‚Äôm not opposed to a magic damage bonus offhand item. But it‚Äôs overkill to the point where it‚Äôs going to put a lot of already very strong gear into the ‚Äúwas BIS, now it‚Äôs subpar‚Äù pile.
---
Honestly all the proposed rewards seem way too strong. I'm inclined to vote no on pretty much everything with the currently proposed stats.
---
Mace needs a crush bonus nerf if you're introducing crush bonus armour along with it. As it is now, it's already technically better than rapier/BoS with its similar stats plus prayer bonus, but then you'll be piling additional crush accuracy on top of it making it no contest BiS.
---
Staff blows Sang/Trident out of the water if it can be paired with Tome of Fire, that's a no contest new BiS as well.
---
Siren's Tome completely demolishes Arcane. I'd say give it a lower magic bonus than Arcane if it's gonna have a damage % bonus, but even then, the damage bonus alone pretty much invalidates Arcane regardless.
---
Inquisitor's Armour seems decently balanced on its own, an alternative to Bandos that sacrifices defense for positive crush bonus, but again - when paired with the proposed mace - it's just too much of an increase over the current BiS.
---
Love the designs of everything, but there needs to be more consideration given to how these rewards will fit *into* the current meta, not completely define it.
---
I‚Äôll do you one better. I used an addy pickaxe lmao.

It's a joke.

"Instead of handing out 10k, why not just start giving out 10m?"
---
What you said doesn't address the whole fact that people who choose to be ironmen forego trading other players or other players help on bosses/mobs. If you choose to do this then you should also be forced to solo bosses/raids. That's the whole point of the game mode, is doing things by yourself.

---
Awwww fuck
---
Is that why he tops osrs twitch about daily? Hm
---
Since the bludgeon will be totally outclassed by the new mace, would you be open to making the nightmare having a resistance to all non-abyssal weapons, similar to how corp resists non-spears? This combined with a crush weakness would give the bludgeon a niche, somewhat retaining its relevance

---
Hey squirrel! BiIly from the cc here. Love ya.
---
the DUKE of lumbridge gives you a shield and you dont even use it??? ungrateful
---
Well for one it's better than both of them. 1 higher accuracy and 2 prayer is pretty significant. For another thing, it would be massively better than them when paired with this armor that gives insane crush accuracy. It would also kill every other crush weapon, which rapier and blade don't do. Rapier is only bis if you're not fighting dragons, and blade uses charges. In comparison, this would be objectively better than bludgeon in every imaginable context. Perhaps a degrading or charging mechanic could be added so that it's still the bis crush, but you're encouraged to only boss with it.
---
No, in PvP they're used as one shot nukes/spec attacks.
---
The point I was making is you can't just go out with a 2h weapon, you always need the 1h and shield in your bag too.
---
Rapier is stab. Just like how the blade didn't kill the rapier this won't kill the rapier. The different attack styles are niche in their use itself to begin with. Adding a 1h bis crush weapon doesn't really impact the rapier
---
Alright, just hear me out on this.
---
Veng up + magic switch to ancients, then as your 7-8 squares away from your target, barrage them, then rush spec with wep and Gmaul?
---
they need simple shading. Your complex shading ruins the osrs look. Also tone down on the giant lips wtf is up with that crap
---
Back in 2003 everyone was using 2h because the attack speed was the same for all weapons in rsc
---
on release day or 12 months after release? ;)
---
I remember I'd walk around with a rune longsword and no shield equipped to make it seem like I could afford an r2h. Then RS2 came out and changed everything.
---
I didn't vote but this is exactly how I'm feeling
---
I feel like it would be a convinience to other players and they would benefit it, but at the same time, this is another small thing about OSRS I don't want to change because that's how it's always been. People can flame me all they want but eventually the game will be so 'customisable', you may as well just throw in the RS3 custom HUD.
---
