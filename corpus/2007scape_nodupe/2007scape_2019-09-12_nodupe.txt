I mean, that is how Magic Armors work... The robes have low def reqs unless they have something like a melee def bonus. It is just following the trend of armors like Mystic, Infinity, 3rd Age, and such.

Mostly it's done for pet lol

"Driving people away" - Everyone we got Jase, the community leader!  
---

---
Just kidding. Funny thing is - it's these OSRS personalities that are complaining more than anyone.  
---
These "major issues" you are complaining about (very vaguely might I add) aren't really major issues. It's pretty sad that the most prominent members of our community like to complain so much, even though half of the issues have already been addressed NUMEROUS times. Sometimes I really feel for the OSRS devs because there is nothing you can do when people just like to complain.
---
I'm voting no because it's just recycled old rubbish I don't want in OSRS. I'm all for change but not these.
---
Imo it's the funnest mini-game.

Are there plenty of worlds? when its 4 pm? People already camp bloodvelds even if its not their task since its decent gp. I had already hopped a lot. When I find a world with one person that's good enough. He literally can't kill them fast enough anyway, him purposely trying to lockdown the entire spawn is dumb.
---
I mean its great to organize but you can’t claim official status when you’re not official
---
Very low effort phone meme, surprised it didnt get shunned off here
---
What is actually like an average number though lol
---
why does a gay pride event hurt game integrity but not a lesbian romance
---
I hear Zezima has an Ironman with every set.
---
just let us toggle
---
Preach it brother
---
Just hop worlds, blow piping every bloodveld in catacombs is the quickest way to do the task in catacombs.

If you really wanna trick me you should wear a red party hat for camouflage.. that'll get me
---
Was it really a rant? I thought of it like a funny ancedote. Seems like you might've taken offense, sorry that being a dick and taking up an entire spawn when there's more than enough isn't a cool thing to do. Talking about ifs and should haves is dumb. He should've just gave up the one veld every minute since he's not killing them all THAT fast anyway. He made it pretty clear he was just wanting to be a dick.
---
"Lootshare potential/points" being an invisible, degrading metric that still allowed sniping, primarily. I missed an Ely and Divine in 5 man Corp teams and spent the next 2 weeks continuing with Corp, only to get sniped for 3 more sigils (2 arcane 1 spectral) despite, y'know, having the massive "potential" from the earlier drops - in that I got every other drop besides the sigils. 
---
After that, all I ever did (and will ever do) is solo or FFA (no split). 
---
That's not to say it can't work if designed properly, but I think the system as it was is utter trash and should not be considered without heavy fixes.
---
Stop with the teleports.
---
It takes less than a minute to get there.
---
I’m really interested to know if you got it done
---
What
---
Should I buy a rune pouch now ? 
---
Havent gotten one yet and I don't wanna miss out if it gets more expensive? any idea what you guys expect to happen?
---
I don't see a problem here the. Imagine losing everything because of a lost connection on a task or boss.
---
\&gt; I mean, that is how Magic Armors work... The robes have low def reqs unless they have something like a melee def bonus. 
---
Thats kind of untrue.  Both of the relevant lategame mage armors have no ranged defense and mithril-tier melee defense, yet require either 65 or 70 defense.
---
\&gt; It is just following the trend of armors like Mystic, Infinity, 3rd Age, and such. 
---
Mystic is far worse than Ahrims or Ancestral.  Infinity and 3rd age are prohibitively expensive and also worse than Ahrims.  Not really comparable.
---
Nothing in the trend says its normal to make an infinity-type set thats (likely) cheaper, nondegradable, and better than ahrims (and I assure you it is better, offense&gt;defense especially when we're talking joke amounts of defense).
---
But then the meanie wins. Am I not supposed to be a vigilante serving up my own justice to other runescapers as I see fit? I thought that's the whole point. How dare you try and victim blame me. wah.
---
Absolute chad with 80 slayer maxed combat
---
Rune pouch is so good yeah get it
---
I figured. Thanks for the reply! 
---
Old habits die hard. Still haven't gotten used to this "feature"
---
Runelite users have an advantage over vanilla client users, change my mind.
---
that implies like 40-50bil, how did you sell that all at once?
---
no ty
---
RS3 bad
---
Updoots pls
---
Idk I'm playing the shit out of WoW atm but as soon as I hit 60 and content becomes waiting for groups, I'll be back. In the meantime though, I don't feel like Jagex does enough to warrant me keeping an RS subscription - maybe if non-billing related customer service becomes a thing. I hate that that might impact the OSRS team, but hey that's consumerism Jamplax.

No. I will vote towards a more linear raid like tob fuck all that scouting and dumb puzzle bs
---
Didn't you post this yesterday and dox yourself?
---
Someone call 25 Buttholes
---
Input received, sending updoot
---
I’ve been in this cc for days it’s great
---
Yep, was thinking that Ghorrock could be non-pvp like in rs3.
---
Yeah but the customer support is objectively shit though. It's the level of support I'd expect from a canned air supplier.
---
Mausoleum yes. Observatory no cause once you put the grapple there it stays as a perm shortcut
---
Bah that sucks. Thank you
---
You are really overestimating their ability to affect prices. It's based off of relative demand and droprate but also overall popularity of the boss which determines how often the droprate is rolled. They also don't design new items to be certain prices because (a) that's  a pointless way to design items and (b) that will change as new challenges enter the game which requires new gear.
---
You also have the wrong understanding about prices. Ely being 700m doesnt mean it's your best offhand or that it's even a worthwhile upgrade to whatever your gear is.
---
Ah okay that makes more sense
---
I was hoping I would be in this chat.  It makes me rage so hard (PVMer btw)
---
No one pks in dragon lol. Magic isn't supposed to tank. It's all about accuracy, you don't need Ah.
---
Read tags bub
---
[removed]
---
also like 40m for a torso, which is maybe 40 mins of work between 4 people who know what they're doing? that's over 10m/hr
---
selling ba runs is ridiculously good money
---
Could we have Perdu offer looting bags for a reasonable fee? That way we won't need to waste a bank spot on them? Plus I always need to repair my items with Perdu anyway, so it's not out of the way.
---
Please, find on their website where it is possible to do this. There is literally no way to contact support for such a request.
---
Not everyone has people they can trust that can also do high content with them. If they want to do some stuff then they'll have to find some random people. They shouldn't be expected to just never do the content or just go make new friends.
---
There are literally ore rocks right next to it. Ever used superheat item ?
---
There are a bunch of runelite forks with less than legit plugins..
---
pretty sure dying to jad is like a rite of passage in this game
---
SoL could have something like "Cleansing Light" that would be like a built in upgraded crumble undead effect that would stack with Salve EI 
---
No idea for Guthix yet. Maybe stat restore on cast so you can save space using brews idk.
---
Yeah low depth, not a lot of limit orders. I used to have over a bill and I used to quasi-control the black d’hide and blue d’hide markets. At my height I had over 50k black d’hides on my balance sheet I’d always have a buy order and a sell order on the items traded. If you constantly flip but you always have a buy and sell order it’s called “market making”.
---
How do u get over the lag down there tho
---
My even quest cape, are you even able to vote in polls yet?
---
This same fucker was doing the same scam today at the GE.
---
Shoutout to all the pures and alt accounts bankstanding today who prevented this asshole from scamming noobs.
---
Level-based trade restrictions like the wildy. You wanna have a +/-50lvl trade window? Go to Tirawyn. Lumby is a +/-3. That sort of thing. These could be Hardcore Mithrilmen.
---
I would also like a link to that discord please
---
RS is a game where you complete menial tasks you need very little focus for over and over again while working towards a goal. You can do something on the side if you like. It's the perfect way to relax because it doesn't make you think.  
---
I never played WoW but I imagine it demands a much more active play-style.
---
Didn’t blackout your name gf account lol
---
Looks like you got a double scoop of not funny ice cream and dropped it in the dirt.  Nice.
---
The advantage is having the extra iq to not purposely gimp yourself for no reason 
---
Don’t hate the player hate the game 
---
Jagex can’t even make the best version of their own game why the fuck should I have to play a shittier version for no reason
---
The good ole panic click
---
Bots. Or does that fall under 3rd party clients? 😂
---
I have 76KC for superiors right now, so I'm pretty sure I got the Imbued Heart at like 60KC. I have 2 Dust Battlestaffs and 1 Heart.
---
holy shit. thanks for sharing that.. never wouldve seen the image that way.
---
My friend said the same thing. He just thought Jagex fucked up though and released some super op herblore method or something since so many noobs had it which honestly I could see them doing so I don’t blame him
---
It increases your odds if you can get them to keep going double or nothing
---
Just get better
---
Sorry my words hurt you :'(
---
Time to get a grown up sense of humour.
---
I’ll kill wildly bosses with u just come to Callisto with all your cash and valuable items tomorrow at 6:30PM EST and then go afk. We will kill him it will be awesome and please bring ur cash
---
I hate you. Got 99 fm, did an extra like 150 until I finally quit and decided it wasn’t worth on my Ironman.
---
It's ok to them because it's like 2 kills an hour for a solo player
---
You only have 140 characters to work with in every tweet
---
It's GAY
---
another option is to bind f7 to a short cut that locks your screen, i havent had anything other than games use it so it is pretty out of the way and easier to hit while standing up
---
Got that spear on my 1kc diary kill. What a heartbreaker.
---
this is why I quit
---
You don't even need a separate laptop. Just open multiple clients on one computer
---
Why couldn’t you just screenshot this instead of recording with your phone?
---
Its just memeing bro. "You mean you dint split spades?"
---
Do you happen to know where it's really good?
---
I thought about picking one up
---
Harsh reason to quit lol
---
He's not wrong. Some people attack players no matter what they're doing. Probably sadists or kill counters. Personally I like to go out and watch different PvP areas when I'm bored just to see what happens.
---
That guy just got unlucky and risked, overall claws would be better but yea dds if u don’t have 60m
---
It's been six months since the first blog post about account security, and they haven't done a single thing. I get that some changes take some time to figure out, but when something is a priority, they should divert resources to be able to get it done more quickly. Many of the changes they could begin making should have already been done, or at least been communicated that they are being worked on first. 6 months is plenty of time to get *something* done, but they haven't don't jack shit.
---
"rat in the chat, boys"
---
mandatory clan anti-crashing at corp, people showing up to bandos with full PVP gear, good times
---
It literally doesn't affect ironmen at all, so why would they vote no against it? Unless you are trying to imply that the ironman community is petty and spiteful...?
---
They said it's a result of the open world boss, and not much they can really do about it.
---
They've also said they're fine with it as it takes longer to set up a safespot and the whole point of those bosses is the danger of pkers not that the bosses r difficult. Some one safespotting is more than likely going to risk more kills b4 banking.
---
Them being safespottable doesn't stop them from doing their job, which is to bring in pvmers for pkers to kill.
---
For wildy only ironmen.
---
Tormented is much better than a void switch
---
i got 3 within like 50 kc lmfao
---
Counter people using trees by either trying to time a freeze or just spam clicking them with ranged gear on, while switching your prayers. For people dding you, you can always hide your player using RL’s entity hider, or ::renderself on the vanilla client.
---
These are just a part of no honour hybrid pking. There’s no rules, you try and get a kill by any means necessary. Focus on your prayers, and try to use freezes as much as possible, that stops them being able to do either of these things.
---
And as someone else pointed ot, the system isn’t set up at the moment for a rank based game.
---
how much taxes did u pay
---
Times 2
---
Actually we know that runescape=scaperune so rune=scape. 
---

So it would be life scapes.

"We still believe that the armours are too powerful for the live game so we are not offering those at this time."

How dumb can you be, they called Dragon Claws too powerful and still added them, like what the fuck.

How did you manage to stay interested that long?

Did you do this yourself?

I was doing the same today vene had way more pkers same with chaos ele the Callisto lure is so easy an less pkers look up olives YouTube vid explains it all pretty simple
---
If I’ve learned anything on my 20+ years alive on this planet, it’s that Jagex’s customer support is nearly nonexistent
---
Runelite can replace the HUD graphics, it xam also increase draw distance by using your gpu, which is pretty nice.
---
If you have it on right click it makes it pretty hard to accidentally hit someone
---
True lmao
---
Yes

I'm aware it would still be bis. Sang staff's effect should be unique to the sang staff.

6 foot 5? Something tells me he's compensating.

Does having it trimmed do anything?

Loss
---
What determines the ge price of Barrows armor pieces?
---
Seems the helmets are way cheaper than the chest/leg pieces, why is that?
---
Botting really. Botting and cheat clients are getting ridiculous and there's not much they can do. It's almost worse than it got in 2007, when free trade removal happened.
---
Preventing 3rd party clients would be a start since that would make it harder to develop cheat clients but that would piss a loooottt of people off because Runelite is so good.
---
Nah that’s ur ringtone and you just went through a lot to make it seem like ur wife. Sad life nerd bag
---
Idk how lazy you have to be to decide against it.
---
Got it now lol
---
I quit last month but its not because I was unsatisfied with Jagex.  
---
My biggest reasons were 1. The grinding got intolerable once most everything was around 70 and I was going for 80s.  Just don't have the time that will allow for any meaningful progress.  And 2. warding failing and the communities general reaction to it
---
Didnt pugger go here in his last video?
---
It was something I read on another post so that may or may not be true, but there are several sources saying recovery questions were removed in 2012 so I'm not sure where you're getting your info
---
I don't understand what you care so much about in regards to RS3, that you are posting it to the OSRS sub. Like we get it ok, RS3 is full shitty MTX which allow you to buy XP yada yada yada.
---
Today you learned not everyone on the internet is a troll and some aren't pretending to be stupid but are genuinely stupid
---
uh... she's the one saying that...
---
Assuming the buyer got banned too (since they took you down), did the £ get refunded to the buyer?
---
(I've always been curious about that bit)
---
Who needs loot share when you have the power of trust.
---
Also here is a page from rs support that says answering recovery questions is not all you need to recover an account. So that's not why you were hacked https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115005381989-Recovery-Questions

I appreciate a good laugh. Upvote for you sir.

Safe sex is cool and chill😎
---
Just reposting a question from yesterday: 
---
&gt;Doing some Zammy solos at the moment and i'm wondering what the current best methods are without alts/tbow running/having friends. Currently using full tank, justiciar/ely/arclight/dwh + blood barrage and i'm getting around 7 kills/trip at the moment.
---
&gt;I'm wondering if perhaps switching out for DPS accessories (while keeping justiciar/ely) and bringing a Bgs for spec might be better then the seemingly unreliable Dwh.
---
&gt;I'm currently stepping under and flicking the minis while healing up after the kill, but i've been wondering how much of a difference defender flicking might make (I believe it becomes 1:1 boss:you if you defender flick, correct?)
---
&gt;E: Switching in Sgs made for more comfortable and reliable trips but didn't really seem to extend them, it just made it less dependant on whether I got a good defence drain or not. I tried Karils + Slayer Helmet and got absolutely bodied, as expected - i'm not sure how people were posting things such as 7-10 kill trips, as even though the damage bonus from the Slayer Helmet was incredible so was the amount of damage you'd take from getting slammed.
---
Someone responded with a [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d2h643/have_a_question_about_the_game_or_the_subreddit/ezwpd8h/) to a ranged method that's used in the gear discord, but i'd like to see how far I can get without having to do that first, just to keep in the spirit of how it was intended. If anyone knows how people worked out how to do that method without getting hit though, i'd be really interested.
---
None of that is a pressing need. Account security is fine people are not taking the necessary precautions and blaming Jagex on THEIR mistakes. Customer service is fine, it’s a video game don’t hit, don’t get scammed and you have nothing to worry about, group content has both raids what more do you need?
---
(Imitates C-Engineer's voice) Quest completed.
---
It's an old meme, sir.
---
Can't autoswitch, but you can hotkey it pretty easily. But it's still cheating which does lead to bans.

Got rocky at 47 thieving while afking. Went to drop inventory and noticed he was in there. Overgrown hell cat was my current follower

Why does zulrah have good loot and doesn't need requirements?
---
is that Dardan?
---
Thick, meaning a woman (or dude, but mostly woman) with a large attractive ass / thighs, has been around for decades. The whole turning "ck" into "cc" is due to gang culture (some crips believe it's bad juju to type or write "ck" because it stands for "crip killer"). That's also been around for a while.
---
Dummy is sort of a transformation of dumb, slang for a general intensifying adverb (really thicc, extra thicc, incredibly thicc, etc.). That's been around for a while, but not as long as the two above.
---
However, these terms were mostly used in AAVE (African-American Vernacular English) in black communities, and only in the past couple of years have you seen their popularity increase on the internet.
---
Derivative!
---
Those boobs or balls where his nose should be?
---
Why is 3rd party clients in this topic of discussion lol, unless you're focusing on in an event of accounts hijacked due to 3rd party clients.
---
very nice to do a giveaway, I was the one he gave the 10m to. much appreciated
---
H
---
Well it wasn't an accident. Some nice stranger I met doing slayer was hitting one of the dudes to get him off me and I was gonna spec him before running off to maybe get the kill. I was panicking so didn't look at their names so i don't think it would've helped lol
---
Or maybe we should remove teleport scrolls.  
---
That way will it will be "fair", the game already has too many teleports.
---
What quest unlocks Dr Flopper in nmz?
---
Wilderness anvils are cool and chill😎
---
I would say look at the wiki. Certain bosses multiply how many points you get. The Inadequacy can give over 100k points in a single kill iirc
---
Hoooly shit. Okay will do, I’ll do some more research
---
Yeah, started a fresh account, figured it'd be at least a few k :/
---
I’m assuming you’re kidding but “Me” is a boss from Dream Mentor, incase anyone in the thread doesn’t know.

Did you talk to Oziach?

Dumb ass trimmed his cape.

So angry

It’s annoying to have to have all three pieces
---
Also worth noting that verac's helm has somewhat lost its value since ToB camr out, since the justiciar faceguard is superior in many ways.
---
By the time I grow a apple tree(from seed in my back yard irl) that can bear enough fruit for an apple pie, I will finally be level 77 runecrafting.
---
Yeppers. You are right by far.  Guess I was thinking about high level MLM vs iron, but for the majority of levels you make more at iron.  Thanks for pointing it out : )
---
Looks to me like the best part of this guy ran down the crack of his momma's ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress
---
Desert expansion please. Maybe we can even get a camel boss.
---
Someone has even gotten 200m without getting it.
---
Yeah
---
By the time I was doing bosses on rs3 that had valuable enough drops I'd actually be worried about it getting scammed, I found a clan to PvM with where no one scammed. Shardshare was a pretty good idea until nobody used it because everyone was PvMing with clans/friends
---
the rune defender (t) kit has the same issue
---
Deserved for carrying the General through his ToB grind
---
Seems more like you’re the problem? I’m in a clan that has over 100 members. I regularly do Chambers and ToB, volcanic mine, GWD, Zalcano, and Vet’ion. I created a discord with some friends that has 50+ members where we teach raids and constantly interact with people. Hell I see people randomly boss at the GE together. I’d say your best bet is to join a CC if you ever want to do group activities.
---
The wiki says an average master casket is 855k, so you're a little below average with 468k. Congrats on your first master clue!
---
If your wife doesn't want you playing runescape, get rid of her. She clearly doesn't love you.

This should be a banworthy offense. I'm jealous.
---
I did Tog yesterday and the fucker gave me herblore xp. That shit hurt, i didn't pay attention that my rc xp caught up with herblore.
---
No prep depends more on the raid setup than your experience. Gotta make sure you have bosses with low switches that drop brews or ovls
---
Lol
---
Well atleast it got me motivated to do regicide lol

Looks like trump and the wall he wanted so bad

Yes. Camels smell and poop weird pellets everywhere. Also they have weird coarse hair and awkward knees.

I think that people who like camels either have no real experience with camels, or have far too much experience with camels.

I'm a noob farmer (51 farming btw), and today I did my first herb run.
---
I bought 5 ranarr seeds @ 51.7k ea, for a total of ~258k, which yielded 38 ranarrs which at their current value are about ~302k.
---
So, I made a roughly 44k profit, planting in 5 plots, using magic secateurs and ultra compost. This doesn't really seem like a fantastic way to make money for how tedious it is.
---
Anyone have any advice? What am I doing wrong?
---
*Blessed Staff of Light* potential effects (only needs one)
---
X% Reduced prayer drain by Y% after being equipped for 5 seconds. 
---
X% increased hit damage based on enemy's Y% prayer remaining.
---
(Very low)% chance to disable the enemy's non-overhead prayers for X seconds.
---
*Guthix Staff of Entropy* potential effects:
---
X% chance to reduce the target and caster's defence by Y levels.
---
X% chance to remove Y defence levels from target and the player receives Y/2.
---
Gain X damage to hits where X = levels removed from player's defence.
---
X% chance to swap the enemy's defence and attack stats for Y seconds.
---
You literally brought up the issue, and are now complaining about people bringing it up

Maybe add a scroll to the bh shop where npcs would be unaggro(wont pj the player for 20 mins)the scrolls would be stackable.

People did use them, for things that were actually worth sharing, like seismic wands. Problem is everything that coinshared also shardshared, like archer rings that were worth 30k.
---
But i wouldn't even call it a problem. Sure, when 1 shard goes missing that's and entire item that will never be retrieved, but honestly, that's fine.
---
I feel like shardshare is completely fine and would boost some PvMing. Right now, it's quite hard to find people to go bandos with, because you need someone trusted to go with, unless you want to no-split. But nobody wants no-split and they demand split, but you can't 100% trust them to split if they get tassets, etc. Back in the day you could easily form forum teams because you didn't have to worry about splitting. You just pop coinshare/lootshare and you're good.
---
I recently did 1k kills for 144m and only died once due to a friend starting to skype me lol.
---
You can also just press tab to reply to a pm.
---
As I said, the price varied from $0.68-$0.59 per M over time
---
Also already exist
---
Yeah, I just looked him up. I have no idea what a "diary pure/skiller-ish account" is (and I won't argue the terminology with him), but if he's trying to get all this done by 100 combat (not that I saw that in the OP at all) then he's passed that, since he's already 100 combat according to the Runelite combat calculator on stat lookup.
---
I figured trading through multiple mules would keep the money clean I guess, I dunno
---
Sounds so luractive, 144M is a lot!
---
One of OSRS's many unfinished questlines, unfortunately :(
---
more items = more obscure items for people to not know prices of.
---
Yeah haha I got 17 rings
---
"io cc" Clan chat. They frequently do rev pking. I run on my main but there's a lot of pures as well to cover every bracket.
---
I agree with the twitter post. No the game isnt dying but there are alot of huge proboems atm that negatively impacts the game.
---
Another thing I hope Jagex will soon prioritize will be engine work. Seriously its 2019 and the official client still doesnt have multicore/gpu rendering. RuneLite GPU rendering doesnt like mesa + amd cards and the only functioning one for me is OSBuddy, which is a client I will never pay for due to the shady devs.
---
nmz pays all its absortions at 10 min afk at some point using scbs in hard, in normal sooner
---
reagroing crabs without runelite add ons takes more time than nmz
---
Can you make chance for an extra larren keys drop depending how deep in the Wildy you slew the monster. 
---
Eg: 
---
Below 29 wildy = 1/200
---
above 30 wildy =1/100
---
Above 40 wildy = 1/90
---
Above 50 wildy = 1/80
---
\+65 magic accuracy and +6 prayer off of 3 pieces of 30 defense armor is just not very balanced imo.  Ill vote yes if they change it to be either more sane or have higher stats, or a less lame entrance mechanism than wildy chests.
---
You do you though.
---
I didn't, it was 30b total over a year or so timespace (4 total rwt occasions)
---
Man...get ready for the regret in a few months.
---
Upvoted, also cant use GPU rendering on RuneLite.
---
Made u look 👀
---
Mostly sand casino, though I was 30 levels off maxing with 20m+ slayer and High boss counts.
---
Id still say 90% came from staking though
---
You missed the point but even the point youre trying to make gives 0 sense. Why not add support for new framerates?
---
What's the joke?
---
I have 270 zulrah KC... Granted it's not a lot,  
---
But safe to say i am "farming" Zulrah.
---
Day before yesterday i killed 20 zulrahs in a row.  
---
Yesterday i died to Zulrah 5 times in a row!  
---
I was tired after work. So i guess Vorkath is similar in which there  
---
are gonna be off nights..... 100k per death is ouchie!
---
If they're trying to use anti-scamming/luring they're the same people. They'll ask me to anti-lure and they'll set up this fake scenario where I pick up a whip in a pvp world and then we split. But then next time they want me to go as bait which is how they get you. Its very elaborate but that's how they get people who aren't attentive and informed.
---
Look my thread history I literally play with 3accs+3 tbows
---
Here's some Pressing Issues; My food doesn't register my click during PKing, and I die.. Has happened to lots of ppl. It's ridiculous and needs to be fixed. Nvr used to happen pre-E0C. My character will even do a weird animation at times, because it registered the eat signal, but did not eat. The animation; a long pause before falling to the ground to my death
---
Skill capes.
---
Not boosted capes.
---
So I sit there tping basically 20 seconds after I get there every time I see a white dot?
---
Fuck my life every money making option is rs seems to suck dick unless it’s end game slayer.
---
No surprise that its post history is full of racist comments
---
I already have multiple accounts still.
---
Didn't plan on doing another staker just yet, now my main is banned, I can actually play the game properly and continue levelling another acc.
---
I also have an ironman, but don't fancy playing him at the moment
---
and hunter
---
Join us mate, our CC is named Fkn Legends. U can join through the name H A V O
---
We mostly do bossing of all kinds, we also teach Chambers of xeric when clan mates have the stats.
---
Yeah, pretty much
---
I had your stance about RuneLite for a while and resisted getting it, but I was put at such a disadvantage I felt like I had to get it. It still feels like cheating but, as the old saying goes "if you can't beat them, join them".
---
Oof
---
I read someone suggesting this before, I hope they are pine scented.
---
I'll tag you when I get number 4!
---
What can I say? I'm better with custom templates.

Buying a bond is not gambling nor is it a token with a random chance of winning something, it's essentially just credit. What MPs are discussing specifically are whether there should be regulation on overspending players like we try to enforce on traditional betting and specifically a ban on lootboxes.
---
3 rangers 0 holy sandals and 0 fire capes you fucking noob!
---
Jk bro I know that ain’t you, that’s insane luck tho gz
---
I don’t currently play the game but I still want it to be great for players.
---
Cracking pk gromit lad
---
I'm willing to bet that the overwhelming majority of people see the QoL 3rd party clients bring to the game as a huge boon. There's a very small vocal minority that exists here and on Twitter that are on a crusade against any and all 3rd party clients regardless of what they actually add to the game.
---
Stfu
---
You know that you can teleport out of there, you can also teleport from vorkath. If you keep your HP close to full you shouldnt die very easily @ Vorkath.
---
The S in skotizo stands for spade.
---

---
\*orange
---
How could u post something so controversial yet so brave
---
What the actual fuck.
---
You can't be serious?
---
Runelite really isn't the issue. It's other 3rd party clients built in too of others that implement unallowed plug-ins. Those branching off are the ones not really abiding by what JaGeX has requested.
---
You don't understand what 1-hit means
---
Buying a bond can be used for gambling.
---
Yes you're right; the sand casino will be fine, gold sellers on the other hand could become a bigger issue.
---
Feels good to have quest cape man
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
Thank you!
---
Tf was grouped ironman? Only a group of people could trade eachother indefinitely?
---
You get over 100k on average every vorkath kill. You shouldn’t be dying at all once you get the hang of it after about 10 kills, just stick with it
---
I see like 14 rings
---
Dude I did 10 kills the other day and made 2m haha. It’s preety good.
---
20 atk req instead of 60. (Was in devblog)
---
Will create some interesting pk builds.
---
Most people don't train in nmz. 99 slayer alone will basically get you max combat if you don't focus too much on efficiency
---
NVM just noticed your hp is too low. Honestly, it's gonna be tough until you are able to unlock brews. Just got farming contracts hard and make sure you're setting miscellania to herb, honestly 70-80 herb didn't take me more than a month to do. Besides that, there's not much else you can do here to improve your setup easily.
---
Realized that they are f2p now. 
---
First idea was p2p with spec 20 att, so I got confused.
---
Do overheads not help?
---
They ask for void mage and tormented brace lmao
---
weird thing is, every client has the problem...?
---
What method do you use to boost herblore every week?
---
Yeah that was the original idea, definitely wouldve been cool
---
yeah it would be trivial if i had brews, but i dont have anywhere near the amount of herbs to get to 76 herblore (stew boost to 81) and i dont have the money to put into kingdom. i spent my entire cashstack on 70 con for this quest
---
Ur kinda right. You will always protect it because it becomes an untradeable item
---
The only way to get one hit is to get hit by his fireball which id ridiculously slow (like 8 ticks or something?) You're only gonna die if you dc or have a stroke. Its definitely more consistent and better money than zulrah, many would like there to be a 100k reclamation fee but the UIM community is strongly against it I believe
---
TBH I am quite amazed that the rs db never got out, especially with the rouge jmods like jed.
---
They did a good job on that.
---
I honestly don’t think it makes much of a difference. I’n the times I pray, and the times I just use food, I can last equally as long. And the cost of food is less than pray pots. So I usually go with just food
---
Short answer - not really easily... 
---
Longer answer - If you go to the highscores for a more 'niche' stat that you know. I.e. Their Runecrafting level is 73, then you will be able to surely determine (by prodding the highscores) who has that exact runecrafting level and then what their other stats are.
---
You will see that currently there are 93,428 people with 73 or above Runecrafting and 88,451 with 74 or above. So there's just under 5000 players with exactly 73 Runecrafting, you could relatively easily scrape those players names using a text-scraping program. THEN query the highscores API with each one of those 5000 players names to get a good little data-set of account that have at least 1 of the stats you know:
---

---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/overall.ws?table=21&amp;page=3738 
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/overall.ws?table=21&amp;page=3539
---
From there you'd look to get all that into a spreadsheet or other database (spreadsheet would be fine for 5000 rows) and simply filter as you desire. 
---
Super-long answer: Do the above but do it for every skill so that you know every persons stat in the entire game (assuming that they are ranked for any skill on the highscores), combine into one spreadsheet then remove duplicates. 
---
This will be hard as you will often get blocked from scraping the highscores too frequently and you'll need to find a computer/program that can handle millions and millions of rows of data.
---
And both scrolls and torture and anguish and dwh lmao
---
Was ready to get 20 att on my obby.
---
They don't have special attack
---
Very well put.
---
Omg his nose could also be eyes
---
Nice
---
Nah how bout the fact that I have the reddit app on my phone so it’s easier to post right from my camera roll and the quality of this picture means absolutely nothing since you can clearly see the achievement. Go be petty with your shit somewhere else lol
---
Hmm
---
More so I'd like more "true to oldschool" *feeling* of updates. Warding just doesn't feel oldschool to me (or very interesting/ unique conceptually)
---
So many new "micro" updates introduce minor item meta shifting things. Talk to X npc turn your weapon into this, get Y points from Z task and exchange it for X convenience or +500% charges. Items that came from big lore/ quests in RS3 are like scuffed afterthoughts in OSRS.
---
It makes OSRS feel like a cheap RS3 wannabe when by nature the dynamic systems that were inherent in OSRS (interconnected systems that tied all around the map rather than camping X piece of content for whatever goal you have) were never really appreciated or taken into consideration when designing new content. Which is why Zeah still feels like a barren fucking themepark. Forthos dungeon is a huge step in the right direction though.
---
none of these are issues the majority of the playerbase come in contact with, and claiming theyre the reason people "quit" is moronic. of course people are going to quit/leave/take break for awaited games; this is unavoidable and using it to support your dumb agenda is silly.
---
Zulrah/Vork/GWD. Plenty of money makers outside of revs.

isnt the msb(i) practically that? redwood bows too op, but a buff to msb is a ok?

This, is a bucket.

Why? All he can do is mute you for an hour. Meanwhile you have the satisfaction of not having a nose that smells like JMod shit.

Yeah now I just think of skills as milestones to unlock new quests, but when I was a kid I didn't have barrows gloves or ancients despite getting base 70s.

Skeletal wyverns arnt bad cash yano low reqs for them too bar the 72 slayer haha

Um sweaty, "pussy hole" is actually transphobic and toxic??!

He didn't use any brews, but he used some sweets correct.

He still figured out some amazing tactics, if you can get your hand on a zammy brew.

Aren't there some monsters that drop sara brews doe?

I'm gonna need you to never post again

he obviously wasn't refering to osrs

Pretty sure this is making fun of how bad mtx is in RS3.

There are 5 orn kits at 1/851 (zenytes, occult, ddef), 4 at 1/3404 (godswords), one at 1/12765 (d plate) and one at 1/25530 (d kite)
---
This gives us a rate of 0.007167 or 1/139.51 per reward roll for any orn kit. 
---
Chance of getting 3 in 7 (average number) reward rolls = 7C3 * (0.007168)\^3 * (1-0.007168)\^4 = 0.00001252 per casket, or **1/79842.64** to get exactly 3 orn kits in one casket. 
---
This is just about 2.5x as rare as going as dry as Kacy currently is for bloodhound, then going as dry as Settled was for dwh.
---
Chance goes up if you consider getting more than 3, but only very slightly. 
---
**tl;dr 50/50**
---
What’s ahk
---
yes,  demonic gorrilas have a 1/30 drop of a sara brew (2), but if i want 20+ brews, it would actually be faster to get the herb level than camp them for it
---
you sis has quite the talent

Upvote for murked

Got mine at 67cb

idk if it was the same for you but i spent a lot of time playing minigames, took me like 6 years to get somewhere around 1500 total  but i passed it in osrs after on and off playing for a few months

Phone 2FA is significantly less secure. It's highly vulnerable to social-engineering based sim-swapping attacks. OTP based 2FA is generally the most secure.
---
Skids have been exploiting SMS-based 2FA for several years and it's honestly hilarious that people think it's secure.

No. In rs2 you got coins automatically equal to the ge price. What he means is you get the gp of the highest existing offer.

Slayer might be nice to max out since you probably have max house

Me: goes to wildy with an msb and black dhide

How can we get better non raids group bosses if osrs lacks a fair share system though?

Yeah I'm waiting for tears to take me to 71, just got 69 yesterday.

For the final fight go over the south bridge and wait in the lower left ledge corner whilst the gnome knock back the demon's health, when it gets down to \~10% health, go over the east bridge and finish it off with mage/range. You'd be better suited spending that 3M on getting your prayer up using ensouled heads in Arceuus.
---
Round out your low stats. Base 90s is pretty easy from where you are now.

The woman that runs the merch store sounds funny, like "our merch goblin"

There's a few "brand new level 3 account" non-ironman series that I'm enjoying.  They don't have super interesting restrictions but it's fun to watch nonetheless.  'Raikesy', 'Smallexplamp', and 'KempQ' are the youtubers I have in mind.  
---
Those are the closest to 'gridlocked' that I can think of.  Never really thought about it but it seems Framed has a bit of a monopoly on region-locked non-ironman content haha.
---
Seriously, wtf is with the official client not having GPU acceleration in 2019? This was teased as working back before mobile, and then officially outright shelved (according to Ash).

I feel the only reason this is acceptable is because of RL and OSB having GPU plugins...

When you switch to a spec weapon the bar takes a while to show up, so weapons without specs are used less.

Okay, how do you know about my conversations with my mom?

Can you make them for anything else? Or just Iphone and Samsung?

Sure man!

Not sure.  Maybe I live under a rock, but this is the first complaint I’ve seen about it.
---
Now imbue that slayer helm !
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Same for me
---
Same issue here
---
There is a delay when switching weapons for the special attack bar to pop up, thus not allowing you to instantly swap to an AGS and spec.

Same yo.

20\^26 is quite a large number i imagine

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW

This ^^ I've had mods accuse me of stuff that I didn't do just b/c they were adamant I did it. For example when I misclicked when I got up to get something to eat or botting b/c I had an almost exact pattern when skilling.
---
 I don't blame them for thinking it but I hate it when I did nothing wrong.

same issue
---
Same here.....

It's a copypasta my dude

While we do the game update we are running server maintenance so all worlds will remain offline until the maintenance is complete. We will post on social and the website when the worlds are back online.

yes, This is bullshit week ago server errors new this jagex get your shit together

Gonna catch up on the rest of the series tonight, you're a solid content creator. Any new plans?

There was a message about client maintenance and it “taking a few minutes”.
---
Good work on the POH advertisement Maz, went above and beyond what was expected I think! Well worth the wait.
---
What did Jase say?
---
didnt the server go off with a timer because it was an update? so i doubt any hcim are dying from this
---
yep, agreed. blowpipe/tbow (blowpipe is so disgustingly retarded that in some cases it's better than bow, even places it's not supposed to be like against mages such as mystics in cox) is pretty much the meta and nothing else is really worth using.
---
Thanks!
---
 A word of advice
---
My asshole can fit a car tire. If anyone actually reads this, keep in mind that an average asshole of a human being can dilate between 2-4 centimeters. One car tire is roughly 500x200 cm. So yeah, fitting a car tire in my asshole is probably a world record and should deserve a Guinness book of world records entry. My first piece of advice if you think you can beat this record is don’t even try. My second piece of advice is (if the first piece of advice is ignored), start small and gradually move on to bigger things. Anal bleeding ruins many articles of clothing including but not limited to socks and shoes. Actually, while we’re on the topic of anal stretching and clothes being ruined, you should know once the anus is stretched beyond 8 cm, the sphincter is rendered useless. Gravity will just pull turds right out of your ass with no regard for anything. If your diet is fiber rich, this may not be as big of a problem, as solid turds can be easily disposed. However, if you are a fan of taco bell, be warned that splash damage is a very real thing. It’s best during the anal stretching period to invest in a wide range of butt plugs.
---
Not only will this stem the tide of fecal matter making dramatic exits through what can only be described as an industrial laundry chute, but with the proper fitment the plugs will maintain your latest stretch during downtime. Proper resting with a press fit butt plug is good and allows the body to accept the new monstrosity that is the size of your asshole. Anal fissures are a by-product of stretching too rapidly without the necessary downtime and recovery. Anal fissures are extremely painful, especially when infected by wet bowel movements. The only benefit of anal stretching is lack of fart noise. Like a balloon stem, the known fart noise is caused by air movement vibrating the orifice it exits. Noise intensity are directly proportional to air speed velocity, while harshness of pitch is indirectly proportional to size of hole. With an escape hatch the size of a mini-sub, air speed velocity is virtually zero, thus no noise is heard. Any gas produced by the body and exiting the colon tends to just waft out as produced. I’m not even sure the action of “farting” is a thing when your asshole can fit a small adult inside of it. I suppose technically there is some air movement, but it would be no more significant than running a leaf blower through the grand canyon. Finally, it should be cautioned to never leave your expanded asshole uncovered, as birds, fish, and reptiles will nest in discovered cave dwellings. This then becomes a health and safety violation in many public settings that is best to generally avoid. I personally recommend having a sealed traffic cone or small inflatable raft handy when leaving your asshole alone for more than 5 minutes. Butt plugs are an option but only if you are staying under 24 centimeters in diameter. Greater than 24 centimeters, and the butt plug industry will have to create a custom sized plug (which is costly and generally best to avoid). So in conclusion, when going to the extremes of anal stretching, keep realistic goals, but always prepare ahead of time for a size you may think unattainable. Your anus will surprise you.

11$ per month no mention of server maintanance tysm

Take my upvote and go away :)
---
Absolutely. Most houses are designed to have the altar north of the portal as soon as the enter the house so you tend to have your compass due north. Current placement is begging to be misclicked on when running from phials to the portal.
---
Also, haven't tried it yet, but will it make the pathing longer if running from the south?
---
Why? It wasn't a dc, it was a system update.
---
All clients and even mobile :( i am lost
---
Chill out bro Jesus, they’re doing some maintenance, be patient
---
Players above 50 Construction may now advertise their house on a listing board beside the POH portals.
---
The columns on the board show the following information: Owner's Construction level, if they have a Gilded altar, Portal nexus tier, Jewellery box tier, Pool tier, Occult altar tier, and if they have an Armour stand.
---
The last column shows the owner's house location and allows entry if they are home.
---
All but the last column can be sorted from highest to lowest.
---
You can toggle the ability to see only houses from the portal you are standing at, or all houses advertised on your world.
---
You can right click or long press the advertisement listing board to visit the last house you were in, if the owner is home.
---
The board can hold up to 200 advertisements per world.

PvP Balancing
---
Imbued God Capes
---
Imbued God Capes have been changed to behave as other untradeables do and turn to broken form when PK'd in PvP. Perdu will repair imbued God Capes for a fee of 75k. Players can also use trouver parchments on imbued God Capes to allow them to be kept in their unbroken state upon dying with them past level 20 Wilderness.

Magic Defence Calculation Changes Beta
---
In the Bounty Hunter Rework blog we discussed changing the way PvP Magic defence is calculated from 70/30 to 50/50 as it is in the Deadman worlds. This will not affect PvM.
---
Before any changes are made to the live game, we would like to test adjusting the way magic defence is calculated, these adjustments will go to a beta Thursday 19th September. While any testing is ongoing, we encourage you to try the changes and let us know what you think. If these changes are found to be unsuitable, equipment balancing will continue in the same manner it does now.

You can choose from hard back poly-carbonate cases or shock absorbent soft gel cases.
---
The designs feature some iconic images such as the Map of Gielinor, Vorkath, Tim and Crunchy and the 2004 Login Screen.
---
Check them all out here!

---
Stun effects in the Chambers of Xeric can no longer be dodged by lighting fires.
---
the servers have been wacky for me lately so thank you :)
---
Is this a larger update than the previous ones? Usually worlds are back up within minutes of the update. To add on to that, why would worlds being down block launchers' ability to launch the game to the lobby.
---
the shave job is cleaner than the tattoo
---
Wow
---
no infernal cape? not allowed to have an opinion
---
I'm not sure I like this push towards changing things under the hood to be different in PvP then in PvM. Yes, PvP balance definitely does need fixing but how are people going to know that as soon as they step over the wilderness ditch magic defence calculation changes?
---
It's a difficult line to walk.
---
3rd age is basically cosmetic/flex gear anyway. Never known anyone to use 3rd age for its stats. I wouldn't see an issue with this.
---
Oh hundred percent, they fucked it up on that part.
---
Ooo damn
---
This, i have no words... $11...
---
I got 2 items in my first 200 chests. Ahrims staff and Karils hood.
---
Yes.

*are 51*

Omg xp waste
---
Where can you see what the rarest skills are?
---
Honestly, are people really quitting? I have a feeling numbers are still going up tbh. Tell me if I'm wrong but I doubt the devs would just be sitting back taking it if the numbers were bad. This seems like the usual twitter outrage to me.
---
OP are 51 iq
---
And what's the point of muting a bot smartass? They dont talk. Maybe you shouldn't either do it about the things you have no clue.

congrats dude. now go for ferocious!

Beautiful

Oldschool doesn't have a lobby. When you're in the lobby your character is already ingame but you simply get the lobby as a pop up screen before you can continue. Hence, why the lobby is removed when logging in/out in the wilderness.
---
smh the xp waste
---
Yeah, ideally keep TBow the endgame, keep DHB for its niche, bring blowpipe down to an actual reasonable spot and add a ~~very~~ very rare drop to add on (akin to tentacle) and restore its original stats. Add a new T70 bow to give variety and competition to the newly adjusted BP

Please do. The current placement interferes with anyone running bones from Phials.

Is this about RS3 MTX or OSRS/RS3 staking addicts?
---
so according to your theory, where 1 second = 61320 minutes 
---
this means that for a kitten to grow into a adult cat in runescape which takes about 3 hours in our time will make them 11037600 minutes old or 183960 hours old or 7665 days old or 21 years old

100% get all levels to base 90. No other suggestion needed.

It was once per Apple or Google Play account.

What makes it suck for me is I'm higher cb so I'm always just afking after I finish my task and hes still got 50kc to go.

This post would've been so much better without the shit rc joke

If you're playing runescape and haven't come to terms with the fact that that's exactly what you'll be doing I have bad news for you

Got em.
---
Would like to know this too, I've seen a lot of people with it but it doesn't seem to do it for me (but it does auto screenshot it).
---
Sounds like a regular day for there.
---
Google has its own safeguards to prevent people making more then a handful of accounts. Not sure about apple. In any case, it wasn't as easy to abuse as many think.
---
annnnnnnnnnnnnnd this comment right here folks, is why we have half these issues in the game in the first place.
---
People are selfish and don't care about the health of the game as much as they care about what will personally benefit them.
---
I don't understand this: On my ironman, will I be able to obtain magic shortbow (i) and ring of wealth (i) without having to do PvP as I can now from wildy slayer?
---
Does the magic defence calculation mean that with 99 def/mage there would be no change?
---
heathen
---
Colour it it for level 50.
---
ah yes, because we currently splash too many barrages let’s go and make mains tankier to magic.  
---
there was nothing wrong with pures being relatively very resistant to magic
---
If they're running through runelite, they are runelites responsibility.
---
Thanks - I like this suggestion. How much do you think is a reasonable price?
---
It's always an issue with supply and demand. If you remove bots then prices of some items rise meaning more money to be made from those methods so more noobs/lower leveled players will use those methods for making money.
---
It it = it in
---
Bots spamming gold sites my dude?
---
Yes to the boat idea, but not for the scrolls.
---
Because they don't need to be so rare that the Hard and Elite diaries make a significant difference. We're considering making them easier to obtain at the lower end of NPC too.
---
So do you just pick and choose whether it's weekly or fortnightly?
---
Most f2p suicide bots are NOT making 50m
---
Update?
---
This was what I was expecting to see :) thanks for such a thorough explanation!
---
&gt; If the Silk Road was shut down I have no doubt botting clients can be too   
---
Yes, because law enforcement would be better off pouring resources into investigating and shutting down (legal) software which disrupts a 15-year old medeival clicking game than marketplaces which allow for the exchange of illicit goods such as deadly weapons and harmful drugs.  
---
You bellend.
---
Wilderness Slayer would still provide the points you need to buy it from the Slayer Reward points shop.
---
on a scale of 1 to 10. around 12
---
I gathered that much from the above response
---
But thanks for letting me know. :)
---
I'm just bummed I had like a slayer streak about 480.
---
Perfect opportunity for new people to come in and take their place. If you're going to have an in-game "business" then you should be ready to react to any changes just like real life businesses have to adapt to new rules and regulations.
---
What are they protesting? Jagex making it easier and quicker for everyone to find a POH? Bye.
---
I'm not in the gear discord so I wasn't sure whether DHL would be better then Mage (I believe Mage was still better unless you bought significant risk before DHL was introduced, but i've yet to do any calcs - I was just wondering if there was any accepted wisdom on the subject). 
---
I'm more then a little surprised that Sarachnis isn't competitive with a 1/60 drop rate, considering that people have been saying that the drop rate was a point of controversy.
---
Thanks for your help.
---
You keep the boots on death with the kit on because it's untradable, I only lose my platelegs when I die because everything else has a kit on it.
---
it's not even that much better than ahrims. 5 magic attack isn't going to go far. Have you actually done any calculations on hit chance with it vs ahrims? It has no def bonus why should it have a high def requirement? Ancestral only has 65 def requirement but it's better offensively. Has lower def bonus than ahrims too
---
agility, mining, fishing, thieving, rc.
---
He was teasing da noobs
---
Depends, but maybe.  You need to remember that Ahrims is p uncommon since theres 6 brothers.
---
You mean joke or sex?
---
In a perfect world
---
Oh shit oh fuck
---
Don't consult them with them as they're requesting please. There's no reason to put them on a pedestal.
---
Yeah, when x is another piece of in-game content. Programmers and artists are not going to work on customer support or account security
---
I do a lot of excavation work and I can tell you that even a compressor with a jackhammer would have trouble eating that rock.
---
inb4 rs3 is banned in both US and UK for lootboxes.
---
It was removed a long time ago.
---
Farming and herbi to go then?
---
Good riddance
---
I've seen a few pk videos with it, the access to dragon arrows is nice but not worth the risk if skulling and keeping it as your +1.
---
Oh, are you going for all?  And if you are can lvl 3's do herbiboar?
---
Yeah I gotta go with you on this one.
---
Things you love to see
---
Gold ore is 99 smithing, crafting, and magic. You would never need to worry about GP either.
---
Have you played DMM? Have you fought against a competent tri/hybrid 1 ticking these armours?
---
He’s not botting though?
---
Somebody should make a meme that says as much
---
Bai
---
How about 26 attack over mystics or 20 over infinity?  Since thats what its replacing in the 30 defense category.  The fact that its literally better than Ahrims is just icing on the cum cake.
---
\&gt; Ancestral only has 65 def requirement but it's better offensively. 
---
"Only" 65?  65 is a lot.  Reason its so high is because they were afraid of adding that much offensive bonus to a set accessible to pures.  Also, ancestral is an expensive raids unique.
---
A legitimately negligible amount compared to the items’ actual values, lmao. It’s dumb.
---
Might want to add this only applies to non-pvp deaths.
---
So there's no form or anything, you need to personally write a letter to support and ask them to manually remove them, and then they might do it, especially in cases when it's too late?
---
I'm struggling to imagine a more retarded way of addressing the issue
---
Ngl im salty
---
i can do herbiboar. actually i have around 6k kc over there. and yes. i am slowly going for all the skilling pets. but i also do random overxp to skills that doesn't even have pets.
---
How the fuck you get all that Slayer xp? 
---
Also, please seek help.
---
It's less than 200m in gear?
---
Grats, after getting 99 rc I did not have enough willpower to get the pet. Big props!
---
&gt;  or ever even fighting anything
---
we all get to send a rat from tutorial island back to lumbridge
---
this is true, but doing wildy slayer ive personally gotten about a key an hour for probably around a 1/200 for a piece (based on dusk mystic), compared to several barrows runs an hour at 1/102 for ahrims piece. with that being said, people will have a stock of keys already so who knows
---
Someone posted this like 12 hours ago. At least wait a couple days before you repost.
---
DKS fairy ring to the mine then, otherwise high construction level, recharge necklaces at myths/legends guild with mythcape, fairy ring to legends, or just have med varrock diary and tab to g.e and cart to bf
---
The new PoH advertisement board update, I don't see whats too bad about it tbh.
---
&gt; Allow RWT, but block players guilty of either RWT or botting offences of participating in it. Jagex would be able to take a commission on every trade.
---
This post is a shitshow in general but i'd like to point out that by allowing RWT jagex admits that gp has a real world value. If they do this they would be in a shitton of trouble because they are now running an actual casino by allowing the duel arena.
---
No one is trading the obsidian sword right now the price has skyrocketed. Anyone know a reason behind this? Literally just offered 530k and it didn’t fill

How about my Nokia 3310 (2000)? :)

I heard Jase say to delete your reddit account and never post again. I heard it. Please listen to him
---
I still feel like 5k an hour is over powered. Lower it to maybe 3k or less and I'd vote for it
---
Jesus I wonder if they make better profits from RS3 addicts or osrs memberships.
---
Serious question, what do you think should be done about 3rd party clients, and how practical do you think that is?
---
Good
---
What I want is the client to open in the right size, so that I am not required to use 3rd party software to resize it. Simple things like that are what I want from jagex's client.
---
I don’t think anyone is using real money on bonds to then go and stake. This is definitely about RS3.
---
Eh why not
---
Congrats bud, my lifelong friend gifted me most of his bank before he went off to have a "career" whatever that is... what's scary is when the money runs out I'm actually gonna have to learn how to earn gp in this game ahaha
---
Really like this one!
---
Obviously by banning them all.
---
Gz on 420m ttxp
---
Oh I thought you were mentioning the vast amount of recolours
---
Device wouldn't work, there are way around that, specially with emulators.
---
Credit card is out of their hands. Google handle the transactions and payment methods, so Jagex couldn't enforce it.
---
Once per account seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure how possible it is for Google play to determine different Jagex accounts. Likely not possible.
---
You could try starting your own clan
---
As a UIM, I was really scared at first, but then I read the UIM section. I like the idea, seems like a solid way to fix things. Plus, now I don't have to grind out millions in coin to train smithing efficiently!
---
This is false unless very new
---
Venezuela will starve to death when their gold farmers are grinding those SOTE reqs and dying on the bosses.
---
Currently I've been grinding out WC for months.  I spent a long time doing Yews, which was slow but afk which is important since, ya know, I'm at work.  Once I hit 90's I switched to redwoods and that has been great.  Better xp/hr than yews and more afk.  
---
Sometimes I'll hop in the NMZ since I can make a full inventory of absorb pots last like ~4 hours, so it's a great way to kill the entire morning for me.
---
Then occasionally I might do some fishing or mining but these are not as AFK so I only do it here and there.  Slayer is also a possibility as long as I get a task I don't need to pay much attention to.
---
But, mostly it's been wcing with the goal of getting 99 wc.  I'll be focusing on rc heavily after that, but it's more for the money than going for a 2nd 99.
---
&gt; What I want is the client to open in the right size
---
Ummm, don't know what to tell you. It does that fine for me.
---
&gt; so that I am not required to use 3rd party software to resize it.
---
I haven't had to do that since OSRS first launched.
---
These hosts used autotypers to advertise (against the rules) and are now only mad because they have more competition. You absolutely do not need to make changes to accommodate them.
---
i love it, great work
---
A really cool idea! I'm for anything that combats hop-shop-scape
---
I literally just used it a little over a week ago so it’s definitely new.  Little bro was going to use it today too so this is shitty news.
---
Doesnt matter how much money it is, still a 5m loss per bot. If someone traded you and said hey heres 5m do you want it? Youd accept.
---
Twitter is full of these players. Which is why you take their opinion with a grain of salt. They are not as important to the majority of the player base. He's worried about elite clue drop rates because it is slightly easier then when he did it.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Still wondering how many alts they're talking about having spec transfer.
---
More generally, if your def and mage are equal there is no change
---
This is true, technically that's Vannakas first Slayer task too. He should be giving us XP for that!
---
It's always been like this.  It's not a very commonly traded item.  If you must have it right now, then keep upping your offer.  If you can wait, just drop in something reasonable and leave it for a day, and it should fill.
---
Settled's Morytania locked account got 85 slayer without completing a task.
---
Fucking baffling.
---
Just getting some feedback from the POH communities. Thanks for the feedback everyone that did provide some while I was there!
---
Imagine your backpack was full
---
Yep. They patched a few loopholes in their systems this week. This was one, while the other one was kruk's dungeon agility. RIP spam click agility
---
Plus a golden shower
---
Old hosts are mad that they have new competition due to the POH board
---
If you believe some hosts they lose money in perpetuity, as they whine about lack of donations most of the time they’re in their houses. I’ve never seen that from Aful and Xgrace but I also think people default to them when they show up so there’s no lack of traffic there during busy hours.
---
Just seems odd because I flipped a couple of them yesterday and they bought for around 440k. Guess I should have held them for a day haha
---
People are whining about not getting donations as much since there more competition for hosts
---
Wasn’t the point of making an Ironman to challenge yourself against tradition methods of progressing in rs? I get no one likes bots or buying from shops but we’re just updating the game to make Ironman mode to make it play just like a main before the grand exchange.
---
Yea, Id try barrows and saranchis and see what you like better. Barrows was a lot better money for me, but like you said, sarachnis has the pet.
---
For the looting bag:
---
So you get a looting bag full of food (or 6...?) And suicide so you have a crap ton of food on the floor, then you dont bank for the hour.
---
Copied their section about it:
---
Looting Bag Method: Emblems
---
Jagex recently updated the cost of looting bags from the bounty hunter store from 150k points to 10k points. This means that each bag now only costs around 5.4k gp if you trade in tier 10 emblems for points. One tier 10 emblem, which you can buy from the GE for 2m - 3m, is enough for 500 looting bags (which is enough for roughly 25k cerberus kills!). 
---
Looting Bag Method: The Actual Method
---
The idea behind this method is that you can fill your looting bag and inventory with supplies, suicide them at the boss, then do a real trip with another inventory of supplies. This allows you to triple your trip length. Another big benefit of this method is that you will profit key master teleport drops on average. Unless you get unlucky you should always be getting scrolls at a faster rate than you use them due to the length of these trips. 
---
Here is an example of what to take when you suicide (reminder that you must go to level 1 wilderness to fill the looting bag - also a reminder to SKULL ON THE EMBLEM TRADER BEFORE YOU SUICIDE): https://i.imgur.com/lAprGOx.png
---
pls be zuk
---
Fair point, I just picked that as it's what you can supposedly get at bf shop atm and it's pretty convenient to balance the go/he round. Gp/hr aas my main focus. Its definitely up for debate.
---
Bear in mind that 5k would be at max effort with 99 mining, perhaps even collaborative scouting of the mine for gold piles.
---
Am telling
---
Congrats man! I got a little luckier and got the pet at lv83 rc I'm currently lv91 and hoping to be lv99 rc by Christmas...
---
Sweet looking forward to watching it. Won't be able to untik Tuesday as I'll be away for work. Keep up the good stuff!
---
Pretty sure the blog said its f2p
---
See that? No one cares.
---
Why is the cost of repairing the imbued cape, something which takes only ~10 minutes to get back, and only ~30 minutes to get in the first place, cost 75k to repair when a fire cape, which takes ~45 minutes or longer to get, only costs 50k to repair? 
---
I don’t get the logic with this, it seems quite pricey.
---
Hits a little close to home here....
---
Who?
---
New advertisement board provides an even playing field for anyone who wants to host their house, this cuts into the donations the old hosts got so they're probs pissed about that.
---
The house advertisment board should also have spirit tree and fairy ring
---
Zulrah and vorkath both don't require slayer and are good gp/hr. Stop crying.
---
I did the math and for me, they didn't even increase my max hit, so keep that in mind
---
that's funny, the 2 people with the most macro advertisers that they put at the portal are the ones complaining :thinking:
---
If you and your opponents are equally matched, you have a 1/64 chance of winning 6 fights in a row. Obviously these odds may be a little better if you're an above average PKer. Either way, this is not an easy feat. 
---
You're right that nowadays many players simply buy the Rune pouch with a T10 emblem that costs 2M. But just because you can get four from one T10 emblem doesn't mean they're worth 500k each, because most players only ever buy one. So this is not a good measure of the pouch's value. 
---
If 5 points = 100k, 150 points is equal to 3m which is definitely above what players are used to paying for Rune pouches. I'm happy to reduce this to around 75 (~1.5m worth of loot) which is much closer to what players are used to paying for a rune pouch prior to T10s being tradeable. What do you think?
---
That's exactly it lmao
---
DEY TOOK ERR JERBS
---
Yeah lack of android cases is annoying.
---
"here's the past 19 generations of iphones, and 2 Android.
---
I never did slayer with range. I’m saying the range levels got me into PvM quicker, and after around 100 hours of PvM i made like 800m because of CoX. With that money I got access to max slayer gear and easily available wildy slayer point boosting, so I would get on average 80k slayer xp/hr compared to the average 20-30k I was getting before. That’s 2.5x time saved on slayer, shitton of time saved on ranged training and access to way better gear and more money for even more time saved for buyable skills, bossing, etc. Obviously I’ll be behind on slayer xp by then but I’ll be way ahead in EHP, meaning by the time we reach 99 slayer and 99 range in both cases, my method will be a few dozen hours ahead at least
---
Just a couple of whinny bitches, fuck em both!
---
Its f2p trust its not gonna be a dds, and you can already stack 40s in f2p plus i'd cost alot and you'd usually risk it (most people run out of pray in f2p fights)
---
damn nice meme man redwood shortbow had me thinking for a sec xd
---
That’s awesome I was gifted over 14m yesterday by 2 different people.   Literally just standing in GE random people came and talked to me and gave me stuff without asking.  
---
One gave me 3m and another gave me a bunch of stuff like fury, chaos robes, 5k natures.   I love how generous people are but almost makes me feel bad taking stuff.  
---
I hate beggars but I can see why they do it, people are way more generous it seems.  The thing is I don’t think begging will help because you usually just bother people.  
---
Got a blowpipe in drop party last week also.
---
Skilling is already devalued enough. 5k gold ore/hr is an INSANE amount and methods like this would be are part of the reason more than half of the game's content is dead
---
Could rwt lead to irl problems having to explain to your government how you made thousands of euro's from a couple random deposits? Or transmitting multiple thousands from PayPal to your bank account?
---
Only if it wasn't required for the Diary Cape and completion have a a Diary Pet.
---
Ah the quick chat days.
---
haha thanks brother
---
Ah, ok, similar to the grinder for sandstone. I dont think that stackable is a problem, though. Sure, I could collect enough shards to get 50-99 in one go at the furnace, but I'd still have to mine ot all myself, and with worse exp rates to mining than anywhere else in the game would be. And if the corrupted ore and shards arent tradable, there is no incentive for this to be done by any other account type besides a UIM. And if the problem is that I only need one action for 99, I dont see the problem, as the time to get 99 would be longer at rates balanced for lower exp per hour by doing this method. If smithing wasnt such a useless skill for UIM past mith grapple, I would understand not wanting this, but bf was never great anyways, only click intensive, which still isnt as engaging or time consuming as this would be for the 99. And UIM's dont really need to be worried about in terms of gold sinks, anyways.
---
Me and the bois
---
I've flagged this to the devs thanks!
---
I don't think you understand entirely what making a new engine would entail
---
Im not entirelz sure but I think you can get the previous diary items at Perdu in Edgeville.
---
And no one cares please stop posting these
---
Nice.
---
bf has a strict global limit on the total amount of gold ore/hour since stock is shared between players. (with split between mains and irons)
---
this has effectively no limit on total gold ore / hour, if this gets added the price of gold ore will tank hard. 
---
the quest requirement isnt nearly as hard of a block on bots as you think, and i dont know why you think the rocks falling 'randomly' is any kind of stop on bots who detect objects/entities by their ids not pre-programmed locations
---
This guy is optimistic
---
I do believe his shit was holy, yes.
---
I definitely don't agree with them, I think they're being spoiled brats.
---
You have been banned from r/skyrim
---
spiderbunny!
---
Jagex wouldn't do that to their stock.
---
This would be great.  Would be even better if once completing all the tiers for a specific diary you get that option.  
---
***If*** they ever decided to release master tier diaries it could be a reward from that.
---
Theres thousands bro
---
Oh repostmen!
---
ay, fuck you, buddy!
---
Great.
---
Screaming profanity?? Wtf are you on about you cooked cunt
---
Actually more difficult/expensive tasks. 
---
Instead of smith a Rune Scimitar, it would be Smith a DFS.
---
Dance with a skilling pet
---
Strike General Graador with a BGS spec
---
Quick note: obviously this won't suddenly end botting, but I really think it will help. All of a sudden it will be a \~4-5mil investment per bot. While we love to shit on Jamflex, I'm sure their bot detection picks up like 90% of bots before they could make back that investment, so people will slow down with the bots.
---
F2P is fucked though. Bot swarms incoming.
---
The fact you need stamina potions for the pool limits the utility of this.
---
&gt; Did anyone who didnt look it up ever realise or care that magic defense was already different in pvp?
---
Do you mean player effective magic defence level calculation v monster effective magic defence level calculation? Thats not really a pvp-only mechanic.
---
Soul wars lolz
---
Probably be around 92-95 slayer if you aren’t cannoning
---
I'm glad you like them! It's true that while people want different things from the streams, it'll be hard to find a balance that pleases everyone. I'm open to feedback though and will do my best.
---
&gt; Relax cunt
---
&gt; Fucken yanks

&gt; you cooked cunt

I asked around at the essence mind and some dude said it wanders for a lil bit and you can pick it up. Idk tho

This sub is mostly an amalgamation of the memes on /r/all with osrs nouns

😭🔥👌BRUH SAAMEEE 👌😭🔥👌😭🔥👌😭🔥👌😭😭👌😭👌👌😭👌😭👌😭👌😭
---
This this this.
---
It blows me away that this has been disregarded this far into the process. People were saying this when they first mentioned their plans for this change but they won't listen.
---
Adjusting the weighting in any direction buffs some builds and nerfs others. What we need is more magic accuracy across all account builds, such as a modifier after the existing calculation is done.
---
Blowpipe is still best at Sire.
---
This, it always comes off as super obnoxious to flood some other post with references that not many people are going to get, and even less are going to find funny
---
It also indirectly buffs magic defence for mains because you can raise your effective defence level much higher than your effective magic level.

They did nerf it but it averages out. If you look at the wiki you will notice it seems quite complex and but its pretty simple once you realise what is going on. If you want to see which tier each contract is you can see it on [Guildmaster Jane's wiki page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Guildmaster_Jane#Farming_contracts). It's pretty OP for the reasons I said above, 2m for an 1 hour of active work is a bit of gp (again understating how much you will actually make.)
---
I am an Ironman and at no point do you want to stop doing it as it is one of the easiest ways to get herbs seeds.
---
Alch yourself. I'm not gonna do it for you cuz I'd be losing money, you're worth less than a nat
---
not just spam bots, but their thanks for the tip messages, are alwasy the same never any typos, like the betting bots at ge. im 90% aful and xgrace are botting the the donation trades then just saying hey every now and then
---
Anyone willing to help?
---
Didn't think of that. But still, in most slayer tasks at lower levels, you benefit from the higher defense as it saves you bank trips. In nzm, if you're using overloads, it might not make a difference.
---
0 chance making cannonballs is efficient for any stage of Ironman. I'm pretty sure they get them from corp drops.
---
They described a boss that wasn't solo-able. How do you figure that.
---
Why?
---
Even worse, it will calculate one way for mobs in wildy and another for PvP, even if you're in the same wildy
---
Care to explain how this helps bots?
---
Blowpipe is better I believe
---
I made an Ironman because it's fun to be self-sufficient. You can't just get 30k from whatever and buy a glory - you have to work hard training hunter or crafting. You can't just sit at sand crabs til 70 attack and save up to buy a whip - you have to put in the time to get 85 slayer, then *more* time to get the drop. I did not make an Ironman because of the challenge of devoting myself to hours and hours of hopping at stores like the Blast Furnace ore shop.
---
Isn't this a pretty similar concept to giant seaweed? Ironmen previously spent absolute ages hopping at charter ships, but now they can farm giant seaweed and therefore have a more conventional gameplay method of gathering materials for glassblowing.
---
I also don't see how this sort of update makes it play "just like a main before the grand exchange." Isn't shop hopping a good bit closer to that than relatively conventional skilling?
---
I moved over to vene after this, and you're 100% right. Got about 45 kills without getting pk'd once
---
U
---
Imo, pressing issues is unclear mechanics (pvp vs pve mechanics), clan management, and reviving dead content
---
but none of these are really _that_ pressing and I'm honestly having a good time
---
Only thing I want to add is that Ring of Charos should give a small discount when purifiying gold, much like how currently gives a discount to banking the gold ore.
---
Last financial statement was £67m in total membership and £25m in total MTX. On the face of it, looks like they make more from Osrs imo but since they have so much RS3 staff it must be other way around.
---
I like to use this calculator :)  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs) 
---
All herbs are high enough demand that they're worth farming. Based on that calc, at mid levels, it does seem like toadflax and/or avantoes are probably your best bet.
---
So you're saying we are 65% xp waste... disgraceful will have to fix that.
---
Hey, if I only did one clue a year then I wouldn’t need the boat, but I have done far too many to count. Let’s say one minute per run there. On average every 4 med clues, is a Crandor step. Med clues are 3-5 steps, so 4 steps average.  For every 16 med steps is 1 Crandor. 2588 med clues I’ve done, x 4, is 10,352 steps, divided by 16, is 647 Crandor steps on average. 1 minute per step, is 10.8 hours just running to Crandor. To put into perspective, that’s a lot of time just running. So ya it’s only a minute doesn’t seem like much to you, but in the long run it’s more than you think.
---
Because it’s only useful in TOB since it’s too expensive to use anywhere else
---
Being able to check ge prices in a second isn't qol?
---
Being able to see how many times you have to do something to level up a skill isn't qol?
---
Being able to see an items weigth and stats by hovering over it isn't qol?
---
The list goes on, i would definetely stop paying for membership if they banned runelite.
---
I imagine MSB with rune or amethyst arrows is a decent alternative to BP, even if its definitely less xp/hr. Pro-tip, use the magic shortbow imbue scroll from BH store to give it an accuracy bonus and reduce the spec cost :)
---
You can't buy lamps in osrs
---
Funnily 2nd phase is as hard as 1st one, but with different abilities. 3rd is the only hardest because he uses everything - 4th (head phase) is the easiest in my opinion.
---
I'm just getting back into the game with a friend after several years. Is the official wiki a good place to start for money making to make sure we can supply ourselves with bonds? Also, I used to use the Zybez client way back when. I've seen a couple newer ones mentioned, which one should I use?
---
Probably going to knock out MM2 now. Then maybe get on some Pest Control.
---
Love the Prif mines. Never see bots in there due to the reqs, so you're usually just competing with 1 or 2 other people at a time, which isn't really a big deal at all due to the amount of worlds. 10/10 would mine again.
---
Yeah I'm in this boat..why would you have flex armor be bis. We already have a fucked system of ranger boots/pegasians being bis.
---
Do we really want MORE items like that where it's just gatekept by gp or do we want accessible gear that you work for to get? I'm all for more quest locked items and less pay2win.
---
Pickin' up yer arrows ain't much, but its honest work
---
I actually really like it for the defender, I have multiple defenders so having the one trimmed keeps me from accidentally withdrawing all of them since they're seperate stacks
---
Locking in favor isn’t a thing anymore.
---
From experience
---
And that point I'm guessing was that I was overreacting, but I was just surprised dude. I didn't say it was wrong, or that Jagex should cut it out and focus on other shit, I was just remarking on it and you called it a "tantrum". Like you said, pvp hasn't gotten a ton of focus and now it got a bunch of posts in a row all at once. 
---
For all you knew based on my comment I could have been a PKer myself and just been surprised we got so many updates in a row.
---
It's almost as if people play games for the aspect they enjoy :o
---
Yes yes and yes
---
I like everything about this other than the 10K exp/hour. If it’s not an afk activity, which it doesn’t sound like it is, it should be at least like 25-30k an hour imo
---
Just made the meme for fun, and I've done plenty of raids. Actually all with WDR :)
---
Only reason I came to osrs was poh.
---
You can't pick it up, but skilling pets replace resources in your backpack if you manage to get it on your last fish/log or whatever
---
Timezones are a thing that exist
---
I think some DPS calculator needs checking
---
I know its a joke, but you can always have an opinion on the game even though someone at your stage in the game rarely understands enough to have a valid one. Enjoy your new unlock they’ll be with you forever!
---
Mfw babyrage.
---
OK that would cause a steady and slow decline much like bcp or tassets, they scythe has crashed 30% in like 2 weeks, that is an insane fall
---
Another way of doing this would be keeping the shards concept, but they instead are stackable. So they are given shards that dont turn into gold bars at the BF but are still worth the same xp.
---
Yea an auto typer sure is a lot of work... Oh no! I'm not welcome in your house? Good thing this update allows me to find other houses instead of being spammed about yours
---
RS needs cryptocurrency, call it Zammycoins
---
We can have bots mining Zammycoins to RWT for gp

Had a memory on it a few days ago.

Yeah haha quality reference from no where
---
... I am already so rich that I have no need for such peasantry. This is the utmost reason for why inheriting higher intelligence than the average person is a drawback of mine — you will never understand.
---
You’re just lucky I decide to use my brains on this game -to help out players- instead of using it for a highly-valued career (that I’ve been offered before).
---
Lol and what. U walk out with spears and staffs?
---
Just add this as a new quest with a 60 farming, 60 Slayer, and 60 Agility requirements. Add some old quests as reqs and some other skills for flavor.
---
I've trained pray in aful's house many times. Insane money. I saw him thank a few people for a total of like 5m in tips in about 5 min

Lol get fucked.

Ban the auto typers while they're at it, too.

Xgrace even spams his twitch stream. I'm excited at the prospect of these people potentially making less than they did.

What a bunch of fucking babies lmao

and wc

I didnt say its not bad. Dont attack me because Jagex doesn’t care, mate. Take that issue up with them.
---
'Her' on both counts

Please use your big brain to see that your time has passed. It's time for you to move on.
---
I just went to check out the board xgrace is there hosting rn
---
Nah cause def is less cmb than magic. For extreme examples 99 def 10hp is 28 cmb. I think 28 cmb 52 magic is 28 cmb. Increasing def first is more efficient for magic def

no those will be splits

5k gold ore per hour is a massive nerf from bf

I remember being in a Castle Wars game with Mod Ronan and that dude was spawning in multiple King Black Dragons lmao

You can bot anything.  People bot Zulrah which is way harder to write scripts for than this golden shower idea.  
---
With the shops, there is a limited amount of gold entering the economy per hour.  With this idea, there's not really a limit.

That would mean no running ať BF - too easy. Also its just plain stupid idea - destroying gold GOLD!! You first need to think of some integrity rather than xp rates.

I have an IRL friend that has almost quit the game (seen him online like 4 times for short periods in about 3 months).

 If I ask for his DHCB (~110m gp) so I can kill Vork faster while I save for my own crossbow, could I get in trouble for receiving that much money in a trade?

And if not, and then I trade him his crossbow back, would I get in trouble then?

More changes for PvP only eh? This is why I don’t go into the wilderness. How the fuck are people who don’t PK supposed to know what’s different when they step into the wilderness? Why does this have to be so god damn complicated? Is there a centralized location explaining this shit?
---
How are new players supposed to know that X piece of gear works differently in the wilderness?
---
How are new players introduced to the mechanic of teleports not working when you get deeper into the wilderness? When they get smacked for their gear?
---
How are new players supposed to know that item Y will drop as cash at an arbitrary wilderness level?
---
As far as I can remember the game only tells you that other players can attack you in the wilderness. Having all these special rules that only the dedicated players know is bad for expanding the player base.
---
Yes, good luck finding a house with an owner as intelligent as I am — there’s a reason my house was highly-valued, my strategic planning.

&gt;The fact that in PvP, wearing dhide top and bottom, which costs ~15k, causes someone in ~~full maxed magic gear, ancestrals, kodai, etc,~~ **salad robes and an ancient staff** to splash magic attacks a majority of the time **against a 99def 99mage mains praying augury**

Gambling laws in the US are MUCH stricter than in the EU or UK.
---
91.5% of the community polled for this change. Unfortunately it will not be going away. All houses are technically free of charge...
---
F2P quests off the bat is a good way to start. Training your combats to about 40 isn’t bad and won’t take long. I believe if you have your combat skills to about 40, you can finish Dragon Slayer which is the final and hardest F2P quest. 
---
(Even tho none of the F2P quests will be too hard to handle)
---
r/nocontext
---
F2P casual only + 1 map only. 
---
P2P casual and competitive + variety of maps. (city map like varrock- swamp map like morytania- desert map like pollnivneach/nardah- jungle map like shilo village- wild map like lava maze) 
---
Weapons seem balanced to me though. Also I don’t mind playing the same map but I agree it would be cool to have more.
---
Hey! This is great, as if you want to efficiently progress your account, some sort of an ideal road map is always great. One of the first questions I have though is are you an Ironman? I will assume you’re not if you’re new to OldSchool, and I will go ahead and move forward from here.
---
One of the first things I would recommend (assuming you’re a member) is to do the Waterfall quest. It has no level requirements and is an easy way to get to level 30 attack and strength, assuming they were both level 1 at the start, which will put you at 22 combat.
---
From there I would recommend a series of questing, which there is an ideal order of completion to make it easier on the player.
---
Personally I did my research on the quests beforehand and progressed my account to meet the minimum skill requirements for a Quest Cape.
---
That’s the best beginners advice I can give you.
---
And what's wrong with that? Let people play the game how they want to. If these people want to play the game and make money by hosting and through donations then who are we to judge. 
---
We should be applauding alternative ways to play the game. Not make fun of them.
---
And before anyone says anything, these guys are being entitled shitheads for boycotting this update. But that doesn't change the fact that their *way of playing the game* isn't inherently harmful to anyone and shouldn't be mocked.
---
Have fun alienating your friends by being a compulsive liar and then acting like a little bitch about it
---
Pls don't kill this game. Nothing is going to change the state pvp. There is no way to balance out the huge skill gap between casuals and regs.
---
I see new meme template potential
---
Well there wouldnt be a problem if the shop was never introduced at all. If ppl had to rely on other sources from the start.
---
Insane! Gz
---
When?
---
That's sick, I played a private server once where after a while they spawned a kbd under varrock west Bank for easy kills and fuckin with noobs
---
How can i find more of this meme, i love it
---
Fucking hobbits. get back to the shire.
---
Jagex bad.
---
Jagex has only a spend limit of 5k$/month to prevent fraud.
---
Jagex aggresive/false advertising of gambling (treasure hunter etc)

Jagex gives no fucks about the mental condition of the players when it comes to gambling.
---
Jagex reply: we care about people look we donate money to charity.
---
Different internet connections probably,  I have to do the authenticator more frequently because I play on my wifi at home and on LTE when I am at work or in public.
---
Awesome, really cool suggestion! 
---
Things I like: 
---
* Makes use of a pretty dead piece of content (Dondaken's mine) that's tied to a quest. That's great. 
---
* Makes obtaining a supply of Gold to train Smithing involve Mining. Improvements to Mining make me happy. This is better than "go kill Gargoyles for noted gold" or "go to Motherlode and hope for a lot of gold" or just standing around the crafting guild going insane. 
---
* Feels Oldschool to me; probably because it's leveraging existing content. 
---
* Gets rid of something Bots love (Blast furnace ore shop).
---
Things I don't like: 
---
* Smithing meta remains based around mass-smelting Gold Ore into Gold Bars with goldsmith gauntlets. This is a minor personal gripe but it annoys me that the Smithing skill seems to revolve around "quest for XP" below 40 and "smelt gold" past it straight to 99, with the skill being relatively worthless compared to other skills.
---
Fucking Bilbo just can't stop staking

there is literally a setting that has auto type on old school runescape...

It’s crazy how you’ll reiterate the same thing and change the wording and think that’s somehow a response to what I said.

If I shouldn’t care about how he acts because “who cares” then you shouldn’t say anything when I call him fake because “who cares”.

You’re just applying a double standard here.

If I wanna call him fake then why do you care?

Your username fits you so well!
---
Although I know it’s not true, I hope every single not farm is based in the US and everyone running them doesn’t claim a cent of that income. None of us should be taxed. Good on them for avoiding!!
---
u/Mod_Curse your thoughts please?? The boats preferred by community.
---
ridiculous argument.
---
At this point the only thing keeping me going is all the other dragon defender horror stories out there lol
---
I suppose they do, the IRS doesn't see is as illegal activity so you can just declare the income.
---
Deal
---
That is of course true. The most effecient way is to use piety and overheads. That is either quite expensive or intensive, but obby legs would give you an advantage there. I think for most people though, the 1 strength bonus isn't enough to warrant the loss in defensive stats
---
What the fuck is this
---
Inflation
---
Its a game bro. They want to put them into the game then balance later.
---
This scene is funny as fuck, lmao
---
I remember the good old days when we held people responsible for their actions.
---
This is awesome - thanks a lot. I've saved this for discussion with the team.
---
I've been to aful's house for hours on end and dude holds up a conversation. But I agree they should not be salty...
---
Yes, they're supposed to be in mirrored positions (e.g. both out on the balcony at the same time.)
---
Dude, get rid of the fence between the main square and the ornate pool, it's far from efficient.
---
I have gotten my account stolen about 4 times thanks to recovery. Last time i recovered it back it was perm banned with 94 def on my pure acc so i quit created a new account after a year linked to a new ridiculous long email and never happened again. I dont even get phishing emails which is nice.
---
But the thing is i am still very angry at jamflex for giving out my account to strangers with little to no information. Jamflex doesnt have bad account Security jamflex literally hacks you.

850 doesnt equal 1,000..

I can't believe that idiot didn't know how to make his boot loot simple items without it getting lured. In the end, he ended up removing the whole thing instead of fixing it. Goes to show you how any noob can make a script. 
---
He was even happy about it when he got featured. There are such better ways he could have done it without alarming everyone, but he didn't.
---
Exactly. If you pay your taxes the IRS won’t shut down your beloved RS account or snitch on you to Jagex.

I don’t know why you got downvoted for this... 
---
Is the xp still faster than osrs?
---
Is there no MTX?
---
Also yes
---
You shouldn't spread misinformation like this. New information is acquired, sure, but the odds of it being mage vs range is exactly 50/50 still. All that has happened is that you go from mage being correct 1 out of 3 times to mage being correct 1 out of 2 times, with range faring no differently. Monty hall is different, there's a reason it's used as an example of nonintuitive probability
---
You can say that depends.
---
If they have a paypall then yeah they do but then you have the once that sell with bitcoin and shit i'm assuming those don't.

The game has been out for 15 years at this point. Power creep and new content pushed it there. RS3 is way more focused on endgame content.

You can try tweeting mod weath. It may be better.

On second thought, let us not go to Camelot. 'Tis a silly place.

In their defense they have a small team so of course some things are gonna slip through the cracks. But yeah, this seems like an easy catch

You don't see items that are alreafy on the ground prior to logging in. Your dc counted as a log out so your own items weren't viable when you logged back in. Sorry man, unfortunate. I feel like if it's your own stuff you should be able to see it when you log in to prevent this issue.
---
It's a hard seltzer, not a beer 😉
---
Came to say this, imagine thinking you should be consulted for any change in the game lmfao
---
stock up on gold weo
---
By gawd!! the potential is limitless
---
&gt;The amount of Agility experience received from shortcuts within Kruk's Dungeon has been reduced.
---
So instead of just banning overpowered clients they just patch the stuff they do.

I can see why they did it, I just wish they did more.

everyone who has a scythe also uses it at CoX, but besides that it's not too useful since it's heavy cost, unless you're a pethunter

Low-class smoker, smh.

Parliament doesnt care about the duel arena. Its rs3. 
---
Rs3 is predatory because they have an in game popup that you cant disable and reappears everytime you log in. It also is avoiding lootbox laws because they claim its not a lootbox. 
---
The issue at hand is if addicting games with these types of mtx should be available to children ( because they cant control their addiction).

looked at your post history and you sound as fucking entitled and arrogant as this message portrays it to be.

I lost mine from some weird old dude with a beard in Morytania
---
melee risks serp, tort (18m) 
---
ranger risks anguish, 3a coif, 3a vambraces (30m)
---
mage isn't even risking anything unless he's wearing a 3a amulet. 
---
to be honest this isn't even that risky given there are 3 of you and chaos ele is super dead. The only way you're gonna get caught is if someone doing a clue happens across you and then calls a clan. Just do this at night (4-6am est) and the odds of it are extremely slim.
---
The guy who tries to shut down content creators inspired by his potential ideas?
---
Yeah and I was extremely disappointed about it. Unacceptable.
---
yea. i've given up a few times. i just gave it a bond now i'm at 51. nearly done
---
Don’t spoil Rick and Morty season 4!!!
---
asking the real questions lmao
---
As an iron, I dislike shopscape. Good idea.
---
I lost mine downstairs in varrock West Bank. I ain't proud to admit that it wasn't free
---
This is a really interesting and well thought out idea and if balanced correctly something that I think would fit very well in the game. One thing though is that the primary hurdle for bots is going to be the questing. Most of the things that would add some complexity for actual players would be trivial for bots to do. i.e. If a tainted gold pile despawns and respawns somewhere else a bot will register the id of the gold pile and move accordingly whereas an actual player would have to spend time scouting out the new pile.  I don't know what the balance would be, but there does need to be consideration for what is doable for a bot v a hinderance for a player. That being said, this would definitely sharply decrease the bots and gold ore coming into the game currently.
---
One last thing, as an iron, this would likely be more effort than buying gold ore from the shop so I think it should be comprable to whatever the maximum efficiency is for buying gold ores from shops without tick manipulation methods and higher if you chose to use those.
---
MPs in the UK has suggested banning lootboxes, MTX in RS3 and Runescape as a whole may fall under that category - Which will lead to Jagex being forced to block RS in the UK or withdraw MTX from the game. Some good stuff.
---
He wouldn't make money if people wouldn't give him anything
---
That's how I imagine what a Bandos helm would look like tbh.
---
I think the point is, why doesn't normal high alching work that way?
---
Tbow is "op" (appropriately powerful imo cause even if it is strong, it is inaccurate) at only a handful of bosses and a few events at raids. It costs a bil, not many are in the game. 
---
Blowpipe costs less than a bond and has far more uses
---
Got mine on my second kill, not even an iron btw
---

---

---
Op, I'm sorry you're the way that you are
---
I don't unless I'm going for a third kill on a trip. Since I got rigour, I can pretty consistently get two kill trips even if the bgs doesn't hit well, unless I'm just getting absolutely shredded by ranged attacks or fuck up on the acid phase or something like that.
---
To be fair freezing through mage isnt always successful using a zgs is usually a good option

---
I lost mine in Fred the Farmer's sheep field.
---
Okay let me put it in simple terms.
---
If Jagex didn't care about autotypers then they wouldn't have made an option for them to be ignored by clients. Macro autotypers take away the "balance" that Jagex have decided the autotypers should have; therefore being imbalanced and allowing advantages a player wouldn't normally have without the use of a macro.
---
bro they banned the kinder reggs
---
This was already addressed

Totally, UIM is supposed to be tough, but why would there be a storage chest for the Gauntlet minigame, but not Rogues' Den when they both have the same requirement to start?
---
Playing any form of runescape with trading allowed has zero integrity.
---
Quests.
---
Aim for 99 in every skill. Then you can play the game.
---
The hard part about doing the caves in guthans is when you get to the magic users and Jad. To be frank, I'm not very knowledgeable on the method because every guide I see says to just do ranged.  
---
75+ ranged is recommended because blowpipe is op.  There is also a method with Karils crossbow, rune crossbow, and crystal bow.  You could also raise your  prayer level too as that would give you a little buffer from having to constantly pot.  Other than that I would look at a guide, there is hundreds of them that also show what your inventory should look like. It will take a few times but it is rewarding.  Also, since it is a safe activity, you could raise your melee stats to 80 i think and try it.  The learning curve is harder though, but you won't have to level range.
---
If you realllllly want a skilling method, Fishing may be better gp.  You usually need a high fishing level though for eels, sharks or karambwan (karambwans have a hard requirement of fairy rings for banking).  The highest gp/hr non combat methods are rc'ing, thieving master farmers, and mining runite ore by hopping I think. All have high requirements and will burn your love for the game.  
---
If you're going for gear upgrade money or for supplies, skilling methods are generally going to take you longer and I'd recommend going for slayer.  Premium gear is in the millions and youll probably spend a couple weeks grinding out skill until it even gets you consistent returns.
---
As an aside, I went to the wiki for ideas.  Processing dragonhides into tanned dragonhides might be good money if you have money to invest.  Wiki puts tanning green d'hide around 600k/hr. And that is a lot higher than fishing or woodcutting will be able to get you with no skill requirements. Just check prices first if you want to do that and make sure the margins are wide enough.

Sorry for the wall of text!

U/seattle2021nhl afuls apparent reddit username he is posting from below forms a picture of a young man with some serious problems. Realise it's funny for everyone to mock this guy but holy crap he might really snap.

This guy's still around?

Same. Thanking the hosts and moving on does suffice.
---
How do you have 62 slayer without any combat stats?
---
Not skulled! not cool
---
Are you incapable of reading? I never claimed they weren’t bad. I hate people using them. All I pointed out was that Jagex doesn’t care. They don’t ban people for using them. Ever.

Look at achievement diary and attempt to do all of the medium diary’s, it will give you plenty of goals to achieve and unlock many helpful things along the way

Money hungry hoest
---
Idk if mithril ore is profitable enough for shop bots so i'm not entirely sure if it is safe to leave it as it is tbh.
---
Kingdom still time gated, shop hopping like gold is really quick. I liked the gold idea you put up so if there was something similar for coal that'd be cool, too.
---
This is a good point. The only reason this suggestion is good is because it accepts that the meta for smithing is gold ore.
---
If jagex agrees that smithing training is supposed to be mainly smelting gold ore, then sure this is a great suggestion! But first explore other avenues like actually changing the training meta to something else (minigame, Skilling boss, new ores, stealing creation, etc....)
---
Owch lol I'm on kc 59 with no bucket nd getting annoyed feel for you lol

Huh I thought OSRS has been pretty steadily successful since launch? When and why was there trouble
---
Xgrace and Aful used autotyper bots in order to advertise their houses in the past. This has earned them a dirty profit via their in-house donation jars, which goes into the bot ownerss' pockets. Basically, they profited from bots, and it wouldn't be farfetched to say they probably sold their gold. The only thing these chucklefucks are entitled to is a permanent ban for supporting the use of bots.
---
I would like to make my house available for anyone who needs it. But I’m not sure what hosting entails

Do I have to be home? Can anyone enter my house? Will I get a notification if someone is at my house and I try to log out?

Baby gonna cry? Waaaaas
---
This is my subjective list, as I'm not using strict metrics like EHP or Gp requirements, but rather blending in everything together and assuming this is from the standpoint of an average player. The criteria I'm considering are **time required**, **knowledge required**, **AFKness** and **cost**. Furthermore, I consider some capes to be on relatively equal terms, so I'll create 'tiers' rather than regular rankings. Tier 1 is easiest, Tier 6 is hardest.
---
**Tier 1:** Cooking, Fletching, Farming, Firemaking, Melee combat (Attack, Strength, Defence, HP)
---
**Tier 2:** Woodcutting, Smithing, Hunter, Thieving, Crafting, Magic, Ranged
---
**Tier 3:** Fishing, Herblore, Construction, Mining, Prayer, Quest point
---
**Tier 4:** Agility, Runecraft, Music
---
**Tier 5:** Slayer, Diary, Music (t)
---
**Tier 6:** Max cape (technically considered a skillcape)
---
Actually it would be a kinda good way to revive the morytania abandoned mine.
---
And GL to any bots tryna get by that ghosty dude in that quest XD
---
Ok this was actually hilarious.
---
GP staked can be no more than 10K either way of what the other player is staking though.

They are engaging in a childish tantrum because they fear a monopoly they never should have had ( and one they held through shady methods at best ) is being taken away from them.

Nobody legitimately plays the hours that they consistently put up on a weekly basis - there should be no reward for circumventing the way OSRS is meant to be played so as to benefit from standing in your POH ( I mean really, do you think that the same individual is there, all those hours, paying attention / playing the game?)
---
It seems the new update is to create a level playing field, and one where individuals cannot monopolize afking for donation profit.

This, just like motherloade mine (where I got 99) and wintertodt, are ultimately none OS additions that let people think they're still playing the same game that we used to.

you should suggest this feature on their github issues page; they may ignore it, but it'd bring attention to the idea and that there's demand

Compete the quest so you will no longer have a need for a pigeon cage. That way this will never happen again to you.

That doesn't really matter when you can make bots automatically and bot quests
---
I think you’re misunderstanding, here’s the rundown of how it works: buy one inv of mithril ore, place on belt, but two inv of coal and place on belt, hop to blast furnace world, take to anvil, make plate bodies, alch. 
---
I’ve done this a lot and have never seen any ore but gold at 0 in the shop, apart from another btw buying coal occasionally. Which leads me to believe gold is the only thing bots buy. 
---
This method is extremely inefficient for anyone that is not a uim so I highly doubt a significant amount of bots do it which is why I don’t think it’s fair to make every ore drop to 10
---
Lucky man
---
I completely agree. Why should Jagex spend developer time working on something that the community has effectively solved?
---
There's virtually no chance that Jagex could ever realistically create a better client than what is already offered by third parties.
---
Oh, I didn't realise loot boxes are being officially classified as gambling. So what I'm getting is that they are going after mtx with chance-based mechanics. 
---
Jagex ~~is~~ could be fucked though because gp does have real-world value, since you can indirectly pay for gp with bonds and TH. But since bonds aren't acquired through chance-based mechanics they won't necessarily be in trouble for the DA since gambling gp isn't directly tied to chance-based mtx. Thank you for that info, I think I understand this whole situation now. :)
---
Im 1750 snd feel safer on non high lvl total worlds. 1500 is probably just a lot of pures but 1750 is maxed mains coming to eat you up

Bruh...take a step back and read the comments you've made over the last few hours.  You're on some other shit right now, and it's not healthy.  You literally threatened to "ban" this sub from using your runescape house (as if you could even possibly know that any given player posts on this sub).  You gotta chill out dude.  We're talking about an update that honestly barely affects you, and the truth is if you were just hosting right now your user-numbers/tips would be essentially the same.  But instead you're freaking out on reddit and standing around outside the house portal for hours...for *what*?  To what end?  Something aint right, and I sincerely hope you figure it out.
---
I don't know what to do with this information.
---
Just businesses trying to make money. I don't see the problem.
---
byeeee
---
I used to be called “AbandonedByGod” when I was an angsty Teen, and only renamed cause Runescape name restrictions
---
Facts.
---
More bots banned = more bots made = more bonds purchased. 
---
Plus, they removed the 7 day trial so now they have to actually buy them again.
---
Classic wow lol
---
And they're saying that doesn't help anything
---
This is a good change. Defence should have more of an impact than it currently does in the combat formula so for those who do train it and get combat levels don't get steamrolled for it.
---
Who gives a fuck what they think.  The whole point of the board is that they no longer matter.  These are the kind of cunts who had bot farms that literally spam reported advertisers for other houses, to get them banned or muted.
---
good riddance.
---
How does it remove it? Only thing changed at BF shop is there will be 5-10 gold ore in stock.
---
Well, we're looking at individual items, here. The Construction cape remains extremely useful on its own, even though the Max cape has all of the same bonuses and more. You could have both the Elder maul and the Obby maul on the list, even though they're both Crush 2h weapons.
---
He went full REEEE. Never go full REEEE

Most of those zulrah "bots" are actually legit goldfarming players(that most likely speak Spanish)

Definitely belongs in the top 10 now that you mention it.
---
Is Iban blast really as good as it seems? I recently hit 82 magic and I checked the wiki for what new spells I could use and.... even though Iban Blast is 30 levels lower than Wind Surge and Ice Blitz it's more damage AND less expensive to cast. What the fuck????? I know runescape isn't known for it's balance but that seems wrong.

It seems really odd to talk of account types having intrinsic value. If an individual enjoys the challenges of a skiller more than those of a main, surely there is more 'point' in them playing as a skiller?

&gt; When an upgraded blessed sword runs out of charges, the sword would be lost as usual, leaving you with the tear and new attachment. It could be later blessed again with another tear.
---
What does it mean by it could be blessed again with another tear? You get the tear back and lose the sword, so shouldn't that say "be made again with a new sword"?
---
Also, wouldn't a Blessed Sara Sword with a Korasi spec be kinda nutty? Does anyone remember the stats of Korasi? I think it was somewhere between D Scim and Whip; probably around Cudgel. The normal SS is probably weaker; at least in attack due to defenders. But the Blessed version is probably about same or stronger than the Korasi.
---
Probably doesn't make too much of a difference since the spec was the crazy part more than the stats and a few stats more or less shouldn't change that, but still questionable. Also, adding an upgrade to an upgrade is a bit eh... Kinda wish they just reworked the Blessed Sword's spec to be more like Korasi since it is already pretty close than adding another upgrade.
---
Not the point I was iterating, my use of English can help OP distinguish between good and bad material to post on this RuneScape subreddit — his post had potential.

I’m simply offering the choice for anyone (I’m extremely welcoming) to join my discord  server so we can formulate and outline meme potential relating to RuneScape, but unfortunately for you, I won’t allow you in for your negativity.
---
There's a discussion about that somewhere else in the post. It seems like it's not profitable for bots to buy mithril ore anyway so there's no need to remove it from the shop.
---
And anyway, UIMs can now use zalcano for noted ores which would be enough for blowpipe ammo.
---
Yeah but, stop spending your money?  
---
It's not their fault you're an addict.

I knew rthere had to be a reason for 5mil+ bonds. There it is, now Bot Farms can't exploit this bug anymore.
---
Yes because regulation for addictive and predatory random “surprise mechanics” is a bad thing. Not like people have genuine mental health issues, gambling problems and having every game chocked full of gambling is bad, right?
---
Fast forward 6 months: some variation of this poll

---
This is a change for the non-IM community mostly, by combating bots to increase the value of Skilling, and help fix the market for gold, which is currently too abundant.

Rather than seeing UIM and reeing like an idiot, try actually thinking for once about the topic, instead of having it being dictated to you by someone else.

---
Out of context quote omegalul. Anyway, this misconception that whales are the reason MTX exists needs to stop.
---
It's not that it makes 99 def more tanky. It's like defence is a stat that can get bigger multipliers than magic so the magic defence stat can meet more results from the same multipliers, just because of the diferent ratio weight.
---
Super deff pots boost 99 to 118
---
In pvp nobody uses imbue hearths or magicp pots, so usual magic level would be just 99, not 108 nor 118.
---
Also bonds are counted as mtx(not making an argument here)in that statement which a decent portion get bought for osrs
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Glad to help :) The interesting thing about it too is that number is basically true for any drop rate. If its a 1/1,000,000 droprate and you get 1,000,000 kills its the same chance. Or if its 1/10 droprate and you do 10 kills, its 65.1%. The bigger the number the closer it gets to 63.2 :D
---
It's actually the other way around
---
The lumped bonds with rs3's mtx
---
Meaning osrs made even more
---
Fuck you. I literally can't read it any other way now. Take your upvote and gtfo of my face.
---
bonds -&gt; sand casino
---
It’s nothing like the mafia, if anything in runescape is close to the mafia it would be pvp clans that run protection services for people in rev caves. Drama doesn’t mean shit to majority of the players that use POHs. Ask someone getting their prayer up if they really care who’s hosting, they probably only care that the host is on point with the burners and that their house doesn’t suck.
---
Do you understand what the word "Untraded" means?
---
Honestly, doesn't come off as a compliment. I agree with the half naked angler.
---
Bonds were counted as mtx
---
Imagine being triggered for what themes people use on their own clients lol

Won't change much considering bots can probably pay for membership after a day or 2 of farming F2P shit

Optimal castle wars often involves waiting for extended periods.
---
Trident family and the blowpipe are really important. The trident family really makes mage usable in bossing and other pvm. Imagine if the best magic dps in the game was fire surge with tome and kodai. You would need 3 slots for rune pouch, kodai, and tome of fire. Trident being a built in spell also made it so you can use other lunar spells while doing magic dps for stuff like pot share or venge. Blowpipe being BIS over t bow for many things sort of speaks for itself, I think.
---
Damn dude that's almost 38
---
Using autotyper on an alt account to let people know you're hosting isnt a "bot" and is needed
---
I’m just saying how it’s not honorable, they do it for the money not the experience. Bullying other hosts until they  stop hosting is not a prime example of honorable behavior man don’t try to defend them.
---
O agree on the pvp clans mafia but find it interesting they they can lock down and area and charge players.
---
Always been a thing and always will because they make good money doing it. Doesn’t matter if you have gear on or not, I just add them to my ignore list and never donate cause they probably aren’t poor
---
If you push the asymetry more than the old design, you will make pures even stronger relative to the "noobie" accounts they're predating on to, because noobies have lower magic than defence.
---
And would make pures tankier against magic.
---
The only problem with a 50-50 parity is that defence can get higher boosts from pots.
---
Yeah I meant to put 36 lul. Idk if characters are supported tho
---
ppl find out through asking how i used to go in
---
Can you not farm toadflax? It’s like 35 farming...
---
Same XP table for RS3 and OSRS, 13m for 99 which makes this even more ridiculous. If the XP rates scaled with the amount of free XP given in RS3 it would be more reasonable but gaining 200k XP in 3 seconds devalues the achievement of leveling imo
---
Yea, but anybody with a high school education could tell you that taking a weighted average of two different numbers and weighing it more towards the larger number would increase the result. Jagex makes some mistakes, but they're not stupid enough to not realize the implications this would have.
---
It also only really applies to maxed mains. There are a lot of popular pvp builds, and many of them have fairly low defence, but almost all of them have at least 94 mage. For any account with less than ~75-80 mage, this is a mage defense nerf, not a buff.
---
They both seem like really shitty people
---
Honestly, you and /u/RUNESCAPEMEME are both right.
---
Those who do predatory business practices are scum, and it is the individuals fault for having a lack of willpower &amp; succumbing to addictions. But you gotta understand, not everyone has a strong will or is able to resist things, even if they know those things are bad for them.
---
Both should be held liable. The person who became addicted, and the scum who guided the person into addiction.

The week trial helped a lot of people get their first bond(which is a looooooot easier in mems)
---
Which us why they waited so long to remove it.
---
I think it should have been replaced with a 2 week $1/$0.50 membership thing. A dollar is nothing for most people but would add up really fast for bot makers.
---
This is what Xbox does and it works very well.
---
Because the biggest question is whether these gaming companies are intentionally designing their games/stores to appeal to young kids spending their parents’ money. Different than regulating how adults spend their money
---
Hence the reason for this update...?

Blowpipe has been added to the list, good point about tridents!

Right, and that's why you wean yourself off of an opiate instead of taking excessive amounts or cutting cold. However you can choose to abuse both prescription painkillers and illicit drugs for the high it gives, and I don't have any sympathy for those individuals.
---
Ah okay, wasn't sure which way it was and couldn't be bothered looking it up.

Here's a few comments I wrote awhile back to help someone:

Rs3 dying means osrs getting mtx. I would choose my words carefully there lad. And why would you even want rs3 to die? There's still tens of thousands of players that enjoy rs3, me included. (tho i play ironmeme cause i hate TH as a consept)
---
Dude I just got 85 construction and built max house setup and it took me less than 10hours,
---
Thousands of hours. O.o

Doesn't remove the necessity if you want any people to actually come to your house.

Who is doing charter ships in 2019?
---
Now that I have full Gold Cwars armor,  I’m fully on board for this.

Ask this in the next Q&amp;A thread and see what they say about it, good suggestion
---
&gt;-His girlfriend "kinda" cheated on him; he didn't do a DNA test on the child because he "trusts her"
---
He can demand a DNA test for 2 years after birth of the child if he signed the papers of him accepting the responsibility as a father from the child.
---
400k-500k per hour, that's plenty to a bot farm.
---
Starving, ignore them. I made a new hcim 3 weeks ago on my phone and the option was gone for me aswell. Idk what's wrong with them
---
I have a pretty strong feeling that 9/10 people using POH's will probably have no idea what that board is, and will just go to the houses being spammed still.
---
How is it a good change? From a pvmer/black chin hunter's point of view maybe, since it makes tanking pkers even easier than it already is, but landing a freeze in pvp is already pretty hard with double hides + augury existing and this change just makes it harder which is literally a complete 180 from their previous direction of nerfing bulwark's mage def and blogging about nerfing black d'hide
---
Fine by me lul
---
Why is it out of context? The article was about Belgium banning MTX..
---
Upvote
---
Man I just looked at afuls post history and he used the same copypasta like 10 times and failed every time. Poor guy
---
Your going to get banned from his house keep it down lol. It has to either be a joke or a 11 year old kid though there is know way anyone is this bad.
---
I'm glad he's crying, the other day I was in his house and someone told him his bot had cut off his name when advertising. He then berates this guy saying he's the biggest player in rimmy and he doesn't need to advertise. He's got a shitty attitude
---
isnt msb (i) untradeable
---
Yeah saw it the other day, what the fuck was with parking yesterday made me late 😂
---
What's the best way for crafting if not ships? I haven't started that grind yet because I'm dreading it.
---
Barrage has bad dps, I wouldn't worry about that
---
which is the reason they try to do as little buffing as possible. What severe xp buffs were added btw?
---
No one here has mentioned relieving the addict of any blame
---
2338 kc no hilt here but I did get the pet
---
You're correct. I was countering in your defense. The guy above me was like "why make it shards instead of noted ore" and you responded "idk" so I posted one reason why shards might be necessary
---
Crafting, Herb, Smithing, and probably Construction are probably the biggest ones if you're not cheesing it. Not to mention Smithing being entirely useless outside of ammo or alchemy. 
---
On the other side, farming and hunter are an absolute joke to train in OSRS, with birdhouses and the farming guild.
---
Yeah I think that's the best with bone crusher and dragon bone necklace. Free prayer points right there. And they drop prayer potions as well so you can stay there forever
---
How much of a virgin do you have to be to complain about "not being consulted before this update". Good riddance.

Alcoholics Anonymous is grounded in religion and repentance, topics that I am not familiar with, so I am not sure as to how to respond to this, but it would be rather "off" for a church sanctioned program to allow this behavior to happen.

you realize theres a significant number of zulrah bots, even with a very arbitrary 50 slayer req that makes no sense, i can promise there will be more than 28 bots doing this method. not to mention its 28 bots to reach the MAXIMUM possible rate, if you actually go check the bf worlds, no where near that max rate of gold is actually coming from the shop.
---
i get it youre an iron with 90 smithing who wants to not use the shop, but this is a bad suggestion

Mage is really good in the low defense/combat bracket in general

Many of the comments here harshly place the blame on the companies. But in my opinion, it's a majority their blame or even 50/50. They are preying upon your existing, or dormant condition. And when that condition is discovered, rather than feeding it, seek help. You can't blame a company because it did what it set out to do: make money. It's not like they ever said "Hey, we're honest and will never participate in negative practices." And any time a company ever has, the consumer should know well enough.

im thankful they were ignored, just like your opinion is.

Yikes dude Fioricet with Codeine is actually some scary stuff and not something I would want any teenager taking regularly. Trazadone  is also a pretty shit drug to take because there hasn't been many if any long term studies done on it's effectiveness as a sleep aid after a few weeks but it is over prescribed as a sleep aid.
---
ignoring changes like tick manipulation discoveries since they were possible at osrs release, just not known
---
compared to osrs release:
---
slayer is 5x faster 
---
mining is 30% faster 
---
smithing is 2.5x faster
---
hunter is like 40% faster
---
range is like 2x as fast
---
fletching is like 20x faster (darts being viable)
---
fm is 20% faster
---
wc is 25% faster
---
prayer is 2x faster
---
con is 15% faster
---
There’s probably not much of hitler left to fuck at this point.
---
orrrr he let himself die for drama / memes to tell peopl he's back
---
If mods actually take opinions from this type of people when every one else is telling you to ignore them, this game is on the wrong hands, guess thats more reasons to quit since from a long time it has been a chain of bad decisions community wise.
---
I would agree it's unethical if that were taking place, but I would blame the organization who should be protecting the well-being and guiding the recovery of their members if this were being allowed, as it is a very large, highly respected organization with the power to prevent such things.  
---
This is of course if you mean literally handing fliers to patients.  
---
If you simply mean nearby, than that's awful. But also, they are simply preying upon a pre-existing condition. I would argue that a patient attempting recovery is not fair game, but an addict who avoids the problem and recovery processes is fair game.
---
You're misinformed. They **bot** their names outside of the portal because most people filter autochat spam out.
---
I doubt this'll be the end of MTX. If lootboxes start being regulated I think they'll just start directly selling xp.
---
I think I was being professional with what I was saying but yes it’s clear that the reasoning behind their anger is with poor taste.
---
if u cant even get 68 mining how tf did u play the game up to that point? lmfao
---
Yeah but OP is level 3. So someone would have to make a maxxed skiller with a very low combat with the sole purpose of killing these skillers and it obviously wouldn't last that long
---
It's still the fastest xp, followed by giant sea weed.
---
Imagine being 19, taking both of them in tandem, and waking up on a bathroom floor unsure of the time that's passed. All it took for me to stop.

There has always been a toxic group of players who effectively monopolize W330. For the longest time, attempting to advertise your own house without getting "approval" you get mass reported.

It's very common to splash against mains.

Are u dumb or did you forget /s
---
Also worth noting that there would be less of a need to restore after brewing, so tanking would be even easier
---
Literally just watched this music video about ten mins ago, made me chuckle.

You fail to get the point that me not paying to win doesn't prevent others from paying to win, lowering game quality but honestly I'm stupid for expecting valid argument from this shithole community.

We would say the same to the games companies producing addictive products and marketing them to vulnerable people.

"Take accountability for your actions and clean up".

I don't see how you can be so unforgiving to individuals but be so forgiving towards corporations as if they're not just a collection of individuals. 
---
The people that make and market these products show take some accountability and recognise they exploit innate weaknesses in all humans for profit. Profitability isn't and excuse for immorality and responsibility for one's actions works both ways for the harmed and harmer.

What item do you have equipped?
---
This is exactly what I imagine goes on at runefest
---
First, that was in relatively early days, at a time when the "no new skills period" crowd was more popular than it is today.  Second, it really *didn't* fail in the polls much worse relative to Sailing and Warding.  Also, the fundamental idea of artisan has more support than what they actually polled.  Seriously, go back and read the final blog post on Artisan.  The rewards are either entirely worthless or ridiculously OP for the time.  And the entire concept is just confusing outside of the idea that "This is slayer for skilling".  
---
Personally, I'd like to see Artisan revisited.  But it needs to be done in a way that is qualitatively different than just farming contracts for every other skill.  There needs to be more to the gameplay loop than that, because otherwise why not just add contracts to all the other guilds.  And the skill itself needs a reason to exist beyond just assigning skilling tasks.
---
Timeless classic
---
Yeah, I imagine its pretty high.  If you've got \~200 people using your house in an hour (which is an understatement for a lot of the famous hosts), at least a few of them are likely tip you a mil or something. 
---
A few peeps in this thread shared their hosting experience, from what I gather its not consistent but over time it averages to about endgame pvm rates of gp/h if you're well advertized.

There are many links along the chain of security. Obviously, I'm not capable of naming every single one, nor do I have the inclination. Just as I wouldn't be inclined to name every way a murderer could end somebody's life - there's too much there, and at the end of the day it's not my responsibility to educate people. If you want an example of a prolific SMS based attack that doesn't rely on social engineering, look no further than the recent revelation of SIMJacker - an exploit chain that literally allowed attackers to send malware inside of SMS messages, which would then infect the S@TBrowser software present on your phone's modem (totally independent of OS).
---
For most people, the numbers are stored in a variety of databases owned and operated by entities ranging from government institutions, employer records, private investigation firms (which legally purchase your data from the DMV btw). The leakage usually isn't even related to the service it's exploited on (OSRS), and in many cases isn't even the result of a crime.
---
This data collects dust until somebody starts trying to correlate it back to you, or vice-versa. Jagex's own website isn't even particularly secure, as they've had numerous security issues over the years but nobody knows because why on earth would they ever admit it? I'm not saying there've been database leaks or anything, but they've certainly exposed their users to significant risk over the years - especially the ones with Social Media accounts connected in their Jagex account settings.
---
Nah it scales appropriately if you use legacy mode for like 99% of content in the game.
---
Maybe if you are going for boss records or something EoC might be better but for most players it won't impact a thing
---
Able to use it properly? Bro all you do is fucking click and wait

I’m all about adding more drops but this is literally just GP into the game. I would much rather pvp armours or something else other than straight cash.

Back in the day it was all about flexing. The f2p community was a lot larger than the member community as well. So to talk to randoms you often went f2p worlds. Nowadays theres no reason at all to go to f2p other than helping new players out.
---
slayer rate on cml is a bit low post 99 100k/hr is maintainable, at osrs release high lvl slayer was ~18k/hr
---
mining is faster from prospector, dpick, varrock body, mining cape
---
smithing is faster because BF is possible now since they added a bank chest
---
hunter is faster because black chins/6th trap
---
range from black chins / mm2 tunnel
---
fm from redwood logs/pyro
---
wc from 1.5t teaks / crystal axe
---
prayer from superior dragon bones
---
con from mahogany benches vs table
---
Charters are still faster xp than seaweed and sandstone. People just like to bank xp. It's at least 30% faster to do charters.  Rc you have to wait for slayer for the 175k pure was you're going to need. Agility is the same but it doesn't mean it's any less cancer.

I feel you, big guy.

Again refer to Jane's wiki. A med herb contract is tier 3 (for hard it is tier 4), a palm tree is a tier 5 when on a hard contract. If you skip and get a herb (for example you can then do more contracts without having to wait for the trees to grow. The tier system only goes upto 5 and well for the most part it is really easy to get a tier 4 or 5.
---
&gt; the price floor in your suggestion is 150gp
---
At 200gp players would be making 250k/hr at 5k ore/hr, more likely 150k/hr with 3k ore/hr.
---
&gt; but you change the meta
---
Are you talking about shopscape? That's not a controversial opinion. If you are trying to argue for it to stay you are against the vast majority of the playerbase and jmods.

I don’t think you’re disagreeing with me here

How long did it take to get everyone to hold that pose?

They put adverts between children's television shows. They gamify eating at McDonald's every year with the Monopoly promotion. They gamify happy meals by having collectors items which are part of a range. Their arches are perhaps the most omnipresent visual pollution in the entire world.

Last year, they spent the best part of a billion dollars on marketing, a sizeable portion of that going towards marketing towards children.

You can check how long a maple tree has to grow and make a decision on whether or not to wait. If you just planted a maple you generally shouldn't wait but if it is a few growth cycles in you should just wait.
---
I'm not going to argue with you here or try to explain addiction. I just genuinely hope one day you develop some sort of sympathy. If you truly do know the insidious nature of addiction then what you've said is bordering on being sociopathic.
---
I agree,  magic is very fearsome in wildy, but I also want to add that two existing balancing mechanicsms is that bringing mage switches into wildy means less inventory space for food/brews and while casting spells you are vulnerable to ranged and melee attacks. For example when I pk in the deep it's only the tbers and freezers that die.
---
I posted this idea because the community has for a long time expressed that magic splashes too much in pvp. Jagex is currently testing a new weighting between how much magic levels and defence levels count for your magic defence in PvP. I think an amulet similar to what I propose would be a better solution.

Hijacking the top comment to say that this is a terrible suggestion that needlessly harms the Ironman communities for the sake of "reducing shopscape".
---
Irons primarily rely on gold ore for early game smithing training, and the blast furnace shop is the best way for irons to acquire this reagent for smithing training.
---
Dondakan's mine relies on random drops of gold ore for it to work. Multiple players will be able to see these drops so they will be fair game for absolutely everyone.
---
Do you know what this means?
---
The proposed change causes irons to not only have to compete with other irons for gold ore (which is currently the norm), but now we have to also compete with normal players and UIMs for acquiring smithing reagents. Normal players have more options for acquiring smithing reagents that irons do not have access to, and opening an ironman-exclusive (Normal players do not share the same stock as ironmen) efficient method of acquiring early smithing XP is not healthy for the state of the Ironman game mode AT ALL.
---
?? Getting a 300m item IS working to get it lmao. Almost everyone I tob with has 2b+ banks, do ypu think they didn't work for that? Or by "work" do you mean "get the item for free cause I can't be bothered grinding something out"?
---
yeh to a point but once gem is used in ring form cannot b taken out so its a sink either way
---
I used to sell gold to a guy I went to college with for an outrageous rate. Eventually I had to get him to stop but he spent close to $3k usd in one month.
---
I always used aful. Never donated.

Never realised he was such a low tier person.
---
You could say that his behaviour is...
---
Awful 😎
---
damn i didnt know that, thanks

It’s doable with 70-80s but you’re absolutely deadweight and just getting carried by whoever in the group has decent stats and knows what they’re doing. If you want to pick it up with 3-4 brand new friends, around 85 is the minimum in all combat stats save for Prayer.
---
Depends heavily on gear and rooms, too. If you’re avoiding the more difficult rooms and have very solid gear (specifically lance and rigour) you could clear it with everyone hovering around 80.

How about you just....dont use their house if you dont like them? If you want to use their house, tip them for the convenience. If not, just dont use their house. It's simple. Max your own house so you dont have to be a freeloader. The tip jar exists for a reason. Without it, There would be almost no real incentive to host
---
no, the poh is already too OP we dont need anything more in the poh
---
10% is definitely significant, but either way it doesn't really matter for slayer.

Right, more of a suggestion again. Think this would be a cool addition nevertheless. I’d do it either way.

get this scumbag outta here ffs...

If only youd had that luck at vet'ion getting ring of the gods

&gt; you mean bots, thats comparable to mlm bot rates still and theres a lot of mlm bots

I purposefully mine spots next to people just to run them off.  I usually mine a set of three or five (depending on the wall im on) and someone always ruins it.  So, I return the favor until they leave (or I do).  
---
If you're not the same mining level, your inventory fills at different paces and you leave at different intervals to drop your dirt.  Then this makes them come back and say "he has probably already ran that timer down, i'm going on to the next spot" and then everyone is out of whack.  So, I understand the mechanics of it, I just don't like them lol.
---
Like they do in RS3 i assume you mean

On top of what's already been said WoW classic has pulled some people away. In general, bonds are only generated in game when someone buys one irl, so the supply is comparatively rather limited compared to demand.

Idk we do raids has some really toxic community members. A trial raid mentor did nothing but bash an average raider cause he only completed 50 raids. Other members no. Stop shit talk and blame you when they die with a full inventory of brews.

Slayer wasn't mentioned in this comment section but that is true.

Cassius?

Literally nothing? lmao
---
Lol. Every host claims, "I just do it for the fun! :-)" Yet when people start going to others' houses, they make less money and they whine. Cry me a river.
---
Good, because looking at the price difference between msb and the next best bow is ridiculous.

A few days ago after my main ran out of membership, while I was fishing by Barbarian Village (for food as I am afk combat training Stronghold of Security Giant Spiders), someone in full Dragon Armor (including Dragon full helm) stopped by in f2p for a few minutes before leaving.

What do you need done to unlock fossil crabs?

Ideal is skeleton, large spider, bloodworm but it's not worth the spider. Just do double skeleton bloodworm

&gt;  I hate when people on this subreddit insinuate 30 hours a week is an attainable amount of playtime for the average player.
---
Jagex showed playtime stats before, the average player is 30-35 hrs of playtime/week.

88 is max runes I think, try to get it but don't stress too much if you get sightly more than this
---
Affordability shouldn’t just throw out options, it’s not hard to make enough in a weeks time to afford any armor in the game. What you are willing to lose does not change the fact that other options exist.
