Anyone have a non trash clip of this?

Thanks for the update

I just appreciate op using and giving proper recognition to credible news sources like the Varrock Herald
---
Pking in today’s meta requires very set builds unless your going for maxed mains.
---
Use prop swap. if anyone else is advertising better rates they're probably scamming.
---
It’s rule of the subreddit? Either got auto picked up and removed or personally. Either way it’s still against the subreddits rules.
---
Isn't shift dropping also easyscape? Why did it get passed?
---
Thanks!
---
Very nice c: those guitars without headstocks always confuse me.
---
Runelite + and lyzard day your wrong
---
Change my mind:
---

---
If you play the game in a way that you enjoy it, you are getting the most of out of.

Whip pks in RuneScape classic? Weren't whips added in rs2?
---
Haha no worries I do the same thing
---
🦀🦀 Zuk is powerless against Xzact 🦀🦀
---
Stopped playing this game a year ago. Still on the subreddit for posts like this. Love it
---
Well if looked at that post you would see that it went from no mutes to a perm mute, so if I was calling people retards all over the place, then I would of had a temporary for that. I do not think you can even get muted for calling someone a retard.
---
You easily would if you watch YouTube tutorials. It's relatively simple on a main just requires patience and practice
---
Like... Wh.. What?
---
I never had a main in all of my runescape history, plus i want that big challenge being HC plus 1 def and 1 pray, i have to do things much harder and i will keep going until i die. Let’s see how far do i get.
---
He’s been working so hard for this. Truly an incredible PVMer and I’m so glad he finally did it!!
---
This is like comparing red dhide chaps to black dhide chaps, they're just plain better.
---
Metal dragons are generally a shitty task even with decent gear and steel dragons are the worst, it's going to be miserable trying to kill them with a dscim or with 64 magic. I'd either block them altogether or reset your streak at Turael, if your streak isn't too big. If you want to finish the task then just do 1-2 kill trips until the task is done, as 14 isn't that many. Ideally you'd use a hasta for melee but as you're an iron that's obviously not realistic
---
If you're going to mage it at your level you can try iban blast, which is nice because you can guaranteed take 0 damage and makes the kills very afk
---
&gt;auto picked up 
---
lol yea only took hours and until they were on the frontpage for that to happen.
---
just like they remove every other thread about this kind of thing, for "breaking the rules". Except they dont get removed, and the difference is those threads stay local to this sub, not getting big enough to be on /r/All 
---
&gt;defending paid internet janitors lul
---
Ye usually untradebles give a prompt when you try to alch them, also high value items. Woukd suck to accidently alch a whip or something like that. Or indeed an assembler haha.
---
You’ve been given the only available options. Buy membership or drop a lot of shit.
---
Who r u
---
That’s not a viable excuse
---
Depends on how you define "Getting the most out of the game" I personally use Runelite and have no issues with it, but I can totally empathize with anyone that doesn't want a bunch of text or lines all over their game world. Yeah Runelite makes reaching higher levels of efficiency *easier* by nature of its addons, though I'd also argue that those addons have the potential to be extremely immersion-breaking for those who value that and they are largely just tools of convenience.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
tl;dr agreed if your goal is peak efficiency at all costs, not necessarily if it isn't
---
Why would you make suffering first? Genuinely curious
---
Take out the card and put it back in
---
Me three
---
What did you do instead? I’m looking for peak afk methods
---
I don't think "tortured" and ":D" go together that well
---
How do you get whips without priest in peril?
---
Bruh, you cannot make it seem like a clan chat you just happened to stumble upon and then switch it up into a straight up advertisement.
---
A week ago ranarr seed was 38k, today, 33k, the price its crashing, a few bots its normal, but these days its thousands of bots, on all worlds
---
Nice. Get rid of the mystic though. Wear tank armor, barrows brothers have no mage defense so accuracy is pretty useless.
---
you cant say your getting the most out of it until you've tried the best version. I.E. You cant say you hate toast if you've never put anything on it before.
---
sorry bro, I got 35kc vorki on alt going for head l0l
---
What is GP swapping?
---
have you ever played on rune lite?
---
Actual quality of life update. No EZscape. No big change in meta.no impacts on market.... I'd vote yes. Good idea
---
Rendi be like " 48 combat inferno"
---
You realise that lyzard and runelite plus are a better version of the base runelite right?
---
these new art forms are weird
---
blessed dhide, rune cbow, ruby bolts, diamond bolts, barrows gloves, glory, antifire shield, and RoL since I had nothing better lol
---
&gt; he'll be more excited than any of us were playing this game.
---
why are you even playing? I enjoy the fuck out of this game and receiving drops.
---
Also, you are not addressing me saying that OP started shit talking me before I said anything to him. I am assuming you feel that people shit talking someone after they shit talked them is wrong?
---
Personally I used Oakdice. They have a nice website and it's all set up like a business. You might have to wait a while if transferring a very large sum, but they can do it.

Doesn’t the word raw imply they are dead by the time they get into your inventory?

I know we’re asking for a lot but visuals would be sick as fuck

REEEEEEEE
---
The practice of trading wealth between RS versions via. a third party which you give your GP to on one game, they they give you an amount on the other based on current exchange rates.
---
You won't find a more credible source
---
That makes it free.
---
You can still get there by paying 1 000 gp for the trip without the quest.
---
No farseer? Wtf
---
Yeah possibly, but you can still put dead fish back in the water ;)
---
All of them, i used to pickpocket master famer and always saw 1 o 2 bots, sometimes, none, these days its thousand of them
---
ah fuck ah shit i didnt do this achievement in the medieval point and click video game ah fuck my life story has been for nothing ah shit i wanted a plaque
---
Do it for nieve!
---
You replied instantly wtf
---
Wooooow. Guy is surpassed woox imo
---
BROOO it's been a while since I slapped you near edge a few weeks back. Still chattin shit I see LOL.
---
 
---
I get it though, I imagine it's frustrating to still be bad after all that practice.
---
Make a main first so you can sustain a bond, grow into other accounts when you can sustain more than 1 bond. Repeat
---
I have 2.2k with no pet do I get a prize :(
---
And what about Zuk? Idk its not that I think the number of times something has been done necessarily has to reflect the difficulty, but I've watched Lettu do solo tob on stream and I just find this to appear much more difficult. Lettu is really good at pvm tho.
---
I’m guessing you have never done infernal eels then
---
This dude still pays the al kharid toll 🤣😂🤣😂
---
My last 6 slayer tasks have been: Harpie bugs, Steel dragons, harpie bugs, iron dragons, harpie bugs, steel dragons. Wtf? Is this normal or am i cursed? I'm only 73 combat, the irons were alright but that steel dragon task took me like 12-15 minutes per kill (63 mage) and i wanted to neck myself. On the second steels task I blocked it and chaeldar replaced it with 18 cave slimes because apparently she can't decide if I'm a godlike dragonslayer or a lumbridge NPC.
---
This ended up being more of a rant than a question but yeah. Not having a good time doing slayer. When does it get better? Should I grind combat off crabs or something to get better tasks?
---
Thanks homie appreciate it
---
Yeah, I'm gonna be tackling those quests tomorrow so if you don't mind telling me some tips on DS2/MM2 bosses that'd be nice
---
Or lower the position you're character holds it
---
I hope you know how to recompile Java programs.

Haha...topical.
---
This thread is like the epitome of scientific discovery.
---
What are some of the best wuickest ways to make some money. I was thinking of just questing but wasnt sure where to start
---
and for fucking fishing of all skills.
---
Xzact is the first person to get a solo scythe from tob.
---
Look up an optimal questing guide on the [wiki](osrs.wiki.com)
---
Now invest that gp into some screenshot software
---
Rng scares me more, I can never see myself being an Im because of that.
---
Congrats but if all you do is mining thTs not progress people will want to watch

Unlucky but also doing slayer at that low of a combat level is extremely bad for that exact reason. 75 combat for Chaeldar is like the bare minimum that people consider acceptable, even then most people would recommend waiting until 85 for Nieve, and the most efficient players recommend waiting until you have 80+ in all your combat stats so you can deal with all the tasks easily.
---
Not even close
---
Well it is pretty simply, they enjoy one aspect of the game... but not others?
---
epic
---
Cool
---
More to come, after mining! Just gotta stay tuned!:)
---
I love this game, but I'm not gonna just ignore the problems that still haven't been fixed. Jagex and the playerbase both have shown that they like adding alternative methods that automate. One great example being Plank Make.
---
OSRS doesn't have to have every skill just being a "harvest 28 and drop 28" for 200 hours. The brainstorming power of the playerbase and the developers is too great to just leave a beautiful game in the mud like that.
---
What's the point of the gnome shaker drink thing?
---
Can you elaborate more? This sounds like an interesting story.
---
Can you get d boots with no quests? Don’t you need death platue and troll stronghold to go there

Pretty sweet! Refreshing to not see a RC bad repost!
---
75 attack could be a change too although you have a beast acc rn
---
This makes sense, but they might have to patch Barbarian fishing to use all three types in one action.
---
lmfao if you get carpel tunnel afking barb fishing you really should just quit.
---
Tf wrong with u

Most are still there
---
Releasing fish gives back 1/10 the fishing xp for being conservative and caring about the environment

That’s too bad, but I’ve got to start somewhere.. hope you check in again later! :)

You can trap the healers behind Jad  if you lure him properly

Ah yes

you can get them from those, just that I can't do either really (thermy soon though)

lol no

And playin the new DEEJAY KHALEDDDD hell yeah bro

This is adorable
---
insane achievement, shittiest clip ive seen.
---
Yeah I like this suggestion. 
---
As others have stated, it’s a scepter, not a staff. I do agree, though, it looks awkward.
---
Unpredictble came up with the strategy for trapping the healers, but pretty mucb everything else was discovered by xzact
---
 Funny story, this vid is actually the part 2 to what you saw a couple months ago! I just extended it but uploaded both parts on YT https://youtu.be/LWtMfuguOVk
---
It's just a spam comment that adds nothing to the thread. Especially annoying when people post it like 20 minutes after the original comment was posted
---
Unfortunately, so does your comment. People have lives outside of them game, and many people spend a lot of time using computers as their job. I would say I spend about 3-4 hours a day typing, using my computer, and the rest I'm working with my hands. My job alone leaves me vulnerable, tack on playing the game and it's a further increased risk. 
---
This feature being slower than tick dropping brings balance and is only incentivized in one way.

So, if you don't mind answering, what is exactly wrong with the community for suggesting and supporting this?

?

But you can to chop a magic tree, or catch d imps, or craft multiple runes, along with majority of skilling content.

Would have been better if that fire giant killed me

This concept is strong. Dinhs is an odd-ball ingame atm. Expanding apon 2h greatshields would be cool. Especially one for each god.

Reeeeeee post

I like the concept but I don't like the full dmg recoil
---
Well you should do it for free in a perfect world.

For the love of mobile :)

Yep, it did mess quite a few things up, but a decent lawyer was able to get it sorted.
---
Which quest is this?
---
The fact that he just buried all that effort and creativity a little after hour 2 of the video was dank as fuck, but I'm afriad it means far too few people will experience the glory of One Chunk More.
---
&gt; support channels on social media
---
That’s a cute way to say reddit and twitter posts. 
---
There are literally ready made services that they could port to. Cheap. It’s a brash lack of care on Jagexs part (caused by people like you, who say “shoot that’s just the way it is”) that has prevented its implementation. 
---
It does cost them money. They lose out on potential customers because they’re pushed away by the absolutely horrendous customer care.
---
Meanwhile any marginal benefit you receive from skill is lost through the tax anyway
---
Gotcha
---
Yes
---
You are mistaken if you really believe it's a small portion of the game.
---
That amount of gp/hr definitely isn't worth the time you're spending banking it all and then also trading it in. That time would be better used advancing theiving faster by not banking the fur and unlocking better thieving
---
getting the scythe (or pet as someone mentioned) can't really be classed as the same kind of achievement as beating hard content at a low level. I wouldn't even call getting a random drop an achievement because it doesn't take show any more skill than someone who did the same thing but didn't win.  It's a dice roll.
---
Shift click: hold 1 key, then its 1 click to drop.
---
Ahk: press 1 key to right click, press another to move mouse, press one last key to drop
---
one is 1:3 while the other is 1:1.
---
The mods here remove posts all the time
---
No
---
Would have been better with a rune axe. I got asked all the time why I didn't have a dragon axe at woodcutting guild when I was grinding out 99.
---
Dang nice, wish I had heron by 99
---
its only a 1% chance and in full tank gear ur opponent isnt likely to hit that often anyways
---
Thank you

No man thats fine. Just cant have it do more than one action.

You realize right now they're like 100% lenient? I think a couple 1 month bans is enough of a deterrent
---
Nieve til Duradel
---
why not have both options to release only same type of fish or all fish
---
For shift dropping  you also need to move your mouse. For most people ahk would be faster.
---
May as well add an agility course there while we're at it.
---
I have tried karambwan, monkfish, barb, infernal eels and dark crabs for about 1m XP ea method. Dark crabs are amazing, big recommend

PSA- the mobile client has tap to drop mode instead of shift-click. It is really fast and is easy on the wrist. The mobile client is legit, folks.

You would have to join a Skype or discord call for that to happen or they would ddos every player .

excuse me it matches the cape perfectly
---
You’re gutter trash you’ll end up as a miserable failure and a waste of a human being.
---
“Fun and well designed” is so subjective. If it wasn’t fun and well designed then this game wouldn’t have been around for the past 18 years.
---
highly doubt they have ur ip. they’d need access to Jagex’s servers (idk how likely that is) but it’s prolly a scare tactic
---
Read it again dumb fuck
---
Scape boarding.
---
Mine does the same thing, only when I have anti aliasing on though. GPU isn't dying as far as I know, runs other games fine.
---
I forget but barb fish until like 60? Or somewhere around there then barbarian fly fishing by barbarian assault. Is the fastest xp in game
---
Stretching your hands and sitting with good posture: Free
---
Exactly what I did. got the cape and havent known what to do since.
---
No way Josè. I suffered...you suffer. At least you get to do all of it with shift drop....
---
hey fuck u upvote me
---
Actual fun gameplay with scheduled rewards carry bad rotten gameplay like harvest-and-drop grinds. It survived because of the former, and continues to be held back (in small part) by the latter.
---
Wasnt that bad in fact id rather a quest be simple and straight forward  like this and no puzzles .
---
.i mean you should know from the memes and quest guide that its long.

Welcome to old school Runescape
---
I did all kinds of thieving to get that pet... howevery, to not waist time and xp I did Paladins before Hosidius update to get xp and money in the same time .... after the last update I went to Hosidius and I found that there is master farmer inside house NE the centre of the city. ... now I do it for money as priority upon the xp... its like 1m an hour with rogue outfit... I've  got like 17m of him so far...in like 4 days and 6 hours of playing.
---
I see it both ways. From a viewer perspective it's annoying as hell.
---
From the prespective of the person making the video well they do it so people actually see their videos, especially with how YouTube has been with not putting videos into people's sub boxes to flat out even somehow unsubbing people from channels they did not choose to unsub from

Do they drop anything of value? Cause I’m baffled on why they would be bottled tbh.
---
The point of the totem is that you know it’s exact weight and physical consistency though. He’s had the spinning top in his intimate possession for so long that I think it’s entirely reasonable his knowledge of it would be deep enough to be able to discern dreams from reality. Yes it’s not his original totem, but he fiddles with it so much that I don’t think it’s out if the question. 
---
Also the spinning top is a sort of plot device, as it’s characteristic of being able to spin indefinitely in a dream state is a useful way of the viewer being able to see a totem at work. Most totems only feel different, which obviously we can’t see, but the spinning top provides visual evidence. The point being that, of course, eventually it falls over in reality and hence the ‘is it, isn’t it’ scenario at the end of the film. 
---
But yeah, RuneScape is decent
---
That’s like 2 months of playing ironman to get that
---
If it works fine in other games then idk what to tell you. With electronics 1 program out of 1 million could cause some kind of glitch or bug. My pc handles it fine, and idk any other reason that would happen except your pc can't handle it
---
I would suggest Duradel for most exp/h but you can get lucky with Steve. The demonic gorillas on a black daemon task is a change of pace for sure and highly weighted. It may take long but can be very rewarding. Really depends what your goal is my dude
---
Why would anyone do this though?
---
same this same shit posted like 24 hrs ago dude cmon

TIL spam dropping fish is essential to the experience of playing runescape, and if it jeopardizes your health, you shouldn't play!
---
Thanks for the counter arguments though man
---
Yes, you keep untradables
---
Confirmed it, you're right, need to let them know lol
---
Got mine at 109 combat and like 10 yrs overall played
---
Let's just remove the 6hour timer and whatever food you add to the fishing spot, you start fishing. Let me afk fish tuna potatoes for 6 hours with 1 click
---
thats why they have people helping them, and $11 a month isnt a lot, and its cheeper if they vip or have loyalty rates.
---
Damn maybe you should learn to appreciate the things you have.

Hope we get SA servers and you Asian servers friend

Anyone know how to use the Logitech G710+ G keys to assign G1 to = 1 (number 1) and G2 to equal 6 (number 6)?
---
I tried to reassign in the logitech software, but runelite still read it as the F keys being pressed.
---
I haven’t played rs in a while - left it bc I feel like I outgrew it. But I left off at 94 fishing on osrs on my lvl 3 so this might convince me to get 99.

During the quest, you're given a bottle of [snail slime](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blamish_snail_slime) which you then combine with an unfinished harralander potion (25 herb req).

I'd love to give it a shot if you can link the script, sounds like a great project!

I don't start quests, and I cannot level up herblore, is there a way to get it as a drop?

Just delete your account cuz that rng is ~~***C U R S E D***~~

Not that I want the guy banned, but how is that not bug abuse? A monster not meleeing you when it’s supposed too because you clicked an item on the ground sounds a lot closer to a big than an “intended game mechanic”.

whats ur range level

Thanks xD
---
Won't it automatically trim every untrimmed cape you have in your bank every time you get a 99?
---
It’s a benefit to the player if they choose to pay and kill revs in that world with less risk to be pked, you can skull with chain mace or bp and easily make 2-4m per hour. Plus at the end of the day it’s the wilderness so it has nothing to do with people trying to ruin game. They aren’t taking anything away from you that you can easily do on other worlds taking that risk.
---
Ahhh, I smacked this guy too last week. He wasn’t very lippy though!
---
aYes...and what does that stem from?
---
Jagex ignoring PvP and not introducing new content or anything at all. Not fixing things that have needed fixing badly for a long time also plays a big role. 
---
If PvP was actually good, and there was actually things to do in PvP and the mechanics were made better then those of us that are good wont be getting "bored" because its fun. That isnt the case though. The fact of the matter is Jagex drove away A LOT of people by ignoring PvP, im not sure how people could not think that this plays a huge role. Its something that is complained about by nearly every top pker/content creator, PKers getting "bored" and quitting doesnt make sense when you look at how quickly the PvP community has disappeared. Sure people can get bored but, what theyre getting bored of is the same old BS from Jagex and because there is nothing "new" or exciting to do on top of all the issues that need to be fixed.
---
I switched from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone XR after the mobile release. The battery life is great and the large screen helps with osrs. Overall, I’m pretty happy with it.
---
I figured out my own problem. I got a third 99 and didn't drop my skill capes when I leveled. Account ruined.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s an overstatement. There’s a lot of great achievements out there such as no-supply Inferno, no-pillar Inferno, all of Woox’s pvm achievements, GWD records etc. but what sets this achievement apart from most is the fact that this won’t easily be replicated even with the strats/knowledge out there. I’d put solo ToB in contention but I think more people will complete solo ToB over time than the amount of people that will complete sub 50 combat Inferno.
---
They are doing it so they and their clan can benefit from it, not ruin the game. Simple as that
---
There's two located in a house to the east of the town centre. No dogs inside.
---
you just follow the relevant parts in the quest guide basically. Tho I read the comment chain and looks like there is a 25herb req unless you can get it as a drop from lanzig. make a tweet to mod ash and he'll confirm if lanzig drops it or not.
---
I don't make pking accounts, but based on some frequently repeated information, your account is probably not going to be optimal. Your defense is too high for most brackets of pking builds, especially since you do not have the core members quests even started. You need to do specific quests for equipment and unlocks (like mithril gloves and the ancient spellbook), and the experience given by these quests can raise your combat too high if you train some skills too much.
---
Afaik, you'll want most/all of your defense experience to come from a few specific quests, or for your account to not gain experience at all for account builds involving 1-13 defense. You might even be too late for 42 def void build. Your current options on this account would be higher level pking builds such as berserker or piety builds, or even just keep this as your main account.
---
If you're serious about investing the time to get into osrs pking, I'd recommend that you spend time researching any build and follow a guide that'll bring a new account to pk ready.
---
The main problem with quests in this game IMO is the annoyance factor of you missing an item you need for a portion of the quest and having to backtrack to get it. They should really tell you all the items required at the start and what items you need for certain sections like the Wiki does.
---
Most people just hate OSRS quests because they actually make you use your brain and people can't be bothered with that in an MMO so they just look for a guide and it turns into a giant simon says checklist.
---
apparently lanzig does drop it very rarely so I'm smacking him up right now
---
God damn so did I
---
It depends on your woodcutting level. All exp at wintertodt scales by the respective skill's level
---
Yeah but if you want to be accurate in your comparison then youd have to compare it to someone soloing ToB on a low level account. Maybe solo ToB is more difficult thna inferno on a main with tbow/ely etc. but its not more difficult than doing inferno on a level 50. Its like if a level 100 or lower solod ToB.
---
Yes hi its the guy in the pic. I hear you have my back
---
Always have a spotter and never skate these top of spots alone, you will get fucked up
---
I've also gotten 10k Snape grass from 61-83, which is 820k farming xp and about 1/3 of my total farming xp. 
---
Don't forget about the Snape grass
---
You vs the sceptre she tells you not to worry about
---
I dont think you know what 69 is because he is clearly only sucking you off
---
You really gonna try and discredit this man by saying hes "bug abusing" because he uses something as small as this? Many things that are done today were once considered "bugs". Its a clever use of whatever mechanic causes this to happen.
---
My buddies were playing RS3 so I decided to try it out to play with them. I'm an ex WoW player so I compare every mmo I play to that. Paet of the reason I quit WoW was because of the lack of social interaction. Everyone just sat in cities and waited for a queue to pop. While leveling in RS3 I had major deja vu. I saw NOBODY outside of cities. The world felt really dead. I also couldnt tell who had good gear or not because of all the microtransactions. Doesnt matter too much since I saw nobody who was new to the game anyways. I told my friends about it and they were like yeah its not social and everyones maxed but the raids are good. I told them if I wanted good raids Id go back to WoW. Convinced them to move over to OSRS with me since I heard it was much better for the things I was looking for and have been here ever since. It most definitely is better from a new player perspective.
---
I have not done a single run of zulrah. I have researched it though. Runelite onced had a plug-in for zulrah. Jagex did not like it so it was removed. Therefore you shouldn't be able to see prayer reminders anymore. 
---
However, runelite allows you to mark tiles yourself. So basically remember the rotations and mark the tiles yourself. If I'm wrong, someone please correct me as I am learning to prepare for zulrah :)
---
I'm a scat man 👁👅👁
---
It's better to not interact at all if the interaction was going to be a tedious, annoying, unfun, physically unhealthy turd. OSRS is about variable ratio schedules of reinforcement, at a fundamental level. Dropping fish on the ground 26 times and clicking on water again is not fun, and offers no surprises. It's worthless, in every sense of the word.
---
Start from 99 then grind down to 1. Hire me Jagex.
---
I think it's a lot more nuanced than that tbh, and I can't speak from experience because I've never successfully done either, but just looking at it with the information I know, there's less than a handful of either that can do Inferno on pures that low of a level and a similar amount of people who can solo ToB, and the sample size of players willing to try either is extremely small too. You'd have to ask xzact I'd guess because I think he's the only person who's done both.
---
Verzik is definitely top tier pet :)
---
I made a new account with 45 days if membership with 35 days left. I l'm currently 30 something combat and working on my agility grind to 70. Currently at 58 and it's only getting longer.
---
Ah, yes. The ol' American bidet.
---
He never got out of lumby
---
Welcome and enjoy your stay at osrs for the next decade.
---
Potentially! Would be considerably useful at pest control. 
---
But even if you lose one damage from one player; area's such as godwars where monsters are fixed means that enough damage could be done to the point where you don't need it for the extra DPS given.
---
I was mainly trying to follow the lore of it being unholy; wearing it with full justiciar would be mildly conflicting in terms of getting extra damage and having guaranteed defence.
---
rad!
---
correct
---
From what I can tell, the Hacker said "Got a request through".  
---
I believe that means he sent a recovery request to Jagex claiming that the account belongs to him. This bypasses all authentication since a stolen or forgotten account will not have those details. He is required to have access to a lot of your accounts details in order to do so. Do you have any friends or people you know to whom you might have given your account details to?
---
1) Efficiency isn't everything, the Temple of Light is a really immersive area and you'll find that a lot of people actually like doing the quests
---
2) If you look at it as a stepping stone quest to get to the GM quests, the rewards are a lot more in line with other quests of that nature like Underground Pass, Heroes' Quest, Ictharlin's Little Helper, etc. And also because one of the "rewards" for completing it is that you get to do SotE and access Priffindas from it.
---
3) Is just speculation but Death Rune RC was probably a lot better when it came out, especially close to the release.
---
why?
---
can a cannon be setup there?
---
It's a scepter, not a staff. Make it shorter so it's not the jorts of scepters/staves.
---
Holy shit lmao
---
Might as well make it give RC xp to
---
Godwars, grouped PVM events, Raids (Potentially?), Pest control
---
Not really though
---
I have it set up so that when I type "osrs" it searches the wiki on chrome with what I put after it
---
Upvoted for actual help, or jmod smackdown if you brought the account. Genuinely hoping for the former, but I'm way too skeptical nowadays.
---
Your not understanding the question... 
---
When used in multi but you switch from it, will you retain agro
---
Botted probably.
---
You wouldn't be totally vulnerable; while it would be losing some defence, you're still tanky in full bandos.
---
How does one get past 2FA without you being phished? The only other explanation I could think of is that someone you trust is duping you.
---
In what instance would that be helpful if you instantly lose the benefits of unequiping?
---
They also kicked out the old admins and refused to let anyone help
---
They sold out hard, do no work, and just reap insane ad money. There's also constant vandalism to pages
---
No but if youre getting annoyed at getting crashed it is really the only way
---
They added "Required Items" into the Quest Logs on RS3 to prevent exactly this issue. You have to click on it to unveil, so you don't accidentally spoil yourself too.
---
A giant squid boss would be amazing
---
i... i explained why
---
You don’t need to tag things in multi for bursting/more afk. The damage bonus you get is shit, people have pointed that out
---
Having everything agro to you is where this proposed item would have its bonus. 
---
Which is why I asked the question of do you retain agro... which you still haven’t answered.
---
I use the xiaomi mi 6, pretty happy about it.
---
Idk quests are like the best early game xp you can get
---
Yeah, no.
---
If anything, it would go the opposite way.
---
Whats the original title ? (Asking for a friend)
---
Just the final piece. It took me over 500 kc to get the first piece. Lol. I'm guess getting the pet at 358 kc kinda fucked my rng for hydra
---
I mean I know you can, but that doesn't change the fact it's ugly af
---
I did ninety nine fishing back in the day and this would enable me to play my ethical vegan Ironman to its maximum potential.
---
The ds2 boss is a nice transition stepping stone
---
3 noobs and 1 absolute UNIT
---
&gt;ally tell you all the items requir
---
i agree that needing certain items is annoying, however, im not sure if outright telling people what they need is the right solution, I think it could possibly spoil some stuff.
---
i think that's a fair point but it's also a browser clicking game from 2001.
---
This is insane, I actually had a dream today about exactly this lmaoo. Support!
---
Have you tried contacting yourself? 
---
No offence, but it is extremely unlikely that Jagex will do anything after someone posts about it on social media. They're unable to verify your identity here. This thread shows exactly why, your friend posts it on your behalf. And who says you are who you claim to be?
---
The fastest and only way is to sort it out yourself, by recovering the account. Just follow the steps and it'll be sorted within a few hours. Here is the support page about it: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207217595-Hijacked-account
---
Yes it sucks and feels forever, but it doesn't really matter how long the hijacker has access to your account. The damage is already done.
---
Sceptre tele and a minute or two aint that bad, and you get guaranteed 10k added to clue value :D
---
Be careful so Mod Ash doesnt spot you at the restaurant.
---
Thanks man. Sucks you got downvoted. Other guides use too much seperation. 
---
I kept dieing because I didnt kill the adds.
---
You can be shitty and teach a lesson, just depends on your intentions.
---
Ah excellent, thanks for the images. I can play around with these and try to figure it out via reverse-engineering. I'll LYK if I have any questions!
---
Don't stress man it's literally the hardest piece of content in the game. You'll get there just practice I definitely can't do it I only beat jad a couple months ago.
---
I wonder how many kids actually play osrs tho
---
OneChunkMan is a youtuber who made a song today/yesterday called [One Chunk More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr9QD-Rxr94)
---
Also read OP's image as One Chunk More &gt; Sea Shanty 2 instead of
---
One Chunk More
---
\&gt; Sea Shanty 2
---
That part is what confused me.
---
I could also try if you’d like.
---
Tagged them early on, dealt with them whilst keeping my pray up against jad
---
Haha... yes.. of course..
---
Also a tip if you do use these guides, think of the Letters as you fight. So when you iniate think A, phase 2 think B, phase 3 C etc. Just so you can keep track on the guide better
---
Naw thats just Riddick Dick Butt Diddick
---
Why is it pathetic? From Jagex's perspective they've approved a recovery appeal from someone with more than enough convincing evidence of them being the account creator. 
---
The issue isn't with the authenticator, it's with people leaking their details.
---
I don’t guess I understand.
---
Angry little one, arent you? 😂
---
They're not me, though.
---
This is some depressing stuff. I'm at 90 and I don't want to live in a world where 1k could go without ranger boots.
---
Gonna call bs on this one, no one texts like that.
---
Crafting is super easy now. I made a new ironman less than 2 months ago and I have a fury on it.
---
Meh, Roblox is better
---
Can’t Jagex take them down for hosting pictures of them or their assets?
---
Piper perrie is the actress

Except for the part where it's happened

But alright.
---
SMACK!
---
Collection log from collector main floor museum
---
It doesnt benefit fishing that much.  It doesnt increase xp or unlock anything other than saving you from having to click more at the loss of xp/hr.  Its like MLM vs power mining, one is effecient the other is more tolerable.  Should MLM also only be accessible at 80+ mining?
---
Don't worry, I am 113 combat without fire cape
---
Why?
---
If you're using a trident or sang staff your level increases your max hit
---
If you gonna whore karma with other people achievements pls take longer clip
---
My arms feel heavy at the thought of making another attempt now at 98 combat. After some long overdue questing, I'm gonna go get my first, just like you pal!
---
One tip I'm going to try is following the visual effect of Jad's movement more than the audio effect. 
---
Thinking back to previous attempts, having my sound cranked up probably didn't help to calm my nerves at all!

Check your bank settings. You might have the option enabled where the bank pin is remembered for 5 minutes after switching worlds/loging in. If you don’t want that, you can disable this.
---
They unban accounts that have this happen.
---
You want some information?  Alright bruh, here's some information:  You a fucking idiot
---
All of them
---
Its hard to say. Every puzzle is different so I dont think I got better at them as a whole. It is mostly improvising and experimenting and with some exceptions (Mournings ends p2) they are pretty easy. 
---
I think everybody who does every quest knows the world map a lot better since you have to go pretty much everywhere even with guides right? So I dont know how I would compare.
---
The main advantage I think I have is that I enjoyed the whole journey. I keep hearing how tedious quests are and if you are just following a list of instructions it probably feels that way. 
---
I just start a quest and I dont know how long it will be, what items I need or what the reward will be. The mystery of the journey makes it a lot more fun.
---
When it comes to the dialogue I liked everything with the trolls, the wise old man, king Roald and his wife.

I have 99 fishing already so I must say no. Future generations must suffer as I have.

You're easily entertained, arentcha?
---
&gt;Really nothing to be afraid of if you don't do anything fishy with your account tbh.
---
that's not always true. In December 2014 I received a permanent ban out of the blue on my 2b xp completionist cape acc on RS3. It was a false positive though on jagex's side, so the ban got removed after a day. 2 days later a perm ban again, removed within a few hours this time. Jagex's system isn't 100% flawless, and mistakes do happen. Even if it doesn't happen often, it still does.
---
The video is cool and all, but some cunt is going to get hit by a car while skating and on their phone and then I'm meant to pretend like I'm shocked.

On release of 07scape was there anything more difficult than jad?
---
Lol I have been saving 70 crystal seeds a day for since it was announced.  I stopped buying once they reached 20k. I probably have over 1000 waiting for me to toss them in the GE.

To cater to the mentally deficient?

Sooooo. Microwaves heat food by causing water and other polar molecules to rotate, causing friction and therefore heat. A microwave on its own wouldn't heat anything because standard atmospheric air isn't polar.

https://imgur.com/a/I847Cdz here you go, found it in my screenie folder, 2 bans within 2 days on my completionist cape account. False bans do happen.

Thank you, that shit made me super paranoid cus it never happened before.

he kinda quirky tho
---
This extension has the option to remove old wiki links from Google search results.

Respect. But do know not ever person who kills green dragons is a bit, I used to kill them when I was around 75-85 combat and you can make bank. The actual green drag killers are usually in the level 12 west spot, the bots are by the graveyard.

Also, skills tab shows the skill guide for each skill. Tutorial island makes you prospect the ore to see what type it is. He never even paid any attention.

Exactly. You can do whatever you want.

Hello Bloodhound. Thanks for the incredible support! You will not be added to a list though because you a damn bot. GET OUT OF THIS POST.
---
r/cutenoobs material right here.
---
It's pretty creepy, honestly. In game, I never considered the area to be very spooky, but through your painting, I realize it's meant to be. I like it a lot.
---
When I first started playing on an account I didn't know I had from years ago, I just logged on in the middle of varrock with 83 woodcutting and 200k. I wasn't complaining, lol
---
This post is fully underrated LOL
---
Makes me think. This seems like pretty weak gains. When was your account hacked? When did you recover it?
---
Ok so Im comfortably high and its 5 am and laying in bed rn but:
---
I see bots in GE that display wins/losses and amounts played. They offer a ratio of winning around 45%. Law of high numbers means this gets pretty close to reality in the matter of a day, considering they are oftentimes getting insane amounts of trades back to back. Average bets seem to be around 250k. (Data not field tested)
---
It would be interesting to write a script that tracks the winnings of a specific bot over the course of a session and the time they seem to get banned/recovered. This data could then estimate the winnings of these bots easily by scaling that script to track multiple bots spotted once they get cycled.
---
Then we could see if OP is a big fat liar
---
Those numbers are wtih my normal gear. That pic is me wearing best gear to hit a 69 for a picture on Reddit. I bring dwh as my only extra item.
---
Delusional
---
Alex jones has been right before :\^)
---
I'm a newcomer from mobile
---
I appreciate the response! I agree not everyone at green dragons is a bot, and we will try to separate the legit from the non-legit. I do enjoy using luring techniques to bring bots to our wilderness spider lord.
---
Can I add you to the list?
---
€11
---
It is definitely lonlier. I started OSRS this February after an 8 year break. Played some F2P first, no one ever chatted. It was spookily silent.
---
On P2P it's a bit better, but still a lot less talk than a decade ago.
---
No and no. This pic is me wearing att boosting items cus o was literally just running and and leaving if I didn't hit a 69 with my specs. 
---
My normal setup is serp helm and salve, regardless of on or off task. Avernic defender and extended super antifire
---
damn thats rough, ive had 2 in 6 kc lol
---
Without working for the rewards it makes them worthless. Hence why things like moparscape servers were never popular for very long. If you just get the rewards without working for them they seem meaningless. Which is why i regret playing my main so much instead of my 500 total iron man.
---
Normally I would yes my man but I start college for my first time believe it or not in 4 hours, and I’m letting my membership expire and quitting RuneScape until my course is over which is in 6 weeks. After then I’ll be back and I’d be happy to join if this is still up and running
---
Blowpipe made it a lot easier, and then tbow made it trivial
---
I started playing when I was 10 years old and spoke next to no English. It's not that hard to figure out how the game works lol.
---
Hmm. I'm torn on whether I should upvote or downvote this 9gag tier meme
---
“The little penguin” (Eudyptula Minor) might be what you’re looking for 🐧 adorable little bois
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I think it's more a case of "it's obvious when you know".
---
Similar to how obvious lures &amp; scams are in oldshcool when you know about them, but when you don't they look totally legit, it's not about using your brain, it's about knowing.
---
You can't judge the situation for that person when you have complete mastery of the game.

---
No, it's not a case like that at all. Burden of knowledge is what you refer to. I've played plenty of games and have met plenty of communities who do essentially the same thing as this guy. The current generation of players are little more than slaves to a meta and have absolutely no idea how else to approach a game. They don't see a game as an adventure to explore, rather as something where they have to abide by a specific "optimal" ruleset in order to get enjoyment out of. People play this way in Runescape, League of Legends, CS:GO, Monster Hunter, everything. It's pretty sad
---
Insanely disciplined to not sell off
---
but they dont have to be.
---
Jagex must feel really stupid right now.

Ranarr seed prices have already fallen somewhat this past week. I think it’s because of this.

124 combat here. Not even close to B gloves
---
Wdf this is ridiculous.....im doing it on my ironman and have 37 with 0 items
---
So, i totally agree with you, but is that really what the review is saying?
---
It seems to me it's not so much, "what is the best way to play the game?"
---
Hes saying "I want to take my first steps in this game but i don't know how and there is little to no guidance".
---
KQ is the best pet and anyone who disagrees is wrong.
---
Bring about 100 Dragon Darts for Jad, you can out DPS the healers and not even have to worry about them.
---
Also, bring some chaps to swap out for the skirt once you're at Jad as more accuracy is important.
---
That's actually not a bad idea.
---
Yikes bro LOL  imagine being such a huge sweaty nerd you get this mad over what I said...
---
&gt; Oh btw idk how they found out the email. I didn’t fall for any double xp bs or “I’m quitting here’s why” and I haven’t downloaded anything in the past week because I’ve been busy and offline. No clue really how this happened.
---
https://haveibeenpwned.com/ enter you email here. There is about a 200% chance you've been in one or multiple data leaks. The fact you reused passwords is the only reason you got hacked, if everything else you said is true.

Nice man I run basically the same food wise I like having a combo just in case I miss a fireball from not paying attention lol.

I got muted for advising someone to go to Zybez for help with a quest at a GWD mass at Bandos like ten years ago or so.

Grasses.

in the us, if its income, its taxable sadly.
---
Im not proud
---
Do u know they patched that?
---
Especially when he calls Tree Spirit a bitch.
---
Holy shit I thought I was the only one. I used to play Growtopia back when it first came out in 2011? I was 11 at the time and that game was my shit. Played it for years until I got bored and now I’ve found OSRS and have been an addict ever since.
---
I think that is possible if you are focused on the game and accidentally click the icon, you should trust partner much more.
---
i think so
---
When you add an authenticator, you get codes to remove it if you lose your phone or whatever device it's on. There is literally not one single argument that isn't 100% irrelevant that can be said for removing authenticators instantly. You're so fgucking daft.
---
Noone said anything about real money. This is all about gp. 
---
Follow the conversation please.
---
&gt; That's not what the community is asking for. They purely focus on the delay and nothing else.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If Jagex is doing this, they should definitely send notifications. 
---
Again, you thinking this is real proves without any doubt that you're a complete fucking degen. Stop talking.
---
They got rid of the time requirement.

Preposterous in context, required in principal. 
---
What I mean is, this game in of itself can be seen as a health crisis (99s originally created as a ridiculous placeholder for no one to actually achieve). Barely much done in the way since the RS2 inception in order to quell this ridiculousness (RS3 has though). 
---
These QoL updates are seen as an affront to this version of the game for instance as it also impedes on what driving force brought it back. 
---
In reality though I fully back this, as I doubt many still-sane folks from their nostalgic yesteryears would subjective themselves to the same tortures they endured as kids, and now repeat as older-kids with pleasure. 
---
If things like this keep going on (not a problem by me in the slightest). Then we will have the further disappearance of the original game we voted into existence. Except as you know there is no going back (look at Runescape Classic, the truly hardcore have moved on or died off seemingly, those still left are relegated to private server hopes).
---
My account was hacked and permed for botting in like 2013 and they finally reverted the ban in 2017.
---
are we really gonna ignore this mans name?
---
You mean my main and my alt on one monitor and twitch on the other
---
I get these all the time. It means they habe your login, at the very least. Back when there was a customer support email I was able to contact them and have information removed. No one can do much of anything now as my last issue was 2013.
---
The authenticator exists to prevent other people that know your password from logging in. That is its only purpose. 
---
I find it strange that you say that people are "abusing Jagexs recovery system", but want the solution to be with the authenticator. Why? If there's a problem with the recovery system then Jagex needs to make sure that people can't abuse it.
---
Because it's respectable like burying bones
---
Do you PK? You go to PvP and it’s fucking lit with Zerkers and pures dropping DDS specs...
---
LOL going for 200m farming at tithe. You can literally do any content except farming while waiting for your trees to grow. Tithe farm is not efficient in any way.
---
There is an easter egg in RS3 for this. Some text pops up along the lines of "the fish floats away lazily. Did you really think that would work?"
---
Don't bother dude, people on reddit are actually fucking brain dead. If they want to waste hours at tithe cause they're too piss poor for magic trees let them lmao
---
How about an buyable unlock with golden nuggets at MLM that you can receive clue scrolls when cleaning the ore?
---
people were shorter  back then
---
Send this to the top so mods can see
---
for strength xp definitely obby, in general i think obby too
---
Strong support to make the tithe farm autoweed option into this rake
---

someone’s daddy bought a fat data plan
---
10/10 would listen to music with.
---
Nice edit... 
---
I think people against it are the vocal minority. Anyone who remembers the toggle from 2008 loved it and if you dont like it you can keep playing SD its optional.
---
If you gonna take karma from someone others achievement, pls take decent clip and include that players name/acc on title who did something
---
Oh thats smart.
---
They probably let the bots run on a different ip and then instead of straight up collecting the money they change the luck for themself. 
---
So instead of collecting their scammings they win it and there is reasonable doubt that they can say that they just got lucky.
---
Ofc this dude also tried to make other ppl bet a lot at the same time and blew his cover.
---
(I think jagex only bans the dicing bots and not the idiots gambling there so that way they get out "clean".)
---
Find the "standard" setting and only stake with that ever, even if the opponent switches one option that seemingly does nothing. I think I just copied some streamers staking settings or found a legit staker (doing small amounts) and copied theirs.
---
With the right settings you can just cast an eye on their inventory and equipped gear. Most people only have gp/plat token stacks, pets to show off and maybe a backup tent. If there's a bunch of weird items they've probably hidden something dangerous in there so just don't bother.
---
Items off the top of my head to avoid would be:
---
* weapons, staves/hastas give defence bonuses, rapier is better than tent if poison doesnt proc
---
* event items, that rubber steak thing has some weird attackspeed-buff interaction
---
At a glance. But if you wanna debate about this feel free to send your messages to /dev/null
---
Correct
---
Not sure if you're making a snarky remark or not. I was asking a genuine question
---
What you describe as "annoying, tedious and clicky" is 99% of what the game is about. The game isnt for you. Find another one lmfao.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Just before I read this, I found this video and if you don't mind taking some time out, could you (or anyone else reading this) please give me your thoughts?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wieXiA30sCY
---
GP isn't an issue for me on OSRS, but according to this video, it looks like for what it's worth, Iban's staff may be a great option, despite the fact guides I have seen are saying that only ironman or lower levels should really be using the Iban's staff?
---
Don't shit on summoning it's a great skill
---
search for bronzeman I think.
---
Kinda funny how you choose the same name for it.
---
Thankyou!
---
What does an ironmeme want from lava dragons that early in the game...? You sell their drops on the GE, right?
---
Fat downvote
---
and jazzsax wants to alter the game to cater to these people...
---
Clan name is “closed in one week”
---
Abbreviated to ciow.
---
Good luck, though in all seriousness!
---
Well theres no way of finding out other than a poll so.
---
ps: You pointed out my response wasn't clear yet your upset I edited it to keep the conversation on point?
---
Lmao, i guess you're kinda right, nah i meant more like PvE stuff
---
im as lefty as it gets but this is just not funny bro
---
Just a hint - you’ve basically repeated the same things 3 times. They get it, you’re looking to go to uni in NYC.
---
Remember, the people on admissions will read that kind of drivel on 5000 applications. Try and spice it up a bit! 
---
P.s. not taking shots, just trying to provide constructive criticism
---
Thanks, I'll look into that, appreciate it.
---
Avoid the duel arena.
---
It's a massive development though, it's not about preferring SD it's about the amount of resources that will need to be thrown at it.
---
I'm a fan
---
Who is double silvering this lmao
---
Be carefull with pets, ppl try to hide their skull thingy that you can take runes out in there, or their chin stack.
---
Tell ppl to bank pets tbh.
---
Theoatrix
---
That’s the easy part. Even if you mean gaining xp through it I don’t think that’s an issue
---
MM2 boss is hard if you don't safespot him but trust me safespot him it's so annoying otherwise. Be ready for the platform with the guards, that can be annoying if you mess up.
---
DS2 is very easy just read up on the special attacks on each phase of the boss fight and you'll be good. Vok is also really easy just read up on his attacks and it's a breeze.
---
Both MEP1&amp;2 are very easy, 2 is where people complain because of all the running around you have to do. However, it honestly takes like an hour at most if you're reading and following a guide.
---
&gt;I believe it’s someone that has a Mac in Las Vegas, NV
---
Clearly he didn't because they logged into his email. (and then their email told them this person logged into it)
---
They didn't recover his account. His email was unsecured and they simply turned off authenticator.
---
Update: I defeated the snek. 
---
Didnt bother paying attention to rotations. Just went in focused on pray, avoided the smoke and blowpiped his ass. 
---
Elite void is now rightfully mine and im pumped. Vorki time :)

They won’t make a third game mode
---
Never

---
Also depends on where you live. Where I live, after tax, it's 4 hours on near-minimum wage.
---
Switch to mobile every time you want to empty inventory and use tap-to-drop.   Or just fish exclusively on mobile.
---
Karambs are very good afk, manta rays even tho its wildy and anglers work well too
---
Needs more face tats
---
Well obviously you cant make the mechanics the exact same as the dice bots because they have the added safety of simply stealing your gold. There has to be a revenue mechanism that guarantees the house wins but is also fair to the players.
---
Oh shit I remember this. They added it right before I quit rs3 for good. That honestly was a nice feature
---
I almost had a stroke trying to read it
---
underrated comment
---
Whats your username!? Id love to add you and help if you have any questions?
---
You’ll be back.... They ALWAYS come back
---
As the guy in the picture I'd like you to give my tassets to these guys. Then we can have all their backs
---
Fight caves in runescape classic? Wut.
---
I'm so confused that an account banned for dice botting doesn't get cleaned out, especially on recovery. Like, couldn't you set up a VPN, do this til you're banned, then just recover with the VPN off and keep the goods?
---
Are you the same guy who posted this yesterday too? Lol

---
Nice! Just wait until you get a dhcb and a couple other gear upgrades - I end up dropping almost half my invent of food to loot 5 kills trips most of the time
---
Thanks again! An approx idea of what to use is great. I'm just such a noob when it comes to this stuff so thanks for making it easy for me to understand :) I'm nearing mid 80's magic, and I'll hit it soon so I'll upgrade to sea trident then if I still decide to do barrows. Cheers :)
---
This is good bait.
---
The problem is that he doesn't bother to find out how to play the game. He sees that he can't chop trees without an axe and doesn't bother to either be lazy and look up how to get one, and neither does he go walk around and do other shit until he gets his hands on an axe.
---
This has nothing to do with my post though. Jagex decide xp rates.
---
Melee gear to tank and a blowpipe or melee for ahrim. You don't really need mage gear as long as you aren't so negative you splash.
---
giant mole is ridiculously easy, doesn't really feel like a boss at all. 
---
dks are pretty easy especially if you have decent gear, to ease yourself in you could try solo rex just to familiarise yourself with the route in, praying properly etc.
---
i really like doing the gargoyle boss, the mechanics are simple and there's a lot of downtime where you can prepare for the next phase to come.
---
The player is out of runes so they can't cast because of that he's smashing the goblin with his staff
---
his knowledge of the game is not big enough to know that this is a repost.

---
Well, i will keep my fingers crossed
---
I’m a PA for a hand and wrist surgeon.  If anything you’re way more likely to get a tendonitis (people here call this RSI) over a carpal tunnel syndrome especially for males. Females are at a higher risk but nonetheless most of us are still relatively young. Ice your wrists down before sleeping at night and sleep with a wrist brace on and you should be fine.
---
&gt; and look up how to get one 
---
So for newer players need to research third party websites to understand the game because its not intuitive enough is what your saying
---
If you login to runelite at the top it can save your loot between sessions!
---
He's a big guy
---
In the picture, Pepe is punching the viewer, much like you bash the goblins head in when you don’t have any more runes to cast another spell.
---
E-peen has been a thing since before you were in diapers (which is what? 13 years ago?)
---
Amazing. Like others have said, reminds me of Ronald Dahl like the minpins or something. Pls do more!
---
For the longest time I used the fandom site. It wasn’t until I started hitting some newer content, late game stuff that the site became useless to me since pages were not created. I’m still getting used to it but I would rather use the fandom still. :/
---
This is amazing.
---
Not at all. How often do you use your email address for rs?
---
I got mine on 5 kc last night and also hit 70 farming when I cleared the hespori. Feelsgoodman
---
wow you’re very good at skating. like real damn good bro
---
Now that you’ve run out of runes, you’re about to bash the goblin in with your staff. This is what he sees right before he takes the blow.
---
I will have a dedicated following of people that have an attention span longer than 3 minutes. 
---
And like I said, low numbers would be replaced by higher sub costs, which i would gladly pay instead of playing RS3: Reloaded: The Return of the Casual.

I hope not dude, I was really excited to be honest.

I feel. I got dupe malediction shards from Crazy Arch at 2 and 5 kc about a week ago. Then I got my bucket at 5 kc last night
---
Well no that would be the easy way to get an axe. The proper way would be to keep playing the game and find one. There's literally an icon on the axe shop which is like right by the spawn in lumby.

---
Didn't watch. This dude is such a fucking weirdo and should not be allowed to stream, brings a negative spotlight on OSRS
---
Options similar to negative xp lamps that would offer players a limited number of -50 xp rolls at a high cost such as 5m per roll.
---
If you had ags back then you were the kind of pvp.
---
So either youre lying and you didnt have your account set up, or the hackers have also hacked into your cell phone company, provider, and your email provider. Thats entirely unrealistic. You also couldve gave away your information, on purpose or not. Secured accounts literally never get hacked. You think if it was that easy the entire hiscores would be hacked by now. Just secure your account.
---
If more people did barbarian fishing less would be monkfishing therefore their price would rise and it would be more profitable.
---
maxing in 2277 good luck op

Can we look into upgrading achievement diaries to include new content? One example could be adding ‘equip an ivandis flail’ as a hard morytania task. While the reward for completion would be the same, recompletion could provide an exp lamp worth half the value of the original (1250, 3750, 7500, 25000) to award players who completed it twice

Because the purpose of catch and release in osrs isn’t carpal tunnel, it’s keeping the fishing spot open. If you’re still filling your inventory that nothing has changed

---
Personally, I am not a huge fan of the "follow an npc" method of travel, but I do like the idea of an enchanted Brass Necklace. It is a fairly iconic and useless early game item and I wouldn't mind some of those items seeing more purpose. Though you could probably say the same for the base gold items too...
---
Hi welcome to my emote only Iron man
---
The emblem farming bots at Lumberyard are insane and basically impossible to kill.
---
They have 5 atk, 25/26 hp at level 22 making obby maulers the only accounts to have a chance to kill them.
---
There's over 40 accounts there at once.
---
When will they be banned or make it easier to kill them by preventing them from teleporting after 1 hit?
---
My ID for most games is Xanick. I'm  feeling pretty relevant.
---
Because of Ironman and hardcore Ironman. Plus bounty hunter is becoming dead from Jagex not introducing new pvp items. People used to buy gold for pking and there was such a high demand for it. Now that bounty hunter is dead people aren’t buying gold as much and that’s why gold is getting cheaper bc the sellers are trying to make Atleast some money.
---
&gt; clanning/pking in singles lo
---
So you edge pked and rag bolted LOL. Aka you have no experience actually using mage let alone max mage setups on diff accounts.
---
Weird you keep ignoring when I ask you to explain exactly how magic is completely fine. Could that be because its so obviously broken that you couldnt possibly defend the position? 
---
The guy new to bridding and actually using magic says magic is fine, the entire rest of the singles community with far more experience say its obviously not...hmmm wonder who is in the right here?
---
Could the death animation of Nylocas in maiden be made smaller? The click box takes up such an unnecessarily large part of the screen.

I'd take this down if I was you there's a chance you could still be banned now and it's basically flaunting scammed money. Obviously very good you managed to get your account back but its clear that account has been used by someone to take legitimate players money which is very uncool
---
I guess it's better to support the vennies than to support jagex's horrible/unethical business practices.
---
Even if he is trying to merch it, does it really matter if results in dead content being buffed?
---
You’d be fine, as long as you’re comfortable with missing his special attacks on each wave you will be able to defeat galvek. Take ruby bolts (e) for the first 3 phases and the final phase use diamond bolts (e)
---
pathetic merch attempt alert
---
I don't understand the mechanics of bringing cash to the wilderness (i see this in PK videos) and dying. Do you keep the highest 3 items based on high alchemy? Does bringing cash offset something that's theoretically more valuable than its high alch?

---
Things arent hitting a tick early, but rather a tick late sometimes. When things hit a tick late youll also notice certain animations like olm's head bobbing break. It appears to be random, or at the very least players cant determine what causes it, and can change from being "scuffed" to "unscuffed" and back again during the same raid.
---
The crystal bow will still be very bad after Song of the Elves is released. It needs to have a way to hold more charges, and the damage from the Crystal armor won't be enough to make it worthwhile to use.
---
Sweet, thanks! We got 2 more days in May... fingers crossed we get a nice deal! Otherwise, I'll hold out until November :)
---
Yeah 75 range is doable definitely.  3 of the 4, phases for the last boss you simply use Ruby bolts and proc 100s, then switch to diamond bolts the last phase.  While obviously dragon cbow and dragon bolts will do better, it's not really needed.
---
Jagex still gets paid for those bonds.
---
Could defo do it with those stats but obviously the fight will take a bit longer than most videos you see on YouTube make sure you're using diamond e bolts and Ruby and the Inv I'd maybe take like 3 ranging potions 6 to 7 brews and the rest super restores. It's trial and error though so give it a go with that and see how you do if you die obviously swap out some restores for brews. Best of luck!

---
Things absolutely hit a tick early. On some scuffed olms you will be hit by falling crystals the tick before they hit the ground.
---
I think it should have a unique spell for it.
---
This is beautiful
---
While it’d be cool and all they wouldn’t split the community even more especially for a second 2007 version. If anything they’d go for a pre-eoc, maybe around 2011 version but realistically that would never happen either.
---
Gathering magic roots is horrendous right now due to the long time it takes to chop down the tree, could it be made so that you either get more roots per tree or make a pay option that removes the tree but not the stump?
---
Why is magic defense calculated partially from your magic level and defense level, as opposed to just defense like all other combat styles? It makes sense lore-wise I suppose, but more-so, what does this change about the game mechanically?
---
I ran into some kind of bug where Astrid got into a text loop and I couldn't advance. Someone on an old forum suggested a sex change, and I haven't switched it back because I don't care enough.
---
My only concern is a visual change. It'd have to look almost the same. Like the thread says, it could be done by moving crates to a wall. Please jagex, don't set up a pyramid of barrels and potato sacks when you do this!
---
First person to simultaneously die in game and IRL.

Would it be possible to support force touch to right-click on the mobile  versions of OSRS in the future? Another alternative would be a setting  to adjust the length of time to hold your finger down before the action  menu appears (or better yet, an option for both in app). That is the one  thing that makes the mobile version more frustrating to play vs. the  desktop client.
---
All they have to do is attach it to the player instead of an equipment slot.
---
Yeah I got really cocky. The entire run was outstanding and I was just getting ready for wave 63 Bc I had no problems prior... and then forgot about the 360
---
Yea it should definitely give more magic roots. And it wouldn't be that farming would be much cheaper since you have to spend a lot of time cutting down the tree.
---
Got'em!
---
Cool af
---
On that note the main theme of kourend is really bad as well. You're just taking a stroll through the market and you have this really bombastic soundtrack playing, doesn't fit at all.

My buddy got hacked once after he ran out of members. They bought his acc a bond, and sold all his mems items and bought a shitton of lobsters for some reason.

Did you use a blowpipe on most bosses? Not to devalue your achievement but Blowpipe makes a lot of bosses EZscape(Such as desert treasure)

Just because someone wants to make something useless useful doesn't mean they're trying to merch them.
---
How did he do healers? Just kill 1 at a time?
---
Not every item needs to be expensive or a must have. Pretty much every monster in the game that has a major unique drop with the other uniques falling in price drasitcally because they doint come into the game basee on their demand, by as a byproduct of the must have drops.
---
See: hydra tail, granite ring, heavy ballista, ferocious gloves, saradomin light, steam battlestaff, trident of the seas, bandos boots, pegasian crystal, almost every single jar, treasonous ring, etc.
---
Fuck yeah
---
I mean, are you ignoring world 2? It’s always packed and that’s pretty much where you can sustain yourself through manual trading. A self imposed restriction on yourself, how ironmen used to be back in the day. As long as people don’t advocate for removing the GE and alongside as players in those worlds can’t interact with players out of those worlds I could care less. I’m not talking about pm’ing friends, it would fuck the economy up if regular players could hop and transfer items. I know personally this isn’t for me and I wouldn’t like it, but as long as there’s a lot of player support and they’re completely isolated as fresh level 3’s, go ahead I guess.

Slayer until 99. You can boss while doing slayer. I mean for tasks. Dagganoths?dks blue drags? Vorkath. Avianse?arma. Greater demons? Skotz and Zammy
---
You get the idea
---
No one man should have all that power
---
Yeah it was. You could sort of enable it with a button IIRC.
---

LOL this is far better than 18hp fire cape

Tassets pl0x
---
Do not fist guthix
---
I'm with you on this comment. I do miss real interaction with players and Skilling being profitable. But now with the ge it makes everything so automatic.
---
Go to duradel and get boss slayer tasks. Vorkath for blue dragons, KBD for black dragons, Armadyl GWD for aviansies, Zammy GWD for greater demons, etc. That's all i've been doing and i've been making just about 100m a month with very casual play (1-2 hours per day).
---
What? Both are dropped the same way....
---
Awesome, thanks for giving me the motivation! :D
---
Getting ranged to 75 is something that's first on the to-do list so that should be fine. And good to hear magic is important, I read on the wiki that most forms are weak to magic so that's a welcome surprise.
---
I'm looking forward to it, thanks! :)
---
Low effort, downvote
---
Lol you’re all good, I was just surprised by the amount of constructive criticism I received based on the brief excerpt. I was really just hoping to make people chuckle
---
Dawg xzact literally did solo TOB until a scythe drop. They aren't even comparable
---
So I was doing oak dungeon doors and my demon butler had 6 planks he was holding then I DCed. I went back to resume and he just had the typical go fetch X amount of planks option. Did I lose those planks?
---
Yes but it needs to not remove quest xp rewards.

&gt;Why should Jagex design their game around an extremely small minority that is gambling addicts? They'd just go gamble somewhere else and it would solve nothing
---
'Why should I stop selling crack? These crackheads would just give someone else their money and it'd solve nothing."
---
Jagex should design their game in a way that doesn't *create or harbor gambling addiction* like any honest company would. But the arena makes them a fuckton of money so as long as they can get away with it, they will. They don't even have to defend their shitty business practices because people like you will crawl out of the woodwork to defend the arena anytime someone dares to call it what it is.
---
Dh at nmv is overrated. I messed up and used it early on. I got shit xp rates to base 85+.

I wonder how much the meta would change if bulwark WAS 1 handed. 
---
Obviously that's not its intention and would never happen, but I wonder if it would buff defence enough (especially if paired with justicular) to be worth using it over a defender.
---
&gt; Literally just stand there doing this for 1-2 minutes until you've calmed down a little, and start to get the feeling for it, then you can right click him to attack.

Maybe their schedule doesn't have 4-8 hours of uninterrupted time in a day needed for a part time job, but has 2 hours here, an hour there, an extra 15 minutes, etc. Especially if you're in university, it can be a lot easier to have time available to play a low-intensity game like OSRS than it is to have time available for a job.
---
I wonder what these people get out of that kind of behavior lol, fucking losers.
---
Qalquats too??
---
I recommend 75 in all melees and range to kill them. Mage helps as well for the defensive side of it. If you have the money, learning with a bludgeon and blowpipe is easier because the switch is simple.
---
So you defraud people. You're a piece of shit.

Bursting dust devils or nechs. Alternatively slay your hearts content out there

Reading the pvp blog was actually hilarious when the first thing I saw was about changing the value of max capes dropped on death. Out of all the issues with pvp, they  bring up max cape drop values on death? They're literally laughing in our faces at this point. Mage is so broken I rarely deep wildy pk on my main anymore, instead I pk on my pure.

&gt;Bounty Hunter emblem farming, Jmods say they don't see evidence for it, but it's clear they're just ignoring it.

Don't bother thinking about that, just look at the link instead
---
:( now I regret not choosing a history major!
---
It definitely was, at least for a short while. So maybe something changed it to that and they changed it back. But 100% you could do this before the new year. And ive been trying to ask every QnA about it since
---
I have chinned at both Mm1 and MM2 caves alot. Just yesterday I did 80-90 in the MM2 caves.
---
I did probably 65-75 in MM1 caves.
---
The xp rates weren't hugely different between the two as long as you are constantly getting aggro and keeping 4 monkeys MAXIMUM (the monkeys will spawn on their bones, but only 4 monkeys can spawn in a square, otherwise it'll reset the spawn),stacked in each space around you in the Mm1 caves. It's much easier to maintain the spacing and aggro in mm2 but it can still be done with slightly more effort in the Mm1 caves with nearly comparable rates.
---
However, I would suggest getting to at least 60 or even 65 before using chins as you will be spending huge amounts of gp.
---
I am in the exact same position. You deposit anywhere?
---
pretty obvious the OP meant "bought"
---
I had this with my RX 480 when I had old drivers. Either update your drivers (I'm using 18.11.2 and it's fine), or disable MSAA.
---
You might be dense as hell if you think paying 5 since all those years is cheaper than not paying when you dont play.
---
Eh its mostly to force people to play the game and kill a variety of monsters instead of just grinding to 99 combat skills to go kill bosses and skip everything in between
---
I mean like the initial group of rares would have to be released by jagex right? So if they release 100 of them to the GE at 50m each, in essence they are taking 5b out of the game
---

San-serif fonts kinda suck for printed works. They look nice on computer screens because of pixel limitations. Studies show serif fonts are more readable in traditional print, because the serifs provide more shape definitions for your eyes to track. 
---
That said, they're both default Microsoft Word fonts. The "basic bitch" of typography.
---
Geez, I really fucked up that one. Thanks.
---
this is annoying to be fair
---
Can something be done about house advertising on world 330? Currently, if you want to host, you have to run multiple accounts with auto-typers to be seen.
---
I would suggest something similar to the TOB board, and maybe it could show the hosts construction level, house layout, and maybe a very small message the host could write. Additionally, clicking on the host on the board would send you straight to the house.
---
No, its literally fact. The best moneymakers in the game cant get you as much p2p time per hour than min wage jobs. And we're not talking actually decent jobs.
---
You might prefer to not use real money, but thats less efficient and this is not a matter of opinion. Facts arent subjective. They're facts.
---
OSRS is an interesting game because the user experience has become a game mechanic. In most games, you would want things to be as easy as possible and the gameplay would be focused on skill and game knowledge.
---
In OSRS however, a lot of the skill behind non-combat gameplay is driven by these seemingly poor mechanics.
---
I'm hesitant to bring up EZscape, but it's not wrong to say that this is going to bring a new low effort XP method.
---
Opinions of devalued achievements aside, this would significantly change the feeling of how the game is played. It is an auto-drop mechanic that would likely end up bleeding into other skills - granite mining being an example.
---
Instead of changing these core mechanics, I would prefer to see new ways of training that focus on game knowledge and some sort of mental skill, with an appropriately rewarding XP efficiency.
---
Just my two cents, but hey - if the community wants it, who am I to argue?
---

Another from 9 months ago, before the new year, where you cannot.
---
People want it to be longer because it looks better, not because they think sceptres have to be staffs.
---
What level strength do you recommend before trying to pk though? Should I stay away till I hit like 90? Or is around 80 “good enough”
---
Slightly misleading because there are really only two parts you have to tick eat in ToB solos: sotetseg death ball and Verzik P2 to skip red crab phase.
---
Tick eating Sotetseg is definitely one of the easier tick eats in the game, and I’d bet any 100 KCer has tick eaten that successfully, and any 1000 KCer has probably had to tick eat 25% of the boss or more since his team planked, at least once in the 1000+ KC that he has
---
Tick eating P2 is much harder, but it’s more of a horrifying waiting game than anything else. Your character isn’t damaging the NPC (that’s the entire point, so you don’t spawn red crabs), so instead you blowpipe the purple crabs when they spawn as your main source of DPS, dodge or freeze crabs, and be ready to tick eat when electricity comes. Many times, you’re just alternating between two tiles (to dodge the auto attacks), waiting for one of the above to occur, which is why I called it a waiting game
---
This 50 cb is a league above solo ToB since xzact had to use so many strats that were not done in previous pure capes. Zuk the final boss took 90+ minutes. I would say this cape is more impressive than any previous inferno cape, including no pillar, no food, etc. and I would compare those restricted runs to the same level of difficulty as solo ToB. I would place this specific inferno on a league above all of that
---
Had they added abyssal demons and not slayer, nobody would know the difference. I like the slayer difference, but adding a monster doesn't really mean slayer is adding a new mechanic.
---
Thats not how google decides first results lmao
---
Yeah, I like slayer. It's just not like other skills.
---
Contractions are increasingly acceptable. In formal works, you would often be deducted for using contractions, but that seems to have fallen by the wayside in the past decade. They may not even teach that it's improper in high school. You don't see contractions in published papers though.
---
Yung scape hit the ge wit my cash, got drops like nieve wit her ass ooooooo and she gon' give me a task, steel drags I'm like pass skrrrrrrr
---
I dont understand how anyone ever thinks the people begging at ge are genuine
---
I was going to write out a detailed response about the differences between the two, but I don't want to feed the trolls, so I'll just say I hope you have a nice day :)
---
Even being a btw, economists have predicted a recession after the careless actions you've conducted in those flax fields this morning.
---
You are a giga brainlet
---
No I agree with your idea 100%. I think it'd be fun for players who want to play like that. The only downside is if it's not a very popular idea then jagex wastes a bunch of time and money for dead content. They should def poll it and gauge interest tho 
---
I'm disagreeing with the other guy who didn't want them at all. The lack of GE is great for nostalgia but not everyone has 5 hours a day to play.
---
It's 6:36PM here so jokes on you

😂

Splitbark gives decent defensive bonuses whereas xerician/mystic robes don't give any at all

It's not a troll people are just hypocrites lmao.

Solo ToB is probably more difficult than other restricted infernos such as no pillar, no food, low cb (with tbow)
---
This specific cape blows all of those out of the water since xzact had to do it on a rune crossbow. I would argue that solo ToB with a whip (which hasn’t been done before although xzact has tried) is on a similar level to this accomplishment
---
I have 48 atk 30 str 63 rng 45 pryr 73 mag at lvl 51 combat. I just had some luck potting to use fire wave with a zammy staff, zammy cloak, elders chaos robe top an hood, red d'hide chaps, seers ring, magic book and occult necklace. I use fire wave/flames of zamorak and swapped out to dbow spec, prayer potted to keep my protect from missiles. managed to take a couple 65+ toxic blowpipe users.
---
but that's not how rare releases have ever worked? they either just spawn randomly or are given out by an event npc. jagex wouldn't just put a handful of items that no one knows about on the GE and expect them to sell.
---
Sorry mate it's done now just needed 31 for lost city and I got loads of bowstrings
---
I just came back to the game what do you mean? Did you die or is there a point where the quest breaks?
---
how is this supported lmfao
---
 H.A.M. was right.
---
Of course. I inspect the hell out of it, even if I recently requested and awaited an email in the past few minutes. I just recieve so many phish emails daily its annoying.

The quest is long and boring and annoying. I quit halfway thru

---
Random questions about GE Offers.
---
As far as I know if you're completely inactive (not logged in at all) for 7 days your ge offers go inactive. 
---
1. Does simply logging in again "reactive" these offers or would you have to cancel the offer and redo it? 
---
2. Similarly - if you go f2p, with a members item offer in (but still actively play, basically forgot to bond up in time and your membs drops but you reactive mems right away) does it cancel the offer and even going back to members require you to cancel offer and put it in again, or would acquiring membership be all thats needed to activate the offer once more? 
---
3. Assuming you don't need to cancel offer and redo them in the above examples, how does the offer "reactivating" effect its offer/que priority? Would it try to put its place in line where it was prior to temporarily being inactive, or would you put it in the very back of the line, as if it was a brand new offer?
---
Yeah I'll be doing boss tasks for sure!
---
But i'm also quite unsure about what tasks I should do, I mean. Are wildy bosses really worth it, for example? Or Kalphite Queen?
---
I actually enjoy those normal tasks like fire giants or greater demons without a cannon, it's more of a relaxing time! 
---
Things is, I always read people saying that bandos and arma are too expensive for the boost they give, so I always think twice before getting those items :/
---
No, it can't.
---
34m isn’t as much as you think it is. You can get some of the essentials like the other guy mentioned. Get a b ring and imbue it, black mask, obby set + b neck + obby sword, swamp trident, blowpipe, fury, god dhide set, ahrims, occult
---
slayer rings exist
---
Thanks man! Not taking it personal I appreciate it!
---
Weird flex but ok
---
They don’t really
---
Do you want to do only Slayer mobs or also bossing? If yes to bossing, which of these bosses would you like to do? 
---
Demonic Gorillas, Cerberus, Vorkath, Kree'Arra
---
I only mention those 4 because while there's other Slayer bosses, these 4 stand out as being exceptionally higher GP/hr, all in the 4m+/hr range compared to other Slayer bosses that hover around 2m/hr +/-1m/hr depending on the boss
---
They're bots that pretend to run dicing games, most commonly found at the GE. No matter what anyone tells you they are not legit in any way. It's entirely a scam and you should never trade your money to them.
---
I like how the idea of individual people having individual perspectives is confusing to you. 
---
&gt;“LITERALLY EVERYBODY DOES THIS AND ITS DEFINITELY NOT 2 SEPARATE GROUPS OF PEOPLE!!!!!”

anything that has a use in game is good to flip. no one will ever give you a list of items to flip because you flipping them makes that list less good.

---
I don’t tbh, I’m not even sure exactly how they work myself, but if you leave the mages and rangers alive once you have 4 mages and 3 rangers alive, no more will spawn. 
---
From what I gathered from this successful run, if you kill the rangers, eventually it will get to a point where there are like 6 or 7 mages alive and nothing more spawns. So makes the last 1.2k of post healer zuk much more chill compared to flicking mage jad ranger lmao
---
Went 1400 dry.
---
If you have a high enough strength and defense, sub-70 attack should not be an issue. I did most of my black demon tasks at demonics as a piety pure with 61 attack and a d scim. Just making sure you keep track of their switches and praying correctly is the biggest thing. Besides that, they're pretty easy to dodge the projectile and not get hit frequently.
---
triple jads got me around 15+ times, indeed challenging. but funniest part about the “tbow” method, is for me, personally, i used an acb w drag ruby bolts. i found it put out better dps than the tbow. (i do own a tbow). acb w drag ruby bolts, diamond bolts in invy and dragon darts in your blowpipe. only 91 magic btw. was a grind.

I usually about break even on nechs and dust devils. Its worth it because you'll eventually want your mage up.

If your only goal is money though, you probably won't even use mage for slayer.

Yeah, that's why I asked! I don't see any situation I'd use magic in besides Kraken
---
Don't go to the GE for items, then. Most quest items can be found or made while in the same area as the quest takes place, and it's rewarding to actually search out and find what you need.
---
shiiiit. I just recently got 99 range and magic and made some fat geepees from CoX recently. Bank is around 350m. I am starting to run out of excuses ): issue is I’m having too much fun raiding and I know that once I start i’ll never stop until I complete it.

Could difficulty of clues be looked at? Beginners are considerably more difficult and complex than easys and mediums. Sara wizard runs two attack types and poisons on hard clues whereas Bandos Guard and Armadyl Guard only use one combat type and don't poison on elite clues. It just feels like the relative difficulty of clues is inconsistent.

Exactly this, old quest like these are from Classic where exp rewards scaled to level. The crafting exp from Murder Mystery did just that and 1406xp is about the reward you would get at level 32.5 (if you could theoretically have that level).

Once you get members aim for quest cape. It’s a good way to level up your account and also get various perks and useful gear, such as barrows gloves, fairy rings... If you get bored of doing so many quests, there are plenty of things to do compared to f2p, but questing will let you skip some tedious early levels.

It depends on the def of what you're fighting a lot more than ranged level, since the only advantage of void ranged is the max hit increase. Even at 99 range you'll get much more accuracy out of d'hide but you'll never hit harder with any other ranged gear.

Lmao you didn't know you could automatically set placeholders? Maybe if you typed in coherent sentences I would have actually understood what you were asking and could have told you how to turn on automatic placeholders. I thought you were asking about removing placeholders.

This is part of a continued adventure, currently around 5 weeks into it, and as expected the community loves to vote for RC and agility, last week we finished off [40-60agi at the pyramid](https://youtu.be/hqgYKRjSlE8), while still under 20combat.

I think you should start at 50 attack as a pure and pk then. It’s not a good idea to go into 75 attack pure pking at the start since if you’re new to pking chances are you’re gonna get smited a few times. Better to practice watching prayer risking a gmaul vs an ags
---
But they're not puzzles if they're simple fetch and gathering quests like they are on runescape
---
if you enjoy osrs quest you probably have never played another game lol
---
my statement still stands
---
shorty got a hairy ass
---
All I know is that all my staking friends quit after the change. Staking items was a huge part of the community. And with any amount of tax, stakes (which are typically 50/50 gambles) have an expected net loss over time.

A lot of them are probably bot accounts trying to farm karma to have influence for spamming shit later on, and a lot of the rest are just little kids who can't do anything but speak in memes.

And the coins keep coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming
---
Issue with Kraken is you need a task, so its not very sustainable for the long term if he's grinding for pets. Agree on the other two though.
---
Didn't know Varrock had multiple cities. However if you're talking about different cities within Gielinor going to war I would think that Falador and Varrock would be the two power houses as far as F2p, but I'd give Falador the edge.
---
30 year Olds are millenials... Is that part of the meme or??

---
🌊🌊🌊
---
They usually don't. What I think you're seeing is people dying with untradables like void, fire cape, torso etc. They keep their item on death, but they need to pay to repair it before they can use it again. The person who pk'd them gets the gold equivlient of the repair cost. This isn't always the case obviously but it's the most common. This is also only below 20 wilderness. If it's above 20 untradables disappear I believe.
---
This is the official info on it: https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/broken-armour--open-beta?oldschool=1&amp;gsi=eoa59p

Well the one on the left is RS3 and the one on the right is OSRS. Different rewards.
---
* Don't waste ranging potion doses, they can really make a difference
---
* Attack the minions as soon as you can
---
* Don't kill the magers, just keep magic protect on (except below 600hp, when waiting for jad)
---
* Stay close to the shield, this is your top priority
---
* Try to tag all the healers as soon as possible
---
* Stay calm, you can do it
---
A good team takes me 15-20 minutes, I always solo attack and get about 400-500 points per game, that's about 2-3 rolls an hour.
---
At what point did you realize it was only one click and this plant was the ONE to fulfill your entire inventory? Did you ever get nervous thinking it wouldn’t keep going that the next flax given would be it’s last?  That takes skill and time to find the best flax plant in all of the beehive plantation.
---
Thats a great fuckin' argument you got there bud.
---
The game is in a much better place with the current death mechanics. Having to 3-item a GWD boss because you might DC or get stacked out isn't fun.
---
They could build the vorkath system into something more universal - I think most people are fine with having *some* cost associated with dying - but losing all of your shit to PvM deaths is what makes people quit the game.
---
Free
---
Tell me your ways please.

I'm sure you can. Just stay over 60 hp at ghosts so if you mess up two prays in a row you aren't getting slapped back to back 30s

I would just like to add that you should be EXTREMELY cautious about some of the zero xp money makers (e.g. watering saplings, unfinished potions, grinding nests/bones, etc.) because the supply and demand for these “in between” products can be very low, meaning price fluctuations can be extreme. For example, I tried the one that is grinding superior dragon bones, and while the margin was good for the first two or three, after that, the supply/demand was ruined and I was out a lot of money. 
---
That’s not to say you CAN’T make money with these methods, but don’t sink your entire gp pool into it right off the bat. Good luck!
---
Actually this post is a warning about an nmz bot that's been loosed to wreak havoc on the rest of the rs world.

Was talking with SO the other day how lucky we are to be able to not notice things like this. I realized I had been paying for a WoW subscription for 13 months, and hadn't logged in. The only reason I noticed was because my debit card expired and they sent me an email to update recurring charges and gave me a list

We make a stupid amount of money and have no kids. I should contact Blizzard to see if they'll refund me lol

without flax how do i string my 10k yew longbows and get money

It just looks one-handed, it isn't actually one-handed in the equipment slot. 2-handers will be held the same way on low detail mode or if there are too many people in one area.
---
I'm not really interested in the bots but you can hit me up to help protect the less experienced PKers when you inevitably get hit by a team.
---
Have you tried turning you computer off and then turning the same computer back on?
---
This will increase xp/h too much. Easyscape
---
Good luck! The good thing about wildy pking is you dont need to buy all BIS gear, so it's a bit cheaper (going in black d'hide and climbing boots to reduce risk). After killing Scorpia, Chaos Elemental/Fanatic, and Crazy Archeologist a couple hundred times I decided to try out some real wildy bosses, so I gave Callisto a go. The second I teleported there I get gang banged by a team of 8 pkers. I managed to tank my way down to level 30 to teleport, but as soon as I did they tb'ed me. Never went back there again haha.
---
Dude I haven't looked at my bank account in months and probably swipe my debit card 50+ times/month. I know how much is going in each paycheck and I know what my bills are.
---
The bank handles savings deposits and my Roth IRA and 401k are automatic deposits as well. Has nothing to do with being scared, some people just don't have to do it.
---
mauler is best if youre bh pking (profit wise, most bots in that cb range for emblem farming) otherwise if you dont mean 1def only then 60 att piety is strongest pk build by far
---
Damn, that sucks. Did you at least get the double xp?
---
While getting some gear is definitely a better idea, id also recommend considering construction. Getting construction to 83 and boosting from their is such a quality of life improvement. Though you probably won't have the quests needed to get all the upgrades that 83 + boosting offers, it's something to consider.
---
Massive respect for cops, even more for cops that play RuneScape

There are no noobs at ge... Dont know hoe many times i have to say this.. all the ppl who tell hacked stories, all the people pretending to be generous for donos... All the people making borderline legit sounding offers for stuff... The people asking for armour...

Is anyone else having any trouble with runelite? Every time I attempt to log in with it, it crashes the entire app.

not at all on task you have melee weapons 4 ticking 50s or even 60s  and weapons like scythe and elder maul hitting 80s

Either keldagrin wins bcs of multi canons. Or ardougne wins due to sheer power.

Falador white knights are a joke. Varrock military is even more of a joke.

Another underrated one is burthope. Even tho they are weaker than falador. In theory, they have the warriors guild. Which should put them easily above falador ( they also survive constant harassment from the trolls. ).

Are you happy with how skilling fits in the current economy? As someone who likes gathering resources at their sources, I find it super disheartening that the most efficient ways of getting logs (for example) is from killing monsters.

You're getting downvoted but it's true...  Anybody good enough can make a completely undetected virus.

Farming isn't completely idle. You need to go to the patches and plant/harvest the plants. Doing that takes time.
---
why is that you think?
---
Lol
---
epik
---
I will assure you, you are not alone 🙋‍♂️

This is correct. Also there are clan chats and sometimes worlds dedicated to trapping the knights in a corner allowing you to practically afk. I'm unsure if that's work on palladins or not.

&gt;If you are an ironman,

if ya are an iron and hit 87 magic before like low mid 90s magic then ye, but most dont
---
also should save bloods, theyre stupid expensive to buy
---
there are counter measures to werewolves though... silver!
---
That depends on your gear and the monster in question.
---
For example, a monster might have +50 stab def and +70 slash/crush def (a difference of 20).
---
If you had a weapon with +67 slash and +8 stab (a difference of 59), you would want to slash despite the stab weakness because your weapon can't stab effectively enough to take advantage of a marginal weakness to stab.
---
Stab, crush, slash and ranged are all calculated very similarly with the same consideration towards def level and def bonuses.
---
Magic is slightly different than all the other skills. If you actually want to see how effectively you can mage something, a general rule of thumb is if the target has a high magic level, it's going to be very hard to hit. If a target has 1 magic, feel free to use magic.
---
We need to support local small businesses. Imagine 100k players giving this humble merchant 50gp each
---
yeah, takes 3 minutes according to CML and your own logic. That definitely takes some time. So there you go with your point that Farming is definitely not an idle skill, because let's focus on the 3 minutes it takes to do a farm run, not the 7 hours it takes for the fruit tree's to grow.
---
But what if i had 10 pineapples on me and clicked it by accident!

I haven’t seen that at all. Was it working normally in the past? Could probably try asking for help in their discord
---
The point is just to delay the access after resetting the password. This allows the real owner time to notice and raise issue about it.
---
If there is an issue raised after an account is reset then they should undo the reset and look deeper into the issue requiring more proof. 
---
In the end the original owner is going to know at least something about the account that the attacker won't know, which would allow Jagex to determine the rightful owner after a wrongful account reset.

Tl;dr: to get an estimate for overkill DPS:
---
1) Calculate amount of hits needed to kill NPC assuming non-overkill DPS
---
2) Add 2/3 to the result. This is the average amount of hits needed to kill the NPC WITH overkill included.
---
3) From the above result, can easily determine overkill DPS
---
for a rough overkill dps calc.

typically in nmz stuff you fight still has good enough hp for it not to matter. dh with piety with high hp is a looot better than obby if you are using the xp multiplier bosses etc
---
Any idea which minigame?

Comin straight from lumbridge town. A young bwana got it bad cause they’re brown.

NMZ is next to PC on the minigame teleport list. Maybe the bot clicked on the wrong place due to their client being resizable or something??

my SO had her account hacked and banned and they got her from 1-84 crafting spinning flax... there was so many bow strings and flax in her bank when jaged unbanned it lol

thanks. What would you say is on an equal or slightly better level to the fighter torso? I currently have a granite chestplate (r/cutenoobs yeah yeah yeah...) and i'm looking for a little bit of an upgrade, at least until i get the fighter torso.

thanks.

what would this add to the game other than giving players more xp for no reason

It’s just a meme

Money making isn't great until +70 but past the very early levels you'll at least be covering costs and perhaps making some extra to save

If you’re training combat train slayer.

This time your Reddit comment will get them to add it! The other 2000 didn’t work but this is it dude!!!!!

I started slayer when I decided to start training combat. Right at level 3.

You holding it weird =/= it being one handed

Real talk, how am i supposed to know where you sleep in your house?
---
70 slayer is when the money really starts coming in buy you can unlock superiors whenever and always have the chance at an imbued heart. — Start Slayer as early as possible.
---
Yeah again, it seems like you're only upset about dragonfruit trees then. I dunno what to tell you. They're in the game. 
---
&gt;Even if you don't do the new methods (why wouldn't you?) 
---
I don't do the new methods because I don't like doing more than 1 tree run a day. I still use palm trees instead of dragonfruit trees because it costs less than half the gp/xp. The only thing I've added is occasional hespori runs, but I've got all my anima seeds banked. It adds marginal total xp per week, but it's still active time I have to spend killing it. Doesn't really add to my ehp.
---
Didn't he explain it?

Thanks man!

you should stop being poor dude

Just because “he was being stupid” doesn’t mean the other guy wasn’t a twatwaffle. The two are not mutually exclusive.

ok but its not more valuable than a dmed

The thing that bothers me is not the effort put in (the 3 minutes). It's the fact that this 3 minutes could used to be done once per day, and tree's twice per if you stayed up late. I just think that the combo of 2 new herb patches, 2 new tree patches, redwood patch, dragonfruit release, all in one update was clearly not tested from a players perspective.
