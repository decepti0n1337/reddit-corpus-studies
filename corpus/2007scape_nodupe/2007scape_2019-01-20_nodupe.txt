Unfortunately the PVP meta is built around specific account builds (always has been) and anyone remotely good is pretty sweaty (think Rick eating and Gmaul stacking and the like). I wouldn’t recommend pking with an even account build although it’s not impossible. If your goal is to kill revs and survive pkers that’s very doable. As far as snares, teleblocks and ancient Magic’s - protect from magic reduces there effectiveness and double hides is very OP in terms of mage defense and cheap
---
don't matter what we say itll remain dead content.. 1 in 1000 drop from a boss and its almost alch value rip dragonbone necklace merchers
---
Every shield you mentioned there is either niche and required for a specific monster, or only valued as a dps boost. Also obby shield is trash and completely outclassed by defenders.
---
The biggest part of this update and Jagex doesn't even respond to it.
---
Much appreciated

Just for visibility. Yes, the sim works on mobile. Obviously it's still the rs3 layout, but the prayers are in the same order so it shouldnt be much different
---
thank you friend &lt;3
---
Round One
---
FIGHT
---
Yes
---
I would be okay with it, but i feel as a KDT item it is not good. I would much rather see it on something such as metal dragons to make them worthwhile as a task or somewhat. That or make dragon arrows drops from bosses requiring ranged such as arma or something. Maybe even a new boss to have that kind of content
---
Nope. All magic gives 2 xp/dmg, including the trident. Trident just doesn't have any cast xp. You can check for yourself on the respective Wiki pages:
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Magic#Combat_spells
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Trident_of_the_seas
---
As a consolation prize. You can now do all the parts of that clue if they come up again.
---
Double teak benches &gt; 0ak doors
---
Then it should be a inventory only item, granting 2 extra spaces for you to click twice as much.
---
I'm just going off the wiki rates that say 27k/hr from 40-49 and then 32k from 50-59. Averages to about 30.
---
I wish that that dude who wanted to be in your arms was in my arms. Then he'd have nowhere to put that baguette besides in my ass.
---
If you enable it. Its off by default.
---
I'll give an actual answer.
---
For the first part
---
&gt; yeah sure it's dead content
---
That's the problem. Apparently it needs explaining that content only obtained from bosses is better if not dead.
---
For the second part, it does not have to be a weapon. They probably just picked the whip because it is tail shaped.
---
Basically the nature of the beast unfortunately.
---
Casual ba cc - helps if you have a general idea of what you’re doing

Don’t use both stick to one. If I do sound ignore the movements if doing movements ignore the sound

Honestly though if you think about it, that's such a good thing. Something as simple as Runescape, kids these days are so hung up over a game looking beautiful(which runescape does in it's own charm) is what a game really means.
---
Madman, hope you get pet or claw soon!

I thought I was the only one with brains here. Why are so many rs players so fucking racist and misogynist? Sometimes I just think these idiots are children on something... I hope they are.

Well done u 10/10 meme

Because they ran out of hops and the next time they try they'll be timed out for 5 mins
---
100% Agree on this.   
---
Sometimes you just have to take a step back and appreciate what you have.
---
How this team managed to revive this game is truly amazing.
---
The old 36 double nats thing is done, sadly. I miss it.
---
There are people who still run, but they generally charge. Sometimes you can round up some noobs.

Be proud of who you are.

Yes and it's generally better to mismatch pieces for god affiliation in God Wars Dungeon.

Q
---
Incase: super restores and prayer potions costs roughly the same but super restore gives	+1 more prayer points and restores stats in case you ever lose them(not hp) and range tutor at lumby gives access to deposit ammunition straight to ammunition slot/blowpipe, mage tutor same but for runes in rune pouch and finally : after barbarian crawl, the barbarian near barbarian course allows you to toggle that after you finish vial, you throw it to ground and it disappears instantly. 
---
Just asking for advice. Started doing barrows and at 30 kc i have gotten 2 guthans helm and 1 guthan torso already  i sold one of the helms, and right now i have 4m at the bank.
---
I am 72 att, 72 str and 67 def.
---
Current setup is abby whip, neitz helm, barrow gloves, fighter torso, ardougue cloak, dragon legs and dragon boots.
---
I and planning to level my defence to lv 70, and then i want to buy either a dharok set to do NMZ, or buy the rest of guthans set to afk at bandits camp. I would like to know the xp/hour for afking both of them, because i think dharoks is better xp, but less afkable cuz of rapid heal flicking.
---
i did range only for my first 50 kills, helps until you learn rotations :)
---
*ding*
---
75 range/mage :) higher levels help ofcourse. GL
---
/u/JagexSween 
---
damn really lucked out
---
This is how we got trump.
---
Oh crap you're right lmfao
---
Pretting much what you're thinking.
---
If not taking damage and need max prayer bonus, e.g black demons: Prossy top and bottom
---
If taking melee or range damage and using piety: Verac skirt + prossy top or verac top. Prossy gives slightly more prayer bonus, verac top gives slightly more def. I use verac brassy + skirt personally but I'm only 75 def and prefer the extra bit of def. And you've gotta be careful of breaking fashionscape rules ofc.
---
Note: This could either be using protect prayer + Piety and tanking damage e.g Cannoning suqah where you pray mage and tank melee OR using piety with no protect prayer and tanking, e.g ankou.
---
In combo with this, you can swap between DFS or Defender if you need more defence on something stronger like fire giants or greater demons
---
If you don't have an SGS, you could use the extra money for that. It's pretty helpful for saving on prayer potions and healing when you need it.
---
That highly depends on your works network settings
---
I agree and will be voting no. Absolutely no reason for it, just adding a new weapon for the sake of a new weapon. Devalues one of the most iconic weapons in the game. This is subjective, but it looks awful as well.
---
I lead others to a treasure I cannot possess.
---
I use the bank tabs to organize items that are often used together!
---
Dude the other day someone hacked my account for $63m. I felt hella demotivated but I only took a few days off 
---
Wages are theft anyways 
---
um....you win this round
---
Only Italians can make pasta this good 
---
Because the player base will not be satisfied with any updates unless they trump whatever came before them.
---
Well I'm not a ghost 
---
Ginormous if provable
---
Thanks for the reply. I couldn’t see my female character rocking verac top so that’s a no go but definitely will look into prossy top and veracs skirt. I was thinking of using that extra cash for SGS I think it would be more beneficial over bandos.
---
flipping is a low % compounded on like a 4 hr basis.  
---
If you have low numbers of golden coins you will earn low number of golden coins.  Better to invest time into raw gp making.
---
You dont need to heal flick. Dwarven rock cake hits through absorbs.
---
much useful :P i meant a bank layout Like Tab1: food tab2: slayer gear ETC. 
---
 D 
---
It would just be your RNG. if you're not Woox walking and get an extra acid phase, that will add a lot to your kill time.
---
It's the same anywhere. At Hyda for example, I'm normally around 1:50 - 2:00 with blowpipe. PB is 1:35 but sometimes it can be a 2:35 kill if RNG is shit
---
Every time at cerberus
---
Does it need to be attached to the Dragon Scimitar? It's already alch price so it might as well be its own thing. Only reason it combined with the abyssal whip for the Bone Whip is because they don't want those to crash, but the D Scim can't go any lower.
---
If someone was legitimately quitting, they would never ask you to put in your details. Jagex doesn't refund items unfortunately unless it was down to foul play. 
---
As a heads up, "Quitting" or "Double XP" stream channels will have virtually zero followers and viewbots to make it seem real as if people are watching; it's not unheard of and people do fall for these like yourself. Make sure to change your password and email as they'll have access to that, as well as a virus scan incase they might of installed a keylogger.
---
They even alched my fire capes wtf
---
Very rare drop used to be worth a couple mill now its work like a lot less
---
Ever play Path of Exile? Path of Exile has a Hideout editor in which some of the best hideout creator's have, if I recall correctly, inspired actual game dev's with their model creation.
---
To make a "model" as a player you literally take a few key pieces(anvil, firepit, trees, basic shit) and keep stacking them on themselves, messing with lighting and so forth until you have say a map hideout device that oozes green color and when you open your town portal(this part is mtx) the portal is also oozing green. So on your end it looks like 1 item with cool lighting, but realistically it's 87 anvils and 4 beams of green light with 3 granite stones made to appear to look like a base.
---
Dorya!
---
Would be cool as someone mentioned in a previous thread to make the drop an upgrade to the Dragon Mace which would give more balance in the game to have a crush weapon to fill in the gaps.
---
google images, first image, crop. sue me.

The spelling on basically all of them was perfecto

I suggest the quest lets us kill the dogs fusing their blood with the Silverlight which turns it into barklight then we never have to see those dogs again

This whip could look so much better
---
Should Vetion and callisto have similar safespot added because of pkers. Should the Cerberus boat bug be added back into the game because you could misclick the boat. The trade off with safespotting is it takes time to set up. 
---
Imagine caring about what some reddit pleb thinks lmao 
---
tldr
---
You mean useful but not accurate.  It's useful because I am trying to tell you the time you spend flipping items will generate you more GP if you just use that time on some standard high yield money making method.
---
It's inaccurate because it did not address your actual question.

Also the woodgrove in Tai Bwo Wannai..
---
You can also consider obby set. I’m 99 attack and strength and get roughly 74k xp/hr in NMZ normal rumble. With dharok’s I get around 100k xp/hr. The benefit is that I can go AFK for 20 minutes or until absorptions run out but with dharok’s I need to click every so often to maintain max XP rates. I basically used obby set to get 99 att/str while running errands or at the gym
---
u can drag the vampires up tho which is probably what he meant
---
I know but I just can't get it. It's too much to remember. I play with the screen split aswell but my problem is that by the time I look at the picture and figure out where I need to stand it's already too late. The boss just frustrates me and costs me a lot of gold to attempt so I think i'm just done with zulrah.
---
isn't the zamorakian hasta a 1 handed crush weapon? not that I do not want more, but how would this weapon stand out. Where would we use a bone whip/scim where instead of the hasta or lance?
---
and autism stock for uim?
---
10/10.
---
That ending was truly beautiful
---
Thats actually an interesting take on power creep, especially if you only had access to weapons and armour available on its release, such as Dagganoth kings with period gear and having to fight them all at once, for example.
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo.
---
Worth noting that an obsidian set is around 7m~ so might be outside of this guys budget.
---
Attach a hydra tail to the base of the Toxic Staff of the Dead to make the Toxic Trident Whipper of the Dead? Hits a target 2x (1 mage, 1 melee w/ crush att) and also inflicts poison and venom and deletes their account if they die.
---
Please vote yes in next poll ty.
---
I was tired had a bunch of irl shit happening wanted to watch streams and just relax, I know I am a fucking idiot.
---
I mean shouldn't a hydra drop be more valuable than the sire drop? I'm not sure the difficulty of either so dont take this as me saying it should but hydra being a higher lvl boss, the bludgeon and tail having similar drop rates, and hydra only being available to konar wouldnt it make sense for it to rival the bludgeon.
---
how much do dragonhunt lances currently buy/sell for? and is there any chance they will crash?
---
also you couldn't have more than one I think
---
I've had around 15 seeds so far

? ? ? Skeletal visage is a 1/5k drop, 1.6k is FAR from dry smh

Torso+prossy legs for prayer, torso + v skirt if u gotta tank 2 styles. But just buy bis melee and do tasks with 20 ppots in inv like the rest of us who cant bother flicking

btw i never use vpn to go out of country bc of lag thats dumb af 
---
No it won't if you have the slightest clue what you're doing
---
When you pray on tasks is it just protect? or Piety too?
---
I guess the couple of ways to look at it are gearing for prayer bonus vs str bonus vs tankiness
---
Bandos falls under a mixture of str bonus + tank. 
---
Torso + Obby legs is just a cheaper version where you're giving up the tank while basically keeping the same str bonus. The downside is you're losing a lot of defence so you'll use more food. If you're praying as well, you're also gonna be using more prayer potions
---
I'd rank the options like like this from max efficiency to last. Excluding cost of using it.
---
1. Bandos + Protect + Piety
---
2. Prossy + Protect + Piety
---
3. Prossy top + verc skirt + piety. No protect 
---
4. Bandos + Protect. No Piety
---
5. Prossy + Protect. No Piety
---
6. Bandos. No prayer
---
7. Torso + obby legs. No prayer

Might of rolled it twice on the same kill, don't know if that's possible though. Only a logical guess.

You seriously almost fell for this? 
---
My personal favorite is casting orbs at the obelisks, profiting around 350k per hour.
---
http://oldschoolrunescape.wikia.com/wiki/Money_making_guide/Charging_earth_orbs
---
You have level 60 magic so you can start with Earth Orbs.  Once you reach 68 you can start casting air orbs.   PKers love to stake the area so be careful.  Earth Orbs are safer due to it being in the lvl 2 wilderness vs level 7 at the air orb.
---
At first you’ll have to get the hang of the process but once you have a routine it’ll become easier.
---
A recommendation is to drink a dose of anti poison before every run to prevent being poisoned by a spider - ruining the run.  Also use energy potions.   They take away a small portion of profit but increase the speed of your runs dramatically.

True. Weird thing is that Runelite showed the coins as 65000 on the floor

You should be using the Ourania Altar. Look up a ZMI guide.

Yeah that'd be interesting, at least something different from another great slash weapon. I don't think the bone whip poll will pass anyways

Gives better ranged bonus regardless.

Bludgeon and abby dagger would plummet as there would be no reason to train strength with those over this (at most monsters)
---
Not sure if I didn't understand correctly but rsbuddy's exchange site shows them going for upwards of 88m
---
Theyre like 90m and theyre hours wise very rare. With bow its 27-28 kills/hr with efficient kills which is 37 ish hours per lance, like one per 5 tasks w slaughters

This is true.

I got my fire cape 1st try a few weeks ago.  I recommend you get blessed dhide and a blowpipe.
---
But more importantly (if you haven't) I suggest watching a full guide.  I forget who's I watched, but it was a full run through the fight caves with commentary. 
---
So I watched that whole thing and then on top of that I had the wiki open on my 2nd monitor with each wave listed so I knew what was coming next.

Ignore all of this you're just messing up prayer switches on jad.

I messed up 1 flick on jad and he hit a 6 so I was really lucky.

Good luck

I’ll settle for downvoting you. 
---
Right now, dragon bones are 4.7 gp/xp, while hydra bones are 6.6 gp/xp, I wouldn't use my hydra bones right now though considering the are about to be potentially buffed. If the buff is voted no to however, you are looking at losing about 800 gp in value per bone you have
---
What a salty brainlet, if you don’t see how it’s an unfair advantage then there is nothing that can be done here. Some people are just born broken I guess.

I'm using RuneLite and whenever i hover over something, some lines appear on the screen. They also appear on the combat style box. How do i take these off?
---
throwbaack to that shit, bruh don’t worry you just need to learn rotations and its cake as fuck. I have like 1.3k kc on my level 93 zerker, and I know lots of pures that do zully as well so you got this if you have 70 def.
---
What boss is that?
---
bp. not close.
---
That seems like it'd be painful, which part goes in your ass first?
---
Original 151 or wtf
---
Vileplume as farming skill please hehe
---
ha ha ha WOW 
---
i honestly thought i was missing something when i saw this post and the likes
---
You know, I’m something of a prequel memer myself
---
looks like wiggle daggers from WoW
---
Lol so now that I know the item being talked about.. the most important thing is what are you slaying?
---
It was always simply polled as a cosmetic, there was never any other choice. 
---
*Ar-DOIN
---
Did you model this in-engine?
---
Would have gone with Lugia or steelix for defense but aggron is pretty cool too 
---
What show?
---
Settle down. I'm not even op I'm just saying the dumb stuff op would and forgot the /s. 
---
This looks like one of those dudes on that crazy ass monster show that used to be on cartoon network or nickelodeon 
---
i like the improved design but would rather see it without colours.
---
The regular mob hydras drop it as well. The bludgeon is 3 different uniques from the task only boss.
---
right, and since he is saving for a bond, he probably doesn't have 200m, moron.
---
The bludgeon already exists
---
Thanks for answering my question 
---
I don't like the powercreep we keep seeing but the spine is attachable. If anything the whip will go up.
---
Really like this idea lack of crush weapons apart from bludgeon with a hefty price tag would make more sense than the whip.
---
Mine is the flax field south of Seers village. I spent day upon day picking flax there and made my first mil there. 1000 flax was 100k back then before the ge. Good times
---
C-... can you do gardevoir?
---
What possessed you to post this
---
Before I know it I’ve had 3 deaths with 20+ loots just sitting on the ground lol

Yes. If you don’t have any good money makers, you can consider glassblowing or cheaper alternatives
---

Why dont you just do 800k/hr mahog tables

This is getting out out hand.

How much does it heal? In how many bites?

Just answer the question instead of shilling your stupid ass cc

Timburr for construction, there’s no way around it. 
---
Posting you on RS justice as we speak. 
---
I didn't know I needed this in my life.
---
 You know ima piggy back on your post to just say, why the fluff is this only being talked about post release?
---
An upgraded whip is a not only a sick idea it's quite controversial. If the damn thing had been announced at Runefest all this crap would have had time to work itself out. NOW instead we have all these sick ideas about an upgrade permanent whip with cool ass ideas like color variants, only for the fucking thing likely to be shot down at the polls simply because this is all so sudden and huge.
---
I can easily see this being added if they gave time for the community to work out their dislikes with the idea and put it to a poll once the idea has been around for a while. The OSRS community still can't make up it's mind about Warding after 4 months, and we think polling an upgraded whip in less then a week from announcement is smart?
---
Idk I am hyped for the whip, and I hope it gets passed, but at the same time I would respect if it didn't pass right now simply because this seems to be out of nowhere.
---
He's got a nice, crisp and not over complicated style for it. I'm glad he went along with the comment I made when he posted the starter Pokemon to do the rest of the skills! (Even if I did only plant a seed)
---
I feel like Tauros should be RC, because that guy was a dick to catch in the safari zone in the first games!

Alright, settle down cummybot.

it should atleast have same stats as gory with + 6 prayer bonus and maybe some str bonus ? its tied to 2 bosses imo should be way better then a glory worth 10k

It crashed because it's from wyrms. It won't recover in price.

It is, and there is also the chance at emblems I think a wild Slayer account would be sick to see how many emblem drops are obtained during progression. 
---
Is that in the farming guild?
---
So sell asap then?

Yeet

I've missed you Benjo

Sounds like something in RS3 not OS
---
Its probably the hacking community and anti community doxing each other
---
To clarify I've been an on and off player, but I'm coming back after a pretty good hiatus to say the least. I'm not really looking for a "how to play rs guide" but more of a "If you do these quests in order and level these skills in the mean time, you can get leveling up pretty quick" kinda guide, I believe I stumbled into a huge google doc a couple years back that was similar to this. I have a singular bond on my RS3 side of things, but don't want to use it before I have gotten a good foothold on OSRS in terms of skilling/questing done, so as to not waste much time with my bond. Sorry for the confusion
---
I’m legit sad that I haven’t been able to kill him. I tried like 60 times so far. I was about to go back to skilling but just logged out instead. My confidence has been destroyed

I doubt it tbh, it’s really not that useful and it just got a lot more common.

They need to make more replacements for the whip so that they can nerf it. It's too good as a weapon to also be BIS for OSRS rule 34. /s
---
Should be about 18 which is a lot of guap
---
It’s probably Catherby for me. Passing over White Wolf Mountain into that area felt like journeying into a new world when I was little, and I ended up spending so much time fishing and cooking lobsters in Catherby over the next few years. To me, the Catherby/Seer’s Village area is still the pinnacle of Runescape towns.
---
Make a bone saw that always hits 99 on ice giants

I would like the bone whip

It’s 2h. Bone flail would be one handed, bludgeon could stay bis for str training so it’s not devalued.

Because he didn't invest

Nope. Creating new animations and models is extraordinarily simple. Not even slightly expensive. Especially for an item that will be utilized for years to come.

Yes, purely cosmetic.

Just buy saplings and get your farm up asap then do ranarr herb runs off cooldown and you'll make a mil a day.

Fuck that. Cut that line like ur 99 woodcutting

No one downvoted you though? If they did it's probably because no one cares about newer pokemon

Possibly unlikely, but still possible. RATs are becoming increasingly common lately.

Not sure if it would be too easyscape: after using the ectophial, it would not generate empty ectophial. Lore: at unfiltered game it would say: as chunk of slime falls from roof, you notice that it fills the vial.

Well I already clarified I’m not super tech savvy. He said he had a $300 budget so I assumed my screen is just as good as any tablet he’s gonna get for that price. Then told him my phone runs the game no problem. Is critical thinking hard for you? How many times did you ask someone how to spell a word when you wrote your reply? Thanks for the entertainment at work man. 
---
you always see it but you never expect it to happen to yourself :(
---
Incredible, looking forward to more! :D
---
I always wondered how those got ahold of your account. Sorry to hear about it. 
---
If it does anything it should ABSOLUTELY be something that benefits and buffs mage in some way.
---
Melee is decently behind Ranged in a lot of things but Mage is WAYYYY behind both in most things.
---
lol 2nd person today that dude got.
---
Well it's only painful coming back out.
---
looks like she needs some toilet paper
---
Hmm how about deoxys?
---
Personally I would hate to see such an iconic item be replaced.
---
And if we really must, I feel like a replacement for the whip is better served for a different update. Hydra boss is fine as it is as far as I know.
---
On LTE I don't believe you're getting throttled, must be something else. The other day, my connection kept switching between LTE and HSPA+ and I was dropping packets like crazy on HSPA+ that's why I asked. For the IOS internet connection problem, it only affects iOS 9 users. 
---
I really can't see anything other than local electromagnetic interferences causing your issues. Radio emitter, microwaves or wireless electric meters can cause interferences. Might want to check if there's anything close to you that could cause this, but it's very unlikely that this is your problem. 
---
&gt;Ridiculous unnecessary step

No poison damage will not contribute xp which takes away from per hour rates

Good luck using any teleport when you're disconnected.

Just got mems for the first time and training slayer. I have the Green Dragon task in the wilderness and keep getting pk’d. All of my combat stats are around 60 except for prayer which is 45. 
---
Anyone have any tips? I’ve tried worlds with less people. Super frustrating :(  
---
Did you have an authenticator on your email and RS account? 
---
one punch
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
use shield of arravs cc which you can find from minigames tab. i got my partner from there like with 5 minutes
---
"Improved" is a matter of taste, I suppose. Not really a fan, looks too garish to me. Personally, I think the 'original' graphic looks great, is instantly recognisable as a tail/spine, and fits the OSRS aesthetic exceptionally well.
---
Nice work on the shrimp
---
It's not like 3rd Age isn't completely useless. There's a few niche circumstances where some of those pieces can be pretty great. For instance, 3rd Age Range is provides some of the best magic defence available for a berserker pure.
---
It just doesn't make much sense to make something genuinely game-changing insanely rare. It really is just about flexing your wealth.
---
Jesus how long did that take
---
I don't click on obvious links that quitting &amp; double exp. My email didn't have a second authenticate on it. Switched to one that does now. There's been a lot of hacking going on recently I just want jagex to do something.
---
Are you trolling? You've typed it out. How cant you see it.
---
They asked you to tob so youd have wealth on you via gear. Thus not needing a pin.
---
They asked to switch worlds so they could log in and clean you. 
---
The 2 ppl that left once you got it back were obviously in on it...... 
---
&gt; it's position in the meta compared to the Dragon hunter crossbow. 
---
i dont know why its being  compared to dhcb so much. there are monsters where range is just inherently going to be better.
---
It was kind of touched on but I thought I’d elaborate on the stats thing. The attack bonuses represent the weapons likeliness to land a hit, the strength bonus represents how much damage it will do, and the speed represents how many game ticks it takes for each attack. In similar weapons (such as a rune scim and a rune sword) the difference in attack and strength bonus are minimal, however, the speed is substantial. A sword has a speed of 5 which means it takes 3 seconds each attack whereas a scim has a speed of 6 which means it’s 2.4 seconds per attack. This means each minute you’ll get 4 more swings out of a scim which is going to equate to the highest dps bonus of the two. 
---
Well done! It was worth the effort. They're BIS for most setups.
---
excuse me its spelt *karamja*
---
I've been running raids with the guy for like 3 months who made the group so I feel mostly just surprised it didn't happen sooner. The guy I was raiding with also knew I was getting close to tbow so why not just wait til then?
---
Pick flax
---
I think blissey could be HP
---
Well done. I need to do that too. 
---
I remember telling a guy to hurry up and get a dragon defender over an obby shield. 
---
Good mates since. 
---
Hydra

cheers dude
---
i've since turned my back on the economy so i tend to forget how it works
---
everyone who got in line roasted him at one point or the other 
---
Dw. I already have all chats disabled, empty friend list and no clan.
---
Imo dps held immensely for jad nerves because it's just less time to fuck up. Maybe try just making range be instead of tank great? Unless you're struggling to get to jad that is
---
nice
---
Looks cool. 
---
It’s only polite 
---
bro how is that sanitary enough for herblore? How are druids approving this?
---
I haven't used it so you can ignore my opinion if you want.
---
I think the main issue is that range has a major advantage in avoiding damage. 
---
Brutal black dragons for example. It wouldn't matter if the lance was 2x as strong as it is now, the fact you are in melee range means you can't block mage and melee damage which is a major disadvantage. (without flinching, etc.). With DHCB you can just pray mage and sit back.
---
Hydra, Vorkath, Wyverns, Brutals, etc. etc. etc. You're better off ranging them because of this.
---
Sure, you can melee them. But it's most likely not going to be as efficient.
---
So.. After writing that I decided to do some DPS comparisons
---
Max gear, max combat, pots + prayer for both styles. Super antifire with avernic defender for melee and buckler for range.
---
Assuming off task.
---
Note: Arma for range and elite void DPS in ( )
---
Vork: Lance 9.8 vs DHCB 9.5 (10.3)
---
KBD: Lance 6.5 vs DHCB 7.0 (7.1)
---
BBD: Lance 7.0 vs DHCB 7.2 (7.4)
---
Rune: Lance 7.4 vs DHCB 6.0 (5.7)
---
Addy: Lance 7.5 vs DHCB 6.0 (5.8)
---
Steel: Lance 7.7 vs DHCB 6.9 (7.0)
---
Iron: Lance 8.2 vs DHCB 7.3 ( (7.5)
---
Skeletal Wyvern: Lance 7.6 vs 7.6 (7.9)
---
Looking at the numbers, there's not that much difference DPS wise. Vorks 9.8 vs 10.3 is only a 5% (0.5 dps)increase in DPS. Which yeah, is significant over 1000s of kills but not as big of a gap as I thought it would be.
---
BBD, you would probably still range even if is was a 1-2 DPS increase with a lance.
---
All metal dragons the lance is better. 
---
Wyverns it's on par with arma and barely worse than void
---
I do agree though that range is the meta for a lot of current bosses but I think there's 2 problems
---
1. The last couple of major bosses have been Dragons = DHCBscape
---
2. TBow is OP.
---
I hope they start making a few bosses where range isn't BIS. Whether it's similar to corp where range does 50% damage, or it's a boss where melee or even magic is the meta.
---
Authenticator? 
---
I love it
---
I guess the purpose could be that it functions as a overlap weapon between abyssal whip and ghazri rapier for melee training.
---
&gt; blow by
---
I see what you did there 
---
And that's okay. It does look cool but I wonder if we really need to fill a small gap between 2 weapons who are exactly the same. The other question is, if we want it, do we want it to come from a monster which already has good and unique drops?
---
I feel like this community and jagex can come up with way better ideas than "the hydra tail is dead content so let's infuse it with a whip to make a bone whip." Just my opinion though. 
---
Reading through your comments sounds like you share accounts and one of your friends decided to fuck you. There was no hacking involved if you voluntarily gave them your info.
---
Never trust anyone. 
---
diD yOu TaLk tO oZiak?
---
For the quest you can just hide in the room before and let Nieve beat the crap out of them then you go in and last hit. Check out slayermusiq’s guide for the specifics.
---
Ive used it after everytime i get the account back, you can still recover an account that has an authenticator on it
---
I believe so, don't remember 100%.
---
It's actually like 13/14 dollars if your a kiwi. 
---
Bad bot
---
Yay, but the flipside is that bouncing is what stimulates its body, in other words it's not as if it ever gets tired of bouncing or wants to take a break.
---
So just to confirm I read this correctly, dig them up and replant is the superior option here?
---
Had a bit to drink tonight and don't want to get my information wrong :p
---
Yeah not much of a record because 85 combat is a requirement and it's pretty using getting quest came with that combat level
---
In the long run you're better off just going with the new account. It will suck in the short term but it will save if you spent the next year or whatever and then get locked out.
---
If he's recovered it in the past, he's probably going to be able to going forward. There's not really any way to block him from being able to do it.
---
Runecrafting should be one of the genies since they come out of lamps and so does rcing xp
---
Nah squirtle is best fit for fire making 
---
prob shouldn't buy or sell accs bud
---
sexy lopunny housewife for cooking or riot
---
Honestly you'll probably get bullied with such low HP. 75 attack pures below 82 combat are basically seen as free smites. Get range to 99 and strength to 92+ at least so your HP will be in the low to mid 90s. Then yea, it's a great account. 
---
Big brainers know it’s the obby cape
---
Thanks for the credit; these are so good! Would love this design if we do end up getting the whip.
---
going on the meme of the month calendar for sure
---
well shit
---
this whole problem originated because of dragonbone necklaces being useless lol jagex failed with this upgrade for bonecrusher necklace and so they want to use the unique drop for a whip now? dosent make any sense
---
Lol that’s what I thought 
---
Ahaha good point man 
---
cool clock ahmed, want to bring it to the white house?

I see you've played coffee notty before

Just drop all your untradables, I’d fucking quit if I had to get Elite Void again.

Thanks for doing all the work so us fucktards can be efficient. The osrs wiki is a resource every single player in this game uses nearly every time they play this game and without it honestly the game would suck in comparison.

Wtf are you special? Well fuck I just feel bad for your parents 
---
Or Metapod
---
jagex is in the UK so UK rules: cut in line and you get hit for max hp
---
If you're strictly concerned with xp, always alch unstrung longbows. Yew longbows (u) usually turn a bit of a profit and there's no buy limit like there is with most armour.
---
Mate if your account is above 50hp just bring monks and karams for the sections without gree gree and on the demon hide and let the gnomes lower to low health then finish off with whatever your highest combat skill is its legit so easy 
---
&gt; know theres questing orders for a b gloves zerker but fuggit. Just trying to play without worrying about it. Thanks
---
Just quest the defense xp and do enough RFD for rune/dragon gloves, then if you want to do the extra 67 quest points or whatever worth of quests for barrows gloves you can later. 
---
UK rules: cut the line and the line cuts you
---
Your claim now false. Discord hosts every image and video you send so there is no way before other users to know what ip uploaded it. Stop talking smack and spreading fear.

back in RS classic, NPC's could only dialogue with one player at a time so people would queue up at quest NPC's on the day of release for a new quest

---
When are you planning to do Jynx so we can go lewd?
---
You use range for 80% of cox, and then for the part you don’t use range you use mage for half of it, melee for one small part of it, and range again for the last of it, melee is really lacking in the bossing area
---
First 3 gens or you're a zoomer
---
At least morytania diary legs teleport you down there.

Uhh the only mage used in cox is mage hand changing crabs and vanguards which most people avoid, you use melee for tek, vasa, ice, olm, vang, guardians, vesp(for one method), tob is almost completely melee. Tl;dr you're wrong

Still on his P plates. Isn't he an old man?

Obviously to dig out the rest of the plant that you don't harvest

What pushed them so far up? I doubt Supreme Phantom alone was enough, since it's just one lord
---
Why does the tail have to have only one use? Why not have it for the bonecrusher necklace thing (the one in the ammo slot) AND the bone whip? At least players get to choose which they prefer and it gives players a reason not to get angry after getting 20 of them before the head lol...
---
Well, not ***as*** angry.
---
everytime I have a question its straight to the wiki. Without it, we would all be much worse players and the game would suffer.

So stupid

Do you mean splashers? Cause most ppl know that bursting is exceptionally well at clearing dust devil tasks

Doesn't for me.

Ew, what is that thing on the right? looks like a Digimon.

Most pkers are pretty bad. I had one today who was unable to kill me for my pure essence. I was wearing full graceful, an anti-dragon shield, a ring of life, a black pick axe and a glory. I was using the abyss, so I had 0 prayer and no way to heal myself. He didn’t even trigger my ring of life and I was able to laugh at him all the way to the abyss teleport.
---
Watch for white dots and don’t afk. Don’t risk too much and you’ll be fine.
---
Any golden tenches along the way?
---
Cactus and Bushes take a few hours, but you could just treat them like dailies in this case.
---
Hardwood trees are very cheap gp/xp, but they do take multiple days to grow (85 hours for mahogany, 65 for teak)
---
Normal trees are extremely expensive compared to fruit trees, Maple trees cost 12gp/xp right now, compared to Palm trees 5gp/xp right now (and to make that even worse...Yew and Magic trees cost even more than Maple, and Palm is the MOST expensive tree right now, at least until we know what Dragonfruit will settle at long term)
---
I'd only do regular trees if you got the seeds for free from nests and are just looking for bonus xp, even then, unless you're looking to get that 99 quick, I'd just sell them and buy more fruit tree seeds. Definitely don't buy them to plant them.

Imagine not knowing line cutting is a criminal offence in England punishable by public lashings 
---
do this til pet pls
---
the best way to do it is to aggro all of them, then run into an area with 2 corners (the middle, far left of your picture for example)
---
Then just run back and forth from corner to corner. But doing this you're running thru the devils, causing them to be able to walk through each other, and stack. To make this process either, go into your Options &gt; Controls &gt; NPC 'attack' options &gt; always right-click
---
This will allow you to spam click the 2 corners quickly without the devils getting in the way.
---
Turn your auto-retaliate on so that as Devils die you don't have to keep re-clicking to keep casting.

To be fair free trade was definitely the main reason. But the crater was just poorly designed and with the whole tank timer for picking up loot? Just bloody dumb. 
---
Also have to think, I probably played in a different era than you so my opinion is gonna be biased to that. But even so the crater had lots of flaws. A re worked crater then maybe I could see that but I'm pretty sure it would be dead content. Whats the point of having those BH armors? They wouldnt really hold value if the content went dead. 
---
Just dont think it would strive in this era IMO.

I bought the 10 inch Amazon Fire HD for $80 and it's great! Gotta do a little work around to get it installed, but the work around is easy and it's well worth it. The only reason I got it is for OSRS mobile.

Very helpful. Thanks man

Appreciate it!

Lol what a stupid thing to want.

Hey everyone,

Thanks to who have upvoted. I can't stop but wondering why the reddit post here turned out like it did. I agree with most on here, but this post was meant to be fun and giggles, and honestly i didn't even expect more than 10 upvotes. 
---
Little disclaimer: My fingers are alright and they are not made of sponge, \*cheer in restoration pool\*

Oo! How's the framerate in crowded areas?

Quest. Either for varrows or for some key rewards like unlocking travel methods, tears of guthix etc. And let that guide your trainung for a while. Getting all easy then medium diaries aswell etc.
---
Go for base 40 or 50 for a start perhaps? Atm though if I were you Id get access to canifis and grind agi to 40 then do canifis for full graceful/ lvl 60 then try to do Underground Pass - unlocking Ibans Staff early is a huge voon because its going to be your BiS mage weapon for a long time. Getting the 200k to upgrade it is really very worth it.

Catherby and seers village.  Such a magic place after trekking over white wolf mountain as a kid.

If you're worried about the moss giant just kill sand crabs or chickens til you've got higher HP.

Revants buy magic short bow en kill it skulled
---
Why does it have to be a whip copy? :/
---
I'm honestly not savvy enough to tell you specific numbers or anything, but I can say that I haven't experienced any sort of issues in largly crowded areas, however I can also say I haven't been to wintertodt or blast furnace on it. 
---
I'm sorry, I'm very much an old man at heart so don't know much about the techy details, but I can say the only difference between my laptop and the Fire Tablet is that the table has worse resolution. I wish I could just let you try it out, maybe someone you know has one you could try? 
---
pokemon fans autism knows no bounds
---
If you’re hitting an average of 9/10 per patch, that’s the sweet spot
---
Already got 200k in the bank from wintertodt! That all sounds good. Where can I start training agility? Or should I quest to level it up first? It's been actual years since I've trained agility from a fresh start lol

There's actually a great podcast J1mmy's channel, called Bankstanding, really nice to listen to while playing.

I dont play the game anymore, just came across this from the front page but man, pokemon was the only game that pulled me away from Runescape way back when. So I absolutely love this.
---
Gonna keep tabs on it, sweet work!
---
I use it for wasd camera controls.
---
Does it just make the click spots a little less finicky?

I thought it was a open-air outhouse when I first saw her. 
---
Very nice :)
---
Does it still do middle mouse button for that as well? Been my favorite little tweak after years of not playing. 
---
but... how does the hydra's tail relate to the lore of gods?
---
the alchemical hydra was made by dragonkin
---
Mos Le Harmless for sure. I love the pirate quest lines and the trouble brewing mini game. 
---
Yup
---
Wtf are half of these Pokémon. Some new shit?
---
Honestly I think all these issues would’ve been solved if the lance was bis at hydra and hydra had a high range defence. Then it would actually be as useful as the dhcb.

Hello. If you are not aware, the osrs wiki has moved here: https://osrs.wiki/Wyrms. The Wikia wiki is not being edited by the vast majority of players anymore. See here: https://osrs.wiki/RS:FIND for tips to correctly find the wiki.

This is the map that bots use to program locations and such.

Spite voting all pk updates btw.

Deserve cancer for killing someone in a game. Right. Appropriate username. 
---
Key features for me are GPU plugin (offloads rendering from CPU, allows to see further) + stretched mode plugin (increases the size of UI) for playing on bigger monitor, and examine-item showing GE prices. RL has metric ton of various addons, but personally I find them to just bloat my gameplay experience.
---
I just used adamant.
---
All the time, \~115k/hr more in runes compared to trident that is made up in 1 kill
---
So, do i go hunting for all these plugins or are they mostly built in toggles? 
---
I should try that again, I was struggling with addy darts to start learning (only 22KC) and then I found out that there was super antifire and that helped a ton so might try them again. Thanks for the quick response!
---
People actually care what nationality server theyre playing on? news to me fella
---
Built in

Im at 800 kc with only 2/3 ring pieces

Until he does one small favour

Alright, thank ya i guess I'll be checking it out after work here shortly. 
---
Never claimed was unfair I admitted mistake just was after forgiveness 
---
1. No yellow text black background 
---
2. Suck ass idea
---
Yup I tried it. And it's shit unless I hit my bgs specs really well. I actually tried it with void setup and it did compete at times with bp, had a few under 2 min kills. But it still ate up a ton of food and ofc, it needed good bgs specs.
---
Luckily I was able to flip the Lance and just buy a dhcb after selling some of my bank 
---
Life is good now with dhcb lol, thing is nuts. Just the fact I don't have to waste so much time landing a bgs spec is so relaxing
---
It highlights the tile you need to click on. Makes a world of difference. 
---
This exact meme made the front page like 4 days ago damn.

That's very helpful, thank you!

But world of warcraft already exists

---
Go t5rain one some golbins
---
I've made it a habit to go bank the time i wouldve said one more kill, and everytime i come back a clan has cleared the world
---
Just curious, were you using it with melee void on Vorkath? 
---
Dragon darts are 3k each there's no universe where they're worth at vorkath
---
100% don't need more another whip, there's already two. Why not make some lower tier weps from bone materials. 
---
This makes me happy 
---
Ok wasn’t sure if it made a difference that I kept most of them or not. Wasn’t sure if the speed difference made it worth while or not. Figured not but didn’t want to be doing it wrong forever. 
---
Wait really?
---
I agree with it struggling to thrive. But I also loved the idea of PVP worlds and PVP loot. I feel like it can make PKing much more rewarding, especially when almost everyone risks about 26k. The point of the armors would give you more of an advantage when getting a penalty for looting. Now you could loot it and tank if need be. Since you could have 120hp and stronger armor. Or even use it to have an advantage during regular fights. You wouldn't get a penalty for looting when you kill your target, just for when you kill someone who isn't your target.
---
Just do barbarian fishing till 99 &amp; you'll have like 70 str &amp; agility to start off 
---
yeah but why  does it matter is my point. if i go on a german server i dont care, no ones speaking german there the majority of the time, american servers have next to no ping and its the other side of the ocean from me. you spend the majority of your time world hopping to find a quiet spot anyway.  
---
also saying rs3 has something really doesnt fly on here lmao
---
or 1m xp/h mahogany benches

The title makes it sound like you killed it solo, not with the help of another account.

Yeah unless jagex makes it so you cant use recoveryquestions your sol.

I lagg so much when passing this post...

Ouch reeeepost

Because right now it's 100% useless.

I did see a little Tekton somewhere I'm pretty sure.

When you use Runelite so much you forget what items look like.
---
thank you for doing this, else alot of information about the new farming update wouldve been unknown to me :)
---
NO THIS IS PATRICK!!!!!!!!
---
Because right now it only sells for the alch value and jagex wanted to lower the alch value but not cause the item to crash into oblivion

Stupid thought experiment, I wonder how much money Phials makes a day. He's got to be rolling In it

I'm in awe of the size of this client. Absolute unit

Does the new Kronos seed also decrease the chance of your patch dying since there's less growth stages, or did they code around this? The Kronos seed gives you a chance of skipping a growth stage and patches have a chance of getting diseased at the end of every growth stage. If this is the case, the Kronos might actually be better at preventing disease than the Iasor seed.
---
Watering ensures that it'll go to the next growth stage without diseasing.  
---
But iirc, the planted =&gt; first stage never diseases, so watering is useless.
---
Lumbrigr

True but does hydra need to drop a third near BIS thing? it already drops the claw (BIS CoX), leather (BIS ToB and slayer), and the ring (BIS CoX?) which are all quite useful. making it drop a 4th near BIS item seems excessive to me
---
Join the runelite Discord and ask there, they should be able to help.
---
haha trust me bro i have 70 agility and still need the run restore. just wear graceful it looks sexy anyway
---
How are you going to get nails in a ball of steel though?

Achievement diaries are expensive, I bought both the tuber and the shield half in the same day when i was trying to grind out diaries, was so close till I saw the rc requirement of ardy, been 6 months since then and I'm still 50k xp off of the reqs

Dope.
---
He DWH specced it like 20 times and poisoned it with blowpipe on his main
---
I mean, he did have his main tank kbd while his Ironman killed it. It's still impressive but not "no help of any kind" 
---
How
---
Whoever does the quick guides for quests is the real MVP.
---
Great job by everyone involved.
---
Dragon plate (from lumps), dragon kite, and dfs require smithing to combine. Without t we wouldnt have these finished items just the resource visages and lumps then. Thats a start 
---
He wouldn’t be able to see the loot before the KBD respawned though? 
---
And surely that much damage would mean that the kill wasn’t his. 20 DWH specs should easily take more than 50% of his hp 
---
I think the pet drop is generated at the XP drop. So it's still just a single chance as the XP will combine.
---
Boys it’s an wool over coat and skinny jeans 
---
So, with this completely 'out there's knowledge going against the grain of literally every game ever, what game company do you work for in which you design animations for that are all different?
---
I mean, you wouldn't happen to be a no name that has no idea what they're talking about on reddit would you? 
---
Oh wait, you most likely are. Every game shares assets between animations in one way or another. Its rare you find a game with completely new animations for each individual weapon type with absolutely no overlap. If you did it's most likely a game where visuals come before gameplay. 
---

No email notification. 2nd time in 2 months.

Hydra already drops the dragon hunter lance. It shouldn't drop every bis weapon in the game lol.
---
Oh, it didn't bother me. I was more annoyed at the fact it was stated he stopped working on the quest.
---
Ive seen people going at ape atoll and wildy courses so probably not efficient anymore to go werewolf course anymore.
---
I posted youtube link in the comments.
---
Bots program bots?
---
Hey great job. Major milestone there! 
---
Should this include having partners for slayer? If they stand alone why do they get help from alts
---
Yes right. Much more effort than ape atoll though?
---
Yeah where is the upvotes for this... OP did the sin first

Wouldn't mage only be better since 2/3 phases you want mage and 1/3 you want ranged? 
---
Surprised he got off you. I wouldve finished you regardless of your pleas.
---
“Ah yep” begs every single day, he takes money by begging and feeds it to his main account.
---
He has even been seen bragging about making millions off begging. That’s why he was being shamed by everyone.
---
I'm all for a crush weapon that's worse than blud but better than hasta, but making it the 2nd best weapon for melee slayer (after rapier) seems very close to BIS to me
---
Gardevoir's a lot like a guardian angel but I would prefer Shedinja personally.
---
There's clan chats where you can talk to everyone else in there, other than that there's no inbuilt system.
---
Enable 2 factor on email and runescape account
---
Only if you search for pages related to the update.
---
this is great
---
I imagine Gardevoir as a better candidate for magic with Alakazam as runecrafting. You could have alakazam look pretty badass doing the RC emote.
---
So then there are still 2 unique drops that are useful which is more than vorkath has. 
---
You don't know what is.
---
There's a reason they disappear after running away and it's not logging out.
---
Meanwhile I've had my account since it's started and I haven't broken 20m XP yet
---
When you switch weapons it defaults to the style that was under the previous one. I believe there is a runelite plug-in that hides the ones you select to be hidden though

Ya i mean there are 20+ char farms that are online for weeks... but they ban someone who sells manually to a couple of people
---
Not completely sure if you knew this, but the game will combine multiple stacks of coins into one large stack on the floor, so it wouldn't show up as two separate drops. 
---
dick move if you don't tbh
---
any gear left over? try doing some Bandos if so.
---
if you only got low gear but barrows tabs and do a few runs till you can gear up for Bandos imo.

Alskazam for magic

You should be receiving email of request of changing password/emails almost instantly from jagex. If the email came late then you should check  the email thoroughly.
---
If you are using Gmail, you can actually check easilly if it is spoofed. If for example the email was sent via "sendgrid.net" or not signed by jagex.com then you can tell the email is spoofed. Idk about other email provider though.
---
Since you've said that people are trying to compromise your email, I highly recommend for you to revamp everything to new email/password, everything! Gl my mate, don't be like me, I got hijacked and lost all my bank, you can see my previous thread.

I never said they don't still exist, just that they were discontinued and are not given to users. And subreddit specific shadowbans have never been a thing ever. If you can't see your comments then they were removed by a moderator, or hit the spam filter which means you would have included a banned link in your post or were removed by a bot modreator for whatever reason, such as a banned word.

And the messed up part is I wasn't being greedy or anything charging 50k a kill when some ironmen pay over 300k. I wasn't killing myself or anything. I saw a loophole and acted. bullshit they can just claim its "real world trading" just to slap me. I wish jmods would talk to people ingame about things before they acted so quickly like this. if a mod came to me and said "hey we don't like what your doing could u please stop?" my response would have been nothing but love and reassurance that they would never have me in their hair again.

Could the unf addy bolts on the konar table be swapped out for addy bars? This way people can either sell, make unf addy bolts or addy darts. I have used thousands of addy darts on hydras, unf addy bolts are pretty useless for higher cb players

Fletching, someone recently got 99 fletching in just over (4 hours)[https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aazu0n/world_record_fastest_99_in_runescape/?st=JR50IG15&amp;sh=60ec7da0]
---
Fletching addy darts gives around 3m xp/hr which means around 4 hours to get 99 from lvl 70 fletching. It costs around 60m. The guy who broke the record used dragon darts.
---
Something more reasonable is 1t cooking karambwans which is also very fast (I think around 1m xp/hr which means ~13 hours to 99). This is actually profitable but it’s fairly click intensive

Unless you've already finished that clue step, then it's "can you kill me please?" for the free tele back to Camelot 
---
Man that was such good fun, really disappointed last year's April fools was so shit.
---
its funny you mention that, because we made chili potatos last week for that very reason lol. And yes, butter on the potato, and cheese on the chili made it so much better :)
---
Stupid question but: if you want to get someone banned and are going to social media about it, why would you block out their names???? Seems a tad counter productive.
---
Oh boy. Good luck. http://services.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/archive?oldschool=1&amp;year=2013&amp;month=1
---
Basically a lot has changed (5 years of developing), but it's mostly new content and fixing old content. The dev team is very aware of power creep and balancing, so the general OSRS feel is still mostly intact
---
Idk what you’re on about. It’s just the poor man’s abyssal tentacle.

60 attack meds are dominant for all types of PVP currently. However a 75 attack pure becomes the meta for their own combat level for any NH past level 20. There, zerks lose most of their advantages like torso, void and vengeance. Toxic staff is also incredible for pure bridding. 
---
Lol i mined iron for about 4 or 5 hours last night and made about 830k in iron like 5000 some odd ore, i fucking love mining iron ore lol. Went from lvl 61 to 67 or so.
---
So you're saying it is allowed to use programs like AHK if it's 1:1?
---
Loot?
---
Or Beheeyem would work too!
---
Infinity boots
---
where do i redeem the code?
---
Check his bank boys. I smell a merch :think:
---
It absolutely does, but at the same time, we shouldn't rely on it to be a safeguard against pointless "just for the sake of it" items and updates. The game should not be designed or balanced around ironmen. 
---
Leek
---
pretty sure it’s still just as efficient if you add 3 more rooms making it 3x3, so you can add in things like armor stand and menagerie without increasing load time 
---
Word
---
Do Golem or Gigalith for mining! Or you could do Aegislash for smithing, cause he's a sword and shield?
---
[deleted]
---
If you are using the default movements and you're just changing the key that does the action you're fine
---
yep its actually pretty accurate now. Almost as accurate as full ancestral+arcane (if u have void+arcane), but obviously it has less damage.
---
Digango in draynor . Just right click and type in code
---
I have a gaming mouse yes, not sure what you are implying. Could you elaborate :)?
---
How about reading the damn post? Are you starting herb runs? Don’t you have some Torstol to be farming?
---
Probably not 
---
When was that?

I don't understand how you could leave them that long. I had them in under a month on release and I wasn't even trying to get them 
---
Dude, I love you. Cant you see that?
---
quests will put you at 61 attack, if i were you i would make a new account
---
Bit unrelated but there's a bug on the mobile wiki where if I'm viewing a table of drops, the icons are there when I first scroll down, but almost immediately either dissappear, or go tiny. This appears to happen with any table that includes icons, e.g spell tables, costume wardrobes, etc
---
T
---
Yeah I think if I was to go down that route i would definitely make a new one 
---
The same people complaining about “wHiP nOsTaLgIa” are maxed melee and have a fucking blowpipe welded to their mainland because using melee isn’t even efficient for 90% of combat with the exception of bursting tasks or gargoyles. The average player can probably just barely equip and afford a whip to begin with, let alone a 3m upgrade. 
---
Just give the bone whip a high slayer requirement so it’s not a buyable upgrade. The components it’s made of are only acquirable starting at 85 slayer, up to 95 slayer. Give it a slayer requirement that reflects this, to craft the bone whip. Problem solved.  
---
Goodbye. 
---
He knows what he's about.

Mmm, could be also some personal trigger or something lol

Please make a variant of the last phase, the colors can be copied from the ferocious gloves with that bluish teal looking color. I would get that one instantly

Goodbye

Your basically hit the nail on the head. Not just with weapons, Ironman utilize a lot of otherwise dead content. Ironmen use dscim and rune cbow for a long time. 1850 total btw.
---
You need your name displayed in case you forget where you are?
---
Huge thanks to anyone who reached out in the comments or pms or added me in game from my last post! I’ve enjoyed chatting with those of you that I have in game, and the support from this community really has been so awesome to see. &lt;3
---
Their alc value was 900k so wasn’t too risky 
---
Anything that has higher mage def I guess, whether because it's out of his budget or he doesn't have any requirements? Could be an iron man without chaps etc. 
---
Wot, runelite has that too? Im downloading as soon as i get home today
---
I’m interested by the r-squared of the negative correlation you found between length and skip.
---
Good work :)
---
Are you me? cuz this is me
---
The fandom wikia has a much better layout. It takes too long for my eyes to move across the screen with the wiki and is an ugly booger color.
---
this is gold, you're trash
---
I just did mine yesterday. Worth 100%!
---
I gotchu, thx !
---
Ain't seeing a suggestion here.
---
Cutebone for slayer
---
Just curious where it's been confirmed. 
---
&gt;a dark sense of humor
---
ah, so an asshole?
---
Your load times will be slower if you build up a level or down a level, even if you keep the same number of rooms as me. If you want to go with the lowest load times, you can do a 3x3 layout all on the surface level.
---
yeah dude I don't think I ever used more than 1/3 of my bank spots on my Rs2 account I played for 8 years.
---
yea if youre looking down and hes wearing a  cockring
---
I keep seeing things like this, like at vorkarth, but you don't really have to line up right? It's just funny to look at
---
Max gear with tbow: 1:28

Gimme dat neck boi

---
There’s entire guides on minimizing load time.  It’s more complicated than just how many floors you have.  But floors should double the amount of rooms loaded.
---
Cuz hunter is cancer
---
I mean. True, but debatable.
---
I didn't take notes so I'm going based on memory here:  
---
Used to have like... \~5+ sec load time in my monsterous 3x7 house w/ a dungeon.  
---
It quickly got (almost) halved when i moved it all into a 4x4 still w/ dungeon as I wanted to bang out 99 cons before getting rid of it.
---
Once I fit everything on the ground floor 4x4, my current load time is around 1.8-2.4 sec from clicking the outside portal to when the loading screen disappears. Getting rid of that 0.6-1.2 sec made all the difference from wanting to use direct tele tabs to just taking my cons cape everywhere. I could be saving a total of 10 minutes in my entire life, but it's still worth it to me as it's much less annoying.
---
Around there, yeah
---
420 blaze it homie 😂😂😂 time to light myself a fat ass bowl rn 😂😂😂😂
---
I'm curious to how often you get low times like that, cause if you're using the same gear and walking the fire when you hit it idk what i'm doing different.
---

I think you mean hell but seeing as how you are spewing garbage along with some serious messed up grammar, I invite you to crawl back into the cave from which you crawled out of this weekend.
---
P I P P E L I
---
I agree with nmz but if you're referring to the wilderness resource area I think its pretty balanced. If anything it could give a buff for mining and woodcutting to balance the risk
---
I would if I had the gear :(

Which Pvm is it worth having d claws for?

I don’t get it

Will wait for your guide lmao
---
Very nicely made :)
---
All you need is blowpipe and void armor. Zulrah is way more expensive lol. 
---
What are the rewards 
---
The game really doesn't need another anything. Let's stop having updates it's a completed game.

So you made somewhere near 1-1.8b off rangers alone?! Brb gonna do 10k med clues real quick
---
Should've alched the wine.
---
Kowalski, analysis!
---
You're right. I retested it and didn't see much difference.
---
You need to learn vorkath ? Lol don’t you just need to learn wooz walk if you want efficiency Vorkath is a joke boss and to much profit for no learning curve. 
---
I get the idea of iconic weapons but osrs takes it to the next level. I mean weve been using this thing for 13 years would it actually kill the game to have some options? That being said I like the idea of a bone flail more as we desperately need some more 1h crush weapons
---

&amp;nbsp;
---
^^I'm ^^a ^^bot.^bleep^bloop
---
They said before talking about any bluffs that they were going to lower the alch value so when you bought these for 900k they already had said they were lowering alch value to 90k I think it was
---
Yeah, same. Careful though, you'll get downvoted if you call them out on shit memes.
---
GIVE EM THE CLAP!
---
You underestimate the power of human dedication. I legit alched all the way from \~80 magic to 99. I even made sure to profit from it. (my chair is so sweaty)
---
I never received a single survey in like a year from that.
---
Not available in my country :(
---
These are absolutely perfect, your style is phenomenal.
---
Just saying, Charizard for firemaking would light my fire.  👀
---
If you stand alone you're not allowed to use reddit or the wiki
---
&gt; The high alch price of the Hydra tail is currently 900,000 GP which is far higher than we feel it ought to be. However, we are aware that without being tied to something else, it is likely to fall in price substantially after we lower the alch value. With this in mind, we are going ahead with a reduction in the high alch price but would like to offer the following. 
---
    
---
This is from their blog, if they had changed the alch value without releasing the bone whip idea...you would have been fucked lol. You got lucky. Even the chance of the bone whip passing right now doesn't seem that great. 
---
Or telling people about your visage 
---
Possibly. Only reason is because it’s a dragon, I think it would represent the slayer skill better 
---
Ya I get dlong'd all day too my man
---
Mood
---
I took an edible on a car ride a few weeks ago. Freaked out, thought I was a schizophrenic, then puked out the window while the car while was moving. 10/10 would do again. 
---
That's not quite true, there are quite a few Bosses locked into single player. Zulrah, Vorkath, all the slayer bosses (Cerb, Sire, Guardian etc.) And some that are pseudo locked: Crazy Archaeologist for example.
---
I would love to see the ability to open a "Multis" instance of Zulrah or Vorkath, obviously would need a severely nerfed drop rate on uniques, and maybe across the board so me and my brothers could do more stuff together. 
---
(Edit: Misinterpreted your comment as "is going toward single player" instead of "should go towards single player." Sorry about that!)
---
lol
---
But it looks boring :( does having a lot of stuff makes it slower to load?
---
The wiki is amazing my dude. You guys did an awesome job and you contributed so much to the community
---
&gt;not basic stone
---
What an elitist
---
Number of the beast! #UpTheIrons
---
&gt; I predicted that they would make a change to make it more useful rather than lower the alch value...!  
---
They already gave their suggestion in that blog, it was a bone crusher you would equip in the ammo slot. It would have been just as useless as the other item. 
---
&gt; Should combining a Hydra tail with the Bonecrusher produce an item with the Bonecrusher effect that can be equipped in the ammo slot? 
---
Ye it’s overpriced as shit gl

basically anything that can't be crystal hally specced, or where another spec isnt better (eg dwh / bgs, arclight, blowpipe / sgs)

Right on no worries, I've had a few posts where people tell me im not the first, just posting things when I see them I'm not too keen on keeping up with every picture on Reddit 
---
You certainly can, however most guides on youtube ask you to move across the bridge or find some safe spot. 
---
By doing it this way you don't have to move and pray right there without the risk of a melee attack from the demon.
---
Man we did this on day 1. Shame on you Karma farming 
---
I thought about doing this myself with them being at alch price but then decided not to as I wasn't sure how long I'd need to hold them. You made the right decision!

---
What? 
---
I agree and it's why I am voting no to the poll. Tbh I'd be happy if all hydra tail did was create a 70 attack variant of the whip that is crush style instead, and if they redid the skin the current one is ugly. Hydra tail is not even the drop people are chasing so I am confused as to why it is getting so much time in the spotlight.
---
Not much you can do, change password, make sure you have a Authenticator, etc, rip

Fair enough! Looking forward to more regardless of who's selected for them all!

Only 41 combat but ended up dealing with Wildy hellhounds pretty easily in about two hours safespotting. I think I’ll do a normal slayer for a bit though.
---
I have a youtube video (linked in the comments here) with full prep &amp; kill.
---
No failed attempts, only got killed once on alt while speccing down kbd.
---
Lol someone’s got a chip on their shoulder

I have tbow so technically I get head for free.

You use 1000-1500 bones or 1500-1700 planks per hour if you use Phials. Since it costs 5gp per item Phials makes 5-8k per player per hour. At peak hours let's say there are 1000 players using Phials. So he should be making 5-8m gp/hr at peak times.

---
My poh is very similar, except I added the menagerie (as storing pets in the poh frees up bank space), the combat ring room (to overcharge my prayer with the ancient mace using the combat dummy), and the workshop to grab a spade in case I need one fast.
---
Besides that I spent some extra gp on opulent rugs and stuff :) 
---
&gt; Jagex content creators are very good at their jobs. Or that is to say, Jagex is really good at polling successful content.
---
or are the players really good at voting for anything that makes the game easier without regard for anything else?

Took your advice and did hellhounds without much pain at 41 combat. Still debating but think I’ll lvl up my CB before returning

DMM I am guessing, probably making sure the Jed situation doesn't happen again.
---
Konar? Is that the wildy slayer?
---
I like it, but I would prefer a seasonal aspect added to it. Basically you would only be able to trade other "mithrilmen" created during the same season, and they could start a new season every 3 to 6 months. You would still be able to play on the account after the season ends, but no one could make a new account that could trade with you. My reasoning is if it just one big mode after probably 6 months it would just be a regular main that can't use the GE. 
---
At its core it's a very simple combat system which is what a lot of people like.
---
High level PVM and PvP is a bit different as it includes more mechanics. Prayers, dodging, speccing, position, changing between combat styles and gear, etc. 
---
I had everything set. I’m just fucking pissed because it was a Q&amp;A link from the devs.had allot of views too. Must have been a fish link on twitch from a fake account

Prayer xp?

Have you tried regular diamond e and ruby e? If so how do they compare? Im just broke af after buying dhc, but if those recommended bolts are that much better i can get em

&gt;not using myths guild bank
---
Happy cake day!!
---
N-word
---
Remember that 300k drop you got? This drop was to make up for that one.
---
because he's luck to have hit the drop table 4 times in 10 chests and apart from a dh helm the drops blow hard
---
I changed "change" to "chance" on a wiki page, when can I expect my salary to come?
---
Reduce hydra tail drop rate to 1/1k like the claw so it has more room to value up like you want
---
That being said getting a mid level item up to those prices is going to be extremely difficult because it's not BiS, and rapier is expensive because of the BiS premium
---
Pretty sure its best to switch later, at 250 hp.
---
Firemaking better be Chandelure
---
A roll on the old Konar droptable
---
It seems perfectly fine to me. It requires you to boost multiple times to plant and check the tree, requires you to use your one and only spirit tree slot at that level, requires you to actually have a seed, and then you still need to boost to 85+ farming to use the unique patches within the area. 
---
I also planted this tree at level 80 through the use of a spicy stew, but was 82 farming by the time I checked it (thanks to some Tithe Farm) meaning I could already access the area easily using garden pies.
---
There's definitely a shit load of stoners on RS. I don't hear too many people talking about being drunk but it might be a culture thing.
---
Oh, and does the vorkath accumulator save any of the dragon bolts? Or are every single one of them lost after they leave yoir dhc?
---
Only make an altar if you're a host or ironman. For mains it's just better to use a host's altar since you don't bother with keeping these things burning for extra prayer xp.
---
Zucc'd
---
Ill try both
---
Jagex can make their own cost-benefit analysis I'm sure. Why is that up to you?
---
60 attack for edge/bh stuff, 75 for deep wild and nhing 
---
Make it something like 1 time unlock and than there is nothing. Like a patch of high weeds you can rake 1 time to. Remove forever if u got the reqs(not sure how engine work that is) 
---
Be careful when you download it that you don't download a phishing one. 
---
No workshop? No altar for hosting? Not even a kitchen for fun friends meeting? Man...
---
I've tried everything, even had my gallbladder removed, but it's still a problem. :( At this point, managing pain is about the best I can do. 
---
Thank god for mobile.
---
That would also be pretty cool but mismagius has a hat.
---
God dhide would be a good the, prayer bonus does matter here but Arma is like 3 ranged accuracy over bdhide so they are basically the same offensively
---
Doesn’t matter when you have neither anyway :)
---
But most of us both
---
Well they wouldn't have to train it. It's not like diaries where it offers much bigger rewards to areas of the game.
---
I'm sorry, I know it can be unbearable. I hope you have a good support system :(
---
That helmet fits 3 heads
---
Have enough cash for some budget zulrah
---
True I should say dead content or content that quickly becomes obsolete
---
Finally getting enough points for rune pouch on the ironman today. Also might get 85 slayer if I really grind hard.
---
It sucks they should buff it to 100% drop chance of Konar table and no loots less than 100m ea
---
Diaries led to people asked for faster/easier ways to train skills. Before dairies people only trade skills if they enjoyed it
---
That would be awesome, if you do so, make sure you share it with me. I have not played around with any of Audodesks products yet, however I would like to one day. Just started out with Blender :)!
---
Yeah I don't think anyone is "Afraid" of anything except the BEWILDERING, retarded time investment.  I'm sure if you're an under-employed/unemployed early 20s dude trying to relieve your nostalgic trip where you have hours and hours to play everyday then maybe ironman is cool
---
But for others that have fulltime jobs/ a myriad of other commitments in life, it's pretty ridiculous to think about playing a solo-only variant of the most grind-heavy, time consuming MMO on the market that's 20 years old, lol.   Runescape iron man is absolutely not worth the time investment of your life on the planet earth (We're talking like months if not years of playtime), unless you really have that much free time/absolutely nothing to aspire to in life lol.
---
When you don't have one so you try to shit on people who do
---
They should need to cause this is rs 
---
The more you use the rs wiki the sooner the wikia will stop appearing first. The continued use of it is whats keeping it first.
---
Dude is 600m total xp, you can't really be surprised he doesn't know how to socialize or interact with others.
---
So I’ve heard lol this dose is actually quite nice tho to be honest other mota shit I have tried barely works 
---
Can someone tell me what the hell a bone whip is or is supposed to be? Not an active player but I've seen some discussion about it
---
Thinking about doing the crafters guild next, since it has been something that has always been a meaningful location to me. 
---
Use the two tap feature
---
That's just a animation stall. The game can't have you doing the getting hit animation and the running animation at the same time. You're actually still running just as fast as you normally are.
---
Once the getting hit animation is done you'll see yourself running way faster to catch up with where you actually are 
---
It’s all in a good joke and fun lol seerz is alright.
---
How many memberships/accounts did this take?
---
Snorlax is runecrafting. You know, because it’s so slow? 
---
They dont "need" too but when you add rewards to training skills which people don't enjoy, they want the rewards. Then they ask for easier training methods since they don't enjoy the skill. 
---
Why not both?
---
Not fake. This is the beta test for Blackman Mode. It's like normal RS but city guards are aggressive
---
If you are new to bossing I would personally recommend a tele tab, as they are a one click teleport. But the ardy cloak works too I suppose. You could also just buy a few tele tabs so you can get right into it. Before I start recommending bosses I think you should give Obor a shot. Once you use all of the keys you have on him, you could move on to moss giants and kill Bryophyta. If I were you, I would Wiki (not wikia) both Obor and Bryophyta and compare the drop tables to see which is better for you. I’m not sure which of the two is more difficult, bryophyta might be more annoying to deal with I’m not sure. Do you have any friends to play with who might go bossing with you? If so I might have one more recommendation. And yeah having higher stats will always help, for example if you get protect from melee and Ibans blast you can basically do Barrows 
---
Imagine not getting favour by raking weeds anyway 
---
Uhhh there's a problem here. You see the ge prices are not up to date and many Skilling methods that are high in quantity but low in margins can be wildly off. sapling growing, dart making, potions are all subject to this
---
Didn’t cubones mom die from poachers 
---
Yo nice repost dude
---
Jagex already made that, with the joke being more subtle: DarkScape
---
Just mushtree to option 4 (the mushroom forest thing with birdhouses). There's a storage just northeast of there
---
May as well just buy BCP with those prices. 
---
No, you can't.

People say start slayer at 85 combat for nieve but thats only if you're doing efficiencyscape. I think that if you want to train your combat stats and are tired of rock/sand crabs or nightmare zone you can start slayer whenever you want to spice the training up.
---
Really like the idea of adding a harder variant!
---
Damn you act like the girl in the meme is your ex or something. Chill
---
Good layout. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like your Tip Jar is making you take extra steps to the Rejuvenation Pool
---
The game is so prone to 'no-lifing' that runescape amongst other games takes on the 'living in mom's basement' mantra. I don't really care, everyone plays video games. I'll be playing games til the day I die.
---
It probably needs to be 2 handed to match  the design of Verac's flail, and not outperform Bludgeon when not combined with the defender
---
Yeah that does sound like you are on the lucky side, but that's awesome man!!
---
Something is better than nothing.
---
Pretty sure frontline used to have a high ish level ironman they'd bait with. 
---
kick his ass or report him to the authorities for theft
---
This guy followed that post about how to properly post on reddit. Nothing quite the like unncessary items in the inventory.
---
It's weird how well this describes me.
---
it might be, but god damn is this anoying to wait for this long time to do a simple quest
---
#MF
---
Or rwt
---
Shit these are low. Perfect time to cannon on my pure lol
---
Jesus. This needs to chill..
---
It’s a pretty standard training weapon. No problems with it. There are better options like the toxic staff of the dead, Sara sword, Abby dagger, and bludgeon. I think a good chunk of these have higher requirements tho
---
Steel bars have also gone from circa 690 each to around 500 in less then a couple of weeks?!
---
Catherby! My very first membership fishing spot. I remembered how excited I was as a kid to learn there was a bank near the fishing area so I never had to make long numerous trips to the bank again. Never fished at Karamja again after that. XD
---
I worship Thanos... I mean Guthix.
---
This is why you have an ignore list learn to use it
---
What if it degrades at a slower rate than tentacle?
---
Or make it part of an item set with the bonuses tied onto that?
---
Doesnt matter. Cballs take too long to make to be this cheap
---
Right, i remember better now, that horrific 2d engine with like no animations, I'd forgotten that look, before stuff like members was even a thing. Thanks for the nostalgia. 
---
MM1? Come with Fire Bolt and decent magic gear, lvl 43 prayer, 1 or two prayer pots. Run across the bridges, let the gnomes bring the Jungle demon down to 15% or so, run in, keep your distance, keep praying magic, kill him with Fire Bolt, easy.
---
Aint nobody got the time to follow a list like that.
---
pretty much mine except i have barrows stand too
---
The highest level thing shown is the ring/tree which takes 87 construction minimum with a +8 boost. You can get by with separate gardens for each of those. That'd make the Portal Nexus the highest level requirement if you went that route, and you'd need at least 84 construction with a +8 boost.
---
I mean as opposed to what else? It’s the best dps for that tier AFAIK. And even strength training barring fairly expensive options at 70 atk the d scim is the best option once again AFAIK. 
---
True, we need a second house party world
---
Just down a bottle of laxative.
---
Nah i wasnt justifying the price drop, its all bad, just saying maybe there's a correlation?!
---
all 5 slayer helms :D
---
How is bludgeon ass?
---
When everyone was using SwiftKit during RS2. 
---
Ok but for real, how the fuck do people *want* to do things with their lives and make goals? 
---
It's kinda annoying and in my opinion only worth for master clues. You can just get an obsidian platebody for -1 strength
---
Another one, another one, another one, another one
---
Haha that's great
---
Cheers for the info
---
Ok that ensures me content in using those bolts, thank you
---
Not necessarily dead. If it’s cheaper than bludgeon, I know I will use it because I know there is no way I’ll be able to afford the bludgeon for a while. Gives a good alternative for mid level accounts.
---
Thankya
---
Wha? It's free money. Set it on 100% coal, 50% herbs, deposit 1.5m and collect your free money weekly
---
Tbh if I was a uim I would leave valuables at zulrah, vorkath, ect. So at least if someone killed me nobody would get the times. But I am petty. 
---
Actually, there's two types - IBS-C is what you're thinking of. I suffer from IBS-D which is quite the opposite. 
---
Okay ill for sure use that method. Ty for valuable input
---
tl;dw?
---
Not sure why you didn't sell them. Price is already down 1m. Get on it! 
---
Btw
---
NMZ sure.... but Resource Area?
---
Spider be like FUCK OFF PKERS THIS IS MY FOOD!
---
They'd be under ironmen so they'd be bronzemen
---
Train with granite maul you’ll be 99 in no time. 
---
/s - don’t do that 
---
Just because you dont see them doesnt mean they dont exist
---
😜
---
It's one of those things players of any type ^^^^except ^^^^uim benefit from without complicated opinions on how the game's supposed to be balanced etc. So it's pretty much universally wanted 
---
Yeah but I have a life
---
Bone leash
---
Hating rs3 is dead meme. Pay some respect to your original origin god dammit leeroy
---
I 100% agree. Nothing's worse than a perfectly fine -4 day when the wind starts kicking it down to -20~
---
They’re not separate 
---
Nah its a waste to do gilded altar prayer training on an iron. You can't keep consistent burners lit because every time you leave they have to be re-lit. Better to do Ecto training especially after you get the mory hards done.
---
Drug usage eh? You must be fun at party’s 
---
Devalues my bulwark
---
I never understood this. Torso took me a total of like 5 hours. Who the hell would pay 5 mil an hour
---
Here's a suggestion for a Hydra Tail use. The Hydra tail whip and mace suggestions seem to needlessly devalue current weapons. This proposed upgrade would allow players who have obtained the Bull Roarer to upgrade the item to turn nearby mobs aggressive. This would remove the need to run in and out of areas to re-trigger aggression. This could provide a desireable utility without devaluing other items.
---
Bulwark spec already does this though
---
Hey look a spade
---
Pkers use them
---
I was having trouble figuring out which seeds to keep when pickpocketing master farmers, so I calculated the expected values of each seed (you should keep as many of the top ones as you can)
---
Like how it's common knowledge you don't have common sense?
---
Parties*. And you don't have to be under the influence of drugs to be fun at parties.
---
how come we can't kill him? It's the wilderness after all.
---
Should make bulwark drain less of the special bar but yeah i agree
---
I like this idea, kinda with they thought it through more before its release rather than releasing an item that was pretty obviously going to be useless and trying to fix there fuck up after the fact.
---
Another option I could see is make a new untradable item that drops from hydra that makes this whip but it has no stat benefits and is just a rare cosmetic item like the mutagens from zulrah.
---
Welll for things like ToB, jagex hasn’t released drop rates for them so you can’t just write a bullshit guide for it.
---
I've wanted a non-verac flail in runescape for years!! This looks amazing and hope it gets polled. Definitely needs to be weaker than bludgeon but better than hasta. 1 handed too so it can be used with defender.
---
This will be true of many things.
---
Different Fashy then.
---
Click the wrench then the lightbulb and you can turn on notification for drop over x amount. 
---
If you gave it glory stats pretty much the same amount of people would use it and it would be alch price. If you don't make it at least as good as fury no one will use it. 
---
Considered buying it myself and im cb113. will probably never get it without help cos BA is shit. Must be a decent market for it cos when i enquired there was a huge queue
---
Why downvote my comment? 
---
He's spade-shull
---
My god your a loser 
---
I hate doing those 20+ kill trips, they just take so damn long. 
---
I'm currently 61 attk/61 str/55def. I'm working on getting my d defender and fighter torso (and just got d scim). I was wondering when I should start slayer? And I have almost 8 mil in hard cash, what should I spend it on? 
---
You're*
---
why would they make the 95 slayer monster that's sort of difficult that as you said is pretty slow's whip be shittier than kraken? you can afk kraken boss with your finger in your ass at 87 slayer 
---
What if ur an HCIM that got disconnected and is trying to log back in ASAP or so?
---
Oh, I guess that makes sense. In theory that would allow more inventory spaces for brews/anglers as well.
---
For snares?  That's the only listed spell that really makes sense
---
Play main &lt;3. 
---
No kidding. Just play the game, level up, sell loot. You'll find ways to earn more money later on. Already at 400k coin profit from wintertodt when doing it a few weeks.

Better with avernic  than bludgeon u got my vote !

I've landed a new job in the past few months. It's weird having conversations with people daily. My old job consisted of cleaning out empty homes, or doing groundskeeping stuff, all alone usually. Now I'm at a water plant. I feel less bad than I did a year ago. I feel like a change is happening in my life. Maybe I am in the middle of something good, I just can't feel it yet.
---
Idk guys but this is nice.
---
Not sure on the exact numbers but it's extremely bad. You only kill these for a chance at hammer, and on task is obviously better because of the huge damage bonus from slayer helmet
---
Mine iron ore
---
I wish my barrows chest looked anything like this with morytania hard. I get maybe half of those runes or twice as many mind runes. 
---
If you use a strength attack style on your melee it turns into rapid fire when you switch to ranged, I believe if you are using defence it becomes long range. (Not 100% sure but having my staff on strength causes my throwing knives to be on rapid fire when bursting so it works there)

Chances are, if you can build this exact (50M+ gp) house, 800k gp/hr and 50k mage xp/hr is not very enticing. At least for me it isn't, even if I wasn't already 99 mage.
---
the first episode is me adjusting my mic quality every clip while i get the 50 firemaking and woodcutting, then the next 12 episodes later are wintertodt 
---
I personally don't find it ugly, but I think it's really hard for someone to understand what you mean without providing some sort of illustration of how to create the same game mechanics in a way that's less ugly.
---
I can't say much about using elder maul at kq because i never tried it, but bludgeon at Cerberus definitely makes a very noticeable difference.
---
Yeah damn that's tru, it still is a 95 slayer boss, it should give better items than a 87 slayer boss. But it does so already, it gives the leather and the claw. So I think the community doesn't really want another item that is better than the tentacle in the  game. but yeah, my last solution might not be the best.
---
Mapping ur keys through its program should be one of the safest ways, it’s when ahk is involved it’s a grey area
---
So either you are actually depressed which could for a variety of reasons or you are just doing nothing and expecting to feel better. 
---
Pro tip: most people dont just wake up feeling good, it takes a lot of effort in terms of health and exercise and social relationships to consistently feel good. 
---
Not to be a dick but way too many people just want to sit at home and do nothing and also bitch about being depressed. If you arent exercising consistently and eating healthy and hanging out with friends, you wont feel good and you wont be motivated to do anything at all. It takes work.

Nope. Think IBS but also bleeding and swelling and even more pain, but less frequently. It's an autoimmune disorder. Well not TECHNICALLY but it's easiest to think of it as one since it's treated the same way. 
---
With mild IBD like mine (I have Crohn's disease) my day to day life is likely better than someone with IBS. People with IBS have awful diarrhea and cramping most of the time. Probably every day. I just have them when I'm having a flare up which is very rare for me since my surgery. However.....well, I had to have surgery. I had a good chunk of my colon removed to get rid of the part that swelled shut then perforated and drained into an abscess. That doesn't happen with IBS. 
---
Didn’t they have a feature like this 10+ years ago to protect stored items in your bank?? I vaguely remember having a ‘bank pin’ haha
---
Doesn't the KBD automatically switch targets already though?
---
underrated comment! all maces and flails tend to give prayer and this would give it a proper niche without devaluing other items, full support 
---
Whatever the most popular cc for boosting it is. I ended up just doing it with randoms cuz that's too much money 
---
I'm gonna have to be that wholesome cunt, but luckily I used to pretty much be this unironically a couple years ago for about a year. I would be hitting my weed pen all day long, working a dead end part time job (but really easy and with good people), was failing college and dropped out, was dealing with a lot of emerging mental health problems, parents were probably ashamed of me, and overall was a mess, but was too high to ever give a fuck or address it.
---
Over the past couple years I've made progress and especially now lately I've come a long way. Been sober from all drugs for about half a year now, no nicotine for a few months now, been getting better about leaving behind my vices and bad habits, been building good habits, feeling like I'm actually maturing now and respectable, going back to college this spring, feel comfortable with myself and more confident, look better.
---
Point is that I was incapable of helping myself and was watching my world spiral down and crumble for a long time, got to a point where I thought it would only continue to get worse every day like it felt it was, I legitimately never thought I'd get better and that my life was doomed to be this horrible pit of despair, but somehow I've been making it out and in a much better spot with myself and for the first time feel that I am in control of myself and my life.
---
Improvement is possible and we can all make it, my dudes. 
---
Why does reddit think we need another crush weapon?
---
1. are birdhouses still worth to do?  
---
2. apart from ranarrs, what should I be planting for farm runs? I'm just looking for most profit/gp.  
---
3. what farm patches are good to use for farm runs? I know draynor because of the cabbage ring and phasmatys because of ectophile are good ones.  
---
4. I have magic secateurs, I was wondering what other equipment I should be getting for farming? 
---
But it.. it's so relaxing..
---
:(
---
I'll think about it. Maybe it could bring a different zest for life if I feel that kind of frustration. Make my body feel something besides tired or hungry. Hmm.. could be something there. 
---
there is no amount of stats that would make people use it unless you made it equal to or better than a fury in offensive stats.
---
ill say it again, nobody gives a shit
---
What client is that? I love the health and prayer bars. 
---
Moet nog 4 combat levels, 5 Slayer levels en 50 Total level voordat ik aan de req voldoe maar zal dan zeker contact opnemen! 
---
Just keep playing. There are a lot of accounts that happen to get lucky early. It's a head start if/when you go for pets. 
---
where would you ever want a 1 hand crush weapon? the only thing I can think of would be like skeletal wyverns? I can't think of a situation where you wouldn't just use a bludgeon. I dont think a "cheaper alternative" needs to be added to the bludgeon, because as people have said it's already not a very actively farmed boss, making the bludgeon less useful makes the boss less desirable to farm imo. 
---
Gezellig!

---
I think the resource area is fine but I super agree with this comment
---
It says it sold 33K of them today though, I guess it can't handle major price drops or something then?
---
Not argument there. It is a bit random and unneeded so I can see why the Bone Whip isn't popular. But balance-wise, I think it fits into the game better than the broad concept of a Bone Flail would. There is a lot of room between Whip and Rapier and the Bone Whip doesn't intrude much, but there is not a lot of room to work around Bludgeon. The best I could see is something like +75 Crush and +75 Str, which is a bit weaker than Bludgeon with Avernic but then it is only +10 Attack over Hasta...
---
He had slayer ring which is 30+ tp

 exactly my points been proven.

You can try to find item in shop around runescape and sell them back at ge or go kill some chaos druid buy wellfare gear and kill green/blue dragon 
---
Yea dont you guys have phones?
---
If looking only from money eise:
---
Black mask(slayer helm), whip, torag legs,  torag body, dboots, warrior ring is cheap af.
---
God dhide top,bot ,boots (i think ancient is cheap).
---
Once you will have mage 70 or 75: trident of seas,    ahrim top, bot.
---
Buy guthix pages and fill up god book, its like 20k but only 2x less att bonusrs than zammy but more def.
---
With remaining money or in the future just do upgrades like fury , inf boots , bandos, sgs and so on.

You don't even need to keep your approval rating at 100%.  Just before you collect it. 
---
Make sure you’re using Ultracompost with your ranarrs, it gives you more yield which makes ranarrs worth doing. 
---
Your herb runs should be at the following patches: Catherby patch (Camelot tele run east), north ardy patch(ardy tele run north or ardy cloak 3 tele), hosidious house patch(Xerics talisman to glade, run east), ectophial and cabbage you know about, and farming guild patch (skills necklace tele). If you have done my arms big adventure you can do the trollheim patch, and harmony island patch with elite morytania diary. 
---
shit man 80m is way cheaper than i thought it'd be, i guess i am getting diary cape after all
---
Sounds exactly like a scam tho hahahah
---
The use of the Ballista is part of the reason, but the way it is farmed is another. Even if everyone buys a Hydra Tail, there is still higher demand for the other new items and if players farm Hydra for them, then the rest will always be oversupplied. The fact that pre-poll the Tail only rose to around 3M before dropping isn't a great sign for the long term. Either way, this is pretty off topic from the point of the post.

The "top" could refer to the crust at the top of OP's pic.

Yea it was a jmod that put the pet on the account and was walking around trolling.
---
Honestly didn't know this was one handed looked up the animation and it looks alright. But that brings up the question is it needed. Where would a 1 handed crush weapon be needed if it is worse than bludgeon. If it is better than bludgeon then bludgeon will be pretty useless. If it's really good chainmace will be useless too. 
---
Nieve didn't say it, but the guy in Burthrope did. 
---
I dont even own it you stupid negative mean jerk of a baittaker. Try being more positive. Your anger-filled hatred is really annoying
---
Well I guess you got me there but we have strayed from my original point. Regardless of what the stats say, in usage I did not see a significant enough difference to spend the extra money for a bludgeon.

Enter keldagrim via the dungeon east of Relekka (north of the Relekka slayer caves). Follow that cave and the trolls you find there count towards the Konar task

OK, problem solved lol. Looks like it was something weird with Runelite. I went to the Burthrope Slayer Master to see what he would say, and he said he could cancle my task, but would lose my 149 streak.

How do I get started with pvp?
---
I am playing the game normally on my main (and only) account, which has combat stats around 60ish. I'm mostly doing pvm but I'd like to give pvp a try sometime. How do I go about it without immediately getting stacked by pures and people that know tick manipulation and prayer switching and all that stuff I see in torvesta vids? I don't feel I stand a fair chance if I were to just join a pvp world now
---
Some ISP was blocking RuneLite, but I think it should be resolved now

Jokes aside, i would love combat stat pets lol

Is it a bad idea to try pking on my main account thats not build for pking? or do you have to build an account specifically for it? 
---
nice design
---
Even with boosts? 
---
Troll stronghold can also be accessed from the Fremennik Slayer Dungeon fairy ring AJR and a climbing boot. You can use the secret passage and run through the stronghold to the roof
---
Wow this hits home more than I thought it would. At least I kind of sort of not really at all have life goals going for me
---
There are sites that allow you to pay for frequently used keywords that are gained from user submitted data through avenues that harvest and sell your data , which makes it easy for channels like that to stay on top of other posters. I can completely blame compilation channels contrary to belief you can hate the player as well as the game lol. The clips used argument maybe true for some RuneScape CP but may not be true for pubg and fortnite which are also plagued with the same issues. Appreciate your discussion (: 
---
Besides my first answer I'd go with
---
Ironman dies | rarest drop table | and probably some skillspec rage 
---
im on about being dead in trusting players.
---
everyone used to help each others out and now its dead
---
Funny, I'd say the exact opposite. I feel like way more of my friends talk about going to the bar after work and getting smashed or how much they drank over the weekend. They rarely talk about smoking unless it's about some cool spot that they found or something. 
---
Catherby nexus is great and drops you west of the bank.       
---
And fishing guild is closer for Ardy patch.       
---
And Fairy Ring is closer for Phasmatys, but you need to take into account your access to a fairy ring (slayer ring, poh)

I have a friend like this but he isn't really a bad guy. Just kind of in a depressed phase with a part time job still looking for a career he could settle into. But for some reason girls still gravitate to him. He's not a "chad" but also not a "entitled nice guy". Just charming and funny. 
---
Even with a nearly perfect bgs spec that's insanely slow. Definitely not worth doing. 
---
So "If you" works yeah? Cause wtf u offering besides a list.. 
---
Its to avoid the flame damage, if you time it right you can walk around the around the square as the fire attack ends.
---
It's way easier with ranged
---
Hm... I'm not sure where I stand on the bone whip and I'd not say it's fair to say people will vote no simply out of spite. It'd be a cool new weapon and other than "muh nostalgia" It'd not hurt anything. However there's also the valid argument people bring up and that is "why", why do we need a new slash weapon randomly slapped between two other? There's really no need for it and overall It does not make sense to have.  
---
Basically it'd not really hurt anything, but just because something can be done, does not mean it should be.
---
Implying that all skillers are also ironmen?
---
Why would they not just buy a pick lmfao. 
---
Can someone please eli5, why is this so significant and why is this guy getting so much hate here?
---
Yes, it is blocked
---
...that’s a huge difference than waking up a 7am before work and drinking to get rid of the hangover from drinking since 7 am the morning before.  
---
Alcoholism isn’t drinking with coworkers after work, or a fun weekend. It’s always needing a drink and being fucking miserable after work. 
---
Alcoholics don’t talk about it. 
---
im an idiot i still dont get his comment, he doesnt understand or....?
---
They might not be there, but try going to edgeville bank on the Bounty Hunter world, and trade Perdu, see if they’re there. Otherwise put in a bug report.
---
I don't think that is enough of a use. Also, the Blessed Sara Sword and Dharok can surpass it for Strength. Prayer is one way to set it apart, but I don't think a slightly better Hasta with more Prayer would really fit a Level 95 Slayer drop.
---
I know. But the post wasn't about the Bone Whip.
---
Alpha mentality 
---
hey thanks
---
I autoclicked my way to 94 mage back around 2010, it’s insane how people used to get away with botting their mains as long as they played it smart, Nowadays you’d get banned in an instant.
---
Go to the hunter sign, location is there
---
It has been full quite a few times 
---
Legends cape is like the absolute quintessential noob cape along with obby cape
---
Boomer isn't an age, it's a state of mind.
---
Wtf is wrong with you? Getting mad about a stupid suggestion online. Go get dicked you asshole.
---
That's not QoL. That's just a buff to do rates simply because you're lazy
---
fr there are some ppl who ostensibly do nothing while logged in except talk about dabs at the GE
---
Maybe change it to where you aren't actually in the game until you hit the giant "Click here to play" button.
---
wait wtf i literally got almost the same items in 7 kc last night except instead of staff i got karils skirt
---
official aspie gang
---
Git gud scrub
---
I do need grind out void. Heros quest is next on my list and that will put me right at 42def
---
Yeah you musta died after Jad died, you shoulda got 8k tokkul, technically you completed the slay task but didn’t survive the whole cave. It sucks but it happens to alota people 
---
Who is it? Gudlife? Haven't played BA in a while. Outfit makes me recall Bwaha? But multiboxing makes me think of the frog mask guy (can't recall his name, was a bit odd) but he wasn't an ass from what I remember.
---
I’m 99 farming, so I just do herbs and contracts 
---
Rework sire drop table then, I’m sure jamflop wouldn’t mind adding another 6000x flax drop to a boss
---
R/murderedbywords
---
Like Mage said, quests are a great way to skip the earlier levels. If you wanted a long term goal, barrows gloves are a great long term investment. Once that is done you will have done a lot of important quests done and opened up a lot more of the game. I would then do slayer till 100 combat for the ability to do veteran post control boats for your void sets which are super useful for raids 1. You can do this earlier but its slower, and in my opinion the less time spent doing pest control the better. 
---
Those are the big things I would go for but there will always be smaller requirements that pop up.
---
In terms of "fast way" to end game, I think the only thing that will make everything go significantly faster is a good game knowledge. So make the wiki your best friend and I'm sure you will never run out of stuff to do. 
---
i remember farming bandos untill i noticed at peak times theres no way to get a free spot, so i made a pure haha. but honestly i think there doesnt need to be done anything coz imagine if anyone could do gwd at any time how rare would gwd stuff really be lol
---
There goes their illusion of hope. 
---
You died to the healers before Jads death animation was completely finished
---
Yeah man, hopefully I can be more efficient and smarter going forward lol
---
Im pretty sure its like "tsunami" where you dont fully pronounce the 't' sound, so it should sound like "Tzar", as in the old Russian rulers.
---
I did jad with 92 combat, as much as its helpful to level combats to 80+ and buy expensive gear, it all comes to how you block and prioratise the monsters, and ultimatly, how sharp you are at Jad himself.
---
Just breath deep and keep flicking these prayers correctly, and because you will probably use Piety or other damage boosting prayer remember that you will need to drink prayer pots MUCH more frequntly than at the waves, i forgot to drink the pots on my first try and that what got me killed, on my second try i was much more smarter.
---
As long as the instance costs quite a bit
---
You can do fine with RCB+broads but I highly recommend diamond bolts (e) for the 360s and Jad.  Archer ring is also worthwhile, every little DPS increase helps when you have a lower range level.
---
Blowpipe is fantastic, but if you can't afford the weapon, scales and darts, I wouldn't recommend it since you'll probably die a couple times and end up spending a ton of cash.
---
Same my friend, same
---
What I did when I was at those stats was I had the same gear, roughly.    Karil’s crossbow, with about 2500/3000bolt racks (just to be safe, can sell what is left) along with archers ring to get some damage increase.  Also, if you do slayer, maybe try to get it as a task for some better damage with slayer helm (i).    Best of luck, get that cape.  
---
King ronald, Kendall, count draynor, black demon and tree spirit
---
It's definitely normal custom rumble
---
Who do you choose? Do you stand in middle?
---
Thank you
---
this is that and it's still here
---
damn feel bad for RoT
---
Rot really are slumping
---
Grind fighter or keep using rune imo. 
---
Dont you mean late twenties
---
I don't think they are able to make a lobby atm - but it's on their to-do list for engine team if I remember right.
---
What the fuck is a rot?
---
So if this guy is an entire BA Clan...what has he ascended/descended to?
---
My main concern would be exactly when Maul is superior to bludgeon and if this will still be the case considering possible higher DPS from bludgeon. 
---
Go buy a dragon axe brainlet
---
World 355!
---
Don't focus on getting to end-game content. Mid-game is my favourite - you really see progress.
---
New jagex update/boaty osrs/ hcim gets what he’s after/ he cant believe it osrs
---
being able to drop all my items seem a good qol to me.
---
Ditch the rune and start getting melee armor with str bonus. Save up for a whip, fury and zerk ring. You can get a warrior ring for now until you can afford a zerk.
---
Konar’s too
---
Well you're either a troll or a complete idiot. Im guessing a troll. 
---
So if I'm 82 and I boost to 87 I can technically have 2 right? I'd like to keep my brimhaven tree for fruit runs.
---
I think its only the old ones now unfortunately... I examined everything in the new quests but no jokes :(
---
2 tap feature for making darts? I'd rather complete mage training arena
---
Yeh that's my main worry too - would need someone to run the numbers to find out haha (I'm not great at all the dps calc millarky).
---
I'm hoping it'll be a small enough upgrade to be feasible though.
---
Love the way you formed it into the logo, nice work
---
Thanks for the answer. So a Ring of Wealth isn't worth it for regular Slayer, considering the extra rolls on the rare loot table etc?
---
Ohh gotcha, I haven’t messed with since I came back a few weeks ago. 
---
Degeneracy
---
You get hespori mostly from treesso that's probably why
---
Jewelry box
---
Yeah just stand in the middle, you should be able to stand anywhere tho the spawns are all the time.

I was legit saving money to afford a tbow so I could throw my self at zuk until I got the cape. I still got like 400m =/ but wasted all that bond money that I could in theory request my money back for the service that I wasn't provided due to cancelation but that seems like a extra stab at jagex and its really not worth the time when you think about it id only be refunded around 140$ have to claim bs to a bank, I really don't wana risk actually getting in trouble. ill take the hit like a big boy and come back stronger, smarter, and better =) 
---
Ahh okay that may have been my luck then. Thanks
---

---
Do you know what a flail is 
---
Because my favourite part of this game is collecting gear, resources and cool items and building up my bank. Why should I need to carefully manage my ~50 remaining bank spaces constantly just to play the game? 
---
I don't PK (although I would like to in the future maybe), but this does seem incredibly broken. Support changing this
---
You do realize OSRS wasn't released in 2004 right?  If he doesn't play way too much this is very reasonable to just now be getting his first 99s. 
---
It's a costume room. It stores a bunch of armor and shit
---
Ign does not check out
---
I would LOOOOOOVE this.
---
The other tasks consist of completing a single wave of BA and buying a granite plate which I think requires a queen kill. 
---
Idk who'd wanna pay 6mil for something so easy. Also the start of this comment chain even mentioned getting level 5 in all roles. 
---
I don't like this.  Regular bone whip is better.
---
Think the most you’d pay is 18m with shit stats. Doubt it’s that high though.
---
Fuck yo couch nigga, buy another one you rich mothafucka. 
---
Chain mace is always bis in Wildy I thought 
---
5 rooms loads as fast as 9 rooms. 1 is the quickest, followed by 4, followed by 9, followed by 16. you could have 3 more rooms
---
Lava/frost whips sure.
---
Kracken thing, I'm not so sure. Keeping the price of whips up was a major point of adding the tent whip, and that's largely accomplished through PvP. The fact that the tentacle is *soo* much cheaper really sucks though. I've heard it suggested that they make it a 50/50 of either getting the whip or the tentacle back so that both could be worth something. It might be kind of annoying for Ironmen, and it also might not work super well (I don't know the the rates for how many whips vs tents enter the game), but I'd say it's worth considering.
---
You don't have to agree with everything someone does, but trying to do them harm because you don't agree with them is a scumbag thing to do.
---
Getting triggered doesn't entitle you to anything.
---
how often does the lava/frost whip thing occur
---
What a champion 
---
ah gudlife lol thanks for the reminder. i miss BA always had some interesting characters 
---
We disagree on the term 'hate.' Telling a girl who's using suicide as a sort of-threat (maybe I'm wrong, let's pretend I'm not for now) to just end it or don't is not hate in my opinion. I think, to her, it's basically saying "your charade is up, time to get back to reality and deal with things"  
---
I get what you're saying too. But you can basically apply your comment to people calling me an "edgelord" saying I just want attention. What if I'm "mentally ill" and just want attention? Is it right to downvote and call me a POS? You know? 
---
My parents are great people that I respect and hope to be like. :D
---
Imagine you're so fucking elitist you berate people for not prayer flicking at a slayer boss. Get a new hobby. 
---
Ok let me clarifiy since it appears you got your panties in a bunch, it's a versatile weapon that happens to be best at stab, for balancing reasons I assume.  Either its "primarily" or not a stab weapon is irrelevant since what matter is the stats it's got to offer for the task required. So tell me if you aren't going to make it purely better (which is the vibe I was getting from the suggestions, and jagex talking about adding a T72 weapon) how are you going to release this new weapon without devaluing the others?
---
I’m sure you think so 
---
Yeah I was thinking both tbh, I figured once I can be able to afford a dragon pickaxe i will then be Able to more focus  on exp. Does the motherlode mine work best for exp? 
---
Damn almost 30k people don't know about runelite.
---
Honestly makes the caption more accurate. 
---
He should basically end his own life right?
---
Y i K e S
---
If this guy gets 1000 upvotes I'll get all my fake friends to buy 10k maces each
---
He bought them 5k above alch value lmao, he loses less than a mil no matter what
---
Um, yes it does
---
Why is this a joke? I'm new to the game and my account was just hacked last night. I figured the first thing I should do is change my PW and enable the authenticator
---
Bloodveld really are not a bursting task. If you mean for slayer(dust devils and nechryael), normally I just use monk robes or proselyte. Master wand is generally pretty useless, the slayer monster have no accuracy. This is also why it is best to go for max prayer bonus(holy sandals, monk robes/proselyte) instead of mage gear.
---
For maging the upgrade path generally is Occult &gt; torment &gt; Ancestral hat &gt; kodai wand. But apart from occult those only really are worth it, if you are actually going for 90+ mages at monkeys.
---
Realistically though they’d only be begging cus they’re below the breadline, the fact is you can stab a dragon with a magic shield and get enough money to buy mythical powerful equipment and ramsay approved food in a matter of 3 trips (free magic shield by the way, duke of lumbridge) so there’s no need. Unless they’re doing rping which is sad 
---
So post it in the RS3 sub, this isn't oldschool related and doesn't belong here. 
---
How does anyone learn to play the game if they don't play the game and just beg?
---
You have to learn to play the game, if you're given generous gifts, you get spoiled and then won't actually play the game and get bored then quit. When people beg, they're making their problem everyone else's problem. That's not ok. 
---
Helping is one thing, telling someone what to do for money is nice.  Straight up giving them money does not help them in the long run. 
---
"Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."

Used to be 25m. Unstable. 
---
He was streaming himself doing a clue in the wildy, great way to get attention for the rebuild series and definitely a well-deserved death
---
Ah, thanks for the info!
---
I think it would be fucking awesome. Everyone is so goddamn stubborn about the HD graphics thing. 
---
Do you respect your parents? 
---
That would be mind 20’s then, o may be wrong though. 
---
Whats rs3? i heard some chad talking about it but i never could get back into my ruined pures.
---
yes this is what we need. Thank you for a visual for it so it gains more traction. No to whip, yes to flail. 
---
Hahahahahahaa fucking little bitch coward baby pussy boy. Don't fuck with the big boys in future!!!! ahahaahahaah
---
Calling all salad robe nibbas in to ice blitz the water. 
---
Im curious legit what is better about osbuddy? 
---
are you actually processing your own thoughts right now? apply this to the lass in the chat, maybe you did think she was faking it, but telling her to kill herself and trying to do her harm, when she could potentially be suicidal is a scumbag thing to do. From a person who genuinly suffers with mental illness, theres nothing i hate more than people 100% faking suicidal thoughts for attention, its totally wrong to use something thats plagued me and many others for years because you're lonely or whatever, but (1) she may genuinly be suicidal and crying out for help, and can you actually imagine that happening to you if you truly needed someone, and (2) if shes faking it for attention, theres very clearly something wrong with her mentally anyway. if you think the way he responded is anything other than fucking awful, then you're as bad as him
---
Hopefully my mom doesn’t evict me from her basement in the mean time. Not sure where all the girls are supposed to go if she does 
---
They have already stated in a dev blog that the alch value is being nerfed regardless of any poll result. If nothing changes and the alch change goes through he could lose over 100m
---
Im just wondering, cuz this item is so unique to every other Items price fluctuation. Idk why people have to be rude on here lol. I appreciate the nice comments tho
---
I've used both, and tbh while runelite is better and free, osbuddy pro was legit as well 
---
He can just alch them you fucking melt
---
I’m a beggar because I’m telling him about a function ingame? Strange logic but ok. 
---
Grossssssssss, I am mid twenties, don't drink, strenght level 99 like true chad, only curls in the squat rack and pking panties like it's world 18. I am slaying pussy til I get 200m xp now. Watch me.
---
This resonates with me so hard it hurts 
---
Well when someone actually does kill themselves after he told them to do it, at least he can feel good in the fact that he wasn't fooled all those other times.
---
It obviously won't be *purely* better becuase it shouldn't even have a stab option. Every new weapon we get is either completely dead content or it, at least slightly, devalues other weapons. There is nothing wrong with power creep. Its the only way new items get released. However powercreep should be limited. Making a weapon better than the lesser attack style of the hasta isn't completely devaluing it. Im pretty sure it would only be useful at wyverns and currently a hasta is worse than a whip. 
---
ba services
---
People have lost their HC status and have had similar reaction. I gave a personal analogy to provide further "evidence."
---
Maybe something is fishy, but to base it off just the reaction, is no the way to go.
---
Holy shit When you go the the theatres do you watch the movie from outside the door slot? Can’t even see the damage dealt / received properly. 
---
How much for level 5 all roles? That's what I'm interested in 
---
*SURRENDER AND DIE*  
---
&gt;Don’t you mean surrender *OR* die?
---
Well then consider how they planned to introduce pvp armors leaving no hsit on death.
---
They literally proposed a desgin in which super op gear didnt gave any  proper loot on death. Like what the fuck.
---
They want the sinks? Then force people to load 3M cash into the item to bring it into pvp/wildy, so if they want the sink to happen, at least the whole price remains as loot.
---
PD: no way you can drop coloured whips and run back to grab them, really?
---
Glad to have helped! Haha
---
I still respect fire cape
---
This should be a game security feature. Support or ill tell saint nick to bring you tons of unnoted coal and drop it all over your fireplace.
---
Rip Jim Lahey 
---
Check OSbuddy Exchange, those prices are usually pretty accurate 
---
So in a post about custom clients you think your comment is smart? Like having a software do different things isn’t a good point of discussion but fake noob warrior posts are
