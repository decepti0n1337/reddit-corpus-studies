Yep sounds like that’s a legit thing. Insert spaghetti code explanation.  Dear fuck did Jagex really forget to balance check the new cosmetics.  If so ham joint might not be the only scam in game right now so watch out for shady shit with new clue items.

Why are Konar lizardman tasks split into so many locations that are all right next to each other? Molch/settlement shamans aren't considered a part of the swamp, and neither are shamans in the slayer-only underground caves (where the old safespot was.) This is despite the entire area being called the "Kebos Swamp."
---
Basically, the lizardman Konar tasks are named badly and should be reconsidered and/or recategorized.

So what formula did he use to get 1/54k? I know the drop rate for items goes up they more items u get per chest since u cant get dupes, but each additional item would only get like 5% rarer, so at the most its probably like 1/6k. I dont see where the 1/54k number comes from.

There's a subreddit for this, I forgot the name tho

New to raids 20 kc all done in teams either at 4 or huge teams ffas just wondering how I can increase my point average! I use void so I know it’s not the best but I’m still learning but I watch a ton of videos and see people getting 20-25k points in team raids by themselves and I can only manage max like 13-14k points on my best raids with no deaths I’ve started to get to where I don’t die unless I get stacked out to a mistake but either way just wondering how I can increase my personal points because all I can seem to find is ffas anyway so going to need more points to get a drop hopefully one day! Thanks in advance for the help!
---
How?

It’s easy at level 60 defence (Odium, Berserker necklace and a toy weapon) but at level 3 to increase your odds you’ll need stuff like flippers

If your doing slayer stick with burst if your doing mm1/mm2 tunnels yeah barrage.

We’re trying to find out some info about specific numbers of runes dropped and such, afaik there’s no specifics on that, just the percentages where the rollover occurs

Was the Weiss clue step in elites before the update? I got a scroll from Vork that needs me to complete Making Friends With my Arm. The grind has been painful so far
---
DHCB&gt;Rigour&gt;Pool for house&gt;Pegs/Ward
---
DHCB is by far the biggest difference maker. Youll get 99 range in no time if you camp him since with DHCB and rigour I was getting anywhere from 70-90k xp IIRC and pretty much did 96-99 range entirely at Vork. Youll be able to afford things real quick if you get good at vork. I think I unlocked Vork and bought DHCB then could afford rigour @ 65m literally within a few days and then house pool 3-4 days later after buying shit.
---
You could do 93-99 range entirely at Vork and it actually wouldnt be too slow and youll probably make like 100m+. 
---
Also pro tip for the undead phase, bring staff of the dead because it auto casts crumble undead so all you have to do is just click the spawn once (also make sure as soon as undead phase starts you click the ground immediately so you stop attacking Vork and you cast on the add ASAP).
---
Source: 3.4K KC @ Vork probably 2400-2500 of that with DHCB and other with Lance.
---
You are a hero we need, but don't deserve!

Wow dude you’re so cool!

Lmfao. Are you really gonna sit here and argue with the kid’s mom over this? She lost a child. Holy fuck, get a life. I wish people like you would just leave the community forever.

I was literally gonna ask about what the actual chances of getting a drop are, like a 1/5k that took me 11.2k kc &gt;_&gt;
---
where would it be useful

What kind of stylus? I haven't found a decent one ever so far. They don't always touch unless I press in all the way, then sometimes it feels like the drag gets lifted off. 
---
Is this just part of the experience?
---
&gt;Still one question remains for me.
---
&gt;Why can the users of Runescape not use special characters for our passwords."Passwords can only contain the letters A to Z and the number 0 to 9."For a game this big, you would expect that it would be possible to have that option. Just wondering what's up with that.
---
Most likely a relic of an old system. It wasn't a big deal in the 90s and they never bothered changing it because it's honestly a lot of work. Realistically you have to support the old case-insensitive method as well as the new, case-sensitive one until a reasonable chunk of players have naturally changed their password, using the new system, then make announcements so that as few people as possible freak out when they have to reset their passwords, finally deprecating the old method and dealing with all the support tickets from people who don't read the news and think they were hacked. They can't just "turn on" case sensitivity because they don't know what characters from your password are upper or lower case, since all they get is a hash.
---
And, realistically, not much would be gained from it. With a 20 character alphanumeric and case-insensitive password you're still WELL above the possibility of being brute forced given how much they throttle password attempts.
---
Yeah, it'd be a nice thing to have, but at the end of the day, it wouldn't make a huge difference in accounts compromised and a lot of time would be sunk in this project. I'd rather they spent their resources elsewhere.
---
all of the actual working bots tele before you can cast, the ones you kill actually drop like a games ring, anti dragon shield and food. Jagex really needs to look at this, its impossible to kill them and they're fking botting.
---
&gt; They in the very least ignore case before they hash + salt and that's an atrocious implementation in itself     
---
Maybe reread that sentence? Since the conclusion you think I came to isn't the conclusion I was making.
---
Yah but it’s extremely and I’ve forgotten the name :/
---
Slayer and barrows is usually decent
---
So sorry for your loss mate, I'm glad rs gave him something to do and people to hang out with when he needed it... Hope you guys come out the other end okay.

---
You're both dumb, that's obviously Zulrah.

I would honestly do that if it was possible. Farming was a fun 99.
---
&gt;Having the client lower all the cases before making the hash is extremely simple and not at all a security flaw unless you don't have a brute force throttle (which they do, heavily, on both the client and the website)
---
Combat bots are rising in number again (i.e. Green Dragon bots), and because of wilderness and combat mechanics, they are able to bring ring of dueling or games necklaces to tele out, thus not even risking 1k. Most of these bots tele before you can cast, and on top of that the green dragons can pj you.
---
Onto my question: Why do wilderness non-boss npc's still possess the ability to pj? this seems a) archaic, and b) out of place in an area based on player vs player interactions.
---
Ham joint is already BIS for theatre of blood for Nylo room. It's 3tick so add an avernic defender and it's the best dps. So it's already a niche, yet BIS item.
---
Add dialogue to the soldier outside the lizardman canyon allowing the player to see killcount of lizardmen shamans.  Currently the only npc to do so is in the lizardman caves.

It's not dumb.  A big factor in group ironman is getting everyone to commit equally.  If it's official people will be more willing to get on board and stick with it.

Self restraint. If you physically can not break the rules then you won't. But if you're 5x the rate dry on a certain item, not everyone has the mental strength to not go oopsy and cheat here and there. The official mode restrains you.

https://work.chron.com/minimum-wage-apply-contractors-1758.html
---
"The Fair Labor Standards Act does not apply the minimum wage payment requirement to independent contractors."

Of course not just anybody can classify an employee as a independant contract and pay them less than minimum wage, but its painstakingly obvious that you know literally nothing about legal loopholes.
---
How's that taste in your mouth? Bitter?
---
Naw tip crowd is 10x more annoying. If I don't want to tip someone I won't I hate having retards shove it down my throat about how some guy literally just bringing me my food deserves extra money. Why doesn't the guy at McDonald's get your tip? Answer me that then I'll rethink my position. I don't need people with arbitrary guidelines for who deserves tips telling me I should be tipping people arbitrarily.

I know for a fact the dude working register at McDondald's is getting minimum wage, and if not, he's getting like 10 cents more. Tip him next time. Thanks buddy. So the only reason you do it is because "it's a common practice" basically. Just because it's socially acceptable to tip bartenders and not anyone else. Solid reason. Sure there are some jobs that don't allow people to accept tips, the guy will tell you that, then you say oh sorry I didn't realize, my bad man, and move on. That would be if you actually cared about what you're saying instead of just trying to justify some dumbass social norm that has literally no reason to be followed

You lost far more time actually screen shotting and posting this to reddit, so id say yea you are mad/care a lot lol.

Idk why you assume theyre killing you for an "ego boost" especially if theyre a good pker...maybe theyre just killing you because its the wilderness? 
---
Either way dunno why youre so mad, dont do clues in the wilderness if youre gonna actually go through the effort to make a reddit post crying about it, Ive never once had a problem doing clues in the wildy.

Unfortunately this has to be said as it's 2019: I understand that jokes may offend people, and it's my decision to tell those people to fuck off. Bringing a smile to someone who is having a bad day is more important to me than someone that chooses to be angry for something out of their control.

What these people don't understand is that we need a new slayer boss every week or else the game will die jagex can't afford to spend a little bit of development time on a gamemode a sizable amount of players will enjoy.

On my hcim I have some giant keys and want to kill obor to see if I can get some rune armor but I'm not sure if my gear/stats are good enough for it. I have mithril legs, iron kiteshield, rune scim, addy med helm and an iron chain body with 50 attack, strength and defense. I'm assuming this isn't good enough but I'm hoping someone can tell me what level I need to get my stats to to kill him.
---
It's just some fucking crabs
---
It seems a lot of people are worried about dungeoneering because of OP rewards (mostly chaotic rapier), but we’ve already exceeded the DPS of chaotic rapier with BP + rigour in Oldschool.

Not implying you’re “worried” about it, just think it’s good to remind people where we’ve gotten to in terms of DPS.

**Revisiting Old Content**
---
While back there was an idea about Bone Bag, I was thinking about it in a different sense and idea came to me when the revisiting old content came in the polls and weekly Q&amp;A.  Bone bag can be a reward of either a new quest or drop from a Skeleton Boss or something, Bones inserted into the bag cannot be removed, but can only be put into the Bone Grinder in  Port Phastamtys EctoFuntus, making farming our own bones more viable , the bag could be upgradable via using it or with ecto tokens and gp cause we need more money sinks. Would make farming ur own bones more viable and de-value green dragon botters. Imo its a good idea since everyone uses guilded altars and ectofuntus is technically dead content outside of ppl using it to charge the bone crusher. 
---
Thanks,
---
I don't want to be rude, but if it took you that long to get 580 total, you probably won't have the patience to grind a bond every 2 weeks, and still have time to play the game

Now I wish runescape's imps could pick up the most valuable nearby item and keep it stored until it picks up another item or until a player kills it

PLEASE
---
But he asked what he could do, not what he could've done. Also if he is asking ways to make money ingame, why suggest to buy bond with cash? You didnt even mention any of the 200k/h money makers. 
---
Believe it or not but people learn from mistakes. I doubt he/she will be making this mistake again to let it hang for the last day but for the last day, he needs money makers.
---
Sigh

Yeah you got quite a ways to go before you start getting any reddit sympathy

Myths guild was super good when it first came out since the reqs were so high and no one did it and thought to start mining. Not sure how it is now.
---
plz make 99 firemaking and full pyromancer + firemaking cape = immune to dmg . 
---
would make firemaking cape more viable too?
---
Alright, i'll take the bait. The little dragon in front of your character is the pet.

fair enough. Might appeal one last time and if nothing happens might start a new character if I can be bothered leveling up all over again lol. Would be good to actually speak to customer support

---
it definitely is, especially since he changes attack types based on what you pray, it’s just a question of whether or not you have high enough stats to kill him
---
What I meant was that I never really got into the game until recently. I played maybe a few times a year.
---
What do you need to know? You make new accounts that are basically unofficial ironmen but you can still trade with each other and kill bosses together.
---
If someone else tags a monster you can’t get it anymore, if someone drops something you can’t pick it up. No trading with people outside your group no GE.

Thanks for the advice!

Congrats! — looks like im too late :/

I would love to do this, but you need to switch around the runes in your pouch so often for so many activities that it just tilts me too much to bother.

So I guess to get to my point I was curious if I could teleport home to reset prayer and come back.

&gt;it can be a really really well paying job if people do the standard tipping, which is why they don’t look for jobs at someplace else.
---
To be fair, you should not be planning your finances around money you can’t guarantee you’ll get. If your contract says you’ll be getting minimum wage, plan for minimum wage. Don’t rely on people conforming to tipping culture to fund your life and then get pissy when customers only want to pay for what they actually bought, which they have every right to do.
---
&gt;You are not fixing the root of the problem by not tipping people, you can fix the problem by voting for people who can change the laws.
---
You are also exacerbating the problem when you tip because you are providing the solution for government not to raise minimum wage and for your employer not to pay you a living wage.
---
The situation for servers might suck but it is absolutely not the responsibility of the consumer to pick up the slack left by your country’s inadequate labour laws.

Leveling mining and using Motherlode right now. Wiki says nodes upstairs should break after 15 seconds, but many times it'll break just a couple seconds after clicking.
---
There's no one else mining the nodes I'm on, so I'm just curious if there's something I'm missing about how it's supposed to work.
---
Given how the game has progressed, if they were to remove the wilderness in 07, it probably wouldn't be a huge deal. PVP has been slowly dying since the game was released anyway.
---
Nah that’s not maximum efficiency lol it would just be better gear upgrades
---
Everything about this post is the worst
---
Except its not the same. For it to be the same, you'd have to constantly pay attention to whether or not a monsters health was full when you attacked it, which would be difficult if it was only missing 1 health. You'd also not be using the same shops as ironmen and would have to pay attention to whether or not a store is overstocked or not. There are many other reasons that this logic doesnt work. The biggest issue for me however, is that i'm convinced that group ironman will come out eventually, which results in me waiting for it. If Jagex came out and said that they will never release it, yeah i'd probably just make my own.
---

Because we can get all NMZ rewards.

I've always been confused by this.  Is it above drop rate because you got an above average amount of drops, or below drop rate because you got them in a lower than average number of kills?
---
There is no help coming now you just have to wait like the rest of us swamp tar heroin addicts for more.

Sure, but some people survive on tips. No one likes to beg, hence we should sympathise with those asking.

Do underground pass quest, use Iban’s blast to kill lava dragons. Stand south of isle and bring tele grab runes for loot along with a looting bag. Be quick on the logout button. Alternatively if you think you don’t have enough time and requirements for the quest will have diminishing returns on time spent to profit use your best fire spell along with a tome of fire when you can afford it. Google “osrs [item you don’t know]” or for quests type “[quest name] quick guide”
---
You can do that but I wouldn't recommend it. A dose of prayer potion costs far less than a barrows tab.

I was about to make a thread on this as well but forgot to. I feel dungeoneering needs to happen for both members and f2p sake. This minigame was absolutely nostalgic for me as a f2p. It was so much fun having good high stats dropping food on the floor and just helping out the team even as a level 3! It was pretty sad we got raids instead of dungeoneering as a minigame when they wanted something new. I wish they would look into this and revive old content we had back in 2011 and just nerf the rewards. Anyways, the leveling system needs to be looked at since its no longer a skill.. and maybe add a point system like wintertodt. With its own set of rewards and a cape of achievement. Maybe add a new pet. Some new item to add to the game without breaking it.
---
Thank you for reply!! I want to get out of void and have the money too my only reason I don’t is because it’s easiest switches and with all the stuff I’m trying to do while fighting olm it just seems very hard to make that switch to more switches over having less switches and more brews!

Torment and ring of suffering aren't really used in slayer. Efficient slayer people use slaughter for devils, nechs. Might be useful for boss slayer? It depends on how you plan on training, I only cannon and burst my tasks.

Caveat is that your n should be reasonably large, like at least 20 for this to be accurate. For the exact reason that (1 + 1/n)^n needs n to be large to approximate e!
---
Just pull up the wiki quick guide on your phone/tablet/second monitor. The quest takes like 45 minutes and ~50k worth of supplies. It is nowhere near as annoying as UP.
---
I honestly do not understand why people get so hung up on the fact that dungeoneering was a skill. In fact, it was the ONLY skill in the game that required actual skill to train efficiently. The point of dungeoneering as a skill was based on exploration. You explore the early levels which had lesser bosses/enemies/puzzles/etc, then as you delve deeper the difficulty increases. I'm not saying it can't work as a minigame, I just think some of you need to expand your narrow mindedness about what a skill should be.
---
I loved dungeoneering btw. Dungeoneering shined because you did not need any items nor skills to start. It truly offered content for the entire playerbase (which is something that OSRS lacks imo). It was a genius design, especially after batch 2 which gave the higher level players more content to explore. 
---
The rewards were great too, and hardly "OP" considering what's already in OSRS (tbow, blowpipe). They were untradable which meant that you actually have to work for it, and it eliminated RNG aspects because it wasn't a drop. To get a chaotic you need 200k tokens, your first chaotic was always going to take longer than successive ones. But anyone with 80 attack could slowly work towards that goal. Currently, you can buy BIS gear and unlockables with IRL $$ because of bonds, can you really call that "balanced"? 
---
It's too bad a lot of /r/crappyoffbrands of chaotics are already in the game (elder maul, twisted buckler, rapier, kodai wand, etc.) because this game could seriously use some good content that's above t70-75. Everyone's so fixated on maintaining the "meta" and we're here 6 years into the game and still using whips. Sometimes the meta changes, just because a new BIS weapon comes out doesn't mean EoC is coming with it. I would love to see dungeoneering released WITH chaotics. Don't give me some shitty half-assed nerfed version and then have it be worse than the whip, what's the point? Unfourtunately due to the updates already in the game, that seems unlikely.
---
By definition, that's not a fact then, so stop calling it one. It's a rumor and nothing more.

Nah, Karil's magic level is 1, so he's got garbage magic defense even with his armor set. NPC magic defense is purely Effective Level (1) * (Bonus (+106) + 64), or 170. Player magic offense, even in metal gear, is going to end up in the tens of thousands usually, so it isn't going to make you go any faster in the vast majority of cases.
---
I support this, specifically a left hit, right hit at high speed. Jagex buffed ahrims staff, why not these too? Who cares if a few people make a few hundred mill or even a billion or two...

I didn't even know you could fail the hand holds until people told me. I've done it on 4 accounts between RS3 and OSRS. Most of my accounts sit around 65-70 agility. Never failed the handholds once.

I highly recommend using the Varrock Armour 4 and the Superior/Expert Mining Gloves if you don't use them already.   The Armor gives a 10% chance of double ore each time you mine a rock, and the gloves give you a 12.5% chance of not depleting the ore. If both effects activate you could get 3+ runite ores from a rock before it depletes. Just make sure not to bring your gloves into the wilderness though, they would get converted to coins past LVL 20 wilderness if they were unprotected and you died. Also you probably already know this but the runite rocks in Mor Ul Rek are usually a good spot because they are locked behind a fire cape requirement so you don't have to compete with bots.

What about MEP2 is hard to you? This isn't a condescending question, I'm just trying to figure out what you find difficult about it. It's just a bunch of running around and slotting mirrors, keeping prayer up when needed, and drinking stamina potions. Worst case scenario, you can just make a few trips.
---
That's mtx as a whole which osrs has in bonds so it's likely equal or osrs makes slightly more

Sorry man but this is the exact mentality that I feel is ruining the game. You want to pump out tiers above 80+, but then you end up in a situation a few years down the line where they have to raise the level cap (like RS3 lol) so the mods can have new rewards for the content they make.

You're also correct that my point doesn't apply to people who only play an hour a day, but I'm not talking about those people, as I compared the situation to people who play hours a day/days a month.

Definitely an unpopular opinion, but I actually liked the concept of chaotics. I liked the idea that having money alone wasn't enough to get you the best gear in the game anymore.  If you had a chaotic, at least in the early days of its release, you had earned it. 
---
...And then they made it the easiest skill to train in the game. That daily challenge if I recall correctly, could be completed via Floor One and would take about three minutes to do. Sinkholes also gave huge chunks of xp, and MTX began giving away dungeoneering tokens and even actual chaotics. Let's never let this happen to OSRS too.

First of all gz, secondly. How did you get your ground item text size so bold like that? Ive been playing on a laptop for a while and just recently built a pc. On my laptop my ground item text looks like yours. On my pc its too thin and small. Its annoying and hard to see.
---
Most people quit years before EoC. It was a steady decline.
---
However, the community (on Reddit anyway) recently is comprised more of the 7 year olds who played in 2011.
---
I mean, yeah.
---

---
With this you look at drop rate like a percent. And your rate (percent) is higher or lower. If something is 1/50 its 2% so if you've gotten 3/50 its 6% so you're above the drop rate. 1/100 is 1% so you're below.
---
Above=good below=bad
---
pretty sure Rapier was being merched before, but now its rebounded a good 8-10m above what it was before it was merched then dumped.
---
Honestly wouldnt be surprised if DHCB and Lance are being merched now because I cant fathom a reason why Lance would drop legit 20m within 2 days when its been stable at 105-110m for well over a month now and is still BiS at raids 1 and nothing has changed with it, if anything I would have tought it would continue to go up in price. Cant really think of any other reason why DHCB and LAnce would drop so drastically so fast besides they being merched.
---
Yeah the first time I ever used a quick guide it blatantly left out info I needed to progress the quest. I had to waste a few minutes on the main guide trying to figure out how to progress. Haven't used one since
---
Thanks alot
---
Ezscape
---
I made it on mobile, it's harder than it looks, also I just forgot to make it less obvious
---
&gt; then add a special item to the Gargoyle Boss (rare item 1/512 or something) as an add-on to e regular 30k gmaul to make it 50% spec again. That way the gmaul would probably cost like 5m+, making you have to risk it in order to do ags/dclaws to gmaul combo.
---
I like it, but I also feel like the attachment should also give it like +5 accuracy and +2 strength bonus. That way it doesn't feel like a straight nerf.
---
The struggles of questing on a UIM with literally any guide
---
Lol fair enough. Hope your day is at least better than your troll post
---
They are better because they are more efficient
---
Yeah it’s now most people’s end goal when in the past it may not have
---
Or you could just, ya'know, finish the quest faster
---
Yeah I think playing since 2005 and lots of different games has made me want to do less grinds I don’t enjoy
---

Or just do the quest and stop complaining. Not everything should be handed out. MEP2 hardly deserves the negative attention it gets.
---
I used to be excited for Gorilla tasks, I even extended them. Now after being 1600 dry. I’ve since I extended them and can’t wait for the task to finish. I have the tiniest sliver of hope hence why I still do them.

Wiki quick guides are the best!

What is the best way to level up or get money through a skill?
---
Do you vote no on all of the new content? (genuine question)
---
People like having something new to do. There's only so many times you could kill KBD before you got bored and wanted a new boss released back in classic. The same is true today. If you've killed all the bosses, gotten all the drop you needed, experience all you wanted to experience, it's nice to have something new in OSRS, rather than moving onto a new game.
---
I remember playing it when it came out and I was baffled to why this was a skill. And why it went up to lv120 instead of lv99. 
---
It could of been a great mini game to earn do lamps for Runecrafting. But not as a kill on it's own.
---
tast*
---
If you want to see what it'd be like, just look at the state of RS3's combat, where something literally like this is the meta.
---
It's pretty useless when you have no friends

Quick guides from wiki
---
Not gonna lie, I would've fallen for this one as a kid
---
You're asked to put an email there you do have access to. If you don't have access to the registered email, then you should use another. (Besides, if you had access to it you likely wouldn't be using the form anyway.)
---
Yeah man the amount of times ive struggled to pause my quest guide reading! I wanted to stop but just couldn't!! Read to the end everytime.. thank god for Youtube pause button!
---
Good for hit and run style, but overall the DPS for Ibans will be better (and cheaper). You shouldn't be as reliant on Prayer, as it's mainly needed for the first 3 brothers.
---
Trying to make money for a bond?
---
Every mmo ever
---
Or you know different people like different options?!
---
You can follow whatever guide you want.
---
It's a stupid clue tbh. I feel like requiring a second person to complete a step is a shit idea.
---
The crabs are from a song, the 11$ is a meme. Honestly cant explain it all but atleast you have something rather than nothing 😃
---
80 pray, 87 mage, 67 wc.

---
Look what I'm whippin' up
---
&gt;Without clue scrolls, I don't think I would ever have finished all quests, let alone half of them.
---
It's an interesting way to incentivize completion of quests with obsolete or unnecessary rewards.
---
I had no idea what I was doing and still enjoyed it.
---

Thank you! Really all that needs to be said. Some people wanna fucking argue about every fucking thing.. must be exhausting.
---
they needa make it so agility shortcuts don't require dairies, the skill is stupid because any useful shortcut is hidden behind diaries.
---
Every osrs youtuber at the moment
---
I have no parrots at all due to the fact that they can't be equipped alongside capes. This isn't the type of item that is going to be merched. Cosmetic TT items are high in price upon release and their price drops down exponentially after release, regardless of updates
---
You can use the same cc for heroes as well.
---
Best way to level up what? And if you want money start doing slayer, once you get it high level you make bank
---
Quest cape and I used a video guide for MEP2 and it was amazing for that.
---
either add it as a skill or it will die as a minigame unless it has op rewards
---
He wasn't even replying to the mother??
---
“The way that *I* do it is best and only way, anyone who likes to do it differently is cancer”
---
The only good quest guides out there that explain everything pretty well and most important: they don't play extremely loud obnoxious music
---
So he's mad at an actual update to content. Man is confused what polling is meant for lol, not every step or location has to be polled, that would be ridiculous.
---
Bandos chestplate before tassys, primordials and torture?
---
....no, they voted for it...
---
I'm not religious and "happy holidays" is fucking dumb. If Christmas is a part of the culture in the country you're in, then atheists and people of other religions should just suck it up and accept it instead of taking it as a personal insult.
---
Christmas is pretty much not a religious thing in the west anymore anyway. It's just a commercial holiday.
---
Then don't use it?
---
Agreed, even the potions feel like a time waster but not a huge issue, the rest is just pointless really. But, I can bare with it, scouting is just ridiculous though, I wish they’d rebalance the points and have a situation where you can design the run you want to do, with more points for longer/harder rooms. Of course this would probably just lead to min maxery but thats not far from the scout shuffle anyway
---
I'll always say slayer. 
---
For me, I was training slayer and happened to train my other stats
---
What? How is using a video guide a skill at all? Not saying wiki guides are but it's clear that a large majority of Runescapers were raised on video quest guides which is fine.
---
Well the guy asked how to make money in 1 day, and you declined to answer. Yes it's quite unlikely to make that much with those stats, well there is mort myre fungi at 750k+ gp/h with relative low requirements, but other ways is very unlikely, true. But that was not what he was asking. He asked for recommended money makers for his stats and you give alternatives that in no way are even possible to do in 24 hours, rather than giving the ones that he could do. Also check your original post, it doesent really friendly recommendations, it basically makes fun of his stats and says you could've been doing A LOT BETTER. Dude it's a fucking game and guy asked question. You didnt answer the question and made fun od how he plays the game.
---
At that point you might as well just store everything at your house and get rid of the bank. Put ores and herbs and logs in the garden. Put runes in the altar or rune case.
---
Patrick: Why don't take the bank, and push it somewhere else!
---
I agree with your post. Ive decided to do my rc grind by doing the activities I love like raiding, and using those profits to pay for ZMI runners. Maybe there's something you enjoy that could pay for runners? Or maybe theres a method of runecrafting that you enjoy but is less xp?
---
MTX is a dying form of revenue. Who are they speaking to that is out of touch? Best they could do now is skins.

my bad, im apparently a sperg and read "when you're at 1% health"

Dealing with investors can be a hassle.

Items on the floor only show up if you were online in that world at the time that the item was dropped.

You can literally test this yourself by going anywhere where people kill things and hopping.

You're short 378 weeds there!

Yep I agree 100%. Before Max cape released I was a 1800 total 126 combat main, only doing pvp and pvm because that's waht I actually enjoy. Since max cape is there now, I felt the need to get one, and i fucking HATE skilling. Currently 2 skills till max, and then never boreskilling again.
---
No

not sure, i think red chins are around like 5gp/xp? dont quote me on that. i don't have the math cause im a stupid, but i remember reading that chinning isn't that much more expensive than blowpiping depending scales/chin prices

Bizar to see so much players using YouTube as a guide. I still use the text guides, from back in the days when YouTube was just a little garageproject. 
---
I thought text is much more useful since you can check at your own wish. Not having to listen to someone say: “Please give a like and subscribe, without further ado” every damn time.
---
But I’ll give it a try since it is so popular!
---
What if potions were stored in the bank this way? I’m not sure how Jagex would implement it or how much EnGiNe WoRk it would take, but storing potions and rather than it being stored in 1,2,3,4 dose, just have “Super Attack Potion” stored and the number of doses stored. So each pot takes 1 bank slot, and you withdraw the amount of doses you want
---
Wtf is that image
---
Yeah I know, but what I'm saying is that shouldn't be limited to a 3rd party client and not everybody likes using 3rd party clients... (Only reason I use RuneLite right now is because of the GPU renderer)
---
Spin flax for a second bond

So, the Gauntlet that's coming in Summer 2019 ™ ?

I hate when you set up your inventory exactly as the guide says and then they say "ok now bank everything"
---
I decided to go from Vannaka to Chaeldar because people said it was much better xp and points so after getting a 150 rockslug task I was hit with 12 steel dragons as well. Haven't touched slayer since.
---
Sounds like free smithing xp to me
---
It's because seeing what tile the dude walks to, what area he's in and the exact spot of the item or npc you're looking for.
---
Guides are too vague, it's like "walk East, then South, then North, you are here. Take item, continue to next step.

I've spent hours searching what npcs look like. Videos are LIFE!

Ash is one of the OG's AFAIK. He went to Uni with Andrew Gower and shit. He's been there from the start. He's like the heir to the throne in my opinion.

Make sure you didnt choose a deadman world?

I really enjoyed DG so i'm all for this.
---
The main problem is that doing this would take up A LOT of dev time for how small the osrs team is and i'm not sure if a minigame should be one of the 3 big updates for the year (pretty sure it would take enough time to be compareable)

The UI was a bit hectic to make/get around to, I am not the best in creating something fancy/useable in terms of UI. The issue of having the scrollbars was not something I had thought of before, thanks for bringing that up!
---
The reason why I used sql.js is because "having a DB" was one of the requirements of the project. I tried to decrease weight and download time by caching the db with a service worker but I still realised that this was a bit too heavy for the site and annoying to work with. After the experimenting I was planning to either use JSON or CSV files for the next iteration. CSV could be easy for when people want to edit the data by themselves. The ultimate idea was having the possibility to 'select your data source' for the calculations so you can add theoretical new items and such.
---
The separation of the UI and calculation code was a bit tedious to do when using vanilla/plain JS (and I am not a JS guru) and only on a 1-2 week timespan, I was not 100% happy with the end result and it felt hacky/dirty. I was possibly going to look into Angular with TypeScript for my next version (strongly typed &lt;3).
---
I did not know that there were other people working on their own DPS calcs and reinventing the wheel would be a bit dull. Maybe working together on some sort of open source library could be a good approach to this. I will DM you with my Discord details if you want to chat on there :)
---
Thanks for reply and time, I really appreciate it!
---
Good bot
---
You should be able to imbue Torag's Hammers thereby turning them into two Mjolnir's with a thunder special attack. Honestly the most ambitious crossover in history.
---
How many 6 year olds reported this guy??? 😂
---
The resource and mob dungeons existed before eoc hit.
---
My only real issue with duneoneering was the rewards. It offered untradeable, bis by a large margin, weapons and armors. Plus once you got to where you could get them, the future ones came by pretty quickly. Chaotics flooded the game with really powerful weapons that were easy-ish to get, and made many bosses pushovers.
---
Shut up Chevis
---
In addition to the drops above, this monster has a 9/249 chance to access the standard rare drop table.

pretty common loot to get.. nothing special

Hello! Thanks for the heads up and your reply!

I was already using his formulas that he posted on the RS forums as a source for the maths behind this. His spreadsheet was also a huge help to debug some stuff and figure out when what set effect is applied :)

It's funny how you get downvoted, how is it different if you have to spent an hour questing, or spend days in mlm to get the mining outfit lol
---
Literally every guide ever:

So first of all you wanna tick/flick this and that..
---
In 2007 every guide ever:

Brah idk u just get food and do spec or smth.
---
Enlighten us then.

26 ores bro almost full inv.

I HATE YOU
---
Gambler's fallacy
---
Only if there's a mini-quest in which we have to burn it down.
---
Time and place, dude. This isn't even remotely an appropriate conversation to have right now.
---
Ok
---
LITERALLY every other MMO has a support section that replies in like 30min-12hrs on weekdays. Jagex still needs top posts on reddit to actually do smth in under 48hrs. Wtf..
---
I've been collecting torags hammers for months. Really hope they buff them.
---
It's a shitty attitude to have regardless if they're on the same droptable or not.
---
what is this day job thing
---
Jeez it's only that little these days
---
You could allso just press pause on the other vid and listen to a the quest guide you know...
---
And why?
---
I wasn't being serious, I think literacy has very little to do with it. The prevalence of video guides is simply a result of a natural tendency towards low effort, high gain behaviour. To watch and listen requires far less of us than to read, and the audiovisual space is extremely dense with information. My issue is that they are usually very sparse on relevant information. I don't have an issue with video guides, but I don't think much guides that are a minute's worth of bullet points stretched over 20.
---
If it was changed. They will scam so much with it
---
what guides are you reading?
---
No, no, no, no, no, no.
---
I would use a better password if I didn't have to type it multiple times a day to log in. But that really isn't singificant considering how passwords currently work (they're not even case sensitive).
---
No, trust us when we says it’s a*pain in the ass* to go back. I’d highly recommend just getting the extra talismans now, but ultimately it’s up to you.
---
Normally I say take a screenshot but I feel like this monitor pic is better for this.
---
Thank you.
---
147kc and nothing ☮
---
A good solution is playing the video guides at 1.25 or 1.5 speed. This is for me the quickest way to get a quest done.
---
Its because the vid was made before jagex changed it to where youd need the oil. Allways check the comments before watching
---
Didn't cover username, that's mine
---
Oh wait...
---
I mean I agree that it's mostly a different playstyle that people like OSRS more, but you can't sit here and say MTX have nothing to do with it. MTX in any MMO has been a dying breed of MMO for a few years now. Most MMOs with MTX have been dying off/losing tons of players because people know better and don't deal with it anymore. Several decent MMOs have been dying off for the simple fact they still function around MTX. Meanwhile all the rising popularity MMOs are ones without MTX, or only "MTX" for things similar to bonds for premium status in these games.
---
DH isn’t worth it until 90 base cb stats
---
RS3 isn't a very good game, it's WoW lite with more MTX. This is coming from someone who is maxed and trim comped. 
---
The game has been gradually losing players for years now, that's not the definition of a good game. Just because it has some good aspects doesn't mean that there are huge problems making it bad.
---
DH is better at 90+ combat stats, including HP
---
Yeah sorry for the circle jerk, I just don't know how to work YouTube that's why I use the wiki guides. :(
---
thank you.
---
I just got back to the game a bit ago and I've been using quick guides they're so good.
---
The first time I've used a video guide was MM2 which was a good idea
---
yeah i havent been on anything like twitch or such gaming platforms to find odd websites and or links, i only tend to watch youtube. and my emails are always secure
---
Most people don't understand what millennial's are smh. Most millennial's are like 19-36 years old now or something.
---
The ranged void is very strong, so I got 75 ranged pretty early and took advantage of the toxic blowpipe with the void attack bonus.
---
Also used the one slot switch to do barrows with extra invy slots.
---
Yes let us store everything in the house from every piece of clothes, armors and weapons to even the most obscure quest items. Have a toggle to where the butler automatically sort everything out as soon as you enter your home as well. Speaking of Butlers might as well make a slayer master your butler as it makes things even more efficient.
---
That’s what I am doing.
---
how do people like you exist?
---
It also gives crush def I think
---
You having fun?
---
I mean people have always bought gold - and for way cheaper too. I know so many 2000+ total levels who buy gold, you only have to look at Sythe.
---
I don't think that's extremely likely. It's not a very commonly traded item, and the value is always shown in the trade screen.
---
It can’t even detect devices at least when it comes to PCs, it just white lists the IP you are on when you check that box. 
---
This means if you give them one of your codes they will likely have the ability to bypass it longer than the 30 seconds or so the code is valid.
---
The Rune cupcakes were a great touch.
---
Only lose if you sell

1 hr? So half a vid then

You're free to have that opinion.

Oh, sorry I meant I use an 8 way tribrid switch for each brother

Berserker only gives Strength, no attack or defensive stats I don't believe.
---
Sweet, I’ll try it thanks
---
Interesting, so all those times when I thought I had typed the code within 1 second left and got the clutch login was all a lie
---
&gt;Wait, does he just say the same fucking shit every week then? At some point youd think they get the idea and what's the point repeating the same thing over and over?
---
I assume they'll have meetings about the future of OSRS and how they're going to generate revenue. It might not be weekly anymore but I asked him about it in twitch chat some point last year and he's said he's had multiple meetings about it. It wouldn't surprise me if once a month he had to speak to the investors and go over how OSRS is generating revenue and their plans for the future. They don't play the game so all they see is RS3 making money from subs + MTX whereas OSRS is just subs so it's his job to explain why MTX wouldn't work
---
Maybe it's not such a bad idea after all, then. I'm ready to start the next chapter of my life.

---
!remindme 24 hours
---
Not a crap idea at all but it just has side effects that aren't immediately obvious. I think the other reason was that people like the fact that clue scrolls are a nice distraction from slayer and you have to choose between continuing your task or maybe getting a nice clue reward. If you could just stack clues you would carry on with your slayer grind and then have to grind out all the clues you got
---
Void mage into dhide then? Time to go finish my set at PC

thanks alot man, huge help.

Very true, regardless of price the gear itself still holds a certain value &amp; usefulness, I haven't sold anything I'm just moreso curious if everything will either rebound or the econ is balancing out &amp; in a week would be a good time to buy more stuff for the low. All my stuff has a value to me in a way because I use it all

I mean, starting raids on a main doesnt exactly require maxed gear and stats to do. There are plenty of people willing to do raids in mom-optimal setups just to learn it. 
---
Raids have essentially replaced dungeoneering, especially chambers of Xeric as it isn't as combat focused purely as the Theatre of Blood.

Nice try Evil Dave, your mother is always home

Tons of people doing med clues and getting ranger boots. Atleast that explains the price drop in peg boots. If you lookup peg crystal you can see it had a pretty nice spike in price(%wise).

am i the only one that flat put uses runehq, isnt it much more time consuming to watch a guide than just read for 2 seconds.

The wikis are not immune to this. Sometimes it's their fault and other times instead it's that they don't tell you to take everything at once but you do anyway in an attempt to save time and end up having to bank regardless.

Ideally yes, however I wrote this somewhere else in the thread
---
&gt; The bank system would be my first choice as well. However, I picked the parameters for the room based on something that should be easy for Jagex to roll out and using existing assets.
---
&gt;The barrels themselves can have their code repurposed from the NMZ barrels which are player-specific barrels. It would just mean changing the potion data value and making it consume vials.
---
&gt;The herb table and possible secondary ingredient larder could both use code repurposed from the seed vault or costume room assets just with a different itemlist.

&gt;Jagex have much on their plate and something like this wouldn't take much to implement but would have a decent enough QoL improvement.
---
How are those even related?
---
Lmao RIP. You had 1hp. And walked through an active battlefield. Deserved lol
---
Okay but my point is hard clues drop from some pretty commonly slain lowish level enemies (like cyclopes, ankous, bloodvelds, etc.) and telling someone who's been playing for maybe a month to just go do one of the longest quest chains in the game (which will probably frustrate them into quitting before they even reach MEP2 if they have low agility) is a little much. I'm pretty sure before this clue step, even elite clues only required regicide at most.
---
Can you add black graceful and ironman max capes with their respective colours like the symbol/armour?
---
The trebuchet that fires on the battlefield got you good and proper.
---
TF you doing on 1hp?
---
doesnt make any sense since this happened overnight, tbow -60m, sang staff -30m etc. all high tier pvm gear is crashing rapidly and i really don't buy that people are selling their 2b bank of gear to buy a dumb clue reward
---
No no no no, they are all good tasks and have enough go on there tables already without noted bones
---
No one was in your world on your friends list?
---
Is this not what the new minigame will be with song of the elves? Just single player.
---
I didn't get that fucking hood til at least 84 every game that dropped it every other fucker got it as a drop or gave to some one else reeeeeeeeeee
---
Low level? I got mine at lv101 combat and did the same thing. Fuck the randoms at ba, I got shit to do
---
Oh that's nice thanks for the info. Currently I go to that patch using the ranging guild tele.
---
You don't have to watch the video guide in 1:1 speed. I usually have them skipped a bit forward so I don't stop running during the quest. That'd be more efficient than stopping to read to figure out what to do.
---
Are you an iron?
---
Will something be done about shayzien gangs? People that enjoy making special accounts have to heavily compete for the kills.
---
Would it be possible to make them private events? making a fixed cap every hour to stabilize the XP rates? since now you can go from 5-10k xp hr to 100k+ based on competition at the time, server timings and how well you have mapped out the spawn timers. Also you have to mass hop making it very tedious. also, it only starts to get effective 3-5 days after reset (thursday) as th
---
That makes no sense? 
---
Lower levels? You need 62 slayer... most ppl have 62 once they have an average cb... 
---
And how are high levels rewarded when doing wyrms? If you mean that you dont make enough cash on wyrms task then I disagree with you...
---
For 62 slayer (relatively low requirement) you can make couple 100k just in alchs .. pick up bones and run them to bank and you will make around 300k per task...
---
Barrows is full of less than great rewards. IMO there's no reason the weapons shouldn't all be at least better than a rune scimitar.
---
This is bait guys, don’t fall for it
---
Just a regular old main \^-\^
---
Like noted bones as a drop like kursks 30 noted big bone drop? Or actually noting their bone drop? If its the latter then its no across the board for me. If you have to note bones to revive new content then theres a bigger problem.
---
I fucking did fall for it when I was a kid.
---
It’s just the one swan, actually.
---
Muh game integrity
---
Been up for over a year. Seems like some people genuinely don't even realize it's a private server and not a new game.
---
WoooOoOOoaaAaAaAAAhhhhHhHh this guy has 200+ QP! Guys look!
---
It's okay to show the name in this case
---
Just remember to close the fucking gates!
---
The point wasn't the quest points, it was that the wiki quick guides are objectively better than random YouTube video guides.
---
But okay, you do you boo.
---
Lol what. 
---
No. Your cell phone and account is secure. Put 2fa on your email though.
---
No, normal account.
---
I definitely have mixed feelings about it. If I have the spare points to block them next time it comes up, maybe I will, but it feels like a waste of points.
---
I’m way faster with quick guides. His videos are too slow
---
Does kraken boss make money even if i use trident of the swamp? I feel like \*\*more than half\*\* the money gained from loot is spent on charging the trident
---
He must be using za warudo to hold that scimitar
---
Patience... It takes time to develop something like that and rushing security issues is *not a good idea*.
---
It's true. I still haven't gotten a dagganoth task, but so far the only one that's been decent XP is cannoning trolls. One day maybe slayer will be fun.
---
Nice.
---
I mean yea it is, but if you bought pegs, anguish (not even used for Vork), and a bunch of chins before Rigour and DHCB then it's not really the best way to spend your gp.
---
Nest clues have existed for a while.
---
Who kills guards in pvp world's.
---
just under an 80 mil drop huh? hmm.. maybe a merch clan bought a put in a ton of low ball offers considering the amount sold was on a steep incline the past few days, causing people to repeatedly sell it under-valued? No incoming updates that I can think of that would cause a panic sell, so that would be my first guess.
---
I rarely use the cbow unless I have to. How does it compare to the MSB imbued?
---
The worst experience I've had following the wiki guide was MM2. They forgot to mention that you should probably bank everything and bring stamina pots/graceful for the platform part. I don't dislike the platform by itself but constantly waiting for run energy to replenish was rough.
---
But bcp just looks so sick, worth all my inefficiently spent gp
---
Dude how long have you play runescape?? It’s just normal to most of us playing over the years. There’s always PvM if u find PvP unfavorable stay out
---
I hope you aren't serious.
---
Should we remove levels to cure that then? See how this goes down a slippery slope catering to people's potential life problems? It's just supposed to be fun and games but this game gets people doing crazy things psychologically. 
---
It's not just a case of remove this thing because some can't control themselves, most others are having a good time doing these problematic things.
---
When you say the entire joke in the title then again in the post
---
surprised no one brought up it would help out one swampboi
---
That’s true. Right now, I’m still trying to budget around 55m of free cash so I invested in those because I was doing bp nmz. I’ll take your advice and save up a lot before committing :)

Those doors were always just bonus rooms, and the most efficient dungs you just found the boss as fast as possible and moved on to the next floor leaving those bonus rooms unopened.

You are so fried

always had a hardon for T hams, but they do suck

I keep doing bird houses since some time and never had one nest clue from this. Maybe this was just bad luck.

k i have to ask, on my acc ive started ds1 for access to the anti fire shield, but im 77 slayer and done over 200 tasks mostly at chaelder. currently im 74 cb. I still haven't gotten a metal dragon task. Anyways im about to start using chaelder anyways but id like some more information on why this is.
---
No reason for the drop, I would guess its being merched.
---
Dio must be using za warudo to hold the scimitar like that
---
Farming Guild Updates:
---
Can Hard Contracts reward Anima and White Lily seeds. They are not very valuable and it seems strange that a skill that required 0 combat till Hespori now has content locked.
---
Can Hespori be killed via skilling, use anti posions, plant cure, compost, pruning it, etc.
---
Can the bottomless bucket be added as a reward to the Tithe Farm, seems like a fitting way to improve what you can spend points on.
---
Waiting for work to be over
---
Of course a 126 bridding with a water staff and crystal shield would be complaining.
---
No, they don’t even ban the sold account if you sell and recover the account.
---
True. could maybe make it untradeable add on for arcane instead
---
Meet Letics, my Morytania Man. After recently, my man, I decided to ante; to scratch. No banking, no Morytania. All leading up to taking Runescape. **Blood**.

need download

Things can be different without “dividing” us making things unrelateable lol
---
Lol ok they existed for one week before Slayer. Dang can't believe I remembered that wrong.
---
You have clearly not actually listened to the jmods talk about this issue and are just guessing based on nothing lol. Ash and kieren have both said on a few occasions that the primary hurdle to group ironman is the pid system. The description they gave is basically this: the game knows what stuff you can interact with as an ironman because of your pid. If someone drops an item, the ironman can't pick it up cuz the game knows that a different pid than his dropped it. The only way they would be able to make it so players can trade with other ironmen in their group/pickup their stuff from the ground/heal them etc is by pid. But since there is no permanent basis for pid assignment, currently there is no way to make a group that will actually persist beyond logout. To make group ironman they would have to totally overhaul the pid system, which is integral to the way the entire game functions so it cannot simply go away.
---
There is an image in the pollblog showing the bottles and nests for beginner clues, indicating they were gonna be added. And if new items get added into a droptable, everything on that table will become slightly more rare as a result.
---
Dota calls its creeps creeps. Lol calls them minions. Good try though
---
MEP2 is the only ques I did with a video guide, and I think it's definitely the move there
---
I have tried to give rs3 a shot since I originally quit in 2010 and it's just too different of a game to play at this point. I've tried the new skills and they seem dumb as hell. And what was once a decent bank when I quit is worthless because of inflation (which is expected after as many years but still).
---
So you use your big boy hands and click "X" it'll pull up another whole webpage on the fastest way to get to "X" whether it be a location or person.

Btw
---
The price of gold on rwt sites was already that low when bonds came out. Not the other way round.
---
I'd be interested what evidence you have for that since they don't publish sub numbers.  Strong anecdotal evidence is that WoW did quite well during Legion
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
---
Bout tree fiddy
---
Yeah I guess you're right. God forbid you interact with other people on this MMORPG.
---
O
---
What? That’s in no way what he’s saying. You’d be right if he said while you’re here you can stake just once.
---
Almost all high value items are plummetting in value actually
---
That's like 2 days worth of play. You can expect disappointment.
---
I'll put in edits to make sure every tile is counted, for evrrything. Sorry for the inconveniences.
---
No, but letting people play for 3 days straight without a break is another extreme. (Yes, I've been there)
---
I think that a small minority of people at the duelling arena enjoy themselves. Do you know people in-game who gamble? You either go there once and never come back or you develop a problem for life. I know a lot of ironmen who started their account so they can't gamble anymore.
---
The duelling arena isn't even legal, since gp is buyable and you don't have to be an adult to play.
---
i know that feel bro.literally follow second by second and then the shit happens
---
Not sure if you're serious but it has been an intentional joke ever since d square came out.
---
But what if you had group Ironman with everyone on the game? Like everyone worked together to collect stuff and anything you didn’t need you could give to another players for some kind of compensation.
---
I literally have nothing better. So it will do.
---
Had to go finish it off at the wilderness altar in thanks to our Lord Zamorak
---
If you got a drop after being very dry (99%) would your dryness percentage reset to 0 or would it still be adjusted to represent the overal KC vs drop ratio at that point. 
---
I guess what I’m saying is I often find if I go ‘dry’ that it seems like I might get a few really quick drops or back to back drops to bring back in line with the ‘droprate’ I guess always landing on the drop rate would produce 50% dryness? 0 dryness would be Landing a drop ok very KC.
---
I’m not great at math but just trying to wrap my head around the concepts. It’s very interesting to me how we experience probability. It’s not ‘prohecy’ This WILL happen. But probability, this SHOULD happen. 
---
Thanks for the post.
---
Whatever teleports you use. I personally don’t like the portal nexus. The interface takes too long to navigate. 
---
The portals I have in my house are: Lumbridge, varrock, falador in one room; Kourend, Ardougne and camelot in another; then just Lunar Isle in the last. Then I have ornate jewelry box. I can pretty much travel to any destination I want with those teleports
---
I have the same set up and I can usually get 2 kills a trip rarely 3 and sometimes 1. So if you suck than I as well suck.
---
I like to use both. Have slayermusiq and a wiki guide open
---
I know how to, was a little excited. First time getting rangers on a clue :)
---
That’s pretty average until you get rigour. Can’t really get too many kills per trip anyway because of inventory space
---
Trust him when he says we say it’s a pain in the ass to go back.
---
It's wayyy less clicking than tick manipulation training methods.. Unless you're spam clicking to move after you water/plant. If you get the timing down, it's just a couple clicks per second.. idk, I feel like I'd more likely get RSI from a lot of other things... \*shrug\*
---
A mimic ring? No other ring exists that are 3rd age lmao.
---
Videos are good for quests like MEP2
---
Also even before we knew that all clue drops had the same rarity and people thought rangers / wizards were on the same table we NEVER had evidence that holy sandals were added to that “table” when they were released. 
---
People were just like “well they are also boots so it must be true” and rolled with it. Really stupid.
---
Ye, my bad. Will do next time
---
And then I noticed they was about 8 stories tall!Realized that damn Loch Ness Monster gone tried to fool me again! So I said: You ain’t getting no tree fiddy from me!
---
Mothers do make the best cakes!
---
I'm excited for a new skill :)
---
Very nice. 100iq move for sure
---
Gotta get that internet clout lying to strangers so you can feel special 👌
---
Not neccisarily, we could just have a component of the tanks be something you get from an NPC that wont sell to UIMs. This already exists in the game. Tank sealant or something of the sort.
---
And lottery companies take advantage of that.
---
Like scratch and wins where you have to get 3 apples in a row or something will have a ton of cards produced where there are 2 apples so the player will feel like they keep “almost winning” and buy more.
---
People who do tithe generally aren't people doing tick manip lol. Literally nothing from Tithe is worth getting except the seed box for ultimates
---
It's a thing with streaming in genera for sure. There's the guys that set the "meta" (like DrDisRespect), the guys that follow it (majority), and some outliers (Maximilian Dood comes to mind, has a very unique style, love his streams). Some of these might blend together but there's definitely a noticeable pattern
---
no thanks
---
Bruh why are you so obnoxious.
---
Guava?
---
How long does it take you to read a single sentence

You should be using the wilderness altar, unless you're playing a hardcore. If that's the case, gilded altar would be fastest.

Wait this is legit?

Oh my good Guthix no!

Did resurrect crops not save the boy?

It’s a trap!

i came here for the rod, i'l 6k fish in and still haven't saw one, but I saw 3 on my skiller under 10k fish lmao

Can't you just remember where the stuff was?

I used a video guide, got caught, and was able to find everything again easily because you just went there 5 minutes ago.

Prims are at a high of 35 and Peggy’s dropped from 31 to 29 this morning.

This is an Imgur gallery. If you click the picture, you'll see screenshots of 100 of my casket rewards.

this guy is just mad that he gets roasted for wearing a fury and bandos chest before torture, barrows gloves, tassets, prims
---
You wouldn't know, though, as you've never used a video guide.
---
It's a shame what's happened to his channel, but I used to love A Friend's genuine reactions to drops (especially his older videos). 
---
You would just hear him sit up in his chair followed by a "oh shit" or "hey look at that" or something along those lines - no screaming, dancing, keyboard slamming, none of that asinine shit.
---
no, sorry, giving up +3 magic and +4 range is not a "significant bonus difference" at all LOL you are only wasting effort with the extra switch
---
well, he didnt deny that mtx are coming
---
By the way, I forgot to mention one thing. My password was NOT changed. That's why I'm so surprised. Does this means they just randomly guessed it?
---
Hasn't been polled yet I don't believe
---
IF you had charms. Charms fucking sucked. All they did was force you to use up an inventory slot when PvMing, and when you run out, your summoning xp rates drop through the floor. Summoning was just pure clutter.
---
Would you mind if a f2p player starting to make a pure and a bond join, or do you not want a potato like me hanging around the chat
---
I wouldn’t worry about it too much.  Prices always rise in the summer once the playerbase bumps up
---
Still in the dev blog phase i believe. Definitely not voted to go live yet.
---
I'm a quick reader but its just about ease. Honestly I'm over it, it's preference I've used both and I prefer vids. If you prefer the wiki guides then use them. Don't see the point in this conversation
---
Wow wtf noway, they actually didnt ban me for saying¨DOES SOME 1 HERE GOT SOME FLAX?¨ you are next level genius, mind is blown
---
Awesome cake. Too bad fondant taste like playdough. It's all about the butter cream frosting.
---
Welcome to revelation unraveled, I’m your host William Tapely, the third eagle of the apocalypse and the co-prophet of these end times. Did you happen to see the pattern on this old school runescape minimap? It resembles a phallus. Jagex is morally bankrupt and hides satanic pornography in their game.

Did not think so. Asking because I am max and not wanting to go another 99 lol

Scrap iron Archer - no shops, must fletch every bow, arrow, bolt, kill chickens for feathers, no avas
---
BIS at Hydra, raids 1 too.
---
It looks better. Conjuring is pretty interesting, as is the silkworms and the AOE wards. Dragonbane stuff has me on the fence though. Not sure how OP it would be.
---
Ngl gives me harry potter vibes (atleast the part about battle wards)
---
We need another dude now, you can be the text guide
---
Insecure about a quest cape. 
---
What a fucking weird statement to make. Nice.
---
As much as I want to see that guy perma'd, I don't think inciting witch hunts is ever justifiable
---
alright i’ll hold on the them for now. I wish I didn’t buy the DHCB for now though because I want to get some solid bandos gear to use with my friends. I just planned on using it then selling once I made some cash. 
---
I guess it’s just more incentive to farm more vork!
---
Dragon crossbow is worth it if you use the dragon bolts the cbow can use. If you're not gonna use the dragon bolts then there is very little difference between a rune cbow and a dragon one.
---
I really like the ideas here but there seems to a massive portion of the community that will never vote for a new skill, unless it was slayer 2 of course.
---
If we wanted chaotics back I'd do it as an upgrade to existing weapons. Turning an elder maul into a chaotic maul ect. Although I think dungeoneering would still be good enough if there was no reward shop at all. If all dungeoneering gave us was resource dungeons, and maybe a few more new unlocks, it would already be the best skill in the game.
---
&gt;You completely missed the point...making friends in RS is the best part about this game
---
Speak for yourself lmao i love this game and certainly not for the community
---
When the quick guide doesn't have directions to a person/place, the regular guide pretty much always does
---
Ok buddy, clearly an illegal activity.
---
Probably get some hate for this but try practicing on a spawn private server for a while.
---
Not really. You can keep the leveling system in, just don't put it in the skills tab, and make it more self contained.
---
It's also just really convoluted. What's the upper limit? 5? 10? 20? How will leaderboards work? Will there just be a lot of them? How will people quitting be handled? Are you just going to have to accept that you're just an ironman with a different colored helmet if your entire group quits after 3 months? Neutered on the leaderboard because you're a group of 5 but 3 of them actually quit? etc.
---
And to add on a little bit to what you said, if you want to be a group ironman, you're far less likely to cheat on it than if you were a solo unofficial ironman thanks to peer pressure.
---
Or those dudes not keeping minimap static while guiding through a maze
---
I'm just trying to find out why you fucking spazz out the moment someone mentions their quest cape. Pretty sure you're the one making weird statements here.
---
Yeah, I'll be voting no that's for sure. Imo it's just another buyable of which could have been added to crafting and Runecrafting. There's absolutely no need for a new skill when some skills are real shit to level right now, this may be a very nice way of making currently boring skills a bit more enjoyable. Either way, it'll be a no from me :)
---
Awesome on maxing by the way bud :D
---
Not gonna pass lol nty
---
I’m aware. It’s still too high.
---
It's like Ronald Mcdonald copped some Justiciar.
---
Wow wtf it sounds like he barely received any legal punishment at all for his actions.
---
I skimmed but it seems like 6 years in Thailand and less than 5 in Canada.
---
Maybe Thai prison really sucks though.
---
You can cannon the soldiers in the cave by shantay pass. It's like 60k/hour, tied for your best task. Definitely slaughter them.
---
Riiiiight
---
It sucked as a skill because you were forced to grind it to 90s so you could get chaotics and that was literally the only use for it.
---
Hi There!  We expect to poll the skill in **May**, which means you've got plenty of time to tell us whether we're on the right track, or whether there are wider changes you want made.  Feel free to check out the latest blog [here](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/warding-design-blog?oldschool=1) for more information.
---
If you're a main, just go to world 330 and use someone else's guided altar. I built one in my house right when I finished my construction training, and I haven't used it at all, because of the extra work of making sure the burners are lit all the time. It's way easier to just let someone else deal with that so you can focus on the prayer training.
---
Not sure for certain. Couple 100mil at least
---
Same, I love video quest guides, Slayermusiq1 2 hour mm2 guide helped a ton
---
Ugh why
---
What the fuck
---
Thanks
---
Craws bow is very good on anything in the wildy. Especially if it’s weak to range. Keep in mine you risk most with craws now cause you have to load it with 1k ether so people will see you and auto pk you because your a guaranteed 175k or so
---
Smithing suffers some more...
---
Magic doesn't need a rework.
---
That’s probably the stupidest thing I’ve heard
---
The xp you get is proportional to the bars you use! What a concept!!!!
---
5 rune bars = 375 xp
---
3 rune bars = 225 xp
---
375/5 = 75 xp
---
225/3 = 75 xp
---
What a fucking concept!!!
---
u need to collab with pink skirt guy
---
wut
---
This appears to be a combination of summoning and invention from rs3.
---
Okay.
---
Well then.
---
We do not need new slayer monsters, bosses, or pvp content.
---
I will vote against them every opportunity.
---
He does shit super slow though
---
If you just want exp to work your way to 99, you really don't need to do anything at all besides a fruit tree/calquat run per day. Unless you are ultra efficiently maxing every other stat there is a 0% chance you get everything else 99 before farming so it's not a bottleneck anyway. 
---
If you want more pet rolls do belladonna, mushrooms, and seaweed
---
If you want more money try cactus spines and yanilian hops
---
How would you redesign it?
---
One of the few legitimate arguments against it is devaluing 2k/2.2k worlds, it might be a little weird shifting to 2.1k/2.3k but it’s a small issue with a few ways to fix it
---
Im very concerned about balance. 
---
So right off the back, chance to absorb melee damage, much less 50%? What are you thinking. Pvp doesnt need any of that. Ely is incredibly OP and makes you capable of tanking 3 tbs vs just one person, and u only need to tank one. People are unkillable deep wild and this wont help. 
---
There are no requirements on the armor outside of lunars, are they all 1 def? Im assuming not. Put them on there. 
---
The lunar change to magic atk is dumb. It will completely unbalance pvp unless this shit costs like 50m which i doubt. Right now rune pures have the choice between xerics, mystic and infinity, and they are already the strongest accounts in their bracket until like 95 cmb. The new lunar armor is just infinity with def bonus. Well thanks, you now lowered the risks of zerks while making them even stronger meanwhile it seems 1-39 def is receiving no buffs to compensate for this. The set effects on the stuff like soulbark, bloodbark, etc are so OP that i cant even begin to believe they will make it in so even if they required 70 def, im not sure how 70 def will be buffed.
---
Poor people with maxed capes.. wave goodbye
---
At the end of my quest cape grind, I would use the wiki to get all the items I needed, then watch his videos for going through the actual quest.
---
&gt; the only exception to this rule within the game is the salve amulet
---
Which is awesome. If it's conservative at first, I see no reason not to add another thing that uses the mechanics of the salve. Just don't stack it with the slay helm!
---
If you want to bring people not following laws into the equation then any discussion about employment law is pointless.
---
How many osrs skills do you think would realistically pass in todays poll?
---
Wow, did you try using a bond on yourself irl to change name?
---
The pid system isnt prevent group ironman, the pid system just doesnt have supporting code written to do it. Just like any other yodate, jagex has to implement the code. You implied that the way the pid system is written it is completely impossible to implement group ironman. If this isnt what you meant then disregard the convo, if it is... you are wrong. The fact that it can track which drop is yours between pid changes is enough to support that it can be built upon to support group ironman.
---
This may seem fairly minor, but I am concerned about how full the f2p portion of the map is getting outside of the wilderness. If we have to add new monoliths to the f2p area can they be placed on new land rather than the existing map.
---
I love how the pitch for warding is that we have smithing for melle armour, crafting for ranged armour, but nothing for magic armour so let us introduce warding. Smithing and crafting are simple skills that don't overly effect the core game. Warding  is way more than a skill to create magic armour. It's a total rework of the magic combat skill and I'm not okay with it.
---
I was part of the 5,000 surveyed on the warding skill and I was asked whether I would vote yes or no. I said no. The next question was could your mind be changed if the skill was tweaked and I said yes. After reading the blog my answer is still no to warding. I never mentioned wanting more useful rewards and milestones. I specifically wrote that I don't want imbues leaving NMZ. I don't support dissolving because it feels too much like RS3, even if it could help sink items. I never said anything about the terminology being confusing but that the skill in general is too complicated. And lastly, I don't care if the skill has to be trained at a certain location, but did say I would prefer if the xp rates were on par with smithing and crafting.
---
I wouldn't mind warding if the skill had less to it and didn't change the magic combat aspect as much. As others have said in the past, aspects of warding could easily be added to the current skills we already have and I would be okay with some of those ideas.
---
Do certain magic armours need a buff, yes. Do we need more magic armours like Arceuus, Bloodbark, Soulbark, Cosmos, Dragon'hai, Kinhunter, and Venomous, yes. Do they need to be introduced with warding, no. A lot of the ideas pitched with warding are very cool and I would vote yes on them. Although, I do think they should be split up and introduced into the game separately and slowly over time.
---
Just a few of my opinions. Feel free to agree or disagree. I'm okay with having a civil discussion.
---
I'm fine with it being ideas that are already used. I'm just having a hard time trying to find ALL of the restricted ironmen lol.
---
Holy crap the new armour is absolutely ridiculous. 
---
Kinhunter would be double the magic % bonus at Olm.
---
Venemous would be vastly superior to ancestral at Zulrah.
---
Adding this would murder ancestral, which comes from end-game content and is currently one of the better rewards at Raids 1. 
---
This is a huge red flag for the skill if several new BIS armours are just lopped in with it as craftables.
---
I dont want warding
---
I am going to stand in protest in Falador square. People should not be targeted and shun down on for having a name they no control over! This is ridiculous! Many prayers and wishes to you and the Diggas residence. #FREETHEDIGGAS
---
it really doesn’t make any sense on why ring imbues exist in the Nightmare zone, whereas this gives them purpose and backstory on why they exist. I’d argue that ring imbues currently don’t have a “place,” they have a location but no reason for that location. They can always increase the total level requirements for those worlds to make up for the fact that there’s a new skill, make them 2250 total words instead. I feel like at this point for mage to be relevant at all the next update has to include some sort of BiS gear or armour, because the state of the skill is so bad currently
---
If you want, send me some bank pics and I can help you clear it out. With the seed vault now, even on a very late game iron I still have over 100 free spaces
---
They don't want any non-pvm content at all.
---
I can still log in after a moment. The problem happens when i start hopping : i just get logged off and get this message the first time i try to log in. My internet connection isn't the issue
---
Olm mage hand would get shredded by it.
---
I think the reason most people don’t do slayer with mage is because there are a lot of better ways to train it, plus runes are expensive
---
no u
---
Agreed, we have way too many slayer monsters. Idk about pvp content, we havent had much.
---
In my 169 quest points or whatever it is for quest capes I never had issues with that. I like the quest guide for quests that aren’t linear and have a list such as rag and bone man.
---
offer nothing to the game? wut????? only skill i can really think of that offers nothing to the game is firemaking and maybe thieving
---
Cheese cape :(
---
Ah good sn (suggestion)
---
Dev blog looks okay however I have absolutely no interest in a new skill. This bullshit argument that “OSRS needs a new skill. Now is the time.” is just garbage. 99.9% of the player base can’t even keep up with the updates coming out every week. There is no ‘need’ for a new skill.
---
That’s a fair argument, I think the main reason it was added was because people didn’t want a skill just to have a skill, they wanted useful things they’d benefit from.
---
I’m somebody who works significantly more than I get to have recreational time. I make a lot of money because of this - but it leaves me unable to enjoy the things I really love doing. I’m fine with paying to progress or ease how difficult it is. Nobody says you have to invest in the game if the option is there for you but it would certainly benefit people like me
---
Oh no things are going to need to be rounded by like 5-10%!!!!
---
Hey!
---
For slayer, to earn points do I need to keep going back to the same slayer master? Im trying to get to level 55 for the broad bolts but would ideally like to get the slayer helmet too but im not sure if just picking the closest slayer master every task is the right thing to do
---
You can't compare unintentional mistakes to a new skill which would have to be intentionally added. If you actually think a new skill is comparable to a DMM fuckup you're too dumb to help
---
Some people are more visual learners than others, that doesn't mean they're stupid, lol.
---
Would you be willing to compromise and have a damage boost on off-hands as well? Take out the armor damage buffs and keep them on weapons, amulets and off-hands. Think like a book of dragonkind or a venomous orb.
---
It shouldn’t even be polled, Jagex are putting so much effort in trying to get a new skill out there yet there’ll be little bitches going “ooh please don’t change the game 07scape” when the game is already nowhere near to what it was like in 07 with all the changes
---
Yeah I’m well aware dude, like I said I’ve never gotten a paycheck in 5 years of serving because cheap assholes like you are few and far between. If you don’t like tipping go to McDonald’s. And if you’d like to be enlightened as to why it’s necessary, let me know
---
its not PVM content!?!? vote no!
---
They could just make it a permanent upgrade/sidegrade to ancestral similar to how it works with Cerberus boots.
---
Also didn't mention that dragons can't be clumped together and are mostly located in single combat areas unless noobs want to get a pile of baby dragon bones as their loot LUL
---
Of course a new skill in an initial blog without a video of gameplay sounds complicated, but in essence it’s gather materials and craft goods like smithing/crafting
---
you state you dont want to take what people earned but in the next sentence u state u are taking what people earned
---
I am very confused. What is happening to my imbued berserker ring? Right now an imbued ring (650k points) takes 20mins to get. Are imbued rings going to become buyable (u buy the 2ndary) or will they take the same amount or less time to imbue?
---
Triggered slayerscape brainlets who are upset they aren't getting new monster to hit.
---
It is absolutely what i meant and it is based directly on what ash and kieren said so I'm not wrong. You just don't understand the system as well as you think you do clearly. You are arguing with a direct claim from ash. Good luck I guess?
---
everything would pass if it was polled, warding is over-complicated garbage
---
I'm excited for this but I will say battle wards and conjuring will likely split the community and be pretty controversial if it has any effect on PvP and/or significantly affects PvM combat.
---
I personally think the battle wards could be fun, especially for raiding and other group PvM content, but would not like to see them enter PvP.
---
Conjuring I'm less certain about - again, definitely wouldn't want to see it in PvP as while I think some changes like new weapons/spells that affect the meta are fine, an entirely new PvP related skill is taking it too far away from the old school way of combat. PvM it really depends how its implemented, could be decent or could be terrible.
---
there will be a playtest.
---
literally anything that isn't a new slayer boss.
---
Hope they make that optional
---
all he said was that it’s possible to store extra robes in your POH without using backspace? Chill the fuck out
---
Well there's obviously no point in simply adding a magic smithing skill this late into the game. There has to be other components of the skill that will bring new features into the game. These features will increase playerbase activity and lead to a popular new skill. Letting low levels craft mystic robes on a game that is mostly in it's endgame just doesn't make sense.
---
This community is too stubborn with updates like this. Refusal to add new content that isnt 10 more slayer updates
---
That doesnt sound like very good friendship...
---
I don't know is it? Kind of hoping it is.
---
Tell me where i said easier. I said more enjoyable. I agree no skill should be made easier.... It's a grind game after all
---
"We want more useful rewards" does not mean "please murder Ancestral with new craftable armours." 
---
Ancestral's best use is for Olm and Zulrah. It's also one of the best rewards from Raids 1. These rewards would just make Raids 1 slightly faster and less profitable, and zulrah even faster, when average kill speeds are already just over 60 seconds.
---
Share the direct claim?
---
I feel like the armor bonuses should be adjusted a bit or maybe even just buff Ancestral some but don't go crazy. Other than that I hate the battle wards and the conjuring idea can right piss off. No to both of those otherwise this skill is a yes from me.
---
I wanted to make a Karamja only UIM back in December 2017, 6 months before his series release.  [https://i.imgur.com/bay1Ras.png](https://i.imgur.com/bay1Ras.png) 
---
I never bring it up, but I just wanted to point out how stupid it is that people are constantly compared rather than just doing their own thing. There have been restricted Ironmen since 2014, if anyone is being copied it's them. No one owns the right to a style, a phrase, a theme, a title, anything. Creativity is wonderful, and welcomes more great work through inspiration.
---
Yeah of the good bosses, magic is pretty much only used for half of zulrah, kraken, and barrows iirc.  That is a TINY market share.
---
This is the humor that i thrive on
---
I mean, there were other rewards too. Very useful ones as well. Off the top of my head I can think of the skilling scrolls that saved seeds/bars, rigour/augury, arcane stream necklace.
---
Your argument can be used for many skills in OSRS. For example, the only use for 90+ construction is to have ornate pool plus jewellery box, and yet those two things are so useful that so many people will train construction for it. Same goes for skills like agility, firemaking, runecrafting, etc. Those skills could be removed and the game wouldn't be any different.
---
Eh, they're also salty about their lack of content. which I agree with.
---
4 sets of BIS, and not even by a small margin either.
---
Powercreep much?
---
The game is Oldschool RuneScape, it's only called 2007scape on this subreddit. The game runs using the older engine, it doesn't run to emulate the entire experience you had in 2007. Changes have and will be made to the game.
---
More balanced time era pking wise
---
I like how instead of arguing against the plausible idea of jagex rigging polls that would financially benefit them, you just comment "lolz tinfoil xD "
---
You mean battlewards? I agree they’re a terrible idea. Its a crafting skill... it shouldn’t be used in combat at all
---
I’m going to screenshot/come back to this in a month
---
Thanks! I think I'll try all of these.
---
And he doesn’t even have the firecape
---
That cape looks dope. But better not remove imbues or it’s gonna fail lol
---
 Can clue scrolls be brought in line? For example, some clues require you to open and then search the drawer and in other cases its just opening. It gets confusing and id love to see it be consistent. Preference goes to just 1 click solve of course :)
---
It fills gaps in the midgame mage gear which I think is really good for anyone under 70 mage. 
---
Imagine if the only ranged gear pre-70 you could use was green d'hide or Hard leather bodies, that's essentially what happens now with Mystic for mage and warding fixes that.
---
It's buffing areas it's already good at. Max mage at Olm already murders the mage hand while keeping you at full hp with the sang staff. 
---
Zulrah already forces mage and ancestral is insane DPS there.
---
This is so cool actually
---
u/brothergreed
---
You ok?
---
I mean you're bothering him at his home, just leave the dude alone
---
This. Warding could so easily be an expansion of Runecraft or Magic etc.
---
I'm glad to see underutilised armours getting updates, but I feel there's some design choices in the proposed robes that would overshadow existing armour like ancestral in raids (Notably against the Olm in Chambers of Xeric, and Undead in Theatre of Blood). 
---
I feel like instead of damage bonuses, they should offer increased accuracy instead. To make them more viable in place of this, maybe they could have changes along the lines below:
---
- Dagon'Hai simply no longer degrades.
---
- Kinhunter's stats would be charged using numulites like Ancient Wyvern Shield, but it won't degrade in combat. 
---
- Venomous robes could improve the chance to venom / poison enemies with the Toxic Staff and Smoke Spells. 
---
- Honestly, I think Cosmos robes are fine, so maybe they return to Lunar robes once fully degraded.
---
On top of this, I feel like the the Bark armours should fill a more tanky role rather than granting damage bonuses, but I do like the melee range combat theme. Perhaps Bloodbark could drain health while in melee range, and soulbark drain prayer. Other than that, I like the design!
---
They can just create new crafting content and drops on existing monsters or new ones with future updates to implament your ideas. Warding has more negatives then positives, especially when it comes to balancing some of the mechanics warding offers in both pvp and pvm.
---
&gt; I can guarantee you that 
---
Except not because they didn't specify in the blog. 
---
If the solution is to add expensive ancestral cloth, this is no different than just buying ancestral now.
---
If the solution is instead to add cheaper cloth that yields more powerful armour than ancestral, than that's just power creep and poor game design.
---
Yeah, managed easy enough without it. I had the 2h - the gfx model rocked!
---
The problem isn't keeping racists out (which I very much want), it's people disregarding the proper procedures and deciding someone is guilty by themselves. It might work in some cases, hell, even the majority or them, but eventually you're gonna get someone innocent being harassed.
---
I'm open too a new skill. Not warding. Why? Because like MOST other skills its NOT fun.
---
It depends on the NPC, some look more suitable for bare feet and some don't. 
---
For Lyra, well she's wearing the same shoes from my other post of her but it's just isn't visible in this one. I could maybe add the lower half of her legs in the comments.
---
torso looks like shit and the bcp looks great with his outfit though.
---
FashionScape &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EfficientScape
---
It was supposed to be in the arceeus spellbook actually I remember they wanted necromancy as the spellbook, so they probably thought lets put it in a skill instead. I think the spellbook would be a better idea.
---
But wasn't Reddit spamming them to hide poll results, they didn't do it for no reason.
---
&gt;OSRS needs a new skill.
---
Why? I have never once in my 200 days played on OSRS thought hey OSRS needs a new skill.
---
Yeah they are great, he even keeps the compass facing north, so mirroring everything is super easy!
---
Because it makes no sense that a crafting or smiting skill can be used to make imbued rings or magical armor. Sure you can weave fabric with a thread and needle, but that doesn't give it magical properties.
---
I see he tried runecrafting already
---
Isn’t Australia as big as the USA? Maybe some people on the other side of the country get worse ping
---
Your points and concerns listed here are entirely valid but you don’t know that it’s going to be useless or as limited as you’re saying. You’re making a lot of leaps there. For instance, we have no idea how rare the mats for venemous/dragonkin will be. If rare enough they’ll never crash because those will be BIS armours for raids/zulrah. We also don’t know the limitations of dissolving.
---
I say this all not to convince you to vote yes (I don’t like it after the blog and am voting no). I just wanted to point out the jumps in logic you’re making. IF those are your reasons for voting no id probably ask jmods for clarification first
---
Same here... I got Ancients and Lunars, I NEVER use Lunars and I only use Ancients when I go burst dust devils for slayer lol.
---
Yeah OSRS definitely needs to take more pages out of RS3's book, because RS3 is way more popular and successful than OSRS.
---
Amazing great to see you guys really took into account the communities suggestion love the silk worms!
---
They definitely offer something to the game. It is something people can do for money, it has an effect on the in-game economy because when there's demand, people will supply by making it..  
---
Firemaking is the only skill I can think off that is just a pointless filler.
---
What is iirc?
---
Milestones?
---
Well to some extent, low level armours still have a purpose. Currently, Mystic robes have a 40 magic and 20 def requirement and are the go to for many lower level players. Having a variety that also have niche abilities are a great way to expand the skill. Damage bluffs to certain monsters on lower level gear would be okay, but maybe like a 1% bonus on a full set. Something that says I am worth spending 80k for.
---
The fact that people would be able to get to 50-70 warding quick and mass produce these low level robes for everyone is a good thing. It provides a quick cheap alternative.
---
With so many new shit coming it feels like pvp - and mostly nhing/hybriding - will see a revolutionairy change. Not sure if it's for the better though.
---
Was hyped for awarding until I saw al the extra stuff they added on. Completely against the imbues, spilling rings, random combat bonuses, and the combat wards. This skill was just supposed to be for making mid level gear for magic
---
I read through the whole blog and was under the impression that all wards are an item that you have to craft beforehand, meaning battlewards are an item you would use just like a potion. As long as you don't need level X warding to use a battleward, it works similarly to how potions work. I'm not saying I agree with the idea of battlewards, but it is definitely not a new combat skill.
---
This Devblog is just them saying that they cant think of any interesting content that would warrent being a new skill instead of being added to crafting/rc/mage, so they just decided to give it good rewards instead. (and move some mandatory item imbues over to the new skill)
---
Or just do barrows IN the house party world for that matter.
---
You’re right. Simply because rs3 is less popular means there is absolutely nothing it has ever done right.
---
Don't you feel good about yourself
---
He's never had mass viewers when skilling either, just pvm and dmm
---
It depends.. it wasnt fun if no one had the item u looking for. And u sat there allday typing.
---
Shit I would honestly rather have a reworked divination skill then warding.
---
What a fucking idiot LOL
---
A friend of mine recently did it on his UIM to 77, I think he was getting around 25k ish an hour?
---
Oh so the .5% of players that have max mage gear and use sang staff for an end game raid are going to be affected. 
---
Fuck don’t even discuss possible alternatives, no to warding now plz.
---
I think I've been pranked then
---
Wow very cool
---
Well said. I like a lot of the ideas proposed here, but I do think a lot of it could be cut back and put into runecrafting (as you said, the giant monoliths are basically just rune altars, I see no need to double up on mysterious stone ritual sites in the world). 
---
I like many of the ideas for new mage armor and existing armor buffs, obviously they'll have to tweak them and whatnot, I know everyone's up in arms about ancestral being devalued. Conjuring is a little iffy to me but it's not full blown summoning, I don't know enough about this aspect yet to say much. 
---
Again, I like many of these ideas but I think this is a big missed opportunity to breathe some life and diversity into runecrafting.
---
Pog I got 3 uniques in 9 clues, made 800k.
---
Guess I'm lucky
---
I think the skill is fundamentally flawed based on the points I already made and if it really were up to me (thankfully it's not) I'd scrap it entirely.
---
Devalues my bone sack locked ultimate ironman
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
Hmm i read it as well and got the impression it was something you create from the crafting components on the ground at the time of creation. Kind of like firemaking. Which i believe they even reference about ward beforehand in the blog
---
Voting no to any new skills out of principle. Maybe improve the 20+ skills we have already, seeing as nearly all of them have room for much more content.
---
i like it, hope it passes
---
Thanks for the reply! Im working towards 77 and would just like to change it up a bit once in a while
---
I don't think it's new skills as much as it's an unfamiliar combat system, mtx, and other issues. People generally love most of the new skills. The only skill in the last decade that a lot of people didn't like was divination because it was basically a classic gathering skill.
---
If I Recall Correctly
---
Quickest No I will ever press on :)
---
Agreed!
---
The problem is your bring back chaotic weapons
---
So the new solo minigame in prif?
---
It's been a while, maybe I should try a kill to remember. I know that it's at least easier to know at what tick a respiratory system dies, but it could also just be a psychological thing 😂
---
&gt; The fact that barrows is a popular minigame is irrelevant
---
New content needs new rewards. If content is not rewarding enough to play it starts to get called "dead content" for a reason. If you place all the good rewards into one piece of content, there is less reason to play more content. 
---
Barrows is already popular because it is already rewarding - why would you make it *more* rewarding? Why not use that reward to promote new content. 
---
&gt; Maces have similar stats as shortswords but slower
---
Context is just as important however; the Dragon Hunter Crosssbow has less stats than the Armadyl Crossbow, yet because it's better in a specific context it's still widely used. 
---
Same deal applies here, it wouldn't matter that maces had weaker stats if certain monsters were so much more defensible against other weapons that maces were the best dps. Sure they'd never be used specifically to train combat stats because they still have lower dps against low-defence mobs but you don't need every weapon to do everything, you just need a purpose for each weapon-class. 
---
It's not, it's something developers have to consider when thinking about game design long term. Content requires design space, if load too much of it into content which does not need it you're risking the balance of your game.
---
Right. You know what else is craftable? Dragon playebodies.
---
Not talking about accuracy. The mage strength bonus on ancestral is 6%. Kinhunter would be 15%. Crazy.
---
&gt;You got a source? I'm pretty sure video assisted training for jobs and other learning activities shows greater retention of information
---
You DO realise we're talking about Runescape quest guides right?
---
Yeah but that was kinda the point, It would be a nice mix between Ironman and also making friends would actually be useful.
---
zzz
---
Maybe you make them somewhere between Ahrims and Ancestral damage-wise but include the defense mechs he described. This way, there is a trade-off of inventory (not needing anti-venom/fire etc.) for slightly less damage.
---
Can i steal that? It's too good not to use
---
We will need more bank space to accommodate all these new items but I’m for this update. We need more things to prolong the life of rs
---
With that mind set we will be back to rs3 in no time pepehands
---
There's been a few times where I've gotten lazy and just taken my whole stack of laws out to whatever I'm doing, and then accidentally died. Feels bad.
---
Won't have to, because there's no way this will pass.
---
?
---
People needs to realize 100iq is not genius
---
Ronan has done a video in the past to explain warding already
---
Yea but a lot of people have jobs. and dont wanna spend the time they can play, buying things.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that, but those 2 things combined are why people get the bonecrusher. Does anybody use it outside of the catacombs unless they just leave it in their inv?
---
I hope it will be super worth it to dissolve items frequently, it's such a good item sink opportunity and means many items will be dissolved instead of alched, preventing a lot of gold from entering the game too.
---
670ish (don’t exactly remember and I can’t log on rn) with my only drops being the Jar of Decay and a Dragonbone necklace
---
true
---
Blowpipe with extended super antifire with praying mage works
---
Fair enough reasoning but another way to put it might be if you have to roll two 6s and you roll one 6 and one 4, practically youre just as far away from two 6s as if you rolled double 1s.
---
I’m not saying to witch hunt everyone. I’m saying witch hunt people using racial slurs like this example. Idk what the confusion is. These people make whatever community your in worse, should do whatever you can to get rid of them.
---
Blame Mod Ghost. Guy has absolutely no concept of keeping the games aesthetic. Everything he has ever made has been either way too big, too bright or has too much purple. Without fail.
---
Then I see no point in making it craftable.
---
Don't see why we need a new skill just for the sake of having a new skill. Enchanting and imbuing can be a part of other skills/minigames (as they already are).
---
His videos are the best because he rarely every moves the camera, and when he does he says why and how he does it. Also, it's funny how he goes from 0-100 in his butthurt level when RNG doesnt go his way
---
You realize visage is 1/5k right? You're far from dry
---
I would add summoning, turmoil, dung ect so yeah.  People in osrs complain yet were to young to play rs3 before eoc.
---
that makes more sense then. Would still seem a bit weird to require a spade though because you can bury them normally without a spade. I think the right click option to bury on the ground would be nice though
---
Thanks bro
---
Yeah if mts ever get added I’ll quit the minute the update goes live lol
---
ironman mode
---
I would definitely prefer individual segments. Some of it sounds cool, but some of it just doesn't seem to fit.
---
Xp/hr likely won't be affected by anything in the blog except for the warding skill itself. With smiting and crafting having pretty damn high exp/hr I don't really see that being an issue. Ironman EHP may change due to being able to salvage materials from stuff though.
---
And his wife?
---
too many words.
---
on the iPhone's podcast app I was only able to find The Wilderness Podcast, and I don't pay for Youtube Red for that podcast to play in the background while I play (and I think you can no longer do the safari trick to play youtube videos in the background like you could before), I'll still check them out tho
---
but thats the older version of warding is it not?
---
What level?
---
I've spent 450 hours raiding and had an ancestral drop 4 times. Please tell me why it shouldn't be 9 figures?
---
I think it looks very cool! My only concern is the Conjuring, which sounds alot like summoning to me. Besides that, I really like the idea for the skill!!
---
I disagree I think the rewards are garbage but it fits the difficulty of the boss.
---
I'd vote for slayer 2 just to see what would happen.
---
Ok great suggestion, I’ll probably raise my stats a bit and accumulate some starting gold and then try that with my trial, what other suggestions do you have? I don’t mind doing some idle work I usually watch tv and mine or make pizzas or something
---
To me it sounds like you're describing granular interaction in the "open world" context of an MMO. Filler content is a term used to describe content with no real purpose. Also most of the people saying they wouldn't vote yes are citing the balance changes introduced to combat as a reason for their no vote, not bc "its useless content".
---
Prims doesnt give you a single point of damage, meanwhile bandos makes you tankier, using it with sgs makes most of the tasks cost free.
---
I mean, just because you don't enjoy a skill doesn't mean it doesn't serve an important role in the game. As they stated, Warding has a niche place in the game, covering things such as crafting magic armor and imbuing, both of which are pretty dead to me.
---
Thank you for posting actual feedback. A lot of the comments in this thread simply list problems they have with the content without describing a better way to do it.
---
I was poking fun at your belief that your QP count makes you an authority on what’s better, ya dingus
---
You can also just never close down the Runelite window with just a rs account.
---
Did they forget about the granite ring imbue?
---
Sounds fun, Cape looks nice af.
---
My point was, mid 60s in any skill doesn't take long to get so adding the imbues to warding isn't a big deal. I have zero issue with the levels required .
---
Quests
---
Way too much stuff proposed. The focus should be on making something comparable to smtihing/fletching but for magic items. Warding should not be a part of combat nor should it involve conjuration.      
---
The proposed armor sets that specifically target types of creatures are also just a bad plan. Since similar item sets (dragon being the exception) don't currently exist for the other combat sets, it's pretty clear that it will by default become best in slot by a very long shot. The bloodbark having damage scaled to distance to the player is also a mistake. Magic attacks already deal a ton of damage very consistantly and freeze attacks are already extremely powerful, it really does not need a flat damage buff, especially in pvp.     
---
I appreciate that there's a lot of creativity but making such drastic changes to the game is flat out a big mistake and could really hurt the game.
---
The new dev blog definitely helps I agree, I'm not totally opposed to it. Just trying to show the argument is flawed that just because a skill we have currently wouldn't make make it through a poll doesn't mean we should lower expectations for a new one.
---
Can’t wait to Vote no on all my accounts
---
Stack max clue stacks so that you can destroy gear then get it back with clues whenever you need it. META
---
Please provide me the proof that written quest guides are objectively better than video quest guides.
---
Is this something you genuinely care about? What's wrong with you?
---
What it looked like to me is that for every imbue you will need a specific item like an archers engraving for the archers ring(which will probably be a rare drop or something), and if they do "unimbue" the rings with the change they will give you the engraving so once you have the level you can reimbue your ring without having to buy the engraving or go rare hunting
---
This is what I do too, feels faster.
---
High kc with no unique drop is already bis tho
---
Lazily designed, dead on arrival skill. Can't wait to vote no
---
ancestral will still be best in slot for bursting slayer tasks, the new robes would just be better from damage bonus on certain monsters. I.E. the dragon hunter lance is best in slot melee against dragons, but not against anything else. The issue with mage is making a staff that powerful would be difficult, as staves historically have been for less rune use. Having mage robes that make you deal more damage against dragons isn’t going to make ancestral useless, just as the dragon hunter lance being implemented didn’t make other melee options useless, they’re just not as good in niche situations.
---
Magic is strong against melee not through defensive but through utility and high accuracy, which makes perfect sense. It doesn't need to be tanky against melee as well. That's something pretty much only RS3 does.
---
I'll be voting YES if it's a grind and profitable and a pain the ass.  
---
I'll be voting NO if it's a buyable and if I read something about dismantling stuff. 
---
I'm simple.
---
Why go with degradable armors wher previous polls showed the osrs comunity is against it?
---
Look up collection log on the wiki.
---
They hid the results to rig this poll.
---
But if you think ancestral is expensive then this new bis gear could be 10 figures. You going to cry about that as well when you can't afford it?
---
!remindme 3 years
---
its free discussion champ
---
dont like it, leave
---
From what I am understanding of the top comments, some of you are afraid of change.  Luckily, those comments are from the monitory. Bring on the new skill! We can’t shape warding if it never comes into the game.
---
800k points takes maybe an hour with dh
---
Theres nothing inherently wrong with summoning, just that RS3s summoning sucked. If it could be done well itd be a shame to vote no just because its similar.
---
That said, battlewards, don’t think I like. Think they sound interesting but fuck playing the stand near a tile game.
---
I never even mentioned the word dry. But yes, thanks for doing the maths that I couldn't be arsed to
---
Cmonbruh gotta keep nmz alive somehow
---
This literally could just be an expansion of Magic and Runecrafting.
---
Not really.
---
We need bank space if this is gonna happen
---
I will vote yes to Warding.  If you want to be oldschool forever, discover a way to stop the time and return to 2013.
---
That didn't happen to me
---
the early pieces are very cool how they all differ since they’re from different regions of Gielnor, but this OCD playerbase likes everything everything symmetrically colored equivalent
---
vote no
---
they are, says in tiny font under the set
---
assume does one in church
---
Counteroffer: please tell me why your decision to do the same exact thing for 450 hours should veto adding more options into the game because it would slightly devalue your decision to do the same activity for 450 hours.
---
This is an excellent point, and I hope a mod finds this. However, I get the feeling they know this is a disaster and are being forced to create new content by shareholders that fear the game will become stale. This seems to me like invention, summoning, and divination jumbled up into one skill.
---
Upvote for beta
---
But we already have our rings imbued. We already have what they're proposing as a reward. I don't want to have to grind for hours just to re unlock something I've already had on my account for like 2 years. That's a punishment not a reward.
---
I don't think so. Those would not have any impact on the economy
---
If you think Kin or veno armor will be higher then 40 you are dumb. Why would anyone with a high combat lvl use magic to kill dragons when dhl and crossbow are better and faster?
---
So you will prepare something, and use it to get a buff in combat, exactly how is that different than preparing a potion and drinking it in combat, just because one is drinking a potion and the other is drawing on the ground, the end result is they both require resources prepared ahead of time, and they both require an in combat or before combat action and they both result in a buff...  If your so worried about using it in combat and only in combat then use the ward before you start the fight, and be sure to not use prayer potions, brews, or super restores, wouldn't want you using a crafting skill mid combat.  Like the two things are exactly the same in functionality...
---
100% false. I'm 120 cb. Use ovl,dh, max str. 6hours ez
---
Conjuring sounds way too much like summoning, which was the beginning of the end for RS2. Call me old fashioned, but I wish we could just have a version of 2007 that actually stayed in 2007.

Dozens of hours of playing the mini game is not “free” any more so than grinding for GP is.
---
Thank you for the post, this is the stuff i like to see from feedback. I personally would like this skill in the game but you bring up very good points that i also agree need to be addressed.
---
Hope warding passes, the game needs more skills IMO.
---
I'll let you figure that out on your own bud
---
They still could have rigged them without hiding them? I think it would have been easier to rig with visible poll results. Seems less suspicious
---
&gt; most players won’t gain a bunch of levels all of a sudden just because there’s a new skill in the game.
---
Active players LITERALLY will though rofl.
---
Ahh. Thats why it seems so strange to me.
---
Ty
---
It could be 13 figures too.  It could be 69 figures.  Or it could be some value based on its supply and demand values that may or may not be reasonable but has no bearing on whether or not the armor itself is good.
---
\&gt; You going to cry about that as well when you can't afford it? 
---
I mean I'm not crying about this either.  You're the only one who has an emotional attachment to moneyscape here.
---
NO FUCKING SUMMONING JAGEX WTF
---
That's gonna be a no from me dawg
---
I had plus 2k total, and I agree what the guy above is saying. 
---
For you to discredit his opinion is laughable, because you’re quite clearly talking shit.
---
Rs3 was in decline when mtx and EOC came out. Summoning changed the entire game in that bossing is considerably easier when you’ve got a creature behind you with 28 super restores stuffed up his arse. Sort of takes away the excitement when you’ve got enough food to feed an army packed into the cavities of your war tortoise.
---
While it’s fine from you to hve a differing opinion to the guy above, attempting to be condescending just makes you look like a prick (as well as a severely autistic neckbeard).
---
I will however say that personally I think your opinion is absolute bollocks. If you’re so in love with those skills and all the shit RS3 had to offer, you can always log into that game? 
---
Cos I’m certain that most of the ‘high calibre’ players on OSRS (who you seem to imply you belong to) would agree in that we don’t want summoning or dungeoneering. In fact, I’m positive about it. So for you to claim you’re part of the majority, and to try and discredit what the guy above is saying by acting as though you are the bastion of public opinion, is quite frankly retarded.
---
Really? Looked fun to me, stop overthinking it
---
Better to test it and find bugs and get community feedback before releasing it, rs3 didn't bother to do so for invention which led to some people finishing 120 in about 2 days
---
If slayer was voted to be a skill today it wouldnt pass.
---
The amount of stuff in slayer can just be a minigame at this point.
---
Earned and Nmz don't work in the same sentence
---
Shit skill imo will never level/use it
---
Warding hype! Warding hype!
---
Do you enable as many bosses as possible? There's no way it takes six hours.
---
&gt; just as the dragon hunter lance being implemented didn’t make other melee options useless
---
It literally did, Ghrazi's crash from 300 -&gt; 175m happened because Lance replaced all of the niches of Ghrazi except Slayer, but most people training Slayer can't afford 300m for Ghrazi. The same will happen for Ancestral when the Bane armours come out.
---
Damage bonus is just stupid for Mage gear IMO. The main problem with Mage at bosses is because of how Magic DEF is calculated, which pretty much guarantees that gear with %Dmg Bonus will never be niche, and always replace Ancestral against bosses where the Bane armour is applicable and Ancestral is already good in. It's why I'm pushing so hard for an alternative effect, the Brimstone effect, since getting around Magic DEF would actually create new niches for the gear and make Magic a more viable style as a result.
---
new mage robes may require ancestral to be broken down for the specific rare components
---
Preparing something before hand and being required to use the skill in combat are vastly different. They’ve described making wards as being similar to fire making which means you’re going to have to actively train the skill in combat scenarios. You’re not going to stop mid fight and mix up a pot, craft a dhide top, feltch a dart, craft some runes, smith some knives. Thats dumb. You shouldn’t be making wards mid fight either.
---
Oh I always understood it as getting it more or less frequently than average. If you get 3 in 50 kills you got it more than expected so its above the droprate
---
Lol nice try kid sit
---
Those black and white swords would look tight with the black and white graceful. And those purple robes with proposed warding cape design would be fire. I like lots of it, nice job
---
Is this bannable, if not where is the best place to look for said runners?
---
Unless you added or allowed the new Armour to be an attachment to ancestral with the set effect or damage bonus vs whatever you decided to fight
---
&gt;I am concerned that the staff, many of which aren't high-end PVMers, are trying to implement too many combat changes at once without fully understanding the impact it will have on the game.
---
This almost feels like an EOC mistake of epic proportions.  There also doesn't seem to be any thought on how any of this would work in pvp
---
Crafting is such a bloated skil as it is
---
I’m not. Some kind soul on here talked me out of it, I woulda hated myself for it. I just feel like I’m constantly hitting walls I wanna trade and use the bank, but I’m going for a quest cape and then I’ll make it a normal account
---
Hm? Melee has arclight for demons, ranged has dragon hunter crossbow. Probably more in there somewhere if you want to say like tbow is an anti-magic bow.
---
I agree. I don't think it should be added in its current state.
---
I vote yes on most things even if I don't do them. I'd rather have myself get upset with new shit than ruin it for everyone else.
---
You should edit f-keys to make switching etc more easier. I use f1 spec, f2 inv, f3 pray, f4 magebook and esc for fast log-out :D You can practice speccing at dummies in player houses. Most important just go and die. Keep dying until you get good. Pures are cheap way to practise 1vs1 or go and join some multi teams (example rev cave pk:ing just press attack and wait Pvmer to die). Add more switches when you feel like comfortable.

That would happen to me while I was spam clicking without looking. Randomly ended up upstairs in a different building. Doesn’t necessarily mean he was autoclicking
---
Hurry up and quit already little bitch
---
I agree with you. It does feel like enchanting crafted gear could cover the creation of new and lower level gear. I feel as if warding is content for the sake of content.
---
Just make it so the bridge in Mort Myre Swamp gives Warding xp and let players summon genie's with Warding. Not even Settled could resist dopamine drops like that.
---
Yeah same has been like that for over an hour.
---
I am especially against the fact that they are planning to remove imbues on items that I have spent time and effort getting. Why the hell can't people just keep the items they've earned?
---
Certain small aspects of this update appeal to me, such as rebalancing magic armor that sees little to no use. Just do the rebalancing and leave the skills alone. This skill seems like it has way too much overlap with other skills as described in other comments.
---
Vote the way you want to, but I'm definitely voting no when this gets polled.
---
Before I knew what PM was in 2004 I asked my buddy for his user and he replied "are you pming me??" and I thought he meant "rupmingme"... Was very confused for a few days lol

Edit: found it. Look up "Runescape 2007 Shilo Village Chinning. Should be the first video
---
I'm certain that GIM would have a different colour helmet than the others, it's too drastic a departure.
---
I still don’t like the battlewards (I don’t like them for osrs) but them being something precrafted that say you drop to use would be a lot better since it fits the theme for how crafting  skills come to play in combat.
---
New skills bad. 
---
Upvote to the left.
---
What category does bonds fall under?

It was a fun minigame but shouldn’t have been a skill, also rewards were too good for being free and quick

It’s so hard and I guess that’s the point

Jagex said 1/3 of their revenue comes from MTX (including OSRS bonds) and 2/3 comes from subscriptions. Since the vast majority of players play OSRS (you can check the live player numbers and hiscore changes), most of their revenue now comes from OSRS. 
---
Source: Interview Jagex gave to UK Parliament last month.
---
slayer is a minigame
---
change my mind
---
I know I’ll b very safe if I do quit
---
I really want this to pass, but no chance it does honestly, no skill ever will, such a large chunk of dev time is being sunk into ideas that people are too sceptical about and will never want. Just stop with the new skill stuff because it’s not going to happen, people want a new skill but have no idea what they want that skill to be, this fills a gap in the mage armour creation zone but the game has gone too far for that to matter. If this was put in a start of osrs it might have a chance, but people who this skill would probably never affect will vote against it because they believe it will without thorough research. It was a nice idea guys, but something like this has to either be forced into the game or just abandon the idea as a whole please and focus on other areas.
---
Kurasks as well
---
It is sad to think you actually spent time coming up with an idea this stupid.
---
Just go to the f2p pvp world at lumby lmao

Yeah people said that at the time and if it were a short amount of time I'd agree but he was running back and forth for ages until he ran out of run and then started walking back and forth for hours.

Good call. I've moved that to the end.

I wanted to include some type of qualifier because I figured people would constantly ask what makes me a "veteran" player.
---
I think the biggest thing that both Jagex and players want is an item sink, not so much new gear, but I could be wrong.
---
Are you 13
---
Somewhat sure it originated in EQ. Could definitely be wrong though ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You're the only one here who cares about internet points, and even if I did I have plenty.  
---
If you're trashtalking karma when you have 1.6k across 3 years, I'd hate to see how bad you are at raids &lt;3
---
Tell that to your sense of self worth
---
What
---
Nice, you just playing normally? Or chinning/bursting?
---
Powercreeping ancestral, speeding olm and zulrah kills per hour isnt just a niche.
---
Im ok with imbues being removed from nzm since a fresh account can access that with little effeort and the reward is just too strong. But craftable gear that is better than ancestral in the few scenarios were it is usefull is a terrible idea
---
My account was made in 2016 yes, recently just started using it, I don't care about the karma or that you're losing it. I care that no one agrees with you m8. Your views on this subject, people don't agree with. You shouldn't have a say on higher tier content because you're never going to be higher tier my friend. Just stop, it's you embarrassing yourself. Not me.
---
Why would you trade your cash stack for a drop party?
---
Sounds to me like you should de iron so you can enjoy the game a bit more. 
---
I’m the same, I like the idea of an Ironman but I just figure the amount of time it takes in comparison to a normie isn’t worth it for me as I can only usually play around 8 hours a week. 
---
If you are going to de iron after quest cape you might as well de iron now as it’ll make the quests considerably quicker
---
Fuck you ima vote yes
---
I don't want this based on what I see here. Doesn't justify a new skill. Please consider adding this or some of these things as Runecrafting rework. Feels like adding a new skill just to add a new skill.
---
You mean crafting/smithing for magic? As those are for range and melee
---
Ovl were so nice in dg.

Sounds to me like you should de iron so you can enjoy the game a bit more.

---
Did you see the craftable infinity robes? Did you read about the passive ward effects?
---
Because there are people fondly remembering Korasi, D&amp;D, and vines.
---
Like i said, not the karma. I just find it funny that no one agrees with your opinion on this subject.
---
Check my post history, been saying that and getting ragged on for MONTHS. Open up the Rune mysteries questline, rename Runecrafting as Warding, giving both skills a slow xp money make and a fast xp money sink training path. Done and fucking donezo. The rest of this looks good, but the warding grounds should be replaced with expeditions into the altars. 
---
Access to altars becomes easier while leveling up, which could make Abyss dead content unless its resource and rare item locked. Perhaps you have to help set up base in each of the altars in a RfD multiquest questline. 
---
Soap is stupid, replace with ground up rune dust and leave the lanterns to channel their fine but unstable energy.
---
Better that way imo, leave the higher levels open for new stuff and don't force people who aren't interested in the new skill to go hard training it so they can keep their current imbues.
---
The new mark armour would most likely just be rag armour. Offensive stats will be low with decent defence. Mystics will still most likely outclass bark armour.
---
Ill go never been to one of these
---
I think the value and rarity of Infinity Robes is tied to the mini game and should continue to be that way.
---
We wouldn’t poll obtaining fighter torso or void armor from other means, why is this different?
---
Those are 2 different things though?Car is depreciable asset while the dhcb would be an investment in the case I was referring to.
---
Btw pal,I’m not your buddy :)
---
The worst feeling is grouping up and you are needed for every skill door when you are on your own path.
---
If crafting is bloated then that would mean smithing is extremely bloated. The entire "materials &gt; cloth &gt; armor" methodology already exists in the game anyway so I would argue \*not\* adding it to crafting is what is the more "bloated" choice
---
Especially if you're using the amulet of the damned so you get higher defense at lower hp.
---
2015, when it was polled as artisan and failed.
---
If we vote no to summoning we vote no to worse summoning. Area buffs are a no from me dog. Rings to help skilling are 
---
I don’t really care about Ancestrals but I agree it’d need a destinct and strong identity. IMO it should be the dragonhai with a stronger bonus like 25%, and dragonhai should be a like 10% mage bonus vs all
---
Except that one time she wasn't...
---
We don't talk about that time
---
If warding passes and battle wards are added to the game, upon conjuring monsters in the wilderness, could they automatically aggro the player you are attacking?
---
The grind he has set for himself is going to drive him insane, I don’t think it’s good for him
---
You can get xp for slayer how is it a minigame

I'm doing desert treasure as I type this, wish me luck.

A lot of nmz since I'm lazy and poor

Good stories make you smile. Great stories make you cry. Masterpieces make you do both.
---
The game isn't instant gratification.
---
Not Gunna lie, had to read it twice
---
Something like how WoW has a specific battleground every week that gives more honor I think would work, not sure what the reward should be though.
---
Tldr
---
And this is why we need to up the requirements to vote.  
---
Imagine if RC got polled today with the same exp rates and "rewards" no chance it would ever get through.  
---
Just because you don't want to engage in a new skill doesn't mean you should automatically say no
---
is there a section that shows teleports?
---
Yeah it would be lame if it told you what to do for each kind of item too. Like if a plant was a lookalike poison or not
---
Very true. I have a love hate relationship with my ultimate Ironman, being an Ironman is so rewarding since you have to do everything on your own and it feels so good, But at the same time I really want to accomplish something as an iron man it’s tough and I know I’ll regret it if I deiron
---
I would only support these new armors if they come in the form of an attachment to Ancestral or other robes.
---
Like, give it to Mystics and make mystics better for lower level people who want to kill Zulrah.
---
Give it to Ancestral for higher level people who want to kill Zulrah/Olm/etc.
---
It has its uses, but it needs to be an attachment to existing equipment, rather than a standalone piece of gear.
---
Dont vote yes for the sake of voing. Read the post, the current design of some of the armour is terrible and so far there isnt a good reason as to why its a new skill instead of an expansion to crafting/runecrafting
---
Unnecessary overall considering the good parts of warding could be implemented into existing skills. Overly complex, battlewards and conjuring does not feel old school at all imo.
---
Seems like content designed for the sake of soaking up developers time.
---
Everything mod ghost designs is like that
---
It's so annoying and gross
---
Go back to playing destiny you casual ;)
---
For me it's more about future proofing, crafting atm is very bloated. Adding warding would add more room for content in the future
---
I enjoy raids but as an Ironman it’s rough doing it with scuffed gear. The lance is just so key at this point
---
Who needs warding I don’t understand
---
send me a 5 secounds video when u make a dance and ur still standing there
---
The more i read about Warding the less I like it. You can literally just make this into a spellbook for magic and just require magic+crafting level requirements.
---
Herb patch, closer to draynor :)
---
In that case OSRS will never have a new skill. Which I believe will actively harm the game long term.
---
Sounds dope if balanced properly
---
I don't understand how people can enjoy constantly looking at the price of their items in a game played for enjoyment. I mean, I think they really don't enjoy it, cus every CC I join is full of people complaining about price fluctuations. I have a tip for you to improve your enjoyment of the game. When buying a best in slot item, keep it in your bank and don't look at the price. Now save for the next best in slot item. Money comes and goes so easily in this game you're only getting yourself worked up and annoyed by paying attention to prices.
---
I like the direction warding is taking but players who spent the time imbuing the rings before this update shouldn't be forced to spend additional game time to gain back something that was changed in a new update. However, I don't consider this a "vote" breaker, though. Just something that'd make me groan.
---
Was hiding poll results deliberately timed to coincide with the Warding poll?
---
Love ba fude I maxed all roles a few weeks ago. Message me.
---
Suggestion: re-implement the periodic screen moving. Looks like it was more effective than people thought.
---
I’m good... thanks.
---
Like sailing? And artisan?
---
Yes! And the vis and all, definitely reminded me of the same :D
---
Show me a single time any suggestion to move torso somewhere else or to make getting it not such a cancer expierence that good decent support. It doesnt happen. I have brought it up dozens of times already on Q&amp;A stream topics and asked jmods on twitter literally no response or even support from the rest.
---
Noone cares its either just "Fuck you, you have to suffer the same" or BA boosters mass downvoting you because they dont want to lose their 8m/h money maker.
---
This
---
Thats gonna be a no from me dawg
---
I agree with most of what you said. Utilise altars over dumping new monoliths. Roll much of this into Runecrafting to revitalise it,it also makes logical sense. Use rune essence rather than new materials. Best thing about this skill is more magic armour variety and viability which again could be rolled into existing skills and would still spice the meta up somewhat. I'm no expert (not an ironman BTW) but I just don't see the need for warding.
---
Sure, but those two quests in particular are very short and contain no combat or puzzles.
---
Oh my fucking god. Now people are saying theres too much? I thought thats what you guys wanted.
---
Personally I wanted the skill cape colors and icon to be redone. Just feels like Mod Ghost's presence is in it. Plus the icon looks like a house portal with an infinity symbol carved into it.
---
Its just too much all in one. It needs to be split up. A lot of stuff they are talking about can and should still happen. But it can all be added without a new skill...
---
Give me the rationale for why OSRS needs this new skill. It should be rationale for NEEDING it, not just wanting it. I have a very strong feeling that a new skill won't be added into the game unless there is an apparent need it can fill. Yes mage is the weakest of the combat triangle, yes mage armor should be expanded upon, yes the spellbooks should be balanced but warding solves none of this. Magic will still be the weakest of the three, mage armor will be the same albeit with additional small niche uses, and the spellbooks will still be unbalanced. I think they should focus in one of the areas of the game that's gotten absolutely no attention in at least the past year, PvP. And this is coming from a PvMer, bc I want to get into pking but there's no point as of now
---
It gives +10 slash and range defense as well as prayer bonus. I would say its justified.
---
&gt;First person to stand on this tile and sends me a pic of it gets 100m
---
Sir the rules where clear. Please give me my money.
---
Yea, me and someone were talking about how the enchantments can be used on any tier of magic item and the stats will slide with if, such as mystics ancestral or Ahrims.
---
If we're just voting it as it is presented in the poll, no. If we're voting in parts, I like the skill structure &amp; the imbue mechanics, but not conjuring or battlewards.
---
Max is 10, don't like it? don't watch giveaway streamsm
---
Your changing the terms, he gave what you asked for :(
---
Please make the cape look similar to the other skillcapes. Consistent art design is important to osrs feel
---
Yup happened in March
---
Right after the reveal of warding I slammed it for being a mishmash of oft requested changes packaged into a skill. It's like how direct TV forces you to sign up for like 50 channels you don't want to get the couple you want. Nmz has been unchanged for 5 years but only when they want to sell us on a new skill does something come out. And boy are they selling it as hard as they can, there's no shame about how biased they're being.
---
you'd only have to add this onto your ahk loop
---
``mousemove (compass coordinates)
---
sendinput {click}

---
Until magic accuracy has a use in OSRS, I will not be voting yes to a skill based on making magic armor.
---
Smithing isn't about making melee armor and it never really was. All of the smithable melee armor is too easily accessed from NPC shops to say that the game would be worse if you couldn't smith them. Smithing is about making cannonballs and darts. The 3 main ways people train smithing now are dart tips for blowpipe, platebodies to alch (and for fastest exp) and gold ore with goldsmith gauntlets.
---
Crafting isn't about making ranged armor to use it. It's about making d'hide into alchables and making combat jewelry. That is not because the items can be bought similar to smithing, rather clue scrolls and combat give them to you by the time you need them. Crafting is trained by cutting gems, blowing glass, or making gold jewelry.
---
Warding will not be about making magical armor to use. It will be about making alchables from cloth. That's literally crafting. As long as the skill is sold to me as "you should be able to make mage armor!" Then the skill will be nothing more than crafting, but magic.
---
Adding in combat summoning and buffs only makes the skill worse in my opinion, as once it's released, every combat encounter developed moving forward will be developed with combat summoning and buffs in mind, meaning I *have* to use it or i'll have a harder time completing the content. Or if I don't have to use it, then using it will make the content way easier. Neither of these two options are great.
---
Imagine fighting sire, but his minions attack your hellhound instead of you. That sounds awful to me.
---
Agree.  warding sucks
---
Can you elaborate on what factors you'd consider are needed for a skill?
---
gratz :] i can't come but good job my friend enjoy
---
Shame they spent the dev time on this, its obviously never going to pass. Would rather they spent time on fog or stealing creation.
---
He also respawns in edgeville. He doesn't allow himself to gather resources outside of the wildy so it makes sense.
---
They've mentioned it a bunch of times in Q&amp;As
---
Yeah they are like 3 mil less then when I pulled a pair last week and like 6 mil less then when I pulled my first pair
---
&gt;The fact that you could replace every concept within Warding to become a subset of the Runecrafting skill and completely revitalise the currently most despised skill in game - without necessarily making it easier or faster - (if all the proposed Warding stuff was focusing on GP &amp; item reward output rather than XP gain) just adds to making it feel like such a shame that we’re going to be leaving that old skill by the wayside, and all future magical-tangent related features will inevitably be lumped into the shiny new Warding skill instead.
---
Cant agree with you more on this point. And you have swayed my opinion a warding quite a bit. I'm still in favor of it, but haven't until now thought about it being an update to runecrafting. Runecrafting can still be a gathering skill where you make your xp from crafting runes, but then those runes could be used to create some kickass items.
---
This is what I've wanted and never knew it. As you commented on enchantments as well, I would want that moved over to warding...but then it takes away content from Magic, and then that might need some new content to add. Moving things around this much feels a little blah.
---
What does this mean for the max cape? Would you have to max warding first? What would happen to people who already have max capes?
---
&gt; There is no objective reason to not make the hammers better than the current state.
---
Yes, there's no objective reason one way or the other, it is *subjective* because it exists within context, and that context suggests there are also reasons for not buffing Torag's Hammers.
---
People care because the money is important to them. Saying "lol just don't think about" doesn't help
---
spooky. im into it.
---
A lot of people are using mouse movement recording programs, that's what i'm assuming this guy is using. I could be wrong though.
---
I got Holy Sandals and Wizard Boots within 11 clues the other day. 
---
Brought my new total to 2 Holy Sandals, 2 Wizard Boots, 0 Ranger boots.
---
I've only done like 170 Medium Clues though so eh.
---
The game is called old school runescape not 2007scape, it doesn't have to be trapped in 2007. The name doesn't need changing it is old school runescape because of the style and tone of the game not content
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
Conjuring from the warding blog feels like it would fit really well in the Arceuus spellbook. What are your thoughts on pulling it from warding, and using it to help flesh out the Arceuus spellbook.
---
That sounds like it'd actually work really well for OSRS
---
Arceuss spellbook easily could've been a "reanimation" skill but the way they did it made it feel solid
---
you'd just record yourself clicking the compass after every 3 rock cycle
---
Yes thank you. Reminds me of Mod Ghosts favorite color scheme
---
:( That is a good point though. Even if we understand something we're still dumb enough to give JigglePecks 11$ every month while complaining about the game. Haha. Memes.
---
Dwh, Tbow, Sang staff, DHL, DHCB, Ancestral top, ACB are some
---
I don't. Slayer is shit.
---
If the new armors have to come in, then lets make them mega mega costly to use.
---
The new armors should degrade and be absolute cancer to build and repair.
---
In RS3, the new masterwork power armor takes 8 hours to build. 8 HOURS of boring cancerous waiting. And it degrades swiftly when not on a slayer task. Let's borrow that idea but just make it even worse. Fold the glorious nippon silk 1000 times for each silk bolt. Make the cost obscene for day to day use, forcing it into a niche use based on if it is worth going through the effort to get it repaired.
---
Venomous will only be used at zulrah, because anywhere else is not worth the money. Dragonkin will only be used at Olm because the cost is ridiculous. Dagon'hai robes are already worthless, but give them the same treatment anyway.
---
Ancestral doesn't degrade, is powerful, and has its varied uses. Won't be top of the food chain, but it will have it's place.
---
Of course I'm a moron so this idea is probably retarded and goes against OSRS thought.
---
That’s man, I’ve had a bad day and this really made me laugh, everyone on the train looked at me funny but just seeing that stupid bird sitting there had me laugh so hard aha
---
Imagine being this intentionally dense and calling someone else intentionally dense
---
Very Nice!  well I doubt I'll make the party as I'm currently at work, but CONGRATZ!
---
Rs3 in a nutshell
---
Eh, not really. Whips aren't used anymore due to a multitude of much better options via the Mining and Smithing rework, but prior to that they sank to alch value due to the sheer amount of people that camp abyssal demons for the xp. Bandos on the other hand can be camped pretty much indefinitely these days since we have gear, prayers, abilities, and potions that far surpass what you could find in 2007. Bandos gear is considered low tier in RS3, but it still holds it's current price due to Invention. It isn't viable to use it at many bosses though, most you'd be able to manage are a few of the GWD2 bosses. For a simple comparison though, OSRS bandos is basically equivalent to RS3 masterwork. Both are staples in melee combat in their respective games.
---
Vennessa Phoenix and Alexis Adams got mad game.
---
You sure thats how the screen moving worked? I don't think it worked that way.
---
If you get caught on your way to the altar (people like camping the tp spot) just start burying all your bones.
---
Op sees like he just wants to argue with people lol.
---
So youre saying you made way above the median expected value
---
Rigth now there is no indication that it will come from something like that. For all we now it could be crafted only using a new item.  
---
They must be clear with what they are doing and how they are doing it
---
yeah i agree
---
being fun isn’t enough to make people do something anymore
---
Legend
---
Completely agree with you. This skill seems forced to fill the void of faults in other parts of the game that can be solved in other ways. Also, as a converted RS3 player, this is way too much like EOC divination and invention. These skills integrate item sink mechanics which ultimately change the entire meta and feel of the game. 
---
I left rs3 because of how much I didn’t feel like RS anymore. I really hope OSRS finds a path forward that doesn’t mimic the path EOC has taken.
---
Less offensive way of saying kill yourself.
---
It def changes something but not that they can outright rig it. My guess is they noticed most of the playerbase doesn’t want it and the bandwagon effect from the majority being no could make other people change their mind on it. Regardless, it feels like one of those things they’ll poll a half dozen times until their proposed changes sound good enough to pass
---
Like u said free discussion il say it how I see it guy. 
---
Ppl need to realize that warding can fix dead priced items by removing them from the game. 
---
And saying no to warding is saying no to crafting and smithing theoretically since they are all the same in a way. Making armor or weapons of the combat triangle
---
i think it just moved a few pixels every once in a while
---
If you mean the spec that gives you 3 mining levels then yes, it works at the guilds I mentioned even when used at 99. As do all stat boosts like the mining cape used in the clip
---
Can I legitimately ask how he's not using his feelings?
---
STOLEN VALOR
---
I would be for sailing if it has a viable item sink mechanic, doesn't play like a minigame, and does not lock endgame content behind it.
---
Personally I'm for literally any new skill in osrs if it fits these criteria. Essentially make it optional to train, and sink items. I wouldn't be against a survey or a redesign of the skill I just have a hard time seeing how sailing would work?
---
Tons of work and thought already put into this. Instead of outright denying Warding, give suggestions on how you can fix it. Everyone wanted a new skill and here it is. If this doesn’t pass who knows what will.
---
Interesting, I always thought it was named that because it took place in 2007. I see where your coming from tho, and it makes sense
---
Similar to the green pixel on construction icon, its right where its supposed to be.
---
You have to restart the client when an update comed out.
---
By long break you mean a week right?
---
It is actually related. You're insinuating in that comment that a poll with warding incorporated into a mainly slayer update would pass, but without disguising it under slayer updates it won't. Imo, thats propagating the whole "PvMer vs PKer vs Skiller" attitude of its us against them.
---
Feels bad to anyone close to maxing
---
What can’t they just make sailing a skill, with a pirate style wilderness
---
/u/JagexAcorn Here's my suggestion for the imbues. Leave the imbues in NMZ but give them charges (similar to barrows). You have to spend points to recharge. You lose all charges on death. Put the permanent imbue on warding. This makes it fair for people who dont want to do warding but incentives people to level it up. The existing imbues would be in their fully charged state. This does cause an issue with existing accounts with imbued rings because there would be a mad dash for warding levels to get their permanent imbues back. 
---
This way still gives people access to the imbues who are against the imbue changes, but heavily incentives players to invest in it.
---
your analysis isn't wrong exactly, just misguided. at this point it will pay for itself and a bp with addy arrows will do you better than a msb with amethyst. cbow is good for hi def monsters, msb for low def, bp just shreds everything.
---
I respectfully argue that i know a few maxed players that say they dont want to be forced to grind a new skill to use their maxed cape, i my self am not maxed tho,
---
If the service sucks than your tip should reflect that. It’s not a given. Tips actually stands for To Insure Prompt Service. If service is utter shit you ask for a manager. You’re probably not the only guest who has received subpar service and that person, unless they’re weeded as fuck or just having a bad night, is not cut out for the industry. 
---
So restaurants don’t pay servers hourly, thus the menu prices are lower because the restaurant has a low labor cost. So say we are paid hourly. Now the restaurant has to increase  menu prices to account for that increased labor cost. So now you’re paying more for food (somewhere around or above 20%) and the server has no incentive to provide good service, because they know they’re making an hourly wage.
---
Really needs a video explaining how this works. You can already see the confusion in the comments.
---
The mechanic is not broken from a gameplay perspective but the the information in the message displayed is misleading and confusing to the user. Using the level of compost to signal the healthiness of the plant doesn't make sense, especially given that the game doesn't explain this anywhere. I suspect that the reason why it was done this way is because they don't have a way to distinguish between a plant with X lives left and a plant that's been treated with super/ultra compost because that information is stored in the same variable. That's the "spaghetti" that they're talking about.
---
Ironmemes literally aren't allowed to give their opinions on runescape. But thanks anyway
---
They wouldn't have announced a new skill at RuneFest if there wasn't interest in a new skill. Warding specifically may not have been requested, but players do ask for new skills fairly often and there was interest in adding a new skill in the next few years.
---
As for why they are still offering it... Because they announced it and the initial pitch wasn't the full thing. Players may not have been overly excited for it like they were with Kebos, but that doesn't mean they should scrap it entirely. They kept the initial reveal vague so players could help design and rework the skill and now they are getting into that process. If it isn't in a good state in May, they will likely give more time to revise it but 6 weeks should be enough time to revise the concept based on feedback.
---
It isn't any more of a priority than any of the other reveals; they all fit into their schedule (Jan, June, Sept) and they need to poll it before they can develop it. So if this is polled mid May, it would pass around the time Prif is wrapping up, making it easy for their project team to move onto the next thing. But they are probably aware there is a chance it may not pass, so they may be polling it a bit early instead of after Prif so they have time to offer and poll other things in case it fails instead of running out of things to do.
---
I feel like that’s a massive problem with our team of Jmods.
---
They always want to create and develop their own new and shiny content instead of improve what’s already there or add what we know already works. Look at what they say about stealing creation for example.
---
Also in the Runescape documentary I think it was Mod Mark who said his biggest regret with RS3 was how they constantly made new content without fixing / updating old and dead things.
---
Oh fucking Hell, the people saying they don't want Warding make few points worth talking about...
---
I thought you guys wanted more in the skill than what was last shown. Now you're saying it's too bloated. While I agree that a video would help clear some stuff up, this *is* what the outcry was last time - "skill doesn't have enough content, make more!"
---
Your redesign looks horrible dude. What are you going to wear that with? The fashionscape is key for designing a new cape
---
At that point you're change the entire direction of the game just to release a new skill...
---
https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1083424760535662599
---
Because it brings more players, brings back more players, gives Jagex more money, good for hiscore chases, good for bored high levels, good for low levels, good for mains, good for farming, good for hunter.
---
Only the last two reasons are about warding. The first seven reasons would be for any skill, so now we refine it
---
I doubt it. Facebook absolutely dwarfs jagex. On top of that, facebook doesn’t play well with others.

---
&gt; @serieuzementage Those boosts over 99 help if you're in a guild where there's an invisible boost in effect (e.g. redwood trees in the Woodcutting Guild) but not in other places like the blast mine.
---
&gt; I addressed this in the last paragraph. To reword. One of the biggests problems in pvp is that people are too tanky. So how does introducing cheap tank armor help? It doesnt. Thats the big issue.
---
i mean the biggest problem is being able to stack so much damage in a single tick.
---
being able to tank against a thing like that isn't really a problem imo.
---
Dungeoneering would be great, but as a minigame. Warding looks like dogshit, just a waste of dev time.
---
We don't need new magic robes. There are already too many in the game that are unnecessary. I don't want any of the other stuff either and I'd rather scrap this entire idea at this point.
---
Works like fire making. In b4 " ward plz"
---
You are a human (I'm assuming). That means you are also affected by bias.
---
All i know is this looks like fuckin fun, this is why I pay 11 and also looks like pvp is gonna be multi dimensional which also sounds cool. I’m game. Just don’t EOC.
---
I don’t care if a poll sits at 99%/1% I still vote.
---
Damn I thought everyone held their pick and a hammer in their inv
---
Fairly certain it caps at 100 but gz
---
I don't totally understand the point of the Cocktails. Demons are mostly too big to be chinned or barraged effectively, and even if they weren't they're most;y super weak to magic anyway. As far as I can tell, these would only be useful for abby demon tasks and _maybe_ for some 1337 Kril tactics.
---
I don’t see the problem with warding and a new skill. This isn’t the last skill to be released, this adds so much new content and future content. I really don’t see why there’s such a massive community backlash towards it. I don’t see any cons, just pro’s that will help the overall health of the game in the short term and longterm. We can see a new expansion towards magical weapons and armor, the skill contains all of the oldschool vibe towards it as well. We’re not straying from the overall integrity of OSRS. We’re simply strengthening it, improving it, and contributing to the future of the game. All those skills you mentioned are way to cluttered. Why not reorganize everything into a new skill?
---
The point of saying "Veteran" player is that many people argue players who vote in or have strong opinions on polls don't actually know what they're talking about.
---
For example, allowing people who have never attempted The Inferno to vote on decision that impact The Inferno.
---
It was mainly meant as a qualifying statement to show people that I am coming from a place of understanding an experience, more than a brag.
---
&gt;They make it sound like there are low level players who don't have a lot of options for magic armor, but the reality is that no one cares about low level armors. If Warding were to pass and assuming it had the same XP rates as the other skills, most people would easily be able to get to level 50-70 shortly after release. A lot of that low level gear is useless right off the bat and a waste of time. The GE is already overflooded with these armors, and a ton of people crafting them isn't going to change how inexpensive they are.
---
I agree to an extent, but I think it just would have to take a change in how that armor is obtained. Sure all the high level players, or players with cash are going to spam buy in GE and get high lvl warding quickly. Much like they do with smithing and crafting. I think thats just inevitable when trying to add this at such a point in the game.
---
I think they just need to make getting a blue wizard robe or hat drop from the same types of monsters that drop green dragonhide body. And instead we need to have fabric drop from low level monsters, just like cowhides or green dragonhides. 
---
I like to think of it as starting a fresh ironman account, the skill should be in line with crafting and smithing when you have no bank.
---
I already got fucked once by jamflex making me re-unlock stuff in EOC.
---
No thanks to round 2.
---
Tl;dr - If you don't like warding, vote no, fair enough. Don't vote no because you're a spiteful bitch who can't get over something a completely different group of people did 10 years ago. OP is sour and it clearly shows. He hates warding based on that it is a new skill, he doesn't hate it because he specifically thinks it's bad content.
---
1. The developer time
---
A huge amount of developer time already gets allocated towards improvements and additions to existing content.
---
2. Mage needs an update
---
It fits a production skill niche for magic products like smithing and crafting. Do I agree with everything in the dev blog? No but this is the best idea for a new skill we have gotten since 2007. It is the most fitting skill thematically for this game.
---
3. It's not interesting
---
It is as interesting as anything else in the game. Is runecrafting interesting? Is firemaking interesting? What about herblore? If you don't want to train the skill then don't, no one forces you to do anything.
---
4. New players and returning players don't care
---
The very vast majority of players do not play for nostalgia, if they did then osrs would've been more popular between 2013-2016. The fact osrs has only gotten more popular as time goes on shows that new content and regular updates brings in more players. The quote of your friend is completely irrelevant
---
5. Maxed people want a new skill
---
If you don't want to train the skill then don't, no one is forcing you.
---
My issue with adding on to magic is that the skill already has 4 spellbooks, and s literal fuck-load of spells. Why add an entire skill's worth of content to a skill that already has one of the most content behind it. 
---
Issues with adding on to runecrafting is just simply changing an iconic skill. Runecrafting is so iconic to the game, far more than any other skill imo. The name is embedded into the name of the game. 
---
I'm not a fan of changing the core gameplay of a skill like that.
---
Ah fairs and thanks!
---
TBH, I am confused about that. I'm all for a buffed Skull Sceptre and stronger Crumble Undeads... But why is a low-level F2P Staff getting a level 89 upgrade. Like I can get the level 39 Chaotic Skull Sceptre, but it feels like it would make more sense to add different staves as its higher level counterparts.
---
Considering I never checked results until I got done voting and also I'm not some weak minded child who has to go with the grain.
---
Nah, you're wrong. Poll results should have never been hidden. Cry more that your shitty polls didn't pass because "muh bias"
---
Imagine getting bandos plate first
---
If they have on incentive to provide good service then they shouldn't be working there rofl. I'm not gonna pay people extra just so they do their job. That isn't how the world works. They're already getting paid whatever was agreed upon. If that isn't enough for them to do their job well then that's on them, not on me to incentivize them to do their job. I get paid minimum wage at my job, I still do my best to do everything I can, since that's the price I was agreed upon for working there. If I don't like it, I can complain to my manager, or I can quit. That's how a job works. Not some halfass shit where you try to con people into paying you more so you actually do your job.
---
That berserker ring is not imbued
---
Can we introduce an obsidian plate skirt ?
---
i remember when they were like 15m
---
its only bill, the guy who eats to 90 hp for dds.
---
Because merchants are switching over their investments to the new clue scroll items, which have a lower supply and higher demand. All the items you mentioned have slowly been saturated on the market, so people flipping them are only getting small gains.
---
Are there still any plans for doing something with the Hydra Tail? It may as well not even exist in the game with the current function it serves.
---
If not a bone whip, perhaps it could be potentially useful for Warding?
---
Technically he is down 15m in opportunity cost. Dumping it was probably the stupid thing for OP to do, as the items are likely to rise again
---
I can agree with that. Collectively we have more experience than individually, so working together to facilitate conversations to improve this game is the way to go.
---
Off topic but is the automod broken? It never posted a new daily question thread. It doesn't functionally really matter cuz the old one is still stickied, just curious
---
What's wrong with that? Game would be long dead without any changes.
---
I like that “please contact customer support” well off to reddit I go
---
35 Smithing and the Dwarf Cannon quest.
---
How did your simple mind come to this conclusion? Obviously none of it would be free since every armor would require items to be dissolved first and therefore the higher tier and better armors would cost even more to make since you'd need better items to dissolve. You should've read the blog before typing.
---
I'm teetering on yes and no. I like some of the new weapon and armor but I don't think anything should be BiS unless it's a drop from a monster requiring the skill to finish making it. Similar to Zenytes and cerb crystals.
---
15 year vet also.
---
Yeah it's literally crafting, they should have added the items and out a magic level requirment to make it if "enchant" it or w.e.
---
Like 80 magic and crafting.
---
Its just combing 2 skills and calling it something new.
---
Rs shit 100%
---
Can someone who thinks warding is a good idea to add to the game tell me their opinion? Literally no flame at all I’m just finding no reason that this would be something useful to add to the game, it seems more like a why not then to actual be useful
---
I don't know why but that made me crack up.
---
Nice I just got 99 yesterday. Gratz!
---
It doesn’t... mod ash confirmed on Twitter it goes up to max stack, and lots of people have stacked up over 100
---
Damage does work more thematically than accuracy, so perhaps something like a Set Effect of +10% Damage and Accuracy would be better. That way each individual Ancestral item would remain BiS and better for hybriding, but Bane Robes could also compete as a degradable option when fighting specific enemies. 
---
Since the other two are being proposed with one, it kinda made sense to give splitbark the baseline effect of the other two. I like both penetration and damage reduction, but I felt that given soulbark is supposed to be an upgrade of bloodbark, giving them different mechanics complicates an otherwise simplistic concept.
---
I'm mostly just giving my thoughts on your idea and the reasons for how I came to mine, but it's nice to see discussion being thrown around for these items, because I really think their balancing needs some serious reconsideration before being voted on.
---
It’s funny because warding is a symptom of the same disease that prevents them from adding awesome content like fog or SC. They constantly want to create their own new content and force it in rather then fix old things like mini-games and broken skills.
---
1. Don't move imbues to a skill I have no interest in. 
---
2. If you do fuck up this bad will the salve amulet have to be imbued this way too?
---
I'm with you, OP. I disagree with everything Warding is for. They only added some mage bullshit that could've easily made the magic tab, but They want to tie it in a skill.
---
If I got *ALL* of my NMZ Points back, I'd probably be maxed NMZ points by now. The only reason why I AFKed NMZ was so I dont have to grind my points back when/if I lose my rings :(
---
What do you mean people are too tanky lmao. So fucking daft. You can easily stack 50+, and it's not that rare.
---
Yay so glad to hear there’s no limit
---
Jagex has said a couple times that their MO is "develop first, poll later". They wanna start working on shit before it passes a poll and if it doesn't pass they just hold the L.
---
Yeah let's lock the BIS gear behind 214 hours of cancerous painful repetitive grind. Tis the runescape way DAE?
---
Aka mini summoning / eoc
---
But taste vengeance is only said if someone hits you? Don't think afk woodcutters will do that
---
I love the design so far. I don't have any major concerns. 
---
However, I'm not sure if either form of Battle Ward is really ideal for the game - they seem extremely strong, and neither crafting nor Smithing (if we're keeping in line with the whole "Warding fills a gap" reasoning) offer anything similar. 
---
I don't know exactly what these conjured creatures would do, but if they're battle companions, holy jesus. Can they hold monster aggro? Could you use them in place of other players for tanking in boss encounters? What are the limits of the Area Buff system - can you also use it in boss areas? Will the Mind Ward pull creatures that other players are fighting (gives griefers/crashers all new ways to f*ck with people)?
---
Don't get me wrong - the effects are *extremely* cool and very creative, but I really need to see it in action and get more details regarding how conjuring is going to work before I could personally sign off on something like this.
---
Everything else seems fine, great even.
---
As long as it removes the skillcape stats and perks I think it’s a great idea
---
Everything Mod Ghost designs is garbage and has consistently degraded the quality of the game over time. Why is this cape designed differently from the other skill capes? Just scrap warding and fire Ghost already.
---
i dont think they're wrestling.....
---
I used the locator orb to suicide after just doing 1 full inv at a time
---
I agree, this is mostly just a joke about how jagex could pass literally anything they wanted if they just held slayer updates hostage to do it.
---
Tru
---
what does runelite have to do with this
---
Damn looks awesome I really hope it passes
---
I don't know why it didn't post the Daily Question thread yesterday. If Automod was completely broken, I'm sure it would be really apparent... But I did mention about the missing thread to the other mods so hopefully that gets fixed or otherwise sorts itself out; if it doesn't post a new one tonight I'll look into it further to see what is going on.
---
Do you have to complete Making Friends with My Arm to get there?
---
nothing more engaging and rewarding than doing the same lava run for hundreds of hours
---
\&gt;wahhh, i hate grinding
---
Because that’s all the mods care about.
---
They just want a brand new thing they can feel good about and pop up on twitch for massive advertisement.
---
Quit assuming that just because you and ten people on reddit don't want it, that literally no one wants it.
---
Warding is gonna pass get the fuck over it
---
Just start a new account get it again. 4head
---
I too would love having dungeoneering as a minigame. I liked that it incorporated every skill in the game in a small way, and how it gave people things that they could do together.
---
If you don't enjoy skilling then why would a new skill that encourages you to skill change that? You do not enjoy skilling
---
I think the skull sceptre should cast crumble undead as that makes it a viable item in F2P
---
I also wish having it imbued bent kept on dead
---
As dying with it anytime you lose it and have to make the entire thing again, keep in mind you must have authenticator to imbue the sceptre this is probably what they think will motivate other players who havent yet to do so.
---
before torso, or?
---
It's not exp/hr that bothers me, it's that some skills feel absolutely pointless to train outside of diaries and quest reqs. Smithing, thieving, to a lesser extent fletching, to name a few. Compared to crafting which unlocks mid level range gear, end-game jewelery, staves, other utilities.
---
thanks for posting this man, hopefully something happens.
---
Another account that they use to rag is "scimmyz"
---
no one cares about bill the ahker.
---
He's probably higher than that. In my community clan there is a player in the top 10 of the Medium clues high scores, and he did like 1200 this weekend. The does nothing but medium clues @ a rate of about 25/hr
---
Basically a skilling "Slayer"?
---
Mage only kills are super slow but it should be fine for a single kill. Just pray range when it’s green, hide behind pillars when it’s blue, and stand away from where it’s facing when orange. If you do this while not standing in poison you can’t die, should be easy. Wear recoils for the minions and just wear your best mage gear otherwise
---
Do not fuck with my imbued rings. Holy shit how dumb are you guys?
---
I'm so sorry your extremely judgemental..
---
He’s a HC btw
---
I don't care if they add warding since it seems like a skill I'll never touch, but I can't stand the thought of having to do it to imbue my rings.
---
The fact that you found this fun is actually hilariously disgusting
---
2,147,483,647gp
---
"Scimmyz" is also a ragger thats been making it hard for him to stream.
---
You can edit within 5 minutes and not have it be labeled as an edit, another thing you seem ignorant about.
---
It's like I'm talking to a savvy 10 year old lol. Get over yourself bud.
---
i just dont see why you would care if some moron bought gold in a video game
---
Oh that's right, you can't even complete the easiest Zelda game to date. My bad
---
I don't really understand the hate for metal dragons. They're usually pretty small tasks and trident shreds them. I guess it's not super cheap but whatever.
---
No new skill... Isn't this how 07 rs failed into rs3?
---
An additional incentive can make a world of a difference
---
Hey mate sorry about your son. I want to say this without sounding cuntish but can I have his stuff in his runescape bank? I got hacked 😭
---
Pay this man m8
---
Thanks, I almost forgot
---
YOU dont want it. Tons of peoppe want it.
---
Am I the only one that doesn’t really care for a new skill?
---
You'll be fine. Its obvious when people are involved in RWT.
---
"hide poll results so other people's opinions have less impact on the individual vote"
---
We don't know for sure.
---
That being said, if you're frequently trading gold/items to the same accounts and actively playing them, it's pretty much not an issue.
---
Because I have 3 Billion and I'm not a retard. Ancestral costs 140M+, these alternatives cost will be a joke for certain, yet being far superior, even if the main ingridient comes as a rare drop it will definetly be cheaper than ancestral, because they will introduce it behind a grindable mob, very different from raids items, which require a huge inversion beforehand on building an account/gearing and getting the skills/know hows.
---
An extra drop to zulrah won't add profits to the overall drop table because it will be farmed more, and price will drop, and scales maybe too.
---
Same for wyverns.
---
You make that money back within like 10 hours at revs. Mostly irons use it to get the wildy weapons.
---
Never concern yourself with downvotes on reddit. You can't get any information from that. 99%+ of reddit users are willing to downvote well structured and written opinions just because they disagree.
---
Take feedback from people willing to explain their position to you.
---
L 0 L you’re a bunch of losers
---
Well the whole skill wouldn’t be in wilderness obviously, just thought pk pirate ship battle would be cool
---
If the polls fails that will be the end of it.
---
Is this official? If so do you happen to have a source
---
Yeah bro. Stuff like lunar armor lol. Not endgame content. As for your yews I wouldn’t worry too much. 300 was the norm for years.
---
VOTE NO
---
I mean, there are definitely parts of the game WORTH playing, but if you're telling me I've got to look at a rock for 100+ hours to get to that content, I'm going to tell you to have fun doing it like a pleb.
---
Clicking a rock is not playing a game.
---
Just hit 70/70/60 att/str/def, is it worth swapping my beserker ring for a whip for doing slayer/nmz?
---
Oh sweet. Funny either way! Happy Easter to you too!
---
My man
---
Not the person you replied to, but was not aware you could do that. Thanks
---
I know this is meant to be a joke but I guarantee some people are actually going to believe they did if it does pass lol. Gonna be a good week after that
---
Can't tell if you're trolling. This was basically Artisan which failed a poll.
---
Thanks for reminding me to vote yes
---
that sounds 10 times worse than rcing.
---
i actually feel bad for iron men who are going to have to do it.
---
You're not wrong. I made this post out of concern that Jagex would rush this through without thinking of the repercussions. Glad to see I'm not the only one.
---
this isnt nsfw
---
We pay $11 for this? Really? I figured they'd have better developer tools but this really sheds a light on the quality of content that they are capable of introducing with their antiquated computer game.
---
This skill actually seems like it could fit in Old School. The only thing is I'm not sure how I feel about Farming and Hunter being related to this skill.
---
Yah, I doubt anyone but some pet hunters would use those robes at Scopria. Bane style items should generally be saved for creatures with a good variety of uses; venom robes seem too specific to just Zulrah. That said, the concept of a Venom Robe does sound intriguing outside of Bane items; some poison based magic armor could be neat.
---
I was so hyped when summoning dropped
---
This is how you get feedback, discussion.
---
Is this a hard concept?
---
I’m gay
---
Couldn’t agree more. Skills don’t need to exist to be op, but a sense of accomplishment. Most skills that aren’t buyables can make decent money some way or another. If skills only exist as requirements to new content I think that is perfectly fine. It’s one of the most grindy mmos out there, and it feels so good reaching your goals In it.
---

---
This confirms jagex had motive to hide the poll results. Do the right thing and vote NO
---
And?
---
Not to mention that the skill gives players the monopoly over making BiS equipment.
---
Tell me how that's not stupid.
---
I personally don’t like the combat wards, or the summoning.
---
Other than that, I think this would be a good addition to the game.
---
thanks for the reply!
---
oh thanks, i guess i dont have to worry then
---
No time reddit you need make video
---
But before today good chance you would have voted yes?  Because they've changed my vote from a yes yesterday to a no today.
---
Slayer = OSRS. Why else does anyone play? Everything I do in game is either slayer, or geared towards increasing the quality of my slayer experience.
---
Nice cat!
---
Trying to sneak summoning in by stealth NO THANKS
---
kk, thanks mate
---
Because the game is fairly stable and needs something new.
---
I actually understand how averages work, quite well. The fact that there's already 20 skills doesn't affect the impact that a new skill has since total level is a cumulative total of all of your skills, and not an average. 
---
&gt; it would seem you’re beyond your depth.
---
You literally write like a teenager on the autism spectrum that just read his first adult book. Christ, in 3 years I'll have "doctor" in front of my name and you try a lot harder to sound smart than anyone I know.
---
So no matter what we will lose our imbued rings from NMZ? What’s the “item” we will get if the first option is chosen where the rings are auto unimbued and we get an item?
---
I use a password manager and it works fine with the mobile app whenever I log out. That would help too
---
OP, don't panic, but there's a PKer sitting on your monitor.
---
Thanks man gertrude gave it to me
---
Shhh. Don't expose the hypocrisy to the sheep
---
Imma vote yes on my 700 total account
---
I aftually hope that the warding skill will revitalize firemaking outside of wintertodt. Instead of logs just giving us ashes each wood should earn their unique ash which would serve as material for warding
---
I used a paid auto clicker that did both of these lol. It’s not worth doing regardless if you think you won’t get caught.
---
Settled's life. The bane of my existence.
---
Not quite.
---
Cant be bought: 3 melees, hp, rc (sorta), hunter, slayer, thief, agi, mining, fishing, and wc is 12.
---
23-12=11. There's less buyables than there are non-buyables.
---
Message me if you want a link
---
Why bother when your vote is predetermined? Unless you think it's just a coincidence that poll results were hidden right before Warding gets polled
---
Lol I can tell just the type of player you are by how you responded to my question as if it was taken out of context. Them adding a tiny bit of xp to something they think should give said type of xp is not me wanting that "dank free prayer xp bro, game is so easy ill be 99 in no time"
---
I say weird build cuz in a game thats all about powering up and gaining levels, you chose to not level one. No one told you to do that, its how you like to play, so you have to find suitable methods of training to support that playstyle.
---
Just sayin, you dont see swampletics asking them to add a morytania only slayermaster so that he doesn't have to train slayer through temple trekking. There are plenty of specific builds, none of them ask for special treatment
---
I agree, I guess where I don't agree is flavor of the month... But I'm literal... He's been popular more than a month so it's more like flavor of the year? Lol idk
---
Big oof
---
I think you meant to say he has a script auto searching for the phrase. Big Brain and all that.
---
Except at olm, which would kill off the main use for ancestral..
---
That latina chick looks like shes 12 years old what the fuck
---
This isn't the first time a new skill has been proposed for OSRS. We have been down this road before. The point of polling is to gather player opinion on what should or should not be developed. Right now they are in the stage of gathering feedback, so if the poll goes live with community suggestions in mind, and it fails, why would Jagex continue to forcibly push it on us?
---
You said it yourself, the general feeling is already that they are *really* trying to push this on the community. Why would they go against a failed poll?
---
I'd really like if it could be considered dragonkin armour to include attack bonuses as well/instead of damage, metal dragons are awkward to kill and I'd expect the most blocked slayer task. Or some sort of a rework to the same goal. While items exist especially to aid dragon slaying (dhcb + lance), they're often at a price that's out of reach for mid level players - a shame to lock out content for this player bracket. Those who have the cash usually have combat stats that dragonslaying items aren't necessary.
---
He’s trying to get his idea out there. Upvote or keep it moving negative Nancy.
---
Wait what is the new design for the skillcape? The only difference in the model for Warding vs other skillcapes is that you can see a hood, but all skillcape models are like that. The real in-game model does not have a hood attached.
---
played osrs since its release and not maxed yet smh
---
pd: https://i.imgur.com/gasD5Hv.png LMAOOOOOO

Goodbyyyyye bank space
---
id like to vote yes for conjuring making sense in arceuus spellbook. i also agree that since arceuus isnt really a cb spellbook, that the above recommendations to create expensive skilling helpers makes sense in arceuus. but no combat helping belongs in this crafting skill.
---
&gt;LOOK MOM I POSTED IT AGAIN
---
This family crest video is broken as fuck. I don't blame him though. I probably couldn't do better. All I'm saying is snugglequest has the best RS quest guides. They are the most professional and accurate I've come across.
---
Or just run right by it. I mean maybe its because I don't path past those green dragons often, but the dozen or so times I have had to I've never had a dragon attack me as long as I hug the sea wall.
---
60 runecrafting takes 3-4 hours.
---
Idk man, it looks pretty cool
---
Dont de iron, normies are easy to make make. Ironmen are not. Make an alt, set  it up in nmz, in 2 weeks youll have decent stats.
---
We don’t want new and something different in terms of skills. It’s old school for a reason.
---
Voting no to every update won't bring back your childhood.
---
You need to lower the bar. The average rs player can’t comprehend much past point-click-afk.
---
:crab:
---
It's 2019 and jagex doesn't show active poll results yet. wtf?
---
RC is a but of a grey area so I wouldn't even bother counting it. Nmz is quite literally buying your melees and hp so yes it can considering you can afk and just cash out the gold.
---
I flipped about 3-4 times deciding between upvoting or downvoting your comment while reading. Decided to upvote in the end. You have good intentions
---
Voting no to stupid updates will prevent stupid updates
---
I was willing to lose it....I most wasn't planned on being skull tricked
---
Herblore isn't an armor creation skill my guy
---
I myself prefer the original, nice concept nonetheless
---
So basically I need to get all of my imbues done before this drops?
---
It did. Remember the staff of armadyl?
---
The polypore staff?
---
Yeah. It worked out fine.
---
And I said a pouch slot. Not a new pouch.
---
I remember that a completely different team dictated the direction of the game with no player input, yes. 
---
On the flip side, I remember that the current team genuinely listens to player feedback and that every major update is voted on.
---
If revs were 7.5m an hour everyone would do them
---
I can't imagine training this shitty skill with anything other than birdhouses so I don't really care what they do to the fucking skill to be honest
---
I like warding, I think it provides a lot of things that would be great for the game.
---
That being said I don't like combat wards and I think they'd be better off without.
---
And I think that smithing, crafting, and fletching, need level rebalancing and things moved in or out of them to be able to allow warding to properly fit in.
---
oh cmon man, oblivion aint that bad. If you summon a Lich, you don't even have to fight. Free xp
---
or just play as a necromancer in path of exile and watch your army of 20 skeletons defeat every boss under 5 seconds lmao
---
I agree with your post but let express my opinion, and hopefully more people can see and agree with me.
---
It looks like most of the skill is going to be filling holes in older content. Making magic robes can be in crafting. imbuing rings and the like can be in runecrafting. I'm not a huge fan of the wards but the wards can be built into firemaking. Almost everything for this skill can fit into an existing skill, so why are they making a new skill for no reason? They should be adding this to existing content and try again at a new skill.
---
Imagine making a comment making yourself look uninformed on purpose just to complain about the company and game.
---
A picture of some text? Would that qualify as proof in a nutritional study? Maybe you haven't gotten to that point yet. But keep working at it, you'll
---
&gt;I don't believe any skill should allow for someone to make BiS PvM gear. It defeats the purpose of having endgame PvM with endgame gear drops if you can just skill to acquire something better, similarly to how the Nezzy helm was BiS over the Serp helm for many years.
---
Ehhh.. I'm not quite sure about this. They could make Non-Trade-able materials that only drop from endgame PvM that you'd need to craft the armor which would still work.
---
"forces you to train it a certain way"
---
eh?
---
Name a skill that's more diverse
---
and? who is forcing you to train them?
---
# S
---
Which makes sense imo. Getting to 99 in a melee in NMZ is a joke. A few clicks an hour while getting way better exp rates than open world monsters while also not having to worry about food or dying afk is too strong.
---
So you think it's less bloat to add a completely new skill that serves to function as the sparkly version of already-existing skills? Please.
---
Really dude...
---
Just quit.
---
What pixels are being devalued?
---
Unpopular opinion but I would rc to 99 before hunter to 80
---
I'm going off what I saw in the skill announcement. I guess it refers to the armor "warding" against magic?
---
I'm not an expert though, could be I'm missing something
---
I only like wildy slayer because it forces me to places I'd never go otherwise. I don't understand why people like normal slayer.
---
I get your point but it's probably either this or it won't pass at all
---
Nope
---
Wyrms are more gp and xp for hours, drakes were dead content in day one. I have a dhcb and still skip them.
---
"I Laughed way harder than I should have at this"
---
Me agree
---
Umm yeah it does.. it's use is limited and supportive and equipment is basic asf
---
Simple check, 1 to 3 is 1 2 3 values. 1 to 99 is 99 values, not 99-1.
---
I know this is old, but thank you. Could not for the life of me figure out how to turn it on
---
Pures can't wear salad robes so gg
---
Well the top clue scroll hunter has 42k done of one type and the game was released on February 22nd, 2013. So assuming the top player has been playing since release its taken him approximately 2,244 days to get that far. So if "K e r e m" keeps the same pace it would only take 313,252 years to achieve max stack medium clue caskets.
---
Sailing has always been an inside joke for the community dating back to the mid 2000s, apparently jagex wasn’t in on the joke when they tried to actually release it.
---
I can agree with that. The Conjuring wards at the very least belong in the Arceus spellbook.
---
Because their execution of sailing is poor.
---
I could literally do better.
---
This is rs3 stuff, i started again 2 weeks ago after Quittung rs3 7 years ago. We need a oldschool oldschool RuneScape if this shit Passes the Poll. Clear No.
---
i am not saying that damage should only come from weapons. bandos, ancestral and anguish/assembler are really nice general items to boost your damage. 
---
What i am talking about are niche weapon that are best in slot vs one specific type of monster. having a special weapon that is specifically made to slay certain kinds of monster makes sense, while having anti-dragon armor that boosts your damage only vs dragons does not IMO. I am all for damage reductions on specific armors vs specific monsters, since that is what armors are for (reducing damage).
---
I dont mind the new skill but I'm more focused on making magic better so I would be interested to hear more about concepts like that for buffing magic but I still dont personally think completely voting no on warding would be the best. I think it can do a lot of good things for the magic skill altogether.
---
Is this being polled? I hope it is. I hope everyone votes no.
---
Lmao you act like jagex can just "autodetect" some programs like Murgaa
---
that is not how it works at all
---
especially after reading most of the responses from mod ash
---
\&gt;Overloads super absorbs.
---
Except these are purchased with points received as rewards from within the minigame....
---
"Gg try again"
---
Shut the fuckkkkkkk upppp
---
thats not what the post is criticizing, the dude is criticizing how skills with a lot of steps aren't "oldschool" even though herblore is basically as complicated as warding
---
No u
---
So what's the problem with hiding poll results?
---
No b ring, no fire Cape, no b gloves. So you dont have max strength bonus. I think** that obby maxes around 80-90k an hour.
---
ahhhhh makes sense, I was confused cuz I was looking at my player wearing his 99 str cape and there was no hood. So I went in search of these hooded cape icons haha.
---
Shut the fuckkkk uppppp
---
Gotch, misunderstood
---
Sure, that's fair. I would rather see those items be combined with current BiS gear to ensure the previous BiS retained its value, though.
---
Well then then new pk accounts and new players will suffer because they don't want to fight the pre-warding players, essentially gatekeeping.
---
Remember.
---
You can vote no.
---
Warding won't pass. Mark my words. The chance is very small Warding will get 75% in a poll.
---
We have skills dedicated to running in circles and lighting fires. If you actually read a single word of the dev blog you would know what an oversimplification "making magical armors" is.
---
Also, blindly voting no to warding is no different than blindly voting no to pvp polls.
---
Warding bad adding new content to existing skills good
---
Olm is a dragon type enemy. The new robes will be BiS raids magic armor which will offset ancestral quite a bit. There’s only a few other places it’s commonly used.
---
Why use many word if few word do trick?
---
Correct.

Vote yes to entire skill for dagonhai robes.
---
Please don't tell me this is what you're doing.
---
It's weird because one of the strengths of magic in PvM is your ability to move around freely (Maging Bandos for example), and this kinda counteracts that idea.
---
Sorry for your computer :( really not the best to never turn it off.
---
It maxes at around 85k so per hour, so yeah you're right. That's without prayer, at least
---
Also make sure to use overloads, at 83 strength I’m averaging around 75k an hour with no fire cape, but without overloads I’m averaging about 66k
---
Jagex cannot be trusted.
---
Settled is just another 18 year old area locked Ironman who got lucky. There's nothing substantially different from him than any other area locked Ironman or even osrs content creator for that matter.
---
That being said, I quite enjoy settled, but yall really need to like, distance yourself from his dick.
---
Pickpocketed a Hero NPC
---
6 years is too fast
---
Well the fact that you can't rebut my first statement simply means warding is a band aid for a non existant issue that you believe is a big problem
---
The ones that are gonna be devalued
---
Shut the fuckkkkkkk upppppp
---
Yeah I know magic is used, but magic attack bonus isn't currently needed in almost anywhere. This is because of the low magic defence of almost every monster. It literally does not affect your accuracy on most slayer tasks or barrows.
---
That's my point about "crafting" though. I agree with you wholeheartedly, the way crafting is portrayed in RS is that you can basically do everything, but make an arrow. Its a huge umbrella skill.
---
Didn't zeah kinda kill that mentality?
---
I got 77-99 at zeah and its more like mlm than RC.
---
this sub is conspiracy and hate heaven. no matter what is about to be added, people will complain. Jagex could offer free lifetime membership to everyone and people here would STILL find a way to turn it negative
---
The magic skill is already the largest and most versatile skill in the game.
---
The only buffing magic needs is combat related.
---
There's already a game for you called rs3 where top tier gear is given out. A lot of your game knowledge or lack thereof will transfer over.

---
It was always going to pass. I know people that have been mass producing accounts to vote
---
Most of the players go for the most efficient methods, why wouldn't they? I don't like the idea that now you would need some new rings to be most efficient at woodcutting/mining etc, and lay down some "battle wards" to get the best xp rates in combat. 
---
You are forced to do these things (and train warding to use them) if you want to keep up with the competition.
---
Also this update would change too many core mechanics of osrs imo.
---
I read it once and feel like i have a pretty firm grasp on the general concepts. In regards to the other types of vis, i think they deliberately made this a surface level blog, it was not meant to be all inclusive
---
The negative effects of being able to heal while doing damage will make it easier for people to survive already easily survivable content (think Olm on the mage hand or ToB in crabs while you're maging)
---
The negative effects of the AoE damage and the stacking wards will, without a doubt, increase slayer XP rates even more than they currently are, devaluing slayer milestones.
---
The prayer echoes my first two points.
---
I can very easily think of instances in which being able to heal more, restore prayer more, or cause AoE damage via adds could negatively impact the game, all while not having synergy with the original intent of the skill.
---
Yea, been wiping my tears at work all day, still am as we speak.
---
And you're laughing? And here I thought you were incapable of processing anything. Good for you. Glad I didn't need to record it and show you a video of myself.
---
Limiting movement like that is a really crappy idea, I kind of like the concept but feel the execution is sorta awful.
---
Sorry for being rude I came off as a gigantic ass in this thread
---
This has been a really good talk. Hopefully whoever reads this can see the wholistic problems we have both addressed. 
---
Agree that edge pking is only one example, but I chose to focus on that since it is an effective surrogate for generalized one on one pking. I acknowledge mage’s role in tribriding, but that’s an entirely different can of worms. 
---
To you though, what would your solutions to the aforementioned problems be? Just for my own curiosity.

---
a little over three years ago
---
Excellent post. You summed up my thoughts on the matter to a T.
---
\&gt;Why not just include a mystic top via Crafting?
---
I dunno, I've been asking the same question since Warding was initially spoiled.
---
\&gt;So you grind 2 skills (if new account) to get the most out of 1 skill? Kinda wild.
---
Not quite. All warding-related crafting will be done with warding, despite the fact that there's already a skill that makes fabric and two skills that make non-magical items magical. The words you are looking for aren't "kinda wild," they're "fucking stupid."
---
\&gt;But I guess Slayer is the same way?
---
Only if you're really trying to make it seem the same.
---
This would devalue my water jug filling only pvp world bot
---
Never used one, huh?
---
bad english sorry
---
i used to "autoclick" knighs back then
---
i just had my mouse in my hand and clicked always like 30min straight without watching on screen while doing other stuff
---
once i came back to my room and checked if im still getting exp and guess what haha i was across the map lmao
---
there were even 2 ppl who followed me 
---
i explained them that i was not botting but they didnt believe me
---
ofc i got no ban but clicking for HOURS straight without looking is unbelieveable
---
Any magic armor with defence armor is a no from me. Soaking on top of that? Jesus christ.
---
What makes this like RS3 if I may ask? I quit when EoC came out so I am uneducated here. Is it the fact that this skill shares aspects of other skills from RS3? Or is it more about how it interacts with the game? Far as I can tell this skill is a mix between divination and invention, both of which did some good for the game no?
---
You could of had sailing, you voted no.
---
Which you literally get from spending gp.
---

---
I only have a 10k cash stack because I had to pay that guard to be in my meme
---
Fletching is more geared towards weapons/ammunition. AFAIK, Fletching is not responsible for crafting any ranged armor.
---
In my previous comment, I meant that Mining/Smithing were similar to Combat/Crafting considering that's how you obtain the materials for ranged armor. 
---
If anything, Farming/Runecrafting would be a suitable combination of skills for creating magic armor. This would also make looms useful for crafting fabric from certain farming materials.
---
Most purchases irl are a catastrophic loss.  There is simply no AH in real life to give value to all the trash around your house.
---
This is why I only buy gold coins.
---
An items financial burden only affects its opportunity cost, not its actual power level, which is what I'm talking about.  Hell, I even pointed out in my original post that despite being so much better than ahrims (since they actually have a strength bonus), ancestrals end up being overpriced tissuepaper due to their price.
---
So idk, I feel like it's still fair to put a set of robes with a +damage bonus very far ahead ahead of one without.
---
The re balances are independent of the skill.
---
x
---
My favorite part is the guy saying it doesn't even have one equipped
---
Yeah there are some dull skills, in fact many. But if they add something new it doesn't have to be that way.
---
It seems to be all PVM items, perhaps people selling off to buy new TT items.
---
I've lost 100m this week from item flux but no point in selling, it'll go back to a similar price in 1-4 weeks
---
It doesn’t. But having BiS armor losing 2/3 of its utility is pretty big.
---
When will we know if it passed or not?
---
I just want this in the game, idc skill or minigame
---
We need a source brothers
---
&gt; Yes it does.
---
Literally how? its not like Jagex would show the actual results while the poll is live then just change them, they could easily rig the running poll results
---
Are you dense lol? Obviously I have a maxed main, doesn’t have an inferno cape mainly because I’ve been working on this instead lmao... Your opinion is clearly worthless considering you spout out false claims about me without knowing a single fact 🤦‍♂️ Gtfoh troll
---
Content for the sake of content is the only reason for content... No game NEEDS new content... I think they pushed a few things over the line but with actual feedback it could be a nice skill. Did we need farming? Did we need zulrah? Did we need raids? Fuck did we need rs2 over classic? No but all of those changes have had positive impacts on the game at some level and warding can too.
---
slayer 2: supreme t shirt
---
I'm glad you speak for all the med-level players in the game. You have no idea who is, and is not using this content. If anything the Thermonuclear boss should be looked at instead, It's has a much higher level slayer requirement, and other than it's unique drop, has absolute shit regular drops (Much less than 40k/kill). Its also been in the game much longer.
---
how is it sad? I find emergent gameplay super interesting.
---
People downvoting just read "warding bad" when they see your post and immediately smash the downvote button without any further thought. It's why the voting system on Reddit is fundamentally flawed, but maybe this is not the place to discuss all that :p.
---
On another note, very well written post!
---
Sit
---
They seem to have been putting in a lot of work into this skill, if it doesn’t pass the poll will it just get canceled or will they release it anyways?
---
Have you considered instead of making Warding integrating it into Runecrafting. Runecrafting is notoriously a bit of a meme, why not make it Rune Warding for example? 
---
As it stands releasing a new skill sadly seems to be a difficult thing to do with Slayerscape, perhaps appending it a famously disliked skill would be better?
---
Willpower. Just don't do it, that's all there is to it
---
Is joke, comrade.
---
I gave that guy an upvote for trying
---
it probably will pass
---
you're going to ignore skills such as summoning completely and you're just going to straight up copy paste invention from RS3, this is so lame, a new skill would be cool, but not Warding.
---
Cool thanks for nothing, pal.
---
&lt;3
---
I agree!! Warding should go to crafting skill for sure!
---
Stop acting like a fucking insecure middle schooler, you're probably in your 20s dude.
---
Nope, every other vote for the "wrong" option you delete rather than give to the "right" side
---
Lmao that was my brother I'm sorry
---
Full attack meter smh start over
---
If you wanna actually "play the game", there are no items..? im sure you know this if your max-maining. You could use void and just use basic gear, but as soon as u get money ur gonna go stake it.
---
I had to get rid of a max main 99 slayer from a few years ago because I had the same problem. Now that im back with another max main, 99 slayer again. I have no urge to stake at all, in fact I just don't enjoy it anymore. 
---
I've done a few stakes, 13 of them to be exact, they were all 1m stakes, and I won 11 of them, almost all in a row and lost 2 of them. Made me mad I "wasted" such a win streak, and am definitely never going back. Probably just need to take a long break.
---
I understand that designing an entire skill from the ground up is a challenge, but there's far too much involved with Warding for it to be in the game. Too little and it would be outdated too quickly. 
---
I think it's easier to just leave it be.
---
Kill more
---
\&gt; rune platebodies are already lower than alch value 
---
Okay, but that has literally nothing to do with the point I was making.
---
\&gt; who cares that they need a high level to smith 
---
I don't really know what you're getting at here. It's a blatantly obvious discrepancy in level requirements. I'm was pointing it out because the person I responded to said that there was nothing wrong with smithing when there very clearly is.
---
Meanwhile you can take all of these steps out by just abbys crafting cosmics, taking the other skills out of the process. This doesn't go for warding. I see your argument, but nah.
---
Doubt it. Need higher range I'd say
---
Its still a new BIS by a long shot. 6% to like 16% with dragonkin, thats a major upgrade even if you would already need ancestral and 80+ warding
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Let's see if you get the joke by then
---
What would you recommend? Range level wise
---
Ah the slowest skill in the game
---
D
---
\&gt; The robes in the later levels are too powerful for something you can create from a skill. If they must be in the game, they should be a degradable item you can combine with Ancestral to make it stronger, rather than being stronger than Ancestral. Once it degrades, Ancestral will revert to normal and you will have to craft the item once again to gain the buffs. 
---
Counteroffer: have the materials to make the robes be a rare drop from the boss that ships with song of the elves.  I don't think it's a radical statement that the bis for mage shouldn't be gated behind raids 1 until the end of time.
---
&gt;/u/withonesipoftea Did you wait?!
---
why did you tag me here? lol
---
Aw, poor bb
---
He's a kinky fucker
---
As opposed to most skills in this game where you click the same spots for 200 hours. At least high level slayer requires some sort of cognition lol
---
It's sad because the individual isn't using the proper perspective. I agree with you, emergent gameplay is the vitality of any good game.
---
Slayer does... Right now all bis comes from pvm. Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that but really we should be able to make better gear than we currently can, excluding the fact that you need random smiting levels for things like God's words and crafting for blow pipe... If your hold up is that bis imbued items would force you to train it, give feedback that you want them tradable... Don't just shut down the whole idea
---
as long as they make the combat more like WoW
---
You could. It'll be pretty slow though. I assume you don't have 65 agility to boost for the shortcut?
---
Wouldn't runecrafting be more comparable to fletching then if we aren't including it because it is used for creating ammo? So it would be like
---
mining --&gt; smithing
---
combat --&gt;crafting
---
magic --&gt; warding
---
and then fletching and runecrafting for ammo?
---
Boss tasks are already a thing tho
---
I'm sure
---
I'm impressed honestly, I was very pro warding coming off of the runefest announcement. Now with all this combat shit being added and some summoning aspects I have no interest in all this getting added.
---
It should just be a simple crafting skill with maybe some cool niches but in general similar to crafting and smithing.
---
The armor rebalances seem nice but it kinda worries me when we will have like 4 different niche BiS sets for mage. I would rather them be slightly weaker than ancestral or have some kind of useful effect rather than just pure damage. Maybe healing or chance to venom ect.
---
Who hurt you?
---
RuneScape anniversary stream on the main RuneScape youtube (not the OSRS channel) probably from about two months ago.
---
I think he should get 100% and jagex gets 50%
---
Nobody: 
---
Tanzoo: dog noises
---
Well with the giant pool of 83 voters you have there, I see no point in adding warding. Cancel it, West.
---
Well tbh what did you think you were gonna get here???? if there's an item you can buy, then obviously it's something you can sell. jsut keep playing sand casino, it's a fun exciting way to play the game provided you aren't using IRL money that you need to pay rent.
---
...Sorry they're trying to add a skill with nuances to avoid the fact that the other two skills are dead-ish?
---
Nah I don't yet, tbh I'm just looking to make some money, used to do it on an old account years ago n sell Dragon bones , forgot a lot about this game
---
Sorry I should say, there favourite addition since they left producing the game. Form the most recent anniversary livestream on the main RuneScape channel.
---
Man I've just noticed so much dropping, lance is low bought for 89, dhcb has dropped 20+m, justiciar is 74m... Tbows all over the damn place because it was 1180 when I bought it. Just seems like a lot of price manipulation to me... Don't wanna panic sell but also don't wanna lose 300m lol
---
Maybe 61+? Least so you can use rune xbow
---
60+ like at the minimum. Back in the day I use to safe spot them with rune cbow at 65 range or so. It will still take a long time
---
Did you read nothing else on the post? There's a lot more than just imbues and making robes coming with warding... lmao
---
Not a fan of battle wards or conjuring. You guys added too much bloat to the skill in this blog. IMO start with the simple aspects and an introductory quest and then update warding in chunks.
---
There's some obscure meme subs I like more but that's probably just my god awful sense of humour
---
It's the glasses. They offer an exagerated sense of innocence.
---
Love how dyslexia implies you can't learn color patterns lol... Honestly better comment than reply imo
---
I currently have a magic shortbow(i) but by the time i reach 64 ranged i should be able to use a dragon crossbow and i heard that the broad bolts were more efficient(plus you get a shield too)
---
The point isn't to get it in the game, it's, to open a discussion on the current failings of warding and how they can be fixed.
---
It will likely get scrapped into pieces and slowly added through other content. For instance Balastas were originally planned to be added from sailing but since that failed they eventually repolled it and added it with the MM2 quest. 
---
So if you like stuff like the armor rebalance or the magic chins ect there is a good likely they could be polled outside of warding if it fails.
---
He already gets paid for doing these things though.
---
Just power level your range to 65-70, then you should be good.
---
lower level req = more people smithing them = price lowers
---
what other consequence do you want from lowering the requirement to smith rune platebodies?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O40KCUMKv4Y
---
I agree with you on the tbow, but I meant more accessible gear like the Cosmos armour that they want to add, which gives extra damage against aquatic creatures. Melee and Ranged dont have any equivalent to that
---
Then why are you making an entire post about how it's 2019 and it's still not "fixed"..?
---
I agree that all of these changes could have a drastic impact on the game. I'm all for a new skill, however all of these additions with no testing might be horrible for the integrity of the game. Battle wards don't have any place in the game and the new mage gear does seem op in some places. I liked the idea of upgrading it from ancestral. Good post.
---
venezuela got power again
---
It’s a FUCKING. JOKE.
---
The text prompt says you throw the “nasty nest” or something along those lines on the ground. I believe it is so f2p can get them woodcutting but not allow them to have birds nest, a p2p item.
---
This is the end of OSRS guys. 
---
Can't you just picture this when you remember how shitty RS2 got towards the end?
---
Lol pretty sure I just saw the comment that inspired this meme
---
I remember Jagex sending out a surveys asking what players wanted for the future of the game. And supposedly tons of people wanted a new skill (myself included). Jagex has an insanely difficult task of creating a skill that EVERYONE likes. Currently, I doubt everyone likes training every skill in the game. RC is slow, agility is brain dead, firemaking is basically a mini game now etc. I love skilling and enjoy achieving each milestone level. Even though warding may not be the most amazing thing out there, I’m sure I’ll like it and that it’ll be fun

I mean. It won't. And I don't think that it would. But I wanna play the game how I want to play it. I dont want to be forced to do something to unlock shit I already have.
---
Slayer 1 is a shit fucking skill. Excellent content, but should’ve never been a skill. Would be better as a half skill half mini game hybrid. 
---
Not saying that they should change it. Just that on initial release it shouldn’t have been a skill.
---
Was this skill polled? I liked the sailing skill.
---
Is there any money maker better than hydra that isnt raids?
---
Higher value &gt; lower value

Lvl 1 crook &lt; lvl 100 mafia bos

Or you could start with the higher value and continue to use &gt;, but I think itscoolerif it builds up to asian
---
This is the reason why no skill will ever pass in OSRS. Why does it have to be one or the other? We can have multiple new skills if the ideas are good enough but instead people vote no to a skill because it is not the one they specifically want.
---
When ToB was polled people didn't complain that it was in meiyerditch instead of whatever place they wanted it to be. They just looked at the content and voted on whether or not they wanted it. This is a problem pretty much exclusively happens with skills be added.
---
Nope, they only die while they are growing. I've left them for months and came back to them all alive. It's literally a free 100k every day or multiple times a day
---
That's how content becomes inconsistent though, it sucks but that's how it works unless it changes. An example is this is the hatred towards the new art style changes in Zeah.
---
8k per mark woot
---
Yeah I wish I could afford that.
---
They are not hard to fabricate at all. They could make it so each vote has a 60% or whatever % chance they want to vote “yes” regardless of what the player chose. For example if I vote “no” to warding, the program will display on screen that I have voted “no”. But in the database it uses RNG to determine if that vote will register in the database as yes or no. The live poll results will update as the votes come in based on what’s entered in the database. I did this as a high school project to literally demonstrate this argument.
---
or you know, go buy them
---
To be honest, runecrafting should be to magic what fletching is to range. 
---
This should be cut back a bit and added to runecrafting.
---
I'm a virgin and I play RuneScape
---
that's an awfully strange thing to say about your grandmother
---
Which is why Jagex decided this would be the perfect time to hide poll results.
---
The game is set outside...green is the colour of grass, trees, etc. It's a loophole to say you go outside a lot. Why would you complain?
---
Didn't they add the extra combat stuff because people complained that just crafting armor was too boring? Who in the world did they talk to and get that horrible feedback?
---
Yes, smithing/crafting *could be* considered simple or boring... but that's what makes it old school. That doesn't mean they need to add weapon sharpening or modding or armor bolstering or whatever (like in other MMOs) to make the profession more complex/interesting - it just doesn't fit old school.
---
Also the fact that she’s like 5’ and 100 pounds or less.
---
There's gotta be 26% of us out there, right? I don't think just because a gap is there, a skill needs to fill it. I don't think the game is hurting without being able to create robes, and I don't think it will be improved by allowing us to do so. Also, the stone things will rip us out of any semblance of an old school feel, Imo. Might as well throw summoning in there as well so everyone has a pack yak.
---
I guess i shouldnt resist, as even if it fails at 10% they're gonna jam it down our throats eventually (my guess is they remove NMZ imbues and hold them hostage behind warding, forcing us to vote yes if we want our bonuses back). They've spent money creating this skill, they're not gonna let that go to waste just cause the community doesn't want it.
---
Either that or it would ruin warding, because the only way it would ever get accepted is if warding was slower and more boring than runecrafting.
---
Reddit account maybe but I’ve had this rsn for 15 years
---
Crafting already is partially crafting for magic 😂
---
Xp0s3d
---
either way i’m holding onto mine as they get a lot of use , just wondering wtf is up
---
*Laughs in vote no*
---
It means that the osrs team has been manipulating item requirements to help content pass. It's a joke that a blowpipe or twisted bow is level 75.
---
I'd like to compile a list of ideas and purposes for sailing. Primarily what I have in mind is essentially creating private stocks for things buyable from charters via "cargo" missions.
---
Potential for Sailing + Thieving exp with pirating, Slayer + Hunter to hunt down specific "mythical" monsters, having ship voyages to new endgame boss areas that can't be teleported to, and you could guide a ship of 50 people heading there with like 5 of your friends to ensure the voyage is successful.
---
If I had full agency over its introduction I'd probably do several big things like introduce multiple skills at once which play off each other. For instance, Astronomy would mesh well with the navigation aspect of sailing. It doesn't have to be a minigame in all aspects and have fairly brainless methods of grinding. Could aid in construction if there's emphasis on building your own ships in its endgame instead of being a shiphand. I'd also fragment crafting into a less bloated skill and have the supplies unlocked through sailing aid expanded crafting categories. (Masonry, Tailoring, Jewelry)
---
You CAN do sailing without turning it into a minigame and without it being a billion things at once. If OSRS could only have one hurrah for a new skill and be done with adding anything else, sailing feels *right* to me.
---
Why am I the only human on earth that wants summoning back :(
---
As a mini-game or just content, sure.
---
It’s actually “Vanessa.”
---
I think you have that backwards. New skill added to the game gives reason/purpose to add new flavors of robes.
---
im never gonna max because im not gonna do something i dont like
---
(i have 200m range xp from pvm only btw lmfao)
---
ill practice with you. i got my own supplies but im american so the times might be off
---
with the amount of people that follow you with a mob mentality, isn't tweeting that then posting this on a reddit comment pretty counter-intuitive?
---
Why are you writing like you're talking to an answering machine and you know people are home?
---
The elite diary armor is also purple and grey to answer your question.
---
This devalues my black wizard robe top collection on my ironman account.
---
&gt;Mostly because I'm a rational human being capable of thought.

Does every poll in rs really need this kind of thing. Feels like politics where people get super hostile and defensive if you don't agree with them.

Sure thing scumbag. Still waiting on your od.

I actually went to college with the girl in the red. Her freshman year she gained a bit of notoriety.
---
It all happened one day in one of the freshman dorms. She and the guy she had been seeing decided it would be a great idea to have sex in the showers. The fun quickly turned disastrous when the physical activity caused her to pass out and immediately all to the floor. In a panic the guy tries to get help by calling campus police, however once they arrive they start accusing him of attacking her because of the bruises from the fall.
---
Everything gets cleared up with campus police but the story starts making its round around campus. This was also around the time when Yik Yak, that anonymous message board app was popular. Within a week essentially everyone knew who she was, well atleast they knew her by the name Shower Girl. I remember even meeting her at a party once without knowing who she was.
---
About a year after that happened I was having lunch with a friend and he asked if I remembered Shower Girl, I said yes. Then it was followed by a picture of her on a porn set.
---
She’s only 36. She had my mom at 12, and my mom had me at 12.

Slayer 2: A.K.A. Artisan...
---
I genuinely believe once you get seriously invested in the duel arena, there's no going back. I know many friends I used to play casually with and once they got to staking levels and gave it ago, they never stopped.
---
It's simply not efficient to play the game making MAYBE a few mil an hour when you can go to the duel arena and make that much in a 30 second match. You can literally make more money there in a day than someone can in a few years of playing RS doing regular methods.
---
The only true answer is willpower. You have to restrict yourself from going back. Even getting rid of your account would do nothing. It's fairly quick to NMZ to all 99s again...
---
I agree

---
Can superiors have a chance to drop a brimstone key?
---
It's hilarious because dummies like you think it needed to be added.
---
Most of those unfinished quest lines should literally never be touched as well.
---
The fact some people actually care about these quest lines and the shitty lore astound me.
---
&gt; accept that the OSRS community doesn’t want any new skills
---
That isn't the problem, if you put a poll up asking "do you want a new skill?" it would get like 80%+ yes. They have surveyed it multiple times and it was comes back that way. The problem is that everyone wants something different and will vote no if it is not the exact skill they want. This phenomenon is pretty much exclusively with polling skills and is likely why no skill will ever be added sadly.
---
Nah, we mains are in this camp too

She’s gonna be a great gramma here in 7 more months lord permitting.

Hahaha, it's all over the place hey...
---
The worst is thieving IMO. Where the best money maker is still master farmers which unlocks at 37.
---
That needs far more content.
---
It hasn't even failed once yet lol.
---
My point is give your alt 10bil, and race them to 99 in any skill of your choice. If that money significantly cuts down the grind I'd consider it a buyable. Dragon axe? Dragon pickaxe? Dragon harpoon? Entirely negligable.
---
Try buying 99 agility. Stamina pots and werewolf is the closest thing, but it's not significantly expensive and can be covered by skilling any moneymaker alongside.
---
Lol no.
---
Sailing was an April fools joke that was taken too far. It was never and could never be interesting.
---
Can't afford it and definitely not in a clan, and I think it's pretty cool. Kind of what the wilderness is all about, no rules. If someone is powerful enough to claim their own territory seriously, I think that's fucking awesome. Are they mostly assholes? Undoubtedly. But still think it's cool someone actually controls an area of the game through sheer force, because it's there for the taking.
---
Yeh they opened the poll with how people liked the skill fitting into the lore, being simple, making sense...
---
And then they threw summoning and AoE buffs at it.
---
The skill as it sits in this blog is a weird less-useful hybrid of invention, summoning and divination. All to simply "explain" imbuing and magic robes creation. What? At this point it's some weird clone of magic with aspects of RS3 to make it enticing and useful.
---
Id rather we got the invention aspect added to all skills, to add uses to levelling them. Currently you can just buy everything and there's not many untradeable benefits to skills. Deconstruction could play a role there, and then just expand runecrafting and magic to encompass these other aspects.
---
That's a no from me dawg.

oh so chins reset the attack tick?

I basically only ever skill. And warding seems like a terrible idea to me. It's just going to create dead content in the future when all future updates inevitably go to that (also see: unnecessary achievement diary requirements)
---
Alora just celebrated a 3 year anniversary too.
---
It's still "buy able"
---
Just like rune crafting is technically buy able if you pay for runners.
---
People who cry about buy able skills scream broke accounts

Wait Olm is counted as a dragon? I thought it was some weird ass lanky lizard?
---
Oh, honey...

Another thing to consider is that other players (mains) can help by tanking or luring or moving the boss for the ironman. So even though they don't do damage they help. For example if a main were to kill all the minions in GWD and the iron could attack the boss, or vice-versa.
---
Bro, I'm sayin'. Still listening to it on repeat.
---
That's the most scary thing to me. Our developers are thinking this is a good idea and ready to be shipped out (or at least polled). There are so many holes that need addressing before I would let this leave the drawing board.
---
I mean, I don't think you're wrong, everything could fit into other skills. But then again, a lot of other skills could fit into others as well.
---
Construction could be spread over wc and crafting
---
Smithing could also be a crafting sub tree
---
Firemaking could very well be part of woodcutting
---
Attack and strength could merged into melee
---
Runecrafting could fit into magic
---
It's not that a new skill is absolutely necessary to make those mechanics works, it's that it fleshes it out better and makes things not cluttered. Crafting already has a stupid amount of stuff in it, and relocating all arcane and magical things into "magical crafting" makes sense.
---
Being against a new skill strictly because it's a new skill is just fear of change, imo. Yeah it could be into magic/crafting/runecrafting, but that doesn't mean it's the best option to introduce those mechanics.
---
I don’t play anymore really and slayer is partly why.
---
  
---
It’s not a bad skill at all, Jagex just doesn’t know how to make the other skills get as much attention it does.
---
As someone who has been playing for a while and cannot kill zulrah but already has skrotizo pet, nah man, I can barely fucking get jad down, let alone inferno shit, its great you find this game fucking easy, but ALOT of people don't man. 
---
Add a new mechanic to raids for maxed only acc runs, versus various lvl runs. Let "max level" be considered lvl 121+, so anyone 121-126 would be in a higher grade/harder raid that could potentially drop better loot. In my personal opinion, add untradables to these raids, no matter if a person gets hacked, if they have the item insured for 50m (ya, if your doing endgame shit and you get BIS nontradeable OP item, 50m is a drop in the bucket to secure the item forever), they can get it back. 
---
They simply need to create new untradeable end-game gear in my personal opinion. The second it becomes tradeable, someone is going to learn how to optimally PK with these OP items, and they would change the pricing of other various things, scythe, tbow, etc.
---
Ideas on some items would be like: Helix staff (you can think of the design, lol), give it the ability to heal you, like a health drain from the opponent, would probably be one of the most op items within raids depending on its stats.
---
Corrupt Wand, skulls you, BIS, at the cost of 33% of current health, the next amount of damage would do double damage, but if the damage exceeds the amount of health points lost, the life is recovered. 
---
For ranged, I think they should add upgrade to crystal bow:
---
1 primordial/range/mage stone from cerberus + war (bando), holy (sara), unholy (zam) + crystal bow: 3 new intense crystal bow upgrades that are permanent making it the most cost effective and BIS bow, would be sweet af in my opinion.
---
For melee, they should do only one thing, allow claws to be poisoned, and allow items that can be dipped in poison, to be also dipped in a disease causing potion or something, that causes disease vs poison, giving the possibility to lower pure pkers prayer, magic level, defense, strength, etc. You could get luck or nah. 
---
ETC.
---
Now, is this a good idea, idk, I am not a pro, and I am not a large percentage of the community, I am just one burnout giving an opinion.
---
**TL;DR: Add non-tradeable end-game gear + a harder raid for lvl 121-126 teams, give them the option to do a "harder or brutal" version of the raid, higher farming req, herblaw req, etc, hell even add a potion upgrade or 2 within the higher tier raid. Allow these untradeables to be lost, not pkable, but must be insured if you want to use it. Have them require ANOTHER scroll, weapon enchantment scroll, worth 30-100m, which gives the untradable item the ability to be used in the wilderness/pking/rev caves.**

dude the guy had a family.

Would you like to tell us what you mean by "combat is dead" or "crafting is dead" or "mining is dead" or "smithing is dead"?

You're god damn right

FUCK WARDING
---
wdr does scheduled raids every saturday morning and you can find them during the week randomly as well. wdr mentors when they host will give you time to get and such if you aren't at raids, i wouldnt suggest just waiting at raids unless saturday.
---
Join galaxy clan cc. We do learner raids quite often, even for people with 0 kc. If you like it you can apply to join the clan too.
---
If something is 1/10, and you kill 10k then you are 0% dry if you have 1k. Dryness is how unluckyyou are, if you endup wth 10k after 10k kc then you are soaking wet :^)

This is just the Sara boss in gwd and now also the Zammy

Current poll is hidden but when I voted didn't show results.  Probably won't show until the poll closes

Go into the barbarian village, there's a dungeon there you can run through to get your first 10k. Just click the rocks with a giant hole in it and run past all the enemies

the arceeus house library book fetching thing gives you xp books, which you can choose either magic or runecrafting, and it scales to your level

---
This sub: “Woodcutting is such a diverse and fun skill, so much variety and different ways to train it”.
---
This skill sounds stupid. Please just add it to crafting or runecrafting somehow. We don’t need a new skill like this.
---
I'm actually more happy about those announcements to the magic armor, to bring things more in line with actually being viable and not suck ass
---
who was it?
---
I don’t watch the Q&amp;A. It would be helpful if you actually explained what they said instead of making a snarky comment with no value.
---
120 Slayer will pass in OSRS even without any new content.
---
The was when it stopped becoming popular. I pked every day back in the day and countless of my friends quit because of the ditch which is why I believe what I do.
---
Wrong about what?
---
Do like RS3 and let us use the skillcape on the hood to combine them for a model like this
---
Honestly that's how I feel about pretty much all armor/gear. Monsters should drop the loot and then skillers craft the gear. We get so much of our BIS armor and gear just from monster drops without even using skills.
---
As an ironman, AoE buffs and wards sound like a great way to never get a single loot drop from multi combat ever again
---
Crafting and Smithing could use a massive overhaul in general.
---
I can make Leather Chaps at 18 crafting, something useful for Level 1 Range.  THEN I can make Studded Chaps at level 44 crafting, for level 20 range.  It takes me 26 levels to realize, "Oh boy, I should add studs."
---
At least Smithing makes sense lore wise in metal tiers, but item wise?  Well I know how to shape this metal, but I seem to forget how to shape it into a Scimitar every so often, so I'll just make a dagger and med helm instead.
---
The current content could use a massive overhaul and make space for mage armor, actually allowing for skills to interact with each other.
---
We don't need a new skill that serves the same purpose as Crafting / Smithing, with niche activities like Conjuration thrown in to try to get it to pass.
---
The proposed skill is messy.
---
never even thought about it, can't unsee.
---
Add option to attach hood to skillcapes! Always loved that look
---
gatekeeping based on gameplay time, game mode elitism and total level? you're the exact kind of person no one will discuss anything with.
---
I enjoyed playing the dungeoneering minigame.
---
It's a minigame. Not a skill. Why was it made a skill.
---
That audio setup was given to him well after the series began? The reason he got it was because his series was doing so well.
---
Someone else already has, I see no point in copying and pasting their response.
---
And maybe you should?
---
Okay thanks, I clicked them so fast I didn’t realize there was any extra text.
---
Well it seems like all of the fit thematically in existing skills.
---
i pretend to bot sometimes to troll autismos like you ;)

Lol the fact your rsn is your reddit name is actually hilarious. Great account security bro

I just want there to be another **CHEST BRAH** appearance and I’ll be happy lol
---
Ik I've spent the past couple days looking for a mentor to no luck

I’d quit if they raised the skill level cap to 120 lol
---
yeah didn't read it as "move the cursor away then back on thing." my b

---
My arm's big adventure isn't a new quest.
---
Great brain Robert isn't a new quest, and the herb patch isn't a reward from it. It's an elite diary reward.
---
Hosidius favor isn't a quest.
---
Only ONE herb patch was added as quest reward since osrs release, and it's a sequal to the one quest that that previously rewarded you with an herb patch.
---
If you think there are too many herb patches fine. But blaming it on quest regards is actually retarded as fuck, because that's not what's been happening in os.
---
Battle wards = time to quit osrs on all my accs. 
---
Summoning wards = same as above
---
Can’t you just make the new armors an on use item similar to the kraken tent on whips. Use “venomous ward item” on ahrims or mystic to get 1000 hits with the benefits. Makes it more simple!
---
Keep it simple. Don’t get ahead of yourselves and excited in meetings saying oh let’s add this or that! Remember development principles.
---
also you may need to equip a shield that resists fire...
---
I imagine this is the approach they'd take, especially as this is essentially what RS3 did with trimmed masterwork armour, which requires melting down Torva and Malevolent armours, both of which come from high level bosses and can't be farmed in the same way d'hides or ores can be.
---
I love all the new robes ideas, they aren’t best in slot but I think they would all provide use, at some level or some situation, which is what I want out of Warding. It is a bit odd however that the dragon oriented gear for melee and ranged are weapons (crossbow &amp; Lance), but the mage version will be robes.
---
I feel like the genuine primary reason why people are voting no is simply because it’s a new skill and would mean another 99 before Max cape, which is really sad since I can see there has been a lot of thought and deliberation gone into this skill, and we are being worked with closely on it. Still not entirely sure I’d vote yes right now since the battle wards seem like genuine metabreaking for group PvM, but it does certainly fascinate me and a lot of the ideas are really cool
---
Lets hope they are doing a mazerunner and posting crazy shit in with the normal shit so people vote in the not crazy shit.
---
I would've hated it still. It wasn't fun lol
---
there are two mentor raids running right now for example.. are you looking in the right placE?
---
Are most players actually going to vote no to Warding?
---
dragon = elite
---
we do raids is, I find to be a bit unreasonably strict with their reqs, and wouldn't let him in without a dragon pick. They are super good though at teaching once you can get in.
---
I opened this next to my mom fuck me lol
---
Yeah no shit. I literally said you can tell the production value went up. Or are you incapable of reading?
---
I miss dungeoneering so much.
---
Original looks really good, only the new content is grey &amp; purple (Arceuus, Catacombs, you’re probably thinking there’s a lot of purple since you’re likely in the catacombs a lot) and the proposed version looks really similar to the thieving cape
---
Hahahahhahahahahahha
---
how do you know your not a vocal minority?
---
A lot of the updates that weren't Squeal of Fortune and Evolution of Combat were actually pretty cool. But people see stuff that is part of Runescape 3 and it immediately gets chinese telephoned out to "THIS PARTICULAR UPDATE IS THE EXACT SAME AS MTX AND EOC" and its really damaging for any kind of legitimate critical thinking towards updates and their effect on the game.
---
Voting yes out of spite
---
I disagree with most of this
---
+1
---
Please no warding
---
His production prior to the setup was good as well, that was my point. Smh my head
---
this is skillspecs, he literally suicides for content
---
Yeah, but you also don't have to do it if it's a minigame.
---
I mean, imagine if you need to sink quite a few CoX uniques to make Kinhunter armor. Or sink a shitload of scales to make Venemous Armor. And on top of that, combine ancestral robes with both of them.
---
It would be super expensive but it'd be suitable BiS for those bosses.
---
I mean you can use wards to summon things to fight for you...
---
Thanks a lot OP. Jagex are gonna see this and poll a new slayer master and 20 new slayer mobs at the expense of unique new pieces of content.
---
wow my feelings
---
dpick isnt an unreasonable req. learners/low kc raids do guardians very often and dpick is like a flat 9 or 10 max hit difference.
---
Wasted content
---
Im gonna qualify 50 alts now just to vote yes.
---
Ibans is same dps till 78 magic, and charging Ibans is easier than getting more enhancments from wildy slayer
---
VOTE NO TO WARDING
---
well thats mostly due to the fault of the new generation of games. Before runescape was one of the very few games that had an open world where you could interact with other players. However now people have like Fortnite, Overwatch, League, etc which give you instant gratification instead of extremely delayed gratification. The only reason people play osrs is purely for nostalgia.
---
Blaming it on quest rewards isn’t “retarded as fuck” because you literally can’t use them without the quest. Yes the harmony island one isn’t a quest reward directly, but that entire area is useless without the herb patch. Again, it’s just annoying that new content areas (which typically means a new quest) are always brought in with an herb patch.
---
HIDE POLL RESULTS PEOPLE AREN'T VOTING FOR WHAT THEY REALLY WANT
---
POLL RESULTS ARE HIDDEN MAKE POSTS ON REDDIT CRYING ABOUT X POLL BETTER NOT PASS
---
Literally fucking sheep. Baaaaa sheep... Baaaa...
---
I see what you mean, but if anything, Magic shouldn't be the skill required for making it's own armor then. Farming might be a good fit (I believe the skill notes mention silkworm and flax farming of some sort).
---
But this still requires at least some level of crafting to weave fabric.
---
LOL
