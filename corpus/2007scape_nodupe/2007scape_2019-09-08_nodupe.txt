Yeah absolutely. Just a curiosity.

I am (extremely) short Dragon Bones, if this would result in lower dbones prices I would be very happy.

So xp doesn't actually isn't based on the amount of hp you have.
---

---
Water friends have 8,000 hp and give 934.2 combat xp and 308.2 hp xp along with 335 Slayer xp
---
Greater demons have 6,000 hp and give 385.2 combat xp and 127.1 hp xp along with 135.4 Slayer xp
---
Last example rune dragon has 68,250 hp and gives 4,200 combat xp along with 1386 hp xp. But 2051 Slayer xp. 
---
So really none of the xp rewards are based off hp anymore unlike osrs being 1:1 (some exceptions)
---
Never change reddit LOL
---
Slayer will tell you what to kill while making money plus with black mask boost its good xp all-round
---
I'd consider Linux, I made the switch and don't regret it one bit. 
---
The only issue is any game with anti-cheat won't work, but gaben himself is working with people to get it going. I personally don't care for those games (overwatch, rust, ECT) but to a lot of people it's important to them.
---
If you have new hardware, everything just works out of the box. Steams proton has fixed 4k or so games to work on Linux, and for everything else Lutris, and Wine works great.
---
Ah jeez you brits and your phrases. Thought it was asked this whole time, just seems like it would make more sense haha
---
I died a few hours ago doing my herb run in morytania, logged in on mobile somehow attacked a feral vampyre and dc’d. Lost my farming pet that i got at 50 farming and I didn’t insure cause I was so sure I wouldn’t die while just skilling.
---
That would balance out though. It would become the best boss to grind, which would mean everyone would grind it more than any other boss, which would make the prices go down to appropriately as all the bossers would be doing zulrah.
---
I am far away from completing song of the elves and i want this.
---
Fishing 2 is my favorite skill
---
NPC Aggression Timer
---
Give me 50m and find out my man.
---
Am I relevant or nah?
---
I started it for the fairy tings probably 9 months ago and finished it probably 6 months after that. I was tired of getting the stupid fairy queen clue step.
---
Fucking hate osrs Easter outfit. Thankfully so does everyone else and I only seen I worn ironically, which is acceptable I guess.
---
Y fletch?
---
A boss that drops one of the best range weapons, best melee helmet, and the attachement to the toxic trident shouldnt BE easily accessible
---
I love the wildy bosses but dude it is so god damn  annoying just teleing every single kill. Only time I can do vene is when I get a weekday off and can play in the morning.
---
Song is too high leveled. Ironman go for blowpipe way before elf city. Regicide should be the req.
---
I like skilling the most too but I find hunting the most XP where I go towards :)
---
I dont get it
---
Why?
---
Thats how it goes with BR type games. I know people with thousands of games played but under 100 wins. I wouldnt feels too bad about it.
---
Dragon Slayer 2 as mentioned above. Once you complete that, Vorkath is good money. Slayer is always good XP and once you get a little higher GP as well.
---
Mates are guys I drink with. Friends are people I do important shit with. :)
---
ive been playing forever and im still too scared to try it. congrats man
---
Jagex doesn't want you to know this, but that's actually Vorkath's dick, and he can grow a new one.
---
Big fan myself love what they did with the Rev cave update for fishing 2 cant wait for fishing 3
---
My god you're far up your own ass. I just pointed out your hypocrisy, no need to take it personal. Thanks for adding absolutely nothing by the way, talking about repetition. Your comments and your existence are pointless.
---
Low stats shit gear
---
I wont support any solution to bots that does not directly combat bots.
---
Dont change the game for them. Fix the problem at the sources.
---
Wow, you are so helpful!
---
already existing mechanics that are for looting in pvp. 
---
the fact that looting bags work on stuff that isnt dropped in the wilderness or from direct player kill is just a massive oversight.
---
That was in a time when alternatives to zulrah didn't exist and lots of actual people did it.
---
Any info would help? Are you fighting them with a steel hatchet or a bronze throwing axe maybe?
---
What gear what stats ?
---
What's with all the people defending or even encouraging botting in this thread?
---
Playing multiple accounts is okay. Sharing accounts is allowed. Getting your "chinese buddy" (wink wink nudge nudge) to do the inferno for you is not okay. You would be banned.
---
Camelot theme is more fitting
---
What drives you to do this?
---
Damn they look rad.
---
Would love to see something similar coming from a new boss or Raids 3 as Hydra is pretty stacked.
---
Nerf current pb, add new attachment/pipe from Raids 3 that has the same stats as unnerfed version, or even slightly worse.
---
Arguably the most powerful and versatile weapon in the game shouldn't be worth a measly 3m.
---
Account is compromised, they are waiting for you to have something valuable that you haven't banked.
---
I came here to say that
---
Using a toxic blowpipe is double the DPS over a dragon crossbow using ruby and diamond bolts (e) and a twisted buckler. Is the cost of scales worth the DPS upgrade when gold farming brutal blacks?
---
lol are these the bots that repeat whatever people say around them
---
That’s definitely some poor kid after running into return of wilderness at the GE
---
It’s weird seeing NPCs talking about an irl location
---
Oh, by the time I started the quest I was so far into slayer that I'd never see half the bones needed 
---
I can see your point though, if you start the quest early enough that might be viable
---
Is there an option to hide firecape related achievements on the subreddit ?
---
Hydraulic Pipe?
---
This was really interesting, a lot of mechanics and exploits coming into play to achieve this. Job well done.
---

Stop viewing the bonecrusher as a prayer training item and view it as a free pray pot in the catacombs and you'll see it's not lackluster
---
Yeah you're 100% right, I know the bots hardly make a difference, I've seen people complain about dbones going down cause bots. From what, 3k to 2.5k ea in like over a year? Definately not from other bones being added too or anything. 
---
Although I do have a question, I recently came back after taking a break for almost a year, how come onyx stuff is only like 2.4m now? Something get added that gives out onyx?
---
I started at 75
---
No clue. But i'd take you on raids for sure with my friends. Lmk what other people say and ill do lower or whatever.
---
Tbh this is one of the reasons I love RuneScape so much. 
---
Most other games just feel so linear. Do this, then this, lastly this.
---
RuneScape there are so many little things you *could* do, but are by no means required.
---
Yep. People keep it going because memes
---
Never kill it again lol
---
Risk what? Even if you die every other trip (which definitely doesn’t happen) you save a lot more money than using gilded altar. There’s 0 reason for normal accounts to use anything else
---
I’m doing a whole task. 130 to 170 or whatever it usually is. I only pick up the rune drops and put the herbs in me sack. Maybe 3 trips but I find it doable.
---
*furiously completing captcha mid PVP battle*
---
No way, xp/hr is way more with house tele and using camelot bank chest on pvp worlds.
---
You can get like 1m xp/hr at a gilded altar if you bring noted bones, more if you have a runner or use a butler or whatever.
---
It certainly is very relevant if you’re going for 99 pray.
---
considering there's 6 tiers now, (hard was originally the highest tier, now its the 3rd highest) its basically right in the middle
---
No way you got that with those levels!! Congrats
---
&gt; Although I do have a question, I recently came back after taking a break for almost a year, how come onyx stuff is only like 2.4m now? Something get added that gives out onyx?
---
Zalcano boss I believe, there may be a few other factors, but that's the main one I believe.
---
If you 3 tick you can get 4.2k buckets at 65 mining, or 5.2k buckets at 99 mining  
---
Without 3 tick it's like 3k at 65 mining and 4.2k at 99 mining
---
I love lamp
---
Runelite is the more conmonly-used client.
---
Money is temporary, account progress stays there forever. It's the thought process I used when buying the XoC prayers... I think it's more important to spend money into permanent upgrades than gear upgrades. That way if you get hacked, you won't lose progress.
---
petition to remove zulrah but leave his shit unobtainable forever
---
w00t!
---
Both osbuddy and runelite do that.
---
More like you you just got that jad boi
---
Use RuneLite. No sense using the default.

You think Jagex could inplement that? they can't even get new Items to appear correctly

They wont let me :(

I just need to do the barbarian assault parts and I'll have those diaries done, but the reason behind it was the same as you, to train agility faster.

How is it lacklustre for Torah’s? U litterally become a tank whist already being tanky as fuck at lower hps

I made a video on this as u described

Less so than if they just bought bonds with their $

Man that's so true lmao I play music off 99% of the time but when I turn it on it's all so nice lol
---
We love men
---
What do you mean by no value to anyone?
---
100%. Mining that shit in the gas clouds was tedious.
---
If that’s the case for addicts to do that like make a new account or rent ect then that’s their fault. For majority of players who would want this option in the first place wouldn’t think of going through the extra trouble to do that. Also I wouldn’t say it’s a small portion of the player base. Sooo many people stake and quit because they get cleaned. Once a full friends list of online friends looks like a ghost town now due too all these staking stories I’ve heard.
---
He likes purple a lot? Idk I think that’s the joke.
---
They are if you're brave enough
---
Does this mean you'll stop constantly pming sick nerd instead of just typing in chat
---
That's what makes r/2007scape so unique. We suck the soul out of everything. Still a fun ride before the inevitable happens.
---
Ugh! Shut *UP*, meow!

For real. They only have to ban a few to deter the rest.

This is why you should read the dialogue..

Lol pking back in the day for me was magic spells and hoping someone didn't bring food or brought like herrings or something
---
I think the word you're looking for is "majesty."
---
Yeah we need more slayer updates :))))
---
Tbh I would totally believe there’s a jmod doing this right now. Jed and Reach can’t be the only ones.
---
Why live off your shitty Jagex salary and be loyal to a company that obviously doesn’t give a shit about you when you can abuse your position and easily quadruple your income doing things that aren’t even illegal. 
---
At the very least someone is abusing their knowledge to merch on alts and rwt the profits.
---
Mark my words it’s only a matter of time before we here about the next sketchy crown boi
---
Pretty sure I was getting over 400k with d bones even
---
You're welcome! (Btw, this thread is a month old but I like your enthusiasm) shit away dear friend.
---
Hey enjoy that time with your girlfriend. Don’t be a dick. Imagine you bring her somewhere and she doesn’t give a shit and gets on her phone. And you really wanted her to go. You would feel horrible or at least you should. So put that phone down and actually be a good bf
---
well pets by nature literally have no value because they cant be traded and otherwise have no gold value, no uses outside of aesthetics or some dialogue and no merit besides being a status symbol.
---
UNLESS youre the kind of person who finds that kind of thing very important. the rest of my sentence says this.
---
He must be an iron man.
---
Hell no. I use a VPN - there are a hell of a lot of countries who monitor everyone's network traffic. I can't watch YouTube videos or listen to music when playing RS then? What's so wrong about the privacy of a VPN?
---
I liked the part where you killed the barrows brothers
---
Cause it’s a shit, not well thought out mini game
---
I mean I have a friend who has spent easily 5k+ on rsgp in 3 years and hasn't even gotten a temp.
---
My clan mates literally gave me so much shit because I hated getting the goutweed so badly that I went and collected a gout tuber, planted it, and stayed online to watch the herb grow. JUST so that I didn't have to redo that room
---
NICEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Better have your phone within reach so you can jump on osrs mobile and remind him you still tied up
---
This video made me give up on RS; thanks for the awareness that i'm not doing rs right lol
---
Lol it's a video game. Your complaining about a "gambling problem" in a video game. What's the real issue here??
---
If you can’t negate teleport spells they teleport away and if you can’t effectively freeze them they run away. This is literally just a buff to solo players, teams will still use Ancients. I don’t see how this is overpowered.
---
I always said osrs was going to be the next grindr.
---
Nobody is commenting about the salad robes? Lmao
---
It's most likely legit, you shouldn't speak with such confidence without taking the time to look into it further.
---
See this post https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ct0va6/guide_how_to_spot_phishing_emails_and_other
---
It’s a real issue because people literally spend real money and even sell their houses or car to get rsgp that’s the problem
---
They can win..... the battles. But ultimately they can never win the war. Better technology, essentially limitless free manpower working to overcome every single countermeasure.
---
In many ways it is like puzzle makers. Takes vastly more time and effort to design and make, and far less effort and time and people to solve. I mean they already have banned nearly 2 million bots in the past year alone!
---
See this post, it's quite likely legit but it's worth checking.

Doing some maniacal monkey hunting, then wc and agility at prif.
---
The amoint of luck this nerd has is truly sickening. I mean yes he's a really good and dedicated player but his luck is legit ridiculous
---
Is the kodai wand that underwhelming? It has the highest magic attack of all the weapongs in the game by far (i guess an 8 point lead seems small when magic attack currently maxes at 28), but magic always felt odd with how magic attack stack works i guess
---
Noob whats a Pmod is it just like a moderator or something?
---
My eyes
---
Then get some help. Because that's crazy
---
Gets them out of my face at least. Sending a report ticket and muting them doesnt do jack
---
I really hate those cars. They're so ugly, and my English teacher in middle school had one, and he wore socks and sandals,
---
Definitely was going to say weed
---
Yeah but how are they going to detect the bots to put them in the jail? If they can't detect them to ban them then they can't detect them to put them in jail...
---
I'm gonna link you a comment I made for someone else earlier this week, 1 sec.
---
I just did it for Swan Song! I enjoyed it, fun quest. I imagine it would suck without teleports though.
---
Literally same.
---
gz
---
Just curious what relatively new means, considering getting a firecape around your level is kind of celebrated more as an challenge.   
---
My other question was, without previous knowledge and learned fear about the dreaded jad fight, did you find the mechanics in the fight itself relatively simple, due to a lack of fear?
---
Anything that involves an alternate way to runecrafting has my attention
---
Yeah you’re right. Just can’t seem the fact why people would say no to it. Why do you think people would say no though?
---
Just saw that and winced when he threw his headset. I shed a tear if I drop mine.
---
I don't have 85 hp so I'm using obby. 75 atk 76 str 75 def 78 hp 70 pray 76 range 76 mage. How long does an inv of absorbtions last on hard rumble?
---
For me crabs were the only way to keep training while totally afk with app in background while at work. Nmz required more attention and failing sessions would require more effort to restart over and over as opposed to just relogging on top of crabs. 130k crabs killed in 1.5 months and 99 ranged/str with little to no recollection of it :-) I used mith darts all the way to 99 ranged btw
---
\*bot tries to run\*
---
me: "Well well well, looks like you just activated your self-destruct script, here let me give you a countdown..."
---
How are you determining that the biggest problem in the game right now is bots? And that they are the worst of all time right now?
---
Thank you for the input. What’s interesting though is I just downloaded new anti virus software and did a scan that came back clean. Do you think it’s subtle enough to not show up on a scan?
---
I personally don't mind adding the ME2 requirement to Zulrah since SotE already has so many end game rewards. However, I'm concerned that it won't hinder the hand played famers nor the botters enough to justify it
---
I also just use obby. If you rock cake down every 2 min your 32 doses of overload will outlast your absorptions. Otherwise, re potting every 5 min they will run out about the same time. 
---
Total time I’m not 100% sure on but 2+ hrs is probable
---
Support ;)
---
If you’re using blowpipe you absolutely want a bgs, and you’ll even want to tele out and use a pool whenever you spec a 0 or a low number. If you’re using dhcb you don’t need bgs.
---
You need a stab item somewhere, if you have Ardy Cloak 4 use that instead of Fire Cape, otherwise replace the B Ring with Treasonous (i)
---
I highly suggest using members to lvl the account.
---
That’s a good idea. The password that I use for my OSRS account is just a bs password that I use for accounts/emails that I don’t care too much about. I used that website for the passwords to my bank account and PayPal and I was good. But the one for my OSRS account was used 304 time apparently. Yikes.
---
Its specifically the buyables.  Need a good money making method to afford the buyables, need the buyables to get the good money making method. 
---
And believe it or not, game progression has existed longer than SOTE. Locking zulrah behind SOTE doesn't even follow your "game progression" formula. Higher requirements-&gt; same loot -&gt; (roughly) same profit.
---
I think the ban takes more work and must be reviewed in more detain than what is suggested. It would basically be a bot designed to target other bots. I think they could get away with the jailing idea easier than full on bans
---
Get a job in real life then spend the money you made from it to buy gold. 
---
Even if you work a shitty $9/hour job you’d be technically making 12m gold per hour buying your gold from rpgstash.com. 
---
Considering you’re making 90k MAX per hour now it will take you 133 hours of clicking virtual objects to earn what you could in one single hour in the real world.
---
They don't review accounts like that, they're instantly banned. Also the issue is detecting the bots in the first place as blacklists are highly ineffective
---
How many times is this gonna be reposted
---
yeah
---
Can we confirm best barrows haul ever?
---
Ever seen anything like this done before? It just sounds so bad. Maybe that would be worthwhile if you didn't have to wait until you were 30% health to get a good amount of bonus, but you're probably just going to lose the fight anyways. I've never seen a weapon dragged through the mud more than Torag's hammers.  
---
Do you think the base set affect is good too? Its the run energy drain
---
I prefer listening to country jig at the herb patch in hosidius. I was pretty salty when it was fixed.

Auto log out on disconnect is extremely easy, ignore /u/oss_spy cause they clearly have no idea what they are talking about 
---
The problem isn't having your character log out on disconnect, thats the easy bit.  the problem with auto log out on disconnect though is finding the level of speed of disconnect so that it cant be abused.  If your character instantly disappeared whenever your connection dropped, you could just unplug your computer from the network in order to avoid lethal attacks.  On the other hand, what if the connection drops for like a second the comes back do you still want the character to be completely logged out?  
---
Logging out on disconnect is not the issue, it's finding the balance between speed of log out and quality of life that is
---
Why haven't we been doing more dbz memes??
---
an absolute clanger is putting this abortionary abomination lightly.
---
I went ahead and changed my passwords for both of my accounts. I'll report back if the problem persists. 
---

---
Gotta say, I wish Jagex Customer Support was a thing though, so I could maybe ask for an IP log for my account. Oh well.
---
Mathematically you'll always go even on 50:50 no matter what betting strategy you use.
---
Using the martingale (doubling every loss and resetting every win), the odds of you busting before you double your original roll are the exact same as whatever the odds are of you losing if you just chuck it all in one go. Martingale just makes your money last longer.
---
As long as you go into any betting scenario with an amount of money you're comfortable losing, you can have fun. Betting table minimums and playing basic strategy in blackjack can be hours of fun at a casino for very close to free.
---
Nope, this was one of the specific reasons why ahk was banned. It just trivializes a lot.
---
Before ahk was considered bannable, I used a 1t karamwban script that teleported my mouse to specific coordinates. I just had to hit the same 6 (or maybe 7 I don’t remember for sure) keys over and over each tick for 1m cooking xp per hour. It was still 1:1 if you consider moving a mouse to a specific coordinate to be 1 action, but it was very overpowered.
---
They’ve stated that the only time you can use any software such as ahk is for simple remapping (for example, mapping left click to your z key”. Windows mousekeys is the only way you can move your cursor without physically moving your mouse without breaking the rules.
---
And tells the worst stories
---
why do dart types affect the bp color and animations?
---
Congrats dude! What’s been your fave and least fave grinds so far? I’m about 1 and a half months into my acc and am nearly 1500. 
---
Further than I ever got as a kid lmao
---
They’re able to see where you acquire items/gold. If an amount worthy of selling appeared from nothing, I’d say they’d look into it
---
Boaty was fighting a friend in pvp, he jokingly told his friend that he couldnt smack him from high hp, the friend ags speced a 73.
---
How many hours?
---
I actually did right up until the weather vane repair. Pulled some bullshit making me talk to that guy like 9 times before the option popped up.
---
Each dart type requires a different type of loaded blowpipe to be coded. 
---
I never meant that they had different animations, my bad.
---
But I do know the basic details? I've been using the same passwords all my life, I have the billing address for the account, they could easily check where it has been logged in from over the years. The appeal is being denied on the basis that my recovery answers are wrong and I need more information regarding the membership payments. Unreasonable to expect me to remember what my favourite food was as a 12 year old when I'm now 26. And as for the the payment details, my own mother wouldn't even remember the credit card details to a bank she was with 14 years ago. If I was trying to recover an account that isn't mine I don't think I'd waste my time going after a level 3 with tutorial island items in the bank mate. Like I said I have never even lost access to the account so your point isn't even valid. I'm just trying to change the email as I don't have access to the email that is used for recovery.
---
No ardy cape 4, so treasonous ring is better with fire cape? Darock legs got me a 6 kill trip right away. But its hard to know when my antifire is up on mobile
---
I got my dragon defender in under 10 cyclops kills. 1/1 drop rate confirmed.
---
wait did they announce how many points you can cap on? Im assuming 1pt is 1damage. Also yeah, you are right. I did my math wrong, it would be 60% less loot in a 10 man without factoring in the cap. and would be 190/400 = 47.5% of the loot in a 10man. (52.5% less)
---
They're the Steven bots, they run around on world 1 and respond to commands. You can make them spam trade people, follow, cut trees etc and yes they repeat what people say
---
See, that's what I'm talking about xD
---
Thanks! 1500 is nothing to sneeze at, keep at it :)
---
My favourite skills are Slayer and Farming; Agility and Fishing are quite grindy but I’m pretty happy with most of the methods I have to skill with now. For boring stuff like Agility I play some poker online while I run laps, keeps it entertaining.
---
I feel like you’re making fun of a straw man when a lot of ideas proposed are shit and the ones voted no on are generally good choices for no votes
---
I wasn't playing anywhere near efficiently, but I would ballpark it at ~550 hours
---
What's this sanity you speak of?
---
Exactly what I said you don't know the details of the account so why do you think an employee would risk there job to give you that? You said it yourself you dont know the information but yet you expect a jagex employee to just decide yeah you seem like a cool guy let me just do this for you even though you don't actually know the information.
---
I like this idea, I haven't even done those quests yet but I would be interested in this if it was added.
---
what if i told you that you were wrong
---
Would oak larders + dungeon doors or mounted myth’s cape be cheaper for the 84 con grind?
---
The only way to rc blood runes is zeah runecrafting
---
That's not even a little bit what I'm saying, no. I'm saying that people who bot their combat stats and other skills do not have a significant impact on the economy; it's the ones that specifically bot one thing ad nauseam until they get caught that impact prices and whatnot. If you fish 10k swordies, cut 10k magics, craft 10k nats and and trap 10k grenwalls you aren't gonna affect the prices of any of those things by much if at all. But if you fish 1m swordies, you're going to single-handedly have a significant impact on their price.
---
My absorption’s don’t last long on hard rumble. I’m in full Obby with sub 70 stats. So instead of those, I use prayer pots and super combats. My inv lasts around 2.5-3 hours averaging 140k an hour points with 7 bosses.
---
Then I apologise for accusing you of epic failing. 
---
Or
---
You're trying to bamboozle me into thinking I'm wrong
---
Move the ore
---
It is a tradition to keep your first cape untrimmed
---
What?
---
Potentially cool idea, but 100% no to restricting it to slayer tasks. Random buffs to the most op/bloated skill are not good imo. If it has creative uses (that don't help bots) that's a good thing.
---
yes... yes they are.
---
Something like this wouldn’t slow down too much. People will just make a new alt so they can get back to staking. People have to help themselves first.
---
😂😭😂
---
I hate to break it to you, but people can currently bot each and every last one of the skills in the game.
---
I had stumbled upon this a few times but it seemed as an account recovery. I have submitted an appeal. Thanks.
---
Are you missing the part where I'm telling you I've had access to the account since 2007 and still do? I'm logged into it right now... I can guarantee you I'm not the only person who doesn't remember recovery questions they set over a decade ago.
---
I remember this idea I was into it but only for cosmetic purposes
---
Yeah, I learned nothing on my way to max combat, gear, and inferno cape. Damn shame really.
---
If only I spent more time reading your comments I would know the mysteries of supply and demand, game mechanics, and their interconnectedness.
---
You really are a sage before your time.
---
It doesn’t matter how quickly you switch your gear, it’s inefficient to use on 99% of tasks. Pray flick or teleport to your house and run back. Most tasks are within 20 seconds of a teleport.
---
I mean, Arceus has resurrection magic, right?
---
...why?
---
Picking up 50 bones per trip where otherwise noone ever would bother doing? What would that break exactly?
---
Yes I mean pick up all the ore, move like 5 clicks and drop it so the list of items is decreased
---
Thanks for the reply, slipped my mind to use salve. That seems like a pretty doable set up
---
I used to play RuneScape 3.
---
I used to play Castle wars and thought I was good.
---
I would take dfs on ranged tasks to flex the dfs even though it has negative range bonus.
---
I would pick flax in Camelot and run to the spinning machine.
---
Instead of picking flax at the tree gnome stronghold
---
And spinning at lumby.
---
I used to train range in the wildy at fire Giants
---

---
Where's the sad react
---
Serp will still be useful for a few niche scenarios. 100% venom when successful hit for Mystics in CM before trapping, venoming GWD minions (basically Sara), Vork if max doesn’t change, wilderness tank helm, ToB purples.
---
Google is good too
---
Oh shit, thanks
---
that has nothing to do with barrows. barrows doesn't even offer a chance at the RDT like the other comment says
---
Whilst I agree with you that botting is OSRS's largest problem, I am also cautious of how Jagex's hand may get forced to attempt to fix it. I remember when they yoinked the Free Trade and Wilderness to attempt to combat bots. I'd hate to see anything that drastic happen again.
---
The problem with that is it's not very hard to program the bot to just complete the captcha. Please lookup RuneScape classic sleeping bags if you want to be more convinced of this.
---
I think the word quit implies that you don't start again. 
---
So no, you didn't quit when eoc came to fruition. You simply took a long break until osrs release.
---
Oh, wrong sub.  You gonna burn for this one.  People in this community are cold blooded...  delete and hide.
---
Do me a favor and just ask yourself if it was really necessary to come back to this 24 hours later simply to respond with a shitty attempt at making me feel bad about myself.
---
hey thanks for linking them bud
---
Thanks for advice I didn't think of that, do blood worms and crypt rats count as undead too?
---
I'd rather get cavities drilled then do that
---
Let this be a lesson to you, and I hope you're able to get through this. Be glad you only lost gold coins in a mideval point and click game, not your rent payment.
---
Lmfao I definitely need to work out, I got this tattoo a few years ago and realized the symbol was the same as the Strength symbol in-game and decided to meme it
---
That’s the game man, I like getting lost in the game like that sometimes. But I love your reference
---
Thanks for the advice, does salve work on anything else besides the skeletons?
---
Maybe just get past 4th grade and don't name your account some stupid shit like that?
---
And dharok’s axe
---
Snatch\*
---
When fighting cerb, do you people usually just camp mage pray and tank the range/melee hit (not the arrrooo, just the  random mage-range-melee attack that always follows this order) or should I learn to watch his attacks and try to pray against them? 
---
I find sometimes the mage and range hit will almost stack up together in a succession so it's hard to pray against.
---
I usually carry 500 to 1000
---
What’s goin on guys boaty herBWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW
---
Imagine taking a name serious in an online game lol
---
Almost to 98 right now using mlm as well. Should be done any day now..............
---
I would’ve done the same thing in his situation, &gt;!I thought he was gonna do it and literally gasped when he died!&lt;, I can only imagine the hours of work that went into that
---
I love all RS music but goddamn country jig is hell, whenever it kicks in I just turn off music, too damn loud and it feels like it's a 5 seconds song on an infinite loop
---
Even the Image captchas and Audio captchas have bypasses, or if not, they pay people from other countries $1 or $2 per thousand captchas.
---
Kitty!!!!
---
BIG thank you for F2p Snare  !!!!! so much fun already
---
That's pretty cool. Congrats.(:
---
well if someone is running a bot they don't have to actually render the UI
---
They don’t eat and break when you tb them. They run to 20 wildy and try to teleport and then just stand there when they can’t
---
Because it was easy to program a bot to go through the event..
---
Hey OP; exhibit A.
---
At a guess it would halve your xp rates from using larders, more than that for dungeon doors
---
Definitely worth using a butler
---
Hitpoints.
---
you'd think, noobie
---
The prices gaps would just get larger. It would mostly affect people who instant sell and instant buy.
---
This would be an in-game interface so they'd also be leveling the account, so they wouldn't be a bot.
---
Idk why you got the inspiration to sing this as all star by smash mouth but now all I can think about is all star by smash mouth

---
When bots reply to me online it makes me want to kill myself.
---
Cool. Now go lift a weight
---
The YouTube channel "extra credits" has some excellent videos on MMO economics.
---
Bonds are also neat because they are sort of an in-game tax on non-paying player to paying players.
---
Would devalue wildy elite diary
---
Canon for range, trident (no base/splash exp) for magic. That alone without bosses will get untrimmed.
---
Looks like a black panther tattoo
---

No everyone does. Lul.

I have untrimmed thieving. Its nice.

Am i just blind or does osrs bis .com not show msb on ranged? i went through every 2h and i cant find it? 
---
leads me to believe i have it set up wrong
---
Fletching or cooking
---
tbh revert zulrahs drop table and make it locked behind sote. I dont remember it being any more profitable than vork is right now so i see no issue here. Vork isnt botted to shit is it/?
---
You look like that weird bird lady from the park in Home Alone 2
---
&gt; Doing others fire cape is definitely something they take action against.
---
Nope, they start taking action if you don't get inferno yourself. They don't care at all about some nmz or a fire cape.
---
Why not hosidious?

Buddy of mine is a 1 def pure, going for all wildy pets, has just about 6k scorpia kc, no pet. You blessed

It sort of looks like a Tibetan revolutionary symbol   also just feels racist

If you think sote is an endgame quest i have news for you

Nice! I also got one yesterday. 2kc, exchange the cape. First pet ❤

---
No sorry. And after you get acc back if you do. Don't put it into the same email. Make completly different email, gmail is great, cause you can get 2fa into email too. And use different passwords for both acc and mail.
---
Ah I never heard of YouTube Vanced. You can do the same thing with picture in picture with any website like Netflix and 123movies

I'm game for this, it's not a new method, just a small bonus chunk of xp you can get as a semi rare drop.

---
Right, left that out in this post. I mentioned on my other post, I was locked out of my last account because of the authenticator and I didn’t have access to my email from 2006 to remove authenticator! Which caused me to create this new account with new email, didn’t put an authenticator to be safe and somehow the email got changed without even asking me or sending anything to my actual email the account is linked to. My password is still the same though, when I log into account info only my email has been changed.
---
[Like this](https://i.imgur.com/y6zWOaz.jpg)
---
Yes i think i remember someone getting 4 barrows items.
---
So does it count in the collection log then? And why are ironmen entitled, for all they care they can just go with buget gear in wildy and even if they bring it,  what are the chances of you finding one and getting the kill.
---
People have had 5 item chests before
---
No worries man, I figured my best bet was just to ask the community! I’m hoping I get it back, I don’t know if I would restart again. I may just throw in the towel on this one, unfortunately.
---
Use authy, it has cloud sync and a desktop app, which can be set up with a separate masterpassword
---
Well if you get it back, and don't want to play with this acc, just liquidify the bank and buy bonds to other acc. Like start an ironman or something.
---
Damn! Downloading it now, just for the off chance I get this account back! 🤞🏼

There's a lot more they can do to combat botting than simply detecting stuff on clients or outright banning suspicious accounts.
---
It would take plenty of effort to create such a system, but considering this game is mainly serverside [**I brainstormed this idea**](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d18kbq/actual_ideas_for_fighting_bots_that_arent_just/?) **for ACTUALLY fighting bots.**
---
Banning suspicious accounts before they trade with mules stops you from getting very valuable information on which players are mules/ which accounts are its "brethren" bots. If an account is going to be perma'd *anyway* why not let them walk around the game without affecting anything, but being a ticking time bomb for those it interacts with?
---
Haha I was just talking about that this evening, too! My only hangup is I JUST got my first 99 again for that account on Monday lol. Which I get it, I’m not the first one or the last to get a 99, but it’s not the easiest motivator to restart completely after just knocking one out 😂
---
If you’re looking for max afk, it’s better to skip absorbs and rely on ppots and pray melee, and use overloads. If you don’t constantly rock cake/flick restore every minute, you’ll regain hp and it will shred your absorbs.  I’ve noticed even getting up to 3 or 4 hp just drains absorbs super quick.  Pray melee is set and forget until you need to re-pot.
---
this is a very badly thought through idea.
---
the reqs for sote are agility, construction, herblore, farming, hunter, mining, smithing and woodcutting. with the exception of farming which would take *some* time, these are all also botable if you have to gold for them (and since these are botters anyway they can just rwt it), and so youre spreading the problem out rather than solving it.
---
zulrah also really isnt a super complex boss. most new players use a map of the phases, so the skill comes from switches. zulrah is a boss that teaches you to switch effectively at a relatively low level, hence why its only locked behind regicide, despite being incredibly profitable for both ironmen and normal players.
---
the zulrah bots need a solution, but this isnt it.
---
Or hes an ironman..

Not 4-6m that's too much

Nice you got an opinion. Those are rate to come by on 2007scape. Great

There's about 7 spelling mistakes (entertainmenting, entellegence etc.) and "the currency of the situation" although not misspelled is a misuse of the word currency.
---
Thank you!
---
They should make bot detection more subtle, instead of outright banning bots and alerting the bot makers to create more accounts, they should make it so bots can no longer trade or use the ge, effectively wasting the hours of the bots run-time slowing their efficiency/profit.
---
then they'd have to perm ban about 50% of the playerbase, sad but true, will never happen.
---
Thanks for the acount
---
But does it matter if a few people hate you? They broke the rules, they are in the wrong, i dont think i would care about those people if it were my job

cost me like 35m with elite void and rigour
---
Whats your method
---
Why have you made the same post twice?
---
Gold is simple enough and probably cheapest
---
I think they should just trace the gold better. If theres a 95% chance that you will get perma banned for RWT at some point then the market for it will die.
---
Neither the RoW nor mystic boots do anything for you. You should swap for your BiS range boots/archers ring. Explorers if you don't have an archers.
---
Happy for it to be cosmetic. Hydra doesn't really need a tail buff to make it worth doing. Claw is and likely will be very expensive for a while. Ring is the sustainable unique. And it's regular drops are solid as is.
---
Upgrade the legs to something with more defence. When you can sell the hasta &amp; bandos to buy a lance do that.

Remember back in actual 2007 when this happened? The best, and only way to truly end hacking/scamming/goldfarming bots/phishing/gambling, and everything else done in the name of RWTing, is to remove free trade.

Otherwise, it's just a constant losing battle that's been going on for decades.

No idea where people pull 80m figures. I just did 84-99 range in mm2 tunnels a week ago. Used gray chins, elite void, anguish, eagle eye. Cost me probably 35m-ish in gray chins, pray pots were free and range pots are dirt cheap. Definitely worth it.
---
I think a big reason people just pay for it is because sometimes you just get a really bad team or just toxic people overall. But i did the barbarian assault for the har handarin diary and it was not nearly as bad as i thought.

---
Would ruin my hill giant only ironman
---
&gt; How would 'not consuming' resources work? Woudn't mining a rock and the resource not disappearing tip a bot off? Woodcutting a tree?
---
Client side it will appear as it's been used, but to everyone else nothing was consumed.
---
This is probably extremely difficult to implement but for things like shops there's stuff in place like that for ironmen already.
---
&gt;Also how would poisioned goldd work? Woudn't it be ruined by adding it to existing cash pile and finding out that it doesn't stack?
---
Ideally all gold on that account is "poisoned"- it's moreso a way to colloquially say "this account is permabanned, but the gold that moves around with it is monitored/ vanished once it gets too far"
---
Watch Lord Shayne's defender guide on youtube. Makes it really easy because you just start the wave the same way every time and then chill by the trap. If done right you'll finish before everyone else.
---
That’s one way to never quit the game
---
You're such a Chad gosh
---
I could definitely use an aesthetic change to the place, but part of the reason the KBD lair was chosen was that it has no safespots. 
---
Angled corners like that can easily trap enemies that are 3x3 or larger, and allow you to safespot 2x2 or larger with a bit of effort.
---
Excuse me sir.. do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour?

You can gamble on RuneScape without ever spending money, other than membership, therefore it's not real gambling. If you actually buy gold and bet it on Runescape then somethings wrong.

Clanwars portal, ardy cloak with proselyte, actually grinding construction/herblore instead of 100s of barrows chests btw

btw
---
is your picture for ants?
---
you'd be surprised how fast you can do 900 mediums. Also kinda the whole point of making money with big drops is that sometimes you get unlucky and there will be ''faster'' consistent methods, but on average theyre still better.

it is real gambling
---
i have no clue why you are trying to deny it so hard, doesnt make any sense
---
Just curious- is the advert they want to put in something runelite could "fix" and restore the old one or is that outside the scope of the program?
---
Yeah it's a pretty long grind for this one, you'd be here for a while. 
---
Glad you enjoyed BA though!
---
Agility, thieving and hunter are the 3 for me. At least hunter you can do bird houses but once I'm 80 it's never being touched again.
---
94-99 cost me 10m with elite void and red chins. Don’t chin unless you have bis gear for chinning. If you don’t have it you’re gonna waste money chinning.
---
Suicidal would be a better descriptor of questing IMO

Do you even mine bruh?
---
I’m so excited for you! I wish I could turn back the clock and be in your shoes. Being a member changes the game; there are so many new things to try and it can be overwhelming. Given that you’re a new player, my advice would be to not worry to much about setting specific goals or working on maximising “efficiency” as a lot of veterans will suggest. Just take your time - explore the map, dip in to some new skills and try out some quests. You’ll soon figure out what your preferences are. No two player’s experiences are exactly the same. Embrace that. Good luck!

---
Listen to the one that plays during the Skotizo fight; it's an abomination.
---
Yes, but an alternative is to use any number of awesome boss arenas, after completing the quests, or just themed areas after the original with safe spots removed.
---
Boss Areas such as:
---
1. Ver Sinhaza from A Taste of Hope
---
2. Elvarg's Liar from Dragon Slayer
---
3. Ungael (as well as Vorkath) from DragonSlayer II
---
4. The Burned Fleet from DragonSlayer II
---
5. The Culinaromancer Dimension from RFD
---
6. Jungle Demon Arena from Monkey Madness
---
7. Throne Room under Uzer from Shadow of the Storm
---
8. Glod's Cloud from Grim Tales
---
9. The Fight Arena from Fight Arena
---
10. Morytania themed Graveyard from Desert Trease
---
11. Dark Wizard Stone Circle from Demon Slayer. (Minor rework with flatten the stone circle into walkable rubble instead of a hole after it was broken by Delrith)
---
There are lots of interesting places we could use over generic cave.
---
Bounce areas; now some bosses just aren't the same with their specific mechanics, looking at you Treus Dayth. It might be fun if similar to the Myth Guilds ability to refight the exact boss from Dragon Slayer II we could work something else out with other similar bosses. For instances The haunted mine with all the haunted traps, because that is a true nightmare.
---
Thank You, will try that!
---
Yeah I know... I was only playing for about 3 months and I was really enjoying it. 
---
Thank you anyway for your response!
---
I've also used it at nmz for 85 mage lol, but only with "mouse mode", did you use the "tap mode" cuz i heard I can get banned if I use the tap mode, so I'm looking for someone that used "tap mode" or at least a moderator to say it to me I can use also the "tap mode", or I'll just stick with mouse mode and that's it :)
---
Ok, why don't they just stop being plebs though? This suggestion is entirely irrelevant to them, they probably wouldn't know that it existed.
---
To add to this: they put it on top of a cow spawn and couldn't remove it. It's pretty low quality work for something that everyone uses.
---
It's always nice when the run pays off those ppot doses :•)
---
decent but make the blask shorter
---
Sounds like the U.S.
---
Everybody's underemployed yet overworked.
---
Deff stop at 96 (or 97, idr which is the last max hit gained). You will get the remainder from bossing, raids, etc. It will save you a few mil on chins.
---
No I was more implying an altar.
---
I would hope it's an alt lol. Something he can do while he mains something else.
---
Say no to more ezscape

I got them on my first medium clue on my HC (I’ll alch myself don’t worry) but I got the nerd shakes like I haven’t gotten since I beat jad in like 2010. I can’t imagine the hype when you get yours. GL! Clue #457 is it

Yeah, you could probs imagine his pain more than anyone lol, I done mlm till 80 and hated every minute
---
Hahah 31
---
Nope. Hard, Elite and Master. Each higher tier just gives access to another tier of 3rd age. So elite has hard and elite 3rd age, master has both those and its own table.
---
I can guarantee plebs on reddit that think it’s a good method to pick up your own drag bones will know this item exists
---
Is it only some people who have this new login? Because I've still got the normal old one
---
&gt; Targeting the players for minor infractions never ever ends well. Ever.
---
This isn't a "minor infraction". People buying gold is causing accounts to get hacked, it's causing tens of thousands of bots, rampant scamming and gambling. It causes people to have their accounts stolen, used for botting, and permanently banned. This "minor infraction" is fucking the game.
---
&gt; People just quit.
---
If you can't manage to play the game without cheating, you should not be playing the game. That is literally the entire point of banning people.
---
&gt;  More people buy gold than you think.
---
No lol, I think lots of people buy gold. Because there are no real consequences to doing so. Why wouldn't they do it? What's deterring them? Nothing. That's why loads of people buy gold. But the bigger the deterrence, the less likely they'll take the risk. The more likely they'll just buy bonds, because don't forget, there's already a legitimate way to buy gold that doesn't contribute to all those massive negatives.
---
&gt; It's a slippery slope
---
That phrase is such a fantastically giant pile of flaming bullshit lmao. Doing *something* is not a "slippery slope" to everything else. You're implying that we should never punish anyone for anything, because it might lead to doing worse things. Bullshit. So *where does it stop*?  Right there. Real simple
---
&gt; Jagex literally did the best they could with removing free trade. If your idea would have been better
---
My idea is not better than removing free trade. Free trade all but stopped gold farming bots, hacking, scamming, gambling, and all those other problems RWTing caused. It also had the effect of really pissing people off because it interfered with the gameplay of those people who were not breaking the rules.
---
Removing free trade is the only way to fully stop RWTing, but Jagex decided the negatives outweigh the positives.
---
&gt; do you really think Jagex and every other game developer has never had this idea?
---
Other game developers do punish people who buy gold. Real simple.
---
&gt; Punishing large groups of people for menial problems never solved anything
---
As we've already discussed, this is FAR from a "menial problem". Punishing people for breaking rules has absolutely solved problem lol. Just look at what RSC turned into when they stopped punishing anyone for breaking rules. The entire community devolved into almost nothing but bots. But when they ban botters on the live game, less people bot. Really simple. You start banning people for RWTing, less people will RWT.
---
&gt; Especially when the source of them problem isn't those people it's a small group of goldsellers 
---
No, the source is the demand. Goldsellers don't sell gold if the demand doesn't exist. The source of the problem, the cause of the problem is the buyer. The problem, is the seller. Demand comes first, then supply starts popping up to fill that demand.
---
My last skill until base 90s is mining. So instead I'm killing vorkath
---
alright cheers
---
I completly forgot about Vasa crystals, thanks for the reply
---
man i got herbi on 3616 and 4212..... this hurts to look at
---
Because OSRS was dead and Jagex thought allowing people to afk power level to max combat or make their pk build faster would keep people playing the game or bring them back.
---
Making dream mentor/lunar diplomacy required makes it less accessable for people to afk to max.
---
NMZ is a huge pile of early OSRS desperation content that should have been fixed and removed years ago. Herb boxes and NMZ purchased imbues have no reason to exist and Jagex is really dragging their feet on it.
---
The new LOS is a targeting system. It would work for players and NPCs. The beta testing is pvp only because it will currently only be implemented in pvp to prevent one way safespotting.
---
It could scale to the variety though, e.g. 28 normal bones, 14 big bones, 7 dragon bones and comparable
---
Our characters nearly drown when we fall off a log into 2 ft of water, do you expect us to swim?
---
It's a huge flex, it's very rarely traded, and it's not a terrible weapon for some slayer tasks
---
Why though
---
Bump
---
If you got time, can you read this and tell me what you think about it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d1amcx/suggestion\_clanteam\_battleroyale\_and\_tournament/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d1amcx/suggestion_clanteam_battleroyale_and_tournament/)
---
It's right there.
---
How
---
Now that’s funny.
---
haha he said the funny number guys!
---
some1 still cant count past 3 even after that long learning...
---
What **I** personally did was got the 50 kc on vorkath for the head then i backtracked and finish mm2 for demonic gorillas and did them on a slayer task once i got black demons. That funded the way to rigour, then i was getting way quicker kills and 1-2 vorkath kill trips with 84 range. Then i stuck with it until i got enough cash to fund my house for the pool. **Then** i stuck with vorkath until the DHCB. That thing is a game changer and is worth selling your whole bank for (if you have rigour). I used that thing until i got my gear fully upgraded (archer's ring (e), skeletal vissy, pegs) then i just stopped after that, i had enough money to fund my melee gear and start slayer and only go back when i have a blue dragons task.
---
The most important thing is to not burn out. Its fun at first but once you get 200 blue dragon kills back to back it gets repetitive.
---
I tried it once, explained that I'd never played BA before, they were cool with it, then made fun of me the whole game and kicked me :(
---
Your first point has already been addressed, as of a day or two ago.
---
That would fuck up my iron man but why not I did sote on my main
---
Imo I don't think SotE have that high reqs, if anyone elite void has too low reqs for something so useful and free.
---
It wouldn't affect anything here, and it would be weird to have LOS function differently in NMZ as opposed to anything else. 
---
To be clear, here's the issue: With a 3x3 or larger monster that attacks with melee, lure it to the north wall, run 2 squares south, then run west. Its northwest corner will get stuck and you are free to range it.
---
NICE MUTAGEN TRAVIS
---
Even the 6 years lines up
---
So I have a mid game ironmeme question. Specifically HCIM (for now).
---
On a scale of slightly subpar to incredibly silly, how bad would it be to cannon Fally guards for medium clues?
---
I really can not imagine something that I would rather do less than more puro-puro. And cannonballs on mobile do not seem overly awful.
---
I would recommend doing quests, mainly those with bigger xp rewards or significant unlocks.
---
 Smaller list:
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fight\_Arena](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fight_Arena) Free attack and thieving xp
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tree\_Gnome\_Village](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tree_Gnome_Village) Free attack xp, Spirit tree transportation, also requirement for Monkey Madness 2
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The\_Tourist\_Trap](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Tourist_Trap) The reward is best used on agility
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Waterfall\_Quest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Waterfall_Quest) Free strenght and attack xp
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fairytale\_I\_-\_Growing\_Pains](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fairytale_I_-_Growing_Pains)  Do the required quests to start this quest, After you finish it start Fairytale p2 and then you will be able to use the Fairy Ring transportation. Rewards farming xp, Item which when is equiped lets you get 10% more harvest from your farming patches (Herbs, Fruit trees, Allotment patches etc.)
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Druidic\_Ritual](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Druidic_Ritual)  Druidic ritual unlocks Herblore skill and allows you to do more quests.
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The\_Grand\_Tree](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Grand_Tree) Free attack, agility and magic xp (Boss is safespottable so just shot it till it dies) 
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Elemental\_Workshop\_I](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Elemental_Workshop_I)  Free Smithing and Crafting xp from both parts.
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The\_Dig\_Site](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Dig_Site)  After doing Druidic ritual and training Herblore till lvl 10, Tourist trap (Enough agility xp for this quest). And then Fight arena for some starting thieveing xp, Then traing it to lvl 25. This quest will unlock you 1. Abillity to do the Bone Voyage quest (Unlocks fossil island for bird houses) 2. For Medium Varrock Diary. 3. Free mining and herblore xp. 4. Also the abillity to obtain Dig site pendant (Useful for bird houses later) ( [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock\_Museum#Specimen\_Cleaning](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock_Museum#Specimen_Cleaning) )
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bone\_Voyage](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bone_Voyage)  This quest unlocks you a easy way to get passive hunter xp and money. (You need to do Dig site before you can do this one) To get enough "Kudos"  
---
 ([https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kudos](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kudos))  I would recommend doing: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Natural\_history\_quiz](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Natural_history_quiz) (Gives enough xp to get Slayer and Hunter to lvl 9) [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock\_Museum#Specimen\_Cleaning](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock_Museum#Specimen_Cleaning) 
---
Then some quests that give Kudos when turned in one of the NPC's in the museum. (F2P are Demon slayer, Rune Mysteries and Shield of Arrav which also gives a 1k xp lamp for a skill over lvl 20) Now you just need to do 2 p2p ones I would recommend doing The Grand tree (gives good rewards) and Preist in peril (Its easy and fast, Also unlocks Morytania)
---
After doing Fairytale I, You should start doing tree runs. After getting to lvl 26 start doing herb runs with Harralander and limpwurt roots (Use Ultracompost on herbs! and Supercompost on Limpwurt) At lvl 31 you could start planting strawberries, its free xp and smaller profit.
---
And after you did Bone Voyage and unlocked the Fossil island you can start doing Bird houses. 
---
Since you are lvl 9 by Doing the Quiz you can use the normal birdhouse.
---
 The way you do them is , you 1. Make the birdhouses and put them in their spot. 2. You put some seed in them (hops are the cheapest way to fill them so buy Barley seeds 4 gp each.) They take 10 seeds per one birdhouse. 3. Wait a hour before comming back to get your xp and loot. 4. Repeat (Also look out for when you can use a better birdhouse (Oak at lvl 15 etc.)                                                                                                                   ([https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bird\_house\_trapping](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bird_house_trapping)).Before you start doing Bird houses, You should unlock [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mycelium\_Transportation\_System](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mycelium_Transportation_System) (Unlock every single one other than the "Sticky Swamp" one.) 
---
Then using Digsite pendant which you get by enchanting a ruby necklace (After you found a clean necklace while cleaning Specimen in the Varrock Museum.) You can teleport to one Transportation Mushroom and set up the bird houses around the island.   ([https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Digsite\_pendant#(5)](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Digsite_pendant#(5)))
---
Other than that I would recommend working towards doing barrows so, Underground pass for ibans staff  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Underground\_Pass](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Underground_Pass)  Level 50 range for magic shortbow with rune arrows. And level up your prayer to atleast 41. Wear tank gear And mage all of them other than Ahrim, which you use the Magic shortbow on. If you run out of player/food you should bank at castle wars using Duel ring, restore your stats in the portal and bank there for more supplies, Then just teleport back using a barrows teleport tab.
---
Another thing is that NMZ (Nightmare zone) is great for training melee stats, You get points which you can turn in for Herb boxes (Free money/herblore xp) and also special potions which you use inside the minigame.
---
Now, You should also aim to complete the required quests/skills for Varrock easy and medium diaries. It allows you to buy discounted battlestaves daily and then sell them on the GE for profit. Also allows you to teleport directly to the GE with Varrock teleport
---
If you need help with anything just message me and I will try to help you out :)
---
Boting scripts existed back then but virtually no one new how to use them or find them so I really doubt that many people were botting then
---
I would rather kill the snake

im saying its too easy

If you weren't being an asshole as well as an idiot in the comment, I might let it slide trying to delete it before I could respond. But I'm not going to do that:
---
&gt; Alright fair I misread the title. But 2 x 4 =/= 182
---
&gt; Which is the total. Temp was 500 but you know. Numbers are hard, projection, ect.
---
&gt; Thanks again for more fallacy. You got proved wrong, called stupid, and now all you can do is project.
---
&gt; Take care buddy.
---
And here was my response to that comment:
---
&gt; &gt; What are you trying to say? How are you not understanding how graphs work? [Perm bans: Total: 182,076](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360001564458-29th-April-5th-May-Player-Support-Stats). Temp bans: Total: 2,061. It literally states those numbers. I don't know what math you're trying to do here, it literally tells you the number of bans in 1 week.
---
------------------------------------------
---
&gt;  got proved wrong several time
---
You repeating yourself is not proof. You screaming insults if not proof of anything. You misunderstanding basic concepts does not make me wrong.
---
Just curious, but how do pkers using nmz to train their stats effect you in the slightest? Why is it good they wouldn't be able to do it anymore?
---
Yea let's remove all the fun stuff that requires effort and just have "click the monster to kill it". Oh, people are having *fun* soloing ToB? Nah, make it so they can't. Really, why?
---
How sad is your life that you caught and read that in the 10 seconds it was up.
---
That is truly sad. Find a fucking hobby. Or get a job NEET
---
The ol' switcheroo
---
Man that is kind of rude.
---
Barrows/ skotizo/boss slayer
---
Better idea: remove nmz entirely.  Instead of making imbues a one hour chore you have to do for your items, just make it a gp fee you pay.  No one doesn't *not* imbue their items, and it would create a gold sink.
---
Yeah I agree and I will borrow your comment.
---
It says her account was suspended. Is that something she does or is it like a ban?
---
I thought he dced and lost status a few weeks ago?
---
whip that trains str and not shared and attack or defensive please.
---
I am talking about 1 to 99 slayer giving you perhaps 60 to 70 runecrafting
---
2455 total level. pepega
---
This is exactly what I did when I got my 99 strength a couple weeks ago :/
---
That would be very interesting! Would be cool for the lore.
---
She deleted them then made her tweets protected
---
Because fat people are disgusting and no one wants to look at that
---
&gt; worse than zeah RC
---
Surely you’re trolling on this one, should we really train the skill the same way from level 23-99 (nonprofit) or the same way at the ZMI altar with no changes in ways? What other skills don’t gain alternatives that are mechanically different in the later levels?
---
Yea one guy was saying something like that. Would be cool.
---
The only ba services i found asked 40m for a torso. Passed.
---
What I'm proposing is a simple reskin to the Dream World arena from Dream Mentor. Though I think NMZ could use other changes, I'd just like to see this aesthetic change as a first step from Jagex.
---
What's you block list? That's like 80 tasks. Did you start with the slayer cape?
---
the fastest way i think is to kill lava dragons while wearing an imbued ring of wealth
---
very helpful \^
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/BadGalCallie
---
Idk how Twitter works honestly.
---
3rd party clients are a much bigger issue imo
---
... are you burying bones lmfao?
---
2 tails, what a bummer. I'd love to check out my loot for those. Im still yet to get a tail but was very lucky with the other shit.
---
You can't do Dream Mentor on a pure because Fremmenik trials gives a def XP reward
---
All you really need is a blowpipe and it will average to at least a mil over time
---
Vorkath is not worth doing with bp without bgs. Get a bgs, grind vork till you have 100m, sell bgs, buy dhcb and/or rigor get elite void as soon as you can stand doing that much pc. After that ward&gt;pegs but 83 construction is always worth it and useful for other things so really it depends on what you want to spend your time on.
---
Lol literally everyone who’s ever discussed raids 3 has suggested and assumed it will be in the desert and the main reward will be lag considering raids 1 and 2 gave ranged and melee
---
You got blessed by the man, the legend, the myth, the absolute God Rolav! Damn I miss him.
---
Using them? Making an eternal one takes some of that away.
---
It's a swamp lettuce meme
---
What item is that? Genuinely curious.
---
Gambling with time. Another reason why time = money
---
I'm a few thousand kills in with no dragon thrown axes or knives
---
Move Nightmare Zone to the Recycling Bin
---
Yeah using them. You don't need any more than that. Glories don't even have a sink and they have an eternal version
---
Dumb nonsense is what you're talking about
---
These are fun, almost like a daily crossword kind of deal
---
Do you post the script anywhere? If not shoot me a message, would be happy to pay you for it
---
I’ve been at it for 3 days and still haven’t got the barrows one.
---
This guy Chapelles.
---
I'll admit, my content is not as good as 13 reasons why.
---
"Been badly suicidal in the past and needed the  perfect place to ensure death, mine is a cliff edge a few miles from  where I live but luckily didn’t have the balls to go through with it at  the time"  
---
From a recent post of yours...lol.
---
Oh lol. My mistake 
---
Judging from his lowish slayer level, he probably used Library RC because he doesn't have the slayer level to farm Zulrah with a Trident  and probably hasn't had enough Wyrm/Kurask/Garg tasks yet.
---
So the swampletics pet?
---
Smarter than you, obviously. No one who thinks jebrim is cool has any amount of usable brain matter.
---
Fire cape is untradable though so it's not like you would sell it to afford a rapier.
---
Mummy's purse confirmed.
---
I feel like I'm really out of place here but I think the attachment is unnecessary. Slayer is already a bloated skill and we dont need more attachments for an item that's already at alch price and another helm thats already tied to the price of scales. Isles gave us the BiS helm straight up so I kinda wish Exiles would've too.
---
Only lower level accounts pk in the lower levels of the Wilderness, anyone higher level could just run away if you were using Standard first.
---
Bp on task dcb if you want to make more gp
---
Now thats a wholesome story for the ages. Gz
---
A glory is the absolute cheapest fast access to a bank with dragonstone jewellery scrolls. Each charge is a couple GP and it saves 10 seconds over Zanaris only with the salve graveyard teleport.
---
I can't afford to train with gold bars 50-70 so I'm doing mithril. Coal bag needed.
---
I can't skip the task because I have no points. Even with a safespot the task will take a very, very long time at 112 blue dragon kills.
---
Hahahah fuck you
---
He didnt die, clip:   
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ShakingSourTapirKAPOW
---
Gz btw
---
I still think it is silly that both are Elite rewards. The shortcut makes more sense from Elite since it is a high-level shortcut and it does save a lot of time. But the permanent ropes were something RS2 just did as a QoL without any reqs, so locking that behind Elite is a bit much. It is a bit more than just QoL since it does mean you can bring 2 more food or such, but Hard seems more than reasonable for them. As for devaluing Desert Elite, just move Nardah tele closer to the Altar and that would be an amazing perk again.
---
You're right. Old lore posts on the official site states that there is several days of walk between varrock and falador.
---
You are a madman haha
---
Great piano playing, should pluck the unibrow a little bit though 
---
I mean this in a nice way
---
Why'd you block out random things like the direction of your compass?
---
Took you 5 hours to get the cape?
---
I highly regret chinning personally as farming bosses like Vorkath or Hydra net 100k range xp an hour. Chinned to 99 sometime last month and I'm already up to 17m range xp.
---
It's not amazing but at least the bank makes gains while does to.
---
I wish something would lead to the destruction of your life
---
Only thing to be mindful of is you cant use hydra gloves. Its negative mage bonus is huge compared to b gloves and will make you splash ceumble undead
---
3 defence tho..
---
Crystal seed i think
---
Holy shit he was being sarcastic, this sub is so childish
---
I like how apparent it is nowdays that the osrs devs alternative to content such as dungeoneering and summoning was just to flesh out slayer a shit ton and then add in pets.
---
If none whip is stronger, tent becomes dead content as it degrades. Keeping the highest tier degradable avoids power creep.
---
Mostly, yes. I had to take a break halfway through for the restroom and fresh air and stuff but yeah. Fight caves on 50 range and MSB is rough when you’re newer to old school lol
---
Found it quicker then swampman!
---
Just because you received 3 of them doesnt mean the drop rate isn't 1/1500 or w/w the wiki states
---
Are you positive you haven't turned one in before or something?
---
You could try enchanting a digsite pendant just to check. 
---
Barring that, it is 1/51 so you could just be getting very unlucky.
---
It's a negligible change in that regard. The actual issue with an eternal dueling ring is it is just a stronger version of the crafting Cape
---
The whole point is that you’re not supposed to train melee that fast
---
Tacking on to this - chinning is like 10-20% faster kills, which is insane, compared to tbow
---
Wheres slayer?
---
bump
---
So your brain consists of paper hanging itself?
---
This is the video i usually recommend to friends too who are trying to learn

I didn't even need to enlarge the picture i immediately saw it

Haha agreed
---
You can boost to 88 con
---
I think I might have been there when you got it.... Did it happen kinda recently? Like 2 weeks ago maybe?
---
The result is exactly the same. I can clearly see the images in both examples. I honestly couldn’t give less of a fuck if i tried.
---
the savior of Venezuela.
---
How are herb runs afk?
---
 &gt;why would they be if bonds exist
---
Players who buy gold were never going to buy bonds, and if they have the stores they capture both sides of the market.
---
Wow nice one!
---
I actually gambled money on eclectics 
---
But ok, keep assuming
---
Crazy how much the price of claws increased over the time you started killing hydra!
---
Thousands of people do gorillas. The few people you know above drop rate is a meaningless sample.
---
Ah ok, yeah there were a good number then
---
cannon in stronghold and all you do is refill it? because if I melee than it kills only one at the time
---
they are not bots they are actual players gold farming so doesn't matter they will do the quest
---
Delete this
---
It took me over 300 on my alt and that was when it was manual. Just keep going, but make sure you haven’t already turned one in.

On mobile and copying links is stupidly hard for some reason. Lemme know if this works.

That's from a couple months after release of dslayer 1. Karamja did exist at this point in the game but was never mapped I guess, this is the first I'm realizing that.
---
The next content update that changed the map was with the inclusion of members and added in taverly and expanded westward all the way to seers village, and included brimhaven as well. Crandor is also now on the map after that update. I guess they just never mapped it back when dslayer came out cus its technically in the members area and members didn't exist then.

&gt;*Jagex Support on the online website, but cannot figure out a way to by pass this.

What support? You made an email, it was your responsibility to keep track of it, what the fuck do they care?
---
&gt;I have a total of 7 accounts registered to this email. I have not been able to change or update any information on these accounts in over 4 years.

What do you need to change?

No matter what, without access to the email the account is associated to, you are 100% totally fucked usually. 
---
The email is your responsibility, not jagex's, and they have no obligation to change information that they already stated they don't change because the original email needs to be used to verify the change of email address on the account. I wouldn't expect them to take the time to help someone change the email on their account, its your fault. You also couldn't take the time to make a new email/acc and fix this years ago.

No thanks. Don't like clicking videos on mobile. But your response answered my question sufficiently so thanks for replying
---
Having just recently done fight caves on an in-progress rune dragon alt, I would just add that doing fight caves with 70 range and Karils xbow is stupidly fucking boring and I absolutely believe some people just could not be bothered.
---
There is literally nothing rapier is BiS at that gives comparable gp/hr to DHL or DHCB.
---
Ironman with untrimmed con ppl like to get upsettie about the untrimmed con cape

Depends on where you're at. In Ohio tax doesn't show up till check out where I'm at
---
Honestly, probably because artists are inconsistent and Jagex doesn't appear to offer their artists any form of style guide.
---
I just chin nechs in the catacombs for 350-400k xp an hour at a net loss of less then 500k an hour gp. 
---
All you gotta do is attack the death spawns in the group and youll hit almost 100% of the time. At 96 ranged Im averaging 400-700 xp drops.
---
Two plus two is four
---
minus one that's three QUICK MAFFS
---
He doesn't. Air is composed of more than just oxygen. Oxygen isn't even a major component of air, it's just the most relevant one for us. 
---
It's like asking why a pepperoni staff doesn't give pizzas when there's more to pizza than pepperoni.

Curent bis helm is locked behind a quest locked monster (regicide).
---
I’m blind and saw it before the post was even created
---
Agility and mining are fun, haven't tried rc.
---
I have heard rc is slow, so not so fun.
---
Do you take much damage over acid phase? Does the spawn ever get you? Are you drinking super anti fire ext? Are you using anti venom +? All those things can add up quick and shorten trips.  You should destroy him I use just bp 96 range w rigour and get 4 kills every trip( to lazy to bring bgs spec, bring it sometimes).
---
But yeah all the specials are fairly avoidable( apart from first acid sometimes is hard to dodge splat) and that damages shortens trips fast
---
The guy was just giving advice. He isnt even being forceful. No reason to hit him with a whole paragraph about what you think is wrong with this sub. Chill out.
---
3 pets wow
---
fuck thank you i was looking forever
---
When you do bandos on the weekend with friends
---
Believe me. You’ll regret it.
---
I deironed at around 2k and instantly stopped playing after buying more or less max melee gear.
---
Made a new ironman a few months later.
---
Okay, so finish task, put in sell offer at a reasonable price, then go skill or quest in the meantime. It’s not the end of the world.
---
A rough estimate of a cost would be 281k per 25 kills (t bow, dragon arrows setup) 4 ranging pots, 5 brews, 14 super restores and 200 dragon arrows. So if we take (239k per kill \* 25) - 281k that equals to 5.694M of profit per hour. Times 300 hours = 1.7B profit. Take it with a grain of salt tho.
---
Awesome man! I'd actually really love for jagex to sell a book with sheet music of some of the classics, take my money!
---
Hes asking why dumbass
---
Maybe we stop adding junk to TT rewards?
---
People are always gonna ask for impossible shit, and then when someone with a development background explains why it's not possible, they'll always way "well why don't the jmods just do this" — as if these Jmods who have a career in programming weren't able to come up with the same solution that a random redditor with no development background thought up in 3 seconds.
---
I mean, case in point, the comment below yours is literally what I just described.
---
Nah dude you haven't seen some of the shit I've caught renewed doing
---
Yes I avoid the specials, acid does zero to little damage occasionally. His mage attacks nust rape me, and he seems to throw them out every other attack
---
God damn that sounds like so much work lmao I ain’t an efficiency scaper but I can appreciate it, I just use the classic poh method
---
Zaros gave me the power to see the future and know OP would put the rune crossbow in that exact spot 73 minutes ago
---
Those been out since 2015, you're like... 4 years late
---
They tried to buff the rune pouch with warding and it didn’t pass
---
Demand isn't too high (at this price),  but supply is very low
---
Nice
---
I know lol but I would still associate steam with air
---
Would support but runelite kind of does this already
---
Offering unsolicited advise on something as trivial as gp in a video game is annoying. I never said it's a big issue though.
---
Could someone give me a quick explanation how 83 construction POH would help improve my Vorkath efficiency? Specifically, how is it any better than teleporting to Clan Wars which has a bank and a full restore?
---
Ranger Boots
---
F
---
this, right here, is why i do not want to learn zulrah, vork is way better gp/hr and way easier than this snakey cunt.
---
A guy I knew took 150 before he got the kc, just keep trying Chief
---
Just let it out bro. What’s Your stats?
---
Got mine at 123kc. I wouldn't have had the willpower to do what you've done.
---
It's not that, it's that it's obviously purchased gold
---
yeah but do the determine the tax from the full total, or do they tax per product?
---
Lmao you’re 100% right. I did a wave to get a diary done and then wave 2 I fucked up not realizing I had to right click call the color rather than just click the horn. 
---
Got asked wtf I was doing etc etc like a normal person I took the criticism as sign to try harder and play better. Most people who call toxic just don’t want criticism for fucking up.
---
Obby cape LOL
---
It just needs to be locked behind ME2 or SOTE.
---
Took me 16 deaths till I got my first kill, then i got used to the rotations and it just got easier, 150 kc later and probably only 2 deaths. Using the cheat sheet is a must.
---
I definitely have one too bud
---
86 mage, 80 range, 80 def, 84 hp
---
I cri
---
for inferno and some tanking ye
---
I have almost based 80 on all melee and 99 range and 88 mage still just havent been bothered to get a fure cape yet ya know? probably after I get 99 mage I'll consider it, Did it long time ago on alts just dont fele the drive to get it yet.
---
I found it, but some guy named Swampletics stole it from me. He ran away hysterically screaming, "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!"
---
I would in a heartbeat
---
Hmmmm. Its a universal % in my state of 7% tax. Though stores won't tax store brand items mostly
---
Time to make a new account.
---
Why not make the anti bot system better
---
Noooo :(
---
Tried it for 5 seconds and decided to buy my torso. Got it within 50min and have enjoyed doing other things with it. Glad you like it though! Maybe you can join that leech service.
---
Yeah reading is hard, I goofed.
---
I hate naming quest sequels with just a number, it feels very lazy
---
From someone who doesn’t play a ton, it’s bat shit crazy you’re only ranked that high.
---
When you start slayer soon, Your CB wont be high so you will be using beginner Slayer masters thus getting pretty bad tasks. it will Also take forever since your CB is so low.
---
The best idea is to start slayer at base 70 using Nieve.
---
You can get to a point to know when you start moving, turn off prayers even. It's all about rhythm and memorization. You got this!
---
no skilling pet is “hard” to get, its solely based on rng, id say you’re pretty lucky though, some people are like 50m-100m dry.
---
Somehow only took me 3 seconds
---
How u gonna have rapier money and not have a fire cape
---
dude above u probably alched to 99 and is now age 99
---
It’s impossible for a 60-70 to have quest cape because Dream Mentor has a minimum requirement of 85 combat
---
So should the removal of boots requirement be polled then? Runescape makes zero sense at all. ZERO.
---
Don't forget to consider that if the demand for one particular item is much higher at a boss, every other unique there will always crashed in price massively. Look at ballistad for example, or even the ferocious gloves if you want an example at the boss where the Hydra tail already comes from. Their supply, and theirfor the price, isn't dictated by demand, but rather the supply is dictated by the demand of zenyte jewelry. The exact same thing happened to ferocious gloves: they're very cheap for what they are because everyone wants to get the Hydra claw.
---
Quintus Zazimus Augustus
---
I can't see sote being a req for a hard diary.
---
Ah yeah I get it you mean just let them continue to gather data for a while. I was thinking limit and watch suspected accounts
---
Nice merch
---
Barrows is incredibly easy, 1/33 drop rate
---
Should be very doable, what gear?
---
Would this lock void elite behind sote or would they take that out??
---
Nice.
---
I am surprised they never offered a buff to the armor. I haven't got to play around with the numbers yet, but something like 20% Damage instead of 15% or such could go a long way for making it more viable. From what I've seen in videos that tested it when it was better it just barely beat out options like ACB so a bit more damage should fix that. But while it is disappointing that it may not replace Blowpipe or even MSB, it is a very different type of weapon.
---
How does having multiple copies of a pet work? Can you have 3 of them roaming at the same time in poh? Can you have 1 roaming in poh and have 1 following you at the same time?
---
I didnt know you had an obsession for snakes and holy tears...
---
Oof this is the real blunder
---
Uh what
---
I mean runecrafting was agility v2
---
Bgs is great at raids because most people will use dwh so after a few specs the bgs becomes handy. It can also be used for a crush wep against tekton. Big downside is you can't build chests :(
---
ow well most time 1 car wheel sucks and doesnt work. i thaught it was that
---
This post gave me anxiety
---
After something like that, the rebuild can be pretty miserable lol
---
That's quite funny tho mate don't be sore for it
---
“Only ranked that high”? 
---
There are millions of people that play this game. The high scores cuts off at 2m. 
---
That’s freaking great.
---
Yeh, isn't the joke relating to the one wheel that always goes in its own direction. The dodgy wheel being the ACB.
---
Clients like runelite display what your level would theatrically be if they went past 99 based on how much exp you have for that skill. They can do this because there is a formula the game uses for how much exp each level should be that it follows all the way up to 99. You can take that same formula and extend it's use upward past 99 to calculate the potential greater levels. But they don't really do anything it's just for show really.
---
Oh lol 🤔 I take my payment in the form of seeing people enjoy it, also it literally only takes me 5 seconds to create, I just typed in keywords (E.g. impling and crossbow) and then tell it to only put in 1 rune cbow, and then put a swampman background, so yea
---
SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Me (hard)
---
As in out-dps the healing so you can completely ignore the healers? Probably, but it'll take a lot longer. I did the math a while back and all 4 on him will heal him a lot more quickly than people think, will drag the fight out so long you're better off at least tagging 1 or 2 of em.
---
You know what i love about rants like these? OP always slots in insults toward the other players that enjoy the content that he/she is ranting about.
---
Git gud and stop being trash.
---
How u get a pet?
---
I use it for 2X HP restore and preserve so my imbued heart boost lasts longer.
---
You can do it kacy
---
I know I know! But the fact that enough people have played that much to be up there is crazy to me! Even back when i was a kid playing all the time I had exp struggles! But as adults now I’m sure strategy is better LOL
---
I hope you didn't sell it on the GE. People will buy it for much more than the GE value
---
weirdo
---
just messing with u
---
When isit always you 3 that i dont got a pet before lvl 99
---
People that use twitch chat memes are going to look back on it like I look back on my Myspace.
---
It's become more than that for sure. At first you get the nostaglia wave
---
It was 24m. My main has 1.4b so it wasn’t a hard decision
---
Depends on your atk and str levels, I’m 70 atk 70 str and was getting about 50/60k and hour training my defence.
---
You could make 300-500m if you invested in better roi items.
---
With active flipping you can make around 50m per day if your stack is 1b.
---
Still 114m is nice. Easy bond money.
---
I definitely understand the appeal of Ironman Mode.
---
But when it comes to mundane things (especially items for quests) sometimes it's nice to just throw money at the GE.
---
Try the website use your brain please
---
Idk about others but if I see someone doing something when there's a better way to do it in gunna let them know. I don't know if they're doing it because they don't know there's something better or what.
---
If they genuinely don't know there was a better way, they're usually pretty greatful.
---
If they're choosing to do said thing, all the power to them and I move on.
---
It's not like I'm gunna sit there and argue with the guy that they're being ineffcient and they should stop having fun rn
---
It's more like "hey you know there's a better way to do that right?" Them: "yup!" Me: "cool have a nice day!" Ohh man soooo toxic
---
9/10 the person is nice and loves the advice, and it leads to some conversation and usually making a new friend.
---
No proof of anything you claimed
---
Entirely dependant on where you use it
---
YES PLEASE
---
Scythe is better against 3x3 or larger monsters iirc, anything smaller rapier would beat it.
---
I did it on my first try but it was rng that mofo hard af
---
many loot much money wow
---
Oh shit someone else thought about this before me, I promise I will donate all the money I make from this post and give it to oRiGiNal CoNtEnT CrEaToR
---
grotesque guardians
---
Scythe is expensive but on larger than 1 tile mobs scythe is nearly always better just not always cost  effective
---
I wouldn't say old school runescape was dead, but I agree with the sentiment that raw playing numbers where lower. The average player was also a loooot lower, and people's opinions where dramatically different. There wasn't as much in talk of development, and if something was in development it was going to be months out for a single boss or something we would consider relatively small today. I think the time frame you are referring to, we had maybe half of our current peak players playing at a time.
---
Something something suicide on kacy's watch
---
Get kebos elite scrub.
---
The date is “16-ago-2019” come on
---
A true wordsmith
---
Great idea tbh!
---
Nechs, dust devil's, Abby demons, smoke devil's are the big ones that you can get great Slayer/magic/defense xp while breaking even or profiting a bit.
---
Dust devils and nechs, might be some more that I can't remember right now (smoke devils too but they're at 93)
---
I meant that people would scout them for completionists. There would absolutely be a cc or discord charging x amount of gp per lucky and dragon and it would be fueled by completionists trying to get everything in the most efficient manner possible.
---
Oh yeah thats true. Good point
---
Look up a zulrah rotation guide and keep that window open next to your game. Always switch prayer first and then gear. The blue phase can attack with both mage and range, but pray mage and eat when you need on the ranged attacks. Stay above 55 hp. For the jad phase, you should pray the opposite of what attack is coming towards you. Gl
---
It equates to roughly 100k-200k more profit per hour depending on efficiency (with Lance). I have a maxed med 60-99-75-99-75-99, maxed clanning zerk 99-99-45-99-85-99, and 3 maxed mains for alting (were brutal alts, now rune drag alts).
---
I've done plenty of testing :p
---
You use the same food so food is moot point. And super combat vs ranging potion is like 1500gp difference per dose. Assuming you repot every 5mins for efficiency, that's 18k gp loss a hr. Bolts are 1k a piece or 1.25k for diamonds which are needed to get more kills per hour for comparable profit. Shooting around 1k-1.2k bolts a hour is 200-275ish bolt loss due to breaking which is 300k ish. Now you can use amethyst broads which are much cheaper but also less kills a hour. Now you can use a cheaper bolt like amethyst broads but you now use more per kill, few more breaks, and less kills a hr.
---
Thought it was sheep shearer. But thats for p2p lol
---
these jmods should appear at w334 cw for a bit to talk to us itd be a really good chance to get feedback, zamoraak here btw nyx :)
---
Myth guild
---
Yeah and look how zulrah is farmed. I disagree with that as well, but it’s too late now and future BIS items shouldn’t be modeled after that
---
Ok
---
Why cant you see the ribbon on the outside
---
I wonder what the lesbian hunter crossbow uses as ammo....
---
it takes 80 in a skill with very little other benefit. Just because it's enjoyable to train doesn't mean it's "Free" or "easy". The reason it felt free is just because the time spent training it flew by. 
---
You could always up the cost a little if you want it to take more time to get, although I don't think that's a good choice, they already require you to buy literally no other rewards at all on the way to 80. And 2m cash to recharge is nothing to sneeze at.
---
To your point, yes, in RS2 they were relatively easy to get, but remember that before chaotics, whip was BIS. And has been inexpensive forever. I started playing before slayer was released, but my oldest memories of the whip were it being ~5m I think? Pretty fuzzy. 5m in 2006 gp still isn't much today. So, actually, chaotics were the first time a BIS weapon actually took that long to get. Before whip it was D long, which was 100k from a store. Of course, godswords used to be quite expensive, but they weren't BIS for much back then. Soul split put SGS on suicide watch, and d claws did the same for AGS.
---
A*
---
Please keep these up!
---
You don't have to be good at PVM to make money. And you don't have to get a fire cape if you don't feel like it.
---
Should be about 3m/hr still which is decent. I imagine after supply costs that probably goes down to a bit above 2.5 per hour though.
---
lmao just kill zulrah ez
---
In the "Advanced Options" menu in the settings tab, you can change whether the side-panel is transparent or not - this affects the background of every tab, not just the stats.
---
this is so cool. how did you do this?
---
4Head
---
Hard only increases monster hp, not defense. And gives more points. So hard is always the way to go.
---
The ends fold up so they stay all tucked in the card
---
Does this even count because the original joke isnt good to begin with. Idk why people upvoted it in june when it was posted the first time and idk why theyre upvoting it now.
---
Happens. Was high as fuck. Panicked.
---
Yes it’s protectable
---
Damn I got my pet on 217 kc 😂😂
---
yeah that definitely does happen often. The only reason I asked was just cuz I think its important info on what your chances are on recovering the account are. The main factor is those accounts that get hacked and often have a lot of play time on them, which gives you enough info to recover it, or they just give up and quit. 
---
It definitely sucks. cuz it is your account and all, but I would assume your chances are very slim since that person who hacked you could have changed passwords many times, added pin, authenticator, and he would have all that information, as opposed to you who only has the account creation email. 
---
Definitely try but be prepared to cut your loses and move on, since there is a potential of the dude on your account currently to be able to provide 4x the amount of account information that you could.
---
I actually like blast mining, having to keep the l timing right to not get smacked for a phat 15 damage keeps me concentrated.
---
Those hydra pipes look awesome
---
Didn’t he do a whole bunch of anti-vegan stuff? Or am I thinking of a different person
---
I'm writing up my own list of pros and cons and I'm only getting pros???
---
And a whole week of scaping unbothered lol
---
What's wrong with that? I assume "ago" is August in Italian or Spanish or maybe another language.
---
Are you still working on arbalist
---
Once chinhunters get pass lvl 30 they can already teleport... Spiders would take care of the level 3s. It be camped hard. You can't bank stand.
---
Chymistry has a range or mage only guide. Veeery easy honestly if u do it his way.
---
Yo man!
---
Bro i was so hyped to start running bird houses, finished bone voyage right before work, and now it’s fucked!
---
I'm engaged and getting married in December. I honestly hope my fiance/wife to be does this for me too one day lol
---
None of them probably, but August is agosto in Portuguese. The only error here is that OP said "just got this message" instead of "just read".
---
is this what mansplaning is? when someone just goes on a rant explaining something that is pretty obvious?
---
They may technecally be able to check if you've died, but there's no way they'll make you into a hardcore even of you haven't.
---
I fixed my comment for you.
---
Nope.
---
They’re probably just excess Christmas ornaments produced in China that were dumped in NK. Betchya baby Jesus is on the flip side of each one.
---
I bet it smells awful.
---
i just saw this guy last night around the same spot. all he does is stand there
---
Clue scrolls is a big one that comes to mine. Usually for elite/master clues you're geared up with avas and a blowpipe so you can quickly kill double agents/bandos &amp; arma guardians/zaros wizards etc. 
---
Grapple shortcuts come up from time to time in clue steps, so it could be handy every now and then.
---
Yeah... And teleblock doesnt exist.
---
How'd you make 8 mil with those stats
---
Full obby, bneck, obby sword, normal rumble with super combats is extremely afk, you can click every 15-20 minutes to repot and just keep yourself topped off with absorbs. 75-80k melee exp an hour. Or you can do overloads so you only have to click once every 5 minutes, but you'll get better rates than super combats.
---
Best idea I’ve seen in a while.
---
Imagine taking this so seriously
---
Someone doesn’t understand what rng means. It is luck bud. And you ain’t got it evidently.
---
Jeez, he sure did haha.
---
Jajajajaja
---
Bot Farms have the entire tutorial island -&gt; bot location process automated, including account creation. Once an account gets banned, that client will immediately start making a new account.
---
Also, the electricity cost is limited by your power supply, and 70cents/hour is definitely a low estimate (5 cabbages per minute).
---
The serious gold farmers also automate getting membership via the 1 week free trial, and definitely farm better things than cabbages
---
Can you please turn of performance mode. My eyes are bleeding from reading the chatbox.
---
Tanks for the tip !
---
If you attach it to an avas, it should just become unbreakable, yeah. Sort of like when you mount a glory or a xerics and suddenly they're infinite. 
---
If they HAVE to remain breakable then it could be kinda cool to have addy and rune grapples as well, each with an even lower break chance. Mith goes on the attractor **(1/25 break chance)**, addy goes on the accumulator **(1/50 break chance)** and runite goes on the assembler **(never breaks)**. The colour of the grapple would then match the colour of the Ava's device.
---
Imagine believing jamflex would remove free trade..........
---
*has horrible PTSD flashback*
---
Is there only 1? I zoomed in and found it almost immediately
---
1b xp or gtfo :)
---
Yo I fuck with this heavy. I just want it for fashion but looks useful af too.
---
If you can’t get a fire cape you need advice about the game.
---
no
---
how did it taste
---
Maybe GWD bosses although you may want better stats overall for that. Saracnis the spider boss may be doable as well.
---
There is a plugin that lets you see "fake" levels which go past 99 so if you are someone that appeals to even though levels past 99 have no function you can keep going for goals (again if XP/grinding is your thing you enjoy about the game). It follows the level curve that exists for the game already so if those levels DID exist they require the correct amount of XP.
---
Yo?
---
I just wanna learn more because I really don't know anything about WHY it was a controversial change, I just know that it was. Can anyone explain why it created such an uproar?
---
From what I read it sounds like trade was only limited in extremely niche scenarios, preventing massively unbalanced trades to accounts that were brand new and had never been a member through either subscription or bonds.
---
Why would people care that you can't trade a massive amount of money to a brand new level 3 that's not a member? The only reason I can come up with is that people would no longer be able to transfer money/supplies to an alt they made, but just get that alt membership a single time and problem solved, right? This subreddit routinely says that they want gold buyers to be permanently banned to curb gold farming, and it seems like a trade limit would do that pretty effectively, no?
---
What was the big issue?
---
sapphire rings, yews, zammy wines... but mostly from mining addy ore
---
Devalues fletching cape completely against it scratch it. File 13.
---
Zulrah is one of those things that feels insanely aids and borderline impossible for like 10KC but then all the sudden something just clicks and next thing you know you’re doing it without even having to think. Repetition is key.
---
Thank god, my hatred of quests knows no bounds
---
Fix rng? lol
---
what is that even supposed to mean
---
I actually do this because my total bank is in the 160m area. You make money on it if you're smart.
---
Say I'm doing a barrage task, I'll spend 2 minutes getting a kodai wand at a reasonable price. I usualy get it at mid price(in this case it was 88m). Next task I got was gargs. I just used pros, bludgeon and prayed piety the whole task. I put the kodai in for 90m and it sold during. I got another barrage task and bought it back for 88m again. Repeated the 90m sale while eating dinner. Came back, got black dragons and bought dhcb for mid. Sold for a few hundred K over mid.
---
I'd say I go even 50% of the time, lose 100k ish 10% of the time and make good profit the rest.
---
I'm +10m from doing it after getting 88 slayer. Takes a bit longer to visit G.E but I also get to use good gear to make up for it.
---
25 year grind for those rewards?
---
Shit quest.
---
I know how dh works its 1% per hp missing. I figured 87 hp would work lol. I saw something that 85hp is when u should stop using obby. Not sure tho but I don't think (even with those items) it's anywhere near 100k/hr tho. I could be wrong tho. Most people that are getting high xp are most certainly not afking nmz. If ur bare minimum afking nmz ur looking at 60-70k per hour.
---
You don’t have to be good at PvM to get a fire cape, you just have to not be absolutely terrible.
---
No.
---
Yeah 10% return is child’s play. Have you even seen wolf on Wall Street? Do you think Jordan Belfort even gets out of bed for 100m? Shame on you for being proud of profit that was viewed as a shortcoming in the eyes of the mighty u/AlwaysDankrupt
---
nah
---
Genius
---
if that's the case wouldn't blood barrage be the best? No freezing means easy stacking and it's the hardest hitting spell under ice.
---
Usually centered around prayer and gear switches, avoiding floor/room obstacles, unique weaknesses that bosses have you need to take advantage of, and thinking about when/how to attack adds vs when to be attacking the boss. 
---
Almost no bosses involve just standing there using a single protection prayer and smacking the thing until it's dead like you do with early level mobs and slayer monsters.
---
Could’ve rewarded ass
---
Dude. Just... Dude.
---
It's not "obvious", unless you specifically talk to him and he seems like he has no idea how the game works. It could even be an alt account for all you know.
---
#9: Morytania Swamp Lettuce
---
I don't mind mining, especially motherload mine.
---
What are the rates for torso?
---
If the game tells you that you are standing in a members only area it means you are still member, otherwise you would have spawned in Lumbridge if your membership had run out, try logging into a members only world instead.
---
It's not subjective at all lmao. Spending more money for something less effective is objectively not worth it. Whether or not you personally like it does not make it a smart investment.
---
You can just say you got yourself a birthday card. Might be less shameful than making up a whole wife my guy
---
Dude thats stupid this is literally an update to make grapple shortcuts actually useful
---
Suh dude
---
did you put the monster in the top right? theres no way the dps should be that high vs brutal blacks

edit: yeah, youre not inputting the monster in, theres no way you should have a 98% accuracy rate lol
---
Source?😂
---
So just like zulrah and vorkath? Exponentially better gph and shorter travel time.
---
This helps so much. I've done 35-70 agility in the last few days with a decent amount of that done at work. Turn XP counters off, don't look at how much do is left all the time and the xp comes much easier.
---
Sounds sick ! Do you find it enjoyable
---
Yeah cus the video game RuneScape is super serious and doing something for enjoyment is a dumb idea. One wrong move and it's game over. There's only one way to play the open world sandbox mmo RuneScape. If you have zero interest in doing ranged combat or mage combat you definitely shouldn't upgrade your melee gear. You should definitely just suck it up and invest in ranged because it's stronger. And he will certainly never make any more gp later on, and have no ability to sell the rapier if his tastes change. This is a giant decision that should be made with the utmost caution because it's gonna be a real big deal if he does it wrong.
---
This is the dumbest thing ive ever seen on reddit. Hands down. I love it.
---
Don't they all use the GE to do that though? Why would limiting the amount of money one player can toss at another in a trade prevent them from flipping on the GE?
---
Can't tell if r/woooosh
---
For the sake of simplicity I said our stats are the same in reality he has 77 range I have 78. He has 70/70/70 and I'm 74/75/72 but he has 70 prayer and I have 53. Appreciate the response, Zilyana looks cool and think we could do Sriacha together for sure and get some decent loot. :)
---
For strength too?
---
But they just removed the mobile free trial thing though
---
Thank you, forgot about Sriacha
---
20 bonds every xmas. You have 365 days to make it.
---
super nope

Fletching skillcape perk: "Am I a Joke to you?"
---
For when you forget to bring a teleport due to this, remember that both home tele *and* minigame teles exist w/ separate cooldown timers :P
---
Vork is much more irritating on the phone, everything that's easy on PC is now hard.
---
 I support 100%
---
Pettiton to start a 'the floor is lava' agility course in the Tzharr city.
---
Congrats!
---
That is the opposite of ironic
---
I can barely do vorkath on the computer** my bad

You wanna save 10 seconds of travel time every couple of weeks when you have to go to a super obscure area? Better grind out 85+ in some irrelevant stat little bitch.
---
It’s how Jagex keeps skilling “relevant” after raping it to death with pvm drop tables.
---
Did they? I haven't looked at it in months honestly
---
I know, i was sarcastic
---
I haven’t even tried vork on my phone because I can barely get a kill on my laptop
---
ohhhhhhh i had no idea i had to do that. ok i get it now, thanks for pointing that out to me
---
its a hard learning curve but once u got a few kills down and u learn the pattern its extremely easy, just keep dying and learning you'll get there lmao
---
😱
---
*whoa*
---
Max cash IQ.
---
Take this logic further and any money making method becomes pointless if you have an income
---
Iirc, jagex wanted to add it and people voted no because it was going to come from twitch first then to everyone else 4 weeks later. 
---
So it’s on the back burner now.
---
Or maybe imbue a runite grapple at nmz, or a new quest that gives you an unbreakable grapple? Something blessed by Armadyl, or an ancient relic from zeah.
---
This guy slaps your girls ass in the club, what do you do?
---
Yes and no. Starting Barrows is definitely easier but Construction is passive and fast while grinding enough Barrows chests for a full set of specifically Guthans will take a while.
---
If you just camp teaks in kingdom and grind 87 Slayer, you'll have enough teaks banked for 83 Construction most likely. And enough GP to pay for planks + butler costs to get the levels. So overall around 10 hours of active Construction training (including making the planks) while grinding full Guthans will definitely take longer in terms of active time spent on Barrows.
---
Karils top/bottom and Ahrims top/bottom are more useful than Guthans to me right now anyway. I want to do Zulrah and GWD. Torag top/bottom or Dharok top/bottom would be good for Bandos as well. Guthans is OK for healing on minions but B2P or blood barrage is better anyhow since you'll do it way faster (i.e. before the bosses respawn).
---
You can’t lmao unless you’re at the Ge constantly flipping for 15+ hours a day. Realistically you’ll make more like 5-10m a day flipping semi passively
---
My gf doesn't play but we race on own phones and it's really enjoyable, thanks for this!
---
Shouldn't even be a priority anymore
---
I went there on the weekend to afk for for my pure, ended up playing every game fully. Its amazing fun.
---
Nothing, that’s the point. It won’t get used. 
---
Even on pvp worlds, MOST banks are a safe zone.
---
For anyone else having trouble reading the fine print its 180m profit on 507,000 blood runes (I think)
---
Look at jad, react to an attack, do one (1) thing, then repeat. That one thing can be sipping a potion, tagging a healer, moving yourself, or simply just continuing. 
---
Don't try to sneak in too many extra actions.
---
Gz!@!@!@
---
Great advice, you fuck
---
It’s not a 14m margin lol. He just lucky and the items rose in price over the course of a few weeks. The actual margin on a t bow is like 500k roughly
---
Or you know use the fletching cape. Let’s just add a home tele to the fire cape while we are at it
---
People who are ignorant will still accuse you and assume. You can have 3k+ vork kills and loads of other things to show you've made at least half of your money and people won't care. You can show plenty of game knowledge, have quest cape with loads of diaries done, have relatively high total (1800+) and know hot to raid and people won't care. There's no line in the sand its just people pouring their insecurities and jealousy onto you.
---
The fact is it doesn't matter how anyone makes their money these days, people just choose to be mad about it. If the guy in the post made his gear through buying bonds who cares, he at least knows better than half the people on this game who actively RWT.
---
Was there all weekend. Games consist of randoms, high level max gear flag runners. A shit load of pures getting halos.
---
The game is actually insane fun.
---
Bringing life been would Heber to mean it was alive once
---
WildCC, everyone is welcome and we chat about pretty much anything :)
---
SotE is worth doing anyway in my opinion. It's a great quest and I enjoyed every second of it!
---
Autoclick rock cake
---
Thats actually an amazing idea.
---
You aren’t really that good with rhetorical devices are you?
---
You're supposed to burst Abbys?
---
Did lvl 5 all roles only one person left all other rounds went good :)
---
I find the easiest way to do jad is to have him spawn south of italy while you're on the north side, then when the healers spawn you can tag them one by one and lure them north of italy to kill them without worrying about jad. Where the wave 45 on wave 3 spawns is where jad spawns.
---
For range you can only look at his feet, the sound happens too late. With mage the sound is instant. Listen for mage, constantly watch his feet for range, and only do one other action (like tagging healers) between each attack.
---
In the first place I really like to pk for the sake of playing advanced Rock Paper Scissors so it’s kind of irrelevant to me but with the bh rework it will hopefully be fun to start from scratch and pk for money. The game has so much potential to be good but jagex caters to the short term rather than long term quality.
---
Up to mazchna for dogs, but yeah, still pretty niche unless you are grinding out points.
---
Come for the nostalgia, stay for the sweaty chair
---
This is so sad. Alexa play despacito
---
Rapier plus 10m in gear is more dps than whip and max melee gear. So if you think buying a rapier is going to lower your dps then you're definitely comparing it to range.
---
Nice selfie you got going on there...
---
Silly argument , there is no reason that a piece of low level content which is extremly dead will not be revived just because you don't want to to hurt a very hard to get cape's ability that almost no one uses.
---
It makes much more sense to just replace the Fletching cape's ability with something else.
---
This is really cool, I’d absolutely enjoy something like this
---
Now for the 100cb diary cape!
---
Bro you can make that back ezpz don’t give up. Change your email and password, set up a new pin and get Authenticator. We can get that money back for you fast and you’ll be right back on your feet. Don’t let some fucking asshole ruin your experience. This game is great and you’re not going to want to miss out, especially over less that a mil.
---
I got hacked.. luckily they missed a couple items so I’m not entirely fucked.. my question is how did they get past my bank pin?
---
Best 2 options are nmz or ammonite crabs. Both with obby setup
---
Frog and snail is delicious, but fucking maggots? euuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
dragon grapple sounds dope. i could totally see it having a duel use as a ranged weapon that is a one-shot ammo that pulls enemies into melee range. but that would be strong.
---
It would be nice for Arma, 1 more inventory slot saved
---
If people keep panic selling them, they're just gonna keep getting more merched than they already are
---
No xp must be a beginner quest smh
---
LMFAO so true. If everyone just looked at the guide for 5 minutes they would save 2 hours of time.
---
You ever wonder why the majority of high-level players attack in teams, because it’s impossible to kill anyone with a brain with that “idea”. 
---
If you only use Ancients they can easily reach level 30 or a teleport lever with food, easy escape. 
---
If you only use Standard they can easily run away because you deal less damage and your freezes used to last nothing, easy scale, 
---
The way it is now Ancients is still superior if you’re in a team but solo Standards is actually viable.
---
Mining exp
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
Source?
---
A source. I need a source.
---
Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.
---
No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.
---
You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.
---
Do you have a degree in that field?
---
A college degree? In that field?
---
Then your arguments are invalid.
---
No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.
---
Correlation does not equal causation.
---
CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.
---
You still haven't provided me a valid source yet.
---
Nope, still haven't.
---
I just looked through all 308 pages of your user history, figures I'm debating a glormpf supporter. A moron
---
64 minutes on first completion isn't bad at all. Nice man, grats!
---
Your iron, go get it on your own
