Fishing skill = click on the fishing spot and go to the bathroom.

There aren't actually that many fun skills in the game. It's the xp/hr, levels, rewards, and unlocked content that is fun. Nobody in the world thinks Crafting is fun, but nobody has an issue with that skill for some reason.
---
The only truly awful skill is pre-77 RC. As long as Warding isn't like that, then it will be a perfectly acceptable skill.
---
I say that while still seething about the fact the GE was added.
---
I'm actually not a redditor, its okay that you thought that. The average IQ in the world is like 90, which is almost a standard deviation below average. Most people really arent that inventive and you are in the majority, so take solace in that. Us high intelligence people are generally hapy :) to share our knowlege.

A bit late now, and you were doing it for the clues but...

The optimal loot potential is 86.6, not 88. You lost quite a bit of money getting those bolt racks.

Yea done, I‚Äôll be *done* with the game after that üòÇ

Make it from warding and I'll vote yes

I spend most of my time doing high-level PvM and minigames with IRL friends. If you pay for membership and only play to do "repetitive, monontous skills" then I feel so sorry for you because the game is a lot more than that.

You‚Äôll lose about 2 mil but gain ~620k crafting xp. It‚Äôs a fast way to train so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs better to sell it and do a different method.
---
Honestly I was diehard going to vote no. It was only until I sat back and thought about it, realising that the osrs dev team have much more experience, knowledge and generally are good guys in this case. They want the best for osrs and unlike other game devs they aren't only concerned about money. Otherwise they wouldn't have polled it in the first place. So I voted yes.
---
It's the business plan, make more content, hire more devs, increase the $11. The memes are the only thing keeping this game alive.
---
Just goes to show you've never worked on any amount of serious projects then.

I bet there are 10 year olds with better knowledge of group projects than you

Just having one sitting there is bound to have people dumping shit in it for the hell of it. Especially if it‚Äôs in a few main spaces next to banks.

Dungeoneering is a mini game.

Boys, I think I solved it.

Game has been out 6 years. Nearly everyone is max melee or at least 90+ which lets you do all high end content, on top of that, most max mains like myself have alts that are the ‚Äúmid level‚Äù accounts you are speaking of, so it‚Äôs still us.
---
Sea Shanty 2
---
Haha you never played dungeoneering? It was fun.
---
I'm indifferent to warding as a skill, and would not consider it worth the dev time even if I knew that sailing would never pass.
---
SotE and Menaphos are both things that I would want, so even the one I wouldn't prefer I would consider worth the dev time.
---
I maxed it and hated every second of it
---
This reads like a 25 buttholes video
---
Dungeoneering was a minigame not a skill change my mind

Don't know why you're getting downvoted, lol. It literally has 2 attacks, essentially. It's also a boss you're 100% invincible against. For whatever reason, Runescape is just a much harder game when it comes to dealing with an enemy's 50/50 attack.
---
You make a great point in regards to the excitement of training current skills. That's why I think going forward "content enjoyment" should be an important consideration of the implementation process whether or not a said skill should pass. I understand that creates a higher level of difficulty but there's really no rush to pass a new skill and who's to say it wouldn't be better to just focus on skilling updates for the currently available skills that make them more engaging and exciting to train
---
If you say so.
---
The improvements from the April post and this one show me that they are committed to making the content feel right! They aren't going to toss some random BS into the game. If something goes wrong, they'll fix it...but we have to give them the chance!
---
A mini game with the best content in runescape hands down.
---
Invalid response. Not what I'm wanting to know.  Try again.

I have never gotten that far but man that's real good. Hope that you do great things in the game.

most polls pass with a huge margin, so go ahead cake boy you wont change anything.

imagine not having these sexy ass boots as your default naked character boots
---
what are you all doing
---
I fucking love you grande
---
Yeah and it started small which pretty much everyone was okay with because the official client had nothing then got insanely out of control imo.
---
If I'm not mistaken the moving of imbues is already off the table in the updated blog, and it's hard to add a lot of magic gear without retooling magic gear drops.
---
Why should my vote be for anyone else but myself?
---
absolutely based
---
Ohhhh, okay. Cheers for letting me know.
---
This really seems like it should result in a ban.
---
I have no idea if Jagex can tell if someone is using runelite+ specifically but that client is honestly just dodgy. Wouldn't suprise me if people are being hacked through using it.
---
Osrs could use a skill like invention which I think this is a good step towards
---
pls add me in game to remind me lBambino, gz m8
---
Maxed in Rs3, my guy, games shit.
---
The most realistic way I see a new skill being added is if it starts out as a minigame, or as some other small mechanic, and gets gradually built up until it's something pretty much everyone likes. As is, committing to a skill you haven't tried yet feels like a major risk, both in terms of the game and in terms of the dev hours it would take, which might dissuade a significant number of people.
---
Idk maybe because people like it, the last 2 non buyables failed, it fills a thematic hole, its healthy for the economy, and its holding open betas for people to try it and critique it as they please so that it can be changed in accordance to the players' wishes
---
I tend to agree with you, personally. But, we‚Äôll see

---
A lot of streamers really don't understand that the main reason people watch them is for the particular game they are playing not just the person.
---
cause an item sink would be helpful, an interesting item sink you can train/level and rewards you with gear would be even better. If it wasnt "buyable and dead content on arrival" then its either "resource gathering and boring" or "should have just been a minigame"
---
1. This was literally a joke
---
2. Reddit only has a problem with people influencing other peoples votes if they are voting no, its totally fine to draw a cute nieve saying to vote yes or upvoting bad memes that generalise all people who vote no to warding as salty max capers who never wants any new content in the game
---
is that the reason im getting murked? I was thinking about that since pretty much any lvl come attack me

"competitive"....right.

the yes voters are basically Hitler fans ngl
---
you 100% right, and it will become one of the most hated skills to train if allowed in. thats why we take one for the team right now and vote no for the boys
---
Good lord, those were my college years. Most of my play time was in Jr. High, so like 2001-2003 for me.
---
Appritiate your honesty, please don't take my critical view about one aspec that you've written personal.
---
&gt;but why would I vote yes to something that I'm not going to participate in which will take months of dev time? Skilling is boring in my opinion, so why would I vote for something I find boring
---
Voting no against such a fundemental part of the game just so dev time will be dedicated to your kind of content is an un-healthy view on the game and will hurt it long-term if people will keep using it, imagine that all the skillers and pvmers that don't participate in the wilderness voted against any poll that was about updating the wilderness just because they want the dev time to be focused on skilling, wildy would've never got any update since osrs release, the moment groups of people start mass no-ing content just so the dev time will be focused on their liking the nothing in this game will progress.
---
If you think Warding will hurt the game, vote no by all means, but if you just want the devs to drop it so they can cater you, you should think about your attitude.
---
Sorry again if this came harsh.
---
what skirt or tank shield? cant afford ely but everything else
---
I actually enjoy runecrafting, but ok.
---
Hey it was my turn to repost this today:(
---
I find it trashy that literally all of reddit is saying yes to warding downvoting any other opinions on the matter. Just because you have a different opinion doesn‚Äôt make the other wrong. There are way more posts saying to vote yes than to vote no. If you don‚Äôt believe me count them lol
---
OH MY GOD
---
Even if your opinion is still no after reading the blog that's fine because you may have seen or thought of something that I may not have
---
Oh you got downvoted? why son... i thought we were memeing
---
Didn‚Äôt that classix guy get banned for RWT not too long ago? Lol
---
What the fuck did you just say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I reached top of my clan in the hiscores, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous raids on Corp, and I have over 3,000,000 confirmed wilderness kills. I am fully trained in all 23 skills and I‚Äôm the top PKer in the entire Ownage armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another NMZ prod. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which have never seen before in Gilenor, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me in W29 GE? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of scouts across the servers and your location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your main. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be in any world, anytime, and I can PK you in over 700 different ways, and that's just with a bronze dagger. Not only am I extensively trained in pvp combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the God Wars Dungeon and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the wilderness, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy skull your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking enter button. But you couldn‚Äôt you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit vengeance all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, bwana.
---
Data breaches aren't something that I could have prevented, it's the fault of third party system admins that my information was leaked. However, it was the Jagex which enabled the thief to change my password reset email, and once that was done, there was really no hope for my runescape account. At this point I'm just hoping the email password reset can be done, otherwise all of my other accounts are compromised and I might have to contact IC3 about identity theft.
---
How is it that people still don't realize that sarcasm/jokes don't translate well via text unless you spell out that it's a joke? Even if you add "it's a joke" in a separate message later, it makes me wonder whether you actually meant it as a joke or are just pulling back you opinion with the excuse that you meant it as a joke. 
---
Users saying "it's obviously a joke". I have a sincere question, how am I, or anyone else who doesn't know this streamer, suppose to know it's a joke when the only context I'm given is a single tweet? I honestly want to learn how anyone is able to glean the fact that this is a joke at a glance. I'm serious, this isn't meant to be an insult. I actually want your perspective.
---
That‚Äôs good because one of the major complaints is the imbalance in the robes being offered, not the skill itself.
---
Not really a superiority complex as much as it is the fact that more dedicated players (not necessarily more experienced) in any given fanbase are more likely to involve themselves with *ANY* game's outside communities than the more casual crowd would. That's not to say casual players can't or don't, however it's more common for a dedicated player to do so. Additionally, casual players may feel less inclined to participate in being part of the voice of any given community (including something as simple as a strawpoll) because they fear their lack of playtime or knowledge means that their input isn't valuable (this is how I was when I first started playing OSRS)
---
Le Pen making the runoff was still a shock even if she lost.
---
Are you Italian?
---
Then you run into the other problem we have. Jagex can make as many skilling updates as they want, but they can't be better than the 
---
top existing methods. Which just makes them fall into the weird spot where it might a more engaging way to train, but barely anyone will do it because it isn't that great to do.
---
Can someone explain how they can shut down ur Internet for just going on a Website?
---
Nope at that point its reflex, we can iterate on this but I want it to be partly quick buzzing ability and partly knowledge. We will see how it works ;)
---
I'm sort of torn, honestly. Some of the content proposed with the skill seems pretty great, and would definitely be nice additions to the game.
---
But on the other hand... Do we \*really\* need another expensive bankstanding grind? Very few people actually seem to like the ones we already have so I'm struggling to see how shoehorning another in is supposed to make the game any "better".
---
warding gonna pass baby!!!!
---
Technically yes, but even if you do 4000 kills you still have the same chance of getting the pet as someone with 100 kills. You can‚Äôt just say, oh I‚Äôm 3k without a pet I‚Äôm dry now.

Poser.

Just use wildy hard to tele to the obelisk from your POH if you‚Äôre doing masters

---

---
A tongue in cheek propaganda poster is going to cause people who would have voted yes to vote no?  (x) doubt

Btw when you ask for biased or unbiased opinions only against a specific topic you are only asking for biased opinions. You might as well have left of the unbiased part.
---
Swamp land may also be inspired by swamp but I'm just throwing ideas around here.
---
Skill release days were sooooo fun back in rs2. I‚Äôd love to experience the hype again!
---
I would agree with you if I was totally against the idea, but I'm quite open as long as a method exists to Train it that's fun and reasonable. I don't want the entire skill to cater to me, but I would like a part of it to be appealing.
---
I too quit RS3 when the Wilderness was removed. I enjoy OSRS because of it's unique style and economy. I voted yes for Warding but am truly indifferent as to whether it passes. 
---
But I don't want to see OSRS stagnate. New content will come to the game, whether it's because it stagnates and Jagex takes control for financial reasons, or we find a better way for the community to compromise. The second option builds a better game.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs called skip question you indecisive pussy

I think tutorial island should also teach member skills. I remember it taking me forever to understand farming (yes I started playing when mobile came out).
---
Actually, if randomly selected then it's not a bad sample. This is large enough for many scientific polls. It also corresponds with many other random samples I've seen. For instance, Seerz polled his clanchat and pretty much everyone said no.
---
I see all your points and I like your post. Really curious to see how it all plays out. I‚Äôm in all different directions with a new skill but, change can be GOOD or BAD. The thing is you never know until after it happens. I think everyone‚Äôs worried we‚Äôll get a repeat of Runescape 3 but really this game is so far different already we‚Äôd be ok with or without warding.
---
Also, take my upvote. Use it! Lol

All he's done is given Kim a propaganda clip to show how much influence he has over the weak United States.
---
This game was brought back for nostalgia sake but moved on and is far beyond what runescape 2007 had. A good part of my runescape times back then and still today is getting a new skill, so much new stuff to do, explore, to match with existing stuff. I can't see why people don't want more content that would otherwise make the game stale and eventually boring to the point of people leaving.
---
They have made a stance: https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-update?oldschool=1
---
You will not be banned specifically for using a third party client.
---
Let‚Äôs just say hypothetically if 25% of the blayerbase voted no to warding. 24.5% of them would still play the game if it passed, even though they voted no and threatened to leave if it passed.
---
when the wheels are broken on the last load, i start depositing ore into my bank and if they still arent fixed when im near done with that then i get as much as i can and go back to mining. Repairing wheels is a waste of time and effort imo
---
I want to preface this by saying I haven't played RS (and OSRS) in over 2 years. I still lurk on this subreddit for the memes and after seeing how this place has been flip flopping on warding over the last week or so I wanted to chime in.
---
This thread title on how warding will still get changes after a yes vote and that it needs to pass to improve sounds a lot like brexit. People just hurriedly trying to get something to pass by saying details will get hammered out later on.
---
Look where brexit is now. My suggestion, as a bystander, is to improve on the skill so that it literally becomes a yes or no vote to the final product.
---
They're the ones who got annoyed with me.
---
This game is weird when you‚Äôre not an iron man. Congrats on the achievement!
---
Yeah. Most of this community is trash.
---
oh, look at the whiner, whining about skills we'll never get

---
cant look at my logs right now, will look at them tomorrow and see
---
Thanks
---
This is where i found out about it, cant wait to try it out Null
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of the poll. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want warding, for any reason at all vote no.
---
I‚Äôm very mixed about it personally, it seams like a good skill, that has new, balanced mage gear.
---
On the other hand I‚Äôd have to train another skill up to 80 lol
---
Fully agree. As a max cape owner i have no problem spending another 50-100 hours and 100-200m for another 99 but i have problem with the skill itself. Hopefully they can come up with better ideas for warding.
---
Rig is a braindead laughing stock of the osrs community especially on Twitter. Hes taking nobody with him cause people only watch him cause he degens on scape for hours

---
Honestly I think this is something that the devs should just add. Too many people use this game as a safe zone. I‚Äôm all for the concept of no micro transactions. Imagine being a dev who spent hours and hours on making a whole new skill and so on and the game community voted it down it because they want to keep the ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù of their safe zone, it would kill the motivation behind it. Most of these people complaining about the integrity of the game and keep shooting down new content are going to be the same people who are going to be the same people who complain about all the dead content and lack of new content. Maybe it should be pointed out the major lack of integrity when one person uses 7 accounts to vote.

Guthix created Gielinor, the Gowers made Guthix.

I don't think it is necessary really but i would like for you to obtain no xp while on tutorial island or get the xp reset once you arrive at Lumbridge.

You drank gamer girl bathwater, didn't you?

Voting yes because the no argument doesn‚Äôt explain enough why it‚Äôs a shitty skill: Truest biggest brain...
---
Math is a state of mind

Yeah I'm not critiquing EoC tho, this is Warding, and they did a good job. What's your argument here?

---
They did revise it a number of times and made a huge amount of effort taking feedback before polling it. It's not common for them to take multiple months worth of feedback before polling something. It's strange how they spent so much time perfecting it or getting the community to accept it before they poll it. I get it's a big update and getting feedback is important but it does seem like they want the skill in the game.
---
Well there goes my entire theory.
---
vote yes to pvp

Oh, alright. Gotcha. I retract my statement. My image search was not appropriately thorough.

There are intellectuals on both sides here what is this?

Wow
---
Statistically it's one of the more common ones, based on the Mod Lottie tweets (which I believe might be on the wiki somewhere).
---
Did they use the word "reluctantly"? That implies they want it to pass.
---
No worries just wanted to point it out.

They have a github where you can compile the code for yourself

Perhaps it's because it's all these American children have ever known, but it's possible to canvass with integrity. 
---
Trying to persuade someone through reason and trying to persuade someone through bribery are not the same.
---
If all you've (not you personally) seen is corrupt lobbying, then I guess it makes sense that all types of voter manipulation is wrong, but it's perfectly fine to try and persuade people to change their minds.
---
If you manage to play without being bothered by other production skills i really think you should not vote at all about warding, no one will force you level up warding, that skill could be avoided, especially because it's a production skill and you could just buy everything on the g.e( if your not an ironman).
---
If Warding hurts you- vote no, if you are not bothered by it existing- either skip vote or vote yes so other players could enjoy it, i'm not bothered by anything that has to do with the wildy or bossing, but i'm still not shooting it down just because it's not my cup of tea, i don't care if it exists as long as i'm not forced into participating in it.

---
yeah we're trembling with all 200 viewers they get combined when they leave
---
I hate this attitude.  It's the same as people who hate PvP and vote no to every PvP poll, or who hate PvM and vote no on every boss/raid poll.
---
If everyone voted no on things that don't immediately interest them, then there'd never be any updates to the game.
---
The best way to vote (for the health of the game) is to vote on 1) if the content fits the lore of OSRS 2) if the content fits the mechanics of OSRS 3) if the content would be fun for at least one segment of the community (PvP, skillers, slayerscapers, etc) 4) if the content is balanced and 5) if the content is fleshed out.  As long as those criteria are met, you should vote yes.  If you feel that 1+ criteria are lacking, then vote no.

you wouldnt say this if it were yes votes u degen

More levels to grind = more carpal tunnel

And that‚Äôs the ridiculously negative outlook that will kill OSRS, nobody cares if YOU don‚Äôt want a new skill, others do, and if the majority votes yes, then you get to suck it up and deal with it. Simple as that, but making a public post, then being toxic to the people replying to you just makes you look like an ass

Yeah but again, just because non oldschool things have been added doesn't mean everyone has to support warding or other non oldschool things in the future. For all you know, these people all voted no to NMZ, graceful, etc.

One click black jacking is bannable
---
That's not really enough tho. I could want it with certain things and without certain things but me voting yes right now does not mean tho things pass as well. Once it's voted yes it's going in the game at some point even if it ends up being 90% of stuff I don't want. Thus no vote unless I would feel that there's nothing about the skill that I would not want to see in the game.
---
zzz still replying zzz
---
I'm all for new skills being added as long as the content is there. 2007scape forever.
---
Just out right calling it a shitty skill for no reason sounds pretty tiny brained to me...
---
oh yes the classic "i logged in once 16 years ago and didnt play for 10 years so ive played this game for 16 years now"
---
The wonders of modern technology
---
TBH, if content enjoyment is what you are after out of updates, it may be the case that you'd prefer other updates than new skills. Also, I don't think it is so much that skills aren't ever engaging or exciting to train; some like Slayer can do this at times. But the reason skills will never have as much enjoyment as bosses or quests or the like is the aspect of grind.
---
If a new boss comes out, you can kill it 100 or so times, get bored of it, and go do something else; perhaps you'll never go back to that boss again. But if a new skill comes out, even if you train to level 50 and take a break, it is still something most players will feel a desire to continue leveling until they reach whatever milestone or stopping point they are after. And as you do the same sorts of things over and over, even the most enjoyable skilling methods will start to feel like a slog at times. For example, while Slayer can be fun, doing task after task as you begin to get repeats of ones you don't care for will start to get to you (like when I finish 35 Scopria and look forward to different tasks only to get 90~ Scorpia a few tasks later... Which is like a 1+ hour task).
---
So while I am all for having more diverse skilling methods to provide more ways to train and things to bounce between to cut down on repetition (e.g. Ardy Rooftop to Swimming to Werewolf then back to Ardy...), I don't think that will ever solve this issue for the sake of a new skill. While we can give new methods that vary in effort and engagement with different rates of exp and profit, the core of the skills will remain the same. And even if every skill could be trained through a minigame or minigame-like activity to make it more engaging, any new skill would still have to have the same monotonous core.
---
On that note, it is worth bringing up that Warding is offering to release with a minigame that would be a more engaging way to train it than the standard production skilling... Probably should have brought that up sooner. Still, that kinda situation where the core of the skill is another production skill and there is also more engaging content in a minigame is the best we can hope for unless the whole skill is more minigame like similar to Sailing (or Artisan even). So if Warding still feels too dull while offering alternate training methods like that, I doubt any new skill will feel exciting enough.
---
Why the robot voice?
---
How am i supposed to vote when i need 24 hours yet i already have 500+ levels
---
I could have sworn one of the questions asked if warding should be put in the game, and the rest asked things like, 'if warding is added, should X be added to it as described in the blog post'. I've looked for these poll questions and can't find them anywhere.
---
Regardless, there was a poll on warding, and it did fail, so they reworked it. I don't have a problem with that at all. I'm just not understanding why people are acting like that poll didn't exist, including one of the OSRS developers. Even if the poll never explicitly asked 'should we add this skill', if people voted no to every question about it, that is effectively the same thing. 
---
'what they presented was acceptable'
---
What they presented was the skill warding though...
---
You know they ip check for duplicate votes from alts right
---
Game died when the Minigame Shop was voted in and never added

You could get it on your first run or 20,000th the odds are exactly the same.

fun read
---
FWIW, I was in the same boat as you bc I think Slayer is mind-numbingly boring but I really wanted to get into raids and end game PVM content. I did end up NMZ‚Äôing my stats and I honestly think it was the right call since it‚Äôs not really restricted me from anything but maybe Cerb, Hydra and Sire. I‚Äôd only really really recommend it if you‚Äôre an Iron
---
Tele tabs/ charging orbs. At your level right now.
---
Look into getting the lunar spellbook for non combat spellbooks. You can make money from doing a lot of spells on that spell book
---
Perhaps that is it, but a survey is still not a poll and those results were never made public as far as I can recall. So claiming it has "failed multiple times" is absurd when you only know feedback given by yourself and others you talk with without any actual poll or even survey results aside from random community strawpolls or the like.
---
*Th-This really sucks...*
---
Yeah, you should be able to do it with those stats. As a heads up you'll probably only be getting 1-2 kills a trip, and maybe a few more if you do the flinching method, so it'll be pretty slow. But KQ Is one of those bosses that even with higher stats it's not really something you can camp for many kills, so you can start it whenever. 
---
I'm going to assume you're killing it for the KQ head/pet, but on the off chance you're trying to do it for GP I probably wouldn't recommend it - there's more profitable bosses out there.

But people have been able to calculate the time it takes to get certain pets, I haven‚Äôt seen one for jad tho
---
Simply put, yes I do desire more exciting skilling updates for the current skills rather than pushing a new skill, especially one that doesn't intrigue me in the least.
---
Yes and saw the video not worth
---
What site was it?
---
Thank you
---
They're voting because they don't want it. Isn't that good enough of a reason
---
The fact that you‚Äôre getting downvoted this hard for an opinion that‚Äôs well thought out and constructed (which is what I see a lot of pro-warding complaining about no voters not doing...) is just sad and indicative of how terrible this subreddit has been the past week.
---

You're.

Oh, I understand what you‚Äôre saying. Um... maybe. Idk. You do get way less points and XP if you‚Äôre using non-degradable armor. I think dharoks is the best for both, I could be wrong if some of the more recent expensive stuff gives better kill rate.
---
You‚Äôre probably right, but even still, you‚Äôre still gaining money, just less so than if you used non-degrading.

But what if I voted yes using all 10 of my alts

if this fails its gone buddy

It didn't work for Belgium

We have a spell to turn any item into gold. Why can‚Äôt we have a spell to take the essence of the item out and use it to enchant another?
---
Skipped. Want new shit to do, warding sounds like new shit, but shit.
---
Heinous cos you're anus
---
Nothing specific. Just a lot of hearsay on my clan chat about which rl plugins are ok or not. Apparently mousekeys are bannable per one of my clan mates
---
Working on these as well!

Warding reworks old content in great ways
---
To this day I dont understand this
---
You must be scared to lose that max cape, bro
---
Lol far from maxing
---
sure you can, make money.
---
Amen almost every alt has 1 day gameplay time
---
I did this too unironically. Decided my initial no vote was too hasty so I cancelled my dumbass out
---
&gt;but that doesn't mean it cant be improved and polled again if its close.
---
&gt; I said they should vote no and provide feedback.
---
If the poll fails, what makes you think they'll want to use the feedback? That just wastes time on something that the community doesn't want.
---
Instead everyone should vote yes so the devs have the green-light to put in the hours required.
---
If that's what you meant then sorry for the missunderstanding. :)
---
its unnecessary, the robes wont make big enough difference to matter.  The only people who will use them are pk'ers, so that they can risk even less then they do now for the select few that take mystic.
---
Idc if warding is a pile of shit at this point I just want any new skill
---
This sort of complacency with the lack of creativity is exactly why skills have stayed so mundane. I know im in the minority when I say this, but I think osrs has so much more potential when devs focus on engaging/unique content, CoX and ToB for example. I think skilling has a lot more potential than just afking and click once awhile on the same pixel, or doing that exact process faster. 
---
It does seem like my hopes for skillings potential is a crab shoot, so maybe I should just stick to raiding and pking I guess. 
---
I just don‚Äôt get this idea that skilling should never become engaging content because devs could only reboot the game pre eoc 2007 when all skills where as mundane as they are now.
---
it‚Äôs like an inactivity sweep that‚Äôs gonna wipe out lots of the inactive max capers, sounds like a win for active people

Saw u/Zuhaar's propaganda post and decided to join in on the good fight.

10/10, best meme ive seen
---
I have been reading over the blog a lot and have a good idea now. I agree with you, though. No one should vote without informing themselves first, which is why I waited to vote til I did more research.

He has max 100 viewers at any one time.  More than happy for him to take them away.
---
im reporting you to the authorities
---
also hi r/cursedcomments
---
Combat level? Slay level? Total level? And bank value? Ok, last one is a diss... That should be baseline for slayer advice. Or we will have blind leading blind.
---
As a raider, pvmr (as OP wishes) (which means u kill bosses for money) slayer unlocks most of the best combat money makers. I think slayer is super important and I would much rather kill a larger variety than camp crabs/nmz, till 126 cb.
---
Weeeeey!
---
Plus there‚Äôs a mini game with the poll that‚Äôll help RC
---
You completely missed the point. The only reason you can normally use a small sample size, such as what‚Äôs typically used, is because they go through a ton of work in order to make the sample as random as possible. Randomizing a sample is literally the hardest part of any form of polls or research study. A sample of reddit doesn‚Äôt meet that requirement in any way.
---
If the sample isn‚Äôt random, it wouldn‚Äôt matter if you had 90% of the population‚Äôs opinion, it would be useless in extrapolating the remaining 10%.
---
Damnit. \*unzips\*
---
But you can literally buy a bond for 4m and get another vote?
---
I don't watch any osrs streams. Though I do watch a few (Day[9] is my favorite)
---
I spend a considerable amount of my watching time on Netflix and other video streaming sites though.  I also frequently play other games while playing osrs.
---
And streamers are ultimately just a form of entertainment. Some people like watching them more than watching old videos. It's just a preference really.
---
you haven't played very long if this is you're view point on jmods

I guarantee you every woman who claimed to be "raped" by him are consenting gold diggers who just wanted attention.
---
If you don‚Äôt plan on training it why do you think it needs a new skill? Just wondering.
---
Firemaking 2
---
There‚Äôs a way actually, but it has some requirements. I dont remember them, but you can google it. You get construction xp crafting wooden cats in your tools room at your poh (cant remember the exact name of the room, its like a workshop) . Then you can sell them and actually make some profit. It‚Äôll take you ages tho.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Honestly just expand POH storage. Add a food storage to the kitchen, add storage kegs for potions which has been suggested a thousand times before (and also deals with the fact that potions of multiple different doses take up different bank slots), add a quest item storage to the quest hall, whatever. There's plenty of potential for more storage there.

If you want to do bossing, there are a lot of bosses gated behind high slayer levels.
---
I want to do it mostly for the pets.
---
they are too busy focusing on a dead ass skill to care about actual important things in the game, sadly they have terrible support too and usually they will blame you if anything bad happens even if they cause it
---
Didn‚Äôt get past you marginalizing all higher leveled accounts as sweaty neckbeards. You might be the problem not the solution.
---
I want this as a poster
---
No raids with just melee. You can do bandos, corp or zammy with melee.
---
This is amazing
---
Goodluck
---
Talk to the guy for more pieces he gives u more
---
The point is if I need to imbue something I don't want to be forced to train a skill I have no interest in to do it.
---
imma keep this here in case I find one online
---
I don't think anyone actually votes no because of nostalgia.
---
If there‚Äôs a 1% chance per kill, then after 100 kills only 64% of people will have the pet. 87% have it after 200. 99.4% after 500.
---
Wtf are you trying to get to 106 for, 46 is what you‚Äôre trying to get.
---
Helps to actually read it then. Can't help stupid :)
---
Yup, stop grinding vorkath with your dhcb. Go grind some good old KBD with your beautiful rune cbow, don‚Äôt forget to activate eagle eye!
---
Sorry, forgot to change your mind.

Regardless if he's right or wrong, that still isn't irony.
---
I pay I say.
---
I pay more I say more.
---
haha i know right it seems counter productive i saw kids buying yes votes for 100k at ge too lmfao
---
Which one of those would be easiest to solo?
---
But you should just train slayer, get mm2 done, kill demonic gorillas when you get a black demon task, get some zenyte shards drops, buy oak planks, do oak larders. Thats what I did. I have 83 con and almost maxed house now.
---
What‚Äôs your setup? I couldn‚Äôt get a kill using blowpipe because I was taking too much damage but I switched to dcb and praying range and got a kill super easy
---
Whenever you are not being attacked by snake pray mage to reduce damage from small snakes.
---
Isn‚Äôt there a plank spawn that‚Äôs heavily botted around there?
---
Why play an iron if you're going to get help from people? They should add an asteic to your character name.
---
straight from a private server, gross as fuck
---
You can always go and fight a profitable enemy like dragons
---
I personally train slayer with mage because iban blast gets slayer tasks done so fast
---
/s?
---
they have low attention spans anything they see they want 5minutes after its in the game they will want another one and be bored of this one(its shit anyways so i can understand that part)
---
EVERY ONE EAT
---
28+33+45 I need to unlock all 3 off those at same time homie
---
If the people wanted it.. it would get 75% or more votes.. Obviously not gonna happen so quit crying holy shit. All these brainlet lvl 80 ironmen whining.. Have you ever voted before?? Can't imagine yall voting in real life elections and whining to everybody about why they didn't vote for your party.
---
what‚Äôs your favorite song in game other than sea shanty 2

First one with 1 piece second with 2 and 3rd with 3

Because there don't live many black people in cambridge? Let alone black people with the right skills for the job.
---
i know just recoloured mystics and splitbarks with extra bonuses how original design
---
&gt;I'm sure that's something they have lined up
---
So what evidence do you have of this? If you're sure of it I feel like you should be able to lay out several sources showing that this will happen
---
I agree. Give me dungeoneering, it was actually engaging skilling content
---
The dissolving aspect is a very cool very useful aspect of Warding and it‚Äôs one of the parts of the skill they couldn‚Äôt just add to the game without adding warding. The whole point of adding dissolving to Warding is to help fund Warding training with materials easily obtained from every equipment item in the game.
---
Though they could add ‚Äúunsmithing‚Äù to smithing and ‚Äúdecrafting‚Äù to crafting, they wouldn‚Äôt have a secondary resource from the breakdown of items to actual warrant breaking down the items for those skills, rendering the mechanic dead content on delivery. 
---
It‚Äôs almost solely responsible for revitalizing the health of rs3‚Äôs economy and it will be helpful in maintaining the health of the osrs economy as more items are created and more current items enter the game.
---
How long does the warding poll last for?
---
If theres a crystal seed loot/reward in any way they are gonna crash hard. Theres already a ton in the game as well from zulrah bots so its pretty much just a bunch of people holding them gambling. We"ll see but i see them crashing hard on release
---
oh lol, that would make sense
---
Ya but never enough to unlock 28, 33, and 45 all at the same time :/ always give me between like 40 and 60 points worth of blocks total
---
Will do :)
---
Heart is good for Zulrah too
---
People don't hate new skills.. People just hate bad skills. If the Ideas from warding are so great they'll tie it in with magic/smithing/crafting/rc. Enchanting your armour would be amazing but guess what you can't even do that with warding.
---
?? He just keeps giving u more lol do u keep talking to him for more
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
He is 43 slayer.
---
most of the time the most profit is off the initial hype of a buff/change. As in within a couple days of the blog post releasing awhile back.
---
That doesn't include unforeseen circumstances but I don't think thats likely with these. Possible, but not likely.
---
U use the other part of the machine to change them into new ammounts
---
I thought he only gave more if you dropped em. Oh shit I might be real dumb
---
warding is shit change my mind and ive read blog
---
Anyone who's actually watched Rig and knows his humor can tell that this is a joke. I swear this Warding debate and vote is just like election time irl lol.
---
Problem solved goodluck
---
Oh I see. I thought they counted toward the total. 
---
So if warding passes with what would seem like less than 75% of the total (even though it‚Äôs not), people will misinterpret it and riot lol
---
....well then don‚Äôt do the skill, you have a choice in the matter. I‚Äôm truly surprised at the amount of people butt hurt but then suggesting Warding as a skill. I voted yes and if you voted no that‚Äôs your opinion and ultimately that‚Äôs fine with me. I‚Äôm just not seeing why everyone is in complete outrage at every little suggestion the devs make. I‚Äôm all for the concept of ‚Äúfuck micro transactions‚Äù. I‚Äôm just saying if I was one of the devs and everything I suggested would get shot down by the player base then I‚Äôd stop making shit and let the game die because eventually the passion to attempt impress the ungrateful player base and improve the game is going to die. The major lack of giving a shit about how hard the Devs work on making this content is outrageous.
---
Have you ever entered puro puro? There is 3 bots every world on spawns.

Not a big thing?

Dude that's huge I just started and it's intimidating seeing all the high lvl players here! Good luck with the b gloves!
---
If the people in favour of warding want to get it passed on the polls I'd simply get r/dota2 included in the vote and they wouldn't have a problem getting it passed.
---
Even better when the people from r/dota2 get angry they don't blame the devs they blame the supports.
---
I know but I started noticing it Thursday
---
It does lol and I cba with another 1 :) xp rates fairly high though
---
I wish more people saw it like this. Just today argued with someone else who said no to warding simply because he wants to max and warding would make it harder and more expensive. With logic like that we'd never get anything new.
---
You can expect around 2 bandos kills a trip or 4 zammy kills. However i do suggest joining a clan and pvming together. It is way more efficient and also more fun if you ask me :)
---
That's what happens when you dismiss the sandwich lady.
---
Could you describe what made you decide that?
---
well u voted no to their hard work...
---
Yeah I got an external one off of amazon. I‚Äôm having this issue with this new numpad.
---
I believe you mean cream pie...
---
Demonic Gorillas is less dependent on gear and stats than Zulrah since Slayer Helm + Arclight Bonus makes up for it a lot. 
---
Hydra is really high level Slayer so you'll probably have close to 99 combat stats anyways. 
---
DKS and Raids you'll need really high stats for definitely. 
---
Cerberus, Vorkath, and Venenatis aren't that level dependent but you need certain gear for them be really worth it, Spectral, Dragon Hunter Weapon, and Craws respectively.
---
It would probably be easier to filter out votes on accounts that are less than 24hrs and have not logged in since voting. Or maybe accounts that were given a bond for membership, voted and logged out and did not long back in within 4 days or something.
---
No
---
Either raid?
---
All of them
---
It would be incredibly stupid to actually code and make the assets beyond just the idea and concepts before it is actually polled.
---
Okay, im training my magic atm. Once i get it around 75 i think i'll do my melee stats
---
I voted yes
---
Even if jagex did anything about it (which they won‚Äôt), the damage is already done.
---
That's some big brain logic right there.
---
He clearly doesn‚Äôt lol.
---
I don't think he knows what a pyramid scheme is
---
\*h
---
Remember to stop making these stupid fucking threads no matter which way you're voting
---
Its not so terrible. The people with alts are usually people who have played the game longer. I feel giving them a bigger say isnt a bad Thing.
---
One quest goal at a time bud and you will gradually level
---
You seem like a bit of a rare cunt
---
Its just a meme pls calm ur selves.
---
Posting this to help out some lower levels looking to mix it up a bit and maybe profit off some early WC levels. 20k profit per invent, pretty fast and right near a bank.

Use a Kharyll portal to increase bank times. If you don't have this portal, then go to w330 rimmington from your own house to use another players instantly.

There needs to be a punishment for buzzing and getting an awser wrong or else you'll be inclined to buz as quick as possible no matter what with no repercussions.

"Everyun should be punished bcuz im too dumb to create an alt" "jamfelx plsss  \~\~\~\~ :'( "

sad... digBickGrayson
---
very sad...
---
Thank you! Good info
---
A copyright takedown isn't regulation though. 
---
&gt;jagex has also made it clear that no third party client is allowed to sell their client in any way (except osb) so thats more regulations issued by jagex
---
OSBuddy can, that's a dumb as fuck exception and doesn't actually mean anything because there's no way to stop it. Hence Runelite+ giving that stuff for free.
---
Everybody you don't like is a shill!!1
---
Literally just resubbed to vote yes to this. 
---
I‚Äôm sure glad I didn‚Äôt miss it like some people seem to think.
---
Atleast you‚Äôre gonna be loaded when you finish
---
i literally used a bond to login and a vote no, i have no intention of playing even on the 14 days remaining
---
Man I'm actually so bummed it's not gonna pass. It seems actually pretty cool
---
Honest question, are they adding more bank space. Idk know how people that dont have max construction are supposed to store their gear.
---
yeah I get that too, but when I see so many people commenting on Facebook that they've voted with 10+ accounts it's way past the point of giving them a bigger say, if you wanted to do that they could implement a system where if you have x amount of playtime your vote counts for 2 or something like that, but not 10x or more than other people like I've seen
---
Of course they would want something they worked hard on to pass.  Same goes for any poll of new content.
---
uhhhh question kinda vague sorry... but alllllllll the desired 99s aside..,  my end goal for all skills is the min req to complete all quest and all diary‚Äôs
---
I didn't even know this. 
---
My thinking was that if I don't think it's ready, I will vote no, and if I do think it's ready to be added to the game, I will vote yes. 
---
I don't think it's ready so I voted no, without knowing what was written here.
---
70 is a good point to stop as it is the requirement for saradomin godwars dungeon. At 76 you unlock the zulrah shortcut which is nice if you plan on doing that boss, but you can also access the shortcut with 71 agility and a summer pie. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to go for 70, then just try to get a graceful set before you stop doing agility, this will help with many things like questing farm runs and stuff. If you don‚Äôt go for 71-76 then after you finish graceful is a good spot.
---
Its a joke lol
---
lmao okay mate, your username is clearly an accurate representation of your mental state judging by your comments
---
sit kid, the adults are talking here
---
dungeoneering was a fun skill
---
Imagine osrs had a day and night cycal and the lighting logs provided light. That would be neat.
---
I feel like it'll finally pass seeing how the community is warming up to it. Sucks for max capers out there. Time to put in another 4 weeks of non stop 12 hours a day grinding I guess.
---
The same people who parrot that dungeoneering and summoning are rs3 shit but are ok with buyable rapiers/mauls/twisted (hexhunter) bows and have alts bring to them supplies and help dps bosses.
---
I made my first osrs account 55 days ago, and the first goal I set for myself was QC by song of the elves release. I'm ~1650 total level now, with 68/69 Slayer to do MM2; the last quest I need. The grind has been a blast, but I'm realizing it's bittersweet how I just rushed through all the quests in order to get them done quickly, and hit my goal. I'm not quite sure what my next goal will be for my account, but this time I'll be sure to enjoy the journey moreso than blindly holding the spacebar to get to my destination quicker.
---
Cant find any relevant information but how much am i looking in profit from blue dragons per hour with some decent gear? Note i also have 70 agil for the shortcut
---
They are removing fire making?
---
Bro this is the Mandela effect, and this is the very first time I've ever experienced it. It's far more trippy actually being a part of one. 
---
If you dont know what it is look it up!
---
Rfd after getting fire cape and abyssal dagger? Weird flex
---
What setup do you use for it?
---
I recently maxed and haven't touched either game until today to vote yes
---
An item sink and new training method would be cool, but that doesn't mean it needs to be this as a new skill.
---
Sure if you never want the game to truly grow
---
Yep you've got the right idea there
---
I think that's a matter of shame rather than a bias towards the intangible concept of 'no'. Nobody wants to admit to supporting an entry point for MTX, but some people might have liked the content and quietly voted for it. There's also the effect of upvotes/downvotes, which make any opinion below 50% invisible. Usually the 'yes' option is a majority(though sometimes not enough of one to justify its inclusion in the game), which makes reddit a hub for 'yes' sentiment and chases off 'no' people to other forums, but for the MTX poll, which was universally unpopular, the 'no' option was the most popular here.
---
I got it on both my accs at like 60 fm. Wish I coulda got anything but it.
---
I got this done a couple weeks ago with similar stats.  Got hit a lot (77 def) tp‚Äôd out to clan wars and ran back to finish her off.  It takes like 4 minutes for health to regenerate so you can restock and finish her off.
---
I think if I remember correctly only a small percentage of players participate in voting. The ones who do vote probably keep up more with the game and therefore most likey active on Reddit. Not to mention the game has 100k players and this sub has 300k subscribers..
---
Then dont add the titans/yak
---
And there would be for adding a new skill as well.
---
Kind of a dumb way to judge it being rare of that because 1-99 is so fast at wintertodt compared to other skills
---
It's the natural progression of allowing players to decide the complete and absolute fate of the game.
---
I don‚Äôt think a time of 2 minutes and 7 seconds is that rare.
---
Nice repost, I've probably seen this a dozen times on this subreddit now
---
When they were talking about adding a new skill the mods said that they would increase the level requirements for total level worlds
---
U dont have to do nmz to enchant or a stronger imbued but cant stack both
---
Ahrims decaying isnt a big deal at all to anyone really, accuracy difference is huge
---
i mostly do the fields east of lumbridge with the cows,chickens,and goblins, and the swamps south of lumbridge is alright too. at least for me. hmu if you're looking for someone to play with btw cuz it sounds like im at about the same place you are
---
I'll post picture in the AM but I use viggora chain mace, prims, pros, and more.

Tfw you misclicked alch 8000 hours into your perfect click uim

Chickens until max hit of 3
---
Cows until max hit of 6
---
Hill giants are rad. The ones in the wildy are usually open and very few people are in f2p wilderness. Wildy has double chance for keys
---
Moss giants are end game farming/training
---
Wouldn't it be more worthwhile to make a bait account and give it a ring of coins to get a skull-trick in, too?
---
Scape all day\*
---
It also doesn't adjust the higher you level. Im not sure what would be the most accurate way to determine what makes a skilling pet challenging but that's the statistic I know.
---
I don't understand what people have against memes being on this sub. Does anyone actually take it personally when someone says neckbeard? Most memes do have some form of discussion in the comments (even if everything is heavily downvoted) and theres a lot of people reminding and advocating for others to go read the blog themselves.
---
It's not letting me upload a picture, is there something going on or would it be more likely on my side? I've posted before on the sub.
---
No, you just have the option to imbue the ring with either NMZ or warding. Both options will create the same rings that currently exists. Also they don't degrade, same as the current rings.
---
My noob question but what are those bank tabs on the left?
---
I mean if you say no to 69 ur gay
---
It‚Äôs one or the other as ways to imbue the ring, it won‚Äôt stack.
---
True
---
How did it work? I know of the method with people doing it in their house and having people spec transfer to guy d2hing, then use pool.
---
Framed, Settled, Jakeyosaur, Torvesta, Solo Misson, Statistically Challenged
---
I'm hurting for you.. And myself.
---
Is it 73m or 73 + 75?
---
Not a noob question. Rune dragon, sire, and a couple others ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Reddit is for warding, Twitter and Facebook are against it. The fact that this poll is only passing by 76% on the pro warding site is yikes
---
If you have some higher stats train on hill giants and then on monks of Zamorak and grab the wine when they are all dead
---
I would drop 4.99 for that
---
Your hand appears to be covered in poop
---
Please
---
That sounds cool I guess. Considering I don‚Äôt wanna afk for 100+ hours at nmz
---
big same
---
I hope it all passes. I think it makes sense as a skill and will add a lot of content
---
Someone posted earlier that there‚Äôs a guy botting no to warding. Now there‚Äôs someone botting yes for warding. 
---
I hope I‚Äôm not the only one laughing at how ridiculous this is.
---
Add me in game bro Bag of Reef, my accounts too new to reply fast
---
Agree
---
That's dumb how a botter would vote no when it opens up a whole revenue stream lmao
---
I guess i won't vote then
---
I know, I love it. We get Prif release and we find out if Warding passed on the same day
---
I always do my shitty grinds on a long journey. Wiat at the airport? RC time... long train journey? RC time.
---
Way I see it, this is the best time to get the shit grinds done, I'm hardly going to be doing Vork at this time am I?
---
Exactly. Id be doing nothing normally. Might as well get some shitty grinding done
---
i mean 200 hours is not a lot for all the complains and low click intensity.
---
"not a lot"
---
Just filter game chat, the dragon spam is gone, the potion notification is easily visible.
---
Nice one Gz
---
Could be worse, I did 8200 kc trading in gloves/torches as I got them before it was known that you needed to keep them to get those seeds.
---
thats what i said
---
It's not a joke for you, It's for his followers
---
1. Lord of the rings online is a dead game
---
2. He slaughters dagannoth kings every task and it's a joke that he's become the lord of the rings when he gets the ring drops, Hence LOTRO joke
---
3. Rig is a massive troll and notorious for fucking around like this
---
  
---
Even without knowing who Rig is, it would only take 10 seconds of looking into LOTRO to realize he's not serious (15 Viewers at the time of my comment).  
---
Obvious bait relying on the fact that people would be too eager to lose their shit than actually look into what's being said, seems to be a common theme these days...
---
Whatever the result, I cant wait until this is over
---
They've done it before for many polls, if it fails with a close vote, they look at why certain people genuinely voted no and aim to adapt / improve the content to that.
---
I don't at all believe in voting yes for content you don't want or like based on the idea that after it passes the devs will change it.
---
Hey stupid! Yes you're right im not a maxed main. I'm a zerker and pures and mains can hit me in the caves. The difference is you get less of one type on total worlds
---
There‚Äôs plenty of people that voted for Trump and were well informed. Please stop bringing politics up just to get a jab in to the party you don‚Äôt agree with.
---
It took me 8280 kc to get my phoenix. Jagex doesn't consider the phoenix a skill pet so it doesn't get an increased drop rate after you hit 200m either.
---
new quest is good buddy. lvl 70 aint that high u can do it
---
How about no.
---
Yeah? Thats a lot since ur gunna need to do this for over 1000 accounts. 
---
Lets say its 80/20 rn. Its 50k votes atm. So 40,000 yes, 10,000 no. Even with 1000 accounts, its 40,000 to 11,000 which still passes. 
---
Im not sure how fast u can get the total levels, but thats a lot of hours to put into the game to have a very minor affect. 
---
Thats also 4b per poll. Or like 2.8 grand.
---
So where are the results?
---
He certainly didn't get 200m farming exp since it was possible to get the farming pet, so that's a pretty misleading way to phrase that.
---
Actually I don't care what you think. I read the blog last month and it said nothing about keeping the imbues at NMZ. Looks like they changed it this time around.
---
I don't think it's hated, rather the skill itself just seems to be an amalgamation of magic, crafting and runecrafting and could be split into those skills instead.
---
I also think that the ability to vote should be locked until your account has been a member for either 15, 30, or 46 days consecutively. Losing membership would reset the counter. It would help prevent the abuse of bonding alts just to vote. Just for a comparison of the cost, being subbed with bonds for a whole year for 1 vote per poll costs the same amount as bonding 20 accounts so you can vote 20 times on 1 poll. For large game impact polls such as a new skill this is very significant.
---
My baggette is ready
---
The Facebook poll is 50/50, Twitter 50/50, Reddit the most biased for being infavor of warding Is still only 76/24. It seems like it's going to fail at this rate
---
mainly on this cause i was excited for it and didnt want them to fuck it up too much but theyve gone and fucked up enough of it so that people who are out of date with info are voting anyways on stuff from blog 2 and the runefest announcement still
---
it can fail with the majority wanting it. 70:30 for example
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to vote yes to Warding. The implementation is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical game design most of the news blog will go over a typical player's head. There's also the theory of natural progression, which is deftly woven into this debate - the philosophy draws heavily from the ruminations of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer, for instance. The "yes" voters understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of Warding, to realise that it's not just a skill- it's a cultural revolution for many new players. As a consequence people who vote "no" truly ARE idiots- of course they can't understand, for instance, design aspects like dissolving and reforging which are loosely based on the economic theory of financial repression. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion when Warding passes by 90%. What fools.. how I pity them.
---
Wow, I if this turns out to be accurate Warding may actually have a chance.
---
177013
---
none of that happened and this post makes you look like a moron
---
This is r/2007scape, everyone and everything is a meme. I have not seen \*hate\*, but I have seen plenty of good natured memes. If you are insulted by memes, presumably because you are a veteran, then well are you new here? r/2007scape has been making fun if it's self for years now, veterans and all. A good meme is a good meme, and just because you don't agree with the ideiology the meme is pushing does not make it not a good meme. 
---
I personally am behind Warding, but still had a good time with many of the good natured memes on Twitter against Warding.
---
Even if you have to grab it from Bank it has to be a lot faster than the alternatives, where would you tele if you  didn't use scepter? I always tele to ge and run which is super slow.
---
Solution is barrage from north of pillar after Wave 50, run out to west side, making sure to put mager 1 tick afrt ranger, flicking mage+range+blob and kill mager. Diagonal safespot meleer if it digs before done with mager, kill it while protecting from range.
---
Can confirm. 700 chests deep on uim, only piece I need is guthan chest.
---
It's not detectable with runelite+ fyi
---
He blocked me for calling him a loser (lol) 
---
Hope he actually moves to another game, pure trash
---
Faxxxx doggy üêï
---
Shut up queer
---
It's just regular human beans with very huge penises voting no and neckbeards voting yes.
---
People who share my opinion=good
---
Everyone else=bad
---
Nah, RS3 is on a completely different codebase.
---
you're gonna be seething when warding fails LOOOL.
---
Not a bad idea. This rule would benefit the "neck beards" this sub is circlejerking against more so than anyone though, as this type of player is much more likely to keep other accounts bonded.
---
when they announced it, the mods were very energetic about it. they were truly passionate about it as a concept and when they talked about it being a skill that felt like it should have been in the game on release, it was delivered with a kind of sincerity and passion that made me believe it was more than just a job for them to develop this skill; its was a joy.
---
Still fails.  Sorry champ.
---
Very cute.
---
RL+ is opensource as well.
---
Is that a real thing
---
you can use the same phone for multiple accs though, are you talking about 1 phone number per account? lol
---
If it passes I just hope it'ss not a grindy money sink
---
26% =/= majority
---
Maybe after i get 99
---
Geological Latitude and Longitude too thanks also current body heat and medications. This is all to help pass warding I mean help you with your password:
---
Iron ore, it's like 900xp an inventory, a minute per inventory. Semi paying attention it's definitely a two day ordeal. I did it early in the morning and stopped late at night. I think it was for that semi new troll quest cuz you need 69 mining.
---
RL+ is more open-source than RL, you can go on both websites and compare the git lmao.
---
seeing as how some item models take 2 hours or so lets say go pa a dev his 2 day salary to get this done on a rushed job
---
Delete this cursed thread
---
Somebody in this thread already highlighted it. If you take into account the current results and the fact the skip vote doesn't count, it is 76 percent for 'yes'.
---
Ouch!!
---
i mean with full switches cox is still pretty relaxed, as long as you're not playing an alt. tob is superior in that regard where u can be pretty chilled and be pretty efficient.
---
Only reason I stop watching is the voice , looks like great content though
---
I‚Äôm 100% a nostalgia scaper, sucks that the few of us who actually do play this game for what it was in 2007 are completely silenced and shamed because kiddies want shiny new overpowered toys. 
---
Never do Raids, Zulruh, or Wintertotd. Most updates disappoint me so I vote no. Does that make me a brainlet? Maybe. Do I have deep rooted childhood issues which draw me back into the game I played as a kid? Maybe. Am I voting No on Warding? Absolutely.
---
because reddit is fucking garbage for any kind of actual discussion and as soon as people upset the majority they get downvoted so every subreddit like this turns into an echochamber
---
Because Jagex can't tell whether you're using an illegal plugin or not, the only way they'd be able to handle this is to ban all 3rd party clients. Until that happens, clans will continue to distribute and use shady plugins among themselves and continue selling them on the black market.
---
Interesting i see people hanging from agility obstacles and people cutting themselves with light reflection mirrors in the near future
---
/u/waterguy_12 would like this
---
Tbh I never really vote in polls and I thought that it failed previous polls by the way people are talking about it lol
---
Wow that's a lot of views. Almost as much as that 3d editing video someone posted of Thanos doing the snap in rs
---
If my suffering brings life and joy to others, is it really suffering? I don't think so.
---
God bless ya mate, may the outcome be what it shall, and let this game reign for many years to come.
---
anyone with $200 can pay Venezuelans to get maxed, if maxed is all you have to boost your ego. its more of a yikes than i thought.
---
Well luckily I'm not at 10k yet lol only 5k
---
I personally think it was all downhill as soon as his sketchballs manager steered him away from OSRS completely. "Deadman mode beta" was gold.
---
Why would I delete it if it's a legitimate petition?
---
It's open source and you can compile it yourself, how about you stop spouting bullshit.
---
So by that logic. If anyone was rich enough to hold 75% of all votes, the game should just be what they want it to be ?
---
Go north side barrage melee go east side kill bat focus mage till melee digs go refreeze go north side kill ranger kill mager kill melee
---
Do you see the irony?
---
No you weren't stop making shit up
---
For a new skill that‚Äôs game changing, it‚Äôs totally worth it.
---
I think it would at least be nice to have high graphics textures, lighting, and shading. No need to rework all animations and character models!
---
I skipped question one
---
Was a post here a couple days ago, not im, but still. Some guy alched his graceful and complained how jagex would allow to do such a thing (when he didn't turn on the alch warnings lol)
---
Retards exist
---
Lmao since when has warding been anything about integrity....
---
The toxic pro-warding shit on this sub has made me realize just how disconnected and casual the players here are.
---
He literally posts all over this thread.   This dude  is clearly taking this shit seriously lol.  Literally the guy has replied to soo many people and arguing about some dumb shit lol.   7k+ karma and only 60 days on that account too.   He has some serious issues lol.
---
Part of it. The game had balance. We didn't have people scaling Raids, supply delivery, prescouting, 3PC, etc.
---
top down skills aren't valid. Warding is completely mercurial and no one can explain anything about it, but they constantly tout the dev blog because they can't explain anything themselves. The yes votes don't understand the skill. The no votes understand that it's being pushed for the sake of being a skill, and not for any other reason.
---
The mining &amp; smithing update was fantastic. But you're probably talking about 20 betas ago.
---
Its fun because it gives you a goal, reward, exposure to new places/monsters, boss, increased damage (slayer mask)
---
Exactly this. I didn't want any new skill at all since it would slow down my Max cape. All I want is a 2277 account to ERP on in the Grand Exchange.
---
However, the reason to vote yes, for me, is how dedicated the Jmod team is for this project. It seems like they have great plans for it and its impact on the health of the game. I just hope that the skill will be super fast to level, or that I can just buy bonds to speed through it.
---
Second skill polled. First being sailing few years back.
---
No I totally agree it feels out of place
---
I hate how I can't press enter with this one and have to click on it every time.
---
lmao...
---
Lets make a bot that votes yes to warding and no to the actual content, feed him 100k accs, watch warding pass but no content for it lel
---
well a skip is basically xp waste so im fine with that
---
Using the words disconnect and server make it feel weird I don‚Äôt know how to explain sorry
---
Same
---
I never said there were no counterarguments. I said they weren‚Äôt offered. Reading comprehension 101.
---
Yea it is, but I spelled it wrong because I hadn't played in a very long time.
---
Can I uhh get a K Top plz. - Ironman with 650 chests. Just want k top
---
What relevance does an already existing skill have to do with warding?
---
This is classic whataboutism
---
That‚Äôs messed up lol
---
Why? Not all updates are equal. What about mtx?
---
Do you even know how you're supposed to train warding?
---
Yeah basically, except it's not cus people want it. It's because the people that want it can't seem to grasp that others have differing opinions and choose to insult them to try to make them look bad and invalidate their opinion. And they scream loudly demanding the toy or else they will throw a fit. And then I start to weigh the enjoyment I'd get from the new toy versus the enjoyment I'd get from watching losers online go apeshit, and I start to realize that the latter holds more value to me.
---
It is possible. But then we would have the discussion of "what is a skill". Because i reckon players would think that sailing is a minigame or an expansion, not a skill.
---
In fact i feel like sailing would get less yes votes now than it did when it was first polled.
---
Yes.
---
Shhhhh dude... you're not allowed to like Trump on reddit. Think of your karma!
---
 Why does it need a new skill so bad? Because the sweaty max people are bored with the game that has so much content? Who is quitting because of lack of things to do in RuneScape? It literally is growing still it hasn‚Äôt slowed down one bit. The main player base comes from returning players why would they want to come back to a game where they don‚Äôt even know what one of the skills is they will just think it‚Äôs rs3 all over again. I don‚Äôt get this obsession with adding a new skill as if the fate of osrs depends on it. why fix what‚Äôs not broken. Why can‚Äôt they focus on revamping mini games and rewards help out the pkers and pvm is always a safe bet update some of the broken skill aka fire making and smithing. I just don‚Äôt get this obsession. I like that they are trying to help the economy but you shouldn‚Äôt have a skill to fix something a skill should be a fun part of the game only created to be enjoyable not to fix a problem.
---
so if i roll a dice its either a 6 or its not a 6 50/50....
---
Why not as extra adition to construction?
---
In my whole osrs life i never voted. But because of how so many people FORCEFULLY tries to implement warding without respecting other players opinion, i voted no. 
---
I dislike grinding so yeah. 
---
And fk all the people who downvotes every anti warding comments, this is one reason why i voted no. You guys are toxic.
---
Weird that it first have to pass to get better, so we should just take a chance and vote yes then?
---
200m hp xp, but only if your other stats are lvl 1 with 0 exp each, but you get some warding xp for doing so... so gl on the xp gains.
---
Thank you!
---
Compared to not hiding poll results, streamers influencing their followers by threatening to stop playing if it passes, fucking reddit with their incessant strawmanning no-voters, altvoting really is a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things.
---
hello blizzard would like a word with you
---
They need the script to train fresh accounts to 300 total and then vote.
---
I'm afraid the latter is going to happen, IF Jagex wants to do something about it. Or Jagex just being Jagex, we'll stick to the status quo with these overpowered clients.
---
Didn't read the blog, voted no on 4 accounts. on a scale of 1/10 how pissed are you?
---
Sounds to me like you need a different clan
---
900k an hour? I must be doing something wrong.
---
Jagex's bew antibot/scam tool.
---
The game has millions of active players.
---
What a manchild losing their shit over a video game. üòÇ
---
‚ÄúFeel free to comment‚Äù 
---
Not when i get 1000 downvotes by pro warding players
---
So they're still devalued af
---
You just listed the last 99s I need... Thanks
---
[deleted]
---
Most no votes are informed decisions no matter what this sub tries to claim
---
Love your art.
---
But damn. You weren't even put on mage hand duty, just idle outside the portal lol.
---
You only need to comment the letter btw, i.e "H"
---
Honestly hope they just say fuck you and add it anyway, theyve put so much time and thought into it.  And for what? For meatball shitheads to just dismiss it like they do anything new? Sure it aint perfect but its a work in progress
---
Addy darts most likely, but if you can, go for rune knives. Double the cost, but also double the accuracy/str so it's just gonna increase your xp/hr for the same gp/xp.
---
The only argument for releasing warding in its current state (a state that can easily be transferred to other skills) is marketing. 
---
New skills bring hype, new skills bring more people, new skills spread via word of mouth etc. 
---
That trend, of releasing something half-baked and hollow specifically for higher numbers and the "infinite monetary growth" model, is not worth it imo.
---
Even 15 days would probably be enough since it would require you use at least 2 bonds on an account to vote on top of knowing 15 days before a poll goes live.
---
Those players people are upset about probably had alts with high enough stats to vote that they don't play but were willing to bond them up in order to vote. I think people who keep multiple accounts subscribed deserve multiple votes, but being able to keep f2p accounts and only bond them up to vote for big updates is unfair for the people who do keep their accounts subscribed over multiple months. They get to pay less and have more impact on poll results. That's just my 2 cents.
---
Dude I‚Äôm so sorry
---
D
---
As all things should be
---
Warding is crafting and smithing 2.0
---
Summoning is more useful in my opinion.
---
If you destroy that thing you should be able to claim back :( if you get killed/lose it you should have to earn it :(
---
The best part is hiding poll results was polled and failed, but for some forsaken reason Jagex gave into edit and Twitter and hid them anyway
---
I was on the fence but after seeing the memes and how the yes voters on this sub are behaving it shifted it to a no, it's not hard to believe because it happens.  
---
This sub needs to be closed really, just a bunch of low total casual players who don't understand enough of the game to be able to vote on meta changing updates such as warding.
---
I never got lured but anyone can easily fall for it because they don't expect trading someone in safe zone to push them into pvp
---
This makes me mad
---
This is poll manipulation.
---
With those stats, you may want to consider getting barrows gloves eh?
---
\&gt; it would still be in line with exactly what I said. 
---
Not at all, it's another explanation for why you're making that statement.  You're assigning a reason that was never there to your narrative - memes on reddit didn't cause you to vote no, you're using memes on reddit as a pretext to make you voting no feel more significant (you're not spiting yourself, you're spiting others!).
---
\&gt; If you can think back a month Reddit used to hate warding. 
---
I wasn't a fan of it either back then.  It's almost like the new blog demonstrated that the devs have spent a lot of time and are listening to valid criticisms of the skill, to the point that now many people have faith that the devs won't rest until warding is a positive addition to the game.  I see in your post history you're exasperated by this change of heart by reddit, which would explain why you're trying to assign some kind of malice to rationalize it.
---
Reddit isn't bandwagoning because we're bad people that are out to ruin your day lmao.  It's bandwagoning because warding is actually a better skill now (in our opinion), and a large portion of the resistance to it on youtube/twitter/facebook is provably irrational.  This reddit bandwagon often takes the form of various memes because that is the language of the runescape community.  It's unfortunate some people take things too far but our opinion being popular doesn't make us bad people, or wrong.  
---
\&gt; So I'm not really sure what purpose all those insults served 
---
No insults here, just assumptions that seem to be proved accurate.
---
Look, it's trying to communicate.
---
Nope I guess he really is handicapped.
---
What do people use now? Stopped playing some time ago
---
I tried looking again but how do you expect me to refind something that was a reccomended post at one point
---
Jad itself isn't difficult at all. The run up to had is arguably a much more difficult process due to the amount of input required and the overall length of the caves compared to the final fight.
---
when does poll end?
---
I want it to pass. I think it'll get close. But it's not gonna cross the line. I put it in 68-71 territory. We'll see.
---
The hype is strong. But 75 is such a massive hurdle to clear. And it just feels like there's too much energy against to get over the line with likely voters.
---
\&gt; This sub needs to be closed really, just a bunch of low total casual players who don't understand enough of the game to be able to vote on meta changing updates such as warding. 
---
Yeah I really think you've lost your right to complain about how people describe their opposition.
---
\&gt; it's not hard to believe because it happens. 
---
You're free to believe what you want, but I turned out right - someone who is saying the truth doesn't reply with "is what I'm saying really unbelievable?" (aka "how can you tell I'm lying?").
---
Also prayer is a skill to consider leveling. It's nice to have atleast 75-80 üôÇ
---
Yeah, people are morons. Maxed people spend most of their time bank standing and playing alts, they are actually good at the game, another 13m xp isn't seen as a negative to them, it's something to do.
---
Some might, but not the majority. The whole 'maxed people vote no because of capes' thing is such a noob narrative...
---
You're focusing on one aspect of the skill. There's a bankstanding component if you choose to train it that way. You're neglecting to consider the ramifications on what is being doing during the bankstanding.
---
1. An item is being taken out of the game
---
2. a separate item is being generated in the game that isn't GP from alching
---
OK but aside from orange man bad, why couldn't Obama or Bush or Clinton or Bush achieve this?

Dude she's decent and she's forward in tinder terms that's like finding a fucking pot of gold
---
I got scammed too but you know what it was a learning lesson and now a cherished memory because it taught me how to take responsibility and understand the game more. I did not blame Jagex for the one bad apple that did that to me. I realized that not everyone has the best of intentions with everything in life.
---
I still preferred that way of trading. I felt like an actual merchant. Like I had my own business and how much I made was reliant on my ability to be a good businessman. People started to know me as the ‚Äòguy who always has partyhats‚Äô. I gained friends along the way. It made trading a skill of its own and I miss it dearly. 
---
The power creep was slower. The game felt more methodical. I felt like the world was alive and there was real human interaction to be had. It was easier to make money.
---
Ok.

When. Stay positive bois.
---
It's an exit poll...
---
They should remove exp from nightmare zone completely, just make it a grind for upgrading random crap only
---
All that shit was interesting cause it's new. Herbiboar and blast mine is the same shit it just look different. Don't kid yourself into thinking you actually like it cause you "enjoy it" for some intrinsic quality they have. Same point and click story we been telling for years. It's all just leveling up doing something different.
---
I want them to poll its removal and actually put the rewards into meaningful content - like warding.
---
There's literally a copy of dungeoneering added with the priff. update. It's called "The Gauntlet"
---
I'd say so, yes.
---
Bump
---
In the osrs poll skip votes are counted. The strawpoll is passing with 77% essentially.
---
10 seconds is too long. Do 7. You can Google on another monitor within 10 seconds easy. 5 seconds to Google 5 seconds to type
---
No trump no!
---
Sailing can just added as transport.. oh wait there is teleporting already.. hmm
---
Disagree with the other guys. The reason they made 2007scape was because the game was great back then. You need to be cautious when adding loads of new content because before you know it we'll be playing rs4. Or rather we won't be playing because it won't be the game we love. As it stands the game takes about 365 days play time to complete (max etc) and that's not as an iron-man or harder. So it's not like we're short on content.
---
Warding threatens the original game we love so much imo
---
here we have the average no-voter putting themself on display
---
The only reqson i unlocked broad bolts fletching

As of 2016 the U.S. is ranked 12 for highest % of obese adults. Of the top 10, only one country has more than 200,000 citizens. Rank 11 is Kuwait (37.9%) with ~2.9 million people and only 1.7% more obesity rate than the U.S. (36.2%) which has ~329 million people.
---
Since you're so smart you should be able to do some simple math to figure out that the "leader boards" don't give an entirely accurate picture.
---
&gt; Could be the niche for people that wanted dungeoneering. 
---
No, those people would just vote no because it is not dungeoneering. Just like you likely are because warding isn't sailing. Stop comparing skills and just vote based off the merit of the skill that is being polled.
---
Scorpia, kraken, but best i guess is barrows
---
Ill take 5 memes plz
---
How can people be so easily baited. 2 mil? If it was like 200k I might actually believe it
---
6000 redditors who are pro warding voting in a poll 
---
Cant get 75%
---
But according to you its magically at 81% - this combined with all the people voting no with multiple accounts .
---
I'd say Trump's dick is deep in your mouth, but if that wasn't figurative, you'd pretend to gag to not hurt his feelings.
---
My god please tell me you‚Äôre trolling

r/hydrohomies aren‚Äôt wet, they‚Äôre **H** **Y** **D** **R** **A** **T** **E** **D**

Train those combat skills while slayering. Also if you'd like to take on strong monsters, and go pvm I'd suggest training ranged. A lot of strong monsters can be taken on with ranged.
---
On the skilling side: Construction, hunter, farming and agility
---
No fucking way, 4chan,facebook and twitter is against it, reddit own poll couldn't even pass it. The only things that pass 81+ are things that doesn't get discussed  so much
---
Muh conniptions
---
Thank you for that!
---
Which would you say would be good for me to start on with the lowest risk?
---
HS?
---
There are some similarities, but it isn't quite the same. 'The Gauntlet' is more of a highly accelerated Ironman account, without drops or progress carrying from game to game. It's also a solo mini game, whereas Dungeoneering can be done in teams, which is preferable to most players.
---
It doesn't really matter how many people want it, the time investment to make it isn't worth it. Jagex said it would take them a year to make it.... which means no updates for a year outside of HD. People cry when the weekly update is bad can you imagine the whining of a year of no updates?
---
The only real reason to vote no is that max cape becomes a little harder to get, which could be a good thing since it adds more prestige to it if you look at it that way. It adds more content to the game overall, most which will benefit the the game.
---
And it's very much not like summoning.
---
The most grindy game in the industry
---
Beat me to it
---
Desk mat. Custom made artwork that took time and money. Printing that took time and money. + Them making a profit. The price isn't that bad
---
Nice
---
Everything that needs training
---
Loool well that makes him seem pretty shit but the most iv ever had is around 30 mil so both numbers are beyond my reach for a while üòã
---
You cant make that opinion unless you only play what was in 07 since the original game you loved isnt what osrs is currently anymore
---
Believe me they aren't rare around here
---
Barrows easily. 
---
Kraken is really easy, but u need high slayer level so yeah.
---
Barrows are really a great way to start on bossing
---
will they add diary tasks that require warding? if so then im voting no, but otherwise... i might consider, go on warding lovers, now is your chance to gain a vote!
---
Get the vorkath one
---
what i'm saying is you're leaving out hundreds of thousands/millions of players that dont use social media to look at rs stuff who won't be swayed either way by other people, that's why it's currently at 81%, it was 82 last night but i don't expect it to go down below 75 so enjoy warding.
---
Yeah ok boomer
---
If it had to reach 75% none of them would win.
---
is the amount of facial expressions beardie makes just odd to me? or am i the weird one
---
You could make runes sometimes break during creation and buff xp to make it less terrible. That fixes both and only leaves people who think it should be awful because it's always been that way.

Pretty shit logic. Imagine if someone on the team had spent ages designing MTX promotions. Let's just fuck the polls and add it anyway haha xD.
---
I‚Äôm voting no on 10 alts boiiiiiii neck beards for life
---
fucking allegiant needs to step up
---
Close enough tbh.. i'm sure it will feel similar
---
just wait &amp; see
---
"It's not a joke for you, It's for his followers". That's a good point on perspective. I kind of forget that just because I can see it doesn't mean I understand or know the full context, because I need to account for other factors such as the audience and environment of media to understand what I'm reading. Thank you for that.
---
So guessing you didnt watch the video on the warding post ?
---
shouldn't it be fun to get another 99 for those people that can't get any more levels in any skill? i dont know... just a thought
---
While at a high level I understand where you are coming from, I don‚Äôt think its a reasonable thing to consider a personal detriment. If Jagex had an objectively ‚Äúbetter‚Äù skill (which I personally think is silly because thats not really an objective thing), do you think they‚Äôd hold it back through warding instead of giving us the ability to vote on which they pursued first, if they would do both at all?
---
Also, with the amount of effort and work they‚Äôve made on this, before its even been voted on and while producing other content, I think it doesn‚Äôt add up thinking that this would prevent them from doing anything else. On top of that, at some point if every proposed skill were to be voted no on for the reasoning you describe (which is possible because some will always want a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù skill), then that would be the point where they change their focus away from skills and the game stagnates in that department. In other words, if you want other ‚Äúbetter‚Äù skills, you should consider voting yes to show Jagex that this is a possible avenue for the game to grow.
---
Don‚Äôt even know who this pussy is.
---
&gt; That trend, of releasing something half-baked and hollow specifically for higher numbers and the "infinite monetary growth" model, is not worth it imo.
---
Now where do I remember this from...? *Hmm*
---
Oh rs3, that's right.
---
No its the same thing however you spin it, you're telling people they have to be informed to make a decision, but if someone approaches you on the street and you say no without reading it you're therefore uninformed, does that mean you cant say no? Of course not. YOUR opinion is what matters in a voting system, fully informed or not, thats like telling people if they dont read everything transcribed to them in an election theyre dumb if they dont vote the se way as you, its almost asif people have differing opinions or core beliefs...
---
Whatever that girl is looking at she is MIRIN‚Äô hard.
---
1. When you get an xp drop
---
2. You should decide what attack style you're going to use next after an attack and put the boost prayer on, then switch into that gear and change prayers if needed.
---
3. Put your tank gear on and eat up
---
4. Practice
---
5. I don't like it but I expect people to do it when it's for gp
---
&gt; Don't play anymore
---
&gt; Don't wanna lose max cape so votes no
---
Understandable. have a nice day
---
Why do we need a 20-40h bankstand buyable which overlaps heavily with skills already in the game? 
---
Rather they go back to the drawing board and come up with something truly unique, like sailing, if we are to add a new skill.
---
What are your gripes with warding and how can it be improved?
---
That's only true when not using salve (ei). With salve void is always better
---
Lmao, what are you even talking about?? Crying that he‚Äôs broke and can‚Äôt afford a lawyer and taxes while living in a ‚Äúmansion‚Äù for 2 months before getting evicted that was supposed to be for at least a year? Hahahahahahahaha- he used to pull 30k+ viewers now he‚Äôs lucky to get 2k. Genuinely curious what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Hmmmm, "The magic slowly seeps out of the cloth" something like that?
---
I guess I‚Äôll take 1/4 of a good career
---
change bad
---
swamp man good
---
Honestly you are fine using just trident on all bosses. You can also use range against ahrim and melee against karil if you want more dps. 
---
You may consider using ancient magic freezes so you can kill the melee barrows brother at a distance. 
---
I am max combat and this is how i usually do it:
---
Go dharok (pray melee and hit)‚Äî ahrim(pray mage and hit)‚Äîkaril(pray range and hit) (by this time i am out of prayer or low)‚Äî kill the rest of the brothers(freeze and then hit)
---
However, from a young age we are taught not to speak to strangers and informed on the dangers of speaking to said strangers.  So just like you can find a way to make it irrelevant others can find ways to make it relevant.  Which is what OP did and you‚Äôre desperately trying to be understood before understanding, which I might admit, might be a stretch from me, but it‚Äôs how you sound.  Also there is no need for profanity lol.
---
You use void with salve
---
Just do what i do and sit on the sidelines with a joint and some popcorn.

I dunno dude, the my interface on mobile is already pretty squished hahah
---
Turns out that in the blog, it mentioned how much pain this cat is in due to illness/sickness, and it‚Äôs about ending the cats misery rather than keeping it alive.
---
How do you feel about the cat now?
---
Nah I haven't come across it, do you have the link by any chance?
---
Where I‚Äôm from a big grassy hill like that is a buried heap of the city‚Äôs trash lol so inspiring

Thanks for your permission, just did it on the main plus alts.

Oof big oof

Look at the front page of this subreddit and tell me there isnt a better description for it
---
Pff this isn‚Äôt RS3
---
Revolutionary stuff mate! Thanks for sharing!
---
They‚Äôre about to try and add a rs2/3 god to the game so...
---
Voting no btw! I dont wanna kill the game yet
---
And you're not
---
There's none, which is exactly my point that we don't need another skill that's exactly like them.
---
gz enjoy bloods ;)
---
Yeah that'd be appreciated since you think I need to calm down and then start making unfounded accusations :)
---
Haven't tried but I have seen some killing Rex (the melee DK) with mage only and quite low stats.
---
Yeah west bank
---
Verac's skirt + DFS
---
I understand what this guy is saying. Stop thinking of your own agender and read what he is saying very slowly. It does makes sense. I don‚Äôt believe he has viewed the statistics cause he would have posted proof. But the explanation makes sense. There‚Äôs way more players than just reddit. And why are you quoting 4chan lol it‚Äôs been full of kids since 2009. They have no idea
---
Damn better cancel song of the elves then
---
Q
---
For no-voters like me this wont sell me on voting yes. The issue is with the core skill, not the finer details of balancing the rewards etc. 
---
They can't rework warding to, for example, be a gathering skill or dungeoneering but with the rewards from the latest blog.
---
I voted for trump because I liked his name
---
&gt;that's like ~~finding a~~ fucking a pot of gold
---
Could very well just be a throwaway account.
---
You're the reason the game will eventually fizzle out and die. You're clearly never gonna max anyways, why not make the game healthier?
---
Peste
---
Block the task
---
I bet you and the other guy don't even have fire capes and just watch Rendi do it on lvl 3s on YouTube lmfao
---
Make sure to bring many stamina potions to the mm2 tunnels or else you'll be doing a lot of waiting and it'll take forever. Other than that is was a very fun quest. I liked mm2 more than ds2
---
Agree 100%, and it's good that Ash responded to make it clear. I hear a lot of people saying "the community doesn't want Warding." How do we know that yet? Which community? Maybe the Reddit community doesn't or one particular CC or some group of players but who's to say the overall player base doesn't want this before we've even had a poll.
---
How is popular voting a form of censorship
---
Sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to say they should. I only meant to say it would be easier to do it another way.
---
Idk can i vote on multiple alts for this poll?
---
It did tho ü§î
---
i mean, in pvp aspect, it would give in clanwars or multiarea fights more tanky alternatives to magers. Dont have to use Torag to cast barrage that has negative impact on magic bonus -- now with like Bloodbark armour, not only can u look ballin and tanky as heck -- it actually benefits magic casting.. 
---
I really dont see why people are so against it, max capers and nostalgiawhores aside.
---
Ive played pre 2011 when summoning and dungeoneering was a thing (though i was more around during summoning, never played during dungeoneering) - and they were fun additions to do godwars (speaking of pack yacks and such). 
---
First time they introduced it, it didnt seem very well thought out, but this recent dev blog on it got me really intrigued in it. i hope it passes tbh.
---
wtf i love warding now
---
Twitter has been almost exclusively a handful of high profile accounts, not really the general player either, but we‚Äôll see. Right now from this exit poll it would pass and we‚Äôre at almost 7k votes with the % almost being the same since 2k votes.
---
how do i do that? and im already at them. they drop alright stuff i make a lot off them compared to what i was killing before
---
These things are already in the game, so removing them are a bit troublesome. Noone actually likes the content, which is why the average non-combat skill level is so low. Its not fun and it doesnt unlock money makers. Besides from a capes and pets, theres barely any reason for 99 fishing and mining. Agility has some use, but its just way too tedious for people to care
---
Get yo mage up
---
Warding is coming to the game. May as well get over it already and call quits on the hate. Its coming.
---
Fetch me noose, an going to the gallows

But quest requirements

please dont vote

Whaaaat? Isn't it? Oh dear I'm in the wrong place again.

Jokes on you, I didn't vote
---
üò¨ dont you have roblox cash to buy or something
---
So talking about potentially one of the biggest game changing mechanics is bad? I think you don't deserve the clan tbh.
---
Nah not buying it
---
And to think this has been around since release.. wtf
---
Im knowledged about every single poll since the release of OSRS, I bet you arent. I know patterns and I know when things fail and when they dont. You dont. PvP updates always fail the poll, how did you not know this? I know you were completely ignorant but you should at least know this, even casual players know that PvP updates fail all the time. And people hate content being pushed into wilderness.
---
Why would you swipe right on a 3/10?
---
He has mentor rank I believe
---
Just block them. Their drops are pretty crap unless you get a visage and they're super slow.
---
You can block them at your slayer master.
---
Yes.  So you're telling me 100 accounts trading money to one mule every hour, day, etc isn't immediately caught by Jagex?
---
Right that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying some mentors are trash lol
---
Those games would change the flow of regular gameplay enough to completely change how most players change the game. This is a game that spawned based off of a conservative mindset, there's literally 0 chance that something like that could be put in game.
---
When people say shit like, "if this doesn't pass then nothing will," they're absolutely right. This is a super low-impact skill on regular gameplay, but it's not irrelevant. It may not end up being the best skill, and you may disagree with parts of it, but if literally anything will pass it's going to be this.
---
Here I am sitting at nearly 400 kc and haven‚Äôt gotten anything other than prayer scrolls!

---
Dude if you're using whip @ bandits and having to switch to guthans to heal then it is not as AFK as nmz. At that point you aren't really afking in the sense that is being talked about here, you're just playing runescape and training at bandits. 
---
NMZ is literally drink some absorb pots and forget about runescape for 20 minutes, at which point you drink some absorb pots again. Even if you don't stay overloaded its twice as much xp per hour as any equivalent... but you can go ahead and click an overload once every 5 minutes to up your xp rates aswell. 
---
Yes of course the main complaint about NMZ is the xp rates. This is runescape we are talking about after all.
---
See you on the losing side in a few days, not even on reddit, the yes side it passes strawpolls
---
1 in 33.3 million i think
---
Whats WDR?
---
no ragrets
---
Yes because warding doesnt change how you can obtain and use current game content.
---
There's a poll like this on the front page of this sub posted already.
---
It‚Äôs an exciting new skill the breathes life into the game and keeps it from being stale, it‚Äôll provide new meta‚Äôs for pvp, pvm and skill training, hell now Ironmen arent stuck with mystic till then grind out barrows for Ahrims and eventually get to late game and grind our ancestral.
---
Broke my leg from a skiing accident at the start of June so the weekends i was getting like 500k exp a day so wasn't to bad!

Ghrazi rapiers would crash even more if they're brought in as tradeables. Maxbabies would fucking lose it.

OK.

im 1/3 of the way through and that rune stuff is a lot of money for me lol
---
The 75m cash was not part of the grind; so just 73m cash generated from the mining grind.
---
Imo the teleports are useful, but it's not worth getting right now, so this change would be really, honestly made just a change to the normal staff not even an imbue
---
It's almost like this entire game was made for the nostalgia alone. You fuckin guys literally missed the point of the game being brought back.

BIS not sure but bunch of weapons do.

godswords +8, verac flail +6, dragon mace +5, and all the other god weapons 1-2

Join Scuffed Boi clan

So let me get this strait.  The devs spend months tooling,  and retooling the skill on paper.  Then they ask for feedback from the community.  The rework thr idea more.  They ask for feedback again.  The do even more reworking.  They're actively engaging with the community,  to make sure it has what will appeal to the largest percentage of the playerbase,  with what the players want in the skill.  And now they're polling it so hopefully all those players get a skill that was more or less custom made for and by the community... 
---
... And you expect the mods to be apathetic?
---
This is kind of a hot take, I agree. I think my view stemmed from a developers standpoint where continuous feature updates are necessary for justifying your job, which means that a new skill is more than just a new skill, it's a precedent and a foot in the door.
---
I don't know though, there are parts of the skill other than the armour which I agree with. Essence pouches and imbues don't feel like they're an integrated part of the game, and this is a good way to make them a bit better.
---
Also, there is the argument of 'chicken and egg' in why magic armour is unnecessary in osrs. Is it not used because it's inherently worthless, or because the game has evolved in a state where there aren't a whole lot of options. Hell, two of the things you listed, lunar and splitbark, are used by basically zero people in any situation.
---
I'm still voting yes, I think that osrs deserves to see what the current developers can make out of a new skill, and it's literally this or nothing.
---
Engine work should never be an excuse. If it requires engine work, then do the fucking engine work. How is that an acceptable excuse?
---
Also please update underCroft so it will run on the new iOS software. I played that game so much until I had to get a new phone.
---
Good, with the proposed changes to it, it would have made Lost City trivial at best
---
If this has been around for so long why is there no information from Jagex about it and how to avoid it, why have Twitch not stepped in, etc. 
---
I don't think I was playing back when they released 2FA, I didn't know it existed until now. Perhaps they should prompt users to enable it as other services do
---
No, cause the devs can always refuse it based on moral objections. Remember even if you work for a company a company (outside 3rd world countries like saudi-arabia, china and the US where employer rights are just ignored) if you have moral objection a company cannot force you to do something, nor can they fire you over the objection.
---
I'd have a strong objection when I suddenly have to work for someone who earns money by modern day slavery of girls.
---
You see this same problem with every kind of voting especially over here in America. People making ignorant concluaions about something they think they're right about. I read the blog and I'm going to vote no, but at least inform yourself and don't just to conclusions blindly in every situation in life.
---
Have you tried the 'call follower' option?
---
Nice, ty
---
This is honestly becoming more work than it‚Äôs worth. Adding the skill is creating a huge distraction for the devs when they could be better the game as it exists already. I‚Äôll take a poll question over whether or not some of warding‚Äôs features should be added to crafting and magic after this initial one fails.
---
No xp reward for finishing. All you'll get is slayer points.
---
I didn't vote yes to the ammo pouch thing. Runes are the ammo and the spell strength is based on that.
---
Got all my mournings end part 2 quest items, mourners outfit, rope, bowls of water, buckets, spade, knife, chisel other random stuff, crystal seeds, crystal keys, teleports to everywhere imaginable, stamina, prayer, brews and restores along with food and some general hybrid combat equipment all sitting in one tab ready to go on launch day.

Sit in tank gear and spam click to get return hits, alternatively you can catch a freeze if you catch them on tick. It's annoying but it's not you have no chance whatsoever...

Discount skips and it's passing 77%

Pretty sure Ash is just a cool guy, nothing to do with his nationality.

Yeah nothing happens. I'm not trolling man... I'm being serious.

They've had messages ingame on the message of the day warning players in the past. They have tried multiple times to get twitch to do something. Jagex did create something to get rid of them theirself. Hence why they useally dont last longer then 5-10 minutes. But twitch just doesn't give af
---
:D
---
How'd you lose it?
---
Lol the last time they used this terminology was EOC. Do we really want the company that can‚Äôt go a month without accidentally coding in a major glitch to be trusted with adding a whole new skill?
---
Yup. If an oil sheik enslaved people, used those profits to purchase a bunch of memberships on alts, he would indeed have a bigger democratic voice than your average player.
---
Spending 540m worth of gp on membership alone has a price too
---
Exactly. Not looking good. It‚Äôs sooo close to 75%. You know there‚Äôs a margin of error right? And on top of that Reddit is super pro-warding and it‚Äôs slightly passing. This doesn‚Äôt look good at all.
---
F2p runecrafting buff üëÄüëÄ
---
No idea. That's the problem.
---
You can log off and take a break in between any wave during the fight caves.
---
Uhhhhh normally people do 1 kill then teleport house, bank, then fairy ring back to kq and repeat
---
1 kill per trip.
---
Never used tars lol
---
&gt; and it's literally this or nothing.
---
I love Sailing, the idea of it. I want to see it put in the game very much.
---
The way they pitched it with the low effort they put in, and the way it seemed to scope out more or less as just an area unlock feature named a skill, I would have voted a hard No to. It looked not thought out, not like I envisioned Sailing to potentially be.
---
72% vote. Just shy of passing. That's when the community was even more conservative than it is *now.*
---
Saying girls are ugly on the internet won't make you have any sex lol!!!!
---
Doesn't that just make the pass mark 70% if you get another go at it?
---
You should walk to the bank with the heavy ores and run to the mine with your empty inventory for even more profit!
---
and they worth finishing? im already decently into the task and just afking it anyways and the loot is kind of adding some money
---
Dude,  every pro warding post has almost nothing but anti warding comments.
---
In order to play enough to earn that much, he's still losing out on a ton of time rendered useless just to maintain that many accounts.
---
To be fair the goal is any pet from PVM, after 5k DK kills I'm prepared for the grind haha

Wait for quest guide

Smarter than your mother was for keeping you around
---
It's not in your bank?
---
You don't need to be a member for a year to vote. You only need 45m if none of your accounts are members.
---
Except mage gear is already made in crafting, and runecrafting is even used to fuse magical energy into the cerb boots. There's definitely a spot for it.
---
Did you insure it?
---
&gt; Those skills would change the flow of regular gameplay enough to completely change how most players play the game.
---
That's precisely what a skill should do. If anything the problem with sailing was that it would be tucked away in the corner of the world and NOT do that.
---
As long as the 4 space rune pouch doesn't pass I don't really care what happens tbh
---
Not a huge jump in exp, it's just more AFK since you don't have to click like crazy to maximise exp rates
---
Ok
---
Orange man bad
---
I think it's a little bit of a false equivilancy because (assuming you're comparing the oil sheik to a bot owner) people aren't actually getting hurt. Also, not everyone buying multiple memberships got the funds for it "illegally".
---
I don't think it's a perfect system, but given what this game is and how we "purchase" it, I think it's the most fair.
---
Soooo much has change from the first three versions, like battle wards those were absolute shit.
---
its getting really annoying ive had it happen to me like 4 times in the last hour now.

Can't wait to see Mike in BCS season 5 fuk

Np man I always have a binomial distribution open to calculate how bad my luck is lmao

Does it take their whole week? Or does it make their hole week ;)))

I think polla should be run for 6 days, with the results on the 7th day. That way everyone gets a chance to vote during the week

*You‚Äôre (you idiot)!
---
public off
---
@ all the nerds who camp pray melee
---
If it turns out to be a problem, they can adjust alch values, right? It'd suck a lot for people who have a ton of mystic rope tops for whatever reason, but if it's to not destroy the economy it might be a net positive to the game as a whole. Especially if they give a warning in advance, that way the current value of mystic robes can be preserved via alching them at current rates
---
Only steelman sorry
---
That argument doesn't work because I hate skills like farming, runecraft, agility but I don't want them removed. You just get the requirement for the quest and move on.
---
Thanks, they should really put this on the wiki page
---
That's what they'll have to do, in addition to either removing it from shops, or changing it's cost in the shops.
---
We seem to misunderstand each other, I was calling out the original comment of the thread, not dragan
---
It goes on your thumb and you use it to pull the string back
---
Change is possible, viewpoints change
---
Just like other skills in the game a lot of people don't like
---
Keep pushing that false narrative, very telling as to who truly cares about the longevity of this game and the community.
---
Wtf dude, relax
---
What are those multicolored boxes? Some sort of bot program?
---
This sub has made me lose all ability to know if this is serious or not.
---
looks like one of the mountain trolls from the hobbit
---
But if polls aren't hidden then all poll results are skewed, even the one for hiding poll results.
---
Well the thing is that previously polled updates that are healthy for the game do not dictate whether future unhealthy polls will succeed or not. Think about how much concern there was around Volcanic Mine, how people feared it'd be Miningtodt and how today it's a fairly engaging and fun mining activity that is good xp but really bad gp, offering an alternative to stuff like blast mine and mining iron while being clearly worse than granite.
---
It was, but they didn't wanna ruin it completely so they went overly cautious and ended up in the situation where they pissed people off, yet acheived nothing.
---
Is this poll the equivalent of a general election irl?
---
Nobody is forced to get another 99 though. That's a shit reason to not add another skill.
---
dang nice skeleton champion scroll
---
Yo zmi or lavas? Just wondering
---
Did you record the run? I'd like to watch that.
---
Wtf you're a god dude
---
A.k.a the average player
---
Probably go much more often than you do so keep your crap for yourself
---
Bro what
---
U don‚Äôt pay lol
---
I'm agreeing with the original comment of the thread and disagreeing with dragan.  Combat is literally built into the skill by design (incentivise splashing and move it away from commonly trafficked areas) and to disagree is to be obtuse.
---
Now THIS is a no-vote argument I can stand behind.  
---
I voted yes,  and I didn't even think the economy argument wad a strong argument from either side.  Warding just sounds like a fun skill to train.
---
Give a manufacturing skill for magic items for symmetry. If the skill already existed when the game came out, you wouldn't have batted an eyelash
---
Judging by the elitism, I'm not so sure.
---
Alright Woox
---
Vote no.
---
Bounce down was actually their first mobile game, and was available on earlier iPhones. Not sure if it's still available, but theres probably an APK for it.
---
But I really miss orb defence and no one talks about what a great game it was.
---
I saw this proposed before as Mithrilman. IIRC a JMod said it'd be easy on separate worlds, but like group Ironman would be a bit more work.
---
is that actually relevant to this idea at all or are you just TRYING to think of some bullshit to say? holy fuck
---
Lmfao now you're making it way too obvious, go back to rs07g or whatever shithole you crawled from.
---
:(
---
What's a 1k total level??
---
If this was a good argument, nobody would complain about runecrafting
---
It's been so annoying seeing people say "It's perfect for learning!"  
---
No, it's not. Without a ranking system you'll always wind up getting completely fucked to the point that you don't have a chance to learn your mistakes.  
---
A ranking system is necessary to allow you to compete against those at your own skill level and advance as you improve your knowledge and ability.
---
Ummmmm
---
you'll see
---
Well my analogy is about having "money" meaning "more vote". The idea of a democracy *is* that this is not the case. There are other forms of government where the "lucky few" for a ruling elite and votes are roughly based on wealth, look at the aristocracy developed by the roman republic. (Before it became an empire).
---
Democracy goes against that and it its core states that each and every vote from any person is equal.
---
If a person can buy multiple accounts that means it is no longer a democracy: he's "vote" is more than someone who cannot. I am not going to argue if you say this is "good" - but just say that and at least state that you henceforth do not want a democracy but rather an aristocracy for runescape.
---
People complains about people voting no on muliple accounts while other side just do the same, what is it? Voting yes on multiple isnt a problem but no is?
---
&gt; Farming and Slayer
---
I mean, I like the premise of Hunter, Construction, Farming, and kind of dislike Slayer even in practice but grew to just accept it. If they were proposed skills I'd vote yes to a lot of them. Didn't have to though since they're bunched in with like classic era of runescape's nostalgia.
---
&gt;So to say that adding skills is against the heart and soul of the game is pretty much not true.
---
I literally never made this argument
---
&gt;New skills were a part of RS3 that were actually good.
---
I mean, Summoning REALLY drained my interest in the game rapidly, and Dungeoneering despite being fun was contentious being labelled a skill. Divination was just quintessentially dogshit, and it along with EoC + the fucking changes they made to make ui super convoluted made me hard drop the game.
---
But Summoning, to me, spelt the beginning of the end. You **literally** can't design a worse or more lazy training method for it. A skill about your affinity to animals/ creatures and their spirits, calling to them for aid? Imagine if we had to train the skill by building an affinity with these creatures, or worging into them and hunting as wolves, aiding them, or some kind of like thing involved with the whole cool as concept of creature affinity.
---
NOPE. LITERALLY FILL POUCHES AND CLICK A ROCK. It was like an even lazier runecrafting- one of the core ingredients (shards) were buyable from an NPC right next to the fucking rock, adding an arbitrary gold restriction to even training the skill. So me and my poor ass self never even got a kick out of the skill because it was so price gated, so all I remember it being was like a bunch of fucking new eyesore-ish clutter everywhere in the game with the huge ass followers, and a shitload of tokens/ medallions filling my bank.
---
God, what an awful skill.
---
&gt;Why shouldn't we follow in the original concept of the game from back in 2007 when we added new skills that improved the game? 
---
Because new stuff doesn't equal improvement. We have a brazen example of that. We're reliving it with the design of Warding as well. (Although it's much better designed than Summoning/ Divination)
---
The game is **amazing** as is, but if you try to force new stuff to make it feel fresh you run the risk of fucking up entire aspects or integrity of the game just to shoehorn rewards for your new content to make it not dead on arrival. That's the issue with new content- it has to have a high level of scrutiny.

---
Ooo got'em
---
You should suck your own tits so you can focus on the game and tell that pleb to mine on your alt
---
Man you‚Äôre dense. They‚Äôre are over 100k people that have 99 defense, so that assumes they‚Äôre are over 100k players that are easily able to do raids 1-2 content, if 100k players are on at one time , it‚Äôs probably safe to say at least 30-50% of those max combat players are playing. So check you‚Äôre math again if you think 99 Rc has anything to do with raiding. Sorry to rustle your jimmies lmao
---
I bet most of the people voting no haven't even read the blog and are just voting no out of "eWw ItS a NeW sKiLL"
---
Okay and what's LMS?
---
Be careful.. before you know it they know your username :O
---
Wtf is shift dropping?
---
When you say goodnight to your tree
---
There's a few time where the opponent is too good or my switches are worse than my grandma, that I just accept death
---
Haven't seen it yet in game.
---
OP needs a swift slap in the face for using that robot narrator
---
What‚Äôs W45
---
There was a vote, for the content warding would contain. Not for the actual skill itself
---
How would this even be possible??? Absolutley amazing if you did it, but something seems off.
---
You have no clue of we did read it or not so stop talkshtting thanks
---
You‚Äôre gonna lose so much money if it fails lmao
---
This will impact the likelihood people will even bother to vote which would be could have a bigger impact than multiple votes
---
&gt; Warding threatens the original game we love so much imo
---
While I would agree that updates can threaten it at times, I wouldn't say Warding does. Back in early RS2, skills were added all the time and those sort of updates are what made RS2 what it was. So the question is do you want OSRS to continue from 2007 like they did back in the day or just a version of 2007 fixed in time without any changes? Because if you want the latter, not only is that not really faithful to 2007 if it doesn't update but that ship already sailed years ago.
---
Anyway, a new skill does change the game a fair bit, but as long as the skill is in the style of a skill they'd add back in early RS2, I don't think it would ruin the game. We've already have gotten a lot of updates in the early RS2 style (and some that aren't), so more of that is consistent with what OSRS is.
---
They've done multiple other unpolled changes.
---
Overused by who? I've never seen an osrs content creator use an artificial voice at all let alone that specific. Definitely a bitter victim of the savage ways.
---
I like zerkers cuz you can boss and fight mains but also pures even when you‚Äôre near max, but up to you
---
I think it makes people voting yes more upset because no votes are worth 3 times as much as yes votes, but in actuality there's probably more people voting yes than there are no anyway. And I'm sure a lot of the yes voters are using their alts aswell.
---
Wrong. Void always
---
Alright let me explain the extremely simple concept. Players with a max cape have all 99 stats. Right? You with me sk far? If a new skill was released, these players would have a level 1 skill. Are you still with me?
---
Here's where it gets complicated. Max capes are only for players with all 99 stats. Okay the tricky part. They wouldn't have all 99 stats meaning they couldn't have the cape.
---
Still with me? I'm hoping so but I have doubts. Right, so now they must train that stat to 99 to retrieve the cape that they already obtained. 
---
Phew, never thought I'd literally have to spell that one out.
---
I agree but most people don‚Äôt read that deep into it sadly. Several of my clanmates are strongly against them even though they do support Warding.
---
This is fake.
---
Warding will add a bunch of new moneymaking methods for collecting vis and various silks, if that interests you.
---
could also be true!
---
Lol says the guy playing the same game. What the actual problem with ppl having different opinion than yours? Who is really not open minded?
---
What is it fellow Bw√•ner?
---
You realize you're not everyone, yes?
---
This is fake btw.
---
Maybe but pretty much everyone was excited for hunter, all the new areas, etc.
---
&gt; Most of the skills are not "electric" at all
---
I mean of course they're not like "Dragon riding" or some shit- but when you have to sit down and go "ok you know how melee has smithing and ranged has crafting..." you don't have an enticing premise
---
Medieval-ish activities like Farming, Construction, Hunter are gripping concepts at least
---
&gt;Most if not all of the processing skills are like this because this is how RS works
---
"Some old skills are shit, therefore new skills should also be shit" is not a good argument for new skills
---
Up until 2 days ago everyone was super anti-warding
---
It's a video game
---
What are the general stats of a zerker? No helm of neitznot right? Barrows gloves?
---
I still remember the day Con came out. It was awesome to get up in the morning, go to the RS homepage (which I think was my browser default back then), and see Player Owned Houses or whatever it was called on the front page. But yah, they did 1 skill in 2004, 2 in 2005, 2 in 2006, and then 0 in 2007 because Summoning took until 2008 to release.
---
As other people have said, fake screenshot. Wouldn't expect something like this to come from none other than Woox, xZact, Adwaam etc.
---
paint dot net
---
Photoshooped the eyes and one other thing.
---
Lol, when has anyone ever complained about a skill being 'overloaded' with too much content?
---
It's fake. You can't tick eat triple jads and still deal any damage, you don't have enough attack in between to attack. That plus the fact that he's on regular spellbook.
---
Wow I can't wait for the warding thing to end at this point I don't care if it passes or fails all the passive aggressive neckbeard memes are getting so old
---
200 minute cape with natural hp regen, sure lol
---
No, it's fake.
---
Ur dogshit now little pvm baby hahahah maybe if you wanna do some relevant content go play a game with more mechanics like rs3
---
It's fake
---
i voted no
---
It's fake.
---
They are using their alts so i dont see any problem. Stop saying that ppl saying no have no reason cuz we could also say that theres no legit reason to make warding a skill on its own. We have our reason to vote no just as you prowarding pretend to have yours to vote yes.
---
Very nice man, but I'm a bit confused . I know that you only get the druidic from a master clue not elite . Like do you get another chance to get items outside of the mimic drop table ( the ring of 3rd age and the other stuff)  or what exactly ?
---
It's on the arceuus spellbook, not lunar
---
How about choosing to vote no? Or is that not allowed, we have to vote yes so you get it and then not do it, and then not interact with other players or do future content?
---
He didn't, it's fake.
---
Yo this guy is bad he has so many rs3 posts
---
New skill that's being polled currently. 
---
You can read about it [here](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/warding-blog?oldschool=1)
---
No it's not, it's next level fake
---
I asked what plugins users are using, not whether or not they're using a 3rd party client.
---
Arcanists and that one space battle game where you could build your own ship were FANTASTIC. Hate to see them die the way they did.
---
What if you don't want to limit yourself, but also don't want warding?
---
I mean... it‚Äôs a new topic. I only heard about it yesterday and then read the blog. So I was support of it from the start. So you can probably say the hardcore fan base follows the news every day and the casual fans keep up like once a week, if that. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù didn‚Äôt know about warding.
---
Playing the game shouldn't be a chore. If it does feel like that go do something else. 
---
If a newer, better version of dmm will enable you to have fun playing again, I suggest you flesh that idea out and post your suggestion. Make it into a clear and concise post. This post is a bit all over the place.
---
Ha
---
I don't play the game. I enjoy what they do with it and used to play it when I had no sense of achievement in real life.
---
more of a class/load out based worms
---
Well, time to cut OPs balls.
---
Because this guy can photoshop?
---
Hard to record a run for a faked screenshot
---
Wow, very cool!
---
Be glad there are pro warding posts because antiwarding posts will get downvoted then invisible instantly
---
I'm making money off crafting right now, Making my own Battles Staffs and high Alching them around Rellekka... yeah it's a pain in the ass to make 2200 Battle Staffs but I end up with 10% more GP than I had before... And I'm not always standing at a bank, I do, just to make Molten glass, Unpowerd Orbs or the staffs themselves, but powering them requires me to literally run through a dungeon 100 times, and then there's the agility course later on.   
---
And Runecrafting is not a bank standing skill either... In fact it's all cross country running for the most part, very interactive with a lot of other skills involved to make it more efficient.   
---
And By the way, Slayer has you stand by a monster for hundred kills at a time. Some tasks could last a long time even if it's a low number kill... You don't move much at all, except when you go to get a new task and fight a different monster that an NPC told you to kill.    
---
All the other skills create stuff for the game, some of them don't require you to move around everywhere, but the skills give to the economy still. Some of them need a rework, like Smithing or Thieving even. and that's where other skills could come in to help.
---
I'm the weird one who doesn't mind agility
---
The defense is decided when the animation begins, as that's when the other person gets the XP drop predetermining the hit.
---
S
---
Jagex said Dragon hai robes will be like 40k gear and slightly worse than Ahrims. It's just going to drop Ahrims to Alch price.
---
Raids are a necessary evil for many people coming back, that does not make either warding or raids good content.
---
Nah, it's fake.
---
That‚Äôs a lie, nobody ever wants to runecraft
---
Thank you Lynx Titan
---
You're*
---
Ha. Tell that to the 2277s.
---
You‚Äôre a few months late for April Fools.
---
Not everyone is a sweaty motherfucker with a stinky chair my dude. Imagine thinking you're better than other people just cause you do lava runes.
---
if its not as good then it doesn't devalue ahrims, a d defender is slightly worse than avernic defender but look at the price of that.
---
Well, that is a shame =\
---
Ye ye blabla we never quit rs man
---
This is a 10/10 comment. If I had gold I would give you it just for this.
---
You are claiming that you used hp skillcape for regen?
---
if you wanted to make this look less fake maybe you should've used also higher duration for the run
---
You realize ur an iron nub rite
---
Runelite
---
That's not really true though. If you don't want a new skill at all or if you don't want a new buyable then no matter what they change it won't affect you. 
---
I'd still keep up to date but if I didn't want a new skill at all I'm not sure I'd really care about reading all the updates.
---
Just because someone is against warding doesn't mean they are against having a new skill/content. 
---
Most people are voting no because they just don't like the concept not because they "Want to keep old school old school" that's basically a meme arguement at this point that only a minority actually believes.
---
Lmfaoo git gud. Problem solved
---
Just bought my first God set thanks to your guide.
---
Actually it makes their hole tight, as they hold it until they poop themselves.
---
I love Rigs bants but he does have a superior god complex. Thinks he‚Äôs the dogs bollocks.
---
you're a mod on a game subreddit overestimating the amount of effort people put into a game they might play an hour/week
---
Hey I just almost killed you at Callisto... Strange coincidence. AGS almost got ya ;)
---
Only the stronk survive.
---
The whole if you don't like it don't use it argument is really dumb unless you're an ironman or something. Ward is going to impact the economy since it's an item sink so it's going to impact you whether you want it to or not.
---
Wanna buy some Bwananas?
---
"dID yUo eVEn ReAD tHe BlOG? wArDIng wAS bAd nOW iTs gREaT!!!"
---
No problem remember to eat your lasagne
---
The exp counter!!
---
That statement is literally unfalsifiable. I quit rs, if someone quits drugs and relapses he still quit them, are you that stupid or just fucking with me here?
---
If you can logcically explain how it will negatively impact the economy, I'll be extremely surprised
---
Was just kidding :(
---
original comment "forced" was contained in your view. so I'm in the right to assume you are continuing with your forced outlook, but changing words just so you can say "I didn't say forced thooooo"
---
If it passes, I'll level it, although I voted no. God forbid I look like as much of a noob as OP.
---
I don't know what the final results were, but we got a fair amount.
---
I've definatly got a better understanding of lms after watching ur vid but I always run out of runes by my second fight and I dont know how to get more. Does anyone know how many casts we get?
---
Prob one of the more rare drops in the game tbh just on the % chance. Grats man
---
For anyone else trying to find the other thing he added it's something to do with sex.
---
I actually saved it to use as my next phone wallpaper :(
---
Tug 'em for me
---
i dont care about speed though I was more thinking about what's better in pvm situations, slayer etc
---
Do you think it costs money to cut down trees? How exactly will the player lose money here? They just lose theoretical profit.
---
ur like lvl 57 combat stfu
---
Most prowarding are idiots bitching on peole with different opinion and are blinded trying to prove warding deserves to be a skill on its own. If youre a low lvl start by training skills that already exist before tlkshitting
---
What the fuck are you even talking about.
---
So all of those quests you'll never do is locking your self out of features? What about diaries? That would mean if you never finish literally everything, and visit every area, fight every boss, etc, means you locked your self out of features of the game.
---
okay so don't play.
---
you're literally in charge of how you spend your time, you don't have to do things that aren't fun. if you find the things you are doing unfun, you can literally just go do something else?????
---
You can‚Äôt have a proper discussion here with the majority of people who don‚Äôt share your view, it gets me riled up as the counter arguments are horrendous.
---
It's not an achievement, it's bad and helps Kim Jong.
---
Or we can vote no because we arent interested in another buyable skill that is not interesting to us
---
This has to be the most reposted meme of the centuary
---
Oof.
---
But it's not.
---
No different than crafting, smithing, it makes sense to have a magical armor crafting skill.
---
I voted yes and I'm a veteran. Been playing since 2017
---
I'm not even sure how to respond to this nonsense to be honest...
---
I think it will
---
The king dude for sure
---
I turned this shit on, never have to drop a fucking vial again, life is fucking good. never have to sell a vial either, i wish decanting could disappear my old shitty vials too.
---
lmao they made the mimic from final fantasy into a real thing!!
---
I am find with a new skill. Thats not my problem with warding. And it has starting getting there. Its definatly better then the last time they showed us what they had. 
---
But for me its just not there yet. I will be voting no for now. If they want to refine it more and repoll it then its fine by me and I will decide based on what they present at the time. 
---
Just wanted to put this out here because I see alot of people deadset on opinions. But there is a minority of people who dont nessisarily hate the skill but are voting no. These people arent saying no to the skill, but no to the current idea of what the skill should be and want to see it better.
---
runelite+ lets you do fake item overlay. you can just type in what you want it to look like you're wearing and voila
---
Dude you are speaking out of your ass , there's no logic going on here you just pull arguments out of thin air üòÇ
---
Yeah a new skill isnt a fundamental mechanics change.
---
Let's be fucking reasonable here. I know it's a lot to ask
---
I thought not to do that because you use more prayer leading into using more money on pray pots
---
Lvl 99 perk is you get the dad bod
---
do you know what tick eating does?
---
nice.
---
So you're against new skills. Got it
---
fuck off i've been using this for months but it's time to share the info
---
I mean. I have total lvl of 1763 so yeah
---
Boating maybe then? Or a navigating skill... Lol jokes aside theres no way to know for sure what they will do unless it happens. Everyone has their reasons and i dont think anyone is in the wrong. tbh i wouldn't even be mad if it passed, new content is always cool and it would actually make pking in 2200worlds feasible for me. But i would much rather have it fail and have a different skill pushed through.
---
One of the easier things to mess up when doing 4g is clicking the herb and rock in the same tick. If you don't click them in the same tick you wont move to the next rock fast enough and it can mess up the cycle.  
---
You can tell if you clicked them in the same tick properly if your character starts the pestle and mortar animation as soon as you move to the next rock. If you start the animation before moving to the next rock, you've messed up the cycle.
---
feels so good, helped in firecave too!
---
Mine coal, it‚Äôs worth more
---
You can't even say it was objectively flawed. The voting might have been different, that in no way implies that a vote that is further informed by seeing current results vote is worse.
---
Because you can't pass a poll if your idea has zero content.
---
Be realistic for a second, all this controversy is not going to give you 75% for warding to pass
---
its a good idea if u are low lvl rn and want to do woodcutting, this is good money rn
---
so the old skills were boring and repetitive so the new ones have to be the same ? i hope that you're joking
---
Didn't you look at the subreddit this last week? All it is is shitting on people voting no lmao
---
Liam won on the 1st tweet tho, 1 no vote = 3 yes votes
---
Ignore this man he‚Äôs literally just throwing up what he reads from other people. That‚Äôs what they all do you bring up a opinion of the skill and they just all say the same thing, Fucking sheep
---
A lowercase L and uppercase I look almost the same, also capital O and 0 (Zero) look similar. People can use this to have seemingly the same name
---
runescape with a whole dollar left over.
---
I appreciate it. You might wanna add a /s to your posts if you're joking about Warding. Unfortunately Poe's law is in full swing and it's impossible to tell who is joking and who is brigading.
---
No to warding memes have made it and still make it to the top every single day. You're so fucking blinded by your hate against warding that you only see the bad parts for your opinion. Again, shut the fuck up, serene.
---
Echochamber is the opposite of a buzzword.
---
A buzzword has no actual substance. Echochamber perfectly describes reddit, and it always will until they let subs disable voting entirely.
---
Go do something more worth your time. You do have something else to do, right?
---
Still absolutely livid this pet isn't called Pet'ion
---
Funniest shit I‚Äôve seen on here in a while üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Ya there is no way to tell for sure until it happens. I just seems logical to me that is the most likely way it will happen which makes it feel like your working against yourself to me. I was hoping to convince you but I guess I cant make that happen. I'm just glad you're not an asshole about it like most of reddit.
---
Youtuber... Are you dumb? Lmao
---
From my nowhere-near-to-get-maxed point of view, I can feel the pain for the maxed players however, the game should get meaningful and useful content and warding is exactly that because it has many useful items for other skills. Now I know that these items have no value for maxed players but for lower-level/new players this content is helpful at least.  
---
New content is very important to draw in new players and this skill has its merits. Can you guys take this into consideration before voting?  
---
Thanks!
---
Your rapier will loss hundreds of millions of worth, sell sell sell! Before the crash! üìâüìâüìâ
---
Tbh I'm still pretty pissed they killed off the Bob the cat. He was in the game for such a long time and I have a shrine to him in my POH. Evil Bob is still around.
---
Killing Nieve is one thing since she was a new NPC, but killing Bob just feels so wrong. He was an iconic part of the game for a long time and then they just kill him off for no good reason. Even worse than when they killed Guthix in RS3 imo.
---
1764 is low af in 2k19 so yeah train them and stop talkshtting
---
"Add 'randomname' to ignore, tries gaining trust with fake antiscam!"
---
What the point of this bot? It's always a different account spamming a new name each day.
---
The fuck is an antiscam?
---
oh right, we should let people with 1k total vote, instead of the people that know a lot about the game
---
yeah, makes sense.
---
high iq post, yet i'm higher iq than yours look out
---
You're assuming jagex is smart enought to stick Vis reward 1:1 to alch price of trash. They didn't said anything about it. Expect the worse.
---
There's also 5 tiers of Vis, according to rarity/expensiveness of the items? who knows, they've not clarified anything, presumably all these BiS niche gears won't be made for xp, as the tier 5 vis will come from expensive stuff which will mean a huge cost over their alch value
---
But with other kind of gear, I don't even know which of these magic robes, we just don't know which of these will be done for xp and what their gp creation outcomes will be.
---
We just don't have enought info. But oh well, the curse of high iq. Your problems r only urs lmao
---
 Nah it's hot garbabe. The points you made aren't issues though.
---
It's not content for content's sake, though. It's content designed to fill a gap in armor progression with new magic robes, it creates an item sink in dissolving, and they already have other content planned that will incorporate warding even further (like the minigame and guild listed in the blog). Whether it's good or mediocre is personal preference, and I think it's a good addition to the game.
---
leave it to jagex to have shit done right, im sure the hire some 1 to do dead man tournament as well cuz they know they will fuck up like every time   
---
ppl loosing bills over this shit rn it should be a fun weapon fking bs it is
---
You literally just did tho
---
H
---
If you contribute more money to jagex, you should get more of a voice. How is that hard to understand?
---
This has to be the most reposted comment of the century
---
Twenty five runecrafting nice
---
Don't accept money or gifts from other players that think they are helping a noob. A big part of the OSRS experience is earning your own way, and taking gifts from other players ruins a lot of the fun to be had.
---
Still a better skill idea than warding
---
Ok, fair enough. It is up to the individual to vote for whatever reason they want after all.
---
well then I hope you don't burst nechs / dust devils / abyssal demons, because that's as much if not more ezscape than wt
---
Inb4 it‚Äôs Eluned

When you ask them something and they pretend to be afk but you see him going between bank and the G.E...
---
Start doing regulat herb runs. It will make the next bond alot easier. Farming aventoe/toadflax is no risk and pretty good money. And go to ranarr/snapdragon when you have a little more
---
Agreed.
---
yea but this method gives you 40% agility right off the bat bruh
---
What a fucking legend
---
Thats also my perspective, warding is.... Ok i like the new content from it. But if it passes i really dont see another skill anytime soon if ever, and would prefer something more interesting as a first osrs skill. osrs has been out how long and they finally took a new skill seriously.
---
just how the first osrs quest was "mm2" a GM quest and not "x marks the spot"
---
Not really hard to find but here ya go: https://youtu.be/Q8KM2M9Gov0
---
It's a valid point. This is an mmo, not league of legends.
---
It is for me
---
the plan is to do betas on it and such before its released to make sure its fleshed out. this requires passing
---
Not thick enough
---
Divination as well (RS3, but still).
---
And IIRC when they released farming we all stood around at Catherby because we didnt know how to properly train the skill. When it was discovered that you were supposed to leave your crops and wait, people thought the skill was trash.
---
Summoming had use, but was broken af.
---
Fuck i voted jill stein
---
It does give magic defense lol
---
GRATS RESPY! What‚Äôs next?!
---
First try not insulting people that disagree with you. The Runescape community should be better than this and this reddit should be ashamed of itself for the way they are acting. 
---
And second I agree with you 100%. I dont want warding but if it passes I totally want all the stuff that was in the polls with it. I think a lot of them are great ideas even if warding dosnt pass.
---
Oh shit how could I forget
---
Upvote for 169 likes
---
Unfortunately thats how these votes go
---
According to the upvotes/downvotes/comments it seems you hold the minority opinion my friend :)
---
Most people hate NMZ. That doesn't mean we'd vote to remove it. Players cannot be trusted to vote for game integrity if it removes benefits to themself. Of course it would never pass a poll. The same way we would never have voted to nerf Zulrah or gmaul.
---
One persons voice shouldn‚Äôt go over others depending on how many accounts you‚Äôve use bonds on.
---
Tassets is terrible for DPS at Gorillas though. Karil's bottom/black d'hide is much better.
---
If you aren't constantly screwing up prayers, defense isn't a concern.
---
Whats a good skill?

I think sailing has huge potential.

You're becoming r/2007scape's master-baiter

Nah it‚Äôs aight he got the üÖ±Ô∏è Pass
---
Wintertodt is fucking OP compared to the old way of training firemaking but zeah RC just makes the 99 grind bearable for the majority of the players rather than just for the ultimate neckbeards. I agree that the continent is a bit out of place because it has all these totally different areas crammed on a small continent but I think it has a lot of good content, like catacombs, shamans, raids, guilds, konar/mount karuulm, even sandcrabs were a nice addition because rockcrabs were always packed with cannons.
---
All this talk about new skills... what about bringing back dungeoneering and summoning?
---
When you‚Äôre just gonna prep you‚Äôre inventory for some slayer in the morning, but end up doing 3 slayer tasks.
---
Let me ask, what skill would you be excited to see and vote for?
---
 &amp;nbsp;
---
We could add this to crafting/runecrafting/magic but  crafting and magic are already so bloated with things compared to most other skills and runecrafting while it would be a decent addition to the skill the community wont vote yes for anything that increases exp/per hour or makes the skill any easier to level because they are masochists that did it and want everyone else to suffer as they did.
---
We need an item sink in the game, not only does this skill provide that but it also does it in a way that slows down the amount of gold being brought into the game because people will be dissolving instead of alching some things.
---
Jagex have listened to player feedback and massively changed warding from its first concept, they will continue to listen as this goes forward but if we as a community keep saying fuck off every time they try to give us something they will eventually stop and the game will get stale. 
---
We just had a massive player population boom with mobile being released, warding is probably 6-12 months away even if it passes. We need add something for everyone to the game. Player retention is important and we need to add something that everyone from the biggest noob to the most elite neckbeard can do and enjoy. A new dungeon designed for ironmen or a new raid boss for maxed mains is not the way to keep these mid level casual players around.
---
You must be fucking with us. I can't find it.
---
Thats neat I used 3400 tokens on the warriors guild and got a black defender.
---
Congrats you haven't proven me wrong and have contributed nothing to the discussion. Insults are the first thing you jump to without even talking about the subject at hand 2 comments later.
---
60-75 is 35k and 75-77 is 40k
---
What's the rush? People seem to be in a hurry to max, as if they just want to be done with the game asap.
---
Can free to play players not vote? If so then it is just about who makes more accounts.
---
I'm a member since a really long time and I have no alts so I don't know the answer to this.  
---
If anyone knows, please tell me.
---
I'm enjoying fletching while watching them yell at each other at the poll booth.
---
&gt;I don't think it will be a bank-standing skill.
---
"Due to the magical armour being well... magical, you will need a ward to channel the fabric to give it its special powers. These wards are either created by a player using vis on the floor anywhere, like a fire with logs, or found across Gielinor"
---
Maybe I'm missing something but to me it sounds similar to lighting a fire at/near a bank and then cooking on it, which is definitely a bankstanding type deal. And seeing as it's going to be a buyable skill I don't imagine there's much room for that to change.
---
Raids and Farming guild,

I
---
I set a goal of a quest point Cape. Took me about a month and was well worth the grind. (As a side note I work 60 hours a week so my play time is limited.) Qpc is a nice goal to set and achieve. Feels great when you get it!
---
Warding gives a reason to splash on something other than rats, takes high level gear and clue rewards out of the game to make them more rare again, adds more magic armor variety to the game (f2p only has level 1 robes btw), a new skill is a priority, adds a minigame that gives an alternative to runecrafting with slower xp, how is none of this beneficial for the game?
---
Why would I want to add a bunch of power creep?
---
Grats man! Solid band aswell
---
We don't need an entire filler skill and a dead minigame to introduce a new set of magic robes. Let alone one that's barely different from existing skills.
---
I'd vote yes to fixing the magic gear progression in a less bad way. I'd vote yes to a skill that actually improved the game rather than just made it bigger. 
---
But warding, as is, is just a shitload of filler that only serves to introduce mid-game magic armor. Whack the robes into runecrafting, or some new skilling boss or something. Don't copy paste crafting and give it a new name.
---
Lol did you expect an entire new landmass to be filled and populated , to have all the content it could possibly have, right at release? You act like it was supposed to come out peaked. 
---
They can and will (and have been) adding content to that massive land. You have some seriously high expectations for a small dev team....not everything comes out fully perfected ... especially large scale updates. 
---
At least they are making attempts to dream big and take risks...zeah is an update still in progress and will be for a while so you can't just judge it like it's some complete thing. It's still ongoing progress being made on it..
---
Just play the game. As long as there is money to be made there will always be bots. Ofc rich people would buy gold instead of grind x amount of hours for 1 item, they can probly make a few tbows in a week at work.
---
I have never bought gold, but most of my friends have. 
---
Life is unfair, and it always will be. Its better to work with what you have and just enjoy the game
---
It‚Äôs too much of a pain in the ass to log into each time tbh. Reddit killed it
---
Yea, personally i trust jagex to use beta worlds to their fullest while taking feedback in order to balance it so that it doesn't become an economic calamity. One of their main goals of the skill was to reduce the amount of gp coming into the game through alching.
---
Shouldn't be using melee legs at Gorillas period. They're lower DPS than even welfare ranged.
---
I wish I had friends who play this game
---
woosh
---
Symmetry breaking in non-abelian gauge theories, personal pronoun adjective, pizza muffin, wet t-shirt contest, moldova
---
Cannonballs. Once you have membership start birdhouse runs. Amazing passive income
---
Yeah the betas do. But if the overal idea isnt quite there yet rushing it into betas is a waste of time and development. I dont want to vote yes to a skill that could have potiential. I will vote yes when the skill DOES have potiential. So until it reaches that point imo I will be voting no. There can be other opinions besides straight yes or no
---
Like +15 which is next to nothing.
---
very little as reddit is very small section of the player base. Also if there was an impact the bots would overhwhelm the new thing youre buying instead.
---
no thats not how censorship works. You are able to post right? the post doesnt go away right? does it say removed if you get -50 votes? No. it is not censorship.
---
Smithing makes bolts, darts, nails, crossbows, javelins, cannonballs and throwing knives.
---
Crafting makes glass items, snelms, bird houses, uncut gems, magic staffs and most importantly jewerly which by itself is a bigger part of crafting than ranged armours in its entirety.
---
u/Ixialia
---
The thing jagex has to do is create a 1v1 arena with elo rating with the basic lms setup this way its easy to match vs opponents around the same rating in LMS its not really possible to do.
---
wearing klanks with a platebody? poser
---
Ok bro
---
You seem super argumentative..
---
I dont get why you are so aggressive?
---
People bot zulrah. Let's boycott tbp and serp helm!
---
Thanks!!
---
"Ok"
---
Damn dude, this is runescape. If anything botters provide me with cheap supplies, and the whole "reducing the quality of my hard work" thing is bullshit. If a simple computer program can do it, it's not really an accomplishment you should be proud of in the first place. If I go after a specific stat/item it's for me, not anyone else. Why should I give 2 shits about someone standing next to me that RWT'd a twisted bow? Good for them, it doesn't effect me.
---
This game has been filled with bots since it first came out, even if you got a ton of people together and boycotted an item, the bots would just switch to something more profitable. You don't have any power to stop botting, aside from reporting bots. Sorry.
---
Came to say this.
---
Time has to be invested into accounts for them to vote. You can't take a fresh f2p and walk to the lumbridge bank to cast a vote.
---
Am I pretending to know you? Lol I'd rather not
---
Would a system to check a players ip address to only allow 1 vote per ip be a dumb idea?
---
Nerd left his run energy % uncovered
---
Didnt read and voted no
---
Right.. maybe if you're tick perfect for hours on end.
---
you the kind of nigga who votes no to warding lmao
---
even the combat ones are boring do you really sit and watch your screen? no I afk with a cannon.
---
Found the new yorker
---
I voted for Gary Johnson and haven't even hit the poll booth
---
Can‚Äôt really tell if this is sarcastic or not, but I didn‚Äôt go into detail explaining it because the guy he comment on already did.
---
We are getting something very similar to dungeoneering as a mini game in prif. You just have to complete song of the elves first. It really should have just been a mini game the entire time.
---
Careful now, he is the #1 camo top speedrunner
---
I'm glad those kalphite have found a way to ease the stress and frustration of their daily lives.
---
It takes almost the same amount of time to max an iron as a main these days. Theres about 500 hours of difference. And in order to like ironman you have to like PVM, I dont like PVM. So no thanks.
---
It's more of a gold sink then an item sink, as all items it sinks would otherwise have been high alched.
---
Damn nice :o
---
Never said that it should be. Aerial fishing is a fantastic interactive way to train fishing, much more interesting of a training method than monkfish (for an example). If they create a new skill I would love for it to be interactive rather than click once and afk.
---
Okay maybe I just need to get better. Now that you mention it I don't ever have my mouse over that logout button. I'm gonna try that next time. Thanks!
---
The problem with warding is that its strongest argument, that it creates an item sink and will be good for the economy, is invalid because there's no strong incentive to train warding. Most players won't actually have a reason to train this dev time sink other than the occasional quest requirement or diary.
---
The most of the robes are incredibly niche, and if they're tradable, you don't need to train the skill yourself (lessening the amount of items warding removes from the game). The skilling rings add 0 exp/hr, so players that value their time (over very a slight gp/exp per hour increase) won't have a reason to train the skill themselves either. The ring imbues have no guarantee of being removed from NMZ, so you can outright bypass warding here as well. Lastly, content like the rc pouches and anti-poison lamp can be completely skipped (at 77 rc due to blood crafting or just ignored because anti-poison potions are fine over a non-bis shield).
---
Additionally, warding isn't an engaging skill. If it had interesting ways to gain exp like hunter was on release (no other skill had movement like planting box traps or kiting animals into pitfall traps), then it could be still worthwhile. But as it's pitched, warding is literally splashing/crafting/smithing 2.0, which are already existing training methods for other skills.
---
And if warding isn't good enough as an item sink, you might as well just add making magical equipment to existing skills that already create magical equipment.
---
this was my money maker in 2005 or so
---
Do you even know that you're being trolled?
---
Honestly I expected a bunch of downvotes from said whiny losers lol
---
I sold my vote for 250k but they wanted to vote Yes so whatever. I personally don't give a shit if it gets passed or not since I literally just woodcut
---
Your opinion. I can bankstand and watch netflix all day
---
Well, how do countries deal with corruption and abuses of power? Tariffs, for one. That doesn't stop the abuse of power, but it does put pressure on abusers. So, even if botters started botting another item, they would be required to invest more time and money into developing other bot scripts, or making them more sophisticated, to bot items, and one of the tricks in their bag would now be worth less than it was before. That is how we start to shift power into the hands of honest players.
---
This would have a ripple effect, where now it will cost a little more for gold buyers to cheat and devalue honest players' playtime.
---
If an item's price crashes due to a boycott, it is true that players who are not involved in the boycott would buy it more. My hope would be that non-boycotters would see that change and want to learn why it happened, and maybe join the movement.
---
Yeah but they only have so many characters to do it in
---
Do you know that you‚Äôre helping spread cancer. Grow up.
---
Whips already hit 50‚Äôs you majestical taint
---
The original purpose for voting (upvote relevant content, downvote irrelevant/low effort content) is sound, but it becoming agree/disagree internet points was inevitable. They should have changed to a different comment sorting system a long time ago.
---
dude id be like lvl 104 according to runelite by now
---
EZ!
---
WHAT!? 5000+KC and all I get is some shitty necklace.. really happy for you.
---
Install it the same way you'd install in on Linux. I run Runelite on my Raspberry Pi tablet. It runs pretty well, but I'll be upgrading it to a 4 soon.
---
Hol up. What‚Äôs an afk thieving method?
---
I never said i was against rewarding effort. I think sandstone would be a fantastic method if it the same speed as charter ships. I didn't see any reason to increase the speed of a skill though, just because people didn't like filling buckets at yanille.
---
One piece of mage gear is made with crafting. It's more of an exception than a rule that only came about because there wasn't a better skill to put it in. Not to mention, crafting is bloated enough as is. The first point holds true for the boots in rc as well.
---
I went off the stats per 100K, not quite sure what you're on about champ.
---
Oh that's nice. I need to look into joining a clan for sure.
---
Lol this is the idiot who bought a tbow with bonds
---
Thanks for proving my point! :D
---
I remember seeing others having done it on this sub before. You could search Google for old threads about it. 
---
If I where to guess you're probably best grabbing runelite and compiling from source.
---
You sound mad
---
Buddy of mine qent 675 befote dex. 2 mauls, and a tbow as well. then got another dex at 677
---
Lol, the classic boxed into a corner "I give up" plea.
---
I checked the poll history multiple times when proving you wrong. I know you lack the mental capacity to remember things that happened 2 comments ago, so I encourage reading again for yourself how your own words were proven wrong using the results of the polls.
---
None of these updates should have ever made it to the game in the first place. Make oldschool 07 again
---
you can learn raids bro. The rooms in general are easy (as long as your scouting raids without Vasa, Vespula; and Vanguards at first). Just like Vorkath, Olm will always use his special attacks in a cycle. If you're raiding with people who do proper skips and know how to run the head then you will take a lot less damage from Olm in general. I would argue that learning Zulrah is harder than learning Olm (in a trio/duo) because Zulrah requires more memorization and theres a bit of RNG to his fights. I'm not a pro by any means (only 50kc in Cox), and I stopped dying on Olm around my 8-10th raid. Even around 5-6 I started getting the hang of it. The two attacks that fucked me up the most when I started learning Olm were his floor spikes and his prayer orb attacks. The sooner you get those down, the better off you will be in general because those two attacks are the most preventable damages that do a ton of damage and therefore make you waste supplies.
---
I'd argue the prims/pegs thing is a bit different because both the materials (boots + crystals) are obtained by various other means. The means which these other materials are obtained is what determines the price of the boots, not the requirement to make them.
---
We can clearly see the requirement to make Soulbark. It'll require Vis, which is worthless (it's equivalent to thread for Crafting), and Silk + Soulbark. The Silk will be obtained from hunter, which likely means it's farmable just like Implings and butterflies are. 
---
So the majority of the price will be frontloaded onto obtaining Soulbark. We don't know how we obtain that yet, so we can't realistically say that training Warding via soulbark will be viable, but *that also means we can't rule it out either*. It's simply a lack of crucial information, which is bad for me, as it means I can't go into the poll booth as informed as I'd like to be.
---
Ok, guy.
---
What about my boy mammal :(
---
Spend 650 hours helping other people and I shall be even prouder!
---
You blind or something? Almost all the memes here are in support of warding, not sure what you‚Äôre going on about
---
You couldn't be more wrong.
---
&gt;imagine being scared to get hacked
---
Easy to say when your bank is 300m tops.
---
Even if i gave you my RSN in the pic you could just go and say "that isn't you" &amp; "you just bought it" etc. etc.
---
Not going to take a million screenshots and leak info for the miniscule reward of some random redditor believing i have an infernal cape.
---
Honestly looks better like that.
---
He's in the minority in the discussion
---
Or even multicore support, but I'd expect multicore support would be harder to code than the addition of GPU acceleration.
---
GPU acceleration and simple UI scaling would be amazing.
---
Seeing as the skill being pitched is rather bare-bones (for a reason, the previous skills they designed failed, which they believe could be due to over designing opposed to community-built), I'm hoping further development would really stress the item sink aspect, as it's the only reason the skill has any merit imo
---
Understandable. Have a good day.
---
You seriously think they won't add a quest with a warding requirement? Of course that quest will come with a new boss and new Slayer monsters.
---
So yes you will be locked out of new and old content
---
Yep I agree 100%. Ranged top and bottom (not Arma) is much better..if anyone cares about the strength on tassets, they should be bringing a neck switch, ring switch, cape switch, and even glove switches beforehand. 
---
Something about tassets just makes peoples brains melt though and all logic goes out the window.
---
Thats even worse logic haha xD
---
The fact that you see no phishing spammers in high level total worlds and generally more respectful dialog in All Chat in those worlds is also significant to this discussion.
---
Thats a solid idea! I fell out of RSPS a few years back, maybe ill check one out today haha. Google osrs private servers im sure there is a boss dedicated one
---
I haven't voted at all yet, I'm still weighing the pro's and cons. It won't devalue my bank at all, I'm simply stating that there are *cons* just as easily as there are *pros*. It doesn't help anyone to be disingenuous about the specifics of what they're voting on just because you want the poll to turn out a certain way. The only way to make a well informed vote is to consider all aspects of what's being offered. If that makes me a bad person for wanting to consider everything before I vote, then so be it.
---
Forced is a strong word, but let's not pretend that most people aren't grinding the "unfun" skills simply because a lot of rewards (diaries, quests, etc.) are walled off behind level requirements in niche skills that probably would otherwise be ignored by non-completionists.
---
I voted no because it‚Äôs not even uniquely different from other skills. The rewards arnt even specifically different
---
Why didn't you blur out Leo's name bro
---

---
&gt;Getting mad by getting trolled on the Internet.
---
I feel its you that needs to grow up my friend.
---
If warding had a proper incentive to make it a good item sink, I'd give it a chance even if it is crafting/smithing/splashing 2.0. But it's not because, as you've said, warding gates nothing, so it's not a good item sink.
---
The ironman argument will have a minimal impact at best. Once ironmen complete a boss, they don't come back for fun. They move on to their next task after they get the gear they're looking for.
---
The amount of ironmen that get a disproportionate amount of repeats searching for a specific item are an statistical outlier, especially considering that ironmen aren't a majority of players that participate in the economy. There's also bosses that are farmed specifically for one drop. Every new player that wants to get into end-game PvM needs a DWH. I don't know of any ironmen that farm for a 2nd DWH, because you move on after getting your first.
---
Literally came here to say the same thing üòÇ

what if he's paralyzed from the neck up?

I would honestly go to a normal gilded altar in your case. Chaos altar is only really worth it if you go for higher levels (80+) You don't save a large amount of money if your goal is only to get to LV 70 for piety for example
---
Sailing could be a super cool minigame ! I was sad when it failed. 
---
You pick a difficult level, build a boat, and start hitting islands. Each island could have random resources (trees, ores, slayer mobs, etc. that drop resources at a slightly increased rate. The rate of increase increases with each successive island that you visit. The number of islands you can visit could be controlled by skill levels / sailing skill / rng.
---
1st island : maple trees, mith ores, a  harpoon fishing spot
---
You mine ores and or cut trees. You smelt and smith the ores into ship parts using maple logs and fletching. Maybe you fletch a maple harpoon.
---
 If you can fish and cook a swordie and cut and burn a maple tree you get some swordies as well from island 1. 
---
**no resources respawn, choose wisely whether to bank them for GP or utilize them to further your voyage**
---
Island 2: A few bloodvelds and some addy ores; maybe a mahogony tree. 
---
You  can cut the mahogony tree and use construction to build a temporary alter for recharging prayer one time. If you can mine and smith addy you can use that to make parts for the ship. The Bloodvelds drop sailing uniques or maybe just double loot. 
---
Island 3: Jaddy and the dragons
---
You mine and smelt rune ores or to get weapons and armor or kill dragons and craft their hides into gear. If you herb is high enough you can pick and identify unidentified herbs to make pots, fish sharks, burn magics to cook them, etc.
---
If you're able to completely 'clear' and island maybe you get some sort of bonus. 
---
There's so much potential for all the skills to be used in sailing
---
This is a tempting proposition.
---
Yes. I know it's a hard concept to understand but try to think with your peanut brain. There are two things. One of them you want and one of them you want even more.
---
I max caper. I vote yes. Dumbo
---
Talk about what now
---
This game was my life 14 years ago.. just got back on and made an account 3 days ago. I can feel the addiction beginning, this is not good.

It'd be an allright itemsink, however.
---
But us irons would be the ones getting screwed hard haha

I reacted the same way going to brimhaven dungeon. I even looked on the wiki and there was no mention of an axe or coins needed....

No you didnt. Youre uninformed. U checking the poll history didnt help you.

You can remain salty all you want, but the fact that QoL updates like better interfaces are continuously passing polls and being implemented shows that the vast majority of the players don't want to play the game the way it was developed 20 years ago. Move on man...
---
I just want sailing :(
---
&gt;you still haven't give an example of HOW ahrims will be devalued
---
I did you just dont care because you think melee protections on mage gear is the most important thing in the world. Nobody gave a flying fuck about ahrims melee defence until they needed a reason to say 40k dragon hai robes won't hurt ahrims price.
---
It's seriously like saying if there was a 40k equivalent to torags its price wouldnt end up in the dumpster because the budget equivalent is missing like 20 range defense.
---
Zeah was a high waste of time. So much boring shit in one place. Congrats to the moderators who worked on that shit. Hope they'll work on warding as well.
---
Some people are opportunistic, Good for you, imagine having an auction for your vote :P, Highest bidder decides :P
---
The game has been out 6 years. You‚Äôre a little delusional when it comes to the average combat of the community lol.  Remember when mobile came out and the prices jumped when they were leveling. Like rune went up like crazy, and then dragon then narrows and obby capes? Nobody are mid lvl anymore except range tanks and zerkers and the occasional mobile noob. That‚Äôs it, the rest of the community are at GWD, zulrah, vork, and raids. Go chill at a tob bank. Lot more players there than at Seers or the GE. The game needs more end game content
---
I'm not trying to be a dick in saying this, but it just seems like you're arbitrarily picking an exp/hr number for a skill and saying 'if it goes past this it is an integrity issue'. Actively mining 5t or 3t sandstone  should be better experience rates than AFK filling buckets, it is an active action vs being AFK. Just my opinion anyway.
---
True, but compared to barb fishing, how much use does aerial fishing get? Compared to any afk fishing method, how much use does it get? You personally may have used aerial fishing, but the vast majority of people use other methods. Randomly clicking is fun for like 15 minutes, but when you get slower exp rates than the afk method for tons more effort, people will go with the afk method.
---
I would argue that if all of either fishing or hunting were like aerial fishing, they'd be hated 3rd most, behind agility and rc, and it'd be a close 3rd.
---
Mobile zulrah? you're a mad one :D
---
I mainly just want all my overheads. Do I just need to find someones house for that?
---
When did it became good?
---
Bro give me an actual example of a boss or any content that people will stop using ahrims for that they do currently and instead use dragon hai
---
&gt; simple UI scaling
---
On Windows 10, I believe the official client should auto-scale with the OS scaling level. With 7 and 8.1, I think you need to do something with a mainifest file before that happens.
---
On Linux, I use a Java flag for UI scaling and it can be set independent of the OS scaling level; for 4K, I use 200%:
---
    -Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2
---
For Windows, I don't think that flag works though (iirc the version of OpenJDK included with the official client is too old).
---
You what mate?
---
can you be in-detail about what about the skill is "not there" yet?
---
Don't forget that jagex said that they aren't gonna be wasting dev time fully fleshing out the skill with detailed content like quests, new locations, npcs etc... before even knowing if people want the skill or not.
---
Just imagine all the wasted dev time if they try to make the content look as promising as possible and then people just vote no.
---
If enough people vote "yes" on the poll then they can actually start developing the content and creating more specific polls of what people want to see ingame. there is absolutely nothing gonna be rushed in as anything that looks like it wont get voted into the game anyways.
---
Careful, neckbeards are about..
---
Mining essence for money was one of the most common methods to in 2007.
---
Dude....calm down and stop tying you self worth to how much you can grind on a fucking video game. At this point it's just sad and embarassing.
---
Talk too much [and they'll infest the place](https://i.imgur.com/AIN6Jy5.png)

That's not exactly how it works, it's be an item sink. A gold sink is anything that directly removes gold from the game, like the DA tax or paying 1250k to Oziach to build your DFS.
---
Shhhhhhhhh....
---
But ore is heavy
---
&gt;able to type while completely dominating them
---
&gt;if they do risk typing back you can have a chance to kill them
---
And that's how you find out that this is made up.
---
Are the skip answers ignored in a poll? What I mean is, for the 75% limit for a poll to pass do you count the yes/no ratio. Or only the percent of yes votes in proportion to the total votes (including skip answers)?
---
I voted no because I dont want to 99 another buyable
---
"that care" - not votes that make me not max ooga booga
---
Why even vote if you going skip all
---
Perfect for me Pepega Clap
---
It's all practice, don't get discouraged if it takes you several hours to get it down.
---
except since they arent introduce by a new skill and not any being max xp they will all be dead content instantly.
---
Just because something could be beneficial, doesn't mean it should be implemented. Things take time, and a lot of people aren't ready for a new skill because it adds complexity to the game and it become integral to the game to where it is not avoidable. 
---
Let Old school stay old school for a while, even if something ties into the game, we don't want it to become a huge not.
---
I was anti God Wars, Zeah, and GE, and now They are such a big part of the game it is content I have to use.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just about my feelings that‚Äôs it purely that‚Äôs if, please learn to read and comprehend nuance lmao
---
most people who voted no read it some people just find it hard to accept
---
Coolest pet besides nuclear, good job dood
---
&gt; why not just add new armors instead of an entire skill
---
where should this armor come from?
---
And it's not just about armor! It's about ring imbues, a new minigame, rune pouch upgrades, skilling rings, a warding guild.
---
So much new content!
---
You should check out the blog they made:)
---
Because I dont want another boring buyable
---
Even if it's tier 70, black dhides melee defense, magic defense, and range attack is superover tuned. Even for tier 70 gear, it's just mad efficient for the cost compared to alternatives. Even compared to addy armor vs black set.  I'm just saying if people are upset over dhides+bulwark, maybe start with the dhides because it's cost efficiency is super fucking high compared to a rare 6m raid item. So that way if people want to feel safer maybe they take more risk like Arma or karils. Or they just live with the nerf.
---
&gt;because you think it's just about winning.
---
When the opposite side ends up setting up concentration camps for brown people and removes women's reproductive rights, of course it is about winning. This is like having the non-Nazi party and the Nazi party in an election, and voting for the offshoot Green party because you don't agree with everything the non-Nazi party says.
---
I agree that right now, during the primaries in 2020 we should be pushing for the most progressive candidate, but if Joe Biden ends up winning the nomination you should absolutely vote for him instead of wasting the vote on a third party.
---
Lmao did she get lured
---
I guess. Maybe they should make polls implement a system where at least 300 total level and 15h of playtime is required to vote, similar to bounty hunter‚Äôs anti-emblem farming measures?
---
I thought only Ironmen were gay
---
I agree, it is a dumb idea.  
---
I was just throwing an idea out, wasn't well thought out.
---
Yup and the lack of choice in mage armour low/ mid level too

That‚Äôs a 1 in 35,509 chance I‚Äôm pretty sure. Nice.

This pretty much sums up PvP community in any game ever.

No, not this comment, what comes after it, l fucking mao.

---
At 4 minutes in there is hard evidence clue items need a sink.
---
Too young, re-evaluate and upgrade prior to wasting your time
---
Because the alternative to that is making skills easier so people can get to a higher level faster. Then we reach the same thing. So which do you think id prefer?
---
I was under the impression that the new armors would help PvP
---
ye, but att or def after? for slayer tasks
---
&gt; the new skill wouldn't affect current content unless they decide to add warding requirement to old quests, which I doubt
---
The quest cape is old content. If they add warding requirements to a new quest then old content will have a warding requirement.
---
\&gt;  If that were to happen, well grinding 70 or so levels at max wouldn't be that time consuming 
---
So your argument is "if they do make warding a requirement for new content then so what?"
---
\&gt;  I seriously doubt you enjoy every currently existing skill.  
---
You're right I don't. So they should be fixed. I don't want another skill that I don't enjoy.
---
\&gt; If you have done some unenjoyable grinding til now, then you surely manage through this one as well if it were to be polled in the game. 
---
Yeah if it passes I might just grind the stats I need and never touch it.  But I don't want warding in the game so I voted no. That's the point of polls after all isn't it?
---
Only with lunars, that's why I specified
---
grow up and quit whining
---
When you get steamrolled 100 times in a row you start to understand why they steamroll you, so you start praying the right things and get faster switches etc. I‚Äôm not a toxic pker and have been training in lms for the past week and you really just need to play a lot. Watch some bridding videos first if you literally have 0 idea what to do though.
---
Well that changes a lot
---
reading this has enlightened my worldview so much, thanks. i feel euphoric now.
---
Even settled had to make allowances that blocked large pieces of content. Not to mention, i find it hard to compare the average rs player to a person who spent 7000 hours maxing a uim. Normal players are gonna have to train every skill to hit their goals
---
I don't like anything about warding. If that's not a valid reason for you then too bad.
---
Wait... So how do magic secateurs work? What did I miss?
---
it was rejected so badly, poll or not, that they had to revise it twice. In fact, it was rejected so so so badly, they had to wait almost a year since the warding runefest announcement to poll it officially lmfaoo.
---
I have a max cape and voted yes, because the game gets boring with no goals.
---
bad updates, I'm voting no to every new update until they fix NMZ I refuse to use it and that's why I'm still 75 combat after 4 years
---
Yeah it would take a real genius to decypher that comment
---
:)
---
Well, such threads wouldn't be as despised and hated on by the thirsty sheep-mob. I sincerily hope that the newer inexperienced players does not get their way in terms of future content, they're unaware of what's best for the game.
---
True, but the amount of people willing to read a new post over digging through comments is substantially higher
---
&gt; you can have different opinions on different pieces of content. 
---
Where did I say that you couldnt? Im saying that saying you can just choose to not use the content is the worst argument ever, that argument can be applied to any piece of content ever, then everything should pass "because you can choose not to use it" that statement is true for any content in the world. What a nonsensical thing to suggest.
---
But did you talk to Oziach?
---
You‚Äôre barely over drop rate stfu
---
He's got a great  point, being aware of the potential slippery slope and everything.
---
Catacombs are the shit
---
With the recent skill proposals I would rather just get Dungeoneering over the others.
---
It's 2019 though O.O We're 12 years past 2007, and 6 years past the adoption of OSRS. You can't expect a game to be exactly the same as it was a decade prior...
---
I got killed in the wildy once, voted no to every pvp update since.
---
T-bows, as in 2
---
These are valid concerns that should be addressed yet the Yes voters here just downvote anything even questioning the success of warding being added. Honestly a bunch of voters that say yes are just so hellbent on getting their vote in that they will prob regret certain aspects if it does pass
---
yes ive noticed the same thing plenty of people saying they voted yes on multiple accounts also trying to buy votes at ge then posted one guy doing it for no votes at ge to get him to look bad but not the ones paying for yes who i saw first when it just released poll
---
take a joke
---
i have pet claw 5 tails and 2 leathers. still havent finished the ring :(
---
Yeah you won't get much love for that. Voting yes on alts is ok.
---
Can you tell me how /u/RottedEden could have voted for Bernie in the general?
---
And why shouldn‚Äôt they? It‚Äôs free labor, and the vanilla client is just so far behind that getting it up to runelite standards would take years.
---
Why does this require engine work?
---
I only used NMZ to imbue and I‚Äôm max combat with 5 years of playing? So that‚Äôs not the only reason you‚Äôre 75 combat
---
and don't forget the ones making multiple accounts to vote yes
---
Learn how to reply to comments üòÇ
---
Lol, that was a good one.
---
I voted no
---
**TL;DR: There are economic benefits to warding that would be unfulfilled if it were incorporated into an existing skill.**
---
I have a take on this I haven't seen yet, so maybe it will be compelling to you. Have you noticed how much more expensive the BIS weapons (specifically the Scythe and Tbow) are compared to the BIS gear of late RS2? Most people chalk that up to inflation, but RS2 didn't have nearly as strong gold sinks as OSRS, even if it controlled the amount gp coming into the game better.
---
Without having access to the statistics Jagex does, if I had to guess I think the reason for the outrageous prices on end-game items isn't actually based on inflation, but of the relative accumulation of wealth by high-level players. The key here isn't just high-level players make more than mid-level or low-level players, but that they hold on to their wealth for longer. Late RS2 had 90 herblore, 95 prayer, and whatever summoning level was required for the Pak Yak, as an essential rite of passage to end game content as well as all the extra late-game quest reqs. OSRS has 83 construction for a PoH, 78 herblore for CoX (ideally 90, but from my own experience it doesn't tend to work out that way), and maybe some extra diary stuff if you're into that sort of thing. So my general theory is that because of less necessary skilling requirements, wealth generated by higher level players doesn't trickle down to lower level players, and as such the most end-game focused items in the game are subject to a particular market demand comprised exclusively of buyers who have exorbitant amounts of wealth bidding against each other.
---
So what does this have to do with Warding? Without content specific to it, there likely won't be an implicit requirement for a high warding level in end-game activities, so why would it draw that much money away? Well, because it's a new skill. One of the additional wealth redistribution mechanisms late RS2 had was that new skills did come in to the game, and for near-maxed players, provided an impetus to sink money into the skills early on for early records and such. While Warding may resolve to costing 80m to get efficiently to 99 a few years from now, on release it could easily be an order of magnitude higher for prospective record-holders. People train new skills, because they now have new levels to reach.
---
If the buy-able training methods of warding were moved into crafting or magic, the impetus for high level players to engage with that content and give their wealth to lower level players is essentially removed. There is an addendum to this, which is that if most of warding's buyable content were moved to Runecraft, higher level players would use warding to max a skill they generally couldn't handle. So if you want the economic benefits of a new buyable skill, you either need to accept a new skill or devalue the fuck out of Runecraft, which I think is a bit of a piss-off on either horn for more elite players.
---
Of course, you could object to the implicit premise that wealth redistribution to make the end-game less remote and weaken the 'rich-get-richer' cycle of Tbow/Scythe PVM isn't actually an important or even desirable goal. I tend to disagree for balance reasons regarding the future of endgame PVM, but that's its own topic.
---
&gt; All the armors after need to have higher alch values or the skill makes no sense (imagine rune alching for less than addy), so they will have insane alch values
---
The materials are incredibly accessible so they've already been confirmed to have lower alch values than mystics, probably comparable to D'Hide.
---
This, I spotted playing because I cant learn anything if I'm getting glitch spot rekt by dmm players
---
That's exactly what I'm asking...
---
I can't argue with someone who votes no to any major updates simply because the game would be stone cold dead if it wasn't updated. You obviously want that, I don't. Now give me my downvote.
---
im surprised ive seen alot of it..
---
VOTE!!! I voted NO for osrs sake!
---
Everything about it was good, except the number of seeds from packs could even still use some tweaking imo
---
I assume you didnt read the official blog thats pinned to the top of the sub because the video is right in the middle of it. Highly recommend checking that out too
---
The definition of moving goal posts. The thing you want implemented looks like it wont get a majority vote? Lets just change the definition of majority. You‚Äôre being dishonest.
---
grats on getting max combat, but what's an imbue?
---
NO
---
Haha it makes me laugh whenever I see it
---
At least she tries. My wife saw me killing bloodvelds once and now every time I‚Äôm playing she says ‚Äúwhat are you doing, killing pigs again?‚Äù
---
My beast friend plank\~
---
its hard for no voters on reddit because most are yes thats why we get downvoted but most of them don't even play the game anyways just like a rant and memes on reddit
---
&gt;Draggon  
---
FTFY
---
This skill would do much more than just "be another buyable" tho.. it makes perfect sense to have a crafting skill for magic items and it could finally be an item sink for various items, something this game is in desperate need of to keep items valuable longterm
---
This is just a pointless attempt to get some fake internet points.
---
True, another crafting or smithing could EASILY turn into action bars and cooldown abilities!
---
Dunce.
---
It‚Äôs almost like they made a mistake then realized it and fixed it. Who does that
---
I just watched this episode.
---
Sorry what other content is there in the farming guild lol
---
How long would a new skill make you play though? Grind to 99 which will be like 40 hours for warding and then you‚Äôre max again and quit?
---
I like all the new stuff, I just wish teleporting around the map was easier, that was the only thing keeping me on rs3 until I jumped back into osrs
---
mhm it won't even break 60%. Already time to call it if it can't break that
---
##### Bark bark!

Because they have no response to it. How is it a strawman to point out the stupid believe?
---
Jesus. This gave me back my virginity.
---
So... an osrs for osrs?
---
Look here, Baby's First Attempt at Intellectual Thought. The products offered by Jagex were free. They came with no price tag. Meaning you would have to *choose* to pay for something free, not "*choose* not to pay for it." So right off the bat your whole point is invalid. That's more akin to giving a donation for an appreciated service.
---
Secondly, the money you pay wouldn't even go to Jagex. It would go to the partnered company. Which, again, makes it not MTX. At worst, it's an interactive ad.
---
Slayer is nice because it gives you a reward for doing something you already wanted to do (training combat) but in a specific way (on the creature they tell you).
---
It has the nice bonus that if you have the helm, you can really slap on certain content that would otherwise be a pain. 
---
Currently, I'm 71 slayer, on a kalphite task, so it gives me some incentive to run train on KQ with my buddies.
---
As with everything in OSRS, if you don't really like it, no worries bro, just don't bother with it!
---
Nah you‚Äôre 75 combat cause you‚Äôre trash lmao.
---
No, it's not a good reason in and of itself to not add a new skill, but it is a valid response to the oh so common "Well, you don't *have* to use the new content." argument that is often used to shut down any argument opposing the adding of new content.
---
Never done a raid in my life
---
Realistically the best way to train it will be to gather supplies/buy supplies and then use your vis at a bank where you can use it 1 tile away from the bank (craft guild, ge etc). Which is almost identical to a bank standing skill
---
&gt; PvP players are actual trash human beings
---
yikes
---
Pretty sure that's just about the entire reward pool
---
&gt; That‚Äôs not true lmao.
---
Nice source. 
---
Oh wait, that's a baseless assumption. And just before you cry like a baby, I voted yes.
---
Then you haven't read any comments.

Damn... thought i had it tough... good luck in the future homedawg may the orange shapes be in our favour
---

---
&gt;buy the feathers

bro, you just slap up the chickens
---
What the hahahaha
---
Not really. There is something to be said about taking a skill that requires a variety of pre-reqs and items to train efficiently and simplifying it into a skill that can be trained in one self-contained piece of content. 
---
99 rc without lunars was an *interesting* achievement. Around only 10 level 3 accounts had 99 rc in the entire game on the release of Zeah. Reducing the diversity of achievements in an achievement-based game is just bad design. Before zeah, everyone genuinely carved their own path for runecrafting, and there were a wide variety of methods used. Now, just about everyone but the try-hards does Zeah.
---
To add to this, Zeah made the skill completely uninteresting for ironman. No longer is resource management, which is an integral part of ironman, required. You can just go run laps at zeah to train rc.
---
fort nite
---
Then I just get to do the quest on 2 accounts lol, I'm ready, I hope.
---
Yeah a twisty bow or scythey is soo oldschool! almost the same as the real oldschool whip or magic shortbow!
---
How are they used for pking
---
It was early 2007. I'll see if I can find the update.
---
No different to that other guy claiming that most people read it.
---
wtf I love warding now
---
Knowing brainlets like you exist makes everyone feel better about themselves.
---
Even the combat ones.... ‚Äúwhack monster for 4xp per damage for 1 million xp‚Äù
---
And you can see where RS3 is now :)
---
+ RS3 got an easy way to train RC. People would even more complain when armor is locked behind 90+ RC and just a fraction of people could make it. So the price would be too high for the gear. :)
---
600+ kc no shard
---
Approved
---
How does aerial fishing get you lower xp rates than afk methods? Again with the tick manipulation shit, why are you relating that to warding? I'm literally ONLY asking for them to make a new skill that you have to interact with the game to train, not to do tick manipulation.
---
Your last point is pretty dumb tbh. Just because I have to grow my seaweed and mine my sand doesn't mean the hundreds of hours of blowing glass isn't the majority of training the skill.
---
runecrafting... would never pass in a game called runescape...
---
hmm...
---
We don't know that, but either way it's an abuse of the system. But democracy is flawed and is abused in real life as well. Churchill said it best himself ("democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.")

I really appreciate this reply. I‚Äôve always been curious how the teams were divided and what their responsibilities were.
---
1M GP and gf
---
It's not about being a true 2007scape fan, it's wanting to keep the balance of the game intact. Sulliusceps, Blast Mining, Werewolf and Brimhaven buffs, and 1.5t teaks were all updates that made their skills easier/faster to do or changed the fastest XP rates and a lot of players who hated content like Wintertodt, Zeah RC, and Kourend Catacombs loved the former content because while it was strong, it was also engaging, unique, and balanced.
---
If the reason for disliking the content is that it'll disrupt game balance if it makes it into the game, then you have no reason to not participate in it if it does make it into the game, because it's not like the content just disappears from the game and stops affecting the game's balance if you don't do it. IKWhatUDidLastSummer is a competitive player too so ofc he's not going to pass up OP content because he'll be at a disadvantage compared to other players going for EHP who do use the OP content.
---
I voted no to warding because it doesn't doesn't achieve it's goal of being a strong item sink because there's not a strong incentive. The rewards are inherently mid-tier mage armors and non-exp boosting buffs. These aren't meta-changing, any meta-defining rewards were quickly removed. Without a significant meta change, what you're left with is an item sink that'll only be trained if a player wishes to retain their diary or quest cape.
---
There's several other skills in a similar situation, in which you don't train them for any other reason than for quest or diary reqs. Firemaking and smithing are some of the worst offenders and are drastically in need of a rework, but that's extremely unlikely to happen at this current rate. Warding is showing the exact same signs as those level-gating useless skills. Even though there's the possibility of reworking warding to become an effective item sink, if you compare it to fm or smithing, a rework just won't happen.
---
I want to vote for a new skill and an item sink, but if warding passes without a solid investment loop that makes it an effective item sink, I don't think it's ever going to get fixed.
---
I voted this way.... I don‚Äôt like the skill but if it passes then of course I want it to be as good as possible.
---
I‚Äôm sure it would be $11
---
my girl stood behind me while I killed Jad the other day and was completely silent, paused the TV and everything...I got healers off jad and onto me, I'm like ok just have to hit my switches, and started calling them out loud, shes like "DON"T JINX IT!"
---
It should have the ability to ice barrage for a max hit of 1
---
So lets introduce the new robes with a new boss. Ooh now you have to grind a new boss for bis mage. 
---
You will regardless of what update comes out have to grind again to get new shit. That's why you play the game. To progress you character and get gear, stats and quests done. Why does it matter to so many people that it is introduced with a new skill instead of it being added into other content? We have slayer bosses and reg bossed being released so often. Why not add new stuff to actual new content for once?
---
I did not vote yet. I want a beta to get a better idea of how the skill will work.
---
There are "pvpers" who vote no just to spite the community.
---
There are a lot of people who feel that the game does not add meaningful content. I don't agree with this but I understand their viewpoint.
---
Don't cluescroll items go straight into your bag? :s
---
How many rare fossils you got stored?
---
Do you think they'd remove NMZ from the game?
---
I want those new rune pouches as a uim

I don't think warding is a fix for that.
---
It would work with todays mobile devices easily. And with it having short games that are very entertaining, ot would fit the mobile crowd.
---
That poll is reddit hive mind based.. If you polled people in runescape you'd get a better grasp.. From my experience the people i've seen and asked in rs are highly on the no side. From twitter you can see it is also highly on the no side. Reddit is the only place where it is on the yes side favored.
---
fastest is chopping shrooms in the swamp. I was GRINDING away at killing crabs and doing underwater shit for two days, then read online how fast mushrooms is...finished the kudos needed for hard diary within 2 hours.
---
People complaining about a runecrafting requirement versus people blindly trashing and trying to get everyone to vote no on warding? Baby steps.
---
it‚Äôs just a shit skill that every redditor want because the other person does
---
I'm at 800 and got nothing. So pissed at these fucks. Never again. Feels even worse when friends kill less than like 30 and get 2 Shards. Friendships were tested that day.
---
AFK doesn't mean the same thing in runescape as it does generally, don't be daft. If you can do an activity while paying 100% attention to something else, it's afk. For runescape, that's what it means.
---
Because you have one more vote than a person who only has one account, you may have several accounts but you're only one person. I can understand your logic in a way but in the end it only leads to chaos, one person one vote is how it is conducted in a fair manner.
---
WArding shills getting desperate I see

He can keep his dirty hands off of my gold tinderbox.

Definitely, I agree with OP but I don't see that happening. And I don't see the point of stuffing it into magic
---
Omg thats brutal, respect
---
"Yeah, no, I'm totally not like the other guys...I would never just sit on my computer and game all day with such a pretty girl in the same room" We've all done it, they shouldn't fall for the good gamer boi bait.
---
Being able to enchant magic gear vs creating new gear.. I'd rather make my gear better than create worse gear that I wouldn't use
---
Who cares about the META the game isn't always about endgame for me at least mid game was the hardest because 60-70 sucked booty but once you get like bandos and that first 25-30 mil cash stack you can anything in the game.
---
Scrap warding and divide the content to enrich current skills.
---
Bring back punishing death mechanics in one way or another for the item sink
---
Tie imbues to one of the Lunar quests
---
IMO playing f2p is intentionally tying your characters hands. playing a btw is like tying your feet.  
---
trying to make progress is like swimming, you're going to want at least your hands.
---
I don't see a reason to add repeatable content like armour creation to a skill if its not supposed to be a viable way to train said skill.
---
It just seems very strange to make magic armour the only one that grants no xp for making it.
---
Nope no warding no pvp updates ü¶Ä ü¶Ä ü¶Ä
---
Most polls have biases and it is important to understand them. I reported all polls that I found in an attempt to not mislead anyone and at the same time to not misunder what is going on.
---
I think I pretty much agreed with all of this in another message someone on this thread.
---
You're welcome my guy.  You clearly get a lot of pussy in the "an opinion being popular means its wrong" gang.
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Dfs gives -120 melee stats and also -8 to magic def compared to Dinh. That's why Dinh is so strong. You can be tanky physical and magical attacks because you aren't required to wear melee gear... So it really is....

‚Äújust want a new skill‚Äù that‚Äôs what everyone wants just not a shit skill like warding
---
I think you're totally in a different mindset. Some people really like just "hanging out" inside the MMO that they play. They don't care about being efficient. But yeah eventually if they just stop adding content of course they will lose people, I just think they have added so much I don't think it's even close to that point at all, except maybe with people who are max
---
Empty balls means clear head
---
Ah yes, because we wont get anymore content if warding doesnt pass.
---
That would become invention from rs3. I've heard this opinion a lot and many people seem to like it.
---
Demon mask
---
Voting yes gives a beta instead of the skill apparently, according to mod Weath.
---
Yeah and I agree with you that'll it get 50's maybe low 60%. That's where i'd see it at best anyway
---
chuck again
---
Sucks
---
Basically I just want my Infinity Robes, that I spend what seems like half of my life grinding for, to still be the better than something someone with 60 warding can make. I know Ahrims and Ancestral are both better, it's just annoying to think that something that can take so much time or money could become useless overnight... So I've voted yes to warding, but hope infinity gets a boost!
---
Because there‚Äôs a 1 minute outro thanking the people that helped me it‚Äôs not teaching anything ;)
---
agree
---
Happily married! Don't need to spend my Friday nights on Tinder!
---
Fuck off with the propaganda
---
&gt; Warding is not that, warding is just solving problems and packaging those solutions as a "skill" which quite easily fits into Magic, Runecrafting, and Crafting.
---
I see this opion everywhere. I honestly don't get it. There is no difference by having these improvments introduced into the game as an individual skill compared to adding it through multiple different skills. You will still have to grind levels get them. Have to collect recources and eventually have to make them. 
---
But how is it not more logical to have a dedicated skill for it and with it add new content alongside it to fletch it more out? Why do we need to spread all this content out over 3 skills if we can package it in a new 'skill.'
---
&gt; A new skill should be added to the game because it fundamentally provides a unique and interesting update to the game.
---
Like sailing? There is room for unique and interesting updates in the game and I personally think those should be added as either a gamemode or a minigame. Skills are there to grind and boost your stats.
---
Haven't played in a bit, didn't know runelite had that feature, cool.
---
I skipped the question on warding itself, only voted on the individual items
---
Dont care that much
---
Stop these propaganda polls... wasnt going to vote at all but now im leaning towards a no
---
Hey man I‚Äôll take it if you really hate it

If you play over the course of 5 months, you can acquire enough genie lamps to get 29 hunter and then do swamp lizards to 99.

Can we please vote no to the pedo armor unless they change the name.

Hybridding is specifically two combat styles. (Mage + Melee). Bridding can refer to hybridding or tribridding. Tribridding is generally referred to as NHing or bridding.
---
So your trying to tell me I can't state my opinion on the subject after you did?
---
Damn it's 2019 and y'all are still out here getting scammed? Please stay in school.
---
i'm not opposed to the existence of them per se, but stop forcing bullshit skills like warding that are 100% afk
---
Any system that requires picking some arbitrary number without any reliable way to determine what that number should be is flawed. Not sure about what a good alternative would be, though.
---
I‚Äôll stake you for all of it. I can‚Äôt match it so you won‚Äôt win much either

His title says the reason.

On the one hand, sad.  On the other hand, I've always thought that Karil's bow and the Crystal Bow were awesome weapons, so I'm gonna get to enjoy some dead content!

Fuck the scheddy

Best part is, not adding new stuff to OSRS will kill it just as easily

I just want the same graphics, combat and no mtx.
---
You realize we get weekly updates right?
---
I don't really see evidence that this is true. I've been trying to get anyone to participate in some kind of dialogue about how the real problem is that the skill is a buyable but absolutely no one will engage with me besides downvoting. Meanwhile if I say some kind of surface level thing like "actually I feel like the vote yes people are being rude" or "it's unfair to say all maxes feel one way about this" those are the only posts that get attention. I honestly think the fact that pretty much none of the discussion here is centered around Jagex's obvious conflict of interest or how this will impact the economy in all kinds of complex ways is an indication of how poor the level of discussion is and how unqualified most people on the subreddit are to vote on it at all.

Pretty sure theres an exp multiplier for slaglith, hitting a 0 gives exp

PvP clans are extremely aggressive, mean spirited, abusive, and constantly lock players out of content (hello high total world PK clan monopolies on rev caves!) Regardless of the "it's wildy bro" comment I know would come from this, it still doesn't make what they do any less shitty. It honestly feels bad and is a large reason as to why PvM only players avoid the wild.
---
They're excessively elitist. (Admittedly this applies to clans in general. Not just PvP clans.)
---
Skulltricking is... yikes. Skulling should be something a player willingly does. A player who is "tricked" into skulling is effectively being scammed in my eyes. Especially if it then leads to deliberate smites by clans. This also creates the dynamic where PvMers in the wild are scared to fight back against PKers for fear of ending up skulled and is another huge reason people are often against the wild.
---
The resentment PvM only players have towards PvP players doesn't just come from nowhere. The community as a whole would need to change on both fronts to a large extent. And while that won't happen, I'd say the problem area is roughly 70% PKers being awful to other players and 30% PvMers not voting favorably to PvP content. (If we're being honest though, a lot of PvP content is poorly implemented in the first place.)
---
I realize this is an essay you probably won't read or agree with at all, but as someone who does PvP and PvM both just for casual fun, this is my observation.
---
Because you cant get content if it doesnt come with an entire skill
---
You can already do that now though.
---
We pay we gay
---
ur telling me that things like Dinh Bulwark nerfs, looting bag reworks are big content changes?
---
there‚Äôs a HUGE difference between updates and content. updates are for game integrity, content is for game longevity

You either shoot Midnight's in Vegas or ya dont

You legitimately could have learned an instrument.

Yes, but now with more osrs!

What the fuck why

all skills are free if you gather your own resources, and that option means your never standing at the ge, you choose to spend 40mill becuase you want peak xp/hr.

my thinking was always that after you voted it would show the results, kinda seems dumb to keep them hidden even after you vote

we are all neckbeards on this blessed day
---
I skipped it. I like the skill in theory, but I don't trust Jagex to successfully implement it in a balanced way due to their poor track record. I'm also not 100% sure how I feel about a new skill in OSRS. I'll let the outcome be what it will.
---
They literally just made an announcement out of the blue after it's already been up for a day or whatever.  It must be failing already lmao that's why they did that.
---
Libtards entire argument got destroyed by one comment.
---
But okay, those are there because there is no suitable place.
---
Crafting = range
---
Smithing = melee
---
*warding* = magic
---
I voted no to the skill. 
---
Yes to all of the skill rewards but the elemental tomes.
---
None of you know hard to get silks are.
---
None of you know how Vis Tiers are distrivuted trought dissasembling items (from maple long bows (u) to barrows items).
---
Does tier 1 Vis scales with alch price of the item so all outputs are balanced with alching alternatives instead of being an arbitrary mess? Jagex don't know.
---
With all these weird sets, which ones will be the used to powerlevel Warding? duh
---
I think there is a weekly cap, but no idea what it is.
---
Sounds like summoning.
---
No it isn‚Äôt

To limit losses for CC fraud

What is factual is afk means away from keyboard. An example of an afk activity in runescape would be smithing cannonballs. In this activity you can click once and the activity will continue while you leave the keyboard to do something else. Smashing a key to click nonstop may not require any attention but I cannot do it while away from keyboard. Since you want to be factual. Regardless, congrats on the achievement, OP.
---
Nothing is free.
---
Efficient skilling is the cheapest if you understand opportunity cost.
---
Nuthin like a freshly cleaned scrum
---
Exactly. Expand upon the skills already in the game, do NOT do something as drastic as add a new skill. I get adding quests and content. Those build upon the skills. If you're going to add a new skill, could this still be called old school runescape? You can add land, you can add pets, quests, raids, weapons, because all of those still hold true to the heart and soul of runescape's old days, but as soon as you add a new skill, is when things start to become unrecognizable. Crafting has hardly had ANY updates. Why cant warding be a new smithing/crafting update? Maybe start making crossover training methods that require both smithing and crafting, or other combinations? Theres so much wasted potential on a new skill when the old skills can be given so much life.
---
That's a fair point, I can see why you wouldn't want it added.
---
I hate that this is the attitude now days on games. I've always preferred playing against players way better than me in anything, you learn so much more . People never used to have an issue with it 10-15 years ago either, feel like people are just to used to being spoon fed now.
---
I do want all three skills in the game.
---
This. If I make her a cup of coffee and maybe put a load of washing on I'm good for a few hours.

Not only did I get all the fossils I needed, but I also got the beaver pet.

So does that mean f2p people should be able to vote since members who use in game currency for membership can?
---
saved for later my guy

Who knows we dont have much insight on Jagex's side on this all I know is that whenever you ask for client improvement the reply you get is that it requires engine work.
---
This is a team layout used in businesses who have adopted the AGILE workflow.
---
Various teams are known as Scrums, with an assigned Scrum Master. Every SM reports to a Project Manager.
---
Ideally, all team members of a Scrum meet with each other and their SM regularly to discuss development struggles, ideas and solutions, and can be reassigned as needed. The SM brings all of this back to the PM for review and approval.
---
PM should also attend regularly to address some issues head-on, or at times, answer for the powers-that-be above the PM that the SM wouldn't have access to.
---

He still is. He made one video relatively recently and said he'd be coming back full time within the next few weeks. We'll see though.

By ‚Äúwell established UI‚Äù do you mean adding one extra block to the skills menu?

I was really confident someone was going to use upvotes/downvotes as their argument so thanks for that validation I guess. Reddit does not represent the majority playerbase. This is already extremely obvious (to some, others like their bubble and don't want to acknowledge the game outside of it), but will become more obvious when we can compare the poll they have on here to the in-game poll. Also, thank god reddit doesnt represent the majority playerbase. The game would be shit. Most people on here see a couple of memes and go "Whelp, this is my stance now and its not changing unless I see more memes". 
---
If you're actually saying that Jagex would remove NMZ training as an integrity change this late in the game you are just wrong. There is no logic path to justify that.
---
Swampman good
---
getting those is also aids
---
Gz on the RC lamps. Hope they add that boss soon, I have like 30 rare fossils with no use for them.
---
Remember that that counts alts, level 2 dead hc's, and bots.
---
Jagex - ‚Äúcongratulations your total level is 2000 you have unlocked the ability to pay the game without bots‚Äù

It's a rare pet man keep it up

You can do birdhouses on Fossil Island at 5 hunter, they're probably the best way. Fossil Island is locked behind kudos at Varrock Museum though, so I don't know if you'd be able to access easily.

The old warding designs included something like that, conjuring. It wasn't well received and was removed.
---
No, you're not wrong. I made fun of it all throughout training.

Then my jaw dropped when I found out what those AGILE trainers make.

No it wasn‚Äôt

You can go back to Jossik and reclaim any completed books for a fee, as well as empty books.

?
---
He asked specifically about LMS, which had a massive change, but you go on a tangent about something else entirely?
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken they will only release a beta if people want the skill because of the amount of dev time. So unless people want the skill there won‚Äôt be a beta to see everything in action. So the only proof of concept for the skill is the blog you gotta read!
---

---
Thats akin to making unf potions untradeable, doesn't add any value, if you want to fuck urself go play ironman
---
More likely the excuse will be because it's going to fail probably 70-30. 
---
I think reddit well represents the majority opinion, just not quite enough to get warding to pass.  
---
Heck, if Dems had 70-30 popular vote majority, would have been a landslide win for them, lol.
---
i don‚Äôt think they should be removed because people are stupid enough to gamble their gp with a bot, but i do think they should be removed because they‚Äôre bots and they‚Äôre irritating.
---
They said yes means they get a beta and release the skill ONCE it's up to standard and not IF it's up to standard. Voting yes guarantees it's added by my understanding.
---
Sailing &gt; Warding
---
Many are voting no because they think it'll still have battlewards, venomous robes or nmz imbues taken out.
---
Have knocked out about 10 quests in the past 30 hours lol having an absolute blast so far mate, cheers for the welcome :)
---
I think that kind of offense would only result in a mute. not to mention if disruptive behavior wasnt a legit reason to report then they wouldnt have the option. Its not that hard to just not be an asshole
---
Yup
---
Hey, I'm in the same boat lol... All I want is one piece!
---
1) repost 2)mtx memes aren‚Äôt the thing anymore, its all about bitching about warding.
---
I'm looking to get Kandarin hard (and some progress on elite) done this weekend, I'll absolutely join! You're a legend for this.
---
Rofl, I can imagine. It's a supersimple concept to be honest, basically comes down to communication. Then again, that seems hard for most people nowadays.
---
Wow, it must be 50 bonds then lol since I haven't purchased a bond from Jagex since 2015/2016
---
You sound of salt and things aren‚Äôt that serious lol
---
Make it on the 49th floor of duneoneering so you have to be maxxed to start it
---
Ah, I see. Thanks.
---
...and why would it? I don't understand what you're trying to say. That bankstanding needs more updates since all that other stuff gets updates? As in all the content that would have you engaged in the game vs the content that literally has you watching a different show and paying minimal attention to the game? I genuinely do not follow
---
Your mom probably deactivated her credit card after the 1st 50 bond purchase.
---
Agreed brother.
---
Mystic robes is a good start and relatively cheap. Occult necklace is good for ammy, i believe a seers ring is the appropriate fremennik ring to boost magic, and if you dont mind the wilderness. Id suggest knocking out the mage arena 1 and 2 mini quests to get the imbued god capes!
---
What are you talking about? There's plenty of good/niche items being polled, pouches, incantations, some nice robe sets like thaumaturge for standards pking, thammarons might be enough to make the sceptre good, dagonhai being bis for zerks, etc.
---
i‚Äôm just getting into RC, what‚Äôs the deal with this thread?
---
Some people don‚Äôt want to make an argument for this though.  Seems like he likes OSRS just the way it is.
---
passive matchmaking that allows you to queue from an interface from anywhere in the game would really help this out. if a lobby is found for matched players, they'd get a prompt to instantly teleport to lms &amp; hop to that world, given they're in a position to be able to do so. obviously, there'd have to be limits on where you could queue, but this would solve a lot of activity related issues. with the current system, waiting for lms games is a massive waste of time unless you have constant games while the beta is still popular. this would solve that issue.
---
Reeeeee
---
No problem bud. You should look around for some good starting quests and whatnot to help get a head start with the account; if you choose to make one!
---
Okay
---
They said they didn't want to add any gathering xp for RC for "fear of devaluing the skill"
---
Monkey Madness the Sequel?
---
They're less likely to try for a new skill if this doesn't pass.
---
I won't vote until I know what durial321's stance is
---
it doesnt have to be a bankstanding buyable; comments like these are why people who vote no look like they havent read the blog.
---
So then what should they do then? Put a lot of time and resources into developing new content and risk it getting voted no by the community or poll their community to see if they like an idea so they can try to develop it, or just not ever put out major updates? 
---
I think people need to be realistic here. That second option is the best one for everyone.
---
OP isn‚Äôt here to sustain a bond, but to sustain a bank that allows him to have fun. 
---
It absolutely takes a good hundred hours to make back 200m. So from a purely financial perspecitve it makes perfect sense to buy bonds. But even more important is that most OSRS players are no longer kids with hundreds of hours available to spend on video games, let alone spending all that time just making back bank...
---
is it still there lol
---
I was right. You‚Äôre dumb.
---
I mean like you said, he just came up 15 dragon bones and what ever you were wearing.  The kill might have taken him a few minutes but in the end its still a profit!
---
Devs offer us sailing which is extremely creative and unique- *lol content is too unfamiliar no.*
---
Devs offer us a skill which has the essense of the other production skills- *lol if you only has an ounce of creativness.*
---
you dont mess with fixed mode
---
its the only way i (can) play osrs
---
I especially liked Spiili, he made pking look fun and even though he was 99 strength for most of his videos, it seemed accessible for everyone. There wasn't the element of complexity we have now. You didn't need to have 4 hands and some kind of ability to see into the future in order to bother hitting another pker. 
---
These days, while pking is still very much enjoyable, if you don't have any experience in it, you're going to burn through a good portion of your bank before you learn properly.
---
Magic is already strong enough. 
---
Smithing and crafting could really use some changes. 
---
There's already more content than 99% of players will ever reach, there doesn't need to be more content simply for the sake of more content. There only needs to be new content if it adds something interesting and/or fun. 
---
Warding includes many non-magic related things. Things like imbuing rings/antipoison lamps/etc.
---
Robes are already cheap enough, giving more ways to get more robes is only going to reduce costs for magic users.
---
Degradables aren't enjoyable. 
---
Increased resource gathering will either be useless (in the case of resources not worthwhile), or devalue the resources, and make it obsolete to gather the resources without it.
---
Nothing presented in the skill seems enjoyable. I haven't heard anyone say otherwise either, just that they want new content. 
---
It seems absurdly easy and optimal to buy your way to 99. 
---
Implementing it would take up more dev time that could be spent making something that I would like.
---
Controversial but veterans with 2200+ total should have more of a say IMO.
---
I hope some of the concepts from warding can be implemented in one way or another if it fails. Despite some of its shortcomings as a skill, I think are some cool ideas that would make sense being in game
---
Eventually, there will be a quest with a Warding req.
---
So in 15kc since this picture I have gained 48 pages, pyro legs and boots, 1 more time and 1 more Bruma torch
---
Still wondering what happened to expanding on that closed off gated area, giving rare fossils an actual use
---
This was literally me back in the old days. Never knew what the fight caves were just strolled in with melee gear and an inventory of sharks lol died on the melee stage and tried again and got a little bit further and was wondering just how close I got to the end. Well now I know, not even close bud
---
Just run the game in like 1080p or something then
---
Then we could finally call osrs it's true name: SlayScape
---
Not sure what being Ironman has to do with it
---
Yeah I‚Äôm the same way, but it shouldn‚Äôt be this way. You shouldn‚Äôt be having a fair 1v1 and worrying about someone logging under them or a scout to chuck a TB.
---
Might be a minor boss fight and final boss along the way though... Probably nothing like Galvek , maybe a Kruk fight...
---
Nice gear
---
Or you can not buy it, you have a choice.
---
Call him the Under Butler because that is the traditional name for someone ranked directly under the Butler. Also the word Under has connotations of the underworld. Making this a double joke.
---
Ya 1/35609-current level. For gnome course. 
---
So 1/35605 if he‚Äôs lvl 4.

I'm guessing there is a wintertodt screenshot with this being said and people just memed it
---
On one hand I'm cynical about any positive changes to runecrafting because of the aforementioned people who don't want the xp rates or the skill itself to change, but Wintertodt was successfully added and changed fm training for the better. On the other hand, if warding fails, I don't see enough support to add the mechanics to other skills either.
---
*can't afford to train it in the most efficient training method.

Voting no on the skill is the same as voting no on everything else, your one no vote makes all your yes votes useless.
---
I honestly can't think of anything worse to navigate in the entire game..
---
Use them all to vote no on alts
---
Nah it's not
---
there‚Äôs been 1 new raid, maybe 2 new pets, zeah sucked, maybe 2-3 new quests that took 2 seconds, and LMS was out of our control. This evidence to push warding is as shit as the stuff stuffed everywhere in that spongebob episode.
---
Im voting yes
---
Black dhide and rune platebodies can be mass produced but still has some value. Besides that the best ranged and melee gear cannot be crafted anyways. Why would it be any different with warding?
---
EoC would have been fine if they launched a separate game for it but it definitely ruined RS
---
Really? Tell me how not?
---
it's almost as if learning curves are a foreign concept for redditors
---
also, you never get steamrolled in your first fights. most people i see in first rounds are absolute noobs unable to steamroll anybody. this guy clearly hasn't even tried lms if he says that. or, just makes his opinion based on hearsay, as is typical of reddit
---
You again. Why did you have to remind me of that name
---
I like to give out food and low level armor. And then remind them to pay it forward when they can.
---
Jeeesus m8, you might wanna check with someone about your problem.
---
So do you only leave combat after 3 rounds?
---
Honestly, when I heard them making a mining boss, I thought that there'd be a new good way to train, and now it's probably just going to be dead content aside from tool seed drops.
---
Noobs only want warding so they can get into 2200 worlds without putting in real work
---
I hope you‚Äôre kidding. If not; do you know what opportunity cost means? Gathering all the resources for a 99 could take a full year, or I could just spend 100M and make 150M in two-three months or less with a decent money making method. Do you still think gathering resources for a 99 is free? Time is money.
---
Collect vis (magical material) by splashing, buying or dissolving/reforging/whatevertheotheronewas. Collect physical materials, mostly from Hunting moths. Make a Ward or approach an ingame Ward, and create robes a la Crafting armor. Seems no worse to train than any other production skill, and half of the required gathering is also part of the same skill.
---
Just started OSRS and there's seemingly white text over every dropped item, and in certain contexts I can barely see anything because there is so much white text. How do i get rid of this, please?
---
Big yikes if true.
---
There is so few of them. Keep getting less, of you don‚Äôt have a total go to w347 or 348 and you won‚Äôt see them almost ever.
---
Loses its charm when you all follow the same guide

You have to unlock it with 1000 artisan points first to have a chance of getting that task.

What new gear? The easter outfit? lmao play the game for more than 2 hours kid

how are other skills more involved than a buyable like crafting or fletching? run mindless laps around an obstacle course or to and from an essence altar, afk click a rock, etc
---
Lumbridge to Varrock.
---
Main can get boring, iron unlocks a lot more end game content imo
---
not poll shit content like warding
---
I'm a naked boner lol. I'm a flat noob. Wild scares me. I just want my prayer up a little so I can go back to slayer. I see your point and I'm not necessarily complaining it's just kind of lame to hunt down broke noobs trying to do low level skills or what nots. I'm sure I'll feel the opposite one day when I'm Big and strong and have a decent bank. By far the best game especially being able to play mobile. And the community is wonderful for the most part :)
---
And?
---
Give it to someone in exchange to learn how to take a screenshot

I like solution 2 better, if ironmen can't get any loot then why should anyone be able to retrieve it after death?
---
Good news! You don't have to train warding. And you can buy everything that the skill makes on the GE. It's like herblore. You don't have to train it, you can just buy your potions on the GE.
---
Making it dead content on arrival is pointless, and also defeats the entire point of making a skill which has an item sink built into it. Dissolving will be great for runescape economy which is currently experiencing massive deflation.
---
Keep talking like that, you're gonna catch some massive chops.
---
lol and they say no voters should read the blog
---
Add it to warding skill.
---
Is your brain functioning correctly my friend?
---
The polling system is in the game for a reason, and that is to insure that 75% of members above 300 total are ok with an update before they add it. It has its pros and cons, but i would argue its good for the game. The devs have the job of making content that the players will like. Im pretty sure jmods have said that they will continue to propose new skills in the future untill they make one which players are happy with if warding fails.
---
Ahh, the uim way.

Infernal Eels make a lot more money than White Berries... and there's no banking involved. the idea is stand there all day and you an easy 1-2 mill. Needs 80 fishing and a fire cape.

When I look at the forum post about the proposal for blood and soul runes, they mention you'd reach the advertised xp rates with a high effort approach. I'd assume they were talking about doing the dart-like clicking instead of afking the inventory.
---
Addy is fine no need for rune just get occult fury godbook buy supplies with rest your good to go with void bp and trident
---
Option one would probably require a little too much engine work.

Option 2 makes sense. How many ironmen actually get kills though?

---
Im sure this is something that would be polled. Theyd have a whole poll revolving around its impact on current systems and stuff.
---
&gt; A new skill should be added when Jagex think of a fun and creative idea, not when they need to fix years of lazy development.
---
How does the scope and breadth required to permanently fix game-breaking faults within game design not warrant a new skill?
---
And I say game-breaking because in time there will be so much shit in the game the only thing that stops prices plummeting in price will be the alch value. 
---
Please also explain to me how this isn't a creative method of doing that. You want Jagex to fix this themselves - well, what do you want them to do, put a tax or lost-in-transaction feature on trading in the GE to funnel money or items out of the game? People would be fucking livid. Explain your opinion to me cause all I'm hearing is whinging disguised as wisdom.
---
They're also used in super Defence pots, which are also part of the Super Combat potion.... They're the last potion in the super set, so the berries do play an important role.

Much more productive growing White Berry bushes and harvesting them durring farm runs than picking them in the wild anyway. they always grow back on the same bush, and between 12 - 36 at a time.

Well, games usually take around 1 hour if ur new (all 10 waves).

I can show you how to do any of the roles. And yeah, waiting for pm :P

It shouldn't be possible to keep all your accounts f2p and then bond them up the day of the poll to vote. That's unfair for people who keep their accounts subscribed year round.

If warding passes, then Xerican armor should be removed from crafting and added to warding.

Respectfully, I don't think you know what you're talking about. K top/blessed top &amp; tassets have long been the meta at gorillas and provide the best mix of stats. 
---
Defence absolutely matters, you want high ranged defence since that's the only damage type you'll be taking if you do everything right. If you're getting maxed a 31 every time you get ranged out of a melee phase, your trip will be over quickly. Since the post above, I believe that's why the meta has evolved to now take a Ring of Suffering (i) - for both the ranged def and prayer bonus.

The OP wasnt downvoted, people repeating it like parrots have been. That guy had a well written post on his thoughts which while I may disagree with him are still valid and valuable opinions. People get downvoted by posting it because they aren't thinking for themselves, they want to vote no for "a" reason so they latch onto that post because they can't be assed to think for themself.

That's great, thank you. That's not as long as I had expected, which is good! I'll probably try and stick to the easier roles initially to get the Queen kill, and it means I can then grind out the points for the torso at a later stage.

I actually PM'd you in game a few days ago but didn't hear back, so I presumed you must have been in the middle of a Barbarian Assault game. I'll try again tomorrow and see if you're free then!

---
Ohhh does his attacks change up or like how he would rotate around the ship and send waves at you, is that still part of the fight?
---
I might pk on my ironman if I had a reason to. Even pking just for the fun of it is a reason but watching someone that you just killed run back and grab their loot kind of ruins that. The context of this suggestion was when I killed a pker who dropped a bunch of unexpectedly valuable stuff and then got to watch him run back, grab his stuff, and have another go at killing me.
---
It's unfixable.
---
They dont go for it...
---
So should we ban Mod Ash too since he made a poll for the same reasons? Hiding results prevents players from seeing what is passing or failing; seeing what Reddit, Twitter, or any other subcommunities are thinking is not the same thing. For example, this Strawpoll has different results from our Reddit Poll.
---
I don't agree with the spite voting but I can understand it. 
---
When the PvP community wants a change there is a large portion that votes no out of spite. You can't spite vote against a community and expect them not to spite vote your content. 
---
This leads to players caught in the middle who are impartial getting screwed.
---
Please don‚Äôt do the same this year, can‚Äôt afford to have our vote spread out amongst irrelevant candidates like that.
---
Someone just give me a bond hahaha. Free money right üòõ
---
Not really the point though, they‚Äôd focus their time on other content which is better received. There is a cost associated with development, if a piece of work is trashed at the end that is waste
---
What if, they add an important ingredient which is untradeable and only obtainable through certain activities like killing magical creatures? And don't come at me with lvl 3 skilling pures, it's 2019.
---
probably lvl 1 everything else.
---
Yeah, I just said that because people love to overinterpretate everything.
---
As the guy below pretty rudely pointed out, we already have an insane abundance of every good item in the entire game dropping from PvM, is it really such a bad thing that a single niche of gear gets tied to a skill? I believe they've already said that even if high level gear was added to warding, the items needed to craft it would still come from high level PvM, similar to prims/pegasian/w.e but with warding rather than RC.

---
Not 1? A little more complicated and probably a little more controversial (and hence less likely to pass a poll), but all it really does is take what I can already do now with two accounts (pk on a non-ironman, alch the drops, buy a bond, trade the bond to my ironman) and remove the complication of having to have two accounts.
---
While everyone is distracted i just want to say bruh.

Fun fact, I actually completed my first Jad kill without Assembler. As in, I literally forgot to bring it, it was like my 6th try and I was getting tired of trying erveryday so I just geared up quickly. I kept wondering why there were so many darts on the floor and then I saw I was rocking my Ardy cloak 2.
---
Maybe I still have the screenshot somewhere.
---
They literally said the opposite of this but whatever you need to lie about
---
indeed it would
---
That doesn't really make sense because the only thing stopping warding from having meta changes is people voting no for it. Jagex has straight up said that if warding passes they won't be adding it to the game until it is in a state that both the the developers and the playerbase agrees is satisfactory. If you really wanted warding to be a strong item sink or add a strong incentive, actaully vote yes for it so they can add it. 
---
There is only so much they can do with a skill before it passes a poll, and it can only really be truly fleshed out once it has been tested and put into a beta server. Which will never happen if it just gets voted down before they can do any work on it. 
---
So many no voters I have seen keep using the same justifications for voting no, when all of their issues with the skill would be solved by voting yes and letting them actually work on a new skill instead of drafting ideas over and over again that just keep getting shot down for not being "good enough" when they haven't even been put into development, just suggested. 
---
There will *never* be a skill proposed that ticks all the boxes people want if every skill suggestion gets shot down by people like that before it can even be developed. If you want a good new skill, let them actually make one. Once it has passes a poll, it will still be a very long time before it gets released, and all of that time in between initial poll and release will have other new polls related to it side-by-side with development in order to add what is needed to make the skill what everyone wants it to be.
---
Pass solution 2 and I will be more likely to pk on my ironman. Pass solution 1 and I will definitely start pking on my ironman. Or at least choose to fight over running away more often than I do now.
---

---
Can a dumbass like me be filled in on who this is? I don't know what's going on.
---
Again, stop trying to think like a developer. You aren't a developer. Do *you* want it or do you not want it, because *you* would personally use it, not because you predict that *other* people would or would not use it? I'll say it one more time, the devs do not need you to help them predict the popularity of a suggestion, they are more than capable (and better equipped than you) of doing that themselves.
---
On Fandom i find my things quicker. 
---
More logic way to find what u look for. 
---
Its in the small things...
---
I know how the scaling works, but I wouldn't go as far as only calling it 10% of the game
---
So you refuse to join the reddit hive mind so you join the anti-reddit hive mind?
---
&gt;It's strange how they spent so much time perfecting it or getting the community to accept it before they poll it. I get it's a big update and getting feedback is important but it does seem like they want the skill in the game.
---
How is literally anything about that strange? Why would they poll something they don't want to pass? Why would they work on or suggest it if they didn't want it? Why wouldn't they spend as much time as they can perfecting it and designing it so the community accepts it?
---
It would never pass a poll if they didn't put time into it. It still probably won't pass because of how many people are dumb enough to think it isn't quite good enough yet and if it passes it will be added to the game exactly how it is now and nothing will be changed about it in any way.
---
But most importantly, what are you even trying to say? Do you think it is a bad thing for the developers to be passionate about the updates they are attempting to add to the game? Do you want a team of indifferent apathetic developers that don't care about any of the work they create? If the people making the content don't give a shit why would the community? Do you think Forthos Dungeon was a shitty update and that there was something wrong with the fact that the people that put time, effort, and passion into making it wanted it to be added to the game? Do you think it would have passed with only 7.5% of people voting "no" if the developers didn't want it added to the game and didn't work on it with the goal of adding it to the game?
---
I wish I had Aspergers so I could get 99 RC without killing my self .
---
True but 99.99% of players would not have fun playing like him. He's playing the game on the absolute highest difficulty possible. Locking content for the sake of locking content won't appeal to most players.
---
Yiu mean it would be like going to the grocery store and buying 2 bunches of bananas when other people only buy 1, cuz you really fucking like bananas
---
There‚Äôs enough good guide on YT on killing Vorkath. Quest Vorkath is a lot easier to kill on top of that. There‚Äôs a few unique mechanics which you need to learn but are not hard to understand and you‚Äôll have it done fast enough. Now Galvek is where you should be more worried and spend some time looking into beforehand.
---
My best advice for Vorkath is to turn of run energy though!
---
&gt; How does the scope and breadth required to permanently fix game-breaking faults within game design not warrant a new skill?
---
You can do that without a new skill. Like everyone else said, this can be done by adding the item sink into other skills. Runecrafting for example has almost no content because all the runes are easily available through PvM, it could use an update. 
---
&gt;what do you want them to do, put a tax or lost-in-transaction feature on trading in the GE to funnel money or items out of the game?
---
Yes, a GE tax has been suggested for a while in this game by a lot of people. GE makes trading way too convenient compared to the old text spam in falador system, which is great imo but shouldnt be free of cost. 
---
&gt;Explain your opinion to me cause all I've been seeing on Reddit and Twitter and in-game is whinging disguised as wisdom.
---
Warding is fundamentally boring. It's just another processing skill like crafting or fletching where you just sit in bank for 100ish hours and you get 99. It's not fun, I really doubt anyone has actual fun cutting yew logs for hours. Like I said, it feels more like they designed a skill to solve an issue, not to be fun. Back in RS2 every new content would be unbalanced but most people wouldn't care because they would be fun to play. A good example of a skill would be dungeoneering, it's fun to play despite the broken rewards it offers. Hell, let's say they were to port the dungeoneering skill to OSRS they could add an item sink to it. 
---
Ex.: you can bring items into the dungeon for an advantage, but once you leave the dungeon you lose everything on you.
---
Then people would bring cheap alchables like rune armor or black d'hide in to get a boost every run.
---
Personally, I'm against the idea of dungeoneering in OSRS because I feel like it's too similar to CoX, but that was just an example to show you how a fun concept could be altered to also solve an inherent issue in the game.
---
add the stuff to existing skills and i'd vote for it in a second.

I‚Äôd argue a new skill in a game someone never played before is hardly enticing anyone to join, if anything it‚Äôs more of a keep current players invested by giving them something else to do, which is fine.

I don't like that, you can come loot it on your main tbh

Well it's end-game both in the sense there's nothing better defensively and it is obtained as a raid drop, which requires developed accounts to complete and obtain. Idk if I'd call a 5 - 6m item dirt cheap, but certainly for its effectiveness it could cost much more than it does. 
---
Infact I wish this was the way that Jagex handled it; rather than nerfing they could have decreased the droprate and inflated the price so it at least costed as much as an OP item they claimed it was.  I'm curious why they didn't go that path honestly because I haven't really seen anybody discuss why that wasn't a viable option.

70 is a high requirement in the scheme of how the game was planned initially but staying on topic I‚Äôd bet my left nut we never see a warding quest requirement anywhere near that

So i wanted to convert before giving it to him to sort of have a good indication of where my work ends and his starts. He is just gonna play as a normal ironman and try to go for pets mainly. As for the clue stashes i didnt dip into any of them cause i figured normal irons use it so why bother.
---
Not a thing
---
I‚Äôve only ever seen this pic on this sub, any one know the context or origin?  Hands down a classic
---
why tho lmao 1 vorkath alt probably beats this in terms of value.
---
My point is that if they want to be an edge lord and spite vote that is pretty much as valid as anyone else‚Äôs reason. These kind of flaws are present in all polling systems
---
I mean gosh i maxed the account back in highschool 2 years back. Its been sitting for a long ass time and i dont care about the game much anymore.
---
Will it be f2p? Also when is agility becoming f2p?
---
You do it like this.

You forgot the part where he knocked her up and moved back to Lithuania
---
Well what the fuck, I spent like 2 months grinding that character from fresh, to get obby armor and high construction level, it can't just disappear..
---
And if I didn‚Äôt :)
---
I like the idea but surely this will only lead to fixed matches and clans betting against themselves... You wouldn't be able to have spectators gamble on it
---
It‚Äôs bullshit. Would be cool if they could integrate runelite. Sucks about your items, how much did you lose?
---
Happy Leif erikkson day
---
K. And I'll file that under "not a good or convincing argument." Especially in this case where the drop rate isn't going to change, only the effective drop rate for players that kill monsters both in P2P and F2P. Do I not deserve the cape as much as you because a few thousand of my imp and hill giant kills happened to be on an F2P server?
---
Well it sounds like you made more than one account and just made the character look the same on them all because the only way your skills get reset to 1(not 0 btw) is if you were caught cheating and jagex reset the skills you botted. Also not sure if osrs does this but rs3 in f2p worlds your members skills show level 1-5 even if you leveled them in,members back then
---
Good to know others think this way when doing polls.
---
Ranged in f2p is fine. they are tinkering with the f2p spellbook though.
---
No i meant the guys hyping him up, im from denmark myself so i know what a scandinavian accent sounds like
---
So the one little poll that‚Äôs important for integrity and pushing the future of OSRS is just 1 of hundreds of others that do the same thing voted by the ones who just want content whether it‚Äôs good or not, but won‚Äôt vote for that 1.
---
Art of the deal
---
Gonna be such a let down when it is added to the game, no way in hell devs would put in all that time to just scrap it, easy to say it passed the poll.
---
Revs
---
I get that tech/security isn't your thing so bear with me.
---
&gt; People stealing runescape accounts from fake private servers for ages 
---
Not via keyloggers/malware. People getting hacked by playing on private servers usually get hacked because they use their official RS username/password to register with the private server. A lot of time it's not even the server owners hacking them, it's just that private servers tend to have pretty poor security standards.
---
If this is a **fake** private server, as you're now saying, then the server does not exist. The entire thing is a ruse to trick people into installing malware. Runescape accounts are the last of people's worries at this point as the entire phone is now compromised. That being said, even malware on rooted phones is still pretty limited in what it's able to do. This has nothing to do with a Runescape private server and 100% to do with running untrusted code on your device.
---
If this is a **real** (but still malicious) private server, then all they're probably doing is what I mentioned above. They go through the list of players on the private server and just try entering their credentials in to the official website.
---
dsword is better than dlong, and you might want to put granite hammer just before that
---
I am part of the problem with this country because I voted for someone I believe in? How about the 60% of the population that doesnt even bother to vote?
---
Where the fuck is that logic
---
At first I was really upset the community was so split and arguing, but at this point I‚Äôm just laughing at all the memes.
---
It does set a precedent to keep adding new skills, which some of us DONT WANT
---
I'm not concerned about being scammed, I'm just really curious what their motive is.
---
a
---
And you really think adding a total req will remove more bots than players?
---
Not meant to be an argument, take a chill pill, and Sorry to break it to you a few thousand is a drop in the bucket. So get over it and get to killing.
---
Personally I didn‚Äôt like raising past lvl 126 and getting the charms on every drop. Super ‚Äúno change is good change.‚Äù
---
but what will he vote on them :^)
---
I have heard continuous rumors that devs are going to stop developing new skills if this one doesn‚Äôt pass. I really want new skills so I‚Äôm voting yes for that alone.
---
Is there a way to get the dps calculator to check cannon accuracy?
---
I know I didnt make another account with the same email / name, it cant be done, and I didnt do any botting, all done on mobile.. 
---
Also, a few other member skills like thieving are at like 3 or 4, so i have some progress, but not nearly what i had. Although I did get emails saying the account was compromised, so i put an authenticator and changed all my passwords.. do you think they botted on my account and Jagex reset a bunch of it?!
---
If you use a private server like this you deserve it tbh
---
There's no way gary would have gotten enough electoral votes to win if he got any and in that case Congress would have probably voted trump in anyway.
---
I skipped the actual question on warding and then voted yes or no for all the possible perks/add-ons that would come with the skill. I don‚Äôt care whether it gets added or not. But if it does get added, then I‚Äôll say what I‚Äôd want it to come along with.
---
Efficiency scape or die... if you can‚Äôt do this skill in 30hours or less your a cheap noob and should quit the game.
---
holy fuck i had to come back and look at these
---
After no success with my previous setup, I decided to get 75 ranged and use a blowpipe.
---
Holy cringe.
---
Add another green pixel and I‚Äôll do it.
---
I did ds2 yesterday and I have 10 kc with two heads xd
---
I have 3 99s and my total level is less then 1250. I feel like it should be based on xp
---
Do DS2 if you haven't, the ava's upgrade is real nice
---
There's ourania, then simple altars. 
---
You're just wrong, crybaby.
---
Nope, the game is broken it seems
---
i thought people did them for xp not profit
---
Gotta say his name three times to summon him. Or sacrifice two hcim.
---
What I would give for a girlfriend who doesn‚Äôt get pissed when I play lol
---
&gt;Although I did get emails saying the account was compromised
---
Those emails are fake. They are the phishing emails.
---
anyways, post a screenshot of your account, stats don't get reset, you are making a mistake somewhere
---
Well isn't the whole purpose of the wilderness to fight other players/risk?  The whole 'not fighting in the wilderness' thing seems to line up pretty well with the word 'integrity'.
---
Is this the barcrawl miniquest?
---
I started doing vorkath for my blue drag task last night. I'm on head  4 or 5 at like 106 kg. I'm over it.
---
Ys
---
Uh. Dont hang me up on it. It might be yeah.
---
How does anyone not know this method at this point?
---
he just said its 4m per hour lol
---
what a waste of effort
---
I hope not.  That quest line sucks
---
Most redditors on the contrary pay more attention to collapsed comments because human beings are drama whores.
---
Also, you mean like my top comment in this chain? Maybe that's another reason no voters are mocked - you bitch about how downvotes are censoring you but do the same exact shit when you can.
---
That's the thing - you're not bitching that it's happening, you're bitching that it's happening to you.
---
Omg 3m, don't spend it all at one place
---
Wrong thread, JMods don't read this one. Try the Q&amp;A thread posted weekly on Mondays/Tuesdays depending on your timezone.
---
Holy tl;dr
---
I literally would've quit runescape if it weren't the skill ceiling prayer flicking presents
---
It's *barely* an exploit to begin with because the effort put into doing it really only opens the doors for bringing less food on slayer trips, doing quest bosses, doing PvM without matching the required level but having insane skill, and PvP. It's not CRAZY useful for how much effort you need to put in. If it were totally broken no one would ever buy ppots, but hey it's still valued pretty damn high.
---
Not sure where you're pulling this "weren't supposed to get 99s" from, even Runite Smithing has 90+ requirements and that's as OG as it gets. 85+ represents the end-game for every skill. You weren't supposed to get 200m exp.
---
70 is "pretty high" but it isn't an impossibility. If you're entering the med-game with maybe only a few non combat stats 60+ then I guess it looks daunting. Tough shit there's a whole bunch of content between you and the quest that has that requirement. 70 is where as a new player you begin so see a bit more grind between the levels. That's just how levelling is designed.
---
As a counterpoint to all the doom and gloom being spread around. What if Warding ends up being unexpectedly fun to train? What if Warding ends up having the best questline in the game? What if Warding ends up being the most useful skill to level up for your account. What if Warding revamps PvM so you don't get the same old setups when bossing.
---
I think Warding has more potential than pretty much every other skill.
---
His real names Clarence, and his parents have a real good marriage
---
Except for warding to be relevant it needs to be tied to other skills and quest req
---
Spongebob has the most and most versatile meme formats
---
Bots aren‚Äôt the problem. it‚Äôs the shitty bank standers that sit around memeing a skill that could be good for the game.
---
I voted no because I don't agree with Warding being a fun skill
---
Preach it!
---
If you're doing slayer, just train defence by bursting slayer tasks, and do 85 str first, then atk. Otherwise do str -&gt; atk -&gt; def
---
No you didnt you r-word
---
but if you did you could just link your comment that your responded to ME with the actual LINK

not sure how i can make this more clear to you

Gz! Recently filed the basement too and I'm now hodling the rest of my fossils for the future update.

Imagine being in a relationship where you can't do the things you want to do because your partner doesn't want you to.
---
Also ya. Skills dont reset and jagex doesnt reset them anymore. They just outright ban accounts now. Dont trust emails and never click links. Go to the website your self
---
None like rs3‚Äôs home tele system

Dude your reading comprehension sucks.

I remembered hearing about A Friend but never knew what their deal was. 
---
Also, I just realised what the title meant. I literally thought it meant some friend of OP/OSRS community and not A Friend.
---
Should be absolutely fine. If you're really worried you can add some purple sweets maybe like 50-100 to eat up between waves.
---
Make sure to checkout the wave prediction spreadsheet and get a 'good' Jad spawn spot.

What's in the BP tho, addy?

Lol bro there were both max cash stack spawns and free twisted bows, if you think the economy isn‚Äôt already fucked you are naive or ignorant
