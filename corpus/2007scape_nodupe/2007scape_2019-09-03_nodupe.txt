Jesus Christ the guy with 40k hours.

Right, my bad
---
nightmare zone there is people who create accounts and afk NMZ. they get 99 att str def hp then sell them for around 150$ pretty sad
---
Logs at GE will be fastest however it’s not afk and decently click intensive.
---
Nnice
---
Funny thing is I probably wouldn't have noticed it in his inventory had he just left it normal lol
---
OSRs is so original that everyone copy and pastes the same images over and over 60 times over. Not even good ones mind you, because all the good ones are banned.
---
Nice
---
those look a lot like the dried mealworms i put in my bird feeder
---
Shouldn't he just say swamp is his main at this point and the old one is an alt.
---
99 pray / 99 con / 99 herb
---
That’s awesome
---

---
I fail to see what osrs has to do with meme culture in general? This issue you have is pretty standard across the internet.
---
My mum's just broken her ankle but this video just came out, just I know which takes priority
---
Check the we do raids discord. They have a full break down of what you should have as a base and what your upgrade order should be.
---
Do ZMI. Use all lamps and tears xp on rc
---
D
---
They're worth 5m *only* because swamp man pays 5m for them.
---

---
The expected value for opening them is much much less. Certainly under 100k, i've heard as low as 5k each
---
More loot for me.
---
Imo the inability to land hitsplats during transitions and the god awful slayer xp are its biggest problems.
---
What the fuck.
---
Invest it in an alt so you can grind while you grind.
---
It's used for a clue step I believe or diary
---
Nah, I believe ya. Shoulda asked him to take a picture with ya or seen the whole shirt
---
nice
---
Can anyone explain me if there is a big dps difference between the rune crossbow and the karil's crossbow ?
---
Depends what you're looking to do
---
He's only here to be contrarian, so I wouldn't count on it.
---
Im on OCE server Yojamba or whatever its called I havent hit a single queue yet lol
---
I was just making a joke
---
I've never pkd either so that would be good practice
---
Does rfd require ds1? I always just do ds1 on new accounts cause you need it for ds2 anyway so I'm not sure now lol
---
its been my current fashion scape for a while with the ghost robes. I really like it
---
Reddit thinks gargoyles are good gp bro don't bother LOL
---
Thing is, bbds have a good drop table even without dfh, and wyrms are slayer creatures. 
---
People don't go out of their way to kill vyrewatch
---
justiciar isn't good at vorkath, you should be using bandos with serp/slayer helm if you're meleeing. that will help a lot with the negative magic bonus, it should put you above -65
---
&gt; Just go make a rune crossbow 
---
Because you can't. It's impossible for him to get/make the crossbow string in Morytania. 
---
&gt;I feel like relying on a drop you can't get in mory tania
---
It *is* possible for him to get a crossbow drop from an Imp though in Morytania. This video is literally him working on getting the drop...
---
Simple. Nut more than once and dont clean up.
---
I love watching tank videos just wish I had the money for one myself.
---
It happened more than 6 months ago, meaning it has left the spoiler warning zone. You snooze you lose bud.
---
thanks i hate it
---
Sorry to chime in so late, but I don't understand why you're being downvoted. The others, such as /u/bulletbrainsurgery and /u/A_Freaking_Potato, are both completely correct in that you should really, truly prioritize your Slayer Helmet over anything else if you are Slaying; it is incredibly strong and is essentially best-in-slot over \*any\* other helmet when worn during your task. However, it is stupid for people to downvote you for either not knowing this, or just you not caring and wanting to play the game how you want, which is totally cool and should not be downvoted.
---
The account is locked to content found in morytania, and lucky implings are content found in morytania.  No idea how that's a cop out.
---
Almost 1k kc no mega rare in my name, can I steal that luck?
---
where do you live that games costed $5???
---
I remember buying N64 games in the late 90s and early 2000s and they were all starting at $59.99 CAD
---
Wt is bad xp
---
The enchanted ruby/diamond bolts make it much stronger than kbow, yes
---
You'll want to invest that straight into stats, they're much more valuable than gear by a very big margin. Of course it doesn't look as good but whatever lol
---
I like how people say stuff like "lul, it's the wildy, don't go if you don't want to get pked" when clue hunters complain yet act self righteous and pretend to take the moral high ground when it comes to venezuelans
---
Wow

6m now

This was a really good one

Ask him when the next video is coming out.

when it takes a few days to get that money xd

i'm sorry

rcb good
---
I don't know. I feel like fairy rings are too OP already. I wouldn't want to add more utility to them.
---
Well it's interesting. He could very well be purposefully not training range so as to not spoil it until the video is out. I know he obviously doesn't usually train in such a fashion that hides his motives from the highscores but he still has other training, like melees, that he still has to get through so him not training range right now isn't exactly wasting time or anything.
---
Oh yeah, I’m a big btw

Shit joke

can't do this without wifi/unlimited data plan tho. chrome remote desktop uses tons of data every hour

Hes right ya know, love swampyman as much as the next but he is an ultimate iron man account.

really true i got scammed for bank after anti scamming for 100k l0l but now im at 30m (20m after spending shit on prayer/recources that no longer exist/dying when pking ppl that got vengance/repairing torso..d defender..void range...buying expensive items and selling them again after doing what i wanted with em....i high alchd my lava whip yesterday which got me to 18/16m
---
It's the flex.
---
for 7 usd u get 4m while for that money u can get 14m gp from a gold farmer
---
Well he is probably gonna quit the game now.
---
Deffo max cmb on this and keep everything else 69, then you will reach legendary status
---
Why the fuck would I go to a club in morytania
---
Yes. If money is not an issue, I would burn yew logs from 60-90 (-1 gp/xp) and redwood logs from 90-99 (-0.8 gp/xp).
---
At ~65k/hr (not the max highest rate, but close enough)
---
65-77 would take roughly 15 hrs
---
15 hrs over the weekend isn't that crazy, especially if he considers friday afternoon to be part of the weekend.
---
Nope it’s correct, you only need to get approval before collecting. Been doing this for years can confirm
---
And guess what dood? You can still one hit them in 100k worth of gear with AGS/Claws to G Maul. There's a reason people sit on high HP, and it's because there are weapons in the game capable of hitting 80+.
---

No clue. All I know is the wiki page for the Dhcb says it doesn't work on Elvarg.

Rate my fight caves setup.  It's my first fight caves.  70 prayer, 78 range, 78 defence, 85 hp.  Ironman so no blowpipe or ranging/bastion potions.
---
Thanks

Tribrid with overheads is nhing. I think no honor name mainly comes from edgeville pkers getting frozen repeatedly, prayed against, and far casted. Nhing, brid, tribrid, etc is pretty much all interchangeable. I've heard of mage melee hybrid, but I think that's more of a specific thing you agree to similar to a risk fight

What prayer lvl do I unlock protect from cuteness
---
does the bonecrusher give prayer exp for chewed bones???
---
i saw a random +15 prayer exp while killing mith dragons with a bonecrusher in my inventory that had me concerned i just burned my dragon full helm...
---
no elvarg 2 is the 1st then you fight elvarg in ds2
---
Why can't  you be tb'd and clanned in pvp worlds?
---
Monsters can't hit you above yoir current go, so if you are at one hp they can only hit 1s, thus only using one absorption point. If you have higher hp they are using more absorption points per attack so you through them quicker.
---
Decide special weapon. Figure out what maximum damage is for said weapon. Multiply that by 3/4. Expect to hit that. Assume vengeance will hit 25 damage. Fight your opponent normally until their HP is somewhere less than the 3/4 max + 25 range. Cast Vengeance and use special.

This isn't perfect but it roughly translates into what it becomes.

---
Warding was probably more complex than most skills we already have. It is comparable to Crafting, sure. But out of all skills, Crafting is probably the most utile (Or Herblaw). Polled today, Woodcutting, Mining, Smithing (due to xp rates) Firemaking, Agility, Thieving, Fletching, Farming, Hunter, RC, and Slayer would ALL fail a poll. Fletching is the best example of what implemented Warding would be like - a skill where we can already buy the items, with a few very useful items, that come from materials we gather elsewhere. I was sad to see Warding not come into the game. I was pissed off to see it happened because of the community.

Let me know I need 55 runecrafting before I head back to members for fremenik exiles. And holy shit i made like 5 inventory of water tiaras and stopped.

92+ Herb  is good for making Divine supercombat potions and 90 is good for making Overload+ in Raids 1 but I wouldn't say Herb is a relatively useful 99 compared to Crafting or Magic/Ranged/HP or some others that are essentislly buyable

I'd say being able to teleport directly to Nardah from anywhere and taking a carpet ride still beats equipping a dramen/lunar staff, finding a ring, entering the code, running quite a bit in the desert, and having the Agility level req for the shortcut. Not to mention the existing redirect scrolls already devaluate it much more than this would.

Can the pharaohs sceptre and Khardest memoirs have their left click option set to equip? It’s frustrating to accidentally teleport.

---
Could the shortcuts between the Catacombs of Kourend and the overworld be looked at to be better lined up? Places like the Edgeville Dungeon and Underground Taverly do a good job of having multiple dungeon entrances stay consistent in distance and direction between the overworld and the dungeon. The catacombs, however, don't see that same alignment, causing it to feel like it's missing that polish RS is known for.
---
its exactly that on pc. Imagine you're woodcutting on your main account on your computer. You literally click and wait till you're idle.  
---
While the main is idle getting xp, you are free to do fuck all on your alt.  
---
It's not just afk stuff either, nowadays that my alt is stationed at rune drags, I can pretty much train any stat on my main, while killing rune drags on my alt, which makes me ~2mil / hour if I paid full attention.  
---
Plus if im honest, there were times I burnt out on my main and stopped playing my main, but playing my alt I got the "level up satisfaction" so I actually quit my main for a good month at one point and played solely on my alt as if it was my main account.

Think he mentions it in the Vid, but just that it's a different between searching alone and it taking months, or having help and him being able to roll the Lucky Impling dice enough that he might get the Rune Crossbow in reasonable amounts of time

ITT: people who don’t get Jagex’s pricing strategy. 
---
Buying bonds in bulk already gives you a discount because you can turn them all in at once. So it doesn’t matter what price they are. If anything it makes it even easier for the consumer because you can also combine those with bonds that you buy off the GE to get even more bang for your buck.

Nova better

Op i am fully against posting rsns and witch hunts in general but! Did you report the crashers for player harassment?? If they are crashing to disrupt rather than they cant find a free world, they will most likly recive a 3day ban.

Secondly - this is about preventing them from joining other content where they’d exhibit similar behavior. I don’t give a hoot about a 3 day ban lol. I don’t want them joining a raid; specifically H8H.

I first started seeing all these posts about swampletics on r/all and thought it was just another RuneScape thing I wouldn't understand as I used to play, but stopped playing long before eoc and all that jazz came out. Played rs3 for a few weeks and quit again.
---
One day I was just bored on YouTube and decided to give one of his videos a go. I don't even watch streamers of any game but for some reason I fell in love with this series. 
---
Maybe it has to do with how insanely lucky this guy is and my luck was absolute shit when I played.
---
It's not another episode of progress. It's a video which explains the origin of Swampletics.
---
Huh I thought it was 42k. Makes my 22k seem worse than it already is, since I was using his as a comparison 😂

I think it is that they are from two persons, one gives the money and one collects the money

I wonder if one of his videos will ever hit the front page

Lmfao I saw him at the ge on too long ago had a chuckle
---
The point is that these people will specifically go to those areas to steal the imp that is meant for Swampletics, because he is lokong for it.
---
Theres no problem if you are in Morytania and see one and take it for yourself, but if someone is trying to have Swampletics grab it then that is scummy. Most people sit there and alc, and they also have a shot at 5m if a lucky imp appears and they notify him. Plus the chance at 1b if he gets the rcb. That is a game changing amount of money, I could efficiently max with that. If I am scouting (I dont) and see the imp, tell swampletics but you run over and beat him there, you just stole 5m from me, or 1B if you get a rcb. 
---
I hope in the Discord, imp locations are not public and instead just PMed to him.
---
For a decently leveled main? Sure, 200m in gear in a couple days is feasible. For a guy with base 60 stats without any great quests/unlockables? Not likely.
---
Well ya, but with bugs of this scale in the exact code uve been working on, surely ud notice something this huge fucking up within literally seconds??

15 burnt pages gz

It's pretty awful.

Would be good to offer a sink here, 2 doses for 1 barrel dose as a tradeoff for convenience

lmao that what I thought
---
&gt; You shouldn't be buying gold in the first place, what's the point?
---
This mentality is so common in the osrs community and it drives me crazy. What do you care how someone else chooses to play the game? 
---
Personally, it's worth it to me to buy bonds on occasion. As a low level player, I make like 500k an hour at best. That means it would take me 8+ hours of grinding to get 4mil gold, and that's 8+ hours of doing something that probably doesn't provide me any exp or progress in any quests. Alternatively, the cost of a bond is equal to about 20 minutes of work time at my current job.
---
Personally, paying $7 is worth saving myself 8 hours, when I have pretty limited playtime as it is.
---
The reward is a lot better than 5 gp implies because it gets rid of the hassle of having to juggle items, but it's definitely made redundant by the TP, should've been a Medium/Hard reward.
---
Nah, I do it and i sold a 7k item for 1mil. People will put a lot of money thinking it will just buy out, not realizing someone actually has an item in for a crap ton of money.  Idk how the algorithm works but it works. It's how I merch.  I don't share the items though like people on here do because it ruins it.
---
Ooof
---
You're blindly assuming Jagex doesn't ban them and gives them a privileged treatment. Your argument is null an void
---
I make 7 bucks in 12 minutes at work, no way I'm making the equivalent playing.  I bought my first bond to sell recently and plan on doing it occassionally as I see fit.  I wish I had all the free time to play more often but life and responsibilities prevent that.  I get some gold which would take me way to long to make otherwise and someone gets a couple weeks membership added onto their account.
---
This looks incredible.
---
Cool, I’ll delete this and upload a video next time it happens.
---
Sounds like good karma to me.
---
It's definitely not an issue on a 4790k with a 970 or 1080, and it hasn't affected an i5-2500 or an i7-7700k and 2070
---
Nope because no reason to be wearing void in the wilderness 
---
Have fun at pc
---
At low levels, not possible. You will spend so much time grinding the GP for a bond every 2 weeks that all your extra money is spent on them, so saving up for more efficient gear or building a house is going to take so much longer. Possible, but I would be surprised if you didnt get bored and quit.
---
Paying for bonds with GP is end game stuff, where tossing away 4m every 2 weeks is not substantial since bossing, clues and other high level activities means it doesnt take you long to make the 4m at all, and the content you are playing to make that money is fun.
---
It's not cheating, it's just his client assisting him.
---
Jk, but seriously, Jadflex needs fix this.

One potential issue is that there's an incentive to manipulate the ge prices and then all you have to do is alch.

&gt;How does the country function without a currency? 
---
It does have a currency. Just a shitty one noone want, so you only see prices tied to USD$ thanks o hyperinflation. Its so bad that even the USD$ has its own inflation inside the country.
---
&gt;Whats the governments course of action as of now?
---
Keep the power, control the media, people and money and keep stealing all they can.
---
&gt;Like, yes, there is USD as you said, but that can't work for everyone. Is there a lot of bartering?
---
It does not work for everyone, actually a lot of ppl have left the country and an amazing number of families can live thanks to the currency their ex pats can send back home.
---
&gt;What do you do with this situation?
---
Sadly, leave the country.
---
Yea, when I grind a skill for a clue I always am happy even if I get nothing as I just motivated myself enough to level that skill. I only level when its semi reasonable, like grinding from 79 to 82 thieving. If I was lvl 40 thieving but needed 85, or the requirement required a quest that needs 4 skill requirements I am far from, then thats a clue I would drop.
---
Because it displays respect to the good in the community which is often undermined by the toxic people within it
---
No problem m8, just give me your bank so you dont lose it.
---
I use bottomless on my crystal trees and get the intended amount of shards everytime. Just pointing that out.
---
I just meant wrt clue scroll gambling, if you want the fun of rolling the table you might as well go do clues. By *depending on what you do* I meant where you get the clues.
---
If you find a lucky anywhere else (except karamja cuz another uim Verf is paying like 5mil for those too), feel free to catch it with no regrets. If you find one in Mory, you'll get more money by reporting and you can still ask what he found.
---
Someone knowing about the bounty but not reporting is basically trolling himself tbh.
---
Maybe he's just rrally good
---
I gave up on the bp pretty quick after I got dhcb. Part of the problem is you have to switch from praying range to magic, because you're losing dragonfire protection from your shield. I also like to stand at max range of the crossbow to be ready to woox walk, and switching to bp means you have to get closer. Overall it's kind of a hassle and not a huge boost.
---
But yeah, the idea is that it has the most useful spec. BGS spec is still beneficial, but it doesn't matter as much for dhcb as for bp because it's already so accurate. Don't want to use too many inventory slots on melee switches because having less room for loot shortens your trips.
---
don't see anything wrong as its in-game currency. do you see anything relating to real world money?
---
Gotcha, was just wondering if there was anything obvious I was missing.
---
Yeah I think I'll just do that from now on.
---
They did this with zulrah scales so why not
---
What exactly was you paying attention to lol
---
Pretty sad how shit at rs you are and how jealous it makes. Just quit the game you will never be good you shitkid
---
LOL Do you also think it's their fault that they were born in a piece of shit country? If you'd choose runescape's economic health over 1 child going hungry in Venezuela you're a piece of shit. It's that simple. Does it suck for the economy, yeah. But it's a way for kids to eat dude. Make an ironman.

Q

I was able to knock out 77-86 for diaries in a few days when I was afking bloods. They're not fast but can be really afk and don't require too much attention. I personally don't mind more active RCing methods but I find everything but lavas not fast enough in comparison to make it worth it. And lavas I can't do for more than an hour before my wrist starts hurting so I avoid them.  
---
I made about 28m from 77-86 in mostly bloodrunes by the way, if anyone is interested in that information
---
Swear the guy didn't look that old in the original picture
---
6.99 x 3 = 21.97
---
3 bonds = 21.99
---
Is two cents, not 0.001
---
you play ovewatch gtfo 2007scape
---
I thought farming sucked before I started doing it. I just did trees until maples and fruit trees until papayas and stopped with trees at around 65 when it because too slow gains for the level. Yew seeds are still very expensive for me. I started doing farm runs, combined with birdhouses and overshot 70 farming. It was easy to do on mobile while I was working.
---
They make money off the videos. His point is that Youtubers are paying fans to help them reach goals faster, thus helping them make a living. It’s a mute point; a real stretch if you ask me, but his point none the less.
---
Nice fortnite posts. No wonder you support circumventing ironman mode, gotta get that instant gratification
---
Can’t even imagine what you look like.
---
6.99 x 3 = 20.97
---
3 bonds = 20.99 
---
2 whole cents me lad !
---
Any thoughts on my post history, OP?
---
Use Chrome remote desktop, if you're going afk nmz.
---
Stop virtue signalling so hard lmao
---
all ironman modes are still widely open in top 25 so wouldnt say that for normal account there is no chance for top 25 anymore
---
Just killed that same bot by staff bashing him while he prayed mage. I love how he automatically says gf no matter what lol
---
Dominated as in the majority of accounts there are either ahkers or bots.

---
What prompts you to add new items to the collection log? A new boss like Sarachnis was added on its release, but what about the LMS items (volcanic mine, graceful recolors, etc) is precluding them?
---
I've heard a 3x3 house is most beneficial, however I struggle to have everything i need in such a confined space. Does anyone know the difference in loading times between 3x3 and say 4x3 or 4x4?
---
No one dies to them... even a mobile f2p pvm only could beat them. The only thing those type of bots do is make the games shorter for normal players. Lms now requires 150 total so the sucide lvl 3s shouldnt be as much a problem.
---
The Holocaust happened more than 70 years ago but people aren't going to forget such atrocity

Lol

It is, you Just have a non-usable part of the screen outside of the interface.

You can see the game on that part of the screen,Just cant click it.

Big sad

&gt; If gold farming is a means to an end, what is the end? You farm gold and make money and feed your families for now, but what happens when Jagex finally plugs the holes that allow this to happen?
---
You said it. The end is feeding your family, you cant feed game integrity to them. ~~When~~ *If* jagex do something about it people will move on to another things probably. I know i did once selling gold wasnt enough for me. Now i just provide services instead, whats your opinion on that?
---
&gt;Why not redirect the effort into trying to fix the situation in Venezuela?
---
These are usually the kind of questions that makes me want to talk about our situation. Why do you think we havent tried and fight to change our current situation? There has been massive protests, countless deaths, several political incarcerations and if im not mistaken now more than 4million venezuelans have fled the country  in the last 6 to 7 years (Our population is about 30 million) 
---
Dude my whole generation doesnt know more than disgrace, economic failure and a fucking crazy and dystopian sociaty. Most people are just surviving, trying to eat at least once a day let alone dont have the strenght(nor the means) to fight against a regime that controls all the military power, even what and when you fucking eat. People starving left and right, people diying in hospitals because theres not electricity, not to talk that even the most common of the diseases can easily kill you because you cant even find medicines.
---
Im sorry if i come across as rude, and i really appreciate you the time to ask about all of this. For what its worth, we all know we are screwing the in game economy, but things arent as black and white as you apparently think they are sadly. You can believe me when i say that there is nothing more we would like that stop playing a game to survive.
---
bruh moment.. It is a bot and they only get kills on other bots. Plus as of today you need 150 total level to join.
---
I see... is there anything I should focus on on a new account to start getting some cash flow?

Having trouble getting my osrs app to launch (on iphone7) every time I open the app a black screen appears and after 10 seconds or so the app closes. I've tried deleting the app re downloading it turning the phone off/on etc any help would be greatly appreciated!!!

Which uses the same features as runelite... and it is clearly a reflection suicide bot.

 Bowstrings were only 73 gp in July.

Got a small question concerning strength training, should i use D Scim + D Defender for training or Sara Sword?, i don't have any money for other godsword and i will only be training through slayer.
---
I feel like youre a ironman that feels devalued but let me tell you. theres only personal value 
---
settled pumps thousands of hours into a shitty grind for a 20 sec clip you can tell he enjoys the game with his rules. find your way to enjoy the game and if you want to compete then compete with other ironmen that arent area restricted. unless youre doing the same thing as him theres no need to feel devalued :)
---
lol you dumb cunt did you ever leave your mothers womb
---
Hopefully not
---
I think Runelite has a default world setting but it isn’t on or set by default and I can’t say I’ve ever paid attention to whether or not it works reliably.
---
Every day we stray further from Saradomin's light
---
What I quoted isn't *the* definitive guideline for everything, just a response to this particular instance. I know you're trying to muddy the semantics of what I said. Buying an Infernal cape is very much RWT and is against the rules. That's payment (whether GP or IRL), for giving access to your account for a specific service in-game.
---
I know which tasks to do and which tasks not to but i would just like to see someone do what ur talking about :)
---
Can ironmen integrity please be looked into?
---
Using alts for slayer is still a thing, and can be easily mitigated by making 0s hit by someone else count. The argument that this would make it easier to rag is not a good reason to not do it -- if someone wants to do it they will get it done anyways. We also constantly have to deal with  dealing full damage whenever we kill bosses such as in the wildy just to find out we don't get the drop. The severity of integrity should not be looked over just because of something that we have to deal with regularly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Perhaps even more serious is corp alting. Ironmen are creating/sharing/paying for other iron alts to spec down corp for them making kills literally at least twice as fast. A simple solution is simply to change it so that instead of the cave being instanced for all ironmen as currently, it is instanced to every unique ironman.
---
Indeed, goblin boy
---
I have a work-around (sort of) for anyone still experiencing this issue.  
---
I have a MacBook so I used the inbuilt vpn in network settings to make a vpn connection for my network. I then changed my ip using the vpn and logged into the game by putting my authenticator code. Once I am logged into the game I then turn off my vpn while logged in. the game will automatically try to reconnect and stay logged in as long as you still have working internet.
---
Mate I got In my last slayer task a chaos talisman (1/8k) and fucking rune javelins (1/24k) and 5 heads in 130 ish kills. Never been so tilted.
---
literally anything
---
I don’t have fighter torso, void gear, fire cape  etc. Currently doing slayer to level my combat stats up, also done all of RFD except the quest points for the last part for barrows.
---
Should I continue levelling, obtain certain gear, if so which in which order? 
---
Money isn’t too much of an issue given bond price works out &gt;1m gp per £1?
---
Do your diary and do quests.. Good Way to set goals for yourself
---
U can get the same magic level as ur range level without effecting ur Cb, barring hp levels so you can just train magic hp less like thru alching or splashing
---
1000% Return on your investement. This guy is running the market.
---
Magic can be the same level as your ranged
---
Playing the game is a good option
---
Chose to limit tbh.
---
it was also necessary to progress the game, osrs is slowly creeping up to the point where eoc was implemented gear wise
---
So you can experience it fresh a second time?
---
Welcome to the club.

I only play rs3 but i like this

I suppose it’s cool because it’s so rare
---
Botting Cosplay Mobile Locked Ironman obviously.
---
its ok, just did raid 60 with nothing in my name and had to watch an ironman with 23% of the points get the ffa drop in a trio. makes sense.
---
just set yourself some goals. what do you want to get next ? do that!
---
Yeah force the mastercard warriors to learn the game atleast a little bit
---
No. The people who don't tarnish AHK downvotes you both. While AHK isn't cool to use in RS, it's great software. Also, that's clearly not AHK, because AHK wouldn't be able to detect the game state like that.
---
Can f2p players be given the ability to use bonds to change their name without being required to use it on membership?
---
Currently f2p players cannot change their name directly, only by redeeming membership then using the free name for being members
---
I'm not talking about swampletics, I just want you to spend time making an ironman, locking yourself within the GE and spending countless hours of your time progressing your iron man by buying stuff off the GE. I honestly think that's a great idea :P.
---
good settled make content: swampletics
---
I thought this was funny.
---
Some madman check the GE prices of Dark Hoods and see if there’s a blip
---
That's 60k per team
---
1) people could be watching the series for the first time or have shitty memory and like the intro.  it’s not even long.
---
2) people might not know how rare of a drop the rune cbow is.  it’s one thing to say “lol it’s rare” and nothing to truly show how rare it is.
---
3) it builds up excitement and anticipation.  will he get the rune cbow?  will it actually take him a year to get it?  dun dun dun...
---
Press on that home tele.
---
Fucking hell he actually is lmao
---
The community is unaware of this method tho. Few are doing it for how OP it actually is.
---
Also yeah with mahos it would still be profitable and 150 days or less
---
Doubtful. After Warding, they said they'd survey what the community wants with new skills. Those surveys likely won't be done until after RuneFest while the reveals would have been decided over the summer. So until they have a better grasp on how the community feels on skills right now and what skills they'd be interested in, they likely would plan a new skill for next year.
---
Niche build compared to entire playerbase. They designed the content and there was little upset from the pure community so they didn't alter it.
---
Even if there was backlash, they shouldn't really change it unless it was a completely strange requirement. Not all content is designed for niche accounts.
---
Ironmemes get a bit more love because they're officially supported, but they get way too much attention compared to pures, and it should be brought down a notch or 7.
---
Half the point of making IM/pures is the difference in playstyle, but then people make the accounts and whinge they don't get all content tailored to their lack of bank/ge/ability to use high level prayers etc.
---
I mean there's 3 possibilities after he realized that he needs a RCB to complete the Theater.
---
* 1) He stops the account.
---
* 2) He catches the imps by himself. On average it will take 1.5 years to get the CB, and even then, he isn't guaranteed to get one.
---
* 3) He finds a way to improve his impling catch rating.
---
Based on this list I find what he is doing very reasonable.
---
Hes caught over 300 lucky imps but only showed 100 or so in this ep. He could've still had it but left the clips as apart of next episode.
---
Bruh.
---
Why would someone say they are a furry when there not. The downvotes alone are bad enough.
---
Venanatis ftw
---
Legal Mage School, a new minigame added with Song of the Elves.  
---
  
---
Nah jk it's Last Man Standing, a kind of battle royale-ish pvp game mode I think. Idk I've not really played it.
---
He's taking the piss mate
---
He would get a second overhead
---
ok, i fixed the original title because i was thinking of something else. I'm sure this ones more relatable.
---
Well why not? There are finite crabs and bandits so it’ll force people to other training arenas such as experiments, rock crabs and then to ‘conventional’ methods. 
---
NMZ, in its current state, should not exist. It’s lazy in terms of adding items (I appreciate that there is a lot effort in taking rewards out of this) and training skills.
---
I don't trust a word you said
---
Tele home so he can't follow you.
---
Man up through the earlier levels slayer gets more fun at 60-70 and above especially with konar and you're getting 500k to 1m per task
---
I would quit. 100%
---
To start a new acc the next day cuz we all addicted to this pointless click simulator
---
I think this is actually a very popular opinion. Or maybe it’s just mine.

Pics or ugly too

That’s because you talked about a spoiler, that’s an auto-kick in his cc.

I'm sure I read somewhere it's only really worth paying protection for yews/magics/dragonfruit/crystal.

It's not legally binding, but undocumented changes are bad business.

Eoc was shit for about a year and a half. I have put a few years i to rs3 and this break might be the last. You know i spent 2 years finally finishing my ranged tank. Doing many quests and skills and dung that i didnt want to do. I was just starting to pk on it when eoc dropped. I invested 2 years of my spare time as a kid building something that i knew i could use for many years to come. And they fucking fucked me right in the fucking ass. I honestly dont know how i came back to the game after that. They even changed the cb lvl formula so my stats were fucking pointless.
---
You say yes pvp died. But do you remember how fucking big it was.
---
Come on broh what u say
---
I'm going to be starting a new RS3 account soon and see what's changed since about four years ago. While I love OSRS I feel like the bashing of RS3 here is likely pretty hyperbolic.
---
Wish me luck.
---
It only appears small because its big in game. Would you also suggest reducing the size of the throwing darts icon by 80% then? The box is a set size you clown.
---
I feel edgy is a good word for it.
---
I don't like skills that forces you to train with other people, imho that doesn't belong in RuneScape.
---
streisand effect
---
As others have said, set a goal. Not an unrealistic one yet, maybe try aim for dragon slayer 2 and everything needed for that.
---
Why would I make this up? As I said I have owned the cape since first week of release, I was the one who bought the first cloak that got in-game. I remember it being +6 prayer bonus (Just like it was PRE EOC) but I don't have any screenshots or video to prove it yet. However my other friend might have, I am just waiting on him to get online.
---
Thank you :)
---
Bandos or zammy maybe?
---
Bro it isnt about ur tone or truth. Its the braindead reddit slayertards having a circlejerk joke about something they dont even understand. Like anyone that has done lms know how dumb the comment you replied to was.
---
Can we have a right click 'Add Charges'  option to the Gaurdian Mummy in Pyramid Plunder. Going through the dialogue each time to recharge my Pharaoh's sceptre is a bit tedious.
---
Jagex needs to take out the free week of membs thing for mobile
---
You're barking up the wrong tree. Don't ask Jagex for help with an issue like this.
---
Recover the email used on the account. It's a lot simpler than what you're trying to do. Most email recovery tickets (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc..) are straightforward and simple to use. I was in the same situation as you a while back. Submit a ticket and you will get a reply within 3-4 days. Most companies have reliable customer support unlike Jagex.
---
Bro, I really don't  think that's very average. I think you need to consider talking to someone, because that's NOT an appropriate amount of time to put into an action solely for a karmawhoring reddit post.
---
I don't really mind it, it actually adds an interesting layer to most things.
---
You're no longer PKing against another guy who doesn't care about risking 10 cents like yourself, there's actual stakes on the line for them which makes it pretty cool. You could potentially smite a week's worth of meals from them.
---
Annnnd shopping trolley wheels!
---
Yes
---
I saw Swampletics at a general store in Morytania yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
---
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen lucky impling jars in his hands without paying.
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
---
When she took one of the jars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each jar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

i think you'd be surprised how many noobs there are who have never gotten a fire cape like me. I'll be very excited when I finally do, I've been playing for half a year and just got 1250 total! I don't even know how the fire cape works, just that it's a big deal
---
I'd slap his ass with my dual rune crossbows and since he doesnt have antifire potions nor the shields he gets 1 shot from the spec
---
more surreal memes please
---
PvP? Grams lives in Syria?

Huge if true
---
10mxp is way way way too high. i'm just over 1250 lvl with 7.6 mill xp been playing for 7 months
---
Swamp man good
---
A mil goes regularly for $0.60 even when buying in the smallest amounts.
---
Buying gold is less than half the price for members than buying standard members from Jagex.
---
Iirc it was similar to dhcb
---
address the grotesque guardians, please.
---
potential to be one of the best bosses, but dog poop rewards along with transition phases that are long as heck ruin it :(
---
Bandos is a good entry into higher tier pvm, if you get in a clan and say you’ll tank you will get a 3 man all day.  You will need 85+ in melee stats unless u get lucky and someone will take u
---
How do you figure? You know that bots were around before 3rd party clients were allowed, right?
---
Ye it does lol. U get more shards unless u mean reg compost and ultra compost have the same effect but doubt
---
Delete it
---
So bot mining, so you can bot lms got it
---
Wtf is your account
---
Sad, but very true.
---
Earned it on rooftops?
---
You literally presneted a non-argument. You claim not to debate economic theory, alright then, let's disregard your whole first argument (because you're foolishly debating exactly that).
---
At this point your argument is "Runescape is not a money making platform" and no shit, but that doesn't mean you can't make money playing Runescape even if it's against ToS. You reinforce this notion with a lofty "I don't particularly care why", in which case I can respond to your whole post the same way.
---
The only reason gauntlet was add was so they could say “look content” when it was pretty much shit.
---
Nah binomial distribution compute the probability that there's n successes, not the probability of success after some number of failures. I think you mean negative binomial distribution, or more specifically,ba geometric distribution.
---
I recommend elven guards in priffdinas (wandering around the gates of priffdinas). I like the task cause its pretty fast, doesnt need too many resource (1 inv of manta is way more than you need) and you can have a chance for eternal teleport crystal, which is pretty nice gp (but its a very rare drop)
---
I've seen it happen with loads of npcs and they always take the shortest path to their spawn, looks intentionally to me.
---
That's higher RC than most of us
---
You. An achieve all that in a day bud
---
This is right.
---
Nomad was easy imo, any pleb could beat him with ruby bolts
---
getting fighter torso is a pain in the ass if you dont pay for it. got a master step (6th step) where i need one and i dropped it a few days later cause all the time my team was logged out midgame... good luck with your plans!

Low alch yourself

I'll give you one more chance to dig your grave deeper before I block you so I don't have to read your impotent screeching any longer.

Go back and watch his old original UIM progress vids.
---
First of all stop doing magic trees lol
---
There's no point to doing normal trees unless you're going for pet or rushing a level for a quest/diary or something and really want it asap.  
---
Fruit trees and calquats give a lot of xp for a single daily run, and are way cheaper than maples/yews/magics.
---
Herb runs are decent money if you don't have access to late game pvm or want a relatively chill way to get decent gp/hr. Since you can afford magic seeds I'm guessing you can do Zulrah/vork/something which means herb runs will technically be lower gp/hr than those.
---
I personally still do herb runs because there's no risk of dying and I don't have to pay much attention at all. Definitely don't do as many as I used to tho
---
Hmm I expected Zanik
---
1k total or like 75 qps should be implemented for lms

Lmao the first part is a joke but second part is the truth.

One time I shoved saradomins light up my ass and the whole room got brighter all of a sudden

You just use it on the iron directly.

Are those stats in the order atk/def/range? I am not super familiar with pking builds so I can't really tell lol
---
That said I have seen range tanks that stay low atk, like 50 or 60 (though 50 may not be as viable after the gmaul nerf)
---
imagine actually playing with sounds on lmao
---
Dungeoneering as a minigame:  
---
  - XP tomes akin to Temple Trekking  
---
  - Tokens for dng-only upgrades akin to Barb Assault  
---
  - Rotating leaderboards of top 10 fastest larges (weekly by specified theme, monthly and 6-month simply fastest all-rooms large)  
---
  - Require 60% instead of 100% of floors complete to reset progress: still promotes teaming with variety of people, but doesn't require a bunch of C1s. Rewards are approx. halved if ignored
---
  - Leaderboard for number of tokens earned, up to a cap of 100m (1b worth of rs2 xp). This will appear in highscores with other minigames / clues.   
---
  - Players should be able to race each other by having the same floor layout appear for both parties. Monster spawns will be random, but identical boss and rooms.  
---
  - Keyshare can be turned off for a bonus 1.2x multiplier of rewards at the end.  
---
  - Maxed stats will benefit for bonus rooms, but crit path should be doable by more than just the highest stats player   
---
  - Flowers, barrels, and monolith should be completable faster by a skilled player  
---
  - Guardian door rooms should have 4 or fewer enemies spawn   
---
  - Immediately openable doors (skill/enter) should usually have 4+ enemies spawn, to encourage players to not kill things in these rooms  
---
  - One path from base should always start as guardian doors and mostly peaceful rooms, for skillers to enjoy.
---
Additional tip, if you do barbarian fishing you're already working towards the strength and agility grinds.

Bring a bar of metal and the corresponding logs, craft a spear first, talk to Otto and use the spear on the anvil again to make a hasta.
---
I'm aware they are intended but still they are not the effects used to justify the decision.
---
Can confirm, im the ceo of the company that owns jagjex
---
the people botting motherlode mine doesn't take away from my experience (yes i know it affects the economy but my actually gameplay is exactly the same). Cheaters in PK'ing not only take my shit if they beat me its just frustrating to play against.  And you can few bad eggs but its near constant complaint by pk'ers here.
---
Noob question: What's wrong with metal drags?
---
If your new with a dhcb can you still BGS him to make kill easier.
---
You only need to get 1 level to make yourself exponentially more likely to get that +4 boost instead of +5, but you're still right; 1 level would take several hours.
---
Jagex bad Swampman good
---
84 con is so fucking useful I can't imagine my life before it
---
This guy has no idea what he’s talking about lol
---
Except he's right
---
Not. Yet.
---
Nobody is saying “they don’t care about bots”. That’s a strawman lol. People are saying the bot detection isn’t good enough. They care about bots they just don’t do a *great* job at removing them, especially the more niche botted activities.
---
oH YeAh, tHat wAs RigHt afTeR jAgEx dropped that Nuke on Ireland, you were there have u been blind?! im not sure why you still play and support a bunch of liars, go find a different game where the devs treat the community better than they do than OSRS, in fact, just name a game in which the devs give more freedom and choice to the community.
---
I believe that's his point. You need a balance that prevent bots to an extent but doesn't punish the casual player. I mean I've got up to 1700-2000 totals on three accounts now but I ain't gunna tell people that play a few hours a week and arnt fucking mining at their career they shouldn't have access to lms
---
You choose to limit yourself. That’s what us Pvpers have always been told when it comes to other parts of the game.
---
It is an inside joke in the subreddit to do that.
---
Except there's video and picture evidence
---
Q - With there be additional new ores and bars added over on Oldschool Runescape. Does the the team have any future plans on revamping both skills Mining and Smithing? 
---
These two skills come to mind whenever it comes to being outdated with rune being the highest tier. Not only would it be a nice update to the game, could also be a awesome update towards the F2P community.
---
Bots at mother load mine doesn’t cause you to lose money. One bad apple spoils the bunch
---
is this true for all fruit trees? i was curious about protecting dragonfruits as well because coconuts are kind of expensive
---
It's kind of a meme to blur out some useless stuff, like number of runes and such.
---
Here are a few thoughts for how to make it more balanced from the top of my head:
---
* Don't make it a skill
---
* Remove the resource dungeons that might be too OP for OSRS (frost dragons) and since there is no longer a skill level requirement to access it as it is not a skill, make access to each dungeon purchasable with tokens
---
* Don't include chaotics as they devalue a lot of already existing gear
---
* Include rewards like the herbicide that are untradeable
---
* Include new rewards like a mage and range version of chivalry (worse than Rigour/Augury) that are tradeable
---
I meant your runecrafting lvl lmao
---
Meant more as a joke cause rc is horrible to train.
---
 Ofc it's insanely lucky!
---
Our top story tonight: Truck driver causes 72 car accident on motorway says "1m xp a week tho brah"

So basically you took that person's entire bank

Are you still looking for someone?
---
Thanks for the reply. I just started and can only get 1 kill per trip so wanted to see if that’s normal
---
Nature staff is already in game with name Bryophyta's staff
---
30m on each combat skill and 70M range xp basically, PvM'ing a lot and efficiently. Until last chrismash I didn't buy bonds with gp (&gt;2.5B bank)
---
Since this year on 3 accs, early last year I started my first Alt account, so since then my afk money makers doubled in profit/H and gwd turned profitable with dolos.
---
Between all accs kc (aprox):
---
7k gorillas x50= 350M
---
1k zulrah = 100M
---
3k vorkath = 300M
---
3,5k bandos = 600M
---
9k zammy = 1500M
---
1,5k sara = 225M
---
2k venenatis = 160M
---
total is 3,23B
---
I've also made money from investments on special ocassions, like buying up 3,3Mbow strings... since 69gp to 44gp ATL, waiting till they went back to &gt;100gp ea, so basically 2x'ed 250M right there, and other similar long-investments ie d bolts at 1200 ea or superior at 10,8k... Invested 1B on these two, both paid a lot
---
And now I'm invested in weapon seeds since 30k ea, my average buy prob is around 55k and they're 85k ea, so i've made around 250M again, still not selling cuz I expect another 500m profit in few months
---
Other flips too
---
Its because they are faster to make or more afk. At 77 you unlock staminas which is the most afk way to train herblore
---
I enjoy how you put everyone under the same boat of being dexterous enough to pray flick and concentrate on the 40-50 mins of waves beforehand plus Jad at the end, my dad (who is nearly 60 and has been playing rs since 2006 alongside me) only recently got his firecape after many attempts, it’s not a brainless task if you’ve never gotten it before and the stress contributes to that, it even took me a few attempts for my first one but now I do every jad task I get without issue.
---
I have 60m if extra cash but I don’t want to be broke after buying it
---
r/Gatekeeping
---
He should alch the snelm and main Spectacles now... spectacle season &lt;333
---
Is it now just say 27/1.4 million with 27 being amount of essence per inventory,
---
Alright. I think I'll stop doing normal trees, and keep doing papayas and calquats, along with hardwoods. Then incorporate herbs into my play. I am currently in school so I do a lot of skilling, and tend to play more afk so herbs would be good for me I think
---
Yes at peak efficiency assuming the fastest skills only that would be 30 minutes a day. A casual player isn't doing that though. They wouldn't have the gp, the knowledge, or the inclination to do max efficiency.
---
That's an interesting oddity. Hard to say I give a remote shit that they randomly removed Prayer bonus from a 650m cosmetic item though. There are less cringy things to worry about in this game.
---
Go broke, sell your bank and buy Rigour. It’s so good that you’ll make it back in no time.
---
Kalphite King confirmed
---
It’s been months since I’ve seen a lasagna reference
---
The Private server stole the files of the OSRS items, and when they do this everything is copied straight from the game (including stats) - That's why this is a valid proof of the cape being +6 prayer on release date.
---
Died to zulrah about 10 times. Got him twice though!
---
dude not everyone who has more exp than you is some neet virgin. you are just extremely inefficient or you play like 5 minutes a day.

I was expecting the crossbow this episode, but I guess that would be too lucky. I don’t ever think I have ever seen a lucky impling before . I have seen a dragon one though.
---
I don’t know why you guys are getting downvoted when you’re 100% true. I want to see skills like Mining and Smithing get a revamp like they respectfully deserve, or something interesting come out of Thieving.
---
Me too! Got my first Zulrah kill yesterday, i barely got out of there alive. All the videos make it look so easy
---
Great! I'll message you once I've started my account, likely this weekend.
---
Esports ready
---
Yup. Jagex takes its problem super seriously, that’s why I couldn’t right now hop through every world at well known boy locations and run into bots
---
Yes! I'm in world 439
---
Do you really think Swampletics is the first ever restricted account on an MMO?
---
Throwback to MMKs fake graph about how we need bonds for f2p work
---
Rs3 blogs about how they would slow down mtx lmao. 
---
Osrs blog about how they would improve support and account security came out like 6 months ago, still nothing.
---
Not saying they are lying here cuz there is no reason to but tbh Jagex lies all the time. It’s easy because so many people blindly trust them.
---
Driest streak I’ve seen so far. Gl homie
---
Never thought about this, LMS has no requirements so suicide bots are going to be plenty.
---
If he has that melee set up it's honestly be worth the investment in a DHL and cheap gear especially if  he plans to kill it long term for pet  or do melee vorkath.
---
DHL, proselyte,  and the best accessories he can afford/want to risk in the wildy after that would be the best (reasonable) set up
---
Finally, protip for farming KBD, suicide an inventory of supplies in his lair before to make trips last much longer. People can crash your world but if you have dhl you can out dps them unless they have dhcb
---
I have 4 in 40 kc not an iron so it’s pretty worthless rng

Gargoyles are good gp for a mid level account

yep he's actually also the first person to play an MMO

Clearly a bot

Tbh I spent about 3.5 hours there or something like that in total, still no d defender tho haha

I keep all my vorkath supplies in its own tab

Just got a new basic PC to play runescape on, I'm wondering if there's any quality virus protection (or other things I should look it) that's available for free or for relatively cheap.
---
I know most of the big name stuff I might be familiar with is pretty ass: Norton, Mcafee, etc.
---
I believe I've used Kaspersky on a different pc for a while and always had good results, but I can't remember if it's free or affordable.  
---
Any other suggestions or things I should look at?  Thanks!
---
Just buy gp on an alt. Buying bonds is literally paying 3x the price of gp to buy it from Jagex.
---
1m is about $0.60 right now. From Jagex its $1.55 through bonds.
---
"OMG but you'll get banned for buying gp!" -No, you will not. Jagex only bans people who sell mass amounts (10+ bils)
---
Molch pearls say hello
---
idk man, that just sounds like a hella stuck-up, entitled statement. Yes, they have fucked up before, who hasn't? but to compare the 0.5% of fuck-ups to the 99.5% of honest, community driven, hard work on up-dates and QoL and weekly Q and A's that they do not even have to do, and say "well you messed up once before so im never going to trust anything you say ever again" is just, well, douchey. Sorry.
---
Thats fine barrows is easy
---
Geez my point is that the stats came with the models, they didn't manually add them to every single item.
---
I definitely don't. HD is gross.
---
this is why i quit playing this game because shit like that goes unpunished.
---
The right hand is invisible and in tge market
---
I was out of the country for a funeral for like a week, so thats probably why they had so much time.
---
The more I'm looking into it, it seems an old password of mine was hacked and leaked, and maybe they used that to get into the account. I don't see any emails for pin reset, but they could of gotten the pin some other way. Kind of making sense now and sucks to lose so much work. But ultimately I should have done more to prevent it. Time to spam zammy wines to try buliding a bank again. Thanks for your help.
---
It’s definitely expensive to use, but the way I see it is that if you can afford to buy one, you should be able to afford the charges. I use it basically everywhere it has good use lol

Nah, seems like it was something I could of prevented.
---
Well, pures can definitely get 75 qp but most won't, I'd say 30-40 qp is a good number, however you'd be surprised how fast that is to bot, I think just a 750-1k total req would be ideal. Or combined, like 30qp+500 total seems good as well
---
Will OSRS see a new prayer tab similarly to RS3's Ancient Curses? It may be worked uniquely to RuneScape such as a prayer tab that only properly works on unarmed players (Martial arts) or just a mechanic to how prayer may be used.
---
To expand on Martial arts, attacking an opponent would drain stats/run energy/spec bar when the prayer is active and the hit hits the opponent. Or if active, could stun the opponent or prevent attacks from being made. It sounds very OP, but the player must be unarmed to use the unique prayer style.
---
&gt;Dungeoneering as a minigame
---
This is the only way it could ever pass a poll. 2019 is EfficiencyScape, and Dungeoneering as a skill would fail miserably since the solo XP rates are worse than team.
---
Odds are that he has it, he has opened something like 300 inplings and its 1/162

BP is probably better dps on the melee phase than that bgs, just saying.
---
50+ CoX raids dry of even a split. Mostly 3 man raids, but some 4-6 with alts etc.
---
When are you planning sell it again?
---
&gt;once
---
This entire game exists only because of several fuck-ups that led to it. And free tbow day is faaaaaaarrrrr from the osrs teams only mistake. 
---
They are a great team of hardworking people but Jagex itself is a terrible company and probably doesn’t allow them the resources or time to do things properly.
---
Does anyone have a video of a jmod wearing the set and showing the stats? I looked back at the Twitch preview but they never showed the stats. I am 100% sure the cape was +6 I just need a video or image proof x)
---
If a new skill has even the slightest bit to do with combat, I'd prefer Summoning.
---
I got one of these at chins, although it was only 10m cash. This is precisely why we kill everybody though. Never know.
---
Just sold it.
---
I don't think you will find many of these on members' worlds. Even if you did they are easy to kill, if anything it makes the cape easier to get.
---
You can buy bonds without breaking the rules.  If you want to get in to purchasing services or accounts then you can make pretty much any argument which is pointless and annoying which is why nobody except you is discussing it. 
---
Please look no further than your own words for "dumb as shit" logic.
---
Your magic level has increased to 99.
---
You can now can Self Alchemy.
---
Not if you didnt find it first
---
That is already done for voting, because there are scripts to let bots vote for something
---
I don’t mind using it and losing money while grinding thermy pet, but I’m also trying to make money with it and find it hard in a lot of places with a 1.2m/hr cost
---
When are you planning to recover it again?
---
Gz. Alch yourself
---
Oh didn't even think of that. Jagex pl0x do sth
---
Rune drags and zammy
---
Please we all know how many times Jagex was wrong.
---
In that regard, could we get a prayer bonus to actually go on imbued God capes? It's kind of ironic that the default has one but the imbued version does not.
---
PKers aren't known for their intelligence.
---
This is expensive and unnecessary. Depends will do the trick for a fraction of the cost.
---
&gt;Who is more the victim, people whose osrs experience is slightly affected by desperate people or the desperate people?
---
I've already explained to you why the victim's on the opposite side of the venezuelans aren't the osrs players, it seems like you didn't read my comment at all.
---
Except he's explaining that they don't. The stats (and other server-side item data) for most private servers are created by dumping information from the wiki.

Runescape is my favorite game to not because the bit detection system is so damn well made. It really allows me to work hard at exploiting and perfecting my crafts.

---
Hosidius house on zeah, the Xerics Glade teleport on Xerics amulet takes you right there
---
You'll be sorely disappointed to know that it requires proof of intent. In a game where making money is pretty much the only goal you can't go about banning people for making money lmao
---
Only 1b if it contains RCB :)
---
its not that good of gp/hr. scales are down and unless you're getting uniques way under drop rate, its still under 2m/hr. Some sort of content lock would be the way to solve that other than the bots actually being banned. 
---
Vorkath is double the money and probably easier ( in my opinion ).
---
Efficient cox is more, and efficient tob is disgustingly more.
---
even running astral and lava runes is more than zulrah at this point.
---
It's not whether its good gp/hr or not, it's that you don't need to make something that requires charges and let it become overtaken by something basically free. Thats how you create a useless item. Blowpipe is still the most op range weapon and the toxic trident is still used in a lot of places so scale prices are not going to change much if at all. This is not going to hurt the profit per hour at zulrah.
---
Osrs does not take much to run so don't think you need to go all out something like. 1050 ti is a good enough gpu
---
Woah so your OSRS pass gets blocked on Reddit see ******* try it out
---
Last man standing is one of the best things jagex ever did but those bots screw up the game.
---
If you are lucky you can catch a bot that does nothing at all. Kill him and get points.
---
But some bots have those insane prayer switches lol.
---
if you can ignore the mtx there is a good game there.

The range attacks are the limiting factor me as well I'm at 94 range, and can fairly regularly get 3 kills a trip but sometimes its just 1 kill, I actually wrote up a little guide to help out my cc but here check it out might help you with some of the concepts of woox walking https://imgur.com/a/5pSEb7k

So are you against ironmen doing raids with other people then?
---
Stop spreading lies ass hole
---
just let them release eoc bro.
---
Your problem is clicking as fast as possible. You have to wait for the animation to finish, the target on the ground before clicking pickpocket. I find it easier on a high ping world.
---
My "I dont particularly care why," is in terms of them breaking the rules. If they want to make money, thats fine, I don't particularly care. But the way they do it cripples the economy and largely uses bots and stolen accounts. Also, in another thread on this post, a Venezuelan worker responded to a question of "If OSRS closes down what would you do?" With flippant oh we'll just move on to the next thing. They don't care about the game at all. If OSRS goes down, you'll see them on Fortnite with aimbots next or some shit (I don't play Fortnite, just an easy target for 'popular game')
---
And ill happily quit again. I quit after eoc, i have a 1750+total lvl ironman. Rangers dfs etc and would still quit if they mess the game up(imo) this is just a game, there are thoussnds of others. 
---
All my oppinion of course, youre entitled to yours. 
---
I loove the community-developer relationship osrs has. Literally cannot think of another game where players have so much power.
---
BUT i dont think every little thing should be polled.
---
The prayer switches and specs are hard to hit. If I fight someone halfway competent I often can't get the kill :/
---
When someone says to drop your shit why the hell would
---
You do it
---
The uim, iron whatever makes sense if it's an alt and you're using the same name otherwise (ie. Username/Iron Username).
---
And his point is that your point is completely and utterly wrong.
---
Neither you can dig with. Dead content.
---
why so hostile, damn dude
---
You are clicking too fast after the initial knockout. Try waiting a half second or so after the knockout and click pickpocket. Then after that first one, pickpocket again after another half second. 
---
Pickpocketing has a delay when you begin that action so if you spam click that action you'll only get a delay.
---
RC is actually my favourite skill... i do it post 99 when i get bored:/
---
He shidded and farded and camed his pants in high definition.
---
Where?
---
Then ill stop playing. So will 90% of community. Then devs are out of jobs. Again no one wants that.
---
New stuff can't be better in every way or the community screeches "reeee my achievements are devalued"
---
A lot of OSRS Redditors actually believe this trash.
---
Okay but that’s like, your opinion man.
---
They are intended as "flex items" but a few of them have uses, not every 3rd age piece needs to be useful, especially given how unfathomably rare getting a specific 3rd age item is.

Right click veng on the spell book, then use your F Keys to go back to your inventory. Keep your Ags or spec weapon at the bottom and when you see your opponent pull out their spec weapon, click veng, equip your spec weapon and let it rip.

Can the Trouver parchment be used on your untrimmed skillcape to prevent it from becoming trimmed upon achieving more 99s? 
---
Just want to point out that this is possible to do today by using a telegrab glitch that has been in the game for 10+ years. This can easily result in you losing your untrimmed skillcape by accident or DCing for example. Please give the Trouver parchment this ability so we can finally have a legitimate and reliable way to keep untrimmed skillcapes from our first 99.
---
the wiki also states "It is tied with the Ardougne cloak 4 for the highest Prayer bonus of any cape slot item, at +6."
---
I don't see how people could own one and not realise. It's been in the game for 5 months now, Gambit said the stats were correct on the wiki and there's a few people in this thread that own one and they swear it was +6. I'm inclined to believe that it has been changed by accident by someone.
---
RC is one of the most capturing, fruitful and entertainment skills in the game. Legit.

I accidentally emptied my 2 dose brew at the inferno when I was trying to decant it with another 2 dose the other day. I could have really used those two doses. I propose they add a warning when emptying out specific potions, and have the warning be toggled on or off for people who don’t really care.
---
I believe they can do casual only but not sure 100%
---
It costs only $11 a month to get hacked🦀

Great to see these old bosses again. Grinding DG all day during summers back in 2011/2012 was heaven.
---
rough math is between 1/9k and 1/10k to get 5 crystals and pet in 176 kc
---
- No puzzle rooms  
---
- No teamwork  
---
- No variety  
---
- No teleports  
---
- Final destination
---
Having very little to gain past 70 hunter is an ok excuse.
---
Yeah! Then they can make old school runescape classic in 10 years after they realized they can't undo their fuck ups.
---
Might want to hide your battery life bro.
---
One of the better looking capes, nice
---
As someone who has not played the game in like 15 years, I have no idea what I am looking at
---
Jagex said alts didn't affect the warding poll. Neither did the 8k max players against the 130k friggin voted. Stop whining that the community doesn't want the game to become rs3
---
Besides, you're always missing how expensive or time consuming it is to vote with alts. It would take a ton of play time to keep up with the bond cost with a bunch of accounts to make any impact, or it would cost you lots of real dollars. If someone does either of those, they absolutely deserve more than one vote, but Jagex said alts barely affected the votes in the first place so its irrelevant. Still I would happily spend $100 to vote no on dungeoneering
---
Ironman accounts tho
---
Until falo the bard asks for one for a master clue and you have to waddle off sadly to figure out BA as 100+ cmb...
---
So this explains why someone killed me while rcing with a max combat  acc earlier today.
---
What do you do when they equip the second serp with the other mutagen?
---
I’m almost 98 and have spent way less time getting 98 rc than I did 85 slayer. Just saying
---
Finishing the elite desert diary is more impressive and difficult than reaching 86 agil, any day
---
Obviously that's how it works right now, otherwise I wouldn't have made this post addressing it would I? I'm talking about the spirit of the gamemode, the way you talk about it it's like "ooh let's add a random restriction now I'll try to make it as much like normal rs as I can with all the unintended features the Devs didn't have time to look over"
---
The spirit of the gamemode is to rely on what you can carry, not with some bs double inventory that only works if you die, not with a bs boss bank that only works if you die. Know what, I guess HCUIM is the answer I needed.
---
Simply said: if we blanket ban these people they will likely starve and/or migrate as economic refugees. And you care more about your stupid ass game than these people's lives. But you dare not admit it and wrap it in emotional arguments about "how much time and effort was put in getting the game back wah wah", in order to justify your blatant inhumanity and entitlement to your luxurious life. It's not a strawman, get your fallacies straight.
---
Why didn't you went to another world get on that tile hop back to the world you dropped your stuff, pick it up, profit.
---
Wastes inventory space, and is unnecessary overall.
---
also, we would get like, no content if he had to manually scout the imps himself. I find it to be acceptable

"Over droprate" is a largely meaningless thing that the OSRS community spends too much time obsessing over. A decent rule of thumb is that if you've killed the drop rate amount of something, you're 65% likely to have it. You still won't 35% of the time which is a shit ton.
---
I wouldn’t even be sorry, if he bought his gp and doesn’t have the knowledge on how to use it he doesn’t deserve to keep it. Part of the game is making your own money and learning to play the game along the way.
---
Too much money not enough sense.
---
Devalue? I'm just saying seems kinda silly to only provide unlimited teleports to Konar when you'll likely be 30-40 combat levels above her requirement.
---
Comparing it to Duradel's gloves tele, at least his requirements make sense since he's a high requirement master to begin with.
---
What a shit song to go with this video.

FR the cow patch (as I call it) is where all hard working noobs prosper. I also got $200k randomly and a ton of rune stuff??? I think players go there to help the non-beggars.
---
Lucky impling op
---
Faced the same bot last night multiple times. We figured out that you could just take out your staff and then 1t whip. Surprisingly it didn't have the ID for elder maul so it just prayed mage while I was bashing it with the maul
---
its not unnecessary if you don't have the agility level lmao
---
Because adding 140m to your bank would make his gameplay better
---
Just bathe in the juices of Sir Swampman in front of her to show your love of him.

You forgot to censor the rest of the image.

OSRS hardly uses any data. You probably will only get through 1/2 gb in 5 hrs.
---
No, and I wouldn't waste my life searching for it!
---
ignore the people not giving you advice
---
telegrabbing wines is 200k/h
---
or you can make a f2p pker and stomp fools for 150k/h
---
money makers are way better in p2p, but you can easily make a bond in f2p
---
Some would consider this as an "idiot tax".

Misguiding graph tbh. Its like sayin rcb better than msb i
---
The way I see it, mining is done 2 ways, the fast actively engaged way, Power mining and tick manipulation granite, or afk mlm. I really enjoy running mlm while doing other things. But I understand the inability to grind it out fast can be annoying to people. I guess golden nuggets are indicative of the mining skill.
---
If I cut teaks in priff, it seems to give enough shards to maintain the axe for quite a while in my experience
---
Ok go ewst
---
To be fair, the original post is about creating the most particle-infested abomination possible.
---
But there is something to be said about the fact that this is even possible in RS3.
---
Not if you pre-pot summer pie
---
It's already Runefest again? wow
---
No, clue hunters who bring more than necessary are super small brain unless they're trying to anti pk
---
Seems legit
---
Stfu I pk a lot and never saw this happening. It does happen OBV, but very very rarily.
---
It has less to do with being colorblind and more to do with basic respect.
---
Really? Why? Over and over I've read that Dharok's is superior once you reach 85-ish hp. 
---
How much better off are we talking? What sort of xp rates would obsidian get me?
---
I mean I play both games I have like a 2200 on rs3 and like a 950 osrs. EOC just changes they ways mobs are fought. You can even use the osrs combat system in rs3. EOC just adds a level of complexity that is extremely hard to achieve in osrs, it's not better or worse it's just a different take on the game.
---
Almost as bad as putting "great"  in your name
---
2m rc xp in a day
---
Correction, EoC is *no longer* that bad. It functions just fine gameplay-wise and they’re rebalancing weapons now too so that scimmys are different from Longswords/maces/daggers etc basically giving each weapon type it’s own niche. Which I think is a great move. 
---
I will fully admit that on start, EoC completely changed the game with no real recourse for people who didn’t want it changed
---
That has since changed though and legacy mode is pretty decent.
---
You have to use the max cape on vorkath himself
---
Alch-my-self
---
Just the cape u add it too pretty sure
---
Literally a regular occurrence in osrs or the first 5 seconds ur in zezima cc.
---
After Warding didnt pass, I went to RS3. Honestly, I love both so much, but I needed more from OSRS.
---
No thanks. It's just lolsorandum humor for zoomers
---
Better kill everyone, you never know who might be a low quality bot that can't bank things properly
---
Because he wasn’t logged on
---
Why are you so hellbent on regulating language?
---
I’m so sure that POC don’t resort to racial slurs. Must only be a huwhite thing, isn’t it?
---
15 pages at 6kc? Nice
---
I mean, it might be. But you got the point, even though it's easier to kill ants, you'll never kill them all because they're always being instantly replaced. 
---
While a rat might be harder to kill but once you kill a few of them, it might take a while until they appear again.
---
Nope, it would if it said Catacombs.
---
Then don’t say they would be playing 30 minutes per day if you know that wouldn’t be true?
---
No casual is getting 80k xp per hour, therefore it will be more than half an hour per day as you state to gain that xp.
---
You know nothing about me.

Not really gunna mean much once serp is no longer B I S

Well I'm not really informed on the history of the staff but you do make a good point. Still a man can dream :)

Bp with dragon darts is about 1.9M/h to use which is more than the scythe

Lol why u respond to every comment with same general statement. We get your view. Hard to be in someone else's shoe, so your view is not very substantial.

Damn,

Thanks for the response

Yeah I get so much respect as a minority in my majority POC community.

So, so, so much respect.

The one time i decide to train runecrafting in 2k total worlds someine attacks me. Thank god he didnt tb me lol. Woulda lost my purple graceful

We’ve just recently gotten into raiding. We do have guys, including myself, with KC at COX. But we’re just reaching a point where we have enough members to actually raid.

Great argument. I’ll take a gander at what side of the aisle you’re coming from.
---
It’s a different cape then regular max cape with different effects to people would need regular max cape also
---
This guy is one of those in zezima cc thinking that it is cool to be edgy by using racial slurs
---
Rs3 armour designs are horrendous
---
Hi again Acorn, can this please be investigated properly? Look back how the stats were on release date if that is possible. I sadly don't have any proof yet to fully prove it, but I have owned the cape since first week of release and I remember the stats. It had +6 prayer. I have asked other people who have owned the cape and they all agree with me. I am not sure how, or when it got changed to +3 but I am assuming it happened recently, perhaps when 3rd age druidic got added to the Beta Worlds? last month?
---
Just put 2 factor authentication on your email
---
&gt; Yeah but there is a formula that predicts the chances of getting something after a certain number of casket openings. Maybe that’s what he meant.
---
How is that binomial distribution? If it's a binomial distribution it would be worded such as: "The probability of r successful rare drops after N number of casket openings." But it's worded such that you want to find the probability of at least one success after r failures. They're not the same thing.
---
Like OP said, there are already to fairly close teleports there (fairy ring and farming guild) fairly easily.  If he wants to save himself the short climb, then he can do the already in game method of unlocking the direct teleport.
---
And Konar assigns hydra, so she is used by fairly high level accounts as well.
---
It depends on how many specs land, scythe is better on close to full def
---
Both big, “game breaking” bots and small, “minor inconvenience” bots would be addressed by the same solution: an upgraded bot detection system/expanded anti-cheating team. 
---
While we’re on it, there should also be a dedicated anti-RWT team as most of the previously botted areas like Zulrah and Green Drags are occupied by gold farmers. Flag the accounts, once money is transferred, ban the account and remove the gold from where it was transferred.
---
When are you fixing the frame issues at Demonic Gorillas?
---
Funny thing is I had just finished the tutorial, immediately went and mined/smithed enough bronze stuff and sold it to stores to afford the full iron set in the pic (it was satisfying).  I was on my first cow after getting there when he walked up to me.  Back to the GE I went to buy everything needed from 1-60 attack lol.  Definitely a nice morale boost to be handed something, sense I had years of play time across multiple accounts, but had to start from scratch since it it was remade.
---
Im sorry mate. Pet at lvl 68-71-75 at ZMI. Dont hurt me.

You're right. For some reason I just assumed he was doing 2tick.

That used to be the shit right along with putting your clan name in your display name back in the day.

Thanks for the RS3 spam.

I honestly just use void mage/void melee. Melee spec weapon/whip for ahrim and mage everyone else. Salve ammy for the tunnels to kill skeletons for kc.

Is there any plans to add more training methods to construction? At the moment users are limited to purely a cycle of build, destroy, build, destroy. Construction feels in desperate need of some mini game, co-skilling, etc. to break up the monotony.

This is part of why tbow is so sick. It costs like 80k/hour with dragon arrows lol
---
Did this on a prayer pot and immediately thought "I guess I don't need my 5k anymore"
---
clearly there are good ways to make a quick buck in this game lmao
---
you can use vorkath head on normal max cape / range cape to make the avas perk effect act like an assembler rather an accumulator. it still doesnt have the stats of either though, just the normal stats
---
I think the cc is called "osrs soa", if you wanna manually join it !
---
Well, time to make a character named "Uimiron Fehcim"
---
Holy shit why are you being so salty about it? Just don't watch it if you don't like it.
---
Don't even need that. Just a thing that checks for similarities between and times you out for talking too much.
---
I had lost my original too and ended up emailing Jagex a lot, and providing with as much information as I could, (didn’t have original email either) and for whatever reason one day it was unlocked. I have no idea how it works lmao.
---
Hope he gets a chat ban for at least a month. Not acceptable especially for streamers.
---
Yes, that part of the graph is from the era before Jagex realized that "bigger level give bigger number" isn't a good way to balance XP gains. Not on its own, anyway.
---
Your job is beyond a joke if you can actually get away with something as not afk as mining at work.

Well someone didnt graduate high school

Yep. Glory from 30 has been a thing since at least like 2005, I presume always

You use her most when you’re going for hydra tasks late game anyways. She’s a bad slayer master for med lvls
---
Damn nice.
---
Barb assault and raids are really the only good answers. You can try pest control but the game will split you up randomly. Castlewars if you're feeling it but waste of time basically. 
---
I guess zolcano and wintertodt technically, idk if zolcano is worth on ironmeme or nah.
---
Didnt this same thing happen to Framed? He pked back to back eternals from the exact same person. Made absolutely 0 sense.
---
his only Spec option is the Magic shortbow, and even then, that'll conflict with his rune crossbow, cause he'll have to carry another ammo type, which equals less space.
---
All dragon weapons are basically off the table, because of quest restrictions, too. And theres the D spear... which is shove. which is useless as you can imagine.
---
the only other spec weapon is the G-maul, which is a quick hit. if he was able to go to the grotesque guardians, he could get the G-hammer, but task only.
---
Just not used to using geometric distribution, seems kinda pointless other than explaining to people in a simpler form

It’s a beginner clue , what do you expect

Clue scrolls

Does this game mode give combat exp? I have a lvl 3 skillet but I want the cabbage halo. Anyone know?

600k. It’s pitiful, and it’s only going down as the sword drops.

Is it just a NEET thing to default to racial, homophobic slurs when they get upset? Seems like I see it the most from people whose lives revolve around online games or communities and may not interact much or at all with POC (or even just people in general) IRL.
---
So play with a team?  DG solo was still over 100k exp a hour. Iron men are holding the game back now.
---
&gt; Perpetuating the false belief that “well if Jagex upgrades their detection then the bot makers will just change their bots” is exactly the reason why seemingly simple to detect bots are still in the game.
---
Can you please tell me where this is false? Because you know, that's not exclusive to botting in Runescape, that's a saying repeated for decades within the Developer Community when it comes to cyber security and cheating. I mean, if it was a false belief we'd have no malwares at this point in time but guess what? We do have a shit ton of them, malwares, ransomwares, adwares, spywares, all sorts of them. I'm not saying it's impossible to do a good job at anti-botting or anti-cheating in general, what I'm saying is that it's impossible to completely get rid of it. 
---
&gt; The fact that you’re having this conversation and casually mentioning you hop into hitting discords is a pretty big red flag imo.
---
How's that a red flag? I feel better by understanding and learning the whole situation from both sides than being frustrated forever because I genuinely believe Jagex has the solution right in front of their noses and everyone but me is completely oblivious to it. I mean, just because I know the effects of meth because I sometimes read /r/Drugs doesn't mean I'm a meth addict or even interested in doing it myself and believing so is absurd to say the least.
---
You fucker
---
Thanks, adding "PvM" to my name
---
It might be mainly AMD but it definitely affects Intel + NVidia too, I have two friends that have been complaining about their fps in there and they both run intel cpus with Nvidia gpus
---
It would be dead on release as a mini game.
---
I’d love to see dungeoneering in OSRS. I just would also want chaotics to be balanced differently, I felt they were too good back in the day and would devalue a lot of current items. But I loved dungeoneering as a skill and hope it returns someday.
---
This is really cute until it rips your face off

I was in world 301 and some chad was handing out 4m to people

just get it(:
---
Ok let me try to respond to each block, on mobile so I'm sorry if its a little weird or if I miss something.
---
So on the first topic of they shouldnt care about helping their situation, I feel like thats a really odd take. If the only way to keep themselves affloat is to interact with an outaide economy, how is their country supposed to ever recover? Furthermore, why not work a more legitimate online job? They have the skill of speakings a non english language, if they got a rudimentary understanding of english they could find work on fiverr or somewhere else doing translating work or correspondance. I know personally the company I work for is constantly looking for people who can speak Spanish and willing work odd hours, and we hire remotely so I can't see why someone in these countries couldn't work this kind of job making $11/hr instead of $0.70. 
---
Also I wasn't setting up a Kafka trap, I was directly mirroring the sentiments of people on the original thread. It was a post about someone on twitter reporting "manuel Venezuelans."  Also, you can see the exact sentiments in this thread, with people saying they need the game to stay afloat and "fuck the game," but then their post histories are riddled with appreciation for this game. I would imagine theyre the same people to say "wow the game is dying" when these issues come to light.
---
I like the idea of a well of goodwill, it could help and it would be interesting to see how the turn out on such an event would go. Given the popularity of some videos of killing venezuelan bots and players, I would say it would go over pretty mixed tbh.
---
So a lot of people have been criticising the bowling metaphor, but I think I have a better phrasing. What if instead of money, it was a trophy with like a super minute amount of a rare metal or something, to the point you can pawn it for $10. Then its an issue of monetary value versus sentimental value. Your gear has sentimental value, in game value. I argue they shouldn't have monitary value and people who use it for that mess up the game.
---
I understand ultimately my opinion doesn't matter too much on the topic of the Venwzuelan struggles, but I think we should just never address the games issue of gold farming, botting, and accoint hijacking.
---
Thanks for your post, I hope to get a response on this post. Sorry if its short, a bit of a busy day lol hope all is well with whoevers reading this
---
Maybe the pile of dragon darts that he's amassing from dragon implings.

It was over 100k exp a hour as a solo... how is that a waste of time when shit like mining/wc/rc is all under 70k unless you tick manipulate.

I feel like you can stack them on top better. I might be wrong but was there any better way to set them up?

I turned my 1635 total main into a personal bond farm for my btw, not looking forward to ~16 hours of gargs every two weeks lol. That starts tonight.

Really focusing on questing and obtaining supplies the way they were intended really brings new life into the game for me so I’m thoroughly enjoying starting over with an ironman account.

Ouch, yeah I was referencing how he seemed to have only slightly blurred out completely inconsequential information lol.

what i was possibly thinking, but you can't even enter the whirlpool until you get to that point.

I hate you lol gZz

---
Not sure why you're being downvoted. At its core, RS3 is fundamentally a different game. I would absolutely not consider it Runescape anymore.
---
Fair enough! I’ll admit the possibility of doing this is worthy of critique in its own right, but I stand by the importance of context of the original post being purposefully divorced from this one to continue to feed the vitriol on this sub.
---
I remember dieing tot Nomad time and time again. I did have kinda shit stats tho. I only managed to kill it thanks to 1 of the aura's, the 1 that made poison heal you instead of damage you. I want to zammy got like 10-16 poison healing me every 15 secs . That aura was OP
---
This ain’t it
---
I wasn't stacking them at the end. I had just reaggro'd them and I was 2k exp away from 99 range. My fingers were hurting and I was tired, didn't see any point in stacking them at that point.
---
But, when I was stacking them. They were all stacked in one spot. It looked like there was only one of them but there was really like 30-40 lol. No way to stack them better then that imo. It was a literally death dot of monkeys hahaha
---
?
---
I remember doing this quest and feeling the same way, but after reading the sign in front of the well by accident while passing through for Regicide I felt that it made sense

Also once you are in the farming guild kill the hespori every chance you get..it takes about 30 hours to grow. 100 kills is about 1,4 mil xp about 10% of the way to 99 and you get very useful anima seeds.
---
As someone who's never raided, if you go dry do you break even? If you go dry at barrows you kinda do in returns from runes and bolt racks

You just reminded me that it's Tuesday so

reeee my achievements are devalued

Right, but those are all HUGE changes to the game. How is nerfing an item equivalent to HD, EoC, etc?

??????
---
Got 99 construction banked today, what's a good 3x3 layout for when I've finished the training and can get rid of the bedrooms/dining room, etc that I need for now? I've got the regular garden for the main portal, two superior gardens (one with the tree/fairy ring combo, one with the obelisk), achievement gallery, portal nexus, and a workshop, so I'll need three more rooms and I'm really not sure what those should be.
---
That's pretty sinister.
---
Just completed my 50th chest. 0 loot. Fuck you
---
okay. I was thinking of doing some chinning to rank range up and i wanted to make sure my thoughts were correct on how to do it.
---
Yeah it terrible, but I dont think it should change, it has the highest chance for a pet and the garbage drop table kind of seems like a punishment for going for the easy one. (Coming from somebody who's only pet is purple cloud lol)
---
I’m 72 or 3 magic and when I hit 75 I’m gonna finish getting the god staves and do mage arena 2 while I’m at it for the cape. 
---
At that point, with occult necklace, can I burst dust devils? Or do I need more gear? 
---
Actually, what gear setup do I even need? I wanted to train defense since I fucked my void pure with tears of guthix, and figured I could burst easily from 44-60 or 70 while getting magic exp and gold.
---
I work in corporate finance so I apply a similar mindset to items using GE Market Watch.
---
Typically, I’ll take glance over the long term price trend, short term effect, what market intel is available (news updates, Q&amp;A’s, tweets from J Mods etc.)
---
Here’s one of my recent examples: Dragon Pickaxe. They rose in price with the release of crystal tool seeds but this was only marginal due to the small volume of them in the game. They announced that they would change the Zalcano loot system to be more proportionate and people were aware that better tools = better contribution to the kill. Ultimately, this would drive up the pickaxes price. Long term, the pickaxe has been continually rising from 5m over the long term and more so after the progress blogs for SotE. I deduced that it would be a good item to merch. I bought 11 and dumped them mid August.

Market intelligence is the best source of information. Coupled with a rudimentary understanding of human behaviour and you can make millions. That applies in RS too. ;-)
---
The level 3 with a nezzy is a bot?
---
At barrows most of the profit comes from the runes (also word of advice, only kill 2 skeles and 1 worm in end bit so you don’t get bolt racks, they bring profit down). 
---
It’s kinda different at raids. Each raid will get you 50-400k gp, so if you break even depends on the supplies you take in (darts, etc). But usually you profit a Lil bit so overall yeah
---
Peak particle effects
---
Sad to see the day when following the rules is an unpopular opinion.  Especially with ones as serious as real world trading.  This game has little time left before its playerbase ruins it.
---
Needs more upvotes.
---
did it work
---
no
---
will it ever
---
Buy from the ge.
---
Barrows gloves and then the quest cape. Essentials.
---
Clearly says bus
---
Fam mith darts can hit 400s
---
I was honestly expecting it to just be a normal account.
---
Lol i was being ironic, sensitive kids these days smh
---
Tons of people can't even get 1
---
The square items in his inventory are called teleport tabs. They can teleport you somewhere regardless of magic level or spellbook.
---
Pray melee the whole time, highly highly recommend bringing a bonecrusher necklace as you'll automatically get prayer points back in the catacombs. Keeping your prayer up is essential as you're facetanking 7+ dust devils at the same time
---
For your inventory you'll want darts (steel darts are super cheap) to aggro them, maybe 1-2 prayer pots, xeric's talisman, house tabs, and a rune pouch with runes for ice burst
---
Also dragon armor isn't that good but it looks fresh as hell
---
He'll ditch them once he starts grinding again
---
This is some Path of Exile MTX shit that freezes your game  as they load into the instance
---
Yo you have the buyers login details on there you should block that
---
1% tax on stakes
---
Is there casual now with the rework
---
Or just spend 11$ a month lol
---
pssst i’m new to osrs can someone explain this to me?
---
Idk how it's allowed it really shows a negative/toxic aspect of osrs. Like you're encouraging someone to step in your platform(s) and be a professional BUM
---
We lost 5 jmods that day
---
Player count probably was 15% below trend or something. You gotta remember that people came right back/AFKed before/while getting set up on WoW.
---
I would say there was no dignity there to begin with.
---
How tf does one afk those things? Addy dragons kick the shit out of me alone lol
---
Bro it's his restrictions.  He can change the rules so it's not an episode per year.
---
Can we get a fossil storage crate by the entrance to volcanic mine?
---
the circlejerk is comments like yours nowadays, “rs3 is actually pretty fun” or “stop saying rs3 bad” is always the high-voted comments in rs3 threads on this sub
---
other guy is probably flaring the post.
---
I don't get why they can't just add a single world for it. Hell, I'd even take hide entity like Runelite.
---
Or just go play classic wow :^)
---
Whatever you want, I'm not gonna shame you for it. I just personally wouldn't do it, if I ever make an ironman I'm probably gonna just write my current name backwards and see if that works.
---
I mean you’re assuming everyone kills people just to get loot which isn’t at all the case
---
It looks worse on the people loaning him if anything lol gotta be fanboys
---
Not even, osrs uses a max of 6mb/hr
---
You'd need to play about 100 hours to use 500 mbs
---
Source: I use a 1gb hotspot only for osrs mobile, it lasts me about 250 hours of gameplay.
---
Yeah I get it but there's so many times where no reasonable person would have anything of value on them, like black salamanders, and it's a bit of a frustration.
---
You're right. I hold my OSRS content creators as my role models. They should be above this!
---
I actually like that the community is helping out swampletics
---
A ranged weapon, a melee weapon and a mage weapon, along with water spells. I assume you're not very experienced with chambers so you're gonna get slapped by olm anyway especially in a duo. Don't worry much about gear.
---
I got 92 smithing making cballs🙃
---
154 total, no member's experience. Not really much of a loss.
---
Lol. I love Reddit.
---
Yeah but it’s cheap and boots and platelets would do me good. Only have 10 mil and my biggest purchase yet was a b ring to imbue. 
---
Just started doing barrows yesterday, haven’t done much higher level stuff I’ve been questing all month since I started to get RFD done. Barrows gloves are sweet though I’m happy I did the grind.
---
You witnessed a legend on that day.
---
Yeah, but then you edited your comment to say we cant handle the truth. Meaning we couldn't handle the truth it's NOT a fantasy game? Cuz it is
---
I think it’s great, 1% isn’t shit in whatever you’re staking, just chips away slightly but on a massive scale  away from the system
---
Meh I'd say contruction is worse as its all based on money per xp. Not saying I don't like the house utility.
---
Many people who play OSRS probably play it because they don't like the action bar MMOs.
---
I mean it mentions it in the skill log just like all other requirements lol
---
Here is the best kept merching secret right here, follow the bots. Thats it! Gold farmers that use bots have to switch up what theyre doing to avoid being banned so just watxh how when they switch fron making cballs to lets say hunting chinchompas the price of cballs will rise. Yes this is small profit .  unless you got alot of investing money
---
I'm sorry you missed the point of what I said so I will elaborate.
---
"The dps wasn't horrible compared to the people I was with as a 1 def."
---
"However, you're right if I did not have a team or a maxed character then I would not have gotten on the team as a 1 def."
---
The only people you ever grouped with at 1 def are your friends but you also just lowkey said their dps was so bad your 1 def pure was outdoing them.
---
Now maybe that's not what you meant, but if that's the case then you need to put less effort into raiding and more effort into your writing skills. As a fellow and seemingly more competent (though admittedly lazier) office worker, trust me when I say being clear when you write out reports and e-mails works wonders. Communication is the key to a better work environment.
---
so what happened here lmao
---
To those wondering about the green d'hide body; he can kill red dragons in dungeon on brimhaven and get a red d;hide body.
---
I mean, in OSRS you can dress as a chicken/cow/imp hybrid so both games have stupid shit in them.
---
The good ol' squat n stomp method, always reliable
---
Fucking exactly... like what would you do? People don't ask themselves that enough. Can OP truly honestly say that if he was fucking starving in a completely broken economy he would just suck it up and try to pull himself up by his bootstraps and get some job making 30 cents an hour in a useless currency? These dudes could be out robbing and killing for food, and a lot of them do...
---
Rehehehe ringer ry rutt
---
Ding ding
---
&gt; No sane person...

I admire your tenacity, but worry for your mental health.

Some are top tier fashionscape, some are neon or overdesigned abominations that don't fit the game. Also, all wings are ugly.
---
Came to say this, thank you
---
God that looks annoying to do.
---
I would beg to differ but since neither of us could prove our point without a doubt ....
---
Instead they're killing nakeds for.... Meaningful PvP experience?
---
Idk about you, but idk a single osrs player that hasn't gotten pissed off and typed some offensive shit
---
It's literally becuz he makes YouTube videos that you care... And you don't even watch his videos.
---
i remember it was polled as +6 pray bonus therefore they should fix/update it.
---
It would be fine as a minigame- it just doesn't need to be a skill or give such insane rewards.
---
Wtf just happened here
---
Nah same number. People are smarter as they got older
---
Me too, lmao
---
Bro you edited your og comment and made a whole new comment just to complain about downvotes. There's nothing ironic about that.
---
It was just a praaaank brrrooo, I was only pretending to whine about downvotes!
---
A mithril boy pking on mobile. Nice.
---
I would love to see more details on farming and herblore training with also some profit calculation.
---
There are great sheets on herbs to farm for profit, the Excel sheet from HalalSnakbar is great.
---
But as I’ve always been making potions of my farmed herbs, and not selling the herbs.
---
I lose some of the profit, which is understandable because I use the herblore xp myself.
---
But for example, I’ve been doubting making Ranarrs or Snapdragons. Yield of Snaps gives much more farming and herblore XP from super restores, but I guess the profit of making Prayer pots from Ranarrs is a bit higher.
---
Just hit 78 herblore with 81 farming.
---
Anyone who knows more or done some calculations on this?
---
racism happened
---
&gt; This game is about the journey not the destination. If you skip most of your journey for the destinations what else is there to do?
---
Again, that may be how you play the game, but that's not how everyone does. For me, the biggest appeal of the game is the PVM content. I'd rather not have to grind 300+ hours of runecrafting just to afford basic bossing gear, that's not what the game is about to me
---
this is the point of the post yes
---
i mean whys it all gone
---
I love this
---
[deleted]
---
they raised one coin, thats what happened
---
The price went up by 1
---
They went up 1gp
---
And that noob you gave 20k to? He grew up to be the guy who gave you 200k.
---
And that guy who gave you 200k? He grew up to be you in the past.
---
Yeah but gp doesn't cross over. So why not just have the bonds cross over? In which game you cash them in is up to yourself.
---
Yeah lemme load runelite up on my android

is this a meme

Windows Defender is great. Get an adblocker on your browser like uBlock origin (not just uBlock) as evil advertisements can wreck you even without user interaction and most website don't screen the advertisements displayed. Other than that, use unique passwords on everything and enable 2-factor authentication wherever you can and you should be fine.

Has just become? Botting and gold farming is as old school as it gets.
---
Why should they?
---
The people with PvP in the name are the worst!
---
Oh get over it
---
Oof I mean I'd understand if he just insulted him but the slurs are a big no-no
---
It’s kind of a joke how more feet around your ankles so more damage being taken in iteration to that.
---
Because both economies would have to always be 100% the same which is impossible, otherwise people will buy &amp; sell to profit in the most profitable version of the game, then you've got inflation as it'd be like printing out millions of dollars to everyone in the USA whereby money would be useless and it'll also promote 3rd party gold selling
---
The fact you guys are so fucking butt hurt about what someone said on the internet proves you cunts are the biggest pussies, no wonder you guys got bullied at school, no one can say shit now a days without losers like you being offended
---
You are totally right, but if they ever consider Dung it should be revamped like the rewards system and I also understand the skill part, but I’d rather have Dung as a skill rather than warding tbh. Dung was actually fun and requires brain power rather than just clicking at the same thing for hours till 99. I understand not every skill in osrs is clicking on the same things for hours, but you get what I mean.
---
Yikers
---
No, that's 4chan/b/
---
Unless you did zmi, yes
---
this looks epic lol
---
Ah yeah of course. Because you can buy them with in-game gp. My bad.
---
Venezuelans  would rise, the items will lose its price, its basic economy
---
He’s REEEEing

This is stupid

 Because its be awkward when its the only world thats full

Redditors need to watch another movie

What is a circlejerk. Is it kind of like the “meta”?

For the challenge!
---
Release a lucky impling
---
Nice.
---
Not only are they strong, they pump out adrenaline to the max and don’t hold back in fear of repercussion or self-injury, the layman’s term is “retard strength”. It’s why police, EMTs and first responders take extra care and/or bring in trusted family members to talk sense into mentally challenged people having dangerous tantrums, they’ll sooner break their necks head butting you through a wall.
---
Oh for sure the grind is real for this dude. But still, some of the drop rate luck he has with things is incredible.
---
This isn't something new, fucking lmfao. People have been buying gold to skip shitty grinds since fucking classic dude. Plus all i play is ironman specifically because of how pointless grinding money is.
---
I mean. Jagex SELLS GOLD. Who do you really think is the problem? The multimillion dollar company or the people scraping by to live?
---
Duel Arena and GE trading but most people just use autotypers because you can't guarantee everyone will be on autochat.
---
Actually no... You'd buy a bond in rs3 for 20m and exchange it for 4m osrs gp if they'd carry over. Economies wouldn't have to be the same, you can't take your rs3 gp to the osrs ge...
---
Still better than people doing lLlIlLI with PVP usernames
---
Yeah, ima listen to you lmfao. Already lost my bank at sand casino once due to sheer stupidity soooo
---
No it's a suggestion, sorry if I got the flair wrong
---
It was a pretty smart idea by Jagex. Instead of making the player god status, it forces the gods to come down to the players level.
---
Mate just cut your losses it's basic to understand
---
In your opinion, what is the downside to too much polling?
---
Some people use it for hundred of hours and still don't get a ban hah. I probably will use macro again after ban is over, cause rs don't make me happy or interested anymore  , but macro do 😏
---
I don't care about the 99.9%!
---
It's the .1% that gives me sleepless nights...
---
It was a bunch of hoorah and hooplah, just as we suspected.
---
You didn't say inferno. That is a different conversation, since inferno and nomad's requiem are not even in the same universe of difficulty. If 14 year old me who had never even done gwd could do it on a 45 def account (near release) without dying at all then sorry bud, it was not difficult. 
---
If anyone is alive that would take 200+ hours of failures to complete that quest, then sure, have your talking point that its easier to make 1b. But I think you're gonna have a hard time finding that person.

If the windy wasn’t dangerous anymore. Everyone would just do wildly slayer all the time for max slayer points and the wilderness bosses drops with be worthless cause everyone would constantly do them safely.

---
OSRS
---
Not related to the post that much but can you toggle what messages you get when you log in? It's annoying to get all the flax and sand messages and such
---
It's the same thing, so unenforceable. Jagex saying Mousekeys are fine means that everything 1:1 is de facto fine to use. Not in terms of the rules, but in terms of what they can enforce.
---
As PvMer, who doesn't like PvP in OSRS, I wholeheartedly...disagree. Part of the fun, the thrill, of the Wildy is the chance that at any point, you run into someone who may decide to end your current goal of doing whatever you're doing there
---
The entire point of the cloak is the flex. There's no way your legitimately using this cloak for anything else.
---
just learned 3t barb fishing w/ knife and 1 tick quick pray flicking...Pretty easy to get into the rhythm once you learn it. 
---
Runelites metronome feature makes it sooo much easier. Dont even need animations or game sounds on to time to flick. Can watch a movie and flick lol
---
but has it have to be the 14 millionth loot?
---
Yeah you only got 2nd place for it.
---
Honestly, it is not that much more. Mainly just the Myreque series and some stuff like Menaphos that I don't recall going over well. SotE added a ton of RS3 lore to OSRS.
---
why would you comment jst to point out his grammar? are you a shitty text recognition ai lmao
---
I figured my sarcasm would be more obvious, damn.
---
"That annoy pures" 
---
Erm. Youve got it backwards? The pures are the annoying ones here, risking a glory/maybe dds expecting someone to skull who risks 500k+ nonskull.
---
They reply a lot more consistently on Twitter
---
So like ornamental kits for T bow and scythe?
---
Karils bow? Buy the ammo from the dude at the docks. Farm gargs for cash. Repeat.
---
Yea a regular laner... That starts between your opponents towers!
---
What? I have all skilling pets and my highest level is 78 farming, they are rather easy to get
---
Just seems like top comment might wanna know there’s a mistake in his post, that’s all. Just trying to be helpful lol
---
The community voted no to partnerships on a poll so Jagex can't add microtransations without a poll.
---
Do it on mobile with 2 fingers 😎
---
Nice man. I actually had 10 items in my first 100kc which is sick, and now i'm 130kc without another and i funnily feel dry...there are ppl out there struggling much more :P
---
Just lower the drop rates on wildy pets if it turns out that is the case. Most wilderness achievements arent actually gained in the wilderness, for example you need 90 smithing for the elite wilderness diary but you can get that level without training it in the wilderness at all.
---
yeah if you look past the cosmetics.. and the pay2win... and the economy inflation... and the dwindling player counts... and the lack of quality updates... and the lack of communication between the devs and the playerbase... and the hyper XP power creep where you can afk almost every skill at over 100k xp/h... then yeah it is a pretty good game.
---
I'm not giving anyone a fucking R

more like 141'6k/h non stop use, well, still cheap but amethists are even more so

There is still the risk of being banned for selling gold, you wont make a steady income with that...
---
killing people for their negative reactions sounds kinda wack
---
I remember when i first started basic runes were 2-3 gp each. I wonder why theyre 5-6 now
---
Well not every item spawn, I saw a youtuber get a bond by picking up steel(?) platebodies in the wilderness once and I think that's a fair method of making gp as it is click intensive and requires a lot of focus and world hopping.
---
Lol so what?
---
Anyone know my best bet of finding a heroes quest partner? I've joined the SOA clan but there was only 1 other member. I'm up to the point at brimhaven and I can't progress without having the Phoenix member to help. Any suggestions?

Keep trying indeed. At one point the request will come through, cc mate had the same problem (not hacked but temporarily blocked because it seemed someone was bruteforcing passwords). Jagex really needs to step their f\*ing game up with their "support".

For me, part of what makes the challenge interesting is finding ways to maximize that alternative storage. But there are accounts out there which don't use looting bag or zulrah, etc. So if you'd like a bit of extra challenge, that's definitely an option and it's definitely respectable.
---
my clan gonna camp this spot now gg ur account
---
Items needed: none
---
Hnnnnghh
---
Then why are you here?
---
legit
---
I do not think so. At the moment, I think Elvarg can 3-shot you rather easily.
---
First, you should rank your melee stats to 40 so you can get a rune sword- not scimitar. Elvarg is weak to stab damage so a rune sword on stab is better against her (yes, Elvarg is a woman) than a scimmy.
---
As for good monsters to train on, try:
---
Hill Giants in edgeville dungeon (Crowded, due to the limpwurts/big bones they drop being decent cash)
---
Hobgoblins in Asgarnia Ice Dungeon (near thurgo for the knight's sword quest). Drops limpwurts and decent runes.
---
Minotaurs or Flesh Crawlers on level B1/B2 of the stronghold of security
---
On your next attempt, make sure to unlock the shortcut south of elvarg before you fight her. If you don't, you'll have to rebuild the entire boat again.
---
I have the same problem as of right now, been going on for 30 minutes
---
Yeah, completely out of the blue. Could you elaborate further on the not being logged in bit?

The problem with RS3 is that it's very mediocre, not so much that it's bad. OSRS is unique in that outside of mobile games "basically a glorified skinner box" doesn't really exist as a genre, but RS3? There are thousands of mmos just like it/better.
---
Gratz man
---
Venezuelans go away, the demand stays the same, prices go up, makes it more profitable for the gold farmers that are left. there's obviously plenty of gold bc it's always available for 20 minute delivery lmfao.

Yes still has competitive and casual, I assume it should work like before in terms of ironman.

When you die normally you keep 3 items (plus an additional with the protect item prayer on) unless you’re skulled which means you lose all your items (plus one w protect item).
---
You become skulled by attacking another player first (you don’t skull if you’re fighting back)
---
The guy in black wants to fight the guy but doesn’t want to lose his 3 items when he dies.

The joke is that the guy in black is risking like 50k skulled whereas the guy he wants to fight is risking 50+ m

Anyone who buys gold can attest that it can take hours to get if they dont have the supply ...even comments on these gold sites about stupid wait times ...

Her right hand is backwards.
---
So are you saying you don't like dominating your lane in league, thus making your enemy feel bad? I know the example is a bit off, because in league he went into the game because he wanted to fight you, but hear me out. 
---
Sometimes it's just fun to win for the sake of winning. A lot of games ultimately comes very little down to skill, yet it's still fun to win. If you're 12-0 in your lane you don't find the game boring or worry about your opponent not having fun, you're just enjoying the feeling of being in the top of the game. 
---
I don't think you can compare this to bullying, it's more comparable to having fun at someone's expense, and if that's your definition of ''enjoying to make someone feel bad'', then yes, I do enjoy making people feel bad. It's never as fun being the bud of the joke as it is to make the joke, but most people are able to laugh at their own expense too. If someone makes fun of my voice cracking, it mildly annoys me, but I can still laugh at it. 
---
If you kill some naked dude, you find it amusing because you've caused them a mild inconvenience, similar to taking someones pen and having them look under the table for 5 seconds before giving it back. 
---
If you look at the game rust, it's literally all about killing people and setting them back, and a lot of people find that fun. It's not always about big loot or a fair fight, it can be fun to just defeat someone in games. 
---
Targeted harassment of a player is wrong and comparable to bullying, but killing someone ones because they were in your proximity really isn't. I can understand you not finding it fun, but I really can't understand your lack of acknowledgement to the fact that some people can find it amusing.
---
They only really banned the betting bots when people started to really complain about them on reddit. Tbh the rng bots are the easiest example. Their name literally tells you they’re a bot yet Jagex was super slow banning them until they figured out a system that worked. We need a similar system for all of the bots. Something that just works better.

Well early on in this server a blue was going for as high as 20m. I could've seen it get out of hand especially now that the online players are 4x higher than when rares were originally spawned across the map in mid 2013.

The prolly playing WOW
---
Don’t think he’ll be able to complete rfd. But he can get some better gloves.
---
I think it's because amylase is stackable, so you can do 27 potions per inventory instead of 14.
---
Lowers and elites excluding long seem to have gained. Pickaxe is up and axe is steady. I think both pickaxe and axe are still about as rare as an xmas cracker currently is on rs3. I suspect they lose a lot of status because they don't have the mental satisfaction of knowing they'll only get rarer.
---
it's in the comments here, link was just fucked up.

After all the feedback i decided to kill hill hiants in the dungeon bu the GE. I really havent done alot of grinding. Done tons of quests that provide XP to shoot me up. Finding out food is exspensive to buy at my level though. Cooked mest doesn't cut it and my fishing is only level 3.

XP is entirely pay to win, what do you mean??
---
If you can max your account in a month due to huge amounts of IRL money, that's a massive unfair advantage to people who don't have lots of IRL money.

Thing is, words might be just words but letting words go unchecked can lead to mentalities and eventually actions. Words are incredibly powerful my dude.

Can we increase loot time after kills by 5 seconds as game progresses? 
---
At the later stages it is impossible to loot your kill and open key, before someone attacks you, leaving you at a disadvantage for the whole fight.

*laughs in redwood trees*

oh awesome thanks

Already doing this @28 aoe farming mobs only

Oof. You need some better fishing stat. Try to get up to 30 fishing and 25 cooking so you can do fly fishing for salmon right next door at the barbarian village- those heal for 9 and there's a campfire right next door for easy cookin's.

Already did waterfall and i will do witches potion for HP. Thanks

While I generally agree with your sentiment, Jagex sold OSRS on the fact that it was a love letter to the community and it's actions were based off of community feedback. I don't think they should have to poll everything, but when they've polled just about everything it's a little weird when they choose not to.
---
That being said, the people saying Jagex can't be trusted at all seem to just be hyperbolic jackasses. Like they created a game most of y'all sunk countless hours over a decade in, and you don't think they know a thing or two about design?
---
Right. I just mean if he works towards the goal he'll get a lot of important quests done along the way.
---
Ok thanks
---
if you need to ask you probably can’t do vorkath tbh lol
---
I second this, then Knights of Ardounge after that. Black Jack is worse than RC imo......Pyramid Plunder is a nice change of pace.
---
what are your stats?
---
Like armor sets for us f2p noobs?
---
Yeah, I wish OSRS has stuff like the Dragonkin lore and Nex and all that. Those questlines were some of my favorite before I quit RS3.

Circlejerk is basically the topic of discussion in echo chambers.

Pures are the 1%

But if weight is an issue couldn't be just note the pickaxe until he needs it?
---
The issue is that people are referencing a show from the 90s when they were born in the 00s

Combat with rock/sand/ammonite crabs. You can go 10 mind with auto retaliate on before needing to reset.
