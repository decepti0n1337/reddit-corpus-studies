What exactly about not hiding poll results prevents Jagex from manipulating the results if they want to? Seriously though, if they have manipulated several polls recently would you even know?

The engine team doesn't write runescript though... They work in java, building the backend which supports the runescript the devs use.

The problem there is people with the knowledge and experience to write fast, well written and robust java code for systems of that scale are in huge demand, and as such can demand much higher pay.

Most of the time it‚Äôs because if you‚Äôre good at Runescape your good at wasting a ton of time doing repetitive actions and clicking like some kind of weird  human metronome instead of actually playing a *game*.

He gained 68.558.529 exp in a day
---
60 x 60 x 24 = 86400 seconds in a day
---
68.558.529 / 86.400 = 793.5 exp per second
---

1 damage = 4 exp

793.5 / 4 = 198.38 damage per second

Oh without a doubt. She grew up in one of the few prefectures that were barely ever affected by earthquakes, though, so she gets spooked.

But we're moving to Okinawa together next year. Maybe by then, Jagex'll have Asia servers :(
---
It didn't really give it a purpose, since having higher than 50 fm doesn't provide much of an advantage besides slight damage reduction.
---
There are some inconsistent mechanics in the game when it comes to bosses becoming invincible. Most bosses that can become invincible also become untargetable or unattackable, but there are some that don't, even though they probably should.
---
 
---
The grotesque guardians become completely untargetable when they do their coloured light phase change, but dusk is clickable during the phases where you need to kill dawn, even though dusk can never be dealt damage during these phases. **Could you make dusk untargetable during the first and third phase of the grotesque guardians fight?** This would help especially during the third phase when dawn throws out her energy spheres, since it is very difficult to pick up the spheres if they land underneath dusk.
---
When vorkath uses his ice breath to freeze players before he sends out an undead spawn, vorkath becomes completely immune to damage, but players that were attacking him before he uses his ice breath will keep attacking vorkath even though there is no reason they would want to. This can be detrimental when using a crossbow since sometimes your ruby bolt special attack can trigger, hurting you but dealing no damage to vorkath. Also, because of the slow attack speed of crossbows, accidentally attacking vorkath while he's invincible can make it unreasonably difficult to cast crumble undead on the undead spawn in time, causing you to take unnecessary damage in a way that does not feel fair. **Could you make it so players stop attacking vorkath when he becomes invincible?** There was a poll near the start of QoL month which asked if players should stop attacking when frozen by vorkath's ice breath, but this wouldn't fix the issue of the invincibility being inconsistent, or with ruby bolts triggering while vorkath's ice breath is in mid-air. That poll question also had a very high rate of players voting to skip the question, which should indicate that many players didn't understand what benefit the change would have for players. If the change (that makes players stop attacking) was based on vorkath becoming invincible, then it would be much easier for players to understand the purpose of the change.

Any luck on your screenshots?
---
At the end of the day it failed a poll vote. At this point as much as I love the memes the best thing for those who want it is to look up times when Jagex has repolled something and have it pass the poll a second time. If Jagex hasn't gave content a second chance or only does it rarely what makes people think Jagex will this time?

That only counts for Slayer xp since it just tracks the kill, not the damage you deal (I believe it needs to be partner slayer as well). I didn't know how you obtained intelligence at first, but yeah after looking it up it's a drop, so you need to deal damage and gain non-HP xp.

It just seems that SO many people do it, that there must be a logical reason. But it seems the answer I am getting is that all these RS players just have no life at all outside of the game?

Well like I said, what took you 1000 hours on an ironman would take you 100 on a main. If you wanted a main it would take 0 time at all to get it to 1750 total level and above.

**Could less commonly used transportation methods be improved?** 
---
canoe stations: 
---
* allow players to store a dragon axe at each station (it would be irretrievable) so that they wouldn't need to bring one
---
* allow players to right click the tree and select the desired destination, then game would fade to black while your character cuts the tree down. Then move the player to the destination, assuming they have the required woodcutting level to craft the needed canoe (right now there are a multitude of intermediary steps that greatly slow down canoeing)
---
* add a stepping stone agility shortcut (that is actually quick) for player to cross the river next to the canoe station in Lumbridge
---
gnome gliders:
---
* add a shortcut (possibly with an agility requirement) to the Grandtree ladder to take players to the top floor
---
* allow players to use the glider at the digsite (maybe with some quest or construction required)
---
hot air balloons:
---
* allow players to substitute higher tier logs (specifically yew and magic) for lower tier ones (this would make stocking the crate simpler)
---
dwarven mine carts:
---
* allow players to purchase a lifetime pass for 100k (like in Zeah)
---
* allow players to move between locations without needing to stop in Keldagrim by right-clicking the cart (this could allow for faster payment as well) 
---
* maybe add a cart to the asgarnia ice cave (with completion of Knight's Sword and The Giant Dwarf)
---
eagles:
---
* add an aerie to Tirannwn
---
* allow left-clicking the eagle
---
* add a rope spawn to the jungle aerie
---
* add a rope spawn to Eagle's peak
---
If you're at 60 defense, you can upgrade your armor to Obsidian or Dragon Platelegs or skirt for your legs, Toktz-ket-xil for your shield (upgrade to dragon defender when you can), and Rune or Dragon boots for your feet.  Look into the Fremennik Trials and Isles quests to unlock Berserker Helm and Helm of Neitiznot.  
---
For your chestpiece, the Fighter Torso is your goal, but you may want to wait a few more combat levels before doing Barbarian Assault.  Rune Platebody is fine for general purpose stuff.  Granite Platebody or Dragon Chainbody are alternatives depending on your budget.  
---
O'course!

For anyone using ShareX, I believe it defaults to mp4 with the screen recorder. To change it to webm, go to Task Settings -&gt; Screen Recorder -&gt; Screen Recorder Options and then change the video codec to whatever you want (webm suggested).

I know it's a humor post but for real they can't do good in your eyes. Don't reset pures from a bug = Jagex boogey man evil. They take the time to manually do this, when we already know from history what can go wrong with manual intervention (archer rings...) and now they're still Jagex boogey man evil.

In theory this could have been corrected quickly enough that no one would have even noticed. It was only 24 accounts. If the account didn't need to be logged in, we'd probably never have even heard about it. Announcements are more appropriate for widespread issues.

There's also steam achievements if you install it through steam lol

Yeah this community has gone to shit.

This update actually affects me unlike majority of you.

Actually there was recently a method discovered where if you attacked a monster on the exact tick it spawned you would do real damage and not gain any combat exp and get the drop. I don't know how hard it would be to do this with organized crime since it spawns randomly in different worlds at different locations.. But theoretically possible? 
---
If you don't have any qualms of spending money for your first bond, absolutely. You can get past a lot of the early levels through membership quests, and it is far easier to make money in membership than it is in F2P, even as a level 3.

---
I agree with that. 100-500 seems fair to me. It should absolutely not be above 500 for the reasons you mention.
---
However, I think it could have 10-50x increase in cost to get a permanently unlocked toggle option. 1k-10k would be fine for something like that. Ironmen can still easily get a blue fire chicken, but they won't easily get the permanent toggle unlock for the blue chicken. The exact number should be decided by Jagex after they take a look at the total number of firelighters and phoenixes in-game. It should make the price of the firelighters go up, but it shouldn't be so expensive that it effectively removes firelighters from the economy.
---
What should i spend money on? I have max house (83 cons) and 99 crafting. As for buyables i have 70 smiting, 50 herb, 80 range, 82 mage.

My personal opinion here... but I don't think it should get a recolor. Yes those recolors are amazing but the only I feel like recolors should stay for skilling pets. This is a boss pet.
---
I mean, don't give up on dragon hunter lance, it's definitely amazing... But a hasta works just as well (Tent whip is better in certain rotations, but Hasta is good for Vasa, can be used at Tekton if you don't have a bludgeon, and does decent damage to olm hand). I'd say DHL would qualify as a goal to use for CoX, not baseline (Don't forget, people were doing solos waaaaaay before DHL was a thing).

It also has no negative stats, and has really good defense stats, plus a minor prayer bonus

78 herblore, 90 if you can afford, since it will help you out at raids. Ice bursting in the MM2 caves is about 3-4gp/exp and over 200k mage exp/hr if you want to get magic up. I don‚Äôt have experience with chinning, but you burn through money way faster, so I‚Äôd just suggest hopping on the Slayer grind with a cannon and blowpipe.
---
I‚Äôve mainly noticed it happening when I‚Äôm raiding in the chambers of xeric. If I had to guess I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs actually a problem runelite, but no clue lol

Management can be okay if you're a simple man. Really if you marry, both work, and don't expect a new iPhone every year or have like 7 pairs of ugly rainbow designer shoes(and want 14 more) then you'll get by just fine. It also helps if you don't live directly in a city where the cost of rent alone could be spent buying a double wide manufactured home on like 10 acres with your own septic and well, If you just move out 30-50 miles from the center. 
---
I don't know what people on this sub think of the world, but you don't need much money to have a happy successful life. You just need consistent money. 
---
Considering most of this sub is early 20's I can see why they'd get defensive about working at fast food still. They're generally still insecure about where they are in college and compare their degree to what they can make per hour to see if they're "doing good" with still no real idea of "what they want".
---
This whole thing confused the shit outa me

I was going to ask if you use runelite, I can see it being much worse happening in a situation like that

The trick is to change directions each time you re-agro, I like spot on sandcrab isle that is in the Southwest, so when I first go north to re-agro then next time I got east, then north again and repeat, looking at the previous comment you can see why this works

I went to around 90-91 on Ensouled Dragon Heads, and I did Dragon Bones at gilded altars for the remainder since I have been sick lately and needed some more afk training. I can't recall the total price, but 91-99 on dragon bones was much more costly than ensouled heads.

Is there a recommended upgrade order for farming Vorkath?  My current setup is pretty welfare/minimum requirements - elite void, assembler, salve, BP, dhide boots, barrows gloves, and an archer's ring.  I believe my average kill time is probably right around 2 mins, though sometimes I get a shitty 3:00+ with bad hits.  I get 3-4 kills per trip.  As I understand it, the upgrades I need to be going for would be DHCB, dragonfire ward, pegs, and rigour.  Those are all expensive as absolute fuck, so I'd like to know which one(s) to prioritize for the greatest increase in kill speed. 
---
3 every 15mins or 30 mins? I can‚Äôt remember what my average was?
---
This is correct 
---
wait what happened exactly? 
---
Hi, im not new to the game, but i know very little. Im just finishing up with 99 att and str and idk what to do with it all. Where should i start late game content? What can my character do at 115 combat
---
You are probably really early on in your account so I would suggest restarting if you want 1 def. If you had like 200m exp or something then maybe make a different kind of account out of it.
---
Oh people just vote Yes to everything? Why hide poll results, no way people would look at what's winning and vote with it!

They are indeed easy if you know what you're doing.

But they are both way slower, and, not everyone is 100+ raids kc and very good at gearswitching/redemption thinging.

I'd say many of the average raiders like the easier rooms.

Let's ignore the fact mobile exists.
---
Let's ignore the fact not everyone is working AND going to school.
---
And let's ignore the fact that only a very small percentage of the player base is even considering going for a 200m in a skill, let alone achieving it.
---
168 hours in a week. Take away 70 for being human (8 hours a day sleeping, 2 hours a day cooking/eating/shitting/shaving/showering/whatever) and you're left with 98. Take away 50 for working (5x8 hour shifts, +2 hours for breaks &amp; commute) and you're left with 48. Take away 20 for school (5x 1 hr classes + 30 min of commute, 12.5 hours for studying/doing homework/whatever) and you're left with 28. Take away another 20 hours for socializing, other hobbies, going to the gym, whatever. This leaves you with 8 hours a week to play runescape, or roughly an hour a day.
---
Lets say your goal is 200m Cooking, since it's one that can be done quickly and without any requirements (1 ticking karambwans makes money, so no need to make gold then spend on on a skill, etc.). Cooking takes \~ 200 hours for 200m. At 8 hours a week (A very casual player by all means), you could have this done in about 5.5 months.

Combat is definitely still "the way to go", if there is such a thing.  You can do whatever you want, but the best shit in the game is still all combat related.  Almost all of the best moneymakers in the game are combat related, and the top-end "challenges" in the game are all combat - raids, inferno, vorkath, zulrah, GWD, slayer.  PKing obviously is still all combat.  Combat is still generally where it's at, unless you have some specific preference for another skill.

You can do most things in the game assuming you have decent mage/range. I'd recommend trying out some of the slayer bosses.

What's the gp/hr of ToB?
---
As mentioned in the top comment, Swampletics feels like an "adventure" and has a more story feel to it, with a predetermined end point of the Theatre of blood, and his journey there, like the hero slaying the dragon, Naruto becoming hokage, etc. It's satisfying to know that we're watching how something happened, and not just watching things unfold.
---
PvP but hcim is a lot of fun, and I watch both series the moment the episodes come out, but ultimately I'm more excited for Swampletics because of the story telling, the time invested in problem solving and discovery, and all that jazz. Hcim is fun, and has exciting moments, but doesn't feel as unique.

I think it's rigour first then DHCB. Ward and pegs aren't as important.

If your worried about rigging they could literally just do that right now.

&gt;	Also, ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù changes should not be implemented without a poll either.

Then you would be fine with old zulrah, old splashing, old NMZ, and pretty much no overtuned content to ever be fixed? Seems like an incredibly stupid thing to do.

Unfortunately, Herblore is a no-go since you need to go into Taverley. There's the Apothecary for the purpose though he has potential to make more potions for you.

No. But a lot of people do or vote for whatever has the most percentage.

!kc and other chat commands are a Runelite plugin. It displays the kill count registered by the client. If you did more kills on let's say mobile Runelite wouldn't know so it would give the wrong number.

A barrows drop is 1/16 so you have a pretty good chance every run.
---
Rigour then DHL. 
---
Looks way better than the dogshit first one everyone is praising
---
What do you mean? What effects does it have?
---
Did you find it super difficult at all? Any of the bosses give you trouble? I'm 78 range and 73 defense so that's good to hear 
---
That‚Äôs fine. But I didn‚Äôt see that written anywhere? 
---
And we wonder why customer support is shit lmaooo having to deal with this all day

With enough prayer you can fight him mage only with bind and protect from missiles. After a bind you can run and get off like two blast spells before running and binding again. It takes some getting used to the small timer on the bind, but it minimizes or eliminates melee hits and you just pray for the ranged ones. It also makes it more challenging and fun than just meleeing him. And you dont have to risk any rune armor. 
---
Jad spawns in the same spot as the gold mage on wave 62
---
Use the incinerator
---
Your stats are more than enough. The fact you can utilize tank gear only helps you too, and you have higher prayer. Biggest thing is experience. Watch a guide to learn the waves but then expect to do it at least once just to actually get the feel yourself. That first time really unlocks a ton of information for you and makes it much easier since memorizing everything from a video can be hard. 
---
Also you'll need to figure out your inventory setup from the first try. Dont worry if its not the same as the suggested - find what works for you. If you're running out of brews quicker than prayer, bring more brews. And vice verse. As for healers, since youre 70 def and can wear tank gear with blowpipe dont bother killing them. Just aggro them one at a time. At full hp with a brew + steel skin and your tank gear you shouldnt need to even worry about them damaging you. Just do them 1 at a time and dont get overwhelmed. That's the key part. 
---
Basically, aggro one healer then focus back on your prayer and jad and wait for the next attack/pray switch. Then repeat until you have all of them aggro. Then focus back on jad. Also during jad i recommend ONLY doing 1 tick per prayer flick..i.e; one sip of a brew then focus back on jad and wait, one pray pot then focus back, one attack to aggro healer etc etc. With blowpipe and addy darts you'll have it done easily. 
---
Also i recommend to rely on visuals vs sound. Visually you have more time to react IIRC vs the sound (not much but its more). Dont panic and double click prayer either, you have a solid second i believe after he does the animation to get your prayer on. Its also quite easy. Keep range pray up and brewed up at all times because you can tank a mage hit usually - but not a range. If he stomps down then keep range up and if his feet stay up in the air then turn mage on. Watch a video to get the idea! 
---
It definitely would be worth it. And I'm sure some of their hires involve some level of this, but again, finding someone to maintain and update a 20 year old engine (it doesn't matter that it's re-released, there's a lot of spaghetti still there) in a language as useless as RuneScript, is not easy. 
---
Especially as I've heard Jagex' pay isn't amazing, and Cambridge is expensive to live in. So it's only really a win if you truly love RS and wanted to improve it. Most Devs would go work on other projects that got them experience in current and relevant languages / systems
---
If they have the devs to make zeah and raids, they have the devs to migrate to an actual database.  Going by the responses in this thread they probably figure it‚Äôs not worth the money though, since idiots like you will suck their dick regardless

Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen

You must think all botters get banned too. Smh wake up

I know you said you didnt want to talk about it, but lets be real. If you have a terminal illness get the fuck off your computer and hang out with your parents/family.

U sound like a guy with an obby cape
---
Not weird, just unlucky. I'm sure you're not the first person to go that dry for a defender
---
Don't freak at jad, watch plenty of videos for help, don't freak if you get hit.  Got hit by his ranged but didn't lose focus so I was able to recover from it since I still had enough HP.
---
I forgive thee 
---
Did they give you 31 rc lvls? 
---
Oh man, can you imagine a 1 def pure with b gloves? 
---
It would be a little more work for them, but they absolutely could do it
---
I mean waiting for rng isn‚Äôt really a particularly meaningful challenge
---
Can you give the ring of brimstone the black mask effect when on slayer tasks?
---
imagine being a pet hunter lul
---
Kodai wand if you're barraging a bunch of monsters and ONLY barraging. Trident every other time, so if you're attacking a single target and barraging other shit in between kills, Trident is better.
---
rex is a chill way to pass a daganoth task and roll some potentially very profitable rng either way honestly, if you have the money just buy the ring but keep rex in mind when the task comes up 
---
Toxic is hardly worth it for profit until high slayer monsters. If anything you'll lose a lot of Gp using it , except jad use 
---
I appreciate your honesty
---
You are very welcome! I don't recommend void until dhcb or really high stats.
---
Make sure you're also using range and super Def pots.
---
I just got my dhcb from a tbow split, I'm really excited to try it out at vorkath
---
? :)
---
If I logged in and had your stats the last thing I would say is ‚Äúthis is fine‚Äù 
---
even if i were to agree to such things, it should be polled because the way they were to be nerfed should be thought out.

thanks!

It's basically justiciar with no negative attack bonuses. So you can basically sit on it the whole time, save 3-4 inventory slots on the switches, and never take any damage since basically all inferno damage you'd take is ranged, and crystal armor would have BIS ranged defence.
---
Sadly my levels don‚Äôt change lol, if only. Jogflix pls
---
CRAB BATTLE
---
Yes :(
---
Is cerebrus worth doing in main account for money? Kind of bored of demonic gorilas. Besides zulrah and vorkath any other fun bosses that can give me decent profit?
---
Youtube a guide, then a lot of practice.
---
A lot of people don't ToB because it's boring. It's the same 6 bosses in the same order over and over and over and over and over and over and over... CoX you at least get variety. Also, Olmlet + dust are more coveted than just lil verzik, so some of the cox streams are challenge mode streams.
---
Also ToB is a bit harder than CoX, so can be more frustrating. A single bad person on your team makes the raid much harder, so you need a team of people you can trust. With CoX, you can go with basically any number of people... ToB, it's basically exclusively 2-5, with 3 and 4 being by far the most common.
---
I actually love the time played suggestion per week. I've never read that anywhere but makes perfect sense.
---
Maybe weight votes based on avg play time/hr over the course of the week?
---
Makes no sense that tiny tim who logs on 10 minutes a week can get a big say in what happens in the game. Especially when tiny tim is actually just one of tims many alts...why should one person get more than one vote?!
---
Gg account
---
It was a joke, chill. people think just because I posted about this topic must think I dont grind. That is far from the case. 
---
Personally i think these recent mod fuckups and meme-fest are just a distraction from how the combat system (and many other stuff) are being changed unchecked and EoC is sneaking in the backdoor.
---
Like the twisted bow spawn, i think it was done on purpose as either a shady RWT move, or a distraction from something else. And other trivial things were deliberate fuck ups in order to show people they have "quality customer support"

Man these maxed 200m players live in a completely different world from the rest of us

Lmao I know everyone‚Äôs mentioning your bank and I had the same bank for the longest time so fucking messsy, 1 hour later all clean and it felt better and easier to navigate, it‚Äôs definitely worth it. It‚Äôs starting to get messy again tho hmmm 
---
Who are you? 
---
Yup. It's the promised land
---
Nice. Congrats on the 99. How much WC exp did you get doing this?
---
This happened to me as well, several times in one session, all while doing CoX. It fixed itself as time went on, I didn‚Äôt have to relog or anything. It happened to people I was raiding with as well, as soon as I mentioned it which was quite a coincidence. 
---
does the nightmare zone thing still works where you get to 1 hp and take max 1 damage? and what is the best way to do it? because the one video guide i saw was like a year old and the comments were saying things that made it sound like the video should have mentioned things it didn't. (what those things are i'm not sure)
---
They didn‚Äôt actually fuck up accounts that were clearly not pures and then reward them with 70m def xp, did they?

Press the backpack button on the runelite sidebar. May need to turn tracker on on settings.

You can see pill results without even voting. It means that people are heavily swayed by how others have voted.
---
No do NOT do that. People, like myself, use it to organize inventory spots without our mouses accidentally eating shit. 
---
I agreed with the integrity changes. I liked using the mechanics as they where and was kinda upset I didn't get to abuse them as much as I wanted but I think they needed to happen and no one was voting yes to do it. 
---
Keiren is a spot on mod in my opinion, behind mod Ash. I like his push for making things harder and adding new mechanics. I like we use more tick abuse mechanics and knowledge to push real skill level rather than adding more devistating things to the game like soul split and overloads. I think just cause he spoke on those integrity issues on stream doesn't mean it wasn't reflective of the other mods or a lot of the community. 
---
Ironically I think it is a possibility that Morytania becomes home to the real Blood Altar in a future update, as the lore behind the Zeah altars in that they are just conduits and the real altars are still hidden. 
---
Nah that's too intense for me man.

Thanks man, best of luck to you too. I got a lucky berserker ring at 38kc, what a coincidence. I have 2 berserkers, and the axe at 99kc. Hopefully won't be dry too much longer for pet.

Check your email that‚Äôs associated with your account and check the block list. I almost wasn‚Äôt able to recover my Ironman with a 110m+ bank in time but I checked the block list and saw a few jagex associated email addresses were on there from when my email was hacked.

so lets talk about what we know about. Nobody accessed my email. End of discussed i have SMS verification and can see all recent activities on it. It was and is secure.

ran about 12 different sweeps on my comp looked everywhere possible anything could have been and havent found anything.

seriously get the cape and try to get b gloves!

there is a setting for public chat called "hide". you're not on that setting, are you?
---
The game was very active during my beginning years, over 150k any given day.. alot of people still played, even ones who started in 07 even before that. And it wasnt very different from what it is now, it was different but not drastically different, rs3 is drastically different then osrs!
---
No u

Would you rather rack up the 1.6m for a new black mask and slayer points or 800k NMZ points? Personally I‚Äôd rather the NMZ points.

This is what I came here to say, I've even seen the GE looters wait for someone's molten glass to appear (they were using giant seaweed for glassmake).

Very nice customer support.

You gonna die on ur hcim before you reach that point. Just keep playing your old acc

No cuz its in the IOS not something jagex can do anything about

If they wanted to manipulate it, they can take all the votes that come in, and add additional votes to change the outcome. They can simply cite the recent increase in player numbers due to mobile finally being able to vote.
---
Is there any point in using compost on a tree patch if im paying the farmer to watch it?
---
No offence but whats the point of this post? With those items and decent stats you can do it eventually. Just give it ago instead of asking random people if you will be able to do it?
---
no
---
The compost will reduce the chance of a tree dying significantly, but there will still be a chance.

Maybe if everyone stopped dogging them in every comment reply about issues their upper management probably told them not to address they would be more inclined to interact here. Seriously, in light hearted threads there always someone attacking a jmod that doesn't even relate to the issues everyone is having. 
---
Is there any chance you could act upon many off the issues regarding account security the community have asked several times before and you've either ignored or palmed it off. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Authentication, Your 2fa is a joke and everyone knows it. Why is mobile 2fa not a thing?  Why is there not a delay on the removal off your auth? 
---
You've had a data breach by an employee and you've not acted upon the accounts getting hacked daily?  Isn't this a concern or is it a IPO form sort of concern if you're not willing to act accordingly since people can falsely gain access to your account which can and has data stored in plain text.  Also, can you not confirm our information to rogue entities trying to access accounts, you know ones on IPv4 proxy's and VPNs.
---
The community voted to keep the poll results visible. Stop trying to subvert the will of the community you circlejerking autists.

Im not 100% sure cause i ditched apple products a couple years ago but i believe initially you could only make an osrs account on iphone through gamecentre so it may have automatically made a character as gamecentre was always logged in and connected

Account question:
---
I started playing again recently after not playing for a few years. Made a new account as I have in the past - this is now my fourth account. I decided I would see what my other accounts had/move it over to this account. Seemed to be okay to do such as far as I could tell from the rules.
---
The last account I tried to log into was banned. Will the act of logging into this banned account from the same computer get my other accounts banned? Should I just give up and walk away and leave my loss at the $80 I dropped on a premier membership, before sinking more time into it?
---
Investing in construction is the #1 best thing to do in this game. House tele + ornate pool + jewellery box + portals + fairy ring are ridiculously over powered. It's almost sad really - I do not navigate the many landscapes of Gielinor anymore. Anytime I want to get somewhere, it is almost always faster/more advantageous to tele to home, top off all stats within 1 second, and then use some build-in tele to get to where I need to go.
---
Everyone is a germ. 
---
There are plenty of monsters down there that are decent for xp and gp, it is a cool place to explore when starting off. You can get 10,000coins if you reach all three chest but it gets dangerous so be careful, also a chest in the lowest level that will give you special boots.
---
Feels bad that i got it on 6 on my main... gz tho
---
Aussie GE is great but we're getting a lot of beggars and shit these days. I make sure to tell each one to fuck off.
---
Nah this is bad. I guess the idea is "cool" like you put it but just because its cool doesnt mean it adds anything to the game. Getting bars back from smithing essentially means a straight buff to smithing and mining... unless you propose a cost to return the items into bars. But at that point, whats the point?
---
I also thought I heard something a while back about being able to use certain tree seeds on the farming pet to make it look slightly like that tree.
---
It might have just been a rumor, but I‚Äôd really like to see that as well.
---
A gold bar in metallic would look pretty great, but yeah man, you work with what you've got. And honestly besides that, it's not really hard to repaint later if you want to give both variants a try if you find some better metallic gold paint later.

I agree for the most part, but when you start drawing lines like that you‚Äôve gotta figure out where to draw the line. Not to mention the inevitable backlash from it. 
---
Runecrafting = big gay

Ah I thought that‚Äôs what it was but couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Thanks.

It‚Äôs nuts out here bro! 
---
It's a meme, dude.
---
You also wouldn't know if they're fixing the polls. And any lesser amount of transparency doesn't give us any benefits.

I think the drama from not seeing them outweighs any benefit they could have.

if it was a scheduled once a day thing then I'd recommend an hour shift. I think Jagex is GMT so say April 1st is GMT 0 then April 2nd would be GMT+1 or -1.

Which spec weapon should I use for mole? Right now I'm using DDS and avernic.

Well now you don't have to choose between bringing rune gloves cause you don't want pkers to get anymore gp, or your one pair of barrows gloves you don't want to buy more of.

Is it a good idea to use elite scrolls as a guide to progress your account?

That‚Äôs probably why, but it‚Äôs more likely that it was because of the serp helm buff

If you would only get the chance when getting the actual drop I feel this is a good idea
---
yes thats normal.
---
Wait a minute why not a Tesla?
---
&gt; is there a high skilling requirement of any kind?  
---
Yes and no. Having elite void is very, very good which requires a few skills (mostnotably 69 hunter, 70 mining, 68 farming, 65 construction, 75 thieving, all of which I'm pretty sure can be boosted). Other than that, not really. 90+ melee/range, 94+ mage, 70++ prayer (77 with rig+aug highly recommended).
---
&gt; Do you need BiS gear to get into it? 
---
Not at all. Elite void (all 3 helms), fury, dragon boots, trident, occult, dragon defender, BGS, tentacle whip, blowpipe, assembler, crystal halberd, and a rune pouch are enough to get you started (\~30m in gear). It's actually cheaper gear wise to start into than CoX.
---
The thing about ToB... Learning it is rough. I mean, really rough. Unless you have some friends that can carry you outta low KC, then the teams you find at 0-10 kc will have a 90%++ failure rate. Also, once you get past the new content feel, it's pretty boring. It's always the same bosses, basically always the same fights, and just a huge grind. Compare that to something like CoX where you at least get different rotations, and it's fairly lack-luster. Also, one bad person on your team can cause you to have an extremely hard raid or even wipe (which means starting over + paying 100k to get your stuff back), where CoX one bad person on your team just means less points at the end. 
---
it's a game, taking it seriously is entirely at your own discretion.  If its that important to you, there are a variety of technical solutions that would prevent almost all disconnects and ultimately people are lazy and want to vlame someone else when they knoe they've made a mistake.
---
the poll to hide poll results failed tho
---
gl finding new job!
---
fix the clan chat bug and remove spec timers from single combat wildy
---
Sure pm me your username and password and ill see what i can do.
---
the point is that you can't.
---
i agree people didnt like it before, but why is that a bad thing? there can be parts of the game people dont like. no one was forcing you to do it, whats wrong with just ignoring it if you didnt enjoy it?
---
I never paid anyone for KC. You can learn in low KC teams just fine, and chances are you'll be better for it (Won't get out of low KC til you're good enough to carry yourself out, versus buying/getting carried out then planking with regular teams because suddenly you're  expected to carry your own weight.
---
Nope, just stupidly quick. 
---
Well same with the others...
---
there have been weekly updates since runescape launches almost without exception small ones, big ones, bug fixes, bug additions. this is one of the fundamentals of RuneScape is that it's always getting updates. something many modern games struggle with to this day.
---
1.2k for first shard. 600 is not even bad.
---
Deal
---
Didnt even notice that lololol wow
---
I think it's a mixture of a few things:
---
- Heavy reliance on prayer flicking, if you don't know how to do this you're gonna get destroyed
---
- Neglect from jagex, no updates for a few years now 
---
- No rewards/benefits, not even cosmetics  
---
- Generally people are more efficiency-focused on their accounts, minigames in general don't attract large activity in OSRS
---
- Can be very frustrating to play, often times you can play well but lose if your opponent decides to grief 
---
I really want to like this serious but your commentary could really use some work in my opinion.  The cringy jokes from episode 1 and the rambling on and on about how wishing you luck won't do anything because by the time we see it the video is already out is really horrendous imo.  I'm not trying to be super negative but I think you could improve on your commentary a lot.  You have some extremely awkward moments and it forces me to skip through huge chunks of the video or just stop watching.
---
He does use f keys. Sometimes on stream he fucks about and doesn't use them and still flawlessly makes all his prayers/1 tick barrages 
---
do what u want. But learn to use wiki, it shows all the items in the game + guides you need.
---
also - there are 2 wikis. The "fandom" one is old and people put misinformation there now. Use only the one u can get link from Oldschool Runescape homepage.
---
It means you're dumb. Give me my 500m now. 
---
I don't see OP replying to any of the comments hmm
---
they've been saying stuff for years about fixing it but haven't actually made any progress ib a while.
---
Has anyone hit a 98-98 before? 
---
the fact that you're so willing to give away something you work for, whether it be on an online game or not, to some random dick on the internet who looks rich, kind of makes you the ass hole too..

Imagine be so retarded you actually withdraw your entire cash stack on a PvP world. Just imagine.

Because the LMS winner killed everybody off, and as the last man standing he can't start a new game alone.

Theres no high skill requirement other than combat, 94 mage is a must have, but i would really suggest max combat, otherwise oyu make it harder for yourself than it already is. As the other dudes already said, when starting of noone will take you except for other low kcers, which almost always Ends up in a huge mess since noone knows what hes doing. You can either pay for kc or go with streamers who host learner raids/ join the we do raids discord and ask Mentors there. I really wouldnt suggest paying for kc since you literally dont learn anything in These raids and you are just as bad with 20kc as with 0, which Ends up in your future teammates hating you. I think most of the People raiding in W416 got there first few kc through the streamer "Lettulainen" who does learner raids almost every day all day for free.

I dont think you Need to start cox before tob since you dont learn anything in cox which can be applied to tob

What is the point of this if you aren‚Äôt praying? I don‚Äôt pvp but I thought the point of doing switches like this was to hit with a different style before they change prayer
---
For humor.

Badumtss

Big fuckin difference between difficulties. No one with a max cape would have problem optaining firecape, inferno on the other hand is made so even alot of max players cant complete it.
---
C Engineers series is much more entertaining IMO and will last longer unless he is killed which is still very possible. I think swampletics is overhyped as shit as well and honestly don't understand where it comes from though I do enjoy his series quite a bit.
---
I mean they‚Äôre not wrong, slayer is quicker with better stats. Heck, anything is more efficient with better stats. 
---
The issue is that you can train combat through slayer. I hit 80 base stats when I hit 80 slayer
---
Fuuuuuuuuuck
---
Yeah this
---
Yeah but consider how much he plays. I don't think he has studies, gf/bf or a job. Although I guess youtube is his job now. My point is that he can play a lot.
---
Wait. So smithing irl isn't shoving your arms straight into the oven?
---
&gt; Just don't buy it lol?

If only addictions worked like that...

‚ÄúHow difficult the content is‚Äù is an absolutely terrible basis for deciding whether something gets a max cape variant or not.

Look, we're all feeling nostalgic about 2007 Runescape but that doesn't mean you have to roleplay a 12 year old.

**Can there be a Metamorphosis option added to the TzRek-Jad pet to allow it to transmog into JalRek-Jad (the Inferno version)? The option would likely be locked behind completing the Inferno. See image:**

99 mage is only about 1,000,000 casts of fire strike. Not saying this person did it that way but it means that even at vendor prices for runes if you wanted to go for 99 mage and had unlimited time at your disposal you can get it as cheap as about 10-15 million total GP.
---
Depending on what OP might have been trying to mage casting 1 million fire strikes may have happened. Or more like 80-150k total fire strike casts then collect enough nature runes/other runes to finish off the last 7-10 million xp.

I legitimately had to hop while doing crafting on my iron cause a level 80 or 90 was sitting under me for like 15+ minutes instantly picking up all of my molten glass that appeared. I was at a random bank too, not even the GE.

There is no "right thing".

I was just talking about this with my friend a few days ago! I so wish the Keris could be some sort of BiS dagger for some sort of niche use, it looks so cool but as it is rn its so useless.

You need 70 def for piety.

You saw an opportunity and you used it!

And my first post said:

&gt;	It‚Äôs literally impossible to beat RFD without completing MM.
---
So I don‚Äôt understand where your response proves otherwise. It‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm referring to natural progression and not a bug that is apparently once in a games lifetime. Naturally progressing, it *is* impossible to beat RFD without MM. Your original post made it sound like anyone can go do it willy nilly.

Just play Destiny 2 and pretend you're in the Cosmo drone when going to the EDZ. :D

Good idea, thank you!

I didn‚Äôt realise her magic could be used that way...
---
Yeah I know, making it bis for only kalphite queen or bugs, makes it more niche when they bring out more content, just like the arc light 
---
its 1/2209 if you have 100%accuracy.
---
On Rune you have like 20% accuracy or so with a dds.
---
So its 0.2 √ó 0.2 / 47 /47 = 1/55k (For 46x46).
---
One could calculate the accuracy on different gear setups but dds accuracy is real shit.
---
I used to think if I picked up any stackable item and used Cheat Engine to change the stack size, i was really duplicating items xD

Yep. Deluding themselves into thinking its as prestigious as it used to be.

No thanks. Sounds very stupid.

This is not true. A lot of the people who were reset to 1 Def stated they were able to wear them.

In my opinion c engineer milks his videos and outs a whole lot less effort in than settled does. Settled is striving for quality c engineer is striving for more views. But ironicly because of that settled is far more succesfull.
---
One example to make my point. C engineer is dry at barrows and I get it, it's demotivating (I've been there). But he gives up easily. While settled would put in the time &amp; effort no matter what. He also keeps his integrity look at how he will handle the bog.

Runescape is a true RPG. That's the beauty of it. You get to choose what you want and don't want to do. Everyone's path is different. Everyone has fun doing different things. It's all about finding what you like and what you have fun doing.
---
If that's figuring out puzzles in quests, or grinding, or bank standing, or focusing on max efficiency, or pvming, trying to max, making friends, or just casually grinding to pass time, or just wanting to get a sense of accomplishment from completing a goal, it doesn't matter. If you're having fun you're playing it right. Nobody can tell you otherwise.
---
God yes!

all those things you mentioned are memes easy for people to circlejerk. these posts arent so they probably view them as pointless clutter.

I'm not saying I agree with it I'm just giving my opinion on why people probably have a problem with it. but sure get defensive

Haha
---
It varies so widely, from a 1.19b TBow to a 5m Arcane Prayer Scroll. There is no real "average" drop value. If you look at historical averages, doing 3(or 4)+1s you should average 2.5-3m per raid, heavily dependent on TBow drop(s).

rip.

Ok now this is actually an interesting 1st fire cape attempt for once.

I see both side here but the fact thag the max fire cape is already in game, why remove it? Its at least got more challenge behind it than buying a team cape from a vendor or GE.
---
Basically same concept, except with much much more money being lured.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y43DIVE8Wo

How often were you playing? I really only have time to play on mobile and I‚Äôve never had mining 99 so I‚Äôd like to grind it out

what

If you are failing all your classes, you shouldnt be in college yeah. Gz on 99 tho.
---
Oh I didnt know. No need to downvote.

#WHAT HAPPENED
---
The boost in player numbers would be just like mobile, that's why it would be beneficial to Jagex. For the money, since it is a free game, there would be no charges Steam could take the 30% from. Membership and bonds would come from Jagex's home site alone.

You fuck over pures at least people have main accounts to fall back on. When you fuck over main accounts that's it, that is the account they play on most. They will 100% expect a fix asap or they aren't going to play. If you let a main account not play for 2-3 weeks or more you very likely lost them as a member for at least a few months.
---
There are a lot of amazing video games out there right now with many good releases coming out over the next several weeks, it'd be foolish to not address this and do your best to keep your customers happy.

I don‚Äôt agree with you since he was pretty stern on not wanting to see them, I know that I would never want to see my father on my way out. However, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be playing the game, it‚Äôs such a useless game in comparison to what you could spend time on.

10m
---
Good to have a mix of both imo. Only do fun stuff and you'll never progress your account. Only grind and you won't have as much fun. I grind most the time and take breaks with revs and clue scrolls. Both I do for fun and not for the rewards or efficiency.
---
High effort. Low quality. Nice.

So i'm ready to be trod on for weeks. It's been a long time since I was any good at hybridding, think 2010 era of rs2 was peak for me. This'll be interesting!

Ah yeah youre right. It's suppose to be 2 experience multiplied by your average hit which would be max hit / 2 but that simplifies just to max hit.
---
First in line for agilty. 
---
why isn't the amulet of strength more widely used over the fury? it has 2 more strength bonus?
---
i know about the prayer bonus, but in cases where i don't plan on using prayer (Slayer) a strength amulet is better than a fury right?
---
That's a crazy statistic partly since there's a load of rc bots.

imagine getting upset over something so dumb

Congrats! Did it myself last week and it was honestly the most fun and enjoyable quest Ive done in whatever game Ive ever played :) I really enjoyed it! I wish I could forget it and do it again from scratch hehe. Way more fun doing this one without a guide than MEP2 I tell you that (:
---
Agree with this. 
---
Just saying watching a video of him doing the exact same things isnt very entertaining. Its always the same we know the drop tables.
---
Damn didnt expect the man himself replying to me. ;) Thanks for taking your time.
---
Then its amazing exposure for the game, which I am thankful for. This also explains part of the circlejerking worship of you which has become a plague. Every other snowflake creator is basically living in your shadow these days. 
---
How do you plan on doing ToB without leeching? Are you gonna have a team that just picks identical gear to you? Genuinely curious. Also how are you gonna keep it interesting now when its basically just Temple trekking and barrows content ?
---
A q p
---
     U
---
More or less the same as it used to be to be honest
---
1. In terms of skills, most of the old training methods are either still the best methods or are at least still viable with the exception of some skills, for example firemaking got a new boss which kind of makes any other training method irrelevant. 
---
2. In terms of gear, OSRS does a good job of making sure that when new items or content come out it doesn't immediately make everything else dead content which is a problem with a lot of MMO's, for example barrows items still have their uses for specific bosses or training methods despite being 'mid level gear' (for example Veracs for wildy bosses or KQ, Dharoks for Giant Mole or NMZ training, Ahrims and Karils for Zulrah etc.)
---
3. In terms of ways to make money, if you are very high combat level PVM bossing offers the best ¬£/hour, Vorkath and Zulrah are two 'new' bosses which are very popular for cash. But lots of the old methods still work, there are dozens of ways to make 500k/hour+ with or without combat, provided your skills are high for example you can make 450-500k/hour mining rune if you have the mining level. 
---
The main difference between now and 2017-10 is that almost all of the 'best in slot' items now come from either high level bosses or the raids which are all new content.
---
How are you "thousands of hours away"? If you've been playing since 2014 you should have 65 farming already for over 70% of the farming guild. Getting to slayer bosses is a grind no matter what, you doing it on a trade account should still be slower then grinding it out from where you are now.
---
If you are under 1,000 total levels then I'd say your a casual scrub who just needs to play more. Playing on a trade account doesn't make grinds like slayer necessarily any faster.
---
And still how after 5 years of playing this account are you still not accessing some of this stuff. Like I feel your issue is that you don't play OSRS to its maximum potential, de-ironing isn't going to make you play the game like a God all the sudden. You'll still be a noob, except now you need to grind GP for a year straight to afford things on the ge that make using the GE worth it.
---
I just don't think your problem is that your an ironman, your problem is your a casual. Fix being a casual first, then reconsider de-ironing, but not before.
---
What the fuck is that even supposed to mean 
---
Thanks for the response thats super useful. Runelite definitely sounds good I'll give that a go. Any suggestions on where to start to get the best all around experience to get me back into the swing of things? Probably looking for the more passive style of play to start with so I can read guides and what not while still getting stuff done in game. 
---
So? Even cooler then
---
Inte egentligen men pakkoruotsi vittun.
---
Then how can you expect to do things that require you to play all day? You've had 5 years to get your shit together. 5 years a casual player can easily get 2k+ total. If you don't believe me just look at this subreddit, people say they have gotten 1700+ total level mobile only and that's barely been out for 2 years.(Officially mobile has only been out for 6 months)
---
If someone can get 1700+ total level in under a year but you still predict you are "thousands of hours" away from even basic bitch shit like the farming guild, you are a casual. As a casual you don't get to do things that require you to play all day.
---
De-ironing isn't going to fix you being a casual.
---
So like everyone in a professional kitchen?
---
to get defenders you need to kill cyclopes in the warriors guild, to get to them you need those tokens. to get those tokens you reanimate an armour set and kill it and you get the armour set and tokens back. the joke is he's getting an armour set everytime he kills one so it looks like hes making money when in reality he spent an armour set to get one back
---
I think this is one of the major draws of OSRS. You can set goals, find the best way to achieve them, and literally see every bit of progress you make. In real life progress isn't so obvious and goals can be hard to define.

---
History repeated itself
---
I returned from a hiatus too, been playing an account that I started a month before the mobile OSRS began. I have paid for membership the whole time. 
---
When I returned, the largest change I noticed was the huge increase of content. I remember the great brain robbery being the latest quest before quitting RS for the first time. When I returned last year the giant island to the west came completely by surprise. There is a team at Jagex dedicated to frequently updating OSRS and fixing (and recently creating) bugs in the game.
---
Skills and the value of old items are as I remember them. I decided to play an Ultimate Ironman account, a game mode new to me that restricts you from trading or using the bank. I am playing the quests in the optimal order so that the skill experience rewards lessen the amount of grinding I need to do (and time needed to get levels). The OSRS wiki features a list that orders the quests in such a way, as well as information and guides for skilling and acquiring items should you need them. There are more mini games than I  remember too which make getting items, experience and gold more enjoyable.
---
fan-fucking-tastic meme sir
---
Thanks for this, exactly what I was looking for. Sounds look it shouldn't be overly difficult to pick everything back up after a bit of time
---
Oh now i get it! Appreciate it!
---
Cause when you're not dying you still have to live with the consequences of your actions. That's like life 101, you can do whatever you want but you have to live with the consequences of your actions.
---
So, what you‚Äôre telling me is, last year never happened. Jagex has never had a security issue or corrupt mods, thieves, etc...
---
The fault MUST be mine it‚Äôs an impossibility that something similar happened.
---
The facts are:
---
There‚Äôs nothing on my PC;I‚Äôve never streamed my PIN; and I‚Äôve never let anyone on my account.
---
Furthermore, you would have to be a real dumb shit to think I gave away 4-5 years for $1-2k. I could see it if like 1B disappeared and it was as simple as me just tbowing everything to death again but it‚Äôs my damn IRONMAN that I stream on. 
---
The JMODs really have all these retards brainwashed into the fact that they do no wrong and it‚Äôs amazing with all the shady shit they do.

No thanks. Doesn't look great, and we don't need any  more cosmetic/random items in the game.
---
20m a week on an Ironman is easily worth paying you would make that a day if left alone ? 
---
It would depend if you calculate it on the average value of combined drops or the weighted likelyhood of a drop. Arcane scroll is way more common than tbow, so it will heavily skew the valur

The point is that this kind of thing should not be happening in this game. It is an open world MMO where everything should be available to anyone as long as they are willing to get there. 
---
Have you tried out using a trackball? They're actually really intuitive to use and is still good for gaming (be it clicking in runescape or in another MMO, or in an FPS). I'm personally using a Kensington Expert currently and I'm liking it a lot. There are a lot of different types of trackballs, so try do some research. Also /r/Trackballs
---
Another thing that you should consider is getting an ergonomic/split keyboard which reduces the strain on your arms and wrists. Although this also depends on your posture and elevation compared to the surface of your keyboard. /r/MechanicalKeyboards might have resources that can help.
---
Other things that might help are start using keybinds and mousekeys more often/effectively.
---
Yeah and it's really ridiculous.
---
It's too bad. It was polled and completely failed.
---
Just because people on Reddit are throwing a tempertantrum doesn't mean they should implement it.

Its scummy as fuck but IDK if it should be against the rules, especially since it would be a lot of effort to investigate. 
---
\*anything useful.

What some people dont understand is, [why Jagex specifically asked for failed poll questions which they would re-poll, but completely ignored the most-upvoted question about hiding poll results.](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/apgnxz/qol_month_week_3_reruns/eg83wqp/)

Come on atleast download the actual RS font.

Amulet if Accuracy? No? Ok.
---
You clearly haven't watched any of the series. That or you're just being a dick.
---
Not sure on the design but I like the idea, one upvote from me 
---
Point is +4 accuracy isn‚Äôt much of a buff if your talking f2p where magic out dps range easily 
---
Read your other reply to u/Juddftw, when you don't have the runes necessary to cast a spell, it'll disable it. So unless you put on the tome of fire first and then your iban's staff, it should remember it.
---
otherwise, if you equip your iban's staff first, your spell realises it doesn't have any fire runes, so it cancels remembering it.
---
i got roughly 80 via cballs while holding the bond, until i came to sense and i just bought the gold premier once it came.
---
&gt; the majority have requested hiding poll results for over a year... Why won't they do it?
---
Because autists spamming Reddit is not he majority.
---
They've already polled this and it failed. 
---
Yeah the scam thing is true and I agree with you but can‚Äôt see any possible solution to it

I edited it on my phone and plus I just found it funny like that

It's a shame we don't get more input in the actual development process, this could have been avoided
---
dusk is the best looking set hands down.

I don‚Äôt get how this would happen. All they would need to do is cancel the existing order you have created and create a new order for the same item at 5% higher gp. It‚Äôs taking 6 steps and running them in the normal order, but doing it for you to save a ton of time.

Wintertodts damage scaling is currently a big issue as it punishes non 10hp accounts. Would the ability to charge the bruma torch with gp at an NPC or some consumable in order to lower the damage to what a 10hp account takes be acceptable? That way there is still an economic sink as well as players requiring a wintertodts related drop to mitigate the damage.

Lucky boy, took me around 400 which I‚Äôd say is pretty average
---
How do you organize your bank? What tabs do you have? Mine is complete shit and would probably take an hour to organize.
---
There is still a lot of OSRS I haven't tried yet such as the nightmare zone, most of the bosses, gaining favour in a few of the houses in great Kourend etc... I believe the best attitude to have whilst playing is to keep an eye open for interesting places and NPCs and just explore. If you see players with cool gear, ask them about it. I've done this many times and never experienced a player who didn't jump at the opportunity to talk about cool gear they worked for. 
---
The rate at which experience is gained means it will take a very long time before coming across a new method or hearing about a quest that will help before reaching level 99 in said skill. Unless you deliberately ignore all the other content around you, fortune favours the bold and all that.
---
There is a deep rabbit hole of OSRS tip videos on YouTube too.
---
 I find the clan chats overwhelming. I'm a purest in the sense that any friends I make online are formed naturally rather than joining a group of people, but each to their own. I have a small list of people I sometimes ask questions  or just talk with. PM me and I'll tell you my username. I play a few hours a day and am always happy to chat or answer questions while online.
---
Were you watching a YouTube video?
---
Yep, and now my dad and older sister think Runescape causes viruses when you play it.
---
You don't have to get multiple cakes. Even when cooled, attempting to eat the cake will hurt you without removing the cake from your inventory.
---
I hope my level 3 has his defense maxed
---
Ah yes, dungeoneering. The only thing rs3 has over osrs. Man I would really want that skill in osrs but we have raids which isn‚Äôt too different
---
Your entire post is complaining about not being able to print money at revs. That's what you care about. You don't care about the rwting.
---
Sucks. Use a different world. Nobody cares that you can't print money in multi wildy with your ironman. Emergent player behavior like this shouldn't be changed just because some people don't benefit. It's the wildy. The game would be boring if everything was catered towards everyone.
---
authenticator is needed to login the website thats all they have to add this stops 99% of the databreach hacking it's that simple having a delay on removing something isn't magicly going to make it better.
---
I couldn't stop fucking laughing at this for some reason
---
I personally afked max cape doing some of the most inefficient methods, and when I got it I just switched my attention to a new ironman account, while I kept afking money/pet hunting on the main.
---
I like C engineer‚Äôs personality. However his series is lacking. It needs more content. When I finish an episode I‚Äôm not satisfied. Idk it‚Äôs good but not impressive. 
---
Can you use swamp tar(I have a bunch in my bank from cave slime taskes) with salamanders.
---
I wouldn't say they're entirely wrong. I did untrimmed slayer and I was about 9mil xp short of max melee when I hit 99 slayer.
---
I could easily see someone starting 85-90 melees and hitting 99 in all 4 stats at the same time.
---
I think membership covers both games, so if you're already a member and play osrs there's nothing stopping you from playing otherscape. 
---
Look up Spongeknot Squarents
---
Too early to tell. Anyone who is a firm yes/no at this point, has no real reasoning
---
Try https://www.reddit.com/r/BankTabs/ for some ideas. I have a tab for combat, magic, tools, food/farming, potions/herbs, and treasure trail rewards/cosmetic items.
---
Oh, nice. Thanks!

Nah

If the clan is big enough and they do it consistently, I dress up similar to them so they would think I‚Äôm in their clan. Works 80% of the time.
---
Sounds like a lure, dont fall for it, hes gonna take youe gp
---
8=D
---
Utilizing the entire OSRS map is also better than using one section of swamp but sometimes its fun to limit your account and see what you can achieve.
---
What world? I could use this
---
Depending on what you wanna spend, construction is expensive but very worth it

Nah for some people immediately after the update xp gain wasn't correct based off the selected attack style, they'd gain attack even on aggressive. 
---
This right here. I enjoy wasting my life on runescape right now. But if I was told I have two weeks? I'm maxing my credit card doing dumb shit like skydiving or renting a supercar and just ripping it around. Fuck it. 
---
You have to combine it with herbs first. Use it with guam, marrentill, tarromin, or harralander to use it with green, orange, red, and black salamanders respectively.
---
Gzzz!

dunno if you‚Äôre trolling or just kinda slow but i linked you pretty solid evidence the last time you said this about the dude and you still type this shit

remove the tinfoil hat bro, he streams a lot and you can hear him click in sync with his mouse on screen etc.
---
Let‚Äôs rename some robes that look exactly like mystic. Lmao what a lad this one.
---
Yep. Players enter their password on sketchy websites, RWT, and don't set bank pins...but obviously the main reason they got hacked is due to Jagex not implementing the auth removal delay.
---
Remember to hide your name buddy boy, run energy too. 
---
You don‚Äôt care about the RWT. You just care about having your time there cut short so you couldn‚Äôt make the money yourself. 
---
We should just stop touching items that already exist. Hell, the game has lasted like 20 years without an amy of ranged, I'm sure it will be ok without one.
---
Yeah, this doesn't actually allow you to chain quests together though efficiently. This just lists them out one by one.
---
Looking for a guide that shows how to chain them together, as in, how to grab multiple items in certain towns for optimal time spent to get multiple quests done at one time.
---
A quest that is partialy in multi, nty. 
---
Your argument about RWT is irrelevant. Stakers sell a lot more gold than Rev killers. 
---
It‚Äôs the wilderness. Clans being able to hold down worlds is kind of impressive. Paying for protection is not necessary at all. 
---
Dying is part of it. You can‚Äôt expect to live. 
---
You should always come out on top making a profit at the end of the day even if you die. 
---
You risk barely anything tbh. 
---
99 crafting allows you to teleport to the crafting guild bank, pretty much the most useful 99 skillcape perk in my opinion
---
Was having a discussion about the Twisted Bow last night. 
---
Was going over a what-if Scenario if Nex were to eventually be released in one form or another.
---
Bow and Blowpipe would be meta there as well. 
---
Pipe the minions, unload D claws on Blood phase and hammer away with Tbow the other 90% of the fight. 
---
Chances are we will never see Nex but food for thought nonetheless. 
---
found it thanks 
---
I mean C Engineer probably plays like 30 hours a week and Settled plays probably close to 80 hours a week. Big difference in terms of content/''gives up easily''
---
this is some straight bullshit you would hear from some of the most radical recruiters of ISIS to start making you "think".
---
radical Islam rose due to ruthless selfish behavior of the west in islamic states. To say those actions are against muslims themselves is simply a lie. Only purpose of this behaviour was economically but not to defame the muslim religion.
---
I got it at 60 agility but a lot of people got it sooner, Canafis drops A LOT of marks so you want to stay there for a while, completely ignore the Falador course until you get enough, it sucks
---
Yeah, I knew about this, just was curious if there was a guide out there that showed how to chain them together more than just doing them one at a time, as I know many quests make you go to the same cities/towns and areas in RS and I keep thinking "dang if I would have known I would have had to have gone back here on my next quest I would have started them both and got them both done a lot quicker"
---
In that case, change the password because the "hijacker" cant do shit without the auth.
---
thanks! thats a good idea. I should mention that the RSI is near my elbow so its kinda like a "tennis arm" but I think a mobile/ipad might be my best shot.
---
No, for some reason I have this weird thing where I have to make my username in MMOs actually be a full semi-realistic name or I feel weird about it
---
I tried on my iphone but I hate how small it is, having said that an Ipad might be a really good idea!
---
Thanks for the help.
---
You must be new to this game... 80 hours is child‚Äôs play 
---
thanks for all the suggetions! currently I already use a vertical mouse but ill look into it some more.
---
To be honest, xp is tracked to .1 decimals, so the source they took the number from probably showed 76m, but the tool which they gave xp in probably didn't use the decimal.. Still funny af
---
Runecrafting, it sucks but when you get more milestones it feels so much more rewarding and you make decent money too, I‚Äôd much prefer to repetitive abyss grind than doing Runespan.
---
I did Wildy course because I wanted Morty hards.
---
71 agility and still don't have full graceful.
---
Runespan was one of the first things I did when I tried out rs3 recently, got all the way to 80 rc. Rs3 truly is ez-scape
---
Farm t10s idk get good rly 
---
Singed main here
---
now that i think of it.. Wouldnt it be more likely to hit a 46-47 instead of a 46-46 since you're able to hit 46-47 and 47-46 thus doubling ur chances or does the dds not roll like that?
---
You still spent the time there because it was much more enjoyable and afk compared normal rcing regardless if it was easy if you've played any other mmo both games are easy just one is more time consuming. My main is on osrs but I don't mind either game I also enjoy ironman on rs3. 
---
And i'm over here strugglin to afford a bond jeez
---
People are generally happy with the game, reddit is just full of autistic kids who don‚Äôt understand and takes memes too seriously. 
---
How do we know this?
---
Easiest most AFK way I‚Äôve been doing it is bring full Dharoks, drink an overload, drink a hit of absorption or 2. Then guzzle a DWARVEN rock cake (from RFD, not the ogre ones from south of castle wars).  Once you‚Äôre down to 1 hp absorption pot up to 1000 and sit in a corner. You can pray flick to stop hp restore if you want, but it‚Äôs way more Afk to just guzzle the rock cake every now and then.
---
Make sure you have a ton of bosses enabled. There are good guides on which bosses to block but the more you have enabled the better.
---
Also, doing dream mentor and enabling those bosses will triple the points you get. It‚Äôs insane, so go do that lol.
---
Same fucking issue. How the hell do I log in?
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
I would argue adding cool things for the sake of adding them or adding things that trump the meta just for the sake of substance is what will kill the game. How can you compare this suggestion to raids?
---
This post is pointless without proof of there being RWT. Because everything else you‚Äôve listed is fair game and within the rules, except for RWT.

Where's the dinner at?

Is a down vote not good enough for you?
---
Yea it‚Äôs the best for strength for its price, pretty good at Slayer too
---
Original looks better and fine at that, doesn‚Äôt need an ornament kit 
---
They are chemical in nature according to their in-game message when you use them. ‚ÄúYou coat the logs with the red chemicals.‚Äù
---
I assume they are a just metal powder in a ridiculous looking container. You can make a rich pinkish-red flame in real life by burning lithium chloride. 
---
Adding new things to the game indirectly touches items that already exist anyway.
---
Wow that is a name I have not seen in a long time. I used to use ArtMoney to cheat in Throne of Darkness. The multiplayer was basically nothing but "who made the better hacked account".
---
MUM THE CLANS ARE PKING ME IN THE WILDERNESS REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Unless scouting is costly, revs are botted and these bots scan your risk. Clans have extremely unfair advantages against solo pvmers.
---
I used to DOLO revs, now its imposible.
---
If you are at a desk all day, you should think about a standing desk with a good anti-fatigue mat to stand on. 
---
It will suck at first, but trust me when I say that standing is immeasurably better than the back problems from prolonged sitting. 
---
Sitting at my desk all day for grad school, then classes and homework, then gaming to unwind at night took years of physical therapy to undo. An adjustable standing desk (so you can sit when you need to as well) is a must have for desk workers IMO.
---
Imagine being so uncreative you name your channel after a fast food restaurant lol.

When I read armor of color I just thought of a dye job gone horribly wrong and tye dyed armor.

I remember it took me like half an hour to find him one time because i thought he was still in draynor, so i came there to find him missing so then i looked all over port sarim only to find him in front of the pub half an hour later

&gt;Swampletics stats are peanuts to get as a normal player if you put in even like a third of the hours settled put into his account.

I kinda realized that yeah, Swampletics has donealmost as much as me stat-wise in a much shorter time, but I almost have all quests completed, have void, etc. 
---
*dies*

Ez prayer xp
---
*Hi human!* It's your **6th Cakeday** reinfleche! ^(hug)
---
Probably. Still would be botted, though. 20 mind runes would make more sense thematically because the guy in ardy gives you death runes, and it is a cheap enough reward to not be too big of an impact if botted
---
this is incredible info and I probably would‚Äôve wasted so much money otherwise. I already destroyed my glory amulet room on accident. 
---
Thanks for saving me so much $$$
---
Use a Disc of Returning!! Duh!!! :p
---
That‚Äôs kinda... pay to win don‚Äôt you think? Rich people just get pets without any effort.
---
I play it for the massive amount of Ironmen calling each other stupid
---
It's the wilderness, it's part of the game. It's not meant to be a happy fun safe place for ironmen to do revs. 
---
This is some of the few things a clan can actually lock down for entry in osrs. If you've played other MMO's that have global pvp this kind of thing is common. Region lock an area with your clan to claim the best resources for yourself. If you don't like it amass a force to beat them. 
---
And if you really want to do revs for free just go to any of the other 50 worlds. 
---
Oh I thought it was happening to me because I get on pc so it logs me out of my ipad. But it's happening with me as well.
---
Let's be honest with ourselves for just a second here. 
---
And I'll make sure to use conservative numbers here too.
---
[Tests at revenant caves uninterrupted while being skulled, and why the hell wouldn't they be, is probably $4 - 5 million gp per hour](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9o3ic6/revenants_gph_calculator/). Oh, and those are estimates based on max stats and 3 items.
---
Let's assume they have 3 -4 accounts farming revenants while being protected by these clans, on 3 different high-total-level worlds, and that they play for 6 hours a day (again, probably conservative numbers).
---
That would be $288 million per day, $1 billion per week, with only 6 hours played per account.
---
They are absolutely RWT.
---
Well yes but I thought you meant 46-46 with a max of 46 as opposed to 47-47 with a max of 47.  At any given max hit, all hit chances are equally likely (counting hits like 45-46 and 46-45 independently), so the lower the max hit, the more likely you are to hit the max hit.
---
Ironman mode on OSRS is the same as the implementation of the 120 capes on RS3. 
---
At first a few people start to grind then the majority of the other players rush to the forums and social media to moan about how hard it is
---
Because if you're in a tournament world and you set your defence to 1, you won't be able to switch to lunars with a message popping up saying something about the need to have 40 defence.
---
I feel because Its behind elites people move on to other much better things by then.
---
As a one-size-fits-all-use-it-all-the-time armor? Yes. Void isn't that.
---
However, it most definitely has its uses.
---
For example, Vorkath. Even if you're on a blue dragon task, slayer helm does NOT stack with salve. Void, does. This makes void the superior option.
---
Another example, learning CoX/Zulrah. Less switches means more space for brews/food and less attention needed on your inv. Granted you typically ditch void in these scenarios once you get better, but it's good for learning.
---
The best example, ToB. Even with maxed gear, most people opt for void with all 3 helms to save on inv space. They even bring void melee AND bandos, since the acc bonus from void is better for DWH specs then switch to bandos to scythe/whip bosses like Sote and Verz... Or just wear void the whole time at Nylos since it's easier to hybrid/tribrid with a 4 way switch than a 7-8 way.
---
I thought Jagex would ban the account if there is an account dispute like in your explanation. Given that Jagex is unable to tell who the actual account creator is and the fact that account sharing is still officially against the rules.
---
I understand that Jagex doesn't actively enforce the account sharing rule and uses a "common sense approach", but the situation you're describing doesn't seem to fit that criteria.
---
Maybe I misunderstood what you're saying. It just seemed that Jagex only looks at one specific thing instead of the entire situation. 
---
I'm also hoping that Jagex doesn't just deny the 'fraudulent' appeal from this 'friend' but also cleans up the account if possible. It think it's important to clean up accounts where possible. We shouldn't remain vulnerable and be unlucky if another JMod decides otherwise and accepts a future recovery appeal.
---
Augury is pretty big as well. 
---
That's literally what he means
---
Holy shit the levels off retardation are off the fucking charts here lol go eat glue you autist 
---
For option 2, check out ge-tracker.com. I started my flipping with furies, daganoth rings and ahrim robes. Might not be viable anymore. Later moved up to bandos and other 20m+ items. Kind of ruined the game for me though as all I could think of was flipping and money, which is super boring. Started an ironman now to give the game meaning beyond gp again.
---
no, the clean anti dragon shield from before the claw marks update is 10 times more aesthetic than the current scuffed one that looks like you picked it up from a dumpster

Happens on my phone too. Been happening for a few days

pure pking isnt really profitable in 2019 unless ur really good at it

Came here to post about Unidentified minerals. I've suggested it a few times but this is the first I've seen it towards the top so hope it gets some attention. 
---
&gt;	don‚Äôt want to be level 45 without money or knowledge...
---
Very few true level 45s have any idea what they‚Äôre doing and they‚Äôre almost all broke so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that. All you can really do is questing and learning the game.
---
So, just to recape:
---
jagex fucks up a weapons update so loads of pure accounts get accidental levels.
---
**then** to fix it they remove the exp from people whose name is on a forum thread, but it doing so, accidently removed people's defence levels who didnt need removing
---
**then** to fix that, give 10 times the amount of exp back to them from what they already had, launching them into the top 300 in highscores
---
I thought it‚Äôs only me... Very annoying have to retype login info every single time.
---
All these guys are talking about worth and shit, you didn't ask about making money with it. Go for it man, you can do zulrah with a rcb and ibans if you wanted to. Most players are a bit too focused on efficiency, just go have some fun
---
What kind of xp/hr did you get? Bursting feels slow compared to chinning
---
You can see in the comment I put above, it was ~34.8m in total at 2.95gp/XP.
---
One of the mains that had his def reset said it wouldn't let him cast lunar spells without 40 def 
---
What we need is an amulet of customer support. 
---
Nice censoring. You forgot your farming level though, say bye to your account.
---
Any video of that lol ?
---
I was thinking anodization would result in the best look
---
Tbow and black chins, probably
---
Terrible bait
---
Well that answers it. It had to be something like that indeed
---
I feel like I‚Äôd burn out at around that total. All the XP requirements are so high at base 80 
---
I just shit myself
---
You seem like some one who would throw rocks at me on death plateau
---
Where is above as its not in this post?
---
And cool, guessing I will need about 25-30M then to 99 from 86? 
---
cheers 
---
Wtf been playing since 06 and I've never seen those stairs
---
It appears to just be someone who made a look-a-like. That looks like a Giant Spider, which do not appear in Morytania. 
---
Does gear really make that big of a difference when afking NMZ? I'm currently 66/68/67 melees, using dragon armor +dragon scimmy + fury, and only getting ~30-35k an hour doing normal rumble (haven't checked specific rates). 
---
i got my first on 250
---
people would still use str ammy for 2 extra max hits with melee. 
---
Happens on my iPad and iPhone every time but it doesn‚Äôt make me reauthenticate every time.  Started just after the last update.
---
Good explanation, it is more than I expected. Thank you. 
---
It is reassuring to hear that Jagex actually does look into removing compromised details off hijacked accounts. I fully understand that it's not always easy to distinguish genuine appeals from hijack appeals. Especially when an account was heavily shared between multiple people. 
---
Removing too many details could indeed make future recoveries by the account creator more difficult if not impossible. I'm just wondering, wouldn't it be better to remove the compromised details and then communicate it with the account creator? Possibly even allow them to set three new passwords to replace them with.
---
It's just a random thought I had. It will probably create new issues with them forgetting those passwords or writing them down etc.. It's just that I would prefer being informed by Jagex and having more control with my account's recovery.
---
This dude is just messing with you and apparently it‚Äôs super easy 
---
A solid 40-50m of that XP has been gained while playing league or studying, helps with burnout lol
---
Only other one I can think of is pharaohs sceptre 
---
tfw jagex's incompetence is a bug
---
There's reason to believe it would. If you have quest cape equipped and a new quest is released, it is unequipped from you automatically.
---
Actually, ecstacy does cause permanent neurologically changes and can easily do it after just the first time in a very drastic way. 
---

---
\&gt; I think in general Void only overtakes Arma at like 94 Range 
---
I think it's very dependent on what you're doing. You can't just stamp an arbitrary number on it and say it's better at that level.
---
I used to change shop items with Cheat engine to Party hats and trying to buy them but getting disappointed that it didn't work

---
Yeah if you use the same gear I did I would guess that's about right. Gear is the post I just linked.
---
If they didn‚Äôt focus resources on new content like Zeah and raids, the entire game would be entirely dead. Plus idiots like you can‚Äôt see that OSRS is owned by a parent company controlling their decisions. If it‚Äôs something that isn‚Äôt going to make them more money, they aren‚Äôt going to support it. Fucking retard

Yes super normal , every account I‚Äôve ever seen do barrows has at least 5 hoods . You‚Äôre actually a little under the drop rate I have 200 cheats and I have 9 hoods 
---
Okay but how did you get more bones dropped than creatures killed?? Truly curious
---
...Are you trolling on purpose? Or do you actually not realize that game content is a completely different subject than *the actual fucking polling system itself*, and that the two should be treated differently?
---
You know what he meant ya dingus

nice boots

Yeah they definitely do, at most I find myself losing 10k, but it'd usually around even or profit, definitely worth planting once per day.

it isn't

Can you elaborate on each topic? 
---
I didn't really like the updates personally at the time, but I realize now that it's what was needed to bring activity. 
---
Can't please everybody, I guess. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Glad to see them address these issues for once, however what they said about hiding polls was essentially asking ‚ÄúWhy do you guys want this?‚Äù like it‚Äôs an unusual request to make. Showing the results of a poll before someone votes is not standard practice for polling, by default they should be hidden and if Jagex wants to show the poll results, it should be us asking them ‚ÄúWhy do you guys want this?‚Äù The answer as to why we want poll results hidden has been answered ad nauseam on this sub but we‚Äôre not sure what value Jagex sees in showing poll results to users before they vote.
---
I think it's more like, they get diminishing returns for even greater effort the closer they want to get to 0 bots. There has to be a balance. Though what gets me is some accounts MUST be flagged by their bot detection but don't get banned. Like nmz bots or 24/7 runecrafting bots
---
Does this mean we are finally get rid of iron man?
---
Don't think there's a price, but maybe someone is nice enough to give you gold :)
---
As fun as an official osrs client would be, I dont want to see dev's taking time and possibly making mistakes and having new exploits or bugs happen. Could you imagine the uproar? Let's just leave osbuddy and runelite to their own. Jagex already allows it.

&gt; If you're going to shorten it, at least to it properly to ammy

If you're going to criticize people then at least fucking make sure your sentence is correct.

Yes

My immediate goal is base 70s so I can get past 85 combat and start using Nieve, but I'd like to hit base 80s somewhat soon as well.

Literally read the question in the title?? The question is "what is the average drop". Saying "there isn't an average" is clearly retarded, because you can literally take all the drops and adjust by weight and find the answer. The answer is above. It's that simple, not really sure what you're on about lmao

What about a cosmetic reward, something like the capes for raids 1 &amp; 2 or a toy with an emote action, for number of polls/questions you've participated in?
---
Let's be honest, the way to motivate the OSRS players is through a reward.
---
The downside is that you get people who just spam the answers and you get mass "yes" votes. Might be too risky to attempt.
---
Just an idea though.

They said on twitter in januari that it should save the kills when you're logged in

Plenty of bosses you wear a shield instead of a defender? Small brain comment.

I'm not sure if that's what they mean, but even if it is it's naive to think they can eliminate bots all together, and to just try to keep botting from getting too crazy is jagex's best course of action. I think that's an unfortunate fact that they realize.

A mix of most of these things is probably best. Quest for passive income from Varrock diary and Kingdom. Do birdhouse and herb runs consistently and fill up time in between with slayer or chins if you prefer skilling. Slayer does not make a ton of money until after lvl 70 though, so prioritize working on the other money makers first. Thieving is not really a great money maker for main accounts, only for ironmen.

Karil is a Barrows brother, gloves are commonly used in archery, a good set of gloves protects your hand by cushioning while not being so cushioned that it ruins your feel for the shot. Granted, Karil does use a crossbow, but one might still expect him to be a formidable archer.

That‚Äôs just being pedantic. Barrows gloves are primarily ranged gloves then and occasionally decent when melee/range hybridding. Can you think of any circumstance when anyone uses barrows gloves for pure meleeing? Even rune drags with full justiciar set up still uses ferocious gloves over barrows gloves.

As much as we shit on Jagex, they are one of the few companies with industry leading player interaction. Few game developers have such a drive to continue to engage with their player base like OSRS mods, and we're like 75% autistic on a good day. Their passion and dedication to discussing our problems with the game is, in my opinion, the reason OSRS has seen so much growth since launch. I wish the team nothing but success

My thoughts on polling is that if you say having the results visible influences it, you also have to acknowledge the fact that some streamers do as well. 
---
We saw this recently with one in particular going off on Twitter, streams and his videos telling and begging his fairly large viewer base to vote for specific things that he wanted and to use alts if they had them, then getting mad and insulting people who said they wouldn't. It's safe to assume that a chunk of those viewers don't typically vote, or if they do they're more likely to vote for what he wants because it's more content for them. 
---
I watch and enjoy his content, but something also should be said about popular content providers attempting to sway the poll results for their own personal gain. 
---
I'm sure it'll come up so I'll just add that what he was doing wasn't simply saying why people should vote for specific things which is perfectly fine and beneficial.  I'm sure plenty of people here who saw the now deleted Twitter hissy fits can understand the context.  
---
Anyway, it is refreshing to see all of these issues are finally being looked into.

What about adding the ability to vote from anywhere, and automatically opening the voting interface the first time you log in (turned on by default with the option to disable)?
---
I like that Jagex is listening to us.
---
My main concerns are definitely listed in the message.  I really hope Jagex enforces rules against scammers better in the future.  There's so many rampant rule breakers on every single world, at the Grand Exchange.
---
* Dicebots
---
* Youtube advertisers ("Free 200m if you look up X on youtube")
---
* Gold Sellers
---
It's just draining seeing the community stoop this low and that Jagex appears to be powerless against them just because they can do this outside of Jagex's timezone. (and even sometimes during their timezone)
---
This is going to sound wild, but I've been thinking about adding incentive to polls. Problem is: it can't be financial gain nor a big deal. How about awarding players with a small xp lamp for completing a poll? It would be the same xp as the Classroom random. With this you attract mainly genuine players.
---
Second suggestion, if the OS team were to award small xp lamps for completing a poll, is to add a timer to the poll. When someone clicks on the 'answer question' button, a timer will start. The questions cannot be turned in until the timer has run out. This would tackle the issue where players would just head to a poll booth to spam click for the reward. What do you guys think?
---
&gt;Toxicity in game

I agree that this should be toned down a bit, but I hope we don't see late rs2 levels of muting/bans for talking shit or taking the piss.

In my opinion the entirety of Lumbridge castle should be safe on PvP worlds. It's very unintuitive where PvP lines start and end at the moment, so unintuitive in fact that the only reasonable way to discern them is through trial and error.

This looks really cool and I think a lot of people will agree with me that it‚Äôs a wonderful idea to reward players for maxing in a much harder environment, but the HC variant looks like a normal max cape which wouldn‚Äôt be very rewarding for questionably the most difficult mode to max on.

I've been to Europe once in my life (I live in America) and that trip has changed my outlook on most everything for the better. I took a backpack, loaded up with clothes and a notebook, and travelled to Paris, Rome, Serbia, and Montenegro. Stayed in the cheapest places I could find and did as much as I could while I was there, and I have never had a better time in my life. When I think about everything I have done, being impulsive and taking that trip was by far the best choice I have ever made.
---
I don't know if you want to stay with the things that are familiar to you or really spread your wings and experience something new but if I was in your situation, I would consider dropping everything and doing something crazy. Like others have said, you are in a situation where there are no consequences for your actions. Not to be inconsiderate and say you are lucky by any means, but that is pretty awesome. Take advantage of that.

I'll bet a bond hiding poll results won't change voter counts or how most everything passes by a landslide

I remember when prayer pots were like 2k a piece. Now they are over priced and hoarded by flippers, merchers, and rich players.

I'll believe that account security is being worked on when I actually see something. 
---
Ear marking projects at the start of the financial year is a way to get budgeting and funding approved. The sad fact of it is that shabby account security doesn't affect membership/profits so it's unlikely that any resources will be put towards this.
---
I'd be extremely surprised if there were any changes in account security by this time next year.
---
The original owner can take the account back at any time no matter what information you change so it's not worth the risk.
---
A lot of the time they sell accounts with the intent to recover them later once you've done a lot of work on it.

It‚Äôs because some of public comms is not throwing your employees under a bus.

How do you feel about untradeable consumable drops from bosses that will benefit the player outside of the boss? For example maybe a boss will have a rare drop of a one dose potion to skip a growth phase in the farming cycle, but you can only use one for each thing you plant that way you cant get a bunch of them and get 99 farming in a day. 
---
I think drops like this would be a cool way to make bosses worth doing without having to make them more and more gp per hour.

---
Also bots/gold farmers make up a high number of accounts that play regularly but do not ordinarily vote, until something is polled that might affect their method.
---
Just because the most popular game fell down a bit because of other competition that rose up that year, doesn't make the game immediately dead. 
---
Hopefully that'll lessen the endless wave of memes about the topic, the subreddit has become unbearable for me
---
In all seriousness, I think this is an appropriate response. Hiding poll results is a mostly good idea, but there are other factors within polling that need looked at and I agree that the issue is bigger than simply hiding results. I hope that this isn't something that drags on for years though..
---
Will our passwords finally allow for special characters and he case sensitive? This is completely inexcusable in 2019.
---
There are a ton of issues with the polling system.
---
Results not being hidden discourages votes.
---
The popular opinion ruins updates for small communities, pvp is an example
---
The game is called "old school" and "2007scape", some players just don't want anything that feels like it doesn't belong in the game if it's not feeling like something from back then.  However the game is evolving, that's what updates do.  A noticeable size of the community will vote no on all new skills because it's not "old school" even though back in 2006-2007 we were getting a new skill more often than once a year.  I understand taking community feedback, but the voting system is just straight up flawed.  Back in 2005 we didn't have a polling system, and it was fine, UNTIL Jagex made huge sudden changes that disrupted the game without listening to feedback.  And there was feedback back then, riots in falador, forum posts, etc.
---
My opinion: don't poll small updates, don't poll quests, don't poll item's stats, but use the forums, reddit, twitter, etc for feedback on dev blogs, it's pretty obvious if we hate something.  If anything add a reddit type forum on the old school webpage so we can comment on the dev blogs, with upvotes/downvotes, etc.  Polls can be used for large updates, but honestly a yes/no voting system is just awful.

It makes sense doe, why would someone want to scam/lure someone with little to no return. The gear gives them visible confirmation that you have something of value that they want
---
If you were a scammer, would you rather an opportunity to scam full/trimmed rune, or someone who potentially has 80+ million gp? Continue to block and ignore or don't bank stand at the GE advertising your wealth to scammers.

So what you are saying is that a company is intentionally upsetting their player base even though they can fix the issue? No company would choose to anger their customers, that doesn't make sense whether it be Jagex or any other company in the world.

But a dude with 2k+ total and 150m in gear is wayyyyy less likely to be stupid enough to fall for a lure than some mid level with 5m in gear

UIM: designed to be a challenge where you dont have more than 28 inventory spots.

Also, if you don't like playing that way I'd suggest you don't play UIM mode.

You're saying it's shit gameplay that way, but why did you create an UIM in the first place? Don't return it back to me and tell me to play it. I will never play UIM, because I don't have the dedication to play UIM. It also loses my interest, because people are using loopholes to still bank items.

Play UIM the way you want, but you're not playing it the way it's intended.

Part 2: If you want to work on bringing together the community, then introduce the proposed GE tax.  Players will start communicating with each other and trading, players will use the official forums again.  Then with players on the official forums you will have a community there, a place of discussion.  I can't tell you the last time I went to the official forums... because right now, there is no reason.

The next step after this is the NK method: your health will slowly drain until you vote. üòÇ

A real frustration for me with voting in polls is that I have to interrupt what my character is doing and make my way over to a poll booth to vote. Yes, I know there are poll booths next to every bank, but sometimes I just like to log out in the middle of a slayer assignment and continue where I left off later. I think it'd help get the polling numbers up if there were a polling button somewhere in the game's menu, similar to the Account Management tab.

Yes they are intentionally ignoring us because it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs gonna make membership numbers go down significantly if they just do nothing even though it will help many people feel safer about putting in work into their account. They want to do as little work as possible. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôve always been. That‚Äôs why when any common sense QOL stuff is brought up to them, they claim ‚Äúengine work‚Äù to get out of it. They don‚Äôt like to do work. Work costs time, Time is money
---
Honestly I would be happy with the rs3 pin. It requires you put it in to do pretty much anything In their game. 
---
Where/how can we ask questions? Not all of us have a Twitter account
---
  &gt; Player activity data proves that new content is a big driver for the community,
---
well if the old content is old and was designed in an era of lower quality content then this feels like a  pretty disingenuous comparison to make.  
---
&gt;Like yeah we understand that that old road is damaged with severe potholes, but no one drives on it, instead everyone drives on the brand new road.
---
Well I wonder why, perhaps the data is indicative on one thing(New content more engaging), but could be caused by multiple factors(old content poorly designed, lacks competitive rewards with new content, no hype because old, hype because new, done everything else worthwhile so even if new content is not worthwhile I'll still do it because new)
---
Jagex. Item sink, please.
---
I would love to see an update to the clan chats as well. Openly viewable clan rosters, in game message boards for events or being able to communicate outside of being logged in(leaving messages behind that can be read by others when offline). I love having a clan but not being able to flaunt it is kinda boring
---
TIL.... 
---
I understand now 
---
Same as the armour. Dying as a hardcore removes the hc and gives you the normal iron armour. Deironing removes the armour period.
---
Same I honestly didn‚Äôt know there were red until I ran thru the wildy the other month - and was like ‚Äúno shit, I should have known that‚Äù lol
---
So you‚Äôre complaining about something that hasn‚Äôt even happened yet
---
Maybe eventually they'll realise clans hard fucking anyone that tries to pk in the wilderness doesn't encourage people to keep trying.
---
That's not entirely true. I want to do high level PVM but that means I have to do quests I don't care for, and train skills I don't care for to meet requirements for those quests. Everything in this game is intertwined and it's all a major grind.
---
So glad I got my torso again, never going back to that godforsaken place
---
Hahahahaha made me laugh that‚Äôs what the point of this post was for right 
---
F2p wizard robes are next to useless. All f2p gets for magic accuracy is the +10 from the staff, +3 from the robe top and +2 from the hat for **25** total
---
The best ranged accuracy bonus in f2p is **68**
---
Yeah, but we need to make a tied second best in the game ranged amulet for f2p.....
---
Are you guys going to ever consider unpolled changes to the granite maul?
---
Is saying $10.99 going to become the less sarcastic (or more sarcastically optimistic) version of saying $11? I love it.
---
this ain't rs3 bud
---
‚ÄúOnE vOtE wOnT dO aNy ThInG‚Äù
---
I solved it :)
---
Because the intent is to have the capes match the armours and Jagex decided that the HCIM armour should be a pale shade of red, for one.
---
It also kinda balances out that HCIM gets the most distinct armour to begin with.
---
The problem with that is, your character is already in the game ready to take damage when that screen is displayed. How about replacing the chatbox? That does sound like a lot of engine work, but would be really cool. You could easily fit one question from the current poll interface in there. You could also make it disappear if you start typing or get a highlighted game message, removing pretty much any possible disruption of the actual game
---
I‚Äôd like to add to yours that I use a VPN frequently (thousands of miles away) and occasionally it randomly disconnects and reconnects. I‚Äôd hate for my account to get locked every time that happened. Having maybe common ‚Äúregions‚Äù as login locations would be nice though. So if someone in S. America logged in I‚Äôd want it locked. 
---
Chris Archie is proof jmids RWT lmao
---
I totally thought the same thing reading this. A wall of text but almost no substance
---
you are already logged in when you see that screen so it would have to be asked on the loginscreen.
---
Anyways asking for the banking on login does basically nothing to improve your accounts security. If you get phished you are still going to give them all they need, if you get ratted you actually give them your bankpin everytime you log in instead of just sometimes and if you get recovered it obviously wont help with that either.
---
It only really helps people who are dumb enough to use the same password on every website and never change their passwords. And in those cases where people just dont give a shit they probably cant be bothered with having an extra pin or hackers can just get into their email.
---
Just a waste of dev time and false sense of security
---
It‚Äôll be much harder though to achieve that 70% so perhaps fewer things will be polled in the futute
---
Yep.
---
Jagex wants to know your location
---
Try using that thing in your head called a brain.
---
Nah, Woox was too busy doing Inferno with only a bronze crossbow while 3 ticking barb fishing on his alt.
---
Hiding poll content would make the game very interesting very quickly 
---
Wish I could but I'm balls at pking, lol
---
There was a PC pet suggestion post a few months back with each monster as a pet. They all looked amazing! If i find it, I'll cone back and link it.
---
1) How do you know its not? I get common sense says its mainly phishing scams but, how are you so certain people arent using programs (which turn "lifetimes" of guessing into mere minutes) to bruteforce and get into accs without 2fa? Also have you not seen the polls about how many people set password123 and similarly simpler things than single words as their pws? Its fairly common practice, bevause people assume no one will sit there and guess absurd one worded things.. forgetting that people design software to do guess every word in the dictionary.
---
Well, no, because you can only do the stronghold once, but you can raise many kittens

This brings me back to the team doubles of halo 3. Boosting was always an issue, but not really that big of a problem for decent players

Ehhh there's definitely a bit of insentive to fix BH in my opinion. I went back the other day for the first time in a year and it's plagued with looters/boosters and even though I've only nhed/single pked for the best part of 2.5 years I'd definitely like to see bh fixed.
---
It's pretty depressing though that most of my friends who I pked with have now moved onto pvm or ironman purely because how neglected everything was. This also feels like the 10th time I've seen Jagex mention sorting pvp and everytime nothing comes of it so I don't have high hopes here at all... 
---
wait......... they aren't case sensitive? i'm an idiot
---
So if I don't log into other accounts with runelite Iy should work?
---
That's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to changing the color of the gems to black if this is such a glaring concern, though.
---
I'm 99 prayer and used the bonecrusher necklace as a swap for anguish when I was chinning. Zero ppots used and could stay as long as I still had chins. Super handy to have
---
"abusing an old system" is one of the only difference between a bad and good pvmer, also you can do inferno without using any 1t prayer and therefore not abusing an old system. Im not sure how you can think using a method which puts your own fate into the hands of numbers and rng is better than using a method where you control the outcome of the damage you're receiving 
---
If you're in the wildy does it not already skip the 'click to play' screen anyway?
---
It's a crab

* All of them. Decisively swayed? Impossible to tell.

Generally hacking is done through social engineering, you are not wrong. Just because a missile can shoot down a bridge doesn't mean it's not worth maintaining the bridge anyways.

After the helm of Raedwald quickly became a ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù item I really hope they keep this one a secret
---
Thank god, 1.75 years is more than enough to max. Then I can die in peace.
---
Literially every other game should takes notes on how Jagex talks with the community. I honestly never thought they would address the memes but they did.  
---
The communication is really A+, wish more games would follow this kind of communication like Wo2 for example.  
---
Good shit Jagex. 
---
no man wtf, I don't want to fucking shit myself every time I log in.
---
Can the bruma torch and warm gloves be added to the pyromancer set so they can be stored in the magic wardrobe in the POH?
---
Cooking an entire chicken in a pan..
---
I hope i never have to get roommates lmao
---
This is great, and I'm glad there's actually some transparency, but why now? Why not a year ago? These aren't new problems, and frankly it's felt like the mod team has been going out of their way to ignore these problems. Can we expect the mod team to follow through with this? 
---
PS. I except the head of eSports will be in charge of getting contest winners their prizes? (Which wasn't addressed in the post)
---
I love that little blue dildo so much.
---
That's basically what graceful looked like on release lol
---
... No reason it **has** to open an external website from there, as it is already in-game. It could just open the poll interface there and then, exactly as if you had clicked on a booth. 
---
This would give me so much motivation to max my ironman 
---
No? If I'm in a remote location and only get to play for 20/30 minutes there's no way I'm banking
---
&gt; just because their votes get traction first
---
why does that make sense? why are yes voters more likely to vote early?
---
&gt;repolling things 3 times literally forcing them in into the game
---
isnt that the point though? if content isn't passing, fix it so its acceptable?
---
&gt;but the currently biased votes 
---
i mean in the current state you dont have to vote if the poll is going as you want it to. which is fine isnt it?
---
Maybe he can be my friend too!?!?! üòÇüòÇ

possible to add exp/kc of gotten pet? super useful for even the pet owner

it is. but thats because for some reason LEATHER from a ranged boss somehow makes bis MELEE gloves (that even looked like vambraces originally).
---
That's a good point. They did say they'll be discussing problems with polling on tomorrow's live stream as well as into the future. You should join those discussions and make your voice heard to the people responsible for making the changes.
---
Shouldn't the old school team not put bad content to a poll in the first place? So the vote by the old school team would always pass...?
---
as is amulet of magic i believe
---
Imagine only doing inferno once. This post was made by the zuk pet gang.
---
I really wish there was a chat or phone support, and not a 14-day delay with account questions or recovery. It seriously is time that is can easily be achieved. I understand that it takes a little while longer to do recoveries, for example, xbox compromised account recoveries taking over two weeks, but at least they have a live chat support that is willing to keep you updated on what is going on, or taking so long...
---
Just keeping record for when you delete it later homie
---
instead of things like "challenging myths about customer support and combating toicity" why not just hire on a handful of dedicated customer support reps?
---
This may get burried but for PvP why not add the minigame where your skills levels are what allow you to mine,cut, or make weapons to use on the enemy team. I cannot remember the name of the game in RS3 but im pretty sure it came out before EoC. 
---
I had a lot of fun and everyone i mention this game to, if they remember it, wish it was back in runescape
---
If you're doing mutated ones, you can use house teleports to recharge prayer and then kourend portal back to the catacombs. It only takes 50 construction, which isn't too too expensive I don't think
---
Can we do something about snape grass taking ages to harvest? Maybe something like with limpwurts where you get them all in one go? Takes 2 minutes to harvest a single patch even with 16 open inv slots
---
no because people use rune for melee, no one uses amulet of accuracy for anything other than ranged.
---
Why would I delete it?
---
Wanna know a fun fact, If you go onto Wikipedia and search for a random article, you can click the links in the article to get back to Hitler in around 4 links on average.
---
You‚Äôre downvoted because it‚Äôs literally nothing to do with Jagex.
---
The point of them being hidden is to keep people who don‚Äôt have much of an opinion from voting with the majority.
---
Especially when they become useful and the limited supply makes their price go through the roof
---
it helps if you zoom in when you tele to the mushroom meadow area.

Yep. Most of the time I go to vote in 07 I open it, see everything passing and then don't bother.

Kind of a weird question I've wondered about the keys, but does dropping them and keeping them on ground allow you to get keys at the higher droprate? I have like 3 keys now from around 800 spiritual warriors on task, the droprate is downright painful.
---
This is the highest IQ response. Hiding poll results is about upholding universal values, maintaining ancient principles, not about "actually" hiding poll results. It is a metaphor for the greater virtues of mankind, that there is still work to do. There will always be room for us to forge forward. Even if the day comes where poll results are hidden, crabs will still be posted. 
---
Pretty sure they made swapping bannable last season
---
Its probably not enforced very well, DMM is dead because of swapping anyway so they probably wont care if they still dont change anything 
---
Can snape grass be used to make supercompost? Doesn't make sense that watermelons and pineapples can but snape grass can't with a 61 farming requirement.
---
Well some things are objectively good but still fail, which if they get \~70% is obviously worth looking at.
---
A good example of this is probably divine, it doesn't change the meta much for any bosses (except maybe DK's and a couple others?) But failed a poll even though it is inherently OSRS.
---
That‚Äôs good to know, I‚Äôll try the GPU plug in and see what it‚Äôs like. But yeah it is just mushroom meadow where my FPS lowers. Thanks for the information about single core

Has the idea of using the hydra spine for something new like the proposed bone whip been scrapped? Or is there still ideas with it.

How competent do you have to be at prayer flicking to get through inferno with justicar? I just got rigour and have been thinking about trying inferno, not even for the cape, but just to see how far I can get and I'm okay(big emphasis on okay) at PVM but can't prayer flick insanely well. I'd also probably be using ACB instead of tbow so there's that.
---
It‚Äôs pretty annoying with the eyes and no arc light but deffo possible man good luck

If anything it should be a lot higher than 50%, imagine 68% is more appropriate

They have decided to stream there Q&amp;A's, and some announcements on twitch, which makes the fake streams look legitimate. Yet nowhere on their website or Twitch streams do they advise to stay away from the imposter streams.

It helps people who got phished via the fake streams (where you enter your info into a fake forum) and it would help the same people who get hacked through a keylogger.

Right but I think the point was that even someone who has to get them by themselves find them abundant/relatively low-value.

Is it possible to have the ability to use the myths cape on the quest cape to give the quest cape the teleport for the myths guild. Seems themetically fitting since the quest cape is the highest tier quest reward.

It helps greatly in the event of a breach.

The game is long enough without going to a fucken poll booth every week no matter what i click they will just make pointless time wasting content no one asks for.

Who would make an alt just to post this?
---
Don‚Äôt know if anyone ever reads this, but I usually have no idea what I should pick when there‚Äôs a poll. This is because I‚Äôm pretty noob (did get Barrows Gloves recently tho!) and most of the questions I simply don‚Äôt understand or involves things I have never seen before, let alone know what effect either choise has on the gameplay. Still think opinions shouldnt be biased and I feel like more people will vote if they don‚Äôt know their ‚Äòno‚Äô is 1/200 against 20.000 yesses.

shit rs doesnt even use up 6% of my cpu...

I‚Äôm not whining, people can play it however they want. In my eyes(so my personal opinion) it‚Äôs not staying true to the idea behind UIM and I don‚Äôt ‚Äúsupport‚Äù that playstyle.

I got a question. Where can i report a bug? I went to the runescape forums and submited a ticket but the RS3 folks couldn't bother with osrs related bugs/issues. So i am asking if there is a specific forum or person i should be in contact with where i can explain my situation. I am asking this now because i refuse to rely on reddit/twitter for this kind of things and it's a first for me. I am kinda contradicting my self on that last sentence but i just need to know where is the right place to look for help.

&gt;I wouldn't want to see punishment further than mutes for anything like this. If it's something that breaks irl laws, or anything like that, then yes get rid of them. But a return to the overly sensitive system of old would be a big mistake. 
---
Definitely agree it should only be mutes and not bans. at the end of the day its just words and if you dont want to see them simply use the ignore list or profanity filter

Because that sand is property of Sandy Sand Co. and your thieveing level ain't high enough to pull of that kinda heist.

I just enjoy laughing at how angry you are.

If you die as an HCIM, you lose the title, no?
---
The cape would be representative of your HCIM status. May as well change the rules of the game mode to Ironman, except red, if what you said is the case.
---
I never said they aren‚Äôt allowed too. I personally think you‚Äôre fooling yourself for saying you play an UIM whilst having more than 28 spaces in your inventory.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä THANK YOU FOR ADRESSING THE CONCERNS ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Why though, f2p sucks so bad xD
---
It doesn't work like that though. There is no lobby system on osrs. If you're on the 'click to play' screen your character is already in the game. Engine won't allow a lobby (yet).
---
I have another reason for not polling that I haven‚Äôt seen anyone discuss yet. 
---
I‚Äôm a relatively novice player and often don‚Äôt know what a lot of the changes actually would do. A lot of the questions about things I‚Äôve never seen in my life. But when there is a question I care about I can‚Äôt answer it because Jagex forces you to answer the entire poll and not just the questions you care about. Because of this I refuse to vote because then I‚Äôd be pushing for changes that I know nothing about  
---
You can brute Force an 8 character password in 5 hours, but at the very least adding a symbol helps drastically reduce everyone's risk of any dictionary based attack. 
---
Seriously. This is a nice post to see but the poll results answer is such a cop out. It is a well studied effect and to ignore the very simple and widely accepted solution to it on the basis of "wanting to fully understand the problem" is so pointless.
---
If your roof is leaking you don't immediately go and fully investigate the problem, figure out the best way to fix it and then hire a contractor. You put a fucking bucket under it first.
---
Awesome. Thank you so much for addressing all of these issues. The OSRS team is legitimately one of the best teams I've ever seen in gaming. It's a shame you have to be restricted by the rest of Jagex's management, which clearly are money grubbing corporate mismanagers that lead to disasters like RS3. 
---
Mystic robes have ok magic defence, about the same as blue dhide iirc. This probably isn't the ideal gear to be using but it's not crazy if you have low ranged and no void.
---
May I make a suggestion regarding the lack of voters of polls? I think a lot of it just has to do with forgetfulness. Players need to go out of their way to vote. My suggestion is to have a box inside the login page that allows you to vote without having to go to a poll booth.
---
Another suggestion which may be a bit more frowned upon is a pop-up box that opens when you log in that lets you vote right from where you stand (limit this to only open if you log in while at a bank and safe areas). Have a checkbox readily available to disable the popup poll box for those not interested.

It makes me so happy to see both mods and players on the same side again, thank you jmods for listening and thank you all fellow players for their continued support and passion towards this game that we all love so much.

Thank you all for helping to create such a wonderful community that I'm able to be a part of....

Love you all and happy scaping!

But why?
---
Power ammy fills the range roll. The only other time it's used is when the str ammy doesn't give you a new max melee hit. 
---
Defense ammy is used, although it's definitely less than the other two. Doing this change would put it on par with a glory for offensive stats. That's making a 31 crafting amulet just as good as an 80 crafting amulet. If you were going to make this change you'd give it 6 or 7 range bonus. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten 4 molanisk tasks I feel like that‚Äôs a record 
---
I‚Äôm not coming up with rules, I‚Äôm telling about my personal issues with the gamemode.  
---
The implications behind an UIM is to not use additional spaces to store items. I assume Jagex didn‚Äôt say when they released UIM mode: oh btw, here, here, here and here are some loopholes to circumvent having only 28 inventory spots. 
---
What about contest winners not getting their rewards?
---
also i can't vote from the Runestone mine on Zeah. I just don't bother to travel for a 30 sec vote.
---
Personally I only vote no to pvp polls.
---
Good blog, well said.
---
Password cracking on runescape is highly inefficient. Back in 2004 they didn't have a lock out timer. The website will make you enter a captcha after 3 failed attempts. Rs3 is similar, with a timed lockout instead. Osrs has a 50 attempt lockout. To brute force a password in this day and age would be mildly impressive. We aren't in the days of 12345, 54321, dragon, killer, being efficient anymore. I was experienced with this stuff around 10-14 years ago. I can tell you stuff about this game and general knowledge/security I'm sure most jmod aren't even aware of.
---
I guess, but nobody wants to watch amazon prime lol...Plus when severe bordeom hits on weekends or late shifts...It causes me to spend money to rent movies lol.

Now that you have finally found a way behind the walls. Make your way over to the varrock west bank vault and tell me what's in those damn chests

I figure it's drops are worse because there's zero risk of being pk'd. I killed him on my HCIM to get rune cbow limbs and a black dhide body, so there is some niche use for people who don't want to get pk'd 
---
That's dumb AF.
---
Isnt the point of the account that he could die to a pker?
---
Tbh that's like bossing on an ironman and getting your main to tank.

Totally takes away the spirit of the game mode.
---
Hey Samoa!

It's a strictly cosmetic upgrade. I doubt the price will go through the roof
---
thanks! I'll be honest - I don't play anymore, but I watch a lot of content makers on youtube; feel like I have a pretty good sense of what kind of series do well haha. I'm not a fan of "too many modes", but with more and more players joining I think there's room for more.

Its A challenge.

Or just don't follow a series of instructions by a sketchy person on a pvp world telling you to do stuff after you've withdrawn expensive items? It's not hard to not be lured.

It's being made legal this season according to their most recent DMM post on the osrs website.

Shout-out to matk 
---
This clue definitely felt more collaborative than the last. It brought people together to solve different parts and was enjoyable following the discord 
---
Hopefully more mysteries are added to the game, whether it's ctc3 or something else
---
Even better. You'd hope that uninformed or uninterested people voting purely for the participation reward wouldn't influence the result, as long as the default option is abstain I don't see why they would bother changing from that.
---
&gt;It's important for us to understand why you want the poll results hidden, and what you think it would solve.
---
Because everyone should be thinking for them selves. People who need help deciding on what to vote for will find their own ways. This would give the player more of a say on what to vote for rather what everyone else has voted for. 
---
Can you use a worse to read font please?
---
btw
---
But that's confirmation bias and its your fault for acting that way based on it. No one is stopping you from voting

Def is the hardest to *learn* but by far the *easiest* to actually do. 
---
Wait what?? I have random caps characters in my password that I've been typing out for no reason??
---
I enjoy talking to idiots who think they're clever.  It's cute that you have yet to actually address a single point that I've made and are still acting like you're "winning" this conversation.
---
Anyone who assumes they're smarter than everyone around them without any evidence isn't very smart at all.
---
If you reply with something that addresses the points I'm making, maybe I'll respond, but otherwise I'll probably just leave you to your lonely "look how much more clever I am than everyone" party.
---
Ironman, btw. 
---
You're use of the words "bad" and "good" aren't very fair. I'll admit that I'm not as good as the people who 1t the whole thing or who can use ancestral the whole way through, but just having the cape puts me in the top 1%, just not the top .1%.
---
I claim to be good at the game, just not god tier at it. It was still really hard for me even with Justiciar as it is with most people.
---
go look at more of his twitch vods or something idk what to tell you bro, he sits in edge bank and practices his switches between fights. consistently doing 8 way 1 ticks and you can hear his clicks perfectly sync. dunno why you‚Äôre so stubborn to just accept the blatant truth
---
Same. Must have been the recent update.
---
S
---
Triangulate over thousands of tiles, 1 pixel off meant completely askew lines making it completely random where they actually landed.
---
Yeah, the first CTC was impossible because Jagex explicitly stated that you only needed the clues. The rest was ingame or so they claimed.
---
They forgot to mention that you would need to use a world map.  Remember that we didn't even have an ingame world map at the time of CTC's release. Oh, and you also needed 3rd party software to draw the lines and everything.
---
The item requirement was also an unknown mechanic. There were no hints whatsoever, but I'm sure someone would have figured that out.
---
If we knew that it I'm sure that would be solved within 24 hours, just like this one. It wasn't for the lack of effort, /u/ModMatK made it impossible to solve. At least with the initial explanation given by Jagex.
---
I'm glad the people involved with CTC2 managed to 'easily' beat him this time. 
---
Difficult passwords protect against bruteforcing so it most certainly does make it more difficult. I get where you're going with your edit and while you're not wrong, there's absolutely no reason for the password system to be this archaic. 
---
North Korea style: vote or be deleted. 
---
Meh, just go the full length and let the capes be customized like they are in Rs3
---
Rip i didnt think it looked bad but im on a computer right now.
---
Everyone should buy Defence amulets, now! If this happens it will be better then a Fury for range :) 
---
I left because the game became so vacant, minigames were almost no longer played, which was my favorite thing to do especially soul wars, mtx wouldnt be terrible if it was cosmetics only imo, im glad osrs came back, because I probably wouldnt be playing at all. Summoning I liked, but again I was anywhere between 7-9 when I first played rs most likely 8 so as a little kid I thought having a steel giant was awesome, besides theres ways around that, like adding soul wars but not summoning, only allowing summoning inside the minigame, fist of guthix was nice it had good f2p rewarda aswell, but theres more things I would hate to be added, but a few things wouldn't be the end of the world
---
w00x is a damn beast
---
I addressed your point. I have proof to show you how smart I actually am haha. 
---
You lose the title because it‚Äôs given to you to differentiate your game mode from regular ironmen. 
---
The Max cape is something you‚Äôve earned given those circumstances, and you put in the same amount of effort to earn it as a hcim whether or not you died. 
---
Using that string of logic, you could argue your way into the rs3 type hcim. Once you die, your account is deleted. After all, its like that for the title, armor, Max cape, so why should you keep your pvm gear? You got that as a hcim but you aren‚Äôt anymore so get rid of it. Why should you keep your xp? That was earned as a hcim, and you died, so you shouldn‚Äôt keep it. 
---
Runelite has a plugin that flashes the prayer icon when you're supposed to flick, which helps me a lot. 
---
oh shit he copped those yeezys of lightness

I may have a different perspective on how it feels to see a close family member dying of a terminal illness having gone through that experience myself.

---
The arrogance to call it, ‚ÄúMyths surrounding our customer support.‚Äù
---
As someone who logged in today after not playing for months, only to find their account banned a third time for botting/macros while I was taking a break, GOOD. Any motivation I have to play is gone the second I realize I'll have to start fresh *again*, or futilely attempt to crawl through the current "support" system to *maybe* be able to recover my account. Just once, I want to be able to play this game without getting banned for taking a break. At the very least a ban reason that isn't just three words long with zero justification would be nice so I can take steps to prevent it happening this time.
---
Sorry but OSRS will never be a serious competitive competition. It's WAY too RNG based.
---
I see a lot of rampant bigotry and racism that never get met with mutes or anything. Even after continual reports on them spamming the n-word or the like.
---
 I would really like 2019 to be the revival of PvP. I miss the good old days. 
---
No it's a pretty good analogy. You got the item when you were HCIM, you keep it. It works that way with every other item. 
---
You mention "vote no to P2P" memes.
---
Surely you have some way of tracking what players spend a lot of time in the wilderness fighting other players, participating in PvP. So only let those players with x amount of hours in PvP vote on changes to PvP (of course this wouldn't apply to PvP changes that would affect the game outside of the Wilderness).
---
So that's it? Every item has been found?
---
Crossbow with broad bolts you'll save gp and you can use the arma god book in offhand

---
I‚Äôm 100% in the same boat on this. 
---
Holy shit! They actually do care about their player base. 
---
he was not the first one.
---
It took jagex getting crabs to address an issue
---
You should still vote if the content sounds like it appeals or doesn't appeal to you
---
Assuming low def target, MSB + rune arrows will be higher DPS. 
---
Not quite, polls should only be intended as a level of interest by users.
---
75% = auto-accepted.
---
If a poll passed with say 50%, they would obviously be far more critical of whether it should enter the game than if it reached say 70%.
---
Generally polls receive large amounts of feedback and criticism, which the J-mods can take into consideration after poll release but before making a decision.
---
You really dug to find this comment lol 
---
I like this idea a lot 
---
can we please not change stuff that has been in the game for as long as it has existed lol
---
imagine being the 0.01% who uses this and logging on one day only to find out one of your pieces of gear now has an entirely different effect
---
I would welcome an RNG tag, then we could filter it out.
---
Congratulations! An infernal cape is an infernal cape, no matter how you got it.
---
However, I would like to suggest anybody reading this thread that they attempt the regular method instead. As easy as this tank method might be, spending one year inside the Inferno is not a fun experience. 
---
You will get the cape much faster if you actually try out all the prayer flicking techniques, and might even find it fun!
---
A very well made post jagex! :)
---
Are you the owner of the account?
---
It seems much more likely that he wanted to have this unique/meme account than someone actually preferring f2p to members.
---
After all, members has everything f2p has, just more.
---
This was after I loaded a maze random on mobile

If holding that button down is continuously clicking that's not allowed. But I cant even really tell what's going on here
---
I started playing last month, and i havent voted once (mostly cause i dont know what most the questions ask) but the ones i do understand and might wish to give my input on are already overwhelmingly voted on. when i see that the yes's have the question by over 30% i have 0 interest in voting on that whether my answer is yes or no. i dont get rewarded for it, which is fine, but i obviously dont think my vote will change much so i dont vote.
---
Maybe only people who have killed 10 - 15 different players can vote on PvP polls? Since OSRS was created I have only killed one person, and that was a bot. 
---
If I was a sweaty nerd who wanted to spoil PvP polls I might farm 15 kills with others, but that's a minority. Simple fix there. 
---
Knowing the internet some ass hats will pretend to be the kkk or some other autistic shit
---
From the wording, I am just glad that the poll results will NEVER be hidden.
---
I really like Jagex sticking to their guns and listening to the actual VOTERS in game that voted "NO TO HIDING POLL RESULTS" instead of a bunch of pathetic whiners on Reddit. 
---
Some objects you can't safe spot over, you just have to feel them out and find which ones work and which won't
---
&gt;  Polling is an incredibly important factor in what makes Old School the game it is. However, only a very small number of players actually vote in the content polls. Why? 
---
ill tell you exactly why i dont vote: because i see 80% votes on one thing so why would my vote matter
---
Whatever you guys do please don‚Äôt go back to the archaic chat filter
---
can 126's in max gear slam you if you make a new lvl 3 account in the perma dmm server?
---
Ensouled dragon heads with max gear and the new DHL makes for faster exp/hr and also cheaper cost then doing bones. 
---
That's true.  I'm just suspect about new weapons bc of burst potential and power creep.  I think there is enough variety than "new weapons" won't be a big enough sell.
---
I've seen so many posts about this but still don't understand what he's doing / what his goals are. Can someone give me an ELI5?

As I said on another comment, I got my starting money on Blast Furnace, then I moved on to Barrows and then on to Zulrah. Tell me which one of those I can AFK.
---
While that may be the case for some people imgaine that there's a poll of 20 questions and only 5 are relevant to you. If you see those 5 are passing with 90+% why would you waste your time voting and clicking "skip" on the other 15 when the 5 you want are going to pass. 
---
For the Feud I think you can run behind the fence with the camel in it
---
clearly it cant also be because the game was spanking new and attracted a lot of nostalgia-driven attention that only lasted a few weeks, while the influx of new players was also almost inexistent because there was no f2p at the time
---
no, clearly it's because there wasn't enough NEW SHINY CONTENT
---
There's already 3 amulets that give +10 so no they wouldn't.
---
Thanks
---
Nothing wrong with a little gambling.
---
Also use a total level world ya noob.
---
If you think polling an integrity change to the polling system is a reasonable action then you are retarded. 
---
I feel attacked
---
Fake!
---
You cant use alle godspells at the same time.
---
Maxing on a HCIM isn‚Äôt beating the game, getting all the items from ToB on a HCIM is beating the game. You can be a snowflake HCIM and max very easily.
---
Movie?
---
shiet I wonder if they'll actually unban my iron man that got hijacked now
---
&gt;Same principle here
---
Except not at all? New quests releasing moves the goalpost and you have to meet them. Until jagex adds level 120 and such officially, this argument is a moot point. You don't have to magically acquire new levels to wear the max cape again.
---
Then your hiscores should be also removed from the hc hiscores (as opposed to simple strike-out) and fransferred to the normal hiscores. Agree? I don't for sure.
---
The tank crab actually fken worked!!
---
Prehistoric
---
Can it run Crysis?
---
these kind of competitions favour tankier builds, dd'ing and glitch spotting.  
---
most of the existing PvP community has no interest in hybridding and limits their defence/attack level.
---
It took 8 guesses for me
---
Great fantastic 
---
Nobody wants unhidden poll results. Why would they ever move to another polling system that doesn‚Äôt hide them? The only valid concern maybe is the amount of work it would take. There are no other valid concerns. 
---
I didn't vote because i'm a returning player who doesn't really know any better, some of the poll questions i know very little about.  Just my 2 cents, i think a lot of other new players share my sentiment.
---
Just use a fury?
---
Seems to happen to me whenever I get logged out from a disconnect

&gt;The reason everyone wants poll results hidden is group theory.

Hiding poll results is not something that should be in consideration because there may be other motivations.  It is widely known that exposing poll results leads to skewed results due to the bandwagon effect.  Not hiding the poll results is just bad process, plain and simple.
---
I would never see that, I just log in and spam click the red box 
---
When I seen that "dispelling myths" I stopped for a second. C'mon Jagex, we wouldnt treat your customers support system like BIGFOOT or the LOCHNESS monster if we actually got to see it do something. 
---
I give them credit for actually responding to all this bullshit at once. 
---
Yeah in the end all we have so far are promises, but they‚Äôve acknowledged almost every issue that I personally have with the current state of OSRS. That, combined with the fact the team is actually growing, has me very optimistic for the future. 
---
In the end it could turn into another ‚ÄúWinter 2017‚Äù scenario but I‚Äôm going to give them the benefit of the doubt. These guys clearly love the game

With only a plain pizza, cheese, and wooden shield in your inventory and nothing equipped, go to the tree icon south of Varrock/East of the dark wizards. Go to the spot he's at and do the following emotes in order: Bow, Yes, Clap
---
Ah thanks
---
So what about ever other skill that you've got leveled up? Fuck off pleb
---
Actually a good idea 
---
It‚Äôs not that simple. When you click enter on your password you are immediately being put into the game. To change that would require engine work. They would have to make it to where you are put into a ‚Äúlobby‚Äù so your character doesn‚Äôt immediately spawn in while you‚Äôre voting on a poll. 
---
I disagree with this. Unrestricted worlds should not be year round. I‚Äôm okay with some sort of new or existing minigame to help people learn PvP though.
---
I agree
---
Over the long term obviously blowpipe is more expensive, but it would take a long time to spend 25m+ in zulrah scales. I'm mostly saying you're better off buying blowpipe and using rune crossbow for most things and putting the difference into scales than spending 6m on dragon crossbow or 30m on acb. I think sara gwd is only place I can think of where you absolutely need the extra accuracy of a better crossbow since people just chin arma now.
---
Really decent idea honestly. I think this would increase voting by a ton my dude
---
I really like this idea of more detailed feedback! Now if there was an easy solution to get a majority of people to share it...
---
I agree with you entirely there, power creep is a real issue and I think Jagex has actually done a pretty good job of providing VERY high value niche items like the Tbow that still keeps lower-tier gear reliable and expensive through raids. This should be a core goal that all updates attempt to achieve (new items without reducing purpose of old ones)
---
Additionally, I think the PVP update is actually a perfect example of how these updates should work:
---
\- Poll failed
---
\- Player concerns about PVP becoming 'easier'
---
\- Repoll'd with PVP specific changes
---
\- Passed with new poll BUT DID NOT MAKE THE GAME BETTER
---
Was this poll actually GOOD for the game? I don't think it was and here's why.
---
Jagex should have done:
---
\- Concerns raised around easyscape and PvP
---
\- Jagex should have sat down and actually critically assessed it.
---
\- Is this change going to make PvPer's quit? NO
---
\- Does this lower the barrier of entry enough that new Pkers would emerge? YES
---
\- Does separating the games UX/UI  between PvM and PvP make sense? NO
---
Now, depending on what our goals are this would have different results:
---
Do we want to get more people into PvP and revitalize it? Then yes, land this change
---
Do we want PvP to be an 'elite' mechanism based area? If so, probably don't land this poll, but if so, is it more important to bring new PvPers in or not?
---
Do we want the game mechanics to be different between PVP and PVM? ABSOLUTELY NOT, this only raises the barrier of entry and is only going to get worse the more of these 'seperate' UX changes come in.
---
So what ended up happening was PvM'ers got what they wanted, but the PvP community is now actually WORSE off, with people even less likely to pick up PVP now that the spec mechanics are different than what they are use to.
---
THIS is the problem, instead of unifying to a common goal for OSRS we let the communities scrabble over random issues they care about with no centralized direction.
---
This is going to kill runescape as it get's further and further, with certain communities pushing certain agendas.
---
The goals for OSRS should be simple:
---
\- Improve BAD mechanics that only exist due to legacy tech (i.e. resizing UI/UX, the fact this didn't pass a poll was insane, 3rd party clients can do it undetectably regardless, just let the main client be modernized to work on large screens)
---
\- Get NEW players, this is extremely important for long-term growth
---
\- Increase weapon diversity, i.e. different attack styles and viable defence options. This is good as it reduces the necessity for 'one item beats all' without reducing those items individual purpose and price.
---
\- Provide useful updates that don't ruin the 'oldschool' parts of the game, more high-effort high-reward skilling etc. The teams main concern should be 'filling in' missing parts.
---
\- Keep the economy what it is, diverse and complex, noted resource drops r bad
---
Now i'm not an expert but the above goals seem pretty straightforward and can easily be applied to polls and are something we can mostly agree on. It's then up to jagex to ensure that any new content does not deviate from the goals.
---
You dont want to just rip it off, that could cause more damage
---
I love when you can get some good east side/west side banter going
---
How much you loose? 
---
Yeah the items are still in game if you want to get them. They are good for ironmen/hcim cause tjey count as warm items
---
If that's the case then why do some polls fail at 70 to 74, yes there are people that vote like that, but there are also people who just vote yes to everything and no to everything. Polls have always been shown, people are only up in arms recently about it though. 
---
nice
---
You cared enough to respond four times but since you didn't like it when I demonstrated that you're not only objectively wrong but also an idiot so now you're acting like an actual child. 
---
P.S. How is it 'harassment' to respond to messages you're leaving me? Aren't you the harasser in this case, *if anyone is*? 
---
I'd assume anyone using the word "ableism" is either using it in jest and they're not worth arguing with, or they're using it seriously and they're not worth arguing with.
---
Ignore list exists for a reason stop crying
---
That's the correct location. South east of the stone circle but the items you can only have on you cheese, plain pizza and wooden sheild.
---
Bad for my f2p 1 def pure

What would stop the people who are driving and playing, from just tapping ‚Äúpassenger‚Äù? 
---
Looks like this scumbag watched that Nerd City video... Make the post look like it's not from you and say it's a family members artwork, etc. Such a shitty thing to do.
---
no way a rune long? shit dude grats
---
Do you have wildy diary done? If not, you can never hold more than 3. If you have mediums done you can hold 4. If you have hards done you can hold 5.
---
I think the simple answer is that wanting fixes and improvements to old content doesn't mean you are opposed to old content. For example, I'm all for seeing Prif in OSRS, but I'd also love to see Guild Improvements to the lackluster guilds. So I'm not going to vote against something I want in the hopes they do something else I want instead... If they said "if this new updates fails, we'll offer updates for X existing content instead" that would be different but at the moment there is no reason to assume they'd offer fixes to old content instead of some other new content.
---
That would look pretty nice!
---
I gotta agree, we've all grown up since RS2, we can handle bad words. The language filter is togglable and those who, quite understandably, don't want to see that noise can turn it on or mute players who are posting *****s.
---
I mean even in RS2 me and all my buddies used SwiftSwitch mostly for the IRC component, so we could talk how we wanted to. I still like to shit talk. I think saying the public chat has to be PG13 to avoid "toxicity" would be a mistake when there are so many methods already for players to avoid dingbats.
---
That said, the other side of the issue is people who harrass other players or promote hate speach are unacceptable anywhere. Possibly an informal poll of where players draw the lines would be useful because that way the community is picking the standard that they hold themselves to.
---
you could just hide results until the person votes.
---
Yes, I would consider a poll question about Callisto or something to be pvm and all players would be able to vote on it
---
Jesus Christ are you a troll? Ur blocked, although you're probably gonna write another essay cause you want to be right so badly (even though there is no wrong or right which was established in the second comment). Bye retard.

They literally just polled your Vorkath suggestion and it failed
---
Content that actually engages a player versus player interaction. Currently there is a predator vs pray situation going on which is actually causing friction between pvp'ers and non-pvp'ers. 
---
No one likes to die because they got 10v1'd or teleblocked for 5 minutes and repeatedly frozen in the wilderness with no chance to escape. As a pker I can imagine it being very lame to find no one or having an "easy" kill for a spade. 
---
If Jagex could somehow incentivize pker versus pker interaction I think pking would get more populair. The problem is what kind of incentives should be given to get people into pking? 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs making the decisions, they have to make money to stay in business.  If players actually wanted a game that didn‚Äôt break every other week and stopped playing as a result, they‚Äôd start investing money in it pretty fast.  Keep enabling their poor decisions with your attitude though, I‚Äôm sure they appreciate it
---
What are some challenges when it comes to developing art assets of any sort for a game like OSRS, since you probably can't follow any conventional standards for modern games to fit the oldschool aesthetic?

I have this crazy idea that might revolutionize your gameplay. If you don‚Äôt want to die from a pker, don‚Äôt go into the wilderness

You say fix but I see no issue with the polling system as is. The good updates pass, and in the case an update is shit then it doesn't pass.  It's worked perfectly fine since 2013.
---
&gt;I'm referring to scenarios in which pvmers who are not gear/statted/supplied for pking are doing wildy content, and are attacked by pkers.

But dude, like, everything goes in the wildy xD!

Max efficiency = no time for polls

Because it took me a long time and I'm proud of it. It's gotten a lot of upvotes too which means people like it. It's awesome that the reddit supports people who do cool things.

Doesnt 'require' 2b in gear. 2b in gear definitely makes it easier, but those who are mechanically skilled enough could easily do it with under 5m in gear lol. I've seen someone complete it, after like 26 attempts, with full void, ahrims staff, rcb and a blowpipe. He didn't have a main to practice on or anything, learned it all through his iron with only that gear.
---
Pornhub
---
NUT
---
What I mean by that is something like increasing bind/entangle times with mage pray up.  It's technically a pvp question but will hinder pvmers. 
---
think of the ge riots...Damn thats scary 
---
The main issue with that is people may just vote carelessly, in order to get the reward.
---
just pressing down vote after reading first 2 lines. pvmers making post is waste of time to read.

Do you think you could mock up a quick design with just a red trim on the normal ironman one like Kschl‚Äòs [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b2ylll/comment/eivyhn3) ?

They already word questions wacky and they have the choice of polling w/e they want.
---
Very nice my dude, currently working on the same goal. 
---
Nope, you're taking it way to far. For clues, I do think you should have to have done at least 1 clue scroll of ANY type. For quest-related questions, I think you should have to have at least 20 or something quest points (I think that's already a requirement to vote on polls maybe). The last one you said just didn't make sense but I would be fine if you needed to have at least 2 hours playtime in the last month in order to vote. 
---
If the only skills you‚Äôve trained are combat, you‚Äôre not allowed to vote on skilling polls then. A fair trade imo
---
I mean im a 124, ill always pick up something worth 10-20k, why not? 
---
I didn't but I see all these guys trying their luck and losing
---
I think it's a good idea to let F2P people have really old ass content like that, why not?
---
Cause it‚Äôs 10k
---
this \^\^ My family to this day years later still think that runescape is a computer destroyer hahaha
---
I hate it and love it
---
Ya it just sounds like an object you can't safespot behind.
---
Good luck brother
---
Think that had something to do with teleporting away in weird ways, right? 
---
That‚Äôs true
---
Thanks man! 
---
How do you see your loot like this? is it a runelite feature? 
---
Since when is doing time consuming things not hard?
---
I had my ignore list at max cus of all these spammers, remove the ability to type under 150 total or something?
---
Very few people have inferno capes, even now that Justiciar is available. Sure I'm not as good as people who can do the whole thing with no food/prayer, but to call anyone bad who gets the cape by any means is to be an elitist. This cape is hard by any means and very few people can get it.

It isn't hard though. People need to realise the difference between difficult things and time consuming. Its a grind. Nothing more. Nothing less. 
---
What's this point trying to make? You realize even every p2p pure has to do some skills since quests are required for build.
---
Who the fuck cares? They're both good watch what you want.
---
5 month old comment lol whut
---
Exactly, I have to remove everyone from my ignore list like every 4 days. 
---
How can you see?
---
it is haha. He is actually doing slayer right now, that is how he found out about the green dragons, because he was super excited when he got assigned them since he just recently became a member like I said and was f2p for years before eoc and all of that and just came back to the game. 
---
what was your full setup? im looking to do range from 88 and I'm lazy lol
---
For those of you wondering if this guy is scamming, I can get this shirt made for $13 in my garage on my DTG printer PM me if you actually want to buy one
---
You should ask op. I didnt create this version of the design.
---
I respect that you value your vote and i am the same way, I have also voted in every poll active while I was playing. 
---
Progress in this game is majorly based on the amount of time put into it. Many people work full time jobs and cannot dedicate large amounts of time so when they can see they are wasting their time voting on things guaranteed to pass they simply won't take the time to vote. In the blog jagex states that they see a large number of players not voting and want to change that. By hiding the poll results less players would feel as if their vote doesnt matter since they cant immediately see whether the question is guaranteed to pass or fail and would be more likely to take the time to vote. 
---
This game in general is easy. The hardest thing is probably inferno and even then people can manage it on like level 57 accounts. The challenge isnt about difficulty, it's about perseverance.
---
How do you plan on keeping track of players and player opinions outside of reddit and twitch?
---
We all know the fact that jagex doesn‚Äôt believe there are osrs players outside of social media, and thus specific social media sites like a single reddit page have an appalling amount of game influence (easily as much as the development team to be completely honest). When opinions get upvotes and that specifically makes them a priority for jagex for, years now, how will moving away from a social-media based development change this balance of player influence? I‚Äôve seen over half of kebos, for example, taken directly from reddit posts with almost no alterations. How will you be able to listen to the players in game when social media is already so loud and powerful? Are you planning on collecting player chats relevant to upcoming updates? Maybe expanding the player feedback option on logout from a single upvote to maybe a ‚Äúleave a comment‚Äù? Or maybe even make a real polling system that PLAYERS can influence and add suggestions too, instead of redditors posting on poll creation threads, or twitch chat making the q&amp;a crew promise ridiculous updates without any second thoughts just because they‚Äôre on a casual stream with little time to actually think about ideas.
---
I think the shift away from social media based development is the best thing in this blog, not that much was actually said in this blog.
---
I hope this was a result of the player surveys sent out last year that went into detail about your twitter and 2007scape usage, I would‚Äôve liked to think those actually mattered to someone 
---
Just stop flexing at the ge 
---
Don't they have in game message links that tell you when a new poll goes live? why can't they use the hyperlink from that to open the vote booth
---
You would be surprised Lmaoo. Lots of people do it. I‚Äôve caught myself doing it.  It‚Äôs called influence.
---
Yah I was about to say the same thing - with a dragonbone necklace and a bone crusher, I don't think it would be possible to die there at all. Even if you left the room to make dinner you'd still be safe. 
---
Perhaps a message in-game, 'click here to answer a question or something'
---
And mining,smithing,hunter etc
---
Another thing I'd like to see is getting a reminder while playing. Sure, you tell me right when I log in that there's a poll but I don't remember shit 10 minutes into my farm run. Trouble is nailing down how often you should be reminded. Maybe each time you're near a bank?
---
Just today I had the same thing happen with Tears of Guthix: Game told me it was available, I wrote down to do it and I still forgot. 
---
I absolutely agree, I was just linking in the only data that we currently have available on the topic. 
---
I'd be down for monthly updates to test the waters and see how that goes, maybe with more time to put into them, they can be well thought out and balanced.
---
Hot damn, that's good news dude. I owe you an apology, fair and square. Sorry, bud. 
---
I once try to recover my own account for fun
---
... I didn't had enough info for it
---
at least give a reason for your "NO" are you just anti ironman or think there are to many variants of the cape?
---
but i dont want to vote ingame? i want to play the game and vote while im doing slayer, for someone like me, it takes me quite a while to go through and vote and i often find i dont want to waste my time so i dont.
---
That's why i grinded for high total worlds
---
Tfw i had a zombie champ scroll drop as a newb amd didnt pick it up. Can i petition to jagex for it?
---
Cough cough mysterious invention perk in rs3
---
no ironman exclusive items, looks ect. 
---
I was going in a different direction with the QP cape comparison. Personally I would agree on removing the player from the hiscores because they lost the title and not just crossed off, but I guess I looked at things too extremely. There are still achievements within the game mode itself that doesn‚Äôt necessarily entail discrediting of one‚Äôs achievements. However, the mode in of itself is still a zero-sum, all or nothing game so signing up for it in the first place does entail certain bounds, otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt be what it is.
---
But there isn't a ranged amulet on the same tier. It's every noobs first amulet, sure, but they'll move on.
---
I don't believe we need a ranged amulet, and ranged is relatively OP anyway so maybe a +7 or 8 would be more balanced than +10, but amulet of accuracy being called "ranged gear" is pretty lame
---
You can literally read the questions before hand then do a quick vote when you bank..
---
The lazyness of the community amazes me. 
---
What are the recommended combat stats? 
---
r/woosh
---
I didn't intend to indicate that there were no external factors, and I'm all about toning down the frequency of updates. I just wanted to link in the only actual data that we have on the subject so that /u/borisosrs could take that into account while thinking through his idea.
---
Mate how do you track for so long tho? I have to restart runelite on update which resets the loot...
---
Zeah rc as well as a few other low-bank areas could use a poll booth 100% yeah, but that‚Äôs not really the issue here
---
We will call them Venezuelans. 
---
RS3 community is way friendlier...too bad osrs is better :/
---
Sir might I remind you that we pay, we say.
---
I always thought having anything polled should be kept confidential it just seems like common sense? People are easily influenced by others  and if the voter doesn't care about an update he could just see what everyone else is voting and just choose that without even knowing the  effect. 
---
But I don't understand why Jagex can't just give us one poll where the results are hidden and see how it works and if it doesn't we just go back to the old way until a better solution is found. I don't see the harm of even just trying to hide the results just for one poll.(not sure if this was done in the past) 
---
If only...
---
This is the best comment I think I've ever read on this site
---
Literally noone gets hacked through brute forcing. 
---
Til crafting is ftp now 
---
Seems like runecrafting fits your criteria. Whilst I'd usually recommend agility, runecrafting is far less click intensive and therefore far better suited for your needs.
---
Just explaining how voting works to the masses
---
There isn't much to say.  If you are p2p quest attack to 40 then go train strength and range.  You will be at a disadvantage for a bit because you trained hp with magic but it will be fine late game. 
---
Sysadmins and their downtime
---
Recently got 70, going to work for Mandarin hard then go to 80 at Seers
---
Ignore me I'm stupid lol
---
Respect 
---
Nice to see you were right this whole time. No idea why Jagex didn't lock the account in the first place. Your arguments that you had additional evidence, and the screenshots proving that the current account had malicious intention should have been enough to at least lock the account for a while.
---
JMods response wasn't very good. I mean, doing nothing about the hackers threats and THEN locking your friends account? They didn't handle it very well.
---
Pretty curious why they were so certain you weren't the original owner though. Would be nice to see their explanation of the situation.
---
Anyways, congrats on getting your account back.
---
Hahahaha thats pretty funny then ty
---
Player moderation. 
---
I'd love to see more player mods in game. They are practically don't even exist.
---
Oh man yeah you're right. I misread your comment. I'm sorry dude.
---
And what else could I possibly show? Look at the entire thing, with the screenshots of me talking to the hacker on my account. My account gets hacked, I post to reddit. I take screenshots of the guy on my account threatening to drop my untradeables. I ask for my account to get locked. My recovery gets denied. Mods say hacker is the original owner. People are saying he must have information that I don't, he must have created the account. All of which is false. 
---
I travel to the exact house and use the exact computer I used to create the account to make a new recovery request. It goes through. And now, what? You're accusing me of being the hacker, hacking a cleaned account? What sort of proof would even be proof in your eyes?
---
Leaking your full name lol
---
Because with a Hardcore themed cape it would make sense if you are still a Hardcore... Any account can max/get rare items so ofcourse you would keep xp/rares even if you were HC when you got them. No account aside from a fresh one can obtain HC status so why are you pairing a status symbol with xp?
---
The difference would be qualitative over quantitative. Voting now is just based off of the initial burst of numbers going into the vote whether it be yes or no, and most people will bandwagon on that initial burst. If results are hidden, the quality of the polls would increase because it eliminates the voting bias, and be a more accurate representation of what players actually want.
---
Guess what? Jagex can fix the results right now and no one would be any wiser
---
Get the fuck over yourself. Nobody owes you shit. 
---
The new characters are actually added by the community. If Akinator fails to guess your character (including after you keep selecting for it to continue trying) then it eventually gives you a form to fill out where you get to add them to the results.
---
source: have added characters to Akinator before
---
i swear to saradomin if you implement political parties because people are too lazy to vote on every little thing
---
Don't know if you are serious. But always welcome to send me a message/reply to this thread. I am happy to lend an ear.
---
Probably shouldn‚Äôt use Reddit for this 
---
My point is that nobody owes you an apology because you could just be on the account the same way you were to begin with, doesn‚Äôt mean you created the account. 
---
This doesn‚Äôt really seem like the blog that announces what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs a blog just to let us know they‚Äôre listening and let us know what they‚Äôre brainstorming about. I think it‚Äôs fair that they slow down and make sure they get everything right and make sure it what‚Äôs the player base wants, since that‚Äôs been a pillar of what OSRS stands for since its inception. 
---
Damn Brodaki is back for Drama Pt. 2 the boogaloo.
---
Lemme grab some popcorn and hold it down with you chap, this will be fun.
---
I've got a permabanned 16 yo account. Cause shit security and ease of hacking jagkek
---
Glad you got it back. I still believe that Jagex fucked up and honestly shouldve just locked the account the very least back then if two parties had so much info. Instead, they "smackdown" and the community jumps aboard with hate and now you lose your bank when they couldve just locked the acct. Pretty sad events overall. 
---
That jagex mod is a actual retard and I knew it. 
---
This exactly... That yindip is a moron lmao, why do anything on osrs is basically his argument since the game is not difficult. It's an accomplishment of dedication and great patience :) 
---
Might wanna cover your name up 
---
WHAT PART OF WE PAY, WE SAY DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND??
---
ever heard of buying gf? go sell that booty
---
Dopamine
---
Didn't they do that in RS3 at one point?
---
It should rely on skill, not bank. You shouldn‚Äôt have to break it to buy a 2 billion gold weapon. That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. 
---
i cant remember what all my answers are going to be and im not going to waste my time writing them down, then i might as well waste my time voting in bank when they logically could just make a place to vote on their website
---
Theres a "skip question" option
---
you sir are a genius and I am an idiot! Thank you very much 
---
What about having a faded cape for a dead maxed hcim and a brighter one for one who hasn‚Äôt died?
---
Why would any IM, single pker or casual player stick around ever? Swapping will just give normal players to make quick cash. 
---
Bad idea, we don't want people spamming random votes on every question just to get their free membership. People who genuinely don't care about the direction of the game shouldn't be given an incentive to vote.
---
Lmao
---
How‚Äôs the boss? I‚Äôve got 4 seeds, haven‚Äôt done it yet 
---
Why not just buff amulet of accuracy to +10 ranged bonus? This would put them on par with amulet of magic which gives +10 magic offense bonus.
---
Is there any discussion to updating the game client to include features things like runelite have? It would be nice to have counters for bosses such as bandos and little things like how much our banks are worth. I personally don't trust third party clients so I use the official client despite lacking features.
---
You know I still did the prayer flick method with blobs/rangers despite the fact that you think I'm terrible. I couldn't do 1 tick perfect blocks for everyone monster, but I still did most of the mechanics. I tried 79 times with ancestral doing the normal way, I only had to try 6 times with the justiciar method.
---
We must ask ourselves, what makes a game successful nowadays? Why are games like Fortnite, Pubg, apex legends so successful? What is the common defining factor between them that leads to their success?
---
Who knows, maybe we'll never find out.
---
Wouldn't the accounts be able to check if they're on the same world as other accounts, such as a sort of "host account" that just sits on a world idling, so that they would have a data point to reference to?
---
Skip question would still be an option. 
---
I got the heart at 11 kc, haven‚Äôt really done them since. Kind of a waste of time. 
---
The problem with this is that you have to address the issue of leechers. In BA 4/5 people have to do their part for the most part, whereas in Pest Control or wherever else you have people standing around feeding. Even if you include an activity meter that needs to be filled to a certain extent to trigger a roll for a pet chance. And then there's minigames like Castle Wars where there would always be people paying for wins/pets, the pet's prestige would be a joke.
---
hell no, if someone doesn't vote because they can't be fucked to go to any bank in runescape, I don't trust their vote.
---
the problem with we pay we say is that it goes back way.  Skillers will stop pvp updates and pvpers will stop skilling updates.  Like at this rate this game will never see a new skill, and will never see updates to mini games as well.
---
Unpopular opinion: Polling was a mistake and is destroying the game.
---
Voting works in a way where everyone gets a chance to say what they want. No mater how arbitrary the reason. 
---
Not my name, don't worry.
---
This is why Bo3 and Bo5 formats exist in a variety of other competitive games, especially card games (where cries of RNG reeee! are often heard.)
---
They are absolutely competitive formats, because at the end of the day the more skilled player will come out on top in the long run of the whole match or the whole tournament.
---
In a mismatch of skill, the skilled player in OSRS will still win every Bo5, all other things being equal. They might lose a round to a rambo spec or something, sure, but on the average they will prevail in the full match.
---
Oh! Something that would really help me out in terms of account security would be password manager integration for the game client. My passwords are non unique across my osrs accounts because I have to type and remember them all. For most other things, I avoid this by using a password manager.
---
It wasn't constant. I took breaks from it and did lots of tob and cox and stuff. I tried 79 times with the prayer flicking method using normal ancestral and such things. When I switched to the Justiciar method it only took me 6 attempts!
---
Thanks for the support man!
---
Pretty sure because OP said he had to travel and at the time he had to submit the recovery he was in another country other than the account creation country of origin and im guessing the hacker was actually in the county of origin so it didnt look good for OP.

[Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/uBzEEaV.png) It didn't work out as well as you'd think, so I took the chance to include a pair of much simpler solutions in which only the gems are recolored.
---
Surely this left wing outlet is correct in saying that the left wing polls were completely honest and not at all biased in their constant claiming that Hillary was going to win.
---
Nah I know how it feels to be proven right when everyone is against you. It feels satisfying as fuck. You're pissed because you were probably one of the people anticipating a "Jmod smackdown" and were proven wrong. 
---
Real shit, I couldnt play it. I love doing HC, but I couldnt get into UIM. I would watch the fuck out of that tho. It seems slow as hell, but thered certainly be some interesting tactics invented for the style.

Thx m8, he layeth in pepperonis now
---
I've done most of the content solo so far since coming back; barring shield of arrav, Heroes quest, and pest control.
---
I've read over the wiki guide and the in game tutorial but i still skipped over it because i couldn't handle the idea of being baggage instead of fulfilling my role for my team.
---
I think it would be pretty cool if they added introductory solo levels for beginners to ease into the roles. Reading/watching a guide is always different from performing it for yourself. 
---
Point and click game, there is no skills.  Only situational awareness and attention. 
---
Then why not post a picture about that?

Devalues Settled's Morytania-only UIM?

On questions like that I either do some research or click the skip question thing.

were you trying to do it on mobile or something

That;s the part I don't get when people complain. It's still a risk.

&gt;Please Jagex consider banning the use of any 3rd party client ~~in deadman mode tournaments.~~
---

---
You're not a hardcore so you shouldn't get to show off as one. No helm, no cape, no icon. Simple as that. Not complicated.
---
Gaining xp is not a bug, it is part of the game.
---
That depends. Do you want people complaining about the results immediately after making their choice? I think the "vote no on pvp polls" memery would still happen regardless because of justified PK salt but still.
---
I think it could work if we had everything else in addition to it. But I wouldn't want blind polling until we solve the participation and convenience issue, because those are the bigger issues imo. Unbiasing an already biased subset of the community does no one any favors.
---
It's been proven time and time again that 99% of the OPs are lying
---
yes! so annoying!
---
Most certainly a plug-in, is your low-detail on?

For best FPS I do this

Gpu on - (rendering on and expand screen loading to max)
---
FPS Control On - Fixed to 50fps 
---
Low-detail mode off 
---
You just described two skills that are prevalent in many video games.

He hasn't even tried.

Umm, it's called fashion sweetie. Maybe you've heard of it?
---
Didn‚Äôt even cover up his time stamps either, ez hack
---
Man hope you get your redemption. Counter file charges in karmacourt, etc. Best of luck.
---
I'll jump in on this - just to say I think this is down to a miscommunication with the blog.
---
I certainly hear you and the others in the team do too. We know the fact you can see the poll results means you feel it is pointless to vote - and that matches what people told me when I asked what reasons people have for not voting a couple month ago on the Q&amp;A too.
---
It's not the one exclusive reason though, and there's more problems with polls than just hiding / showing - we want to understand those too :).
---
Apologies it wasn't clear - I'd be blown away if anyone hasn't seen the amount of times you all have asked about hiding results and the explanations for why you want it done - the crabs have been everywhere :P.
---
Pretty sure it's allowed this dmm, to try and keep people around for the immunity period and hope some stick around after. 
---
Thanks =)
---
There was a bug in the game that made everyone's attack style change to attack and Jagex acknowledged the fact it was a bug. Ruined a lot of accounts in the process.
---
Im at 600 kc and no pet :(
---
Every line is a punch line
---
67 runecrafting that‚Äôs like 1 years worth. Don‚Äôt believe it. Gratz on pet tho
---
Is there a video of a full explaination for the last clue?
---
Literally nobody claimed Hillary was going to win? 538 predicted a 74% chance of her winning not a 100%. Unless you can find some statistical flaw in their methodology, you‚Äôre just denying facts for the sake of it. 
---
Yeah I made this sweet range 2her for the last few weeks. Pked for two hours and got 41 attack. I thought I was ok because I was ranging in rapid, like I always used to. Apparently my 2H was on attack. Rip account.
---
Part 3: beta worlds, you could even release content a week early on beta worlds, with invites to streamers, accounts over a certain total lvl, P Mods, etc.  Give players a chance to see what's coming through the community, let them discuss it before it hits the game.
---
Example: release content on beta world Monday, live stream for feedback later in the week, go live next week.  Builds hype, shows new content, starts discussion if streamers do it, etc.
---
veronica has sanitary legs
---
But they don't and the visible results are why. Instead of fighting human nature, we need to work around it. Insulting people won't solve the problem.

‚ÄúGuess I was right the whole time‚Äù is not a post that‚Äôs ‚Äújust for the record.‚Äù You don‚Äôt have to prove anything to anyone. You gave wrong info the first time, right info the second time. Congrats

How do runners tear you a new asshole? Lol

40Def for BGloves

Yeah, you had to change ALL of your attack styles in the game to whatever you wanted them to be, otherwise they will be on attack mode. So warning to double check all weapons that you might use if you have a pure-type of account.
---
On... mobile? 
---
He was being an ass about it for sure, but the nerd rage from certain parts of the community was really funny to me.

This triggers me. In osrs its 2 tiles wide and in this its 3

Eh em UIM Btw

Imagine one of your close friends getting an infernal cape after so long. Would you unironically say: ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me about a 2019 justiciar cape‚Äù?  
---
OP spent a long time in the Inferno and it‚Äôs a huge achievement. The logic behind saying OP is not a good pvmer, because other people are better is bad logic.  
---
Woox is the best player in the entire game, so if you‚Äôre not as good as him you‚Äôre bad at the game which would make everyone else bad at the game. 
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄWHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT MY CRABS NOWü¶Äü¶Ä

Studies also show people are more likely to pick the first option given. I say hide poll results and make "skip question" the first option above yes and no. 
---
i love you thank you so much!!! ive been looking for so long and it was right in my face!!! also if anyone else and reading this and has the same issue when you dissable the low detail make sure to log out and back in! 
---
Y u mad?
---
I think what they're saying is that it isnt ranged-oriented gear. 
---
Is the large number of non-voters due to bots or gold farmers?
---
Fair.
---
The points against showing them still stand though, so now they're just actively saying they won't improve poll integrity, which might be worse than ignoring it.
---
How are people still playing rsc if its shut down? 
---
Gotcha 
---
Waiting for a JMod reply on this thread :)
---
thought that was pikachu faceplanting on a tank crab
---
This is gold!!
---
Depends on the Pk poll, I usually vote no for the sole fact that most people who pk me are assholes. I know I‚Äôm in the wildy and I don‚Äôt mind dying but when they are toxic while doing it, I don‚Äôt see the point in giving them more things they don‚Äôt deserve.
---
Nobody order the cheese pizza
---
I don‚Äôt vote because I have 1 account , so in theory if someone who thinks differently than me and have 5 accounts. It would take 5 of me and only 1 of them to manage a vote. Until jagex can limit to 1 vote per IP. The system is flawed in itself because it doesn‚Äôt represent a true community. It lets the rich get what they want basicslly
---
Hmm nothing about group iron Man 
---
Why defensive casting and not regular casting?
---
Congrats p u s s yv
---
I use amulet of defence for abyss running.
---
yea true, i was thinking about the convenience.  
---
Exactly. I consider my account late-game but even then, a huge amount of the polls are of of content I'm not even at yet. I can make educated opinions on them but I tend to skip questions that I wouldn't be able to explain my reasoning for answering if I was asked. 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/7/71/Graceful_outfit_equipped_v1.png
---
I'd like to mention something they said. They would like to fully understand why we want hidden polls. From what I understand people want hidden polls, so that people do not just see that one thing is winning and then choose to not vote. 
---
What is the PvP clan reference about?
---
Yeah, reading their initial message about the hacker being the original creator was surprising to me too. Because he didn't create the account. Not sure what else to say about that. I don't know why they thought that so definitively, given the evidence in front of them. I didn't play my hand perfectly, and I am probably at fault for compromising my own security to an extent, but I don't see how they could have come to that conclusion.
---
I would definitely take some time to play this for a bit, albeit here and there. Think it would be super fun though
---
It‚Äôs a tank method though
---
That's what he's saying with the orb. I'd call it like more of a zone that you can put your finger in that doesn't register it as a click in the game world but rather tells the game that for as long as there is an input in that zone, the next simultaneous input in the game world is a right-click rather than a left click. 
---
\^ This reason I do not bother voting as most time you can clearly see its manipulated by clans. Anyhows.
---
Except you need everyone to do it, 1 vote means shit. 
---
Could try corp duos or joining the corp ffa cc and doing that.
---
You are a moron though. You want to side with the decision that Jagex made but now they‚Äôve rescinded it and you‚Äôre saying that doesn‚Äôt prove anything. Also do you go shouting your total level wherever you go to feel validated in sharing your thoughts with other people? How long did it take you to reach this level of degeneracy? 
---
About 40 attempts in I decided to learn only one Zulrah pattern. After that it was easy 
---
&gt; I knew you were telling the truth just based on the lengths you went to get your account unbanned, it was pretty obvious. No one that knew they were wrong would continue to push it so far.
---
You definitely haven't been here long enough if you saying this. 
---
Rs3 account deleted on death is optional and you can buy an item that prevents the account being deleted for like 100k.
---
RS3 also has this.

&gt; Finally, hardcore ironmen can also purchase¬†[divine coins](https://runescape.wiki/w/Divine_coin)¬†from Mr Ex. These grant the player one extra life each, allowing them to die without losing hardcore mode. He only sells two coins: the first requires 1,000 total level and costs 100,000 coins; the second requires 1,600 total level and costs 10 million coins.

Ah good to know! Thanks.

also if you keep clicking on the first link in the body of a wikipedia page (not including links in italics or parentheses), you almost always eventually reach "Philosophy"

I am seeing ALOT of talk about  how jmod smack downs are bad and stuff.  but please hear me out,
---
  i know in this case it may have not been right.   but.... I LIVE for jmod smackdowns  and without them i would go into a depression so deep that it could only be cured for about 15 minutes every Wednesday  before slipping back in.  I NEED jmod smackdowns.   and if there is any further talk about stopping them.   i will john F Kennedy your ass.   
---
Thank you,
---
Up till 2007 it was fine.  It all went down hill when they took away free trade when they were forced to deal with the botting problem.  Too many people bought gold, had their credit cards stolen to buy membership to make more bots to get gold to sell.  Credit card companies threatened to cut jagex off.
---
Re: Computerphile, I'd be very surprised if Jagex is using anything more secure than MD5 or SHA1. 
---
Jagex support is infuriating, the fact you need a popular Reddit post to get acknowledged is bad enough but this community actively encourages to embarrass people.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of Doritos 
---
&gt; I know I‚Äôm in the wildy and I don‚Äôt mind dying but when they are toxic while doing it, I don‚Äôt see the point in giving them more things they don‚Äôt deserve.
---
This is like basing all people who do slayer on the 7 times you've been crashed at dust devils.
---
so is bandos, except you're not going to be splashing 8 million times

Easily in context to avoiding death. Aka HCIM who doesn‚Äôt do PVM.

The mobile gaming industry is a billion $ industry. There are TONS of "actual games" (what does this even mean?) on mobile that are thriving.

Don't be the angsty teen gamer who tells everyone "apple product aren't meant for gaming".

THANK YOU
---
but.. that's all that pvming is about? :'(
---
It will be placed in your bag or bank
---
Getting to 77 sucks though. I feel like I don't remember anything outside the ZMI altar. It's all I know.
---
I think its alright if the options have been considered and found unsuitable. I think what most of us want is just more open communication in general
---
Speaking for myself at least, as somebody who rarely votes, it has 0% to do with knowing the result, and 100% with not caring enough and being most of the time.
---
Like, I don't fucking click the booth, so the results are hidden to *me*. This reddit circlejerk is retarded.
---
Elite challenge clue scroll steps absolutely suck because I always forget that for whatever reason, you don't talk to the NPC to answer them. 
---
Yeah but have you seen the gramphics even?
---
Gimme more
---
Never o b s o l e t e
---
congratulations lad
---
Happy 6th Birthday OSRS! Can't believe its that long.
---
Is there any plans on rebuilding the OSRS engine? I can only imagine the difficulty and frustration the devs must have when working with this engine. It's been 6 years, Jagex. You can't put it off forever.
---
Allow us to copy and paste our account login details. Some, or most, of us have multiple accounts and it can be annoying having to manually enter all our details over and over. Shouldn't be a security issue if there is limit on the number of incorrect logins in place.
---
Will the password rework allow of unrestricted lengths and symbols? In general, I'd like to have at least 32 bit passwords.
---
Not that long ago I had a similar problem where I had authentication on my account and the phone I used for the authenticator broke, so I got locked out of my account, and I couldn‚Äôt reset it through email either since the email I made my account with was no longer working. So I ended up sending in a account recover thing which surprisingly worked.  
---
How many brews/restores did you bring with this setup and was it only one range pot? Were you also using dragon darts for all attempts? 
---
Imagine not knowing the truth behind this photo, nice try OP
---
Its so bad getting to 77 in the first place. 
---
It might make more sense in PvP worlds then. No assigned targets, but everyone has a hidden elo calculated off some metrics. 
---
Idk man just some ideas
---
Oh wow nice! How did you know? Did you just keep logging in to check or did you get contacted somehow? My hope is that I'll try to log in sometime soon and it works again, but it's not looking like it atm!
---
what do they need to get rid of them for
---
What about a kalphite king for a more melee and magic centered fight?
---
There are two yews right outside the bank which are the closest in the game. They are usually busy. Its not dangerous because you can safespot the bank in 5 steps.
---
Canifis is best for marks of grace, but if you're 20 levels above the required level for ANY rooftop course, you get decreased marks of grace. Next best place is probably Seers village with hard(?) diary completed.
---
Soooo they limit themselves to have more fun Pking?
---
Ayyy my rsn is Anime Lewds, we homies now üòâ
---
wait a minute,  why did you say that,  why does it need infinite to be math.    i r not good at math   and what you said is crazy to me
---
plz explain. ty :\]
---
Unfortunately that bug took place WEEKS ago, as well as a disclaimer on the update blog post and a disclaimer when you logged in. However, there was a bug with staffs granting so in a stat different than the selected combat style, for that jagex had a link you could enter your username and they would look into it and rectify it. That link has since closed.
---
This literally happened like over a month ago, so you are way behind. 
---
Relooged, changed worlds and restarted my game, nothing fixed it
---
Yes, it‚Äôs very inconsistent. And if they‚Äôre doing a TT update, they can update this aswell I guess..
---
Sounds like you are assuming that many people who didn't otherwise vote are going to vote for the same option.. I wouldn't expect the yes/no percentage to change much if the non-voters suddenly voted. It isn't only going to be redditors that start voting
---
Bruh d legs and bcp for days. He‚Äôs better spending his time at barrows grinding toward tassets than at barb assault fumbling his way to torso. 
---
They do occasionally, though it doesn't look like they ever learn from it moving forward 
---
So anti racist people committed a racist attack on Hindu culture big oooofff there
---
What about adding EOC combat system?
---
Yeah the thing is i want to make a completely new account, forget about this mage one.  I was looking for a "from scratch" guide. 
---
What has been polled that would have affected botters? 
---
I would vote to remove polls, as a pker I don't see the value in them if the pvm community is going to be toxic. 
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. 
---
BuT iTs NOt?
---
Yeah the most prominent reason for me missing a poll is logging into seeing a poll is running, thinking to myself to remember to vote, and then forgetting or never going within 10 squares of a polling booth. If they moved the crafting guild booth to the middle of the mine i would actually see it from my camera angle on teleport and would remember to vote... or they could do this.
---
The reason I didn't vote this time around was because I saw the results on a youtube video and didn't even bother walking all the way over there to cast my own.
---
So basically what I‚Äôve gathered from this is that poll results are never going to be hidden
---
lol
---
This is a good idea.
---
The only acc type I see being affected are some very, very niche obby mauler builds but the 79 range requirement of the bow makes any of those that would be affected very rare. Essntially any pure can get the requirements for this in principle.
---
You and I have a very different definition of best strategy then. My definition is not "the hardest way".
---
Gross af...
---
Yeah... this sub is pretty toxic and complete hivemind when it comes to, well, just about everything. People see what others are saying then hop on the train. Play osrs and dont pay much attention to the sub. I'm glad you got your account back. I remember the thread but I didnt comment.

Wow

Whats thats gear? 
---
Weird that yours didn‚Äôt include a crude wooden chair and a rope 
---
This is cringe as fuck, and most importantly pretty wrong. Delete. 
---
Its hard to judge the morality of it. Yes crashing is douchey as fuck but if its a multi combat zone can you REALLY call dibs just because you was there first? Ive been crashed at everything from rock crabs to iron rocks from 2004 to 2008 and it always just felt like part of the game. The shitty part of the game. 
---
Biggest scam in history
---
Great stuff mate!    
---
Hopefully this embarrassment will cause changes in Jmod protocols.
---
Same tbh.  I get why it was put in at the start but its lived past its usefulness.  Polling is mostly a formality at this point anyways since most questions Jagex just revises via feedback until people are happy enough for them to poll it
---
I haven't watched that but that scene looks fucked up
---
August was a random time, i tried to make that clear cause i knew you would respond with this. Since it wasnt clear enough: August was a random assumption. If they hired them in like october, the new devs would just now be given their own projects to work on, we wouldnt see their work until april or may.
---
4 months training -&gt; 2 months project -&gt; 6 months from hire date before we see any new work from a dev from

Set bonus is 50% of why graceful is good, no one's wearing just graceful boots out here. You either go all they way graceful or no graceful at all.  Lightness is for low-level accs

Ironmen be like "PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
---
I killed him in 2 tries for the diary without learning a damn thing.  To be fair I'm 99 range and 90 defense so that definitely helped, but still.  All I did was watch one youtube guide and paused it at an image that showed his (4?) different rotations, and glanced over at it intermittently during the kill to quickly figure out where I was supposed to be standing next, and what style I was supposed to be hitting with him next.  Only takes like 3 phases or something to figure out which rotation you're on, then you just hammer him.  I wonder which one of us had the more typical experience.
---
If they don‚Äôt it means their post today about how they are going to be more open and transparent about customer support changes was total bullshit 
---
Legit said it 5 seconds after I got it I was like uh, yeah.. you know.. just a bow. Nothing special
---
You gotta be trolling. You basically just dismissed anybody who plays an instrument as unskilled because knowing a song by heart is just "muscle memory"
---
I think you guys need to seriously consider polling brackets of some sort. Runescape (RS3) recently did a poll where they split the question between people with the Comp Cape and people without it - I feel like heading in that direction for OSRS is the way to go. 
---
Never lock people out of voting, but look at how people with say, 100+ combined Bounty Hunter score vote compared to people with no Bounty Hunter score at all. If you can track it, look at how people with most achievement diaries completed vote compared to people with relatively few of them. Maybe look at how people with 100+ kills at each godwars boss vote compared to people with fewer. Things like that. 
---
I think it would help combat "spite" voting if you were more aware of which sections of the playerbase were voting for/against specific content, and it'd also maybe help with balancing. For example, I saw that a lot of people were concerned that Divine would become the meta tank shield for PvP, but if PvPers weren't voting no, is that really a problem?
---
I'll trust you when I can trust politicians
---
Can we get superior black demons???
---
But that doesn't explain how reanimating ensouled dragon heads with max gear is cheaper than dragon bones on a chaos altar. Ensouled heads are *always* ~6 GP/XP, regardless of the gear you're wearing. Dragon bones on a chaos altar average to being ~4.5 GP/XP. You can't use gear to alter these numbers as far as I know. So dragon bones on the chaos is cheaper than ensouled dragon heads, regardless of gear. Gear would make reanimated dragon kills faster, but wouldn't make reanimation cheaper.
---
Yiu are more likely to win the lottery than that happening. It cant be real

I used to sell them one at a time so my level 4 herblore ass knew which unids to keep üòÇ

Sounds cool, but the times they tried similar things in rs3 weren't popular.

---
JAGEXS BAD SUPPORT IS A MYTH
---
They could've thrown us a bone back then, though. Nothing like staying silent for several months, even actively telling people on Q&amp;A threads to talk about other things to give no one hope of any change. 
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä Now what am I supposed to say?ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Glad you got your account back man, the whole thread seemed strange at the time, why would the original account owner be blackmail and wanting to drop everything? There was no reason not to lock it after the behaviour you proved in screenshots.
---
/u/mod_sween
---
This is a prime example of concern about player support from your recent blog.
---
The way brodakai was treated in the last thread by 2 different jmods was disgusting. Even if the account wasn't his, he proved malicious intent and blackmail, it should have been locked to be investigated, but /u/mod_acorn and /u/mod_weath were more concerned with public humiliation in the form of a "smackdown" to appease the community.
---
Now it turns out they were dead wrong? Almost any other country of your size, HR would be reaming said employees out by now.
---
&gt;:)
---
If you thought this was a major grind that felt utterly long, this game might not be for you.. Gratz on the graceful set though! Very useful to have :)
---
It does not. But it does stack with the salve ammy and void armor.
---
Haha, me and my mid-level Ironman is fucked then!
---
What are the most vital pieces of equipment for inferno?

ok now this comment is halal

 For everyone saying it‚Äôs fake
---
No, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't acknowledge when they open dialogue with us on issues we have. They do a much better job than most game Devs in that respect.
---
Ah i remember when people thought that would fix it
---
I see /u/OsrsNeedsF2P i upvote
---
But it‚Äôs impossible piking on mobile 
---
Then all on pc have f keys...
---
Even with context its wrong
---
Nice. I did my first firecape at 93 ranged with rigour and elite void and i only had 2 brew doses left so you're a better jadder than me üòÇ
---
Nmy phone gets 100 degrees aswell. How do you change the fps? 
---
they should hide the votes % until the poll is done
---
why would i even care to vote on something that is at 93% yes?
---
there is no point in it
---
it is so right it is wrong
---
I'm not sure if they changed Jad or something. I remember that when RS3 changed overhead prayers to only reduce damage by 50% they made an exception for Jad, so I assumed beating him in oldschool would be just as easy on RS3, but the timings for prayers definitely feel more strict.
---
Yes, except it's a little bit more than 0.0000000000000002s to move your mouse to each "skip question" button, no? 
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä JMODS WON‚ÄôT REPLY TO THIS THREAD ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Lmao, gratz on the tbow tho :)
---
&gt;revenue up
---
&gt;players up
---
&gt;all without significantly more investment in the game
---
I‚Äôm not sure if salve ammy stacks additively or multiplicatively with DHCB. I guess regardless it‚Äôs only a .5% difference in favor of salve and DHCB. Including the fact you can use void with salve and DHCB it will bring your total bonus to 62.5% over the 49.5% from DHCB and slayer helm.
---
There's not even a cannonball in there, you're just doing this for attention /s
---
They‚Äôre so fucking easy. Get over yourself 
---
Mad respect for pushing through the toxicity like Swampletics in the bog. Jagex screwed you for sure.
---
Nigga, have you ever even played any holiday event? Don't talk about precedents before you see those items

Jagex won't respond because they have a tiny pp.

Yo hand me that t bow and see what happens 
---
Ive been runecrafting for 4 months straight wym
---
Really enjoying the content.  Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the sped up gameplay in this one though.
---
they're brown
---
You can literally safespot them
---
Wyverns are great. Why would you skip them? Sounds like you should bite the bullet.
---
The anti-fire shield requiring (starting) Dragon Slayer was a big one recently. Bots went to the polls in droves to vote no one that one. There were screenshots of masses of accounts with names like ASXIUVLKUIOA at poll booths.
---
As an UIM I thank you on behalf of all of us.
---
If it's split 60% to 40% you don't have a million with you.
---
I don't know much about inferno but definitely interested in trying it at some point.  What is the "normal" solution to being flanked/simultaneously attacked?

RemindME! 6 hours "Check for jmod reply"

Sell all your shit and margin flip. Only need to come back every couple hours

*the sack is full*
---
Besides the taverly dungeon blue dragon shortcut, what are some important shortcuts to unlock? Currently in the early stage of my ironman and 71 agility, need an incentive to train further
---
u have to kill like 25 wyverns which is 1 trip lmfao and theyre profitable
---
is it just me or does the one on the right look like the female model
---
Great, thanks!
---
You get 25 charges per token, so 2560 for 64k bones. Obv still a lot, but way less hah
---
Wait, so are they polite or pricks.  I'm confused. 
---
You can't prove that more people would vote if poll results were hidden. But that's a moot point. What's important is that you can't prove that any poll would have swung if poll results were hidden, because that wouldn't happen
---
&gt;Jagex_Weath ‚Ä¢ 1,170 points ‚Ä¢ submitted 8 days ago

I've double checked and can confirm that the account is now back with the original account creator. It looks as though the other account that you took the screenshot with also wasn't created by you so that too has been secured for the original owner to recover.
---
yahoooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
With Max stats and bis gear i can kill 50 in a trip. On my iron i range them which means infinite kc because u can safespot them
---
Because the game mode is objectively worse by every angle.

RIP in advance to all the good suggestions that won't get read.

If I was trolling I wouldn‚Äôt be being serious.  But yes, you‚Äôre ‚Äúa fucking retard‚Äù.

You missed the whole point my dude
---
cant tell if for real
---
Please talk about any ui improvements (if any) to mobile. Especially the part about huge ass text boxes and the fact that you can't see the info for spec attacks.
---
Its a mmo better get used to it. Anyone  with better stats and gear deserves to get the kill. It has always been part of the game. 
---
Another story is if they personally world hop and grief you.

None of them have a response nearly that negative so I can tell that you didn't actually check

Closing your eyes does not make something go away.

Bad for the game is bad for the game. Racism is bad for the social aspect of the game as a whole. MTX, racism, botting, scamming, impersonating mods, etc is all bad for the game and should not be allowed.
---
I'll *just ignore it tho* when they take it out of the ToS
---
All that will happen is clans will camp there all day and charge people to get in. Then you‚Äôll come back here and moan again.
---
If you make it an instance the bandos uniques will crash, as more people can kill so oversupply and this will have a knock on effect and disrupt the economy.
---
It‚Äôs a shit part of the game, but it‚Äôs a key element. 
---
To be fair, both taking 85 attempts and using justiciar means he‚Äôs quite shit at the game in general. 
---
Thanks! :)
---
Please Add an authentication Delay 
---
That part was hilarious. The excuses people were coming up with for why the original account owner would be talking like a dickbag hacker threatening to drop items and finesse their way into the bank. 
---
Sad this guy lost his entire bank because Jmods made mistakes. 
---
/r/brainlet
---
Really good people can do it in like 2 hours. But first attempts are usually like 3 hours. I realized I was low on prayer so I waited for 9 sgs specs to get up to 99 prayer 2 waves before the first jad lol.

Did you just make this up? Anyone who knows him knows he's not like that.

What about those poor contest winners that no one seems to remember?

I just did it with one stamina and 2 ppots, super easy with 99 range and diamond bolts, I rather this method since I take way less damage :D

Good to know I can farm skotizo now

Oof, tbow and ely...

Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee

can the charter ship interface be update for mobile? currently it's hard to press some of the karamja areas.

Honestly can't even imagine how much personal harassment you had because of Jagex's mistakes. You deserve a personal apology from them (/u/Jagex_Weath /u/JagexAcorn).

---
Inb4 the ctc2 solver tries to start a youtube career and make each video about vague clues they pulled out of their ass so they can be relevant for as long as possible. Just like ctc1
---
part of the game, if it was easy to get bandos rooms the gear would crash and no one would be there.  
---
Man I don't know haha which is why I would die in those situations. But with Justiciar and ely you just run to the south pillar and safe spot them all. The melee will dig straight to you so you never have to deal with him while other monsters are attacking you.
---
is it better than using other armor?
---
It's much better than a phone. Bigger screen for my sauage fingers. 
---
The best part of this is a hood instead of the awful helmet
---
The internet is weird, my gut reaction was that you were telling the truth but with all the witch hunting and the "Jmod Smackdown" thing I thought "How could everyone be wrong?" And changed my opinion. I kept reading into your points and I did say that if [it really was your account you would be vindicated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/azr15o/making_a_reddit_post_to_recover_an_account_that/ei9qred/?context=3) But yeah sucks to be on the receiving end of so much hate. I hope this doesn't ruin your time with runescape or the community too much. All the best Brodaki. I also saw your original posts have been taken down so I thought you were banned in this sub. 
---
Doing it the justiciar way doesn‚Äôt teach you to understand mechanics. It‚Äôs just brute forcing it and hoping you get lucky to tank hits. That‚Äôs why most people talk down on the method. I‚Äôd rather learn how the monsters work and deal with them properly
---
What do you expect him to do? He removed it from the public chat as fast as possible, do you want him to cry about it? You realize that's what every streamer deals with, yeah? How about you get off your personal hate train towards him and focus your energy for something more useful

There was a guy here a week ago got like 3 of them in 100kc or something

This big announcement has not offered anything to pvp as it currently stands , please change the mindset of pvp updates being only DMM
---
So racist jokes are bad for the game? Plenty of people equate dark humor with racism. Would you say that we should ban edgy humor?
---
Most people aren't offended by edgy humor. SJWs, like yourself, are bad for the game. People who advocate for anything besides freedom and personal responsibility, are bad for the game. 
---
Companies should let us tweak what we want to see to our own liking. There are things I dislike seeing, I block the people who say them. I don't try to force the company to make them stop existing. 
---
If you are an adult, you can just as easily click the ignore button as me. But let me guess... That's "ableist" right? Hope I didn't offend anyone. LMFAO.
---
I can't think of a single polling system besides OSRS where results are shown before you even vote. Imagine was election voting would be like if we could see who's winning before we even vote. Still shitty, but even worse.

Yeah that guy isn't in Oblivion, He's 123 combat. I followed him BECAUSE he has Oblv in his name and isn't Oblivion, you can even see me typing out "whats going on here" then he says that and I instantly put him on my ignore and the laugh isn't one laughing because of what he said it's because of how out of the blue it was.

If anything it shows that there old systems dont keep as good of track as everything as they claim they do.

most is just doublespeak, I'm surprised most people seem to be pacified by this
---
I think it's a fair assumption to make in &lt;currentyear&gt;

Your content is incredibly funny and I love your sense of humor. Looking forward to seeing more videos.

Yeah this is actually a big issue. We need to get this popular so Jmods have to reply. They were so confident and yet they were wrong. What does that say about the future of your account security?

Which, and I've said it before, is interesting that the worst part of the RC grind is actually in the mid levels.
---
It's a unique characteristic of Runecrafting which I feel is fine as is.

Sorry Freddo I don't have time to watch the vid so I can only comment on the title and what this conversation is.

if you hear us then why havent you done it yet. itd take like 10 mins of someones time. its so easy but you just give us bullshit answers like this. you dont need to understand and be able to fix all the issues in one go or we'll be here till the end of  time. you dont even discuss when you reply. you give one half soaked reply then hide till the thread dies. we all know theres plenty of issues with the polls, so fix an easy one now before we all get fed up and your brilliant game dies because we think the devolpers arent doing anything to fix stuff.

Hom3r is still in the clan

His story adds up and he has the account back. Jmods were wrong, it happens. Quit being mad because you were wrong.

Jagex is so full of shit when they reply to threads like this, amazing that anyone takes their word for anything after all the shit that has happened
