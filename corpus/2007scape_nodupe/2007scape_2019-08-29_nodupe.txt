&gt; T bow replaces blowpipe, sanguin replaces trident. Neitz faceguard replaces serp. Simples. 
---

---
You're really *really* obtuse if you don't recognize how obviously different the faceguard is from the tbow and sang staff.
---
---
---
Yes, please, buy all 1b each
---
You don’t think you could run and get your gear within 5 minuites?  Not only that, I almost NEVER dc. Infact i dc’d for the first time in 3 years on friday. And I didnt even die. Its just such a lazy excuse anymore. infact im willing to bet that only about 1-2% of deaths are from dc’s.
---
Or even split it up into something like a "Vault" for your POH. It would make sense to have two "banks" - one legit one and one stash at your house.
---
You could even put it behind a long quest a la Recipe for Disaster as another important mid-game account goal. I think it would be cool to build towards unlocking your second bank alongside working towards Barrows Gloves, both are really big upgrades that lead you through tons of early content and help start to open up some of the mid-late game content.
---
Obviously he wouldn't pay more than one bounty, but if he's no longer offering the rcbow bounty, he shouldn't advertise it.
---
Thing is, if he wants to keep it a secret he managed to get one, then he can't drop the offer. I honestly didn't thoroughly read the discord rules, so if he specifies only the first one gets the bounty and all others might be ineligible without previous warning, then that's fine. But if he keeps advertising the 1b bounty and didn't make that remark, then he would be offering more than he plans to pay. People would expect the scout fee plus the chance of the bounty, and only be eligible for the fee.
---
Get my point?
---
I’m about 100 chests in and have only managed a Verac’s Brassard. Good for you man!
---
You forgot the bragging about it in game and admitting to being attracted to 14 year olds all in the span of like 3 hours
---
Konar is better profit
---
Just did one of these, used about 200 amethyst arrows
---
Dude I have such an issue with this. I've already cleared my bank with the Wise Old Man, but I'm stupid and i legit still have a huge stack of like random seeds , random armor sets like mithril and bronze , just stupid shit. What traumatizes me is I've literally sold "junk" from my bank , only to come across a quest or something else that requires the item. I have 780/808 bank slots filled right now. I cry every time i open my bank, but i need to set a pin finally and get a few more slots at least
---
quests in runescape are probably some of the best ive seen in any game as they are not just silly kill or fetch quests but an actual adventure
---
This. Time to unironically delete non-bis max capes. It’s time.
---
Gotcha.
---
If you don't skull, you don't risk anything at all from your bank. The idea is to make it more enticing to attack other skulled player as opposed to picking on skillers/PvMers which keeps the community divided and voting down any PvP updates.
---
Just make your desktop something that relates to having a normal and attractive girlfriend or healthy social life. "Me trying to explain what it's like to not be an RS mod"
---
*prerequisite
---
Requires 99 Runecrafting*
---
 I'm a chick, just a loserish one
---
People like you need to fuck off to /r/runescape
---
You’ll be regretting that statement
---
Not really. Mass reports can trigger the system and auto mute you.
---
Got muted for saying “fuck warding” several times the day it failed. I guess according to this subs reaction that day however, that is ‘truly vile’ lmao.
---
I feel this on a personal level, mostly because the sense of accomplishment I get out of life isn't from work but through video games, so I half ass life but then put that effort into video games. It makes me feel good but real life doesn't exactly work that way, huh? :(
---
They have 2 years of updates already planned with raids and battlegrounds. They also have 50x the player base of osrs, so even if the game "dies" it will still have been a huge success for at least the planned 2 years.
---
Woodcutting then.
---
One of the more unique osrs content guys. Always get a good laugh from the vids. Keep it up 25BH
---
Would you mind linking it for me? I was looking to see if they had actually announced and planned anything.
---
I know I got 25% confused with 25k I already said it was my bad. Lmao everyone’s so tight over this.
---
For sure dude
---
just sucks they refuse to add good rewards to something that actually takes skill in this game so its gonna die so fast
---
&gt; The +1 strength difference won't equate to a max hit in most scenarios, and it's weaker in defense. Where on earth do you think this becomes "bis" all over the place?
---
Because of your previously stated advantages. Magic def, prayer, and no penalty to range/mage, plus it being cheaper.
---
Right now, serp is still often better than neitz because of the extra max hit and the defense. If you now make the max hits equal, with neitznot even being better with some setups, a patch up neitznot's defenses with +4/+5 all around, it would probably push neitznot over the edge in most scenarios.
---
Am I the only cunt who fucking despises RS quests? Tedious bullshit.
---
I mean, the sparkles aren't great, bit it is gets kinda difficult to differentiate potions once each color has so many unique effects. It's just the fact they have to work with a static 2d picture rather than something more telling. maybe a godray shining on the bottle or some other surrounding effect would better fit the name scheme and differentiate from holy water. The main problem is definitely the size though.
---

The discord constantly reminds people that it’s possible that the 1b bounty isn’t available. I’d wager to say that almost everyone there is hunting imps to help the series. People just enjoy searching. There’s even one guy there that bonded 16 accounts and hasn’t accepted any bounties. Everyone hunting is completely ok with the 1b having possibly been claimed.
---
I don’t want to seem like a dick but it sounds like you just checked out the discord and left. And that’s ok because people who are really only in it for the money generally don’t stick around long. Lots of people go days before even finding one lucky impling. It’s incredibly difficult.
---
Runescape is literally the only game I play where I'm terrible at managing my money because I always end up buying dumb shit or doing things inefficiently
---
You’re mom will regret having you.
---
That is such a bad argument.
---
I'm a pvmer/skiller. Level 100 at that so i always get attacked because people think im dumb enough to carry anything of value into the wild. But I like the way it is in the wild. Wouldnt wanna change a thing aside from the amount of bots I see. The only change to PvP I would like to see is an item to help boost defense or attack against large amounts of people when you're alone to help prevent clans from gangbanging solo people.
---
Probably all diaries done, all quests done, and all skills minimum 99, but probs 200m all
---
for maximum afk training you can keep doing what you're doing and alch stuff
---
tele-alching at camelot will significantly improve exp rates (around 50-60% faster) but is more click-intensive and requires mouse movement
---
at 78 you unlock Tan Leather if you've done fremmy hard diaries, so you may want to do that for a while
---
above 70 magic you can burst monkeys in the MM2 tunnels if you've unlocked those - also if you have 65+ slayer then bursting dust devils is also efficient both for training slayer and magic
---
other than that you can do zero-time magic training while doing other activities - alch stuff during other skills or questing
---
I think slayer would be a bit better if the game just generated a list of contracts you could do. Nothing more annoying than running out of points and getting a shit task.
---
Lmao I can't believe they made bots a real thing
---
Piscarillus house - you help DJ Khaled steal from the residential district of piscarillus. Super low effort, not very click intensive if you have runelite render larger distances (there's running involved).
---
Make it cost like 100k tokkul to make though.
---
is that NELK in osrs?
---
It seems like you’re in the minority, man
---
Ironmen banks are basically always full until they have the POH TT chest to store stuff in, and even after that it's easy to fill up your bank because you have a constantly growing loot tab that you never clear out.
---
Rs3 bought my skills. Osrs bot my skills.
---
Then downvote his comment like a functional adult instead of commenting that and whining about his comment like a little bitch
---
It’s untradable, so do I give you the 1m upfront or?
---
Yes it is.
---
I mean, it's the same mentality of gambling at the lottery.
---
This is literally a 1 in a million. You shouldn't expect to win, it just takes your and their time from something practically no one here will ever get.
---
Kinda late, hopefully you have a better bank now. But if not, just use three placeholders for jewelry! One for new, one for the one you are currently using with &lt;max teleports, and one with zero or one charges (depending on if it crumbles or just goes to zero when done). 
---
Side hint: Murky Matt, the guy on the southeast part of the ge, can decant your partly charged jewelry into combined new ones!
---
There's a big document somewhere containing true completionist goals. Completion to me means doing literally everything possible (finished collection log, 200m all, obtained shit like max chompy hat, etc). 
---
Completion for me personally? Max Cape and completing personal challenges (solo tob, zuk pet).
---
Not only that, but he was so far ahead of 3rd, he could have gone to the toilet without falling behind them
---
And all pets too.
---

Ya I'm an hour and 35 minutes on my login timer on RS (which I started right after I started queuing for wow) and I've only made it to just over 2000 in the queue. So likely another half hour to an hour. I'll remember to start my queue much earlier tomorrow. Maybe even before I drive home from work lol
---
I think we could all use a little more sloppy toppy when we are doin some rigorous bank standing.
---
Does he clear out your stash of partyhats too? 😂 
---
But seriously thank you, I didn't know this was a thing!
---
Yeah idk why op is so dumb
---
I've never thought about this, but that's a 10/10 suggestion. Even have different point weightings based on the contract. Kill 100 Dagannoth, 10pts, kill 100 Spiritual Mages, 50pts.
---
This meme is god tier my man
---
Can't expect to be in the majority all of the time.
---
Hi team. Just needing Cerb advice. Near maxed combat, full bandos hasta and a spectral, with halberd for spec. Only getting about 3-4 kills per trip. Is this normal? I’m using sharks, but using anglers is pretty much the same, maybe 1 more kill per trip. I’m taking so much damage. It’s not the spirits, I can flick those fine, it’s just in between. Are you guys flicking cerbs range and melee attacks? Cheers in advance. My inv is usually a divine combat, 5 ppots and the rest sharks.
---
What if we added all clothing racks in POH filled of everything you need including clue scroll rewards
---
What's your favorite boss?
---
My current goal is to kill every boss 10 times.
---
The construction idea doesn’t punish low level accounts at all. It doesn’t hinder training construction whatsoever. You may wish to re-read that one.
---
None of them give any advantage over another. The only one that I think you’re referring to would to be to buy additional sets of things like void armor. However, you still have to obtain your first set prior to purchasing additional sets in that particular scenario.
---
You don’t have to participate in random events, as stated you can pay a fee to dismiss them.
---
For them credit card warriors
---
What that took me a while
---
Awww he got his quests mixed up. So damn cute bud. Keep trucking
---
I had a friend once. We played RuneScape together. One day I said ‘we should go to the deep wilderness’ and he obliged. I killed him in cold blood. Out of nowhere, I blugened him to death and took his mithril scimmy. I then deleted him from RuneScape, from all social media, and we never spoke again. No regrets.
---
More free worlds for us
---
Good job man. Definitely trying to keylog your shit so way to play it safe
---
Mate are you okay?

Sir why do you scare me like this?
---
My UIM is my reason for playing this game. Hit a minimum combat quest cape on an account in around a month for a challenge and then was like "now what?". Now I have an account with goals that are 6 months out but I have a logical chain of progression to actually achieve. I want BIS melee sans gear from slayer/inferno before I grind Slayer. Nezzy, Fury, Fire cape, Torso, Barrows gloves, imbued B ring. To start I want to unlock bird house runs. I need more construction levels for the mounted digsite pendant which will mean more money. I can grind 99 thieving in 2 weeks from my current level and make the money I need. (1 week if I am insane)  Then I begin training smithing to unlock the rune crossbow and meet diary reqs. Then I unlock my fury amulet (may go for black dhide) and complete the last 2 parts of RFD for barrows gloves. AFK grind 80 ranged, make Addy bolts(d), then I take on Jad. After Jad it's onto barbarian assault grind. Then I get my B ring (and maybe a D axe). 
---
After I grind 69 Slayer I will be grinding 70 herblore to get my quest cape. (last hard challenging req I have) After quest cape, I am grinding lumbridge elite for fairy rings and grinding 70 prayer for piety (and also mory hard) . After that I plan on beginning the grind for max combat and getting the Slayer cape I was proud of on my main pre-eoc. That last step starts about 6 months from now by my current estimations. Fuck I'm so excited just talking about it.
---
Yes, are you?
---
is the remap f keys in runelite bannable? This would be super useful for me because my f keys are hard to reach on my shit keyboard and being able to remap them to 1, 2, 3, and 4 would be game changing. It's in the runelite client I am just not sure if its legal for the terms of service
---
Ironmans are welcomed! Sent you a PM with additional info.
---
Use rlite on gpu if you want it close but the full conversion is so unnecessary i feel unless you want eoc too..then go rs3
---
I always enchant the rings I get because it increases the profit even more. Also useful to have a couple extra rings of dueling etc.
---
Yeah definitely, get Varrock diaries done for bstaves to get your crafting up
---
They weren't trying to keylog him lol, they were trying to get him to enter his RuneScape username and pass
---
Please don't put much stake into evolutionary psychology. 
---
Work on self improvement to boost your self-esteem, it'll do more for you in all facets of life. Exercise is always good and can help with depression, take a martial arts class (it can become a social thing). My home gym is legit just dumbbells and an exercise ball. See if people from work want to hang out, connect with family, friends from HS. Be comfortable with yourself.
---
Bumble is like a classier Tinder if you wanna try that, more for relationships than hookups. You could even just use it to practice getting comfortable with chatting and going on casual dates. It has like a friend finder thing too but I've never tried it.
---
I crunched some numbers and it seems fake....
---
Yeah, that is standard UIM shit. You think, "Oh I'm gonna do x thing" and end up doing about 7 other things leading into it. I just finished getting 12m from agility pyramid so I can rush 83 construction and not have to worry about training it until 99.
---
You using absorption’s at 1hp method? Is it expensive to train mage like that?
---
Thanks for your response dude. 
---
I tried bludgeon once but was not hitting very well so went back to hasta. 10 kills just seems impossible for me. I am switching between defender and spectral. Will definitely try DDS and mantas instead. 
---
Still doesn’t really answer why I’m getting nailed all the time.
---
Thanks again!
---
They're allowed
---
Twitch will watch a good personality regardless of the gameplay. The gameplay only needs to clickbait people into going into the stream.
---
Actually looks really good lmao.
---
If you're trying to anti-pk bring msb with amethyst arrows and an ags. If you just want to tank black d hide/granite legs and bulwark will work. 
---
Maybe even bring granite legs for pk set up too.
---
You’re welcome. I mean that takes a true OSRS fan, and thank you for putting out that content. It was nice to watch. :)
---
I'd say Bandos, but Justiciar with Torture and Prims may be better if you can afford it eventually.
---
Minty
---
Flesh crawlers drop many herbs and also noted iron ore. You’ll see they drop many useful items and have low defense which make them worth training
---
Wow questing is pretty lackluster in content, but that was never the draw.  Having played classic on this release, just having the ability to, after 1-2 days with terrible gear, clear out dungeons and do group/team content is what is so fun and addicting.  Runescape is very much a solo game whereas WoW is much more based around teams/groups.   Thats the one thing I dislike about RS, is that its hard to really play as a group or with friends.
---
That's not how the English language works.
---
Maybe it's a runecraft looting/running bot?
---
Sounds creepy tho
---
Ye I've had plenty of friends tell me to try it out and say they think I'd be a good fit, the only thing stopping me is I see all these channels with 0-2 viewers, it seems like its way harder now to enter the scene than it was a few years ago
---
Actually lold outloud at this for some dumb reason
---
Here is the math: It takes 636,294 xp to get from 50-70. 
---
You get 60 xp to use up an oak plank, so it takes 10,605 oak planks. They're currently 392 on the GE but that obviously fluctuates. At 392, you would pay 4.16 mil, but even if it spikes up to 430 per plank, thats only 4.56 mil. That is bare minimum though, and doesn't include the cost of banking teleports, hiring a servant, or unnoting materails with Phials.
---
Plus oak is slow compared to teak and mahogany, and if you use mahogany the whole way you're looking at spending over 9 mil.
---
ZIKE ZAKE ZIKE ZAKI OI OI OI
---
 No it's not. One card/set of info and you can make new play accounts over and over and over with the same shit and get new trials. Takes maybe 2-3 minutes per account, and that's using laggy ass emulator since I don't have an android
---
They're called tag tabs and they've been around for almost a year
---
Your argument falls short when you realise that "pot" is already an actual word with an accepted pronunciation, while "wildy" is literally just an abbreviation of the world wilderness.
---
Nah
---
Ah yes i remember 2012 memes
---
If you put some grapes in after you'll get cooking xp.
---
You can get a skull from the bone yard in the wilderness. Makes for a good bank tab icon.  Also the totem poll from legends is a great ‘quest tab/ items ill probably never use again but what if i do one day tab’
---
Second worst
---
You act as if there isn't 'valid' credit card number generators out there. Google doesn't attempt a charge when adding to play, it just checks if it's a valid format
---
This is a sketch off hocus pocus

Oh god I have vivid nightmares when i hear this phrase about wintertodt.

Fun &gt; efficiency
---
Then you've obviously never played it aside from torso and diaries. I wouldn't ever pay for a torso. As long as alts exist 50m torsos exist. There's plenty of people at ba with max/inferno capes that would argue its not "just lol." Sorry you had shitty teams.
---
How about 11$?
---
Energy level censored for obvious reasons.
---
Yeah i used to tune in every wednesday and was legit excited for them. I would get off work and rush home to catch them and hear sbout exciting new content.
---
on game ticks where you kill multiple dust devils simultaneously, RL will only decrease the counter by 1. if you use the slayer helm to check how many kills you have left, that number will be accurate, and runelite will also update its kill tracker to the correct number.
---
Those are a little different
---
What’s your skilling stats first off...
---
Plz tell me his name was Bob
---
This is an amazing suggestion.. i would actually train slayer!! Suggest this pleaseeeee!
---
Rooftop agility lol
---
That's what happened when rfd was released
---
Hit me up brotha
---
dk anything bout that, barely got time to play the actual game. All I know is for those of us who played last decade, RS2 had some illy tracks all over the map. I’ve been using the G.E track as an Alarm clock and it’s been way nicer than the generic apple alerts most people use nowadays.. Jag might be sitting on a lot of random dope things like the music it had invested into in the past. Wish I can have their permission to help scapers make alarm clocks from some of these:/
---
I think now you're exaggerating for the sake of it 
---
BCP is purely a defensive upgrade for 18m. (Sound similar to serp?)
---
Rada's blessing 4 is better than all the god blessings. Period. +2 prayer instead of +1. The only time it's not better is GWD.
---
Barrows gloves are bis range. And are an all round choice for melee as well. They provide defensives which ferocious don't, while saving you a swap for range and are viable for mage though tormented is definitely significantly better.
---
It may have seemed like bludgeon was not hitting well, but it is better dps than hasta, of that I can assure you. As for avoiding more damage, you can predict when verb is going to do his mage-ranged-melee attack again.
---
It'll be roughly 40 seconds after the first MRM attack, and if ghosts come before that, they delay it. If the MRM attack hasn't happened before ghosts, it will happen the second attack after ghosts. So one auto, then you know it'll be MRM. 
---
As for minimizing damage with lava pools, it is much easier to do when ranging (bp, but especially tbow), the distance simply gives you more time to react. 
---
I've had countless 20+ kill trips doing this (although I do usually 1 tick cerb now a days). Even with bad rng I end up with minimum 10 kills a trip.
---
Hope this helps!
---
So I died playing dmm...but I didn’t lose any stats? Could someone explain this? I thought I’m suppose to lose the unprotected ones.
---
I'm a flipper and a lot of other people I know support it. It makes gold more scarce in game  which makes the currency worth more.
---
do morytania hard diaries. do barrows runs and get sad about drop rate. value check the rune drops you've amassed and be pleasantly surprised.
---
continue barrows runs regardless.
---
If you can buy your stuff back after you die, like that fight, Vorkath, or Zulrah, you'll drop everything.
---
The quest lines in modern wow tend to tell a general narrative, and it tends to fit into this. Your quest was to go scout a camp or murlocs. Next quest, they follow you back and you have to man the turrets against a few waves. Next quest, you go and blow up their houses or something.
---
That's not a real quest line, but it's something you would expect at this point. It started with the death knight starting zone in Wrath and that had such a positive response, they modeled pretty much every quest zone they could after that.
---
Dude start farming, you don’t need to play a lot and you’ll make all the money u need from logging in and out on an herb run during ur sessions
---
I don't know how much I agree. The only worthwhile gp/hr boss from slayer is Hydra. Cerberus, kraken, thermonuclear smoke devil, sire are all lacklustre to farm. Obviously if you are an ironman that's different, but the whole game becomes obligatory at that point.
---
You say RC can be avoided, but then you can't do certain quests, can't finish achievement diaries etc. There's no tangible benefit to day to day play from having higher slayer. It simply unlocks some slayer based content to do, and is similarly a requirement for quests and diaries. It's a skill, same as others. You get benefits from training it up.
---
What the HECK YamFlex!?
---
this was helpful thnx bro
---
Maybe he did, but at least the whole game (outside of PvP) isn't Slayer. There are so many more things to do in OSRS than there is in WoW.
---
should've jumped ship when it came out. i was maxed and switched right on over to OSRS. it's a great game, tons of fun.
---
Oh hey, we're in the same clan lol
---
I just tried it and I have to say, you’re correct.
---
Kind regards,
---
is it a firemaking or construction cape on the far right?
---
Literally
---
You could try abyss runecrafting. It’s a short run through wildy but pkers are easy to avoid. If you die all you really lose is a glory and essence.
---
I mean, I play mobile specifically. I know I’ll never beat JAD with base 70 stats. So I wear my obby cape with pride.
---
Not if you do DKs, Cerb, Vork, and Demonics for your Duradel tasks
---
Like a fine vinegar.
---
That was impressive as fuck.
---
Tai bwo wannai grove, bring 100 trading sticks as payment to get in
---
Fuckin well done my dude.
---
Its true that life can throw some curveballs but climbing up a corporate ladder doesn't necessarily have a fixed probability to it, which is what I was mainly pressing on e.g., is it sensible to grind for something that's 1/5,000, what about 1/10,000? Not sure which line of work you're referring to though (i work at a university) but surely hard work must be rewarded in most careers?
---
I guess the empirical difference is that one can financially support you and others whilst the other is supposed to be enjoyed leisurely (a different story for our farmer friends)
---
I wonder if there's a single maxed person without either a fire cape or infernal cape
---
same
---
1. Serp already costs a couple K less than the 20k scales obtained from dismantling it.
---
2. I only play on an ironman and have no concern for how much gp/h I get from zulrah.
---
MEP2
---
This is wholesome.
---
yes please.
---
set a pin. Now. You'll regret if you don't.
---
JMods don't read this thread
---
Looks like a twisted bow for sure
---
I view Comp in two ways: Core and All. Core is the major stuff like Max, All Quests and Miniquests, All Diaries, and All Music but I'd also include like All Prayers, All Spells, All Emotes, and All Respawn Locations. You could even count stuff like 1KC in everything in the Boss Log and Slayer Log and setting a KC or Record for everything else tracked.
---
But true Comp is literal everything and it is pretty much impossible; mainly due to 200Ms, Collection Log, and Pets. Though realistically, the spirit of Comp shouldn't be limited to just doing everything that is recorded but doing everything for the sake of having done everything. Like even if nothing is checked off for say cutting a Redwood Log or catching an Infernal Eel, having experienced all content to some extent once would be Comp just like killing every boss once.
---
There already is a sequel. It's RfD
---
How did you earn 120m without ever doing zulrah? Id say some elite void though so you can save that money!
---
ape atoll (better if you've done mm2) but it may be busy
---
tai bwo wannai hardwood grove is just as good but less crowded. Costs equivalent of 1k gp to enter
---
How do you have a quest cape and not know why he's following you lol
---
I type “Chop chop!” or “Smashing!” while fishing. 
---
Or “Here fishy fishies!” while mining.
---
Oh wow
---
for real. it's one of the most op updates in the game.
---
how do you not get killed by all the abyssal monsters attacking you at once
---
Comment a single letter on your post to flair it. Your comment gets hidden afterwards
---
1) around 9k, 2 per shield  
---
2) Didn't look because I assumed shields were better xp, and also wanted afk. In hindsight though, doing these magic longs, I don't think there was any more afk time  
---
3) Literally only because I thought they were better xp at the time, nothing more
---
you'd be fine at zulrah with ahrims and a toxic staff for mage. For range use blowpipe and god d'hide. Save your money for other things or grab armadyl if youre certain you want to spend the cash.
---
Literally not NSFW
---
I was wondering why it was called runecraft in oldschool when I was sure it used to be runecrafting. This meme is me too.
---
Hmm tempting, combat pots or overloads? And did you use Dharoks?
---
Sorry for all the questions haha
---
Guy could be working off a college budget
---
It's not as bad as people saying Jay peg when they mean Jay feg. Since the p stands for photographic, not "potographic".
---
Or wait,  nobody says Jay feg. Hmmm... but if that's true,  then why is this argument always used to support "gif" instead of the correct "jif"?
---
Can’t really congratulate you if you have 1 cooking.

void also works well if you want less switches but I'd still recommend using your money elsewhere
---
Can you get the totem pole back after the quest?
---
Overloads and i used bis gear
---
Im curious too! I just started a new account and although im far away from those quests id love to see an alternate ending lol
---
You lost almost a mill ouch

We should change the model for the dragon med helm too. As it stands, when someone wears one, everyone in a 20 tile radius evaporates from the toxic levels of testosterone being released

Have you tried muting it
---
So? Most people would be pretty keen if thousands of dollars worth of shit was just spawning.
---
dont want to try get void at all, wanna farm zulrah so 120M ready.
---
You're clearly not a pker and just wanted a "unique" account build if you even considered 55 def for Nezzy over staying at 42/45 for one single second.

What's not to like?

3 clicks in 10 seconds every few days for 45k xp

Ah ok. That makes me feel a bit better. Thanks

is it really that hard to left click the bucket, then left click the sand pit? then afk for a minute

Yeah elder maul getting a buff.
---
Its spec now only cost 15% gonna be fucking wild
---
Why though? 
---
If you wanting the teleport that’s what redirects are for?
---
If it’s a new house you should have to deck it out new as well though. Not back to your main one.
---
Yeah what was talked about related to the elder maul? I know it was the q and a that's literally what I'm asking.
---
Look at this cool kid
---
Yes I love the grand exchange music and my tone is the jingle when an item sells or buys

Can I have 2 unlimited compost buckets. One filled with supercompost and one with ultracompost? If so do they just not stack in the bank then?
---
I asked him about it once how much he was making and he responded back that he considers the average made is like 150k-300k a hour from hosting, but he has fun doing it and once in a while every blue moon someone might leave a whopper for him lol, think he likes the chatting.
---
Is there an actual setting within the client as opposed to toggling it off when it starts up?
---
No matter how much this game ages, that nezzy helm + torso + rune legs will always have a captivating beauty

I know it means in game name, but when I was new to this subreddit, I had zero clue.

Im confused by ur question
---
You can use cow meat for crossbow strings?
---
I think he said most hours he only gets like 150k-300k a hour from tips, but every once in a while he might get a blue moon tip or dump.
---
50/50. You get it or you don’t.

And they're much better once you learn to use them.

The arrow flies right through the fish but is still attached to the line. The tip is barbed so when you reel it in it sticks in the fish

Or maybe people don't take kindly to the mere suggestion of yoinking two 330m splits.

Nope, fits lore of game

yes, of course. i just didn't know you could decant pizzas and jewelry.

if that's the case zulrah and Vorkath are your best bet behind CoX and ToB

I did Konar until I hit 100 combat and would recommend everybody do the same.

Ahhh I see, I understand now, thanks for the explanation!

Where have a seen the combo of goatee and bald head before?...

same happened to me with 12 of my twisted bows. jagex can you put them back into my bank? thanks

Woodcutting used to just be called woodcut in RuneScape classic. I do not know why they changed it.

Ngl I loved dungeoneering most fun I’ve ever had in rs. And I miss summoning so much. I don’t really feel like summoning ruined too much. I feel like summoning now would have a much much bigger effect than it did back in the days. Players nowadays are a different breed. People didn’t really know how to efficiently do bosses or obscure methods etc. Nowadays players would find stupidly op ways to abuse it.
---
Gg.. But hey.. Im a noob.. How did you make the money for a few of those items tho😬 With such low stats.. James?? Mr.. James bond?
---
I feel they put the buildings and stuff in such a way that they're visible from taberly gate so you could be curious and want to know.

Because if it's a graphic complaint then that's a petty reason to vote no as that adjusted by the team artists.
---
Accurate
---
It was red when he started
---
Melee is the strongest end game but personally, i think ranged is the most important.  
---
You need ranged to do jad(most commonly) .
---
You need ranged to do Zulrah(effectively, unless u just want 1 kill).
---
err.... that's all i can think of lol.
---
How is it not QoL? Takes mad skill and determination to click a bucket, bro. Nerf buckets. Fucking idiot lul. Every QoL is pure laziness by your definition then, though. It's not QoL to have make-all on smithing interfaces. It's just pure laziness that you don't want to type out 33 in the prompt every time.
---
I don't know how people xp waste that much tbh.
---
&gt;So I've heard.
---
*suspicion intensifies*
---
Looks like dfh and nezzy helm had a baby. I like it a lot.
---
Thank you!
---
Thats super wierd
---
Lunar items are always lost. This game is weird.
---
Now this... this is beautiful
---
Amulet of the damned is indeed lost on death.
---
Range can really just noodle some times. 
---
But no buff has been given.
---
Are you going to trying and hit all 99s in one day
---
It's worth getting your farming up. You can get 32 farming in like a day.
---
Check the runelite items lost on death plugin, it's accurate as far as I'm aware.

Been making the herbs from my herb runs into pots, I feel like a genuine iron man
---
Melee and range are used about equally right now at the end game level. Melee is probably the most common at the early game but it becomes range scape until the end game because blowpipe is broken and very accessible. Scythe and Lance bring the balance back later on.
---
OSRS kind of has that Konar.
---
Something wrong with d chain boy?
---
Yeah, you can cook raw beef into either cooked beef or sinew, sinew is used to make crossbow strings.
---
Same here lol, looked around to make sure no one had made a RS version of it before I made this and forgot to add a "s" after log so know I feel stupid lmao
---
I second the birdhouse runs there not as good for gp/seeds as they use to be but I got to 66 hunter threw 99℅ exp gain being from bird houses
---
Why do people drop runes at ZMI
---
This is a joke, although 50 is numerically half-ish of 99 because of the way the xp system works half way to 99 is actually level 92
---
I do this almost weekly, buy enough for 10 levels of herblore, yeet it back in the GE after an hour.
---
Hell, I have 6k mahogany planks sat in my bank from this very habit.
---
Get your mage and strength up and go do some barrows
---
So you recommend bird houses as the way to train hunter?
---
It makes perfect sense... 
---
Items are being added to the game from bossing, raids, etc. The more items that are added, the cheaper the existing items become. Therefore you need to create an item sink to avoid price crashes. 
---
Death mechanics have a consequence that acts as an item sink. E,g  it used to be if you don’t pay X amount of gold for a grave then you’d risk losing the items  than you would have otherwise, which can act as an item sink, as you’re potentially losing items.
---
Sheep herder 2 please

yeah i did know that, wasn’t sure exactly what he mean’t hahah, isn’t 84 like a quarter or something? Looks like i got a long way to go yet. :P

How are OSRS's quests better than RS3?
---
If you want something to do with no real requirements you can go tan dragonhide or crush bird nests, although you might want a little bit of starting cash (The more you have, the longer you can do a task for). Slayer is always a good option but won't make mass amounts of gold till higher levels. Runecrafting is boring just as it is in f2p, but as for moneymaking it is decent. Don't make the game about making money too much though, generally try to just get as many quests done as you can and aim for Recipe for Disaster.
---
Definitely as an afk way it's been my only cause in lazy
---
They answered my question at 27:50 :D

Runecraft so bad it took this mans ability to read away. Jagex plz.
---
Portal nexus argument holds no weight because you still have to teleport to your house for that, where you might as well change spellbook instead of using the Nexus.
---
You only lose stats if u die skulled
---
From what I've heard (note, just what someone said on reddit) the well known hosts have people spam report anyone else that advertises so they can't get any word out about their house.
---
Ahh right, thanks will keep that in mind hahha. :)
---
You'll get run back faster and access to shortcuts guess it really depends in how patient you are. Personally I don't like training it cause I find it boring but some people like it, just do what makes you have fun
---
The number one comment is so good it's actually a part of the screenshot
---
2 bracelets! Both wrists! Please thanks bye.
---
Leave flax spinning to the bots. It's a decent afk money maker but if you've only just got membership it'll most likely just end up boring you.
---
Slayer is decent but a lot of money comes from later levels, once again it'll probably only serve to bore you.
---
Medium clue scrolls will perhaps be a great way to make some early cash. The reqs arent too bad and most reqd will be useful to unlock. Quests like fairy rings and achievement diaries are great too, especially for progression. Also make sure to check out wintertodt. 
---
If you get your mage level up, barrows also becomes an option. 
---
Have fun with membership! The game has loads of content to check out, if you ever feel bored there'll always be somethint else to fall back to.

Most afk is normal rumble, with absorptions and super combats. It like a 15 minutes afk. Gear wise Max str + rapier is slightly more xp than full obby with obby sword. It is like 85k xp/h at 99 stats

A few starting points, look up Zeah, Monkey Madness 2, Dragon Slayer 2, and Fossil Island.

Zalcano is way better for getting addy/rune ore and bars than MLM. Each hour I average probably 50 rune ore/bars and 300 addy. Not as afk though

Are you enjoying coming back to the game?
---
I just hate how cooking fish is the only real meta of training cooking. Pastries and stuff could really use a buff. Or fish a nerf.
---
What’s nh?
---
Just do slayer. Slower exp but the changes of scenery and chance at good profit make it interesting.
---
And he said you looked cool....
---
Figured :p   
---
Good to know Jagex has been expanding upon old content.

&gt;its both cheating so who cares

Just wanted to chime in and inform you that this statement is 100%, undeniably, flat-out, unequivocally, outright false. Full stop.
---
Will-dee
---
He'll only do 3hp damage and stun you for a few seconds, worth the risk
---
That’s a question I’ve never really figured out either. It could be from people dropping out of habit, dropping every rune they get to make withdrawing easier, or just dropping runes they feel like aren’t worth banking. There’s not much of a purpose as far as I can tell since you’re going straight to the bank anyways, but maybe I’m missing something.
---

yes, now alch them

No honour. Basically using all three combat styles and overhear prays and camping full hp. The only rules are the mechanics. No smite v smite, no sitting half health and calling ea other safer. No cb level matched fights.

Assuming prices of Bonds stay the same which they never will

Yeah soon as he dies put it on and whoever got the last hit all the minions will focus them so pray mage first and kill the mage, then pray ranged and kill the melee and then finally see who's got lowest hp and then let them kill the ranged one

You can easily kill zulrah and get 2 tanzanite fangs with it, i dont know why op is so greedy smh
---
Btw
---
Darts or dragon arrows.
---
Some notable ones I can think of from the top of my head are the toxic blowpipe from zulrah, raids one and two, twisted bow, rigour. Also zeah the new continent.
---
Blowpipe is a great weapon, maybe even the best in the game, so I would advise getting one of those once you hit 75 range. Other than that just play at your own pace and you will eventually discover all the new stuff
---
Will elder maul drop to its initial price? If not.. how far will it drop / rise?

---
&gt;overpowered
---
&gt;have existed in game for several years
---
Theyre already buyable through implings, doing this then giving a chance at the clue is just a slap in the face. The current points per scroll offered  is to base it around how long it would normally take you to get a clue scroll of that type via PvM.
---
Ah okay. Stats? On average ? I'm pretty bad ;;
---
The clue scroll idea is horrible and will just devour them. Who thought buying clues with points was a good idea? It's like MTX all over again. Buying anything on OSRS to make it easier is never a good idea. They are supposed to be a rare reward from monsters, and this is what made clues fun.
---
In regards to the bottled dragonbreath...
---
Did Jagex forget they already have an item called bottled dragonbreath?
---
That era is dead and gone. Fishing spots used to be a hub of conversation, now they're silent. And no one training Runecrafting is going to say a word, even one tick not spent on the grind is wasted XP.
---
Online conversation seems to be moving more and more out of game to mediums like Discord. It's pretty easy to hop into a discord community and join the conversation. But it's very difficult in a lot of games to just start chatting and get any response.
---
Back in the glory days of Team Fortress 2, you could just hop onto any alltalk server and start chatting, making friends, and joining a community. I won't go into detail about how valve destroyed community servers in tf2 in favor of chasing tends, but suffice to say that's no longer possible. Lots of games are increasingly disconnected from the concept of community. Building a community purely in-game is impossible in most modern games, communities only arise in external systems like Discord or Reddit.
---
Trim the music cape.
---
it should require all other quests to be completed and you have to start and finish a giant adventure with all the important stuff from all the quests
---
Pvp shouldn't have any rewards the effect the game period. it's the endgame of endgame.
---
It's been updated now.
---
I'm a slayer fanatic (20m xp in rs2) that has no plans to go back to WoW.
---
When RS2 died, I went to WoW but it just never scratched that same itch.  In fact, I never found anything that did.  I maxed out the dungeons in Stardew Valley, I played WoW, I played a few other games that I thought might do it.
---
I came back to OSRS about a month ago and that itch has finally been scratched.
---
No risk no requirement PvP minigame should be a better upgrade than a group based pvm activity? Feels backwards. Imagine if kodai was from mage training arena and master wand was from raids...
---
And since you’re lvl 70 which is a perfect target for pure clans, you’ll still get targeted with your blowpipe.  You die either way but you’ll make more bank with a craws.  High risk = high reward
---
Zalcano is pretty great money. 1-2m per hour
---
&gt;55 is probably about right
---
Yep
---
Legends quest is a master quest and requires basically base 50s
---
Roq updated the post to highlight they will be tradable since it was put out. RIP to the irons
---
Being able to gear yourself up with a "preset" has been met with alot of negativity in the past, not especially because it allows players to reinvent them selves easily. Wouldnt be too keen on that myself personally, it would have an effect on bank related skilling XP rates.
---
Imagine reading the actual post. If you did then you would know that the elder maul is not being moved to LMS.
---
Life saver
---
Beat that tb to the 30 line lol
---
A small tradeable upgrade that players can just purchase to put on their elder maul might i add.
---
Nice rewards but many of them does not fit on this minigame. 
---
&gt;Players placing between 20 and 24 will receive 0 points
---
Every game should give atleast one point. This will be very frustrating to get some of the things for people that does not enjoy this kind of pvp interaction. Getting some kind of reward atleast for trying is really important.
---
So if they both come from bots then why is one acceptable but not the other?
---
Exactly
---
Ironman like you are the reason why pvp is dying
---
post video evidence
---
Hmm, I think you guys forgot we already HAVE bottled dragon breath as an item; it's made in Kebos and used to recharge Dragonfire Shields. Maybe a different name?
---
EZ. Just don’t die.
---
But in all seriousness it has happened to me. Mostly when failing to get through the obstacles a bunch of times. Idk what all your cb stats are but maybe train up HP and def? Also helps to have full graceful and decent mining and agility.
---
One trip to the abyss gets you 8-9k once you get to nature runes with 3 pouches. If you manage to not blow your brains out you’ll eventually get double nature runes. The only thing you lose is glory charges (which isn’t much money at all per trip if you sell the glories back), maybe energy potions and food if you need it, and the occasional PKer may smack you for your glory. 
---
Pro tip: For max profits don’t sell your runes until the next Venezuelan power outage when the supply dries up and prices rise.
---
pfft...steel scim...
---
??? nice strawman
---
Maybe read the update post
---
I used the ham to destroy the ham
---
So why not walk over to the GE and buy them instead of leaving a comment..?
---
to get the -68 magic attack, full iron doesn't cut it. You have to have the d hide vambs, or a cursed goblin staff.
---
Entangle on puropuro/imp hunting for example. Ironmen might use fire surge on pvm just to get xp.
---
Mans at work D:
---
The imbues should be removed from NMZ and added to runecrafting or magic, not added to another minigame.
---
Thought as much, makes sense
---
Reupload collection log rather than a blurry picture of the actual kill.  [https://imgur.com/a/LX9MJTM](https://imgur.com/a/LX9MJTM)  if you want to see the blurry picture
---
When you have thick blonde locks, but then start chemo for your pretend cancer and look in the mirror for the first time
---
It's the recently added 'Adventure Paths' for new players to help them get into the game.
---
Do you know what the other master quests are lol
---
Multiple 60s and then 55rc is clearly not low compared to old master tier quests.
---
Can't you wear the D scim before accepting the training?
---
It would fuck with everyones minds for little benefit.
---
Better idea: let a void mace be added to the Staff of Balance to give it the special attack being polled for the Dragonfire Staff.
---
Shouldn't blame others for your inability to git gud
---
Why does it say "J-Mod reply" there is none?    
---
And it says "all 4 comments" when there are just 3. Hmm
---
Make it a 65 att leaf-bladed battleaxe pure man best option
---
I did this and he suggested I throw away a dwarven helmet which are like 40k
---
Or the cave just winds downward and faces West again. Honestly it’s kind of nostalgic because it’s weird.
---
Can you? I always thought you had to accept it, can you wield it as soon as you get the quest complete screen?

Shouldn’t blame others for your inability to git gud

I'd be surprised. I reported it immediately and posted it here hoping they'd fix it faster before it gets out of hand.
---
This is a great piece of info buddy, sounds interesting actually thanks!
---
This looks great, I hope this brings people who wouldn't otherwise consider PvP to at least come and try it and not feel so alienated from doing other PvP activities. Hopefully there are a few additional rewards that pass the poll but even what we've currently got is much better than what we had before.
---
So Soul Runes are slightly faster, and with less profit. If you spent the extra money you're earning at ZMI on runners, I wonder how much more XP an hour that would be.
---
Look at the clip the guy replied to you with and tell me it’s “just as hard”
---
No way ancestral/armadyl (standard “max” inferno pieces) survive a wave 63 like that just fucking facetanking it praying mage. It’s the 2nd or 1st hardest wave in the entire Inferno (depending on who you ask) completely trivialized. 
---
I don’t shit on justiciar capers, a cape is a cape, but it definitely is not just as hard as doing it in standard, non-tank dps gear.
---
I completely agree. Everything shouldn't be tradeable especially the parchments. I could see the occult attachment, rune orbs, lvl 33 wildy tele tab and elder maul upgrade being tradeable because they're slight buffs/additions.
---
That's one good trip to the blood altar it just saved you
---
Dust devils in the catacombs have a different amount of hp, and thus give a different amount of slayer xp, than dust devils in the DT smoke dungeon. 
---
It could still be done of course, but adding checks for all this stuff makes the process quite a bit more complicated.
---
I think though that there is an argument to be made for the fact that LMs is going to be the minigame in OSRS with the highest skill level requirement to do well in (skill as in technical ability). So, because of that, it makes sense to have really good rewards for doing well in it. To be honest, I’d be all for having raids level rewards for it, as I personally see it as equivalent in dificulty for PvP as raids is for PvM, maybe even more so. I don’t think that would ever pass or be very popular, but still.
---
Depends on how you look at it
---
To me the entrance from the outside is facing west, but is east.
---
And the entrance(exit?) on the inside is facing east, and is also east.
---
Level 85 is only 3,2M exp, that's not hard to get.
---
You got here too quick, comments don't show for normal users for about 30 seconds, but they do for moderators and automod, which is how it got flaired
---
You forgot to censor your name under the hp of the greater demon, thanks for the account.
---
It's like 150 hours to level 60.
---
It's not quick, and because it is necessary it is by definition not a "side activity".
---
It's been confirmed that they will not roll back as well.
---
🦀🦀 PERM BAN INCOMING GL 🦀🦀
---
This sort of thing has slipped through multiple levels before getting released.
---
1. The dev that wrote the changes should be thinking about wider affects of what they're changing and how it will interract with the rest of the game/server code.
---
2. At code review a senior dev should have looked over the code and hopefuly thought of more possible different ways that this change could break.
---
3. Quality assurance should be testing edge cases like this from a black box perspective, trying to break it with strategies that have broken things before.
---
Life is way too short to watch pawn stars
---
🦀🦀 $11 🦀🦀
---
I bet you’re the first person to get dropped everytime. Git gud.
---
HCIM time Pogchamp
---
This is how divine pots are supposed to work - basically the same as an overload without the regeneration for 5 minutes then no boost.
---
Feels
---
Priorities.
---
Then make the catacombs the standard, the killcount tracker of the other place becoming worse is a sacrifize they have to make
---
I much prefer mine
---
no problem, dummy
---
What is this
---
you get banned get fucked
---
I got 1 kill by accident when i went to freeze someone at the start and he had 10hp :(
---
Yeah very odd, ah well no harm
---
Do you get points for casual games? I placed high and got no points
---
As someone who's probably going to get raids melee stats after I finish rcing (sup 2025 you lookin good) what's the best way to find a group to learn with and trust? I'm not going to scam anyone, better to have the trust of a group and do 100 raids than do 1 and struggle through 99 alone because I fucked em. Is WDR the best option?
---
Funny, pkers always pushing for more pvm rewards in the wildy.
---
nice
---
Of course you are wrong since drop rates are known. Buying 2k of eclectics imps you can expect to receive 80 med clues ect.
---
now you must do agility pyramid for money and grind for your rune scimitar
---
Expanding skill content == overbloating now, ok. You probably voted no to every Skilling update then.
---
Pretty much haha. Enjoy!
---
Its not really compareable to an overload which refreshes the stats. It could just remove the drain without removing the stats IF the stats you have no longer is from the divine potion. 
---
It feels like lazy coding bug that has become a feature.
---
Most probably because the game hasn't long updated and people who usually PvP are at LMS?
---
Most people do Blood Runes 77-90/91, and then takeover doing either Soul Runes 90-99 or double Nature Runes 91-99.  
---
Casual players might do Blood Runes 90-99, but they're unlikely to get to 90 in the first place.
---
The gmaul is way too strong. When everybody in the wild is using one weapon purely. Don’t you miss when people used different weapons?
---
BREAD CAT
---
These Jmods are in a community discord and turns out that yesterday (wednesday) it was "play wow at work" day. Picture was taken \~ 2PM UK time
---
Where can I find this collection log? nice tool! never saw it
---
Not the rampant toxicity, skulltricking and resisting lowering the barrier to entry within pk community. Definitely not that at all.
---
So the fire rune orb needs 100 casts of Fire Surge in it, capping at 1000 of each rune. Fire surge requires 10 fire runes for every 1 wrath rune. So that orb can only actually hold 100 casts of the spell, and has to be charged to maximum capacity to be used at all.
---
That seems like a glaring oversight to me, especially given that you will probably get through more than 100 casts in very long fights. It ought to cap at 1000 casts, not 1000 runes of a type.
---
Keep trying and learning. You won’t get better by not practicing.
---
What happened?
---
That's the protect item icon from High Risk Worlds. Redemption just doesn't have one.
---
Preserve needs to be unlocked. So it's grayed out. But they actually want you to use the combat unlockables.
---
Wonder who will hire this bozo
---
Why would the blade be better than the rapier for boss slaying?
---
This is actually a pretty decent idea and usually player suggestions are beyond bad.
---
I do like the idea of taking some of the mauls out of the game and this kinda makes sense as a LMS reward. I’d vote yes for it.
---
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
---
3k coins: 1/183
---
Dragon Spear: 1/10,810
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(183 \* 10,813) - 1 = 1,978,778
---
Divide by 2 because Vorkath has two drop rolls means that the odds are in the region of 1/989,389.
---
Nope, just a placeholder so I know how many I have. I’m going to collect quite a few of them.
---
Fish levels?
---
Then I have the worst barrows luck ever. 85 kc and just 1 fucking item
---
“Plate of bacon” lmfao can’t unsee
---
Yea they won't roll back you are safe
---
Imagine thinking all Jmods do all things at Jagex. Or that these individual Jmods were even *at* work during that time.
---
Hey just a thought, having a real Q/A process helps prevent issues like this.  I only say that because these kinds of obvious bugs slip by you guys on a regular basis.  You guys need to have a serious conversation about your process.
---
you won't get x amount of clues, you'll only *probably* get *around* that many, the whole idea behind clue scrolls is having a lot of rng associated with them,  making them directly guaranteed purchasable just feels wrong
---
You need like 30 hours of mlm to get upstairs to the good area.
---
Thanks for posting
---
&gt; that's not hard to get.
---
&gt;only 3,2M exp
---
It's not hard clicking the same god damn agility rooftop for 50+ hours on end but it's fucking boring
---
It doesn't really make sense with the rewards being tradeable though. You could just buy the rewards from players, sell them to the shop, and rebuy them to fill the collection log.
---
Wtf is a grifter
---
For vorkath you use the dragon ruby bolts until it's at around 365hp then you switch to dragon diamond bolts.
---
Why not play both you brainlet?
---
nIce
---
This is intended, this behaviour was thoughoughly explained in the poll blog with An example of this exact scenario
---
yea that doesn't sound legitimate chief
---
Sorry for being a noob, but is using cats for deaths really the best route to get them. I'v seen it mentioned multiple times.
---
lmao
---
Seriously do we all just quit? Like is it even worth it at this point? Bring on the double xp/daily free spins because I just wanna max and never touch RuneScape again tbh. Game company can’t even do justice when it’s simple fixes.
---
I’ll vote yes for everything besides runic orbs
---
Technically not proof since this can still be faked, as others have already mentioned. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, since with every unbelievable statistic and a large enough sample, there's likely to be at least one poor soul who unfortunately experiences the extremely short end of the RNG stick.
---
Sword?
---
Forgot to censor Pray level. Thanks for the account lad!
---
Been doing slayer while playing classic and its working out great
---
Meanwhile I'm over 50 dry...
---
What was the bug?
---
GE
---

---
I have the level up jingles as my alarm, a diff one for each day of the week. You can get most sound effects and songs from the osrs wiki at oldschool.runescape.wiki
---
Yeah man I totally get it. People like video games because the end goal is so much more clearly defined, and RuneScape is a great example. I don't tend to follow through on enough in my life either (and when I do, I don't get handed a fire cape). 
---
If I could give you a couple pieces of advice, do as many quests as you can. I never had a lot of fun doing the quest, but seeing the name turn green in the quest log and knowing I'm closer to my goal is a great feeling and makes it all very rewarding. Keep it up!
---
It seems stats weren’t reset properly after being boosted when playing LMS, so you could illegitimately complete diaries etc
---
"One of my goals".
---
Why would you play one of the most tedious games in the world, and then act like 3,2M is like a life long struggle to get.
---
Yep ty for correction
---
Yeah, bottom 4-5 is fine to get 0 points,   you can easily get 19th place by not suiciding and not getting any kills.  If every match gave a point it would encourage people (or bots...) to que up and afk since they'll get a point anyway
---
Lol, it a little creepy yeah which I'm a little desperate to find out what is happening and why I haven't changed the info yet.
---
Well how long has the collection log Been out? I’ll see how long I’ve had this account
---
This is it, this is the beginning of the AI revolution. It all starts in OSRS
---
I know, im just saying its strange that theres 3 alternative icons for prayers that dont work
---
Yeah it's not perfect by any means but it's something
---
I got the quest complete screen before accepting the training. I presume you can. But you need to finish the training before reentering the island.
---
Implings having clue scrolls is easily one of the worst design decisions in osrs that was made though...
---
I dont have the authenticator is actually the problem. And in order to remove the authenticator i need to do it from an email i no longer have
---
yes should be banned
---
Exactly haha let’s get rid of that meta.
---
a shoe
---
Would look great with black graceful
---
Herbs only get diseased and die during their growth cycles. Your herb will be dead or done by 1020 and every minute after that doesn't matter at all. You can leave fully grown herbs in their patch indefinitely.
---
I still don’t have it haha 😡😱
---
Thanks, that worked! :)
---
And how much mining xp you get there an hour?
---
Bug abuse is bannable, you’ll probs be fine tho but I see he’s point
---
.. that will be the meta post gmaul nerf because the only  way to die would be let your hp drop below 80
---
Stake your claim at crabs
---
Do you mean which stats to get up before becoming a member?
---
Plenty people book time off work in order to play game releases and stuff.
---
Besides, most QA testing should be done WAY before the day before lol. You aren't running around testing things the day you intend to release because if you find something, you need more time to fix and retest. 
---
&gt;before a large update 
---
Steady on, this is pretty small all things considered.
---
LMS is ready
---
God no, please never add them. Rs3 is full of people wearing swimsuits, animal ears and tails. It is so obnoxious
---
I’ll fucking do it again
---
Receive every unique drop, kill every boss, max every skill, complete every diary, complete every quest, and receive all pets.
---
With the exception of TBow drop, its been a pretty uneventful year for most players.
---
Your words seem to mention developing processes unheard in jagex
---
Then your Account is RIP, if u deleted your Email Account try to create an account with the same Email-adress.
---
Did u throw your old phone away or why dont you have the "old" authenticator?
---
There needs to be a grand-grandmaster quest where you need 20m rc xp
---
It's a joke

---
Country rooooooaaaaad
---
Between shit like this and their absolute joke of a customer support/ban system Jagex is a fucking clown show. I wish this game was ran by a legitimate company
---
Yeah its a shame that they have a useful effect but are unusable.... I've always wondered why they set them up in a way that gaurenteed they'd be dead content.
---
I traded it in for the new one. And i already tried to but AOL says the address no longer exists but its unavailable to use for a new one
---
I honestly hate pvmers
---
To be fair, no GP was actually added to the economy during the Tbow glitch, unless someone managed to snag multiple Tbows and started alching the extra ones.
---
If this is "pickpocket an elf" then you can do it at 82 without messing around with stews - you can get +3 thieving from summer sq'irkjuice in Al Kharid.
---
Nieve with cat ears.
---
Any actual reason? Just saying you're voting no doesn't really help if you don't say what you don't like about it.
---
Now I want some dope ass sluts in my bank thanks
---
Between shit like this and their absolute joke of a customer support / ban system / handing free membership to bot farms ect. Jagex is an absolute clown show. I wish this game was ran by a legitimate company
---
Luckily no one can be the entrance or we would have trouble
---
Anybody hear if any pures abused this for addy or better gloves?
---
mind sharing your method for catching these?
---
Yes because going under your opponent and hoarding a tree mid battle is such a fun mechanic lmao. I preferred the old version of LMS where rng took precedent and was overall a enjoyable experience not only for me but many others.
---
Agreed, it takes no time to make a bot and get free membership for them to suicide bot the account on members worlds, by the time one gets banned they have 10+ other accounts ready to take its spot
---
Dude. I have 100+ kc and not a single piece
---
So he went DayZ style and used his shirt?
---
Such a pretty house! One day I will actually decorate my house
---
Yeah jagex can definitely ban justly, its just a question of is this a harmless enough offense that they could just wipe the diary completion and turn a blind eye
---
Reported enjoy ban
---
That’s required when on a German f2p world
---
They playing RS on boats now?
---
Tbers rejoice
---
What does this even mean?
---
&gt;It's been a few weeks now since Song of the Elves launched, so the standard login screen has returned.
---
And I already miss it, it was such a nice login screen. Would it be possible to add a toggle somewhere on the client to choose previous login screens?
---
Do you lose graceful? Idk how the wilderness mechanics work. Like, do you keep it like you would void before 20 or 30 wilderness?
---
its the craftsmanship of a very rare gem, its supposed to be expensive.
---
You call your Master, "Owner?" Mother fucker, you would be dead before you became an adult if you were mine.
---
And upon being told "Glory! It could be yours!", the PK'er does exactly what Loudred's doing on the banner -- expression and everything
---
It's a good point. I didn't even know they existed really until now. If I had to guess, I'd say it's to make it harder to camp a boss forever with them. At a higher price there's a high cost to using them, making you really decide if it's worth camping something longer for the price of the bolts.
---
69 job
---
Added, IGN Vargo but again I've got a bit of an RC grind ahead of me before I start raiding.
---
I have 3 items in 152 kc...
---
Like i mentioned in my reply to the other guy, 2PM UK time is standard working hours and im assuming 3 employees didn't call off the same day (thats a pretty decent % of the OSRS team lol) I'm gonna feel pretty safe with the guess that they were playing WoW at work. But who knows, maybe they did call off, that'd be fine if so. 
---
And actually yeah the ardy knight bug should have been found. Same with these LMS bugs. They were working on very specific codes referring to coins in the Ardy knight case and stat boosts/item codes in LMS. Both which we knew they were specifically testing and still fucked up. The whole premise behind this is that this kind of fuck up has become such a regular thing lately it's time to start asking how. Something's wrong with the QA team, be it laziness or whatever. Like you said, even the smallest change can have MASSIVE implications so it's hard to see how bugs specifically related to their code changes still passed into the live game... for the 9th month in a row or w/e. Time to stop this shitty QA trend

It could be a Gertude's cat sequel or some other cat related quest but I get what you mean.

TIP: To play WoW classic for 1 dollar a month, make a new battlenet account and set your country of origin to Argentina and then you can pay Argentinen pesos for your games, a 12 month sub for WoW is 599 pesos which is equal to 11 USD.  This doesn't affect what servers you connect to either, and you will still connect to servers that are where-ever your IP is located it just allows you to pay for the game with pesos (credit cards automatically transfer the type of currency to the country you are "in" or making the purchase from) so you will still be able to pay in pesos.  I currently bought wow for 1 buck a month.  Fuck wow and their 14 dollars a month
---
You have to be kidding that a 10 minute cool down on bank presets is a good suggestion lol. What an asinine idea.
---
That's also a noun, it's just used in a dofferent sense. Check out these two sentences, they seem to be talking about two different concepts, even though craft is in both.
---
&gt;He spent a lot of time improving his craft.
---
&gt;Crafting if as much a science as it is an art.
---
The first is more specific (a single craft), while the second is more generic. Perhaps that is the difference, I'm not sure though.
---
Ultima is such a generic overused term in fantasy lore that it’s almost ironic to see it as a suggestion in regards to a lack of creativity on someone else’s part.
---
For sure, I'll add you when I get on later tonight IGN SkullTricked which I assume is the one you added
---
Not for the poor F2P players :(
---
It's in the music player -- Scape Crystal.
---
Do you drop or bank redwoods?
---
Lmao I only have 2 pieces left before completing the entire Barrows log, and I'm only at 330kc. I feel really bad for you
---
Not using YouTube Vanced in 2019
---
I can always get 1 kill, but the 2nd kill is much harder
---
&gt;you'll get x amount of clues
---
That's not how this works. If I kill vorkath trying to get a pet, I can go more than 3,000 kills without getting one. 
---
Kacy wants a Bloodhound pet. Master scroll reward, 1/1000. He's ***5,400*** dry.
---

---
Oh you noticed me and my nerdom did you? &lt;3
---
Australian worlds are unplayable
---
Can someone give me a quick rundown of this bug? I'm out of the loop for this one.
---
Your house minimap looks like a q p
---
Hopping into a world and attacking someone in the wilderness is asshole behavior?
---
Rs gp has value in the real world through rwt, so these phishing streams exist to take advantage of that
---
An occasional dragon pickaxe is pretty fucking nice though
---
whats an unforeseen regearing boost?
---
How does this not get spotted. Embarrassing for the team.
---
A trade off i would take. My RC level has to stay 1
---
Have you personally used the avaraice? It sucks. Its only use is cannoning green dragons in revs, and the dragons spawn so badly that you can't even attack all 3 at once without one retreating. It REALLY needs a buff
---
I hope they distinguish between people who knowingly and unwittingly abused it.
---
Why would anyone think that gp is the only thing that is unacceptable to add to to the game in unusual quantities?
---
Ha
---
Construction wasn't one of the affected skills as LMS is a pvp mode, only combat stats and Agility were affected.
---
I'm not pretending jesus christ look at the screenshots

Imagine getting booty tickled over an emote lol

Deadman was pretty important for the game, even if it didn't affect that many people. But yeah I agree, good job Jamflex!
---
West side sucks, east all the way
---
I reckon that they will swap the main world like with BH
---
Late mate
---
Yeh personally the main use I get out of that sub is making sure I haven't forgotten something obvious when replanning tabs.
---
Runelite tags help for all the nuances. My bank is mainly designed to just look nice now ahha
---
Proof?
---
Maybe he's doing Mage Arena II.
---
255 HP on dagganoth supreme would give you a little over 5HP back each kill. definitely won't dramatically increase your trips but if your inventory is set for like 150 kills (50 per DK) you would get a total of 250 HP back over the trip. 
---
I would say it really woudn't be worth it considering that's the best scenario FOR the bolts off the top of my head and you get food drops there anyways.
---
This is what happens in companies that expect people to be both project manager and QA analyst.

Which gold selling site did you use and what are the current prices?

I'm 62 RC and only trained from level 9-30 or so, the rest has been ToG and diary lamps

I'm pretty sure they ban everyone view botting indiscriminately. It's just the fake channels can create a new account and have 800 viewers in under an hour.
---
I'm not worried. I'm simply providing my input to someone who doesn't believe anyone not liking the design of that upgrade has a legitimate reason. I do. It doesn't go along with their other design mantras. Why can't it be an ornament kit etc.? Or something like the proposed Gmaul change that makes it have a viable spec or something for just PvP.
---
I edited my comment after I posted that. It seemed a bit rude to comment on the devs pay vs their competency. I think a good few of them just like the game and wanted to worked specifically at jagex
---
I just use 10 house tabs with a mounted glory in your PoH.

What PvP item exists that is upgraded purely through PvM?

I don't know why it took me this long to realize I'm being a moron. I feel like most people would delete their previous posts, but I'll leave them there for others to see my stupidity in its full glory. Whoops.
---
Not trying to be disrespectful but you basically just listed ‘they should have thought of this’ three times.
---
Not saying I don’t get it but when something goes wrong because of a factor you didn’t think of, ‘well you should have thought about it’ doesn’t actually mean anything.
---
How'd you die?
---
Pepe the cat
---
Can I move there? I have a great pasta recipe.
---
I don't know if it's a glitch but I have died wearing graceful and spawned in still wearing it.
---
Yeahhhh that seems like a super annoying bullshit, they should definitely put a stop to that
---
It buffs it outside of PvP too. The minigame has no requirements to enter or play. The weapon comes from endgame pvm 
---
Again, compare the idea of kodai being buyable at mage training arena and the master wand coming from raids. Only mage training arena is a 0 requirement 0 risk 0 cost minigame instead (LMS)
---
had to fucking fletch darts this week to get past RC so i could get my free level this morning.
---
US players get W330 for non laggy house hosts, its about time UK worlds got some love
---
F2p pvp can fuck off. You expect a large portion of your player base to play LMS exclusively on w317 as members and endure that god forsaken ping while trying to NH pk? Can you guys get a grip? It's so fucking unfair. At least make each region have their own world for it. Actually what's the point in playing it anyway, the rewards are so fantastically shit anyway. Fuck you cunt
---
How do you do that? Haven't figured it out yet.

---
There are plenty of YouTube guides out there for building certain types of accounts. Most pvp accounts that use ranged also use melee for spec, for example low level pures generally use MSB to gmaul. There are some accounts that just use ranged, the one that immediately comes to mind is a void ranger, which you should easily be able to find a guide to create on YouTube.
---
How.... How does this get past QA?
---
Literally the one and only thing I'd be testing is "let's try as many ways as we can to smuggle the items out or boosted stats out".
---
Seemingly this isn't a massive trick either? Just walk out and have boosted stats?
---
When you do abyss you're skulled so you drop it. Normally you keep it yeah.
---
I did the 2060, Gotta pull the trigger on the 1440 monitor to make it worth lol.
---
is that a bee!
---
Runecrafting, since its the biggest thing preventing me from doing the most diaries. Only other option would be maybe slayer because I wanna try Hydra boss. I'm close to 91 so I'm not that far away, but 91-95 will still take soooooo long.
---
Ah, yeah didn't think about spells. Good point.
---
hp is never limiting factor at dks if you take sgs, blood spells or something similar
---
crossbow dps compared to blowpipe is awful so i dont think anyone would use onyx bolts at dks
---
pvp updates? time to vote NO!!!!!!
---
Damn. The only luck I've had with doubles is getting double Dharok sets, and 3 axes
---
autocorrect is my downfall once again
---
look like crab, talk like people.
---
You should log that bug. It should say Konar.
---
Silly ham best weapon &lt;3
---
bruh what the heck i just got a level from mining 🦀🦀
---
🦀🦀11 dollars for these updates🦀🦀
---
Grinding 66-77 mobile at lavas atm, i enjoy it prettig much...
---
oh shit yeah I forgot about getting skulled in the abyss
---
Even fairy ring?
---
Base 60 combat (except prayer)
---
Base 40 other skills (except RC)
---
All f2p quests done
---
1m cash stack
---
Pay for your first month or two with real money.
---
10k high alch price on law runes would be as ridiculous as 9k alch price on onyx bolts
---
Same as me my man I started at 67, almost 71 and still trucking along
---
Congrats mate! Me too I got my diary cape this year it feels so good! Now go get that music (t)!!!!
---
Clue box boi. try again in the next world, my spade is ready for a new master.
---
Rune armor and a firecape?
---
Imagine dying
---
Mining has like 7 or 8 ways of training the skill. I highly doubt you've tried them all.
---
I would choose slayer and not level any combat skills.
---
Headbutt a knife you waste of oxygen
---
I think I would probably drop them. I have the shortcut but teaks are cheap.
---
No drama? I’ve been away to long
---
Wonder if any QA Devs will be sacked for this or if they'll just ban players for playing content put into the live game smh
---
Literally, go into LMS on testing server, tele out, log out, DC out. Try every way you can think of to leave the minigame other than finishing it. This bug should have been caught on one bloody run through of QA as evident by how quickly players found it and how easily Jagex hotfixed it.
---
That has to slow down your xp by at least 1k an hour
---
Wut it do
---
Just go get it from the old lady in Celadon City
---
already planning on doing that. I afk wc at work trying to get the pet
---
If we made it a risk and requirement pvp update it wouldnt pass because its pvp and risky.  You cant be happy either way.
---
I might also add, that group based pvm activities like raids, are also zero risk, and take less skill overall than pvp.
---
Pvp is still part of runescape, its been in the game almost since its inception. You kill humans all the time when they are npc’s (guards, bandits, knights) so why is it bad that you participate in pvp? 
---
Quests, skilling, and pvm, are all forced parts of PvP and anyone who pks does all parts of the game, is it far reached to suggest that players so participate in this part of the game??
---
And for you personally though, why is it that your so against pvp? Im not trying to be rude when i say this, but from almost every pvmer ive talked to that doesnt like it, the issue boils down to the fact theyre not good at it and refuse to put any time or effort into becoming better.
---
given that less than 300 people even have over 100m wc xp, I definitely do not want it to take that long
---
Nice
---
Time to use that cat for some runes to kill those dragons. The circle of life.
---
Nice*
---
Pretty sure you shouldn't even have a beaver at 20mil xp anyway
---
It was a careless mistake by Jagex, but the guy could have reported it and *not* abused it..
---
He also said abused the bug, this guy clearly didn’t abuse it, he used it and reported it.

I have 70 kc in zulrah, my personal best is 2 min 20 sec. I've had a professional view my replay and he gave me said tips. I have successfully implemented all said tips but my kill times only improved from 3 min 40 sec to 2:50-3:20. My goal is to be able to do sub 2:30 kills consistently and be able to do 2 kill trips.
---
I'll start a private chat with you and try to tell you everything I do and what flaws I have.
---
morytania hard has such high requirements for stats though
---
Im an ironman with 59. 55 is such an ez req. Currently trying to get 70 construction/herb, now thats a challenge
---
But I paid the 500k for it and I have never recovered it before
---
Oh my god I haven’t seen a candlejack meme in

Wasn't for me, I got super lucky with zenyte drops and decided to invest that gp in my zenyte jewelery before I ever really bothered with NMZ
---
Point is that your jewelery slots are by far the most important upgrades and everything else can wait quite a while
---
Its psychological warfare-you getting angry- you missing ticks etc-they win
---
Really? Will they really do nothing about it or help me out at all?
---
Sadly. Imo they need to put a requirement on pvp related polls, or simply add it without a poll. That, or add it and have a poll to remove it.  Pvp polls usually get 40-60% yes votes, so having the spoiled pvm minority that typically spite vote no, be put on the oposing end, and be forced to try to yes vote 75% would be a poeticly fitting solution.
---
In the q&amp;a reddit, they were unclear when the question arose of future updates that branch off of retail version were in thought.
---
increasing the xp/hr ion skills certainly can matter yes.
---
Haha
---
Like the thing you use the talismans on to enter?
---
who tf brings a dragon pick?
---
why would they play only a week? it's a nice and fun game
---
Nice job Jamflex
---
The divine potions aren't implemented as polled. Verbatim from the poll:
---
Should players be able to add crystal dust to Super Attack, Strength, and Defence potions as described in the blog? This will require 70 Herblore and will create Divine versions of those potions which provide the same stat boost, except it is renewed every 15 seconds for 5 minutes. If stats are reduced to a level below your base stat, the potion’s effect will wear off.
---
In game the effect persists even if you brew below your base stat.
---
Plot twist: There is no QA.
---
They take up the same space. Antidote lasts so long anyway lol. Looks like ur doing the poh method anyway. U can restock for an antidote by just teleing to lumby and hopping to pvp / when u bank ur fossils anyway. U also dont need a brew when doing poh.
---
On mobile like 30 hours. I'm at 75 rc and has to take a break
---
average person here is like 1200 total at the very best no shit they'll complain lol. although sometimes i wonder if the people here even play this game at all.
---
Zulrah. Zulrah isn't like Vorkath or other mid level bosses; the skill curve is actually pretty steep. It's one of the few boss encounters where how much you make an hour is heavily dependent on your skill rather than learning a few basic mechanics and going through the motions. At your level, Zulrah definitely has the potential to be your best moneymaker (aside from herb/birdhouse runs ofc).
---
You start out simple. Stand in the right spot. Pray the right thing. Make the right switches. Then you add some flare; start using dbow for the last hit in mage phase, do some pillar flinching, add in ring swaps, learn when you can sneak blowpipe hits in on the snakelings without losing dps on Zulrah, learn how to/when you can pray against the snakelings, add vengence into your rotation and learn how to use it properly, etc. All those little things you can do either increase your kill speed (meaning more kills/h and therefor more profit/h) or reduce damage taken (meaning less time spent banking, meaning more time fighting Zulrah, meaning more profit/h). You can also add some pray flicking in there to remove the cost of prayer potions from your supplies.
---
It's also great practice for later PvM. Learning how to switch gear and prayer quickly is pretty much a must for things like raids or the inferno. Same goes for prayer flicking; knowing how to flick (either 1 tick or lazy flick) is huge and can come in handy for all sorts of things. So if it helps, don't just think of it as a way to make money, look at it as a way to get better at the game and get your foot in the door for higher tier PvM.

---
nice appreciate the advice, one last question, whats your opinion on barb fishing to 99 fishing to get str and agility up?
---
Petition to teach this guy what a petition is
---
the code is wonky, you never know how similar it was to pots
---
Won’t continue to do it? That was never the question. He DID abuse the bug, which is bannable, period. Especially doing it to complete an ENTIRE agility lap without teleing out or anything, finishing the highest agility diary requirement 17 levels early. You don’t suddenly not abuse a bug because you stopped or reported it.
---
50s-60s in skilling stats are what Jagex considers Medium level, combat around 70-100. High level is usually 70+, with 100+ Combat.
---
Get your slayer to 75 Atleast so you can camp gargs. You could easily buy a bond within a day. Low end is 200k an hour while hike end is 600k. I did it for about 2 mil strength experience and averaged about 10 mil for every 1 mil strength experience. It took me around 30ish hours for 99 so I was making around 550k an hour.
---
Cost? And is it faster?
---
Ooooh, thanks
---
Seriously doubt your the singular victim of some freak bug that has never happened to anyone else in a game with hundreds of thousands of players.
---
And even if it did, no, they wouldn’t help you out at all.
---
Or you really appreciate me &lt;3
---
Red chins are most reliable since blacks reside in wildy.
---
Why 10 min make it 1 min and it already is to slow for skilling
---
300 IQ user posts bug abuse from alt account, secretly abuses heavily on main account under the same IP address.

They don’t even restore hardcore status for dc’s so I’m 100% sure your sol, Rip

Try typing in Sick Nerd
---
Rankings arent enough of a reward, because in OSRS, aside from a very very select few, no one cares about rankings. It isn’t prestegious like it might be for call of duty or somethinf(idk) Status in runescape is, and has always been based off of your levels and wealth.  So why not give lms some love in that regard.
---
It’ll cost you a rib and a liver. But it’s so fast. If you have 200m laying around it shouldn’t take more than a week without full focus
---
"should take about a week"
---
How many hours a day are you playing?

Whats lms mean ?

Tbow rebuild is so fun. Been doing it for the last week. I guess not a rebuild for you but still.

Unfortunately I get more points by hiding and stalling with barrage and terrain than I would if I got 1 kill and died early on.

The minigame encourages stalling by design for ppl who don't want to participate in pvp but do lms for cosmetic rewards.

Pretty Bug Abuse is super bannable in every game, cya.
---
Do you have an internet connection?
---
My client wouldn't even show up in the task manager yesterday when my internet was down
---
wow wouldn't even work like that either way. the game is all about EXTREME vertical progression. even as it stands vanilla pvp was all about abusing eng and some shitter who probably keyboard turns and clicks, 0 keybinds btw but got lucky on a few raids drop raping you with almost nothing you can do about it.
---
I honestly can say I don’t have faith that Jagex can find everyone who abused it. There should be a rollback.
---
That's probably like 15 hours a day
---
Maybe a menu to choose which loading screens to use and selects one randomly each time.
---
Depending on RNG, you can be at some sullisceps for way longer than 12 minutes. I started with Antidotes and it was just far less efficient.
---
I have a brew because my aim is to reduce the need to teleport away (which maximises XP/HR). Sometimes I'm chancing the rotation on 20-25HP so a sip does the rest. Also, I work from home and sometimes and if something comes up and I haven't left sight of a tar monster, I like the safety net of a heal. Like I said, personal preference and this helped me achieve higher rates.
---
Currently finishing off the grind to 85 (10k XP away) and my XP/HR is 86k.
---
I dislike pkers cause I’m a friendly citizen.
---
Your house looks nice
---
I'd be fone with it being a new staff. But it will still be a SotD variation, even if not an upgrade. Still, might be a better fit from the BH Crates or such.
---
I think that was more than well enough implied. No need to be pedantic.
---
Name a pvp item that doesn't come from pvm

Too used to the blowpipe probably.

Not exactly efficient for banking, but if all you want is iron for dorics or to powermine then theres gorillions of spots

"Pass the leaves"
---
me to, i staked from 1gp to almost 24tril yesterday, then i lost it
---
he's backtraced ya!
---
The problem here is only 1 player getting a drop then. If you raid in a team then you should all get the same drop, the larger the team the lower the chance at better gear. So let's say Y has a drop rate of 1/100 of you are alone then give it 1/200 for a duo but if it hits they get 1 each.
---
You even then have the option to encourage people to get really good at a raid so they can pull it off with only 1 or 2 people for the best chance at the good items.
---
Yes =P
---
If you get a pet, take the time to screenshot it... then how the hell dont you bank it ASAP??
---
The screenshots I've seen had things like 96/54 magic, etc. And we don't know what Jagex will do but I can't imagine them blanket permabanning for doing 1 task, aka "testing" it. Those will probably just have the task completion removed.
---
I dont think planning a revolt means you dont need to eat anymore.
---
Then u realize there's an elite hidden in your bank
---
He's still pretty active online as Joji.  He was just on First We Feast a few weeks ago.  Sadly a lot of his edge faded away with age and a booming music career.  I honestly liked his old low production stuff a lot more though.  Can't really compete with trap dumplings or fried noodles.
---
I don’t think they have dedicated QA. This means they have devs with inflated egos testing their own work, so they don’t catch oversights because they don’t expect to find any.
---
As an owner of a 15hz monitor, I cap my FPS at 20 so my nvidia 2080 BC doesn’t overheat
---
But that wasn't possible.
---
Discovering would be seeing that your stats are still boosted after leaving, exploiting would be taking advantage of that fact. You could easily start the ardy agility course without completing it to see if in fact it was real or not.
---
So you have nothing to add to the conversation other than being upset with what is essentially a meme? Yeah, it’s a childish reply because it was meant to be, I didn’t really care to get into the details of what I assumed was a shitpost.  
---
  
---
Try not to be so offended on other people’s behalf.
---
Good meme
---
Anything more than that? It takes more than one bad quest to prove OSRS quests are better than RS3s.
---
well you are a green crown

---
Holy shit they’re adding kill emotes lmaoooo
---
Reddit is the QA.
---
All you had to do was click the course to know if it would work. Completing the diary is bug abuse.
---
There's no possible way that they can tell whether someone purposely solicited the bug to exploit it, or did so by accident.  The OP is 100% on point.  If they ban people, they will end up banning people who never set out to abuse a bug.
---
Dont stake lol
---
I've made up my mind, I'm tired of grinding all the time

"My neighbor left his door unlocked, so I should be allowed to steal his shit".  
---
-Your moral code apparently?
---
The problem is power miners who are dropping it anyway take the spots best for banking even though they are not doing any bank trips. The worst are the ones that complain when you pick up their dropped ore.
---
Yeah I just want to get base 80s for acceptable bossing stats then it's strength range and mage for zulrah / slayer etc
---
No dragon diamond bolts (e)?
---
I mean a present button, not forcing people to whip only.
---
I think bug abuse bans were usually more centered on *less* obvious ones where the player had to do a crazy combination of things to get the bug to work.  Really obvious ones seem little more like the fault falls on Jagex.  Would you say that anyone who went to pick up the free Twisted Bow should have been banned?

---
I just went thru this too because I had deleted the main email address associated with the account. I just got mine approved today! (Had been working on it since yesterday and googled how to resolve) Here's the main things to get it approved:
---
1. If the recovery questions listed arent things like, "What is your name, birthday etc..." then click that you dont have any set.
---
2. Make sure you try at least 3 different passwords. Even if you know you only had one, you never know. So at least list 3.
---
3. If you can provide the last 4 digits of a credit card you used this is super vital.
---
4. Knowing the internet provider at the time you played in 07
---
5. In the writing section, write your name, your dob, and what city/state you made the account in and then where you moved to and what date you moved.
---
Hope this works for you!
---
Congrats man! I'm working on the same thing atm, just have the desert diary left!
---
I do not understand the occult proposal, it says it will half the magic bonus but double the accuracy, but I thought magic accuracy was magic bonus, unless u meant half the magic damage bonus?

Yes, but I'm only speaking officially when I have a green name, which is very seldom.
---
is this a joke or

smh no respect for the culture

Neiz shouldn’t be more than what the NPC sells it to you for. Most people have a Neiz in their bank I believe.
---
If you have the Karamja Elite step done with 50 runecrafting then it’s going to be pretty obvious.

---
Last Man Standing
---
Only the first and third obstacles actually require 90 agility anyways; the rest of the course does not.  If you really wanted to just test to see if it worked, you could have stopped after the third obstacle or even the first obstacle when it let you start the course.
---
I'm not happy with any bug abuse.
---
What you've done is somewhat minor, and you claim you were going to do it anyway, but you should not be let off with anything less than wiping that step from your diary completion or whatever may be necessary to accomplish that.  As you know, it is a bannable offense and you went beyond what was necessary to prove the bug.
---
Slayer, you'll make bank while you do it too

---
NPC doesn’t sell it. It is given to you and then if you lose it you can buy it back for 50k. GE sells it for 55k or so but it fluctuates in price up and down around that
---
Tbh I'd get base 30s with the exception of runecrafting
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if they were playing with Mod Jed!
---
Bond now out bro
---
Yes, they are one of the few slayer monsters that need you to actively engage, unlike gargoyles or sth similar. And thank you :)
---
How poor are you? If you have a decent amount of gp try out flipping. You can make more than sharks flipping with like 10m.
---
It's not a comparison. I'm stating that its very grindy and take tons of time for a non experienced player. Thus 1 month from now the player count will highly dwindle and people will go back to their regular games. In this case: OSRS
---
Im legit scared now why
---
Please remove the Dark Bow from LMS.  I have played hundreds of games of LMS and I have yet to be hit by one.  I've tried using it in conjunction with DDing or hugging to mitigate the penalties that come with the slow attack cycle but it's just not worth it.  The switches get complicated and it takes up two whole inventory spots.
---
It is by far the most useless item in LMS.  No one uses it ever.
---
No. That is very incorrect. Go to old school runescape wiki and look up recipe for disaster.
---
Wait why?
---
That's what they said about the Tbow spawn. Seems like they take the approach of "we can fix it until we can't"
---
Your stats are above average for a free player overall, I would train your attack to 50 and your prayer to 43 at hill or moss giants so you can utilize granite weaponry and protect prayers which will make members quests significantly easier.
---
press x to doubt

shhhh let people enjoy things.

---
You can buy it back for 50k from Mawnis bro, so why would it go up in price? It's a little more in the GE to save you the hassle of traveling back to the NPC that sells it. The attachment to upgrade it is going to be a drop from a new monster, so that will be the expensive part.
---

Obviously with no understanding of your personal life, so this advice may not be applicable, but in my opinion buying membership with real life money rather than grinding for bonds makes the game more enjoyable. Having to grind up 3/4m every two weeks can be tedious depending on level/commitment to grinding.
---
If you are dead set on bonding for membership. The game does open up so many more activities so I don’t see any reason not to buy one now. Even the increase of items to buy/sell will significantly increase your profit/hour vs trading on f2p in my opinion
---
What do you where at 126?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
yes they did? the original creation poll for osrs had weekly and bi-weekly updates in it. if we got more votes we would actually have a bigger team with more common updates.
---
From all my fellow noobs without karamja gloves
---
Yeah I think that change happened when they brought in Song Of The Elves or something. Might have also been when they took out the world-hop limit.
---
Holy fuck.
---
slutty cat girl costume for a halloween cosmetic reward lmao
---
The classic team has been very open with the community and I do not believe they are the kind of devs to ruin the game with micro transactions etc. The community backlash would be terrible for everyone involved.

---
The “high levels” are actually just mining bots in f2p. Bots plaguing the game is a horrible turn off for someone just coming back to f2p. They’ll probably assume members is the same and just quit. I’ve heard it a lot when I ask people if they tried the game. Real way to get real recurrent players staying in the game is to make f2p more accessible while not killing off the nostalgia.
---
Imo they look better.
---
I'm fine with one or the other, or it degrading into some kind of "essence" that can be used for repairs, the problem is, people wouldn't want to pk someone for an upgraded occult and get nothing.

me, I love how people still acting like its osrs vs wow. Not everyone who played RS played WoW. They're two completely incomparable games.
---
cox duos are extremely hard compared to trio's. i'd never recommend learning in a duo lol, you guys will want to die. duos are a struggle pre-olm and then if learning you have to suicide brews/restores into olm. trios pre-olm are basically afk and then olm is basically a joke too.
---
In 2007 when you died your loot appeared to everyone
---
If you're trying to learn with nothing but learner's I recommend 3 ppl minimum it will be much easier for olm turning the head, if you have experienced ppl to teach you, 4-6 is good. I'm not saying you can't duo, you can get a kill it will just be quite difficult to learn
---
oh ok.
---
Cool I got guthan early too. Enabled me to afk nmz for combat levels.
---
Sure but mage head and no Ava's?

I played enough on private vanilla wow servers to not even want to try classic

why was this on the front page of reddit!?! I forgot where I was surfing for a sec lol

---
Ascent of arceeus, corsair curse, depths of despair, vampire slayer, mountain daughter are 5 quests that give low def bosses that a pure can do. Mountain daughter gives pray exp though. 
---
If you can get roving elves done it gives moss guardian which is one of the best bosses
---
Everyone says this but I rarely get jellies/dusts tasks to burst.  It's just gargs, demonic etc which are slow xp

My name is Rod, and I like to party.

they did update some things at least, because they mentioned in a post that in making classic they made it intentionally easy as possible to release TBC onwards later if that was what was decided

It’s a joke

Well, I am now...

If you need to break it up into many parts it might be too much to a skill. I'll try and follow this, but to me skills in general should be easy and self-explanatory.
---
More skill ideas is good though and I do believe this will be a good read.
---
@JagexRoq  
---
If Last Man Standing ever really takes off and is still packed months from now, would you consider adding a hidden rank system in game similar to the ones many popular games on console like Xbox/PS4 use?    
---
In short, the game watches you and takes note of your performance and if it sees that you're continuously a garbage player, it gives you a priority rank that gives you some sort of *slight* advantage. Ideally you'd get put into a separate game with other people who suck. Or people who are really good get given a higher priority so they go into the next game, and the noobs are more likely to go into their own game after that. In essence, the people who are extremely good are more likely to be assigned to play with people in their 'league' so to speak. This gives them a more challenging fight, while keeping the noobs away from severe disappointment. I mean, we want LMS to be an encouraging entry into PVP right? 
---
    
---
I know this doesn't seem very 'OSRS-like', but even nature itself does this thing where animals who are really good at play fighting (usually adults) feign weakness every 3rd time or so to keep the kids or less advanced fighters continuously interested in playing, and therefore learning how to be as good as the adults are in the process.   
---
In Mario Kart this makes it's appearance as a person who sucks getting blue turtles so to speak. Eventually as they learn to drive better they don't fall back as much, and therefore no longer need the blue turtles to level the playing field.  
---
If you could add something that makes it just SLIGHTLY more likely that a terrible player has a chance at points, then these noobs will continue to populate the games. The advanced players continue to play because they love destroying noobs, or feeling challenged, and they feel like a god. And the noobs continue to play because they feel like they, "almost had it this time!" or "I did much better!"  or "I know JUST what to do this next game!"  
---
You don't want people to have that feeling where they want to throw the controller at the wall because they were sniped by someone they couldn't see, as the gap between starter and advanced in PVP is extremely large. But rather rush back into the game because, like Rocket League, they felt like they actually had a chance at having some control in the outcome. Even if it's just to die in the amount of people required to get 1 point. Rather than never make it each time.  
---
It takes 100+ points to get some of the loot these noobs might want. If they're not good enough to get even 1 point at least 1/3 of the time. I suspect that they're going to be participating in LMS and these are the future pker's who would be considered as advanced. Because you learn by actually doing it.
---
I mean the item is supposed to allow you to keep defenders when dying in deep wildy and you also have to pay a fee when you lock them (iirc they said its 2m for a void set), so the time to get one seems kinda off.
---
I feel like I must be missing something about this
---
This is my take on a suggestion by /u/vercrazy, which was posted in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cu2kty/give_me_your_craziest_suggestions_for_the_game/) last week. I'll be adapting most of the suggestions there over the next little while as a fun exercise. Let me know what you think!
---
Really really appreciate it. Took that long break starting back in 2017 and sort of starting up in the pure scene again. Anyway much respect this helps heaps
---
Cool
---
literally every game is like that though. i had to quit games like league/csgo because they were actually unbearable. i like playing games for fun and not being called the n word every 0.2 seconds and how i should be burned and tortured.
---
This is a bad idea because it'll encourage people to suicide as fast as possible and rejoin a game.  Or just join a game and proceed to afk.  Or bot LMS without any pking.  If you're bottom 4 then you simply can join a new game
---
I like the premise but dont think the idea is feasible. Ignore the trolls, theyre having a bad day and take it out on people
---
Ohh ok, thanks. That was the issue. I changed my email to an old email, and THEN tried to reset my pass through the old email. 
---
It said it was successful because I had an old RS account associate with that old email. 
---
I've since resolved the issue, thanks!
---
Love all the updates and poll stuff. Is LMS and the rest of the wildy with the mage buff (as in splashing less?)?. 
---
I'll have to log on after my WOW session today, great timing to bring the pkers who are sick of osrs and are playing wow back to osrs.
---
It’s kinda gey

Vorkath with dhl is better than blowpipe method actually, and cheaper.
---
Well once you unlock nechs smoke devils and have dust devils, they are all very high weighted tasks that you will receive very often. If you burst all the tasks given to you via slayer you WILL get well over 99 mage from doing so.
---
Why would RS have to be about hatinf WoW? Sure they might share an audience and WoW might be taking away some of Runescape's possible players, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to enjoy the other game. Look at other genres, there's nothing wrong with liking Minecraft and Terraria, nothing wrong with liking Dota and League. Tetris and Minesweeper? Go for it. Heck, it's even fine for a PUBG player to play some Fortnite if they want to.
---
Are you going to cry about bgs, zgz, Pharos sceptre, and dragon pick too?
---
If it's annoying, stop being a baby and put it in the stash.
---
Well, the Ranching post took me forever to make because I tried to both focus on lots of small things and a singular, overarching concept that worked as a new skill. Now, I'd like to get community feedback on various ideas before I post the finished product. In the end, there's extremely little chance this ends up in the game (even after lots of modifications by Jagex), so this is really only for fun.

&gt;I'm 100 cmb with a 40m bank but still feel like a huge noob
---
You're still a huge noob lol. People stop being noobs at ~120cb and 200m+ bank.
---
Yea time to ban all 3rd party clients. Wait no that won’t happen
---
Doesn't even need to be 10 minutes, but yea a cooldown is perfect. It stops it being used every 20 seconds for Skilling.
---
2 minute cooldown would prevent it changing skilling, but still allow it for PvP and PvM.
---
Wtf is dat room?
---
That does put things in perspective, and I wasn't aware suiciding would be that many points/hour compared to playing normally. I'm happy to admit I'm wrong when I am and yeah my bad. I just gotta keep trying and get  good I guess.
---
Well, they didn’t.
---
So where do we go from there? Are these devs just not qualified to make OSRS anymore because they missed something?
---
Just because it’s someone’s job doesn’t mean they become perfect at it. These developers are human, after all. They will make mistakes, they will miss things they ‘should have’ caught.
---
Just like you do.
---
I just don’t understand what people are after when they post stuff like this - if it happens over and over extremely often, and your point is that these people are too incompetent to do their job properly and should be replaced, that’s fine. I don’t agree with it but I can understand the complaining in that case. 
---
But otherwise you’re just pissing into the wind. People make mistakes, and ‘you shouldn’t have made that mistake’ isn’t worth anything.
---
You can claim you didn't bot to the point that even you believe your own lies, but no one else will.
---
Silverpine? Or roll alliance? Idk there are so many people competing for mobs in barrens it definitely sucks but it’s also pretty rad seeing so many people join in on the hype train
---
The GPU plugin doesn't support macOS, so this probably isn't the issue.
---
If this is how you talk online then I wonder how you manage face to face conversations.
---
I needed that man, really, I appreciate you. I'm gonna try and remember when I get home , I leave work in an hour so hopefully I remember. I can still set the pin with the bank clerk in game right ?
---
Someone just put the numbers out there vs what suiciding vs playing normally would be and it's scarily close and I can understand the concern more now. My bad and I get where you're coming from now.
---
Oh I see, thanks.
---
double your monkey at varrock grand exchange - this will help to pay for any of the goals that are coming up in the near future.

the gold doublers will typically type something in game like ' doubling money '. trade them all your gold for the most practical outcome.

Similar story on my end. If I do even manage to get past the second guy then the next has figured out how to sonic boom and dash around the joint and run around trees.

PvP seems to be too much for my small mind

LMS was fine as it was. Now it's just fucking Edgeville Bank PVP with some shitty rewards tacked on.

Holy shit the amount of people giving bad advice below this comment it’s infuriating. Ehh whatever they would rather sit on Reddit then get better at the game.

Jagex 'owns' rsbuddy so if he botted with that client of course they found out, I only bot on the dance floor 💃

This isn't 3rd party, its native to the game, how your friends show green and clan mates show purple.

I just bought Bigger and Badder with my first slayer points. I was wondering what I should prioritize next to spend my slayer points on. Any suggestions?
---
step1 - points farm: farm points with most bosses enabled. enable as many bosses as u can (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nightmare_Zone/Strategies guide), rockcake to 1hp &amp; use overloads/supcombat and possibly praypots for piety too.
---
*once you're ready step 1 wont be needed again, as you'll get enough points from afking to continue afking forever*
---
--------
---
step2 - afk train: nmz afk with full obby + 100% hp method. don't bother with overloads or rockcakes. you can easily afk for 20min durations, and 1 inv lasts to the 6 hour logout mark as well.
---
refer as closely as you can to this guide: https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/akpdrt/afk_nightmare_zone_in_2019/eiqub74/
---
touched my heart brother hope your day treats you well
---
Bonds aren't even ***close*** to the mtx and shit in rs3
---
why not. what exactly is wrong with dropping xrystal weaponry and untradeables before death to spare them from being lost? 
---
this is definitely one of those sweaty nerd posts where people pretend to care about gold sinks. no one cares that youre voting no btw, so no reason to tell us; plenty of other butthurt individuals already do so. 
---
have you ever tried dropping shit before you died and rushing back before 2 mins to get your things back? its not easy and a lot of people dont have the skill or reflexes to do it. and in many cases youll be one banged before you have the chance.
---
I’ve had this this too, noticed a few times my prayers been 0 and I haven’t even used my prayers whilst in combat
---
I noticed that while GE people flex on each other all the time, people at CoX never really boast about anything. ToB 416 is a different story tho.
---
I imagine its 0 if they've never done it. 500 is what it starts at. 
---
Other than that I don't know TBH. Don't even know if it goes up or down if you're doing well lol
---
He probably auto clicked.
---
Thank you, you too man
---
Lmfao I use English when I talk to my friend is that u Josh
---
x
---
What the hell? Why
---
You should be using piety for slayer unless you're hardcore afking with a cannon or something
---
it would be relevant if they weren't q&amp;a moderators
---
It's pretty crazy how many trash tier cosmetics easter events have produced.
---
Pharroh Scepter. stop crying
---
I'm gonna go ahead and say no to that one dawg. Didn't even even get one of the customer support guys lmao
---
This is what it looks like when I get up at 7est. Looks normal to me
---
one more note: if you don't want to do true 20-min afk (you should, you can easily do 16 hour days of afk which nets you more XP in the longrun) and want to tryhard for a bit higher xp:
---
overloads + rockcake to 1hp + nmz hard mode + switch to dharoks if you're 92hp or higher (not 87)
---
Do they have better RC training over there? I hope they do for everyone's sake lol
---
You can skip pretty easily in duos. Just dump the learner on melee and have the person teaching do mage skips
---
Agility is kinda useless after low 90s because that's when you have enough run regen to make the full run at Zeah RC. Somewhere in the 70s is where you start experiencing diminishing returns for Agility though.
---
Oh whoops wasn’t aware it was in vanilla client. Still the same though since 3rd party clients will just do it instead if jagex remove it, and the vast majority of people at lms will be using them
---
this one is way worse.
---
I'm at the same stage as you (100cb and 40m bank) but I got quest cape and boy is vorkath fun! You should definitely do at least ds2 for the boss because it's so profitable and fun!
---
Why 1x1?
---
I thought 2x2 bosses would be better because it would stop as many from hutting you at once?
---
lance method is approximately the same if not more profit than dhcb, as well as being easier to woox walk with and making kill times more consistent
---
Got all that. Maxed melee and ranged.
---
What’s wow?
---
funny because i sell mortgages for a living so i talk to like 40 people a day every day every minute of every second of every time
---
Allow f2p players to take tea from the Varrock tea stall, but the seller stops them and makes them pay 10gp for it. After the interaction a card comes up explaining that thieving is a member's skill and they could have saved 10gp by purchasing a membership.
---
He’s just using references for us to picture.
---
The real shit is being a cool dude by making fun of people having fun.
---
U can't compare law runes to onyx bolts or bolt tips.
---
The onyx bolts got their alch value because it comes from a high tier gem or u need to fight strong ish npcs or npcs that are in dangerous locations.
---
consider getting 65 atk, or even 75.
---
65 attack is what i cap at, because fuck ags easyscape.....
---
the leaf-bladed axe is the weapon that is unlocked @65 attack / 55 slayer. it is arguable worth it because the max hit is higher than the d scims, + has a interesting delay in combat.
---
Yep. That's what pays for my bonds.
---
go for 60 m8ning before members, besides that your stats are ready. do all f2p quests too
---
Vorkath is a actually really easy. I struggle to learn bosses quite a bit and I have to do them loads more times than my mates, just to get the gist of it. 
---
Which bit are you struggling with?
---
I was attempting to login through the website each time, the OSRS Mobile is where I found out it was disabled.  But through the website I cant  login.
---
Lol for my first kill I learned the easiest rotation and did it all with bp and dragon darts. Took way too many tries and a lot of luck
---
the black night northeast of varrock was the first thing to ever kill me, it was 2007 and i thought i could take him...i could not
---
The round one tends to pull the cheese with it if it’s not sharp enough the curved blade is just a quick slice across
---
Maybe stuck wasn't the right word, but it's like this position: https://i.imgur.com/MTtBoGz.png
---
Where you drop in XP/hr by a noticeable amount since it takes so long for the next one to hit you.
---
I’ve been playing osrs while I’m in queues for wow classic. As a person who played rs2 instead of wow. A lot of the quests early on are pretty much the following:
---
Kill something a certain number of times,
---
Talk to somebody/deliver item,
---
Fetch an item 
---
I’m assuming the quests get more in-depth as you level higher. But I’ve been enjoying it so far, besides those 10hr queues lol
---
The same thing I do every day u/Pops_rustafied, train Runecrafting.
---
I know it's the 3rd rotation but it all comes down to mentality
---
Especially on the agility ones, since those are some of the most tedious.
---
Pretty much yes. Go to a slayer master and they will tell you to kill x amount of monsters and you get slayer xp for each one you kill
---
Bet you used Justiciar to get it smh
---
Tbh I did plunder. Went by in a flash. Just do the level 31 and 41 rooms.
---
 You're right, I mean none of these are actually an issue for my main because i can just buy them and don't care if they sit in my bank. I just hate pyramid plunder and have gone super dry on sceptre. It's a me problem.
---
Trying to find out how often red dragons drop a d med, or at least how often they hit the rare drop table. I’m wondering if this info is out there anywhere. It would be so sick if we had access to the raw data from the Runelite loot tracker
---
Number of traps hunter can set
---
Have you grinded out a PvM pet? I know our options are kinda limited at 1 def but it’s definitely doable, and far more enjoyable in my opinion
---
Just mopped up a ton of diaries I had the reqs for but hadnt done yet, 37.5k free Runecraft xp from it.
---
Did all my farm runs for some sweet xp and a couple rounds of wintertodt thrown in before bed
---
Yep, I notice I do better at zulrah when I try to eat minimally. A lot of times I fail because I didn’t do enough damage fast enough
---
That's what worked in the end! Thanks
---
Had most all quests done smh,
---
usa is the only good one
---
Honestly, I really wouldn't. Using a bug to complete an achievement is certainly abuse of it. Getting up on to the agility course might be testing. Also, you can't "not tell a soul" when the devs can check everyone who got the achievement and their stats. I'm not risking my account that I've put a lot of work into to finish a diary task 15 hours faster.
---
I came back to the game about 6 months ago. I can play maybe 1-2 hours a day 4/5 days a week.
---
I’ve got pretty much all the stuff I looked up to as a kid and nowadays it’s like mid tier gear.
---
Sure the level grind gets boring at times in wow but please explain how thats any different than grinding out any skill in runescape? From the first paragraph it doesn't really sound like you made it past 20. There are more interesting quests out there than kill or gather x.
---
So I can already start doing slayer at lv3 combat?
---
Master farmers are easy. Might grab some good seeds too. Grab some dodgy necklaces’ from the ge and you’re good to go lad.
---
Its just the gnome on a rack from mournings end part 1
---
Yep. Pyramid plunder man, buy that pharoh scepture(if you didn’t do the quests for PYramid plunder city) tele to the spot, grind for 2-3 hours tops and you’ll be there, then sell the scep back to the ge
---
Yeah considering the name I’m sure this just another unoriginal individual that’s copying popular you tube series.
---
How do you have over 1k kc already? I’ve been doing hespori since it came out every time I could and I’m barely at 400 even with Kronos planted
---
The next agility requirement for diaries after this one is boostable from 80, on top of everything else you've said being just as dumb. But yeah I'm retarded. :^)
---
Cooking: 500k+ xp/h and afk
---
Farming: 1m+ xp/h time spent and no effort
---
Fishing: Afk
---
Magic: 300k xp/h and afk
---
Smithing: 300k+ xp/h and afk
---
Thieving: Nearly 300k xp/h
---
So yes, this is one of the biggest diary requirements in terms of combined time and energy investment.
---
No problem dude!
---
Yeah last time I played I got to 67 but after seeing swampletics I really like the idea of being self sufficient. I would never do ultimate though. That seems like torture, bless his soul.
---
Now I'm just trying to decide if it's worth signing up again. I haven't felt this conflicted in years.
---
Oh I know what it is ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I'm literally making a point on how games come out, people play them, then go back to games they've been playing forever. Thats it. Disregard OSRS or WoW. It's a general statement.
---
Just go in with your main since I think it disables bosses that aren't available on your alt. Keep in mind it's only 1.5m pts/hr if you have literally every boss unlocked, you can expect closer to like 700-1200k pts/hr otherwise, as long as you have Dream Mentor completed. Without Dream Mentor though it drops by a lot more.
---
Enable every boss except Corrupt Lizardman, Witch's Experiment, Elvarg, Slagilith, Nazastarool, Dagannoth Mother, Glod, Chronozon, Giant Roc, and Barrelchest. IDK anything about the Song of the Elves bosses so IDK if you're supposed to enable them or not. You'll need Ice Gloves, Prayer Potions, Locator Orb or Rock Cake, Absorption Potions, and Overloads. If you don't have the latter 2, just do NMZ hard with 5 melee bosses and prayer potions for protect Melee to get some points to buy those potions from the reward shop. I usually get like 12 Overload Doses, 24 Absorption, the rest are Prayer potions.
---
"REEEE THAT'S IN RS3 REEEEEE"
---
You ranging or melee
---
Yeah you can go to Turael in Burthorpe and get slayer tasks from him at combat level 3
---
Think about what you just said
---
ok thanks fam!
---
Lmfaoooo
---
I was under the impression that rats usually run in circles when they have been poisoned
---
I don't have the layout for you but that house isnt well laid out. It's huge and full of stuff you won't use which makes it take a good two or three seconds longer to load. It's also not an efficient load out for pvm.
---
The recommendation is to keep houses 3x3 or smaller and have only one floor.
---
Thats why you dont auto click haha. Gotta stay eatching the screen
---
Wrong. He started playing during the summer and got banned after his friends showed him osbuddy. 2 weeks and he got nabbed and now he thinks the game is shit lol.
---
What do you get from 83 and what does it cost? Is that enough for the jewellery box and the pool?
---
Everyone understand this, but a high clue drop rate from implings means that there’s essentially insignificant variance when attempting to purchase 100+ clues. 
---
You can very much expect in the long term that a medium clue scroll will cost 100k gp, so I’d say that they are very much purchasable
---
It's too much like rs3.
---
First idea in the thread I can get behind
---
No i'm not? I'm making a general statement on how games come out, people play them, then go back to the games they've been playing for years. It's literally a general statement.
---
Same. And i want to get into it, but i dont know if i can support another mmorp in my life
---
i see 117
---
He’s at 117?
---
Range with DHCB, anguish, rigour
---
Thanks.

I figured that was the answer. I could liquidate a lot of my bank to have maybe 75mil for gear, but I was mainly concerned whether levels in Cox were more important than gear.
---
I think so, just check for people who have too low of levels to do quests that they’ve done (outside of boosting etc) and remove the completion and any quest rewards from them.
---
Thing has a botfly
---
It will hatch into a bot
---
Jagex remove rats this is how we get bots
---
Yes 😂
---
Tbh, Armadyl and Bandos Halos is really nice for GWD so I think it's fine them being more expensive and if you just want a generic halo go to castle wars (Saradomin and Zammy halos are still useful eitherway).
---
They'd get the tea, they'd just have to pay 10gp for it
---
I can raise about 18m cash and keep everything else that I want. I’ll try watching a flipping guide or something
---
telekinetic theater to 200m xp
---
Don't forget the Arma and Bandos Halos work in GWD from LMS.
---
Why are you so relatable 😢
---
I’m currently trying to sell cats to homeless people so I can get a cape made out rocks.
---
Very nice! One small mistake, no one kills revs with a glory unless skulled, salve ei ftw!
---
Checking at a 15-20 minute interval is pretty different than every 5. This method isn't about any kind of efficiency. It's about how long you can go without checking in on it. Overloads are definitely better for regular check-ins.
---
Ugh imbues should not come from lms.
---
GL
---
grinding bonds slows down the progression of a new account by a huge amount, could never recommend it at low-med level account.
---
Congrats on getting max Runecrafting level
---
Just blitzed through 2 games of barb assault with clan members. I am now about 20 points shy of 375 on all 4 roles for the fighter torso.
---
Quite annoying actually!
---
I highly suspect they ment the magic damage bonus. So it'd be instead of +12 Magic Attack, +10% Magic Damage, +2 Prayer it'd be +24 Magic Attack, +5% Magic Damage, +2 Prayer.
---
why
---
Just get more money lol
---
&gt;"How many times have you shit yourself for a second place record?"
---
Omnia should def be by far the best osrs clan in this category
---
There is respect. That guy is just an asshole
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Wolf, Bruno, Ash, Roq
---
2.  Announcements
---
  *  Tomorrows update is LMS update, Line of sight stuff, Rewards etc. 12 additional rewards that we want to poll (keep an eye out for that news post).
---
3.  What is the team's opinion on more BIS (or close to it) non-tradable gear/abilities that comes from questing/activities? Barrows gloves is one of the few items that is memorable (and an accomplishment) because after RFD it's extremely easily accessible.
---
  *  Roq: The problem is that after getting the item after the quest, there's no real money to be made in that way (compared to something that a boss drops). So it's good to have a healthy mix of some that are and some that aren't. --- Bruno: Think we have a good balance now for tradeable BIS and untradeable BIS --- Ash: Especially now that we've got more mechanics for how they drop when a player dies (broken items/dropping coins when being PKed).
---
4. Would you be willing to run suggestion contests with the player base? Such as an item sink suggestion contest?
---
  *  Roq: So long as it is something that we aren't committing to without polling! --- Ash: Rooftop and Motherlode mine were polled as PDC so we are onboard! Might be nice to poll what topics players might want the next PDC to be.
---
5. What happened to the personal projects of the OSRS developers? Mod Ed mentioned them being cancelled in 2018 in the dev blog posted earlier today which was the first I had heard of their removal. Why were these cancelled and what, if anything, replaced them?
---
  *  Roq: TAPP projects were put on hold for a while to more focus on the objective of things we wanted to get in-game at the time. Staff are allowed and encouraged to do personal projects in this way - LMS for example was a TAPP project for Roq. Fremennik exiles was also a TAPP project for Wolf. --- In-game clickable broadcast links was Ash's TAPP one! 
---
6. With warding not passing the poll, This must have freed up quite a lot of time throughout the team, What is this time going to be used for?
---
  *  Roq: It didn't use up a lot of the teams time in the first place! It initially involved a few meetings, designer and a community manager every now and then. Business as usual really, LMS and other things. 
---
7. Can we have a deposit pet button in the bank, like the others?
---
  *  Yeah sure that would be nice, so long as it's toggle-able. Would be handy!
---
8. Will there ever be a sink for extra god pages/blessings? Maybe they can be used on a base god book/blessing to imbue it with charges for a very minor stat increase. Charges used per attack while it’s worn.
---
  *  Roq: Don't think that the books themselves are desirable? --- Would like to find a use for them but this doesn't feel like it. 
---
9. How are you going to stop completionist clans boosting LMS for rewards?
---
  *  The Rewards won't actually appear on the collection log because they can be sold back to the shop for a number of points back. This isn't a mechanic that we like with Castle-wars. Boosting clans won't do it for collection log but if people are abusing it for the rewards then we'll look at addressing it. There will be also 1 members world so doubt people will boost.
---
10. Can you add quantity buttons on the desktop version of the bank interface?
---
  *  Yeah we can poll that.
---
11. Could we get an agility shortcut to Duradel to run up the wall in Shilo Village?
---
  *  There's a couple of ways to access him already, not looking to add another.
---
12. Can you add a travel option on the boat on Lunar Isle back to Rellekka?
---
  *  Yeah that makes sense, like it.
---
13. When is Fremennik Exiles coming?
---
  *  Can't say! The poll be coming soon (end of this week) so keep an eye on that. - Later during Q&amp;A 'Presumably within the next 3-6 Weeks'
---
14. Any plans on new prayer gear?
---
  *  Proselyte is pretty good as it is. Ash would like to do a Slug quest sequel but again since Proselyte is pretty good, so might have to find a niche reward instead of just having a good prayer bonus.
---
15. Can divine potion be buffed to when creating them?
---
  *  Believe it was created that way to purposefully not change herblore rates.
---
16. Can Golden tench be moved to the off-hand slot?
---
  *  It's a standard fun weapon with accompanying stats. It could be done if people want it.
---
17. Can we have more trophy hotspots in the skill hall, there's currently a couple of hotspotless walls and a massive number of slayer heads that can be obtained. Would you consider adding a hunter trophy hotspot in the skill hall to revitalise some lesser used hunter methods (e.g. pit traps)
---
  *  Sure it could accommodate more things there yeah. 
---
18. Can revenant caves have something changed to limit scouting?
---
  *  Ash: Don't have a problem doing it, did have a discussion with a few players and it is that the requirements could be met pretty quickly or once they're obtained on scout accounts the problem returns. --- Roq: Scouts have kind of always been a thing... We can do it but but it really is up to the player. If there's a genuine issue we can look into it. --- Wolf: Agree.
---
19. Can we make the auto-chat not automatically filter, this currently makes it impossible to compete with a chat-bot on house-hosting worlds for example.
---
  *  The house interface passed a poll and Mod Maz has finished the work on it and hope to see it out in the next few weeks! 
---
20. Can the moss giants in the wilderness drop the mossy key at a half the rate (1/75) like the hill giants do to stay more consistent. 
---
  *  Have looked into that and there's already a double rate if you are on-task anyway.
---
21. The moss boss should also always drop an ensouled giant head just like Obor. 
---
  *  Don't have a problem with that, that makes sense - fair enough!
---
22. Can the barcrawl minigame be updated to include the new pub in Lumbridge?
---
  *  We could in theory - it wouldn't update for accounts that have already done it! Probably a bit much dev work for little/no real gain!
---
23. What about rune-shrines? Like bird-houses on Lunar isle but give Runecrafting XP and runes.
---
 * No sorry! 
---
24. What's the room beside Saradomin GWD room when you zoom out?
---
  *  The underwater passage was meant to be when you go through to Zamorak area (this was originally the plan to swim through some monsters etc). 
---
25. Will the Neitisnot helm be an upgrade from a new boss drop or just as a reward for completion of the quest?
---
  *  You will have the kill the new slayer creature, the Basilisk Knight. Similar to Hydra they will be able to drop it more on task and vice-versa. 
---
26. Can we get a way to obtain the dragon pickaxe other than Wilderness bosses?
---
  *  Ash: While I don't particularly like that a mining item comes from a Wilderness only boss... Would rather not take it away from Wildy bosses. --- Bruno: The Wilderness boss factor keeps the price higher and makes it more rewarding rather than it being easily farmed like the DKs so like it how it is now.
---
27. What happened to coloured hitsplats?
---
  *  Ash: Made quite a lot of progress on that one, it's not a small job! All the custom damage scripts for NPCs will need to be changed to a new format so that it knows who did the damage (so that you can see your splat vs someone else's). There's well over 100 of those scripts throughout the game. May be a little while! 
---
28. Using scales on Blowpipe and Serp Helm defaults to all, can we choose how much?
---
  *  No it will be more annoying for more people - just withdraw the right amount when you withdraw from your bank. Maybe/No what's the real benefit?
---
29. (in reply to the answer about coloured hitsplats) Should the game not already know who's doing the damage to reward drops?
---
  *  The game only knows at the end of the fight - when the create dies (with allowance for Ironmen). The monster only has the ID of the player that last hit the monster so the hitsplat scripts do actually have to be changed!
---
30. Can you make the Crystal Pickaxe for Guardians in Chambers of Xeric?
---
  *  Roq/Ash: There was some reason for this not happening - someone manually updated that code to make it so that the Crystal Pic wasn't better. Maybe to make it so that the Crystal wasn't required for high-end teams. Maybe poll? 
---
31. Now that Captain Barnaby travels between Rimmington as well as Ardougne and Brimhaven, can you update it to have a right-click travel option?
---
  *  Yes this is coming out tomorrow! 
---
32. Any plans to add a user for excess Hespori seeds? These can build up quicker than a player could use them, perhaps trade them for seeds?
---
  *  Could do something like at Wintertodt, where excess seeds can be traded for a seed pack or a seed roll? 
---
33. Can the process of Chiselling Limestone into Limestone Bricks be automated? Not as fast as manually doing it but to save the process of clicking a lot.
---
  *  Sure good idea, generally things like this are received well.
---
34. Could the 'Clear Redwood' patch be moved down the options like or removed from the tree since it requires paying Alexandra anyway.
---
  *  Depends on the other options, am sure we can manage it. Maybe.
---
35. Would it be possible to Content lock some bosses like Zulrah and Corp?
---
  *  Support team occasionally asks us to do such things, we're happy to do so if it's going to help. Strawpoll 'Should we add a requirement to Zulrah to limit accessibility?' 88% YES.
---
36. Can Prifddinas rune shop prices be changed? They increase faster than other shops with no requirements.
---
  *  Not too certain, if it's the same as Betty and Aubury's shop that have zero requirements we aren't against it.
---
37. Any update regarding PVP Bounty Hunter Update?
---
  *  Got the first draft blog out! Looking at rewards for it, Mod Gambit has been collecting ideas and I (Ash) expect an updated blog next week before we start programming anything to it!
---
38. Is there any opportunity to rebalance other weapons other than Scimitars (Spears etc?)
---
  *  Bruno: They're currently probably about as balanced as they will be. Hard to balance them further really?
---
39. Can you make it so that half-cakes and half-pies can be combined to make a full one?
---
  *  Maybe (probably not, no real answer).
---
The space saved isn't usable though, which was my point -- you can still only convert 26 at a time so that alone is not a sufficient argument since you only need 2 spaces for teleporting + money even now (rune pouch with dust + law runes, cash stack... alternatively house tabs + cash stack and using a Camelot portal to get to the bank).
---
I do agree (as I said above) that the extra dialogue being skipped would be a really nice QOL. I also think it's strange that the bag doesn't let you do this. It's weird design to be honest.
---
I thought it was hilarious my dude
---
"Lmao look at this losers in shit gear"
---
-Guy that spends hours and hours doing the same thing
---
Cannon ball alts are so strange to me
---
You have to run them for so long in order to even keep the bond paid for
---
Tell that to the US healthcare system lol
---
TBH, I don't really care either way. I don't mind the imbues being from NMZ; I just think the AFK Exp Rumbles should be bad for points, perhaps not even enough to cover potions. But while I think it is fine for imbues to be from a quest-based combat minigame, even if a lackluster one, I'd also be fine if they were tradeable at this point. I'd expect the tradeable versions to cost a decent amount so it would still be better to got through NMZ, but it would give a quicker option for those who don't care about cost as much (or value time efficiency).
---
At 83 you can Crystal saw + spicy stew for ornate jewellery box. You can do pool at 82 (but you're still waiting on the +5 from the stew so it's kind of a pain).
---
It's about consistency. Whether you can check back exactly every 5 mins, or does it range sometimes as 4-6, or longer. Overloads are a strict 5 minute timer to adhere to. Super combats are not.
---
I said you look shitty. Goodnight Denise.
---
Steal things? Killing someone for their loot is not stealing. If you go into a pvp area, be prepared to be killed and lose everything on your person, you know the risks, don't act like you don't.
---
That’s like saying they could be having McDonald’s when they are eating lobster...
---
Bgs is something useful for pvm too right?
---
Im thinking of doing a cooking/crafting alt tbh
---
Keeping hp at 1 with overloads, dharoks. Some people do all bosses, personally I turn off things like dag mother/barrelcrest/RFD etc. 
---
DT bosses and dream mentor are the two required for high points, you can find good lists on the wiki.
---
Then you don't kill damis (the DR with two phases) and wait for the kill all powerup to deal with him. Can bring ice gloves if you want for the fire one. Read the wiki for optimal points, it's really good.
---
T
---
Especially if they add the cat ears from that other post.
---
Zulrah is super fun, basically how I made most of my money, I’ve done 4300kc now lol. Still poor though, I’m in the in between where I have arma bandos and ancestral, but that’s only like 400m, so far from a tbow 😓
---
Already have to pay $11 not paying $15 too!!
---
You're clearly lacking some basic human skills like logic and empathy
---
Maybe fix so that Zezima himself can at least log in to the game first?
---
Uncut diamond from hydra. 1/41k
---
You can heal over with an angler in the wildy tho.
---
What did ya use to make this if ya don’t mind me asking
---
I've never played wow before either,but decided to pick up wow classic on release. It's definitely not like OSRS, it's closer to rs3, but way better. There are "skills" such as mining and herbalism, but they're not really a focus. The quests are pretty straightforward, you go to an npc and he says "please kill X for me and get this reward". They're fun though. However one thing that is much different is the social aspect. When you do a quest or kill a boss, you can share that quest with others so that you can kill the boss quicker. Like almost all quests are done with a few players and not alone. If you'd like to know more about wow from a new player, I'm happy to help.
---
thanks, big upvote.  watching right now!
---
no. kill, wakeup/kill respiratory system and poh for spec is meta
---
Maybe something like 1 charge = 500 gold with a maximum of 500 charges
---
Vielen Dank,  Kanye
---
on an iron money is very easy to come by, considering you have very minimal uses for gold coins anyhow.
---
of course it's easier to level in p2p, that's the whole point. you're missing 3/4 of the content, all of which is aimed at higher levels.
---
and furthermore, you can't even make nature runes until level 44, and EHP-wise it's much better to do lava runes and just make money during pvm/slayer or literally anything else
---
Well, I’m 1 part away but I’ll never need it unless going for completionist
---
And the karils bow, that's some luck
---
There's a clear cut between OSRS grindy and WoW grindy.
---
One you have to keep yourself up to date constantly so you're not falling behind and miss out on content.
---
The other you can leave for a few months and pick back up again without having to do outdated content until you're caught up.
---
Hafu (a TFT/Hearthstone player) recently said on stream that WoW is a lifestyle and it's pretty accurate tbh. You need to be able to reserve some time to do raids, heroics, weeklies etc. to stay relevant and be able to do the end game content available at the time.
---
With OSRS you'll maybe miss out on a few good money makers but you'll never get to a point where you're falling behind in updates and have to catch up.
---
Both me and my friends can play OSRS for a few weeks/months and then drop it for a while and repeat and we'd still be able to join in on raids or do relevant money makers. If we were to do that with WoW we'd probably get kicked out of the guild and be replaced fairly quickly since we've fallen behind.
---
Because you’re not healthy
---
Good solution. Better to not implement buggy content though.
---
However if you heal up to full and then die, your death will just be a PVM death I believe
---
Did i do something against the rules here? Someone was asking to have their money doublet, and I jokingly said I'd half it. He agreed and gave me 100k in one trade and I gave him back 50k in another. He then asked if I would actually double his money, and I said i'd give him his 50k back, which he agreed to. This all seemed in god fun, but now I'm worried I might have fallen for some kind of report bait, where I seem like a scammer.
---
except it's actually not but whatever
---
Isn't this the same exact thing that jagex is doing. But putting it in the BH point shop? Or did they nix that idea
---
Nice. Nice. Nice. ........
---
I think they want to do something that can be protected. my charge idea per special attack and the maul degrading to dust after its attachment have worn out are new ideas (at least I haven’t seen anything like it proposed)
---
Every stackable item is just a hammerspace portal, when you use one, the next one falls out. That's why the weight never increases even though 10,000 arrows would weigh about the same as 1.5 full 55gal oil drums.
---
LMS let people keep their boosted stats and complete diaries etc
---
Because your internet is trash m8
---
Sit kid
---
I remember when people would find him they would message all their friends and people would be typing in chat everywhere “zezima at falador bank world 2” or wherever he was  and then when if you found him he would have some huge ass line of people following him everywhere he went.Although I bet doing things was a pain in the ass with a 100 people clogging up your dial up back then. Ah the good ol days
---
lol. thing is, now that I've had a taste of training RC today (did like 5 nature runs) I'll be fletching more for the free RC xp lollllllkillmelllllll
---
wholesome
---
Yes. He did an interview in the runescape documentary jagex produced. Its on youtube and its a great watch.
---
Yeah he’s zezima
---
It should be able to be dropped on ftp
---
Why haven't you done ds2 yet? Vorkath is realtively good money and will make your 40m bank 100mbin a few weeks with relatively little effort.
---
Imagine what you’d be making if you did less of that and more combat! I’m only 10 cb levels higher and can make that in two hours with ease.
---
Thanks mate, I thought that got scrapped!
---
The new nezzy won't be a reward from the new quest. The reward from the new quest will be the ability to access the monster that drops an item that will upgrade the nezzy into the super nezzy.
---
Also you'd need the quest to wear the super nezzy.
---
Or peaches from b2p
---
His real identity was never revealed.
---
so why are you searching every one? probably you have missed a small step, go back and read slooooooowly and make sure you didn't miss a tiny detail that might stop the dove from being visible
---
Alright thanks for letting me know I'll try to stay safe then :p
---
What function are you referring to? I use osbuddy as well but am not aware of something like that.
---
Add me GmaulTaPlote
---
There's quite a few of us here
---
Just hit 70 defence, is any barrows gear worth it if I'm currently using fighter torso, obby legs and black mask for slayer? Seems to me it would be more tanky but I'd lose the strength bonus. 
---
I was thinking of Guthan's for the set effect but I only have around a 6m cash stack so it would mostly wipe me out. Is it worth it?
---
Just got an internet upgrade and now its worse? I just wish i had fiber
---
It’s just impractical not to use the abyss before 77. Pretty painless imo laps are less than a minute if you’re quick
---
skilling reqs + qp reqs
---
take (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.
---
Yeah it technically is, I never gave pkers permission to take my shit.
---
why would this even work? They shouldn't even boost your agility in LMS because you no longer drain run energy.
---
Got Klanks gauntlets equipped, and quest guide has you building the effigy? I think you won't find a it otherwise
---
I mean with level 40 the requirement to wear it, i don’t think it should be anywhere near the best.
---
1. getting banned for trade based scams isn't really a thing, he literally just handed you money that's not your fault
---
2. in no universe are you required to double anyone's money
---
you're fine mate, don't sweat.
---
Have an anti-pk spade drop from casket that has a spec that summons uri to talk to the pker allowing your escape.
---
U make bank doing runecrafting at high levels dont you? Seems better then some skills. What is the point of a 99 if you wont even do the skill after u have it at 99. I feel like 99 agility is probably the most useful
---
H
---
I have heard so much shit about doxing, hacking, scamming, ddosing and every other way someone could fuck up someone else on the internet from people in big clans and dead man mode and stuff, wouldn't think it would be that bad in lms but I guess it carries over.
---
Who knew scimitars are used to cut pizza
---
Did you talk to Oziach?
---
Or scalps
---
Awesome thank you
---
Making buying GF a real skill, I’m super with it
---
Please God let this pass. This would be great to see. Funny thing is when I was in Vegas I saw SGDQ live on one of the monitors they use for watching and betting on sports, wouldn't be shocked if they weren't betting because it was a banjo kazooie race.
---
It absolutely will. People didn't know what the hell they were doing back in 2004-2005. After a couple of months, people will be able to use the experiences of current Classic compared with what they learned the first time to hard-optimize.
---
Quests are a great way to start out. Good rewards, xp, and gets you to explore.
---
No you doodle, me spongebob
---
tbh it doesn't even matter because the sort of person to join a clan like this is probably shit, it would only matter if an actual pk clan decided to do this for some reason in which case hiding the dots wouldn't matter because they would be on discord anyway.
---
Fuuuuuuuck
---
I'm a little out of touch in the community, what was the drama in April?
---
Still don't get people who hate RC forcing themselves to do the least enjoyable and most intense method.
---
Just go afk zmi like every other person.
---
Because of the absolutely stupid idea of "Hey we know you guys have been asking for a lot of this stuff, like extra POH wallkits, but you'll only get them if we get someone to sponsor them!".
---
Honestly lavas have been pretty chill, been rewatching the boys and the clicks sort of become muscle memory
---
Gotta say Candlejack first dude, otherwise the meme doesn't
---
literally no one in the wildy anyway lol, who cares?
---
Yeah I mean a skiller just sounds depressing in general. Thought of doing a pure or an ironman?
---
Just came back to osrs today to find my account compromised and used as a zulrah not :/ free pet tho so not all bad
---
That’s absolutely hilarious
---
How do you get it so that it says "press enter to chat"
