You talk about being unable to afford things yet you live in Minnesota hahahahaha.

Nah, some people actually play the game and enjoy the grind. Buying gp and skipping the grind (a major part of the game) is retarded. Just play a different game if you either don’t like the grind or don’t have time for it. It’s the reality.

He may have got lucky but to say that infernal capes shouldn’t be awarded to people who get lucky is beyond stupid. This game is built on RNG and luck.

---
By his logic no drops would be earned because there’s always an element of luck.

You can't 100% osrs anyway. You will never complete the collection log with third age on the clues. The fact that people are whining this hard over a useless cosmetic is ridiculous.

They said on stream that's what they did. This came up when they were discussing the GMaul spec and how the LMS gmaul was just a copy of the real one.
---
&gt;how do you expect an ironman to get gear when somebody just turns up and steals their kill.
---
Because not every single kill is going to get stolen
---
also off-peak times exist, loads of bosses are instanced (which is bad design), and not playing iron man exists
---
you chose to play a 'challenge mode' and then complain when theres challenge
---
The helm really makes that much of a difference?
---
There’s a couple good online tutorials for breathing exercises.
---
Nice.
---
It's an MMO. Nobody is entitled to any spot whether it is killing a boss or cutting a tree. Sure you can view it as rude when someone comes to contest a spot at something but that is how the game is designed.
---
You must be an Ironman because everyone else just buys air orbs(better xp than fire orbs) and buys battle staves from ge or stock piles them from zaff.
---
So I'm having fun with the The task, but for a lvl 60 slayer monster they do take a while to kill. I think I'm averaging around 2 mins a kill. I think an average geared player of my stats should be able to kill a lvl 60 tank slayer monster in a min to a king and a half, so I do see why some people think they're too tough.
---
The problem seems to stem from the relatively low reqs compared to the BIS drop they have. Which is unfortunate. It seems either they stay tanky and rake a while, or the BIS melee head slot becomes obtainable for not a lot of gold. Rock and a hard place and all that.
---
I have no proposed solutions, just offering my perspective from 80 kills on task. So pretty much not too much weght to my opinion.
---
Pick a gathering skill to try out like woodcutting or mining. Learn everything you can about Varrock it will be your main City for a while.
---
Sorry I shouldn't have said that.

In my mind it had happened twice in OSRS for some reason.

Yeah. Kinda the theme of this..🤯
---
i am of course interpreting it in a more loose way, but the melody is there. it's probably the rhythmic displacements that make it harder to hear (do you listen to much jazz or stuff where well known tunes are often altered?). just gotta listen to that right hand. the melody is there but just rhythmically displaced and altered a bit. i guess i am just used to hearing tunes get really messed with.

Money isn't something inherent to you though.  It's not internal capabilities or personality or whatever you can derive genuine confidence from
---
Just chill with the wealth signalling and let your persona soften a little.  Presently you sound like you're not secure so you wealth signal to cover up for it.  That's not a sleight against you, it's a common occurrence 
---
Let this persona soften up a little bit, try just being yourself without letting your wealth be known and you may find you're even more likable that way

&gt; Everybody knows that without special rewards Twisted League be dead, like Deadman Mode is when there is no tournament. So Jagex had to add some untradable discontinued item to make it even more worthwhile than just the tradable ones.
---
Twisted Leagues has been pretty active for the past month before we knew there would be discontinued rewards. Back when they pitched it, the reason to play was to earn the unique tradeable rewards. That said, unique trophies definitely does encourage more players to play it, but I'd question if it encourages in a healthy way if the main motivation it adds is "ugh, I'm forced to grind this because I want a trophy I can't get later".
---
Also, since you did bring up sponsorships, one thing I did notice is how for sponsorships players emphasized how cosmetics matter yet for trophies a lot of replies are "who cares? it is just a cosmetic." I mean the context is a bit different because with sponsorships the concern was buying fancy items rather than earning, even if that argument doesn't hold up too well with how many cosmetics are given freely or available for cheap. Though you could still make a bit of a comparison to cosmetics being locked behind a temporary gamemode and behind a paywall (e.g. "who cares if you have to buy that POH theme? You can get a nearly identical one without having to pay so it is fine!" as the MTX equivalent to being able to earn a similar but different trophy from future leagues).
---
Drop in f2p trick?
---
It's legit.. And which jmod? I don't use twitter
---
Thanks for letting me know man.
---
A lvl 3 run would be possible, it would just take 2273 perfect attempts on average.
---
Oh you’re approaching me?
---
He
---
Shit I knew I was missing something
---
by that definition, going down 1gp would be a crash.....
---
Yeah, but those had more than 10 max hp xD
---
no luck at all, its all computer generated...
---
Mods devaluing my holiday item merchs reeeee.
---
Yeah if you dont want to do those tasks you can judt turn them off for free lol
---
Would using Guthix rests instead of brews help with a lvl 4 cape? Since they heal 5 per sip vs 3?
---
I’d buy a slayer hoody for my cat no doubt
---
He's just saying that would make more sense than making crashing against the rules
---
I would buy the shit out of these
---
Doesn't make sense when running alted raids, the iron has to prep.
---
Great pasta
---
Assuming someone does solve those particular waves, a level 3 firecape would be technically possible. You just need to consistently perform thousands of perfect attempts until you hit a string of really good luck.
---
The trouble is you need to proc the poison on all 34 level 180s which has a 1/4 chance of poisoning on a successful hit 1.33 xp to att str def on shared, 83 xp to lvl 2, 83 / 1.33 = 62.25 so you have 62 melee hits available. 4xp on ranged hit,  83/4 = 20.75, so 20 ranged hits available 62 + 20 for 82 total poison opportunities. So you need 34 successful poisonings in 82 tries with a 1/4 probability of each individual poison. Hm, tries &amp; successes sounds Bernoulli. 
---
Plugging 82 trials, 34 successes, and a 0.25 probability of success into a Bernoulli Trial calculator i found online puts the chance any particular run being possible at p = 0.00044 or 0.044% chance. Now this guy on the maths stack overflow says it'll take on average 1/p tries for the first success on average, so that means a lvl 3 run is possible (assuming perfect play) once every 2272.72 tries. I shudder to think how much that would cost in purple sweets. Also neat, it rounds to 2273, the best possible total level.
---
&gt;level 12

Wtf you doing
---
Different tiers of membership,
---
•14 days can be purchased with a bond
---
•30 days for $11
---
•60 days for around $10/month
---
•90 days for around $9/month
---
Whenever the “days” purchased run out, the card is charged for whatever your purchase price was. So when 30 days run out, $11 is charged; whenever 60 days run out, the full 60 days is charged again (price differs by area)
---
TLDR yes $11 is autocharged unless cancelled, much cheaper to buy in bulk. Premier club (found on OSRS home Page) is cheapest bulk membership right now
---
I think its hilarious u kids talking shit about kemp. u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol.
---
Yes, that is correct. Most of those items will have a destroy option instead of a drop option, with a message on how to get it back. A few of them don't, but you can double-check the wiki to make sure that they're reclaimable.
---
Yeah? When’s the level 1 cape?
---
Have a player kill you
---
... You always have to tick eat with purple sweets while doing the suffering recoil method? That's how recoiling works. The only difference would be some kind of complex lure or maybe a damage stall of some kind to keep the ranger and mager hitting you at the same time on the 4 waves xzact couldn't figure out.
---
Is 420 set as your default world?
---
Pussy elitists. I bet they died more times trying to flick the blobs and other monsters then rage on themselves for dying to fail flicks LUL
---
He explained how he dealt with the rangers but I'm still not sure why he didn't need melee protect for the meleers when rendi said he did? What did xzact do differently there?
---
If Justiciar didn't exist, I wonder what would be complained about instead. I mean either way there would eventually be some new items that make the Inferno easier or at least change how it can be done in some way. The same happened with Fight Caves, but it is kinda silly to think less of someone who got a Fire Cape with a Blowpipe than someone who got it with a Crystal Bow.
---
No, it always had a different item thing and if you tried to wield it it says please report how you obtained this item. I don’t remember who got it to figure that out, the same group that got the potatoe in stealing creation I think haha
---
Slapping all the little Tim Allen biker boys back to Lumbridge.
---
Yeah. So you’re a fucking idiot.
---
Needs more red arrows sir
---
I’m just waiting for the lvl 4 Lava Cape.... these people are legends. 
---
I can’t even get a firecape at borderline combat level 90....
---
I believe it is scaled based on the highest combat person in the raid.
---
Stop it. Get some help.
---
I remember feeling this way til I got my first fire cape and saw the ugly brown piece that goes around the players neck and now I can never unsee it
---
They are not tradable.
---
Kemp q? More like Kemq p
---
Why should he?  
---
  
---
- Releases 19 cb fire cape vid, gets made fun of  
---
- Leaves it alone, gets made fun of  
---
- Takes down old videos to do with 19 cmb fire cape goal, gets made fun of   
---
I don't really care one way or another, but it seems like people will keep making fun of him until either he miraculously is able to compete with the top 2 records for fight caves, or records stop being broken and the scene dwindles. I didn't appreciate that his videos on the 19 cmb cape idea were drawn out and just talk without trying it, but he did contribute a bit to the theorycrafting and honestly anyone who can get a cape lower than like 40 combat is leagues better than me. So I shouldn't judge.
---
There's plenty he can still do on the acc just no combat. Plus you would get people going crazy just by bank standing at ge. Why would he just never play again
---
Ever since they reduced damage through prayer it has been fine. I wish the normal rewards were better though.
---
Can someone explain what was going on at 1:27 in the inferno, why was he taking no melee damage?
---
Both, I prefer cbow over bp and I use a rune one lol
---
Level 2 Cape???
---
That’s good to hear. I’m at the puzzle now, after this quest I have to do fremmy exiles which looked easy. Then I get the cape back as well. Just stressin’ cause getting hit 90% or more on HP sends my heart through my ass
---
He’s attacking the anonymous man who attacked another twitter user for beating inferno?
---
Only need tzhaar unlocked. Killing had previously isn't a requirement.
---
You need a Zuk (inferno) kill before you can swap the task to that
---
GIVE ME YOUR SPADE
---
I don’t disagree that it’s shit and could potentially be deserving of a buff. But there’s absolutely no reason to give it any type of defense reducing special attack. I’d say wait and see how the armour effects metas (if at all, rerun DPS calcs, etc) before giving it a buff. I wouldn’t be entirely against it having some accuracy modifier on Tekton but that seems slightly odd but definitely not a defense reduction.

It wasn't accidentaly placed down.
---
They were playtesting the new areas and new mobs and needed a weapon to do it. So, they made a twisted bow spawn, however they messed up the coordinates and put it by farming guild instead of near CoX or whatever. Then when the bow didn't show up, they created it again in the right spot.  
---
When release time came they removed all the items from the intended area where they were playtesting but did not know the twisted bow near farming guild was there, so it was left in.
---
The best way to prevent this from happening is having a staging area and then they just direct a portal in there to where they need to go. Sort of like the "We need guns, lots of guns" thing in The Matrix.
---
I knew someone would point this out hahahahah, I was making this during last 5 minutes of work and couldn’t find the best images :(
---
Dmed, d sq, legends cape for me. BiS in RSC
---
its fine how it is
---
Oh so the backward logic that’s, “that guy attacked that guy so I’m going to attack him but I’m not doing it in a bad way”? I’m not defending the twitter user in the slightest but jumping in and attacking him when it doesn’t exactly concern or effect him isn’t really any different or good for the community in general.
---
It's an mmo you massive pussy lmfao if you don't want competition play a single player game
---
I've been doing a lot of Wintertodt lately due to Twisted League, and I began thinking about the possibility of future Skill-based bosses and wanted to pitch a concept to the OSRS Subreddit and Jagex (if they see this)
---
Wintertodt is a boss centered around the basic Woodcutting/Firemaking Gameplay loop. 
---
While Herblore and Fletching are also utilized, cutting the wood and then burning it is still the base gameplay element of Wintertodt. 
---
It got me thinking about how a Runecrafting boss could work. Since Runecrafting is often lamented as one of the most annoying skills to train, a boss like Wintertodt could be a great way to train it. Since the core gameplay loop of Runecrafting is running from one place to the next, I thought it also made sense to include Agility in the mix as well. (And potentially Mining).
---
So, this is my concept: The Abyssal Legion.
---
The Mages of Zamorak are up to no good and this time they've opened a massive dimensional rift to the Abyss, and it's up to you (and many others) to stop them!
---
As long as the rift remains opens, the Abyssal Legion will crawl out of it and attack you. 
---
Your only chance is to craft special Runes to close the Rift! (Until it opens again after a minute)
---
The core gameplay involves running through corridors carrying special Rune Essence exclusive to the boss (Which could either be mined during the boss or obtained from a crate)
---
Then the Runes are crafted, and the boss weakened. As you run back and forth crafting the runes, you'll encounter several agility obstacles including rocks and boulders falling on you, and of course the Abyssal monsters will attack you. 
---
As the rift weakens, stronger abyssal monsters will begin to appear.
---
The reward system would work the same as Wintertodt. Get enough points to get a Supply Crate.
---
Let me know what you guys think.
---
eh, at combat level 8 fire cape really is low priority...
---
This one legit sound like engine work, and adding this kind of preset system to the code could completely change banking.
---
Preset rune pouch is only step 1, after that, people will want preset equipment set and preset inventory for resupply.
---
Geez you shouldn’t take things for granite
---
I saw a similar post to this the other day and my guess is oak cutting bots. I've seen them too, I believe they are slightly broken as sometimes a few of them run to the edge of the GE and just stand there before running back to spout out numbers. I've even seen a few say "axe" in the chat, and every now and then some will leave to cut oaks. Cant be sure what the numbers are, but like I said, they seem to be kind of broken.
---
what's cml?
---
What if the new ElderDWHmaul was a combination of the DWH and elder maul and constructed at tekton's anvil? 
---
A unique reverting mechanic could give the player a 50% chance at recovering the maul or the DWH, resulting in the other being deleted from the game.
---
Still a no from you?
---
You heard him
---
C
---
Yeah man, it got to the point where you were better of not picking up more and selling ASAP, certain stuff like crackers and party hat sets were staying strong.
---
Didn't mean to sound negative, was good to see JMods changing into bosses just to entertain the crowds.

&gt;it is kinda silly to think less of someone who got a Fire Cape with a Blowpipe than someone who got it with a Crystal Bow.
---
Not that I'm justifying being a douche about it, but this makes no sense to me.  BP is simply stronger for fight caves than crystal bow, which directly means that it makes fight caves easier if you do it with a BP.  Therefore completing fight caves with a BP is objectively a lesser achievement than completing it with crystal bow.  If you "think less" of someone as in look down on them because of that, yeah you're a dick, but if you "think less" of their achievement because it is literally a lesser achievement, I'm not seeing how that can really be argued with.

If you haven't done the MTA grind yet, that'd probably be a good place to start. You're gonna have to do it eventually for B2P, infinity boots, master wand, etc., and the xp you get from there is a lot more useful at lower levels than it is at 90+.

I chose abyssal monsters because The Abyss and the Mage of Zamorak are already important to Runecrafting to begin with.

It’s a cool item, but the most iconic RuneScape item?

Downvote cause not even (p++)

Why all these dudes hating on your tongue wtf i bet they are insecure about their own tongues your apron is sick dude wish i had one like it!!

How insecure about your own accomplishments do you have to be to accuse other people of being lucky for managing to do something you struggled with in what you perceive as wrong gear?
---
No way dark bow should be on a list of most iconic items.

You have to update it because they’re trying to stop people from botting so they moved it up according to a specific iOS. Sad story but True

RWTers don't deserve shit.
---
Thank fucking god they picked God Ash and not some scrubs like Superman or the Avengers.  I can actually sleep again.
---
depends on if you finished Tai Bwo Wannai Trio or not
---
The fuck is up with so many RSers having fancy ass cars man, and when can I join the club?
---
Those accounts also do damage and don't need 20k purple sweets.
---
Fletching arrow shafts and combining then with feathers. If u buy the shafts and feathers it's a profit of 5 gold per headless arrow. But if you fletch from logs u make more
---
I'm currently farming Chaos Druids, they drop Grimy Ranarr Weed's that go between 7-15k each and it's right by the GE. There could be better ways but I found it's decent and I get to level up my attack/def/stamina
---
But sometimes I want to do a Jad task
---
Check out DVS’s twisted league series. He does a couple clues just because they’re helpful. But his series is based on maxing. He’s only like 10 levels away from max lol
---
True tho he just got good rng no skill
---
‘I’m not salty at all, here’s my multiple paragraph explanation on how not salty I am’
---
Yup.  Jagex (and the abusers) claimed it was an "integrity" update and therefore did not need to be polled, but it's pretty obvious to anybody with more than half a brain that utilizing **multiple** runners will **obviously** surpass the polled XP rate by an absurd amount, since you are not traveling and are effectively cutting the crafting time down to 0.
---
He’s just watering his virtual bushes.
---
Fuckin lost it at he
---
🤫
---
Runelite has a feature that hides the talk to option on other people's random events. Could this be what happens?
---
You’re right. Wintertodt comes to mind.
---
As someone who never ever did PvM, watching MethodJosh have a bet with his chat ($6k which he ended up losing) trying to beat Jad blind with a bone crossbow and strawberries in under a week made me want to try it, and the feeling of beating a boss you never thought about beating opens the door to so much more.
---
Try it, definitely worth the satisfaction if you get it.
---
Best you can
---
Should I be doing birdhouse runs? Should it be apart of my daily herb, battlestaves etc run routine
---
If this happened in WoW blizzard would make it right. I lost a santa hat from being hacked when I was 12 and they wouldn't do anything. It really hurt for a 12 year old. I spent months to buy it.
---
I know I know...
---
Studied for 6 finals
---
Then downvote it shithead
---
I've got my very first tbow after 1944 raids yesterday. Keep grinding!
---
1. Buy a bond
---
2. ???
---
3. Profit
---
Yes but, birdhouses are ready to swap every hour. So do birdhouses then between things do birdhouse. Slayer task birdhouse, slayer task for example.
---
Okay
---
So Pokémon character are hot and wear crop tops now? This is a strange timeline
---
Ranged training options
---
1) get some dummy cheap arrows and shoot at something with low defense (like sand crabs)
---
2) do slayer using mainly ranged
---
3) do the above but also with a cannon (can get expensive, but slayer drops pay for cannonballs)
---
4) chinning, but this is really expensive and if you dont know what it is then its not time yet
---
i’m snad
---
What's a bond? 
---
And what skill is profitable, I've made 1 mill from limpwurt roots
---
Where's the auction house?
---
Yeah, brand new
---
You have much to learn young grasshopper. 
---
Unfortunently ive taken someone under my wing already.
---
Combat 3 isnt going to be a “close” thing
---
He either has a method or doesnt
---
The 180s force you to hit them or else they will just keep healing, so until someone figures that out they wont get a level 3 cape
---
Look up on YouTube a zamork wine guide it’s like 200k an hour and pretty easy
---
YouTube making a bond f2p
---
A bond is an item that makes you a member for 14 days. In f2p because of bots pretty much nothing is worth your time. Your best bet for moneymaking is prolly telegrabbing wines of zamorak, so that'd be magic. If you teleport to falador, then go north as far as you can, you'll see a temple. Each wine sells for ~3k
---
He has infernal on main and alt. Justiciar is bad for inferno because it makes people rely on luck instead of actually learning how to properly deal with it. Example:  [https://clips.twitch.tv/TriumphantNastySashimiFreakinStinkin](https://clips.twitch.tv/TriumphantNastySashimiFreakinStinkin)
---
Level range to 40 and kill ogress warrior at Corsair cove cave best f2p money imo
---
Varrock
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
or a trident
---
Honestly here’s the deal I don’t care about individuals botting, they’re small fish barely make a difference. I wouldn’t even care if there was a non ranked set your stats sandbox mode for people who want to just experience things.
---
But big bot farms are a real issue, they put way too much gold and items in the game.
---
So cool, dude! What are your plans for birdhouses and loot in the future?
---
Send screen shots to Yagex customer support
---
You're thinking of Zuk, he can overkill the player.
---
Can understand where hes coming from though, when you have absolutely brain dead content like agility or runecrafting that nobody wants to do, yet it is highly beneficial, people are more leaned towards botting it.
---
All you have to do is make PVP weapons and any armor above rune tier untradeable. Make them a cash drop on death to eliminate drop trading or intentional death. Remove all multi-combat areas outside of the wilderness to prevent clans from camping down areas like godwars. Oh and increase the PJ timer to 15-20 seconds. Now you have a game mode where all you can trade is supplies so everyone has to get their own weapons and gear. No real advantage to being in a clan and streamers and main clan member brids cannot be fed. You are welcome Jagex.
---
49% is waaaaay too high as a permanent buff, plus it can stack, and doesn't require any specific equipment.
---
I’m hammered and going through old pk vids brought something back to me
---
Xzact is a mechanical beast and does lures that avoid melee hits.
---
range doesn't need any equipment to save ammo. the ava accumulator doesn't technically "save ammo", it just picks up it. 
---
That being said, the % could be adjusted if needed. I prefer if it didn't come from specific equipment and be applied to the skill in general.

It’s automatically applied to your account, the next time you go staking you’ll have a tax shield equal to the G.E. value of the donation
---
Darker Manz was the first one i seen so gotta pick him but both had classic videos
---
It's not so much that ranged is the best combat skill for early game, but rather that it is so slow to level up with conventional means (i.e attacking monsters) that questing is by far the best way to start off your ranged training.
---
I disagree
---
👽
---
He's a fackin og end of discussion brah
---
It's not specific to leagues. It's an item in main game.
---
&gt;Certain items are restricted to certain game modes. My main can't become an Ironman all of a sudden. 
---
No but you can always make an Ironman.
---
You can't always just go and play a discontinued game mode.
---
&gt;Keep crying because you can't get rewards for shit you didn't do lmfao
---
I played twisted league to get all the rewards, it's shit. Just not looking forward to the precedent this sets, I won't be playing future leagues.
---
oh its a video just noticed
---
Do you even fully understand the mechanics? The "mechanics" are knowing where to stand to trap/separate the monsters. Prayer flick/switching isn't required if you use the pillar method.
---
That's about it for the waves.
---
I ever said they would be tradeable.
---
sucking his balls on reddit an he doesnt even know u exist, pathetic
---
Just an update to all, my account was banned by error and Jagex has given it back to me a few hours ago.
---
They're all ironmen
---
That actually sounds like an interesting game mode. Ultimate glass man.
---
attack hoodie looks so clean
---
instead of banning tank gear i'd like to see T-bow and Blowpipe get banned. That would make the inferno a real challenge.
---
Nice however I would recommend adding more indicators such as large red arrows to clarify what we are supposed to be looking at
---
I didnt play osrs much because of commitments. My pre eoc acc was baller

Get membership

I hope this person doesn't reproduce cause that writing is actually cancerous

&gt;They are not tradable.

This is completely irrelevant to my comment.

love turnover

When did you last log in before the account was "reset"? If it was before 2013 then you need to log onto rs3 to see your previous progress
---
Are you sure you're not logging into a twisted league world?
---
Brutal black isn’t a metal dragon...
---
No, don't change it, it's cool the way it is now.

yes, it should be removed from their drop table like how it was with the DFH.

---
Imagine trying to seem this smart and above it all, and still reeeeee-ing internally so hard you end with a typo.
---
D
---
Aren’t we, actually, getting further from endgame?
---
Lavas are 7-9m/h lmao
---
Astrals a solid 5m
---
Best avas, trident, elite voids, get rid of arma and get ancestral.
---
depends on the amount of runners you're using. some people only use 3-4, others use more.
---
7-9m/hr would be the max I assume. but yeah, it's only made the "problem" (which I don't even think is a problem) even worse.
---
I’m certain you don’t have the authority or knowledge to say for certain that you’re right and I’m wrong, which you’re attempting to do. So, let’s take a step back and say we don’t know for certain how it affects run consistency. I’m offering information from what I think is the best written guide available on the Inferno, which specifically does not recommend the justiciar method for that reason. I’d like for you to, in turn, offer something other than your own opinion to support your argument. Really anything will suffice.

I feel like the more I compete for Wines of Zamorak, the more humanity I lose. What do?
---
If someone gets an 8 combat infernal cape I'm just going to stop trying.
---
Permanent item combinations will make their prices cheaper: spending vs asset buying, items also act as store of value, if it is an avernic, less people are going to buy it over using capital on something else. The dwh+elder mix concept art was based around encouraging HOLDING, not sink. If you find a tool useful u won't be selling it.
---
Do you always talk out your ass to act like you know what you’re talking about?
---
You physically cannot use more than 3-4 runners at Astrals or Lavas. You will lose xp/h due to runners waiting at the altar for trades.
---
It’s 7-9m/h per runner at lavas and 5m/h at astrals always. It doesn’t matter about how many runners you use to dictate pay lmao

You can't throw that in when we're using actual metrics.

The best part is that with the recoil charging the suffering bug, he doesnt even need 75 hp to do what he wanted to do
---
10K a sweet, you say?
---
Train magic to 55, ranged to 40, kill ogress warriors. High alch the rune full helms and battle axes, and collect law, nature, chaos, and death runes. You never even need to bank or go to the auction house.
---
Did you have a pin? Were you keylogged? Other than the Jed situation, contrary to popular belief one does not simply just get hacked randomly. 
---
Good luck and i hope you get it back if legit. If you bought the acc tho then someone prob just recovered. Or if you werent the original owner.
---
*slovic voice* is good compromise
---
Man, back in the day I spent weeks here merching just to make 50k a day
---
Yeah I'll check pc when I get home, it's very strange haha. I've left a couple of items in invent just to see if someone has got onto account or if it's a bug.
---
Well unless a j mod does it..like the whole Jed fiasco. But 99% the time yeah you right.
---
&gt;I cannot think of reasons why they please let me know if there are
---
Because of this:
---
&gt;this would be restricted this to trees you’ve grown yourself
---
A log is a log, the game has no way of knowing what tree you received a specific log from.
---
No it was my account that I created when they brought back oldschool, good news I just got the email and was able to get the account back, but my bank was wiped clean
---
Haha that should have been the title
---
Get rekt *boundaries* hahaha

holy shit congratz

coz u dont actually recieve farm xp per log do u?

Mobile membership trial was abused by bots for free membership. That was removed, so bots need to buy bonds for membership now. Higher demand -&gt; higher price

I believe you'll get it back baby don't worry

I’d wear prayer, rc, hunter, and quest.

This is already exists lol

You can bring a fat amount of gear risk-free into kbd if you do the looting bag suicide method
---
I’m UIM. I want it for quicker construction.
---
I just did:)) however my bank was wiped clean but I got it back so I'll just have to start rebuilding
---
Jagex should RWT it and use the $ to update the game.
---
Get a bank pin my dude. Its the safest/best form of security an acc can have when it comes to preventing item loss. Scan your PC, you probably got phished from clicking bad links/downloads. Lesson here is to 1) set a bank pin 2) set bank pin and 3) dont click on "free giveaway" links.
---
lOwER tHe BeTtEr

I like the Idea of this change van someone explain why everyone is saying no?

Not saying you will, but as you're the original owner you can easily take that account back further down the line when he has built up decent stats/bank

Nice job making the video private not link locked...
---
&gt; shitting on Reddit being casual players 
---
is not the same as shitting on reddit for creating an echo chamber, which it very clearly does.  unpopular opinions get buried, and unpopular peoples' opinions get buried regardless of their opinions because of who they are.  
---
i will hardly ever agree with the opinions held by most casual players, which very often include trying to make the game easier.  this is not a crime to disagree; there's a reason jmods try to collect as many opinions from as many different sites as possible when it comes to balancing, changing or updating the game.  
---
so yeah, saying reddit is largely a place for the casual player's opinion is not shitting on it or the 07scape community at all.  a casual point of view is crucial to keeping the game playable at beginner and intermediate levels to an extent.
---
i will however take the piss out of reddit for being the breeding ground of "either your opinion is the same as ours, or we'll bury you in downvotes so no one can agree with you."
---
N-NANI!?
---
I beat jad on my second attempt, the first time I didn’t make it to jad bc of miscalculation on my potion set up, second attempt I merked him first try, I felt entitled bc I had done so much gwd tanking an solos. I beat him. To be fair he hit me with 6 mage attacks before he finally through in a range switch an then went back to mage and by that time he was done.

Thank you all for your responses, they have been very helpful and insightful. I have concluded that I will keep doing the GG because pet amiright? 
---
On a more serious note, they are better xp per hour for me and although slightly less profitable than regular gargoyles, I believe it is a fair trade for 30% extra slayer xp per hour. 
---
And pet chance ofc.
---
Why are you doing this?

Lmao “nah it wasn’t bonds it’s from my main”

One word eight letters and I'm yours. That was beautiful. Thank you for sharing your talent!

Never polled and devalues my random only hunter training Morytania locked UIM

This is amazing bro! Thanks for sharing!
---
They were changed along with museum, charlie the tramp, and the addition of the stray dog, as a precursor to the HD update.
---
Much as I'd like to see it reverted, doing so was polled and failed.
---
jus put it under the donations section whatever
---
my dude i haven't even bothered to get a fire cape just to spite people that are try hards. i'm combat level 120. it's gonna end up being my unofficial max cape once i max.
---
Instruction not clear, started fletching at Jad.
---
And the majority of this sub behind them who can’t get a sub 70 cape
---
Get bp and stay cool bro, you can do it!
---
I love that idea
---
Just carry coin on you, it's simple as that.  At the GE you can literally bank and go back to the GE all without moving a coin pouch isn't needed.
---
Funnily enough, anchovy pizzas are my go to method for a quick buck
---
Hahaa yes and BIS melee rings. Lmao like who uses melee on rex to get those things, so funny
---
This is a trash idea. Go back to the rs3 and have your ugly fun there.
---
Why didn’t you post this sooner? Would’ve been a great present to my gf lol
---
Fun fact: back in the day you couldn't choose bosses yourself so you would have to go with a person that had a select few good bosses done

Hey

Here's an award,

Asked a low level how he got bandos, he said from clues... hiscore says he never touched a clue.

never had this problem before on any course. on mobile or pc. and i even use the official client. just memorize it. its really not that difficult
---
"got it from a drop party"

Why are you crying on reddit? It's the wilderness you will die.  Camping lava maze isn't just for people fishing eels.  It's a hotspot and different groups always swing by there.

Haha, Genius

If you like grinding. It’s the best!!
---
then where is your mobile only pizza cape?
---
teespring.com/stores/osrs-inspired for the store. 
---
I've vectorised all the skills with a slight redesign and added these to blank hoodies. Multiple colours available. 
---
As it's Christmas I'll pick one person from the comments to send a heavily discounted hoody.
---
For context, I've seen the initial interest by the community ignored, contacted jagex myself multiple times over the past 12 months to be passed on and constantly and ignored. Hoping they see this and we can work something out. In the mean time enjoy and have a happy Christmas.
---
Time spent learning to play the cello is xp waste. /s
---
Never kill Bandos again, most unique collection log.

If you don’t have a torture you’re gonna want that before tassets or prims

Compare them to the Christmas noobs on any new game

Holy shit.

1000% sure he logged into a twisted league or DMM world. I'm going to laugh my ass off when he realises.

Asks for help and starts insulting everyone. Nice going.

I had originally gone with the teespring standard pricings but if you use the promo code "OSRS" it will give you 10% off anything on the store.
---
I have a good job and play runescape as a hobby, I bought my 09 Kia Rio with straight cash. Work hard and someday you’ll be where I’m am, kid.
---
Farm Runs, God Wars, Barrages, Vorkath... yeah, there are common reasons to run mixed runes. But the skinny of it is that the 3-4 extra clicks you save to stock your rune pouch each time vs dev and QA time to have preloads is not a good payoff. A minor part of the game that really doesn't need to be updated.
---
Everyone’s saying to buy a membership but assuming you don’t want to, here’s what you can do. 
---
Don’t bury the bones you get from giants. Bank them instead. Once you’ve got a few thousand, take them to the chaos alter in the wilderness and sacrifice them there. If you download the runelite client, you can make it so that left clicking the bones will “use” them, not “bury” them. This gives a huge bonus to prayer XP.  Definitely do this to get level 43 at the minimum, so you can cast protection prayers. 
---
I have to assume you’ve got a rune scimitar, but if you don’t go buy one from the GE.  That will make your life a lot easier. And then you can farm ogres like other people have said, but definitely get your magic to 55 like others have said so you can cast high alchemy on their drops. 
---
From there, I’d say what you should ideally be doing is try to get all of your skills (except RC) to 50 or 60, and that should give you enough of a sense if you want to get a membership or not. Around 60 is when a membership becomes a little more of a necessity.
---
4 ticks*
---
Spells are 5 tick normally
---
With that attitude it's not surprising people aren't nice to you.
---
You are probably going to get a nice cease and desist very very soon.
---
Happy Holidays!
---
I could see Vetements making an iteration of these hoodies and selling it for £750 lol
---
Those are dope.. I dont care about the legal side.. I just want to get that discounted hoodie my guy✊🏾
---
They really did it in PVP world smh.
---
Why tho
---
Sorry. Hungover and agitated easily lol.
---
This. Keep doing this until you have enough GP for a bond.
---
Then do member quests and your total levels will skyrocket.
---
They really did it in PVP world too smh.
---
Omg what a lame attempt at a joke
---
maybe after you reposted this a 7th time
---
Damn ur playing with fire lmfao
---
Hahah this is pretty impressive
---
Cooked would sell more random high gp pies, people aren't in a rush to buy raw, but if they need a boost for a quest or raids then they are more likely to put it in for dumb gp
---
currently doing the defender grind on my alt. When I get a new defender drop **do i have to leave the room and show the lady outside** in order for next defender to drop? Apparently the wiki says I do, but I vaguely remember many years ago when I first did it on my main whereby I got a mithril, didn't leave, and like a few KC later I was lucky enough to get the addy one. 
---
Anyone confirm this? or just my memory is wrong
---
Im just wondering how in the world you came to figure this out.
---
Do you always just tap the top of two bottles against each other?
---
Lmao I literally bought bonds to get mine but to be fair I have hit Lv92 and have a fire cape that I feel accomplished achieving. I just work 60 hours a week and don't have time to flip or grind skills for cash (I spent several hours a day from 2002 - 2005 doing so). So if an hour or less of my work in $$$ can get me everything I need in one of my favorite games then why not?
---
Yeah, the instrument does a lot to make it sound GoT.

As if that was intentional

Had to upvote your comment :D

Train slayer for alchables
---
Buy stuff for gp
---
Realise you can’t find somebody selling 10k bowstrings, a specific item etc
---
Go on a forum or site such as osbuddy exchange, post a buy order. Arrange to meet and trade, the price has been agreed via the buy order, no negotiations required.
---
What you have is the GE with extra steps and use of a 3rd party website.
---
Some people will be stupid and sign up to that site with same email etc, the site will eventually get hacked. People will complain.
---
I get that you like the nostalgia, but it will wear off when your couple hours on runescape end up being stood their looking for a deal for 40 odd minutes and before you know it you need to make tea, wash the dishes and go to bed. Then your sat looking at how your evening was spent and realise, wow I’m wasting time basically playing exactly the same as a main but with my own version of the GE which is the same but slower and full of scams.
---
I remember the old days, I was there, I personally hated looking for a deal, not knowing the going rate, avoiding scams and spending my time trying to buy a specific item.
---
Sorry, but I can’t see it working at all
---
That’s actually a cool idea lol
---
The good old days, but sadly the playerbase is all social anxiety losers so the best parts of OLD SCHOOL got polled out pretty early on
---
Pretty similar to the one that I ran into, his answer was 'slayer bosses'.
---
...
---
At 27 slayer.
---
lots of cream, lots of sugar
---
It wasn't about being already 99, it was about the polled rate being much lower than the attainable. The meta for 200m rc now is lava runners. Its more intense and much more expensive than zmi was.
---
Pretty sure you have to leave the room and talk to her
---
50/50 really
---
One time I traded my rune plate and legs (g) for a hallow reed (from Legends Quest).
---
you're telling me you mistakenly reposted something 7 minutes inbetween?
---
Ahrim staff is well enough
---
This is what the average looking RuneScape player looks like
---
nah bro he just bankstands instead of training, hes got 4k hour played.
---
I probably was just carrying two bottles at once and just tried it for some reason lol.
---
Tbh a used merc c class 2014 is only like 10k, pretty achievable if you make it a priority
---

I've always thought the cello had best sound of the string instruments; this makes me regret quitting violin 16 years ago.

This is so much better than the dude who draws the same anime face and feet. Quality content.

Big brain

From what i've seen i'd say xzact is the more mechanically skilled of the two, but rendi is the superior theory crafter.
---
It gives the rivalry a fun dynamic and they've been giving each other credit when it's due.
---
It definately took both of them to get the record where it is.
---
Yes you have to leave and go back in. Also you need 100 tokens to enter so if you leave with less than 100 you will have to collect more.

sirpugger made a vid about a botfarm in f2p trading the rewards to literally everyone who just were in bank
---
Selling blue ele legs, 200k. Selling pink ele blouse, 900k
---
This was legitimately how my friends and I made money. Probably got 50-68 str or something solely off guards.
---
I miss this. The GE makes everything a lot easier but I feel like a lot of the socialising disappeared when it got introduced.
---
/u/ItzclaytonB1TCH answer this man!

Can someone explain this to me? He’s roasting Mod Curse?
---
Toadflax farming.
---
And how I made my first million GP.
---
I feel ashamed, but it was fun and it worked.
---
When i hit post nothing changed on the reddit app and it asked me if id like to discard my post when attempting to click out.  I opted to wait in case it was a wifi issue and posted it later which then turned out to be successful.  Maybe at least try to think a little outside the box next time you type ;)
---
I believe it's just the episode number, since it's counting down from 100%
---
It is a 50% chance, it either drops or it doesn't. Why people get so mad at this?
---
Flipping bro.
---
Barrows is a breeze for “mid level” combats and decent money. 
---
Slayer is probably the best gp in the game once you get to the higher skill levels of the skill. 
---
Skills such as smithing, rune crafting, and farming make good gp too once you get to the higher levels.
---
Petition to have hellhounds drop steak that we can cook
---
Try killing more than one brother
---
Damn
---
When casting bake pie from lunar spells you get 180 cooking experience and 60 magic experience per cast.  This is a gross overpricing on my end due to the fact that i highly distaste cooking and this method can obtain over 100k magic experience/hr and well over 332k cooking experience/hr
---
IKR simple. You either get it or you don’t. People probably aren’t educated enough to understand the stats.
---
What if they only had 60 attack?
---
I believe the general rule of thumb is to prioritize strength. But if you want exact DPS, you can use this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit?usp=drivesdk

I've been looking to order them ever since they were discussed. I would DEFINITELY order the Farming, (My first 99) and the Slayer (For obvious reasons.) and would definitely wear them.

bro are you a motivational speaker?

Perfectly explained btw

What!? Why?

If it's so easy there would be more than 7 ppl maxed with 3 weeks left to go
---
Well I got banned again on the same account from this comment for high alching again. I tried pming mod tyran who helped me last time but I haven't heard dick. I'm quitting even though it wasn't my main account banned. Not worth playing the game when bots roam free and legit players get bopped
---
Would people actually buy these tho?
---
Too long, not gonna read it
---
I almost died too when trying to keep her at distance. Her firebreath is by far her strongest attack though, even with protection from ranged on, and she uses only that attack when at distance. When just fighting her at close range, she uses more (weaker) melee attacks and it’s a (relative) breeze!
---
Lots of them are buying from RWT sites and not bonds, which encourages people to run bot farms that devalue activities real players could be doing.
---
Also bandos is pretty close to the last upgrade you should buy, it's such a small boost for what it costs. If you're going to RWT then at least do some research and buy the correct items lol.
---

He has insane defensive stats in that clip, wearing full justiciar armour, looks like guardian boots, and fury too.
---
“WOW OP, first you were an expert typer, now you know how to open Christmas crackers, how do you do it?!”
---
This happened to me on world 3 and my poor 13 year old self bought 3 as the scammer said, "I'm buying 2 for this price, not one." and then said, "I'm buying 3 for this price, not one." 
---
I was gullible.
---
Player 1 and player 2 are friends.
---
Player 1 says "selling *completely useless item* for *way more than market value*".
---
Player 2 stands nearby and says "Buying *same completely useless item* for *even more than player 1*.
---
Player 3 comes along and notices both players and thinks I can buy the item off player 1 and sell it to player 2, making a bit of money. So player 3 buys the item from player 1 and both player 1 and player 2 run off, splitting the money.
---
Ditto at you.  We were talking league rewards.
---
wow u make 16/hour mr money bags kekw
---
The part that makes me laugh the hardest is nmz legit and kandarin hard diary would make agility/strength easy af while staying legit.
---
He got banned for RWT while actively advocating against it.
---
Where's the difference?
---
Next year is the '20s, but it's only the 202nd decade. Nobody cares about the 202nd decade though.
---
I’m not saying it’s easy here and I agree with you more so than the other guy, but most people get enough points for all the rewards and then stop as it’s just a waste of time
---
I mean, he's basically ready for jad, why not dks?
---
Congrats! How did you go about crafting?
---
There shouldn’t be main-game discontinued cosmetics from ancillary game-modes which haven’t had proven long-term success: change my mind.
---
shit i need to turn this on
---
What did I miss?
---
Not necessarily. RS3 has had multiple new rares enter the game, and they still increase in value because the supply can't increase. That said, I still think discontinued rares in OSRS is a bad idea.
---
Not enough karma yet, huh?
---
Yeah this is a bad idea. Needlessly fracturing the economy, easily affected by bots. You can get bis gear straight off tutorial island. I can go on, but this idea is so bad it’s not like I’d add anything new to the argument
---
Also, this shit has been suggested many times before. (Merchant man mode was the last time iirc)
---
Holy fuck
---
You're assuming there isn't a twisted league 2, 3, 4 and 5 sometime
---
Are you Devious? If so I’ve watched every episode so far of your TL series and you are quickly becoming my favorite OSRS content creator. Really enjoyable stuff. 
---
Thanks for the hours of enjoyment!

u can work it out if u go to wiki for each master and see which of the tasks u have unlocked and wat not total weight at the bottom

He didnt say anything about a job or a hobby
---
Everyone was requesting for it, Sorry to upset you sir.
---
Now this is the quality kind of posts I come here for - now I'm gonna be running around the house whacking random things to try and get other game sounds
---
nostalgia
---
That's fair. If you really care enough though, next time there's some drama pay attention to his reddit account, he basically copy pastes the same thing to everyone not positive about him lol
---
I've played the official client and know it's a runelite feature. Never did I say it was an official client feature.
---
Iron mans are gay, iron MAINS however...

Why not unlock it for fire cape?
---
Runecrafting. It's a fun and  profitable skill to train
---
Sounds like a bitch, nothing personal.
---
&gt; it’s just a waste of time

Isn't playing this game just a waste of time? :)

Do you not have the original file?
---
Using real world wealth to gain an advantage over someone else in a video game is looked down on period.  Buying gold defeats the entire purpose of the game, I understand why people do it but buying gold literally just makes this game boring.
---
iphone user, not even suprised
---
Mage arena 2 cape and Ava’s assembler.
---
Yeah, Varrock got a huge overhaul at the time the GE was added and they were planning on doing other cities (IIRC) but eventually just updated the whole game to HD graphics
---
How’d that AGS slap to the back of the neck feel?
---
Maybe the partner slayer method? Have flippers, berserker necklace and flowers to give you a -62 attack bonus and 0.007 chance of hitting. Then use your slayer points on the looting bag. It used to be in the slayer shop, not sure if it still is
---
did you do it?
---
Probably only going to happen with temporary game modes. Maybe the next Twisted League.
---
I’m like level 100 I think but I won a streamer giveaway for 100m once and now I’m set for most things until I can start bossing.

Because f2p does not need access to a boss with a 9mil drop

Welp to speed running. Happens all the time. Someone finds a new route and smashes a record then everyone does it till the new route is perfected.

I'd wear slayer for sure though, my favorite skill and the hoodie looks good. Though tbh i think the hoodies would work better if its just the icon and then you can just choose the colour you want.

I was so excited to buy my first set of full Guthans, it was over 10m at the time. The spear was ridiculously expensive for some reason, so I was careful to pay attention to that in the trade window. They gave me two skirts and no helm 😭

Twisted League 2: Sprinty boi boogaloo

Wether you buy gold from RWT or bonds, you still look dumb as a low level standing around in max gear. If your purpose is to just have good armor so you can boss or something that’s fine. But if you are doing it to look cool, you don’t.
---
What am I missing
---
The trick was to be farish apart on a common path people take. 
---
The buyer could be at the Lumby tele spot, and the seller could be in the bank upstairs.
---
Cool

Yeah I had this issue once when I botted.
---
It's not random it always tells you if you've accumulated more points in TL since you last logged into the main game
---
It's funny that bandos is what everyone talks about but no one bats an eye at pures decked in rangers tunic/boots. A lot of them don't actually have mains, or the ones they have suck hard.

I tried to get into Eve twice, but I just couldn’t keep interest. The worst part is that I really want to like it.

I don’t play very often and I suck at pve. I also can’t even get a Fire cape at this point lol.

How do you have 11b in debt? Like what obligates you to pay that back?

They're still pretty bad last time i checked. Isn't 500 total level required to go upstairs for second wine anyway?

Is buying bonds in January then cashing them in at the end of the year a real thing people do? Seems like an investment I totally could get behind tbh.

I thought this lvl 68 in full 3rd age mage was a merchant but he didn't know what that was, he told me he has a high level account. that explains it.

Fuck King Roland and his inflation!

---
You aren’t risking a ban for buying gold. The only reason to buy bonds over RWT is if you don’t want to support gold farmers ruining the game.
---
It's an elite so you only get 5 rolls. Master clues you get 6.
---
In case you really don't understand the downvotes, 99% of posts like these are from people who botted and are trying to use outrage culture in order to sway the public opinion in their favor to hopefully get their account back. I guess you must be new here.
---
In case you really are that miniscule 1% of people who really did get a false ban, it sucks but thats just how life is man, it aint fair. Don't blame the community, its really the appropriate response given the history of posts like these, blame the bad apples who bot and then make posts like these. They are the culprits.
---
No one gives a shit if it’s a high level player that knows what they’re doing buying gold. It’s when it’s someone who clearly doesn’t know how to play the game they get annoyed.
---
No sweat man. I was the same way until about lvl 95 and my friends are like hey youve got stats you can do bosses ez. Just start out doing 3mans with people to help you itll let you get practice and money splits. Then you can solo one day. I just got a tassy split for my level 81 homie last night with a 3man. Just doubled his bank in 2 hours lol.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you
---
Hes still wrong. If someone does it at lvl 4 with 2 prayer thats still prayer

Name one instance when you would use the proseltyte helm over a hell of neitiznot or something else

I’m piker

Looks like a total unit, I love it. That’s what Ironman is for, no need to be roast! Buying bonds keeps osrs going! I took a 2 year break after OSRS came back and I never unsubscribed my membership, it’s not that I was unaware it’s just something I believe in on a personal level and I’m glad to give them my money. I’m very happy with the direction they’ve gone in. One bad apple doesn’t spoil them all. Buying a few bonds upon coming back also gave me the motivation to get to end game. I now have two 99s. No I didn’t buy my stats outright with bonds but it sure sped up the process and gave me more motivation to play! 1600 total level 85 slayer 99 str and mage (: happy grinding folks

Bonds &gt; scammer gp

Why use a platform that limits what you're allowed to say in the from of mob mentality and a system that hides comments that are contraversial
---
and internet explorer looks like the kid with downs

I’d say there is much less nowadays, I’m a kid and still actively play. Less are into the genre, I know no one that plays MMORPG’s of any kind.

Sad but true, I guess. Maybe in stead of improving weapon diversity Jagex should focus on improving variety in weakness of monsters then.

Skilling is dead content because they just don't earn as much as they used to due to slayer drops and botting. Rcing used to be like 1.8mil an hour. Rune bars was 2mil an hour etc. Now most Skilling methods earn less than 450k/hr and what's the point when you can afk a slayer monster like wyverns or gargoyles for an ez 500k/hr. 
---
Zulrah, zulcano, and vorkath killed alot of prices of staple items in Skilling. Makes it very hard to earn monies

They look cool to themselves and that's really all that matters

RIP....when I was in school MMOs were the shit. Everyone I knew in school either played Runescape or WoW. Loved those days, there wasn't much of a thing as  "dead MMOs" back them

Waldo is just left of the booth btw

Haha i was lucky to get an imbued heart drop, and like you, i got the bcp and rocked the d platelegs too.
---
I ended up getting the torso so i can get a fury and some other stuff. Think of the torso as a way to free up some gp for upgrades :D
---
My point is that someone has to buy the bond and sell it for you to be able to grind towards it.
---
Blast furnace always worked well for me
---
Congratulations on maxing 2,5 ironman! Can't wait for the vid 😊
---
Saving for a bond in f2p is garbage, I wouldn't bother. Personally, I would prep for the member's quest Underground Pass, pay the $11, rush that quest and use Iban Blast to kill Barrows Bros.
---
Woooow that's honestly exorbitant AF tbh
---
Yeah i wasn’t waiting for the video or anything :p spoiler alert?
---
Jesus. How can anyone even justify paying that much?
---
I mean, I just play Twisted League now. Seems like the perfect game for me.
---
You mean you guys don’t take life directions from OSRS redditors?? Wtf you doin

If it weren't for cheaters bro our skilling items would be like quadruple their worth maybe 6 times more and we would all be wealthy
---
It's more annoying than zmi, but its more xp. I still don't get the "muh integrity" cries. Like people can still buy the skill if they want.
---
Membership is always better earlier. If you want to be stingy you can get 50 fm, knights sword and quests without reqs done. Members speeds up everything.
---
No you were clear, I just realized it after I read your comment, yeah kind of a tricky spot with how OP d claws are compared to the rest of them.
---
This is the quality content I come for
---
Problem is I don't have the money to even afford that, so I wanted to best my luck in getting it ingame.
---
First time i’ve seen someone that has years of reddit activity be negative comment karma, meanwhile you’re karma whoring. The actual fuck, pathetic piece of shit and you know it lol
---
I did, it's Twisted League. I just don't have time for normal OSRS anymore. Hence why the whole LeAgUEs aRe A WaStE oF TImE comments are just silly.
---
I would never go back without a G.E. Main reason, quests items....
---
Except anyone who can make that amount of money would know torture and prims would be way better buys. Bcp and tassets are really just good for their def bonuses and they don't degrade like barrows armor.
---
 that's completely subjective 
---
Life is what you make of it
---
The fact is this dudes enjoying his life, and getting fucking paid for it. Lot better than spending your free time shitting on others for having found a successful niche in life where they get to have fun all day as a job.
---
Oh that prolly gets all of you so mad, to see this "no life" enjoying life.
---
Seriously what the fuck is up with this sub snd shitting on other playeds? It's like you're only allowed to play 30 mins a day or you get shit on by redditors that don't even play the game anymre.

You guys are the ones that prowl social media sites to shit on strangers to get a little ego boost, because otherwise you're all miserable and hate being alive, but yeah the guy making a living off this, **he* should get a life... right.

---
Well yeah they're necessary but that doesn't mean you shouldn't shame them. Every mobile game has it's whales, and they're looked down on there by the dolphin/minnow players, so why not in runescape? Most bonds just go straight into the duel arena anyway, so it should be even more discouraged in that regard too.
---
was just thinking the same thing, those were the good ol days..
---
nah people made these kind of suggestions before like merchantman mode etc, I i dont think i need to make post.
---
That's confirmation  bias for you
---
The super lucky ones are more likely to be up voted/shared around
---
People really put reddit attention seekers on a pedestal lmao.
---
I'm not offended lol. I'm just dissapointed at you. You tell others are bad and toxic ppl, then when you're called out, you start to flame and to be toxic to others. Like you seriously called me an incel when i said that we found the guy who gets offended easilly. Like what?!? Can you make your choise what you stand behind.

Aww I missed that. Thanks!

Same. I consistently work 50+ hour weeks and don't have time to grind out 8 or more hours a day, so I occasionally bought bonds on my main to fund different things. Mostly just skilling since I got most of my gear my self (like pennance torso and fire cape, nezzy) but it helped a lot

Because they have billions saved due to doing top tier income methods early like raids. And they want to either max or hit 200mil xp faster. So assuming top rates 250k xp and you only paid runners 7mil an hour(which pros will do depending on how busy it is) you're looking at about 21 bil to get 200mil xp from 99rc in under 750 hours.   Or if you want 99 it'll cost you around 1.3 bill and you'll be done in under 60 hours.
---
Or karril crossbow with full karril armor :p OP for fight caves lol. Blowpipe usually messes noobs up at jad due to its short range - in cases where add is behind Jad, player would target the add and end up in melee range of the boss :p

If you dont like standing around for an hour to trade for the one item you want you must have social anxiety? I have a fucking job I dont want to waste time on that lmao
---
:) :o :(
---
Tank armor and the meta Slayer weapon. Wow.
---
Soooooo. What else does it stand for?
---
Yeah but it has only been 5 weeks at x5 or more the Xp. Its really not that great sorry bro.
---
I’m trying to grind fire bstaffs right now, I’m making more fire orbs with giant seaweed than I can afford battle staffs. Yeah the pay out sucks, but I’ll be damned if I let the skilling side go before I get too deep into PVE. Even if the pay sucks I want to get it done for the record.
---
Can't get hilt or pet.
---
As long as you don't buy gold from 3rd party then I don't see it as a problem. If they're happy playing the game that way and it doesn't affect me then it's a win win
---
Oh I see I was looking at this from a pleb perspective since I only did lavas to 77 (planning on bloods for 77-99). I was wondering how someone had enough money to justify runners for 23-77 but I forgot this is for the people who want to do 99-200m :)
---
Honestly that's egregiously expensive but I suppose it saves you lots of time and what else are you gonna spend the $$ on anyway
---
I still remember people selling santa hats and dragon masks in the area behind the bank. I always stood there wondering if anyone would trade a santa hat or dragon mask with me for far less gold XD
---
I'm actually thinking of starting a 2nd account just for slayer and was gonna xfer all my gear from my main lol
---
Just the best you can use. It won't make a huge difference anyway until you're 40 attack and defense and can wear rune armor. So mithril scimitar is best at 20 attack, adamant scimitar best at 30, rune scim best at 40. And the armor variants are the same for defense. 20 defense = mithril armor. 30 = adamant and 40 is rune.
---
Yeah but a lot of people are kind of weary that any other region isn't going to have anywhere close to this one.
---
So either they're gunna have to mix and match or theyre gunna redo twisted league or maybe do zwah again but with a different twists.
---
I'd love for a lego star wars style Runescape game.
---
What's your IGN? Feel free to add me ingame, IGN: Egolith
---
Good example of someone that needs to learn the lesson I've learnt.
---
Gauntlet. You need to SotE i think.
---
I'm on the younger side when it comes to osrs as I found it in 2015 but I'd say it's much rarer to find kids who play Runescape in the first place.
---
They actually are pretty awful tasks unless you get a lucky ship (just got my first one) or do some sire
---
Your clicks can be absolutely perfect but it will still look like you fucked them up if you are doing it on world 2, you would be better off trying your clicks out on gargoyles
---
Don't worry! It's not actually prayer flicking. I think you have like 4.5 seconds in-between attacks. Just need to be methodical!
---
I'm not arsed either way, I've bought bonds before to restock tabs and I've also done monotonous tasks for weeks at a time to afford big shit.
---
In the end it's a game play how you want.
---
He did the same as Rendi
---
For anyone curious, here's an example of accuracy against a target with a 5000 def roll. [The x-axis is your attack roll, and the y-axis is the accuracy.](https://i.imgur.com/o7C9XDN.png)
---
For most targets, your attack roll will generally exceed their def roll. There are a handful of bosses where accuracy actually matters though, so it's always worth double checking on the DPS calc spreadsheet beforehand.
---
We need a freedom dividend of 1000 gp a month
---
Yeah I know, I’m his friend and I’m trolling lol
---
Inferno after 3 attempts? Wtf?
---
Ooo I’d love to have that!
---
that was a classic example of doing it wrong because they got bought en mass and hoarded (although im sure it was a plus for jagex selling the spins or whatever)
---
I think some rs3 rares like the black party hat they just said yeah we are only giving out like 1000 of these
---
You about to be helped out bro add this man
---
Irrelevant? You saying this because maxing in TL is easy?
---
I admit that I buy bonds when I got paid but I waste the money getting that sweet xp
---
How did sea shanty become so famous?!
---
Oziach?
---
Wait, you're the one who posted to nerf the max hits of inferno mobs, why are you even posting here?
---
Why is this an issue if you only use the platform for RS discussion?
---
U mean he rwt
---
Way over qualified for the military.
---
I find low level players in f2p in full gilded gear all day long. They have no stats so I just assume they got it from their main.
---
Oh no. Did your mouse run away? Have you tried to column?
---
Maybe, just maybe with the Mort expansion they might still have time to add in little features that’ll allow us to play in that region. At least they’ve got an agility course there already.
---
But as far as future leagues, Zeah seems to be the only realistic one.
---
Lmao that’s 100% my pure account. I got a lot of hate when I was training at sand crabs.
---
Motherlode Mine PTSD
---
Made so much on unidentified herbs back in these days
---
Auction house. You must play wow too haha
---
I mean yeah if you're going for str bonus, but when you're training on king crabs...
---
Lexus
---
Repair issues
---
Whaaatttt??
---
Not according to all these bots trying to sell me 1k divine super attack(2)s /s
---
Alt accounts? Plus bandos looks so badass
---
What was the lowest level fire cape back in runescape 2?
---
You’re pretty infuriating to talk to, do you always twist someone’s words and then run off on a rant? No one said anything about proper education, and you’re completely ignoring how there are still Nazis in the present day. Ergo your proper education argument while being completely irrelevant to the conversation is all proper bullshit.
---
did you forget this reply?
---
&gt; Nah i'm pretty sure the jokes still on you.
---
If they have a good (as in well thought out) them saying that is very beliveable.
---
yeah. 5x base going up to 20x for certain skills as you unlock these "relics" passively
---
There's a thing called alts. My smithing and fishing are way higher on my alt than my main, for example.
---
Lets say the minimum is 5. 
---
U get 5 5 5 5 5 5 at minimum cooking. 
---
U get 8 more cooking levels. 
---
Say u get 5 5 5 5 5 6. Well now your average is above 5. 
---
I know what you wanted to ask its just you didnt ask that lol. And idk the answer to that and its probably never been asked.
---
Holy shit thats awesome
---
You will be offered a Tzaahr task randomly. You can choose to switch to Jad. If you already have a fire cape, and don’t like doing the regular task, you can skip it the way I suggested.  You can also deselect the Tzaahr task as a whole, but then you lose your unlock points.
---
he shall have his day in court.  we will find out then
---
You don’t barrage in ancestral, you barrage in arma in higher waves for bonus range defence.
---
People have been saying this forever because they love to be negative and dreary.  Plenty of people are online playing.
---
I've gotten two from 85-87 slayer with a shit ton of points spent on skips. They definitely lowered the weight from what it says on the wiki. For duracell at least.
---
99 con hands down
---
Lmao this is perfect and so accurate
---
50,000 people used to flip here
---
Now it's a ghost town
---
i miss pre-ge days. what made runescape feel like runescape
---
That was me, Ive gotten ranger boots twice in a medium clue school, was around level 65 combat the first time so I was balling pretty quick. I’m 111 combat now and worth around 100m never felt more broke.
---
I have a maxed poh already. It would be just for the cape
---
or his father works at jagflex
---
Yes. The ability to do things with the ge like buy the item requirements for 7 quests at a time makes the game a bit too easy, but I also dont want to spend 200 hours grinding to get a magic short bow etc
---
I'll never forget the days I spent there where I managed to slowly scam my way up to a full set of addy (g). The victory was short lived however, as a few days later I disconnected while fighting white knights in Falador castle and lost most of it. Certain the gear was cursed and loaded with bad karma, I sold what was left of it and bought myself a rune chainbody (hadn't done Dragon Slayer) and some rune platelegs. It felt like it'd paid for my crimes and redeemed myself, now swearing to play the game right and never scam another player again.
---
they go for 2 months and this one lasts for 3 more weeks. They haven't announced when the next one will be. You get cool little cosmetic rewards afterwords for the main game. If you're interested, you definitely still have time to unlock the slayer helmet variant and POH design
---
It isn’t meta. Meta is just learning to set up waves because then you don’t rely on RNG and can reach zuk consistently. But for your first time cape if you don’t have the patience or you think you’re not good enough to learn the waves justiciar is great for dealing with bad spawns.
---
I re-read my post 10x. Not once did it ask for your opinion on why I should or shouldn't come back to play.
---
I don’t think that the 10 minutes it would take to change it is worth it for the 5 people that use that dead content in the game
---
And now, in 2019, we discovered that the one true "wow killer" was itself all along.
---
I actually forgot to add u but I added occasional commenter. U still wanna run some too?
---
I've got 90% of an ahrims top and bottom I want to use,  any recommendations on what to use it for?
---
&gt;pumping money into a game for pixels that only decrease your playtime
---
I'd bet you're an efficiency nerd. You're wasting your time grinding time in game to get the same item that Chad McDick got in an hour of working at McDonalds. Why do you care how someone gets their items unless you're incredibly insecure about the amount of time you spend in this game to accomplish the same item goals.
---
I can't speak for you and your circumstance but if I had to spend more than 10 minutes trying to buy something in a game by mindlessly spamming the same string of text, I wouldn't play that game for very long. Even as a kid playing in 2005, this was my least favourite part of the game.
---
Cuz this subreddit is constantly spammed with shitty “achievements”
---
Looks like I need to start pking at lava maze.  Only thing better than big loots is an angry ass kid who gets so upset he makes Reddit posts and tells his mom.
---
I was a kid playing runescape when this released. Such a classic. For me it’s up there with “Wanna buy a box?”
---
Neither am I. Like i said, it's all about how you manage your time.
---
The death animation looked well good then
---
I’ll probably just tag the new mager then; the only loss will be redemption and the gain will be better odds to not spawn the third set during the healers
---
One time I found I was able to buy claws and sell them almost instantly for 200k extra, did this until I hit the limit and made 1.6m or so(200k x 8 times or whatever for limit) I don’t merch or know what I’m doing so I never tried with anything else, but do people find or know about items that will allow you to do this at specific times?
---
Yeah, scales are a large quantity item.
---
I have 200k scales. 50 each is a 10m difference.
---
So tasks dont last 9 years.
---
Ah, a fellow Eve Online player.
---
Just a word of warning, you are going to get massively downvoted because you just did the equivalent of going into a lion cage at the zoo with a sign that says "Lions suck".
---
That said, OSRS isn't a great game honestly. The problem is that there is a clear way to play the game that's better than any alternative, and while people will counter me by saying *"You can play the game however you want"* or *"Just make an Ironman"* the statement still applies.
---
Either you are playing the game in the most efficient way possible or you are wasting time because there isn't really any challenge to it except for the end-game which takes a lot of grinding to do. Most of the challenge in this game is just how many hours can you put your butt on the computer doing the same thing until your boredom gets the best of you. I haven't come across anyone in recent times who plays OSRS without something on the side like a movie or a series to mitigate how boring the game is when you are paying attention to it.
---
I still to this day don't understand how game developers made a game where it gets more boring the more attention you are paying to it. Also, most skilling tasks and moneymaking methods are better suited for machines rather than humans because the developers design everything to be grinded into a pulp, which explains the large number of bots that inflate the player count.
---
My advice would be to literally find any other game, OSRS will suck up your time and energy like a bitch.
---
Holy shit 30k worth of death runes 
---
Gratz buddy!
---
&gt; you just cba
---
&gt; i haven't even bothered  
---
That's what he said
---
They did do something kind of similar in RS3 with the World Events.
---
I feel like this will get deleted but I got a good chuckle out of it.
---
Premier club sales will end in january. So that will drop the bond prices as there are no other uses to buy bonds than normal member and selling it for gp=prices will drop
---
Same here, also Camelot bank. Only time I've been scammed. Felt dumb.
---
People always thought I bought my stuff too lol. While still technically against the rules, questing for other people is a fantastic way to make money. At around 4-5m per hour, bandos and arma by around 75cb.
---
Eh, it’s 50/50
---
Why do you think kids don't still play video games
---
There has never been a year since 2006 where somebody hasn’t said the game was dying. It will never die. Enjoy your scaping!
---
Judging by the comments, it would appear so. I shall keep that duly noted :P
---
He does play a healthy amount. He works for 8 hours being a content creator and then spends 6-8 hours of his free time enjoying himself and playing one of his favorite games.
---
The grand exchange is a mistake
---
Level 88 told me he did 750 bandos runs
---
Oh okay so they buy a bunch of bonds to get the premier club membership?  
---
In past years did it drop right after Christmas or was it after the club membership stopped?
---
If you're gonna Smith something for AFK experience, darts will be way more money than cannonballs
---
I wouldn’t say it isn’t worth grinding for gp or you should only grind for your gp, but people just need to not care about other people’s personal choices. Little Johnny bought bonds because he doesn’t like to grind or doesn’t know how? Cool. Let him. If little Johnny starts piping up however it’s a bit of a different story
---
500k warrior ring. Oof!
---
After the club sales end. Premier club is 20 bonds iirc.
---
No it's like saying you cant get bunny ears that are like 2 pixels longer and rotated 1 degree forward or something else small like that
---
Yea but how else can I let everyone know I’m a maxed ironmeme without having to say btw
---
Santa clause is real !!!!
---
I am not sure why you are focusing that part of my sentence and ignoring everything else, the meaning had been those who are involved in the community of Reddit not just those who post a comment every so often. Anyway don't take it so personally as my comment agrees with you  As I say try not to take one line so personally
---
you're not forced to tho boi. if you dont work for it you dont get it. you got a lot of participation awards in school didnt you?
---
Very true, I’d much rather have the irl cost of bonds go up than bots and rwt continue to fuck the game
---
Damn those r nice pins!
---
Marry Christmas everyone best of luck.
---
Ditto, that's why I bot raids.
---
lol he has 99 RC
---
I'm the cute noob 😳😳😳
---
Imagine this point of view when Rs3 has 4k players online and not considered dead.
---
You do some great work(: I especially love the detail on the Smithing pin.
---
Ohhh I would love the nature or law rune pin!
---
These look pretty awesome to me!
---
Twisted league 2 episode 3? When is it gaben??
---
I’m ready!
---
Some of these pins look quite neat!
---
Gzzz
---
gzzzzz
---
I’ve gotten 2 3a items in under 300 hard clues on my main, a pick axe and a chest plate.
---
Was I right tho? I'm in the process of making a rune drag/gwd tank too
---
What order is good to get melee stuff in I never knew the strat. My bank has ~50m in liquidity and I'm looking to upgrade. Rn I'm 109cb and rock:
---
bcp, torag legs, fury, dboots, nezzy/slayer helm, fire cape, whip, ddefender, rada blessing and rings depending on what im killing.
---
Make an iron man and kindly fuck off. The GE was the best QOL update to come to the game
---
windows mousekeys are bannable
---
You're either right or wrong, so theres a 50% chance of it being 1/8
---
Yes please!
---
Just go around spamming chat, preferably within the GE. Cause "Ge BaD, TrAdE sPaM GoOd".
---
Yo are you the same Orangesoda65 from Grindr?
---
minesw
---
I added him, hope he has a Merry Christmas with his bond :)
---
2nd this
---
How is that botproof lol
---
Heard
---
With the BH rework, it takes like 3 hours to get enough points to buy it from the BH store. Or you can buy it from a slayer master with slayer points.
---
Wooooosh
---
Me
---
thanks, didn't realize that haven't played in a while and runelite was still showing emblems in GE so was confused
---
Lmao who hurt you? Did your mom leave your dad for an ironman or something?
---
He will man Merry Christmas, probably about the most fun you can give someone for $4.
---
It's literally the same cup with different logo on the front
---
Same but I got them before 30 kc
---
UwU Merry Christmas
---
Windows is better than Mac for gaming in general in my experience
---
Don't get so sweaty, man
---
&gt;I enjoy runescape and the grind, you clearly don't
---
This, at the very least, comes down as condescending/hostile
---
I’d really love to learn TOB!
---
I’m an Ironman but I have all gear requirements except arcane
---
why shouldnt there be? both of you have failed to actually explain why there shouldn't be. the face that deadman mode didnt do it isn't an actual reason leagues shouldnt lmao. tbh I think deadman mode should do shit like that. it's a cool reward to show that you participated in an event as well as showing how well you did in that event.
---
nobody is entitled to awards they didnt earn and it's pathetic how many people are complaining that they cant have a pixel trophy without putting the work in.
---
Your welcome bro :) Glad to have more people experience all of OSRS. Merry Christmas!
---
I'm just wondering if anyone has tips on 3 tick fishing on mobile. I'll be traveling for a few days with only a bit to play when waiting/car rides.
---
Any other afk mobile task suggestions are welcome, too. I just figured fishing is pretty afk (I'm level 72 fishing).
---
No idea lol
---
Void is better from what I’ve read
---
Don't fuck with cats
---
different leagues should have different top tier trophies ya?
---
Exactly, you get it. Merry Christmas
---
And they both are prayer flicking and tick eating, does woox and someone else deserve all the credit for these runs instead of either of them?
---
Got rangers
---
I like the idea but then people will just get shitty custom ones made instead and less money goes to jagex
---
These whoosh comment threads always go down hill so fast
---
As a noob, what would be a better enemy to use those tube knives on?
---
Merry Christmas!
---
zybez vs ge, no longer fally park
---
Ok now this is epic
---
I play the game the way I want because I enjoy it, and the way I enjoy it doesn't concern you. Just like how the way you enjoy it doesn't concern me, and how the way others enjoy it doesn't concern either of us. Stop being a little bitch and accept it. You have a serious issue my dude.
---
I got it but thank you very much :)
---
Nope, I dont even live in Minnesota. Try again, liar.
---
Higher level fishing is very afk, I'm talking like monkfish and beyond. I find it more afk than mining/smiting)
---
Dwh sang
---
Obviously they would lose on purpose
---
69 nice
---
Man, get some help.
---
It looks seriously great! I love the particle effects and detail on Cerberus. However, to be a bit more critical:
---
- There's no trapdoor
---
- The person doesn't look like an osrs player at all, kills the immersion a bit
---
- The gif isn't a perfect loop, and it's pretty short, so it jumps early and often
---
- Not exactly a critique but would be cool to see the river in the back
---
Sitting at 9k points, but I haven't been on tl since over a week, just got being real quick
---
Hey internet, somethig in real life reminds me of internet
---
Dope!
---
UPDATE: I think I know why this happened now, I played the two accounts last night on my mobile while connected to a VPN, I suspect a bot farm was banned that was using the same VPN and banned all accounts from that address. Was using PIA VPN if anyone's interested...
---
They look awesome!
---
Not having the ge is so awful. I bet we wouldn't have half the current players with no ge
---
It’s not really a flex he doesn’t have any especially expansive items. I think he’s just a mid game player looking for advice
---
void
---
Baby
---
Fair enough. I didn’t know RS3 did that. I now hate my idea and will downvote it.
---
I mean, am I wrong? people who buy bonds literally pay money to skip the grind, so they obviously don’t enjoy it.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Neat!
---
Those are amazing would so much want one
---
Sick!
---
I’m confused, are these trophies going to be tradable?
---
So nice man.
---
These look great!
---
Happy holidays! These are so cute
---
Gimmie gimmie.
---
Merry christmas !!
---
Blast Furnace for whatever the highest tier ingot you can smelt is is always the most profitable.
---
It's mentality like yours that would've kept us in the horse and buggy
---
Memememe
---
Prove it. Show stats
---
I’m @ my family Christmas rn but if you’re on later I’ll probably be on. The f2p grind is awful
---
Those are really good! The runes are super nice
---
Pin me to bed daddy.
---
Wait, thats illegal!
---
Pin pls
---
holy shit you are so offended hahahahahaaaa
---
Shut up David Aldi
---
These look so cool!
---
I am not :)
---
Damn those look so sick! Especially the rick and morty
---
I mean depends on stats and what you want to do. I can tell you to go do the max efficiency no wasted exp guide, but if you're playing right now from a nostalgic point that might not be for you.
---
I would look up the new content that came out to osrs and try to play that. Alternatively you could try the new game mode twisted league which is exclusively on zeah/kourend which is a whole new Continent that pretty much offers you a all encompassing look on the island. If you do twisted league I would look up some YouTube videos and try to imitate what they are doing. You kind of need to know why you are doing things and what there is to do and the only way to do that is to play and ask people on a clan chat what they are doing, or by watching twitch streamers and just learning vicariously.
---
Like there is something in the game you could enjoy. It's just the amount of different things you have to filter through that you're not going to know where to even start googling.
---
Merry Christmas, Friend!
---
Hope I win!
---
im not kidding btw, i recently found another way to make $ so i might as well leave the botting scene with a bang
---
This is dope, good on you man. I purchased the agility girl last year as a little bonus for my brothers stocking and got a free nature rune with it!
---
This may be one of those noobs with rangers on medium #4 who spam this subreddit every day
---
My girlfriend and I love playing rs together :) she would love a surprise pin
---
I still think time was the true wow killer.
---
Awesome bro those look legit
---
If your only focus is melee, i suggest you sell dboots and fury and buy prims and torture. Also you can get fighter torso and sell bcp for an easy 18m
---
While I personally don't care for the pins, I think it's really cool you're doing this!
---
That’s a negative ghost rider
---
Comment here
---
You must be fun at double penetrations
---
relapsed hard into RS this christmas, come at me &gt;:)
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
I don't see how that's relevant to what I said.
---
&gt;and look down on everyone beneath them.
---
I think you're just projecting, you were the one being condescending, not the bond-buyer.
---
I must win
---
I tried to use Chrome and immediately stopped when I couldn't mute the sound of specific tabs individually. Firefox all day
---
Good luck!
---
Then why are people upset about them being discontinued?
---
Let’s hope! Thanks for doing this!
---
It seems a lot of super successful gaming companies got a touch of the immortality syndrome, like they can do anything and it won’t hurt them... but they lost their touch and the reason they’re that successful to begin with. In favor for investors interests.
---
They also follow too closely with their competitors and think they’re one in the same. But this is as much art as it is a gaming franchise. If you try too hard to be like some other company you’re going to come off as gimmicky. Jagex brought OSRS out and it’s successful now. But from what I’m told the WoW Reboot was a complete failure .
---
Natural 20 roll pls
---
Loving the pins!
---
&gt; I feel annoyed that other people act like they’re better than me because of how I choose to play the game,
---
Again with the assumptions dude.
---
&gt;can you think of any other reason people would buy bonds
---
I have friends that hardly have time to play the game. If it wasn't for bonds they wouldn't be able to play at all, and I wouldn't have met them or be able to do shit like raids with them. None of them feel superior to you or I or other people that "actually play the game", but they get shit on regardless because "lol you skipped the grind you don't invest as much time into this game as I do". That's an incredibly shitty attitude to have towards other people.
---
Sand casino is a fair point, but that's a whole other issue revolving around gambling addiction.
---
Probably did all quests bounties and lamps on it
---
Im the one of them. Shamelessly funded by bonds. Too lazy to earn the GP, and too nervous to RWT.
---
You’re a true Christmas miracle, happy holidays!
---
Lets see, 1 ranger boot drop is around 1/400 for med clues, 400 x 400 is 1/1600 for 2, then 400 x 400 x 400 x 400, roughly a 1/2 chance, because theres a chance that either you get the boots or you dont.
---
Hey fam
---
Bruh, I really want that law rune one, thanks so much for this again!
---
my main issue with FF is twitch kinda sucks on it, its laggy and the memory usage goes crazy high the longer you watch.
---
Your content was the best to watch dude, I literally looked forward to your Twisted League uploads. Congrats on maxing!
---
For those that don't know, Rune Mysteries grants access **only** to mining essence. You can still craft runes without doing the quest despite how the quest reward reads.
---
Love these
---
These are really cool, and it's very kind of you to give them away! Thanks OP.
---
It’s not that they bring down bond prices. It’s that they are the ones responsible for all bonds on the GE.
---
You're kind of an asshole to someone spending half a grand giving people free things, that's all.
---
I'd like a pin. Very cool!
---
Oh man these are looking fresh, I'd totally slap one on my backpack for walking around NYC
---
&gt; Then with regards to balance, I think it was just idiotic to not show us the tasks and relics beforehand.
---
Heavily disagree - they definitely messed up on balancing of points but it's not that big of a deal.  I think them keeping things under wraps made it more fun and exciting.  You have to figure things out as you go and theory craft during the 2 months instead of being allowed to test things in game beforehand.  It adds another element of skill if you're someone that is playing for points on the high scores.  
---
I'm sure their next league will be more balanced and they won't have stupid point rewards like 250 points for stealing a gem from a stall.  Hopefully they also increase drop rates so it isn't so RNG based and maybe reduce or remove pet points completely.
---
Strange thing is my comments have done that a few times this week. I’ll reply to one comment but it’ll reply to another and I’ll get a response asking if I replied to the wrong comment.
---
The birds work for the bourgeoisie
---
Fingers crossed!
---
As far as stats go, my only nonmember skill not over 50 is runecrafting. I know of twisted league, but haven’t looked into it much, but might be cool. I’ll look into that.
---
Firstly, 3 tick fishing isn't afk at all, it's very click intensive.  
---
Secondly, the good news is that most stuff in the game has a range of options for getting it done, and for the most part they're deliberately designed to fall proportionally on the spectrum of afk vs. speed.  Most skills have this and moneymaking has this.  So for example, if you want to make money, you could do something like Zulrah and make money quickly but you have to play pretty hard.  Or you could do something like afk Brutal Black Dragons and make maybe a third of the money, but you only have to click like once a minute.  Or your own example for fishing, you can 2t or 3t fishing and get fast xp, but you have to play pretty hard.  Or you can AFK barb fish for half the xp but pay no attention whatsoever to the game.
---
So just pick something that you want to do and there will probably be some solid afk options for it.
---
1/200 easiest grind lmao
---
As a pin collector, I love these. Expect an order soon lol
---
Thank you, this is all I was looking for.
---
The spike and drop off was caused by OSRS mobile. all in all we have gained people because of this
---
Me pls
---
Haha eitje
---
I got the 400th upvote!!!! Somone gets a pin!!!
---
Happy holidays y’all.
---
exactly ! like we enjoy the game so so much but couple clicks at sand casino can set back years of progress !
---
One of the best money makers in the game
---
The three main ways to farm Vorkath are the top 3 money makers in OSRS
---
These are awesome! The R&amp;M is hilarious.
---
Those are amazing!
---
Views lol they want the narrative thay way.
---
Pin man good
---
Bro i probably used your guide
---
Thank you Santa!
---
New BIS strength training weapon?
---
ty
---
Awesome of you!
---
This doesn’t sound like mining
---
The Gower Brothers were adamant when they started the game that real life achievement should not determine in game achievement. That in game achievement should be the result of in game effort. That people with excess wealth in real life should not have an advantage over those who do not. This was part of why rwt, and therefore botting, were punished the way they were. (credit card fraud was the other major reason) 
---
Obviously things have changed a lot since then. Back in the day most of the people playing were kids; the ones who could afford to buy gp didn't "earn" it, so much as having lucked into a family that could (for the most part). 
---
Now, as the company and their customers have changed, naturally mindset of both have as well. I think many players who started back in the day have some lingering leanings to the old mindset.
---
That's my two cents/theory, not sure how it holds up
---
Hohoho keep the karma farming up
---
The voiders look so clean
---
Does anyone have any faith that PVP will ever be a big part of OSRS again?
---
When their best pk is a spade I think 1k per cast isnt too efficient
---
Don’t use knives, use darts they’re cheaper
---
That’s dirty progress, which most of us don’t have the luxury of abusing.
---
I'm willing to *grind hard* for a nature rune, op.
---
Thank you for the feedback back greatly appreciated. :)
---
Do people actually rp in those world's?
---
Imagine getting 200m rc xp before doing rune mysteries, wtf
---
He's a parody of himself. I've never met an "artist" before that actively gets worst with every price. Actually mind-boggling.
---
A
---
If anyone’s had their achievements devalued it’s anyone that got 99 slayer before the catacombs were a thing. But that’s slayer everyone’s favorite skill so it’s fine that max xp rate has doubled, but god forbid we have an rc or agility method that’s not complete aids and gives decent xp.
---
That wad easy 😇😾💨
---
Thanks I'll stick to fishing, mining, woodcutting
---
Some times I don't even complete a task a day.
---
Schnazzy
---
slayer  can be good too given many tasks are auto retaliate-able
---
Cooking, Mining, Fishing, Woodcutting.
---
These skills don't really benefit that much in members worlds XP wise unless you are going to 2tick or 3tick.
---
But it isn't really advised to use tick manipulation on every skill as you will lose your hands.
---
For Cooking you can do wines. It is roughly 1 gp/xp for around 400k xp per hour. Very cheap considering it is a very good xp rate. This is also the best  xp method in members.
---
For mining I recommend drop mining iron wherever you can find 2 iron rocks. There are a few locations in f2p with 3 but they are all probably botted. This is the best xp method in members until 3t granite and maybe blast mine. 
---
Woodcutting there are quite a few faster methods in members but not by a significant margin unless you 2tick Teaks. I did this for roughly 2 hours and it was probably one of the least enjoyable things I have done on this game. I recommend getting this skill up in f2p. Do willows for best xp in f2p. Maples/yews for more afk.
---
Fishing is totally up to you. I would at least get 58 fishing so you can immediately do either barbarian or aerial fishing. Barbarian 3t is the best xp (aside from 2t with an alt on pvp). It is much more doable than Woodcutting IMO. If you want to try a tick manipulation method, I personally recommend barbarian fishing. In f2p, dropfishing trout/salmon is not bad xp and somewhat afk.
---
The other benefit of doing these skills is that your rewards at wintertodt will be much better. The crate rewards scale based on certain skilling levels.
---
Mining /Woodcutting &gt; fishing/cooking
---
Would be how i would prioritize.
---
I don't do much slayer at the moment, but while I did go for 93 I did 1-5 a day. Mostly 1 or 2. I tried to use a cannon for as many slayer tasks as possible for as long as another alternative did not give better rewards or shards. I also did clue scrolls. So for example, hellhounds would take 20-80 minutes depending on how many clues I would receice. Fire giants I did in the catacombs for nice afk (1-2 hours). And for Black demons I did demonic gorillas (4 hours +).
---
Clue scroll guardians for boots tbh.
---
The QUEEN
---
Yes, but do you want to spend your logged in time bank standing trying to buy/sell something or do you want to actually play the game? I have limited time to play so I'd choose the latter, personally
---
Man people will really twist themselves into knots to try to detract dedication or enjoyment as "addiction" in literally everything now, huh? Maybe consider that video games are not alcohol before trying to draw them up as equals in any context.
---
Gl everyone
---
Did you know there are two people with the exact same build as you called Quaffle8 and Haydn?
---
My #1 reason for playing leagues is the seasonal competition and also it’s just more fun than the main game
---
If you want fast experience then cannoning is your best bet. Cballs are so cheap right now so it’s easy to make the money back. If I cannon I can easily get 100k exp in about 4-5 hours. If I cannon and burst I can do so many tasks but without it it will take me all day to get a good amount done
---
Even tho I dont celebrate it I wish you lads a merry Christmas!
---
Loooooots is exp lamps
---
Bit late but thought I'd add that I totally agree with you. I liked my old account and the reason I haven't played for ages is because it's locked to rs3
---
You must not be sleeping or your acc sharing. Dragon tier is legit 12 hours a day.
---
Isn't this how the Gower bros initially recorded the sounds anyway? Just running around their house recording the most benign things?
---
I mean I like Runescape, but I think I can speak for a lot of people here when I say that a lot of these hoodies are really bright and noticeable and would definitely make you stand out which some people may or may not want.
---
Nothing to do with slaying pussy or what people are thinking per say, but if you choose to wear bright and flashy colors expect to get some looks or comments which can be good or bad.
---
Not trying to be self conscious or w/e, but I can definitely see where people are coming from with these comments.
---
In the end people can choose to wear it or not wear it so it doesn’t really matter
---
Good job wasting time. The account will dissapear soon.
---
Nice. They look so cool!
---
ReEntering for the max hp love cape!! Thanks for the second chance!
---
No im not
---
Im assuming at least 25% of players value the achievement of having 99 rc
---
Same. Lol it's Christmas, are you on the giving spirit for someone who was phished for 374m? Lol
---
Train your smithing.
---
"My friend quit"
---
Made me chuckle when I seen you blacked out the dds.
---
Also congrats man
---
Should have just played the league lmao
---
Nah I’m pretty sure he meant rune.
---
This is the most tedious game ive ever heard of
---
Anyone who plays this game doesnt mind tedious that much
---
This was my first ever attempt at flipping! I accidentally bought 2 steel axes at vastly different prices once I hit level 6 Woodcutting and so I made some money out of the discovery!
---
Mining not max? Ohwow
---
This is cool! I'd definitely love some runescape swag. I'd toss these on my backpack.
---
I mean most functioning members of society can play osrs and have sex. They aren't really exclusive or hard to do.
---
You're assuming that I'm the type of person to lobby for convenience at every opportunity. I only choose quality of life updates for activities that are an actual waste of time. But, if you'd prefer to stand at a bank and buy/sell manually no one is going to stop you. As I mentioned in another response, I have a limited amount of time to play now and I'm not going to spend it not playing the game.
---
You can just tell this guy has a handful of iq points missing.
---
It is the pain of not being able to obtain something. I agree that its dumb but that is why people are upset
---
Yep and firecapes. 
---
The item stayed on ground for a minute or so but sometimes impossible to get back in time.
---
I haven't done Giant Dwarf so I don't have blast furnace. I neglected a lot of quests so 2020 goal is to get quest cape.
---
woah woah woah, don't you think that's a little unfair to the people who have maxed multiple accounts? Only if you've achieved them on a HCIM and an UIM and have 200m exp on a regular account.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean for my comment to be a direct reply to what you said. I knew what you meant &amp; do agree, I just wanted to contribute to the conversation and hopefully add some value to people's lives.
---
There are too many people (particularly on old games like OSRS) who take one look at things and decide to automatically judge everything. Although it is in human nature to do so, it often limits self-development.
---
I read this is DOOMs voice lol.
---
May I also ad if you try going for the drop you may just be lucky
---
Ty4flip
---
I agree - the sense of accomplishment that you gain from playing RuneScape is unparalleled. Every single XP point that you gain counts for something, and will never be taken away from you.
---
By buying essence and crafting runes that way, you don't actually need to do Rune Mysteries to craft runes despite what the quest reward says.
---
Gimme dat Adventure Time chaos ele, plz
---
same people who still fall for anti-scams.
---
go to fossile island crabs, they got 300hp vs 240hp in a single spot.
---
/r/birdsarentreal
---
&gt;I have to kill this boss 5k+ times 
---
no you don't
---
you could also just
---
not go for the item
---
Its 50/50, fuck off.
---
Please don't kill it - I'm still poor :)
---
Jokes, use and abuse it. If I'd been more savvy I'd already have beaten it to death myself.
---
these are super cute!
---
and look like a noob who never killed zulrah before with the bogey ass helmet..? lol no thank you
---
I remember doing Agility with you last year. Proud of you. :]
---
Praise be
---
Serp helm is basically dead content
---
I think they’re doing it for this thing called fun, not efficiency
---
Reminder that she's made of **molten rock**, so you better oil that rod up before you start fishing in that lava pool.
---
People running botfarms make insane money dude lmao.
---
They are a big player base now, but still not nearly as big as normal accounts. Its also meant to be a "special" game mode - thus meaning updates that effect the entire game should be made with only the regular game mode in mind.
---
i have been trying, retard. why do you think i even made the post. because it's quite frustrating when literally everyone else i seen got a mutagen by 1k kc at the most, some even got both tanz and magma.
---
For one-upping. Its toxic to the community to belittle achievements.
---
Oy I just went through this. Log into RS on the old phone and disable the authenticator in the account settings. Then, log in to RS on the new phone and enable the authenticator. This should prompt you with an authenticator setup code.
---
If you're like me and couldn't access the account email to disable the authenticator, you must go through account recovery.
---
Congrats on the new phone and happy holidays!
---
i do tob
---
Boosting a couple of BH kills was way more tempting than being PK food for 2 weeks hunting wildy emblems
---
200 kc and 26m loot tab so far. Yes, very good money.
---
I disagree, and i think many would also, lots of decisions have/will be made with ironmen in mind. I also don't think it's any sort of gamebreaking change and would only really offer benefit to ironmen.
---
Maybe 1 maybe 10 it depends what taks i get. If i decide to do  blue drags at vorkath for example it might take me over a day depending on how many times i get bored and take a break
---
Get someone without a shit helm to use the serp then
---
I died at 16 wildly with fcape and it’s basically gone.
---
People were also pricks and prevented people from reclaiming loot and snared them until it was for sure gone.
---
Who says that's not a steel defender
---
That rick and morty one is sick
---
He'll figure it out once hes talks to Oziach
---
Before dragonstones crashed down to like 10k ea, back when they were 50-60k a pop, rouges chest was the place to be, could make 1.5-2m an hour easily. And the escape is to easy. Ranked a total of 3-4 people pretty regularly. Just have to make it to the stairs and you’re gone from everyone. 
---
Sorry m8 just get good at the game.
---
Sick ty. One second seems fine for the def assurance it gives
---
There’s a deal you can put on to one click drop
---
You didn’t say, but I’m assuming you have barrows gloves?
---
The sentiment isn't valid because the answer isn't accurate.  The question is about odds.  The answer is, at best, a comment on there being two possible states in that context.  It's almost like answering "How is &lt;word&gt; spelled?" by saying "With letters" - except there the answer is at least true despite intentionally misunderstanding the question.  Saying "50/50" isn't even true.
---
I can't believe this is something people actually need explained to them.
---
Cant wait to hit 2200 and set one of those bad boys as my home world
---
This game is based around rng, if you have bad rng then tough shit.
---
Glad to hear, pizza man!
---
~He
---
You have to get your skill up to 80+ before you can make any decent money with said skill..
---
Gimme law, soul, or nat.
---
Drop it. Time spent gather requirements, you’d have third age twice from other clues you’ve done.
---
I hope you're wrong because otherwise there's a security whole somewhere in my whole setup and that's terrifying
---
You should have been the one to make these for Jagex. Love them man
---
I always read drop panties or double pen when i saw someone say dp follow! Id be aboard that train everytime until i saw balloons and shit. Totally wack imo...
---
I’m confused on why it’s so hard to merch... I went from 10m to 100m in about two weeks
---
A dunce cap
---
Wild how there was a specific spot to sell everything but nobody taught you it or talked about it, it just happened.
---
Just buy it
---
These are awesome man keep it up.
---
Best way to play, I can do every clue step now and my account is far better of for it
---
Nah im slangin weenie
---
So your not 12hrs+ a day logged in on your acc?
---
And then the 10 year olds
---
I don't have insane gear but can afford a basic 40m gear set. I've done bandos with some people before but solo IDK what I should be doing. 
---
90atk/90str/80def/80range/76mage/70prayer
---
I'll take the one no one wants ;)
---
Hoping I win one
---
Trophies are league rewards.
---
Please jesus
---
Get chest and boots too 0kc and this will be eeeeeeeeeepic collection log
---
The default client might be up your alley. Doesn't come with all of the ezscape features so you will have to actually work and pay attention to get good gains!
---
Seen some ppl have e-sex in w342 a few times
---
I think it's something really great to do when you would normally be doing "nothing" like watching tv, reading, etc. Thats basically the reason I play.
---
I used karambwan at like 80 range. You will be fine
---
Merry Christmas you beautiful bastard! Gl to all who comment
---
I use to host 100m drops every week. Jutt was my banker for years if yah know what i mean. Lithuania ftw.
---
That if people are gonna be kind they'll just do it without any expectations. No one is being kind of they make you jump through a hoop first. If they require something of you it's a scam 100% of the time
---
I did my cape with ACB with blowpipe for all the waves. I recently did it again on task with tbow and it's not really easier, just faster. Range accuracy is also insanely high in the waves, so bandos doesn't do the job as well as justiciars. You're relying on rng so every bit of range defence is huge.
---
Good luck
---
Whats funny is that this is basically FlippingOSRS. He has pretty much mid game stats but has so much money from flipping.
---
Aye hook a fella up
---
But then you get another clue you can't do and the cycle repeats....
---
Cool stuff.  Keep it up
---
just bring a panic tele tab
---
Hope I get one :)
---
Good luck everyone!
---
I won one of these last giveaway, I got the cosmic rune one and it was very nice
---
This is the PINacle of holiday giveaways
---
That’s good to hear everything I’m reading and watching has a full inventory of brews.
---
This time I REALLY hope santa gives you a twisted bow
---
Hmm I never thought of that. I guess because splashing is mostly an AFK xp method.
---
Unfortunately it only takes a few people to make it obsolete in a week
---
I’ll stop all leveling and get 99 agility next if i get that one. Good luck duders
---
I will use your bones on the altar when I’m finished with you.
---
Look at this DUDE
---
merching is a blessing.
---
5 gp ea item, 15k every 4 hours, 30k itemsx5=150k profit overnight (f2p items)
---
10 accs = 1.5m profit overnight.
---
moving to p2p items, 10 accs, 20gp ea item same buy limit = 6m overnight.
---
working with 20+accs is a blessing tho, the only annoying thing is doing romeo and juliet, cooks assistant and another quest on ea acc
---
So half the year was 87 rc right?
---
I watch this every christmas, looks very nice!
---
Zeah library
---
It has nothing to do about being decent, depending on the spawn ranger and mager might hit you at the same time so you might not even be able to avoid a ranger hit. Ancestral DPS bonus against nibblers is almost negligible and is generally only taken for better accuracy on blood barrage when healing. Even inferno speedrunners barrage with arma because of how low nibblers' mage defence is.
---
Fire cape posts arent the problem to begin with. The problem is that this is an almost 20 year old game thats become completely min/maxed, giving everyone the most effecient ways of doing things, and barely any content updates compared to a big triple A studio. The content is lacking in the game, and since players dont have anything different to post we get fire cape posts "daily" because theres nothing else people give a shit about or can even post.
---
But you can lol
---
Coop and stuff
---
Supply and demand, more they supply more the prices go down.
---
Aod in osrs. Oh boy. Or vorago.
---
Shitty vending machine.  Ours is a buck for a 1 liter.  Also drink a real cola.  RC for life.
---
That's the beauty of the market in RuneScape though - it's so huge that there are always more flips to make money from 👌
---
He's being facetious
---
About how the compass isn't aligned with the map/camera?
---
Or a high level player why they don't have a firecape
---
The condescending tone you're throwing here really shows you're missing the sentiment, which is silly 'cause you specifically said it.
---
"At best, a comment on there being two possible states in that limited context." That's the point; that's the sentiment. Obviously the *question* is about odds, the *answer* of 50/50 is so blatantly not a legitimate answer that it should be obvious to you that's what making the comment is referring to, not the actual probability of the drop.
---
So, to reiterate, when you kill a mob/open a chest/etc., you either get the item or you don't. 50/50, baby. Sorry if this upsets you.
---
Kony 2012
---
I’ll wait till the giveaway passes, :P
---
I’m cheeky like that
---
This song and Inside the Fire - Disturbed were used so often
---
Yeah.... flipping. Flipping that card over and typing the security code on the back LOL
---
He linked his Etsy store in a previous comment.
---
I'm not sure if "roleplaying" is the right word for it, but good ol' 342 gets a lot of the weirdos, for sure.
---
I was on a solid winning streak @ the sand casino and sacrificed a rapier on the horror from the deep quest. You get over it real quick.
---
What is the purpose of this for someone who isn't even close to GWD?
---
What world should we go on?
---
owned
---
The account has 70 str and hp, all you need as a tank for gwd
---
Love these also here’s my entry for a pin :)
---
if you are p2p go w378 if not then ill go your world when you log in
---
From the official OSRS/RS merchandise store. Unfortunately, many of these pins/keychains are out of stock and they are not selling them anymore, but there are new ones every so often.
---
At least get piety to get by but yeah rigour is huge if you’re going to brid
---
Lmao what does it have to do with this stuff. r/dankmemes material
---
Also what’s the Etsy account?
---
Epic Id is MDMAYYE I use Xbox
---
I am an reenvant member and i am very disgusted by pedo jay gragastola actions!
---
It's an alt that just tanks the boss whilst the main attacks, used for pet hunting and solo gwd trips
---
for real tho, when i played runescape 10 ish years ago, me and my buddy was both "pve people" and got each our own set of barrows. i got karils and my bro got dharoks. who paid for it? our third friend, who barely did pve and leveled, but spent alot of time on merching and showing of his fashionscape. and yes, he came out of the closed 8 years later.
---
This is why i vote no on PVP polls
---
ZMI runners
---
I spent 10 hours in 24 hours doing revs... I’d rather work 1 hour and buy more gold.
---
The fire rune would be dope &gt;:)
---
They're dope
---
"Bond bought gear" yeah no kidding what other method of making money gets you 5.5m per minute? Lmao
---
My internet is being kinda bad rn hold up
---
True true, but i mean bots shouldnt be in the game...
---
That is actually sickening..... I hope these people get long sentences
---
Try to relog. Fixes it sometimes.
---
check ur pms lad
---
just delete the wilderness at this point all those kids are a cancer
---
Finally a drop party I can participate in! (Btw)
---
Awesome work thanks for doing this!
---
Said above he afks sand crabs at work lol
---
2018 15” MBP here, runs fine. Battery usage is high, but that’s it. 
---
OSRS uses a single core and no gpu for rendering, but that being said asking the decades old java client isn’t going to take well to the native resolution of a MBP. Alternatively you could use an external 1080p display.
---
She was underage and the guy said he slept with her?  Naked in bed?  This is sickening stuff
---
So fast 
---
Ah
---
Go world 301
---
Good luck guys! Cool idea man!
---
why is that like that ?
---
Those are dope dude, do you make these?
---
14 year olds? no wonder jagex doesnt want to hold events involving these people anymore
---
Did you make these yourself? They are wicked
---
OSRStuffs
---
Right? I bought my buddy a bunch of gold bars so he could get his crafting up so he can make his slayer helm, he still tries to pay me back from time to time. I didnt do it to be paid back I did it to help him out.
---
Why this man look like shroud with dreads?
---
but its 67 str
---
Different dicks for different platforms. I prefer Reddit because it supports more long form responses. Usually if someone's argument can be boiled down to 125 characters it's probably a good one. Life's to complex to reduce to a repeatable slogan, it's just as people we are lazy and like simplicity. So to simplify it better I would say that life can be reduced just to yin and yang and If you can't see both, then likely your view is unbalanced as well.
---
Like I get what you mean by easy scape. That's due to post zulrah/ge economy's effects on late game, and the fact that all the rs3 players now play old school. There's a shift on how people think the economy, combat balance, and thoughts on dailys, and removing the polls completely.
---
To an extent you are right about the game, but the game in itself isn't really ours. It belongs to the polls, and the developers at jagex who choose what content they want to make that will get the most twitch viewership, and more reoccurring memberships. So the hype econonmy based off twitch engagement usually only picks up during a new boss/raid release. And people want content that makes getting those stats better so they can go try to get their 1b go drops. People who have those stats already don't want to Increase exp rates/ make them better for obvious reasons. The game is fundamentally different and at this point is at the 2010 scape phase where it starts it's slow decline into obscurity.
---
To the people who are maxed mains who spend consecutive 6+ hours a day playing this is your peak time where you shine getting all the good drops while the prices where at their peak, until the boss economy ruins the experience for anyone new starting out with no room to make profit on lower level Slayer tasks/Skilling, and most of all the old stuff that they'll have to do will be dead content because there will be some Skilling mini game that gives the same Slayer type drops which helped make the economy how it is in the first place. 
---
It's just the half life of a MMO. They're not permanent games. We can look at rs2 and see exactly what happened there. If you've played any private server  that recreates osrs, the economy is often so bad that they have to make new game modes that use a different fresh economy. Some times multiple times. This is because of their excelerated exp rates, extra drop rates and no good bot detection they experience early death a lot faster. We can witness it many times before it happens to the real game.
---
The games not dead. It's just the game is on its way out, and going to resemble something a lot more like rs3 pre invention to more and more people in terms of your ability to progress(less Skilling more loot drops, mini games, ect), and how much money you can make from doing anything that isn't the newest solo boss/raid. 
---
The games just different now, not for any particular bad reason, but not nessisarly good reason. It's just time and yang man. At the end of the game it's just a game, and if a vast majority of people think it should be 2010 scape then maybe it's just not our game anymore. That might be a lot harder for you to come to grips with considering you have a max cape but it's that time.
---
Congrats... but uh ever heard of a screen shot
---

It also has to do with it just being a stupid question in general. People are asking "how rare is exactly 2 ranger boots" which is pretty simple to answer, but there are also thousands of other combinations that are just as rare or more rare that look equally impressive and they would post about. So yes, exactly two ranger boots is one in x, but if you would make a similar post for any 2 of ranger boots, manacles, wizard boots, holy sandals, climbing boots g, etc an occurence like that becomes a lot more common.  
---
Tldr- 2 ranger boots = rare. Any rare combination = not as rare. That's my 2c on why I hate these dumb posts.

To be fair any redditor that uses the default front page of Reddit is absolutely insufferable. I would even go as far as saying as bad as people that use Twitter.

What's your RC to make these pins? They look sick
---
Everything had a specific location to find items or on forums to find them.
---
Right-click message, add friend, filter public to friends. Boom you found em lol.

Wait an hour or more to find a seller? That's exaggerated.

Ahh, I was projecting other people's opinions into your words, whoops lol.

Personally I've learned the difference between 'emotional' and 'rational' feelings, which makes it actually possible to judge things from other people's perspectives (or at least ignoring your own).
---
The thing is low, which this subreddit doesn’t understand, or accept is that melees are zero time activities and doing them efficiently doesn’t involve slayer. Also if you Melee slayer your exp is even worse than 40-50K/hr. Slayer is generally a slower skill to train than runecraft for almost everyone. Plus you’re grinding slayer levels the same way you’re grinding runecraft levels regardless of if you try to hide it behind “oh I want combat exp” in which case why are you slaying and not nmzing when NMZ is less attention, and more melee exp/hr than slayer. Saying you want to train your combat stats so might as well slay isn’t the truth, you’re slaying because you want (x) level if you really wanted to just train combat why would you do an inferior method that requires more attention.
---
Oh I'm incredibly confident with myself. I inherited a mid-seven figure sum at 17, and through learning a detailed understanding of finance, investments and the biotech industry, have turned it into a low eight figure sum. I study at what is commonly viewed as the best university in the world, despite being unable to read until I was twelve. I've climbed Kilimanjaro, the Matterhorn and a few other major mountains. I've worked extensively in charitable foundations giving prosthetics to children.
---
My only point was that I wouldn't RWT my childhood RuneScape account for a few thousand dollars. It would be idiotic to throw away so much time for that little.

Dude, are you playing runescape in real 2007? Any somewhat competent scaper knows that we havent had fun in years and spend time in gilenor to chase the childhood innocence we all miss.

Before I waste time watching this. Is this actually a thing?
---
Ps: lol at you plebs crying about pvp. Ya'll suck at the game anyway lol.
---
If I dont win is there somewhere I can buy them ?
---
I did it in 11 attempts, wouldn’t really call that ages. Zerging mages is also barely viable off task and youre better off just setting up waves like usual. I agree with you that Zuk is way easier with a tbow, but its nowhere near the hardest part about the inferno so it doesnt really matter how easy wave 69 is. If you struggle with triple jads its not dps its cause you cant change prayers accordingly, and a tbow wont do shit for that.

what in the world is in your inventory beside the coins?

Slayer doesn’t offer any more variety than runecrafting if you’re semi efficiently slaying. It’s basically - Barrage Nechs, smokes and dusts, cannon a few quick cannon tasks skip everything else. Hardly any variety. Runecraft has lavas, ZMI, Tiaras, paying runners, Bloods/Souls, and abyss runecraft. I’m not against a RC boss but I’m against it being anywhere competitive to Lavas. If people want a 40K/hr Wintertodt style boss for 50-77 RC sure, whatever.
---
Odds are not as simple as multiplication. Its about knowing the parameters and conditions behind the statistic
---
I believe it is, I always have a great time with the guys on our discord running around in multi—some know what to do and other don’t, but we just joke around and try to kill people. 
---
We tb each other while waiting around, tell someone to log into wrong world and we hide while they try to find us, try to make friends in wildy to join us then backstab
---
It’s honestly whatever you want it to be and I am not a great pker but I find it fun. Sure we’ll all get offed by a larger, better equipped and skilled clan, but then we’ll just talk shit about the clan mate who ran and didn’t fight
---
I got so many pins in their black Friday sale that arrived yesterday. Would totally love another to give my bud

If you can’t ask for upvotes we won’t ask for pins :p
---
You do what the clue tells you to no matter what
---
nice
---
Games still active. Community is well alive and doing better than the main game which if just funny and well as for clans the world isnt exactly used alot but that may change with the big clan update this year.
---
It's a bit weird to go talk to the monkeys you befriended and say you want to murder them all
---
Count me in
---
Thanks guys. Merry Crimbus
---
Yes please would make life so much easier
---
LMFAO My clue almost looks just like this.
---
Nice pins! Good luck everyone!
---
That is only true if you have little money to spend. Think about it this way, if a seed costs 1 gp and gives herbs worth 2 gp, you are making a 100% ROI (return on investment), but only 1 gp per herb, if the seed is 10k and the herb 11k, you are only making a 10% ROI, but 1k per herb, so if you have a certain amount of money, for a certain amount of patches, gp&gt;ROI
---
Like I said this has been suggested before... go read the threads if you wanna see the arguments... I’ll link them if I can

You can install Android on an exploitable model switch, and install OSRS mobile
---
You can only buy 15 herb boxes a day. So have some points buy your 15 and then go do vorkath.
---
Bots are the runescape equivelant of illegal immigrants :/
---
Lame, that was a good enough reason to ask for upvotes. Repeating my message from last post that I’ll definitely buy one even if I don’t win :)
---
70 aint even half of 90 /s
---
If they exaggerate, then the numbers literally do lie..
---
Depends how much I play
---
Botting is wrong for sure, but in my opinion its gotten to the point now where weve had so many bots for such a long time its made the economy what it is. Lets say hypothetically here that we just get rid of all bots permanently all of a sudden, the servers come back up and there are now no more bots and never will be. Every resource, every item that had huge bot farms collecting it is now shooting up in price because the demand is still high from the regular players wanting to buy that item and the supply is low because bots arent collecting and selling it anymore. This would also mean actual players would have to go farm things now. On a members world and want lobsters for something? Too bad no bots or players are catching lobs. 
---
Take a look at the bot nuke day that happened years ago, entire places that were absolutely freaking PACKED with players suddenly had maybe 1 or 2 players there tops. Entire places turned into ghost towns because of the bot nuke. Dont know if this is because there were just so many bots in that one spot, or maybe Jagex was just sloppy or lazy around that time and they built up. The point is bots do have their place in the current game, and if we removed them entirely it would pose a whole new set of mostly unforeseen changes to the games economy.
---
You can only buy 15 boxes/day so, 1 hour will last like 10 days of buying boxes.
---
Sick
---
yeah sure you can tank every single monster in the hardest wave for 30 seconds in armadyl
---
My favorite is going to the desert bandit camp with a blessing on and having permanent aggro with a person to unnote food in the camp (they barely ever hit though). And you can easily line them up to have only one hitting you. 
---
You can go here with Guthans and literally AFK to a 6 hour log. 
---
Only rivaled by Nightmare zone for AFK combat imo
---
Good luck all these are so cool
---
Yes fossils
---
Pintastic
---
I would not complete the clue scroll as I have 27 Runecraft btw.
---
Yes but my question is: Instead of taking the time to do NMZ to get the points, wouldn't it be more efficient to just farm vorkath instead?
---
Great work dude keep it up!
---
I would love one! The voider in the bottom left is goals

Welcome. I left bdo for osrs last year. The clan fights on here give me my bdo node war fix.

There are a lot of toxic neckbearded assholes one runescape. There are also lots of amazing people who are kind and helpful. Dont let the dickheads make you forget about the good guys.

I’m 2094 total but 69 runecrafting exclusively through easy/med/hard diary lamps, ToG, and random events. Everything else 80-85+. I tried doing RC legit once. I lasted 12 minutes.
---
I did some calculations and vork is about 1.8m/hr with bp, zulrah is about 2m/hr assuming u hit uniques. so If I'm looking to get a bcp, it should be around 10 hours of zulrah. is it really that bad to farm bandos in non-max setups ?
---
I guess it depends on how much slower it makes things really. Because like if you can get a “near” max setup for 200M and you’re only like 2-3 minutes/run slower than max gear but you’re still 1-2 minutes faster than Prayer gear id still opt for faster kills and more incoming damage/supplies used than slower kills and less used. Idk there’s really too many hypotheticals to say what would be worth doing and what wouldn’t. I’m not entirely against your proposal it’s just one of those things you wouldn’t really know if it’d be relevant till setups are fleshed out.

Mmm when you right click the wreath, there's an option to "check rank" and then the dialogue appears that shows the rank. I'd like to think that it's still somehow  doable. You can buy it from diego for like 100gp  I think. The tree hugging actions though could me members only though, idunno, i'm f2p. IF you're a member could you check it out from me? You can buy one from diego in Draynor.
---
Drop party in real life . nice
---
yeah but then you get into issues where items like the twisted bow or even full armadyl / bandos are inaccessible to the average noob.
---
it’s hard to make a lot of money in the game if you don’t know how to even start
---
I agree with him, fuck grinding and saving to buy a fury, might as well just pay for a bond and get one
---
Not to discredit PKing but I don't think it's very fun to kill people who don't fight back for minimal loot.
---
:) HP one is best one

Just "i7" doesn't mean much, which one is it? If it's before 6th gen(i7-6XXX)  it's probably pretty bad

They exaggerate because they assume everyone else is retarded. It's a pretty common behavior with narcissists.

If you just run the numbers on what their botfarms are making, you'll see it's an insane amount of money. If you're not able to, SirPugger usually does this in his videos.

Definitely looks like a deep fake to fuck with ROT.   They’d never waste Chris’ time with something that isn’t open and shut and without very strong evidence.  Someone obviously spied a bit and overheard this conversation.  Not surprising these type of PVP clans do this kind of shit to each other.   This is them in their Christmas spirit I guess.  
---
Still kind of disgusting but at least most of the dudes in the chat sound uncomfortable talking about an underage girls’ nude pics.
---
Comment. Comment? Comment =].
---
Ive also been conflicted on this. Its an easy 200k a day but it still takes out a good chunk of time to get that 200k points, and you only get fast points with the DT bosses (which we all know is shit to deal with).
---
I actually stopped doing my daily NMZ runs out of pure laziness. I spend that time bossing and stuff, overall ive made more. That doesnt mean its not worth it to do your NMZ, it totally is. But if you hate NMZ like I do then yah
