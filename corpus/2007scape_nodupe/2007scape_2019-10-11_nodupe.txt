Yes, any untradables with you are kept without being broken and they don't count for the 3 items kept. The only exceptions are Ring of Charos, Lunar staff and Chronicle, which are all destroyed if they're not one of the three items.
---

---
It doesn't matter a whole lot since your items are on the ground for an hour, so you have plenty of time to get back to it and loot it regardless of where you died. Except if you die on an instance, then items dropped are lost, but you keep everything on you (including untradables)

I was reading out loud in like 6th grade and I pronounced formaldehyde as formal d'hide because I'd never seen that word before but immediately thought of RuneScape haha this was like 04-05.
---
It‚Äôs nothing you have done. 
---
It‚Äôs a random and annoying ongoing issue.

but won't he just attack me with his ranged attack if he's snared?

Now I gotta weigh starting over vs going back to classic

Mordaut, Nieve, Kree'arra, Zilyana, Konar

cuba has internet lmao
---
Graduate job? Near about average where I am. But I live on my own, I don't have a second income, I don't live off my parents. To be honest I'm not surprised that there would be people in the RuneScape community that would render it unfathomable to actually pay their way in life, as they grind osrs all day and have their mom put frozen pizzas in the oven for them. It may have been two years but I certainly remember and don't miss the sweaty nerds.
---
Ah okay cheers!
---
Monkey from MM2 feels left out :(
---
way back in the day they release capes for how long youve been in game and my account was created in 04 so i have... duhn duhn dunnnn the 15 year cape ive log over 420 days ingame
---
You are the true bwana.
---
i think meta is to reroll until you get one xD
---
You still need to run to altar with magic imbue mate.
---
VOSRS, osrs on release (with making con work, fixing launch bugs etc.)
---
Whenever I talk about OSRS to friends and such I just describe it as an advanced version of Cookie Clicker
---
Drop a pet rock too
---
Ah I wasnt aware of that, thanks!
---
I might start classic lol
---
There's a skip option for content they're not familiar with. Their opinion on early game content is just as valuable as any veteran.
---
Can I? I didn‚Äôt see an option and just thought it was a flat perma ban.
---
There is an equipment tab as well under the attack skill guide, where they really should be located.
---
I liked the idea of warding and the rewards were good but I still voted no. Runecrafting is the most hated skill in the game and fills the void warding would've. 
---
None of my friends voted yes for the same reason. None of them are maxed. 
---
The community is toxic because we can't voice our opinion if you're a minority. You're either a neck beard or a brainlet who hasn't read the blog.
---
Do some low end quest. Most of the free to play ones you can do with combat stats in the high 20s low 30s
---
more wilderness bosses
---
OSRS players love passing things that are bad for the game too.
---
The general population doesn't care about the game's health. They'll just pass any content that makes skilling easier, reject anything that might devalue their current gear, and fucking decimate anything that might benefit someone that likes PvP.
---
I got a key yesterday but haven‚Äôt gotten around to using it. It‚Äôs my first one and I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre even for besides unlocking his chest in 50 wild? 
---
And then you sprint for your life to 30 and tele?
---
Goliath Gloves confirmed
---
Yes get 99/99/99/99/99/99 and go to deep wild
---
I‚Äôm not paying for those
---
It‚Äôs a solid game for sure, I just got a new job so now it‚Äôs stopped me from being able to play at the same time as my friends. Which is why I tried to log in today to OSRS
---
You need to have at least 100 tokens to get in is what he meant, it doesn‚Äôt take them on entry.
---
So sad that range already has a ton of content. This is such a cool looking concept. I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing it in game.
---
Fuck that butt burgler tim allen cock muncher
---
Your range and mage levels are good. Pretty sure you use blow pipe and trident at zulrah
---
One of your pets is beating the shit out of you
---
Nieve and any of her sisters/cousins, Konar, Anyone from lunar isle, Any elven girl, queen Ellamaria, Vyrewatch, Zilyana, ect. Also why didn't anyone draw Nieve getting gangbanged by gnomes yet?

If you have 40 Prayer you can protect from range to take 0 damage

I played runescape because my computer was too shit to run WoW.
---
I finally got a PC upgrade with WoW BC when it first came out in like 2006 and honestly, I enjoyed wow, but when my subscription ran out I just chose not to renew it, and went back to Runescape instead. I was simply more hooked on Runescape.
---
2006 to me was the absolute peak of my fun on RS, as in 2006 I was still pretty new, and still had a lot to learn and new places to see. 2007 was still great up until trade/wildy removal but like any MMO I just found it less fun as I neared end game content. 
---
Being a noob is the best thing when playing an MMO, once you actually know what you're doing that's when it starts to suck.
---
Hmm not sure how to feel about this...
---
Ohhh okay yea, do all defenders have the same drop chance?
---
All apart from the dragon.
---
Draynor has a fire right next to the bank. It‚Äôs a fireplace.

u get muted for anything in wow, got a 24 hour ban for having the name 'peepee'

You can't even have pets out while your doing con
---
Good stuff. Not quite as cool as buddy kits though

I regret asking.
---
Lesser demon butler

Oh alrighty, thank you

I too remember when all the WoW classic players voted in the T bow and blowpipe. Fuck those guys.
---
your genius is showing
---
I've never heard of that happening.  Weird.
---
The display settings are really getting to me
---
Not lewd enough
---
It kind of sucks getting the pet too early tbh. You lose motivation to do the fight caves for Slayer Even though it's a lot of exp.
---
A small yard sale will do the trick.
---
Hardly, once you get 70+ xp rates are fairly decent, especially if you‚Äôve got a cannon or burst task. you do you if you wanna tears slayer but it‚Äôs a huge waste IMO, you‚Äôre better off leaving it for RC, Con or herb.
---
Any restrictions? Pures only? Mains only?
---
Aww. I‚Äôm assuming it would‚Äôve made more sense to you if the imagines swapped places
---
it has ape apparently then. Can't wait to give spades to my jungle friends.

huh TIL.

Isn't run3cape also owned by Chinese state enterprise?

I didn't but 25b lmao. Not all at once anyeay. I bought 1b and turned it into 25b. And I bought it in bonds. Not rwt. You have no clue what ur talking about you have no experience with addiction. And no I wouldn't rent a account. That's way to much effort for me.
---
Yes bro I understand and feel your pain. I was 1820 total when I went so thats base 70-80s with a quest point cape. You can do it bro. Take a break if you need to but you‚Äôll always have something to come back to. The break helped me.
---
On 2 accounts I used less than 1k tokens to get dragon defender from no defender. I think you're just a bit unlucky.

2 weeks without logging in and the offer is removed from the GE despite still showing as active in your trade list.

Try barrows with fire wave, tome of fire and damage boosting gear if you can afford.

Ah shit I misread the wiki. I'll update it.
---
You get right on that and let us know how you fare.
---
Trade chat in classic is actually used for trading generally in my experience.
---
Yeah I just wanted to provide a bit of a disclaimer since we generally don't do that and take all of this stuff at face value and blow it up larger for entertainment value. Frontline losers have also literally tried to hack my friends in and out of game so I do want people to at least think critically about the motivations and integrity of the people they are taking at face value. Not saying you do, but a lot of people on reddit take the entertainment circle jerk at face value without recognizing a lot of it is played up for fun. I think it's hilarious that RoT got their wish to be some sort of unkillable super villain in the community but it makes me shake my head that some people actually believe it all.
---
Its crazy that jagex were actually returning gold like that. The scale of hacking is not particularly uncommon and you don't even need anyone inside the company to abuse their recovery system. There are so many script kiddies recovering accounts with ease due to understanding the simple flaws and what information is utilized in recovery appeals. I'm also a little critical about Jed being behind everything when I heard whispers long before people were even realizing Jed was RoT of people in the account recovery department (which makes a lot more sense for abuse than Jed) using their position to work with their friends to appeal accounts and sell the gold. I genuinely would not be surprised with the lack of organization and structure within their company that they acted reactively based on rumour and got the wrong guy.

Are mantas my best food option for vorkath on a normie account

Dude we get along perfectly well, she just nags  it‚Äôs one of her many qualities lol. She knows she does it, tries to not over do it and makes up for it in other ways.
---
Kill everyone, especially the people in total level worlds who think they're safe.

Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

Dagganoth Queen drop?
---
You can only solo zulrah
---
Epic has a single majority shareholder though as well and China can't do anything to them because of that. Companies that are much more spread out are more likely to cave to investors and while 5% or 10% seems small it can be billions depending on the company. But yes I agree these companies need to realize they should pay the price for sipping the Chinese green blood rather than cave, but these people care more about affording a 4th yacht than free speech.
---
So it sounds like the losers in this situation are the criminals in Hong Kong?
---
The relative price increase from bringing manta rays is about 400 coins per inv slot, which multiplied by 20 is only 8000 coins.
---
Mantas provide 10% more healing than sharks, so the way I see it is that they extend trips/capacity for mistakes by 10%.
---
A single superior dragon bone is worth over 12k, and the average vorkath kill is worth at least 30k (idk exact numbers but that sounds about right. So if manta rays allow you to kill an extra vorkath per trip they increase your revenue by at least 4 times the cost increased imposed by their use.
---
Absolutely worth using imo.
---
It was to encourage people to vote for warding. Really lame.
---
That's what happens when everyone focuses on hyper-efficiency &amp; amassing wealth, instead of just enjoying a chill game.
---
WC used to be relaxed social activity that turned a decent profit - now it's considered a waste of time, so a lot of people just use tick manipulation and drop the logs to speed it up.
---
Doesn't help that slayer monsters shit out alchables, equipment, and more raw materials than can be acquired by skilling.

What can we be happy about? We‚Äôve gotten almost nothing to look forward to. Nothing ever passes and if it does it‚Äôs something to benefit pvmers.
---
I could probably grind towards being able to use that kitchen but unfortunately those gauntlets mean doing a quest I don't have close to the skill requirements(Im a level 60 with most my stats being 30s or 40s)
---
Wasting the time of people who scam millions of dollars yearly from the vunerable is a morally just cause.
---
I'd love to see you get a BCP in an hour with 0 skill requirements without paying for a carry
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bother, people don‚Äôt seem to understand that exposing things both drive people to them and also make it easier to crack down on
---
They are not weapons.
---
To compare the games is questionable, they are two different kind of MMOs. No WoW player would ever stay on OSRS for much longer than a few months. Ive seen three of my guilds throughout the years attempt osrs but laugh at its "boringness". Fuck em im maxed.
---
Have you done the wall beast fingers yet?
---
That‚Äôs just the way polls work, always and forever. There will always be an uneducated voter, somewhere. There may even be many uneducated voters. That‚Äôs a different topic though. Voter suppression and suppressing the games growth to maintain a status quo is pretty questionable behavior for a game that you love lol. 
---
Also, it‚Äôs not out of touch, you specifically chose to play OSRS knowing that it was based on polls, it‚Äôs out of touch for you to then want to rig the system by discouraging others from migrating to the game in order to benefit selfishly. If the the game gets to a point where it‚Äôs a worse enough experience, you will leave and find a new game, which happens all the time, it‚Äôs nothing new. It‚Äôs just a game at the end of the day, easily replaceable. I‚Äôd rather as many people get to enjoy it like I have over the decade than horde it for myself in my mid 20s lol.
---
This is what I always say to people who bitch about having to do stuff in the wilderness.  It's definitely debatable whether it's good or bad to be forced out there for stuff like clues and such, but for now it is what it is (and always has been), and if you're dying with any regularity it's your own damn fault.  Just keep your finger on the log out button and be ready to run to mobs/terrain/whatever is nearby to get away.  If you're prepared, there's almost no reason to die unless you're attacked by a pretty damn good and geared pker.  
---
Actually I did die last night while doing a clue, for like the first time in 2019.  And it was totally my own fault.  It was up in Anakarl or whatever, the multi area with demons by the fence, AKA one of the worst places to try to escape from.  And the only reason I died was because it was like 3am on a Wednesday night, so I wasn't even paying any attention since I figured the odds of running into anyone up there was basically zero.  But of course, there he was when least expected.
---
Not saying that at all, they are both VERY VERY different games. I'd argue completely different genres
---

this is called task extension and it already exists. it doesn't change the weight technically but it does raise the proportion of the time you do a certain task, so the same goal is achieved

slayer does not need any exp/h buffs for the foreseeable future.
---
She‚Äôs a brick H√ÑUUUS

I love doing these puzzles
---
Yep, it's hard to explain to people who don't PvP and it seems a lot of the Pkers still around don't mind using such bullshit tactics. The player base willing to actually PK is going to dwindle more and more.  Sad really.  I use to love DH pking but in the past few years the majority of the people left are abusing plugins constantly.
---
I've been playing Runescape off-and-on for 15 years. I've NEVER "maxed" an account fully. I have an account on 2007scape which is max combat and has like 11 total 99's, but I've never been fully maxed in all skills. It could take me another year or two to finish that account of normal, casual play.
---
Because sweaty tryhards only want endgame and PvP content, it would've been the first new skill added to F2P in over a *Decade*
---
Actually, 'everyone' isn't disagreeing with me. You really aren't good with backing up your opinions aren't you? 77% of people agreed with this thread.
---
You can barb &lt;&gt;&lt; first to skip the slow courses.
---
A lot of the QoL changes do exactly that, stuff like left click Bank-All, Make-All interface, etc.

Yes what i do is i place a spare key cap on top of the key i want pressed then put my phone ontop of my keyboard and that is ebough weight to weigh it down without getting it al sticky

Can I do this at 79 mage with the cheaper trident?

You will be. Give it time.
---
Appreciate it bro thank you. Struggling hard atm.
---
USA USA USA!
---
thought having clients do shit like key presses for you was a bannable offense now?
---
While that may be true, hexhunter was endgame rs2 dungeoneering content that a lot of people didn't experience, or if they did, it was forgotten.
---
&gt; Obviously? Why would casual gamers harrass the devs over improvements?
---
Casual players harass the game devs over balancing changes all the time, Vorkath buff, Konar nerf, Zulrah &amp; Void nerf, ToB and Inferno being difficult, Basilisk Knight nerf, Rev caves in general, Dinh's nerf, etc.
---
What kind of ranking do you want? Like most gp yoinked and most kills? Why would pvp only gear make you more likely to pvp? There is hear right now, how does limiting it to pvp improve it? Isn't LMS a pvp mini game? Or more like castle wars?
---
And I dont care about you hunting pvmers, I'm trying to understand what you feel you don't have now that you feel will fix pvp. Or at least get to what you think is broken. Is the current gear too good? Too bad? How would pvp only gear differ? How does the ranking system help? Just the number go up and get big mentality the rest of the game is based on? I could see the advantage of a ranking, but I don't imagine it would get more people in to the wild or pvp worlds.

King Roald doesn‚Äôt look like Winnie the Pooh at all

Get a minimum wage job. Pretend you want to work there for 3 years. Quit after first paycheck.

But their comparison was fine? They listed popular methods as a comparison. Just because you don't use them or think they are good doesn't really change the comparison at all.
---
Jmods definitely know balance better than the players, but players are the ones who don't want their achievements undermined, which is fair but far from actually concerning balance at all.
---
People from wow are not a downside to the game at all, that is an extremely ignorant take, there is no scenario is which new players are bad for the game. If new players join and affect the polls then that is what the new collective community ends up wanting, it doesn't matter what the hold outs want at that point. WoW players are also very well aware of how balance works in games, much more than OSRS players do.
---
that worked a lot better thank you! :P
---
Hands down the worst update in history, even MTX or EOC wasn't as hated

How are the Chinese people supposed to know any different?
---
Recently did just that. Highly recommend

It passed go try it out while the scrolls are still cheap
---
What‚Äôs rti
---
Oh now i see it! Lol still really cool
---
The only way to introduce a bow like the twisted bow is through complicated explanations though because it is a complicated weapon.  There were definitely at least 30% of people who saw the twisted bow and either saw Woox's video OR remembered it from RS3 or found out what it did on their own. Yet it still got voted in /shrug
---
Just get hp to 1, pray flick rapid heal every 45 secs and use absorption potions and you're all good..
---
99 cooking!!! WOAH-HO. You should def get 99 fletching too, broooo.
---
what a preschool argument
---
&gt; Jmods definitely know balance better than the players
---
That's not very true. Do we remember late 2012?
---
&gt;If new players join and affect the polls then that is what the new collective community ends up wanting, it doesn't matter what the hold outs want at that point
---
Yes, I know. Thank you for reiterating my point...

Other than that you‚Äôre in good gear

Gg could of been at bandos got tassets bcp then pet.
---
Yes...god that would take forever! But at the same time, its incredible how much overlap there is between playing rs and playing d&amp;d in geilinor. It really makes for a great quasi-home-brewed game.
---
Yeah but those are dwarfs, its lore-friendly so that's fine.
---
Ha! Right on. Please share with us if you do any other areas like this!
---
&gt; or that mythic raiders are getting outdpsed by a guy with a world quest weapon.

the biggest tell, for sure.

don't get me wrong, i am unhappy with retail, thats why im here. but the classic/private server shills are insufferable.
---
Have them publicly say "fuck China" and I'll make my first ever Runescape account.
---
Didnt cover up your spellbook. GG account
---
What part of it? 
---
Hexhunter bow was a 98 ranged, 99 slayer bow from dungeoneering. Very few players had experience using it.
---
did they say anything about the diaries? you can only do the easy without needing shit from outside of zeah unless they change the diaries
---
Sure while we are doing mobile only can we do Ironman only and 2277 worlds too? I would also petition that irons not to be allowed to use chat, as they stand alone.
---
I want this even though I'm an ironmeme btw
---
That‚Äôs shredded cheese.
---
I maxed in rs3 sub 500 hours fresh
---
Yet people still knew what it did and how OP it was whether from videos of it or from seeing someone use it in a dungeon alongside them and you didn't need 99 slayer to use it you needed 99 slayer to kill the mob which meant someone else could loot it.
---
Gonna need a source on this argument though, pretty sure you just made it up.
---
It‚Äôs profitable to train even in its most effective methods. You don‚Äôt spend money on xp when training it effectively like any of the other skills typically considered buyables.
---
Is the blocklist for wild a different one?

Oh awesome! When I did Clock Tower a few months ago, it was the first time I'd seen US floor conventions on the wiki, and I'm from the US. I was used to seeing UK conventions and then this one seriously threw me off, lol. Glad to hear about this change!
---
You can max a full combat spec in rs3 in a couple weeks from a fresh account if you have a bit of gold to dump into gear in advance
---

Yeah stacking out 90hp+ with a Recoil kills you instantly.

Noooooooo he was my favorite mod!!! I‚Äôm ultra sad panda :(

Do you know roughly how much it cost you to 99?

it's pretty much equally as obnoxious as all the people who humor the "lol 69" and "lol 420" posts

You would keep all untradeables and your 3 most valuable tradeables. I don't know what you would have been wearing to have lost a suffering. Dragon defender should have been kept.
---
You shouldn't have kept all your essence though.. unless perhaps the pouches empty themselves on death like the rune pouch does and you didn't actually have a full inventory?
---
Really all you should have been wearing that dropped on the ground would have been a cheap amulet, likely glory, your ammo slot, and that's it.
---
Battlestaff, shield slot, suffering should have been your 3 kept items. Unless you were skulled.
---
You are awesome. I would love to get into D&amp;D this way
---
‚ÄúLured‚Äù 
---
You got greedy and thought you were better. 
---
You got played and now complain on reddit for everyone to pretty much just laugh at you.
---
Defenders need a ornament now to make that an option.
---
Nah, I'd rather just re-poll warding
---
1. Wear bulwark and black d'hide (Serp helm is also preferable; it has high defense and provides venom immunity).
---
2. Pray melee and don't change it. You don't need to worry about switching it, having it active constantly will prevent 99% of KO attempts, and a bulwark with an inventory of brews (with a couple pieces of combo food) is more than enough to outlast anyone. Once you're more confident, pray mage when running away to shorten the amount of time you're frozen.
---
3. As long as you heal properly, you are now immortal as far as tanking one person goes. No single PKer can kill you, not even if you stand still with a full 5-minute TB timer. You still have to worry about clans, but even then you have a chance of surviving.
---
People in bulwarks only die from clans *or trying to outsmart PKers by switching their prayers around, which in reality only gives the PKers a KO opportunity*.
---
But yes, when doing clues, I do the same thing (bring only 3-4 items), and I've never been killed doing it anyway. It's pretty dead out there. It also has the advantage of letting you teleport back to a bank through suicide past 30 wilderness. The only time you need to bring more than 3 items is for master clues, and then there's always clue boxes.
---
Only if you're high combat and have gear to quickly kill dragons. Otherwise leave em locked for now.

I was using the mystic staff and using fire wave and it was decent damage.
---
I was at work and opened my phone to some messages from the girlfriend. I forgot to flip the laundry over, she was not pleased. To make matters worse I left my RuneScape Wiki tabs open on my laptop, giving her ammunition
---
It's amazing but I must ask. Where's the turnstile for the farm?
---
Yeah, well, Jagex security being a joke isn't exactly surprising news
---
Right?? Like 1k a pop. I was on my way to a Dragon Dagger as fast as I could get there.
---
Id be a worthwhile update. Only shortbow that can fire dragon arrows is 3rd age bow. A cosmetic item is a bis.... let that sink in. Make this a level 65 range short bow on par with 3rd age, allow to shoot dragon arrows. Id buy it
---
Not sure if you actually paid attention or read up on that at all, but the guy made an account specifically to post spam posts, it wasn't like it was an actual player banned for saying hong kong. It was a troll making spam posts constantly
---
I legit don't think the dude ever done slayer
---
And that is why skilling can't be profitable, because it'll be botted to shit and all the resources are instead tacked on to boss drops.
---
It actually used to be very possible to recover an account with 0 personal info, just by knowing the username (not sure if this still works). This usually only applied to REALLY, REALLY old accounts. Huge lists of usernames to recover used to go 'round where you could attempt to recover them. All you had to do was put random info and say you moved house, if it didn't work, retry but with slightly different info. No idea how this worked, I assume because the accounts were so old they never had recoveries or anything like that.
---
I got the core, gloves and ring in 230kc all I want is pet. Can only hope my rng will continue to run strong lol
---
If I were you I would be thinking about the fact that you‚Äôre really close to having a quest cape which is a great utility for the closest tele to a fairy ring (other than having one in your house, which I assume you don‚Äôt have). Might as well just finish up!
---
They just have to make the add on rarer. Seerculls will sit at alch value while the attachment will drive the price of the new item. Like rangers and pegsidians
---
Being able to sit at the ge around a fire with a bunch of homies.
---
That is still a huge undertaking as a main. He probably made profit from the clues, but the time it would take to do that + he did around 1/4 of them before they were from eclectics.
---
Yes
---
I have a fairy ring in my house, so I really don't care about the quest cape much
---
One of those "eventually I'm sure I'll get it but whatever tbh" type of goals
---
legit, doing this on a main with runelite is just following a set of step by step set of instructions.
---
That'll definitely make it a bit easier, especially if you can grab some rune armour/kite.
---
q
---
whats the point of the streak then, just to show off?
---
This is awesome. I would love to play some DnD in a Gielinor setting
---
You're almost half way to 99. 
---
üòú
---
Yesn't
---
"How to level up on wood hopping when you're already the best". I hope for your sake this wasn't a sexual innuendo.
---
Yea and this is why it‚Äôs flawed but by in large they would need to expose a lot of info
---
Weast, when you really aren‚Äôt sure where your doing.
---
damn im surprised that someone still knows about adventurequest worlds
---
I almost always run out of other shit that I've brought first before I run out of sharks though. Seeing as food is never the issue, I decided to bring the cheaper, almost as good option (sharks)
---
Ty!
---
Patrick?
---
Looks more like you tbh
---
 I think they might've changed it, in [this other post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d3zmzw/bulletproof_account_recovery_request_was/) I talk about my frustrations trying to recover a really old account, even with accurate information. The account was sufficiently old too, from 2006.
---
Wont that inhibit my exp gain?
---
Yes, 200k/hr is pretty shit for the stats needed to finish this quest.
---
Feel free to discuss end game content, it doesn't matter in a discussion about bad mid level content that has been horribly balanced.
---
Either basilisks should be easy to kill and under 300k/hr with low drop rates on the jaw, or hard to kill with a better normal loot table.
---
As of now they are a completely useless unlock for anyone who barely has the requirements for the quest, unlike the vast majority of content that is appropriately rewarded to players for completing similarly difficult quests.
---
People wearing the armour have told me no that it only uses charges when damaged
---
Oh no I meant won‚Äòt smithing bronze will give me less exp
---
Actually wut? Farmimg is perhaps the fastest skill to train if you consider xp rates in game time, not real time. Just do a daily tree run and you hit lvl 80 without even noticing.
---
It's a shame because I used to watch them and actually started following a few streamers I didnt before as i seen their clips regularly so its essentially advertisement for them. However as someone rightly pointed out they where profiting irl off other peoples content so, I imagine it was the larger streamers that already have a following that had a problem with it rather than the smaller ones
---
This is so cool . Did you use a program to create it ?
---
I play both and they really aren't very similar
---
If you think this it‚Äôs probably because you use autoclickers.
---
Spend a couple hours at BA for Torso and upgrade to a Glory/Fury. Both will be great upgrades!
---
In that case you may as well do it because your focus isn't ehp, you will take a hit to your xp rates but you will still gain hunter levels and get herbs. Dont forget your magic secatuers!
---
Tentacle whip hode up

I spent 100m splashing fire wave to 99 for thievinghost cc. But thanks
---
Every member of the chinese dictatorship needs to be indiscriminately murdered like they have done to every person who has opposed them in any way
---
Played rs for 4 months. Nothing is worth anything and boys everywhere. I don't get the point to play this game.
---
Yeah, it's a new twist on the game and gives me and my friends a reason to get back into rs and play together.
---
macOS Catalina has been released! Could anyone who has been experiencing the freeze issue and updated to Catalina please report in on the status of the problem?
---
It's a question not a rant, sit kid
---
Remindme! 1 week

you're trying too hard
---
What is that?
---
Number 7 for your fifa giveaway. I play rs too, dont use secondary clients mate
---
Jagex doesn't have a solution to the botting problem, its pretty much just deal with it at this point.
---
If you can't solo bandos without max combat then idk what to say.
---
You can use key remapping in runelite
---
Two of my favorite games
---
You inspired me to do my beginner clue scroll. Unfortunately it was worth 230 gp.
---
Thank you Dooshbaggin, who would have thought that you do what the mods of a cc tell you not to do you get kicked...
---
* shocked pikachu meme here *
---
Logged to say lol me too man.
---
I'm guessing he meleed since he soloed, so he probably used barrows to start
---
Lesser demons is a decent task. You don't know true hell until you get steel dragons.
---
Im learning zulrah and one run we killed eachother. I closed my eyes and alt f4d so i couldnt see the drops.
---
Nah, HLC and their alts decided we shouldn't get new stuff because muh achievements.
---
Get her a job at jamflex
---
Should definitely add black demons to the block list along with hellhounds.
---
It's not that I think this is bait to get someone banned, but Jagex will look at IPs and see where the money is flowing to. If not a red flag for an account being compromised, it can potentially be flagged as possible RWT.
---
bruh
---
And mid-level players who lie about their accounts. Kinda like how everyone on the Overwatch sub is grandmaster ranked.
---
yes
---
lots of people will say using justiciar isn't worth it full stop, but it's up to you. one of the cheaper sets of equipment you can get so may as well try it out
---
He is. Obviously, he doesn't *really* care about the game. He has found a way to get many views on his videos, so why not make the videos? People praise him for shedding light on these issues, but honestly, he doesn't bother to fact check simple things that could easily be verified, and many of the people he has had interviews with are outright lying.
---
Tldr how does 2fa make your account less secure
---
The people who know how to hack any account isnt going to hack some random account on reddit for 10m, are you a fucking moron?
---
poke
---
Love this! Definitely going to session the whole series over the weekend
---
This looks a lot like Gwent: Thronebreaker. Love the art style.
---
Yeah, I just hit 70 slayer yesterday so I'm closing in on the first actually good slayer mob, it's just still gonna take so long to actually get there. I just always get garbo tasks like hellhounds and greater demons and suqahs and fire giants. I got a dust devils task once and that was actually fun, I just can't ever seem to get it again so I just have to slog through all this boring nonsense that don't drop anything :/
---
Hell I'd even take a basilisk task at this point, the knights take me forever to kill but it's better than hellhounds and fire giants lmao
---
I don't get how this proves any point, why would you ask someone to hack your account that isn't secure?
---
Jagex's whole position is that you need to secure your account (i.e. authenticator, bank pin) so how does not doing the things they tell you to do to secure your account prove anything?
---
It doesn't abcq02 had an extended argument with me a long time ago where he insisted that by putting 2fa your account would some how become magically less secure. It was so stupid I had to immortalize it forever.
---
I was about to make a joke about sodium but na you wouldn't get it.
---
I'm curious about your tag, are you saying 2fa makes the account less secure?
---
Nice try jmod
---
Ngl, I‚Äôd play the shit out of this.
---
12 potatoes gg account
---
I guess the challenge, from a tech perspective, is to either find unencrypted packets leading to or from the OP's account or gather enough information from data breaches to follow a trail of breadcrumbs back to OP's account, usually from trying the same email address and password.
---
If it's a small one, you usually can slap them with magic relatively easily. Shit task for sure, but can easily bite the bullet and get through it.
---
Also cheesing quests on gimmick accounts
---
(eg. killing the demon from family crest on a skiller)
---
And yet I‚Äôm 3k try of a whip
---
For 10m no one even remotely good will try.
---
Lolol nice
---
Runescape is owned by Tencent for a much larger percentage than Blizzard, therefor being much more of a chinese company, just not in the news.
---
wear whatever you want bruh
---
Not going for the hammer?
---
I locked down puro puro last year with 4 pking accounts when I tried to get d darts on my iron man. Eventually the venezuleans started recognizing me in the pvp worlds and would try to bargain with me in shitty english
---
I've done it.  Good fun.
---
I was the guy in the black character earlier today lmao, STFU though.
---
Not everyone who has been hacked fell for a phishing stream...
---
Sometimes dataleaks happen, i got my info leaked by fucking Adobe back in 2013 due to a breach. They didnt notify me of that. I didnt get hacked in RS because of that, just saying that plenty of other breaches happen, and that can lead to your account being compromised, as your personal info is leaked. 
---
You \*can\* avoid these things by using a sole email for your runescape account, and nothing else, but i truly doubt most people do that, and they really shouldnt have to. 
---
2fa works really well, so long as it cant be immediately be disabled with zero notification, it seems like a pretty obvious thing to change, and i dont see why anyone would be against it. Even if you were to give up your password to someone, it really wouldnt help them, so long as 2fa works as intended.
---
Nailed it lmao
---
I think it would be best if you keep neighboring towns, so that it would be a single flowing map. There's lots of empty space between towns, which would make drawing flawing imagery harder as it gets large quickly, so if I were in your shoes I'd first create a detail scares modified world map to reduce on the green belts, then use that world map as a guide to keep on adding neighboring towns, I think in your instance the west/east line is easier to start with, but give east is dessert, I'd go west, first do Draynor village, then port sarim. Given how stupid large Draynor mansion is, by not recreating immediately, it will give you room to down size it and have more room to play with Falador and Varrock
---
No it proves that the people who get hacked are giving out their information or in some other way giving others the information they need to steal the account.
---
Runescape is essentially just a d10000 dice simulator.
---
It depends on your economy, but i would recommend proselyte chest/legs and whip/defender. Pray melee and piety with pray pots in inv. Bring super att+str and not super combat to save money.
---
But that issue is that it already is in the limelight, with people constantly telling Jagex to sideline any content updates because security needs to be worked on right away.
---
The point of this post is to show that even with the most minimal of security on your account, being keeping your password and your email hidden, your account is safe. If people want to keep saying that this is a major concern, they need to prove that it is something that can actually happen, or they need to rethink their opinions on Jagex's security. 
---
One of the biggest criticism is that the recovery system can be used to steal basically any account. Well, I have given the community an account to recover. Anyone can file a recovery request, so why hasn't anyone gotten in yet? This whole thing feels like people hearing about friends of friends of friends of friends being hacked, and then they start rioting about it, and it all snowballs into so much bigger of an issue than it actually is
---
Even though I play alone a lot I think it'd feel so lonely that it would ruin the game for me. Private servers would be the way forward if the game died.
---
I remember being so happy about getting my first full set of adamant plate armor. Was such an achievement.
---
That's a good idea. Instead of having daily spells you have runes as a resource and could find/buy them
---
It‚Äôs all about the fun haha. I trained to level 60 attack on the varrock guards so I could weild my dragon dagger. My god the spec was beautiful the first time I used it.
---
Looking at starting this grind on my Ironman since I got odium shard 2 the other day, any tips you could give me?
---
A lot of the warding content should be polled on its own. Like making the robes logical so f2ps don't have to wear zammy bottom and wizard top, and mystic being 60% of the magic gear used.
---
They didn't do it for Classic, they're super unlikely to do it for OSRS.
---
My absolute favorite memory of RuneScape was within my first few months of playing I was mining coal for my brother well he mined mithirl then smithed mith longs and sold them to varrock shop (hoping for max profit) Anyways I was selling swords for my brother well he was in the bathroom or some shit  and I missclicked 50 and lost a lot of money (aka 20k or something) He was furious and I ran away and cried lmao, the next morning I'm at lumby general store and I see a guy is getting attacked by an evil chicken! Hes about to die I'm ready, heart pounding and I get his cash stack its 90k!! I'm fucking screaming I run upstairs to my brothers room hes still asleep I'm telling him what happend and he keeps saying you mean 9k not 90k, long story short I paid him back and bought a rune kite :)
---
Should put authenticator on it, and post the email + password of the account(not the email), should still be impossible to get in and would be "more" impressive that way.

If it needs an attack lvl over 70 and rolls the damage of your str its fine.

Small steps, small goals. OSRS is a game that takes a while to progress in. Questing is a big part of the game and I would say go for QPC early on (it will be slower but much more enjoyable to do quests without guides)
---
Runecrafting is generally hated as a skill in the community but it is very profitable. at lvl 27 you can do cosmic runes, and at lvl 44 you can do nature runes which are very profitable. Look up abyss rcing guide.
---
Early game is very fun since progress is relatively fast, as soon as it starts to slow down you will know you are finished with the early game.
---
A lot of people find Slayer quite fun but I would suggest you wait until your stats are a bit higher before you start training it or it will be very very slow.
---
There are countless ways of playing OSRS. Maybe you enjoy the PVP aspect, skilling aspect or PVM aspect. I consider myself to be a skiller but most people enjoy PVMing. It is by far the most profitable activity.
---
 [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adS-f5ABTJI&amp;t=1s) will help you to get familiar with the basics and how certain  mechanics work but I also suggest to explore this world by yourself first and if you get stuck go back to guides/videos.
---
Last but not LEAST its the ironman mode. Some people claim that this is the best way to enjoy OSRS since all resources/gear are earned by you. It limits your trading abilites with other players so you have to grind everything by yourself. Its definetly slower to reach endgame/max but i tend to enjoy playing it as an iron skiller. My advice would be to familiarize yourself with the game a bit first, learn the catches, locations, skilling methods before attempting to play this game mode. There are 3 ironman gamemodes:  
---
\- Standard ironman
---
\- Hardcore ironman (you get 1 life)
---
\- Ultimate ironman (you cannot use the bank, a very important part of Runescape)
---
Another very important part of your Runescape experience is the clan chat scene. it basically works as a group chat where you can go and ask either for advice or to talk some banter. Find yourself a good one and that will make your OSRS experience 10x better. I suggest googling for ccs or jsut scouer trought this subbredit for one.

Why not have full screen even? I've accidently closed the clients quite some times because of the log-out tab being just below.
---
None of my friends play RS or WoW, so once when I DM'ed they played the quest of One Piercing note, traveled north through the wilderness to open a portal by killing the chaos elemental, and had to fight Yog'Saron. 
---
Over all it was fun, got a 7/10 average on our end of game survey. Bug complaint was that there was a lot of puzzles at the start, and few at the end instead of being spread out.
---
This does not make any sense:
---
99/2=49,5 
---
49,5‚âà50
---
50*2=100
---
You gotta try harder
---
I mainly intended this as a weapon for wild pk'ing, admittedly i ignored the pure aspect (i don't pk). given that the nightmare is an endgame activity, it would make sense to give it a high attack requirement, and maybe incentivize more players to choose different builds.
---
Very good

---
This happens when Blizzard had to choose either losing their player-base (banning the player) rather than getting into trouble with China (not doing anything)
---
I don't think this will *ever* happen. Even if it were to shut down, they will either sell the rights to it, or they will want to keep the opportunity to start again in the future. If they were to release an offline version, everyone would be able to make exact copies for runescape, and we would be able to see exactly how things were implemented etc..
---
A variety of reasons really.
---
Some people say that it encourages you to facetank through some damage instead of learning to pray flick correctly.
---
Some people think the dps loss will just give you more instances to take damage and die.
---
Some people are just elitists and think that if they do it a certain way then everyone should do it that way or it's "easy scape".
---
Personally I think that if you **know** that you're only ever going to do it once for the Cape, then you might as well do it with justiciar.
---
Fuck off xi

===== 12 farming on the HC =====
---
Are you right clicking the pouches to empty them or shift-clicking?
---
Also are you using your F keys to switch between interfaces? Bank should be on the ESC key to close it (under setting somewhere).
---
Also also, a further idea is screen markers. You can really speed things up from that.
---
(I went outside the scope of just pouches, but I've been doing a lot of RC lately with steam runes instead of lava but it is the same process.)
---
That poor uim symbol being abused!
---
Irrelevant, you're drawing a conclusion based on unfounded assumptions. You're assuming that bona fide account crackers would ever try to bruteforce/dig anywhere for an unknown account worth **at most** 10 mil, when it's much easier to go after high profile accounts that are actively/have actively played. 
---
Is it hard to crack a random account you can't find information on? Of course it is, that's a truism and doesn't prove anything. Does it indicate that Jamflex account security is as good as it should be? Fuck no
---
Unless you're brute forcing accounts, you need to somehow be able to find out information about the owner of the account and the account itself. From what OP said, there's no reason to believe that there'd be any further information available and that he would not play it. Doesn't prove shit, now does it? 
---
I can take a picture of one tile in my house and post it online challenging burglars all over the world to break into my house, because clearly break-ins are only a cause of home owner irresponsibility and lack of safety measures. If no burglar can pin-point my house and steal the piggy-bank worth 10$ that I offer to leave on the table, then my point is proven and anyone who has their house broken into is a retard
---
The game's engine would explode if you put something in it that resembled a real life picture
---
can't you read? Obviously Incase "SHTF" and the apocalypse is coming
---
Idk farming is probably my favorite skill in the game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
DWH decreases defense by a set amount. BGS reduces stats equivalent to what you hit starting with defense, dwh reduces defense by 30% if you hit at all.
---
so basically if you hit 70 or something, and the opponent's defense level is less than 210 taking the example of 70 being 1/3, BGS would be better, but only when it hits near its max or when you spec several times with high max - and the point with BGS is it drains all stats if you hit high enough.
---
dwh however reduces any ridiculous amount of defense by the same % no matter the number you hit and no matter how high the defense is
---
That looks great!  Just curious, are there any homebrew rules you use?  Like how to implement runes or skills?
---
Next design; Raticate protecting his brine sabre?^^
---
Not played RS in at least 10 years and this lumbridge map looks exactly how I remember it
---
That's pretty cool.    I realized when I started looking at the Spears surrounding the chicken farm fence that the whole fence was 2 or 3 different assets copy-pasted a bunch of times and it all suddenly became very obvious, but the map is obviously for game-sense of where you are and not an accurate hand-drawn image of what's in op's head
---
Revenue, you have to substract the imps but add all the other loots.
---
That's the whole point he is making. He is saying it's the players fault most of the time they are compromised. Loose lips sink ships
---
Now just kill them.
---
Name, ip address (city or postcode in UK), dob, account name, email, password for that leaked account
---
New meme format
---
All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares.
---
I'd agree with the other commentor. Also, if you can try and hitch your wagon to someone who has DM'ed before, they can run a session or two to give you the idea.
---
They could just...Not stay in the public eyes though? Or if Jagex is forcing them to do that, then I can see why they quit but that's on Jagex, not the community.
---
I\`ve sold myself for 20 bucks and a pack of tropical skittles once
---
I tried WoW and it's boring and slow, like a walking-and-waiting-for-respawn-timer-simulator it's everywhere in combat as if you are trying to kill cows or mine iron in F2P runescape, you are just standing there thinking "why am I doing this".
---
If you're interested in getting started and willing to invest a little time into it, try roll20.net ; it's a virtual tabletop simulator and forum where people come together to play. That's how I got started.
---
RAKE IN THE LAKE
---
fuck geese all they do is walk on my property and shit everywhere
---
My 500k bank got cleaned many years ago. Used a unique password with that account. Meaning I didn't use the password anywhere else. So that was fun
---
What? You're confused mate,  I'm not comparing my skill to woox I'm comparing OSRS mechanics to wow. Find one video of current raid content being fully cleared by one person. We'll he waiting!
---
more like neverquest
---
I made the barbarian village a bit of an isolationist town where they didnt let people through without proving their strength in one v one combat. Our barbarian had fun with that one.
---
Because they are no longer in use, they hold little to non evidence as who is the owner
---
&gt; You're absolutely retarded. You expect everyone to just simply have "good online hygiene" and keeping up with dataleaks?!
---
You want me to keep my car locked when it's parked, and keep the keys somewhere safe?!
---
I hope you transferred all your rs3 stuff to another account so you don't lose all that
---
If we had the email it would be easier
---
Essence to rune transformation skill bad
---
Shouldve been telling people from the start what youve been using instead of seeming to take credit for it.
---
Good bot
---
No not true it depends on what you are doing and if maxing your character is your goal.
---
I think runescape is in a pretty good spot having both things to do at full attention (some skills, quests) and a whole lot of netflix n scape stuff
---
Thanks fellas! I‚Äôm averaging 1:45 now!
---
Top comment is 1b if someone hacks it.
---
hows it feel knowing anything you create is going on the front page of 2007scape?
---
I started in Lumbridge with a rescue quest of Hans (who I altered to be a child that wandered too far north and was snatched up by the goblin village goblins and hidden in their underground tunnels). Then to varrock for a mix of shield of arrav and Knights sword.
---
Exactly this!
---
Which is why I won't even bother getting ranger boots on my iron. Competing with losers on every world? No thank you.

---
I did something very similar to the GE. I basically made Varrock the New York of RS and the GR the wallstreet.
---
It‚Äôs because it also reduces his damage I believe could be wrong though
---
toxic weapons for toxic people, dont see a problem here
---
I was only catching imps in the pit. There are three spawns there, I would catch them all and just hop. I couldn‚Äôt tell you exact xp but I didn‚Äôt level from 80-81 in the 30 or so dragon imps I caught.

people aren't 'good' at hacking accounts, account owners just make dumb mistakes.

.....Why would they want to spread more awareness?

go on 2k total or 2200 total. Problem fixed. Next!

Watch out, she's going to force you train runecrafting till you quit Runescape.
---
It's a very strange feeling to know that the only breach of my main email has been because of myspace.
---
Yes, it was one of the major arcs the characters did at a mid level. I maintained the whole fake plague thing, but I had my main antagonist (who is an arcane trickster) assassinate the king and impersonate him. He was transferring citizens of west ardogune into the underground pass to act as "soul fuel" for the resurrection of Iban.
---
just shut up okay
---
Hey man add me ! My other friend just started and we are looking for people to group up with and start grinding to get to learn PVM.   
---
My main is at endgame and is good to go for PVM so  I am playing an ironman while I wait for him to get up to speed.   
---
IGN INevertrade
---
There are some hackers who do this, or ex hackers - like the people who give botting info to that ytber
---
Well then don't have that stuff laying around if you don't want your account to get hacked??
---
What is a hardcore hacker? What‚Äôs their process?
---
Had the same problem, if you join i can help you get trough it if you want!

oh let‚Äôs be real, none of us can escape, we‚Äôre too deep.

---
See if you can login on the website maybe... idk jagex is trash and for whatever reason you cant change your login ID. So if someone has that and is just spamming to lock you out I'm not exactly sure what you can do really. Like I said shitty jagex wont let you change your login ID so even if you change your password it could still cause issues. Do you not have an authenticator on your account? I wonder if they would still be able to spam the account if it forces them to enter the authenticator.
---
Witchaven! 
---
Also, the imgur link in the browser title bar says Witchhaven ;)
---
And a fucking *LOT*.
---
i have a hunch rapier/blade is still better.
---
The gold mine in the wall outside Keldagrim!  Lots of twists and turns, gold everywhere, and a ring of fire!  FIRE!
---
Outplayed. GG.
---
sounds lit honestly. But beware the player Pu$$ysl@yer69. he will ruin your campaign.
---
Bro no one is gonna go through any kind of effort for 10m, make it a bil and people might try
---
I miss you just jumping on the goblin :(
---
[This was the previous challenge if anyone's curious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5x02bz/come_hack_my_account_for_100mil/)
---
100m reward, gave out username + password to both the account and the linked email. 2fa kept everyone out.
---
I think you need only need to hit a minimum of 58 with bgs spec total for it to be better then dwh, and he has less slash defense then crush so dwh is more accurate, just did my first 500 kills with blowpipe and bgs and it works well
---
Not even close. Mining was my third level 99 skill other than all the combat stats and prayer. You can easily afk mine at motherlode. It's super easy, not the worst xp, and you make absolute bank.
---
That hair looks like a headcrab from hl psst
---
Spake in the lake
---
Dont me mates por favor.
---
I'm in school, and where I live is not English speaking. Nobody is going to hire me for an hour of work.
---
black flag will always be the best.
---
I try to, but most are bots :( luckily I've joined a clan and they are v nice!
---
I'd make it THAT kind of fantasy game.
---
What is with you people have you ever heard of motherlode mine? It's extremely afk, you still get good xp rates and you end up making a shit ton of money on the way to 99. Oh and did I mention it was AFK???
---
Glad to hear it!
---
how do you afk Agi o.o Please enlighten me
---
Gz on the gnome
---
The sounds in this game are like listening to a kid play with that annoying fucking toy you regret getting them.
---
I‚Äôm at work right now but I‚Äôll give it a shot later
---
I agree with Randall fuck your luck man. LOL GJ
---
So basically.. it's your own fault if you get hacked. Proving the OP's point.
---
I know the feeling, i got a jar at 7 kc and am now at 550+ wondering what to feel still
---
Yeah more like gnome child venezuelan green dragon bot
---
Love it
---
you best believe i would hunt anyone in the world for 15k
---
I'm sorry you're telling me you can afk agility and runecrafting but you cant afk mining? Wtf? Motherlode mine???? How the hell is agility afk at all? And how tf is runecrafting more afk than the motherlode mine???
---
technically everyone is a gold farmer. kinda the point of the game.
---
What was he doing this time?
---
Ranger flippers?
---
I've seen a ironman go 3.5k dry on blowpipe, and another 1k dry on  his first zulrah unique. I thinks its just the same as other accounts.
---
I barely make 20k. With I was making 40k.
---
Those people remade an account in OSRS within the last 6 years. They were likely late teenagers or adults when they did this. They could very easily have created an absolutely fresh account or changed all the email details for their existing account. In fact if they have an old account it's MORE safe because it's a username login, and as long as they don't happen to be someone like Zezima or Sparc Mac.. their login username is hidden from all and likely hasn't been used since its origin, unless it was your 11 year old self had the ability to have an online persona they stuck to for more than a year.
---
Fresh email you use nowhere, unknown login user, unique password, authenticator, pin, and 2fa on email. You will *never* be hacked outside of extreme circumstances like Jed.
---
it wasnt all in one drop
---
Use a jad simulator to practice your prayer switching. If it's taking you over an hour and a half to get through it you're not doing something right.
---
yesterday I went to puro puro for about 30min, got some magpies but didn't see a dragon imp  
---
just hop around, you'll find some worlds
---
It's not really that afk though. It's much more click intensive than motherlode mine. You're also going to get significantly less xp per hour afk RC vs afk motherlode mine. At least once you can access the top floor of the mine it is. You need 73 agility and 77 RC to access zeah and there is no afk xp for RC until that level. Actively training to 77 runecrafting is very time consuming and requires your full attention.  If you're 3 ticking iron, yes that's very click intensive as well but at least its double the xp rate that runecrafting gives. Motherlode mine can be accessed at what, level 30 mining? All you need is a pickaxe and you're all set. Runecrafting is less xp per hour and requires your attention more frequently and requores more clicks in between the afk aspects. Mining&gt;Runecrafting... do you have 99 in either skill?
---
Wow Jagex can never imagine to fuck up that hard at a DMM tournament... well maybe someday, this planets lifespan goes on a little longer I'm sure
---
Name checks out
---
I ran the numbers using my stats in the DPS calculator as I don't know yours (85/89/85 melee for comparison) using a superset and piety:
---
* DWH spec was ~77.77% accuracy for the first hit using elite void/salve/dboots/dfs/fcape (scuffed build I know..). DWH will always drop Vork's defense by 30%, or 64.2 levels. Your average DWH spec will drop vorkath's defense by ~50 levels including the times you miss with the special, BUT you go all or nothing on a 77% roll.
---
* BGS spec was 79% accuracy for first hit using the same build minus the shield and the max hit is 72, meaning the most you will drop his defense is 72 levels based on RNG. Your average BGS spec will drop vorkath's defense by 28.5 levels, again including the missed specials, BUT you have a higher chance to hit with a ~17% chance for the spec to be more effective than the DWH when the attack lands.
---
I'm sure you don't have the same combat stats as me, but as long as the gear is the same(or close to it) these numbers should all be close. It really comes down to whatever you feel like using, I just wanted to let you know that they both are viable options for shredding Vork's defense.
---
everything is about OSRS you just dont know why yet
---
Blow pipe makes it so easy, I do jad in 40 min well watching a movie.
---
Nice
---
All those upvotes and still wrong as hell.
---
They're totally different games - it's only impossible to solo CE Mythic WoW content because its mathematically impossible to do so, not because of 'skill'.
---
Look, I've been a mythic raider in WoW, I held multiple paraes below world 20 during Firelands as a DK, when I returned in Legion I was parsing legendary on my DK and my Rogue on mythic encounters.
---
As someone who can quite literally call themselves an 'elite' WoW PVE player, OSRS is a 'harder' game because theres less room for error when soloing PvE content. Especially when trying to do it efficiently on an ironman account or for profit on a normal account. 
---
Comparing these games in the way you did is just pure stupidity.
---
Start with quests that give good xp lamps or herb rewards, but if you really want to train it you'll need to do slayer or farming. You can try thieving for seeds. Other than that there's wintertodt.
---
Well, it‚Äôs an entire post of someone asking the community to hack his account lmao.
---
Is this proven somewhere? I'm running the numbers in the DPS calculator and their accuracy is nearly identical
---
what does ******* mean?
---
Thieving Bad Wc Bad Fishing Bad Nmz Very Bad Zmi Good Mlm good SWAMPMAN GOOD
---
cultural devolution of combat
---
God damn I hope this doesn't turn into a 1/20k Dragon warhammer grind to compensate. Best of luck!
---
Guys this is misinformation, do the calculations yourself if you really want to know. Or use a dps calculator.
---
Are we really that diverse? Mostly American and UK with a side salad of Western Europe and Australia if you go off the server list.
---
This is awesome! I ran a mini-arc D&amp;D campaign in Gielinor based on the Dragon Slayer quest and it went really well.
---
For starters, it's a joke - but some ppl get so used to being a higher lvl, where NPCs like dark wizards don't agro you, that on a fresh acc they forget they're a low lvl where everything's aggressive to you.
---
Does the caclc include the double accuracy from bgs spec?
---
Damn lol all of my emails have at least 6 pwns. I checked the old one I used in like 2008 and fucking Neopets had a data breach that got it
---
See Kacy. He takes Dragon Imp donations to get Elite clues for the Masters turn in for his Bloodhound hunt.
---
It‚Äôs just the fact that rimmington is the most accessible location.
---
They didn't say 
---
Probably late 2020
---
Not bad
---
Yo what game is this forreal
---
Never seen someone get slapped by a glove?
---
Also the ancient wyvern shield is a terrible item for its rarity. Having negative range defence on a mage shield is just bad and the antifire protection isn't useful anywhere.
---
So after all this shit OSB pulled a couple weeks ago people are really gonna sit here and say ‚ÄúYoU CanT Be HaCkEd bY a ThIrD PaRtY‚Äù
---
Get fishing or woodcutting and there is no reason you can't keep OSRS running whether you are playing wow or not lol
---
You could do elemental and catalytic runes only to avoid over-complicating things.
---
And the level/damage of spell used would be dependent on the roll. Roll min = you cast an air strike which barely ruffles the feathers on a chicken, roll max = your fire surge incinerates a lesser demon.
---
No date yet but, aiming for next year. Apperently it relies on the clans update first.
---
The dude who unnotes is closer than the bank
---
Past member giving an honest critique of this clan.
---
Its a great cc for beginners, they are very open and willing to teach you whatever pvm content aswell as work with you to reach clan standards. There are tons of events with a fair ranking system based on participation and time in the clan, and they do a great job to encourage interaction and bring players into a social environment. Overall this is a very reputable clan perfect for anyone not over competitive or who is a casual player.
---
However relax CC does struggle with drama, and lack of respect for leadership between higher ranking members which often causes schisms and splits between members. This coupled with a very closed off attitude towards discussion and resolving drama away from the public eye of the clan leads to a toxic environment.  
---
Overall this is a great clan! They have shortcomings but if you can go into it with a positive attitude theres a good chance you‚Äôll find a place to fit in.
---
Levelling in classic isn't harder just because it's a bit slower I.e. lower xp rates, no heirlooms or better gear for your level to make it quicker levelling
---
Its because the quests get more scattered and isolated from eachother. It's easy in early levels you have a linear progression to a town and there's like 6 or 7 quests to get. And they all only require you to venture around the local area. Higher levels as early as 30s I notice the quests are all over the place now.
---
Finding an optimal route and order to do quests in requires a strategic plan that most YouTube guides cannot help you with because you can have any assortment of quests carried on. I doubt very few high level players quest logs look identical.
---
As a project engineer for a road construction business i love it. Strategic and optimized planning of my resources and planning my route to be most efficient is something I do at work, and it feels cool to be able to do it in my game time too. Because I sure as Fuck couldn't play wow like this when I was a kid, I just brute forced it and wasted so many hours.. still fun times though.
---
No point in doing that since mirror shield is a complete downgrade of V‚Äôs shield
---
Do you have all of your maps, I would love to run this as a campaign for my group.

Quite shitty rn nor‚Äôeaster hitting the area. Massive xp gains.
---
I deleted all my contributions to this thread as my calc was scuffed. I put in a bunch of custom NPC defensive numbers for the BKnights post-nerf to see if they were worth doing and I didn't clean them up before doing this. The difference in spec accuracy is ~45% DWH vs. 65% BGS at 85 attack.
---
Oh yea mb, it looked like that over the youtube background, thanks for the answer though ill check when i get home!
---
People that kill basilisk knights can‚Äôt afford a rapier. Idk why you‚Äôre even mentioning it
---
They also took his past earnings and even fired the casters who let him speak, the definition of overkill
---
yes blizzard's appology is indeed the number 1 thing to focus on..
---
I see your point and you may be right, but that still doesn't change my opinion of how toxic the community here is. The attitude towards newer players, the endless downvotes for no reason, people just being dicks in general. I browse through new here quite a lot and it's no wonder this game has a new player retention problem. People come here to try to share achievements, ask questions and learn, make friends etc and they just end up getting shit on, told that nobody cares and to get gud.
---
Ah darn you‚Äôre right, stick with ibans blast or you can use a green salamander but it‚Äôll be pretty weak.
---

This is a great idea!! It actually covers mine and kinda more! Lets press the issue!
---
Fishing is the worst skill in the game

just use leaf bladed baxe, since you miss ticks because of special attack you want harder hitting weapon

Absolute minimum is 3 cmbt according to Rendi. Anything higher is just helpful bonus.

&gt;I think the community is more upset with the lack of safeguards when people fuck up rather then jagex‚Äôs actually security. 
---
That's not how any of the argument is framed when it comes to account security.
---
From every post I've seen criticizing jagex, it's all of jagex fault. I have been downvoted into oblivion suggesting its irresponsibility of the user at some point, and honestly, is the identical identical situation with botting

There is no need for fact checking. The US is based on a philosophy of taking what you want and controlling what you want. That is called greed. The US has unjustly taken several millions of lives for their own gain.

yeah man, the boss is easy but using my method was not profitable and might be a little difficult to mimic on an iron acc unless you are pretty far in. That being said hopefully my build can inspire something that'd work for you! 
---
Chaos fanatic is weak to range and only uses magic attacks. All I wear for armor is black d-hide top, bottom, archer ring (I), helm of nieteznot, barrows gloves, and snake skin boots.  For my weapon I used a blowpipe but honestly a rune crossbow and your best bolts will do just fine. 
---
In my inventory I usually bring 4-8 super restores (more lengthens your trip, but bring only as many as you're willing to risk), 4 Sara brews, 2 ranging pots, and a Dwarf cannon. 
---
Theres some videos on youtube that will show you where to place your cannon to double hit the fanatic every rotation. His mechanics are super simple. Protect mage, hit him with range, and if he uses his burst attack (looks like jizz) take two steps in any direction to avoid damage, and sometimes he uses an attack that will unequipped all your items. If this happens put your blowpipe on first to continue damage. 
---
If someone tries to pk you chug brews and run to the KBD lair. If you can pull the lever before dying you can use teleports in the KBD cave. Generally, people won't bother you much because fighting you would draw agro from fanatic and your canon. Also, you can leave your canon assembled on the wilderness floor and still be able to use it.

Awhh, thats wholesome af

when I did the math on rapier/saeldor v cudgel, rapier had a 0.4 dps/~5% dps increase over cudgel in max &amp; praying piety. Without piety, the dps increase over cudgel is like 0.05/&lt;1%.

Cos I‚Äôm being realistic. Don‚Äôt be a dick. Devs ain‚Äôt gonna mess about with the desktop UI.
---
Because I made over 100m on my way to 99 mining and I strictly only train mining while I'm not playing runescape. Like I'm focused almost entirely on something else. Like I'm at my desk at work or I'm playing a different video game at home. I dont really care if volcanic mine is 2x the xp. You dont even break even and since I'm not trying to break any records trying to max I'd rather make absolute bank.
---
This is so dumb. The way you get hacked is your email, the one you use frequently and for everything, get released in a website hack, data leak, etc. then people run scripts to see which one of those emails has registered to Runescape. Then they sell that information to people who try and gather enough to either recover you, or, look for other leaks that contain a password you used for a different site and have scripts run that. 
---
Just because you made a fresh email and fresh account you want people to just guess out of thin air. That‚Äôs not how it happens. 99% of players don‚Äôt have a fresh dedicated runescape email.
---
Agil as it's not as afk... but rc xp rates are bad....

They go inactive after a week of not logging it. Once they go inactive they don't just reactivate upon next login. So yeah they are probably inactive.

Or maybe I was refuting you making excuses for people not having what you called "good online hygeine". It is 100% your fault if you're not making use of all the EASY AND FREE options available to you at this point.
---
&gt; Are you braindead?
---
No but you should probably find a way to resolve these anger issues you seem to have.
---
&gt; My old passwords are leaked and there's nothing I can do to stop a recovery
---
Your old passwords for your RS account? Because you unnecessarily reused passwords for multiple accounts like you're never supposed to do?
---
4 more max hits is going to be significantly more than a very slight accuracy bonus from my general experience. I would do the math myself as well, but I just don't care a whole lot.
---
If you want to post all of the math you did down below and you're right, I'll admit that I'm wrong. The math is all that matters.
---
Man this comment makes me feel old.
---
"finally" haha, huge gratz though
---
Both mine and my brother's accounts have been hacked for 100M+. We use the OG username to login so no email and passwords unique to OSRS. We both used OSbuddy free version at the time. OSbuddy and some 3rd party clients are the reason for hacks

oh man so many memories...

About to finish Morytania hard to grind some barrows out. What set up should I use? I have 66 magic so thinking of sticking with Ibans instead of grinding up to 75 magic. Don‚Äôt have blowpipe yet but can buy if needed, I‚Äôm just unsure on what gear to wear. Was still in rune last time I did barrows so I‚Äôm a bit further now in terms of gear.

This way of thinking is fundamentally flawed. Hell, the "but you participate in society" comic is criticizing this very mindset.   
---
Participating in the thing that you are criticizing is not hypocritical. Stopping yourself from driving a car is absolutely pointless and hurts your livelihood while benefiting those who DO drive cars and profit off of polluting the environment. Systematically changing EVERYONE's carbon footprint is several orders more effective than changing your individual livelihood at your own expense.

How many attempts did you fit into 2 weeks?

Make it 100m and give me the login email &amp; I'll give it a fair shot.

Okay, I get it, people knew him before this year. But most people didnt. You're not special bud
---
Gratz!!!
---
You only feel sadness anyway bud, you did 99 rc.
---
You can easily do 52 second trips with wrath runes.
---
Atleast you made some money out of the rc grind
---
Yeah I'm not choosing to restrict myself. I don't have a computer and I don't have money to spare to buy a computer currently. I don't pvp often so I don't care much one way or another but your answer is shitty and rude. 
---
I don't see how having a mobile only pvp world would impact or restrict anybody that isn't using mobile. Shouldn't be a big deal.
---
During the weekday it was anywhere up to 300k. Weekends I could blast out near 1m.
---
It‚Äôs really sad for someone who doesn‚Äôt like Slayer. It kinda kills the enjoyment of the game for me. ‚ÄúDo this thing you don‚Äôt like doing for optimal play experience‚Äù like fuck me, imagine this sub circlejerking Runecraft as the best skill ever.

Played since 2004, never been hacked... Seriously, if you are getting hacked multiple times, you need to rethink the information you are putting out there on the fucking internet.
---
üòõüòõüòõüòõüòõüòõ
---
The average is about 8300gp the graph shows a drop to 8100gp that is only a 2,5% price difference. That‚Äôs fucking nothing. Only looks bad with the Graph zoomed in so close.
---
10M isn't enough to motivate someone...
---
Also don't think anyone is going to disagree with you that if you get hacked the hacker got some info on you. OFC they need info on you.
---
To make this more fair is you need to do common things that ~~are~~ should be totally acceptable to do without having to worry about your account such as: having info about yourself such as birthday, location and other common info on social media, having the same username on social media or other websites as you have on rs and make it easy to find your other accs, having the same pass on other websites, have a picture on social media showing playtime and creation date of your account, have a video or stream where you log into your account or have the same user as your log in user from before email log ins. There's tons of other things that shouldn't be a problem to do and this experiment is a straw man without including those. No one is saying if you leave 0 info out there your acc will be hacked.

In what situation would someone not use shenanigans? Unless you're brute forcing it, you kind of have to. Sending you an exe file, buying access to a password/email dump, etc. are the best ways to do this and they're all shenanigans as far as I'm concerned.
---
Yea, dragon slayer is so uniquely RS that I felt it hard to wrap into my campaign.
---
Cool, makes sense - do you have a system for combat level / challenge level conversions?
---
This year, November 14
---
I appreciate the compliment that people would pay for this. I'm more than happy to share. Makes up for all the google image searches I've stolen for the campaign. ;)
---
Oh shit, construction time
---
How was that possible? Which rc run you did?
---
is there any way to get him banned?
---
Damn Lumbridge
---
Okay thanks
---
Literally what kept me from playing osrs for so long. Goddamn I hate the current dev decision to minimize the game‚Äôs expansive skill selection down to just getting everything through slayer. 
---
Skills should be equal, not one above all.
---
I've played for over 3 years... 3 and 2 years ago it was great and basically like a short quest. Last year they said they'd spend less time on holiday events, and the halloween event was kind of barebones. The christmas event after that too, and don't get me started on easter.
---
Personally not the biggest fan of the DE version, but I was toying with the idea of making the entire map.
---
I made the well coated in some sort of magical blockade, and that the orbs (also magical in nature) needed to he retirved and destroyed in the furance to undo the magical obstacle of the well. I added more D&amp;D based traps to each path for each Orb.
---
Work on getting all your stats to 50,60,70 something like that
---
It‚Äôs the Duke of Lumbridge‚Äôs birthday
---
And? Spreading it is exactly what the fuck doesn‚Äôt want
---
Update: If you ran it for 
---
* 40 days without touching it GP = 1,106,294
---
* 40 with keeping approval around 98 (+/-2) = 1,997,156
---
Both are recharged with coins technically (unless you are talking about trident of the swamp rather than trident of the seas).
---
Also the trident has an attack speed of 4 while Iban Blast has an attack speed of 5. So while Iban Blast may have a higher max hit at 75 Magic, the trident is still better for DPS since it attacks 20% faster.
---
Trident of the seas is fairly cheap to use at Barrows since you can pay for it with the GP and runes you get from the chests themselves (assuming with Morytania Hard diary done). The surplus runes and the actual uniques will turn a good profit for mid-level players who want some early cash before progressing onto harder and more profitable content such as Zulrah.

Well censored

Bruh I did 99 farming in fashionscape and EVERYONE is in graceful. With my POH I never ran out of energy once...
---
lmao just dodge???
---
Awesome! I imagine my players will buy in to the no weapons just fine, I just always try and make sure I'm as consistent in my world as possible.
---
I will definitely be having them go to Entrana and dealing with the tree spirit at some point!
---
But neither is being done most people don‚Äôt say shit until it‚Äôs trendy to do so and once the trend dies so does their ‚Äúinterest‚Äù in the issue
---
Critical role got me into D&amp;D too. Go for it. I dont regret it at all.
---
Over the entirety of the campaign we had quite a number of big bads for story arcs. And because we had so many players 7-10 throughout most of the big boss fights were pretty insane. Reading through these comments makes me want to write a campaign recap just to see how far they'd come.
---
Which one hangs lower?
---
Searching for clan on a java video game just to socialize somehow seems even worse ngl
---
Grats. Regarding the first part of your title, I have a suggestion to make. Playing alone is nice (I'm an introvert), but I recommend you join a small stream and make come connections. Talk about the game, perhaps join their stream discord. You can share accomplishments and get support/feedback that way.
---
Then get 85 and boost 5 levels.
---
Got one at 58.

That was me hahah, I posted this and then did it myself

Wow this is amazing!! Keep it up :)
---
Idk, ive heard this a bunch but its just good internet hygiene to use different passwords on all your online accounts. It seems like people are trying to punish Jagex for having a recovery system that requires unchangable personal information. Yes, if the information gets out, you are at risk. But so many of the same kinds of pieces have to get out.
---
The big one that was published a few years ago had 100m on the account, and the host published the login email, the password, the account's email, and the password to that email.
---
It still sits unclaimed. Separate 2FA on both keep it completely safe.
---
Got to Jad twice last night. First time I died due to a lag spike that messed up my prayer switch. 2nd time I lost cause I panicked got hit for an 87 and while I was brewing up the healers spawned making me panic even more. All on stream too so I got roasted pretty bad not only by Jad but by my friends too lol
---
He did say Pvm..
---
Well you are in luck because im probably gonna make a gielnor diplo or something similar. (Probably without Kourend tho).
---
Hahaha thanks!
---
Gratz! Next goal for you account?
---
If a boss does damage to someone else, ironmen won't get the loot.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I think a big issue is also for accounts that have... over the course of 10 years been compromised. I'm assuming a lot of companies have had data breaches over 10 years and lets be honest, who hasn't used their runescape login for something else as a kid? As far as I know, there's no way to edit old recovery questions.. and they're not even an option anymore to have on the accounts.
---
Pls im doing clue
---
How is your mental stability post 99?
---
Korn, disturbed, mudvayne

If you weren't aware you can loot range pots from zombies in tarns lair, very helpful on a jad attempt. Also strawberry baskets are a healing option worth considering

How many attempts in total? Took me around 28 attempts in 1 week on my main originally :P

Wow someone has finally done it!!

---
Ive tried to recover an account with all these details and more to no luck. I talk about it in a post i would link, but on mobile
---
I'll pose the same question to you: What about it?
---
He's not wrong when he says "Wow it's almost like Jagex security is perfectly fine and the people getting hacked are idiots." because he's only referencing one aspect of their security process.
---
Most people were "idiots" when they were young, and the internet itself was fairly young and just starting to go mainstream. 
---
Most people are not born security geniuses. Most people reused the same passwords, reused the same email, reused the same security questions, reused the same usernames etc. and all this serves to ruin their chances of ever securing their accounts because the recovery system exists. I was younger than ten when I made my first RS account and I reused passwords etc etc and because of that every single one of my accounts is raided regularly and there's no way for me to secure them. None. Recovering them removes all 2FA etc etc. I can't go back in time and remove all that information from old forum posts, I can't go back in time and not reuse passwords, I can't go back in time and use different usernames on different forums, I can't go back in time and use random jibberish in the security questions *instead of the real answers which are trivial to find out about anyone once you start unraveling their identity*.
---
Am I an idiot? I'd say no. But was I an idiot about security when I was literally ten years old? Yes. Who wasn't.
---
Anyone who thinks that Jagex has a good handle on account security is either an idiot or uninformed.
---
People comparing this to desktop... I have 2 screens so I kinda do have this on my desktop already.
---
I also got 99rc without the pet.  Let me join your group of sadness.
---
Oh wow even if the boss damages someone else? I guess that's a good way to stop you tanking with your other accounts.
---
Made me smile, thanks!
---
Hurr durr, excuse me for not wearing justiciar to kill a shit mob with a useless unique. They hit like a truck in full torag, but sure maybe thats not tanky enough.

Your XP rates are way off dude. At mlm at 85 with Max attention you get 40k xp per hour for with prospector coal bag and bigger sack. The 5 inventories in a row of banking is what kills the 45-50k xp rate and I get 8k mining xp per hour from zeah rc while afking.
---
For 800 non ffa raids one you would be totally done using Skilling for money other than zalcano or black chins. The opportunity cost of using mlm is just too shitty.
---
Did you work on mlm and it holds a deep place in your heart or something? Because there's no reason to defend that shitty content in 2019.

Yeah mine was around 20ish attempts. First try got to wave 50 but I didn‚Äôt know anything about where to stand.

A fair price for the 26k casket that clue hunter will get

They take the same amount of coin at 100% or 0% popularity. 10% of whatever is in the chest with a maximum of 50k (or 75k) a day.
---
Thank you. Golden gnome please.
---
Extremely disappointing, but thanks for reporting in.
---
I'll be sticking with High Sierra unless/until there are reports of the issue being fixed at some point.

It's just mind-blowing that a bug like this could be introduced and go unfixed for so long.
---
Lmao good bot

20ish attempts
---
I will say the arc I'm most proud of was a quest to recover the 3 torn pieces of The Ice Barrage spell scroll. In my lore Zamorak unleashed the spell he originally stole from Zaros in a last ditch effort to win the war causing the remaining battlefields of the God Wars to freeze over, and in turn scattering the scroll. Ancient Zarosian entities eventually recovered all the pieces and handed them over to very powerful guardians. The Ice Queen beneath White Wolf Mountain, An Aboleth in the seas south of Ardougne, and a power hungry Ancient Red Dragon in the Wilderness slowly turning himself into a Lava Dragon.
---
The party ended up recovering all of the, but lost one along the way while deep in Morytania to The Shadow Forger (one of the Dungeoneering bosses, the lore I made for him was pretty cool too)
---
I gotta say and I'm sure every DM running a Runescape campaign can agree, creating deeper lore for existing stuff within the universe and playing it out is some of the most fun I've had with Runescape, even though it's not in the actual game.
---
How long did it take you?

Assuming on task + max stats/gear:

If you camp slaughters then rapier is better

If you camp ferocious or swap gloves then hasta is better

I am currently around 410 kc on my iron without the cudgel... I did some kills on my main to see how much easier it was with max and got a cudgel on 4kc.... forever hating myself lol
---
yes thats well known now, but the issue is that if you have an old account from when you were 12 and you used bad practices 10 years ago your account is still at risk **today** and there's nothing you can do about it
---
ya i like that idea
---
Nice! That gives me a little hope. I gotta find the time to do it, thanks for the boost! Now go show off your dope ass cape!
---
I don't see how that's relevant information
---
I completely agree
---
Early osrs days it wasnt nearly as bad as it is now. Back when ironman was first released you were able to force spawn high tier imps in a world and get a dragon about every hour, occasionally you'd spot another person but it was very rare. Now the place is infested w/ bots.
---
Didnt you upload this yesterday lol
---
Tell that to 670 kc with one unique
---
Get 99 FM and then barrows gloves lol
---
So what? There have been drastic changes before like the zulrah drop table nerf. This should prove to be useful long run
---
If they're game is on a 0.6 tick cycle I'd argue you can only see clicks in the same fashion (ie. Player clicked key abc on this specific tick). However, I could be wrong.
---
They're doing that in the comic books that take place directly after. Nickelodeon seems to want to completely forget the show exists so well probably never see one on TV again. Oddly they're remaking last Airbender as a live action show on Netflix, not sure why
---
no you dont. if you have access to the rs acc, and the verified email of the rs account you can simply remove the authenticator. This isn't possible though if your email is also backed by 2FA
---
I've actually lost a decent amount from disconnects. Few torsos and probably about 50M around 2015, doesn't negate my argument. Either way it's apparent that a new death mechanics system is needed and that is my base argument.
---
&gt;A 10 year old which reuses their (relatively weak) password everywhere is guaranteed to be the victim of a database leak, exposing their password, e-mail, username etc to malicious actors without their knowledge.
---
Got it. So a 10 year old in like 2008 or something had bad security for their accounts and were involved in some database leaks. 
---
But if someone accessed their email that long ago, they weren't digging up payment information and location data + ISP information.
---
First of all, because your email doesn't contain that info
---
And secondly, because nobody who hacked a 10 year olds email from a database leak in 2008 was securing a bunch of information so they could hack their runescape account 11 years in the future.
---
And if you *were* subject to leaks that disclosed enough of your private information for a successful account recovery, then yeah that sucks ass. But you're effectively asking Jagex to solve security quandries from a decade ago, how are they supposed to determine accurate account ownership information when you were 10 years old at the time?
---
Jagex cannot be expected to protect you from yourself, or fix mistakes you made a decade ago. If you've messed up that badly, or been so unfortunate, then maybe it's time to make a new account and properly secure it from the beginning.
---
Dude, you're all over the place and clearly have little to no game knowledge. The point of bringing up the fact that only noobs and Ironmen that haven't unlocked zulcano yet is to benefit those who haven't got 99 yet.
---
I'm glad you were happy to get your consolation prize for wasting 300 hours at mlm.
---
If this were hypotheticaly in one kill you would just do 1/512 x 1/6000 x 1/32,000 (forget what exact is) and then the brimstone key? (Lets say its a superior to entertain it being all in one kill‚Äù

Data leaks only hurt when you use the same password everywhere

That's social engineering, not leaks.

If you know my runescape login information and my email password, you would still never gain access to my account.

Would explain their rapid economic explosion in just 30-40 years. They went from stone age to top 5 in less than 2 generations. (i count 1 generation 20 years). It's concerning if they ever attempt to impose their ass backwards communism totalitarian crap on the rest of the world. Then its ww3.

I mainly want to have both tabs of menus on the right side, it's pretty hard to switch to a prayer or spell on the other side of the screen

which is what the bulk of my comment was about, please read the whole thing and not just the first sentence lol
---
Exactly this. The server is way too unstable to support a brutal death mechanic. Not just that, bosses would be camped by only really hardcore players who knows every mechanic if we had to carefully pick safe equipments every time. I do think 1 hour is a bit too much though.

Rage comics were the shit

You can't just accept something because it's always been like that. How would anything in life ever change if you just accept problems for what they are instead of changing it? That's not how problems get solved lol
---
Based on the guides I've read on Inferno it can be done with non max gear and isn't time dependent on that gear, but rather learning the flow of the waves, the timing of the prayer flicks and having nerves of steel for a few hours.

You got this!

do level 3 skillers still exist? i used to see them all the time in pre-EoC but i never see them in osrs, i'd guess for this exact reason

I didn‚Äôt due to the windows store only release. I was so happy, but had my heart broken. Now I don‚Äôt even want to support Warcraft 3 because the whole Hong Kong situation. I just want some RTS nostalgia üò≠

Support. These death mechanics have conditioned and coddled players too much. Now when they go to the ONE place in this entire game that they can lose items, they get absolutely furious and vote no to pvp updates because someone killed them.
---
Key word here is "donations"

Copy pasting the explanation from the original thread
---
"Just in case somebody missed it, this is an spellcheck feature where they make suggestions on how to fix your spelling and grammar mistakes. If you disagree with its suggestions, you can click "Ignore" and send feedback to teach their algorithm to make better suggestions. So the feedback was successfully sent, and the suggestion they made for you was ignored in your word processor.

The character development is just unreal. One of the most bingeable shows I've ever watched
---
the whole fucking game is trivial to bot tbh. there are raids bots. only thing difficult to bot would be PvP and i'm pretty sure there are bots that can do that with a fair degree of success
---
Technically true, and it has happened before, but that's a bit of a separate issue. 
---
Either your phone company fucked up massively for being fooled
---
OR
---
The imposter had enough information that the phone company couldn't have possibly known that it wasn't you. In which case they probably have enough info to reasonably pull off an identify theft.
---
The Recipe for Disaster series is a good thing to work towards (quest is also charmingly written). It's divided into subparts with increasing requirements, and will have you progressively complete quests all over the world, so you'll see a lot of storylines.
---
Fight Arena, Tree Gnome Village, Grand Tree and Waterfall quest are nice, easy ones for some melee levels.
---
PvMers don't get along with PvPers because of the toxicity and the huge level curve. Not because of the risk.
---
gonna go ahead and pop in here to say I'm with you man, i have never understood why people say mlm is afk. if you afk at all the xp rates go from eh to absolutely abysmal. nothing in this game is really "afk" in the true sense of the word, but mlm isnt even afk by osrs standards.
---
After 20 days you would start to take less from the coffer, which would mean you also waste less but make less, I believe no matter what amount of money is taken you would start to go negative after 40 days

go into options and set npc attack options to "hidden". one click pickpocketing completely legitimately. obviously doesn't apply to blackjacking, and doesn't work for npcs you can talk to, but it does work for ardy knights.
---
Yes they need the password along with social engineering. Which was my point. Having just one or the other doesn't work. "tests" like this are retarded circle jerks for people to participate in. Eventually another high profile account security problem will come along and then all you drooling retards will be quiet for another half year. Then you wind back up with this bullshit.
---
It's like 3 years old. Not even giving credit.
---
yeah, but we need item sinks, not another gold sink
---
dealing with excess gold is easy but with excess items there's currently almost no solution to that. this is what harsh death mechanics look to fix.
---
in addition, in theory it'd be possible to create an auto-tele mechanic on the server side that would count down time in gameticks from last input received from the client. so, if you set a time (let's say 10 ticks) and didn't put in any inputs on your client for that amount of time, the server would automatically attempt to use any teleports on your character (you preset the preferred teleport beforehand) and effectively save you in case of a dc. if you don't have any teleports or you're blocked from teleporting, it obviously wouldn't work.
---
this would eradicate nearly all of both DC and ddos related deaths.
---
That is actually fucking insane
---
Yes. If there's a protest I would join it, but I'm not going to try to start a riot by myself without a good enough reason in most people's eyes. It would accomplish nothing.
---
Free free to join my PvM/Bossing/Raids cc ‚ÄúLegacy PvM‚Äù mention ‚ÄúGuthix Slays‚Äù sent ya :)
---
i've done plenty of puro-puro and this basically is just wrong. Yes, it is a contested minigame but to just assume everyone is a bot is stupid, its a good moneymaker with low requirements and is popular for ironman.
---
So what is your argument, that runescape  is better because 1 raid is harder or that both games are shit?
---
Where?? I loved arcanists sooo much I really hope they bring it back
---
‚ÄòJust Keep Going‚Äô
---
That‚Äôs when I knew
---
If its too much to lose maybe you shouldn't risk it. Better gear should equal better skill. Get better, and then you will be more comfortable risking your best gear. Otherwise, you deserve to lose it: you aren't good enough to use it, and need more practice. This is risk vs reward. Being better at the game lets you bring better, high risk gear, and with that high risk comes high reward in the form of faster kills.
---
Stupid guess on my part, but I'd guess it's because they don't have a use for those items. You see all the different mobs of TzHaar using all the weapons, so they've aptly given them TzHaar-style names, but you don't see them wearing obby armor or the cape, so the humans gave them more human names. Obviously not canon, this is the same logic I use when I'm playing trivia and I'm wrong more than half the time there too.
---
Ironman mode in general is very playable. Legacy mode is kinda lackluster imo when the endgame comes.
---
Zulrah drop table nerf is nowhere near as drastic as changing the death mechanics would be....
---
Osiris v3 guide, google it
---
What. The. Actual. Fuck.  Surely this isn't actually Ronan?
---
So we use disconnects to take items from players who earned them as a way to balance the economy? that's an incredibly lazy and thoughtless approach. Bandos has been sitting steady at it's current price for years now, explain to me why an item sink is so badly needed?
---
Until he traded that Porsche for Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes
---
I believe it was used to imbue rings back then? What was that moved to?
---
It seems like the post was taken down. There‚Äôs a small team at Jagex that was dedicated to it, they posted last year and a mod commented this year, when someone told them to revive Arcanists, with a winking face. It was hailed as a hint. However, with all the Mods that have been leaving, I‚Äôm not sure how that project team is doing. :(
---
fair
---
and demotivating lol
---
There is no solution to prevent DDoS attacks. If they revert the death mechanics I assure you the DDoS attacks will return.
---
With that being said.. I agree that the death mechanics are too easy. But there isn't an elegant solution. This game isn't built around people losing their items anymore. Nowadays you have hundreds of hours worth of gear equipped at any time. Dying with the old death mechanics could easily cost someone 1b+. I also refuse to agree with the old death mechanics being an item sink, all that happened was the items would go from 1 person to another because people would pick them up. 
---
In my opinion adding risk to death isn't related to item sinks. People are really good at this game and dying is rare without disconnecting. Relying on disconnecting players to sink items isn't what I would call a good sink. I doubt stuff like Zulrah, Vorkath, Hydra, ToB, CoX, and Inferno are going to have their safe deaths changed any time soon. Sire, cerb, and GWD are the only "dangerous" content in the game where dying results in your items going on the ground. Everywhere else is either easy or on the list of safe deaths. 
---
I think death could cost more in gp overall, but losing items shouldn't be part of that. Losing items should be through willing item sinks (attachments or taking items apart) or through clever use of a tax on the GE that buys items and destroys them.
---
The risk is I could fly through the windshield. The reward is I could fly through the windshield?
---
How exactly am I all over the place, And how exactly did I waste 300 hours?
---
It‚Äôs not just about risking items or gp. It‚Äôs about IRL time.
---
Think about it from this perspective. Imagine someone spends hundreds of hours acquiring the items they want. Now they can finally enjoy the game as they wanted to. They die under your proposed mechanics and lose those items. Now, despite having spent hundreds of hours acquiring those items, they have to spend even more time get those items back and reach the same level of fun they were just at. With the understanding that they could lose it again just as easily.
---
You know what I‚Äôd do? I‚Äôd probably quit. Many of us have full time jobs and families. And there are tons of other games that I could just pick up and play where I could still have fun if I made a mistake. I dump all that time in Runescape for the game to just take away my progress? Fuck that. Many people quit after being hacked for the same reason, so this scenario isn‚Äôt outlandish. And every player that quits is money out of Jagex‚Äôs pocket.
---
Players that want to risk can do PvP.
---
Auto clickers are getting banned far more frequently, so people that would normally run 55-99 magic on 10 hp accounts to sell would normally use air battle staves as the selected item since you would typically have made 3m-5m gp in alches alone before selling the account. Now since they have a very high ban rate people are choosing not to use such high value items.
---
It is unfortunately. I kept going down his comment history and it's 100% him.
---
I‚Äôll be waiting... go ahead and pick up these coins.. you know you want to.
---
Rent? Food??? lmao just live under a bridge and eat rats so you can play runescape instead smdh
---
They it on steam though, you know that right?
---
Im completely lost for words lmao
---
This belongs in the Louvre
---
That has nothing to do with leaks. Thats someone falling for a scam. Thats not Jagex's fault. Hell, even if you don't have authenticator and you get hacked from a leaked DB its still your fault for reusing user/pass combos. 
---
It's not "privilege" that has kept me from ever getting hacked, it's simply not doing stupid shit and caring enough about the time I've invested into my account to actually follow current infosec principles. People who are being hacked today are the same ones who got their armor trimmed in 07.
---
Oh shiiiiit I'm a fool! I haven't done knights in a while cause I just don't enjoy thieving but I totally forgot about the npc attack options! Thanks!
---
How is it in a great place??? You risk nothing when you die...
---
This is fucking sexy
---
This was weird seeing, as I'm in an iron clan called "Iron Relax" and for a second I thought they were advertising on Reddit lol.
---
Nah mate, sometimes food is the issue if he spits a bunch of those goddamn ranged attacks in a row at me, happens like 10% of the time. If I brought less food then running out of food would just happen more often. If I'm gonna have slightly extra of anything, I want it to be food
---
Aflac?
---
Training melees in F2P is incredibly slow and not worth it. Just become a member, it will make the game much more fun
---
,,,0lppp
---
Lmao imagine logging in with an email on your main account
---
Did you turn in the 60 capes aswell?
---
You absolutely dont NEED 2b worth of gear to do inferno if you are really good at the game.
---
Nice one mate! Well done! :D
---
What are you on about, play retention? Players have started to leave in quite large numbers recently.
---
I agree, but all I do rn is afk farm while I write papers for college.
---
I‚Äôll probably get my membership back soon. Especially now that I‚Äôm looking at these DPS calculators
---
Its just justiciar helm though? Most people use helm for inferno even if theyre not doing justi tank method
---
This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for! Thank you.
---
Yeah because PvMers aren't toxic.
---
I agree I would also quit if I lost millions of gp you do not lose items in wow and other mmo. Also it takes forever to grind for a twisted bow and other gear. the servers of this game are not stable enough to even have brutal mechanics but I do respect other players opinions
---
Torags hammers level 70 crush
---
Not one hand but there are some
---
Wait a minute, if you don‚Äôt give out your account information that nobody should know like your email or name or something like that you can‚Äôt be hacked? Fuck me it‚Äôs almost like everyone getting hacked is just dumb and doxes themselves
---
Rumour has it, when you try and photoshop a picture of Ash, the app automatically uninstalls. Seems legit to me.
---
Exactly this.
---
if u tell some1 to git gud that means they are bad. And if they know they are bad they know what to work on u feel me homie?
---
This would be WAY too OP lmao no support
---
Well you said yourself that there are over 5000? Obviously they‚Äôve put effort into it otherwise there would only be a few hundred, no?
---
The supply is going to be the supply in this case. You‚Äôre either going to RWT for exclusively better rates or you‚Äôre going to sell bonds at whatever rate they‚Äôre offering. An extra mil on a $7 bond isn‚Äôt going to change a whole lot when RWT is at 60 cents per mil. It‚Äôs literally half price.
---
2FA on email, authenticator, safe password and youre fine. Also, dont run around telling people recovery information (first membership, payment methods etc.) and dont brag about having billions of gold.
---
MOAR!!
---
Love the colors
---
Hmmm.. I'll have to look into that. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
i mean i usually end up playing on 2-3 accounts most of the time so the only issue with venoming would be cost but im sure i could manage it ill try just doing controlled for now till i hit 90 str if its not moving enough then venom it is :D
---
Dwh upgrade perhaps? Untrade ofc
---
It's definitely both ways.
---
You are right. I should have stated "primary" crush weapon since the hasta's stab bonus is +85 and it's crush bonus is +65. Thanks for the feedback.
---
My friend lent me all the seasons on dvd
---
&gt; Well. It is over it would seem. My old woman left me.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; She was from a conservative family. So, she hated conservatives! Haha. We were both VIRULENT Bernie supporters. We met in the middle of 2015. Love at first sight (we both HATED Trump, so a lot in common).
---
&gt; She never let my unrelenting support of the (soon to be) President get between us. My passion for politics and Sanders, she said, is what attracted her to me. She let it slide when I missed a date for a rally, and when we postponed moving in together in 2016 so we could fight the uphill battle with donations.
---
&gt; But now it is over.
---
&gt; When she found out I spent our emergency fund on a donation to the Sanders campaign for 2020, she FREAKED out. I tried to explain that every dollar counts and that Bernie doesn't get those giant corporate donations like other Washington fat cats, but she didn't care. All she cared about was the money. Money, money, money.
---
&gt; I told her we needed to stop Trump at any cost, and she agreed... But she just wouldn't stop crying. I showed her the support he was getting, the upvotes, his rally crowd... But it didn't really help. She said it wasn't about Sanders, it was about us.
---
&gt; But as far as I'm concerned, me and Bernie are a package deal. She knew what she was getting into. The wallstreet scumwads aren't crying, they are winning.
---
&gt; So, after the whole emergency fund dispute, we made up for the time being. But then our car broke down. The fix up was $1300. And we didn't have no money to go for.
---
&gt; I borrowed money from her dad (who she doesn't speak to because of political disagreements, he is pro-life, we are pro-abortion). And she FLIPPED.
---
&gt; I told him not to tell her, but she saw the bank statement and FUCK. She is gone to her friend Jason's house and I'm here festering in my own misery and filth. I'm lost without her. 2020 feels worlds away, and I don't know what to do.
---
&gt; I've put all the time and money I have into the Sanders campaign in the past few years, and even now when he is running again, I feel hollow inside. I never expected such a betrayal from the woman I love. And for my political beliefs? I feel disgusted and betrayed.

Thats actually mindblowing, should be front page news
---
I hope your main gets hacked to make you understand the situation.  We all know that hacks come from people leaking their own info almost always in unintentional ways.  The goal of account security is to mitigate the risks of loss assuming that an occasional mistake will happen.  In fact, ‚Äúmistake‚Äù is the wrong word since there are a myriad of ways that your info can be stolen, even if you are computer savvy and put a good amount of thought into protection.  Customer support means supporting your customers, even if they do something unadvisable like clicking a convincing phishing link or using the same password for a third party website that got hacked for their osrs password.
---
Tl;Dr
---
You‚Äôre an asshole who thinks that since you haven‚Äôt been hacked that it‚Äôs okay to victim blame everyone who has been.
---
First, you just need Priest in Peril. Second, you could avoid doing the quest through a glitch. Watch his Huanted mine video.
---
Glad to hear that! I hope ya‚Äôll are doing great.
---
They could overlook how blizzard/activision did to their bottling prevention or they could simply ask them how to fix bottling situation. It couldn‚Äôt hurt to try. Otherwise, we can watch osrs to slowly fall apart and lead its to death. Is this what we want?
---
Yep that's true. This system would only hurt player retention even more.
---
It does not drive people away. It increases a lot of people's enjoyment. Risk creates a tense adrenaline fix
---
Oh here we fucking go there‚Äôs always the cunts that feel like they have to weigh in that they are better at inferno, just gz the man dammit
---
It me
---
no inferno attempts in this vid, I'll tune back in uhhh, perhaps in 2020.

Defender doesn't work, but the whip actually does. You're good to go.

I only want to fight those who want to fight back. I like edge style of pking and I find that easily in bh/ pvp worlds. I dislike nhing/bridding and most of my accounts for pking are low prayer(no overheads)

It's a buyable that maxes out in a few hours. It's literally about the money

just ground it out for the first time. finished it in one day but holy shit was it aids. wanted to die the whole time but just kept saying "one more round just one more round."

ive never been to good at prayer flicking  jad was hard enough due to my horrible internet XD but ive done a few runs with friends at gwd duradel never seems to assign me anything good though :(

Bro I legit thought it was attack this entire time my bad.
---
Damn, even better
---
bro you should delete this im honestly embarrassed for you
---
Says the guy filming a screen
---
It's closer than you think since cudgel gets the aggressive style which (iirc) is a invisible +3 str bonus while the hasta gets controlled for a +1 str bonus. The difference of 3 str bonus is still noticable but it's not always gonna be a higher max hit whereas the 5 difference would be. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on this as this has been my understanding of combat styles and str bonus for a while.
---
Huh, I swear I tried this onetime and it required a bank pin, which surprised me. Maybe it was required to set up 2fa?
---
Got it as well yday at 3kc during my slayer task
---
this man is a genius dunking on me with that math :o
---
Don't forget they changed values from alch value to g.e value. So the most valuable items are kept regardless.

Age of empires 1 definitive edition is already out as well

If people would stop using them, they would all go away also...
---
holy shit I thought this was a trolling Jad post with the justicar and inferno cape. I was like "this dude really waited in there for like 3 hours" lmao gratz
---
Yeah 25% would be good.
---
Considering a massive amount of the playerbase cant/dont do them, yes. 
---
Theres a reason why the gear is so expensive, hadn't dropped in value much since the prices stabilised on release, the pieces slowly trickle into the game. 
---
Also, inferno still has less than 1k completions IIRC.
---
The game hardly DC's what are you on about?
---
CC filled with drama and people getting scammed constantly loaning each other high tier items and surprisingly getting hacked while borrowing gear 3/10 would not recommend, the fact most of their users come from this sub should tell you something. Although if you are looking to learn high level pvm fundamentals and mechanics I would join, just don‚Äôt loan gear or get too close.
---
Jagex should just make 1 or 2 worlds with the old death mechanic. Play on it at your own risk
---
Rioting in the streets should be a last resort when people stop listening like what is happening now in HK. Right now my representative is listening, it's just that more than half of the people talking are for something completely different. That's what I mean when I say that people don't see it as a legitimate concern. 
---
People are more than twitter warriors. Boycotting is a legitimate form of protest. I'm just not an actual warrior either.

It‚Äôs kind of up in the air as it‚Äôs completely dependent on the clan update. However, I believe in the most recent stream they said their goal is next summer. There‚Äôs just a lot of work particularly from the engine team that needs to be done before anything formal can be said.

Rigour is amazing, but the bonuses DHCB gives are better. I'd buy DHCB and save for rigour. 
---
That only applies if you're just camping Vork though.
---
If you are doing other ranging bosses, get rigour.
---
That is indeed an interesting question. You might pose it to ash on twitter and if you do, please let me know what he says.
---
Why does god hate you so?
---
Exactly. There's something really awesome about ironman mode making you do things for specifics instead of looking at gp/hr and choosing the highest number available.
---
I made mine a few years ago and can't imagine playing on a normal main anymore, though I do have an alt I smelt and slay with occasionally. But I can grind all day, everyday on my iron and feel like it is going towards something I can use or do in the future.

DHCB will get you slower kill times but more kills per hour due to the amount of kills per trip you can get. Rigour/blowpipe will be faster kill times, but less kills per hour. Rigour investment is nice because it's useful in almost all PvM situations. DHCB is usually only for Vorkath and sometimes Olm, but can be sold for reinvestment. 
---
Personally, I'm going to invest in Rigour first.
---
Play it every day at work.

I think no account can be hacked if u dont "hack" it urself (go click phishing links etc), but sometimes there can be shit going on, like last year i lost 20b and it was fucking J Mod leaking my bank pin and shit for rot like wtf, but 99.9999999999% of the time, its ur own fault for getting hacked

Nobody is forcing you to participate in that aspect of the game. You are not entitled to a free 99 in Runecrafting just because you can't be bothered putting in the hours. Stop trying to diminish the achievement of others to suit your incompetence and laziness. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The peak of selfishness and hedonism right here folks!

cannon in hosidius by the sand crabs, blowpipe by the monastery using an ardy cape, teleport back hosidius to add cannonballs, repeat
---
Was when siphilis and plagues where around so you got some rather disturbing art back then. You get imagery like this because often sex was viewed with death. That's why it was bad to have many partners, sex outside of marriage ect.
---
No one ever explained why it was a sin, or seen as demonic or evil, so the tradition just goes on and becomes more mystical then practical once we start hitting the age of modern medicine.
---
The imagery here is was all chosen with intent. The size of his penis, the fact he's a demon wheeling his penis around on one of those corpse wagons. The lady shreeking in fear/disgust.
---
How much exp do you think you get per hour? I feel like unless I was looking at my screen every 15 seconds or using sounds, I would lose a ton of time mining essence blocks and end up with like 15k exp/hr max.
---
So why wouldn't you pick up the log?
---
that would be tyrannical ring
---
*Harvard wants to know your location*
---
did u get the pet?
---
The game should not be balanced around iron men or ultimate iron men. That‚Äôs why we have shitty things now
---
You do? It goes straight to your inventory which inclines you picked up the log?
---
Nah I agree with you. I also think we should add a skill where you just have to click in the same spot for 300 hours straight. Who cares if it's fun or adds anything to the game, it's *achievement!* Stop devaluing my future achievements!
---
This is one of those pics that gets better the longer you look at it. Bravo!
---
hmmmmmm
---
yeah the elite frequency legit surprised me
---
The main reason people get their accounts breached despite all the security measures in place is the one thing Jagex has no control over: Email. Rather than complaining that Jagex's account security sucks and whining about no authenticator delay, maybe you should try securing your associated email a little better.
---
On the real, I've already tried the whole homelessness thing, wasn't my vibe. As fun as it is banging a bunch of crystal and H in random port o potties and chillin behind dumpsters, I've decided to live my life as a boring regular person now. 
---
Crazy how in a years time you can go from playing "will I get hep c today?" With old used needles to quitting smoking and being super pumped about getting your blood pressure back down to normal lol. 
---
As sad as it is, osrs has probably been like my #1 hobby in my first year of sobriety and has helped me a ton. I picked it back up around this time last year and didn't really think I'd stick with it that long or get that far. I mostly was just playing it as a time killer in my treatment center, until I found out one of my friends I had made at rehab also plays. Next thing you know, I'm buying members and putting my old account to shame and blowing 12 year old mes mind. 
---
So yeah lol I've been putting my life back together bit by bit for the past year and a computer is on the list, albeit not very high up.
---
Its mostly used in high risk fighting but u definitely come across them in BH as well. Its pretty obvious unfortunately jagex takes no action unless they livestream themselves doing it like one guy
---
You need the mirror or v-shield.
---
Zammy hasta is a nice choice of yours. Id use fire cape over myths cape against the basilisks.
---
Your gear seems good. Change the karils top for a piece of melee armor and use protect magic prayer.
---
Ranged is also a great option. Safespotting with protect magic.
---
Yup. With Scythe/tbow a lot of pvm bossing gear is 1.5b+.
---
Equal to about 300-400 hours of high end pvm. Lose this to server instability? Nty.
---
Aside from this I would expect new looting bots to camp every single boss area ever, waiting to loot.
---
During the old death mechanics people didn't have 1b+ in PvM gear with them. And most places that you can die in already have an item pick up service.
---

---
All thos 99's and only 53 CON Jesus, get a pool and portals already. I'm sure you can afford it and you will only regret not doing it sooner
---
You're missing the entire point of the account security debate.  We know this account won't get hacked.  The problem is that sometimes people do make mistakes.  There needs to be processes in place to help limit the effect these mistakes can have, such as adding a authenticator delay to give people time to react to getting hacked or some sort of item reimbursement for those who do get hacked.  Sure, it might be their fault, but they don't deserve to lose absolutely everything they've worked for in this game because of one mistake.
---
I absolutely am worried about all those things and more with pking.  Back in ‚Äò10, there was a brilliant solution since they could effectively randomize your drops.
---
Every 30 min you spent in the danger zone with risk got you 25%EP (worth around 500k in loot).  Every time you died, your DP increased by the amount you lost.  Every drop you got decreased the DP by the amount you got but couldn‚Äôt go below 0 and had an unknown max.  The formula was something along the lines of expected drop = EP*2,000,000 + DP/10
---
This meant that so long as you stayed in the dangerous zones and maintained a positive or neutral KD, you would profit around 1m/hr.  If you maintained a negative KD, you would break even from much more generous drops but your EP wouldn‚Äôt bet you profit.
---
This encouraged noobs to learn to pk since it was effectively free to learn and they could make a profit if they were decent.  The system was also hard to abuse because you had to lose at least 75k to get a drop and if you‚Äôre DP got too high, you would get less than 75k per kill.  They also had a trade limit preventing people from suiciding to alts to boost DP and trading the loot back.
---
I know there are a lot of reasons why we can‚Äôt do this in 07.  The fixed drops make loot randomization impossible and this tweaking the expected value also impossible.  Free trade allows for suicide abuse.  And the influx of bots and gold farmers means anything exploitable will be abused to high heaven.  
---
But that doesn‚Äôt mean we should just give up.  There has to be a solution which allows pking to be modestly profitable across more skill levels and break even at the start.  And until we take the time to figure it out, we‚Äôre sticking murdering defenseless PvMers.

Right click the door to the boss

&gt;I actually double majored in Information Systems and Computer Science. Not only do I manage and create integrated security systems within internal apps for different companies sometimes, but I studied and still research as a hobby many security tech stack trends.
---
&gt;Understanding the vulnerabilities of 2FA and other systems like captchas and different encryption implementations is part of my actual job. I even helped teach people about good password policies back when I attended college just because of how rampant misinformation is.
---
None of which is relevant since this isn't a discussion about Jagex's password policy, their storage methodology, brute forcing of passwords, nor Jagex's rate limiting to counter it.
---
It's not a discussion about 2FA either, nor Jagex's implementation of it.
---
It's a discussion about the **recovery system** and Jagex's implementation of it. The recovery system which conveniently trumps all other forms of security - i.e. it disables and removes 2FA, resets and changes the password, and resets and changes the e-mail registration.
---
Your professional experience with the aforementioned (and irrelevant) aspects of Jagex's security model is moot. 
---
I think you'd also be surprised to know how little of a gap there is between us when it comes to computer security and cryptography--which again is basically irrelevant in this particular discussion.
---
I, by personally knowing multiple ex-Jagex employees, know more than you. I, by knowing at least as much if not more than you about that process and the process of unraveling someone's identity using leaked and cracked databases, am in a better position to speak on this matter than you. You'd be wise to listen instead of dismissing it based on your effectively irrelevant education.
---
Nor raiding for that matter
---
I did, thank you.
---
Had to look that up. Jesus a little demon man running around the Forrest you can blame whenever someone gets raped or unexpectedly pregnant.
---
Some of those myths or fork lore really creep me out lol.
---
New account, pvp account, zerker, etc.
---
I don't understand. Please explain.
---
maybe like 25-30k? I don't really care about the rates though, any amount of carefree rc xp is good to me. i get at least 150k every work day.
---

Shit sorry, I meant to say nests not logs lol. The clue geodes should, in your theory, fall to the ground as well. Seeing as they would pop off of a rock unexpectedly.
---
33m xp on nature runes only, no pet. Help

Two days ago in NA. I would have lost 1.7b in equipment.

My man, that, uh, that is the opposite of a shriek in disgust. She‚Äôs clasping her hands near her face and looking at it gleefully.
---
Luckily this was just a throwaway email, but the website says one of my emails has been pwned from a website for pwned emails before. Abusewithus or something.
---
This is a great idea actually
---
your mom lol :')
---
Yep the only change to death mechanics should be to make it like rs3s.
---
Good job dude! I really want to try it out too but a bit intimidated.. Did you watch any guides before you gave it a shot?
---
They lose all of the money people don't spend by boycotting. If someone decides to cancel their sub and play a different game instead they lose money.
---
One of my friends plays strictly mobile now and we played LMS with a few other friends and we both got to the final and he ran me out of food this would definitely tilt in favour of mobile players
---
Actually at 80 you can unload a final inventory. Stops accepting at 81. Minor difference but 27-27-26-28 works so that's one more ore I can be lazy about.
---
iunderstoodthatreference.gif
---
Figuratively and literally at this point.
---
I got my rc pet @ 67 rc. Im on my way to 99rc, will you keep rcing for the cause?
---
A stringer perhaps
---
I fucking love the glory animation, nice job OP
---
thanks made me spit out my coffee
---
Same :/ I'd enjoy catherby i think. Smaller town, lots of fishing, a mountain nearby for snowboarding... i bet the climate is nice
---
Take it one level at a time. I sat for a level then got up for 20-30 minutes and sat back down for the next one. repeat till 77.
---
we don't even need more gold sinks
---
can we please do something about the slayer cape emote too??? plz
---
If people stopped bringing their entire banks when they did clues we would be left alone. Literally spade clue and dds is all you need except for the lava dragon isle master emote.
---
Stop drinking, stop drugs.
---
Start working out 3 times a week, run, gym idk.
---
List things u are grateful for, doesnt matter how small.
---
Try to enjoy life. It's a great thing if u put the time into it.
---
It honestly got annoying by the 3rd one.
---
It's close enough for the level you got it at, better than just saying the droprate because it's meaningless. yes it's a big number but the resources/hour are also way higher than bosskills.
---
‚ÄòPro abortion‚Äô sounds like a troll to me
---
That sooooo lucky oh man I would have shit. I know what I did for level 53 rock golem.
---
Does drinking a sara brew drain your stat boost from a divine potion?
---
Never change Prez, amazing as always
---
but can you remember the last time you dc'd?
---
people going to hate it though but i like it.. Shit on rs3 all ya want this mechanic is decent
---
I don‚Äôt remember all of the music I listened to while playing, [but one in particular](https://youtu.be/nv7OzIbdm4Y) stands out.
---
Stonks tho

Congrats

this hit differently :-S

what city would you live in?

If your account doesn‚Äôt get hacked, then I have reason to believe OSBuddy flags accounts that have been away for awhile and then sends the information that has been typed into the client to people in order for them to hijack accounts. I‚Äôve had 2 accounts hacked while using OSBuddy, but using runelite or the vanilla client in the past I haven‚Äôt.
---
yall acting like having a 100m bank is anything much
---
Commissions. How much
---
99 till first in name. 32 without seeing anything
---
Giant pouches mate. They degrade pretty quickly though.
---
Hardcore phishers*
---
more..? Are you claiming OSRS economy is fine and doesn't need any form of an extra gold sink, or am I failing to see your sarcasm?
---
I‚Äôm at ~285 kc with one in my name, which was under 50 kc too
---
I wouldn't do it on mobile for a first cape unless you're a mobile-only player, but anyone who's killed a few jads should be fine.
---
Not even 35-50 lol probly more like 20 unless he was using dragon darts while learning and also getting to zuk every attempt
---
Rc good. I didn‚Äôt get the pet during my go at it and he wanted to spite me with it but he got rekt too.
---
I think you need to put 1b on it for someone who knows what they are doing to go after it...
---
13m exp is nowhere near max
---
Best nostalgia trip ever is that Microsoft will be releasing a HD Remake of AOE2 this year. You can actually play again with modern graphics!
---
He is, as far as I know and I don‚Äôt believe he moved to the US and even if he did it still makes this whole thing that much more insane.
---
Seems like a meme lost but I genuinely think this person has issues
---
There are better things you can do for gp with the account at that point.
---
Whoever thought the original dress picture is white and gold has vision problems

No worries man I had the same assumption previous also

Got two by like 91

Both of which are essentially someone getting your password from you. Accounts are secure, people are not.

Let me buy a private world for 11ü¶Äs a month with the wilderness blocked off

I think that‚Äôs a very over-simplified claim, but what does this have anything to do with the ‚Äúhypocrisy‚Äù mindset I was criticizing earlier?
---
Gain double xp for the passive weight training
---
Everything changed when server problems attacked!
---
I think the devs mentioned a slayer cape emote rework in the past? I‚Äôd be down for it
---
Post max we both will be back for it
---
I'll do it, but I charge upfront.
---
Nah, my friend convinced me to do MM1 when I was a member previously. Rough quest, but worth it. And fun in hindsight
---
Funny thing is I couldn‚Äôt even load reddit or ig but osrs np. This was on a united flight.
---
Dude that‚Äôs fucking sick. Very well done.
---
I disagree. If it is like you say, then what is the point in it even existing?
---
no
---
Plug it into a dps, but at vorkath void is basically bis 100% of the time
---
There's 3 seasons up on Canadian Netflix.
---
I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a student and I feel like even when I‚Äôm doing really AFK stuff I won‚Äôt focus 100% on the subject and I learn less. I rather study a bit harder, but faster, and then free up some time to actually play.
---
The age of empires 2 Definitive Edition will also be available on steam as of the 14th of November!
---
I think the original AoE Definitive Edition is now also available on steam :)
---
looking to see if its even possible to get my account back
---
The real reason for wilderness pvm isn't necessarily to give pkers a defenceless Target to kill. The true goal is to create hotspots that are likely to attract many pkers who would then theoretically fight each other.
---
It's *your* fault if a database leak happens
---
Excuse my wtf
---
Not with that attitude.
---
What about if you can insure your items for 10% of what they are and if you ever die that NPC will have the item and it will be uninsured. While also limiting the amount of insured items a person has to 10.
---
"Devs not gonna do dev work."
---
Yeah! Why even have devs tbh
---
Dont bring all of it, then? "Only bring what you're prepared to lose" used to be one of the core tenants of the game. Its risk vs. reward. If you dont want to lose 1.5b in gear, then dont bring all BiS.
---
Only bring what you're prepared to lose.
---
It's pretty irrelevant
---
Not everyone that knows how to "hack" is malicious, if there was a serious problem then a benevolent "hacker" might take the opportunity to show that yes, there is an issue.
---
"hack" is in quotes because the "benevolent hackers" are probably professionals such as cyber security experts and not just hackers.
---
i think i have 50m worth of it piled up in my bank somewhere lol
---
I love Mod Ash
---
As if you need runelite after 47k clues
---
Dam bro start bossing for a boss pet, I just got graardor at 2211 kc an I‚Äôm still on cloud 9

I love the monkey head

No

&gt;the virgin distance fighter vs the chad melee only fighter 
---
Level up your skills overall. You have 99 strength but not the requirements for like almost any of the good content for your melee stats.
---
Barrows gloves, void, fire cape.
---
What concerns me most is all these slow skills with ok levels but then like, 4 cooking.
---
Yeah it's easy to not get hacked until your info gets sold by a staff member under the table to hackers, lol.
---
No actually you completely break your own logic lol
---
sigh  
---
I came here to say this lmoa
---
Get off the estrogen pills and dw osrs ain‚Äôt going nowhere, easy money for jagex servers won‚Äôt close till the government kills the internet in the event of Armageddon
---
if your account was hijacked, macrod on then banned and your "i was not on the account while it was macrod on" appeal fails that means jagex already looked into it, regardless of who clicked that appeal button no? why would it matter who appealed?
---
People who say this is feel like they are the types of people who just want to camp outside bosses to make money off of death of other players and not do the bosses themselves. The trade off of decreasing the time you have to recover is  less people are going to go do bosses increasing prices of items. They want prices to be realisitic to casual scapers where if tassey were 50m instead of 30m they will loose motivation and quit. They want to keep players to think they can reach there goals. Its  hard fora a new mid level player to think of the time ill take to save up for 1 50m item, while there is a huge risk of them losing there already small bank.
---
Nah not unless you do what I did amd only mined volcanic ash in lova. Too lazy to get my mining level up to make armor but it probably would have been faster tbh
---
Isn‚Äôt it just 1-(4999/5000)^X, X=number of kills?
---
So for three kills it‚Äôs 1-(4999/5000)^3 = ~3/5000.
---
Basically, it‚Äôs easier to calculate the odds of it not happening and subtract that from 1.
---
Ah man that fucking sucks. I know how you feel. Everything weighing down on you and one good memory just makes you break. Back before OSRS came out I used to listen to the music tracks from RuneScape like Spirit and Harmony. They got me right in the fuckin feels but it was also kinda beautiful.
---
Me
---
It is true. Every case that comes on reddit ends up being that someone divulged information or it was compromised from somewhere. If this was not the case, then someone would've claimed the reward money (or biggest still, hacked Zezima's account)
---
Or it could have been a b2b2b2b2b2b goblin mail at goblins, wtf is your point?
---
Now this is the update Jagex needs
---
My first hellhound task at cerb I got 2 smoulering 1 eternal and 1 peg and didn‚Äôt make a 3rd of this. Damn lol
---
innit. I initially read it as a preview pic for DE and was waiting for it to buffer into proper quality.
---
big if true
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt one use sms for 2fa for email?
---
You have any tips for getting it to just 55 from 35 without losing ones god damn mind? Srry I am noob
---
This is the correct answer
---
What's the Ely for in the inferno?
---
Naw. I'll keep them
---
Nowhere near as bad as the Diary Cape
---
Alright, thanks for the recommendations.
---
&gt;What concerns me most is all these slow skills with ok levels but then like, 4 cooking.
---
Cooking just seems kinda useless unless you're on an ironman. I figured I'd wait till I had the money for 1-99 and then just train it in one go over the course of a couple weeks.
---
"Sorry, cat walked across keyboard."
---
I auto-alched my pure last year. ( my razor mouse had an option to spam click( i thought i was clever)  It got perm banned &amp; so did the account that i traded the natures/longbows from.  
---
Pretty harsh punishment id say :(
---
Graceful is one of the worst updates OSRS ever got
---
Recently? Not a whole lot of anything, tbh. 
---
I'll play the occasional few games of Overwatch, but for the most part I'm just enjoying the extra time for other activities. Spending more time with my daughter, making music, hanging out with friends etc etc
---
24 hours of being logged into the game. You could stay logged off for an entire year and no "in game time" would have passed for your character. So you would have 24 cumulative hours of actively being logged in on your account to get them.
---
I think getting 75 or 80 range will allow you to do Zulrah
---
90 range will allow you do Vorkath
---
Top 10 anime betrayals
---
Lol @ your friend ‚Äúty rngesus‚Äù saying Vorkath task sucks and you clarifying your first time Vork gear in the PMs.
---
No shit? Maybe he was thinking about a time in his life when he was happier or things were generally better, not just the game bringing him to tears. Think a little deeper, if you can.
---
So don't risk all your gear like that..?
---
What‚Äôs with the obby cape granite gloves discrimination
---
Good question. As far as I know, Krystillia is allowed to do so, because she has seen the wilderness. Like literally. She knows everything about the monsters in the wilderness (including all bosses there), has gotten every wilderness drop including the revenant stuff. Problem is, she wanted to sell her stuff for real money...RWTING, y'all fell me? That's why she is in a fricking cage, admiring every rcer that runs past her.
---
Its really not bannable? I remember some people freaking out when they released the statement. Is it not removing 3 actions to make it 1? Right click, drop down, click reset? Genuinely curious why you're so sure
---
Steel thy Shovelry!
---
What's so funny? If you forget your password you reset it using your email.. and that removes auth. 
---
The only time I legit had to recover my account is when my phone was stolen and therefore I couldn't 2fa into my email or account. Now I have the backup codes saved in my LastPass for situations like that as I learned my lesson
---
The Weiss patch‚Äôs graphical assets are a straight copy paste from the Trollheim patch, rendering priority glitches and all. You can easily verify that with any sort of object viewer.
---
Then tell people you got it from killing goblins in Lumbridge.
---
He is British no? Why does he care so much about the Bernie campaign to the point of ruining his life over it?
---
This is really good stuff man!
---
That would require reading comprehension levels they don't have.
---
People seem to forget a lot of good ideas in RS3 came from god ash himself.
---
It's gonna come off as a lie but I enjoy the rc runs, they abyss is click dependant enough to keep you busy but not busy intensive enough to stop focusing on the movie or what ever your doing.
---
Rsn: not at theGE if you ever need someone to talk to.
---
Cudgel was already introduced to fill the missing gap in crush weapons, and now we are asking for more lmao
---
Hell yeah I was completely skipping that patch until I realized there was a teleport close enough
---
Lol where tf did you get that
---
We need to add metallic black dragons and white dragons to the game pls
---
Ranarrs are more of a mellow 'in the couch" feel, while snapdragons are more heady or " snappy" more of a mental high.
---
Y‚Äôall fuckers addicted to reposting this shit ever day
---
I've always wanted to live in falador and go mine for fun in the dwavern mines
---
You should be sure. Ddos protection is exponentially more expensive than the attack costs. Even Blizzard, a much larger company, just suffers through them instead of preventing them and then attempts to take legal action later. Jagex can not stop it if someone actually wants to hit their servers offline.
---
Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime...
---
Cock &amp; Ball Torturescape.
---
Give me 3b and I'll do it then
---
Depends on if you can ‚Äúafford‚Äù the occasional loss that comes with rannar or not
---
The idea of looting other people's stuff is why we can't anymore. People would DDOS the world's whenever they saw someone in high risk at a place like bandos GWD, then loot their stuff when they inevitably die because of it. I'd rather have 2 minutes and the gear disappears instead of 5 minutes then other people can see it.
---
People have done it with ridiculous shit like no supplies, &lt;10m gear setups, and like 70 combat and shit.  You don't need a tbow.  Tbow+maxed just allows you to get it without being THAT good.  This is how endgame content should work.
---
You right Mr. Mordaut is pretty [THICC](https://i.imgur.com/gtmPowL.png)
---
Not really a suggestion more like a solution imo
---
That's pre much exactly how ya do it. Sort by quest points and pick out shortest to longest that you haven't done. You very quickly get down to the 1-2 QP rewards when you're higher qp
---
Wearing a f\*\*\*ing slayer helm!
---
Sigh...some people are just stuck on a loop with that I guess, so there's no use discussing it. Spend your time grinding expensive gear that you literally can't use, ever, because there's always a chance of a DC. Sure, that's totally reasonable, despite the fact that I cant think of another single MMO that's anywhere near that brutal.
---
Expect that in Maplestory you can do only one of the tasks displayed in the clip.
---
Also, we had OSRS, we had Classic WoW. Retro Maple when?
---
&gt;Is there a way to not work with the automated account recovery system?
---
no. have you played runescape since 2013? if you're an old player coming back then it is probably worth just making a new account. old school runescape looks like the same runescape you played in 2002 but this game came out in 2013 so if you haven't played since then, you definitely have no gear/stats anyway. your gear/stats carried on with the main game which we now call rs3.
---
&gt;Also why would kourend spider be attached to Morytania whatever the fuck lorewise. Makes no sense
---
to be fair a random plant boss in kourend has lore connection with another random plant in morytania
---
We need posters! Start an Etsy of rs art
---
You only have to kill one brother to loot the chest. But you would have to kill more skeletons/rats/worms if you want to increase your potentiometer for more runes. Also, any brother you haven‚Äôt killed can appear in the crypt as you are opening doors.
---
Not buying GP for me staking was the cancer.
---
Make an iron meme
---
So you did blood runes? I'm a bit confused because I'm going for 99 myself, I'm currently 94 but according to this calculator I'd only get 64 mil, which isn't really a whole lot, whereas Natures would get me 270 mil. 
---
I've done natures from 91-94 so far and I do feel like I'm going to/gonna get capral tunnel from it, so I am debating whether to switch to blood runes, which would be a lot easier but then I would lose 180 mil, and money is why I went for RC in the first place.
---
Grats on getting 99 though.
---
How long did it take to get to 99?
---
Takes away any temptation
---
450 blood runes? Lucky bastard
---
Best way to avoid this would be to just make an ironman
---
You could wait till group ironman comes out and play with your mates?
---
Nothing to loose, no one can see your kdr. Just set up your f keys and set up your inventory before you start
---
‚ÄúDue to no fault of your own‚Äù. If you brought more than 3 items you were willing to risk, knowing that disconnects are part of the game... that‚Äôs something you should be willing to accept. The normal game mode is dying because so many people are terrified of losing their items. Okay so you lost some shit? GRIND IT BACK. That is the game. If you just keep your things forever once you get them then the excitement dies very quickly.
---
Ultimates. My B
---
Direct buffing rather than balancing isn't QOL, and that's where we differ on this.
---
Fixing tap/F key inputs as far as the game interprets them is QOL/bug fix/integrity changing.
---
Allowing players to move all menu buttons to one side is QOL.
---
Allowing players to have two menus open at once, a feat no other RS player has ever achieved, is not QOL.
---
Ultimate. Sorry.

I got the head on my ironman :)))))

Internet thugs hurt feeling too ya know

pyramid is easy. u can also get rewarded with pharaoh's sceptre! at lvl 51, you can get to room 4.first go in, search saracophagus, then the chest in middle. from there attempt to pick locks on the doors. there are 4 in each room. only one of the doors allows access to a deeper room. do not loot the artifacts and stuff, as the lower room youre in, the less xp you get. so your goal is to move the deepest you can at your lvl, and loot the artifacts. so after you reach the next room which requires lvl 31 thieving, same thing search saracophagus, and chest. move onto next room that requires lvl 41 thieving. here, due to the time it takes to get there, u have time to loot this full room, including artifacts etc, then move onto the following room requiring lvl 51 thieving and looting everything there before your timer is up. you should get decent xp/h. if u loot a pharaoh's sceptre from saracophagus or chest, gz on making bank! its 1/1k from either or, essentially 1/500 per room.

Brutal bruh dragons. They don't do any damage instead jungleflux partners with Google then use your internet history to launch sarcastic personal attacks about your darkest secrets and mental health struggles.
---
I mean really you should max without seeing a single pet. Seeing em pre 99 except for maybe farming if you're just doing pet patches and not trees is lucky on its own.
---
Id beg to differ!
---
Hear me out! Revert to the old death mechanics BUT give players the option to keep the current ones by setting their account to EASY MODE. Easy mode players would keep current death mechanics but also have a large steaming diaper icon above there head permanently (like the pk skull) and next to their name in chat (like a pmod crown).  Problem solved, you‚Äôre all welcome.
---
Yes you can log out and take a break in between waves
---
I got mine at 42m xp which was just shy of sub 1k at the time. You got this mate :) doing all your pet patches?
---
You lucky bastard
---
ddosing would start back instantly if it went back to old death mechanics. it doesn't happen now and "you dont see it as much of an issue anymore" is because theres literally no point in doing it. Give them a reason to and it'll happen. 
---
We saw how much servers sucked when dmm tournament finals would happen, every single time.
---
There's no place like PoH
---
I‚Äôll have you know it took me 212 kills for my Vorki thank you very much
---
the guy who wrote the language for the original items died in a tragic linguistics accident
---
Magic stone create bad
---
Nope that's perfectly normal even if you trained from 1 to that 20m experience with pet being out and pet patches 
---
Seeing people be disappointed in no pet before hitting 99 hurts. It's stupidly lucky to get it in any skill that quick. Farming is one of the few you can heavily modify by just training with pet patches.
---
Mechanically it's not hard, but it is gear/level restricted. You will not be able to farm many kills/hr with low stats and poor equipment.
---
If you‚Äôre just AFKing the combat I strongly recommend you to put a few hours when u get mems and unlock fossil island. Ammonite crabs are the best / most afk combat xp AND they drop fossils for free XP lamps and prayer XP later. 
---
Also every hour you can do your birdhouses for the fastest hunter XP in the game and it only takes a minute. You can get expensive seeds and a consistent profit of bird nests every time you need a quick break.
---
Real unpopular opinion : death mechanics are fine and a good modernization to the game. Introducing other ways to sink items like kraken tentacle is a better method.
---
The obsession with old death mechanics seems to be a nostalgia obsession. Players simply don't want to lose all their progress from one death.
---
Old death mechanics will punish newer players more heavily than older players, as newer players will die more frequently. We want to implement a system that reduces the wealth hoarded, not those just getting started.
---
Oh I don't even think you'd get it in 200m of just herbs. It's rate on a herb patch is insane
---
Same here.
---
Damn I'm jealous of the 4 elites. I've had some solid luck lately at cerb with prims, but ive seen 3 elites in 1200 KC haha
