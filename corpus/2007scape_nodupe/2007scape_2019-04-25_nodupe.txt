Ironic from some cunt who doesn't actually cite sources himself and probably relies on Fox and Breitbart for the bulk of his "facts".
---
I can give nonresponses too.
---
He replied to a tweet that said that the game didnt feel like it has ever needed a skill in the last 6 years to feel complete and that he fully agreed with it. Basically he doesnt believe a new skill should be introduced to osrs no matter what it is
---
That's a bold opinion to be posting in the new episode thread
---
You’re a madman... I love it!
---
Did you actually look into the report at all?
---
nice
---
didn't hide hp. Thanks for the account

Why are you skilled then

This screenshot is real.

 I Completed 1 of them, expecting the completed steps count to reset to 0 on completion. It didn't, I completed the second clue in 1 step.
---
I'm doubting you did considering you somehow managed to read exactly the opposite of what was written.
---
baby implings do drop bowstring iirc, but u need crossbow string
---
Could have been pking before? Use your brain please!
---
Be careful. Having an overflow on stupid can be dangerous even if it produces genius.

🦀JAMFLEX 🦀 WON'T 🦀 ADD 🦀 CROSSBOW 🦀 STRINGS 🦀 TO 🦀 IMPLING 🦀 DROPTABLE 🦀
---
That's what you'd think without scrolling down.
---
that guy said too much but he's right that you should've just checked the wiki. osrs has one of the better maintained wikis for a game. actually even just googling your question "osrs short bow vs composite bow"  has old archived reddit threads with answers. basically plop your question into google first before posting, you'll likely find an answer there.
---
already being done, i think there are about 5 different droptables in total
---
The majority are scammers looking to get you to buy their stock on the GE
---
how tf is there lens flare
---
Maybe i don’t understand completely but why doesn’t Swampletics just use Mazchna slayer task? He usually gives mortytania slayer tasks to begin with?
---
I did the exact same thing LOL still havent bought mine back yet.
---
You too are just a clump of cells. I'm a clump of cells. Everyone is a clump of cells. Have you really never if your life been outside of your echo chamber long enough to have had this pointed out to you? Anyways, those "clumps of cells" are often killed when they have arms and legs. Those "clumps of cells" physically resist the instruments used to slaughter them. Those "clumps of cells" fight for their lives and it's all visible on ultrasound. 
---
Anyways, your side of the isle now argues for partial-birth abortions and even after-birth abortions. You're perfectly okay with a baby being a few inches from being completely outside of his or her mother before he or she is killed? You're okay with a child up to two years of age, the age your side of the isle argues is when abortions should then become illegal, being euthanized? 
---
How do you sleep at night? No, seriously. You go to bed saying "We're the good guys!" while supporting a child that's 1 year, 364 days, 23 hours old being killed because the mother changed her mind. It's sickening that you don't have the decency to jump off a bridge to rid the world of yourself. You're evil.
---
Yeah, I'm in a similar boat, but after base 50's I focused on combat stats for a bit. Reeeeeallly would like to knock out Monkey Madness one of these days.
---
No, I'm attacking you for being a historically illiterate dipshit who's just making up nonsense, and drawing parallels between what fascist Germany did and what the fascist-leaning party in the US did. You're saying "fAsCiStS wAnT tO bAn GuNs JuSt LiKe ThE lEfT!" and I'm pointing out where you're fucking stupid and wrong. 
---
Nazis: Disarm minorities, encourage gun ownership for white Germans.
---
Republicans: Literally the same thing except for white Americans.
---
Carrying out your lawful, constitutionally protected right to bear arms in America **will** get you murdered by the police (I.E. the enforcement arm of any fascist state) if you're not white. Afterwards, the pro-gun, pro-constitution, pro-freedom party will say you had it coming.

I never really brought about having a end goal. I just enjoy making money and killing stuff. I'm not really into looking cool. like with a pet .  Im.not saying I dint want a pet. But it's not really I goal I strive for

Bro it takes like 30 seconds for someone at jagex to completely screw the pooch, be patient my dude
---
Came here to say this. One of my favorite CC's to hang out in.
---
It’s still 11$ this month
---
I’d say that’s very unlikely because the haunted mine was released a couple years before the crossbow update
---
one of my childhood friends' brothers had this happen to him, it was done by a kid at his school who bragged about doing it and thought he was a badass 9 year old
---
the funny thing is, he managed to recover THAT guy's account somehow? and he used to play on it for a few years before he stopped RS, so in essence they just traded accounts? this was such a bizarre situation, it happened in maybe 2003-2004 or so, and I don't think they gave either of their accounts back out of spite
---
the funniest thing was how 2000s the usernames were, something like "bballplayer22" and "surferkid101"
---
Lol im jk idc

The laws of the free market dictate that if there's such a demand for more right wing opinions there would be more than one right wing news program. What are you, a communist?

If this was a America, the house would have just been swatted and the unarmed 62 year old man shot 8 times in the face by police, later leading to paid vacation.

Trust this guy he definately wont steal all your shit

---
it was a bad joke, calm down high iq.
---
Nobody should have ever been able to access my email in my case, they got the info somewhere-I'm not sure how it happened though-but with how many issues of hacking in the game, its kind of hard to say Jagex is on top of the issue. I keep my info very close guarded and I don't download stuff other than the legit runelite client.

Cancer

Everyone’s jealous dude has 90bil and want to make sure he loses any chance at getting any help at all.
---
Pretty much, and once he's gotten the Whip that will be more viable for Ahrim anyway.
---
I will imagine he's going to spend a lot of time at Barrows in the future, he's going to want 99 mage for the added magic defence bonus and Barrows provides him with those runes, as well he will get a lot of coins from alching the barrows pieces which he will need to buy the Verzik's crystal shards as dying in the theater will require him to have 100k to reclaim his items which will mean he'll have to get 100k cash from Gargoyles every time he dies in the theater.
---
Or crazy idea here, you need to verify your email to stream, I doubt there would be as many, also phishing/scam stream reports shouldn’t make you click through 5 pages of options to get to it.
---
(Before I continue, I wish to make it clear that I wasn't meaning verbatim in my first response, and I was obviously running off memory. Now that that's said...)
---
I was actually very curious myself so I decided since I had extra merching accounts I might as well use one and go through the questions at the first door until I got to the one I roughly recalled. This is what I found.
---
SoS Door: "To pass you must answer me this: What is the best security step you can take to keep your registered email secure?"
---
Inputs:
---
1) Set up 2 step authentication with my email provider.
---
2) Have a complicated password set to my email.
---
3) Use an email address just for Old School RuneScape.
---
Answering 3 returns: "Wrong! Even if you dont use your email address elsewhere there is still a risk that somebody could access it."
---
Answering 1 returns: "Correct! Enabling 2 step authentication on your email means that nobody apart from you can access your email account."
---
What I take from this would be that even though it says the answer is wrong, it doesn't mean it doesn't help. My first response doesn't reflect this and I wish to clarify what I meant instead in my second response: QED that the answer was wrong. Secondly, I also recall there are other questions (at least one) in the SoS that have a primary "correct" answer and a different one as an "okay" answer, and still allows you to pass if you use that choice (so theres actually 2 answers that return the same thing as "correct"). This tells me, assuming the questionnaire is unbiased, that this question we are talking about should ALSO have 2 technically correct answers that let you pass. And yet it does not.

Staking 2

You can literally wear Justiciar to cheese it, and it's not nearly as difficult if you just wear Bcp+tassets while barraging nibblers for the insane ranged defense
---
I mean yeah, it's hard as fuck but there's strategies to overcome it.
---
It's Japanese from the anime I released with him on April 1. Translates to "Wetland Gymnastics". :)
---
Since that episode runelite has added a feature where they anonymously aggregate drop data, so a lot of the wiki is now updated with exact drop rates.
---
doing ecclectics is 2m an hour and that rate is entirely based on getting ranger boots.  
---
if you have the bank to shell out for imps until you hit rangers you will profit at that rate.  
---
if not imps, cannoning guards with falador diary or killing ice warriors with ROW (i) is the best alternatives afaik.

It might be crazy enough.... TO GET US ALL KILLED!

I literally clutched my chest and staggered backwards into the couch when I saw it.
---
...if this is an End Game spoiler I swear to God....
---
Serious question: are there any preventative steps i could take and tests I can run on my pc to safeguard my info and should I change some of my account info to ensure I won’t be hacked again? Serious answers please
---
Sure addiction is a mental illness but it's not comparable to depression. You can literally stop at will if you want, there's a reason why the term cold turkey exists. It's about not letting your mind be overpowered in the first place.
---
oh ya, forgot about the new clue items but it all comes out in the wash either way.
---
That's fucking stupid lol.
---
Snagged one of your dopamine shirts, great job on the design. Like you said, I won’t be embarrassed to wear it in public.
---
just pvm
---
i mean irons can just buy kills anyway?
---
That's cool. I hope you do some self reflecting since you can't justify your political party's fascist tendencies.
---
No New skills =\= no new content. There is plenty of content and even skills rebalancing and addition that can be done without shoving a whole new skill into the game. He isn’t against new things being added to the game. But runescape isn’t just pvm content. I’d rather they keep improving what they have instead of adding a ton of new stuff. The seed vault is a great example of added content that helps out existing skills and is good QoL.
---
You keep untradeables on death. The Vskirt was 0, barrows armor becomes tradeable again at 0.
---
haHAA
---
I mean, there statistically, provably are more democrats than republicans, and more people with no party affiliation than either group (and most nonaffiliated people lean democrat).
---
That’s like... your opinion man
---
1: I am self aware and capable of surviving on my own. A fetus is neither self aware nor capable of living outside the mother. It is no different than a tumor or parasite at that point.
---
2: Partial Birth abortions happen when the fetus is either already dead and has been, or the birthing process puts the mother at risk of dying. (The child usually doesn't survive in cases like this anyways)
---
3: After birth abortions are a right wing myth rofl
---
4: I sleep damned fine, knowing that I won't be the reason a woman is carrying the seed of her rapist around :)
---
to be fair fake digital goods worth potentially hundreds/thousands of dollars
---
I don't either, I don't have authenticator because I don't own a smartphone, but I'm not sure if it even would have helped if they could already get my info.
---
The biggest con is invalidating people's time that have already trained the skill. I couldn't give a fuck because I haven't trained RC. I do think the skill could benefit some diversity though. Overall I think we need a few more methods to train the skill that give it some variation. I know there's a few already, but maybe incorporating Runecrafting xp into a raid or a skilling boss could be a cool idea.
---
Genuinely curious, what was the original rationale for that mechanic?
---
Clutch af escape lol. Nice
---
What is turmoil? :)
---
You do realize you could swap this out with any other game, right? You could probably swap it out with any computer-based activity too... especially since your comment has almost nothing to do with RuneScape. Your entire comment could be for ANY political ideology. Change minorities to a bogeyman of your choosing. This isn't a right or left thing. It's tribalism and it's a plague.
---
Challenge them to a duel

You can 2fa email with just a phone number, which would have saved you.

Just heal off blood spells screw guthans

Yeah, use crop on leprechaun. Works with weeds, too.

it always looked like a bag of bones to me. doesnt even look like a pot lol
---
Player houses glided altar. Dragon or hydra bones? Any top tier really. 15-45 pray in 15 mins
---
I eff up on the prayers a lot 😂 but thanks
---
havent played this game since I was a kid 10-15 years ago. I'm not planning to spend 20 hrs a day clicking trees or doing quests - im looking to simply pk from time to time. there was nothing more satisfying back in the day than walking into wildy and spanking a noob with the gmaul spec.
---
I have access to a lvl 61 account that's 50 attack, 82 strength, 1 def, 31 prayer and 75 mage. I dont know how much things have changed since I last played but could I still gmaul spec ppl to death with that build? what is the current state of wildy like because the last time I played I think they got rid of it...
---
Sparc Mac was all about the plantations. No way he was in favor of cash only staking.
---
Petition to correct the weight to 420g
---
Wolves in the stronghold of security (haven’t tried other places) no longer drop wolf bones in members worlds. Only beginner clues. Unplayable
---
Ahh makes sense. You think haunted mine is now up to date? I mean dead content areas may still not be completed
---
2 accounts both banned for macroing? ...
---
Did you macro maybe?
---
The wildy/pk scene is very much alive.
---
Wait, so not even a full year after an actual JMOD hacks accounts, we're saying nobody at Jagex would or has hacked accounts?
---
What?
---
*vsauce intro music*
---
I’m so god damn happy I watched first
---
Split cus im not a piece of shit
---
Lol you should check out the ice Poseidon cc if you think this is bad
---
You might need some help.
---
I mean, I could say "the game feels complete without _____" for nearly every single big update OSRS has seen. 
---
Raids 1 and 2, DS2, MM2, Zulrah, NMZ, Zeah, various slayer bosses, etc. So yah, that is a stupid fucking reason for being against warding.
---
It's not his account anyway it's mine he stole this
---
You will always have bank on you, so risking it all on death adds to the challenge.
---
Then who was phone?
---
Lorewise?
---
yeah but it's pretty obvious when someone needs actual help. It's your own fault if you actually believe someone hit the buy limit on roast rabbit. If I see someone asking for like dart tips, battlestaves, addy bars, etc. I like to help those guys out. I appreciate the help myself when needed too. Some of the buy limits are total bullshit.
---
Tribalism. I had the same sentiment too. It's shameful that's an upvoted comment. It just shows how far gone most of us are.
---
Some ore is ready to be collected from the sack.
---
You can also bring a dragon crossbow switch to use special attack on jad. Does same thing as a chin with more dps if you need to focus on switching prayers and can't worry about switching back to blowpipe.
---
u ruined it u were supposed to say cancer
---
no source of crossbow strings
---
Frick those videos, I went an entire summer without RS because I got a toolbar virus that made my grandmas computer grind to a halt in my attempt to download Cheat Engine so I could do this myself.
---
I had all iron armor with an iron kite shield and Silverlight (which I just got back from one of the quest NPC) I'm just going to buy my armor again unfortunately
---
Dude for real thank you so much this will help me a ton.
---
looks pk ready to me, lets go mince some narbs g!

You didn’t say it either?

Thank you! I'd been trying to figure it out

You can get it the same price or less at Staples.

don't worry, he's easily making 6 figures even without streaming. He's being well compensated, as he should be.
---
As long as you don't have fremmy elite done the strat is to use lunar portal in poh, use the birds eye Jack bank teller to bank loot/resupply and then talk to another teller to be tele'd to fremmy marketplace because you aren't wearing your seal of passage on lunar isle
---
obviously youre ribbing but it is amazing hes managed to amass such an amount of gp in a now net negative activity. at this point i figure hes got house advantage; so much resources his foes will eventually just bust to him before he dries up

&gt; The type of person to run a bot farm is the type of person to brag the fuck out of anything they do.

Yes it can. I believe a friend was on one of em
---
I never justified that and even said I don’t condone what they did. You unfortunately, clearly, didn’t read the entirety of the comment.  
---
My point is that negative actions come with negative consequences regardless if it’s an online game or not.
---
don't buy chairs used that chair has been masturbated in
---
I mean the CIA thinks that so yeah.
---
in those scenarios its a little more sketchy
---
Currently working on getting my skills up to the min amount to complete all quests so if I want I can have the quest Cape
---
Only plan to do heroes, legends, lunar, mm 2 and ds2. Any others I should add to unlock more content?
---
Fuck that, i gave some kid a bloody nose for scamming me $150 worth of gp in high school, it's just like any other kind of theft. Although i wouldn't do it for being lured, that's fair play IMO.
---
This comment basically describes by situation exactly. Similar bank size, made the same fake recovery, got the same response.
---
When y'all get your bis that you're willing to obtain we should get some dudes to escort each of you out of Morytania/Karamja and make a whole scene of it. They'd escort you both to the duel arena for an epic live match streamed by both and then back to your respective zones.

Reassess your own 'responses'.

No but there is still no excuse for graduating to one of the big 3(Crack, Meth, Heroin). You have to know the difference between popping a few Percocet, to snorting higher mgs, to snorting/banging dope. Otherwise you're just a fucking idiot.

if youre looking to train range at all you could cannon dagannoths in the lighthouse. i trained from 70-95 range there on my pker and by 72 or so range i picked up a clue just to stop seeing them

Hey man I know you are already probably working with a graphic designer. But if you ever need any designs I got you!
---
True true, I wasn’t even considering those.
---
Warding was announced.
---
Sure does.
---
He is one of the first presidents to take a stand against China's unethical business practices--at least vocally. Threatening China with economic backlash is probably one of the only things that they will respond to. Granted, at this point it all seems like lip service and he really hasn't gone through with much of what he's threatened, but it's refreshing to see the issue is being addressed instead of being danced around.
---
Though the shit he says is absolutely retarded, I am glad to see a president who takes a stand against things instead of tiptoeing around things to avoid media backlash--he complains about it way too fucking much though.
---
Overall, I don't like him and I think he is a absolutely terrible leader diplomatically. But, I'm not going to delude myself and say that EVERYTHING he's done is awful.  He should really just stop talking so much, get the fuck off Twitter and quit manipulating stupid people into thinking everything that says something remotely negative about him is "fake news."
---
the majority of americans fucking hate american healthcare and complain about it constantly
---
It was probably fat ass's first time standing up in years from too much runescape and had a blood clot go straight to his heart and he confused a heart attack with feeling towards Settled.

I wonder why OP hasn't commented a single time yet.

---
Don't forget gargoyles also will drop rubies, just another way to get them.
---
Did you completely ignore my response? There's a baby boomer, then the internet meme "a 30 year old boomer". Nobody is denying baby boomers exist or saying they don't know what that is, you just don't seem to acknowledge the meme, which is what this was originally in response to.
---
Great idea
---
Man, I see this shit so much too. "You're a Russian bot" is the left-wing equivalent of "orange man bad."
---
If only people could confront opposing viewpoints without resorting to formulaic talking pieces
---
It's a nice run. Much quicker than running from the portal and as long as you're using a rune pouch should save you an inv slot or 2 for food or something
---
You shouldn’t have stolen anything(online game or not) to begin with.  So if that person decides to curb stomp you for it, whose fault is that?  Would be yours that it even happened to begin with for stealing someone’s shit.  How they act is irrelevant, but it remains your fault that you’re put in that situation.
---
You tried harder then EVscape tries to drag out videos to 10:01

I know, I sold for 170k but got 4.5mil I'll post a screenshot when I get home, I'm currently on mobile

"**no**"
---
If the value of runes crashes because people are actually training a skill in the game, then the fact that the market depends on people to not train the skill means that the skill is inherently flawed. It's not like more runes are being created per run, it just makes the skill not completely useless after its trained.
---
I definitely went this route lol
---
Get bored on main, stake bank,get cleaned, make an iron, 1200 total and 110 qp later and I'm enjoying my iron 10x more than I ever did my main
---
Did you read the person I'm responding to? Since you and everyone else responding can't seem to grasp that, I'll just quote it for you.
---
&gt;What is boomer?
---
  Why does searching for it say boomer is short for baby boomer (I know what that is) but urban dictionary says its a guy +30? Those things are radically differnet.
---
I was literally explaining the difference between a baby boomer and a boomer. I wasn't saying anything you implied, I was saying that the reason "boomer" returns that result on UrbanDictionary is because of the 30 year old boomer meme.
---
But yeah, I'm the spastic for not reading what I reply to. Not once did I imply a 30 year old boomer is a boomer, I only explained the relation and why that wound up in his search results.
---
What is this, I'm sorry, I suck.
---
Thanks for proving everything I just wrote.
---
Nah never wonder always know.
---
The potatoes.
---
This is true. Like I said it is refreshing to see it being brought to the table though. Like I said, I'm not a fan, but I will be objective about individual actions

Got the same on my first master, congrats!

Those were pretty much the exact kinds of accounts that most of the bots were. Appearing to be people of all ages, including boomers.

hey bro to learn i wanna try 6 way switch. what would it be? but when i get better what would be the 8 way switch? should i use vulnerability spell with a rune pouch? and what inv do i bring for 6 way switch and 8 way switch
---
Ok then thank you
---
i have a dx racer and i can honestly say "gaming" chairs are a straight up scam. the bucket seat design comes from actual race cars, but theyre not meant to be comfortable, theyre meant for you to stick to your seat while your making sharp turns and shit in a race. better off spending the same amount of money on a really nice office chair, which are designed for sitting comfortable over long periods of time
---
It’s just my opinion, but I feel as though the Inferno end goal isn’t really realistic. I’ve watched your series and it just doesn’t seem feasible for you to do unless you have a ton of experience with it already and even then it is Lille typing to be almost impossible with the best gear you can use. Do you have some hidden plans for that because as it stands it doesn’t seem realistic. Keep up the videos either way!

An ironman who can trade with other ironman? Hmmm sounds familiar

You would think, but the entire situation didn't add up, they unloaded his BP but left behind the darts, they left law runes.
---
the stuff they left behind was another 5 or 6m ontop yet they took the serp helm which was like 3.5m? at the time.
---
also his excuse to taking out the tbows was "Im flexing" literally flexing off stream to yourself at zulrah while using 3 tbows and a blowpipe?
---
Honestly i think he got a free pass because of how he blew it up and claimed it was a real hacking, if KempQ did the same thing about his RWT he probably would have got banned when he sold gold.
---
Even then unless your dumping billions they wont catch you for RWT, people in the CC i frequent have sold billions of gold through social media and have never been caught.
---
i like to give people the benefit of the doubt in this situation because getting hacked is one of the worst things that could happen to you in gaming, especially with runescape where jmods don't give a fuck and are to lazy to return items you lose.
---
getting hacked through your bank pin, and auth, and 2fa emails is so unlikely, sure they can recover your account but unless your afk for days they wont get though your pin, unless the dude had 90b in his inventory when logging out i seriously doubt this was a "hacking" 
---
all of this could be avoided if jagex actually had decent account security, like let me lock down my account and tie it to my cellphone like some 2FA things do, like i could give out my emails and a hacker could never even access them even if they tried short of somehow hacking my phone.
---
Its real
---
I know 😂
---
We have to assume
---
Would I be better off spending 5-10 minutes learning how to do bird house runs versus doing sallies? Basically, I am just grinding out to 70 hunter atm and want to know the fastest method, but if birdhouses are nearly equal or greater than sallies, I want to do them as sallies are all dropped and is just xp grinding, literally 0gp/hr.
---
Can't find one to ask so going with yes.
---
Rip account, you don’t even know how to change your password?????

doxing a gamer smh

Search it up the wiki has a great list that none of us can explain

Can someone explain how to do this this even dumber i am still confused D:

The Bedabin are the worst. Great heroin though.

Thanks again bud

What t shirt you got

Weight reduction for breaking the skirt. If he didn’t break it all the way it would add weight
---
Yup. Did 99 range there, imbued everything I needed and have herbs for days 3 months later. I used them for slayer pots. 64-90 slayer and I still have 600 prayer pots and a fuck tonne of everything else. Just checked, 9.8m not including the ranarrs and ppots
---
Last month was special because it happened right at the end tho

Like adding the rope spawn for another uim

Tldr ITS A NUTT

Shut

Explains why he voted for the busted can of biscuits

I down voted this to keep the number at 69
---
You can get 70, with dragon bones, for about 6.7m on a gilded altar. Half that if you use the chaos altar and don't get pked.
---
Wyrm bones are actually more xp/gp but would be a bit slower. getting to 70 with that on a gilded altar would be 5.2m
---
We pay we gay!

---
He might even believe it himself that not being maxed has nothing to do with his conclusion, but it obviously has some sort of effect on his decision even if he admits it or not.
---
Yeah considering how much GP goes through there a day, its plenty as is.
---
Good luck being a dense cunt.
---
Would u say salamanders are easier than chins (I don't feel like shooting chins and having to worry about setting traps, watching spawn points, etc, sounds like I should be doing bird runs + sallies in the end, does this sound logical?
---
Go pick 10k flax south of Seers Village, come back, and then tell me.

These are not comfortable at all. Really shit tbh. Get a nice lazy boy for 300 and you’re set

Is there no way to get a crossbow string in morytania so he can just smith it?

When they were suggested that was the rarity, but it could have been made less rare on implementation. No source, but I remember seeing the suggestion on a twitter post with a Mod Ash reply.
---
fucking nutty dude nice job
---
I know it's just a meme but you can't compare with how much time Settled puts into osrs
---
Literally did this same thing on my 8th attempt and beat it no sweat. Watch a vide. Practice this. Solid advice.
---
That wasn’t the point. The point is you’d spend x amount on game one for a better looking skin when other people would spend x amount on RS for better armor, accessories etc
---
You get 2 rolls on the muta drop table per kill. It prolly isn't 1/3.6k exactly, but close to that I cba to check.
---
just to put it out there, this account has been locked in karamja since settled was maxing his main ultimate.
---
I feel like we are conflating too many groups of people here.  There are some literally neo-nazis that don't like jews that have problems with Trump backing Israel.  There are also other and younger alt-righters who haven't been indoctrinated into blaming jews and use Muslims and Mexicans as their ideological boogey man.

Why?

I'd do 99 Runecrafting over 99 Agility anyday. fight me.

I got 199 as my highest a few months ago right after my qpc. I was so close to that 200. Now I keep getting 180-190 and it bothers me so much that I can't push to even get that 199 again lmao
---
I'm going to assume that you're using the Runelite client. I believe it's been said that the HP indicator isn't 100% accurate due to some limitations.
---
I wouldn’t say give it all the stats. Maybe give it +2 range str from assemble or half of the accuracy bonus but not both.

You can but it will require reverse engineering runelite or some weird none projectile based hack job. Hydra projectiles aren't publicly accessible so it's really not worth wasting time doing. There were hydra plugins day of release but they were mostly broken by the runelite team.

1) You aren’t a J-mod why are you rocking that name?

2) The account has already been attacked, i’ve obviously already changed everything. it’s already hot.

Someone tell Settled.

It's more that there wasn't really any drama about it, aside from people cracking some jokes and being kinda creeped out
---
It's not every week. Like for me I've been playing for like 12 years but finally got hacked for the first time, and it was a pretty massive sum on rs3. I thought I would never get hacked as I'm always very cautious and don't click things I shouldn't, but info on the internet is easy to obtain and breaches of security do happen in large companies like yahoo, google, jagex, etc.
---
Hey everyone it's YA BOY comeback47 here! I'm not understanding how you've obtained photos of this hacker on my account. But if there is any truth in this post I hope you do get your issue resolved... I will be tweeting this reddit link to Mod Weath. He is the man for looking into my accounts and getting me unbanned from perm banned TWICE! 
---
Glad you're at least getting some publicity because my post struggled I was just fortunate enough for him to see my posts and for all the doubters to be proved wrong! It's a shame that even with decent security we can be easily compromised! Since all of these events I've taken pretty drastic measures to be able to try to play RuneScape safely LOL. 
---
Pretty wild to see and think about man, but best of luck to ya! And I'll do what I can to help because if true... I can only imagine how ya feel! I didn't quite lose this much, but being hacked multiple times (3) and also getting perm banned for something I didn't do was eating away at me! 
---
GOOD LUCK!

Smart for him to try to pay taxes. He is likely a dependent tho and his parents will pay those taxes lol. To the people saying that it's legal I'm almost certain it's not. I remember reading that the gold is never your property to sell because jagex owns runescape and technically owns every item within it as a private company. Even if it is legal for some reason jagex can sue for damages
---
Money is just being transferred not injected or removed unless the hacker drops all their items and/or gp, so it wouldn’t affect it as much as you’d think.

I just didn’t know she fucking died

Lava RC has pervaded my every thought. Making that sweet 70k/hr mark gets me off. I once had over 150k/hr, but that was after a diary do lamp. Can’t wait to get back to burning bindings and duel rings like I’m having a bonfire. RC for life.
---
That has nothing to do with it; people who grinded all 99's aren't gonna be put off by something new to do.
---
It's possible to not like Warding for the big neon glaring issues and dislikes people have about the idea of it.
---
Do I need to save an addy defender if I want to have rune defender backups, or will the cyclops upstairs drop rune defenders if I’m carrying a rune one?
---
Oh yeah I definitely dont think hes "made bank" either
---
Im guessing he doesnt even reach what a minimum wage job would make
---
That could be fine for now tho, I dont know about his situation but considering his age Id guess hes still a student depending on his parents in which case any money he makes is a nice bonus
---
He was in Varrock bank world 302, he's a cheeky one for sure.
---
Eh, if that's true it means they're separate rolls so beginner clues don't reduce the rate of your other clue scrolls.
---
It’s just a guaranteed instakill if it lands on top of you
---
I see the rationale for it, but you're lowkey playing on "hardcore iron bank" with that
---
They can train construction so thats nlt true... free players are homeless
---
That's not a real account.

in regards to #3, you most certainly can set states \*or\* cities in VPNs,

it all makes sense

How about all the intelligence agencies and 2 minutes of personal browsing?

Imo he should be streaming. The amount of subs and donations people would throw at the dude would be absurd.
---
yeah. statistically challenged has streamed probably dozens of hours of grinding on his wilderness-only ironman and you've seen everything the stream has to offer after 15 minutes. the only reason to stay is to chat with the streamer or for background noise.

It's not exactly a common exercise on Twitch if you're coming from other games and are a first time viewer of an osrs twitch stream. It's surprising to me that Runescape still operates like the childish shitfest of scamming and hacking that it did in 2006. For some neckbeard to use view bots, identity theft and what apparently is a legitimate looking login form is well beyond what I'd have thought plausible on Twitch.
---
Heard he likes underage girls too so there's that..

I did Max melees at NMZ on my alt, buying herb boxes is definitely worth it. I think I ended up with nearly 30m in herbs when I finally ran out of points

While I was getting 99 fletching I would ask every now and then (not spamming) if someone could buy me feathers or darts and everyone called me a scammer :(

some people are criminals and when no1 gets punished for doing it and you make a couple k for doing it, sharing all your info is quite risky

It's an animation lure, he reads a book or something else and runs out of the safe zone, you click on him seeing him still on the safe zone, but it lures out of the safe zone, common lure.

I practiced using that RS3 one on the web. The tall magic animation was so much clearer on the rs3 animation!

On 07 I could hardly tell the difference and got my ass handed to me.

Easy with a blowpipe though

Hang in there, homie. Just think of the insane dopamine drop you’ll get when you finally receive it :)

Its a very common lure in PvP world. The lurer venge and opens a specific book, which makes it look like he is inside safe area, but is really outside.

I just hate change lol, I liked the old background more. Not its current background but the one before that. When they moved everything over they kind of just plopped it there. Look at how nice the old layout is: https://imgur.com/KQhwoCq

Compared to the new one: https://imgur.com/aEP3h8k
---
The old text stays in an organized column while the new text can be scene going everywhere without any real purpose.
---
Also I should mention how much easier it is to see the blue links on the old page then the ugly brown ones they have blending in with the background. 
---
Also the old tab icon looks much better. It actually matches OSRS's theme and not just a brown square with the letters "O and S in white bubble letters.

We quit and joined at the same times. I remember bow strings were the same price as cannonballs. So I’d make 3000 bowstrings and then buy 3000 cannonballs, I thought I was a genius. Then I’d proceed to waste all the cannonballs at the Varrock guards because apparently that was the only place I’d ever train lmao.

Thanks dude! I took it upon myself and caught 3,200 guns and just went for it in the tunnels haha

It’s not about gp, it’s about principle.

No, I wouldn’t go out of my way to knife someone over a scam, but saying people do it over some gp is just simply not true as there’s more to it.

Based on your description i'd say you have a pretty good understanding of how ge tracker gets its data, dont want to try and explain what you already know. Even though osbuddy data is ever declining in size it still has a much better refresh rate so for rapid changes it's still probably better, but accuracy over time the main ge data is probably more helpful these days. And no, there is no other sauce for data at this time
---
Yeah people would definitely buy 90b worth of gold, obviously not the average Joe is gonna money on 90b gold, but people who own massive gold selling websites would buy that and resell it for profit
---
Your computer is compromised, you need to deal with that first before doing anything with your accounts.
---
That's the only way they would be able to get into your friends account.
---
Wait really? Thats dope
---
That noob about to get lured to wizards
---
It's not 1 person buying 90b to buy some max sets to do zulrah with and max there account quicker, it's  massive gold sellers buying it and flipping it for like 20 cents extra, who's then going to distribute among heaps of people
---
This should help you OP. Also never do more than one non prayer action per flick. Need more than 1 food/sip of potion? Just do it one at a time (maybe two sips at a time at a push). Need to lure the healers? Do one at a time.

People are pretending like he can grind lucky imps but Id be surprised if he gets more than 1 a day even playing full time and having tons of scouts. Its not a grind, its literally just luck.

Its a national holiday in New Zealand and Australia. It's to remember the people that died during World War 1
---
Get runecrafting to level 99 and go from there.
---
I wonder if the rubber bands are more expensive than the stack of cash it contains. 
---
Rubber bands must be a serious necessity for everybody down there.
---
Australian holiday today commemorating first ww soldiers
---
So hyped for SotE! It's the first GM quest released I'll be able to do on release day.
---
I've tried scythe at Sire and noticed the spawns taking damage from the scythe as you mentioned.
---
You can actually lure the spawns so this does not happen by moving 2 tiles backwards. You lose a couple ticks but its worth it.
---
Scythe isn't worth it if you're going for money at this boss, I just use it to get the pet faster. + Scythe is a lot of fun to use imo.
---
Look at those gears lmfao
---
The fact that he's 85 slayer is that its cursed.
---
If you think people play as much osrs as they do due to nostalgia then you’re actually retarded. It’s actually due to there being so much stuff to do that takes a lot of time to accomplish so people are addicted to the feeling of getting stuff done. Most people who played rs as kids probably had no clue what they were doing anyway
---
It’s a third party client rather than playing in the normal RuneScape one, it’s way better (in my opinion) and has heaps a extra features and plug-ins and it’s free!
---
200 iq
---
Why did you knock the baby out smh
---
Continue for sure. Learn from your mistakes and come back stronger. When u are higher at some point u will think back and be lucky u didnt deiron.
---
Ok, gotcha
---
This is why I won't even try inferno, CBA getting smacked at later waves.
---
Yeah, I watched those guys trying to do the theater in Morytania max gear and those red nylo's were the biggest issue.
---
The only work around I could think to taking these out "consistently" would be a dds from implings.
---
Thanks baby, still waiting on that phat that you promised me though. It would look so good with my new outfit.
---
Bro are you like 80 years old? You have like 2 seconds to react lol
---
When will we get the 4 player minimum requirement for LMS?
---
How the fuck did it take you 19 tries
---
Peta is more dangerous to animals than any of us ever will be
---
Why not?
---
Rip max capers.
---
I'm sorry for the poor quality, made with MS paint.
---
I would just cut magics for hours and hours. Could sell 1k for 1m pretty quickly in Seer's bank
---
It shows that Mod Weath unbanned him in the OP, in the twitter thread
---
isn't it weird and out of place? forget about the bots.
---
That is most definitely not it, Chief.
---
They should nerf those too. The amount of alchables these bossed shit out is insane.
---
Just because something op been in game for a trillion kills doesnt mean it shouldnt be nerfed.
---
I watched my first stream recently for half an hour.  He was thieving rogues in deep wild, there was a dozen people hanging out in game and 250 watching the stream.  He was interacting and answering questions.
---
Made about $75 in donations in that half hour.
---
There wasn’t, until people read that comment! (I’m just joking I don’t even pk, I’m still working on leveling my main only at like 1575 total, working on quest cape and completing other content).
---
Why the fuck would I donate when its free? Plus a bunch of independant develepors have contribuited to Runelite, none of which will see that money.
---
Don't worry, little buddy, you'll grow into your big boy brain soon.
---
Came here to see what the actual value was. Sad that no body has completed that.
---
i mean the majority NPCs have no hint of their personalities to base a lewd out of. I guess Katrine or Lady Keli could be made into some kinda femdom thing. But there's female npcs that we know nothing about to put into any scenes.
---
Swampletics dying is more tragic than any game of thrones or avengers characters dying.
---
I think it's important to to consider that the rubies one gets from random events are noted, so he can hold them in a stack even before he has the fletching level to cut them into tips.
---
I wouldn't split with randoms, mainly why I solo or trio because randoms from WDR can't be trusted either.
---
Definetely rebuild as an iron.
---
Take an upvote for this good idea.
---
The Some emus did
---
I created a plugin for my self to use that Jagex wouldn’t let others to have. 
---
You could also get the jad prayer switching plugin back. It’s not gone. 
---
I’m pointing out that all you do is want want want and don’t provide anything back. 
---
Learning to code a plugin is far simpler than you think.  Heck I learned programming from making bots for RuneScape and diablo 2, now I’m a software developer lol.
---
It’s a Varrock Easy Diary req.
---
nah fam just tick eat vorkath
---
No unread messages. I'm about to reeee
---
To before you were born is good enough
---
Upvoted these are fantastic
---
Idk if you realise where you are, but this is /r/2007scape. There is no moderation done here. Mods are more useless than a pile of steaming shit.
---
How about you delete it then?
---
But even uim get a house.
---
what margin in merching is considered "good"? like what should I be aiming for?
---
I just started merching, and the margins I've even getting range from 3-6gp. Is that good? Is it okay-ish? Should I shoot for bigger margins? 
---
I get that the merchers probably won't be sharing their methods and that's fine. I just want to know if I'm going towards the right direction \^\^. Thank you!
---
I know, right? This guy is stuck in the Nieve Hype era.
---
Once people start securing the bag, they’ll start donating to runelite
---
Keep in mind though back then we didn’t know how to pvm efficiently at all.
---
Those people “farming” cave horrors didn’t know how to pray flick, probably walked most of the way there, were in scuffed gear, and used some trash food like lobsters with no pots. Plus they were kids who would get bored and stop or have their parents kick them off after 2 hours.
---
Hey this is OSRS! New ideas will only ruin the game!
---
Sarcasm of course, great ideas mate
---
Well as to your first point thats kinda all patreon is. Essentially everyone on their is providing some art or creation for free and people donate money to help support them in doing so. Then the tiered freebies are just generally lil extra thank yous or getting something earlier and not really something you need.
---
I'm at 66 farming from low 40s and I've literally just been doing tree runs twice a day for like 2 weeks. It is ridiculously easy, but a bit expensive.
---
At high levels gorillas are way more effort than bossing since the higher your DPS the more frequently you have to swap. Max efficiency on gorillas is actually very much based on your actual efficiency at swapping rather than just gear based DPS as a result.
---
Do I really need to spell it out for you? I want to know if it's possible to get more than a full inventory of rolls now as it was capped at that before.
---
What happens when I log out or teleport while my cannon is still set up? Do I have to pick it up before logging? Planning on training at green dragons so just was thinking of the best escape route :P
---
For almost all GitHub projects, if there are more contributors than 1, it still follows a Pareto distribution for how many commits are added by whom. So Adam is the 1% is what I’m trying to say.
---
Yes tree runs migh get you there in a week let alone a month. The grind to 70 is fast. And then the grind from 75 to 90 is fast
---
Ye, I usually say that to people making ironmen related suggestions. 
---
If people get banned for attacking mobs that ironmen are attacking then should I report every player that crashes me at Bandos? Because that would be silly.
---
You could have 100 dollars on Reddit credit to throw out, it doesn’t really translate to 100 dollars that they used to have.
---
How is that sad? Its a ridiculous boring shit grind
---
Zulrah but it won’t be easy
---
I was in a LAN with my friends who ended up showing the series to me.
---
Honestly you dont have a whole lot of options. You could bandos with groups. You could Zulrah but it will be a struggle. I would slay for some higher stats
---
The game is literally older than he is.
---
yea last time i tried drawing a fire cape it looked like cheese pizza so i just made it look like actual fire instead lol
---
Weird flex but ok
---
True
---
Makes revs worth
---
The bird disguise is the best bird costume. Change my mind.
---
How can I learn to make a plug-in?
---
oh shit- i thought that's why he was making a point of his run energy
---
It’s not me actually, is some of my clan mems
---
Sounds good. Would base 80’s be alright for zulrah?
---
Hooroo lads, hoo bloody roo. 🌺
---
rs3 bad
---
Yooo what's up? Haha I was wondering when it would happen!
---
You realize you could have killed wolves at the place you do chompy bird hunting right.
---
Can't nerf every boss in the game because that's what you'd have to do then.
---
You can always go to college, you can't always cash in on massive internet following. Make content (and that $$) now while he can, then worry about college or a long term career once it's no longer viable.
---
but what was the question?
---
I assume you're killing them off-task? Do you just void or do a full swap?
---
There's plenty of 18 year olds with tons of nostalgia for the game.
---
I’m assuming he thought you meant bankstanding skilling like crafting etc
---
Definatley doable but by no means efficient.
---
Upvoted for fire of armistice. Nice blessing and god page sink!
---
Was too lazy to go smith myself, so made this suggestion by googling "Smithing osrs" and edit that picture :')
---
When the government drones combine to make a megadrone.
---
I do have a decent understanding of how it works. I've been flipping on the GE ever since the GE became a thing. My issue with OS buddy metrics is that prices tend to be a bit off from what the items are actually selling for. Boosted prices seem to be becoming more and more common through GE tracker, so I guess I'll just go back to the old ways. Thanks for the info!
---
If we don't like this plug in can we have the WI dow not close durring combat jagex....
---
I don't wanna waste type attacking crap tell i can have the window open.
---
Why is there no website to download user made plugins for runelite? It's really weird, usually when you can mod something, a site exists for user created mods, but not for runelite?
---
Neither have i found any public user created plugins at all for the client, anyone knows the reason for that?
---
Wow I would’ve never guessed! Thanks for the completely obvious heads up!
---
Doesn’t Vorkath only have 3 legs? Amazing drawing tho!
---
Well I personally don't care about saving 0.6 seconds, I'm just trying to give you an explanation, no need to be so hostile about the whole thing. It's all for convenience, and its optional, it doesnt hurt anyone
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Song_of_the_Elves
---
Good thanks
---
But I'm asking what OP was doing, out of curiosity.
---
If u compare gold prices, I recall 1m was $10+ back in the day, and right now is under $1
---
Yea :(
---
On my uim ive done rc from 63 to 71. In one go yesterday to today. That shit is boring as hell. I dont think i can get maxed just cuz rc
---
If you click the door after hit you literally get like 2 seconds to pick before attacked again...........
---
On the wiki it’s like 9 level 70 skills. Don’t remember all of them, oh and all the elf quests up to mourning ends part 2
---
HP pretty much is the deciding factor when it comes to Dharoks. Dharoks will have a slight advantage in dps at low 90s hp and possibly before, but it has a lot of overkill which makes it not worth it until mid 90s HP. You can test it with your own stats in the dps calculator, Dharoks isn't that much better than obby until higher hp, and you can assume that until the dps disparity is large, you'll be losing a lot due to overkill.
---
Lets get to bashing butts, as well as deez nutts
---
Nerfing the drops will make them the same shit-tier as the other brutal dragons are. Rather have a (slightly) out of place slayer requirement.
---
llol
---
I like the idea of the next blessing or page cancelling the previous one, otherwise it pretty much eliminates the item sink element.
---

---
I play this card! SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT! Placing my monster in Attack Position, and end my turn!
---
I’m all for convenience, such as timers telling you when your pots expire, but for things like this __that literally play the game for you and turn it into a “click the green box simulator”__ I’m against
---
I feel like this would be a use of user data that would be largely accepted, but I understand the viewpoint. Kind of a shame, really. It'd be much better for accurate metrics. Jamflex plz.
---
Every night i wake up screaming.
---
The seeds i've lost. The cash stack i've lost.
---
You can also wield undead chicken
---
Why do we want small updates
---
This shit already exists in the game, so Warding can't be that bad in comparison guys, come on!
---
Understandable bro
---
It's not like this game is that much different from a click on the green box simulator anyways. I mean you literally afk craft 10,000 of an item to get a level so you can afk craft 10,000 more of another item. Getting upset over a QOL update is meaningless in this game that you can be braindead and still play.
---
Hate to burst your point of view but point of being homeless is that you have no home. And not all f2p players beg and not all beggers are f2p
---
Omg you're telling me he just butted in on the conversation to provide relevant information? On a public forum?? You're definitely right to be offended
---
yea its meta, but if you were to go for number 1 ranks this is 100% the method. you can max anytime but only 1 person  can get rank 1
---
It's the damage you've accumulated, you need to always get over 100.
---
Bruh.
---
I tried logging into my old account on the mobile app. Rather than log me in, it appears to just give me a slightly altered name and places me on tutorial island. How do I get my old account?
---
Damage done. No it doesn’t your activity matters tho. Activity bar on the top right 👍🏻
---
No, it doesn't. At least not to me. It looks like a cheap copy of any MMO out there, at least osrs has its own design style and even if it's not as detailed as other games, it's still beautiful, charming and unique.
---
2???
---
Offended? I'm just informing him that he's not OP, in case he didn't know.
---
Damn y'all so touchy.

I'm more concerned about the giraffe neck

He was not okay

Nice.
---
Whats the fastest way to get NMZ points? I'm about 70 all combat and like to play solo. Is there a faster way than hard endurance?
---
Yes but I'm talking about the viability and success of a first financial endeavour while you're explicitly talking about the viability and sustainability of a career. I have a sustainable job that pays my bills but that's it - on his first entrepreneurial endeavour the guy has probably already sown enough clout and money to kickstart a much more successful future than me despite the fact I can comfortably say my bills are paid for the foreseeable future. He attempted a gig and succeeded and more than likely locked down future success.
---
He, is a Lewt Neenjah
---
Try it, he’ll D-paw spec you
---
I thought it said 32 - 5x but it was 82 but thanks guys
---
I'd say RS3 is far more enjoyable as an ironman than a normal account. You get to play the game more organically and do content a normal account would never *ever* bother doing, allowing you to see and experience much more of the game than you would've otherwise.
---
I used to play RS3 ironman myself (2.5k~ total) before I started playing OSRS and I definitely enjoyed my time there. In the end I quit because I just really couldn't get into the combat system and because there's a lot of focus on weird mechanics such as constant 
---
 item/weapon switching in order to do optimal DPS which in an actionbar-focused combat system just didn't appeal to me. 
---
There's definitely a large focus on dailies on RS3. Not just dailies with daily cooldowns, but also weeklies, monthlies, and stuff like distractions and diversions (big chinchompa, guthixian caches, and maybe few more I can't remember) that you want to do every couple of hours. There's also buying items from shops for invention and just general upkeep for invention which requires a fair amount of upkeep and there's  player-owned-ports, which requires you to interact with a couple of times per day so you can eventually make high tier armor and weaponry. Though I'm not sure how relevant those items are anymore with potential powercreep since I haven't been paying much attention to RS3 since I stopped playing.
---
I'd definitely recommend RS3 ironman. At least so you can experience all the quests and the stories RS3 has to offer.
---
that was actually the worst feeling ever, so glad for this change
---
Nice job on the gold/jewellery work. Is there a plan to do the same for smithing on an anvil in the future?
---
He protec,

But most importantly,

He just want a bone and a pat
---
Its about consistency. Cooking, fletching are you able to grasp that concept?..
---
I just personally find gorillas way easier than zulrah. Vorki is very easy but without a DHCB it can suck. Gorillas is definitely something that’s more sustainable when you’re sub 90s cmb stats without maxed gear. 
---
Gorilla is the only boss I’ve found where the profit per hour is actually close to what people say. People love to throw around 3-4mp/h for vork/zulrah but every 10h or 24h video I’ve watched from skilled players that include the cost of supplies, it’s 2m p/h if not less.
---
Sorry to hear that man. So what is he gonna do, start consulting for people that want to start a career making videos?
---
Nah i like free shit
---
With some (I.e. cheap, high volume) items it's more reliable to do a test buy/sell and then check the official GE metrics to get a better feel for where your margins actually are. Bear in mind that with OSBuddy metrics, they're only tracking metrics from that client. Less active users of OSBuddy means less current pricing. This is especially an issue for more expensive items as /u/SpoiceKois mentioned since they're muuuuch lower volume and tend to be where the big money is to be made.
---
There’s tons of ways to train skills. If you choose that you want to sit there and afk instead of interacting with the game that’s all on you. This isn’t a qol update as __its not implemented by jagex__
---
Meet Birdletics...
---
I agree with the sentiment of your overall post, but being a little nit-picky, the 20k lower estimate is definitely wayyyyy too low. I'm still really young so I don't have a wife/kids/high expenses aside from food and a phone bill, earn around ~33k a year, but still have nowhere near a high enough monthly payout (after taxes) to be able to even move out of my parents place because of massive rent costs. For two parents to support themselves and a kid in most areas of America, you would need them both to be making 50k+
---
In case he didn't know he wasn't OP...?
---
Hmm, hard to narrow it down.
---
Spot on, thank you
---
a letter in the alphabet.
---
I wouldn’t mind swamp man choking me with his whip 😫😫😍😍
---
There are people who will buy 100m gp by buying bonds and cashing them in. I do the same thing you are doing as far as membership goes
---
There used to be CCs for this back in the day. Great times
---
i’d be the emu equivalent*, the australians would be the Nazis in your dumb equivalency lol well done
---
it’s also just facts, the australian army was beyond ineffective their first attempt and wasted money they didn’t have.  The second emu war only killed 1,000.
---
That’s a good point. Thought I addressed that when I said it wouldn’t be a good career choice, but that he’s a smart kid that knows what he’s doing
---
Your money estimate’s are way off unless they’re living in the middle of nowhere lol
---
He genuinely cares about the game and the community
---
Sadly it didn’t record your reaction, pure bliss :D

fuuuuuck idk why i didn't think of that, would've been great

Nope mobile wasn’t out 2 years ago!!!
---
Not with student loans. :) I can't even afford my own apartment in the Midwest.
---
You think that's bad? Be 9 year old me, roughly 2005 ish. I had an IRL friend who would play 4-8 hours a day. He was addicted. Needless to say, he was better than all of us. I looked over his shoulder as he was typing his password one day, and figured it out. This was before the days of bank pins. 
---
I logged into his account, and traded myself his Granite Maul. He logged on later, and called me crying because he had been hacked. I played dumb. What he didn't know is that another friend in our 4th grade class had called me out, and I was supposed to duel him that Friday. So I did, beat him of course, I had a GMaul on my side. After I beat him, I tried logging into my friends account again to give it back, but he had changed his password.
---
And that's the story of how I got my first Granite Maul.
---
Correction: You assumed it would be helpful. But since it was literally irrelevant to the information I was asking for, it wasn't. Thanks for trying.
---
Can we expect the 2nd poll blog for it soonish? Like the one talking further about rewards/content within the city

how do you have a brain but make these comments

Yeah, exactly, there are accounts like the @TNGOP one that are actual "russian trolls." But there is so many useful idiots in the world willing to spew their idiotic shit freely all day. Seriously, glance at any comment section on a local news FaceBook post. Take a shot any time you read "libtard."

Imagine using the word battles unironically. Also 'death before dishonor' is just a phrase used to identify boots.
---
To be fair he said celebrate the people that died, not celebrate death.
---
You're making this post so you can reasonably 'explain' getting hacked next week when in reality you just rwt'd your bank.
---
Also, i got tanzanite fang drop 30 kills ago.
---
Those aren't the same restrictions, only the same gear. He has other restrictions that make it hard such as inventory and consumables available.
---
Bandos tassets+skirt should be last 2 upgrades. Amulets+rings first, then boots, then armor top+bottom. Same applies to range equipment. Also get a torso instead of bcp.

the real life raccoon that rocket was based off died fairly recently, I think thats why its in there

I strongly agree.

 My buddy did end up getting the claw at 3194 kc i think it was. reddit did their thing he just got it awhile after since he took a pause

They said it will release during the summer, so I would expect it in June.
---
They have the Easter event that drops eggs that sell for 1-2k each, you can skill, or green dragons. Your best option is using the free week off mobile and just canceling it use the free week to make your bond.

I can only mentally handle half an hour or so a day now adays. Sometimes like yesterday I go for like 2 hours cause I was doing mm on my new Ironman. But I used to do like 10 or 12 hour days when I was in high school/post high school. Idfk how I did that shit

I wouldn't recommend it. Don't intentionally visit malicious websites, nothing good will come from it. Report them and move on.  reportphishing@jagex.com

How did the verac skirt 0 not protect on death? shoulda been his most expensive item, no?

Are wines still viable?

Thank you ANZAC!

how?

oh brother
---
It's Dyngus* Day and it's not just Western NY bc I celebrated it in Albany this week
---
Random is random. 1 in 300 just means that for every 300,000,000 gorillas killed, around 1,000,000 zenytes came into the game. You hear about 3k kills dry or whatever, but then there was that guy the other day who got like 6 zenytes in one task. On scales that small the actual odds don't predict all that much.
---
tbh he probably prefers that to getting repeatedly killed by bots for his hides

I’m not proud that this actually made me laugh out loud

It asks whether players would vote yes or no, why they'd vote that way, for thoughts on Warding generally, and thoughts on new skills generally.
---
Look, my point wasn't to hate on the right wing. I'm not opposed against conservatism in general. I was trying to find a connection between gaming too much and views, which I think found. I can't stress this enough: I'm absolutely not saying conservatives usually are nolife idiots. Instead, some positions of the right appeal more to excessive gamers (look back at my argument chain). This is because these people chose to cherry pick only some of the right wing politics, exaggerate them and make them their new identity. Many of them don't care about traditional values, the role of the government or financial markets at all. They just have the (wrong) assumption that right wing politics allow them to hate on minorities, for example.
---
Got my point? Here's another comment I made in response to a critic:
---
"I was expecting answers like this, and to be honest, I totally agree it might sound that way. Tried to make it not sound like Im hating on a political side, but apparently it failed. So the question I asked myself is why gaming seems to correlate with being right wing. My train of thoughts appears logical to me as long as we keep in mind Im just talking about tendencies and not individuals or political parties. Saying conservatives have and are "low social skills, negative world view, scape-goating minorities, and hateful." is ridiculous, yes. But assigning these attributes to a number of gamers isn't. And these attributes lead to them sympathising with the right wing. That is different to saying that conservatives are like that."
---
That really doesn’t mean you’re rich enough to not work lol

I'd happily let it figure out the shit i've done 1000 times for me. For example, the puzzle clue step. Done those stupid things manually hundreds of times. The runelite arrow overlay is amazing, because I cbf to do those anymore.

Yep, I'd say soonish. I've seen a first draft from Mod Gambit, there's lot of feedback and unanswered questions from the team to address first.

Holy shit. Another cow spawn to farm for hides. Or is this one milkable.
---
You're the one asking "how much to max?" Pretty dumb question because gp has always been the most insignificant part of maxing.
---
God those look so fucking stupid

That's a big yikes

So a safe version of Zam temple, once again another anti pk update!!! Crabs unite!!!

---
No but I can dick down your gf for you
---
Projection?
---
And nah, you just honestly sounded like a just-got-a-unit 42A, in all my time I don't think I've ever heard someone use the term "battles" seriously unless it was the new guy, or some csm hyped up trying to be full hooah.
---
this is the kind of guy to put runescape on his resume
---
This means he can craft a rcbow now right?
---
Yeah it was weird he was dying so hard on the "He sAiD BaTtLeS WhIcH MeAnS PeoPlE aNd I DoNt LikE It" hill. Either way at the end of the day it doesn't matter what meaning you intended because they both have the same effect in your comment anyway. Always fun watching people sperg
---
I've done DS2, honestly the part of MM2 I CBA is the stealth portion on the fucking platform. Took me four hours last time.
---
Nah she's loyal one :)

Diaries aren’t f2p though, so most people seeing the dog probably don’t know.

Nice beardie man, have two myself.

“Understood. Thanks.” what an actual legend
---
Thanks man.
---
10 years ago I was the guy pretending to be a girl to get free stuff lmao
---
I can't upvote you more than once, sorry.
---
Good.
---
She sold the username and isn't getting it back
---
I thought so too, but felt like it was worth asking.
---
Where can i find this
---
I mean, I'm already getting 1.2m per hour as it is with maxed gear on my ALT. 
---
Who tf even bothers investing hundreds of hour questing a bot? O.o
---
Then he proceeds to try and debate me for hours.. Like wtf you already proved you are fucking irrational.
---
All Jagex returning items would do, is make fake hackings where people "hack" their account on a proxy or vpn then sell the gold and wait for a refund.  It's 100% the players fault in my opinion.
---
69 slayer is like 20-30 hours, extremely tedious.
---
But homeless people beg
---
Nah he is toxic not you.
---
Your opinion is dumb as shit
---
Dude is almost there already. We are watching content well behind where his acc actually is.
---
I never broke my oath. You just call me a traitor literally because I am different from you. What a total and absolute dipshit.
---
Still unfortunate since both could be used as restart money.
---
lmao
---
It's rather, keeping track of skills requires constant upkeep while the puzzle is always in the same position and easily identifiable, it has nothing to with subtraction you dimwit.
---
No he said it correctly. You play with a client called filezilla
---
"Make UIM easier pls"
---
Faked
---
Sell the BCP, get fighter torso, and get primordials.
---
Buy a membership
---
There's definitely good arguments against what I'm saying, but just some counterpoints. As someone else pointed out, aus users barely touch bh as it is because of the shitty 300+ ping regardless of which rota it is. The other bh world wouldn't rly go down in pop cos the people using this aus one would be Australians anyway, so it's not like you're splitting the scene, but ibstead appealing to a new crowd. Bh also has tons of great money makers for both pvmers (wildy bosses dropping emblems) and pvpers alike, which would help revitalise the aus pking scene.
---
I think it's a poor argument to say we can't consider the world just because it might increase emblem farming. If anything, this speaks to a more inherent issue with the bh mechanics/moderation and shouldn't be a reason to not introduce this for actual players. It is better not to conflate the two topics there.
---
Insane af
---
They have Green Dragons
---
Slayer Master: "Have you ever actually killed a slayer monster?"
---
Swampletics: "Well.. no, but I've read a lot about them."
---
There's a good chance be might now be making more than his parents though ya? If I did that on video games my parents wouldn't say a word. Granted it would be hard to beat my dad's salary with video games.
---
Not really.  Furthermore, they don't use security questions anymore, but any ones still set are locked in and cannot be changed/removed.
---
Yeah honestly there's no rush to do college/uni as soon as you're done high school. I'd equate what he's doing right now as working for a few years out of school like a lot of people do. Which is totally fine.
---
There's an option on mobile where tapping brings up the right click menu so you don't have to hold.
---
Can he get rune ore?
---
What
---
Free to play free 2 play same shit
---
He didn't say celebrate death, though. You're just putting words in his mouth. He said "celebrate everyone that died," celebrate being the verb applying to the subject 'everyone'. As in celebrating the people, not the death.
---
Hmm interesting. Can’t say I’ve tested out getting hit by it much lol, let alone while over healed
---
I saw somebody spamming Anzac day in Roidies chat last night and thought it was some kind of troll. How wholesome!
---
I'm keen to see how the other 6 skills level alongside slayer, obviously you'd expect all to be around 85 but imagine he went dry on a certain tome for a few levels or something and ended up 10 levels behind in one of the skills
---
Dhcb
---
UIM lose _all_ items on death except untradables
---
3 more brews and one more restore probably wouldn't hurt.  Remember 3 dose of brew for every dose of restore when healing for optimal ratio.
---
I don't think you need anything beside blowpipe (spec is great for healing) but If you're not comfortable with the range of the blow pipe/ maneuvering around jad while switching pray, you may want a longer range weapon for luring healers. 
---
Lastly,  in wave 62 the orange 360 is going to spawn in the same place as jad. However,  if you're not sure where that is it's recommended to pay range vs. Jads spawn since you can react top the audio cue fite his message attack but by the time you hear his ranged attack it's already too late. 
---
As long as you don't miss prayer vs. Jad you can't die.  Gl
---
wtf
---
And he's focused and efficient for 10 hours a day. Not me doing 30 minutes of RC, getting bored, then going back to slayer for a few hours.
---
Nah, you just rose to the occasion.
---
I just think of it this way. Some weeks I work 10 hours a day, behind a desk at a computer. The difference is, I'm not playing runescape, I don't like what I do, and I'm in my 20's. I'm assuming settled makes a pretty good income from his videos. Probably as much as I make as an accountant fresh out of school.
---
Nope, you'll go back to the duel arena
---
“Constant upkeep”
---
Ok if you’re so mentally deficient that you can’t click the skills tab and do __LITERAL SIMPLE SUBTRACTION TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OF YOUR POT YOU HAVE LEFT__ then I wish you the best in life and hope you have a great time living off the government
---
Maybe instead of the power of ghost speak you can light it in the swamp and ghasts dont ruin your food anymore, so you no longer need a druid pouch.
---
But I love my BCP lol. I’d rather have the set then save money tbh, it looks sooooo much better imo.
---
This would make my 200m smithing grind even more braindead
---
Support
---
By no means an expert on taxes... but probably. Federal Income taxes would be $0 up to your first $9325, and then 12% from $9326-$20,675.33. Not sure what the rest of the taxes would be. You could easily look up your state and local income taxes, and then figureout how much SS and Medicare is. 
---
Did you file your taxes? The IRS probably wouldn't crack down on you since you're (I'm assuming) a dependent, and so 20K could be see as a gift from your parents over the years... But in the long run if you keep making bank, you need to file your taxes each year. 
---
How'd you make all your gold? I've always thought about getting into RWT but just don't really have a drive to/I have a real job.
---
Problem is when you scale to a large size you get suggestions left and right. Most are either very stupid, so you spend your time explaining why it's not a good idea to implement. Then you get duplicates, so either retell the same story or you ignore them.
---
Finally you get those people who don't read and ask you for minor customer support, and if you help them they become reliant on you and keep asking you.
---
That's why most suggestions and customer interactions go through another person, like a product manager, who can take the time and reply and filter out things for the software developers.
---
\&gt;You're quite clearly unfamiliar with the oath military members swear.
---
Correct. I am not a service member.
---
\&gt;They swear to serve, protect, and defend **the constitution of the United States**.
---
With you so far.
---
\&gt;He then votes
---
Aaaaand you lost me. Who he votes for has nothing to do with his oath. He can vote for fucking Mussolini if he so chooses. That is his right as an American. 
---
Your nonsensical ramble about political opinions is just that, opinion. Labeling dissenting opinions as unconstitutional or traitorous, on just the basis that they are dissenting, is literally fascism. You've shown your true colors. 
---
\&gt;That's him breaking his oath.
---
No, that's you being an ignorant fascist. 
---
I'd wish you a good day, but I actually hope your day sucks.
---
Should I bother to go to Zeah on my extremely early game (less than 20 in most skills) HCIM (btw)? 
---
Recently began playing again and haven't been there before so would love to explore but not sure wether it'll be too dangerous for me/not worth the effort.
---
Will probably get lost in the replies but just wanted to say thanks for your awesome work mate.  I have never used Patreon but will be signing up to help line your pockets.  Very well deserved.
---
Thanks again buddy.
---
I feel like you dont understand that time and effort are not pixels but whatever floats your boat. I hope when your dad dies you dont get emotional because it's just a body.
---
I didn’t disover any
---
Nice work man. You should finish up the Kebos diary and work towards 99 slowly via Konar. I've found it to be pretty fun so far. Just hit 96 Slayer.
---
Unless you're looking to profit off something while training slayer like the green dragons or are looking for mysterious emblem drops. It would just depend on what you're after.
---
You would be wrong.
---
Emblem farming is creating multiple accounts that you yourself control to farm emblems basically outside of the BH minigame.
---
You are a sad, sad man.
---
Awesome work once again dude
---
Only 1 pray bonus so not that much. Depends how much you dislike BA I guess. I personally didn't mind it that much. Also worth noting it's needed for a Falo clue so if you ever plan on doing master clues you'll need one.
---
It’s not. It’s just a different market
---
Kid's actually a piece of shit, trying to hire Venezuelans for $0.50/hour while living with his parents. Hope he doesn't have to pay a huge medical bill from getting hit by a truck
---
You don't get anything for supporting them so people probably won't
---
My IRL friends are just looking at me like I’ve got a mental illness. So you’re 2-0 versus me
---
I'll do it if I remember tonight
---
Is this man using a wooden shield at arma? Lmaooo
---
Yes, yes I know what the point is, RS3 is a fat ugly chick getting in the way of the slim and sexy OSRS blonde... But this is so ambiguous. It's also implying that big girls aren't attractive or desired... Maybe OSRS is the BBW? Nice and curvy butt and boobs, something to hold onto, lot of love there. Built for the men.
---
QoL is not easyscape, but what you've listed is not QoL, it's easyscape. QoL would be something like less dialogue to get fire arrows in the underground pass.
---
Easyscape is removing 50% of clicks from smithing.
---
People donate $400 to Twitch streamers and Patreon girls. Where are those big brainlets when you need them?
---
Your math says guams.
---
Nice username
---
Get 99 mining through rune/pure essence
---
im a cheapo who banks and then cooks. ill use barb tho thanks
---
Diango can sell it. Like the cabbage cape but for fake fire cape.
---
3rd party clients are more easy scape than some QoL updates tbh
---
lmao i got baited, there was also this picture that made me believe it too of it in game http://i.imgur.com/KIQTOFY.jpg
---
I hosted flower gambling and got to max cash a couple times before selling most and starting again.
---
what about banking non member? thanks
---
&gt;&gt; This formatting means this statement is fact, and was taken directly from the source.
---
Weeds have a 100% margin.

Gosh, I just feel sorry for people like you.
---
With the bad image he brought to Jagex during all the drama they could probably fire him for that if not anything else.
---
Modern day Robin hood lmao
---
When you play an MMORPG for 2 hours a week and get surprised when people pass your levels
---
You do know there are people botting this game 24/7, scamming, spamming, and RWT every single day but you’re pissed off over a qol update (which jagex approves of) and its purpose is to make things easier(hence it being a QUALITY OF LIFE update). Also this update isn’t targeted at players who are experienced at barrows its for noobs who don’t know the damn puzzle to help them out. If you have a problem with runelite plug ins then you’ve got 2 options. 1) turn them off 2) use jagexs client. Complaining about qols on a client that you don’t have to use is autistic af. Just seems like you’re mad that someone will have it easier than you since you had to learn it the old fashioned way, boo hoo bitch.
---
Getting it lvl 3 is what I would reccomend
---
My bad :/ thanks for correcting me. The point of mods doing nothing still stands tho
---
He was one item bgs staking
---
Probably never, as he's stated in the past he doesn't like being refereed to as "God Ash"
---
Swam song I think
---
As far as I know this is one of those gray areas where you might get banned. Depending if their IP is flagged etc etc. However since you are not botting and acc sharing is okay, it would technically not be bannable. But why even do that man. This is a game. Meant to be played and feel the struggle. You can justify but i dont have time for it. Thats part of the struggle of scape its a grind. Might as well go as far as being on a priv server or buying an account if you dont want to play. Just be careful in whatever you do.
---
F2p? Then yeah barb is only choice really. P2p? Definitely shilo.
---
Yeah I mean I have one purely for pking but I fucking hated getting it
---
you only say that because your account is shit too
---
not necessarily man, hes been playing it since he was 8 or something
---
Not enough grapes, completely inaccurate
---
2/10
---
Might as well remove the barrows puzzles entirely /s
---
Veracs skirt and seeds were the main things
---
ty &lt;3
---
They do call me sherlock holmes from time to time
---
Imagine not having an organized bank where you don't have to use the search function and just go to the necessary tab and get what you need lol
---
#DontSpoilTheSwamp
---
#DontSpoilTheEndgameToo
---
Yeah true. Just wish my luck would carry over to pet drops etc.
---
You probably won't get banned unless someone does inferno for you but your account could easily be stolen.
---
What is void good for? I personally use it for low level bossing with switches (Barrows, etc)
---
take way too much damage for it to be worth it
---
It's interesting what people spend their time on.
---
Paying them .50 is a lot better than some of the people in this sub whod rather have the venes die off than "ruin our game".
---
Fwiw I think its immoral to pay them such low wages as well
---
so the email service I use has 2fa through text messages.  Like I get a text with a code I must put in if someone logs on from somewhere new.  Is that sufficient? I couldn't find a way to use google authenticator or anything
---
This is dope af!
---
Honestly wouldn't train con or pray first since they don't profit. You'll just be poor but hey you can tele and pray! Better to invest the money into your account via buying gear or runes to speed up a Barrows run. Once you have extra money you can pour that into con or prayer.
---
You can always sell the gear back but you can't sell your con/pray levels back.
---
I did get the 2nd zenyte at 1.1k kills, GL
---
Should of had 69420 all.
---
This man is doing God's work.

just like guthix

MaximusBlack is that you?
---
What’s your reasoning for not wanting battle wards and the summoning feature?
---
How many 200m’s do you have? Lol
---
Big arthritis guy over here, please give me fewer click options for less exp I’ll be happy.
---
I agree with you op, although what is considered EZSCAPE is subjective to everyone.
---
Isn't it a crafting level to turn into tips what stack??
---
I speeld it backwards. It indeed spells god. How have I never figured this out!
---
Telegrab wines of Zamorak. They are 1500 gp each. Only problem is competing with other players.
---
Ah okay, makes more sense.
---
Yeah that does sound like a plan. Sara is decent money but heavily reliant on RNG (1100 kills, 1 acbow, 0 hilts, 6 swords and like 2 lights so far) and Raids seems to be much better to get up to real endgame gear.
---
d
---
Do yourself a favor and stop demanding everyone be fully actualized humans who are happy with their private interests to be displayed outwardly, particularly when those interests carry a stigma.
---
Its just me or its too much for osrs? The details and the whole characteristic of the model is so off compared to what I'm used to. (might be only because I recently did like 30 pretty old quests on my alt and had a hella lot of chat dialouges with faces but yeah you get my point).

Im glad im seeing a post talking about this because to me it seems like there are people willing chose the autism of having to click like crazy like how is that in any way a justifiably positive gaming experience. Saying that the accomplishment is being diminished is such bullshit like what kind of accomplishment is clicking the same shit over and over for hours on end?????
---
Settled must be getting dozens of sponsor opportunities every day. Eventually he will take one up, there will become a point where the pay gets too good not to accept. And that is a slippery slope for the future of the series..
---
So people don’t teleport as soon as they see a white dot on map. &amp; it would deter the low lvl tanks (60s-70s) ruining the fun for pure pkers who just rag until they’re out of food and then just tele away.
---
You hold shift to drop btw
---
Most people hate change regardless of what it is.  People get used to doing something and it becomes THE way to do it.  It will never change my friend you are fighting a losing battle.
---
How do you check this combat log?

Maybe let us redeem points for untradables that are worth it then? Like potions that can be used outside of NMZ?

If you actually enjoyed and supported his content you wouldn't mind the ads. That's his income.

 While the idea itself is pointless and defeats the purpose of restricted ironmen, it isn't Settled who made this post.
---
&gt; but hey, it might help a guy who chose to restrict himself but too lazy to play the gamemode he chose, so lets do it. youve got my vote. 
---
The guy has stated he is going to get 99 hunter using only: lamps, baby imps, and green salamanders. That's just to get the 1/300 chance for a rune-cross bow. In what aspect is that even remotely  "Too lazy to play the gamemode he chose".
---
Just seems like you're contributing motive to the wrong person.
---
I mean like if you're on Arceuus you can't use the typical combat spells like Barrages or Waves. Conjuring was clearly taken away from Arceuus so it wouldn't be accessible to people using ranged or melee only
---
I would like to read about this.
---
Everyone has rent to pay. These things allow him to make content for us. I'm excited that he's taking steps to be able to continue doing this as a full time job for us, who are able to consume that content for free.
---
Ironmen can use shops tho
---
Ayyy thats not a bad idea! Right at my price point (may need to grind some vork so I’m not left in austerity).
---
Did you just start playing again?
---
Unless it’s for PvP. Everyone is fine with “catering” to a specific community until it comes to pkers unfortunately
---
I feel BW is firstly not related to the skill, same with summoning. If this is supposed to be a crafting skill I don't see why it needs so many in-combat features. BW specifically will have a huge impact on the game, and summoning just looks underwhelming and under-finished. It feels like summoning was just thrown into the skill to appease a small portion of the community that miss summoning.
---
Orange man=Trump
---
How is that a non sequitur
---
It's not that hard lmfao. U must be a trump supporter
---
The battle wards will change the entire meta of pvm, while jagex barely explained how it worked. 
---
How does the mind ward interact with zulrahs minions? Will it negate the need for recoils? What about the countless interactions it could have in raids. Will it pull nylos in ToB off pillars? Can it force verzik to focus it? 
---
Not to mention the minion summoning, which is also meta changing. Again, how do the countless interactions affect raids/bossing? Im all for new skills but don't fuck with pvm. The fact Jagex could suggest something like this shows how out of touch they can still be.
---
There are already so many interfaces that are like this. It only makes sense that all of them should be the same. It promotes a feeling of cohesion throughout the game instead of having a different interface for crafting, smiting, fetching, etc
---
Completely agree. Just want people to think about the skill themselves. Most people we hear on reddit just follow the vote no wave.
---
I was kinda sad to see the fires under used. it's a great quest but falls short of master rewards.
---
Maybe I'm just a shitter at Zulrah, but I find that way more click intensive for switches/prayer flicking.
---
- "Who he votes for has nothing to do with his oath."
---
What do you think serving,protecting, and defending the constitution means? Do you think that military members swear an oath to defend a piece of paper in the capital? No, they swear an oath to defend the most fundamental part of our nation; our rights which are listed in the constitution. 
---
They don't swear an oath to only defend the constitution specifically with military might from foreign enemies who would seek to destroy this country and therefore the constitution too. They swear an oath to defend constitution; the oath doesn't specify how to defend the constitution because it means in every way, shape, and form. Once they swear that oath they don't get to vote however they want; if in any way anything they do undermines the constitution then they are breaking their oath. 
---
- "That is his right as an American."
---
No, it isn't. There's no explicit right to vote listed anywhere in the United States constitution, nor is it any American entitled to vote for politicians which undermine our constitution. 
---
- "Labeling dissenting opinions as unconstitutional..."
---
Their positions aren't unconstitutional because they differ from mine; they're unconstitutional because they contradict our rights listed in the constitution. As an example, it's not an opinion that wanting to ban firearms ownership violates the second amendment which states "...the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." That's not an opinion; you clearly need to learn the difference between fact and opinion, between objective and subjective, and between an opinion and a position. Banning firearms ownership violates the second amendment, fact. Voting for a politician who promises to violate the constitution is undermining it, fact. Swearing an oath to defend the constitution and then undermining it means breaking an oath, fact. None of this is an opinion.
---
- "Labeling dissenting opinions as unconstitutional or traitorous, on just the basis that they are dissenting, is literally fascism."
---
1: This is a straw man. I'm labeling unconstitutional positions as unconstitutional because they violate the constitution. What is or is not listed as a right in the constitution is **not an opinion**. When reality is inconvenient for your worldview that doesn't magically transform the difference between truth and reality into a difference of opinion. 
---
2: That's some typical double-digit IQ, NPC dialogue right there. "AnYoNe WhO oPpOsEs TrAiToRs Is A fAsCiSt!@!" When you're on the side of people who burn our flags and chant "death to America", when you're on the side of politicians who undermine the US constitution, you're a traitor. That's not an opinion. Get fucked.

While I don't condone sitting in NMZ 24/7 this is pretty impressive. Its still 1000s of hours of in game time.

Also rank 1 Hardcore for Magic is doing Arceus Library for xp with Runelite.
---
Gotta love him.  He's too good for us
---
Only if we can include a gluten free vegan cheese cape
---
Not just you, this definitely feels very out of place with the rest of the old school aesthetics in this game. Unfortunately, based on the twitter replies, it seems as though this update to older character models is to bring them in line with newly designed elf characters in the upcoming quest, rather than designing newer characters to look like the old.

If he dies, those items stored will disappear too.

This shit has been going on for years, it’s kind of pathetic how bad twitch is at catching viewbots considering how much more popular it is now
---
I’m not gonna lie to you, raids are good gp but they require a lot of rng too, I’ve done about 220 and haven’t got the best rng. They are just a change of pace and are fun to get into, start with chamber of xerics. However if I’m being honestly unless you plan to spend thousands of hours on the game non stop grinding it’s very had to get max gear. I’ve been a pure pker since OSRS came out playing my one acc making anywhere between 2-5m an hour pking and I recently (5 months ago got into playing a main my brother made) it’s fun and it’s a change of pace but I had the wrong mindset it’s insanely hard/time taking to make hundreds/thousands of mils grinding raids. The only way I ever see myself in completely max gear is staking. I had about a 500m bank then went in for a 300m chuck a week ago and got myself arma, ancest and bandos.
---
The day I start playing again. Omg these days
---
Well, Raids but those are more click intensive. All the best gp/h methods are click intensive. Running ess at ZMI altar at 75+ rc is like 3-4m an hour though.
---
thanks lol couldn't figured out how to shift drop
---
A couple months back yes. Havent played since '09 i think. Or whenever EOC came out. Was playing since '02 or '03
---
Toadflax are a safe bet although ranarrs have the potential to make you more.

Not sure what kind of reaction you wanted from this post but...

You'll be back. They always come back

Funnily enough, this is a one-handed "weapon" with an attack speed of 3, making it BIS to melee Nylocas in ToB.

I convinced my mom to buy me a $20 PDF which described some "good" ways to make money. I created a clan with my best friend and we paid a bunch of people to go collect resources for us (feathers, coal, etc) and sold them for a profit. I'm realizing now I owned a business profiting off of the labor of my employees at 10 years old.. I was ahead of my time

You can tell he puts pride in his work. For example, when woox won deadman mode tournament “illegitimately” by out healing fog and was disqualified.
---
Mod ash took responsibility and provided woox $10k winnings out of pocket since it was an oversight on his part. Mod ash is a great guy and great developer.
---
i dont get why theres so much hype for team iron, the whole reason why irons popular is because a lot of team content kinda sucks, i dont see it having any long term stream playability
---
At least it wasn't $11
---
I'll donate when that condescending self centred cunt Magicftail is kicked off the dev team. He's the one that removed jad plugin and trying to remove many more like cerb and gorilla
---
Asked Dinnerbone why 'secret friday updates' were no longer a thing, at his AMA, because I really liked finding new things in-game myself. Next snapshot had no changelog for 3 days. "You can thank Dinnerbone" was the official message. 
---
So yeah, mojang too.
---
If it’s mainly for runescape and you don’t have to worry about money then I would get something wireless.
---
what year is it
---
damn right you will!
---
Am I the only one who thinks it's better to kill an animal than to let it suffer?
---
Depends on what you're looking for. Do you want one with side mouse keys or no?
---
Its BiS for defense pures. This item is the only way to hit 2's with an attack speed of 3 on defense pures without using str pots
---
At what levels does hunter begin to become profitable
---
&gt;Jagex is probably the worst gaming company ever, at least blizzard is still having like 5m+ subs on a mmo after sp many years
---
They've kept a Java-based pixel-click game going and profitable for the last 18 years--and most of their bad decisions was due to their hand getting forced by mass-botters and RWT. Are they a perfect company? No, but they've kept the game going in (mostly) the right direction.

quick everyone donate $11

Besides defense you don't need melee/str for vorkath/zulrah (unless you do melee vorkath which is dumb). 85 range+mage with mid tier gear does just fine. Vorkath especially, most of the gear is free, just need blowpipe, boots, and ring. If you can't afford a bgs use bone crossbow, unironically works good.
---
Yeah his account looks “ average”now but imagine a maxed hcim rank 1 in atk str def and hp with it locked at 200m all, he would also be like 1-2b xp
---
You'd need dragon Hunter crossbow to efficiently camp vorkath. Zulrah requires much less starting capital
---
You'd keep 3 chins from your stack.
---
Yeah wtf, I didn't even risk 500k going into making friends with my arm
---
Ayy did this last night because I got impatient hahaha
---
No way they’d do it for free
---
Meh, I never wear those anyway. I'll start doing them again if they start making tradables that get discontinued.
---
I've wanted to dl your client for so long now, but I'm afraid of going to the wrong site and getting phished. Which ones the correct one?
---
Blizzard hasn’t officially released sub counts in years- where are you getting 5m+? Only source I saw for current sub numbers has it at around 1.7m, with a high when BfA launched of 3.2m. 
---
And frankly, what is different about blizzard now opting to create “Classic WoW” and Jagex creating OSRS? Neither WoW nor RS3 are bad games, but a lot of the player base came in during the old days and play specifically for that nostalgic experience. It doesn’t mean that the new iterations are bad games or failures, just that they don’t fulfill the needs of that target audience.
---
With all skilling methods, pick two: Cheap, Fast, AFK
---
No problem. Once you can do hardwood trees (teak, mahogany...) do then on fossil island. Pretty chill and cheap for farming levels. I personally hate the skill more than agility so that's my route
---
Oh god OSU. The only thing that ever hurt my hand worse was 85-99 con in 2 days doing oak doors. Drawing, playing OSU, AND scape? You're a mad man.
---
I completely agree, hitting the bank inventory would suck big time if you just finished setting it up. I was just teasing him for accidentally hitting it when trying to use the search function.

If you can't come up with an idea for a series the series will fail. The only people who can do this successfully are people with established fanbases that like the content creator, thus care as much about who makes the content than what it is. Even those people come up with ideas and just poll details.
---
I'm at 68 with no bucket

Similar to if you have 100 coins on you. You keep 3 coins.

Don't stop developing it until it's the best it can be please. Cba with further updates and revisions trickling in over the months to follow.
---
Thanks to Cydia Impactor you can essentially sideload apps onto iOS as well, without the need for a jailbreak. The only caveat is that developer certificates only last a week so using Cydia Impactor to install apps means you have to delete it and reinstall it every 7 days, but that would be a small price to pay for having Runelite on iOS. 
---
I don’t even care for 99% of the features I just need a damn overlay for agility obstacles so I can more easily train efficiently on mobile :(
---
D W D does
---
And I now realize I shouldn’t have smoked that last bowl. Thank you sir.
---
Do you really think jagex is competent enough to do this lmfao
---
Oh dang he serious?
---
I can’t even train agility anymore without big green boxes around the obstacles, Runelite has spoiled me
---
the runelite plug in makes it pretty trivial
---
I lol'd at the picture in this post, then I realized your title was complaining about it.

Where can I find their discord?

Damnit, now theyll patch it lol.

Congratulations on escaping my friend

First the map was added to let you know where to go. Whether we like it or not 3rd party clients have shaped quite a bit of the game.

ANY TRUERS HERE?

you have some time when they spawn, you just have to get them before they heal him all the way.  Continue with the one action plan.

* attack one (repeat)

Once you have them all, just kill them. If you can tank them, that's fine too.
---
Maxing without quest cape isn't too odd. There are so many quests that don't unlock anything or provide much use. I, along with many others, saved questing and certain diaries for post-max because they're simply not worth the time is the goal is 2277 total.

I figured it was, then realized + laffd
---
Okay, okay my bad, you got me there, but I'll keep killing it tho :)
---
It helps, but isn't necessary. I did not use the BGS. Instead I saved my coins and liquidated most of my gear to buy a DHCB. At that point the BGS makes a small enough difference it's not necessary.

Your email is the closest thing that Jagex can use to confirm your “identity”. That’s your last line of defense, you didn’t secure it. This should go without saying but your email should be the MOST secure account you have out of any because it’s used as a last resort for pretty much everything. This isn’t a Jagex or runescape issue, this is an email account issue. Secure your shit, people.

It's true that you don't pay taxes on the interest your money earns in a Roth IRA, but whatever you put into it isn't deductible from your taxable income.

I've heard some pretty tragic stories of people giving up the sand casino, and then they have to do the sand casino clue and then get sucked back in. I think that removing the sand casino would definitely cause there to be risk fights in the wild brokered by some cc, but I think it would be a smaller scene than the current sand casino. Just my two cents on it. Not really a sand casino/online gambling addict expert.

 No PvM'er in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly.

Grinding Gear Games is also a really good company when it comes to this.

It's not that simple though.

Some people prefer to play differently to others, that's all.

I mean even if nmz wasn't profitable at all it'd still be worth doing so why would they make it even more profitable?

Kid, you can't even get into your account with that info. You're the one who made a new account anyways because you knew if people could see your post history they'd know you don't have 10B. And you can't post pics of your bank? No pvm pics with your scythe/tbow? Why do you need attention this bad?
---
but bolts arent 0 time are they? dont you have to do the make x/they automatically make 10 sets? If I'm wrong then maybe I will do bolts

So do we lol.. Companies with high turnover rates and large quotas to meet favour it for obvious reasons. No one is forcing you to sign such a contract anyways.
---
If you've afked in there to have a significant amount of points then you have already been rewarded with free(actually profitable), risk-free and zero effort combat xp and shouldnt be rewarded further.
---
if you can't take the heat stay out of the inferno
---
Graduated college and played rs through my junior and senior year. If anything, osrs helped me graduate because it kept me sane while waiting in between classes lol
---
If you actually researched it you’re way off. First several google results so low 60 sell low 80s buy and the exchange to rs3 is 5.6 as of the other day
---
It mostly helps those who may be training on mobile and as a QoL for those who AFK train it. The only way it could buff XP rates is for those who are actively using this method and then saving on second each trip is insignificant in the long run. That's why this is just a QoL update.

So how did they get into your email then?
---
Popular Opinion - Swampletics is directly going to lead to more users playing the game which is good for everybody. Let him has his $10 for selling a shirt..
---
He has 200m smithing so he can make dragon armour, he made ton of rune items
---
no one will believe I got it at 55 then
---
Lie back down.
---
Does it matter? The amount of 200m skills I have doesn't change the fact that I'm right. If you don't have anything productive to add to the conversation then stfu.
---
I wouldn’t doubt that either. I would even take what he said with a grain of salt, since he doesn’t sound like he has the capability to make over 20b. 
---
He’s probably just one of those people who are trying to brag in some weird way. Anyone who actually sells decent amounts of gold knows what BTC is and how to avoid paying taxes on a majority of their gold. Seeing as he knows what BTC is, I think he’s just bsing.
---

I usually suggest on the forums. Do they read the forums?
---
The day of the update so many people were waiting inside the TzHaar area to give the inferno a shot. IIRC Saradomin brews tanked in price because people knew they weren’t gonna be able to complete it so they sold their supplies LOL
---
Get a imgur link ready 😂
---
Do mobile and do tree runs every 4 hours
---
Well somebody already did once, and I think he did it alone or small group of people, if Jagex allowed RuneLite to yoink the original HD assets like OSHD did then they could definitely do it and probably would do for free.
---
Q
---
Honestly interesting topic. Dude made 20k breaking the rules and selling gold for an MMO. Is this income treated regularly like having a full time job?? Is there no recourse for RWT outside of Jagex banning the accounts used to RWT? Genuinely curious, this situation is over 20k but if this guy had made like 50k-60k, I think this could be pretty controversial.
---
password is hunter1 pin is 1337
---
You could run osrs on a potato so I imagine it runs fine on anything that came out last year.
---
that's what he's saying. the benefit of contributing to a roth at his age and income level is much more beneficial than taking the up front benefit of the traditional because this is the lowest tax bracket he will ever be in.
---
Gratz, you can finally stop playing the game!
---
I hope a lot of people can show up. I'm at class right now until the end of the day, but I wish you the best during this time.
---
You can fish octopi, how is a squirrel thing any different?
---
OH SHIT WATCH OUT
---
Idk why I feel so uncomfortable not using the official client. I guess I have a little PTSD from OSB. 
---
I've gotten so used to not having overlays etc that I don't want to feel like I need them.
---
The OSRS Wiki Quick Guides are taking over but do love slayermusiq for first time on a quest.
---
But only those that would otherwise just rot away in bad conditions, right?
---
I believe I’m going to push it back a little while, maybe tonight because a lot of people can show up later (:
---
Then you should probably level up your attack then
---
Can't wait to defeat Sal Vulcano
---
That sounds like a great idea for a runelite plugin, because runelight proper has rejected this idea. 
---
&gt; Shift+click Deposit/Withdraw: Affects XP rates too much on bankstanding skills.
---
Name starting to check out.
---
Maybe the lamp you need to fight them is like a bug zapper?
---
Ofc, my mistake
---
Yes to this. If you can't easily get 2 firecapes you should not be attempting inferno. If you struggle to fight jad 2 times then your gonna have a real hard time fighting 3 of them at once.
---
It matters to less efficient players too. I have some issues with make all but IMO it's overall positive because it's a UI improvement that helps less efficient players AFK more without making it too easy for no reason. I think it should be removed from Karambwans specifically though since those got made braindead easy by the update, and I'm also mixed about it in Herblore because it made the skill slower and less interactive at the higher end but Anti-Venoms before Make All was kinda overpowered.
---
Can you equip a goblin mail now?

But adding a page sink would increase the price.

What, did you have to right click to make jewelry while training crafting to 99? I'm almost halfway there and it's stupid that people think this would change nearly anything.
---
Depends who you call "the team". Jagex? Yeah, probably. Fukong mining co? They couldn't give the slightest shit, and that's the problem.
---
Whats the max amount of xp you can possible get in the game?
---
Yeah and so is fucking excel and everything else you do on the damn computer. Some shit is is just designed bad and just because its always been that way doesnt mean we shouldnt consider and implement improvements because some fuckwit brainlets are shouting louder.
---
Thanks! Will probs have to start uploading fitness stuff soon
---
So you grew a pair of tits?
---
If you actually knew RWT you realize the spread is actually a lot lower. Ask any staker, only a moron would sell through one of those sites. Other sites you can sell direct to players also, not going to name it in case its bannable.
---
they'd have to do it for free otherwise they open a whole other can of legal worms.
---
So what you are asking for is that Jagex completely fuck this item and make a DFS that protects against freeze breath instead AND give +7 Str bonus?
---
Third party clients versus regular client is a lot like keyboard and mouse versus controller. Sure with a controller everyone has an even playing field but then the skill gap is higher. Then again, 3rd party clients also work in such a way that they are optional - these changes aren't optional, they become mandatory if Jagex does it themselves. Then again, Jagex will often do it better than 3rd party clients because they are doing it the "official" way. I guess the moral of the story is, QoL stuff can be complex when you think about it.
---
I still think these QoL updates help the game more than they hurt it, though.
---
This theory sounds amazing
---
No sweat, didn’t think you were :) 
---
Here is the blog where they touched on finding new ways to gather feedback:
---
“We will continually survey all players, rather than just those on Reddit or Twitter, to understand what you think is important from a Customer Support perspective. We’ll use this to inform our priorities and measure our progress.”
---
AKA: “We don’t just want the opinions of nerds” 
---
That’s how I saw it anyway. It’s funny - good on them! 
---
Although that is way more “customer support” specific then I remember it being...
---
Then you know nothing about merching, anybody can make good money merching if you teach yourself how. I started OSRS the day it was released, I made my first few hundred mil flipping outside varrock bank before the g.e and skilling. I'v been merching since 2006 on the RS before 07 was released so I have extensive knowledge on it.  Just because you haven't done something doesn't mean other people can't, I know people who have made even more than me purely from merchanting, here is my recommendation for you: Watch "merchz" on youtube and watch all of their tutorials ranging from inactive flipping, active flipping, low volume items, long term and short term investments and learn graph technical analysis and update investments. You can't make an opinion on something you know nothing about.
---
How do you not believe math? Just show her numbers.
---
This is old news. Like years old bro.
---
85+ for doing them ok. 90+ for doing them a little more efficiently.
---
Nice mate, mobile releasing helped me hit the gym more often luckily too
---
I tried. Sadly, not yet. 
---
Me like red!
---
As statistics are a little more complicated than this I can't give you an exact number, but I can give you a close estimate... I promise this isn't a meme, but this is what I got: 0.0007373%
---
They didn't.
---
Is osrs not quite a big game already? This isn’t like some 3000 player base operation
---
That's so weird... And scary. Try r/androidquestions, r/androidmasterrace, r/techsupport? Please lmk if anything happens, that's quite interesting.
---
Hey
---
Why is nobody doing anything about it? She bots like 1000 views atleast
---
Since when? That wasn't a thing 5 days ago
---
I did my part and downvoted
---
Fuck it makes me feel so shot when I see people with like 1kkc plus w/o muta
---
Most RS3 players are 20+
---
Misinformation seems to be the name of the game when it's comes to osrs though.
---
This happened to my Ironman the other day but luckily I didn’t die I just spam clicked to get out

Na. Stomach and back fat are burning off, also a lot of chest work, as well as my posture.

They look better than they did 11 months ago.
---
I just stuck it out at MlM honestly. Sucked so bad lol
---
Support, but only if u remove net traps since that’s land fishing.
---
NO FEET?
---
Broad Bolts, there's no other answer. If you don't care about how much you have to click (since you'll have to do more broad bolts than darts bc less xp), you unlock Broader Fletching from a Slayer Master and make Broad Bolts.
---
lol, ive merched myself plenty of gold, thats why i know youre full of shit.

Cape of Skulls on literally my first easy clue ever. I'm fucking dead

Winter 2017
---
none of that is necessary for the game, though. and I'm not really talking about those features. but like item tagging, freeze timers, click boxes for things like the agility course...like there's just so much that people use that puts the game on autopilot that like what is really the point?  At that point are you playing the game, or are you playing the client version of the game?
---
See you in a week
---
BuT mUh ClIcKs

Alright. I’ve been using only brimstone ring because of balance and defense bonus but I might try just using seer or zerk ring.

what you meant to say is "I need that instant gratification"

Just wait until warding is released
---
Fastest melee weapon in the game sir.
---
Buyable skills like Construction, Herblore, Crafting etc.
---
All of these “I can’t figure out why!” or “I’m so unlucky I don’t get it!” are so silly. 
---
It’s called RNG. 
---
Random number generator. 
---
There’s no reason lmao. It’s just how it works.
---
neither, it's 1/512 per unique on the table (including onyx).  1/128 of any of them.
---
Perhaps.
---
It definitely is subjective when you put it like that. I personally use a 3rd party client so I can't really talk, but my reasoning for it is more that if other people are, then I'd be putting myself at a disadvantage without.
---
One of the bigger things is that the average age of the playerbase has grown significantly, to the point where I feel the majority of the players I meet have all played back in the day. This comes with the reality that people have less time to spend so naturally, they want to be able to do things with more ease and have the ability to AFK things more. I get it because I too have to work long hours and struggle to keep a lot of other commitments in check. When all is said and done though, I do prefer things to stay the way they are, if not purely for the fairness that there are many who have already endured the grind.
---
My wily turns back into a lazy within 2 rats pretty often too which drives me nuts
---
Depends on what you do and what audience watches you
---
Right so doesn’t that make it a 1/128 drop rate?
---
petition to move circle jerk to the grand exchange
---
&gt; At that point are you playing the game, or are you playing the client version of the game?
---
This is literally the base of my argument. 
---
You *are* playing the client version of a game. A player who hasn't played vanilla client may not like that game so they would quit. It's not a wild or unseasonable line of thought.
---
I run it on a macbook air from 2012 without issue...
---
It’s in the git history of the project. You can find it and download that version of the branch and it’s unlikely the jad thing broke, but if Jagex change the animation id numbers of jad it would break the plug in and you’ll need to update it.
---
As someone who doesn't play the game, this series has been very entertaining.
---
Some QoL is fine, others are really overpowered though. A lot of people called the new banking interface QoL but it was really overpowered for bank skills, especially if you do budget Herblore bc of Super Combats. Something like increasing the clickboxes at Blast Furnace is what I'd consider true QoL. Make All is definitely in the grey area of can possibly make things a lot easier (Karambwans) but can also have a minimal effect and just be more convenient (again easier, but not really that big of a deal IMO since these methods were bad anyways, like fletching Bows).
---
Ok when I looked at the price of this a few days after release it was like 108k or something.
---
Guess I won't be getting one.
---
We decided that we were not going to make plugins for new boss PVM content, and that's that. That's why there's no Hydra plugin.
---
Just would like to note that this probably isnt exactly correct. I don't know how the minigame works, but my math assumes that each event i.e. You can get a rare and a very rare on the same trial or multiple rares on the same trial
---
Me? I know who i am! I'm a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude!
---
I didn't say it's wild or 'unseasonable' line of thought......but I do think it isn't healthy for the game long term.
---
Boom, got em.
---
some guy came into our raids call last night and tried to spoil it but he was talking too fast so no one understood him
---
does it totes your gotes?
---
Lmao
---
They could make him the smithing pet.
---
Yeah I'm not a huge fan of people saying the money goes to "the developers". It goes to Adam and he uses it to pay for the servers, which is a good cause ofc, but it's not like all the people who work on the client are getting a cut of that money
---
I Fletch 1k darts between sets and it's actually made me go to the gym way more often. It'll be even better when I'm doing cooking
---
Who would win, jellies or stick?
---
it doesnt matter what you do if people like you. look at boaty and settled. mr mammal. . .. ice poseidon. . . .etc.
---
Why did this shield for mages gain strength AND a shitload of Range bonus?
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
You can use hespori too
---
I debated holding onto it, but it looks like it's on a solid downward trend after spiking to 29m. We'll see if I regret it in a year
---
Not cool.
---
When your under the age of 10... ITS A SURPRISE
---
Didn’t even think about that. I was actually curious as to know what will be coming next wave. Thank you!
---
Good progess mate. I started playing again in Feb and got 90 str so far just camping sand crabs/nmz while at work. Hoping to get 99 soon
---
Not a crossover I expected to see, but I love it.
---
What are you going to use your extra capes on?
---
the game is not for you
---
Nope.
---
Of course I will. I may rage quit but I’ll keep coming back
---
Removing unnecessary clicks on certain actions is QoL and really doesn't affect ehp as much as you think it does.
---
It's just a proposition to give melee users a shield to use against Ancient Wyverns.
---
The DFS doesn't provide freeze resistance, while the existing (magic) shield does.
---
Why is this so hard to understand?
---
Crazy that the individual probably doing most to attract / retain players short of a few JMods has the highest expenses and gets paid &lt; minimum wage
---
I just did MEII too and I found the wiki to be super useful. The only relatively annoying part was the handholds
---
1 sun or 1 trillion lions
---
Still wrong... 200m fm for 99ish con then Barb for 99 agility and str iirc that's 135m fishing then 99 rc then you can play the game
---
I'm surprised I'm not seeing people talk about cheesing the points indefinitely (solo run) where you dont have to stop at a certain point threshold now. Just rack up the points sub 10% and hardly get hit, and get yourself a 100 reward crate.
---
You made a Reddit account just to make a post and beg for gold...
---
You should learn to use Bitterkoejke's dps calculator and plug your gear in to see an accurate exp rate. But for sure obby is best for you right now. Without piety obby is best up to 93 hp at 94 dharoks is best.

Dwh and dhcb 10000%, you could bring welfare other gear along with those 2 and be doing better than before
---
The wiki guide is fairly good.  A couple of tips:. 
---
When charging all 3 godstaves, don't bring anything extra, and hitting/splashing doesn't matter, so bring full dhides just in case there is a pker there trying to skull trick.  Full brews/restore pots should be enough, but realistically that place is dead anyway.
---
Don't being too much per kill, you can scout out the area beforehand, then return in minimalist gear.  Don't forget to hand in each part every time you kill one, you can't bank them.  The bosses themselves aren't too bad, but they're usually in multi so pkers are your biggest threat.  Just don't bring too many casts and you're set
---
Thanks man, I did it while I was grinding slayer till lvl 97 then I switched back over to nmz till 99. Keep it up, you’ll get there!
---
I’m surprised he is trying to pay taxes lmao.
---
I DIDNT EVEN REALIZE THIS WAS MOBILE AT FIRST
---
In review, all I really want is to provide freeze resistance while meleeing the Wyverns.
---
Jagex pls add freeze resistance to Fire / Inferno cape instead
---
oh no you called me a weeb.
---
You're right I can't make content (or haven't tried?) - how does that make me jealous?

Pretty sure you search the bookcase twice

i wouldnt say it sucks but it def isnt as good

It's funny how the people who wouldn't know why... Ask why... Weird how nature do that

You had 50m with all quests done on combat level 60?

Is the downvote button used for disagreement?

I had mine for 5 years then it gave out. I bought another and I'm still loving it.
---
It was a joke he was making, you are dense
---
Grinded some void during work commutes today: got top, bottom, and gloves. Just 600 points to go and I'll be finished until I decide to get elite.
---
Yup definitely. A buddy of mine just started barrows this past weekend and is stoked. He was getting frustrated because the trash kept hitting him and interrupting while he was trying to check the solutions he had up in another window.

Yeah submit a report using their support system

Try Jagex customer support.

Does this happen on desktop?

On your phone have you tried to clear your login info and re-enter it in, instead of just always clicking to play now when the login screen pops up?

Seeing 30m blood rune up there... my runecrafting brain is in so much pain...

I know why you’re saying but he’s clearly asking 2 in a row i.e. neither have happened yet

Fifa (and i assume madden and nhl?) ultimate team modes tax everything 5% as a gold sink. Nobody *likes* it,  but it definitely works. 1% would hardly put a dent in your bank i promise.
---
Insightful
---
As someone who plays a lpt of old CRPGs and D&amp;D. Osrs are NOT well designed. This is not a matter of fun or not or a matter of difficulty. They are designed around the player having a guide open. Some even use RNG. This is piss poor game design.
---

thats alright pay him back by saying the wrong name at your wedding
---
Same. If it's a hard quest with a crazy boss, slayer does it for me, I watch the fights 2 or 3 times to get a feel for the fight
---
He's a bootleg Albi
---
Add it. Game needs a new skill.

Can't do waste, quicker to take picture on phone.

Why not just delete the GE altogether then?
---
First KC Vet'ion I got ring of God's.
---
Alch yourself
---
Hi,
---
It is because magical spellz give exp for being cast regardless of hit.  If you shoot an arrow at a bad guy and deal 0 you get 0 exp.  But if you cast fire bolt at a bad guy and splash you still get exp.  This is ofc, not true of the two staffs you mention, but they follow the magic damage model that exists in the rest of the game.
---
Im confused on why mage is shit on. Why is it not the blowpipes equal? Its like the bp but shit.
---
Rigour? Damage increase
---
Augury? No damage increase
---
Shit is weird and also dumb.
---
Indie devs are generally pretty responsive. Factorio's devs are the best, FTL's are pretty good too.
---
33 fire capes for 1 onyx seems like it isn’t worth it

True, although one distinct thing he got was the name of a pet from my sisters "bebo", she did one of those quiz things.
---
It does already?

Are you giving it enough time between clicks and not clicking anything else inbetween?
---
I'll take ur spirit shield pls and thanks
---
I am trying to find a decent CC.  Is there a reddit dedicated to finding OSRS clans?

What exactly is this suppose to be? Not the meme but the images?

Youre probably an NMZ chad so I doubt youre hurting anyonea feelings.

I'm at 177million farm exp. No pet. All about RNG

If you don’t like the GE, create an ironman or hop to W2 to manually trade someone. I don’t see why not wanting the GE yourself should mean that all players should be manually trading considering it’s a MMO. Good for you if you enjoy manually trading or have an ironman. I probably wouldn’t play without the GE, it would be a colossal waste of time sitting for an hour trying to get supplies for boss runs. I hated the pre-ge days. If I have 2 hours to play a day, I don’t want to spend more than half that time getting supplies, that’s not interacting, that’s a severe annoyance
---
He pus Venezuelans to play for him... guys a grade A scumbag lol

It opens it on the right hand side at the inventory icon. Which makes tapping twice at the same spot for alching an item like on desktop impossible.

With regards to rewards, sometimes I think a quest gives a reward that doesn't make any sense but you need to do the quest to get the reward. For example, why is the dlong and dragon dagger locked behind lost city? Are dragon weapons even mentioned in this quest at all? Makes no sense. But the ability to use claws being locked behind death plateau makes sense.
---
I did. They replied back saying that "the offence that I've committed is irrefutable.
---
Imagine being mad at a guy making 20k off a game. Lmao good shit homie pay them taxes and make out like a bandit 🤙🏻
---
Could do with cookies or something
---
Aw this video is so cute thanks for xposting it op
---
I've contacted them before but never got any help. All I got was that my ban was irrefutable
---
Ahh get you now sorry! Yeah, this would be a great improvement on what we have. I try to just hover my right thumb over the spot. Sure the muscle memory is there now anyway, the exact way to hold and move my thumb while agility alching.
---
You know damn well what you're doing. You bastard.
---
Thanks for your thoughts. That’s interesting - while I agree with the fact that needing a guide open is poor design, what’re your thoughts on the middle point between kill X and get Y quests vs. OSRS ones? Those are even worse right?
---
Fuck pkers. I died going for mage arena 2 and many tried during mage arena 1...only ever had 10-30k risk but it's annoying getting back and finding them again. Blows my mind.
---
That would take away most of the hype surrounding his videos though.
---
I'd bet you he'll stream ToB attempts if he ends up actually making it there though.
---
Unfortunately working out doesn’t cure Autism sorry guy
---
My guess is that he clicked on his quick prayer that he didn't set prior, and had it on range. Probably wasn't paying much attention.
---

---
&gt; You could run osrs on a potato 
---
i mean maybe if you run the client in non resizable mode...
---
The fire is way cooler, looks sick
---
Well he seemed to click mine every time his died, annoying like
---
IIRC he said that sample got 2 RCB's.
---
If every piece has an equal chance (IIRC that's the case), this includes junk shit that isn't even clue uniques. Getting 2 RCB's in 1200 turns out to be above drop rate, since there's something like ~500 clue uniques alone and easily 100-200 items.
---
Also IDK if it now includes stuff from beginner clues, which if it does it's going to be MUCH more than that.
---
Pee pee poo poo
---
Jesus christ, this comment section is why Jagex should continue to just do what they think is best.  I've never seem so many crying incels over a fucking two decade outdated interface system.
---
QoL: An interaction has been mechanically improved to function more fluently without affecting XP rates almost at all.
---
EZScape: The fundamental XP rates for something have changed decently either due to a direct update or indirect mechnical change.
---
If I can't crank anymore meaningful XP/Hour out of something after an update than all it did was make the interaction more convenient.
---
**Example 1**: Imagine if Runecrafting previously required you to use each individual rune on the altar to craft it (Calm down satan I know), and then they changed it to the system we have now where one click would do the inventory. **That would be considered EZScape**
---
**Example 2**: The exact same scenario as 1, except they add an update so when you use the first rune on the altar, the game will automatically start slowly going through your inventory and making the runes itself until you're out of ess.
---
**That would be considered QoL**.  Your XP rates if anything would decrease using this method because it's slower but it makes about 10000000x more logical sense than example 1.
---
Y'all nibbas need jesus.  People literally getting teary eyed with rage in a comment section trying to defend thousands of hours of tedium in some random kids game.  Let's all learn to gather a little perspective.

20k Deaths, 20k Chaos, 100k Fire runes, 20k Scales.

Only people who know of this place will get the meme really lol

ok the show is great and all but i don't think its some monumental feat to read the wiki and social media of celebrities whose whole lives are documented
---
Do they help save you money on your car insurance
---
Entirely possible; down to your skillset though.
---
Adwaam had done many different attempts and setups, including void and cheapest gear possible, eg: Occult, fury, ancient staff, RCB, Blowpipe

Iirc low run energy makes you fail more than low agility
---
I haven't known half of their guests lately.
---
Yeah, then he would need to fill out a 1040 which would be awkward. What's his job title? Lol.
---
Oh boy more trade scams back on the table.
---
I mean if he's doing RuneLite right now and Patreon only makes enough for the server costs then I don't think mobile suddenly becomes impossible. Besides, I'm very confident they could raise almost any amount with the promise of mobile
---
Nah its cool fuckin crushed it

I think something kinda close like this already exists called "remove tile brading" or something to that effect.

At level 95 you can use fire surge with a base-exp of 50.5, and true- max hit of 36. That's 146 exp. 
---
The trident of the swamp can get a true max hit of 48. That's 96 exp. 
---
For the fire surge, your cost in runes is 460. For the trident, your cost in runes is 525. 
---
Cost per exp Surge: 3.15
---
Cost per exp Trident: 5.4
---
Cost per damage surge: 12.7
---
Cost per damage trident: 10.9
---
Do you see a trade off now? Also trident and sang both have additional bonuses (venom, healing) which should be added to their value. 
---
One is cheaper for exp, one is cheaper for max damage.
---
That's obviously not what we're referring to is it though
---
probably wont he profitable for long now that its automated though
---
NPC Aggression Time
---
I will admit, the clue solver is pretty damn ezscape. And I'm sure there are a couple other plugins that could definitely be considered pushing it as well. But in general, plugins are mostly just stuff that makes it easier to play, not easier to progress.
---
mousepad style. i've only ever used the one drawing tablet i have so i don't feel qualified to recommend anything but the one you're planning on getting looks fine
---
I did that in rs3. Kittens have 15% catch change and cats 50%.
---
That was fun...
---
Idiot i made it with fletching and flipping
---
Fucking hell. That's absurd
---
If you're not casting a spell, then shouldn't it be treated as a charge? A spell gives base xp + 2 xp per damage you hit.
---
A charge, for example a blowpipe / crystal bow / scythe gives 4 xp per charge without any base xp. It still does not make any sense, even if it is not treated as a spell but as a charge.
---
Yep
---
your comment made me smile irl :)
---
You're definitely right there, I'm waiting to see how hard mahogany planks tank. Oh well, cheaper construction exp
---
i recently sold bcp and tassets to buy a dwh for some corp beast, then sold dwh and rebought bcp and tassets after i was done corping. lost around 200k from buying and selling everything. with the tax i would have lost 200k from bcp sale, 300k from tasset sale, and 540k from dwh sale regardless of price change. thats a big dent

Orange man bad:(

It's neat that surveyors through the area gave it its name; I know of a few other naming oddities up north that happened the same way.
---
Tbh. Who gives a shit?
---
If you genuinely think something tedious, boring and unfun shouldn't at the least be improved because it might take like 10 less hours than the old ways, you're the problem.
---
QOL changes are great for a number of reasons. Making a game more accessible on a base level is never a bad idea.
---
are you doing archers too or just b-ring? I would be interested
---
Where do you buy that shirt
---
Scientists are saying the inferno is the warmest volcano ever in terms of heat
---
It it significantly out DPS’s a Rcb and broad bolts so I think it’s ahead of a DCB as well
---
I think it's funny that your complaining about the most broke gp farming method in the form of bossing is getting ruined by ironmen dropping items. How much more ezscape do you want this game? Sounds like you wanna get 4m an hour bossing and if your boss drops lower in value then you're a sad panda.
---
Just do other stuff.
---
On the Ironman note though, I agree that adding that restriction would be cool for ironmen, but at the same time, I don't agree at all with your reasoning behind WHY they should be restricted. Seems ignorant to me.
---
That's horseshit lmfao

Hows that different from whats happening now where you ha e to go download someone elses moded runelite version if you want to scout specific raids or have hydra plugins or have more freedom to reorder stuff? Why is that a better option?
---
The original best player back in 04?
---
I wasnt implying that selling RSVP was illegal, but ya I'm with ya.
---
Ah thanks for clearing that up.
---
It isn't.
---
Oh dang I'll have to try it then. I was getting about 70k xp/hr with DCB + broad bolts + void and using power surge whenever I saw it.
---
Only using runelite does not mean you can’t be phished?
---
I'd buy a second router and connect it to the network to spilt the signal to your room and then use an ethernet cord. Bam.
---
Also, I'm sorry that this is happening to you, but I garuntee you it's the wifi. Because osrs has not been giving me a single problem for about a month straight now.
---
If there is an increase in players, there will also be an increase in people playing the ironman mode, thus dropping those items they do not need to buy membership on the account they play.
---
Bots are always bad for the game, but I am just talking about those ironman in specific.
---
I mean they could also just pay an individual that goes around looking for fake streams and this kind of behavior in general
---
um, hunter2, thank you very much
---
You could make thousands of emails a day if you wanted to. lol
---
So runelite phished me then? Thats the only place i put my info in...
---
It’s the first time I’ve seen it. I lqtmed
---
So whys that a better option? As thats what is happening right now.
---
alright so literally everything else works, and every other game, besides osrs ,but its my internet. Makes total sense.
---
Like if the servers are just shit just tell me so I can get back to wasting my time on my usual BR games and better mmo's that actually work

I guess. I feel like QPC is included when you talk about "maxing."
---
Depends on how much he sells at once. In bulk it decreases your value drastically but in short amounts higher chance of ban (due to frequent rwt) but with more value per gp.
---
I said I'd go for 200m hunter xp if I did not get the chin pet by 30m xp...then 40m, 50, 60, 100, 120m. Finally got it, fuck going for 200m for now. You'll be back sir.

How many of these anti-EZscape players use 3rd party clients?
---
Back in 2004-2006 I made money through new updates.  When barrows came out I farmed the shit out of it and made bank.  Rares were really cheap too, got my hand on a few of those and started flipping.  Also had a post on forums where I'd give people yew/magic logs + bowstrings for their strung bows + 30 gp per bow for convenience and I'd profit by selling the bows for even more than the logs/strings.
---
Staking on accounts built just for staking were awesome as well before they made the Os and 0s look different, but I didn't abuse that as much as I should have.

Never used one of his guides but they do seem quite popular. I don't have the attention span to watch and listen to a video. I need them good words from the wiki!

I feel like there's an anime in the making with this story. Sort of like One Punch Man, this average dude read so much about how to fight different kinds of monsters that he's reached god-like levels.
---
Your wording is disingenuous. If removing 50% of the required clicks only improves the effiecent xp rates by a small amount, then the game is barely made easier. If you call everything that literally makes things easier ezscape, regardless of how much easier it makes those activies, then "ezscape" loses all value. It means nothing at that point. I can't fathom why you would want to click 50% more just for the sake of clicking more. That's not "playing the game more", it's just tedious.

Stats on the accounts?

Actually, HUGE support from me. This would let people "lock" in their pures.

hey you're not supposed to let ur health hit zero, that kills you

I would like to see it eventually added, but not as a skill. Also they gotta make sure the rewards are OP af again

Why did u even ask then if you're not gonna listen to advice?
---
You forgot the 3 or 4? other title games they have made billions on. Jagex doesn't have billions lol
---
not on somebody else's account
---
Woosh
---
I figure I'd notice in Battlefield or Apex if I was experiencing it this often. it's been a pretty consistent thing for the last couple days, and made training pretty unbearable. When I hop on other games its definitely not like this at all

Just remember 2.4 maxes out at 144meg which realistically you won’t pull anyways. It’s also way more susceptible to inference. Anything from Bluetooth ,microwaves, or neighbors could cause it. While the range on 2.4 is better you’re sacrificing speed and stability. Just a heads up. Also if you have ANYTHING in your house for some terrible reason still using 802.11b you’re in for a bad time.

Trick question, by definition if you're a trap, you're cute.

Mine was a Brazilian girl. We actually talked over MSN messenger using our web cams. We did quests and shit together and trained. Even scammed a few people together as a duo to make our banks better. She got into modeling and about a month into it she stopped logging into both MSN and RS. Considering this was Brazil and she kind of lived in a shit area, hoping nothing bad ever happened to her but documentaries of Brazil kind of cloud that bright thought. That was about 12 years ago.

Yeah, I don’t see much difference. Nice work, but this looks like a week of progress.

maybe if they make 50-60k each. You ain't doing that shit on 40k total
---
d plate looks very nice in his defense
---
Yeah I think he should continue as a series until he gets TOB, stream the attempts, and make a series finale for when he finally gets his drop
---
Damn this would be so cool, also seeing as the base colours of BP are tanz themed already having it turn green with tanz mutagen so it goes with the green ranged theme would be cool to see. 
---
They said in the Q&amp;A that they had problems with this before cos they didn't have enough devs to dedicate time to QA test but it may be more viable now with them having a more extensive team now.

and the top
---
I can't get a router in this room with my living situation, so the advice is pointless lmao. I tried to state that multiple times, but apparently the English language is really fucking difficult for you lot
---
I think that would be 1/32k chance. 
---
Rate of getting one fang with one of Zulrahs drops is 1/256. So to get the second fang as well it's just 1/256 * 1/256 so 1/64k 
---
But there are two combinations of getting this drop so you divide by 2. You can get fang 1 and then fang 2 OR you can get fang 2 and then fang 1. They're both equivalent to us; we'd never know which order they came in since the items are identical. So divide by 2 and it's 1/32k.
