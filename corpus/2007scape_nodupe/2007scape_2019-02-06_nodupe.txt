Just started playing and I'm combat 90 with a bank of 15 mil, while you have 144mil in drops.
---
---
---
flair checks out.
---
Not to take away from the achievement that is maxing a UIM, but lowlander tanked bosses on his main account for his UIM... then complained about hidey holes/zulrah storage devaluing UIM. Kinda hypocritical and shady.
---

---
Also pretty sure he was the first HCIM to get a sigil and pretty much did shady shit again by speccin Corp on an alt before it was patched..
---
Well how often do you repot? If u let ur str and atk drop down 3-4 levels like i do before repotting and it gives a max hit for any of those levels, its worth it
---
If your account is that jacked, yeah.
---
What stats do I need for that?
---
This exact same thing happened to me too!
---
The one I got looked way more real but defiantly fake and in the junk box lol 
---
This has been brought up several times. The "solution" mentioned was a Sandstorm lunar spell that fills all empty buckets with sand.
---
No poll as of yet, however.

You missed the point of the post it seems

Most bosses and almost all endgame content does not have pure melee involved, so most of the time Barrows is still better to take.  The only pure melee bosses I can think of would be K'ril, Graardor, Cerberus, and some wildy bosses (can all be ranged or meleed, depending on setup, but none of them involve switches). 
---
Almost the entire rest of endgame content is either exclusively range (Vorkath, Hydra) or involve all members of the party switching combat styles (Sire, all of TOB and COX, etc).

Cheers, I'll drink to that bro

I made an account again and started playing because of mobile, now I play more on the PC again thanks to Runelite but am still super thankful i can play on the go randomly. Love that it works so fucking smoothly on mobile too, 50fps no dips like ever so far just going around doing stuffs. Only like 600 total skill atm so not very high but still much enjoyment
---
Where do you live?
---
We do
---
Nah, I got a list of goals to follow post max not worried at all

---
I feel ya. I attempted my 5th try and failed with the same stats as you. Since then I’ve trained my ranged exclusively and it’s now lvl 76. I still can’t afford a BP though so I’m waiting to buy that before I get back to Jad. 
---
Also, turn off Public when you’re pvming. I turn it off because there’s bound to be someone giving me crap for wearing an Ardy cloak at my level.
---

---
To add, how is emptying pouches on mobile? That seems like it'd be the worst part.
---
Are you trying to cancel the one month you paid for or stop it from making future payments?
---
He told him that mithril is blue instead of purple. Cough virtoso cough

---
Why do we need pill results hidden? 
---
Yeah i used to just run across to the other side to be safe. Itll come with repetition, and also challenging yourself in small consistent ways.
---
You dont gain xp while running for someone else.
---
Tithe farm is an abomination. They sound make it an actual farming minigame, not whatever this current thing is.
---
Although I agree this is insane, please note this is not possible without having first 98+ on a skill. If huge lamps are used on a brand new level 1 skill, you'd get 5 xp as opposed to 3.4k xp drops this player is getting.
---
In other words, yes, it is insane and should not happen but for this you need the hefty pre-requisite of a 98+ skill to get these xp drops.
---
You just chat in and get it refunded lol
---
Should HAVE*
---
There’s a clan chat to find people you know? ‘Osrs Soa’
---
stop it from making future payments
---
For input on the rest of you post. Construction. I never knew how amazing it was to have a max house before I had it for myself.  I regretted waiting as long as I did. 
---
I got used to it pretty quickly tbh, I tried initially to change to one click right click but that just slowed down everything so much. I really don't have a problem emptying the pouches,  I've already long pressed while they're being crafted!
---
No xp waste 
---
&gt; even if people argue the stats aren't that much better than combat bracelet
---
They are just flat wrong.  Especially when using a D Scimmy, the extra strength bonus compared to Regen Brace can mean *two* extra max hits.  Considering this would mean a hit of, say, 26 increasing to 28, that's actually a very big difference.
---
A whip + fury + d defender with regen brace alone, versus the same setup with barrows gloves is about a 4-5% increase in dps.  Then you add fire cape and berserker (i) and overall you'd be doing about 15-18% more dps with the "harder to obtain" gear. That's huge.

Haha I actually found a rune axe head on the ground in lumbridge once . Made my entire week by selling it in the general store for 5k
---
Cool, I'll give it a shot then. Thanks!
---
Oh really? Woops... Thanks for letting me know! 
---
It takes like 20 extra hours of quests to get 175 QP.  Most of us would so much rather watch ~~cooking happen for 12 hours~~ Netflix than ~~do quests for 20 hours~~ take the wrong gear, wrong spellbook, wrong items, fail agility obstacles, and choose the wrong text option.
---
HA 
---
Oooh wilderness patches, good concept
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Non Ironman, should probably upgrade the gear a little or skip the task buddy 
---
Hmmmm.... If you need a desktop to do agility you have some serious issues. There is nothing hard about either of those skills on mobile at all.
---
"Im gonna hyuck you up"
---
you dont gain exp tanning hides, or buying things from shops to sell on the GE but people do that for 300-1m an hour anyways
---
Did my first bursting task ever last week and did the exact same thing. 
---
Because you dont gain xp while running for someone else.
---
All personal preference I block all dragons and spiritual creatures personally and sometimes black demons
---
I don't care about the xp. I just don't want to spend hours walking back and forth for a skill. It's so tedious and annoying. I want other training methods. 
---
Wym you can't wear them? They don't have a req to wear aside from the quest
---
Q
---
Good to see more uim in the game :)

There’s only 1 reason to do this. Your only plan on your account is to pk. Otherwise it’s just stupid to do.

Also, if you account that you only plan to pk on has 80 prayer then lul.

Nice

Trombone and tuba you fucking scum lord. sick repost no credit. Dead to me 😤
---
Its an unavoidable part of the game and in no way is it a problem they should deal with. If they try to account for players not wanting to include randoms then we will never get high level content again.
---
As of now demonic gorillas even though my droprate is 4/2010. It's a decent moneymaking slayer task, even without zenytes, and I'm pretty comfortable with the switches
---
Thanks for this, really appreciate it!

Lol I forgot to click a few links other than just redeeming it on twitch!
---
Life's not fair aswell lil dumbfk
---
Look up chymistry's discord, they do weekly leeches I think
---
There is a guide on YouTube that will let you complete every F2P quest besides dragon slayer in like 30 minutes. It’s called multiquesting! Also runelite is better than OSBuddy just an FYI lol
---
I mean, you can kinda do that too with OSRS and all the buyable skills. 
---
How do drops work for bossing with teams? Do all items drop for the person who deals the most damage/finishing blow or is it totally random?

Thanks in advance.

Of all the possible answers, you chose the only wrong one. 
---
Everything people do in life is influenced by or directly related to goals, desires,emotions, whatever you want. There's a variety of reasons to PK; monetary benefit, thrill, to practice to better yourself, or just plain sadism. Maybe some people draw a line on what value kills they want to pursue or draw a line on killing random people doing their business for moral, efficiency, effort reasons. But people don't do things for no reason, because if there was no reason they wouldn't do it. 
---
I was screenshotting the yellow text in the game and cropped it out because I don't know where to get that font. xD

I drew everything without a pen, this is a pain

if there is multi zone for normies then there should he multi zone for ironmans. i vote no
---
Thank you, I'll look into multiquesting. Huh, I didnt know of runelite lol. I just found a reddit thread about OSBuddy being used at school, I'll have to get runelite- Thanks for the tips!
---
You used all your rng for the year on the heads
---
It goes by whoever dealt the most dps 
---
Yeah take how you're currently feeling and multiply it by 5 years and you have the high level community. A lot of the endgame ironman accounts have over 365 days of gameplay on a specific account. This game is notorious for addiction because of the dopamine hit you get from getting that next level and getting that rare drop. It's contant goal setting and completion which makes you want to do more
---
Happy to help:)
---
This damn bridge is still not added to the game yet????
---
only 18 nest with egg? wow, thats crazy
---
lmfao this is hilarious, and is perfect!
---
Depends what you're using and on your skillset. I use around 1 prayer dose per kill depending on how confident i'm feeling with 1-tick flicking and how much health I have.
---
5 prayer doses per kill is *a lot* if you ask me. I turn rigour off during tbow respite/ cooldown period til it can fire again and keep my protection prayer up unless i'm flicking.
---
Just under 15 years on one and just over 12 on the other.

Regarding Slayer - returning from a long break
---
Which tasks are worth cancelling later on?

Should I save a majority of my points to make sure I can cancel/extend tasks rather than Slayer helm?

What are your favorite tasks?

lol. Runescape is so good though-

You're doing God's work, thank you bb

What are you, an over the top rs streamer?

Can cave horror be added to konar's slayer task?

Holy moley you just described my entire life, substituted with afking magics at work instead of NMZ. Keep fighting the good fight my man

Is there. Subreddit about OSRS that is less memes and more about the game?

Yeah I just use a BP and keep rigour on pretty much the whole time
---
What’s the best Ironman Zammy inven?
---
Rn I bring arclight, dwh, whip for kc (lost my dboots so I’m doing mages and imps normally I just do imps with dwh) brew, restore, prayer pot, sanfew, pure set, 3 karams, and mantas. I feel like I run out of food super quick but I usually get 2 kills sometimes 3 record is 4. I don’t have the mage for blood barrage but I could imbued heart for it but then it feels like I use up too much inven space (no time pouch btw). 
---
Any help is greatly appreciated really just trying to have a conversation about zammy tbh. 
---
uh I don’t think that’s possible?
---
wow dude how did you iron yourself
---
*when you use guthan’s in the first place

Stay strong too brother! How are you afking magic, splashing? Id like to do magic after melee too since I have 1.5 years of school left

I fell for it because I had just started playing OSRS again, I had never watched OSRS on twitch, didn't know who Woox was, and didn't browse any OSRS media like this subreddit.  I had no reason to ever expect that the most viewed stream for OSRS on twitch would be a view botted phishing account.  I thought it'd be cool to watch an OSRS stream for the first time and just clicked the most viewed stream.
---
I had just pulled an all nighter doing a project and was just looking for something to watch while I ate my dinner, so I really wasn't paying attention at all.  Learned my lesson, but I just started playing again so I didn't really lose much really.
---
I started about 4 months before mobile lol. You should definitely use runelite as opposed to osbuddy. I made the mistake of using OSB for a while...
---
What elemental staff is best to make for alching?
---
I was coming to say "hes practicing tek" as a joke. Turns out thats actually what it was
---
Interesting I didn’t consider that, thanks!
---
Dw man over the long long run it should all level out. I was like 12 arcanes to 3 dex at the start but eventually you will get that bow split :) 
---
Idk why people are downvoting you it was hilarious lol 
---
Yeah I'm also not a fan of stealth missions lol
---
Have you seen one guy one jar?
---
Awesome thanks for reminding me! Standby!
---
Hah congrats!
---
Woah, that was quick. Thank you for all the answers. Runelite it is then.
---
Teleblock yourself. 
---
Wasnt it Addy Scim?
---
The exp should be comparable as long as you have void and the anguish, idr if that exp rate was before or after the damage nerf on void however, but I'm sure there's a load of videos to double check
---
Lol imagine complaining about other people's sexual names when yours has thot in it.  IMAGINE
---
Only started doing them after like 400-500 kc of raids with clan and when there wasn’t people online. I also got my first tbow split as a duo split in a mass ffa but doing 3+1, 4+1, 5+2 etc are much better 
---
Ya every quest that I've done that was supposed to be difficult turned out to be pretty straightforward. Only one that was particularly long was mep2. Pretty cool puzzle tho
---
Did you use falador kiteshield 4?
---
You can also probably get prayer and herblore with the construction ;) 
---
I used guthans and range
---
I've almost killed 2 at one point.

you never got a clue nest? that's some crazy rng.

Yeah, I just switched over to Runelite rn lol. Thank you guys for telling me about runelight!

Barrows

Hardwood can only be done every three days, by the way.

930kc and made like 1b. Crazy how rng works.
---
New tasks, new gear, and new areas. Nechs/dusts go from 20k/hr melee to 100k+/hr barrage tasks. Smoke devils are 150k+/hr. Kodai, ancestral, bandos, rapier, blowpipe, etc. Slayer points, slaughter bracelet. It's important to note the updates were probably needed to keep the game alive and from stagnating, but slayer is much much faster than release

Last thing I've heard from Jagex was use them at your own risk but you won't get banned for using them. I believe Runelite and OSbuddy devs work with Jagex to avoid them triggering bot detection and they've removed plug ins when Jagex asked them to.
---
being able to trade someone items or cash without their trade offer being close to (within 25k I think) your offer.
---
Watch where the blob spawns on wave 3. If it doesn’t spawn south of Italy boot, you can continually reset fight caves until you get it to spawn there. 
---
The wave 3 blob spawn is where Jad will spawn, so you’ll know if you have a good spawn very early as opposed to watching the orange mage spawn before jad.
---
Right on
---
Yeah wtf
---
We should raid sometime and change ur luck ;) I like ur name lazysingh :p when your online add me or hop into my clan and say hi. “Elysium cc”  I havnt found any Sikh brothers on rs yet

---
&gt;Let's try this again then.
---
Please.
---
&gt;There is no point in throwing in hundreds of hours into developing a gamemode that will not function as intended
---
Stop, I really don't want to nitpick you, but you either a. don't know what intended means or b. don't understand what it implies. So you keep saying "it won't function as intended"... but if the intent is to allow people to play multiple iron man accounts in a group, then the intention is met, and this situation is not an unintended consequence. Please tell me if you still dont' understand.
---
&gt;and will increase the alt-scape phenomenon.
---
Why does this bother you? More subs = more money = more updates.
---
&gt;The highscores will be dominated by the groups which has the most efficient alts.
---
That's fine. I personally think GIMM should be purely "for fun", with infinite group sizes (or at least really large), and the ability to add new players (FRESH ACCOUNTS ONLY) at any time. This isn't a bad thing.
---
&gt;At some point, the gamemode just becomes normal accounts.
---
Sure. And this hurts you... why? You keep making the argument "I don't like this, I don't like this!", that isn't an argument. Saying that dev time is better used elsewhere is a valid argument, but this is not.
---
&gt;You're also gonna get fucked if someone in your group leaves, there will be a lot of disputes.
---
Yup. There will be problems that need to be solved. I thought of at least 3 different solutions to this problem as soon as I read it. That's the nature of making any new piece of content, It's not as if they go through any update without any critical thinking. I think they'll be fine.
---
&gt;Maybe you prefer to tread water, but I prefer that the game moves forward with actual game content.
---
I do too, and a lot of other people seem to also want group iron man mode so let's move the game forward with more interesting game modes.
---
Don't forget that the clan rework/friends list expansion are also tied to this area of development, so any of these types of updates also indirectly significant boost the other. How long has the community asked for an update to the clan system? Since it was released in like 2007? It's long overdue that we got better systems in place there, search the reddit for "cc spam" or things along those lines. I'd love to see clans evolve to the next stage ingame so that the game becomes more feature rich. There's a large amount of people interested in group iron man mode too. Let's make it happen and move the game forward to where it should be. You want to hold all of this progress back because it hurts your feelings. I don't know what else to say, sorry?
---
You're just trying to milk karma right now
---
Meet swampletics.
---
Honestly doubt it he’d probably be down. Regardless he’s still in front by quite a lot and would have the opportunity to develop metas and give him a reason to play on his acc again. But yes it would also be like another 1000 hours to 200m so rip to that 
---
Yeah bud we’re already at 9, so it’s not even a hyperbolic statement, it’s just factual as there’s going to be a tenth soon iirc.
---
My plans were barrows gloves, fighter torso, dragon defender and slayer helm next...
---
^^YEET
---
Okay so Processor speed is 3 to 3.9, processor type is amd a9, ram is 6 gb, laptop game graphics is amd Radeon r5 and a 5400 rpm hard drive. Idk if I sent right stuff or not but I figured this might help amd a-series A9-9420 duel core processor it also said that too!

There's also an archery shop in rimmington, South of Falador. Can't think of any more stets that drop bows
---
Also 85 and I do this with fire cape all the time. How can people be 115cb and not have one
---
This is so me I’m like 91 slay 1516 or so total
---
you should only be able to plant snapdragon seeds there
---
Why is his defender so smol
---
Wtf is swampletics? Been seeing this everywhere i skill people talking about it
---
May Theoatrix’s divine grace bless your soul.
---
Generally not very much. It's just a rare spawn with extra health and damage, maybe a special attack or two to dodge or pray against. Some, like the bloodveld, are literally the exact same with more stats. Marble gargoyle has a special attack you have to walk a tile away to dodge. Just a few examples.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Superior_slayer_monster
---
1/200 chance to spawn when you kill the slayer monster and they give extra xp and 3 rolls on the normal monster's drop table. They also have a chance to drop some valuable uniques like imbued heart or eternal gem, and a guaranteed totem piece in the catacombs.
---
Yeah he didn’t get hacked for just his wealth. His acc was probably a Zulrah bot which is why it was banned, leaving some wealth on the account. They likely cleaned the loot off of the account every 6-10 hours of farming gp. 
---
Look on the wiki...
---
Firstly change your name, then just do slayer, once you get to the higher levels the money is great
---
my favorite series. keep it up boss. 
---
thats my mentality every time i go to the sand casino, it's part of my pain and pleasure
---
Im level 119 and i've taken several 6 month+ breaks since release of osrs. I joined a pvm clan at the end of last year and started bossing for the first time and ive barely stopped playing since. Getting that first hilt  and tasset drop was such a good feeling and you're always left wanting more
---
I’d definitely recommend getting that slayer up two levels to 75, and then camping out at Gargoyles with Guthans. Even without guthans, still great money and cb xp
---
I know.
---
But it's still good gear, and I could think of real budget gear they could've used instead.
---
Also a good shot at a couple hundred k bonus loot!
---
Also more points per task overall
---
Dont expect it to come out this year. The team is still busy with mobile and MMK stated that group ironman would be only considered after mobile (although since mobile needs constant support, I don't see how or when they will ever add it). Me and a mate have just started an unofficial group iron man. Of course you can't compete with other groups via highscores or show that you have kept to the rules at all times, but we noticed that we don't really care, as long as it is fun to us and we keep to the rules we get enjoyment. 
---
So I'd say be like the original one-man-army, do it unofficially, theres nothing stopping you unless you don't trust your friends.
---
You read the guides? I just look vaguely at it and wish for the best. 
---
Yeah I used to do that when I was a low level but I hated getting to jatizso. I have frem sea boots 4 now so should probably unblock them but dont know if I can be bothered
---
True - Eternals, mages book, blowpipe, toxic trident fury etc.. probably like 30m so not too bad. 
---
I wish friends list worked with request &amp; accept can s this is cool but for anything in wildly would be too easy to track some ppl down
---
Get back to the abyss pleb

Can we please get a nsfw tag?  Seriously...children play this game...

Ah fair, I get 40 steel and thats a fat skip

Ah, before islandscape

15% chance you have to runecraft 
---
That’s like saying 1 med clue 5min got 16mil that’s 192mil/hr best gp 
---
I wish I was good at sand casino, but luck doesn't seem to side with me there. I'm max melee stats and use tent whip, but I still seem to lose way more often than I win.

You are 100% correct.

I'd bet even at least 3.2M
---
Seers bank is actually very good for certain skilling activities.
---
There's a specific tile where you can deposit and withdraw items without ever opening the bank. I made a short video to show what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1GQW_Qa5Mc

I'd say around 800k-1 mil an hour or so, probably a little less when starting out.

Ohh haha magic trees, I was thinking you were training magic. Nice dude! I'm doing my MBA (masters business administration). Yeah man it's only temporary and it'll hopefully pay off in the long run, we got this!

Guaranteed 30 damage from a spell that only requires 79 mage, has no quest req, and allows teleblock?? Lul
---
Standard spell book is already viable. You're just trying to make it seem like it's not.  Why are you trying to make it sound like ssb can't deal damage? Fire surge has the highest max hit of any spell.
---
Sure, I don't know to be honest I always barrage them but it's the only thing I can think of in kourend that will have decent drops. If you don't care about gp and just want totems then I'd recommend greater demons. Almost impossible to die there with guthans 
---
LMAO
---
The lack of fire cape is rather damning though so you got a good point 
---
Why word? Word do trick?
---
but why? i understand faster kills but kill time is barely faster than killing the normal dragons...and more slayer exp
---
I don’t get it jewboy

**Swampletics**

Probably just have your explorers ring equipped.

I had my one friend who introduced me to the game back in 2006 come to my most recent 99 fishing, so that was nice.

And if you catch one then your Hunter xp resets

Not in the traditional sense of the word "safespot".

You can freeze and farcast the melee brothers.

There is also a flinching method for the melee brothers.

Yeah as far as inner lip tats go this is simple and funny, good job handling the pain and the backlash from anyone tryna shit on it

True, but the demonic skull is used almost exclusively for abyss runecrafting.  Between defensive abilities like freedom, anticipation, and resonance; evasive abilities like surge; and the fact that you can use a phoenix necklace since you can use a wilderness sword instead of a glory for edgeville teleports it's almost impossible to kill people there.  It used to be fairly easy to get kills there when you could hide your avatar under a skull ball or with a ring of coins, but people complained about it and now you can't use those items in the wilderness anymore.
---
bad move now they know why you're on the john so long
---
Drops are independent of levels
---
Keep in mind he never used Piety either, and that increases the difference.
---
I wouldn't exactly call that a good decision, but it's your body I guess. Looks painful as fuck though.
---
In that case your only option may be the Phoenix Crossbow from the Shield of Arrav quest
---
Already on my list of to-do’s
---
I use runelite.net in my opinion it's the better of the choices just be sure to only download from that site as there are a lot of backdoored fakes getting around.
---
Ha. Nothing going on... Let some first sausage come in and see Marines on their phones. Then shit'll be going on. Lol

That's a good idea I should just do that. But you can only tag the full stack right?

Do you have any plans to fix the broken clan chat system. currently the rejoin feature when you hop worlds breaks it and are unable to join any cc.
---
It’s literally clicking 2 prayers and that’s it. Literally just don’t take it too fast, attack healers when you get a prayer switch right and have the time. Or if you have some spare dragon darts to bring with, you can just out damage the healers and afk that shit.
---
It's almost like that was the point.

Random question but how much ranged exp did you get for 1k kills?
---
1k KC and only 5 wrath tallys? That's the real achievement there! I had 5 within the first 100 kc... 
---
generally low level barrows is done with ivan's staff (trident if you can afford it) and a crossbow (blowpipe if you can afford it). Big emphasis on prayer. I would look up a guide and maybe get 60/60 magic and ranged before going in.
---
I felt stupid on my lvl 94 wyvern alt account without barrows gloves.. guess what.. i got them and now my wyvern alt is becoming a rune dragon alt. 
---
Neat

This fascinates me.

even the ball was surprised
---
Just to add onto this, if your money is all in gear and you’re super broke, start off at vorkath or zulrah. CoX, Kree, and Cerb can have massive dry streaks that drain supplies, but vorkath doesn’t have that. Just do vorkath until you have the supplies to do something like 40 raids and you should be fine.
---
only use would be for herbiboar basically so not much harm to add
---
Damn thats rough man, good luck rebuilding!

I think a lot of lures these days are actually designed around the target attempting to anti lure.

The only person who gave any kind of answer as to what the rarity is, is some guy that heard its 1/75k. Based on how long this took me, I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be true

How about def?

Yeah, my overall level is like, 120 or something. I need to do some bossing probably. I've been focusing way too much on farming defense for some nice armor, which I have black armor, but that rune armor tho- lol.
---
You got so lucky its unbelievable I went from 500 - 700 KC with 3 drops in my name and 4 not. 
---
mfw the meme gets more upvotes than this
---
if the goal is to fill in gaps I can think of about 20 other skills with more pressing needs than slayer lol
---
also considering how regular nechs are such a good task as-is, the boss would  need to have some pretty op rewards to not be dead content on launch
---
me too dude. Kicking myself for only doing 200 or so kills before the most recent nerf

But don’t you see the floating head and the floating hands?

I was fine with DT until the boss you need the ring to see would not spawn for me. It took me over 30 minutes to get him to spawn...

I just jab at the general area a few times then remove my finger to see if I hit it, the percent shows for a few seconds so it usually works.

Pro tip for ZMI. Don't follow someone. Use and essence on them. The pathing is better and is less effort.

I think this player is referring to Ironmen accounts. A lot of them do KQ for wines which isn't too fun.

So making mage prayer not half the timer didn't pass lets buff it even more? That makes so sense.

Can we see some benefit to cutting player-grown redwood trees inside the Farming Guild? This requires 90 Farming and days of growth time and yet it is way more efficient to cut them at the Woodcutting Guild because it is faster.

Get a q p w underneath pubes
---
What branch my guy

Depends on the artist/parlor, and most I've seen in the PNW won't do below 18. 
---
Rah.
---
That defeats the point of untrimmed capes though, it's supposed to be your first, not one of your choosing.
---
It isn't nice at all that people with multiple 99s and no untrimmed would miss out, I'm with you on that. But for the long term, and for the people who come after you, it would be a massive improvement. Don't make them suffer just because you did.
---
Herb sack from farm guild makes so much sense. Maybe 300 contracts completed so it still takes a few weeks to obtain? Then give it a purchase cost of 100K or something.
---
Keep in mind that the xp curve is exponential. 92 in a skill is only half way to 99. Yeah membership is essential to continue the game, it technically is more efficient to get it ASAP but I think if you're new to the game you should finish all of the non members quests, get rune armour and green dragonhide before you subscribe. After that the amount of content in membership is enormous

I’ve had mine for seven years and you can still see what it is.

How crap you got lucky with your mega rares. What group size did you do on average? 3-4?
---
Flawless execution
---
never really worth the time, only do it if ur an ironman
---
Im not from america but i always noticed that a lot of players in runescape were actually in the army
---
The wilderness has a much more dangerous and curious feel to it without the ditch. Hopefully one day it will get removed.
---
We Do Raids is an incredible resource to use. They even have their own website and deticated very active Discord. You'll probably be able to raid any time of day once you're into standards.
---
It’s to give us some civilian skills as well as make us “well rounded” leaders. They want marines that are not only proficient in training in combat skills but also be proficient in an office/typical work environment. It’s dumb as hell and usually everyone’s pretty belligerent about it, but we have to do it in order to promote. 
---
What lvl was ur presentation 
---
Same dude its nice to be back.
---
Well over the course of 1k kills you probably won’t get the exact same amount of each drop but it should be close I would think. 
---
Depends how many emails you can make. 
---
Best 30-50m you'll spend you womt regret it

Looks like it's time to ban runelite again 🤔🤔🤔

How does getting muted even work these days? Can you curse and get away with it, so long as it isn't racist/actually offensive?

Would you ever consider adding a Phishing option to the report screen because there isn't a distinct option for it and reporting them for scamming isn't an option because thats to do with in-game scamming anyway its kind of becoming a big problem as there everywhere at the GE spamming and now DMing people too saying stuff like: "quitting rs l00k up "rulebreaker69l0l" on y0utub3 once done steps trade me &amp; recieve 100M!!"

Writing this because when I was a noob I lost my account to this and I really hope you take this into consideration.

Love my Ardougne cloak with zamorakian hasta/devout boots/proselyt almost everywhere no one even calls me out for it. I call it comfy slayer and taking with piety up.

Your loot is above average. With a 3 man average a drop is an average of 1/12 or 8.333%. Your drop rate was 14.636%. Mega rares will usually make up around 8.7% of your drops combined together. Your mega rare drop rate was 9.937%. So even if you're running higher player counts, your mega rares are still over represented. 
---
Also CoX is almost exclusively reliant on good rare drop rates and specific good drops, which you absolutely got. Calling this average is incorrect and below average is painfully laughable and depicts a very dishonest rate for newer raiders.
---
well by decent kc i meant a few hundred plus, anyone thats doing raids seriously what always try improve and alting is just the next step.

Take a break for the rest of the day/night and watch a movie or something. Mistakes happen :)
---
I was thinking the same thing! Pretty interesting 
---
Do we really want all this work going into the Farming Guild and Redwood Tree farming especially just to be wasted? Atm people only plant them for experience.. 
---
I'd like them to have an effect like the ones in the woodcutting guild so people actually cut them in an area with cool scenery.
---
Didnt consider the fact that I could actually lose it, so I just flexed on the lurers and played dumb to think they hit the jackpot. But clearly they did hit the jackpot as I am a retard.
---
Hope you showed them the drill sergeant random
---
panic buy asap
---
nice progress bro keep it up

You're right, with bladed dive and surge it's impossible to die, especially because any pker loses all adren and can't rush you properly in eoc.

Couldn’t agree more.  I see no reason for the xp in attack and defense when mounting my kq Head..I’m a very specific build and doing so would ruin my account build.  I grinder kq for countless hours and now can’t even mount my head because it gives attack and defense.
---
Yes

Your username is interesting

No body bothered me at all in the arms room. My job requires shift work, so someone always had to be in there and I got lucky to work mids. All 8 hours was runescape unless we had monthly inventory.

This is just my raids alt, I got 99 mining, fishing, wc, hunter and others whist raiding but only got agi, slayer and rc left to max so havnt been playing on both at the same time recently. 
---
I hate slayer

GPU settings, Draw Distance
---
Also consider turning on the Skybox plugin as well
---
Go to NMZ, it'll take less than a day (7-9 hours) of AFK grinding to get to level 70 (calculating between 50-70k exp an hour using max strength gear for your level). 
---
You can use obsidian armor/weapon and a berserker necklace. I get around 80-90k exp an hour there using that setup, and the benefit is that it is AFK, so training will go by quickly if you are doing other things such as watching a movie or studying.
---
Yeah, way off. Say you averaged 1 of each visage in 5k kills (which is the drop rate), you'd get about 45m for both (skeletal is at 37m according to ge tracker). With 30 kills an hour you're looking at 270k.
---
Does it scale by month purchased? 
---

Nope I wish

This is runescape related. I met her on runescape. And no I actually have sex unlike you so I would not text this to myself. 
---
I mean, slayer is probably the best way to go from combat stats in the 60s to combat stats in the 80s - 90s  
---
  
---
there's other more AFK methods, but in the long run, slayer is most common method, mostly because the slayer helm's fantasic  
---
as someone else approaching 70s in every cb stat, the only annoying thing is when you WANT to train one stat in particular, like strength, and the slayer master goes "mmm how bout I give you a monster that's only really weak to magic. how bout that." ((fuckin metal dragons I swear))
---
This would be my question because February has 28 days.
---
Sorry you le gnome kek’d :(
---
He has his way, you have yours and that's swell. Not sure why you're being hostile.

It is after you apply the curve 
---
I believe yeah , if I purchase another month it would probably add another 28 on but why is a month only 28 days . Does jagex know something I don’t?
---
318,000,000 magic xp
---
It might also have been a bond change to make everything on a 14 day table

no way you have sex?! no way... this is quite literally not runescape related. this belongs on r/cringe

I wish they would add a server for asia too much 200 ping in South Korea is no fun

Yea I was about to watch a guide. I really like the game but I don't want my retardation to hinder me playing the game lol.

Yut 
---
Amazing, pics?
---
with your kc u should be very familiar with raids, if you do some raids with other people now u should find them super smooth :) in my clan we do raids most days and also do learner raids when people want to learn. the cc is "elysium cc" and you can apply on the rs forums if you want to and also get an invite to the clan discord. hopefully we get to do some raids together :)
---
So you can pay the same amount and get less or more .but just need to pick the months you buy membs. Well i guess I’m only buying members in months with 31 days . Seems kinda weird 
---
I have actually moved to farming guild to cut redwood. Upside is to be able to monitor and finish your contracts easily. Also the deposit box is way closer. Finally I hate getting crashed at wc guild; farming guild is way more relaxing. 
---
Doubt the team would consider a buff but who knows

Thats a lot of assumptions you are making about me. I don't have a "dark and monotonous lifestyle", I just don't want cosmetic MTX. I'm all for earnable cosmetics.

I was in the basement of Draynor Manor, and there was someone stuck down in the doors room doing Ernest the Chicken.

I said “try using RuneHQ as a guide” and that bastard reported me for advertising a website.

I remember checking in to my first unit and voting to bring back 2007scape while in line at CIF. When it released my buddy and I made zerker pures and just grinded all day in the barracks. Called it the skate n scape. Damn I miss those days...

MAR 6 to APR 6 = 31 days
---
Didn't realize digsite was around before the ge. Or that wizards tower bridge had a band in it.

Its because of february, it balances out overtime.

It takes like all of 3 hours to get to 50 ranging with a poverty setup, it's really not even a significant time commitment to get to 70 with ranging or melee.

Are there any plans for more wilderness updates? would love to see some more methods to gather resources in the wilderness.
---
\-Some new fishing spots would be great, and because they are in the wilderness maybe they have some sort of extra bonus. Like a chance of catching two fish, or catching fish quicker.
---
\-Magic trees and other trees that have a chance of cutting double logs. Or an Undying tree similar to the redwood tree but it is a magic tree. And with diary completion it can be noted logs.
---
\-A farming patch in the wilderness would be really cool too.
---
\-more cool chests or other things to use thieving for as well.
---
\-Gem rocks in the wilderness that are more likely to give higher level gems.  
---
anyhing really that might involve more skilling in the wilderness, that either provides more resources or more xp or a balance of both than conventional methods in safe areas.
---
HAHAH DUDE! WEED NUMBER, LMAO!
---
No it doesn’t it equals 28 count one more time 
---
nuttin'
---
Really dude? You can’t see ANYTHING wrong with being able to teleport to an arbitrary location? This would change the meta for so many things. RC would be so much faster because you could just tele from bank to alter etc etc. Collecting any item would be 300x easier because you could now basically skip walking to the location

Lmao I always imagined him throwing it on the floor like in the first Thor 
---
Hey, I'd gladly cover you in poo.
---
So should I buy membs on months with more days ? 
---
I'm new and I've just been grinding away at levels really, I don't really know what to do in the game except for grind levels right now. Level 28 btw.
---
Thanks, hope they resolve it so you can get back on that G R I N D
---
no
---
Maybe if I compliment her on her moronic tat she'll sleep with me! ^^^/s
---
You're able to play as many accounts as you want. Obviously you'll have far more content to explore in members, you could work through a bit of Free 2 Play on your Ironman before moving over to members
---
I have like 4 of these lol
---
its almost like theres a spell for this or something.....
---
The start isn't even the bad one at Falador. At Falador at some camera orientations it is nearly impossible to click on the hitboxes of some of them - before I used Runelite I'd have to rotate the entire camera multiple times on that course because where you have to click is so unintuitive.
---
I think you should give Brando his gear back
---
#Ban3rdpartyclients 
---
lots of pures also voted against that poll and for good reason
---
Just FYI F2P is cancer. I would recommend getting members right away on an Ironman, it’ll allow you to get a fast start via questing.
---
Agility training to 15 had me dying of laughter. 
---
it happens dude, i got lucky on my first bone and then nothing as usual.
---
i banked the tokkul. The rune pouch was holding water, chaos, and death runes.
---
I'm literally the opposite. Slayer is such a chore.
---
I wonder how you got all that money
---
i used brimstone because i like how it gives stats to all bonuses. same with book of balance and the boots.
---
99 agility was my favourite 99.
---
I have said it before, I buy my money on gold sites. Not hiding that. lol.
---
Jagex Support posts weekly stats. Last week alone over 140k bots were banned. That's one bot every 4 seconds. Sure there's room to improve but maybe chill out with the sweeping generalizations and outrage culture. 
---
To be honest, I'd like to rebalance certain aspects of skilling and guilds like this but I'd imagine it would be quite controversial. Nerfing the skill guild level buffs (the woodcutting guild is already good without the buff due to the variety of trees, sawmill and proximity to a bank chest) would be a good step imo.
---
It's also very strange that mining lower level ores (iron in particular) or woodcutting lower lever trees (teaks) offer better xp rates from the level they unlock to 99 than any of the higher level trees. 
---
Please go back to rs3
---
and how is it afk 
---
Is it really a client though? If so, if anyone remembers Jacmob's comments on this, they'll realize it's against the rules.
---
(about the Orion client)
---
&gt;Notably it does not modify the applet's code and **does not perform any automated input** into the applet
---
So... yeah, self-explanatory.
---
I will once your mom finishes sucking me off.

Damn with that comment, go back to fortnite

&gt;Damn with that comment, go back to cancer

tfw slayer is your lowest stat and you only need combat/slayer to finish all elite diaries and music cape
---
sent you a pm if you can check it
---
That looks so fun? 
---
I mean they already changed the melee leveling meta with viggora's chainmace which is pretty decent xp at elder chaos druids from level 60 attack and is a very cheap weapon to buy, although with associated upkeep costs.
---
Rip hardcore
---
You can do anything on your computer while training agility. You just click every few seconds. 
---
It isn't AFK in the way splashing is, but it requires very low attention for maximum xp rates.
---
"I like it!
---
ANOTHER ONE!"
---
I love that scene.
---
Similar to how you are able to talk to Ignisia at Wintertodt to exchange extra Pyromancer Outfits for an additional Supply Crate, can we talk to Jossik at the Lighthouse to exchange duplicate God Pages for a chance at receiving a different page?    
---
To balance this out so that players cannot buy Bandos or Guthix Pages to trade them for Zamorak or Armadyl Pages as a money making method, the rolls could have the following weighting (numbers could be adjusted):  
---
\- 60% chance to be exchanged for a page un-owned of the same God Book   
---
\- 30% chance to be exchanged for a page owned of the same God Book    
---
\- 5% chance to be exchanged for any page of any God Book    
---
\- 5% chance to be destroyed  
---
Jossik could then be updated to hold on to pages that have been collected by players until the God Book has been completed.  If a player has not shown or stored that page with Jossik then it will roll as if they do not own that page.
---
This will greatly benefit Ironmen/HC Ironmen who receive duplicates, as well as the potential to vacate up to 18 bank spaces if a player has three pages of each of the God Books.
---
&gt;Around 12-14 m (thats sharks + karambwans, super restores, bastion and antivenom potions, also some minor ones like recoils for suffering, ahrim’s repair)
---
Scales? Darts and runes not included? 
---
I will once your mom finishes.
---
Use barrows teletabs mate
---
Ability is the least AFK skill in the game. Your character literally does not move unless you aren’t clicking.
---
All pkers are autistic rats. I side with OP here.
---
Wait wat
---
Yeah sorry jumped the gun on severity
---
I'll take the downvotes. 
---
**So. Fucking. Dumb.**
---
This is an option on PC too...
---
Torvesta did a barrows video with absolutely maxed gear / stats / ornate pool + barrows tabs and could do only about 1,2m/h. 
---
Of course getting karils + ahrims drop in a short period of time will boost your gp/h by far but in a longer run
---
Iban blast + 70s stats will lead you nowhere close to 800k - 1m.
---
I mean, if I was still friends with my ex, and an unfortunate thing related to them happened, I'd whine to them about it?

Could the music player in OSRS updated a bit? Few suggestions:  
---
- Problem: Clicking AUTO or MAN buttons on music player replaces the currently playing track name with "AUTO" and "MANUAL". Please remove this behavior, we can already see from the button which mode is being used  
---
- New setting: Disable jingles. E.g. Grand Exchange transaction complete, entering POH or level up. These jingles interrupt music and some of them are annoying.  
---
- New setting: Always play the entire track. What it does: Track is always played entirely, even when music player is set to AUTO and player changes area (with different area specific music track).  
---
Now get the words run and escape on each of you ass cheeks and follow up with a post. Now.
---
This is the most disgusting thing I've seen all day
---
dont worry im pretty sure 99% of players use guides
---
Regerts 
---
He’s talking about combat stats...
---
Yeah the game makes you feel like you’re wasting time if you’re not doing slayer which is pretty shit. Once I hit 99, I was really baffled and didn’t know what to do. Wish they didn’t focus 99.9% of their energy into Slayer.
---
Dude you are good, that rc lvl will help you know diaries fast and the perk they give make your life easier in the long run
---
Jamflex new mode - swamplete? 
---
Once you hit ardy course? Lmao
---
mandela
---
What does this do?
---
Whats the drop rate
---
Lol pkers will target literally anyone, even if its just a guy with a spade doing clue. 
---
If you can, do ds2 for the royal seed pod. Saved my ass more times than I can count.
---
Brought fires and natures to a bursting task
---
sick reactions bro haha!!!!!!!!!!!!! clip this!
---
It’s still millions for the furniture. Portal hub alone. Marble, gold leaf, thousand law runes per destination. 2000 for some.
---
rates are lower in tourny worlds tho u nubs
---
1/15 x 1/128

With the draw distance update runlite isbt ecen needed to do that anymore
---
Lmao none of them are retarded enough to get lip tattoos. I helped pick a tattoo for an ex last week hahaha. 
---
You sound bitter, and chronically single.
---
ok I agree OP is making dumb points, but funner absolutely should be a word and I don’t give a shit what the dictionary says alright
---
If they have something that automatically switches prayers for them, how hard would it be to make something that switches gear?
---
because you're fucking retarded?
---
Not sure if scamming people who walk around you with guns every day is the best target demographic to scam 🤔

I have 99 hp and I say guacamole nigga penis

ITT: op has brain damage 
---
When freezing/entangling someone next to a ladder or entrance/exit, why are they able to immediately cancel the freeze by using the ladder or entrance? Isn’t the point of the spell to make the player immobile for the duration of the spell? Is this a bug or did jagex intend for it to work this way?
---
so did I.
---
Not anymore
---
I have 2 in 600 kc lol. Rip
---
True, efficient ways OP
---
ok it was my first kill i figured out by my second kill. sorry everyone for the premature post
---
Hey Donie would you like to see my staff?
---
That's a stick.
---
Bummer man. At least 70 agility is in your sights then? You’ll need it for Saradomin GWD anyway :D 
---
Damn. Alright, thanks for letting me know. Hopefully its sooner rather than later.
---
I always see people complain that BA is so bad but I've only seen like 2 or 3 completely terrible BA players so far and I've reached lvl 5 in 3/4 of the roles, am I just being really lucky?
---
It's so chill
---
I can’t relate, and I feel ducking smug about it baby. Even got crafting cape to make Slayer even more efficient
---
YEET 
---
Old clan wars. No bank on site
---
Yeah check this one out: https://youtu.be/tlnPTyX1mNE
---
Ngl this is also just a very quick google search away :D have fun making some cash my guy. 2 runs a day will find a bond every 2 weeks easily!
---
Need better and more Aussie worlds aye
---
 didnt slayermusiq do an unofficial hcuim? what happened to him?
---
Yeah. Im lvl 59 agility atm. Also I need 71 agility for morytania hard diary
---
It's not just the content that people like. It's also how it's presented and how enthusiastic settled is about making it
---
Prayer is cheap nowadays if you don’t take the traditional route

did you type/download anything? i recommend doing a quick virus/keylogger check before doing anything

And 35% interest rates on a V6 automatic mustang with a salvage title...

Yeah, we’re not the brightest bunch. But we kill stuff good, so that’s why they keep us around.
---
Poh to castle wars from jewelry box is going to the fastest bank that doesn't require jewelry recharges. If you're using a glory and bandos that was already a bad idea. Bandos Chestplate is equivalent dps to fighter torso, so you could have spent the money on an amulet of torture, which would give you 4 more strength than glory+bcp or 2 more than fury+bcp for around half the price.
---
Legit same, did all the elf quests I was putting off, got a max POH now, and I've been on a mission to do all the hard diaries. 
---
Fuckin pogs.
---
Honestly, just join any pvm clan's friends chat and ask around saying you will pay, or go in we do raids discord and ask :)
---
Nah I didn’t download anything. It didn’t load I think because I had u block origins.
---
No
---
As long as you never entered your password/username you should be fine. If you're paranoid change your email password and account password.
---
Is it tomorrow yet?
---
Using a Fury, alright I’ll look into it. Cheers for the notes.
---
If your not enjoying the game, take a break and stop playing. You'll come back if you actually miss the game.
---
But as for your outlook. Your outlook is extremely Nihilistic. In the end, any achievement in the game is meaningless, yes. But these achievements do carry weight. 80 fishing may not be useful, but 82 for minnows is. Minnows give pretty decent AFK money for which to achieve other goals, or just to relax with a low effort activity. The activity of getting higher levels should bring you some happiness or you should absolutely stop playing. 
---
Take a break. Evaluate if your outlook is healthy in general. Than think of goals that you would actually enjoy doing in game and outside. A change of perspective is always healthy. 
---
He’s talking about 99 ranged not save up a few points to imbue items. I afked my 99 melees at work and after imbuing everything I have 50M points left over so yeah it is a waste of time to train range to 99 there
---
Im in DFW and online right now... No problems past couple hours
---
When can we expect the Content Poll #63 (Kebos - Post Launch Changes)  to drop.  I know me and a lot of other players are excited for the seed vault and bone buffs to be released.
---
Idk if youre really out of goals that you care about I dont know how any of us can help. Judging from your post you dont sound interested in any cosmetic or status goals so training skills, going for boss/raid KC, getting pets, finishing miscellaneous completionist activities, etc dont really seem up your alley. Its kind of hard for us fo figure out what youd be interested in. Sounds like you might just be bored with the game, idk
---
Still down for me. 😖
---
Man, military members are one of the biggest weeb/nerd community out there. You can walk into any barracks in the corps on a Friday night and find a game of DnD, MTG, and groups of people watching anime.
---
Don't think it's nearly that steep. I'm apart of an obby pure cc and when it was first released I'd say about 15 people in my cc got it within the first 10 hours. From what we heard it's 1/5k or 1/10k
---
Not op but assuming Full ancestral/void range with my method I get 30 kills an hour on average nearly 12 hours, assuming a lower level setup and 20 kills per hour, which is probably around waht most people average, 17 hours.
---
if your worried you can just change your pass/do a virus scan but you should be ok
---
Are you sure the game does't track something as small as you dying? The psychological weight you speak of is only personal to the person who owns the account.. If you are an ironman already, who never died, you still earned EVERY level and did EVERYTHING the exact same way as a hc but, when creating the acc you just never made him a hc for whatever reason. Why exactly is it against the spirit of the mode? Obviously if you never died, you would still be a hc if that was the option you choose to be at creation. Thinking realistically, most people made regulars to not have the stress burden of never dying, hence they prob died at some point. There would probably be a VERY small amount of leveled "reg-ironman" that have never died. Then you think of how many would actually make the change to become one. Is it really something that you see as against the spirit of the mode? I'm trying to follow..
---
Nuts
---
wow how rude
---
Barrows, Giant Mole, KBD.
---
Lol rip
---
That was probably me. Go ahead and file an EO complaint, bitch. I’m waiting. I’ll have you running nats for me and get the Major to sign off on it as EMI.
---
Honestly back in the day since the profanity filter was so damn ridiculous, I'd say there was significantly more hateful shit in chat.  People *wanted* to circumvent it.  We all did.
---
Also we were all 14 and just learned about how to be naughty fucks.
---
Like [this](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ActualEmbarrassedHornet-small.gif) but backwards?

The link the other guy gave is pretty good, if your interested in a text source, the OSRS wiki page for herb patches is actually very helpful it lists the requirements for all herb, and the ways to get there from best to worst.

antivirus' look for previously known viruses within programs code and look for certain signatures that common virus scripts leave behind, they're really really easy to bypass. Think of them as internet police, they can only identify known criminals, but also know what patterns to look out for.

Got stuck in draynor manor for 3-4 hours, and didn’t realize home teleport was a thing until my brother showed me lmao

SnayerScape = Normies
---
“Working on those service requests for the Mk 19, sir. GCSS is being a bitch again though.”
---
Yeah I expected those but Giant Mole is a bit shitty without the falador shield, and KBD seems like not that great profit really. You think we just need to continue training first?
---
Morytania hard if you ever plan on doing barrows. 50% extra runes adds nicely to the profits to make it a nice early game money maker
---
What's the 8th step
---
Hello, you are still welcome to join us. :)
---
Body tiaras cost ~560gp for 37.5xp, or 15gp/xp.  
---
Cosmic tiaras cost ~670gp for 40xp, or 16.8gp/xp.  
---
Chaos tiaras cost ~560gp for 42.5xp, or ~13gp/xp.  
---
Nature tiaras cost ~800gp for 45xp, or ~17.7gp/xp.  
---
Law tiaras cost ~1040gp for 47.5xp, or 21.9gp/xp.  
---
Death tiaras cost ~200gp for 50xp, or 4gp/xp (though up-front cost is ~6500gp per tiara).  
---
Simply put, they're bloody expensive to use for extensive training. They're also significantly more tedious to use for regular training. They do not benefit from rune pouches.
---
I'm just going to compare Death tiaras since they're a bit of an outlier on gp/xp. They're bloody expensive to buy (~6500gp each), and each trip will yield 50xp * 14 tiaras = 700xp a trip. At that level, you could alternatively bring 43 pure essence and craft death runes for 430xp. Buying an inventory of tiaras will set you back ~95k gp, and you can sell the tiaras for ~91k gp, or ~4k loss per inventory. Buying an inventory of pure essence will set you back 172gp, and selling the resulting death runes will yield ~10.1k profit.
---
This means leveling from 65-66 runecrafting is a difference between losing 268k or gaining 1.1m. The xp difference per trip also doesn't consider that making each tiara one at a time will be slower than making two batches of runes per trip.
---
tl;dr: It's expensive, tedious, and not nearly fast enough to be worth the downsides.
---
Zerk bracket is difficult to get into from scratch because of piety/rigour builds. 60 att zerk will definitely be fun, But you’ll get the most experience in fast pace pvp from a 75 attack 1 def it’s better to learn nhing on a 1 defence too because you get punished for missing prayers and the flow of the fight changes so quick it keeps you on your toes. Also the low risk in pvp means if you kill a zerk or piety acc who risks 500k you’d have to die 6 times after that before you’re losing gp. 
---
60 attack 45 defence would be my second choice though because you’re not too high and not too low cb and you have a very wide variety of dragon weapons with good balancing dps in all attack styles 
---
Keep it up! I had about 147k nats that I had crafted in my bank but I’ve used 30k of them for alchs so far. It’s painful to see the stack go down
---
Lmao, the salt is pure gold
---
Ha, now you're in debt!
---
Found the guy with 124 combat
---
Baby blues is good for slayer if you’re low on points, Ardy cloak gives better stab accuracy - Fire/inferno still would have been better though.
---
Safe spot kurasks for ~400k/hr and 30k range xp/hr 
---
Damn dude save some rng for us other irons :p
---
That... that's the whole point. Your voting is affected by looking at the results.
---
Another sherlock, to fix a lamp in the dorhushuun
---
Claw is probably 1/1k anyway so you’re not even that dry, pet is probably 1/2-3k so quit whining buddy.
---
Youre a retard
---
This isn't by any means an amazing money maker but I quite like mining gems in the underground portion of the Shilo Village gem mine (requires Karamja Hard Diary but I believe you have all the requirments for that). It can vary due to the RNG nature of it but you can expect between 400k and 800k/hr. Just make sure you equip a charged amulet of glory and deposit the gems in the deposit box. 
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
I know you said not hunter, but birdhouses is easy levels and takes bugger all time to do once you have set it up
---
Ibans blast, flames of zammy and smoke spells arnt effected by damage buff but yh still gives the free runes.
---
what? are you new to games or something?
---
No... no, that was definitely not the best decision of your life
---
&gt;get 94 mage

Step 1.
---
&gt;get 99 def

Step 2.

&gt;deep wildy PK in Max Gear and collect SpAdEs.

You'll be L3GI7 IN NO TIM3

its my first and only 99

This series will pick up where the previous videos on my channel left off. It's been a blast creating them so far and it's very rewarding to see all the positive reactions to the characters I've created so far. Cheers! :D
---
Aye! That means a lot, thanks man!
---
One of the main reasons why wilderness worked better back then. It was literally a bigger part of the game in terms of %. Nowadays its such a small part of the game.
---
With his tome luck pages are ez can trade tomes in for 100 pages 
---
Give it a 75% chance of getting a free herb on whatever you're harvesting. Also being skulled makes it noted.
---
ardy cloak for the stab bonus - doesn't seem very chadlike to me
---
Same, I got a stupid amount of black dragons. Got maybe 3 in before I realized they were brutals and turned around and skipped it
---
0/10 in user skills. Go get 11$ how hard is it?

What’s so interesting?

tfw all the kids who used to roll play as girls on runescape grew up &amp; now are just traps on runescape
---
The moment she stands up lmao
---
Did you find a fix for this? I’m having the same issue 
---
Is it possible this is a clue he received before the # of steps were reduced? Prior to an update, they were 9-12. IIRC clues received prior to the update had their steps reduced, but it was still possible to get 8 or 9 steps on those.
---
No Ragrets
---
Apparently the sarcasm was too subtle 
---
Detective Liambill, you got him
---
113cb 1899 total account. I just got from 67 to 82 const for that best pool and also to build that best spell swap thing. Then killed zulrah for elite void req. Now I'm finishing my left hard diarys. I only have ds2 and mm2 to do but I'm too lazy to start them.
---
You should be able to skip tut island completely.
---
would u really be that happen if you got dragon bone necklace? nobody goes to vorkath lookin for the damn uniques go camp arma if u want rare drops 
---
I love this community 
---
1. explain to me how osrs has mechanics lmao
---
I regret this on your behalf then
---
There is no words. How does one combine RuneScape with a mass slaughter of a religion 😂
---
And why can't he do it?
---
Try giving yourself an interesting challenge and record your progress. I'm not saying be a YouTuber. But a collaboration of your accomplishments is still video worthy and who knows maybe you might make a couple irl dollars.
---
Then looking back you won't feel like you wasted your time
---
I actually did, seemed to be some language barrier which was unusual 
---
Off the top of my head right now I'm pretty sure you need full prospector and elite void... will research
---
This is untrue, most next-gen anti-virus products are behaviour based to detect exploits and use machine learning techniques to know when something is harmful.
---
Hes not wrong tho. Osrs maybe one and only mechanic is pray flicking. 
---
Some high quality ball busting going on here
---
Sure, but the pet droprate is 1/5k
---
How did you make 15mil so fast tho?
---
Because it's the wilderness. You understand what that means, right?
---
The mobile bros would like to thank you for this information.
---
I was actually thinking about doing that. Creating some sort of series since I could just screen record it. I am starting to think about some good ideas. Thank you.
---
Misspelled regrets intentionally because deep inside you regret it 
---
Yeah, I pretty much only ever lose less than 100k if I die, but I've figured out that if you're in single combat (usually deep wildy where there's no other option) then you can brew your combat stats down to 0, remove your weapon, protection pray, and then x-log. I had to lose two emblems before I learned this lesson though.
---
Buy more bonds
---
Sell them on the GE
---
profit
---
86 rc?
---
I've got 45 hunter levels from birdhouse runs. You got freakishly lucky. I probably average 10 nests per run and would be lucky to get one decent seed.
---
Everything you kill these days with blowpipe. Not fucking broad bolts
---
You pushed your luck and over stayed friend. Bank sooner
---
Mudkip has a fun HCIM series imo
---
There are already popular YouTubers doing morytania, karamja, and wilderness only ironmen.
---
Personally I think a kourend only Ironman could be fun and not a tedious grind at the same time.
---
Awsome bot
---
But I don't want to spend real money on the game just yet. So I want a place I can get good money to buy bonds in-game.
---
do people still use youtube?
---
lol
---
If you're f2p then it may take a while with conventional money making methods such as giants, if you're members then getting a bond wouldn't take too long if you had decent stats. Better off just buying membership and with that membership maintaining a bond
---
I love his ability to make a 10:03 video out of 8 minutes of content.. not really
---
His videos are boring and just stretched out to make a dollar
---
This is what it sold for.

don't go into the wilderness if you don't want to get PKed.
---
I know, wild concept.
---
&gt; cba expaining anything to kiddies who respond with **hJjFhGhI** and are here to troll 
---
did you have astroke?
---
I is broke so I'm gonna have to use conventional methods.
---
Or add a world wide contract like system that allows you access to the specially cultivated trees which allow the 7+ boost. Either it be via timed woodcutting or token based (100 tokens = 100 logs).
---
Interesting. So the whole ironman series is pretty popular then.
---
What money making methods would you recommend? Blue dragons was taking too long so I went and did a bunch of quests to get 32 farming, and my first herb run lost me almost 100k. Seems like every possible methods I can look up for money either takes forever or requires a bunch of high skills.
---
Must have been Camp Horno barracks, huh?
---
it requires elite Karamja diary
---
Either this or people are.... getting smarter in their YouTube searches? Instead of finding the next PewDiePie video they’re searching “how to code with Java” 
---
Just a thought, most of us are getting older so it makes sense
---
Oh, that explains it, thanks!
---
Devalues my ultimate mental illness only ironman, SMH TOO EASYSCAPE 
---
pretty much lol, his profile pretty much sums up the type of person he is too lol
---
If you havent watch "SwampLetics ep1" on YouTube. You will not stop watching until the end. And a new video comes out tomorrow.
---
Honestly probably best osrs content on YouTube atm
---
Spiritual Creatures slayer assignments are unlocked after completing Death Plateau which doesn't make sense since you can't get into the GWD after Death Plateau. Can this be changed to partial completion of Troll Stronghold? Maybe after defeating Dad, Since thats what you need to do to get into the GWD.
---
High risk, high reward. You got a warning that it's the wilderness and you still went in, so why complain when you die?
---
My god, you are so entertaining. Keep it up! I look forward to see where this channel goes!
---
Actually building the house stuff adds a lot more though to be fair.
---
If I ever got elite, why would I actually use that shortcut?
---
Mine some more or masturbate magain? :thinking:

Imagine getting killed in battle when your comrade could have saved you because you scammed his d long right after he completed lost city
---
The entire comment is sarcastic.
---
The wilderness is a small area compared to the rest of Gielinor, it is filled with lots of high risk, high reward. If you wanted to get dragon bones for prayer you could have killed blue dragons but no you wanted to be able to do it a bit quicker so went to get lava dragon bones which is fine but there are risks involved. 
---
If there was no risk everyone would be doing it and it would be the busiest place ever. 
---
I would guess varrock medium for grand exchange tele 
---
Vorkaths unique is like 40m and 1/5k, so thats like 8k/kill so thats maybe 220k/h not 1,5-2 lmfao

When y’all gonna improve account security. Ice Poseidon account got hijacked and the hacker is selling ranks in the clan chat for bitcoin and the account hasn’t even been locked permanently lol
---
So I found out AHK isn’t legal if it isn’t 1:1, and apparently moving the mouse at all (or diagonally? idk.) means it’s not 1:1. Feels pretty bad since I thought I was playing legit this whole time. 
---
I heard WMK is completely legal and you can move the mouse diagonally? Anybody know if this is true?
---
I am probably autistic.

He also has a kid which is the sad part. I feel bad for his girlfridnd who was his high school girlfriend, then they broke up, got back together a few years later, and then they had a kid.

65,65,55 ATT,STR,DEF with 61 range here... let me just go use my blowpipe then ey?! 
---
Why wear graceful for doing wildy course? You dont lose run energy there? Its a net gain per lap, at least in my experience
---
Hilarious that rather than call for a generic message when you have you cat out when you shouldn't, there is a hard coded message there for this specific scenario. This game had to be one big if,then statement on release... 
---
Its a joke now. Sure.
---
It is crazy how people are bored of the game yet just hang out here like a chat room.
---
And then you get ancient maced for the bp and you lose next 4 hours profit, nice. Just use msb (i) with amethyst or rune arrows
---
Feel like there’s a big void grind going on right now, but that could just be because I’m doing it too. I’ve basically made every little thing a goal so now being able to raid is a goal. I’ll end up spending 25 hours doing this for 5-10 of and give up because I didn’t get a t bow. Oh well, maybe I’ll do 99 fletching after that. 
---
Thats to bad the pvm is realy great on rs3. Especialy late game.

Its afk, not that bad. Wall beasts are more annoying.

What's the non-traditional route?

What are you on about recharging the staff manually?

Zulrahs a a lot more fun imo

ok.

&gt; Not sure why you're being hostile.

Lmao what exactly did you get offended about?

Ahh, okay, good to know. I think they boosted the 10% to 20% though.

Well probally do alot of slayer i guess, and if its too hard ill just not include those

Is there such thing as transfer of RS2 Acc. To 0srs cause ik its that popular now and everyone who played rs3 is past max if they continued if they did make swaps between the accs ud know itd be real enough. Poll votes? None of my accs from Rs2 r banned. all my osrs accs are banned

There's a few jewerly items like the amulet of glory, games necklace, skills necklace and ring of dueling that have teleports to places around the map. Use these as well as teletabs that you can buy from the G.E

I'd like to thank you for your reply
---
&gt; it's more likely than not that changes indirectly affect a huge amount more people than are directly engaging with content. I'm still affected by some PK'ing updates, despite rarely actively wanting to take part because of content in the wilderness, and skilling resource prices are constantly affected by PvM drop tables on new content.
---
You are absolutely correct that updates can indirectly affect a huge number of people and that the game as a whole is connected.
---
You said it yourself, you rarely want to partake in wilderness related content, yet you still wish to preserve the power of control (voting) over it. That is quite selfish imo.
---
My point is, I'd much prefer that the disinterested/inactive majority be minimally inconvenienced rather than the participating/active minority being completely overshadowed and shut out of updates to what they love doing, by the selfish opinions of the majority.
---
"Uninformed spite-votes are an unavoidable problem". I respectfully disagree.
---
They are easily avoidable by separating polls into categories. 
---
"I definitely do not think the solution is to make those with vested interests have the only opinions that matter, that's certainly not good for game integrity."
---
I wholeheartedly agree with that. Sadly, that's exactly what's plaguing our polling system at this very moment. Everyone votes regarding their current self interest not for the long term benefit of the game. This is why almost every single pvming update has passed with flying colors (85%+), while pvp updates get completely trashed, simply because pvmers are in the majority.
---
The sad reality is that it's completely up to the Jmod's to preserve the game's integrity, since players only vote for their selfish best interests.
---
Lmao who is that cute noob with granite body and d legs?
---
My slayer is like 40-45 and I did a fire giant task and other than a rune med helm and a couple of scimmys the best stuff I got was an occasional rare herb, runes or rune arrows etc 
---
Worst. Yikes.
---
if only rottards learnt some basic math
---
Im placing my bet on there being graardors BDSM dungeon
---
Personally - I like it. You use Konar, you get the positives and the negatives. Why should a new slayer master be the meta 100% of the time? 
---
Use Steve for easier tasks, Duradel for XP/Boss's and Konar for variety. 
---
Yeah i mean some people come off work to rs and hangout casually talk to people flex to each others... I mean if i didn't have any friends or anyone to talk to i would be in same situation.

Yeh nah that guy in black wizzy G has more swag than you
---
Im not sure if they had australian servers back then
---
Yeah that exists
---
Like 70 kills/hr with max gear is my point
---
Go hcim, so that whenever you walk around and see someone who is not in the T1 A squad with you, you can just give them a swift "btw" and walk off.

nah but fr I got bored shitless of my main, made 2 ironmen and never even logged back onto it since.

yeah i feel that.

I respect your opinion that runelite does too much, but this is different. Runelite doesn't click for you. What we see here is bot like. The client reacts to something happening, runelite just shows you what is happening.
---
Someone get me whatever this guy is smoking
---
I had ahrims with tormented, dhide with anguish and suffering with an imbued heart at the very end, could've gotten more kills/hour but was pretty tired
---
lmao imagine being this stupid. Hope it was worth the upvotes
---
Going to the well instead of paying the mage
---
No, my friend was doing his farm run a while after me and I asked him to check if he was still there
---
You obviously know why, you're just choosing to be ignorant.
---
Getting the full graceful set is the only reason my agility is that high. Lol. 
---
I have no idea how many hours. I wish I could say they were all efficient hours but that would be a lie. Haha. 
---
Can we have the option to remove the bond icon next to minimap on mobile, maybe make it members only option but it is extremely annoying when trying to click at the furthest point and end up openong the shop. Thanks
---
Jagex should allow 1-3 third party clients, monitor them, and ban the rest.
---
There are still clients out there that tell you what tiles to stand on and what to pray against zulrah, clients that tell you a shaman is going to use acid attack before you can even see it, etc.
---
that's why my scales are stuck at 65536

What if it looks for your animation ID to determin what to pray, your spam clicking won't do jack then.

guthix is easilly the best god

was the best god
---
For some reason I feel like you enjoy runecraft
---
I'm mostly training Ranged, I even use it on Iron/Steel dragons - I mean it takes ages but you just have to bring extended antifire (+rng potion) and that's all, nice super-afk task :D
---
this was great, good job. I didnt know about that kill credit manipulation trick, going to have to use that myself I think.
---
Do we even need them?
---
Isn't range still the highest dps with blowpipe?
---
Like range is so op they nerfed void (right after I finished my void pker btw) 
---
Yeah the reflections are what makes me believe it’s not, BUT! nowadays it’s hard to tell from a good shop
---
Ah thanks for the explanation mate, I played back in the day in middle school and recently got back into osrs as a nostalgia kick.

Mobile barely uses any data though.

Yeah if you link your Twitch account with your amazon one you get Twitch prime which then you can link to your RS account and claim 2 weeks membership. [Under the Valentine pack](https://www.twitch.tv/prime)

You could try your luck at barrows
---
You are going to run into a brick wall here, no one wants to use Runelite, but the base client hardly works and hasn't had any work done on it since release. People would joyfully use base if it had even a 1/3 of the functions runelite does but you can't even have item text show up for drops...
---
Aw it's adorable
---
I love that you managed to throw this in there

*The Zezima*... Dude your literally a real life super hero to me. You were such a legend when I was growing up, I vividly remember the one time I caught you turning private chat to “Public” and the ecstasy I felt the one time I saw “Zezima is online” appear on my screen. I was maybe 9 years old then but holy shit that was probably the coolest thing that happened to me that whole week. 
---
In the future unless you need graceful, swap the pieces for boots of lightness/spottier cape. And bring summer pies to heal with.  You’ll get run energy from summer pies, agility levels, and you can out heal some pkers attacks.

Out of the 10 tasks I've done on my alt so far, I've died once (to rev pkers on a greater demon task) and lost like 50k worth of cannonballs. When I returned to my cannon literally 300k worth of loot (cash, brews, house tabs etc.) was just lying on the ground 10 tiles away from it. I picked it up while a clan was PKing on the other side of the rev shortcut and teled out.
---
On my ironman, I did 50+ wildy tasks and I don't think I even died once. I didn't use a cannon and never went to the rev caves though.
---
I died at the Zuhair draws them thick line

How much do they cost ? I have almost 400 gold. 
---
Whoever deals the most damage gets the drop
---
I'm 230 kills with 4 shards, a dragon spear, several javelin drops and 3 rune swords. Also 81 barrows no items. I have the best bad luck. :(
---
Honestly, i think everyone gets excited to play together when they first hear about each other playing rs. Then get frustrated when it is not the same version and just start flaming/trolling. Most of it is in good sport though.
---
I use portals all the time, the only downside is the long run and that the portal rooms only got one door, to be able to remove them all and only use nexus is going to be so nice, im a UIM so i only carry home tele runes on me anyway

That is jenson luck? No pet and lotsa dragon drops

Thanks for your highly valued input, marinarasauce69.

Prices for them vary, but the amulet of glory has 6 teleports when bought for around 14k and then can be sold back for 13k
---
The difference of 2 prayer bonus is about 2 seconds of prayer extra every minute. This means nothing in PvP. I think you're the one who doesn't get it bud. 
---
Voted against it because it saves prayer while chinning bc of prayer bonus. 
---
Voted against it because the PvP community (from what I see) genuinely aren’t deserving of anything.
---
Imagine treating people with the slightest bit of respect and having good fortune returned further down the line.

Skull on harvest as well and it'd be perfectly dangerous.

What was the reasoning behind the Barbarian Assault ‘free magic xp’ hotfix so quickly?  No data was collected and evaluated before the hotfix.  On the other hand, before NMZ splashing was fixed in 2015, data was collected and evaluated for 6 months.  In this instance, it was just a quick decision based off of one YouTube video.

I told a girl at church group that they release the game on Mobile

Made her nostalgic, and then I banged her

Lmao hence why u look back. Ok mate.. Ok

Joke easy or nah?
---
The base client works perfectly fine. You just think it doesn't because you're accustomed to all the benefits that the third party clients offer. The base client is how the game was intended to be, but people constantly bitch for ezscape in the form of endless "QoL".
---
Plenty of us play on the base client with no issues whatsoever.
---
Nudes?
---
Swampletics.
---
&gt; no benefit from the open source nature
---
I mean there is still the factor of random people chiming in with fixing issues and creating pull requests for new features. Had it not been opensource, I doubt it would've been developing as quickly as it was
---
Didnt he do this shit before? Name sounds familiar

As long as he's not recognisable I think it's fine.

Child abuse is never a joke

Lol he is a new player at level 90. He probably is a long ways away from completing MM2 let alone killing demonic gorillas even remotely efficiently.
---
Why is Canafis on the front and back?
---
Whip or tentacle is perfectly fine. A bludgeon isn't bad either if you want easier switches.
---
Margins are fucked right now, or you're looking at bad info. Just do a flip test. Buy max, then sell lowest you can. Whatever that low number is, that's what you buy it for.  
---
There is absolutely no way the current margin on a Ring of Wealth is 1800 gp. 
---
If it is, you better go RIGHT NOW, and start running some rings to the fountain of rune, because you'll make 400k per inventory.
---
Canifis on the front and back 🤔
---
Where did you buy it, I want one
---
Does it have mory/canifis on both sides? It’s on the back in OP’s pic and the front in this pic.

That would make sense its just not how it works. Have speced, been speced, 23-25 x2 or 24 23, etc many many times while camping melee prayer. It seems like the melee prayer is applying to the maximum total damage that would be 100% then when the game checks to see its 75%, sees its already 60% and doesnt apply the prayer. 
---
How much of that farm xp was before tangleroot release?
---
You should start a blog
---
Diaries are my fav content. I'm working on my last 2 elites! I need 1 more thieving level for desert, and to finish barb assault lvl 5 all roles. I did do 99 slayer before finishing elite diaries, though.
---
Step 1: click on allotment patch
---
Step 2: click on compost bin

Could Jagex possibly intergtate a client check for dmm world, that only allows vanilla client? 
---
You don’t have to be efficient to get a zenyte

Jokes aside, that’s what makes me hopeful seeing these posts, showing that osrs pride. Honestly it’s just a game like any others, and there was a lot of stigma around it growing up, but a lot of us are adults now and no longer give a shit. Sometimes you just gotta swallow your pride, if you’re passionate, who cares if it’s lame? You think Mod Ash is embarrassed to work on Runescape? Absolutely not. 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Eventually you need to fight swampletics in deep wildy.
---
So are these sort of autoswitches not caught by the botting detection or what? How are they bypassing that sort of detection when they aren't actually clicking the prayers? 
---
thats a good fucking comment right there

I thought it might be a way to make compost potions more relevant again

Looks like a general expression of contempt.

&gt; Like, if I have a medium clue scroll and it would have dropped a medium clue would I get a different tier, or would it drop nothing?
---
You would get nothing. 
---
It's the same way with monster drops as well.
---
It wouldn't make sense to re-roll for a different tier, because then you could force the rarer elite clue scrolls. 
---
What an absolute chad.

Several default plugins either toe the line or simply disregard the most recent rules Jagex laid out. And you can just make custom plugins that you can freely abuse because Jagex is unable to detect all but a few behaviors.

If only mobile came out when I was in... had it for like a month before eas. Would be fake changing in the field.

Could Jagex whitelist certain clients by giving them a special secret key that they require on the server side? Not exactly sure what the process is for creating a custom client

i love Drumpf memes, i hope he gets impeached soon 
---
But gorillas have probably the best drop rate for an item worth over 10m (ignoring the fact I’m 1K dry :/ ) at 1/300. I’m not suggesting killing steel drags for a chance at a visage.
---
Of course no one just gets to gorillas. You gotta grind for it. 
---
Gorillas is also a great way to practice in general. With gear and prayer switches.
---
It was slightly different from the one above, as when I went to trade them, they used an animation delay with a book to push me out of the safe zone. I knew about the book delay lure but I forgot to check if they were reading it
---
Well getting portal nexus and altar is a big chunch of the cost that can get out of control and be close to 30m or more added on. It took me 22m doing oak larders and dungeon doors and I spent 4m(or less) getting the house items I needed. In my opinion occult altar is 12m+ and not necessary unless you have the extra cash. I do not switch mage books that often so I just got what I needed in house like the jewelry box and fountain were most important.

Didnt play during 2007, also Im a retard

False, Mod Ash is capable of that.

Eventually, if jagex thinks its a good thing, they will just shove it in anyways like they did with the rev caves drops that kept failing so it doesnt rly matter who votes for what xD

Hold up. I thought AHK was allowed as long as it was 1:1 ratio. I use it to rebind the F buttons because my keyboard doesn’t have F keys. ???

It's not the worst, but talking it up as the best is kinda the meme around here.

I know that I wont make the same mistake again, but it just sucks that when I did make that mistake I lost 1.5b

Just got my first Fire Cape too the other day. Congrats brother!

it's 50/50 only if you are rottard

Im a retard btw

It's crazy because in ironman mode he is not allowed to trade with other players. He can only pick up items dropping my monster that he has killed. He can't even go in the wilderness. It is restricted because of the dented head xerics robe pkers!

Except you can read.

I thought about it but I wasn't prepared enough for high effort meme.

Did the poll to sell them for 100 pearls never pass?

we also didn’t get voted yes for +1 str(addy gloves)  or mounting a head in a poh (it gives 200 def xp)

it’s a lost cause

Thank you! I was iffy about using 3rd party software, so glad it's part of the base game.

Yeah I know. I personally either buy pineapples, use watermelons i've grown or make regular compost with weeds/tomatoes/sweetcorn/cabbage i have banked and turn it into super with a compost potion.

I lost my 340m cashstack by accidentally clicking the bouncy mushroom on a 10hp skiller. It onehit me when I landed and I had no way to reach my items because the swamp monster would kill me.

Should I have been doing ecto warships?

As someone who did the diary exclusively for barrows, that looked like a throwaway reward.

if that was the case, i dont know if it should be praised or just ignored as stupidity :D

You need to post the source of this hoodie.  I'd never wear it, but would immediately be friends with anybody I see wearing it.

Its easier to obtain 20 mill for a maul then get 80 dungeoneering back in the day.

You could usually guess by the fact that they're naked. But I mean you probably heard of a guy who heard of a guy who killed a guy carrying millions of coins into the wildy and was naked, right?

Buy ahrims, and anguish, and a tormented bracelet. That should be about 35m and they will be your largest upgrades. Imbued heart would be better than bracelet, but I think it would put you out of your price range.

why not just make all armour need no defence, all weapons need no attack or strength.

Yes wild alter is better, just do one inventory at a time and you’ll be good

Meet herbletics, my one herb patch only ultimate ironman.
---
It's not south west tho. It's directly one tile diagonally northwest. 
---
How is slayer even that interesting? Only thing it does is drive profits with the slay rings being the only good unlock
---
I think if you cb level is on the lower side and you’re a patient person you can use the wildy altar ez pz.
---
Otherwise just bite the high cost bullet and use a gilded altar tbh 
---
I don't think this is an unpopular opinion, but I do think it would be an unnecessary addition at this point. 
---
Additionally, there were certain design aspects that I really did not like. The meta was to rush dungeons as fast as possible, grinding up from low dungeons all the way to occult. I think it would have been way cooler if there was an incentive to actually *use* all the resources in a dungeon to create your loadout, rather than just racing to the end. I also think it would have been better design to balance the skill around players grinding a few difficult dungeons rather than grinding out so many before each reset.
---
IMO ideal dung would have meant that upgrading armor and weapons would be difficult and rare, allowing you to keep whatever you wanted from previous floors. Instead of just taking your primal weapon and hexhunter, you'd be able to see your progression slowly grow over time. Just my two cents.
---
Did you see the flavor as Redberry or Dwellberry?

Gratz man! One of my favorite pets and would like to get it as well. Going to passively work at it though. Only at like 130kc or so

I love you :)

I love you both
---
I’ve pked multiple people that bring 1m+ in scrolls with them... I just don’t get why people think that if they’re doing a clue they shouldn’t be attacked. From a pkers perspective, it requires minimal effort to kill someone doing a clue and you have a chance of making easy money...why not?
---
Well when I saw the drop notification it took me a good 10s to find it since a I was a few tiles away, not zoomed in and low light level on my cellphone
---
Umm, it's south west not north west
---
Look at the compass diagonal from there would be in a south west direction. And sorry I was off on tile count couldn't tell exactly

Ay! I’m also friends with Dewany lol, was he going for magic cape imbued?

The spade is only used for clues though....not glory running....or slayer....

I kind of miss daemonheim in particular. I always wanted to level up high enough to reach the bottom. I was like 91 when RS3 came out.
---
Yeah I think Jagex needs to just ban them all out right, get everyone back on the official client 
---
Maul is not nearly as useful as chaotic was. It's cheap because it really doesn't have many areas where it is better than other weapons.
---
And it's very debatable to say it's easier to get 20mil than 80 dung when it first came out.
---
84 Combat, so middle-ish. I guess it is worth a try...?

wow 11%, savage

I guess this would be 2,7m at least with 3 cannonballs per kill. Prob more.

Link one. From my experience, the rude replies to nooby players is norm at the bottom of the thread, filled with downvotes. In the case that it isn't at the bottom, filled with downvotes, it was most likely something that could have easily been googled or search via the wiki.

That hoodie is essentially telling everyone "I'm a virgin".
---
&gt; RuneLite being almost-fully open source makes this kind of abuse inevitable. 
---
RuneLite may have helped it happen sooner on a wider scale, but the fact that it is possible at all is what makes it inevitable. There have been other clients specifically built to gain an advantage/cheat in PvP for a long time. A lot of people get an edge in PvP just by using AHK. A significant edge.
---
Without the detection/banning of people using these kinds of cheats, it was always going to become an issue at some stage.
---
who?
---
fishing on an iron is just cook+eat fly fishing until barb fishing, and then barb fishing to like 90+
---
the rest is just a combination of afk karams/anglers and barb to 99
---
like the first shortcut in the relleka slayer cave. it requires mid 80's or something agility to pass through it, to go from low level slayer monsters to more low level slayer monsters.
---
I would have had no issue with dungeoneering in RS3 if:
---
a) It hadn't been a skill, only a minigame
---
b) The rewards weren't so much better than anything else available.
---
I wouldn't even be opposed to them bringing in some dungeoneering type minigame as long as it doesn't give BIS gear.
---
I guess the issue is now raids are slightly similar to some dungeoneering so I can't imagine that there would be much support for it unless the rewards were incredible.
---
Instead of focusing on skills, focus on quests. RfD will get you barrows gloves and a solid total level.

lol did you repost this for more karma

Smh. How do you even call yourself a Runescaper.

just really shitty luck bro. try again with the bucket it should be fine again, and dont forget to use the bucket on the patch. sometimes it just slips your mind.

No. Devalues my wilderness only hardcore spademan.

Air orbs, only req is the mage level. pretty close to bank in edgeville, you can tele back to edge with a glory. rinse and repeat

Elite void is more DPS than ahrims before tormented bracelet I believe. I saw your other comment so you could use void as it's easy switches.
---
The other recommendations I'd go with though, suffering etc
---
Is there a combat level where you start getting good drops from your slayer tasks? I've gotten to level 37 in slayer, but am still a 58 combat level. I get all my tasks from vannaka, the highest level master I can go to, and none of the monsters seem to ever drop anything good like people are always talking about for slayer. I've only done 9 tasks so far (recently got members, but the first few boosted my slayer level significantly), so I don't have that many points if that is a thing I need to get them. Should I be seeing another master though? Or should I just keep grinding away and wait for higher levels to see those good drops?
---
You are right. But just because something has "the best drop rate for an item worth over 10m" that doesn't suddenly make it the best money maker.
---
It's called opportunity cost. Just because something "on paper" is a great money maker, doesn't make it worthwhile if you don't have the proper gear and stats to do it even mildly efficiently.
---
Your time is likely better spent doing something that "on paper" is a worse money maker, as long as you can do it efficiently. Because at that point it is actually a better money maker than 
---
Vorkath is 4m/hr if you have 99 range, salve (ei), prims, archers ring(i), elite void, dhcb, and DFW. Nobody would ever suggest a new player to start killing vorkath with black d'hide, rcb, and an anti-dragon shield. However there is always the chance that you could get lucky even in worse gear.
---
Im not arguing your statement. Yes, OP is 1 zenyte aways from doubling his bank. I also agree, you don't have to be efficient for a PvM drop. But you do have to be somewhat efficient to make killing a boss worth it for their unique drop. Otherwise your time would be better of spent doing something else.
---
Either way this is all moot for OP. He is likely 100+ hours from even getting the opportunity to kill demonics, let alone efficiently. He could triple his bank in that amount of time by just doing the best moneymaker he can at his level.
---
I could give it a bond and just do waterfall quest save mad time.
---
Judging by the back of your head you don't look like a Ramon
---
Me (Hard)
---
true, though you would get some magic and combat xp on the side but it's slower and more click intensive.
---
At least when it comes out Boaty and Sick Nerd can have a real difficult competition 
---
What i liked most about dungeoneering, is that is was 1 of the few skills where being more skilled in an activity greatly increased xp/h. And thats also what made the skill fun for me. I got maxed just to be more efficient in dungeoneering. 
---
I think you do yes
---
Ok so do you think they are OP or not? You put them in sarcastic quotes before
---
It's more satirizing the sub than milking karma.
---
It's basically the same as the meme where the guy looks left and right, says whatever the meme is, then gets crushed by 23k up votes or whatever.
---
Just imagine all that rc xp.
---
I fly fish here so I can bank the fish and get cooking exp/food. at least till I hit 65/65 for karams and mess hall
---
Combat level itself has absolutely no bearing on drops, the monsters you kill do.  Slayer monsters start having very good drops at higher *slayer* levels.
---
I guess you just spam click the zammy wine until you die and then just tele back with a burning amulet?
---
I’m lvl 100 combat with 42 quest points and no barrow gloves LUL
---
Any idea how? Is this the library one?
---
Pures had access to addy gloves in pre-eoc. So the proposal wasn’t anything new or ground breaking in terms of the history of RS as a whole. 
---
You don't really start getting any decent money from slayer until around level 70-75 slayer. You could move to konar when you get a high enough combat level for a bit of extra money.
---
Wow, this is all it takes to make front page huh?
---
I drive a Chevrolet movie thea-8-ter

Say what you want, the mans been great for the US economy

But the thing is, 400m in gear and no ardy cloak 2, which gives 4 stab bonus and is the biggest percentage increase for the cloaks. 
---
Yep it’s fast af when you do it like that. I did 60-70 on a gilded altar and that took about 1.5 hours. You can probably do 45-60 in like 40 mins or something

---
You're not fooling me, RS3
---
I agree with doing quests but if you really want to focus on skills try getting agility higher, even 30 agility is good! The difference you have between level 1 and 30 in energy regen is insane. Once you're higher level you can start doing some slayer. Farming is also fun if you like making a bit of profit but its best to do a few quests to skip the early levels and to look up a guide
---
Not until you get zamorak's.
---
I love his swampletics stuff, but I hate his guides.
---
Fletching as well. Stringing magic longs is ~215k xp/hr (230k max efficiency) as well as being profitable 
---
Might only cost half the price as well. I guess I will have to give it a go!
---
Why not contribute something remotely coherent rather than being a mouth-breathing hick? 
---
Yeah, this is a valid argument for pures getting +1 prayer. It's really refreshing to see such a logical point made!
---
I'm afraid so yes, RuneLite has a plugin to make it a lot easier but it's up to you whether you want to use it or not.

Don't fret, the IG is in route.

And maybe some way to buy exp with money?

Because he's a lv13 skeleton who drank a str pot
---
&gt; a) It hadn't been a skill, only a minigame
---
Whilst everyone said from the beginning that it was more of a minigame than a skill, I don't actually think it was bad that they put it there as a skill. It didn't really hurt anything imo.

Can we get ranged exp when disturbing the kraken boss whirlpools - it's Currently nulled damage 
---
I don't really think its unpopular. I think a lot of people liked dungeoneering. Its just that it was "on the path to EOC" which is why people wouldn't ever want it in this game as it was.

Disagree if you have mm2 done use nieve or duradel for demonic gorillas. They’re like 2m an hour which far surpasses anything from konar. You really only need 75 combats and 75 range with arclight and blowpipe.

They were the first tier 80 melee weapons that we have seen then, ofcourse they were stronger then everything else in the game.

What we have today is nothing compared to chaotics, and they are slapped on level 70 and 75 hell a level 75 fucking blowpipe out damages almost everything we currently have in the game

I’ve written this comment elsewhere so I’m gonna copy paste:
---
“Try the 6 Jad challenge on unrestricted worlds. It may be frustrating at first but literally don’t even attack any Jad. Just keep trying to get the right prayer flicks. It doesn’t even feel like runescape, it feels like some mobile game because you’re just clicking two buttons, mage pray or range pray. Once you’re comfortable with that and can last like 2+ minutes, try attacking Jad and dealing with healers. Single Jad should be a breeze for you afterwards.
---
This is such a nice opportunity given by Jagex, you literally don’t do any waves, it’s free Jad experience”
---
To reiterate, there are only two buttons: mage pray and range pray. You don’t need to do any waves, you jump straight into 6 Jads. It’ll be frustrating at first, but once you can survive for like a minute, you’ll have no problem at single Jad
---
Disappointed for lack of a YEET.
---
As a returning player looking to actually become serious about osrs, can we discuss the Quest Log?
---
I had no idea so many interesting quests existed because quite frankly they are very overwhelming as just a giant block of red text that you are unsure you’re able to complete. 
---
A good community member pointed me to the new (and quite impressive) OSRS dedicated wiki made BY JAGEX. 
---
The quest log there was so neat, so informative that I actually felt like questing in which I’ve never done before and I’ve played this game since classic. 
---
I strongly feel that there should be easy to read in game information regarding quests. We shouldn’t need Swiftkit, Runelite, OSBuddy, or even the wiki to get started on what quests are possible or not.
---
The game needs some direction and new players benefit from this too as insurance for player retention as OSRS grows for years to come. 
---
Because in the perspective of the other person, you are just griefing and waisting time for him and that is not fun at all. 
---
just makes you want to survive because you still need that juicy t bow drop
---
good one
---
Oh shit I dropped my Visafe there!
---
Record yourself perfectly switching gear/prayers/spells, at the same time, tick perfect, and I’ll retract everything I said. 
---
Oh, I didn't know you could manually recharge it.

Unrestricted worlds help to get some practice, alter your skills and inven accordingly, and you can get some free practice in. Helped me my get my first fire cape

praying mage 24/7 past round 31 is hard

it is just expensive but it is a great achievement if f2p comunity, you should be more impressed with F2P UIM who does smithing

What does this have to do with runescape?
---
Lol pkers would pk clue hunter even if they knew what the other person has
---
jad phase usually comes at ~2 minutes if i remember correctly so if youre killing it slowly it may appear to come sooner than the guides may say. jad phase always comes at the same time depending on the rotations, so once you've got the rotations down you'll know when he's coming up
---
you might be mixing it up with the mage phase? that ranges too, but it's random
---
Ahhh, my tax dollars at work
---
Hooooly shit people it was a joke, how do (currently) 87 people get it and some of you don't. It isn't an insult and the original person who commented it even responded and was cool.

I loved dungeoneering, I think it would be a cool addition to OSRS as long as they didn't lock a ton of BiS items behind it.

he does pick up everything lol

Also fletching and cooking
---
If you want to be efficient wait until 99 hp for cape + regen Bracelet for plunder
---
Thats the price people are paying for them.
---
Getting shot hurts less than training rcing 
---
Yeah but not everyone wants to or can do max level bossing content, or has a clan.
---
Yes that’s plenty. Use an upgraded ibans staff. Mage all brothers except ahrim (use msb with rune arrows). Bring tank gear and prayer (magic accuracy doesn’t matter, only mage items you need are damage boosting like an occult necklace). Bring a melee switch to kill monsters in the tunnel, shoot for 88%. Work towards morty hard diary for double runes. You can probably tank all brothers (without prayer) except dharok, ahrim and kharil. Inventory otherwise should be food and prayer pots. There’s plenty of guides on YouTube.

someone knows something u dont

Yes I saw him while I was doing the wildy tasks when some pkers showed up. I tried to stall a pker in single for him to get away. I don't know if he made it out.

Barrows is pretty hit or miss for cash.  A lot of people will recommend just doing slayer or something until your combat stats are higher, then trying to move on to solo bosses like Vorkath for money.  
---
If you absolutely wanted to Barrows, you definitely could at your level.  Best bet is probably to complete Underground Pass and upgrade an Iban's Staff and use that spell to do barrows.  It has a base max hit of 25 and that increases to 27 if you use an occult necklace.  
---
You can just mage everyone and use range on Ahrim.  I'd wear proselyte, nezzy, occult, and the rest in defense/tank gear.  You don't need to bring range gear for a switch, just equipping a crossbow will give you more than enough ranged accuracy. 
---
However, you may end up using more in supplies than you make back on some runs.  This will all be offset once you get a good drop (upto 2m for 1 piece), but that means if you don't stick it out until then, you may lose a little money, and it will generally give you a very inconsistent gp/hr.  
---
If you complete the Morytania hard diary, you get 50% increased runes from barrows chest, which will make it a lot easier to profit from, but also has some fairly steep skill requirements.
---
All in all, I'd recommend just doing Konar slayer for money and gradually working on your mage and range to eventually start bossing.  
---
This is outrageous, this is unfair!
---
Ah right I did not know that the mage phase also ranged, thanks man
---
Damn so I’m getting Wildy Pk’d by 9 year-olds when I’m doing a clue

20 days with no reddit activity, very abnormal for him, most likely dead.

I always read it, i think the writing is funny

you are mistaking ordinary mage form for jad phase, ordinary mage form also has random range attacks

Could we ever see a competition with players making musical tracks that could be featured in the game? There's lots of talented musicians that cover and remix tracks already made, I'm sure lots would love the chance to design their own in-game music.
---
So I just use range and mage void, and my switches are the head, weapons obviously,  anguish with fury? and tormented with void gloves?
---
*wooosh*
---
Remove Ancient Mace, or revert the BGS change.

---
Thieving? Are you being cereal right now? 
---
_iterally unplayable
---
Yeah man just found that out, ty for your help
---
Elite void is good budget gear, tent whip/lance + bp + toxic trident are musts. 
---
he can go play another game then 
---
Because they don't want to wait hours to buy something
---
Yeah true, but it's still evidence toward the idea that you can't purely look at level reqs to judge strength
---
When you accomplish something difficult, you get a big sense of achievement.
---
I wanna know too
---
You brainlets do realize that every time you vote no against pking updates you're just making people want to kill you more right? Before people killed you because you might have had loot now they kill clue hunters because of shit like this.  You clue hunters are fostering a us vs them mentality and actually giving people reason to kill you all while complaining about being killed. If you vote yes for PVP updates there will be actual pkers for pkers to fight and they wouldn't be bored running around where they find clue hunters. 
---
Parenthesis = singular
---
Parentheses = plural
---
You goddamn idiot
---
Exactly. Whip should be 75. We can't just look at tiers to determine strength
---
why would changing the level req for blowpipe stop new items needing to be better? id be with you if you were suggesting a bp nerf but changing the req makes literally no difference, it just stops people levels 75-79 using it (which is a small small % of the people using bp)
---
My gf when I was in high school got a tattoo and she was 15 or 16 at the time.

Downvoted.

The unrestricted worlds. But I recommend just keep doing slayer and do farm runs inbetween

Shit

Looks extremely mediocre since it's just plain text, likely has little to no meaning, showing it to anyone is going to look dumb as shit.

There's literally 0 point

It's a more annoying variant of drawing a black line with permanent marker on your buttcheek

Lmao you’re dumb.  
---
This sub just shits gold
---
Let’s just call it “that place no one wants to be that only exists to make quests longer and harder”
---
I dont think it was any of the above
---
Hey nice vid and you clearly have knowledge of the game.
---
Only thing I can point out is your voice. Nothing wrong with it per say but it sounds like your reading straight from a script. Not saying you should go with the over excited horseshit type attitude that is seen everywhere on youtube but just a little bit of variety in your speech really goes a long way.
---
Check my stats mate
---
Theres a minigame in the varrock museum basement that gets you level 10 hunter.  Getting some of the shitty early levels out of the way.
---
Im assuming you've done mm1 and already have spirit trees and gnome gliders, id do fairy tale part 1/2 for mushroom rings.
---
The opposing side only needs 26% of the poll? You act like that's hard to do.
---
But PvM Scum will make PvP Scum mad, and vise versa in a infinite corrundrum. 
---
This will happen whenever the new skill gets polled, PvP Scum will vote no, dominate at least 26%, and GG, No Re.
---
I've went to his channel 50 times today. I need it
---
I can't even do those activities. Those apply only to max level players and alienates most of the base.
---
I can eat, I still fuck up often tho cuz I’m not a piece of software 
---
Could just send a ‘lol’ or ‘git gud’ And it would have basically the same effect.
---
Can Wyrm Bones not be on the top of the loot pile ?
---
Time for you to share where you got that sweatshirt
---
its your opinion that reqs should = power but its not how level reqs have worked on this game since the beginning, seen as theres several metrics that could be used to determine what the req is. 
---
for example rune scim &gt;&gt;&gt; rune longsword, yet theyre the same req. should that be changed because rune scim is much better? imo no, i just think level reqs are fairly arbitrary. changing the req would make no difference to powercreep and makes no difference to how good a weapon is (but nerfs would)
---
Welcome home

i havent played in over 10 years.

id wear the fuck out of that jacket.

https://rsbuddy.com/exchange this page will give you actively traded prices, rather than ge averages.
---
Well I wanted the cat training medal so the options were either troll splashers while killing rats or just kill rats. The first option was slightly more entertaining.
---
You also have to figure out that they are ueing a script in the first place. If i were fighting someone and he hit every prayer switch perfectly, I'd assume he was just good at reacting to or predicting my attack styles, at least for a minute at which point I'd start to get suspicious.
---
people keep calling pre-eoc RS2 content "RS3 content", like wtf is wrong with you..
---
His main point is null. Jagex can't do shit without banning EVERY client. Anyone can get download unfair plugins and compile them to RL. 
---
I demand proof
---
Yes, just go to the source code and check out the project on the commit before the version that removed the feature you want. Then compile the project into a JAR and run it whenever you need said feature. The self-compiled JAR won't auto-update AFAIK, so if you keep it side-by-side with an up-to-date version from the live code, then the latter will continuously update with new plugins/features while the former will stay stagnant (possibly with any bugs that existed at that time).
---
Damn Jarheads
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 208 QP too...I just like the 2005 look man leave me alone

The unimpressed look next to you; it was because you were runecrafting, wasn't it?

Honestly I don't know why I waited so long. I created an account just to post this.
---
Slaying giant rats on tutorial island brought tears to my eyes. It's so powerful.
---
Especially the spade sounds yummy
---
Yeah, I know that. I'm just having trouble following which one you hate, the chaotics or what we have now. Or it you just don't like any of them.
---
Without counting the costs, you will get approximately 400k/hr, doing mithril bar gets more money.
---
Could the droptable of the dwarven gangsters in the dwarven mines be updated? Currently they drop nothing but bones even though they are the strongest enemy in the dungeon. I would imagine something similar to the regular dwarf drop table except slightly better e.g. steel bars, rare chance at mithril and adamant pickaxes, easy or medium clue scrolls, gem drop table access, various criminal themed items and equipment. 
---
Seems a shame to have such an interesting enemy with zero drops 
---
Some shitty guides mate
---
Together they make one singular pair? Check and mate.
---
I agree. I don’t think I would have stuck with runescape this past year without it quite frankly. It’s the little things that add up.

Can confirm. Did this like a month ago.

I let myself get lured for an arcane back when it was around 80m.
---
I'd just gotten a 197m ely split so bought myself max zulrah gear (3rd age mage hat, arcane etc).
---
I was standing at ge setting my inventory up for a trip when a guy &amp; his friend approached me with their lure, I was feeling confidently arrogant &amp; still riding the ely high so I decided I wanted to fuck with em'. Banked everything except the arcane &amp; went along with it all, shit talking them the whole way "I know this is a lure, you guys are so bad etc", at the end we were stood in the fally bank on a pvp world after I rock caked to 50 hp, he told me to trade him the arcane &amp; stupidly enough I did. I thought to myself "I've wasted their time thus far, lets see how long I can hold him on the trade screen before laughing my way to the logout button"..
---
How naive I was, the guy used an animation delay so I was dragged out the bank to anther guy in max mage who had no problem barraging me to death considering I was half hp..  I'm still salty at myself over it 3 years later.
---
I wasn't even trying to anti-lure, I just got cocky &amp; suffered the consequences. 
---
Chin up OP, it happens to the best of us.
---
This has been happening for a few days now. I’ve seen the Stranger show up multiple times while I’ve been fletching in V West. 
---
took a ton of breaks a bunch over the  years. but in general I was a total noob for my entire runescape career only making f2p pking pures over and over. I had mems for a few months on a main account in 2008 but thats it. Never really explored the game til 2016 on osrs when I made my main account.
---
Honestly they can just implement all the current plugins runelite has to official rs client and thats it... any new plugins would have to be voted by the community, that way u can just shut down osbuddy/runelite and all other custom clients completely. Sure it would take like 6-12 months of dev time but its worth it.
---
[Here's the earliest incarnation of the RS2 world map](https://i.imgur.com/SqMX98H.jpg)

Screenshot was taken during RS2 beta I believe. 
---
In that case it must have been reddit brainlets like you who voted for bigger spell icons because clicking is hard who use this client right?
---
Murdered by words lol 
---
I bet you wish that made actual sense 
---
I’m not saying that even level should indicate an exact number of respective DPS, but the general level should be telling.  While a scim has more DPS than a long sword, they are at least somewhat comparable and have different functionality in the tier, just like the CLS and CRapier did.
---
its just qol bro

The only real way to find out is to pk, you will soon realise what people are talking about.

AHK is supposedly okay if its a 1:1 input to click ratio, which I understand for people with disabilities ^and ^really ^no ^one ^else ^should ^be. That grey line is probably why with AHK, but the prayer swaps is straight botting there's noooo way that doesn't flag something.
---
I agree, a lot of the dialogue is pretty humorous 
---
Does it cancel the freeze? I wasn't aware of that. That sounds a lot more unintentional, if it is the case
---
As far spam clicking the cave entrance, I think something was already tried to be done to prevent it? Might be worth looking around past QA's/updates
---
Jagex is too lenient even on pvm plugins like raide scouting and demonic gorillas honestly they just don't care about game integrity as long as it doesn't hurt their bottom line or draw huge community backlash.
---
So where do we buy the hoodie?
---
Ahh whelp my fault then. Thought it was like 2000 or 2001.
---
The thing is, and hear me out here- absolutely 100% fuck what the players require. We played without these """"mandatory"""" features for literally a decade and liked it just fine!! 
---
This is, imo, an integrity issue. It shouldn't matter what the players are comfortable with. They should just do it. 
---
There is just a huge volume of stuff, mile wide inch deep kinda game mostly. 99% of things are uncomplicated once you read about them for 30 seconds. You can just jump in, ask a question or two/read the wiki on each thing as you go and you'll be fine.

So I'm loving OSRS currently, but I have to say: the music seems a little "off." Like, I get the general feel and theme as I did back in the 2000's, but there's an off instrument at times that I definitely notice.
---
Was there was a licensing issue to the music or is there a setting that I can change that I don't know about? Any info would be appreciated.

Settled’s Morytania locked ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing his ultimate Ironman, he decided to up the ante: to forge his own journey from scratch, no banking, no trading. But this time, he can’t leave morytania, all leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape’s biggest challenges, the Theatre of Blood.
---
Wow with a username like that there’s no way you’re not a troll

The point is all these items (except the black mask) could theoretically be on a player who looks like they have nothing.

Where did I said “only liberals need safe spaces?” I said “safe spaces are for liberals” meaning they’re primarily FOR liberals. When was the last time you saw conservatives protesting for the right of safe spaces? 
---
Of course, conservatives can need them too, I’m not sure where I ever denied that. It can be used for both, just as how female nail polish can be used by some males as well. It usually is marketed towards women, but men can use it as well. 
---
You’re trying to make a point against something I never said just so you can feel accomplished and it’s comedic to be honest. 
---
Q&amp;A was cancelled
---
Ah ok. Your comment about the chaotic maul hitting a 60 was what confused me. 
---
Let's be real, no one cares about the tier. If I'm using t75 and they raise it to 80, I get the levels and we're all still in the same boat. I don't think what we have now is OP (except for blowpipe. Nerf ASAP), because if you look at the stats chaotics were way stronger. Except now we've creeped every little piece of gear, torture, inferno cape, prims, imbued ring, ferocious gloves, serp helm, all of those transform EVERY weapon into an OP version. It's not the weapons themselves, it's the game as a whole. At least we don't have turmoil and ovls. Nerfing blowpipe solves 90% of the problem anyways
---
Ontop of it mate gratz.!

Sounds like a pretty common and popular opinion to me.

Ground loot is kinda necessary right clicking the ground is just atrocious.  I won't even do slayer on mobile anymore because it's absolute dick

This is more about the gif itself. But if you've ever been in the legal field, those binders are filled with more bullshit than anything. Its great to see my opinion of them put into a viewable format.

look at what items gives you most gp per tokkul

gp/tokkul = ge price/tokkuk price

I'm almost certain it's the staff and not chaos runes

Ah right, havent played in a while, a new boss or raid i presume?
---
Its an unpopular opinion because noone would waste their time thinking of this shit

Not wanting to waste money on a wall = not caring about Americans

Now we need a comic about popular slayer areas littered with glass shards everywhere and bob's no boots bare feet ironman is devalued.
---
I'm late but yeah, you're spot on. It's called Secret beach I think
---
There are a lot of valid reasons for people to not like RS3. Having the option of not having to carry around frivolous tools for pointless tasks is not one of them.
---
Bad game design is making you run all the way back to a bank just because you forgot a seed dibber. Convenience is good, and that is the point of QoL updates and the reason there is a whole month dedicated to it.
---
Looks like a dpick and a daxe had a deformed child.
---
If you get high enough slayer level on your alt, you can even use it to lure the dust devils to your main. This way you dont even have to play your main and can just autocast
---
Can't wait to vote for him again in 2020
---
Its because they are quirky with a unique sense of humor /s
---
And whats the difference between that and setting an autoclicker to click the minimap 2 times to reset aggro?
---
I've never pk'd anyone, but I'll defend the wildy forever. Literally all of those things have non-wildy options. It's just that the things in the wildy are better or more lucrative right? That's because it's balanced with the risk if you losing your stuff to a pker
---
No idea unfortunately I know the dharroks set bonus isn't as good as obsidian until those high hp levels.

There's a UIM is often referred to as hoboscape.

That sir reference is for a new quest.     That guy is really penguins that skinned a human and climbed inside.    That was the only reference leak for that upcoming quest.   The name of it will be.  “Penguins go absolutely batshit and skin humans then climb inside it”.

Lol it's okay to want someone to die if the world will gain net happiness

This is a popular opinion

What the other guy responded to you with. He moves his mouse and clicks with his keyboard. Essentially constantly spamming two keys on his keyboard to click insanely fast while only moving the mouse not clicking.

He made a handcam video but I’m on mobil and cba to link it
---
Not me 
---
yeah where can we access this supposed world of pcp? I just wanna know so I can avoid it, at all costs!
---
downvoted for asking a question
---
You could, but it wouldn’t be worth it. You would be better off getting 70 prayer. Getting the morytania hard diaries done, and doing barrows. Then upgrade your gear until you have ahrims, toxic trident, and suffering. work towards 85 magic, 85 ranged, and 75 defense then zulrah will be worth it.
---
Don’t use any client but ones you do research on. 
---
Thanka for the support
---
Righto, then it should change for the normal d'hide too
---
Not mine by the way all credit goes to original creator. Found it in my meme folder and chuckled, again 
---
I'd agree with this if they also incorporated all of the current approved runelite plugins into the official client and allowed the runelite devs to continue to push updates (with some small oversight from jagex, but without a polling requirement). But that would never pass a vote, and if they didn't poll it people would lose their shit.

---
Ah ok. So Trump &amp; conservatives demanding, thru threats of suspending a player’s pay, a safe environment from Kaepernick’s message at NFL games because it emotional harms them isn’t a safe space.  Or demanding a safe environment on their media from Gillette ads thru boycotting/protesting to make them go out of business.  But if liberals do it to a conservative, then it is - which I don’t disagree on that part. I think we’re done discussing.
---
Same thing happened to an alt of mine. Unfortunately I was only left with 83 hunter and a whole lot of box traps. 
---
Lol xD
---
If you didn’t fight back, it was a “good fight” for them. They had to do minimal work and accomplished their goal (killing you). How is minimal work leading to accomplishment not “good?” 
---
Pretty good to reach jad for 1 month player :P
---
Thats hilarious 
---
It is less monetary input to start Vorkath and is easier to do. Some people will appreciate that.
---
I assure you it’s much less than 5 people, just take a look at today’s Crystal Math Labs or hop around the hardwood grove or in Ape Atoll. I’m not saying not to buff anything, but it’s important to see the implications of what a buff would do and how it should be implemented. I much rather see a money making method for those with high level woodcutting rather than just another xp creep method. I don’t think this suggestion achieves either 
---
D hide should have a def requirement anyway
---
So there's no room for improvement in osrs because "thats the way its been forever"?
---
I got 80 in ranged magic and strength before I got 70 prayer. Spent all my money on shit like blowpipe and barrows armor instead of prayer

it’s bis fashionscape with angler

&gt;If people in NJ get taxed lets say 10% of their annual gross income, I wonder who would lose more. Someone that makes 50k a year or someone that makes 100k a year, hmm
---
They would both lose 10%
---
Best of luck in your economics 101.
---
Just train slayer. 50-87 slayer netted me around 120m (whilst cannoning every task where possible). Never did any kind of money grinding, just did slayer whilst of course focussing on worthwhile tasks. Just don't focus on the money making aspect, it'll never feel like your making bank but it really adds up overall. (I'll admit unlocking demonic gorilla's and doing those for every black demon tasks was the first real game changer money making wise).
---
Are you being serious? Dg was accessible as a skill but had loads of content that was gated behind end game levels.
---
What kind of kills are you doing that a maybe 15% damage increase (being generous) is a minute off? 
---
You’ll save a couple seconds on average with rune for 10x the cost.
---
everyone visit White Knight's castle to meet Sir Knight Mark
---
I'm not sure how we'd want to do a cooldown. it could use a "charge" system of sorts; like you could use to reaggro 5 times a day or it has 5 charges but takes an hour to recover a charge. But I'd still want it to work as a cosmetic item like it currently does, so separating the two function could be a tad tricky. I'm not sure if Aggro should be a separate option, but also wouldn't want someone swinging it for fun to burn a charge when they just wanted to swing it.
---
But I do think something like the second option where it has X uses but then takes a while to recharge so you could use it for one or two tasks but then it may be on cooldown for the next two or such would be fair. Or it could just have no cooldown and allow you to reaggro whenever; I don't think removing the "run away and back" would be too big of a change in most situations.
---
You got this dude using his white person voice

We were “done discussing” when you tried to make a point against something I never said to feel accomplished 😂😂

1. No it's not.

2. It's still not griefing
---
3. You confirmed you're stupid, gratz.
---
I don't even pk, I'd be the one doing the clue, yet I'm not stupid enough to think the way you do. If I'm in the wilderness, I'm fair game.

Do you know what the words "statistics" and "anecdotes" mean? How many of the people who run into the wilderness to do clues or other shit bring nothing, and how many bring shit worth more than the runes you wasted?
---
Don't attack me like this.
---
Rune darts are not close to being worth it
---
I can see where you are coming from, however due to melee having two contributing factors (Attack and Strength) it allows them to be a lower level since it is combined to determine the combat level. If Range was set up the same way with Range Attack and Range Strength, you would be able to get away with what you are asking.

Choose to limit yourself by not  rcing guess ducks to be you to then.
---
Dont you have to have it to sell it?
---
Depending on the players wealth id do various things, if they have alot less than me, I would give them the entire  drop when they return. Similar or greater wealth id probably keep it and give them whatever extra loot in my inventory. It isn't worth banking and losing xp.
---
That's probably the worst strawman argument I've ever heard. 
---
I haven't played in a long time. Didn't keep up with the updates and only came back recently. 
---
ye u rite unpopular opinion
---
Then just lol your defence with range then you plonk 
---
The decline was unrelated to the graphic update, it had to do with the loss of wildy and free trade which was around the same time, which kindve explains why you related HD to the decline
---
Swampletics, upvotes to the left.
---
What about inferno cape!
---
omg, lol, when I saw this I thought to myself "connor must be up to his old tricks again!" but then it wasn't you, that definitely is irony.
---
I’m down with any excuse to bust out the black mander 
---
Yeah but if the darts do enough damage to get you the last kill or an extra kill then rune darts are worth it(and trust me, they do). 1 extra vork kill every other run or so makes it VERY worth it. Over 1. 5k kc. 
---
Obviously, and if you make more than you lose more
---
The fact that you said I'm either too young to vote or live in Russia is genuinely hilarious and shows how gullible you are.
---
Trump 2020 btw

Or just use google and youtube? Fuck you redditors are useless cba...

2008. It's not quite as bad as EOC but they're pretty bad imo.
---
"tomrorow" Literall unplayable.
---
Well I hated it last time, its called osrs..it should stay and die that way..and can't you just go play runescape 3 if you want better graphics? 
---
Pkers fuck PvMers in the wildy. PvMers fuck Pkers in the polls. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
I don't understand the mentality of people who clue with everything. 
---
I've been PK'd fairly often when doing clues that I expect  it to happen on certain steps where you're forced into highly contested areas.
---
Is it really worth killing people who do clues for the 1 in 100th chance of some brain let bring their master scroll book like in your favorite YouTuber vids? Where he doesn't show you how much time and money he spent trying to actively find that unicorn?
---
I mean it works for me. I get a chance to rag someone out while risking 0. (22k)
---
Sadly, no one can accurately provide the statistics you’re seeking. However, there are numerous anecdotal accounts of people that bring high value items into the wilderness without knowing any better. 
---
How many times do you waste supplies in pvm to get that “rare” drop? People who pk do it because it’s fun to them and the potential gp on the side is just a bonus...
---
It’s understandable if you don’t like Pking, but comparing the killing of a clue hunter to griefing is pretty far fetched. 
---
People just enjoy playing the game differently and that’s what makes it so diverse. This is why I think it’s better to just respect different peoples playstyles and understand that it is one of the factors that make the game unique. 
---
Some iron man who got 99 herb before the updates is crying inside and burning in rage. Who cares if theres a shit ton of herb patch... 
---
Nah, adding chaotics back kills poison staff/acb/rapier
---
Not that I can afford raid items, but unless you make a new tier of weapons 
---
when i go fish monks its usually no capes/gracefuls lol
---
Yikes

I am 130m xp and somehow 91 total below you

I really gotta do these skills I hate

38 Rc and 9 hunter gang

I’m at 400kc with 2 pets and 2 leathers 
---
Do you know how Demonic gorillas work? After three missed attacks, they will switch attack style. There is nothing runelite tells you that isn't immediately obvious. They never switch to the same style and the plugin just has the two styles it's not currently using shown when it switches.
---
Reddit in a nutshell.
---
We had open border for decades now and never had any real substantial issues. However due to the unrest in the middle-east, slightly more refugees.
---
But on the contrary, refugees are positive for the economy as well as the local economy of the city they reside in. Including the fact that they are less likely to commit crimes.
---
Because if we say "sit kid" you get angry and make brainlet memes on reddit. 
---
Oh man, I'm sorry for you. (The ugly concrete walls)
---
Bielefeld looks almost the same from the inside though.
---
Get monks robes rather than armor, assuming your mele stats are low you’d have better luck killing everything with mage aside from Ahrim. Keep the rune legs and hides, but bank the mele weapon and the granite plate. To much weight and barrows is a lot of running.
---
Should we also change mining then? What about woodcutting? Fishing? Farming? All skills with similar "problems" you described. If you don't like it, don't get 99 in it. No one is forcing you to, and this is not mobilescape, zmi boy.

Is that much better?
---
Before I knew this, I lost like 3m on Ape Atoll from afking in MM1 lol. A lot of people who played back in the day don’t know about the new death mechanics
---
So 2007 to 2008 and suddenly its not OSRS? Why implement GE then? Just go play RS3 right? Thats got to be the worst argument Ive ever heard
---
Nah it took me the whole week for the offer to complete
---
In what way would having 90+ def and range be limiting your account? 
---
no real convinience

when someone gets a hard clue from their gargoyle task and instantly teleports to 35 wilderness
---
What a high-quality contribution to this sub. Thanks man
---
Actually "gf" means girlfriend. I don't know why pkers say that though. 
---
Amazing. Just did lunar diplomacy yesterday and this is too accurate 
---
Must not have had auto retaliate on. You have both range and mage prayers on so he couldn't have hit you
---
Great articulated response once again lol
---
Also, learn what tax brackets are pls

MAGA

Yes the mechanics are easy but having the information just shown for you and taking the thinking aspect out of it shouldn’t be allowed imo

He managed to fuck me and my wife
---
If you don’t NMZ to max your melee skills with Guthans/dharoks you’re missing out 
---
Okey, thats where i agree with, if i only had just few fucks with her i dont consider her as my gf. 
---
he banked the ones with 6 charges and withdrew ones with 5 charges, you see he has hundreds of glories in his bank
---
1500 total? If you don’t have 92 in every skill you’re not even half way done /s
---
Wonder why it’s tagged under “humor”
---
real question is Kebos on it?
---
I’m working on this rn and I swear I’ve gotten easily 400k in loot so far, currently working on the drag defender. I’ve hit so many rune fulls &amp; meds it’s insane. Also haven’t been picking up the big bones.
---
140k bots banned last week. You must be dense af if you think they were all reported 
---
Just because something is not yet detected doesn't mean it's undetectable. If you don't know it's happening you're probably not looking for it.

Dude. You should be my math teacher instead my match teacher.

No, you can't have nice things.  I vote no to all pure-related  and pk content.

You don’t need to kill them but there’s a few second delay after jad and if they kill you during that you won’t get fire cape

"everybody that disagrees with me is a trump supporter!"

There is no thinking aspect to it though. Surely you're not telling me you need to think about the two styles it isn't currently using?

&gt; I know I can build melee to hit 100 faster. My point is that if I want to maintain "ranger" status, especially for things like PKing, I need over 10m extra experience over a "warrior" before I can use Duradel
---
But you want to maintain 'ranger' status especially for things like pking?
---
Agreed with this guy 100%, except ill combine it with the other guy and say if he clearly has more than me, sorry bro, obviously your not that worried about GP since clearly drops aren't much of a priority. 
---
Settled's sweatshirt
---
No it's absolutely not. Unless you mean doing it just once.
---
0 attention given
---
I'd rather get a "sit kid" than "gf" TBF. Like "sit kid" doesn't annoy me, I wasn't pking, I had no chance so who cares if some asshole taunts me about killing me. But "gf" means the guy thinks he's actually got a good kill and is proud of it. That's far more annoying. 
---
This is a bit of a bitching post about the key.
---
No one sells resources after every trip.
---
Just go Google seeking loot tab and you will see.
---
This just makes easier content for creators. And gives the community more things to watch maybe even grow it will also help with numbers they don't give us on drop rates. 
---
I knew there was a reason to save my ID card
---
You have to count the attacks before it changes
---
Yep
---
Thanks! I think I'll try a dark bow :)
---
Sorry, UIM so I don't worry about bank
---
When we get a Konar assignment like greater demons in the chasm of fire. Will our slayer helm still give us the bonus accuracy and str if we decided to kill skotizo? Or if we were to train on greater demons outside of where konar wants us to train?
---
Oh so they were there but just didn't take questions? That's a weird one
---
Thanks poookz
---
That’s fucked. You’re fucked. Fuck me. 
---
If you have Amazon Prime/Twitch Prime you can get free 14 days membership from twitch.tv, just have to link the accounts.  With that being said bond prices should be going down a bit with this so I would start with either of those.  You’re in luck with 95 Slayer since a slayer boss, Alchemical Hydra was released just a month ago and requires 95 Slayer!  Just look up the new Slayer master, Konar and try to get assigned hydras.  Also the Farming Guild was added.
---
I've always been disappointed that neither Framed nor Torvesta has done a video about salamanders. I think they're so op because you can't pray against them, but the current consensus seems to be that they're the worst weapon ever.
---
IF YOU ARE READING THIS FRAMED OR TORVESTA PLEASE MAKE A PK VIDEO WITH THE SALAMANDER
---
As a mini game I’d appreciate it, not as a skill
---
Definitely fun, but when the massive grindscape started I think it went to shit. 
---
I’ll take those over crocs or desert lizards any day my friend. You can afk harpies pretty easily there’s a 3 pt spawn just before that Karajama dungeon. Or the 150 blue dragons Konar just assigned me... as a lvl 76... in catacombs...🙈
---
Versus taking 10 seconds to run away from your spot to reset? This wouldn’t break things as much as you think
---
&gt;Obviously this would take up loads of dev time, but realistically, the game graphics will have to be updated sooner or later to keep the games longevity. I think were all past the ‘nostalgia’ factor at this point
---
Rs2 came out in... 2004?? And it’s still wildly popular regardless of the graphics. How many years before you label this point as a bad argument? Graphics aren’t everything. OSRS certainly isn’t the only proof of that. Many of the greatest games of all time have dated graphics. 
---
Not saying there can’t be a toggle for HD, but that is just such a garbage argument. It’s a baseless opinion *at best*.
---
Dude I think you should’ve clarified a bit in your picture because on a knee jerk reaction I’m sure 90% of people think you’re fat fingering -5% when you’re trying to hit +5%
---
weird to measure superiority by bmi
---
Yes, each barrows brother you kill gives you a roll, on the table. You need to kill each brother to unlock that brothers items. 
---
It first rolls if you get an item, then everything else. So when you don't get any item, you can get any of the possible rewards you have unlocked. 
---
So you don't want to unlock the bolt rack option (I believe its 82%) so you can only roll coins, mind, death runes and bloods. Since bolts are cheaper than both death &amp; bloods you don't want them. Probably on your iron man since you can just buy the ones you need.
---
haahha

I remember bearl!:)

I have done literally none of that but okay keep insta downvoting and carry on with your day lol

Repost 
---
it is a completely optional area, just don't go there wtf
---
You do realize he’s talking about emptying the fountains on pvp worlds not banning the bots right? Seeing as this was something that was talked about on a Q&amp;A.
---
You should describe the buttons you’re talking about better, I’m pretty sure most people think you’re referring to the -5% and +5% not the +5% and +1 coin. 
---
Only suckers do clue scrolls, I have an Easy, Medium, Hard, and Elite clue banked so I can never get clue scrolls as a drop.
---
ha
---
&gt;try googling
---
so I can get some leftist bullshit which refute themselves by proving that more people cross the border illegally than overstay visas (the numbers are usually around 42-45% overstaying visas and I'm sure a bright spry fellow like you can do the math).
---
Aww, mad because I figured out what you were trying to do? Time to walk away with your tail between your legs /lemonface. Have a nice evening though. 
---
I would prefer no GE tbh. 
---
The update i was referring to was 2008. You cna look them up on google to have an idea of what they looked like
---
The only cringy dialogue in this game is the random meme nonsense in zeah. Quest dialogue in rs is solid.
---
No you can't hold F, just the space bar
---
🦆 off mole dick. 
---
I think it's overstated in general that 'nerd' type people don't have sex. Anyone can get laid dude
---
not me chief
---
I normally don't care about stuff like this but this change is pretty iconic - the way lumbridge is today in OSRS is pretty much identical to how it was back when RS Classic was released. Changing it without polling it is a pretty big step.
---
Not sure why people have such an issue with RWT'ers. Jagex has posted statistics regarding this before and well over 50% of the player base RWTs. 
---
It's a part of the game and the you all need to accept it. 
---
Or why they're so bitchy about if they lose nothing.
---
Dude needs to get his eyebrows done. Holy fuck 
---
I was hoping the circles helped my lack of communication skills.
---
i recently filtered out my twitter by muting all politics. shit's a meme haven now
---
Rs3 bad osrs good
---
Runecrafting slow slayer nice
---
Upvotes to the left plz
---
You can only have one of each tier in your possession (whether that is bank or inventory).
---
I’m not your Bwana, guy!
---
First they would have to remove a fuck load of features from it. So people would still complain like hell.
---
He completely avoids and ignores the issue here, saying “jagex could fix it if they really wanted to” and “would you rather use osbuddy?”
---
Adams excuses are always this exact sentiment
---
Runescape rwt isn't pathetic imo, but stealing always is even if you don't sell the gold. I admit skull tricking videos are fun to watch, but I think everyone feels that way based on the like ratio of those videos vs what the like ratio would be on something like this. Can't imagine Torvesta uploading a video with the title "This client is so OP -- I made 1 bil from risk fighting without even touching my keyboard!"
---
Can you source the leftist bullshit which refutes themselves?
---
I'll wait.
---
It’s torvesta 
---
Well, seeing as this isn't a bank, nope.
---
There is a limit to one of each tier at a time. However, if you leave a clue on the floor and continue to slay a monster that drops the same tier for example, it can drop another clue of the same tier. There are players out there who have juggled multiple clues by having one at a time in their inventory and the rest on the floor. 
---
Thank you!!
---
It means both at the same time
---
Bro where’d you get that hoodie? You not the only one tryna represent the gang
---
1800 total and not knowing afk money makers. How can you be this braindead after playing for 15 years? Smells like a bought account.
---
Legends quest is aids and the rewards suck. Seems like a good idea and I like that it buffs the legends quest.
---
Zezima OG, Lynx Titan ProdiGy.
---
Stop lying to yourself. It makes gorillas as brain dead as they can be, you don't need to count the attacks because the client does it for you, and it doesn't make them any slower to kill lmao.
---
&gt;No technology comes from Apple or Dell? 
---
Like what? name me one..

&gt; you don't even know what an operating system is?

operating system isnt an invention, its a category of a type of software.

Dude commented in thread
---
Just to give him a Court Summon.
---
In majority of his guides he says to walk east, but he walks west.
---
He adds required items halfway into his videos. Some videos he includes items you don't need.
---
I'm still not sure if he's a troll or has an illness.
---
At some point he will stake his girlfriend as well
---
Got pked at wildy agility course
---
Dude got 5 monfish and the knife i used to slash the web
---
Currently resetting at sand crabs always results in someone crashing you, which brings the exp rates down. Not having to ever leave makes crashing not worth it. We already have NMZ if people want always agro’d monsters, we don’t need more OP combat buffs.
---
Memories of the best clan events and bonding experience back in the day. Should defs bring these back
---
Can anyone link this info for me, been away for a week, what's changing and what quest? Thanks
---
Not necessarily cheating. But you can rearrange the prayers in RL. And that is something that failed an official poll. So it shouldn't be there at all, but people don't truly care about anything at this point so it is what it is.
---
douche move posting that girl's face on the internet without her consent
---
The entire post was opinionated and biased by my own views of the game.  However, if were talking about games that have passed the test of time, how many truly have graphics like osrs? An HD update would bring in new players rather than keeping an aging and already diminishing playerbase. The rate at which players are joining due to mobile is fine for now, but as we all know, you cant play runescape on mobile only, it simply isnt as easy to use for higher level pvm content
---
Does skeletor pelosi sit behind you while you read your quest dialogue?
---
Does the spirit tree in your POH count towards the total allotted spirit tree count? 
---
This upsets me. I once ran to this shortcut from the gem mine to get another task only to see a elite diary req. You blew it jajgex
---
&gt;	is pretty much identical to how it was back when RS Classic was released. 
---
No it isn’t, look at all these stupid lore breaking npcs like count check or hatius. Why don’t you go get those removed rather than complaining about them replacing a house no one used anyways.
---
&gt;	Changing it without polling it is a pretty big step.
---
It was polled and passed. If you didn’t want any additions to limb ridge you should have voted no to the quest.
---
we do not have an open border in Europe, lol. Refugees are statistically a burden on the economy of any country, if you're talking about LEGAL immigrants, perhaps. But trump has never said he wants to ban legal immigration and the wall has nothing to do with legal immigration. Also, stats on the crime thing? because im very sure that is not true at all.
---
Make it deteriorate after like, 6 times or something... And lose the ability to make that whip crack and you have to take it all the way back to the dude in the jungle to repair it

It's called rng

If you ever go to a pvp world you would see that its mainly pures who run around with the fashionscape clue items. 
---
:O

Crystal math labs might help 
---
If this week's video had been a main UIM video I don't think I would have made it
---
lmao wtf

you would think.....
---
Oh my setup is fine. Semi afk, cheap and effective. I only ever see people telegrabbing and if thats your method alching in between is a good idea.
---
Oh fuck yeah good to know. Thanks
---
On my third attempt I choked and misclicked the wrong prayer when he literally had 1 hit left. Haven't gone back out of shame 😞
---
I think a lot of people remember the quest difficulty as it was when they were a a dumb wee lad who had no idea how to actually play the game 
---
Change it, change everything. Vote yes on every poll. This game needs to be refreshed and remade 
---
Errrrah
---
How is that not a problem? Are you really that fucking thick?
---
Who fucking cares you crybaby pussies no one goes to lumbridge anyways 
---
Yikes. Yet trump offered the concessions that democrats have been asking for like protection for DACA dreamers, 800 million dollars for humanitarian aid, funding for judges to get immigration cases moving, and Pelosi and the dems denied that compromise sooo. What was contained in the dems bill lmao, y’all were straight # resist 
---
Still haven’t mentioned the SOTU 
---
Hello there optimus prime. 
---
The dedication and passion is amazing. Love the idea, could never do it myself though.
---
I get so surprised at how unsafe people are with their account. The biggest one I find is, why do most people not have a designated email for their account? One that you don't use for anything but having it for your singular old school RuneScape account. That one blows my mind the most.
---
daddy
---
I don’t splash, I just asked a question... Don’t really see why anyone would have a problem with that...
---
That blows. That would take forever to get that many glories down.
---
Red capes are for noobs.  All the cool f2p kids had purple or orange.
---
Don't read comments before you watch the video!
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Free-to-play_Ranged_training#Maximum_hit
---
That has a max hit chart, though it's only for f2p arrows.  It should help a bit with knowing when to switch to which arrows.  
---
Took me about 1hr 10m and I was reading all the text and didnt have all the optimal teleports. It's really not that bad and I'm the slowest quester in the world.

Bro if you ever want to talk I got you.

Legitimately the only YouTube series i watch consistently

By not having negative iq like op and not using rune scimmy? 
---
Goddamn hero. Grats on the quest!
---
Got 4m prayer xp without losing a bone. 
---
the video showing the dude causing an absolute scene and losing his mind was transphobic against him. Okay
---
Mmmwhywouldyoueverkillabloodveldinanezzym
---
God dhide chaps have the exact same defensive stats as black dhide chaps. Black dhide chaps require 1 defense. They are black dhide chaps with a +1 prayer bonus. Not really a major bis item change being that they offer THE EXACT SAME OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE STATS as an item that pures can wear. People with no brain shouldn’t be allowed to vote.
---
I'd personally rather you stick the board files on GitHub or somewhere so people can do what they want with it
---
i had memories at the building, training on those lvl 2 men/women when i first started rs in 2007
---
Would be interesting if Jagex started distributing their own honeypot versions of these plug-ins to find people abusing them.  Then just give a stern warning on the first offence, ban on the second.  Wouldn't solve the issue, but I imagine it'd cut down on the people using them significantly.  I bet RuneLite would be supportive/cooperate as well.  Maybe they already do this?  I dunno
---
Blue cape Era clearly better than red cape Era 
---
i think i just came
---
Yes, it’s quite fun seeing the reactions as well :)
---
YESSSS. The only Swampletics post I’m upvoting
---
You still haven't mentioned how Mexico is gunna pay for it.
---
Enjoy being delusional, my shift is over.
---
Take care.
---
Meet Swampletics
---
But then you wouldn't be able to vote???
---
And why would that be, lol
---
You honestly might be better off just afk range training on mobile and waiting until you have the time to do it on PC.  
---
Fight caves is one of the few activities where precision is invaluable, and mobile just doesn't offer that, like you seem to be experiencing.  
---
dont alch wise old man
---
Was about to have some choice words good call
---
nice
---
Dude just said thanks for the gold
---
But forgot to give himself gold before the edit....
---
Today is a great day!
---
If I already finished the quest, why am I doing the quest?!
---
How many waves of healers does Jad spawn? I was under the impression he only summoned the one wave the first time he drops below half health but on my most recent attempt I wiped out that wave and another group spawned.
---
&gt; There is no god - there is only god.
---
That's an odd thing to say but alright
---
i just got my email back after 7 years and went to go log in and same lol sad

Should slayer not be started early?

/s? lol

Discussion
---
People who complain about it either had low agility or bad rng climbing the goddamn rocks underground and got tired of starting from the beginning.
---
Pretty sure tons of people go to lumby. Its literally the spawn for most players. 
---
I feel like I may have seen you...I remember running past someone cannoning ogres and trying to figure out why anyone would do it...
---
my pp is at 12:00
---
How is pro wall xenophobic at all? I just want to strengthen national security and to halt illegal immigration.  That doesn't stop immigrants from coming to the US AT ALL.  In fact, it doesn't change legal immigration at all.  The only thing it could possibly effect are the illegal immigrants. No? So again, how is that racist?
---
The wall would also stop a lot of illegal immigration.  If you don't think it would then you should do some more research.  The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which resulted in building aroujnd 700 miles of fencing and in those areas illegal immigration has greatly declined.  
---
I don't know where you're getting that it wouldn't, but it would.  You do realize the left voted for a wall back in 2006, Obama himself voted for it lmfao.  Now that Trump wants to actually build one all you lefties are against it.
---
if this series doesn't get a golden gnome award, there will be riots. 
---
Absolytely would love it but this salty autistic community couldn't handle events like this giving xp. 
---
“I was only pretending to be retarded” 
---
I also thoroughly enjoy the game and wouldn’t be here complaining about my worries if I didn’t. I voice the concerns because I enjoy it so much and want it to last as long as possible. 
---
The real key is to post a post about Infernal Champion Cape xmog with like 3 recoulours, get 1-2k updoots, then we never hear about it again for that item.
---
I don't think so. I recall this exact point being brought up on a Q&amp;A stream before the first batch of skilling pets was released, and they explained how it would work,  how pets would be prioritized over resources. 
---
Ironically, it isn't.
---
Yep the only money you lose by buying it is how much the price dropped before you sold it back
---
This affected rs players everywhere last winter as well. quality qp
---
Why though? The colors don't match nearly as well as the woodcutting cape does.
---
Exactly. The economy was steadily increasing from 2010 and onwards.
---
Jesus Christ... this went so far over my head literally I was looking at my physical ceiling. I then thought "that's can't be it" and was looking for a hidden message. I thought it was one of those "look at my profile picture, then look at my banner etc." 
---
woodcutting cape is gross, might as well wear a cooking cape at that point 
---
look at the upvote ratio on this post, this is how far the degeneration of the overall communitys opinions on ezscape has gotten. fucking pathetic
---
What?
---
This is literally such a good idea. /u/UIM_Verf GIVES US WHAT WE WANT!!!!
---
You don't really need good gear for vorkath btw, elite void with salve is bis
---
Just because some PKers killed you for no reason doesn't mean all PKers do. Even if 90% of PKers were polite as fuck the majority of PvMers would never vote for things that would only harm them. Polling PvP changes is pretty silly IMO.   
---
"We want to change this spell so it can kill people better."
---
Why would someone who doesn't kill anyone vote yes? They wouldn't. Ever. They just get to feel justified about it because they were "just doing a clue" and got killed.
---
People on here act like if I spare them they'll vote yes, but it's a crock of shit mate. 
---
RS3 map tho reeeee
---
getting to 44 shouldnt be too bad, but idk how he get planks
---
They never mention what they add when they poll a new quest. How feasible would it be to poll every seperate building or tree lol.
---
ye lets make olm even faster than he already is xd
---
I say prayer flick as much as you can, use rune crossbow vs. Ahrim, and the rest once you are out of prayer use ibans blast with full tank gear. You cant really survive the other bosses when out of prayer since your defence is low. 
---
Also don't bother with prayer bonus it really doesn't do anything. Bringing melee is also pointless, bring 1 range pot, 2-3 peayer pots and the rest with good food and you should be able to get some barrows KC
---
Dude that's fucking crazy Inb4 you guys are best friends
---
Well in the case of myself and imediate friends we all are able to do inferno. So when you gear up an alt in absolute max w/ Justi and Lance. RDAs are like 2m+ hour for minimal work if you setup HP alerts in runelite.
---
didn't read lol
---
You have both prayers on so you're fine 
---
“I say we all start packing up”
---
Nope pretty sure you’re just over reacting a bit well all play while you pack up
---
500iq post
---
Proof or it didn't happen
---
It does work like that
---
This so much. Times are changing and we're bringing in a new player base and a lot of RS3ers are migrating over. Very concerning...
---
Yeah, it's just some random guy taking a picture of him and posting it for tens of thousands of people to see. What's concerning about that? /s
---
Turn down the brightness also if neither of those work you probably need a new phone
---
Welcome to bestscape. Enjoy your stay you will find plenty of helpful people and terrible people. Feel free to add me if you need any help with anything RNS coffaro3.
---
Do you scroll through Reddit without an account  Because you made this account just for this post.
---
Fair enough. I meant that the bar could be considered part of the quest, which was polled, even if it didn't get its own poll question or mention in the Dev Blog. In retrospect, it seems they should have mentioned it, but at the time it probably didn't seem important.
---
With skills like Fishing the biggest issue from my point of view is that you can't multi-task. If I go slaying I can bring fletchables or alchables. If I Runecraft at the very least I am running in a loop versus standing in one spot. When doing herblore or theiving you have some slight variety to the whole thing plus insane xp rates. But then you look at skills like woodcutting and Fishing, to grind those out means you have very limited options for doing anything else while doing them. So you want woodcutting you have to click the tree and stand there. Same with Fishing. At least with mining you usually world hop/mine multiple nodes. 
---
Most skills also have solid mini-games to play. barbarian fishing really isn't a mini-game and woodcutting guild is definitely not anywhere near a mini-game. So optimally to get 99 you're standing at barb fishing for 200 + hours and in the woodcutting guild for 200-250. 
---
This is perfect for when you have homework to do or just need to barely pay attention to the game. But when you're in the mood to actively play it can be tough to decide "I'm fishing for 4 hours tonight".
---
They added a door to the kitchen, a back entrance to the castle, Hatius Cosaintus and various streamer Ironmemes.
---
Who gives a shit
---
Shit I might have to go do this
---
They should just make it like an underground pub downstairs.
---
Bro I'm only on episode 3 you ruined everything.
---
[This one](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Locator_orb).

Zombies in tarns lair. They are the drop table peculiarity of runescape
---
Lmao
---
Yes I am a woman, no makeup, bad angle. Bad luck there. Can’t remember exactly what I was thinking there, but I guess I was unimpressed with the total lack of authorisation people make and post pictures with. 
---
When they’re coming from Mortyania they aren’t bringing their best. They’re bringing ghouls, vampyres and skeletons and some - I assume are good people.
---
Yeah, you're right on second thought.  Plus it's not a scalable solution since you'd have to make one of them for every single problematic plugin out there.
---
This is new, ur not relevant.
---
How the fuck is anyone that’s not a jmod supposed to grab statistics for you?? Even then it’d be a total waste of a jmods time
---
You know things can be popular because they are good. 
---
I get you and it is true. Ofcourse not every building or tree can be polled but why add a bar to the most nostalgic place in osrs? Why doesn't Jagex use the Varrock bars that already exist and don't really have a use?
---
Most certainly noodles more frequently than a dragon dart loaded blow pipe VS jad. Tbow is gunna hit big yeah but speed wins when to race healers you need to kill him before they all get there. 
---
Everything you do and say is recorded pal
---
Yeah fuck that guy. 
---
*cries in 100 farming* 
---
Man, I'm actually gonna miss the chainmail and the med-helm 
---
This was a chore and prime easyscape, please go away with all these bad suggestions RS3
---
Because you're only level 45
---
Why didn't you just edit the link into this post instead of telling us you posted it somewhere else amidst hundreds of comments lol
---
Congratulations!

I dunno man, they smashed the butthurt button. Salt: mined.

Read the chatbox but replace the “gargoyle cracking apart” with [this](https://youtu.be/Fkk9DI-8el4).

Its not that deep dawg.
---
I should not look up your stats, gives away what goes on! Another great episode bro!
---
Can you tele me to the mines real quick?
---
wrong
---
As someone who hates the rock cake. You just blew my mind. Wtf
---
No but I do love that series
---
He must be a fan of JonTron
---
It's been touched upon by Jagex, apparently it'd require rework of how music works in game so it's more work than simply adding a shuffle button. 
---
This one had me going till I saw her nose, kinda gave me a Michael Jackson vibe. Hard to fap thinking about Michael Jackson. Other than that fuck yes
---
Don't eat flaming hot cheetos before you masturbate! 
---
I don’t understand your post? Why are you saying that 94 is mid level?
---
Well being lvl 85 like I am means the pures have me ripe for the picking. 
---
That doesn’t make sense. The only people being implied to be “deplorables” were people already voting for trump. If someone wasn’t already decidedly for Trump then the insult wasn’t directed toward them at all. 
---
Besides the fact that the whole thing is taken out of context
---
couldn't you have just bought it?
---
91+ thieving with full rogues outfit is good money and not complicated. Or atleast it usee to be, thieving master farmers for seeds. Hop seeds are low again so that affects a bit plus the farming guild but it used to be 1m+ gp/h.  
---
prepare to get downvoted :)
---
i want the pet
---
Okay but where can I buy this hoodie? 
---
I like to, too, but sometimes there’s just too much. 
---
Makes it that much easier for me. I'm 7 years old. 
---
Yes. Coin pouches stack so really no reason to not have food for the rest of the inventory.
---
what if it’s a trap
---
Great question.
---
Gargoyles, wyverns, and BBB's.
---
red spiky vambraces from eclectic imps maybe
---
it's actually entertaining to watch lvl 80 pkers click on me thinking they can hit me... 
---
I like it. 
---
For quests my advice would be to look at the required items and skills so you can gather that stuff up before starting, then do the rest of it without the guide.
---
Wtf kid 
---
Gotta get that Occult Altar
---
DcTok-Jad
---
Damnit. I’m stuck on swampletics.  That was my first episode 
---
...like I said, literally no understanding 
---
username checks out 
---
I don’t think many people didn’t like it, i liked it more than summoning. 
---
I wouldn't recommend a 13 def pure in the first place. That's 3 combat levels of waste for a slayer helmet and addy gloves man.
---
Get grinding :)
---
But you didn't get the pet?
---
Too much reddit makes you gay
---
So this damages you through absorption? Is that right? So the rapid heal click wouldn’t be as much of an issue?
---
facts
---
and I don't ever see anyone higher than 105 near the abyss, so if I went a couple cb lvls harder no one would be able to touch me. 
---
Red cape Swampletics was my favorite Swampletics, series went to shit after he bought the blue cape
---
Keep the dopamine going with a quick wank afterwards brother  
---
As someone grinding q p
---
for BGloves rn, this is aWesome
---
The only way to note items for uims is if it's farming produce at a leprechaun or potions at the GE (which Swampletics can't do).  I think the herb-to-unf pot npc in Nardah counts as well?
---
So why is it your lucky day?
---
Hard rumble with as many bosses as possible (only worth turning off bosses like Tangleroot that have special kill conditions). Don't pray. Instead use overloads and absorption potions while maintaining 1hp (flick rapid heal to reset the health restore timer) to maximize damage output. 
---
Yes but a lot cheat with ahk.
---
i got an elite clue scroll and a shield left half in the same drop
---
Liked before it came out
---
Good RNG and the flail, apparently.
---
Rapid heal click hasn’t been a thing for a while I don’t think. You can dwarven cake through it. If I’m understanding this correctly though, the locator orb never scales down in damage below 10 until it leave you with 1 hp. Unlike the cake that slowly works it’s way down from 10 when you are low hp

He misspelled blowpipe. What a wierdo

I never really liked dungeoneering back in the day, and I don't know how much more I would now. It could be because I had to solo (was never in a clan and all my friends quit before it came out) but grinding to 70ish was the hardest/most boring thing I have ever done on RuneScape. The xp rates were abysmal when soloing and every time I joined a team, I would just get flamed for not knowing the meta. I feel like this in particular would be a lot more commonplace with today's players and their "efficiency" mindset. Unless people have similarly leveled friends/are in clan I don't think they would be willing to find a team of random people for fear of getting a bad player or getting flamed.
---
Also could any rewards that would make dungeoneering relevant even pass a poll?
---
Kbd is good to pet hunt and has a really quick respawn time. Can end up with a d pick or two maybe too and the kbd head for the slayer helm recolour.
---
It's an item sink for every account that purchases it. So it's not likely to drop.
---
It requires Lost City

libs in this case also happens to mean illegals. You have to go back Jose.
---
coolio bud :)
---
He started playing a week ago, I doubt he has done lunar diplomacy... 
---
Ultimately I just decided that being able to do it all stress free was worth the small cost of xp and gp per hour. Like I said, still make massive money. I've got plenty of time. No need to rush. 
---
Have you upgraded your ibans staff? You won't see much return before you do that at 250 blasts per charge. Also go for an accumulator itll save time and annoyance
---
Yeah, Jimmy, that's salt
---
Just because you can post snarky comments doesnt mean your supposed to
---
This series is fuckin' electric
---
All those things are just things that help you do Slayer anyway. 
---
Found the kid that can't kill Jad
---
A lot tbh I think. My friend has a 60 att 70 def med level with piety, rigour and augury and it’s probably one of the most OP builds for tribridding. Lots of Void accounts also get to this point now since it’s really the only viable void build since it was nerfed a while back. 
---
Literally unenjoyable

thank you!! :)

Before you know it Sammy and Zammy will be nuking it's backyard!

"the only people with experience in killing naked people are the only people who don't know that they never drop anything good"

Maybe pkers know something you don't

More likely an EHP competition but yea basically. Probably agility tickets or something.

Full send boys
---
Yes please, this would be a wonderful thing. A fun break and brings sense of satisfaction as you find disguised penguins in obscure locations.
---
Depends on when they do the engine work. If thats done it can come quite fast.
---
checked &amp; according to this site my email is safe, thank you! :)

---
I had a go on RS3 earlier. It's obviously a totally different game but something just shouldn't be changed, like Lumbridge or the Al Kharid gate. Please don't do this to OSRS too :(
---
Authenticator delay wouldn't help this scenario, they get your IP from you clicking on the link and they can already bypass the authenticator without removing it.

50 atk 70 def 74 pray 99 everything else

Bro when you attack while moving, the extra momentum gives you +5 dmg..

thank you for your advice, I'll be sure to check the blast furnace out! :)
---
sugar and grease isn't really valuable  anymore
---
I use rune legs, helm, mystic body, boots, gloves, avas accumulator, glory, RoD, iban staff (all brothers), dragon long (for killing crypt creatures) and bone bolts w/ cbow (for Ahrim).
---
I manage with 1-2 ppots per run, and sharks or monks. 
---
I start dharok and work clockwise finishing with Ahrim, saving Verac for last (no real need for prayer). Flick prayer on everyone except Dharok.
---
I try to wait for the brothers to do their ghost face before I use a pot.
---
Made 3m in a couple days doing a few runs here and there at a time. Gl
---
yo when is the next riot dawg
---
Player from 2004 here. Completely disagree. Stopping change and progress in favour of nostalgia is what is going to eventually kill this game.
---
Gz 
---
Fucking RIP mith chain
---
While being very entertaining to watch and all...
---
These accounts are getting out of hand
---
Thanks guys! Hopefully I’ll get one soon to keep this grind alive haha
---
What about that certain outfit I see everyone wearing?
---
SAD!
---
You don't have to spare anyone, just like nobody has to act like bad PKers are doing anything other than dedicating their time to fucking other players over. You're killing players who usually have a specific mission and are often not equipped for PVP, of course they're going to think less of you.
---
Same. For a couple of months, Slayer was even lower than my RC level. 
---
I understand it can be very profitable but I’ve yet to experience that. I trained from 58 to 63 recently and the the only tasks I received were 2 x Black Demons, Fire Giants and Blue Dragon. Yay, I guess? I just received another Fire Giants task today and I’m gonna take a break on Slayer for a while. Apparently Slayer only gets good until level 70. Right now I feel like I’m wasting my time doing all these shitty tasks when I can make more money from Barrows instead.
---
This might be because I played the forest recently but.. this kinda looks like an effigy 
---
Truly amazing. It has been quite some time since I saw an idea that was this bad.
---
Wait new plan lets put zulrah in the house
---
"Pile" is a strong word.
---
In fairness it is blocked by under Jagex’s own profanity filter.

Wtf am I looking at

Great work, we're onto something here.

How do I delete this comment
