2007, the massacre
---
---
---
Missed a fat opportunity to name it SplashMountain
---
Have fun and enjoy the adventure!
---
Have you considered that in 2007 most people playing were kids and teenagers? The player base is not the same.
---
I'd love to go back to high school, that's like 20 years ago :).
---
Chinchompas for ranged training, herbiboar and birdhouses for herblore supplies.  High level imps often have good rewards, most notably the dragon imps.  Lucky imps have great rewards but are so rare its unlikely you'll get anything.
---
Fits with the Monty python references they've added. take my vote
---
Its actually not what you said by looking up about 2 inches.
---
*ssssssmmmmmooookkkkkeeeeeee innnn thhhheee wwaaattterr* ^fire in the sky
---
Unpopular opinion: 25 buttholes deserves a golden gnome
---
You are screaming "ban me!" so hard man, I mean this is kind of acting as if you were selling drugs next to a police station.
---
I love this, but I'm already 99 and have the pet too.
---
You literally said ‚ÄúI doubt there‚Äôs that much work to do‚Äù.
---
That's incredible, very good job to whomever made it.
---
I use a laptop. Spam Tap the touchpad, never actually make a click.
---
Followed !
---
Shame they're not making a strawman mode because you'd be good at it!
---
Don't stop I'm almost there
---
god i wish that were me
---
Perhaps the lore is/will be different for OSRS, but I think what RS2 established there is a safe bet when you consider Song of the Elves mentions the elder god Mah.
---

---
Too much of Runescape's lore is difficult to learn about, as it's scattered among twitter, updates, in-game dialogue, in-game books, the actual runescape novels, Q&amp;A sessions, etc. Really, nobody can be blamed making mistakes.
---
I still very much appreciate your artwork and the fact that you've worked in deeper than surface level lore into it :)
---
is your name andrew
---
Just checked it and it's as I said. Are you remembering wrong? https://youtu.be/88J74HaB4WY

[removed]
---
Yup just check the wiki page for tangleroot :) idea behind most of them was that time / cost / level should impact it. Same reason thieving a man isn't the same chance of Rocky as thieving a Paladin for example. Otherwise pet meta would just be to spam pickpocket men when at their no fail level.
---
Though farming has some weird ones with some questionable design. Seaweed being the most obvious weird choice. It's one of the best pet patches despite growing in like 40 minutes, being a profit patch and being heavily involved in ironman meta. Same with mushroom, pretty quick low level and very cheap patch to grow. Yet amazing rates.
---
Other ones make more sense like fruit trees and spirit trees because of their level requirement and massive growth time.
---
hespori is like a big tree spirit.
---
Which was one of the best ways to get a rune axe before the woodcutting guild
---
Use resources like the wikia as it is official and can for the most part answer any specific questions about drops, use for certain items, and also has guides from a lot of things like training or how to do quest. As well as helping you to get familiar with the lore of things if thats you like that sort of thing.
---
&gt;Why Specific Graardor?
---
&gt;Because it's Pet *General* Graardor
---
Was a highlight for me, bigbrain
---
Unlucky as hell mate. I partner boosted my mate when he hit 95 to get his first task cos I had tons of points and Konar blocks. He got one pretty quick and decided to annoy me by getting claw and 3 leathers his first task while I got 2 tails...
---
Is the magic logs from the zombies in Tarn's lair a better option for ironmen than using that tree in legends quest I wonder
---
No is name is Andrew too
---
wiki, not wikia
---
God Ash is a gentleman and a scholar, you take that back this instant you cut, you ruffian, you scoundrel
---
+1 for one involving wize old man
---
They haven't. But I doubt it seeing as it's not an ingame minigame or boss.
---
Are they any good?
---
Because all the backlash comes from the socially unaware neckbeards that hate their own physical appearance. You can‚Äôt even see the guys face lol
---
It's one of the best and rarest shields in the game. It's a 1/4k drop and each kill takes ~15 minutes.
---
Ty
---
Back in runescape classic I snagged a green mask from a drop trader. That still is my greatest runescape moment. Dude was in dranor which was a dead town in classic. Got a few guys in varrock church to, it was my go to money making as a kid.
---
To a comment that said ‚Äòthe best we could hope for is 2020 Q 3\4‚Äô 
---
Context is your friend
---
We just need the players to stop playing the game. If instead of trading the bots people just reported them there would be no reason for them to keep running it. 
---
They COULD add a game like this to the game room where each player stakes a certain amount on a game of odds. Lower risk of scams and it would bring a lot of the bots to a more secluded spot.
---
Literally replied to a comment saying it would be the end of 20/20 but ok.
---
You fight with the strength of many men sir knight
---
This could totally work. They could add some fun dialogue since King Arthur is already in the game too
---
I grinder hill giants until I had enough for a rune longsword and full rune. Felt like forever. Then when I got that I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do next but the resource officer at my school was kinda my RS guide and he told me to kill chaos druids so I did. I slaved away selling unids 1k each until I had a g maul. Then I used that as my main weapon and got made fun of for using it. But it was my pride and joy. I spent 350k on it. Then I saw someone with a gold one at Lumbridge. I begged him to trade it for my g maul and ended up giving him 100k on top of my g maul for it. Only to find out I couldn‚Äôt even use it.
---
Well 20% of the player base salt voting speaks volumes to PvP polls
---
Gz on the swamp tar, been grinding Zulrah for weeks for that drop
---
Ya it was üòâ
---
I don't agree - prohibition has never worked. People will always try to find a way around it, and it doesn't solve the root issues.
---
A more holistic approach would be to implement a collection of popular gambling methods as a mini-game. By beating them at their own game, you can divert traffic away from botters/scammers and put them squarely out of business. Here's the rough idea for how Jagex can run the UIM/BET bots out of business:
---
* Must be readily accessible via teleports OR within short walking distance of an established teleport
---
* Odds of winning and game mechanics are explained before the player is allowed to gamble
---
* Entry must be gated behind an easy quest, but the quest must contain several RNG-dependent elements to effectively combat botting
---
* A small 5% 'sin tax' rounded up to the nearest GP would be deducted from all earnings
---
* Scale the odds of winning inversely to the bet placed
---
As an example, a bet between 1 - 250,000 GP would have a 50% chance of winning. From 250,000 - 500,000 GP, 49%. 500,000 - 1,500,000 GP would have a 48% chance... and so on, up to a max value of 20M GP with a 10% odd of success (again, numbers mentioned are an example, but a realistic max value needs to be set). It keeps in line with the RuneScape mantra of "high risk, high reward".
---
* Implement an in-game event based on the total gross community GP lost from gambling + 'sin tax' amount
---
To explain in further detail, let's assume the following:
---
1. Total GP lost counters reset weekly @ 00:01 GMT+0
---
2. There's 5 tiers of community losses from 10M - 100M GP
---
3. Total community losses are synchronized across all worlds
---
4. Each tier reached very slightly increases everyone's drop rate chances for rarer items, but does not change the item pool
---
With that set, let me explain further:
---
Every Sunday at 23:59 GMT, the total community losses would be announced as an in-game broadcast (also receivable once you log in - independent of the day - similar to Bert/Zaff reminders). Those who have gambled the past week can come to the gambling area at any time that week and enter an instanced map that includes 1 - 3 chests. Each chest would have the ability to roll for only non-tradable cosmetic items at a 1/100 rate (with more desirable items set at lower chances - i.e. Scythe at 1/1000). For instance, this drop table may include:
---
- RS2 holiday items (hats/scarfs/Christmas crackers/rubber chickens/scythes/etc.)
---
- Random event based items
---
- Other cosmetic items obtainable in the overworld (but not quest-related)
---
- New gambling-themed cosmetics (?)
---
- Absolutely nothing!
---
That's my speal. Maybe my idea is a little too grandiose here and there, but overall what's important is to incentivize gamblers away from established black market methods and prevent it from becoming a reliable money making method.
---
yeah but 1/256 is rare enough and it matches the boss being a big tree
---
Is training mage with slayer and financing my way through a viable method? And if so, which spell should i use? 79 mage 70 slayer
---
Given the lore already on the chests, they could slap some on easily enough. Though it would be better if it did require the relevant quest to equip.
---
That said, RS2 didn't add them in that great of a way either. They were part of WGS because Surok was put in the quest, which honestly does feel a bit out of place for the Dagon'Hai to be allied with Lucien. But it doesn't require WGS to equip; just that miniquest following What Lies Below. And aside from the set you get in the quest, it is just dropped by Dagon'Hai Monks in the Chaos Tunnels, which have no reqs to access. Still would be better to involve the Dagon'Hai more directly than from a chest, but either way no reqs to obtain.
---
you didnt see the snake skin? far more impressive.
---
But than Jagex couldn‚Äôt sell GP.
---
good times lol
---
Is this from the guy who made the post earlier about selling an account?
---
That LMS diss lmao these are pure art
---
You dun goof'd mate. You must have no self-respect as you are only humiliating yourself here.
---
I dont think jagex would have you recover a bought account, because account selling is against the rules
---
Yeh you didn't need to do anything fancy to do it on an unmodified client with no .dat file changes. You just put them side by side and clicked login on both in quick succession.
---
Should be, as long as you're not burst/barraging. Use a trident &amp; slayer helm.
---
Bruh they‚Äôre not adding tater tots to the game lmao
---
Upvotes just for the Ms paint skills
---
Yea I have requirements now for elite. Just need the head
---
Poor taste
---
I did but the resolution still looks bad
---
cause hes a jobless drug addict that couldn't afford one, the only reason he even got this computer hes so happy about is by stealing from lenders on /r/borrow.
---
Thx
---
Really depends on the task. Certain slayer tasks are amazing for training mage (dust devils, nechs, etc) and others would be terrible for it. I wouldn't say it's a good idea to just pick a spell and then use it on every slayer task no matter what it is. 
---
However if you wanna go that route, the best dps you can do and still earn full XP would be a smoke battlestaff + time of fire + fire wave. Trident is likely to be more dps, but you don't get full XP while using it.
---
Oh my god yes
---
It kinda looks like Phantasm from Terraria
---
They did! 15 people or so.  Thanks man!
---
Thanks man, much appreciated!
---
Using the controlled melee attack style grants 4 skills at once. 5 if on a slayer task. 6 if they drop bones and you have a bone crushers. 7 if you use a cannon.
---
I was on an iphone xs and couldn't even tell but now that I'm at my desktop it's so obvious
---
1/256 for a single piece, so it‚Äôs effectively less than 1/50~ for any piece?
---
A bug bounty system so that security issues actually get fixed.
---
Just bought blowpipe and finished fight caves, I plan on keeping the BP. What uses does it have?
---
Massively. Don't use a trident.
---
Mine was in osrs when it first released. saw someone selling dragon bones for well under market value, wasn't paying attention and brought 1k big bones for 1m...
---
Finally not a virgin
---
If you do a good first spec, save your second for the second kill.
---
At that rate, 1k hours of in-game time (granted it can drop sooner) is insane
---
5 more tasks and finally got one! - That's so unlucky mate, RNGesus giveth and RNGesus taketh.
---
GL
---
It's too perfect to not be cnc
---
As long as it isn't hardcore, the chaos altar. 
---
Ecto isn't terrible either as getting 70 isn't as bad as it sounds
---
You must be stupid lol
---
Nice
---
Most of the enemies you burst (other than smoke devils) have little to no mage defence. Prayer rings: Ring of the Gods/ Suffering is better.
---
So drop table information is a per kill basis. The 1/19.7 is the chance for THAT kill to get that item. 2/37 is still just a chance of a drop for that particular item or subtable (Subtable being herb, seed, etc).
---
For example your use of Grotesque Guardians. On their page the loot table is what is rolled once. GG's roll this entire table twice (outside of the tertiary drops, i.e. RIP no double rolls for the pet). So for instance your two items are.. Granite maul and Rune battleaxe. That would mean your first roll hit the 1/750 (1/250 for 1/x) chance for the first roll and then the 3/137 ( 1/45.67 for 1/x) chance for the battleaxe.
---
So to recap, the entire loot table on any monster is a per kill chance of those items. In the instance of monsters rolling twice, they usually roll the main table twice and tertiaries once.
---
Now get free total level to 420
---
they have always been in OSRS if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre talking about. I was a top ranked woodcutter the first few weeks and I bought the second D Axe in the game for 4.4M (which was god tier money like the fourth or fifth day in the game).
---
GL, you can log out to cool your nerves right before jad
---
Fair point, as someone with 89 (nearly 90) range, what would you recommend as a "good" spec? I tend to stay if I hit 45-60+ (with both together) 
---
Only 77atk/83str atm tho
---
I've def met the guy on a hellhounds task in the stronghold lol. That or another person that eats dog pussy

3- the officer (idk what they are called) who killed the person also got punished somehow. I'm not 100% on details
---
192 now and no tbow. You right
---
Soo.. a vitalis? Damb
---
I agree with you, but Curtis's Ely reaction is honestly about what I'd expect from someone who spent around 1,300 hours looking for that item.
---
Lemme spit some numbers real quick since you seem to be worried about gp. From 50-99 FM, it takes around 525kc according to a previous post on reddit. Let‚Äôs say you sip an average of 1.5 brews per game. Brews are around 4k gp, so an average of 6k spent per game. 525x6,000 is 3,150,000. According to previously mentioned post, that person made around 21m from 50-99fm. Now let‚Äôs say you get unlucky and only make 20m. Subtracting brew cost let‚Äôs round up to 17m. That‚Äôs 17m for a fairly afk, decently good xp rate, and somewhat enjoyable piece of content where the previous meta was to waste tons of gp to sit at the GE and burn logs. Now, since you spent 3m on brews, you can go do bosses to make that 3m back. You can get that in under 1.5 hours at zalcano, which you can now buy a dragon pickaxe for with the money you made from Wintertodt. About 3 hours at vorkath/zulrah, but seeing as you‚Äôre complaining about WT, I‚Äôd recommend Zalcano since the other two may be a bit too hard for you. This is hands down the easiest ‚Äúboss‚Äù in the game, it‚Äôs fine how it is and a majority of the player base will agree with me. Thanks for the down votes in advance.
---
There was a spot in runescape classic, you could walk by the entrance of al kharid towards the digsite before the digsite was there... you would follow this one square path of land all way out to the water. I would spend 10 minutes walking there to be safe drop trading....    does anyone else remember this spot?
---
Play this right and you could get 99 rc. Then you can tell her how insane she is after you change your password obviouslyüòÄ
---
not funny, your joke about parkison 'boy' made me dislike your video. 
---
never joke again about these things people die because of it and still no cure.
---
On top of doing something else sure 5 cents you didn't have before
---
I'm not going to pretend I read the whole thing, but this is the best concept I've heard. Thematically fitting for the region, versatile, and an upgrade to an existing item. Seems strong. Especially the veracs buff. But could be what the jmods are looking at for a boss that's supposed to be comparable to Corp
---
Careful my bwana... saying the words ‚Äúcosmetic override‚Äù on this sub is bad juju
---
Yeah this guide is generally for Zeah only, but twisted league players can use some of the tactics shown. Not only have I been working on several more guides, but I'm also working on a masterclass twisted league guide for everything you need to know... basically everything I can put into a video for the release of twisted league. Be on the lookout for that :)
---
And and and magic secatures
---
Wouldnt it be 1/256 for any piece?
---
Well yeah....
---
Yes yes also essential. Good call.
---
Well if you had a 6k+ KC on one monster looking for 1 drop you‚Äôd probably have the same reaction
---
Have you talked to Oziach??
---
Back when the Dragon long swords first came out in classic they used the normal long sword art but with a tinge of red. Imagine a bronze long sword but slightly redder.
---
Some guy got my 64k rune legs, he put up the long sword, then cancelled on the confirmation screen. Then said "soz wrong button" out up the bronze long, I put up my rune legs and spammed accept.
---
I swear he made an absolute killing doing this. 3 days later the Dragon items got new distinguished icons.
---
if it‚Äôs 1/256 for a hat, 1/256 for robe top, etc. for every item, then *any* piece should be less than that because each item is 1/256.
---
These posts are really creepy, and this sub doesnt help by upvoting them. Respect others privacy
---
I mean in reality we did have a lot of monsters we went through that had drops on them that really didn't actually exist on their table. So it definitely happened, whether we heard about it from people or not.
---
ITS FRIGGIN TREY WEY
---
Im glad they finally mentioned that poll for the death mechanic rework.
---
I'd been talking about it for awhile, glad they said "our b for dropping that disscussion" it did seem to dissapear, a lot if people were behind it.
---
Listen to this rat squirming, trying to justify himself: "if I didn't do it someone else would".  
---
"Something fair" my ass and you know it. 
---
I bet he's on reddit and will read this thread. I hope you think about all the people who's stuff you took and how you made them feel when you're trying to sleep at night.
---
Should've had 420 arrows. 5/10 since you still 69'd
---
So no one used a lot of Scythe on some dumb little NPC?
---
Yeah I meant as a kid. I just looked it up and apparently it was in 2005 and now I feel old as fuck.
---
Is there a way to tell how many red chins you‚Äôd need for a certain amount of range in mm2 tunnels? I‚Äôm thinking of just training hunter with red chins and using them to train range rather than blow a shit ton of money on them
---
I always use prop swap
---
Don't think. Imagine.
---
Woosh
---
Do the quest garden of tranquility it'll boost your farming
---
You can do some wildy slayer too for some geepee
---
I‚Äôm seeing some comments that say to get rid of gambling completely. I like gambling at the duel arena, throwing in some money trying to get double what I have is enjoyable to me
---
You do realise keepsake keys don't actually "destroy" the item, right? You can retrieve the item you keepsaked, the only thing you really lose out on is 1 keepsake key.
---
Uhhhh
---
That‚Äôs literally a restricted account x2. You choose to restrict your gameplay
---
Mate I'm just trying to enjoy myself, and share some enthusiasm about pking for once. I thought it was a nice experience and showed that pkers aren't all dick heads. I was just some nub skiller, and the cool kids took me in. There was friendship, hardship, triumph, romance all tied in to that story and you're telling me you're not rock hard right now?
---
True enough I‚Äôll do that thanks, I have better ways for gp but I do need my slayer to level 70‚Äôs so I can make some decent money lol..
---
Why‚Äôd you cross out some stats?
---
i mean we can make the osrs ones destroy the item, then.
---
idk dude i want to override bludgeon with shadow sword
---
We couldn't have our little pug lose on any of that sweet sweet Wojcicki juice.
---
Yeah
---
Haha those numbers scare me I‚Äôll quit 1k over rate
---
Risk fighting is dead with all the custom runelite plugin

If you think that's bad, I was using Penance gloves at the Blast Furnace for almost 2 hours before I realized I was getting half XP.

Wow, this is glorious, you‚Äôre a hero.

---
And it would make it so that you had to have gotten an axe before that change happened if it were to happen to have gotten one which doesn't seem fair.

...not because they're embarrassingly low, that's for sure
---
Same here bro.. I even did it with D claws when they came out.
---
try talking to oziach right before the raid. I found it helps if you raid with a banana in your mouth the whole time too.
---
imbued gives a damage bonus, other one doesnt
---
26 played since a kid, I‚Äôll prolly love it
---
Wow, that‚Äôs very obscure.
---
Nah mate you slaughtered someone.
---
Gz on that rune set, if that took multiple attempts to get then it would have been better to just buy the set.
---
Basically the gist of this, yeah.
---
The original idea for this came to me while doing a Greater Demon task and thinking that the only fairly decent drop they had was their ensouled heads, but they aren't very common, so this item would give some incentive to pay closer attention to a task that's commonly more afk.
---
Wait,  what?  Please explain swatting?

Questing. It forces you to level up skills and it unlocks some of the most beneficial things in the game

I'd love to see you ink up some more lore! You should really do a osrs  comic book or something! Theres tons of material lore wise to work with. This is just awesome

I'm currently trying to play without guides and I'm stuck on my first beginner step lmao. I must have a peanut head because even after thousands of hours logged I can't remember jack.

There are people with 200m in a skill and they dont have a pet, youre just unlucky. Most people that get a 99 will not get the pet along the way.

You cannot get any pets until you talk to him and then afterwards you do the Spin emote and your chance at a skilling pet is unlocked.
---
Personally I‚Äôve really enjoyed the ‚Äúbig battle‚Äù mechanic that was in SotE and Frem exiles so this sounds awesome
---
Easiest way start in one location. Like varrock, and start going in one direction while clicking it a bunch. If it says warmer go that direction. If not go back and try a different way. 
---
If you dont want to do it on your own. Try using a client that does tells you the location by opening the minimap. But sometimes it bugs out when you get two in a row. So refer to the former statement.
---
Do you know of any clans that offer this service? I'm interestes
---
Looks like you got a bug. Thankfully the pendant isnt important for any other quests but im not entirely sure how to get one again... Maybe django in draynor? He usually keeps your cosmetics safe

---
That's what i meant. No streamer adds anything, so why should a famous streamer like B0aty get a boat named after him in the game and not the one who makes the most watched quest guides on yt.
---
"dob't get me wrong I'm all for the suggestion for bosses resetting but yeah you limited yourself and game should not be developed so people who chose harder mode have it easier?"
---
Maybe I worded it poorly but I'm all for QOL/bug fixes for irons but the way game's been made to be easier for irons is just dumb.

Hes trolling

This man held my spot for me until I got back from my walk to the vape shop, then hopped when I logged back in without me telling him to. Be like Lopkin.

This man deserves a swift slap to the chest
---
I guess my main idea was to add a mechanic that could bring ensouled heads more into the mainstream prayer methods because it's a more interesting prayer training method than clicking an altar a couple thousand times.
---
my bad. missed the word speedrun in his post ;)
---
I mean add something like figure something out or discover/do something new
---
I tried playing LMS and this is brutal. People switch prayers right when you change weapons and doing this crazy fakey no scope 360 gear switches

Ah yes, the elusive Climbing boots g what a shame..
---
Whasaaat is going on here,???!!! BECKFEST
---
where was it stated exactly? is there a blog post?
---
what are all these items called
---
haha?
---
When they added Spiked Manacles, Climbing Boots (g), Wolf Mask and Wolf Cloak into the medium table earlier this year, this did make going for a specific item **slightly** harder, yes.
---
he went on tip.it
---
The beta is probably in an couple hours. Only beta tho.
---
The people complaining aren't the ones losing shit. They are the people going into the wilderness with 0 risk and getting attacked constantly at any popular spot. Most the time when you anti pk the people camping certain areas the loot is often under 100k as well.
---
The real problem with the wilderness is there are no activities that really encourage people to risk and so the pkers that dont want to fight other pkers and only want to find pvmers that will never fight back will basically attack anyone for like a 20k profit.
---
What do the wildy elites do in this situation? Sorry new player.

It's annoying as shit. The only thing that fixes it for me is tabbing out and back in. Which gets dangerous especially in the times where it pairs with another mobile bug. Doing brutal blues on task while watching youtube pnp, accidentally tap the chat bar, tab out and back in to fix....blackscreened...oh fuck. The only thing I can do is close app and pray that I dont die in the next minute because i dont remember what world i was on. I wish this would get attention from the devs. Soo many mobile glitches and it seems they dont care

Pvp is endgame content, so dharoks will be used a lot. Guthans is optimal for long trips at cerberus. Veracs is a great duo method at sara. Karils would be extremely effective in pvp as well as pvm. Ahrims would deal massive hits with fire surge in pvp and pvm (bosses). Torags would be used at gwd.

Old school was primarily for adults, it's a reboot of a classic. If adults can't understand basic account security, sorry but that's their fault. I've played on and off since 2004 using the same account and never had an issue. Why anyone feels the need to blame jagex is beyond me
---
Its kinda hilarious how people constantly spout this "pkers don't want to fight pkers". Have you ever actually been pking? Yes I will kill anyone I see as you never know what they have but if theres a guy wearing nothing vs a guy in 1m hybrid gear you can bet I'm going straight for the hybrid as its a much better chance that I'm going to get good loot. I've also found pkers fighting pvmers multiple times who will leave the pvmer to fight me instead.

No no, let us hunt peoples' pets.

---
Maybe these people are just learning, either way theres no such thing as easy kills and free loot. You might get lucky and kill one PvMer but sooner or later you're going to encounter another pker who can kill you whether you want to fight them or not. It took me months to get good enough to actually make profit from pking.
---
For me it takes two days

Id only do this method for the first day or so to get gear and skilling stuff. But id focus on something that gains you xp as well as gp. Slayer is good bcuz you can train your melee as well.

When i was f2p i did so many different methods i forgot what i did. But the 2 best methods for me was making sapphire rings, and tele grabbing wines. Then grinded to 750 total level to go upstairs. Took me a week to buy a bond.(Back when they were like 3m lol) I even was tele grabbing wines when i got to members. It was good gp. Saved up for another bond. And its been history since.

I like to stake but never would I buy gp to stake, I just make Some millions in game and try My luck. Its such a rush to get a W streak. Its the fastest money by far in game, but you also need to be prepared to hit a L streak. The arena is a nutty place. I find it a Very sad sighting to see 5+ people begging for loans day in day out. They have No shame imo. Just play the game

Have you tried an ironman? Ive played since late spring 2005 and my accounts have always been for pvp. Get rfd gloves fire cape ancients/lunars and pk. That is all Ive ever done. Recently started logging in less cause all my friends have quit and moved to other games and one day thought fuck it lets try ironman and it really is one of the funnest times I‚Äôve had on this game. Super satisfying to see it progress.

Ironman is not an excuse to make something more avaiable.

I always went somewhere secluded like inside one of the runecrafting altars, and that wasn't even trading between alts it was my mam giving me stuff playing on our only computer

Similar droprate to emblems, maybe a bit more common.

Yea baba yaga is a russian? Folks tale about a witch in a house with legs.

Far out.  Just read about the witcha incident.  Disgusting behavior.

and i guess the malediction shard and odium shard from crazy arc should be like 20m? Bask knights are the same cb and have a way lower slayer point req

PVP griefing?

---
I belive in you! And in RNGesus...
---
and those items are not bis ;)
---
What about the BH ranks, the last few players that do play currently only care about ranking does every kill still only yield 1 bh kill 'score', even on a killstreak, in the new bh?
---
3140
---
I don't actually think rcb and broad bolts is ever better dps than msb (i) with rune arrows
---
If you put it in the dps calculator, 61 range unpotted and naked otherwise, you get the best conditions for rcb (since msb will get more accuracy %-wise from any gear). Even if you use a custom npc with like 3k def the msb still doesn more dmg.
---
Could work **IF** they don't add any uniques to these BH crates, cause these would be inaccessible for IM in that case. We know Jagex wanted uniques to come from these crates, but that stuff failed/got cancelled (PvP weapons, corrupt dragon weaponry, abyssal dagger upgrade etc.)
---
u/JagexGambit will the ornate maul handle be purchased with points in the new BH store, or will they be added as a potential reward to BH crates as planned originally?
---
yes pleasee take care of the thematic side of the game, it adds depth to the game and in turn makes a lot of things more meaningful, it's too "private servery" to just add rewards wherever without a reason, it's something that's too obvious between osrs and rs2
---
Yes, it was terrible.

A full ranged outfit with shield switch, not bad haha

Everytime I get told to sit, I vote no for each subsequent pvp poll :)
---
Man, it is almost like I just poked fun at his wording or something
---
Polling is fine, its not broken due to some things you like the sound of failing, everyone has stuff they like the look of fail to get up sometimes.
---
I do a lot of wilderness slayer, and something I dislike is how my slayer's enchantments stack up endlessly in my bank. Maybe it's a good idea to implement something like how the looting bad used to work? If you lose it, you'll have to "grind" a new one. This would make players think twice about bringing their imbued msb or ring of wealth into the wilderness, as opposed to just having an abundance of banked scrolls.
---
That said, I think the MSB scroll should be pretty rare, as it's a VERY good weapon at 50 ranged. The current droprate for slayer's enchantment is about 1/250 on average. I'd say the MSB scroll should be around 1/500, while the ring of wealth scroll should be a bit less rare.
---
It‚Äôs so bizarre to me that those failed lol.
---
Wiki says rogue's revenge is received when you have more rogue kills, which as I understand only have to happen on the bounty hunter world and don't have to be your target. 
---
If that's the case then you should still be able to get it after the change, but the other hat (that you get from killing your target) would probably be discontinued.
---
6,320 I‚Äôm sorry
---
Sure mobile mouse support why not.
---
But you do realise that every single potato can run this game right you dont need a $1000 pc or phone to play.  6 years ago I was playing on a second hand laptop I spend like $100 on then over the years saved up to buy something better.
---
thanks for the spreadsheet my dude
---
Dammit already completed my black knight grind :(
---
Makes sense - they cost 1 tier 1 emblem in the BH store, right?
---
6314
---
RoW cost 50k points, msb cost 100k points.
---
Id like to meet up with this legend purple skin bro ingame.
---
When does the beta end?
---
cost/value wasnt the posts point, it was asking for an upgrade, there's already an upgrade..
---
As annoying as these guys are I think it would be a lot more beneficial if we all just took 10 secs to just report these bots as they usually will be banned within a few mins afterwards. If everyone just took a few secs to do so we probably wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with them in the future much. Food for thought anyways just an opinion of mine.
---
I get that, but I've seen many people vote against it for that reason.
---
I remember I once got scammed out of my full Mithril gear. An armour trimmer on the Lumbridge Bridge.
---
He first took my Mithril platebody. He then started to run away and then was like... "you know what, trade me the full set". I did, he equipped it and then equipped some gold-trimmed Mithril... And then logged out.
---
I added him as a friend, so I could see his dot and world. I hopped worlds following him. I'd always type that he was a scammer. When he hopped, I hopped. This went on for a few days, until he added me to his ignore list and my technique failed.
---
I want to find a noob in Mithril armour. A F2P noob, not a bot. And I'll trade him Gold-Trimmed Mithril. It's only 50k for the set. I've made more than that while typing this (through slayer).
---
Find a F2P noob, tell them how I got scammed, and then trade them the set.
---
10/10 keep it up!
---
the emblems are removed from the wilderness slayer drops, wildy slayer is just for points and larrans keys now.
---
1/5616
---
3024
---
Same boat. It feels like all jagex update in a timely manner is ironman and mid level content. There's a large abundance of true end game PvM, which is largely to do with an issue with what rewards they can add. But then they go and add a BIS helm to level 60 slayer monsters aimed at mid levels... I've began playing rs3 and other games, while pet hunting on osrs and will mostly just play for the new content in future
---
Why suicide in clan wars?
---
Drop rate of skulls cape is 1/5616 per reward slot. An easy clue has on average 3 slots of rewards so the drop rate per easy casket would be 1/(5616/3) = 1/1872.
---
Same principle for rangers boots.
---
i mean its in beta right meow so they can tweak before releasing
---
iirc, CoX initially struggled somewhat with rewards, those op armours weren't well received, Jagex should apply the way they dealt with that situation to things like bh rewards by polling earlier and leave a decent window between initial poll and release, so if there are problems with getting stuff in, identify the issue with failing (in this case most of the rewards would make a lot of peoples wild experience worse) and find additional rewards that suit it, for an off the cuff example, given that eternal glory come from wild, perhaps eternal versions of the other dstone jewelry could have been a bh reward, for a random example that fits with precedent without having a perception of hurting others' experience.
---
What about instead of a drop you get points and then you can decide what you want to spend your points in?
---
Oh wait

Nice one dude!! I always admire these capes when I see players with them. Awesome work :D

hey guys, i am the one who made this. i started doing laser cut stuff about a year ago and started from doing some super easy stuff to this.

about the work of takes : around 4 hours making the original interface and 3 hours to make it personalised for curtis (mmorpg).
---
all the lines you see are hand drawn from the screenshot of the moment before he  gets his ely. the chatbox took the most time to get all of the letters perfect

i also have my own version of this as a test project im going to post on reddit later this day 
---
i am not selling them yet and i will sell them in the future and take personal requests
---
for further questions feel free to ask!
---
Is the chaos (wilderness) altar even worth attempting as a prayer training method?  I've seen videos here and there mention and/or recommend it, and I've got a "maxed" setup for it (obelisk in POH + hard diary) but it just feels bad to me.  I realize it must be a "YMMV" type of thing, but I've done probably 50 inventories at that altar, spread across all hours of the day, and I don't think I completed a single one of them without encountering at least one pker, often more than one.  It fucks with the xp rate and cost savings pretty severely, and it's like the least AFK thing you can possibly do if you have to sit there with your eyes peeled to the minimap the whole time waiting for your 1-second opportunity to log when a dot appears.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure most people with any understanding of current affairs have known his name for a long time.
---
No
---
No idea why on earth you'd want that, the max you can have is 35 from a boss task, yet if Konar assigns you hydras normally its like 150+, why would you not want that?
---
Could have had 2 more or 6 less total level account ruined
---
The problem isn't the polls itself it's the staff not knowing how to repoll, or add clauses to pvp updates because they don't know how to fix it so they give up fast. They said they're going to try to look into more options and listen to the community.
---
Before hand if something failed they gave up and didn't really try to repoll it with some minor changes. If it was a pvm boss they would of put it through three iterations until everyone in the community was fine with it.
---
The 75% polls in this game is one of it's resounding features. Any kind of "fix" to the polls is just a happy sounding version of voter fraud.
---
Solid!!!
---
So all Wilderness Bosses drop tables are being nerfed then?
---
3256
---
The problem is that people (PvM boys) will go "I dOnT wAnT tO bE fOrCeD tO pVp To GeT tHeSe ReWaRdS". So yea, nothing exciting will ever be added as a PvP reward. While PvM will get cool shit like Tbow or Scythes.
---
I guess so. I was 3 emblems away from getting a rune pouch on my ironman and now I can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs literally zero reason to do wildy slayer now over normal slayer
---
3701
---
True, but how many people actually care about current affairs outside of their daily life and celebrity gossip?

&gt;3437
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I belive in you! And in RNGesus...
---
Don't put a dot, Reddit formatting ruins it
---
Larran's Keys in general need to be buffed to make up for Emblems being removed from the drop tables in Wilderness Slayer OR add just a generic 100k gp drop to the table (since that's what Emblems were basically).
---
If you do will be easier if you play on the fixed screen.
---
So I can't get more emblems from wildy slayer??? I was literally 2 emblems from a rune pouch. Fuck this update
---
Maybe op doesnt want the boss task lol.
---
4120
---
They haven't worked on it for the past year; only a few months really. And I wouldn't say the purpose of a rework is to get a bunch of new rewards but to improve the mechanics and gameplay. While it is a bit disappointing to see only one new reward, BH still does have a bunch of uniques and the new system should be more profitable.
---
Just play ironman if you hate this.
---
Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs in the backlog. ETA 1-7 years.
---
3824, good luck on the grind tho
---
Literally how most range/mage attacks work.
---
so is void range bis at zulrah right now or what? and for what kind of darts? i always see all sorts of conflicting info about this
---
I'm happy to see Wilderness updates!
---
May I ask if there are any plans to change the wildy bosses in regards to the safespotting? Especially venenatis.
---
Also: Can I still rush my wildy slayer emblems for rune pouch while the beta is running?
---
It‚Äôs not that difficult to have good cyber security practises, though. It‚Äôs not complicated after reading about it for 5-15 minutes to make sure you have a strong password and well protected email account. 
---
Honestly, what you‚Äôre saying is the equivalent to someone complaining that people should be friendlier and leave their front doors unlocked because the chance of being robbed it so slim.
---

---
Send that to me right now!
---
Isn‚Äôt there a reason the removed Nieve? Didn‚Äôt one the mods who was fired implement her after a real person?
---
If I had hell hounds unblocked? Then yeh I would be able to kill cerb for all of the task
---
&gt; Clearly the people actively engaging in PvP are not a majority, or else more PvP polls would pass.
---
Partly because Jagex has failed to update the wilderness/pvp for many years now. Take two seconds and consider what you're saying.
---
Read the blogpost dummy
---
Same here. Made a half-dozen attempts, got dunked on. Meanwhile this bot is out there crushing it apparently.
---
And why would you want to go there at such low level? Perhaps a bot?
---
50/50 odds doesn't mean you'll actually have a 50% winrate
---
/u/JagexGambit  /u/JagexSween   Was the price of the (cosmetic) Granite clamp meant to be 1000 points or 100 in the new BH shop?
---
Looks like the maul handle upgrade is 600....
---
Probably a botter
---
It took 3 years for this BH update? Besides the 1 reward, what exactly is different and took so long?
---
Try flipping heads 9 times in a row, that‚Äôs like a 1/2000 chance, so how is it so common to go on +5 loss streaks every other stake
---
You're right I don't need a BiS item on my ironman how silly of me.
---
Theres a sir pugger video where he interviews a guy making bots for cox...
---
Why don‚Äôt you get to know some players and donate something to them? I met a player just after I completed the tutorial island who asked me what I wanted to start in, combat-wise. When I said I‚Äôd go kill some goblins and cows before starting maging he gave me a full set of iron and sword, food and a bunch of runes. For him it wasn‚Äôt expensive but I‚Äôve always been super grateful that someone launched me into what I wanted to do and have since been able to pass that on to other new players. 
---
Random acts of kindness can change a person‚Äôs day. They have for me in the past. Why don‚Äôt you share the wealth that‚Äôs weighing on you and maybe making other players happy will help lift some of that for you?
---
Saw a post somewhere by a guy who bought 200m worth of T1s and is now fuming, lmao
---
Fucking finally, scale prices are through the roof
---
You should get around 150M old BH points if you trade the emblems in, which should get you about 70M cash according to the [BH store table](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bounty_Hunter_Store).

Ahhhh shit congrats. Im still petless

does it depend on lvl at all either? currently 91 range
---
That is true
---
Google ‚Äúasukayen zulrah‚Äù he‚Äôs made some awesome rotation pictures that face south (as they should! Fuck the north facing guides) and save all 4 into a folder then just have that folder open and scroll to the rotation you need once you figured it out. I‚Äôm a fucking idiot and it taught me it so you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem.
---
Ok I see that you're more of an encouraging optimist rather than elitist.
---
Take my older brother for example, the kid inexplicably gets lock wrist the moment he starts taking damage. He's played the game since he was 12 and is now 26, the only way he's ever been able to kill zulrah on his ironman is with the hiding strategy. He's tried learning the entire rotations, but he just doesn't have good game sense. He can't focus on more than three things at a time while clicking. He just freezes up lol. The hide method has been good for him as it's enabled him to get a bunch of items from Zulrah that he otherwise would be struggling to get. He would rather settle for longer, inefficient stress free kills than struggle to learn it entirely. He plays for entertainment.
---
I remembered like this. Assuming you‚Äôre facing south, (R)ange on the (R)ight.
---
Yeah definitely learn the jad phase. If you don't you'll take so much damage. Plus on the jad phase you're guaranteed no damage from zulrah if you change pray correctly, which is pretty easy.
---
Nice 99 defence btw
---
We'll re-balance and cost those prices before full launch. I can't imagine the handle will stay at 600. Thanks for the heads up!
---
There is stuff that 100% of pkers would agree on that didnt pass. There is a large portion voting no out of spite for pvp. Ive followed every pvp and so much shit doesn't pass that should, even if i personally dislike it. To say polling is fine is just a poor troll attempt lol.
---
Mate, it sort of comes across like you are spoiling for a fight here with anyone that disagrees with you here. No offence... 
---
Of course it‚Äôs possible the system can be abused. Real-life polls can potentially be abused e.g. for political elections. But the chances of it happening on a meaningful scale are usually relatively low.
---
I have to agree with the other guy that it‚Äôs a bit tin foil hat... Jagex at least has some data whereas you have none at all. If it was significant enough, I‚Äôm sure they would pick something up and think about how to deal with it. I could make up 100 theoretical conspiracy theories, but what‚Äôs the point..?
---
I‚Äôd rather go with Jagex than a totally speculative claim that‚Äôs probably biased.
---
They usually go 1/256 for a piece and then you get a random piece.
---
Ohhh well you‚Äôd still be a unique account being an Ironman.

Hey what's that skill with the shield icon you have 99 in???

I have no idea why autocorrect changed nugget to you know what
---
I think you still can, this is just a beta
---
YouTube helps better than reddit
---
If you don't see the problem with them, then you obviously don't understand the impact something like this would have on the game. As I said, in RS3 they are genuinely hated by most of the game, no one knows what gear anyone is wearing, it's hard to get team mates for high level pvm because they aren't visually wearing anything required to complete those tasks. On top of that, everything that comes with cosmetic overrides, is trashy and not fitting to the game.
---
They've been announcing this for weeks/months now so you had plenty of time, but besides it's only in a beta stage at the moment, so it doesn't affect normal worlds.
---
Just happy we have another set of magic robes with 0 defensive bonuses that require defense to wear. Yeah thematically relevant stats.
---
Found the guy who doesn‚Äôt know how to screenshot
---
Its not a bug, it's a deliberate action made to prevent botters from camping BH worlds. Looks like its working so far.

I'm not sure if this has been mentioned already or not but please make the new Mysterious Emblems Stackable while in the bank. I went and bought 10 of the tier 1 emblems and it took up 10 bank slots, unlike the old emblems.

You believe this will compensate for the lack of emblems though? Tier 40 mage gear that is ultra-rare and two minor upgrade scrolls?

Temporarily. Mods have said they'll all be swapped for points eventually so as not to end up with discontinued stuff.

You're not even going to try and come up with one other anti-bot update that has had a negative affect on the game for regular players. Not even one?
---
I've always wanted to see Nieve's tits on wood.

Fast + Safe is to use gilded altars in POHs, fast and risky is to use the chaos altar in the wildy.

Mate don't force yourself do do something you dint enjoy just for the sake of time invested. If you feel its time to throw in the towel, then throw it in. It sounds like you've had a very long Runescape career and an accomplished one at that. 
---
Even if they released content tomorrow, youd most likely be burned on it in a couple months back to the same spot you're at now. I think it's time.
---
Some of us have perspective and genuinely appreciate what you and the other devs do. Please don't let whiny posts like this get to you, they do not represent everyone. Far from it.

Percy after just letting you use a ladder where you can mine more of the same shit for 100 gold nuggets
---
Bonds rising in price could also be a result of pvm being so forgiving. If you die in maxed gear to a goblin, you van loot all of your items back and continue killing goblins for their drops and profit. Not many people go to the only place where you can actually lose bank value (wild/staking) so saying botting is the only problem, is not accurate.
---
Never miss an opportunity to shit on the people that develop the game you love. An inherent part of gaming is bugs and glitches that have to be sorted out. Please stop bitching at every little opportunity you can find just for the karma. thanks.

Sometime around winter of 2017

Very small drop %rate, and excessive farming. With onyxia you can only do it once a week and can take extremely long times.

300 is a lot for any low level pk acc. Like 70 str 50 range 60 hp is only half way to 300. I personally dont care about the total level or bh. Its dead and will remain dead after the rework. I care about the constant slapping total level reqs on everything. If you think only a cheesy level 30 build is the only acc to not have 300 total and 35 hours you have clearly have very little time in bh.
---
Best option is to just leave the store in permanently so you‚Äôre not stealing wealth from players that are on a break for whatever reason.
---
Nice hopefully this helps the pvp scene come back.

Any hint on when group iron will be out (soon or not soon lol?) Thats what my friends want haha.

L0l dude fuck off. I said dobt reply. Ill talk to everyone else here but your done. Ill try find a way to block you.

Seriously? Have you visited the wise old man lately to clear your bank of useless items?
---
Damn, Nice work!

Keep it up!

Wiki says world 330 usually has open altars in houses. How might I find this?

Holy shit this is good

Awesome, you can still receive an emblem from Wildy slayer?

What are your brilliant ideas to fix the pvp system? If you have time to post a pointlessly bitchy post, im sure you've come up with some groundbreaking concepts yourself?
---
Hopping on the hate train for karma. SMDH
---
Nice try acting like you don't know the issue so you could bash me, it is known that whatever mode you are playing the bank is too small, im not gonna argue with you anymore.
---
You were able to yesterday so I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôd still be able to
---
Its +2 max hit and +2 accuracy +8/+8 isnt a real upgrade in the grand scheme of things
---
Take my upvote, just don't bleed on me.
---
I mean the design with the hair and all.
---
I was not sure with the update today.
---
They're incredibly toxic. It's sad too. When they go on huge losing streaks, they make up stories like Jagex shadow banning them instead of just understanding that's part of gambling.

Put ur FPS down

He doesnt have a response, his response is to block people on reddit.

This is seriously incredible, one of the coolest pieces of art I've seen in this sub and that's seriously saying something, so many great artists on this sub in particular for some reason.

So I've never heard of laser cutting. From what I gather reading the comments, you fashion a 3D model on some program of the shape you want the wood to take, and then on that shape (but still on the program) you hand-draw the rest of the lines, and then a machine cuts everything into a block of wood for the finished product?
---
No in fact, many of us don‚Äôt cheat
---
That would be an interesting concept of a ranking system. I quite like the idea of it.

Breoca doesn't drop iron arrows, may i suggest [Gunthor the brave](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Gunthor_the_brave)

Larran‚Äôs keys are better loot than Konar‚Äôs - and that‚Äôs before the addition of Dagon‚Äôhai robes.
---
Plus it‚Äôs the best way to farm slayer points in the game. 
---
I would say that Larran‚Äôs keys could drop more often, as they felt as if they were more rare than emblems. Hopefully they‚Äôll make the keys slightly more common with the removal of emblems.
---
So we get a warning for playing a couple hours but people can go get addicted to the sand casino and dump all their irl money into bonds.. do think anything in that report could force jagex to do something about the duel arena? Even if just a warning or helpline info. Way to many friends have quit and lost irl money over the years to that place.
---
This made me laugh a little too hard
---
Maybe if you didn't scam people and get yourself kicked from most PVM activities you'd still enjoy the game.
---
It is a scam
---
They try to convince you what what they are selling is worth more than it actually is
---
Whatcha mean? You go to the beta world, grab some gear and waltz into the wild and find a fight/target.
---
Has anyone experienced anything similar to this in nmz before:
---
I was heading out and fully prepared to die in nmz but I absorbed up anyway thinking I would at least get 20min worth of xp, I get back 30 mins later and I'm still alive with 31 hp and ~300 absorbs, nothing was attacking me and once I started rockcaking down all the npcs resumed aggression.
---
This has happened to me a couple of times and I've wondered the cause of it.
---
Keep going, it's only in beta. Get the cunt done.
---
It‚Äôs hard to tell how well this will work, especially with there being no mention of rewards (the main incentive to do an activity). As a PvP lover, there needs to be a pill in place that is separate from the split community. Why are PvMers allowed to manipulate polls that pertain to an entirely different community? 
---
I‚Äôm going to get some hate here, but Ironman get content catered to them all the time. Why are pkers so overlooked? Yes there is the classic stereotypes, however PvP has needed an overhaul for years. You spend more on supplies then what kills are currently worth, the learning curve is still huge (lms needs combat bracket tiers and perhaps a normal pking mode, such as veng pking). The PvP community is so overlooked on content updates, and I really hope this BH rework isn‚Äôt taken lightly and is seriously considered.

For new players it is

Why can‚Äôt Zulrah be locked behind slayer?

Guy asked me if he could buy my gear. Asked him why he isn't going to the GE. Said he was recording a video, told me was going to pay extra. 2 dose devine supee strenght pots is only worth 2,990,000 on GE. Not 7,5mil. Then trying to flex his cashstack of 690mil trying to convince me why he would do that if he had so much money.
---
I‚Äôve been doing wildly slayer like crazy lately trying to unlock the tune pouch on my ironman before this. I‚Äôm 19 out of 24 emblems needed.

Am I fucked now?

Do one of the "we pay to pk" protest from 2007

I used Konar until level 62 Slayer (I find Wyrm tasks long and annoying). I use Duradel now and Konar on every 10th task for extra points. If you are into bosses you can mix things up with Duradel like killing KBD on a Black Dragon task or Vorkath on a Blue Dragon task, which is something that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do with Konar. In general because of the freedom of choice and variety with Duradel I can find myself doing Slayer for longer periods of time before I start to get bored, whereas with Konar I think you will start to feel monotony much earlier.
---
burst or barrage your def if u plan on slaying. its pointless to train it with melee
---
Do you have Mortania hard diaries done for the extra runes? That‚Äôs a bit factor in consistently earning gp. Do you wear full prayer gear while praying? The brothers have negative mage defence so magic attack bonus is not needed
---
I'm pretty sure that's not for quest items? But either way no, I just checked it's not there. I tried to talk to Lord Iorwerth again and he won't give me another pendant either... Might not be "important" for another quest, but I'm actually making a quest cosmetics collection and I was almost done... :/
---
Killing gargoyles means you arent a "new" player.
---
You make literally zero sense. Looting bags don‚Äôt even help relatively. You can still only get one kill and they don‚Äôt even allow for multiple trips. Keys are a great incentive to continuously stay in the wilderness, also to get rid of bots too. Stacking five key from green dragon bots for example.

Yeah but why would i kill 128 to know i'm not at drop rate when i can kill 1/9th as many? Sample sizes have no place in my salt mine
---
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted. People clearly don‚Äôt understand the mechanics of PvP. The loot keys would have been the single greatest update for PvP and was failed because of bias. Would have ended the day of rushers and looters alike

Shitting on a guy because he makes a picture thats perfectly clear, and i'm the loser?
---
So osrs is an rpg and people can play it however they want. But why are you leveling up defense first? Either train all 3 at once or do str-&gt;att-&gt;def will save you so so so so much time.

Yeah, if u think tht picture is clear lol

He sells up to steel, but you can buy a mith battleaxe

Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, don‚Äôt you lose it past 30+ wild and drop as a black mask for the pker?
---
it is worth it. it's what i still do.
---
I absolutely want this. I know nobody wants anymore teleports (even though they'd all be great additions to my unlimited teleport collection), but I'm all for more hotspots/rooms to store and display stuff. I suggested, and was addressed, on stream to be able to display chompy bird hunting hats, so perhaps that could be squeezed in somewhere, or maybe in one of the empty corners of the skill hall as I originally suggested.
---
Using a dharok's axe and body without the helm and legs means you are
---
you using runelite's gpu rendering? seeing this is giving me flashbacks to when my graphics card was about to shit the bed
---
No, they said the main client update is in "a few weeks" and considering most tasks give out 1.5 emblems i'd say you are completely fine.
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain you don‚Äôt need another player to complete the quest anymore.
---
It‚Äôs only bad for the player that loses the stake. Sorry, but I‚Äôve never heard anyone complain about winning. 
---
2 good things happen:
---
&gt; 1) money leaves the game via tax. 
---
&gt; 2) 1 player is wealthier than they were before the stake
---
1 bad thing happens:
---
&gt; 1) 1 player is less wealthier after the stake
---
2:1 ratio, I‚Äôd say the duel arena is doing more good than harm.
---
no thieving is not a afk skill. spamming a mouse is not afk.
---
Damn üòû
---
They are selling for less than 3k each. Even though GE says they are over 7k. This is a player taking advantage of that knowing full well that they aren't worth it. That's called a scam.
---
Not 100% of the time. If slayer helm is one of the top 3 (4 with prot. Item) expensive items, you won't ever lose it. Check your items lost on death screen to see what items are protected. And another wilderness tip, put your player attack options to either 'right click' or 'hidden' to avoid getting skulled.
---
Can you fix the PJ timer people, this is actually unplayable right now :/ also the points per kill system feels really unrewarding
---
exact same thing happened to me and I'm salty af
---
Sure, but kicking people will accomplish nothing in this case
---
I feel like this is a bruh moment for everyone
---
Hope you have some better luck on that connection on the next attempt if you didn't already do it! RIP on the friends man. I have one IRL friend left that plays OSRS, but unfortunately he plays IM and I do not.
---
Also shameless plug, if any ironmen are looking for a great CC join 07Irons we got a really solid crew and enough people where always people online (~180 members atm) but not so many you will be lost in the mix.

And is this is a subreddit for photography or was his only meaning to show that he got the pet? And no, not everyone spends as much time on their screens as you do. Some people actually dont care about the most efficient way to share pictures

I'm a bit out of the loop so maybe I missed it, but why is there a need to revamp the Mysterious Emblems? Why make these new Archaic Emblems and what do they do that the Mysterious Emblems couldn't do?
---
&gt; perhaps that could be squeezed in somewhere
---
Probably in place of the defenders seeing as there's no need to keep that many defenders.
---
Also this certainly isn't QoL. This is a mid to large size update.

It's a new take on the Jaw grind. Grinding a single mob type in a big room didn't feel right for a best in slot upgrade.

Only if they have a squat animation.

Dude either way it's a substantial amount of time and effort for a digital item. Thank you for breaking it down for me to prove me someway shape or form wrong.

I kinda don't count them since they're primarily group content but at the same time they're definitely harder than zulrah haha.

What if the entire thread is him, including me

If your bank is full and you aren't 200m all you're doing something wrong

I hope RuneLite allows us to filter those reminders away üòé

Is most easy code this than try code every interaction in the house who can give any advantage to the IM. (Maybe you think that is easy, but remember that the osrs code is a huge spaghetti)
---
Seeing as how the looting bag has become a detrimental item for UIM accounts. Would anyone be opposed to making the looting bag a guaranteed drop after a certain amount of kills, say 1/25 for any monster in the wild? And if the poll passes that allows for multiple bags to be owned, the drop rate would increase, similar to ecumenical keys. (Purely for mains, as UIM would not have access to multiple bags.) 
---
I'm purely asking because the driest I've ever been in getting a looting bag was about 150ish kills. Would help in my opinion.
---
I get fishing and woodcutting xp now
---
If it happens and you lose a defender you need the previous one to get it again, this forces you to keep some of the defenders..
---

---
Anything that is changed to increase activity in the wild should be targeted at increasing PVP activity in the wild, not luring mains/skillers/PVMers into the wild to be prey.
---
So they can‚Äôt benefit off guided altar/teles and basically everything else

Drain rates are on the Wiki here: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prayer#Prayers](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prayer#Prayers)

---
The whole idea of Runecrafting and Ashihama seems like a fundamental waste of dev time to me. There is no new RCing META tied to it, so it's essentially dead content pre-release unless there is some sort of truly genuinely useful rewards tied to it. Why bother spending the resources to put it in the game?
---
On yesterday's Q&amp;A they said the idea was to break up the normal routine without altering xp rates. Jagex may have willfully ignored player sentiment, but no one cares about that. The skill is nearly universally hated because of its training rates, and the multiple billions of GP required if you wanted to 99 with runners instead.
---
If they just want to break up the routine, they need to also at least make it fun to do. Why add another eye-glazing, brain damaging slog of a grind to a skill that needs a complete rework in the first place?
---
The smoke staff shouldn't out DPS it since it has a 15% damage boost
---
That's  better excuse than what I've got. I've had 99 construction banked for like a month now, I just can't be bothered to go and actually train it.
---
Is it not a deironable offense? If not it should be
---
kbd pet kc?
---
Yes, but the drop table uses 128 as the base.
---
I already felt my gp/hr go down after the T10 update. Went from a guaranteed 175k-350k per task to around 80k. The larrans keys are way too RNG based, anywhere from 10k worth of pure essence to 600k in dragonfruit seeds. Wildy slayer is dead content for anything other than points now and honestly that doesn‚Äôt motivate me to risk being pked when I can get 1m+ from risk free from normal slayer.
---
what if george costanza plays runescape
---
I don't. I just said the other guy's idea served more purpose than a defender storage which I stand behind.
---
Go sit in the waiting for mentor channel in the we do raids discord and mute your mic. Literally requires 0 talking to do the raid.
---
Also maybe socialize yourself a little more so it‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
Thanks!
---
they don't anymore, but okay
---
Just remember kids, if they're selling it to you as a quick flip instead of flipping it themselves, they're lying
---
Even after the update?
---
That's gonna be huge then. These robes will definitely be worth a lot. Not only fashionscape but also high risk pking
---
No lol
---
Just clean out your bank. UIMs already have storage.
---
Excuse my noobiness, but I thought if any damage is done to a monster ironmen will not receive the drop, so how can clans spec corp down and an ironman still gets the drop?
---
That's the first thing that I did. Wikis didn't help me, that's why i'm asking here in reddit, I really can't find the Captain.

No, by reminding you that you're doing that to yourself.

I'm pretty sure that a "take a break" message is required by law in some Asian countries like South Korea. I wonder if them adding it is to help push more into the asian market.

Not to mention my OSRS Username has never been my OG login from the day you could change your username in game. Not even my closest friends know my OG login. Because realistically the people who could hack you the easiest are people who know you.

I got my via misclick in the farming guild. Made my week.

Lol I had some guy try and tell me he was doing me a favor doing the same thing except it was divine super defense. Lmao as if anyone even wants regular super defenses. He said, ‚ÄúI like doing people favors.‚Äù
---
How can assholes like that feel good about what they‚Äôre doing? If I scammed someone like that I‚Äôd feel like a piece of shit (because that‚Äôs what you are if you do something like this).
---
You only get banned for selling big amounts. Sell 400m 3 times in 1 day = banner. They don‚Äôt even care that your buying. If it wasn‚Äôt for RWT there would be so few people playing this game lol.
---
And you won‚Äôt be getting any emblems from slayer anymore unless of course they decide to make a change
---
These are the f2p skills
---
All the "they made blank in real life" posts are jokes.
---
No it just means you kill people in the Wilderness for their spades.
---
It's a cc for finishing a quest lol
---
What I dont understand is the need the change it for all worlds while ALSO having a beta world.
---
That‚Äôs some chunky defence
---
Wouldn't hurt at this point
---
It's more or less meant to be a "fix" on how boring obtaining the BiS helm upgrade is.
---
Everyone is arguing just how difficult the "level 60 slayer mob" should be, but I think grinding mobs mindlessly in a single room is quite boring compared to how more dynamic other strong item grinds are.
---
Outside of designing the area, it isn't actually that much more content. The only stuff that needs adding/ balancing is Basilisk Squires, Drones (eyes) and the balancing of the chest rewards.
---
You can just use the actual game options at the duel arena
---
You dont have to exclusively 50/50 stake at the duel arena
---
Good point, but death matching is just rng, Once we both are out of spec it‚Äôs just whip till someone dies, on a side note I didn‚Äôt think imp boxing still worked like that, if you read the wiki it says imp in a box will refuse to bank in pvp world then it contradicts itself by saying ‚Äúa player is able to bank in pvp areas as long as not in combat‚Äù
---
It's honestly a matter of preference for you. I find it easier to navigate the Spirit Tree interface than the Jewelry Box one so that was my choice. Brimhaven is really the most important one and you already have that. Port Sarim is another popular one but I go there so rarely that it's easier for my to just tele and run from Draynor. I am not a fan of the Etceteria teleport because I find the Miscellania tele from the Jewelry Box better.

Balkanization is the breaking up of a country due to ethnic groups that are long standing and feuding. This is just a revolution to fight for democracy

Cute
---
Poh meta is already something the mods don't like, and want to avoid any more additions too.
---
I just don't like when people whine for more more bank space when they have all tier 40 weapons and armor, plus every quest item clogging up their bank. I have a pretty messy bank and I still have 200 spaces free.
---
Ur close to having the bond, you can make the rest of the money in like 30 minutes. Go steal zammy wines or sell jewelry to the jewelry store or something...

Same with the crystal pick using it for guardians in raids
---
There's so many good series youtubers just drop. 
---
Lazy fucks
---
Crazy how this is like the one game where people feel like they own dev time and should be in charge of dev schedules
---
I thought the arm was a Cheeto.
---
do you use templates to burn all this? or is it free hand?
---
Annnd you dont want to answer because you have placeholders for 1 dose defense mix and stacks of every teleport tab as well as the 1k iron bars you made smithing earlygame
---
Fair enough
---
I've been playing since release and have over 2k total and I only hit bank space cap once. 
---
Release your useless bank tabs and stop hording items.
---
Never used Placeholders, don't like the fact that it says i have something when i don't. thats my answer.
---
The reason is because i dont want jagex to spend their dev time on letting you keep 8 unfinished guam potions in your bank
---
Could you make it so that you keep the setup u die with? Takes ages to regear
---
Longer trips though, no?
---
I remember when I was 10 Years old (15 years ago) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I used to play in the local library a lot. And a friend of mine saw I had a rune pickaxe. He axed me to borrow it.
---
You can guess I never saw it back :'( Still have mixed feelings about that dude till this day!
---
I think it makes sense to increase it considerably at this point. Look how many items have been added since its last update. It would be nice if jagex could fix the bank issue. I‚Äôd prefer that over more secondary storage but I doubt that‚Äôll happen anytime soon so I‚Äôd be ok with more secondary storage
---
That is very true. I misclick the jewelry box teleports fairly often on mobile but never on the trees. Thanks!
---
I see, thanks for the explanation. It's a bit too bad because I always liked the Mysterious Emblems thematically. Makes me wish they would still be a part of the game somehow though.
---
Just came back recently after almost a year, still catching up.. Any solid YouTube video? Or just follow the wiki
---
You can use the chat to find a partner it‚Äôs under the mini game tab same place as the mini games teleports
---
Your mum
---
Nice job, man! Hit me up if you want to join a high total pure cc, we mostly skill and chat. :)
---
Could you reenact World 2 falador park back in 2005-6? That would be amazing
---
Ez getting carried
---
And people wonder why PvP updates get hate voted in polls.
---
Make sure you use oldschool.runescape.wiki the fandom one is garbage
---
It's the exact same, u do it at the fire altar with a water talisman.  Or if you're a main you use magic imbue and water runes instead of earth runes.  10 xp/rune instead of 10.5.
---
You can also do mud runes with balloon for much more profit but slower xp.  Also 10 xp/rune.  2 years ago lumberyard scrolls were 7k ea and it was profitable and better xp to lavas because the trip is actually shorter with those than duel ring @ fire.
---
Mind rcing is also decent for pures with the tele.
---
*The Bankstand*
---
If you're taking them to the fire altar it's the same trip as lavas, you just make different runes.
---
Yeah there is no way in hell I would go up into that thing
---
You can just... Use the duel arena for its intended purpose. It doesn't have to be dds/whip. 
---
Yeah, you lose 1% of the winnings, but it prevents this sort of thing.
---
yes?
---
oh, I'm sorry, misunderstood that you wanted a more KO based fight than an outlast fight.
---
6061 kc, holy shit he really pounded that out. his streams must have been nonstop corp for months
---
Yall really shittin on wildly slayer
---
That's why they implemented POH Storage, Tool Leprechauns, Stash Units... What's your point. 
---
Jamflex has also said that increasing bank storage is a huge undertaking that would totally re-develop the system they have. While yes, its an issue to *Some* players, it is not an issue for all players. If there was a majority of players at the max, then maybe they would look into it... but by the sounds of it, it is you and a select few others.
---
They could create an npc called oculus. Hidden somewhere no one will find him without activiely trying to find him. He also only has the chat option for the oculus if you carry a molten glas and one air rune. That way, only players actively trying to get the oculus will look him up on the wiki and go there. No noobs buying it from diango and thinking "what kind of buggy mess is this game" that way.
---
The absolute audacity of PvP rewards being offered via PvP activities. What was jamflex thinking?
---
Yeah for example my ags gmaul could hit 0-0 and his could hit a 70-30 I could survive but that high damage alone would pretty much set him up for a win
---
And you‚Äôre the one with the authority to make that determination between addiction and ‚Äòlack of responsibility‚Äô?
---
&gt;That's why they implemented POH Storage, Tool Leprechauns, Stash Units... What's your point. 
---
If they implemented these, why is it an issue they implement more similar methods?
---
Already in pure crew ;)
---
wait for seers with diary. it makes agility somewhat doable
---
Have you logged in to runelite?
---
Far be it from other players to suggest a change to really poorly designed content.
---
You're right, apologies your highness.
---
At least we got the robes
---
yes
---
Well it does and it doesn't. You can move 2 squares diagonally or straight forward, but moving diagonally the distance is ~1.4x further so it looks like you're moving faster, especially if you spam back and forth like this
---
Would be a great way for clans to war, cant teleporf away.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs an individual roll based on points.
---
The revamp is to fight emblem farmers generating billions of gp. In the new system, two players have to buy an emblem worth x gp. When one dies, the winner's emblem is upgraded to be worth x*2 gp. That makes it a zero-sum system that can't be gamed by one person playing as both the winner and loser.
---
What machine did you use to cut this?
---
Good point tbh I feel like a lot of people just look past this and assume everyone will easily grasp the differences in pking styles, what you should and shouldn‚Äôt do etc
---
a trotec
---
Because the fact that you openly refuseand choose to go through more steps to post an image, (a poor quality one at that), either shows that you aren't too bright a bulb, or you genuinely don't know how to do so. This is the most computer literate age, and you're telling me the button which literally says prntsc is too hard to press? Or even if youre adamantly opposed to ulsuch an easy method, use the snipping tool in ever version of windows 10. You only make yourself out to be stupid posting phone pictures of a computer screen....
---
I don't know, I always felt like afking in a room for a rare drop for me is the RS experience. But maybe a secondary option to get it would be ok.
---
You bring 8 brews and 3 restores and a  snaf serum and with some anti mage gear youll be ok.
---
That‚Äôs would be dead content on release. 70 str is not a lot.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I do, but then again you think those will drop for me? :(
---
Do you even chop, bro?
---
Should have just done Tears of Guthix!  /s
---
I stopped doing them as I haven't gotten the assignment since the buff, isn't crush weapons like the Cudgel already one of the better options for fighting them and having decent accuracy? Would you theoretically *only* need the cudgel to fight and keep them at low stats?
---
super cool idea, but i feel like this is so dope it warrants its own rewards. maybe along side the jaw, dunno
---
lol. This video is hilarious. Love it!
---
It's a suggestion, not a command. 
---
The old school dev team has welcomed player input since it's release in 2013. Almost as if things were put to a vote....like in a poll of some kind?
---
Brilliant comment my dude, truly.
---
To the top you bastard!
---
This is a masterpiece
---
Only time I've had swordfish it was fairly bland and overly meaty for a fish 2/10. Shrimps are delicious and should heal more.
---
I can‚Äôt work out if that is a wooden shed or a bed.
---
It works in certain contexts. I'd say Cave Horror is the closest Basilisks could be compared to.
---
But an iconic piece of kit such as the Neitznot helm getting an upgrade through the "kill hundreds of these mobs on task" method feels a bit lame.
---
Dunno- feels weirder than the Dragon Warhammer grind, cause with that you at least have to be active. Right now the buggers are both unrewarding but also not engaging. I think something that extracts more from the theme of these creatures gives the whole "package" a stronger identity. Something a LOT of new OSRS content lacks.
---
I‚Äôve watched amneity for like 2 years consistently smite people because of the shit pj timer in bh. Please go watch a video of his. He uploads everyday on YouTube and you can see how shit the pj timer is. Rewards suck in my opinion. And also multi should be fucking removed from bounty. Be the dream to brid fight anywhere in the wilderness. Majority people in bh are luring or in multi. Seriously 24 fucking 7, kids be in multi. Teleport to target theres no point because no one 1vs1 in bounty world. There‚Äôs only edgeville fights.
---
Barrows
---
I prefer the relekka course post 80. Feels much more relaxed to me
---
oooooof
---
ye ok im 67 pls stop flexing m8
---
4k from 90 slayer for the hydra kill, then start 82-&gt;85 WC to boost to chop down a redwood.
---
Side note, does anyone know if 90 seconds from boosting to 90 in your POH then teleporting to the wc guild + running to redwoods would give you enough time to get 1 set of logs, or would it be very RNG based?
---
Which program do you use for this?
---
Even worse, 10k Kraken kills and no pet.
---
Probably nothing like what OP is eating. ü§¢
---
Pls don‚Äôt add rune pouch to MTA unless you completely rework that horrible minigame
---
Also this would force mage exp increases - some people want to get minimum xp on their pk account
---
As of now, I'm very unsure/concerned1
---
Thanks to your advice, I went from 3-4 doses to 1 every two runs as you said. Thanks so much!
---
Thanks, mom
---
&gt;Kill two targets without leaving, or going below level 1 Wilderness
---
&gt;Kill your target using Ranged/Melee/Magic on the last hit
---
&gt;Kill your target while risking 250,000 GP (in coins/platinum tokens only)
---
&gt;Kill your target without using any prayers
---
&gt;Kill your target without using a special attack
---
&gt;Kill your target without using Protect Item
---
&gt;Kill your target without any stat boosts
---
Unless you have low level pure most of those bounty tasks are not realistic or fun and will just boost the success of anyone botting/selling target kills. Honestly the only good one is the cash risk, they should just scrap the task system and give fixed bonus points for risking certain amounts of cash up to a very high limit like 10m+ gets you a ton of bonus points. I'd say that multiple kills without leaving the wildy could be part of that too, except it's dead easy to abuse with an alt restocking supplies, so I say scrap that one too.
---
Kill your opponent with a stab/crush/slash weapon- would this be possible to replace some of the existing tasks? You mentioned specific equipment but what about groups of equipment?
---
gz keep doing it.
---
Everyone should have 1 main and 1 pure. The main for main pking / staking / pvm. The pure is strictly for pking because there are specialized pures such as a Gmaul pure who will have only 50 attack no higher. A ranged pure who has 1 attack but 99 range. These "pures" are built for the sole reason of pking others at another stat build relevant to theirs basically pures cb lvl for the different specialty will have stat caps to keep the levels within pking range.
---
He has to make the file once, then he can just let his cnc machine go to town. Might still be over 50 though.
---
It‚Äôs embarrassing that you thought this was worth posting tbh
---
Only if add Rocky to my account
---
I genuinely have no idea what the average age is in this sub/game anymore. I guess at first I figured it would be dudes in their mid 20s, but more and more I feel like it's people who were probably a bit too young to play in 2006/2007 who are 17 or 18 or so now.
---
Did you file already?? I haven't gotten my forms yet.
---
Yeah, auto-clicking is a perm ban. Completely comparable to botting. You're account is training without you even there. Sit.
---
TLDR i broke the rules got punished now im crying pls help
---
Get the fuck out dude
---
Id love to have this in my poh
---
you are truly an ironman
---
It's all over, but the concentration is probably 30% young kids that don't use social media much yet, spanning up to 60% mid 20s, early 30s and falling off as it goes up. Most over 35 exclusively play DOOM on a DOS machine they've had and never upgraded once since 1988.
---
This is wild.
---
Nonmembers?
---
Lol you don't use afk methods and then stare at your character. The whole point is that you can watch youtube or netflix
---
better odds of getting the Armadyl Helm or Bandos boots from the elite clue guardians than getting human help for your acc

Yeah I wonder how many get put on hold for "sorry guys gotta go for maxed all skills in the twisted league!"

I remember getting an adrenaline rush when I stood on top of someone's rune axe head hoping they wouldn't find it and then taking it LOL
---
Sold it for a clean 20k in 2006.
---
It‚Äôs like 15 molch pearls an hour. So that‚Äôs ~666 hours just to get it lol
---
Exactly! People go crazy when I tell them fishing is my most hated skill.
---
With the BH beta live, what is my best way of obtaining a Rune Pouch as of right now? With emblems being untradeable, I can't indirectly buy a rune pouch from the shop by buying emblems, so my only options is to PvP (which I don't) or to spend 1250 Slayer Points, which wasn't worth doing when the pouches were indirectly purchasable for ~2.2m. Are they going to make them tradeable now? If not this completely fucks over those who didn't get the chance to indirectly buy a Rune Pouch prior to the update... I'd much rather spend 2m+ gp for a useful PvM item than to grind several hours of Slayer or deal with PvP.
---
3,750
---
I always did wildly slayer tasks for the slayer points so this doesn't change anything for me
---
Agreed, RCB is usually garbage. But MSB with rune arrows is also 0 dps against kurasks (broad arrows are untradable, which is annoying) and the extra range on the RCB is useful for safespotting wyverns either on the ground floor or in that slayer-only area safespot
---
Someone photoshop the spider web in front of him.
---
I_dont_do@buttstuff.net / Idobuttstuff69
---
I need to get members again
---
So when an item comes out that is BiS and devalues one of the items you have, does that not take ''literal wealth" from you...? REGARDLESS if you were there for the update or not? I see nothing different.
---
I do too. It's too slow. I've acclimated myself to quickly doing lavas and now bloods feel boring and slow
---
Having items removed from your account =/= an item losing value because of the economy. Nice false equivalency.
---
F in the chat for wildy slayer boys
---
I would if I could brother hahaha.
---
so lit
---
Uhm They were nice for the cost of cannonballs smh dead wildy slayer
---
This is why you check invents before the fight
---
Thanks for the advice. I know sand crabs are quite similar to ammonite crabs so I was hoping to stray away from crabs. I was hoping to get some AFK XP bonus at work tonight.my issue with steamed crabs and ammonite crabs as it's almost always packed with people doing the same thing.
---
Needs to be a "Male but female in game" option
---
You can get different results using the same seed. Not that this is legit or anything but you don't need to input a new seed for every psuedo rng roll.
---
One of the NPCs who runs the charter ships.
---
Not that it matters, the gambling bots are legitimately scamming. Any bets over a certain amount will always lose, and most of the bots are set to only let players win 25% of the time or less regardless of their "roll 55 or higher out of 100 to win" shouts.
---
3817
---
It‚Äôs a very useful utility item, honestly it should be a pain in the ass to get and making it effectively buyable with emblems was super lame.
---
Wait till you find Alice in Sunderland
---
If they could just implement that on vanilla then there wouldn't have to many any talk of putting in some private servery negative xp lamps. Seems like the most obvious thing to do to remedy the problem for the future
---
How convenient is this as opposed to just running  back?
---
something*
---
Looks like a dick dude
---
Yeah they're perfect old school content: improve the game without visually bloating stuff. It's like it filled a hole that was there, rather than just piling stuff on top.
---
Clicking Camelot teleport saves like 30-40% Of the run?
---
This looks like an early 2000s newgrounds game
---
They can be programmed to make you think that they love you
---
I never understood this line of reasoning. Even IF you dont have bank space problems, whats the harm in adding a room where you can display/store gear? It would make sense if you WANTED limited bank storage as a challenge of sorts, but whats the problem if you dont want limited storage? All it does is move your stuff from the bank to your house.
---
I appreciate the effort gone in to this idea but.. anyone having issues with bank space needs to get off their asses, grab themselves a quest cape, do some diaries, build stash units etc. There is plenty of space for everything as is.
---
Shutup noob you got it on 7kc lol wadda fail
---
That‚Äôs why you play a real video game on console while afk skilling on osrs Mobile
---
PvP bad slayer man good =) upboats to the left, gentlelads =)
---
Yes loot chests like everything else
---
I'd vote yes to the defender rack in a heartbeat - I've come up with that idea myself. Everything else just feels a little excessive. PoH is already really overpowered.
---
But... they're doing the equivalent of giving you the points back to use towards something else. Not just deleting your items. 
---
In your analogy that's like losing 99 runecrafting, but they automatically give you a lamp worth 13 million exp.
---
Though, pointless to think of more if they wont consider the base idea.
---
XTRA XTRA XTRA XTRA damn
---
I mean I agree that bots are bad
---
But they've been in the game for 20 years and they always will be
---
everything is fine
---
OK that's neat. How hard is it to get the tasks done. My skills are mostly 1s
---
petition to ban OP
---
Boots and shield are different.. one has trimmed glory :P
---
If you want it you can have it I guess. Just my two cents: it will be pretty boring. It might be a waste of money though so that is why they wouldn't do it.
---
Endgame would be:
---
\-Abby demons (for whip, bis)
---
\-Dks for rings
---
\-Kq for d chain
---
\-wyverns for d legs/skirt
---
\-kbd for kicks?
---
\-Barrows for basically everything lol
---
So after a year I think everyone would be pretty bored and ready for some updates.
---
Neither did we but this game mode has made for some excellent mental gymnastics on new drops tables, quirky training methods and exploration of the old spaghetti code in this game.
---
Still a lot of fun to learn these things.
---
Slayer helm if ur on task, are you not on task?
---
Yeah, when you get to doing OSF now you're prepared for a bad time. There's some other quests that are a pain
---
"Can I just trade you my Spade?  I don't wanna run all the way back out here"
---
Thank you mate xD &lt;3 spend a lot of time putting this together so it‚Äôs nice to get some cheeky positive feedback ;)
---
You can exchange them for a graceful outfit, very good for running around in.

PoH needs to have all of this in a basement so I can play runescape in my mom's basement while playing in my basement in runescape.
---
FALADOR MASSACRE WOODWORK!
---
To be fair, eliminating my own bias, there are hundreds of incredibly bad ideas nonstop
---
Let me know if you find a way/ have any suggestions!
---
You have to cash them in for points and buy rewards with the money, that's the only way you'll see any of the cash back.
---
theres a pretty cool Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated episode on baba yaga and this house.
---
for some reason I thought it was fictional, but that series does take a few folk-lore monsters into consideration.
---
Have you ever seen him poop?
---
Make that 5
---
450 kc no zenny. (I heard complaining on reddit helps)
---
Glad I already got my rune pouch on my ironman. Fuck grinding slayer points.. emblems were super quick
---
Spin them into bow strings, then you can have a huge bow string collection.
---
I wanna see them fat slayer streak point drops though
---
Im only level 73 slayer, but im happy to say ive not broken a streak yet
---
Got it on 1kc I win you prick
---
Yikes
---
I did the same with a pickaxe.... We're all a bunch of greedy noobs that are focused on gpscape, efficiencyscape and capescape.
---
Well obsidian armor is from the Tzhaar, but yeah tekton  does seem similar.
---
Not true for mahogany tables. They‚Äôre way too expensive to make the money back in the time you save. Unless you can somehow consistently make like 5-6m/h.
---
I think the people watching the QA are the more invested types who can think about the health and integrity of the game as opposed to your casual player who won't see anything besides the poll is live notification in-game and voting.
---
"Why would I want it to cost me more?"
---
Enable warning on untradeable items till next time :c
---
1 emblem gets me 50k points.. and the best point/coin I‚Äôve seen is that magic short bow scroll which is 100k points and sells for less than 50k gp
---
100 bots running for two weeks
---
Was about to say that, this is fake...
---
Reading the RS3 wiki quest series and what happens in them always makes me sad for all the quest content that was released as just cool little quests I'll never experience
---
Pc?
---
It‚Äôs actually kind of laughable how pvp is the only item sink outside of the sand casino tax really.
---
For some reason every other aspect of the game floods  billions of GP into the game daily but god forbid we get some decent loot, mr I like to click vorkath pvmer who runs in circles can‚Äôt have his overpowered drop table be competed with.
---
It‚Äôs a joke and it‚Äôs the reason pvp is dead.
---
Then maybe that's what it's there for? Not all content needs to be evergreen. Sometimes you just don't do a thing after a certain point.
---
It isn't dead content if you did it at one point but don't anymore.
---
That's what makes content fun for me in my opinion. You can do it "by the book" and take it slow, but if you understand the mechanics of the area you can exploit game knowledge.
---
Say for instance you know the patrolling regions of several knights. You find out the ranks of 2 knights that cross paths at a certain location, and decide to kill one of the knights in a certain cross section as the other comes to you. Or you aggro one before it patrols off so you can kill it quickly right after in exchange for losing some appeasement (and not having to chase/ find it after)
---
Being able to do something like that makes grinding hundreds of "rounds" through this area more unique (and in my opinion, legitimately "fun") when you find these shortcuts.
---
Oof
---
Can you still buy rune legs? You may end up losing a good chunk of the investment.
---
Will you also be buffing the drop rate as well? I went over 6 tasks dry to get around 100k while in emblems I made over 500k.
---
You see my dilemma lol
---
Also the Sherlock with no shirt in seers. No shirt Sherlock
---
I believe they touched on that and found a way to make sure they wouldnt become new rares.
---
You do use a panning tray in the digsite quest if I remember correctly.
---
First 5k kills sold for 234m and second sold for 202m
---
This is why I dont merch
---
Swamp ass bad
---
So Peter Panning tray?
---
Apparently they made Romeo into a real thing too.
---
100% agree with this.  I don't understand why they didn't release it.  It would have required very minimal development time and it would have generated direct revenue from membership.  Even if it's pretty niche, I'm sure there's more than enough demand to justify it.  Now that group ironman is announced, forget about it for at least a year.  I can see why some people are excited about GIM, but I personally couldn't care less.
---
Well he does want a bit of profit maybe
---
Go ahead
---
Great, kbd is a little bit of profit too.
---
My point. So who are you to judge my answer/response? That outfit easily looks like the tzhaar, the tzhaars obsidian armor, or as someone else said, the Tekton.
---
Whenever I have to suppress my laugh in an inappropriate setting, I just think of doing MTA all over again and immediately fall under depression.

the fuck? it'd be an alternate source...
---
Also the US still has an opportunity to about face with regards to foreign and domestic policy, and even with a giant piece of shit in office there are (as of yet) still plenty of people who actively do not want to see the world burn working in the federal govt. If we get someone same as president next go around the US could very well become a beacon of freedom yet again.

If you have a lot of low skills it'll be a while to get the Hard diary done. It requires 70s in some skills (like prayer, fishing, and fletching). You don't need to do it immediately though, it's a nice goal to work towards.
---
Put everything in the old store on sale, you are already forcing everyone to spend their points or lose them in the long run.
---
What? If I work for x amount of time and make $100, then buy an item for $60, that item does not effectively cost $100, it costs $60 and I have $40 to use on whatever else I want.
---
Yeah man honestly mad respect to the guy. Faux recently killed like 3500+ Cerberus for a Pegasian Crystal and that looked hard enough!
---
Ahh that's good. I'm used to these post being more angry posts. It always leaves me questioning then why do you subject yourself to this continues abuse?
---
Honestly idk why jamflex thought vampire Ursula would be a cool last boss for Raids 2.
---
It‚Äôs super low effort and isn‚Äôt very popular (for a reason). I‚Äôll just keep ignoring it as usual.
---
:'(
---
It's called opportunity cost...
---
Go read it again. " The old mysterious emblems have grown weathered and worn, transforming into archaic versions. These can still be traded for points at the older version of the Bounty Hunter store.  "
---
The value of a high level POH is insane. Funny story, I sold a whole bunch of my stuff to get the money to get my con xp but didn't think about the cost of actually putting in all the high level stuff. So, for about a week I had a high level house with nothing inside.
---
Thanks bruh. I don‚Äôt usually fight magic range enemies. Keep hitting they down arrow tho bois wooohooo
---
Yeah i'm going to get constructive criticism from people who automatically downvote any pro pvp suggestions i make. Screw them. I'm just going to vent and i don't care.
---
Have you considered to git gud?
---
Yup and it's not even close to half way to 99 ;)
---
Shut up, seriously..
---
Dont leave any blanks, just fill something in. It needs more info before they will let a human review it.
---
More mele gear is not needed. We need new range armour.

Explain .60 cents per 1 million gp advertisements on any world being spammed constantly. No they aren't being banned because the black market price of gold keeps dropping which is an indicator.
---
Holy hell.....I need the odds for the master clue!
---
Nah, I just find it to be an interesting commentary on a game that used to be characterized by resource competition, which has now become an environment in which resources are personal sacred objects.
---
Sturdy. Good job mate
---
2gp take it or leave it.
---
Feel like it has something to do with diagonal movement? Occasionally when clicking about this will happen to me, but that‚Äôs just a guess!
---
Should kill the Knights for a chance at the jaw
---
That only applies to the new emblems today, old emblems were converted into "archaic" emblems. Many people expected Jagex to reuse the existing emblems for the BH rework and archaic emblems were also never mentioned until today's update.
---
Devalues my GE mithril flip only account
---
Void is better dps if you have lower than dragon darts. So you're better off with void and addy than arma and addy.
---
On top of that, you have to trade in emblems 28 at a time because they can't be noted. Talk about salt in the wound.
---
This is why i don't post pvp suggestions.. nice downvotes bro
---
All the clicks are large and hard to miss. There are numerous obstacles that require no clicking for decent periods of time, meaning i could easily do it in the background.
---
Seers requires more a fair amount more attention. If you want to train optimally its definitely better, but i found it difficult to do anything that required focus while also doing the seers course.
---
There is literally NO reason to do what you asked. if you want the boss variant and not normal variants...kill the boss. If you don't want them at all, block/skip...

I didn't say I'm staring at it the whole time lol. I get it, I do other stuff while I'm playing too, but I'll always choose the more active method if it gives more xp or gp. Except 3t fishing...

i have altered the deal, pray i don't alter it further

After playing  several hundred hours of rs3, initially the variety was cool.  I quickly began to dislike it as people could hide what they are wearing and you just don't know if someone is a noob, experienced player, or anywhere between.  Plus it makes the legitimate fashion items even more obsolete, which I'm not really complaining about, but still.
---
Yo im tired of seeing people say that lmao. **wasting money on talismans?**  ***astral runes cost 181ea.***
---
even if you use the staff for magic imbue, **two astral runes cost 362.**
---
those talismans cost **343.**
---
????????? its arguably similar AF lol so easy to buy them from the GE too!
---
EDIT: if you made mud runes you would have made decent cash and xp, lava runes aren't really worth anything

I swim in an XL, may I ask how tall and fat? Just curious around what sized person wears that size.
---
Definitely, it‚Äôs more the start of the attack, not so much when the projectile is coming at you.
---
At least from my own trial and error.
---
If you had mysterious emblems banked before the update, they have turned into archaic emblems and can still be traded for the old BH points.
---
yep. i can 1 and 2t blob flick along with any other monster but that's only when it's properly set up. if i just go out into the open to barrage a nibbler or something and there's ranger/mager with another blob my brain just gets fried from trying to keep track of all of that. i never take any damage from them usually (i even learned how to completely lazy flick them in my attempts) but yeah whenever some nibbler doesnt die i basically get destroyed ESPECIALLY if there's a melee or something.

I bet you're obese and like looking down on smokers so you don't have to think about how stuffing your fat face is the number one cause of death in America.
---
None of them pk, I don't understand how you expect them to know what to do. They just get flustered cause when they do mage a suggestion it gets shot down, and many pvpers point out the issues with it. When they realize "oh this isn't like making a boss drop tables" they give up on step one.
---
Like how can you expect to get good information from pvpers when there's a dozen different pures types where people sank hundreds of hours into training. You suggest nerfing or buffing one thing you're going to upset one pure build. The only person who did pk on the team was Chris Archie, and I honestly don't think he did anything at all after he stopped being community manager. And Chris Archie was a old washed up pker, not really a modern expert. 
---
I don't think the issues so cut and dry, and I don't believe it will get better if no one is trying anymore.
---
He said a few times in his discord that he's working on it and to be patient, so likely?
---
Yes
---
Jagex is powerless against sweaty neckbeards
---
Cry in customer support purgatory
---
Still better than that guy with the max account with the exception of 1 prayer
---
Damn, you're like the 5th person today who saw the BH update and went "SHIT GOTTA DO MY DIARY RIGHT THE FUCK NOW".

Literally have a post in Runescape Botting in your history

Triple jads in 3rd try, still dropped it. Learning these seemed too bullshit. And u plank in early waves wtf
---
Good
---
I second this.

1-30 tears of guthix

Currently at 83 and outside of achievement diary reqs, never touched Hunter.
---
Turn tirannwn into a mound of ashes tbh.
---
Cant you kill bosses in bh worlds?
---
Definitely meet more people that smoke weed on here than cigs
---
As long as you‚Äôre not trying to cater to what you expect people want to see too much you shouldn‚Äôt have too many issues. I feel those who make content entirely for a viewerbase and not because they are passionate about it often feel disingenuous. 
---
I look forward to seeing what you have in store.
---
Why would peter pan be in osrs srsly r u dumb
---
I'm a casual pvper, maybe do it when I'm bored. The rewards offered wouldn't make me even consider going to BH. Scrap this now before anymore dev time is wasted.
---
I'm 96 hunter. I like it. It was more of a play on the fact that nobody cares about pvp
---
I‚Äôm 6 foot 1 and around 190 I‚Äôm pretty large but I only wear an L, how big are ya?
---
I'm trying to catch monkfish while I play on my console but I need my laptop to make a noise to notify me before it logs out  otherwise I forget. I have idle notifications turned on in runelite but it;s not doing anything..  I have the volume turned up.   this is a screenshot of my idle notifier settings[https://i.imgur.com/LHyDrFZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/LHyDrFZ.png)
---
Same here, but I feel old :(
---
Got my first patch of grey hairs at 24
---
Swampletics is only good because we get to watch a young man waste his life in greater orders of magnitude than the average filthy casual. Just saying.
---
Money Snek-good
---
Swampman- good
---
Shovel- good
---
pk- badd
---
I think he chooses which chunks he wants to unlocks on beforehand, no? Personally I love the concept of unlocking a random adjacent chunk, because you never know which direction the account will progress into.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
I would love to see the random tbow spawn tile that happened with people piled up to try and take it on some wood.
---
That's actually the only reason I did it tbh, besides that for spider tasks for venenatis
---
I don't think it's necessarily bad that different areas of the game intersect
---
‚ÄúIs this WoW 2?‚Äù
---
Thanks for the input I will keep that in mind!
---
You make too much sense dude
---
get a task from nieve, and the amt of monsters you need to kill is how many dollars the art is worth
---
And meanwhile here I am remembering how someone said they can upgrade my adamant scimmy into a rune scimmy, sure enough they put a noted rune scimmy in the trade but somehow I ended up getting a noted iron scimmy instead! 
---
And then I quit. For two days maybe.
---
say that 10 times fast
---
You do realize that this means medium and small male sizes were out of stock, right?
---
This is another one of those "making fun of an exaggerated stereotype to distance yourself from it" posts.
---
Yeah I don't have enough time to put videos together that's why I would stream
---
My neighbour was legit a 7xl. If he was to bend over to pick something up his belly would touch the floor when he was a 90 degree angle.
---
so an upgrade is only what, if it makes an item suddenly become BIS? no. an upgrade is an upgrade. be it 2 max hit, 2 accuracy, or 1 accuracy, its an upgrade.
---
Sorry your new comment with your map won‚Äôt load for me but I was able to bring it up from your posted comments. 
---
That‚Äôs a really old map, I didn‚Äôt realise you were still able to play that version of osrs. I don‚Äôt think the cove quest existed with rs looked like that. 
---
What do you use to play rs?
---
Did you screenshot this on an oven
---
It's a wooden Fred
---
Share the luck!  
---
At 585 kc with 3 onyxs :(
---
ü¶Äthat only makes me strongerü¶Ä
---
wtf is this inventory even trying to do
---
Do I need to?
---
Had no idea these had these drops, and probably didn't need to know since it's one of the rarest things period
---
reminds me of that one guy who said he used to kill zul'rah all the time in 2007, or whenever that was
---
no
---
No, we shouldn't
---
Bro your BMI is roughly 25 at that weight. You‚Äôre hardly overweight.
---
Nice.
---
Just don‚Äôt go to the houses with spam bots. Fight the power üí™
---
one is for when your really really really fat, the other is for when your really really really really fat
---
I think you will do better my friend
---
Or Romeo and Juliet
---
Are you an Ironman in real life?
---
Slayer points? =D
---
Not really an option for elite/master clues most of the time. 
---
I guess you could just bring bp
---
Lmao they would NOT think this was ‚Äúnice‚Äù
---
&gt;What? If I work for x amount of time and make $100, then buy an item for $60, that item does not effectively cost $100, it costs $60 and I have $40 to use on whatever else I want.
---
That's not a good analogy.
---
Let's say that you work for X amount of time and get $100 and a purple hat.
---
Then it changes to you working X amount of time and getting $100, but now you have to spend all $100 if you want to buy the hat.
---
In the "new option" that it changed to, you'd have to spend more time to get the same end result.
---
You can't get the bloodhound from an imp
---
Regarding lucky imps in general, I've been playing for like 2 years and think I've seen 2 lucky imps in total haha, super rare (and generally just pretty bad)
---
Yes i did, cause d chain dropped from 30-20m in that time
---
Only do it if you have a great conversational personality. No one just wants to watch you do slayer tasks as you get ready for some bossing unless you are fun to talk with
---
You‚Äôre prob right.. hopefully as a community, we exercise that which the world needs to do. Focus our collective power, and get what we all want.
---
Hazarding a guess id say it‚Äôs not worth risking the bot deaths and downtime when you can simply use the bots to farm gold another way, there‚Äôs no shortage of non wildly botting spots.
---
With ge you also won't have those sweet memories of having to spam for hours "Selling Z item"/"buying √ñ item"
