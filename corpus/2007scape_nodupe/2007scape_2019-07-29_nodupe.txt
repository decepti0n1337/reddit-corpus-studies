Do you have any idea how expensive game development is? And how hard it is to compete. Show some respect to the hard work people are doing. Every programmer gets underpaid but they do the job anyway because they have a passion. And if you can't pay 11 euro a month you can't afford to waste any minute on this game
---
I need this..
---
Wholesome as heck. I always find it funny how I have friends my age who genuinely are like "wow waste your time more" but spend every weeknight going home, scrolling social media and watching Netflix or reality tv shows for hours. We all have our leisure time and we spend it to relax 
---

---
I don't get endlessly scrolling Instagram or Facebook, but I also totally see how it's just "switch off" time for them. Runescape is that for me, it's a destressing tool.
---
I'll just let our debate over who's voting selfishly go. I think we each have our biases and there are selfish voters in each groups.
---
And I fucking love when retarded skillers think PKers don't skill. Some of them are downright mentally deficient imo. They have that obnoxiously strong bias which is why they think 2k worlds are free of PKers. That's why clans camping the skill total worlds on release of revs uniques was the best.

One thing I've realized getting older is that the sooner you stop judging yourself for *doing things you enjoy* the happier you are. I went through that shit at 30, but remember to do what makes you happy.

Don't delete this comment. I'm willing to bet more than a few people here need to see this. The hugboxing affirmation that "it's not a waste of time if you're enjoying what you're doing" (while mostly correct) can mask genuinely unhealthy habits and keep people from realizing that they need to make a change. 
---
It's not even a matter of playing "too much" in many cases, but what brings you back. The allusion of progress is addictive.

Hope you get things sorted, and are able to play RS guilt free and for enjoyment, rather than escapism!

The only things worthwhile on the surface are an anvil and a few shops. There isn't really any attraction to priff other than Zalcano and the Gauntlet which are both underground.

Ya you may see people pop up at the bank to grab some more brews and stam pots but thats about it. I hate myself for losing my graceful a while back so ive been back at the agility courses recently to get that stuff back lol!
---
Completely without defense above 20 or 42/45 could also be argued as ‚Äúpure‚Äù in that case.
---
If you skill a lot, you can finish Song of the Elves and do Zalcano. If you have 43 prayer, you can do Zulrah. Those are my 2 money makers (also don't have a main).

You shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with those stats and that gear as long as you understand the mechanics and aren‚Äôt afraid to give it a few tries. Just make sure you‚Äôre using a salve ei. If you don‚Äôt have it just spend the time in NMZ now and get it. It‚Äôs huge for vorkath now and post quest for getting your assembler and camping for money.
---
The quest version already has 50 less defense levels than post quest so DWH and BGS aren‚Äôt super important for the quest if you can‚Äôt afford them.
---
Use the DPS calc to see if you should be using d hide or regular void.
---
Early 20s for the win

I'm not a developer so I don't know the stats. But many people have reported better performance from 3rd party clients than from  the official one. Best to Google search it yourself.

Disagree. It gets borinng if you binge. But if you occasionally get on its a release, relaxing, and fun
---
I agree with Zxv975, and imo having the different skin colours make it much easier to follow along. Its hard to differentiate between who is who when most of the models previously looked so similar (though I understand from your pov it makes sense to have them look the same).  Maybe a simpler change like different outfits would be a nice inbetween?
---
Doods no like
---
I lived with car fanatics for a whole year and they would constantly argue which is better lol
---
What else are you supposed to do on a long flight or at work?
---
Castle Wars was better when nobody really knew what they were doing, in like 2006 or so
---
No it's not. In both those scenarios you listed, the player has died multiple times, therefore is playing poorly and deserves to be punished. In the actual example being discussed, the player's playstyle is not actually relevant, because they are consistently be doing the same thing but getting different rewards based on the presence (or lack thereof) of neighbouring players. The player is essentially getting getting soft-crashed, because a player with better gear / levels / skill *lowers* the player's loot simply with their presence. 
---
This is fundamentally different to CoX, where the presence of other players does not affect your long term loot *at all*. It's similar to ToB MVP system where stronger players taking MVP from you lowers your loot, but whether that's a good system and should be the norm for group content moving forward is exactly the debate being had. I'm personally not a fan of MVPs and believe there are healthier ways to promote engagement.
---
Real talk though did he make 80 or 90k in loot?
---
You disagree that the person who doesn't get bored of the game after a couple weeks does NOT like the game more than the person who does?
---
Not saying it shouldn't, just that the disparity between the two should be lessened.
---
This fashion scape is as old as it‚Äôs gets bro.
---
Thanks dude
---
You need the rune defender equipped, and you can do it at any level def if you have either 1) Prot Melee, or 2) lots of food
---
&gt; I dont see why the team feels the need to copy their competitors.
---
rs3? really?
---
Yeah man???? The difference??????????
---
As someone who plays melee, I absolutely hate tick manipulation for the sheer fact they will now allow new content to come anywhere close to tick manipulation xp from methods 10+ years old is bullshit. Holding onto those methods makes most content dead from the start. 
---
Also the appeal of melee isn't the technical difficulty of the game. Its the fast pace and highly volatile gameplay and the stories of players forged from years of effort and hardwork. Yes, the movement is the result of unintended mechanics  but were they simple buttons i could press I would still play the game.
---
In a technical sense but not a literal sense for years
---
Well thank you for the video!
---
You only need to show the lady in the basement the tune defender the first time iirc then it doesn't matter, you should be able to get it regardless of def level.
---
1. I‚Äôm sure you can, but may not able to wield it.
---
2. Have it anyways. I think just for the first time you want it in inventory as she checks.
---
Prayer... effectively using prayer to train will increase your.xp rates by the percentage of whatever prayer your using. Ultimate str is 15% faster xp. Buy 200 prayer pots using procolite armour d boots d defender b ring I torture or fury firecape and you'll see the gainz you want. You won't make money doing slayer tho, that's essentially the downside. You'll always recoup what u make unless u do really profitable tasks. Generally it evens out
---
See, this is what happens when ya'll voted no for warding Kappa

Like a full grown pizza

You literally get two loot rolls, and I have never had double shit loot. It's always at least one high tier loot roll. Which means double loot+

Tick manipulating should always be optional. Right now it's not if you want a pet.
---
the difference between ghrazi and chaotic rapier is only 3 higher max hit (same accuracy). chaotic weaponry was worse than any of this
---
Gz that's one of the most annoying ones to farm
---
The mechanic isn't terrible but the way it was implemented was horrendous. Implementing a MVP only system for the pet just creates toxicity between people who 1.5t and those who don't. Almost anyone would agree having everyone get a roll on the pet each kill is much better. I'm inclined to keep the MVP system which is based off of throwing and mining damage, but remove the extra loot from it. Instead, the MVP reward should be extra shards and an increased chance of getting uniques. Standard loot is too powerful and the tool seeds aren't common enough. The ability to 1.5t in zalcano should be removed as well imo.
---
Whenever you want.

i just want to nut in some puss can I come

Can't even spell correctly smh where did we go wrong with you?

Why'd you block how many days you've had your acc? I want to know how long 200+ days took you
---
It requires 60 Def to equip.  You can get one at any level but won't be able to use it.
---
All you need to do is show Lorelai a rune defender once, no need to have it equipped or in your inventory.  But since it's your best offhand until you get a DDef, you might as well just use it.
---
Well... no it‚Äôs to avoid the confusion of the actual mini game I suppose

You're welcome! I hope it was helpful

If you have the slayer lvl for dust Devils or even better nechs, those would be better. Otherwise yes mm1 cave

I think the new wave of artists are amazing at what they do, however, the seem so out of touch with what makes Osrs old school. Take for example the Arceuus library or the new Elven characters, on their own they look great, but they deviate from the simplicity of Osrs's characters/models. The only 'old school' thing to come out recently was the Forthos dungeon and the Hosidius rework, the rest is cool but has no place in Osrs. Just my 2 cents.
---
u/JagexGambit Hi please read this! Excellent expansion to points I made on the 1 Day After thread

The trees are pretty much the same as those but with crystals tacked on. What confuses me is that the trees don't match the outer environment at all.
---
How far in the future are we talking?
---

---
I already said 1.5T breaks it, but just having higher stats doesn't break it. As long as I am in a world with nobody doing 1.5T, I have found that even with absolute minimum stats (70-ish since SOTE requires 70) you can still get good drops by just playing smarter.
---
And I'll give you an example since I don't know when I'm going to do Zalcano again after the pet thing dropped on twitter. I count the floor "phases" and decide how much I mine based off that. Sometimes I decide as well based on how much other people are gathering. So, for example, if the tiles immediately light up right after Zalcano has put her barrier back up, I usually mine a bunch more because I don't expect people to a) get to the imbue in time to abuse the blue tiles and b) for her to do a "double" which is activate the tiles in quick succession. So I put some thought into this other than just "mine 4 ore and repeat".

---
The whole SotE update artwork has been bad overall, this RS3 looking set and Elena chathead are glaring examples of that fact, but in general most gear and NPC models look horrible and not oldschool at all
---
For a game that values its oldschool and nostalgic feel so much and prides itself on polling (nearly) every update, the fact we have no say in big impact design updates makes 0 sense, we're stuck with whatever the designer in charge happens to like, in this case to very bad results

Yep making all builds in that cb bracket almost require it to not be at a massive disadvantage. I done my share of pking with and without it. I mean it was a fucking fun era to pk.

You said "mining damage (after the barrier) doesn't seem to matter at all for drops" but if that were true there would be no reason to 1.5 tick.  And I don't see why you would think that only the number of hits during the mining phase matters, as opposed to actual damage done, especially since you apparently agree that damage done during the throwing phase is what matters (not just the number of throws you make).  
---
Also you're right about that strategy helping, because that what I do.  But regardless, over the last day or 2 it has become extremely extremely difficult to beat out high level players, 1.5-tickers, and nearly impossible to beat 1.5 ticking high level players, no matter *what* strategy you use or how perfectly you play.  That's what has broken the boss for me.  It was fun trying to outsmart people and put in max effort for max rewards, but the ratio of reward to effort has become almost moot with more high level players realizing how insanely profitable it is to farm the MVP and 2nd tier drops.
---
It's not

Huh that is odd, that doesn‚Äôt really make sense

But you kill jad in the Inferno too tho right?

You dropped logic and resorted to insults.. i would rather discuss the topic but you want none of it. Good day to you brainlet.

If half the armour in the game released today you'd complain about how it doesn't fit osrs

Wait how do you 1.5 tick Zalcano? I thought just 3t was possible with tar and herbs? Or is that 1.5?
---
One time haha, I do it regularly.
---
Did I say I was gonna go around saying obviously offensive things?
---
It‚Äôs understandable though. It‚Äôs like they just let some random make the new elves they literally have nothin in common with old elf designs

Me too but the red one. Jagex needs to add an option to sell it back. Having a 500k untradeable junk item in your bank is just dumb, can't even alch it

This whole thing made me laugh out loud.

I pointed out some flaws that could have been fixed by looking at the reference and said that there should have been more demons. I thought I was being quite clear as to why I wasn't a fan. I'm not really upset because boy have I seen far worse. However, I am disappointed, so you nailed that one! Here's the entire laundry list of reasons as to why:
---
DH-guy is missing a hand. Considering THE REFERENCE IS FRONT OF YOU, it isn't so much my 'high standards,' it's a distracting, glaring flaw. It made me laugh because it looks like he's wearing the hellhound as a sockpuppet. 
---
DH guy is not even looking at the hellhound. That's actually one of the more forgiviable things, considering that from here I noticed more oddly enough. \[You can stop here if you like because boy you're not going to be happy if you read on.\]
---
DH guy is missing a thumb, he's just barely holding the axe.
---
Count Draynor is missing a thumb and his right hand is bending like rubber.
---
King Roald's thumb seems broken. 
---
Dad is missing fingernails on his left hand and has them on his right hand.
---
The axe is somehow in front of Count Drayor's left hand when the count's hand should be overlapping the axe. Why? Because DH-guy is actually further back, or is supposed to be anyway considering he has the reference to copy.
---
A demon in the background is missing a face. DH Guy doesn't have a face (but whatever).
---
[Here a reference of a bear if you need it ever again.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/images/Image-w-cred-cap_-1200w-_-Brown-Bear-page_-brown-bear-in-fog_2_1.jpg?maxwidth=1200&amp;maxheight=1200&amp;autorotate=false) I tried something that would match what you might have needed.
---
And yes, OSRS has a wealth of boss fights so... where is everyone else? That'd be cool considering... yeah. It was waken off Google and copied pose for pose. That would be really cool, wouldn't it? Considering... TWO OF YOU worked on this thing.

Hopefully I didn't upset you too much with this.

I find the maxed people at clan wars who are like 99/99/25 with 99 prayer hilarious. Why is 25 defense able to be in a pure clan?  At that point you're the same combat as a maxed med or piety just become a main lol

without 99 str tassy doesn't give you a max hit iirc, in that case just wear bandos+ances/ahrim bottoms

I have no problem with spade hunters, they are just easy  k/d boosts while looking for real teams. And theyll turn into real pkers one day.
---
&gt;It makes no sense to say "just hop to a different world without high level players" when those are the very same worlds that high level players are seeking out in the first place.
---
High level players have no incentive to chase lower levels around and aren't going to waste their time doing it. Max players are sitting in the 15+ people worlds scooping up MVPs from all the idiots with 70 mining and rune gear thinking they have a chance just like the max levels did at Revs. Maxed characters have the most to gain from avoiding the small groups because they have the best chance to win regardless of how many people are there so they go for the fastest kills.
---
The way you're talking about maxed kids chasing noobs is like you've never even been to Zolcano. Theres only like 3 Zolcanno world types: trios and quads of maxed, 10+ players  shit shows with the same maxed players scooping mvp from idiots, and 4-7 mid-higher level player worlds where mvp is random for the most part.
---
The problem is redditors are the idiots rushing the 15+ person worlds because they saw how much money the maxed kids were making despite have the bare minimum mining required. Instead of using their brain and just finding a less crowded world or avoid maxed teams they just come to reddit to bitch and moan. They want the 3-6m an hour the pros are getting in the high pop worlds and refuse to take anything less, that's literally all this controversy is about.
---
 I've got over 100 kc and I dont 1.5 tick and I dont even have a dragon pick yet I still get MVP like 15-25% of the time because I'm not stupid and try and compete with the CML kids.
---
They just added a rune vendor in priff that stocks 250 cosmics.

Why so you get bullied more?

---
Is it better than dragon armor?
---
not as impressive as this, but i got a drakes claw on 1kc and i was ecstatic, literally just unlocked em.
---
Yeah mines not a gamer :/
---
Idk, most bosses in osrs are designed to be killed in groups, and only the person who gets the kill rolls a chance at the pet. Wintertodt is an exception to this and not the rule. I agree it is a bit weird to give everyone a drop but not a pet roll, but again I don't see how it's much different from raids aside from the fact you can do worse than everybody in a raid, but still snipe an undeserved pet. This isn't how 90% of bosses work so I don't know why it should be different here. The better person does more work and thus deserves the pet more, and if you aren't able to compete then you should get with a group of players closer to your level. I know I couldn't compete at 72 mining so I don't go expecting a pet.

Must‚Äôve got lucky cause so many worlds are crystal pick 1.5 tick op 99 trihard in the shat tuck perfect runelite + users

EU is just born with the "life is cold" mindset.
---
It's sad to see, I don't really pk too much because honestly the rest of the game gets updates frequently enough that it stays interesting. I think the issue is the lack of direction. There isn't anyone on the team that is enthusiastic enough about pvp to have a vision for future updates so they have to get all of their suggestions from people who may prioritize their own interests.
---
212 is also my best. :P

What exactly did I say that's not true? Only one person can roll a unique drop in a raid, and that person is also the only person who gets a pet roll? Literally every boss but wintertodt gives the pet chance to the person who does the most damage.
---
No u

they should make pestle and mortars explode if you walk past the barrier and do 99 damage

No worries! Have fun!

why? u hit more?

I mean each to their own.. I enjoy raiding CoX and ToB and upgrading my gear.. being able to afford buyable a etc is fun to me.

---
Mvp is fine, 1.5 tic is only thing needing changing. Before raids bosses always dropped loot for 1 person. When you kill bandos with a team not everyone gets a drop, wintertodt has warped people's views on what a boss is supposed to do.
---
The new magic shop in SoTE has 250 of them in stock. I just bought 5k of them no problem
---
I would avoid it. Adds plugins that were banned from the original runelite and such which is a definite red flag. Just use the reputable runlite client from runelite.net
---
Well 20 earth runes doesnt cost basically anything and its faster to bank at the ourania bank
---
Maybe next time spend that 2 and a half hours cleaning your car instead of putting more hazards in it.  I mean, yikes
---
No it's not.
---
Exactly. If that‚Äôs fun for you, keep going for it! Fill out that collection log :)
---
While I agree tic manip should go, this isn't a minigame nor is it meant as a co op boss. It is a boss that you can solo, or team if you wish too.
---
Antiban

Support. Add base exp for firelighters that scales up with better logs. Make it small but substantial enough to make them worthwhile
---
Tragic
---
My only achievement was that I killed someone running around with no gear and he drop a rune platebody. I think that is the only PvP kill I have to this day.
---
To be fair, this was the work of Mod Gee.
---
So what pet do you have nerd
---
how is it worse, with 75 attack ags can own zerkers
---
i know but not what i was asking, i'm sure some of the plugins can't be detected - like overlays? is it just the stuff that changes left clicks and stuff?

This is a solid mindset and a trap I fell into when I started playing again. Always trying to do everything as efficiently as possible 1.5t WC, 3t4g Mining. 
---
Yeah the exp was great but I realized I hated doing it that way and would only spend 20-40 minutes doing the activity before surfing reddit or getting up to do something else. Doing everything less efficiently in a way I enjoyed made me play much longer per session and granted more overall exp per day even if it took longer.

---
When you need to do it for 20 hours a few extra tiles becomes a big difference, bring a big stack of 3gp runes and its worth your while, given you're doing it faster you may actually be saving money because the produced runes are worth more

No it doesn't? I just double checked dragonstone armor and it looks nothing like the osrs version aside from the expected feature of dragonstones sticking out.

Cali is the size of like the Georgia/Florida border all the way up to New York. There's a huge variety of costs of living in that area
---
game is exactly where it was 10 years ago, constant new stuff that looks alien while neglecting the old, with ever growing power creep. every new dev or artist is layering down their "take" on the game without a sense of respect for what came before - the brainlet masses are cheering it on as well giving the dev team false confidence.
---
it's only oldschool in name. at its heart all the bad things that happened to the main game are happening now, and will happen in the future. 0 respect has been paid to what made osrs (or runescape pre 08) a great and unique game and as a consequence it has lost its identity.
---
runescape never deserved to be a "top mmo" that just looked a little outdated - it deserved to be a well understand and defined niche game that did things inherently its own way in complete disregard to how every other game did their own thing.
---
This isn‚Äôt disrespecting Ash... it seems that Jagex is hiring and she‚Äôs inviting people who are criticizing her to apply. It‚Äôs more a clap back at the sweatys on Reddit than anything.

---
Theres definitely different ways of interpreting it. But all the "complex" bells and whistles here are to provide ease of use to the driver
---
Imagine this is another boss, say kalphite queen, but every world is packed with 10 people. Should they give a pet roll to everyone who did any damage to the kq? I don't think so. Pet chance is fine as is, if it's really a problem them make some instances so you can solo if you're that worried. This is supposed to be a boss, not a minigame, not a training method like wt.

Boo
---
Least he didbt tell you to alch yourself
---
You are wrong. There was massive backlash on reddit and Twitter and now Jagex is polling atleast one chathead due to the backlash.
---
Yeah I really don‚Äôt like this at all. A drop table roll should be a drop table roll. MVP should get more rolls but not a different table...
---
Weak
---
Set a few goals. Have a passive long term goal, such as getting the level requirements to do Song of the Elves, and have active short term goals. Sometimes when my longterm goal is feeling tedious and grindy, I switch it up, such as doing a new quest or two. Then those few quests unlock a few more, with a few more requirements usually within reach of my current levels. Eventually, by working through short term goals I'll reach my long term goal.
---
When I dont have goals set however, I play similarly to you. I log in, open my bank and stare at it, thinking about what to do. Sooner than later I just log out and start playing 2K or Madden, only to kick myself when i go to bed, thinking about how i could have got to 85 strength or 60 construction.
---
I don't see why this bothers you so much honestly jagex doesn't have to poll anything it's their game they only poll shit to make people like you who cry over everything happy.
---
Took 5 tries.
---
Like the other 2 comments said. It's more a security risk to you that you should be worried about
---
Rings of dueling arent free either, you are spending 1/8th the cost of a ring of dueling at 872gp so 109gp to  bank at CW each time. The people spending 20 mind runes to bank are spending 80gp to bank. 
---
 &amp;nbsp;
---
This is not even counting the fact that you will be making more runes per hour so making more money.
---
Imagine using a brain-let who ran around the same area for 1 hour without thinking to check else where as an example of risky death mechanics.
---
Nice man! Milestone.
---
They're player-vs-player focused builds. Maintaining limited defence, prayer, and attack (and sometimes other things like range and mage in the case of an obby mauler) allows you to keep your combat level low while still having a high damage potential. Initially this had a sizable advantage over "normal" accounts of the same combat level, but it's long since become mainstream and is now done to stay competitive because you're up against other people using the same builds.
---
It's funny how most people seem to have forgotten the dock and Lumbridge unpolled changes (which were far more significant than some elf NPCs).
---
Just like those changes, this will all be forgotten within a week or so.

The wiki always has a pretty good gold standard for guides but if you want to get a good idea of the different ways to do a skill I recommend watching a few guides so you know all your options. When you search for a skill guide the top 5 results will always be a good starting point too
---
One thing that I really appreciate recently is the amount of community-dev team interaction and communication, I really feel like they‚Äôre doing their best to make it known that the community‚Äôs concerns and feedback are being listened to and taken into account, and for the most part I think the oldschool team is making the best of a balancing act among 100k+ players
---
It‚Äôs a shittier time wizard
---
Yes sir o7
---
My only gripe is the large inconsistency between different art styles. If there wasn't such a jarring and obvious difference (for seemingly no reason at that like in Elena's case), it probably wouldn't be as bad.
---
&gt; I play osrs solely because I want to play runescape without eoc or mtx.
---
I don't get why everyone casually glances over bonds not being MTX or being able to buy XP/items, or that unofficial RWT exists.
---
As a returning player (04-07), I feel the same. I just feel like I have no real desire to be in most of Zeah. I do like the Farming Guild, Mt. Karaluum, and Forthos though.
---
Just like most of the things in RS3, it's more like a one-off. This is a single character, and other characters look nothing alike, so again, it stands out. The whole place where this particular elf is located is incredibly beatiful and detailed, and it contains basically the most difficult boss at the moment.
---
Then you spend time in this beatiful place, teleport out and see how shitty the rest of the game world looks, you feel sour.
---
This is why simply putting a better looking model/texture is not always the best option.
---
You‚Äôre doing something wrong then, 87 mining - dpick, 140kc I‚Äôve probably gotten mvp 30-40 times

I have a bunch of iron ore and I want to raise smithing from level 32. Should I mine a bunch of coal to create steel bars and low level steel materials or take the 50% change to smelt iron and  smith \~iron platebodies? What would be your strategy?
---
Today's PVP is the worst it's ever been. The wilderness is dying, pvp worlds are dying, bh is dying. There are no new players trying out pking. I don't think you PK because if you did there's no way you could assess today's environment and say it's better than it's ever been.... :/
---
Which sets are you referring to?
---
If you get close to 99 str, range and mage you will be 2.4m hp xp from 99. So to finish hp you'll have to get like 4,500 pest control points for 99.
---
It's on runelite normally in the options as loot tracker

We're literally just the universe experiencing itself subjectively enough to play osrs.

They put Jon Snow in old school now?

It isn't, next quest will probably continue where Eyes of Glouphrie left off
---
its already completely unrecognizable from launch so not sure what you mean about "not very long" lol
---
And Baxtorian let his remaining army get killed searching for his wife and the player character assassinated King Tyras and burned food supplies in West Ardougne and literally Carrie's out the orders of the mourners to gain their favor.
---
Honestly, if there's one sure conclusion to draw from this quest and the other GM quests, it's that the player character is an unstoppable force of nature. In MM2, the PC manfights the generals of the monkeys, ogres, and trolls, then fights 4 mutated gorillas and the former head of the gnome military who himself ingested the same mutagen. 
---
If that's not enough, in DS2 the player character beats Robert the Strong who was supposedly one of the greatest warriors ever. He 'kills' Vorkath who nobody has been able to beat for hundreds of years. Then he leads a fight against basically an army of dragons, killing every single one. Then he fights Galvek who was so strong that he was deemed to be a threat to humanity as a whole. The PC has like 10 insanely powerful heroes with him supposedly for backup but he just says fuck that and curbstomps Galvek by himself. 
---
Now in this quest, the player basically runs a coup of one of the biggest cities in the whole world by himself and kills every single one of the King's guards with no issue. Then he does the same for the entire mourner camp. Then he fights the leader of the rebel elves and wrecks him, fights Iorwerth's strongest henchman, who to this point has one shot every single person he's attacked, and stomps him in to the ground. If that wasn't enough, he then fights a corrupted fragment of a literal god in her own environment and somehow wins that as well, single handedly ending a civil war that's been going on for hundreds of years. Player character is wild.
---
This shit needs to be removed and replaced. Like who the fuck thought this looks like regular osrs rune armor, what the fuck this pissess me off so much.
---
But in combat, you're usually sharing loot with the people you go bossing with. At Zalcano, that doesn't exist.
---
No one goes to Corp with 4 other people with no promise of a fair share.
---
It's so fucking simple though, old models had WAY less polygons than this atrocity.
---
SO......It means no sleep?
---
You can't imbue them because they don't lose stats anymore, so they're basically always imbued.
---
Are any of the items they drop actually useful to an ironman?
---
I can't see one personally.
---
What the fuck is this guys name
---
fuck off dude we been here as long/if not longer than most of these JMods... so yeah, we will tell them how we feel about what is 'oldschool' and what isn't...
---
I've seen a lot about 1.5 ticking Zolcano. Is this referring to mining the ore, attacking the actual boss once it's shield is down, or can both be 1.5 ticked? Is it done the same way as 1.5t teaks?
---
This is probably your best bet... Suck some virtual dick.

I enjoy the fairy quests most because of the well developed area. But perhaps Dorgeshun for some bandos grandmaster quest equipment maybe

I did SotE on release and Mournings End Part 2 without a guide. Make of that what you will.
---
I'm fairly happy with most of the content and he game. The actual OSRS updates have been some of the best updates in RS history and it. I started playing RS in 2006 and I think the people who complain about it not actually being "old school" are mostly wrong. The new content like everyone to do with Zeah, Wintertoldt, NMZ, and pretty much everything else has been so much fun
---
S
---
Buy some stams fam. And if iron is the problem, make a non iron.
---
Not really, but my iron is zeah only and so the dragon sword was a good upgrade
---
And he looks badass doing it
---
The art team needs to take a step back and come up with a design guide to follow for future content. What has likely happened here is that they've had too much time to master the graphics software, so they've ended up in a place of over-performance. Going back to the same stuff they did years ago feels like degrade, so they just keep climbing into the wrong direction.
---
This and some of the members of the graphics team are openly anti-oldschool, and feel that their artistic vision can fix something that doesn't need to be fixed.

Awh fair enough bro.
---
Quick question: How do you find the time to play? With a full time job, a wife and a dog, I can't seem to dedicate enough time to osrs. I can only give it like 20 mins at a time which isn't really enough time to do anything in that game, which sort of takes away the fun.
---
I'd like to see the achivement diary set get a spot in the Quest/Skill trophy room or on its own stand in the corner of a costume room. Rather than just thrown in the closet.
---
That said I'd keep copies of most stuff in the bank. Wildy swords I use for clues, Rada's is p much 24/7 equipped, lummy ring and ardy cape are farm runs.

I‚Äôm kind of ready for MTX at this point so I can be completely done. I keep logging on my HC every couple of days and see some stupid shit like dragon stone armor and that retarded looking bat staff from TOB and want to punch every J mod in their faces. OSRS is trending downward fast - don‚Äôt come at me about that TOB bat staff.. actually look at it and tell me that‚Äôs not the ugliest thing in this game
---
Same lol
---
you must be joel
---
I see, yeah personally I would do steel bars I think. You should make around 130k gold making steel bars from 32 to 40. If you can't afford much coal at all you could alternatively do iron bars w/ a ring of forging, which should still give you decent profit and xp, just not as much as steel.
---
If it's fun to raise your skills in f2p for you then definitely go for it. However, you train just about every skill much faster in p2p, or in this case you'd make a good bit more gp if you made cannonballs.
---
I did the same thing before going p2p but honestly regretted it once I realized how I could have raised my skills in a fraction of the time, many of them from quests alone.
---
This is so fucking sick holy shit
---
YES, i so agree with you
---
You explained the things i cant explain lol

half of them

I've seen so many f2p players flexing their 10m cash stack that they bought with RWT, so you never know

I've been using RuneLitePlus for about 2 months and I've never heard of anyone receiving a ban from the client. The only bans I've heard of were from people using external plugins to automate certain tasks like gear swapping for example.

Well we're lucky you aren't making the decisions then.
---
Hopefully this is an intended change tbh
---
good.
---
What the fuck is happening to my game!?
---
this is a huge problem imo
---
the story/lore of an mmo starts to suffer when there's no problem too big for player character. Not saying questlines should be bleak or full of unavoidable loss but why make the situation so unrealistic in the first place
---
thats called rs3, you should check it out!
---
this looks awful
---
In my opinion the art direction of the game continues to lose more and more consistency. You have this weird amalgamation of content that obviously looks modernised in a whole larger world that retains an aesthetic from 2007. I personally feel newer content tends to be over detailed and I think that's what the other poster was bringing attention to with his shading example, while we seen that in some scenery in 07, it's obvious when that is overused. It's not that it looks bad, it's that it doesn't look right. An example of lost consistency is the upscaled buildings in Zeah which dwarf other world structures (Hosidius rework did a good job fixing this, the rest of the continent will benefit from that treatment), the new elf NPCs, or the proposed Warding skillcape which was geometrically different from the other skillcapes.
---
We should, but we won't.
---
what... what is this inventory set up for???
---
Artisan would be nice
---
Is that the one where I can dupe all my ammunition and not worry about getting banned?
---
15k xp an HR at 58? You're pro
---
is worth 5m/h tho?
---
I don't think the XP needs a buff. 20k/hr while making great GP is a solid tradeoff. If you want an inbetween you have Blast Mining at like 70k xp/hr and decent profit while being attention, MLM at like 45k/hr and average profit while being easy, and then 3 ticking which is high effort high rates no profit.
---
I saw mod West's comment in the other thread, I kinda felt bad since everyone hates the thing he made.
---
Then I read your comment and thought about how he put his name on this design. He made this, knowing he glued dragonstones to rs3 armor and called it a day.
---
He probably should feel a little bad about that and try to improve.
---
I know that some will assume that this is just botching for the sake of it, as they believe everyone plays quests the same way (by mashing space), but I‚Äôve always enjoyed the quests of runescape quite a lot.
---
You don‚Äôt really hear this above the EoC and Squeal of Fortune or new armour models, but one of the major reasons I quit RS2 in 2012 was the butchering of quest lines, specifically (the very aptly named) Salt in the Wound, which not only destroyed the Slug storyline, but also brought down a penguin quest on the way down - compromising the story and creating a plot hole just because they would‚Äôve rather had more people play the new quest. 
---
Priorities for different people lie in different places, and the last thing you want is to devalue parts of one of the most enjoyed quest lines in the game, just to show off some new models that don‚Äôt really fit in anyway.
---
OSRS exists in many ways due to a sunk cost fallacy. ‚ÄúPlayers don‚Äôt like EoC, but we spent so long in it, so we will just keep it in anyway‚Äù. Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes.
---
Read the thread
---
Or you could just not care what people do and move on with your life
---
It‚Äôs simple - if it looks out of place, it breaks immersion.  The entire game has this low poly simple texture realistic art style and then rs3 artists come to the oldschool team and hamfist a different modern art style that clashes.  
---
The new visuals probably aren‚Äôt bad in their own right, but it‚Äôs visually jarring when put next to the rest of the game
---
Dwarf line would be cool, but since d pick is so conviniently placed in the wilderness and not in the hands of the master miners... I see little point.. the fairies line would be cool as well, but since the staffless travel is in diaries already, and for all purposes the ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù watering can is in tithe.. again little point apart from lore.
---
The only one that make sense and seem interesting is the desert, opening it up and indeed like others said, open up raids3 in the tombs of the desert.

I got mine at 98 hunter you lucky SOB. But his name is Boarsworth and I love him.

Oh yes RS3's elf city was broken as hell, stupidly good and afk skilling methods for like every skill...
---
Which is nothing like what OSRS has added... so "Laugh Emote" at you my dude
---
I don't think you get 20k/h though I've got 360kc and only gained 200k mining xp as I've been playing in teams of 20
---
This kind of stuff isn't worth responding to, you can't change their mind because the thought process is essentially "reddit told me security bad!" There is no string of words to break a circlejerk that strong.
---
White and black is obviously better. 100% favour in all houses.
---
Only a small percentage in comparison to the many that buy them lol
---
Yeh big groups you sacrifice your XP, its definitely not worth doing. Aim for &lt;10 players and you'll get more consistent rates and also more MVP loot.

who said its your game? its our game.

That add above it with ash is priceless though, kudos to whoever made that.

I personally don‚Äôt mind players with higher mining getting more loot, but I don‚Äôt like that because my mining is slightly lower or I‚Äôm not 1.5t I can never really compete, not to mention I don‚Äôt generally like the concept of competing against others vs working together

I've been playing on my one and only RS account (RSN: Zonaris) since 2005. I've witnessed all the ups and downs of the Runescape updates and community. My knowledge on the game is quite remarkable. My pure was maxed out on both Pre-EOC and OSRS. It took me a bit after EOC to start over again via OSRS. I found it a bit too much to put hundreds of hours into the game again, but here I went. I play OSRS nearly daily and I enjoy it a lot!
---
So, I just returned home after a mid week holiday and tried to login to my 14 year old maxed out 1 def pure which I trained and grinded for years, my account got permanently disabled. After checking my account status via the link, my account was perm banned for using macroing apparently. During my RS time I've never ever botted or used macroing tools. This isn't an direct appeal against it in any form, but this post is about the request to receive clarity about the rules and to ask a question to the active r/2007scape community.
---
Firstly, the situation: last week I was away on holiday for a couple days. My 16 year old nephew looked after my house and pet. I know he plays RS every now and then. My account password is written on a little paper in my office. So it could of happened that he played on my account while I was away. Knowing my nephew's side job in a local restaurant he couldn't play RS for more than a couple hours a day. I've asked him if he played on my account and used any form of macroing. He denies to have any knowledge of macroing. I tried to ask Jagex for any evidence to better understand the situation. Jagex doesn't give any proof or context. There is no Jagex Support hotline or whatsoever.
---
Jagex Support writes the following info about Account Bans:
---
&gt;*If you've received a message that your account has been disabled or involved in serious rule breaking, the account will either be suspended or* ***banned*** ***indefinitely¬†depending on the severity of the offence***\*.\*  
---
*You can* [*check your Account Status*](https://secure.runescape.com/m=offence-appeal/account-history) *for more detail about the violation and when this might be lifted. If your account has been temporarily or permanently banned for any of the following, we have deemed it serious enough to remove the account from RuneScape for the duration of the ban:*  
---
*Account hijacking*  
---
*Bug abuse*  
---
*Real world trading*  
---
*Other manual permanent ban (fraud, community safety)*  
---
*These penalties are reserved for the worst offenders and we will not debate these types of bans on our forums, social media or any other method of communication.*
---
**I know it is my responsibility to know what and who is doing things on my account**. Let's assume my little nephew does know about macroing and did macro (obviously without my permission). Although I seem to find it hard to get his motive to use macro and if so, on my account. Anyway, worst case scenario: he was logged in over the last couple days while I was away for maximum 4 to 6 hours and he macroed.
---
If my little nephew did any form of rule violation in the 4 to 6 hours he played on my account, is this in compliance with the "severity of an offence" Jagex Support is talking about to perm ban an account which has shown to have never ever used any form of macroing for over 14 years?
---
**In other words: is the given sentence of an indefinite perm ban without any evidence or option to appeal justifiable for potentially macroing 4 to 6 hours by an unauthorised user on a legit veteran account who've never violated the rules for over 14 years?**
---
**To make it less specific to my case: Is it justifiable to indefinitely perm ban veteran (+10 years) accounts with proven legit track records for macroing a very short amount of time without the option to appeal or see evidence?**
---
Reading a bit more account macroing, I do get where the perm ban idea comes from. Gold farmers and bots violate the Runescape Economic System and Integrity. By giving them a temporary ban, they'll probably continue after. My situation is not comparable with these scenarios. I've still got no clue what my nephew could of macroed on my account. I had a healthy hardly grinded 120m bank so I can't imagine any form of gold farming.
---
I hope the community can answer me this question(s). I am totally devastated and I feel very stupid to leave my password open in my office while my nephew looked after my house. I still can't find a motive for him to do this. I have a feeling of in justice. If it is true, I feel that the punishment I am getting is not in balance with the length of my account. I'd love to hear your view on this.

You can sincerely fuck off.

Who fucking said make super restores? I think from 55 you can make attack or super str pots which i think are better or prayer pots

Flinching. Look it up

Can't pk = Can't play

This needs fixing asap
---
It feels like every one of these "I got scammed and it's my fault. iM sToOpId BuT i LeArNeD mY lEsSon" posts are just people trying to get some free shit by making others think "Oh, well they got scammed but they learned their lesson. I have a lot so I'll help them out."

Otherwise there's no point in making these posts.

If this was never discovered until now its hardly nostalgic for anyone at all

osrs art has been shit for a while ngl just look at the dragon hunter lance lmao

PvP combat is almost always done where you have to be within a certain amount of combat levels of another person. In the wilderness it depends on how deep you are, and in PvP worlds, it's 15 levels. Let's say you are a level 50 combat player in a PvP world. You can attack and be attacked bu anyone between 35 and 65 combat, but not of they're lower or higher than that. These accounts are designed to absolutely destroy people lower level than them before they can retaliate, but have absolutely no way to defend themselves if they are attacked.
---
he fights fire with fire
---
Gz but ur stats don't look like someone with 65m farming exp
---
I love the way you can store kc for later with GWD2.
---
Omg dude anytime I hear this song I am instantly teleported back to those days. I can‚Äôt separate it from RuneScape. Time really flies.
---
Support team? What fucking support team, and support for what? Not the playerbase, that's for sure.
---
I would sit outside of Varrock killing unicorns and selling the horn dust. To this day my mom still asks me if I'm playing the unicorn killing game.

Oh wow I didn't know the rule of level range, I need to learn more ahahah, thank you open me a world :)
---
You can profit/breakeven by making compost pots, using them on GE bought normal composts and selling the supercompost. Super click intensive and xp gained for making the supercompost but you save your bank balance at least.
---
Orange is the best one though
---
The "RS3" art still isn't high poly, a first year graphical art student could recreate this.
---
The design itself is more difficult than the art, it looks pretty clear that the art team is trying to adhere to the old school theme but still don't want to make graphics that have to work on pc hardware from 1995.

What's the cheapest way to go from 65 to 77 magic as an Ironman account?

How/why did it increase botting?

False, orange is the best recolor

Haven't played in a few months. Could you fill me in here. What inconsistent styles have they recently used? I've always thought most of the stuff has been consistent, but not particularly liked by the entire community.
---
What in the fresh fuck is that 4th image?! That looks bad!
---
Im fairly sure I pronounced it the exact same way
---
I made a post about how it‚Äôs important to find fun in this game, and How I came to that realization. You must be fun at parties.
---
Search osrs wiki herblore calc. Gives you an overview of the gp/xp. Look for something cheap which also gives decent xp ;).

One of those quests has to be Desert Treasure if you haven‚Äôt don‚Äôt it already

100 upvotes and I‚Äôll share secrets to 200+ every week, and get yourself 220+ üôÉ
---
I don't think it'd pass because max capers would want those styles as well. The only way it'd pass is if it was open for Ironman accounts only (which even as a non ironman player I wouldn't be apposed to)
---
Could I get banned for having an alt account purely for marching/flipping? Only reason I ask is because i'm still a low level so flipping is my only viable money maker but i'm wasting time just bank standing when I could be training.
---
Exactly lol
---
Hey what do you think about adding guns and rocket launchers to RuneScape? fortnite and Pubg have them
---
No thanks, I don't wanna miss out on fashionscape because my character is on a different mode.
---
Way too much work, not enough demand.
---
The MVP system is completely flawed imo. 
---
Pet rolls should be on any KC you get a drop, maybe a slightly higher chance if you got MVP.
---
Loot is already such a lottery, I think a system similar to Wintertodt where the more activity you do the higher your chance at a second loot roll.
---
Xp rates id argue are fine considering the insane profit and imo more fun gameplay than any other mining, although id personally buff the RCing and Smithing to 4/5k/hr each but a lot of people would be against that
---
Hello it is me, a friend
---
My drug score is too low.
---
there's better versions for android ported by fans with custom wad support. found one called d-touch on the amazon app store for 3 bucks
---
It‚Äôs very impressive, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea
---
Depends on what higher end content you‚Äôd like to get to first. 
---
I would personally recommend doing something that can easily get you your next bond in the time limit you have. I‚Äôd suggest doing farm runs and start farming profitable herbs as fast as you can. Acquire a coal bag from mother lode mine and hit the blast furnace for some easy low level money gains and smithing exp. 
---
I personally always train agility right off the bat on new characters because of quest requirements and the fact that  you‚Äôll be doing a whole lot of running around gielinor.
---
Prince ali rescue

But the mage arena cape is a magic cape and there isn't a crystal magic weapon??

This kinda triggers my phobia of dots

How does OSRS lack dignity, and how did prifddinas take the rest away?
---
tbh bandos is pretty different from all the other armours. Obviously it fits more than this but I suspect some would complain
---
...
---
I hate to be the one to tell you this.
---
But almost every mmo, ever, goes through graphical updates.  Especially older ones.
---
with 2fa on email and acc, your only chance of getting hacked (excluding mod jed shenanigans) is through social engineering, so just be mindful with keeping info like your isp &amp; location private (even with friends)

Wow this is some gentaltractor type quality.
---
Yes yes, for now I stay away, I watching a lot of videos and try to understand first of jump in pvp, too risky ahahah
---
Imagine? Sure. That'd be cool. Let's make Windertodt have a MVP system.
---
Deformed and rusty rune gear with zits, lmao
---
But the guy WAS wrong. Mod West explained why he was wrong, and explained how he made the models. He didn't really deserve to be downvoted because he was contributing to the conversation. He wasn't being a tool at all.
---
Actually I think the big issue is the unpolled stuff from this update, elves included
---
Appreciate the credits!

Boaty used a similar approach back in 2013, and ye he tends to be pretty efficient. But he died.

HD would be perfect

Reddit has never used the vote system correctly.  The way it's actually used is "I agree with this, I like this." &amp; "I disagree with this, I dislike this" when it's supposed to be "this is productive to the discussion" &amp; "this isn't productive to the discussion". 
---
 
---
If you get mass downvotes it's because people don't like the art style or they disagree with what you're saying.  It's silly but it's what they mean.
---
I thought about this too when I was thinking about making the suggestion. In terms of it being a Ranged item then it makes sense to imbue Ava's Accumulator instead. But I was thinking of it from a lore point of view, seeing as Seren is a God (and these are God Capes). Seren and the Elves are also Rangers so it wouldn't make sense to give it a Magic buff as there isn't a Crystal staff. There is also the Vorkath Head buff for Accumulators and I didn't want to suggest the Accumulator due to it's Ranged bonuses it already has. The Seren Cape (in my suggestion) only gives 3% bonuses to damage and accuracy.
---
Yeah.
---
I'd be embarrassed of this community too.
---
Are you jewish?
---
&gt;Edit: Unsure why this is being downvoted - apologies if I offended anyone! 
---
Because you started out with a condescending sentence
---
&gt;Nice attempt, you illiterate fucking worthless monkey! How dare you even speak to me?

Yeah, different clothes fits thematically too since they're all the same clan.

I literally cannot fathom why you have such a bee in your bonnet about him/her making a positive topic such as this, at no point have they asked for anything, so categorizing them as "you people" makes no sense at all, think about what you're saying lmao, and I'm the dense one, yeah okay.

i made a joke because i thought you were joking.  why would newer more powerful technology make it more difficult to do simple stuff?

Don't restrict these beautiful capes to only specific gamemodes. That's a huge no from me, dog

And would have felt more old school. Would have appriated the 'working with what we've got' vibe a whole lot more than this low end wow rip off.

They have talked about this on a previous Q&amp;A.

Not going to happen, it's an incredible amount of Dev time to remodel every single asset in game for a arguably small group of people.

Plus from that point on, they would need to make 2 textures for everything released afterwards doubling the artist's work load

Can you add a catgirl character model so I can jerk my chicken to my favorite childhood game? Zooming in on zilyana doesn't do it for me anymore and the sandwich lady is such a rare fleeting event that I rarely get the chance to do relieve myself of nostalgic desire.
---
At the very least, maybe catgirl tail worn in the cape slot and catgirl ears worn in helmet slot?
---
How are they not bosses? I‚Äôd say it fits all the criteria for a boss except for maybe kraken. I‚Äôd say that sire is more of a boss than DK‚Äôs lol.
---
I can look into it if you want

A solution to this is to get a larger art team, changing the graphics doesn‚Äôt require every employee at Jagex

I tried falling to the bottom for like 5 minutes for SoTE and couldn't lol.
---
The amount the pro warders care so fucking much just goes to show if anything there were more alts used for it than against it.
---
Were still at least 20 years off them being remotely viable, best case (for them),
---
Well those are solo only skill locked bosses.
---
You just happen to use combat to kill them so they're considered bosses but real pvm content comes from group bosses
---
My buddy did it today at 46 agility and never failed a jump. I thought he was just lucky
---
Do people play now? Last time I hopped onto the LMS world I was the only one there for like 20 minutes.
---
Zalcano shard you can 100% get without mvp. Have only seen tool seed twice and both were on mvp, but it could very well be gotten without. I‚Äôm guessing pet is the only thing that requires it, but I could be wrong.
---
You can use sound to determine the first attack from jad when he's slightly out of your sight when he spawns but can still attack you. After that just use his legs to determine what attack is coming next.
---
Make Runes Bad.
---
okay but then whats the point of polling to just do what the fuck they want anyways?
---
Because this pet actually looks cool to a lot of people compared to others
---
Can I suggest playing ironman mode if you haven't tried it already? I found myself in the same rut as this until I made an Ironman. Seriously changed the game completely for me. I'm not the kind of person to tell people how to enjoy the game but ironman mode seriously opens your eyes to different parts of the game you would typically never think about. Every item has value because you earned it yourself, gp doesn't matter as much.
---
The quest was never difficult? Besides who the fuck cares man its has shit rewards and was more obnoxious then difficult.
---
Well the guy doesn't have a chance as getting it as right as West, because West made it.
---
Slayer is literally a combat skill. There‚Äôs no reasonable way to train it without combat, so saying that killing high level monsters that have rare drops and have unique mechanics isn‚Äôt a boss for the sole reason it‚Äôs tied to a skill is silly. It‚Äôs like saying last man standing isn‚Äôt a PVP because it‚Äôs really a minigame and can‚Äôt be both.

You can still use the old methods i think if you find the person who does it

I thought the person who bought it got a temp ban and the person actually running the inferno got permed?
---
i get your point. but i think zulrah, vorkath and corp are easier. plus corp is around 4 kills / h compared to 5-6 kills oer hour i get at the gauntlet. BUT corp has a 600m unique and the blade will probably be at 20-50m. i still think it needs a buff. not a huge one tho
---
I think you both should calm down and focus on studying for your driver's permit tests or whatever 15 year old focus on
---
Yeah, like basically every consumer level car.
---
The automatics are just so stupid that they make the car unsafe to drive (with purpose) and simultaneously increase the cost of running.
---
The other problem is that they are much worse on the environment because they have a noticeably shorter lifespan.
---
Can you take a picture without purple hit splats?

Zalcano drops uncut onyxes, which previously maintained a price floor for the onyx (which the amulet of fury is made of).
---
Basically, more onyxes in game =&gt; more onyx jewellery =&gt; higher supply relative to demand =&gt; price drop
---
I'm being down voted because I'm concerned about being down voted? I only added that part when I was being down voted as it's not helping the discussion.
---
Either way, I've come here to engage with the community in discussion so I can figure out what needs to be adjusted. Perhaps I shouldn't have corrected the original commenter - I'll avoid doing that in the future.

Who dat

They stick out like a sore thumb anywhere (except zeah library or catacombs lmao)

Iwoereth told the king that the entity they where trying to summon was Zamorak to get him on his side, and some followers of Zamorak such as Iban believed this also and went there. Zamoraks "involvement" stems from and is limited to the lies the elves told certain humans to manipulate them.
---
Great idea, thanks! I've got about ~1000 maple longbows in the bank. Guess i'll high alch them while training agility.
---
Those bows are actually the reason why i want to get 75/77 magic asap. Spinning flax is so god damn boring, same with making glass.

---
Iorwerth is the Regicide good guy, Regicide makes 0 sense if you know Tyras is the good guy
---
Can relate.
---
Idk make it harder then. So less ppl do it. Why do skilling bosses give resources to everyone but pvm ones only to most damage?
---
You can set custom icons for applications in windows. Google that.
---
It sounds exactly like it did back in the RS2 days. I'm also surprised that some people prefer the dds sound lol. I have seen people ask jagex if they could change the sound. Actually in a recent Q&amp;A they had one of the audio guys on the stream and there was a question about the sound, and they said that it could be possible to retrieve the old sound. Which is probably why it is now in the game.
---
i know but i cant find the old icon, im trying to see if anybody else has better luck.
---
Rushing lower levels, yes
---
Bro they are a company, their goal is to make money
---
Not gonna lie lance is significantly better than arma but If your friends aren't willing to take you just because of this, that's a shame. Tent whip works fine. It's not a deal breaker. I can say that cox is pretty fun though so you should maybe buy the lance, test of cox and if you don't enjoy it get your arma back.

We already have a rune pouch to make alchemy easy on a slayer task.  An infinite free alch is literally just creating money, you can't just put that into the game.  Maybe you could combine your spell and the gloves, and have it as a passive effect?  Charge the gloves with scales, and it has a rare chance to freeze opponents.  Is that useful?  No.  Is it a waste of money?  Absolutely, and that's kind of in line with the whole idea in the first place.

It‚Äôs a long fight solo, with no increase in loot. Meta is 3 solid players, or 4 is really ideal. Make sure you have a crystal axe though, it‚Äôs been a huge boost in being mvp..
---
It's a computer game....

Hi yes i m mod yes i will need uR username and password

Kebbit claws

Jesus Christ. Can everybody stop complaining and nitpicking everything about the quest. Just go out and have fun. It‚Äôs a game.

Oh shit the penguins

Definitely deserving of more content

I did it yesterday and didn‚Äôt fail either
---
i question myself this everyday

the sub is self evident of opinionated criticisms and objective criticisms, just gotta read past your own bias and not dismiss conflicting opinion or evidence as nonsense.

What‚Äôs up with the price of cosmic runes lately? Up 60-80% in a few weeks

Kill monster good

God the max cape is ugly. 
---
Just add the shoulder pads already!
---
Singular they has been in use for hundreds of years and keeps jagex from having to rewrite dialogue depending on character gender
---
I personally like the previously suggested idea where they just go into your inventory like they do when you're gathering for ores, trees, etc
---
Is it true that the Waterfall Quest is now 'safe' since the mobs were removed and Moss Giants are no longer aggressive?
---
I saw it in one of the wikis. I didn't want to take my low level HCIM in there yet... lol.
---
This is a good suggestion. With only 10 minutes of prep time for the gauntlet it‚Äôs been really annoying seeing the crystals drop, but the monster is slowly dying over it.
---
Yeah, plz only circle jerk

exactly

Can we make Lumbridge Diary NPC wear this dragonstone armor?
---
Rs3 player here, this looks ugly af.
---
I just want stuff to look better you bunch of fucking sweaties. Christ get out of the past already we left true OSRS in the past years ago...
---
Honestly man I agree that the mvp system sucks but the other dude is right. Dont complain that you're not being rewarded as much as the people putting more effort in.
---
They don‚Äôt own Jagex anymore.
---
There are several chatheads that need some improvement. Not just Elena
---
Well they are in the UK or something so it could be grammar or they are trying to appease the crowd since that kind of culture is really taking off over there. Either way who cares. You don‚Äôt have to agree with the ideas but why do people lose their minds over pronouns.
---
Little things add up look at RS3
---
I agree that the looting system needs revision, I don't agree that the loot itself needs to be changed though, aside from gold ore and the low tier stuff like silver/iron things are tied to the alch price of finished smithing products (R2h, Addy/mith plates etc). So it doesn't have that much of an impact.
---
I also really don't get where Jagex gets their 100 shards/h at Zalcano data from, I get around 1.5 shards per kill, at about 20-30 kills an hour that's nowhere near 100, and that is doing masses, In like a 4-5 man group you get way less.
---
For reference, I've done about 400 KC, not abusing tick mechanics.
---
"lock stuff behind game modes" oh yeah giving higher recognition to the harder working player as cosmetic is really gonna effect ur fucking shitty maxed normie... give me a fucking break

this guy looking like one of those kids with progeria out here with that massive fucking brain.

I actually fucking hate reddit
---
I see people who are literally correct be on the recieving end of those paragraph posts with everyone wanting to take a high road dick-riding that comment
---
With my post I legit only wanted to grab mod west's attention and throw 1 or 2 details his way, but couldn't make the point without rambling and posting some examples
---
Didn't reply at all? You mean he didn't reply within 4 hours (which was how long the post had been up when you posted this criticism)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We have mods who constantly engage with us on social media, but even then you are not satisfied because dare to not reply within 4 hours. 
---
He replied at 7.30am British Time for fucks sake. Literally first thing in the morning.
---
Well I guess I can be less paranoid when I park my hellcat outside then.
---
Nope still gonna be paranoid.
---
Yeah agreed. I think there's a few things that look off, but overall I don't mind the majority of it. People have to be up at arms at something I suppose
---
r/copypasta

StarCraft btw
---
Its really just gee.
---
She legitly should not he given free reign to create whatever she wants.
---
It has its pros and cons
---
This is hilarious and I don‚Äôt know why
---
I don't mind people needing to be active but I'm not gonna go super try hard and 1.5t when half the games I might just get fucked by bad circle placements or mining rng...
---
Okay for starters, no. Tick-manipulation has been in the game for years. Was it an unintended mechanic? Probably. But it's impact on the skilling meta has been beyond huge, and pretending Jagex wouldn't have patched it out if they thought it was a threat to game integrity is just silly.
---
Secondly, if the best way to kill a boss is with tick-manipulation, and **you** don't wanna tick-manipulate, maybe the boss just isn't for you? You know that's okay, right? There are 23 skills and a huge array of content in Runescape - not every thing has to cater for how you want to play the game. 
---
At the heart of it, this "issue" is just a bunch of whiners throwing their toys out the cot because they see other players getting rewarded for tackling Zalcano in a high-effort fashion, and wondering why they can't be rewarded the same way for doing the absolute bare minimum. As though there isn't a literal truckload of ways you can already be rewarded in this game for doing fuck all.
---
Yeah I'm legit enjoying the fuck out of Prif
---
The *only* hangup are the gems imbedded in trees; they look a bit like parasites or alien embryos. Along with the tree leaves- not too much of a fan of the Neitznot/ enchanted valley trees for consistency's sake. I always preffered the textured leaves- they looked more "oldschool" to me.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the game can determine your character‚Äôs gender and simply replace the word he with she if needed with ease.
---
Thank you for the information. That makes it even more crazy to imagine that the client has not been worked on to solve this. Its kind of something that I have just ignored for years but blows my mind to still it being an issue this many years later.
---
I need help as well.. I also dont know how to do or even seen a fucking birdhouse.. Lol.. Those 2 skills have me stumped!!
---
Why? Replace one out of place RS3 armor with another?  Honestly, I think the elf armor looks even more RS3/WoWScape than the dragonstone.
---
‚ÄòEveryone‚Äô speak for your self. I hate the GE. I hated it when it came in to the game originally and I still hate it. Crazy you think people have to be under the spell of nostalgia to have an opinion...
---
I didn‚Äôt know this was a repost so I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt take credit for this picture
---
Looks like garbage. Very disappointing.
---
You lose a ton of charges. Started with a full shield at the start of my trip, down to 350 charges at the end. I hope they change this lol
---
Making jewelry is good money and xp for crafting. Maybe get some cowhide and tan it in Al Kharid until you can make gold rings or necklaces. 
---
Fishing is usually done in barbarian village. Can cook the fish in the permanent fire until you don't burn tuna. Then cook tuna, then lobsters, then swordfish, usually you will end up with some profit. You can stand on the southeast corner of the GE booth and withdraw one log and 26 fish, make a fire where you stand, cook, bank, repeat. You'll never need to move as you'll move 1 step east or west with every fire you make. 
---
Not sure what's should be done for mining and smiting... I did iron and steel to like 50 then I was member anyway. At higher combat levels, the dwarf mine in falador should be free of bots. 
---
Woodcutting should be oaks and then willows. You can bank the willows and then burn them wherever you want. I'd only get 50 if you want to become member as wintertodt is much better than regular firemaking. There's some oak spots all around. There's one next to the draynor village bank, also another east of varrock (right at the entrance. Willows, if you bank them, are best in draynor. 
---
Runecrafting is generally pretty slow, probably just do the highest altar you can. 
---
For combat just do whatever until you can do hill giants. You need a brass key to get to them, the entrance is between varrock west bank and barbarian village. They are usually packed but you should be able to find one that is free. If you want money, bank the bones, otherwise bury them for xp.
---
Because we don't know the drop rates yet? I also said "standard loot" I wasn't taking the blade into account...
---
Not to mention if they were to stop the hits through prayers, of course it would speed up kills so naturally the sword would have it's drop rate changed to compensate for the extra completions.
---
Also the fact that you're actually using the wiki's 340k average to argue makes me think you haven't done any gauntlet, because the loot is nowhere near that good unless you get the blade which we don't even know the drop rate of yet.
---
yes
---
I am 96 agility and I failed like 30% of the traps. So guess you are just lucky.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what George Lucas has to do with this?
---
I would vote no to both. They both sound equally damaging
---
You guys are great. Thanks for taking player feedback so seriously.
---
ah yes, forgot to add range tanks, ill edit it
---
My brother and I used to play together. He'd wear Amulet of Defense and full Addy, I'd wear Amulet of Accuracy and Green Leather. He'd tank monsters while dealing almost no damage and I'd attack them from ranged. We'd split the loot. This wasn't for bosses it was for like... Flesh Crawlers. We thought we were so cool.
---
Why not make it a similar system to something tried and true that doesn't anger the community?
---
Or poll it?
---
Someone slept on the couch last night
---
It really is poor design, saying that as someone who gets mvp... When I'm soloing g u just have a bunch of ppl trying to jump in with selfish tactics to steal mvp from a player who might not know better how to defend their mvp. And now I sit back and look at this I realise zalcano isn't being fought, we're fighting each other at this boss.
---
Does your guy mine instantly or does he sit there with the pestle and mortar?
---
Did a trio yesterday, I got 44%, fella teaching us got 46% and our scrub carry got 10% and a dex.....
---
so? there are plenty of items where the lower-tier version is better than the higher-tier one

No reason specifically. Just don't like the cut of his jib

If there's so much complaining maybe it's because there are real problems that need addressing...nah, couldn't be
---
I have 88 agility and graceful on and went to get Lady Trahaearn and I failed the first trap and saw that poison effect triggering. That pissed me off.
---
Idk  maybe you're just lucky. For reference I also had 75 agility when I did Underground Pass and Plague's end in RS3, there's no graceful on that game so I just went with bandos armor on and I never fell.
---
Imagine the prices if the minigame shat out tons of alchables like vorkath. Obviously, rn it's new and everybody will try it out. But eventually the prices of the armour seeds/blade will settle at a decent price.
---
Also @ same rate as Zalcano - yay another 3m/hr boss great concept and sure way to make the 'uniques' worthless lol
---
Its like they are using a blowpipe at 75 range and you use a crystal bow at 99. They probably get more kills/h.
---
Where you 1.5 ticking? i assume you got mvp a fair amount
---
Wrong reddit dumbass. I‚Äôm glad you got diamond in RNG simulator 2019 though. AutoChess is such a trash game lol
---
Sits there w/ the pestle and mortar when I don't click the rock again after dropping.
---
When I do it seems to instamine sometimes or the pestle and mortar animation will eventually become mining if I don't instamine it.
---
Agility
---
ngl the demon reworks were incredibly ugly and didnt fit the game at current time. they only worked out because soon enough rshd was released in 2008
---
If I use both of them then my prayer will be below 30 taking a big hit on how afk it is. As I‚Äôll be losing 10 prayer if I swap both out. So maybe one or the other will be most optimal? I‚Äôm just trying to find the silver lining
---
Love how many people want OSHD but complain about GFX models
---
It‚Äôs not a big deal though, and things change... the fact you think everything will stay the same and nothing will change unless it‚Äôs polled is ridiculous.... everything doesn‚Äôt need to be polled. 
---
Everyone likes just comparing about every single thing about jagex... they what half this sub is.
---
I get it, it was important to you but move on.
---
I'm sorry but how can you look at the new heads in the chatbox and say they look good? Even if you had to compare these new heads and the 2007 ones to modern graphics, the 2007 ones still look better than the new ones.
---
Hell ya brother
---
good lord how did this go through the polling? looks awful holy shit
---
Do top right bottom right, then 3t, click the rock then drop two ores, click the rock again and top top left then bottom left. If he's just sitting there and it doesn't insta mine you have to go a little bit faster
---
Construction if u rich boi
---
Literally thought this was photoshopped as the most ridiculous armour someone could come up with.
---
You can't always get what you want. Works for me
---
PLEASE!!!! While Guthix Sleeps was better than DS2 and Song of the Elves combined. If we could get some form of spiritual successor to that quest line in this game, I would be so happy, especially since I quit before I ever saw the sequels put into the game thanks to squeal of fortune.
---
Everytime the client shows that 65k max render for coin stacks on someone that shouldn't have it, i rub my hands together like a little grasshopper. Truly one of the most exciting things in scape for me.
---
Because then everything becomes the same with different colors and text. instead of something new. And polling is just a terrible idea. Polling of itself is dependent on the wording due to the "75%" rule.
---
If you say "should x be changed so everyone has a chance on pet" you need 75% to say "yes I want x to only be given as pet". While if you say "should x be kept the same so only top person gets pet" It suddenly is much easier to "change".
---
So polling about totally new features should just use 50/50.
---
Dude how far do you want them to take polling shit?
---
I was a happy boy back when polls were only about putting overpowered items in the game or not.
---
Now its about fucking chat heads that no one really looks at. Its gotten absolutely ridiculous.
---
There is going to come a breaking point where Jagex gets so overwhelmed, that the higher management are just going to say 'alright no more polls'
---
This community is a real group of brats, and its only getting worse
---
I don't like that personally
---
I *AM* a fan of the ornate look West was going for. It unironically looks cool as hell- like the almost samurai-esque shoulders.
---
It's just jumping the gun a bit too hard imo and it doesn't help that everywhere inbetween you have much of the triangle shading.
---
Sorry to say this but I *really* don't like your suggestion either, lol. The helmet is one of the things I actually have the biggest problems with.
---
If your afking cooking or fletching
---
/d
---
Lol dudeeee. You need some fresh air
---
Wow, how long did the puzzle take without a guide? It Took me like 2-3 hours with one!
---
I think it's because most of his guides are a copy paste of the wiki. Also his main account doesn't have great stats so people question if he knows what he's talking about. Some of his videos give wrong advice as to what the fastest training method is iirc
---
Fletching is the current world record at 3 hours and 9 minutes.
---
Fletching, prayer, then construction. Although you have to use specific methods.
---
Yeah, no, if that's the scenario you want to compare it to-
---
&gt;Yo the new Spiderman was lit-
---
&gt;hey no spoilers I haven't seen it yet
---
&gt;I sat in the theatre for it but I had in my headphones and texted the whole time
---
&gt;&gt;... cool story? What?
---
Fletching and Prayer. Farming is up there as well if you only count the time spent to plant/check trees.
---
Not really. I can go buy a blowpipe and solve that issue. You cant buy knowledge of how to abuse a bug
---
Holy wrench in iventory?
---
Name checks out.
---
Demonic gorillas are not an endurance challenge with waves. Strawman.
---
Albion Online is somewhat similar. It just has the addition of a huge skill tree. No crazy buttons though. It‚Äôs all about the grind.
---
Yes because "unpopular opinions" are usually quite popular
---
Plot twist. Its jagex customer support.
---
Easier said than done :( like heroin
---
:P
---
I don‚Äôt have that but definitely something I could look into.
---
first one looked better lol
---
I'm no game developer, but I'm pretty sure that having to trade in my real life wrists for a chance at an in-game pet isn't very good game design.
---
The graphic examples really helped me understand your point. Awesome post!
---
You don‚Äôt have to do the entire batch all at once for 63-70, buy around 500-1000(depends on your cash stack) and make those potions then sell them off to buy more supplies for the next batch
---
... I really like it. Looks different to anything the player has seen and to me at least elves would have their own unique weapon look.
---
Theyre pushing the osrs visuals and thats not a bad thing, the elves are runescape-y but clearly not human.
---
Maybe not but 2 were multi billion $ global 500 companies. I‚Äôm sure their competitors plus any number of whack jobs would have reason to. Anyways it‚Äôs just my personal experience. All reviews can be gamed. Amazon reviews for example are known to have many fakes but broad strokes they still paint an accurate picture of a product. 
---
I think we generally agree here, we can‚Äôt be sure that these individual reviews aren‚Äôt fake, take it with a grain of salt. For me however given that what they‚Äôre saying is seen at many companies I‚Äôm not too hard pressed to believe them.
---
Stop wasting your time with garbage replies, everyone else ignores them
---
Sorry if I explained it badly. But if you can grasp how I explained it you should get better xp. Varrock armour makes a big difference also. I'm 97 mining and I'm getting around 105k/h doing 2s2g like you.
---
jesus you guys. posting a video isnt saying they wanna delete the GE, they're just remembering some good times. get over yourselves.
---
to get rif of the 1.5t why doesnt jagex implent that you cant allow to bring a pestle or mortar/knife to zalcano
---
Desert treasure 2, that gives the reward of Raids 3 after the quest
---
I would say even having some measure in that makes Zalcano more difficult the more people you have, after balancing out drop rates.
---
I like the way the remake looks, but i enjoyed the layered shoulders but they were too much, maybe only double layered? Also the gem on the old helm I thought looked nice, but all the gems having that popping is overloaded. I do like the design of it tho, but maybe just the helm, chest and belt have that kinda pop. Plus the instead of purple on the helm hair thing, i think black would look nice to distinquish it from the rune helm. I appreciate you actually wanting to listen to feedback, keep up the good work. And like you say, can't make everyone happy. Only thing i can see people scream rs3 is the helm has a similarish design. Beyond that id say theyre quite different.
---
They‚Äôve said time and time again they‚Äôd rather release new content with worse rewards and buff it after some research than release it and nerf it. Give it a few days and let the dust settle.
---
I'm going to try this out in a bit! Thanks a lot! I'm also gonna review some videos as well, will keep ya updated!
---
it's unnecessary and makes you seem defensive from the get-go.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty big change to make unpolled with no indication that it was going to happen or that it has happened.
---
Yeah, I thought Jagex learned to poll this stuff when there was the big outrage about the change to draynor. If that was considered "changing iconic features", then how is such a drastic change to the elves not count???
---
Fury has high prayer, so at least that. And I get the afk, but you'll have to afk a lot less in total if you add the defender because of higher dps and faster kills.
---
Holy shit that should be a required read for jmods right now
---
&gt;ascetic
---
You mean... aesthetic? Also just because it's called "old school runescape" doesn't mean the game has to be (or should be) a rehash of rs2. They tried that, osrs was literally dead back then. Many of us (most, ya'll are the vocal minority) enjoy the new terrain.
---
both look awful
---
true
---
That smiley face is so cringey lol
---
Then you're imposing someone else's opinion on the entire voting population in some goofy devil's advocate weirdness, doesnt change the fact that you can't take the single data point of NO SKIPS and extrapolate that to KEEP MY QUEST HARD.
---
upvoted
---
Going through the effort of 1.5t'ing for extra rewards is fine.  
---
The MVP system on top of that is dumb.
---
Pretty sure I went from 70-80 att/str/def almost exclusively at Moss Giants üòÇ

if you have time to max you should have time to get bis capes

Looks out of place.

Doing a diagonal and clicking the rock makes a big difference. If you can do those two things and just go faster youll get it!
---
The Wintertodt is literally a boss.

Fury gives +5 prayer

I remember when I used to have bronze armour. I forged that shit on my own thinking there was no other way to get it.

Did what, bought good ranging gear and a BP to sweep the cave?
---
Did the exact same thing, no shame about it.

After the first phase I just left haha

pubg disabled lobby procimity chat. Holy shit that was the most insane cancer chat's I've ever come across. And there was no way to tell who talked. So you could sit there and make really fleshed out death threats and there was no way to report
---
Overall I've really enjoyed doing agility on the new course. The one thing that bugs me are the trees during the end section, it makes it really hard to navigate the obstacles (even more so on Mobile) - It would be great if we had the option to "hide" the trees similar to the option to hide roofs.
---
Other than that I've actually enjoyed Agility for a change!
---
Bro get out of here with integrity and shit, like it‚Äôs a bonus that we even get to vote on anything. It‚Äôs their game lol not yours.
---
Tbh I honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind some 2008 or better graphics, just make it toggle able. Hell I‚Äôd love it if they introduced 2012 graphics or even current rs3 NXT graphics without the MTX. For me, and many other players what ruined RuneScape was the EoC.
---
Or dh in nmz in class.
---
Vote no on anything for maxed nolifers until we get warding. Sorry!
---
:')
---
I would like to think the only thing they needed here are smaller gemstones (perhaps more in sort of a trimming fashion or in a pattern), and the shoulders to be not so wide out to the sides.
---
Other than that i think it looks decent.
---
Lmao last time I called tick manipulation bug abuse I was down voted to oblivion. Now look.
---
I know you're joking but this is on the very low end of profit. I was very consistently getting 1m/10kc up to 300kc at 80 mining/smith/rc. Prices crashing tho..
---
Sand casino always wins.
---
We had months to complain.  They shared their plans with pictures here and on Q&amp;A videos.  Those of us who complained were down voted to hell by Mod G fanboys.  The reddit mob created the problem, and now it must find the solution.
---
\*laughs in 99 agility\*
---
You're a real gem West, entertaining all this discussion and talking to the community. Art is a very subjective thing and you can't please everyone, unfortunately. The Hosidius rework was done so well, but not every piece of artwork you make can be critiqued by saying it isn't as good as the Hosidius rework. That's a copout and really isnt fair to you because you're dealing with vastly different content here. Just keep putting your passion into the game and I'm sure we'll be going in the right direction!
---
People still play fallout76 no mans sky and many other titles that where botched stop being so dramatic
---
Lololol idiot with bad account security
---
You are absolutelly correct, I don't have to complain, but I want to. I feel that everyone is entitled to express their opinion, whether other people agree with it or not is another matter entirely.
---
I dont know why you're trying to adopt the "I dont care" attitude if you quite plainly do care. 
---
"I dont care what we have for dinner as long as its pasta" 
---
"Uhuh so... you want pasta?" 
---
"I dont care. As long as its pasta."
---
You shouldn't design group content and then punish people for playing with a team mindset. Raids doesn't give only one person the loot and everyone else gets pity rolls. It weights things towards the person doing the most, but doesn't guarantee them anything.
---
I'm fine with the 3d look with the exception of iowerth and his gang and the chat heads. Iowerth is like clearly evil. TBH I'd prefer if they made look like a good guy and the other elfs evil because when you do the regicide quest you don't know you are unwittingly helping evil. Also chat heads...
---
It's /too/ intriquete.
---
Needs to be simplified in design.
---
I agree, it looks like RS3 Rune armor, slapped on with some gems.
---
Good, it'd better be reverted, if I had to suffer so does everybody else.
---
I guess if I have an opinion on something that it doesn‚Äôt matter since others have it too? If you‚Äôre looking for informative and concise information, then reddit is not where you should be. One voice may not have the strength to get an idea to a huge company like Jagex, but more people who talk about the problem will have a better chance of getting the idea across that this new graphics are shit. So fuck your negativity. Imagine having the audacity to tell someone they shouldn‚Äôt voice their opinion because thousands have the same idea. You tubers wouldn‚Äôt have a job.
---
Okay fine. When people go ffa Cox or tob, every one should wear the exact same gear, cause having spent time to get bis is unfair to the rest if the group, as it is a cooperative part of the game. Ill look forward to that.
---
The devs appearing completely stumped that the nerfs didn't pass is quite worrying.  Shows a distance between their thought process and the player base.
---
Is Herbie too on the nose?
---
you get ashes
---
A "dev sanctioned" exploit. I think by definition that means its a mechanic
---
that would be automated? nothing was automated or keys pressed or such

Nope, just a base plugin that you can find in the configuration panel. When it is active you can click the inventory backpack icon on the side panel to see your loot drops.

You've made 5 posts on your reddit account and they have all been complaining about certain things.. the hypocrisy is real.

Well I think it more speaks to the fact that he actually does indeed care.
---
If people are willing to play dwarf fortress in Ascii art, that's the true extent of "I dont care, i just care about the gameplay".
---
totally random
---
You can do whatever you want in the game. If you don't like Skilling to 99, you can always pvm or quest or just try to make as much gp as you can. The great thing about RuneScape is that you can play however you want to
---
Same with the new sword. The drain rate should be addressed as well.
---
I want to do the quest again but with the models unchanged :/ old lady michael jackson arianwyn and chernobyl elena were a big fucking mistake
---
I mean.. the XP is shit but I also hate mining and afk'd amethyst 92-99 at god aweful rates. I got higher mining rates doing this and made solid gp/hr and rolled on a cool pet. I'd do this any day over regular mining.
---
Lol.
---
"good job jagex"

not their fault lol

I hope this doesn't get me too many downvotes but I actually like the look of it.

i think these areas should not be multi combat for this reason exactly. way to OP.

Account only a few months old and you've been "hacked" twice?

 Don't buy accounts, and don't sign up for double XP you fuckin noob
---
bad bot
---
No it is reworking the model. Updating graphics isn't changing the base of a model to something that isn't even recognizable.

Oh fuck oh shit I have to do regicide, me1 and me2 before the revert
---
RS3 bad
---
Stagnation good
---
Yeah, I do wonder why it's only 20 cosmics and 100 of everything else there...
---
Kk thanks
---
Not even necessarily suffering. If I went to King Lathas to start the quest and the quest complete scroll came up it would be way easier but not fun at all. With no difficulty there is no reason to play.
---
If I cared about graphics there are plenty of other MMO's I could play instead. Again, I don't care that oldschool has graphics straight out of 2000's, I do care if new updates come with graphics that completely stand out from the rest of the game.
---
I mean it makes *some* money, but 100k an hour cutting yews isn‚Äôt exactly a lot lol
---
I get those 250k+ drops pretty commonly when I am not the MVP.  It might just be luck or maybe the loot scales down from who did the most to who did the lease damage and i just happen to be getting close to the most
---
Even more worrying is the fact that they're happy about the mistake.
---
play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
All I can think is it was a boss design that aimed originally to feel like a normal boss "yeh the guy who does most damage gets the loot". And when they fleshed out the mechanics and realised how it was team orientated and people would just wait to be able to do "damage" by mining and not help in any other way they opted to offer rewards to all and just a "better" reward to the MVP. 
---
Why no one stepped in and said "why not just do a raids like points system with drop weighting?" Is beyond me though
---
Yeah, it happens. I understand the frustration. Just being by myself then some guy comes up and does something rude, not caring about me, not wanting to care about me.
---
But Im putting effort into a more buddhist understanding. Seeing that this person is steeped in Dukkha (a spectrum of suffering, like a spectrum of color). Who am I to add to that Dukkha? To get annoyed is to put myself in more Dukkha. To get angry and lash out is to put myself AND them in more Dukkha. To be agitated enough to express my frustration to friends is to put myself AND my friends in more Dukkha.
---
So maybe Ill accept it, move if I need to. Maybe say something kind to them. Then I can move on, not creating more Dukkha, not creating a new suffering
---
I want to stick my peepee up the new agility course elf's butthole

---
I can look at it and say that's an elf. Before they looked like humans dressed in green. They didn't stand out as being different. Gnomes stand out, dwarves stand out, fairies stand out. Elves didn't, and now they do.
---
No your farming level has nothing to do with the seeds you get from bird houses, nor from birds nests as drops from trees.
---
At least in osrs you don‚Äôt ‚Äòwin or lose‚Äô because of good or bad rng.
---
&gt;You don't need to force the art team to do completely unnecessary graphical update tasks that everybody knows will look worse just to justify their existence.
---
agree with your post but you misunderstand the source of these graphical updates
---
the graphical updates come from the individuals in the art team
---
When construction was *first* created, they made possible the most famous bug in all of Runescape... The Falador Massacre. RIP all those poor souls that didn't bank their items and *incouraged* him
---
I'd say I prefer the current dragons to the original dragons if that counts. Though the level of detail on OSRS graphics are a bit beyond the 2007 era ones, but they work pretty well on non-humanoid NPCs like the Inferno Creatures. In general, I feel like simple 2004 style graphics are probably preferred more for Humanoid NPCs for consistency across races while more detailed graphics are more acceptable for monsters and sometimes environments.
---
Didn‚Äôt blur your cat, account gonna get hacked
---
Just use Runelite then lol. Runelite is the only way to play the games easily.
---
Hey mod west.  Ive said it once,  and ill say it again.  I love you with all my heart.  your a good mod
---
I'll be friends
---
Rhythm games, fighting games, fps, rts. Really anything. Even with tick manip RS really isn't that movement intensive. The real danger is in the repetitive motions and holding down keys, but that isn't really any more or less of an issue with tick manip. High level no honor bridding is the most apm intensive activity in the game and it requires zero tick manipulation.
---
Regardless of what you do, you should be taking regular breaks and doing hand stretches.
---
cant see all spellbooks
---
As someone at Level 99 in Fashionscaping, THIS. PLEASE. Those push me into the 200m XP range for bankstanding easily
---
Late\*
---
i do, send my your name :)
---
ive quietly wanted this for so long
---
the poll was to make a shortcut for underground pass after completing the quest. it failed, this is different and some real faggy shit to complain about.
---
Is that really gonna be that helpful? Why not just check the spellbook? If you don't have the spellbook unlocked, the wiki will tall you what runes are required?
---
The Grapes of Vorkath
---
Once you introduce competition a few will abuse mechanics to screw over everyone else for self gain. Looking at you tick miners at zalcano.
---
Cuz if you are not in the right spellbook and banking to gear for slayer/bossing, you can just go from bank to house and tp to boss since you now have the right runes
---
Patrick that‚Äôs not a ride!
---
Don't post here, contact support
---
Jagex can only take some blame for people getting hacked. Two thirds of it is down to your actions, buddy.
---
Because while skilling usually gives a constant amount of loot at generally lower amounts, PvM has rare drops that are worth tens of millions, which no skilling boss has
---
sorry for the harsh tone but it actually does look like trash, i'm actually more upset about all these new ugly armors coming into the game than i would with a new skill. crystal armor looks kinda bad and out of place... but this thing is just an abomination :(
---
why the fuck are there 2d models in my text adventure. this won't fly with the community, i bet the programmers will get a lot of mail about this one.
---
Pay devs 30k
---
It is just an order pulling error. People make mistakes all the time, it is not some robot pulling shit. Contact the store and let them know that what you bought isn't what you recieved. Any sane store will probably send you the correct item or ask to do a swap.
---
Alright you've done it. You won a battle of semantics for something that you yourself said you didn't even care for because you have to be "right" on the internet 
---
Congratulations
---
He's said one of the thing's he's most excited about, and why he wants to make the series as perfect as he can, it for people to be able to binge watch it once its completed. Now's a good a time as any. You get to binge watch it, but then you also get the anticipation for the next release like the rest of us! :)
---
Why'd you kill so many dark beasts?
---
Yeah so you‚Äôre saying if I‚Äôm doing a duo with someone and I do 49% damage and they do 51% then it‚Äôs fair that they will be guaranteed to get a drop worth 5-20 times more than mine?
---
My argument there would be that at gwd/corp when you kill the boss it doesn't drop loot for everyone who was fighting it, only 1 person.  At Zalcano it drops loot for everyone that was fighting it.
---
thanks ill call them now
---
I think the chat heads look a little rough but I absolutely agree with them for updating the elf models.  The old elf models looked absolutely horrible.  They're some of the oldest art assets from RS2 that hadn't been updated in any way.  And lets keep in mind how bad it would look to have Prifddinas, with all its new buildings and art, filled with a bunch of elves from 2004.

Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is gonna be running 3 Honda Civic's with spoon engines. On top of that he just came into Harry's and ordered 3 t66 turbo's with NOS's and a Motec System Exhaust.

---
High contrast *works* when defining certain shapes though (i feel like shape is another big proponent to osrs's feel)
---
Shayzien on the other hand goes way the fuck overboard for instance
---
But yeah- dragonstone and rune hovering around those "purple kourend catacombs/ diary equipment/ nuscape look" really didn't help lol
---
Does this mean that system apps will be removed as well ? In that case , it doesn't matter. Your phone wouldn't work.

‚ÄúThanks. I hate it.‚Äù

Maybe an auth delay would have saved him.
---
Over my 150 kills I can feel the way better loot when I do a lot of work, I think there's another impact as well besides MVP like a middle ground.
---
Additionally I have only gotten 6 mvps total and 2 of those were in a 4man the rest were 10 man-ish

Because PC is shit. After you get your elite why go back there‚Äôs not even a pet

Daum just late, I‚Äôm 10m from dragonhunter crossbow lol
---
No mate the discussion ended a while ago, I expressed my point was that your intentions were selfish, all your points still indicate your selfishness, that this game is only for ‚Äúthe real playerbase‚Äù those who have been playing from 2005. Oldschool can still be oldschool with new skills. Aodhan our

Questing has been my favorite thing in RS since I was a kid. I love the dialogue from the characters, lots of the conversations are genuinely hilarious. I tend to not use guides if I can help it so I can focus more on enjoying the story (only using them to see what items are required so I don‚Äôt have to get them later)
---
Every osrs meme literally starts here
---
Ha, knew it, I also use it
---
Man I see people at GE play that goddamn dice bot game and it pisses me off. It‚Äôs basically a trust game with fake dice rolls added in. One guy lost 10m because the ‚Äúbot‚Äù thought it was enough to log out. Was his while bank. I can understand people falling to luring, phishes, and even trade scams, but handing over your expensive items and gold to a random stranger is generally a stupid thing to do.

Yea casual

It's not that the better players get better rewards. It's just that the rewards everyone else gets are poop compared to them.
---
I really really really lime this gaaameee
---
Didn‚Äôt we pretty much confirm in this sub that everyone gets a pet roll, not just the mvp? I think someone else posted about this and a bunch of people jumped in saying they‚Äôd seen pets where the mvp didn‚Äôt get it. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but last I checked we hadn‚Äôt had confirmation from jagex but maybe I‚Äôve missed it
---
Your phone screenshot looks terrible try using the snipping tool
---
You need 75, not 90!
---
I hear this a lot from people. Have you ever considered that maybe you don't enjoy them because you are following a guide? Ticking tasks off a list is boring for everyone but an interactive storyline where you have to think of what to do next might be pretty fun.
---
Though I completely agree that people who perform better should get better rewards.
---
You could almost see the unregistered hypercam logo
---
This was me. Killed elementals in the workshop for weeks with a Gmaul. What a time.
---
QQ more
---
It is, and more efficient, I went from 65-72 mining getting the materials for 87 crafting, set me back about 2.5 mill though.
---
Offering a suggestion and constructive criticism isn't being unrelaxed, but thanks.
---
&gt; Though, as I think OP would agree with, I would be much happier if they just made the boss less rng heavy.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cja2ad/me_gauntlet/evc49ql/ this comment chain gets my point across better I think. People are seeing my mention of GP as though that's my issue and it's not.
---
You hit the nail on the head
---
I think saying ‚Äúnever update the models‚Äù is setting a bad precedent. They can update the models and still keep the outschool feel. Things like bandos chestplate fit old school and the design is awesome.
---
Unpopular opinion? I'd say human decency. 
---
The thing is, people can lose their heads when something they care about is coming out different than they'd prefer. Thus people tend to forget there are people behind the work spending their time and effort on the work.
---
Gonna mark a fat ass line under the fact that criticism is and should always be acceptable but going out and jabbing, calling them incompetent monkeys is a low blow imo *even* if they get paid for their work despite it's receival.
---
I'll happily play both and enjoy the best of both worlds. I'll also happily criticise the bad in both, and the utter fear of progress in this playerbase is both hilarious and saddening.
---
It wasn't made for op either though
---
It was made for all of us and anyone who wants to play. We all get a vote not just those you agree with
---
&gt; You cherry picked extremely old assets to prove your point
---
I cherry picked assets to exaggerate the gouraud shading while I was making a point about that style of shading being the stuff that blends models into runescape's world the best.
---
I even pointed out in a response that large models have the luxury of using triangle shading ALONG with gouraud shading on its large "detail-less" stretches, allowing things like demons and hillgiants to actually blend in
---
Looks better but I‚Äôd prefer this armor to just no exist.
---
Do you have to move around like that or is that just because he's tick manipulating and can't focus on falling rocks on his position as much.
---
Tbh if they removed the helm next to the game it would be better, way less toxic.
---
üéµ then I *jizzed* in my pants üéµ
---
Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt owe anything to you either. I‚Äôd say a graphical poll goes up and we‚Äôll see what the popular vote is.
---
Welcome to Brother Jared, my Holy Water and Monk Robes Entrana-locked Ironman
---
People complain way too fucking much with the "old school vibe" shit.
---
lmao, he is pissed.
---
Only the cicle jerk online here thinks like that though. I prefer all of the human models updated to elena's using the new proposed chathead of Elena as the chatheads.
---
Disagree. Tank armor should have value. There are some bosses in game against which proper prayer and movement let you take basically 0 damage (bandos, hydra, raids) and there are some that require you to tank stuff (vorkath, zulrah, gauntlet). IMO having some of each is good and not every boss should be 0 damage with good execution.
---
As someone who plays mobile 90% of the time now due to a very busy schedule, this would be a godsend. I get tired of closing my app to google left and right
---
Smart man, I'd willing to bet majority of the inferno capes in game are bought.
---
I disagree with the fact you can't buy Inferno cape. Fire/inferno cape should be tradeable imo.
---
Why not provide the information for players? Especially new ones.
---
You do you, but you shouldnt underestimate that 1 extra max hit, especially at low lvls
---
You just fucked them with this one
---
Ha could've been, my dude. when I was trying to recall his name all I could come up with was either axx or some sort of jumble of letters that didnt quite make sense. I remember he posted a picture once and he had long dark hair.
---
You‚Äôre getting really butt hurt because they changed the graphics for something, if we had to poll everything that was gonna enter the game down to the smallest details it would be too much voting and the game wouldn‚Äôt be balanced man. A small visual change isn‚Äôt a big deal.
---
It's just cosmetic, same as ironman armour
---
I wish you luck! MEP1 and MEP2 are still pretty aids even without the Agility obstacle... So try to speed through Regicide before Jagex listens to us.
---
New chatheads probably didnt make anyone quit
---
got the blade from regular
---
&gt; Cant we have a more complicated character than just the "he looks different so you know he is bad" trope?
---
Have you read the dialogue on almost every new OSRS quest?      
---
You'd be lucky to find a single character that has more depth than a bloody plate?
---
4 hours of quests? Underground pass alone takes 16 hours
---
Just wondering since I haven't played it yet, why wouldn't a huge mass be meta? Does it scale HP or are the rewards worse or something with more people?
---
Art is subjective
---
Some people like it and some people hate it
---
i'd hate if they made it look like more traditional oldschool content
---
I like it
---
I wanna he friends! My name is ezlevels12
---
You can also get stamina potions from Theater of Blood :)  some irons just rush through the first rooms to get to the first chest and buy out the like 8-13 stam pots then restart again
---
Since when do iron dragons drop Harpoons
---
please tell me you‚Äôre kidding, do you genuinely think fire capes and inferno capes should be tradable? i really hope this is bait
---
For example old school in 2014 had a downwards trend in players. Only updates saved this game.
---
Petition to increase every account's runecrafting by 1, so this guy can be happy forever after

Early-game cosmetic no one uses =/= Endgame cosmetic everyone uses.

You're comparing apples and oranges.

Thanks for the pile of teleport scrolls :)
---
And 49% quits the game
---
I liked gaining fingers over Southpark hands and the water moving. The game looks horrible but it is what it is for the gameplay it offers. I don‚Äôt get as upset as others when they do a graphical rework but at the same time if you were to log into rs3 you would see where stuff took a turn for the worst.
---
Everyone always wants that because humans are stupid.  Not just a kids these days thing
---
I haven't seen any confirmation anywhere, about pet rolls. I just woke up to that thread bashing on the MVP system and I don't want the devs to try to fix something that's not broken, and actually brings life to what will otherwise be just another wintertodt.
---
You can't really screw over your team at zalcano... either you do a lot of damage or you don't, there's no way to be a detriment to your team other than literally not attacking, which would only hinder your own chance at better loot in the first place.
---
This comment is disgusting, I am 150kc with only like 13m profit 75 mining dpic of course, and that's with an onyx drop.

---
I don't think you will ever get a definitive definition of what is "oldschool". Maybe it would be better to just poll graphical updates in the future.
---
I personally think those locations and the "new" dragons, giants, and demons are oldschool, but I certainly wouldn't oppose the monster graphics being reverted, or going back to old Varrock.
---
thats not back 2 back, still dope though.
---
This is either already dead content before it's even made, useless, or over powered. 
---
No need to boost dragon weapons like the crossbow another 10%...30% damage buff is absurd
---
Jesus christ this game is going downhill fast
---
Helllllllllll yes!!!!
---
I was so hype for the old dragon and old guard models when oldschool was announced... only to get the new dragons and new guards lmao
---
People would love it
---
It has 12 ranged strength so it should be able to kill anything provided you have enough of it
---
Which is sad because you do make so many valid points, people get close minded and I can confirm, I was one of them. All it takes is a bit of discussion, people shouldn‚Äôt jump down everyone‚Äôs throats without asking clarification, but I suppose it‚Äôs r/2007scape

That armour should be a gauntlet reward
---
Rsc revolution is considered a good version of the server with a fairly active community!
---
Oops, I saw 90 was mentioned for the XP rates so assumed it was 90 mb xD
---
so if they run a poll that doesn't pass you think it is worrying? silly logic. all that was said was "i thought the QOL stuff for them would pass" by one person.
---
How's that gonna work with people who've already bought it on the GE?
---
sheep shearer 2 please.
---
The fact that they thought this was OK in the first place is actually scary.
---
Someone at Jagex actually had to say "yep I think that's a good idea".
---
And people wonder why we sperg out when things are unpolled.
---
Realistically I‚Äôd say less than 5% would quit the game.
---
Mvp's make about double-triple the profit of regular players at zalcano. It's a shit system.
---
Consider that grinding a bond for multiple hours every two weeks will severely handicap your account progression. 
---
That being said paying 11 dollars is equivalent to like an hour and 15 minutes of a minimum wage job. This versus a possible 10-15 hour grind it seems easy to make a choice.
---
At level 100+ you can access money makers that can get you a bond in 2 or 3 hours or even less sometimes. Being a low level trying to make a bond makes the game work and not worth playing imo.
---
Let that be a lesson to you. 
---
*no one is safe*
---
Jk. Wuuuut
---
dying &gt;\_&lt;
---
Sometimes we still find exploits like that but they're rarely an early exploit. Every new device has new possibilities!
---
No, you just take the bait way too easy lmao
---
one of the most disappointing things for me recently was 4-5 live streams ago when they addressed prayer flicking and said that consider that viable game play.   
---
People being able to farm on end due to broken damage mitigation tactics is bad for the game.
---
Are you implying that people aren't progressing when they do quests guideless? Progress means different things to different people; how much you feel like you've "progressed" is 100% self-imposed. It's fine if you play to get the highest EHP or GP/hr, that's your prerogative but that's mind-numbing and boring to me. 
---
Do you play an ironman? If so, why? Why play an ironman when you can just play a normal account and do everything faster. That's the point I'm trying to make.
---
So everyone else is a keyboard warrior, because they assume the worst in people. But you don‚Äôt want warding because you‚Äôre literally assuming the worst in jagex. Do you see the hypocrisy? Because I do. How old are you? 17? Yeesh

The mainstream definition of "good graphics" is more detail = better, sharper image = better, and more vivid = better. The new osrs art style tries to do all of those things.
---
The old osrs art style didn't aim to be more detailed, vivid, or sharper. It aimed to be stylized and simplistic. It aimed for a timeless style and it's the style that we have a nostalgic connection to.
---
If you're seriously telling me that you can't tell the difference between the graphics of the inferno and the graphics of lumbridge, then you might have some serious problems with your eye sight. Except, you specifically contradict yourself in your very own post. Despite claiming that you don't see how the new terrain is different, you say that "a little sprucing up doesn't hurt." So if it's not any different than how could it be spruced up? I don't know why you're wasting your time and mine with an argument that even you know isn't true.
---
Lets put the bullshit aside and speak plainly. You like the new direction of the art style. You don't like the old direction. That's why you're making arguments that don't make sense and contradict each other to try to act like everything is fine. Let me be clear, you're entitled to your own opinion.
---
That being said, fuck your opinion. I don't give a shit what you think. This is a very clear shift in art style. This shift in art style should've been polled. Take it the polls, if 75% agree with you that the art style should embrace the mainstream definition of "good" then go right on ahead. However, if the poll fails, give us ACTUAL osrs graphics.
---
do it instead of complaining ?
---
i dont understand why different skills being trained at different rates is necessarily a bad or good thing? it just is, no?
---
If this was released in the original OSRS, no one cares.
---
So we‚Äôll call it 1/131k for the above.
---
Then do it. Pussy
---
Someone hire this guy! Clearly he knows the way
---
It's actually pretty easy to get 450k/hr+ with Oak doors, you need to zoom in all the way and place your mouse at the point where you can just right click/left click over and over to spam doors. You're also not supposed to make the butler grab the max amount of planks, I forget what the actual number is but it makes it so he just refills you then goes back for another trip. Also make sure you have the coin bag built to automatically pay your butler. There should be a video of this on youtube somewhere.
---
&gt;Adding skilling content that is **unlocked** beyond lv. 99
---
Made more useful- maybe. Unlocked? No pls
---
&gt;Adding more skilling methods that require collaboration with other players to strengthen community involvement within the player base
---
I like this. Maybe have beneficiary systems similar to how running ess automatically has, so players can get paid to essentially help someone. Don't make it an ingame system; simply allow activities to have this dynamic nature evolve into it (deliberately) created by players
---
&gt;Rebalancing current skills
---
Vague
---
&gt;Create a different polling system which allows players to try new skills without committing fully to a new skill
---
Too much work imo
---
Whats the difference between legacy mode and pre-eoc then?
---
Also the lil prayer bonus is useful
---
Where are you seeing him say that they're going to be changing anything?  All he says is they're going to review it.  They could review it and determine no changes are needed.
---
Beats what we have now lol
---
Nope, those numbers are actually low for oak doors.
---
You can probably tele to your house, switch spellbooks, and get back to a bank (~10 secs) in the same or less amount of time it would take you to look through the skill guides
---
The Gauntlet is currently my favorite PvM content in game because of how hectic the boss is. Every other boss after you know the mechanics becomes easy and afk, but with the gauntlet regardless of how many times you've done it, you still take damage and get smacked around a bit. I agree it is a bit annoying not running into the dark beast until the last 2 rooms, but in the regular gauntlet you can still get completions consistently even with spending extra time searching the outer rooms.
---
Damn, so nice to see people agreeing the osrs graphics is what makes osrs so damn good. I honestly don‚Äôt get why ‚ÄúHD‚Äù should have to be made, to me it‚Äôs what destroyed the game rather than EoC.
---
Bc regular players don‚Äôt skill much and all you‚Äôd be doing is giving the bot farms tons of free cash
---
I'd vote for a watered down Nex:AoD at the end of a godwars themed raid, it'd be legit. Although even normal nex has way too many bis drops for osrs currently.
---
I think that having exp rates and level unlocks separate is what makes a lot of the skills unique and more interesting and oldschool, compared to the alternative of "Always make the highest level because it's always the best."
---
Balancing skills in this manner (for buyables) gives a wider variety of items value, compared to immediate devaluing of lower level items.
---
Having commodities that are valuable for their exp rates, such as gold ore and grapes, are more interesting than only having runite and anglerfish being both the highest exp rates and producing the most useful item.
---
I think this can be agreed upon based on your opinion about fletching - It's a skill that can be trained to 99 in hours because it's a buyable skill and the highest tier item is the most efficient in terms of exp/hr, with the rest of the skill's items being extremely devalued. Compared to cooking or smithing, who have a cap of exp rates at a lower level, those skills take significantly longer and have more than one valuable item associated with the skill.
---
Also married, 30, 3 kids. She is 28 and plays too. I play for her and she plays for me lol
---
BRO THAT'S WHAT Y'ALL N**GAS FOR DOE.  not like they gonna use it in da game anyway. U do it.
---
Look at how mad he gets!
---
I just want osrshd. Hd models of the current build would be cool! As long as the design stays true to the original 2007 art work, I don't see why we shouldn't upgrade the models but upgrade what they ARE, instead of changing them entirely to do so.
---
u
---
This doesnt make sense I hate this joke U can get like 35 rc in 1 day hella easy smh virgins
---
looks fine to me
---
The only change I'd like to see is reducing the delay from eating food, personally. You can complete normal mode 100% of the time if you prepare fully. If you want to risk going in to the boss under supplied to try for a faster time, that's on you.
---
I think the rewards should be some profit consistently with the potential for a rare, very expensive drop.
---
Anything that gets people doing it again
---
It's a fun activity to fuck over people being inefficient.  Hop worlds and kill their birds.  Makes me laugh every time
---
My argument was never that the difference in rates was good or bad. I just wanted to understand the reasoning for it. My argument was that it seems odd that the best xp/h is a level 23 rune for runecrafting. Why wouldnt higher level methods be better xp? That would be the logical progression.
---
A lot of these skills need to be reworked for sure. I 100 percent agree with you, if you're not an iron PvM has made Skilling itself pretty much dead content. Nobody does it anymore they just pvm for money I saw a level 111 combat that had like 50s in fishing and cooking and 30s in everything else but pretty good gear.
---
I think they really have to change the death mechanics as well if they want bossing to be 5m an hour because you're right. Why do anything else for gold when you're literally risking nothing at all?
---
Games trending downhill in my opinion. but at least it's not rs3.
---
Except his argument was that the game should not be rng based in gauntlet, But Gauntlet is one of the more skill expressive bosses in runescape imo. Praying clearly helps, any boss can rng hit you high, if you have attuned armor then hunleff is not rng heavy whatsoever. And if you are going to mention that taking too much time, you can get attuned and just do rigour crystal bow perf with staff and kicking strat for quick kills still.
---
Honestly looks way better
---
That is a monstrosity, how on earth did the person who designed it think it looked good?
---
I did it the other day and hit 350K an hour but I wasn‚Äôt tick perfect. It‚Äôs all about how set up the butler and the ‚Äúbuild‚Äùor ‚Äúremove‚Äù option to where all you have to do is left click. 
---
I also just hold 1 the entire time because it makes a huge difference
---
But now the artists they hired gotta do something thats the problem -.-, they should send them to RS3 imo.
---
I feel like everybody forgetting the most important max cape..... The HAM max cape
---
This is a bit of a overreaction to a model change. Things change, get used to it.
---
False.
---
How you have time for that? Max i can get, is full t1 armor and t2 legs. Then last minutes fly by when i hunt for a t3 mob and fishing spots. 
---
I have failed the boss using this setup with 22 food and 2 t3 weapons (bow and staff). I made 2 mistakes by running through the chasing pillars and got hit twice. All the other damage was caused by the boss hitting throgh prayer. Corrupted seems too much RNG to do consistently
---
Let me remind you that it just happened to be the best back up file in 2007 to be restored as mentioned by Ash several times could have been 2008 scape if that was the file restored instead. The community also voted to have updates also speaking of entitled it sounds pretty entitled of you to assume that jagex would keep this game mode around if it was producing revenue for them. They owe nothing to you for that matter. Also exactly classic offered nothing because it wasn‚Äôt updated the game mode was exhausted and instead was a botted mess.
---
Yeah, but wouldn't this give players more incentive to skill? Also: is botting still such a big problem? What could jagex do to overcome this issue?
---
I would fully support reverting varrock to its older self, I never went to Canifis back then as I wasn't a member, and Dorgesh-kaan sticks out of the rest of the game.
---
My point was that the newer dragons/demons etc were basically made in anticipation of the 08 HD update, and continued to be used well past 2008. They were pretty much part of the HD update. I don't hate all of those models but I would support reverting them back to the pre-07 models in a heartbeat.
---
I think the reason Ironman is so popular is because of the GE. Before, self-sufficiency was a much bigger part of playing a main. There was a tradeoff and opportunity cost associated with making items for yourselves/getting them from shops and not wasting the time overpaying someone to get that niche item for you. Entire new forms of trade such as selling quest packs, which were sets of items people needed for quests, became a pretty popular and lucrative option. 
---
The GE really streamlines the experience of the game to do activity -&gt; instasell/buy on GE -&gt; go back to doing what you were doing. The old incentive for self-sufficiency evaporated and a lot of the interesting emergent gameplay that centered around peer to peer trade went away. 
---
Now, if you want to get the fully fledged self sufficient experience, you play Ironman. The GE + the existence of huge consistent money streams with slayer/PvM have really dumbed down the main meta, which makes Ironman way more appealing. The gameplay loop of a main is, at this point, do fastest possible training method -&gt; do vorkath/zulrah/raids for money. Its really not that enjoyable.
---
To this day I still wish they refined the trading post a bit more rather than introducing GE, but I also understand it's one of the more popular features that keep people playing. Im just a snooty hardcore player that likes his game a little inconvenient.
---
I guess I would need to see the literal rates and just how much more the MVP is getting over everyone else. But like...what's the issue here?
---
If you are still getting loot and your still getting a chance at the pet then it's fine? The tick miner is performing better and deserves the better loot and pet chance, your still getting loot and a pet chance and if you want to increase your odds then you should learn how to tick mine. Then you can compete and get better actively. The casual player is rewarded and is incentivized to get better but doesn't have to if they don't want to. It's literally a perfect system.
---
I see both sides of the argument. My one question is how did that affect your gameplay? Why is everyone over reacting to the graphic change? It may look silly/forced but freaking out like this is just not the answer...
---
Idk, for me I have an easier time taking a few weeks off RS, but I've taken Kratom or some kind of opioid every day the last year. Idk if you were being serious, but you got any advice?
---
They should just remove the armor entirely. There's no way they can make metal armor with large ugly purple crystals in it and make it look both good and give an osrs vibe.
---
Looks fucking awful
---
Theres so many monsters that hit through prayer...
---
While I think updates are important to this game, people always show this graph without superimposing RS3 numbers.  A large part of the growing playerbase in the past 3 years was from people switching over.  Which also explains how people get unironically upvoted to add summoning
---
Where did I say anyone was entitled to it? Its single cosmetic item to show-off a large accomplishment. This game has hunderds of uncessary cosmetic items that serve less of a purpose than these capes would as they actually indicate something
---
you must be fun at parties
---
Character be lookin like one of the balloons in the prison random
---
I watched my friend hit 100 combat and I also hit 90 combat in the legends guild basement training DEF with the iban staff. He told me the attack speed was faster than d long and he was right! (This was before whip and d scim existed)
---
If the community wants it, sure.
---
All you need to see if classic on its final year. A botted mess that had little to no actual players in it. Because the nostalgia wasn‚Äôt enough to keep that game mode alive.
---
We play Oldschool Runescape in large part because people do not like the updated, modernized art style of RS3. OSRS graphics get a large part of their charm from a minimalist design approach, these reworked characters do not fit that design.
---
There were definitely sheep involved
---
It has the same issues though- I outright prefer the design on the right tbh as like an ornate armor.
---
I don't like the cell shading attempted on new pieces; let the lighting engine do the heavy lifting on the gradiences.
---
I would need to be invited first my dude

You know the last shortcut is 89 not 70 right?

People love to complain and here it gets upvotes. That‚Äôs a win win for the type of people posting.

Honestly since your bank is so big I‚Äôd replace the whip with the tentacle and get a torture
---
Those virtual points do serve a purpose: if you find someone voicing an exact same opinion as yours, click that icon. The other option is seeing the same seven words repeated all over the front page again and again.
---
**New high fantasy armor**
---
Doesn't belong in osrs. The new crystal armor looks like shit. And the new metal armor with large ugly ass purple crystals thrown onto it looks like a 7 year old drew a villian from a cartoon on a piece of paper. An absolute abomination.
---
I'm a big fucking noob that came back to the game after mobile released, usually I go against the grain but even I am 100% with this. It's like if Minecraft or TF2 got a graphics update, it just doesn't feel right and frankly I don't understand why Jagex is trying to force this on us. Fucking spheres instead of cubes in Minecraft, monkaS
---
Clickkbbaittttt
---
When you hear somebody say vanilla oldschool is better tell them to shove their runelite up their hypocritical asses
---
Failed 5 times at 77 agility. Hope I was just unlucky and it's not actually that high of a fail chance
---
Yeah have the worlds catherby doesnt even have people fishing... I remember in high school having some really fun conversations there.
---
Unfortunately this game has become a solo efficiency simulator. Makes me sad.  I literally dont even have friends on my friends list I chat with people when I see them talking otherwise I'm just by myself playing this game. It's so different now that Skilling is useless.
---
That is an incredibly ridiculous thing to say, I was hoping that wasn't the point you were trying to get across.
---
It seems kind of hypocritical though for players to claim to like osrs despite its old graphics, only to then turn around and chastise the developers for making effort.
---
&gt; Do you or do you not care?
---
I do care. Therefore,
---
&gt; and don't care what the gear shifter looks like
---
This statement is now incorrect.
---
Simply put, there are other ways to implement rewards for performance.
---
That answers your question but if you're looking for examples, surely you can imagine a system where loot is awarded according to damage dealt either linearly or by meeting damage thresholds where the players that do the most damage are rewarded the best?
---
Consider a Zalcano fight where there are 10 players, and 4 of them have crystal pick, use tick manipulation, and play identically tick-perfect. Why should only one of those 4, who all clearly outperform the other 6, have a chance at the pet and the other 3 do not?
---
shit, let me know what that's like
---
Mission accomplished.
---
And this time started at account creation right? So that would include time at tutorial island and then buying the supplies?
---
[Oof](https://i.redd.it/whn74rjm88d31.png)

I picked Rune Gloves because they were closest and Barrows to show the strongest one of the RFD Gloves.

Yeah he even deleted his posts.

Nice one /u/AodhanMacC. I guess you really were mad
---
I am the senate
---
Try 99 crafting
---
Then at minimum it still requires Prif.
---
Are you trying to imply I'm smuckers right now?
---
The quest was epic!
---
It would have been nice when I wanted to plan my Seren kill. Of course I knew when I switched spellsbooks (or from checking the wiki) but still.
---
While simulataneously jumping the target to rain arrow fire down their spine.
---
The new art looks great. Old stuff by comparison looks shit. 
---
Osrs already has mid-update level graphics (see varrock guards) and this is way better than anything past jagex has done. 
---
Preserving nostalgia is not worth staying stuck in the past. Just because people don‚Äôt like rs3 doesn‚Äôt mean a completely different team will make the same mistakes.
---
Lol good question
---
Definitely the temple knights. Slug menace is such a low level quest but it's an awesome quest line.
---
I feel like this would cause issues with mobile development.
---
are you not?
---
If you quit over this type of an update odds are we dont want you in the community anyway my dude
---
pvpers aren't the only people getting spite voted on content you know? Theres just as much spite coting going on from them as well. I am sad to see the mods pretty much ignoring the state of pvp though. Lots of people play for the pvp in the game and they get absolutely zero content updates/ fixes and such. Only thing pvp players really had to look forward to was DMM and thats gone now too/ being reworked.
---
Idk what that means, but that‚Äôs insane
---
ü¶Ä August 27ü¶Ä

Wow
---
RC 1-77: Ourania
---
77-??: Blood
---
??-99: Soul
---
RC has such low variety. Slayer requires you to get a new task, each one has its own location, weakness to combat style, gear setup, prayer setup, chance for drops, some AFK some not, etc.
---
For example I got a skeletal wyverns task after a while and I had to go back and research how they attack, and figure out a good range setup after using melee on my previous tasks.
---
Which isn‚Äôt a very high bar to begin with yet somehow they managed to make a worse one
---
one thing i do miss from RS3 is the customisation
---
My guy, I‚Äôm happy to leave everything I have up here. I have not deleted anything
---
Yes, I do. Most of them were worthless as they were repeats of the same 3 opinions. Personally, I hold the moderation team accountable for not providing a sticky for the discussion.
---
&gt;What benefit would this provide that the wiki or Google won't solve?
---
Having the solution to an in-game problem be solved in-game.
---
Where my winterthots at
---
How bout we pick both because they are both valid points as to why the new models are ugly.
---
No one cares
---
Was a joke lol
---
Holy shit, Exercitum Militus of Honorum was my clan back in the day...
---
Not every day that I log in and see a photo that brings me back quite this hard...
---
Thanks for posting!
---
Thanks for the tips, checked and it says i'm fine. Ran some scans and i'm all good. waiting on hearing back about my email. Jagex has sent a password reset.
---
I've tried playing a few times since coming back to OS. Ignoring the fact the the UI is a fucking mess and the combat is bad. The game gives me a headache just from looking at it, I can't play for more than 15 minutes without having to log off.
---
I liked the first graphical updates, it was an exciting project as a kid, as long as they don't go away from java, it's fine.    
---
It was their initial intent at graphics when moving to RS2, I remember hearing about that stuff back in 2003.    
---
The elitism of OSRS is really shitty. I wonder how many of you actually played Runescape before the miniclip explosion in 2007 or whatever and know what you're talking about, and how many of you just like to rebel against anything you can.
---
Is it really a problem?
---
Oh yeah ToB I mean.
---
Its not that i dont like them i just dont like how there all different sizes
---
Little late to the party here but I think it definitely helped get new people back into the game, that's at least how they got me back after playing OSRS just a few months in 2015
---
but what if im not switching just checking
---
66.4% =/= is not massive majority
---
why do you want chores so bad, legit question. Is it just nostalgia?
---
Hard part gives you five daily teleports to the farm patch, the medium part gives you three as i said above.
---
Todd
---
They didn't, he's just bad at flicking
---
I pretty much agree, some of them could just use a few small changes. Like their proposed new-new Elena chathead looks better than the original definitely. Arianwyn is a mess, but the other ones are all pretty fine. The elf models themselves are awesome all-around.
---
Fortunately I‚Äôve got all those done plus a small handful of members quests.
---
It's a good revision but it doesn't solve the problem that the initial design doesn't fit the game
---
Unpopular opinion, change everything (future and past updates) to how it looked when RS HD was first released.
---
IMO that was peak aesthetics for RS
---
Some of them look good, some of them don't. Arianwyn and Elena look terrible, but I think Baxtorian looks great and even has an OS feel. Eluned, Iowerth, and a bunch of the others look really good, but are way too clean so they just don't fit the aesthetic. 
---
I think Zalcano and Hunllef are fantastic and spot on with look and feel.
---
Ah I see you also hate the dirty Al Bheds.
---
People want new shit in the old style, is it that hard to grasp? 
---
New content. Old look.
---
Played with a VPN for a while and never had an issue.
---
ü¶ÄAugust 27ü¶Ä
---
That's a relief, you never know man some people are dumb as fuck
---
I disagree. What they are doing is very good. I think in order for this game to grow we need to get better graphics. This game would be 10x better with higher quality graphics. The reason I left runescape was because of EOC. I would be playing RS3 right now if it weren‚Äôt for that and mtx.
---
So do I. So many goals I have yet to accomplish, yet they're always fun when I finish them.
---
Honestly only the ironman modes are keeping osrs alive. Everyone i know only play the game for the ironman experience since the regular grind gets so tedious. Why would you kill a new boss that is 800k/h when you can do vorkath for rest of your life.
---
Nah I don‚Äôt delete that‚Äôs why I was like I guess he did
---
They really need to fix this :(
---
Edit : maybe add two dragonstone for the family jewel and a big uncut one for the rest
---
Revert the elves to fit the game*
---
Ftfy
---
It's not jewelry, It's weaker than the RFD version of itself while also being tradable so it will be lost in PVP due to it's high price instead of just breaking like Barrows Gloves would (which is what you'd use, not Rune Gloves). In addition, the reason why I mention it's unstable is that it's not even buying for 6m right now; It's likely going to go down yes but it's price will still 100% be higher than 2m because of the low chance of getting it while also being locked behind prif and untradable items.
---
Yeah I mean, the new elf models are just terrible
---
TOB looks great and would not like to have it changed at all. Inferno looks dope too. It‚Äôs only a few updates that look completely out of place and rs3.
---
More like 73000%
---
That's a fairly recent update tbf
---
muh skillcap
---
Yeah i totally love right clicking every single pile on the ground while looking for the drop I'm hoping for or trying to remember which seed is worth picking up
---
As long as they don‚Äôt change combat and introduce mtx that‚Äôs fine by me
---
Swamp Man Fake!!!
---
Playing with a vpn while at tutorial island or in the first hour will in most situations cause this to happen.
---
I largely agree but there are some exceptions,  such as runelites clue scroll mechanics
---
I'm sure they will make some tweaks to the way it looks it seems the general outlook on the armor is negative
---
Wholesome Comment.
---
Wanna know how I got these trims?
---
Yeah agility is fine, RC is slow (at my level anyway) but honestly folks
---
How about thieving?
---
Lmao basically. I'm pretty sure a good chunk of them spite voted warding in return which made it all that much better. Now, people are hopefully starting to realize where all this spite and self-centered attitude is getting them.
---
This makes me moist.
---
I dont know terminology, but I do know that when 25% of votes win, its fucked
---
honestly no ???
---
72 slayer unlocks wyverns. Those can be killed off task and after a couple hundred kills (can even be safe spotted) yields really decent gp. 75 is gargoyles which can be afked and can yield 600k gp an hour. You're almost there bro.
---
Thank u
---
Ive pointed this out to a few mods. Curse finally answered that theyre aware and a fix is incoming
---
I quit once few a bit when they removed free trade because it killed f2p clan fighting.  Quit again when they updated rune armor because fuck me that was an eyesore
---
You're killing it. The shape scaling example is something in particular that i've felt is a huge problem that i havent been able to put to words yet.
---
loving the copy paste dragonstone heart
---
Things i miss about rs3:
---
1. Daily events like penguins or evil trees etc. I dont do them often but it is nice to have, an alternative to the boring conventional way of skilling.
---
2. Summoning. Yes i know people gonna bitch about them, but i enjoy having yaks etc. Maybe dont need that much space and the scrolls, but some passive abilities are sweet like unicorn etc. 
---
3. Lodestones. Gives both new and old players way to teleport to different area of runescape. Maybe can restrict to the common areas like vrrk etc.
---
4. Ancient prayers. Turmoil is a blast to play with, but may be too op haha.
---
5. Some updates like bonfire, resting options, clue reward reroll etc.
---
[Are you thinking of this?](https://i.vgy.me/Zpycz9.png)
---
The pathing makes avoiding the squares on his last 1/4 HP quite annoying for me. If you have some tips I‚Äôd be grateful.
---
&gt; to literally be a version of the game from ~15 years ago
---
That's not really the purpose of Old School. It's a re-imagining of RuneScape built off the 2007 engine. I like new content coming to Old School, but I agree the new models don't match.
---
Yeah there's a balance between something being challenging and just being frustrated. I immediately fell in love with the gauntlet, one of the most fun things added to the game, but after my first and only Hunllef kill I walked away from it. That bullshit at the end just isn't fun to do. Demonic Gorillas feel like the exact right amount to need to think about during a fight in order for it to be challenging but easily manageable and still fun, and that boss is gorillas plus hitting through prayer and multiple floor obstacles. It's too much.
---
&gt; Can we be 100% sure that this effect isn't simply due to people seeing new styles, when they've been looking at the same styles for years? 
---
... **Yes?**
---
We get updates that don't *look OSRS* but they fit in over time.
---
Diary armors still don't fit, pets of high detail bosses look super-imposed on the game, slayer helm/ serpentine helm/ zulrah blowpipe look whack in a lot of instances
---
You can't really bring this up when the new armor is a straight departure from any established themes or styles. You can use that argument in minecraft for when they for instance add a new form of colourable block (hard clay; "it's not like the classic wool!")
---
But there would be *not confusion* on something NOT FITTING in Minecraft if it had HD textures and was **round**- totally different from the consistency of the rest of the game.
---
swap void melee helm for barrows gloves, use a ranging pot since you use super combat,

I mean, war crafts design for elves is pretty generic high fantasy tbh. Until you get into the semantics of actually night elf,  high elf,  blood elf culture.  Looking like a drow elf with armour that shows form over function doesn't mean that lord iorweth == malfurion stormrage.
---
The reward is the journey ü§ó
---
Yes, I'm aware of that. The whole point is that this sub is hypocritical as hell when it comes to styles of play. Like imagine if this meme had the roles reversed with the EHP player as the chad and fashionscaper as the virgin. It would get downvoted to oblivion even though the punchline is exactly the same; shitting on people who don't play the way you like to. It's like everyone buys in to the "everyone better than me is a nerd/has no life" mentality.
---
So we should just get rid of tick manipulation all together. Tick eating, combo eating, 3 tick fishing mining woodcutting, 2 tick woodcutting, 3 tick hunter. Everything that rewards you for more effort should be removed right or just that one because you can‚Äôt be bothered to try a little harder.
---
&gt; closed minded hothead
---
you're the one throwing insults around constantly.
---
You sound like you have had 0 fun or friends in your entire lifetime, but try to picture having a fun discord call with your friends and stupidly joking about checking if a common gold selling sites name is available, and accidentally clicking the confirm button and your Username changes. I have never RWT or done anything against the rules. I just wanted to know if a username could get you banned.
---
NO MVP IS A LEECH
---
Do get his point though that the same people saying "quests should be hard" are also almost certainly following a step by step guide for every quest to specifically make it easier for them. 
---
I'm not even saying that hypocrisy is wrong lol, just that the dude does have a point. The Cheetos bit kind of detracts from it though...
---
As someone who doesn't use the sand casino, those jumps are the closest thing I'll get to a gambling dopamine rush.

You probably feel "insulted" by someone telling you that your breath smells like an ass.

Close your mouth if only jackshit comes out, thank you very much for your effort, just shave ur neck.

Thanks very much =)

&gt; I'm nervous because my RSN is a god damn gold selling sites name

Why would this make you or anyone else nervous though?...is there a real that says you can't have your name the same as a gold selling website?? If you aren't RWTing then you have no reason to be nervous lol. But here you are nervous and, on top of that, you're getting so defensive too! :) We get it though! You're innocent!! Lmao
---
if a npc's combat level is too far above you I believe the default settings require you to rightclick to attack them. All that being said auto-retaliate will do the same thing if you have it on. Don't feel too bad about being lost as runescape is pretty overwhelming at first. If you're going to keep at it you should know there is a bank in the top floor of the castle you respawned in and that when you die your items fall to the floor and stay there for one hour of in game time.
---
But why are they? I don't get it that you call it a boss and then make a minigame.
---
Lots of people buy them.  If you live in a major australian city, someone can drive across town and do it for you on your computer.
---
They are when op is in the group only he can get mvp no one else.
---
Nah December 10th 2007 fucked the game, EoC was just pissing on a rotting corpse
---
Word that makes sense. Wonder if they‚Äôre gonna stabilize. I‚Äôm not gonna complain if 150gp laws is the new norm.
---
Yup, EOC marked the start of some pretty bad UI design and being bombarded by needless UI constantly - treasure hunter, subscribe button, constant events and mini-events, then even moving critical game features out of NPC dialogue or in-world interactions to some backwoods menu option.
---
If the crystal tools were rare enough they would be worth millions wouldn't they?
---
What is the polling system supposed to be then lmao. He exercised his right to influence the game by voting no. If we were supposed to just trust jagex we wouldn't have polls.
---
I think future content should be showcased more pre-launch for input from the community but reworking old content from a visual stance is a waste of dev. time. 
---
I‚Äôd much rather see actual content worked on.
---
Yes sir i did! :)
---
But then you get the shit loot compeared to the other guy too.
---
Truly im not trying to insult you, but if confuses me greatly you being 0-30 against hunleff. If you are just trying to get kills on the board I would recommend getting attuned armor, and double perf, i go with a single potion. If I go for that setup I walk in with an extra minute pretty much every time. Still experimenting with different amounts of armor. This boss to me is super interesting all the ways you can go at it. 
---
I would recommend just learning the sounds of the attacks and counting them in your mind, its all I do at hunleff. It seems that his lightning spawn counts as an attack rotation as well. I think if you just pray right 60% of the time with full attuned armor, you will get the kill as long as you focus on not getting hit by late fight lightning. Counting your 6 attacks also helps (swaps after every 6 i believe)

With the new update on RS3, a new island was added and it features an agility course all around it. It sets you up for peeking around the island and seeing what it has to offer, tracks your completion time and lap count, rewards you every lap with pages to unlock abilities and you also get to take the course in either direction to keep it fresh.
---
I think these are both well thought out courses with the idea of adding some form of entertainment value to agility.
---

He probably high on farts again. Dont mind him.
---
When equipt the gauntlets add high alch to any spell book. Gold scales would be needed to charge the gauntlets, but you still need fire and nature runes to cast high alch like normal.
---
I imagine jagex doesnt want a player to have a gold selling site as a players username. I dont want to have the name. I just want to know if a username can get you in trouble. That's literally all I asked.
---
Take your detective hat off and just listen to what I am saying.
---
Only time I care about efficiency is when it‚Äôs a skill that‚Äôs costly or not the funnest to level.
---
Examples prayer training without cash can be exhausting if I bring my bb or drag bones to a house it‚Äôs take less time to train and back to fun stuff.
---
Also runecrafting. I did the quick and easy tiara earth runs and I‚Äôll never look back at those 30 levels. 
---
RC bad
---
No just a statement: you‚Äôre just as bad for arguing with me online you clown lmfao we‚Äôre both arguing over the same graphical update you‚Äôre just on the side that supports it, learn how to actually argue and defend points btw
---
Crystal armour seems useless rn.
---
Just saying that vorkath with shit gear is also not amazing.
---
If you say so. I'm only concerned about group settings.
---
I wish they would go back to the better looking graphics of osrs before eoc.
---
Opposed to not having one irl i can see why
---
I personally like both options but I can understand why option 1 might a bit unfair (you can pick your mutagen).
---
It become so much more worthwhile at higher levels that the early level slog is considered worth it. If you just try to do all you combat training through slayer it feels a little less depressing IMO.
---
Hard to hire highly competent people for a 20 year old game making 35K a year in an area that has a high cost of living. 
---
I don't think the OSRS art style is taught anywhere and runescript is private... not to mention this game was revived from the dead.
---
All anyone can do is try with something as old as OSRS.
---
if you 4 man zalcano you'll basically have 4x the gp/h but about the same pet chance (if everyone is same stats and nobody is tick abusing)
---
Oh yes im sorry, it would be much better of me to simply hurl insults, that would be the mature, effective thing to do right.
---
Yes this ^
---
And my friends keep telling me "I don't give a fuck about lore who carez about the elfs fuck it i'm not scared of RS3" and I'm like "you don't know how history works..do you."
---
I think you might be projecting
---
I agree, I fucking hate the pub in osrs, fucking stupid and it wasn't polled
---
except I'm not arguing in favor of anything. I'm arguing that you nerds freak out too much because you do. This game isn't my life but it very much is for a healthy portion of this sub and \*THAT\* is the only problem that actually matters.
---
What about zulrah/vorkath/revs and thirdparty clients?
---
Something akin to the Smoking Kills dungeon from 2008 could be nice if the 4 minibosses were refightable.
---
1.5t then.
---
I guess ur dad doesnt like nerds
---
Go submit an issue for it over at their github.
---
I never said the game was shit. Only questing.
---
That's not true. It works for them.
---
Dude, the issue is over the art style. If the mods hadn't screwed that up, this whole discussion wouldn't be happening. Most people understand that the game needs updates or it will die.
---
Same here, the armor rework came shortly before eoc and that was when i quit aswell. Altho i did log in once after eoc just to see how it worked. My next login since was to transfer rs3 to osrs gp when osrs came out.
---
I don't think it would be unreasonable for a portion of the art team to be allocated to a project like this, as the community is very passionate about retaining the oldschool style. This wouldn't require dev resources at all, so it would have minimal effect on the creation of new content.
---
wait i havent played today since ive been at work, what changes did they make?
---
Wait, wasn‚Äôt it polled as being better than Seers? I was really looking forward to doing 80-90 agility somewhere different than Seers üôÅ
---

It really is more rewarding using no guides or at least until you get completely stumped. Figuring out the little riddles by yourself is fun.

---
Also good way to get locked out of the universities internet access
---
This bonehead keeps replying the same thing, it's obvious you are playing the wrong game bucko. Also it's pretty FUGGEN IRONIC you mention complaining cus it's all you seem to be doing. You should be more thankful to these so called nerds because they keep making you look good (or at least that's what you think). Classic Internet white knight tough guy donkey brain
---
Not always possible. In my area that's the fastest you can get from any provider.
---
I‚Äôve never seen the word ‚Äúderivation‚Äù in my entire life.
---
Well, as of now, yes. I would rather have it removed as it's against the spirit of a team skillboss.
---
Same. But those light puzzles are pretty tricky unless you have a map in front of yourself.
---
That can be boosted from 84, the only reason for &gt;85 agility is the cape
---
nah screw that, im almost certain 90% of people thought they were hideous as soon as they saw them. dont need to be a "sheep" to see it.
---
&gt;Incinuating those were my intentions?
---
THATS THE ONLY THING YOUVE DONE what do you mean intentions its all youve been doing. Muppet.
---
PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS!!!! I always have to google the correct runes for each spell when i need to cast something!!!

I'm fucking dying over here, also shit why didn't I notice it before. I fucking knew it was something. LOL literally looks like a 1:1 copy but put into osrs art converter 
---
OMFG LOL, they fucking need to start polling new items design, I swear to god hahahha
---
Wear it and autochat btw, nerd
---
Mhmm figures you can‚Äôt keep up a debate. One can argue allowing 2 and 3 tick skilling is a group setting because once again me putting in more effort has rewarded me with better xp an hour than people who choose not too.
---
I recently bought a Fire HD 8 on Prime day to use as an OSRS machine, and it's been good so far. You need to download some apks to sideload Google play store but that's about it.
---
It does get a bit choppy sometimes if you are running around loading stuff, but I mostly do afk skilling stuff and some Slayer on mobile, everything else needing more precision I still use Runelite.
---
You can't stop clue solvers

Rs3 has them because they don't interact with the client itself they just read what's on the screen

You get it, i spend so much of my time in the wildy, Castle wars, chilling while fishing with people  minigames etc. Meanwhile i also progress in the game while having fun

This was all changed pre-EoC. You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
No problem! We've been expanding a lot recently. People seem to like it there. If you do pop by tell em Rude sent ya
---
idgaf about elves but i do agree that it looks too updated compared to alot of models.
---
They're doing more than you. You are the leech. A team of all 1.5t people would collectively generate more loot per hour than a team of none 1.5t people. If there was a group of 10 people tick manipulating and you joined them you would be better off than being in a group of 10 none tick manipulating people.
---
Hey is that an emojji I see you using there? üòÇ
---
Hell yeah.
---
Isnt there only like 4 artists?
---
Nah dude fuck you.
---
Yeah that's mostly why I take it, a lot cheaper than  Suboxone for me. It doesn't really get me high or anything now so I don't necessarily have that mental addiction that I get with oxy where I get sad thinking about the fact I can't take it if I get sober, it's just the physical withdrawals that keep me from stopping. I appreciate it bro, I hope you're doing well
---
You might like my strategy of waiting for hardwoods to grow then doing trees, fruit trees, and hardwood all at once every 3-4 days. Takes longer irl time but you can spend less game time playing a skill you don't like. (or at least it feel like less time bc you're doing it less often.)
---
What do you mean? Do you have any link showing pre/post changes?
---
I went to Zalcano yesterday and left after not even getting loot from a kill. I could already tell where it was going when I saw people with crystal pickaxes and shit.
---
It feels like being one of those noobs who were attacking Revenants with their lvl 70 ranged dps and basically just speeding up the GP/hr for other people with better stats.
---
the only spec wep to use when released was a DDS  that would get really boring, really fast
---
luckily that's only your opinion.
---
RSHD started the downfall of runescape.
---
It does not, my question remains unanswered.
---
What‚Äôs the rs3 thing that is next to NMZ?
---
I'm going to complain about this post.
---
Thanks pal :D
---
62 agil for UP is like getting 70 atr/str for vampire slayer.
---
but that's not always the case, you just pointed that out yourself. naturally when you're in the skill guide checking out spells (especially ones on other spellbooks) you'd want to know what it costs to cast them.
---
everyone saying "just check the spellbook" no. one the spell isn't highlighted so you have to spend time searching for it, two there are 4 different spellbooks in the game which doesn't work for that reasoning, which leads to point three that it would then force you to either google it or change your spellbook to check. 
---
big inconvenience easily fixable with a small update. devs could simply use the same menu style applied to the construction skill guide
---
God nightmare zone is such fucking arse, why is it even still allowed to be in the game in its current state, like what the fuck even is this random shite outside yanille.
---
give me hd graphics
---
I'd love a little blocker dude
---
Really a morphing pet where you unlock the varients from the minigame would be dope
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Yeah? Ive seen guys around 60 get double rolls like crazy lately. Averaging about 3 chests a trip. Void 82rng/78mage.
---
My thoughts exactly hahaha
---
Did a forum mod give you a ban and lock your thread?
---
Why is this particular poll a plurality? It should be consistent
---
You're not always on the right spellbook and you wish to know the runes before you swap your spellbook.. for example
---
I don't agree. He might've had good motivations in freeing Seren but going too far is what makes him a bad guy. Yeah, Baxtorian sucks, but Iorwerth killed his mom to start the whole thing. Idk how anyone could say he was morally ambiguous when he held an elf kid hostage to get what he wanted.
---
Hahah. I'd do the quest when you have time to actually enjoy it anyway. If you followed the story so far it's really enjoyable
---
Thats funny as fuck haha
---
Gross.
---
Agility courses could do with variety, maybe alternate, branching paths you could take on the course itself to mix things up every now and then. That way you don't get burned out or bored too easily. Something like the Brimhaven Agility Arena comes to mind, but extrapolated to a course. Prif is the perfect opportunity to do this.
---
Lol
---
That's true, you get shards from the gauntlet, and the blade of saeldor and armor seed is a lot more expensive than zulrah uniques, however a gauntlet kc takes about 5x as long assuming 2 minute zulrah kills and 10 minute gauntlet runs. Because its still very new content the prices of the items are going to drop quite a bit, granted the blade will still remain a high price considering its a bis. So if you include uniques for both, yea gauntlet is prolly a bit better gp at the moment IF you get a unique, but each kill count is also 5x longer for gauntlet than zulrah + prices will fall a lot for at least the armor seed as time goes on. From my experience with the Gauntlet I personally think it needs a little buff to the drop table, but even if that doesn't happen I'll likely keep doing it though because its fun and I desperately need that pet.
---
Going to have to take my time anyways it‚Äôs too difficult having some sort of guide open and Rs at the same time on mobile so I‚Äôm doing it blind
---
It usually always comes up for me when I'm about to switch to Lunar's and I plan on using a teleport from that book as soon as I switch to it, but can never remember what runes it cost.
---
There's ways around this like just googling the runes needed, but IMO they should add it for consistency, since things like construction have it for the same reason
---
You completely missed his point, which was that by polling the content, people would be less resistant to whatever changes passed the poll since the community had input. By just changing what they want without community input they are just asking for backlash.
---
Yes I would quit.
---
I truly don't understand why anyone could be mad at a graphical update... It literally changes NOTHING about the game play \*smacks forhead\*

To be fucking fair, back in actual 07 I bought my first dragon chainbody. Decided to try underground pass and I fell in the grid trap and died and quit for like a straight week.
---
Why is the agility buff being polled? The course is exactly as good as it was polled at.
---
Not quite true, new models that were released in osrs were also in it. Those models couldn't have existed from 2008
---
The problem isn‚Äôt whether or not it was posted here before. The problem is that it wasn‚Äôt yours to post it all. And you call yourself an Ironman. Smh.
---
The problem isn't the 1.5 ticking, it's the disproportionate increase in reward for 1.5 ticker (&amp; MVP) and the decrease in reward for people not 1.5 ticking. Make better mining generate additional reward without removing reward from others, and make it 5 top players get extra reward, with everyone capable of getting pet.
---
Imagine not getting 99 smithing with just cannonballs
---
We dont deserve these high quality memes
---
If they quit that easily runescape doesn't need those players. A huge huuuuge detriment to the feel of many, many games is catering to everybody instead of the fans who will stick around for eternity
---
Don't believe me? Look at bioware blizzard and rs3. Sure they have more players today. None of the modern games are recognizable
---
Don't be a scrub

you forgot the part where you claim your 1-50k reward

Construction for that inf house tele.

Or crating for that quick banning.
---
your RNG is kinda meh, but keep on pushing you never know when you get a string of good loot.
---
Yeah, settle man. It‚Äôs a game,  models change. If a facial model really upsets you this much... eesh calm down. Breath and realize it doesn‚Äôt personally affect your life. Just a slight change. -_-
---
Am I the only person who thinks updating graphics and keeping the look of old school dont have to be mutually exclusive? 
---
Yes I am aware engine work would be a thing.
---
Welcome to this subreddit.
---
probably because its a 3way option - do you want option A, B, or C.
---
I see....I guess that makes sense?   
---
though, construction has it because that's the only way you can figure out mats as far as I know?
---
I feel you dude
---
It was stupid those ez scape (not QOL) were on the poll at all
---
I personally like osrs because it's easier on my computer and my eyes. I'm fine with the updates but I know some people aren't
---
üëç dont have enough coin to do better bosses so trying to make some here
---
OH. Aight. sure.
---
Pick flax
---
Sorry, what or who is auguste?
---
I seriously will never understand how people can keep complaining about old school aesthetics when you have a client plugins that add so many modifications to the game
---
I think this looks pretty dope, and I started rs2 in 2007. 
---
You guys just like to bitch, dragon platebody looks way worse.
---
And you both missed my point which is that it doesn‚Äôt matter if they poll every single aspect of the game, this community will roast them no matter what.  Developing for this game is a massive headache because of that.
---
we should have more nerfs imo, like nerf some item so other items get more useful, like changing the meta from time to time
---
Have you tried hotspots/data?
---
That has saved me a multitude of times from shitty landline internet b4
---
I think big inconvenience might be a little bit of a stretch, but I mean I'm not opposed.   
---
I've just personally never had a situation where I've needed this.
---
Pls buff gauntlet rewards
---
Sure is!
---
I got my first one in 15 years a few months ago, went to the online store and bought the keychain as a reward.
---
Twelvey12 cc is good. Might see the occasional weed reference but that‚Äôs it.
---
They will learn by trying at a low level and failing. I'd prefer that kind of experience rather than being locked behind a quest because of a skill req.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs orange.
---
That being said, depending on stats, specifically at vorkath there is some debate on this 
---
Essentially, you have to consider def bonus as less hits = means DPS while not eating 
---
So consider that as well :)
---
I think it depends more on the area than the company
---
If the area doesn't have the infrastructure to support faster internet there's really not much the internet provider can do besides start building better infrastructure.
---
You guys need to focus on removing Zalcanos ‚ÄòMVP‚Äô mechanic and changing a number of things in ‚ÄòThe Gauntlet‚Äô.

These changes being polled are so minute and kinda boring.

This npc has had the new chathead graphics for a long time.
---
Was a joke though.
---
Seriously, the first clip of the gauntlet I legit thought it was a clip from rs3. Shits so far from os its not funny.
---
Because a significant part of the game is the lore. If it was only gameplay that mattered, you'd be playing with all blank white textures.
---
The fact they looked at the rs3 models to get ideas from bothers me. Especially with the city yes it looks cool but why do we have to follow in rs3s path, just make our own
---
Yeah you're right. In reality no one is truly leeching although the MVP system is screwed up and probably makes people not tick manipulating feel like their resources are being "stolen". Equally, people who are tick manipulating feel like they deserve to get more rewards than people are contributing less. The issue isn't the tick manipulation, it's the MVP system (it's just as retarded in ToB too I wish they'd stop with this shitty system).
---
They killed me in the wilderness :(
---
Update a character every week until they vote for new skills.
---
Has any other boss shit out this many resources before? Dont even think pre-nerf Zulrah did this much damage
---
I see that they're different, but the premise of them is the same, reduces the length of time spent on the quests in one way or another.
---
Jagex must have understood people did not want the quests made easier / shorter following the results of the original poll. It didn't go their way so they went ahead and implemented a change without polling that accomplishes something extremely similar to what they originally polled and failed. 
---
I'm not necessarily upset the quests were made easier, I'm upset Jagex snuck a change in specifically after people voted no on a similar change. It sets a bad premise.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs because people keep opening it up
---
q
---
Rapier &gt; blade 
---
It's not even an argument.
---
He can, but he wont.
---
Well its bis slash weapon so its nothing like barrows. More bosses should be like this. All the resource drops ruined the game making skilling worthles and all the game pvm.
---
Also could do this type of thing for the construction menu right?
---
if they made a runelite extension that put that bar up there  even know it did nothing and the links legit dont work.  ide still keep it on

Thats a propaganda for MTX

---
Disagree with your take on the rewards. The sword will crash in price and that‚Äôs literally the only thing worth doing this for in terms of monetary value. Take a look at GWD, almost all drops aren‚Äôt worth picking up, so why do people still do it? Because their is more than ONE good rare drop, and kills take very little time.
---
If I got it as a drop I would use it but I'm not going to buy it.
---
New crystal trees from Prif are insanely good in general and are on an 8 hour timer, if you consider that recurring. You get the saplings by trading in crystal seeds (weapon seeds are the cheapest rn, they're roughly 23k and climbing) and in 8 hours you get a 13k farming exp drop as well as 8-10 crystal shards which converts to 60-80k profit if you're making divine potions out of them
---
This is all locked behind Song of the Elves, though
---
Literally looks like a blood dyed khopesh
---
They advertised it as a group boss, and its not just being rewarded for doing a little extra. They're quite literally abusing a glitch that jagex has just turned a blind eye too. 
---
The way the boss is designed, when just a single person 1.5 ticks the boss, they've now done significantly more damage than all other people. The game recognizes this, so every other person rolls on the bad drop table getting 20k drops.
---
This boss is just people every world bug abusing to steal loot from people playing the game fairly. It's so janked right now. A d pick and 99 mining don't help nearly enough if even a noticeable ammount.
---
I‚Äôm just here to upvote in agreement. Here ya go!
---
Played RS on my grandmas 128 MB RAM Windows 98 computer on Internet Explorer, and it was absolutely crispy.
---
I mean... if you just do resource skilling you'll make far more money and still spend less resources. You'll never get the blade realistically speaking, its in the same spectrum of rarity as 3rd age.
---
I've never had an issue with the Varrock guard designs, but I started playing after they were changed.
---
I enjoy it but i think only because i havent had to get elite void, but I hear from other people that you only like it until you have to do hundreds of games for elite void.
---
Uhhh.  People wanted old school because the mechanics had changed so drastically.
---
Nobody originally wanted it for the graphics....
---
Completely killed the enjoyment i get out of this boss. Seeing selfish shits screw over others sickens me.
---
make all npcss purple
---
Or rework it to make it better. Maybe top 3-5 people have a roll at the MVP loot. Pet should not require MVP.
---
Same!
---
The lego trees are amazing!
---
They are tradeable, aren't they?
---
It could be scaled back a bit in corrupted.
---
A lot of that mode is just hoping for good rng for the boss hits so you don't have to sit there wasting dps chugging food

Gp*

Maple bow duel arena. Tell him to duel you with a maple bow and give him rune arrows. He won‚Äôt be able to fight back and you can take whatever he stakes
---
That post that's been making the rounds had it pretty accurate. It's all in smart and effective contrast.
---
Old school graphics are very flat with large polygons and little explicit contrast. The newer EoC style graphics are very dynamic with detailed, highly contrasted models. Compare [Drakes](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Drake) and the [Undead Druids](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Undead_Druid) which are both new and (as far as models are concerned) unique to OSRS. The drakes have so much more detailed models with a dozen shades of blue and gray each on them. The undead druids have a few shades of blue and a few of red. The model is more flat. But it isn't more boring. The undead druid looks awesome. 
---
That's the "old school" feel.
---
Is it infested with bots?
---
the basic gauntlet is effectively easy/practice mode... substantially rarer uniques, effectively half the normal drop table
---
well best stop using the bank swaps at the ge then
---
But bro it's literally on your back don't lie
---
A handful of times recently, actually. I just did Lunars not too long ago so trying to figure out what I‚Äôll need for certain spells like Tan Leather or Spin Flax or Ourania Tele. Before that though, never. So good point.
---
How old? Like those blue zombies with green pants or what? Current is fine by me.
---
At least you got that sweet double xp though
---
The gloves yes, the crystals no. The idea is that the work to open the chest itself will limit the amount entering the game to a slow drip as they are rare and also the chest isn't opened as often as for example the normal crystal chest, no where near.
---
Np :)
---
I think its still too soon to talk about rewards until once drop rates are known and the price of the blade stabilizes.
---
The blade obviously wont be equal to the price of the rapier due to the fact that it degrades, but I wouldn't be surprised if it settles around 80-100m compared to the rapier's ~160m.
---
Yeah let's not update the game. Revert everything back and take out all updates. Fuck mm2 ds2 and zulrah while were at it!

Good luck finding a world where you can get &gt;1 kc before some degenerate ticker crashes your party

It‚Äôs mod gees shorty content and bad recycled things from rs3
---
Because a lot of people use RS as a form of escapism, at least that's the impression I get from a ton of interactions I've had with people (strangers and friends) over the years. Other people use substances to forget about their problems for a little while, or to help put everything in perspective in a different way of looking at their situation, or self-medicate to deal with physical pain/anxiety/depression. Some people combine RS and drugs to have a pretty good time.
---
i havent played the new quest but from what i know about rs lore: iorwerth elves are literally just elves who have had their minds corrupted because seren fucked up getting rid of the curse that binds them to her
---
there is no reason for them to be purple, lore-wise. sure, you could argue the corruption affected their bodies but it's definitely not necessary and it affects the story negatively from the players' perspective(might give away them being evil)

Says the guy who doesn‚Äôt know Ironman is in runescape. Yikes
---
Can you guys please look into buffing Crystal Armor's effect on the crystal bow? I tweeted Ash and Ed with this picture: https://i.imgur.com/g0H6Vix.png
---
Basically, anywhere you'd think that the Accuracy bonus would be good, enchanted bolts in budget gear (black d'hide, rune crossbow) is just better. 
---
As it stands, Full Crystal Armor is 15m+ in Shards + Armor Crystals, yet it's worse defensively than Black D'hide, only equal in attack bonus, and even the full set effect is worse than a Rune Crossbow and Black d'hide, a 20k set up.
---
I just tried to beat it for the past 3 hours and got wrecked almost every time. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with the normal gauntlet‚Äôs gathering time or RNG like some people say, but the boss just completely messes you up. Maybe I‚Äôm not the best PvMer but I feel like I‚Äôm competent enough and should be able to at least get him past half health. I like that it‚Äôs challenging but I‚Äôve been getting absolutely destroyed.
---
Haven‚Äôt looked at any guides or anything but is there a tip for knowing what attack it‚Äôs about to use? I know it‚Äôs supposed to switch every 4 attacks but then it hits me for a 35 and takes my pray off while I‚Äôm running in circles in the corner and I‚Äôm just fucked
---
This is why I laugh when people are like "You don't care about graphics but you're pissed about the new models?  Pick one"  
---
When people say they don't care about graphics they mean "We don't need/want fancy graphics to love this game, so take a chill pill Jagex, you don't need to go overboard"
---
I'll keep on grinding then
---
/&gt;you guys are hypocrits
---
/&gt;no we're not, we just think thi-
---
/&gt;NO, YOU'RE WRONG, STOP CRYING BABY
---
Good post man, agreed.
---
It's rather simple really. We humans strive for the best but also settle for the worse or really bad. However, for some reason we hate anything in the middle.  
---
  
---
Look for example at video games. People either want the very best graphics or they want 8 or 16 bit games.  
---
I think the reason is that once you go past a certain point humans just think "Just go all the way." Or "they probably put alot of effort into an update that only improved the graphics like 10%".  
---
So we see it as a failure.

Why don‚Äôt you just learn to tick manipulate? It‚Äôs not hard
---
DAE video game bad????
---
Let's quit the age-gatekeeping, shall we? Playing a video game at any age is fine. Brushing off your responsibilities for video games at any age isn't fine.
---
Doesn't matter what the game is or how old you are, as long as you have your life under control you can do whatever you want.
---
He directed a relatively based and extremely redpilled at CNN though.
---
problem is,  currently only mvp gets a chance at pet.
---
Spyro, what are you doing here?
---
Even when I uploaded multi-TB backups in the summer they didn't give a fuck. Depends on the sysadmins.
---
They are literally polling chat face changes...
---
Was expecting him puking instead haha
---
He got the pet already didn't he? I thought it was like the 45th kill?
---
Imagine the smelll
---
You‚Äôre just jealous that the elves completed the Halloween event last year before you and got to go to the make over mage
---
Because the community has no idea what they want and bitch about everything even though we have an amazing game to play as is.
---
Hence why I mentioned it was an unpopular opinion. Although I believe the downfall of RS actually began with the removal of wilderness/free trade, that's when the number of players really took a dip (not considering bots being removed).
---
Why do they need new ones we completely went back after they fucked it up and now we‚Äôre going straight back there again
---
I completely agree. 
---
And even though I'm good at masses, I prefer smaller teams with friends so much better. They are a lot more relaxed instead of having to be hyper efficient.
---
I get why some kids would be upset about not being able to get pet if they aren't MVP but that's the part that makes it competitive.
---
1. Tick manipulating is an awfuly dreadful experience. 2. I shouldn't have to bug abuse to play new content.
---
I‚Äôve gone from 40-80 farming in 3-4 weeks doing tree runs once a day. Takes 20 minutes and is super easy. Id recommend this
---
The phrasing on the later poll disassociates it with rs3 so people voted for it. The first one people probably thought of rs3 when they read it.
---
Or maybe the later one just had more info instead of being kind of vague
---
in Belgium you have fast internet. Iirc slayermusiq lives in Japan now

Pc pet would be awesome. They had them with summoning in rs2 and they were fun and looked cool then so fuck yesh
---
Yes
---
Yee true, but I havent gotten scammed yet, or at least scammed to the point for me to notice. Lol, like I said, it's usually pocket change. And the time the guy won 80m, was the time when a lot of people were gambling xD so I wasn't the only one. Saw a lot of people losing cash, saw a lot of people betting bank and losing it, but I was one of the lucky ones, as well as that other guy lol
---
Well said.
---
Yeah, should probably poll both of those things individually.
---
Losing standing subs can hit one hard, might ruin his twitch career. I'd say he's lucky if he can regain half of that.
---
That montage was fucking sick
---
Drain swamp man bad
---
I'm unsure where you got this impression from, we aren't happy that we made a mistake. Genuinely, a human error was made and we will rectify it. There isn't a big bad mindset behind these changes and we're honestly quite upset that it's taken away some of the enjoyment of the update for some people, so for that I apologise.
---
they have really good internet infrastructure, hes prolly just cheap
---
That's not fair. The majority of things polled pass, meaning they do have a pretty good idea of what the community wants. They have a lot of contact with us through the live streams / social media etc.

How does this u/settledrs guy always get the karma for posting the swampletics videos to reddit?
---
If you took a wrong turn, the best way to move forward is to go back till you get back to the turn and take the correct one. Better that the game stays the same than gets worse. Evolution isn't a good or bad thing in a vaccum. You're just assuming change will make it better or draw people in. That's the optimistic scenario. It's by no means a given.
---
RS3, a competitor? In what world? Some of their ideas for the game itself are decent and have already been implemented, albeit some of them resulted in some serious power creep, but the art style is not something to take inspiration from. OSRS exists because most players agree that RS3 is NOT a competitor, and the dev team should take as little from it as possible, building from the style and mechanics of OSRS instead. why isn't this a given?
---
dont you have to have good hunter level to make money tho?
---
89 hunter!
---
...a series of tasks many of which are locked behind quests, skills, and gear.
---
Was that dream sequence inspired by the _Nightmares and Daydreams_ episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender? It reminded me of it!
---
first
---
Yeah what the hell was that update about? It was like they brought in RS3 graphic models but just for guards of one town but years ahead of RS3 being released...
---
Swamp man best man
---
Yeah something definitely has to be going on
---
Notice how every 100-300k drop doesn‚Äôt come with crystal shards, but then 300k+ on the Double roll during MVP does. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs like 2nd and third place or idk cause I‚Äôve had bad loot into a duo/trio too still. Very interested to know wtf is going on behind the scenes if they ever tell us.
---
rc bad
---
Getting rid of f keys would bring new pkers imo, the bracket from f key users to non users is massive and new players generally have no chance in a lot of situations because of this
---
That intro dream sequence gave me similar vibes to the the scene in Avatar: TLA where Aang confronts the Firelord, but he's not wearing any pants. I love it.
---
Man... back in the day there were weekly pure clan wars here. I was in Intense Redemption, not one of the bigger clans like Foe, TLP, MM, or Fatality. I think we massed at around 40-50 people, but everyone in the pure clan community still knew about us. Every time we'd roll up we'd start spamming our asses off. Hundreds of people - I'll never forget it. 
---
I'm building a new account in an attempt to get back into this game/pure community. Shit was too fun
---
muting the whites of the eyes and the lip/mouth region was the worst decision with these new designs.
---
some of the expressions aren't too bad, this [raised eyebrow one](https://i.imgur.com/8MArAjo.png) was great, eluned [wasn't too bad](https://i.imgur.com/qBjQMJ3.png), but what the hell is up with [baxtorian?](https://i.imgur.com/62KDzi7.png)
---
Account sharing is mention in the rules. It‚Äôs a huge grey area.
---
Yes. And cutting yews is low money and non efficient. But it‚Äôs nice and afk and has a decent chance for pet. You are trying trying to argue for the sake of argument. Are you trying to imply that yews are an efficient money maker?
---
Holy crap. This might be my favorite episode so far. Nice work, Settled.
---
No its my new bot client that chops yews only for 49.99‚Ç¨ !
---
Hey Settled what's the slow song you used  at the start of the video? Btw great video, best on yet!

Automated pvp bots running around at all times
---
I absolutely agree players should just level up more. I did both quests with level 60 agility and failed maybe 2 traps the entire time. I ended up dropping food because I brought too much.
---
I really enjoy the course but the rate of shards per hour is so low in comparison to other methods. i‚Äôm sure they will smooth everything out in the coming weeks.
---
"Why is a game with a damage system based on rng killing me with rng????"
---
Seriously, you people complain about EZscape all the time but you can't handle not having complete immunity to a boss? Apparently RS3 is ezscape and even RS3 doesn't give full immunity with protection prayers.
---
The gauntlet requires zero gear though.
---
Ya I mean you killed the parent so you adopted their child, perfect sense, kind've.
---
Ive been playing since before the update and even as a kid ive always hated the new look of the guards. I dont even mind them being changed a bit to be more distinguished from fally guards, but the new ones look completely out of place
---
Yes, I'm 220kc.

It means he's complaining about this where in tob, even if you have your prayer up; bosses will hit 40s+

/r/cursedcomments
---
Thats my new kink
---
yes officer, this comment over here
---
Hai and welcome to my guide!
---
No mention of either zulcano's MVP mechanic or the gauntlets drop table...
---
I really feel your priorities are backwards here...
---
Exactly. Plus, it's stats are the exact same as normal Rune armor. It's got fucking dragonstones in it for crying out loud, it should be more powerful. 
---
Here's an idea, let's make this a craft able item with smithing rework. Rune items can be crafted from levels 40-50. At 50, you could start fusing gems with armor, which could further be enchanted for added stat and effect bonuses. Dragonstone Rune armor could have stats near regular dragon, but say it loses charge over time, so we'd have a degradable armor. Maybe different gems would produce different effects.
---
Mod Ed said in a Twitter convo with Zulu that they‚Äôre addressing the Zalcano issue early this week. I hope they make it work like wintertodt
---
OSRS will my friend

---
Glad to hear your back up and at it. 
---
I guess we can never really say we aren‚Äôt coming back one day to rs but at least the rebuild can be a big part of the fun if you do decide to.
---
I thought I was going to be ‚Äúdone‚Äù with it when my main felt I had become a human money snek bot. Just working for loot, nowadays I‚Äôm playing iron and sometimes the grind is over baring so I flip back to the main.
---
All the best fellow scaper, maybe one day gielinor will see you again :)
---
Too many worlds. Great for PvMing, horrible for pking. Reduce wildy access to X amount of worlds in order to increase wildy population while decreasing the problems associated with the hop timer.
---
It does matter tho?
---
The feel  and design of the game are huge factors in why a lot of us play
---
Just because you don't think it should matter does not mean it doesn't.
---
thank you for listening to feedback and giving us a poll on the graphics changes
---
It was in preparation of Runescape HD which was a middle step between RS2 and RSMTX. With extra polygons that started going for a "molded clay" aesthetic. Some changes were good like the dragon and demon updates, but others were questionable. When all human characters are built from a template it looks really strange when some have completely different bone structures. Also we lost the imps that were just micro stabby boys in devil costumes.
---
I didn't interpret your response as flaming honestly, and it's not much of a discussion if everyone else gets to give their opinions and you don't get to give yours. People misuse the downvote button all the time on here. I'd prefer the developers to share their thought process so thanks for speaking with the community directly.   
---
If it's worth anything to you, I have some feedback on the armour design and if you disagree, please feel free to let me know.   
---
For an oldschool runescape item, it does feel like there's a lot going on. I think what made things like the bandos armour so great is it was a simple, strong idea. A single shoulderpad with spikes on, and a sort of shirt attached. it was quite a striking design because it didn't rely on much to work.  
---
This armour looks lovely, looks very functional, and shows off your skill! but it also feels like it could exist without the dragon stones and *still* be very detailed for an oldschool set of armour. I think beyond shading styles what makes a great set of armour in RS (and in any game) is a strong, simple, striking design. This doesn't, to me, have that. It feels like a more detailed version of rune armour with gems slotted in. Again, it shows off your artistic skill quite well, but i think to truly address this feedback it might be a more fundamental change that's needed.   
---
Overall If I were working on this armour now, I'd want to come up with a visual idea that's strong enough that I wouldn't have to lean on a lot of detail for it to pop. I know that's easier said than done obviously. If you're in a pinch for time though, one **personal** preference would be to make the dragonstones smaller, make the eyeholes bigger, and smooth out some of the detail to create more flat plates that don't break up the shape as much. I drew a shitty example pic here.  
---

Thanks dude, love your work.
---
No
---
This pretty much sums everything up:
---
If this gets polled, I'm voting no because of 2 reasons:
---
1. Jagex stated that no ingame content would be exclusive to ironmen.     2. To spite toxic ironmen.

whoosh
---
You level up your agility skills before doing it. I did the quests at level 60 and only failed 2 times. I had fun. I didn't realize the quest was so hated until I read about it online.
---
&gt;1. Jagex stated that no ingame content would be exclusive to ironmen.
---
A single cosmetic change to max cape is not content
---
&gt;2. To spite toxic ironmen.
---
I don't think the ironmemes are the toxic ones....
---
Hard disagree. If they had maybe three good rare drops I probably wouldn‚Äôt care as much. It‚Äôs just one item. One.

Yessssssss

good they removed the question from zalcano shit was bullshit and no way u get 100 shards in a hour like they claimed.
---
&gt;I don't think the ironmemes are the toxic ones....
---
When you're anywhere in the map chatting with an ironman and they say that your achivements are worthless because you're in an normie account, you'll understand what I mean.
---
Can I just say how glad I am that the premier OSRS content creator right now is such a chill guy who makes high quality content instead of clickbait titles, forced hyper enthusiasm, and unnecessary facecam?

Swampman best, /u/SettledRS best. Thanks for the videos.

bro I've played this game far too much and I have never seen that happen

Unfortunately things like this entirely cement questing with guides
---
I don't understand this game.
---
smoke some weed tonight and the gods will grant you rng that‚Äôs how i did it
---
Condescending? It's it hard to see with your head so far up your ass?
---
On second thoughts I‚Äôm alright.
---
I understand that the point wasn't to compete with newer games, but that's the only way it'll survive. Unless OSRS can be funded by the a group of 100k immortal adults, it has no choice but to compete with newer games. 
---
The game we play now is not played as RuneScape was in 2007. From PKing to Skilling to pvming, it's completely different. Same mechanics is what preserves the game. Old games are fun to play, but need to change or they get stale.
---
I don't think you know what the word logic means.
---
Exactly they do UNPOLLED changes no where in the polls did they mention changing the art style. 
---
Enough is enough so much new shit looks fucking out of place. All of zeah besides the new Hosidius work (which was great) looks like shit and anything onwards has been. The new Frothos dungeon is the only new content that looks old school.
---
Every server ip you connect to just like league or any other game your isp is connected to that, jagex security is already shit. They wouldn‚Äôt have a clue how to setup a cloud voice network to save their company
---
I find crafting much more relevant than smithing. Dragonhide armor much harder to get naturally compared to what you can make with smithing imo.
---
New pkers was generally what I meant by new players didn‚Äôt explain very well
---
Lmao, the corniest joke i have ever heard, and hardest i've ever laughed :D
---
Doesnt really matter when its unlocked because basically all serious pvmers have 99 att str def mage range anyways
---
Settled taught me how to scold a woman while making love to a child.
---
It gets even worse with MTX, because then you can start thinking in terms of "well I could grind Slayer for X hours, but I get paid more than $0.50 an hour so just going to work and using part of my paycheck would technically be the fastest method."
---
The cheif problem being that suddenly it's no longer about playing and enjoying the game at all. It's devolved into a time-managment simulator that you could spend money on. I've never RWT'd or bought bonds, but I found myself making comparisons to real world value which just broke the game for me.
---
Is that factoring in uniques and Crystal shards? If so what value are you assigning to shards there? I agree 500k seems low but 1.5 also seems a decent amount higher than I've seen.
---
Man you have a lot of alts if this guys getting 30+ downvotes huh
---
Is that still going?
---
You're telling new players how to play the game dummy. That's condescending.
---
did you talk to hans in lumbridge yet?
---
Damage=increase in accuracy
---
If you roll a hit you have a chance to roll a 0 for your hit. The higher your damage the less likely you roll a 0 for the hit.
---
He is located in japan rn iirc
---
RNG is the reason why i don't do corrupted runs. Bad rng on tier 3 mobs affects the run so much that you almost have to reset if you don't get the bow. The staff is terrible since it splashes way too often. Also the first attack can be a 59+ and that's just a 50/50. I'm getting 1/3 success rate on corrupted and so far, 0% success rate without the t3 bow. 25 food, 1 of any t3 wep, tier 1 armor with t2 legs do not guarantee victory in corrupted, even if you don't do any mistakes in the boss fight.
---
The normal gauntlets are much more forgiving and rng can almost never completely ruin your run.
---
Right.... Thats biased towards PKers... and takes away the legitimacy of planning/strategizing/locking down an area. 
---
Making content "easier" in the only dangerous part of osrs is a problem. If a team coordinated 20 ppl, there's no reason that you shkuld have any less.
---
Can some explain the ‚Äúgreat nerf‚Äù next to void icon? Was dmg higher back then with full void?
---
Opinions of an RS3 player lmfao
---
He took criticism for the Dragon Hunter Lance, I don‚Äôt like it, but he did change it numerous times. His answer is ‚Äúsome people didn‚Äôt like the design‚Äù because the OSRS community isn‚Äôt one hive mind. There are many people who said they liked it the new, proposed suggestion.
---
OSRS is hugely outperforming RS3 even though OSRS graphics are ‚Äúworse‚Äù. 
---
Can Jagex really afford to piss off its old playerbase which have been dedicated to RS for over a decade just to potentially gain some new players?
---
Also, why should I as an old player have to play a game that doesn‚Äôt LOOK LIKE RUNESCAPE? I want to play the game that I‚Äôm familiar, else I‚Äôd would rather just quit.
---
Because kids think they deserve to be able to get the pet for participation like in wintertodt
---
Oh yeah old falador

I got the dragon defender on the first kill lol

What type of bender would you be? Foggy swamp bender seems too obvious hah

---
Just so you know that‚Äôs not how clocks work ^/s
---
But are you? In theory you could argue ya ya ya.... But are you actually arguing/discussing or strawmanning?
---
Zalcano mvp is good kid
---
That's because the armour will use your supplies and free up space but if you have a full inventory there is nowhere for the tele or vial to go. At least if I understand your question correctly.
---
lol theres a full stop button u dont have to type it out haha full stop
---
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things
---
O
---
Many shitty browser MMOs did.
---
I‚Äôve only done a few runs and I figured hally and bow were the best but when I get stuck with an orb drop I find that the staff actually puts in work
---
Do you atleast agree it should‚Äôve been polled?
---
Yeah bonds have really fucked with the game for me, while I have bought them in the past, I don‚Äôt now and certainly wouldn‚Äôt use them to get say a tbow or anything mad like that, but I can‚Äôt help but feel any time spent at bosses for GP is entirely wasted when I could just go do skills and buy a bond or two a week, after all thats less than I spend on beer.
---
Your logic is that OSRS needs to adapt to survive. 
---
OSRS isn't the type of game that needs to innovate - it will only survive by doing more of the same. These recent changes are not major by any means, but its a slippery slope.
---
OSRS -needs- to die when its target audience is done with it. It will either die naturally right along with the target audience, or it will be killed by the handful of Jagex staff thinking they know better.
---
The proof lies directly with RS3. I don't know how you could argue with that.
---
I need context to this started playing when mobile came out.
---
Is the animation the same?
---
It was the maxed people who voted against it.
---
Don‚Äôt let u/SettledRS see this.
---
I'd be all for adding a second type of fish to combo eat. But overall, I don't think the Gauntlet needs to be made any easier. The RNG aspect of it can be annoying, especially when it hits 3 20s through prayer in a row or all your fish rooms spawn on the outer ring, but that is part of both the game and minigame.
---
Also, the claim that experience doesn't help with The Gauntlet is ridiculous. I am by no means a good PvMer and I still can't clear the Corrupted Gauntlet, but after a day of practicing I can consistently clear the normal Gauntlet and I know I still have room to improve (both in how I do at the boss and since the record is under half my best time). So I don't think you can say that it doesn't have a learning curve like other PvM just because good players figured it out quickly when the same is true for most bosses (e.g. how long did it take to figure out the Hydra?).
---
Have you tried reading the front page. There‚Äôs a blog up that literally states it‚Äôll be polled.
---
Yeah even if it didn't bring any new players to the game, a lot of people made multiple accounts for dmm generating more revenue for jagex.  I know I made 2-4 accounts every dmm season / tournament and there were plenty of other players like myself
---
Where do I and other money doublers fit in?
---
Personally I think dorgesh-kaan looks terrible even though it was released in 2007
---
I didn't like what they did with rune armour back then, but I don't think it's the same thing as updating awful looking NPCs or adding new ones. Yeah that constitution thing was frustrating, too
---
They have mounts now?
---
There is a beautiful YouTube video on all of RS history with all updates and events covered it‚Äôs long tho. I‚Äôll look for link if you want it bc I kinda wanna watch it myself again
---
The mod called out factual errors and never said they didn‚Äôt care, as evidenced by the poll that just came out.
---
Keep raging though bud, I‚Äôm sure it will improve the game
---
Only if you're hardcoding rates and chances into your game which you'd have to be a comple-...
---
...yeah jagex definitely does it this way, good point. 
---
Still, changing numbers in code and creating new code are different.
---
This is precisely something I wanted when I got into OSRS. I wasn't thrilled that GE got in because I feel like it is responsible for all the worst things (mainly the prevalence of botting).
---
And yeah, I feel like normal Iron Men could easily "downgrade" into this mode, without a bank reset, just like they can become normal accounts. I wouldn't let normal accounts transition, however.
---
Same! Just finished Monkey Madness @ 70cb, I'm having a great time.

This is it chief

That's very 2003 argonian

Not that you‚Äôre right or wrong but I think most players have bigger issues with equipment cosmetics than NPCs most of the time due to the nature of the product. I might see the Elves during the quest but now I have to see Dragon Stone armor everyday and get RS3 vibes.

The idea was interesting and the first videos were very well made. He's got charisma/charm and people like him. This sub started making memes which helped grow his popularity initially.
---
Now people are invested.
---
Very relevant to the thread
---
I totally agree! The graphics on RS3 make the game unrecognizable for me. I remember only wearing 3rd age since at the time they had not updated the models for those yet, and everything else looked ugly.
---
We want to play the game that we recognize... Not some other fantasy MMO.
---
It DOES matter and it DOES make people want to quit including myself (I have before)
---
Jagex should stop these ridiculous unpolled changes to our game.
---
Void armor used to be a 20% damage boost with the set and one of the best range armor in the game (for damage not defense) and they nerfed it down to 10% (12.5% with void elite) in an unpolled nerf for the ‚Äúintegrity of the game‚Äù they said. Lots of people were unhappy about it.
---
Not even in low quality mode.

I think it‚Äôs when they nerfed void range(maybe all sets?) because it was op as fawk

We need OSOSRS. We've gone too far.

I saw Settled at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
---
He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
---
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
---
Eau de swamp üòç
---
I mean I understand your point but it's not similar to arcane/dex. Mutagens are cosmetics whereas arcane/dex had a huge difference in price.
---
They're both pretty awful, just train your ranged
---
Couldn‚Äôt that be said about literally anything?
---
There‚Äôs one at the fossil island camp too
---
I agree, it was pretty jarring. I'm all for inclusivity but my character is a dude; everyone else in the game refers to him as 'he'/'him'. For an entire quest to suddenly throw that out of the window and turn him into a genderless entity was weird. It's really not a big deal but it's just another thing that looked/felt out of place in a quest that already had several things that looked/felt out of place.
---
To be honest, I think it's more likely that it was just them just being 'woke' or whatever given that we're referred to in third person a several times in a number of other quests. I doubt they need to do any sort of check, it's probably a tag/feature built into RuneScript - something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/kmFUXDs.png). Just speculation, of course. As Make All and various other updates showed us, they do tend to re-invent the wheel.

Thank you for your well informed argument about why people are not thrilled with the new models. Well done.

feels good to see this here, havent had my dose in a while

Lookup ‚Äúosrs dps calculator‚Äù
---
Very helpful tool that‚Äôll let you see exactly what dps you can output on any mob with any gear setup. Very helpful for comparing gear setups anywhere in the game.
---
Hahaha, you've clearly not raided in mythic wow if that's your statement. Your average guild will literally never clear Mythic, and those that do normally spend 3-4 months clearing it.
---
If you can't call a 500+ attempt boss a hard won victory, I don't really have any response.
---
To an extent I agree with one thing you've said - There is a limit to the complexity you can push with OSRS. However, I still fundamentally disagree that risk increases difficulty and I truly believe there are better ways to implement difficult encounters.
---
I actually think the Gauntlet is a great example of how to do difficult content without risk - Strip away all of the top end gear and make that part of the challenge. Add in a timer so that there's a speed component to it that encourages more perfect play.
---
For me, some sort of riskless boss encounter that has increased rewards depending on your performance is exactly how to increase difficulty without incresing mechanical difficulty, risk is an extremely cheap way of doing it. As I've said in detail, rewarding success is better design than punishing failure.
---
Hmm, maybe they should add an encounter or series of encounters that measures performance, and punishes death with lower loot quality rather than losing your items. They could also add some sort of optional mode where if you complete it within a certain time limit you can get a special reward and additional points.
---
[Yeah, that could definitely work.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chambers_of_Xeric/Challenge_Mode)

crazy thing is, is it coincidence that they all got hacked the same day? and twitter says nothing?

As someone who made an account in 2013, quit within a few months, then came back in 2016 and played off and on until now, the only thing I came back for is the new content and appeal of ironman mode. The only thing I was looking forward to was new content.
---
If this game stays the same I'm not going to play it. There's plenty of better options on the market, but new things bring an appeal to the game.
---
I knew it! I don't know if this was announced or not, but I knew right away you were involved in some of that editing! Nice job.
---
Woox "karma race" 16
---
I actually semi quit when they changed the graphics to shit looking clay models, that was pure garbage.
---
I dont think osrs lives off graphic quality updates but instead it thrives off the amount of content that can be put into the game with less effort than other higher graphic games, or trade the graphics effort for more polished gameplay. 
---
Either way graphics updates are not the way forward.

Im 94 rc and been doing bloods ever since. Got the pet around 82 and will hopefully have untrimmed by the end of the summer. Welcome to the holy land (:
---
Once the game became zulrahmanmode and raidsmanmode I quit my main for good at rank ~3k. The sad part to me isn't that the game revolves around grind money -&gt; go to ge -&gt; purchase buyable skills/grind non buyable for diaries and that's the entire game. It's so fucking boring. What happened to quests and minigames? What happened to distractions and diversions? Some bad rewards and we have to scrap the entire concept? I used to love chasing evil trees and stars and penguins. Fun minigames like soul wars and fist of guthix and stealing creation.
---
Remember when there would be a new quest almost every month? Usually no more than 3 month waits at a time. I'm glad we've gotten like 10 grand omegamaster quests on oldschool, but I hope the jmods know not every quest has to be a sequel or something massive and game changing. We can have those gertrude cats inbetween.

Gotta love xplets that think tick manip and prayer flicking are bugs

Cheers brother, ill go track that calc down! :)
---
The people who did that posted it on here a few weeks ago when it actually happened, lol. It's the most evil thing I've ever seen.
---
eh i wouldn't say i love the "old" graphics, it's just that rs3 ones look like garbage in comparison.
---
Probably 3rd Lucky Impling, just so RNGesus gives him the best title "Third time's the charm".
---
They should change it back to old models and THEN poll for changes.
---
I don't understand this meme lol, are you making fun of the people that think cballs are a waste of time? cause they definitely are; that shit is the job of bot.
---
Kreearra and his minions are aviansies, not birds. Other armadyl-oriented creatures in GWD are either aviansies, spritual rnagers or mages.

You can get them reenchanted for free from eluned I think.
---
Abyss is the worst method for xp, not afk, but the most profitable at higher levels (double nats).
---
Interesting tidbit: They named the NPC running nightmare zone off of the name of Dominion Tower. Dominion Tower = Dominic Onion. Back when they weren't afraid to let everyone know that they were literally just doing RS3 again.
---
Higher stats and higher effort should be rewarded IMO, but not to the expense of other players as it currently does.
---
We had a poll on where to put it and Yanille won
---
not in hard mode
---
explanations needed
---
If you're in a mass with 40 kids, you need to be quick.
---
I mine 1-3 ores until I see the group start running. The faster I am, the better chance I have to be able to throw on a blue circle for extra damage.
---
If I'm ahead of the group, I throw 1 time and then wait and see if a blue circle spawns. If it does, I run to it and throw. If not, I throw the other 2 I have.
---
Then I try and be right next to where Zalcano is when she goes into the mining phase. As soon as this phase ends, run to the next glowing ore to mine.
---
Doing the 1.5t method in a 40 man group doesn't really do much because the phases are so fast.
---
I play my "main" account like an Ironman 90% of the time and rarely use the GE, only ever if I want to just buy things which I cba to grind out myself, such as pure essence or other stuff.
---
I try to hunt my own gear and get called out for it sometimes by mains or even irons who think I shouldn't be playing that way. The other day I was getting a few red spiders eggs in the tower of life and there was this Ironman annoyed with me saying "why the fk would you be doing this on a main?" Because I want to, what a loser.
---
Or just buff the overall table and leave the blade alone, which they‚Äôre already discussing/data collecting. There‚Äôs literally no reason to buff the drop rate for the blade. If you want a better chance at receiving it, do the corrupted Gauntlet. It‚Äôs more gp/hr anyways vs. regular and the drop rates improve due to more roll chances.
---
Were they iconic, though? Maybe the questline, but not the elven appearance. They were regular men with pointy ears.
---
I did not spend the last 40 hours getting to 77 RC for this to be brought up
---
*oldschool* runescape
---
It's possible they have a tag for it, but given what a mess of spaghetti coffee this game can be I wouldn't be surprised if it's unnecessarily complicated. I really don't think they have an ulterior motive tho, I think they just took the quicker route. But I digress, as other replies to this chain are showing this is an absolutely horrible place to be discussing this.
---
Holy shit, i've actually had the exact toy
---
and that's all it should have been.
---
Instead they threw in Imbues so now every ring has to have 2x the stats as they did on launch, and made it easy combat xp. They fucked that up so bad.

At a DUI meeting now. Can't wait to get home and watch it tonight! Smile on my face :)

Does anyone know what the current best use for crystal shards is to convert them into gp? The wiki values for the divine potions is way off at the moment - cheers.

This guys gets it.

Go for the quest cape like I am. I just started again recently myself, and I‚Äôm trying to fullfill my childhood goal of getting that cape.

Lets you dictate your way of playing a lot, mixing skills and quests, and nothing feels too grindy or repetitive
---
People who don't play osrs anymore but still subscribe to the subreddit! Nothing to worry about! It was a great explanation.
---
This meme format is a little deeper than the surface level joke that it seems to be making. In a way, it's making fun of both the player on the right and player on the left.

Watching this series since day one and I have to say the fact that we have to wait weeks in between each episode makes this so much better. Even though hes saying that it took 40 hours or 200 hours, waiting the weeks in between just cements how much work hes putting into this. Great job man I wish you the best of luck, easily my favorite RS content creator.

1tick flicking to guarantee never losing prayer is more click-intensive than 3ticking anything lol

Why the new version looks well better
---
I thought it looked much more "crystalline" and fits the colors of the bow and shield
---
is there ever any point in switching prayers? i remember reading the wiki a few days ago and seeing that range/mage is purely 50/50 each time, but has anything new been found?
---
tbh I didn't think I'd care much, but I finished the new quest and tried Zolcano and The Gauntlet. I don't really enjoy either of those. It made me realize that I don't particularly enjoy PVM. Leveling up skills is what I like, so missing out on a new skill is an extra bummer for me.
---
New spec, tard rage?
---
Character overheads a "REEEEEEEE" before doing sustained dclaw spec for 4 seconds. Players can move 4 squares to avoid this.
---
Chop Chop!
---
Its like the hydra. It has a set number of attacks (4 I think) in a row and then it switches to the other.
---
Even without MVP rewards are most likely based off a sort of point system.
---
MVP is just an extra special roll and a chance ar pet
---
They could literally just move the pet out of it and it's be fine, people would still put in extra effort to get the extra loot roll(which is an extra chance at tool seed too)
---
CrystalCream actually, I mainly chill on W301/W302 - if you're a regular on those servers you'll definitely know me

I actually really love both version of prif, that is from rs3 and osrs. I like rs3s because I just think it looks very cool walking and doing stuff on all the crystal structures but I love the osrs version too for being more nature connected with crystals interspersed. Overall I'm extremely happy with what we got and definitely can appreciate amidst some of the complaints.
---
People didn't like it. Which is why we have the current one...
---
Maybe check the webside if it autofills your email?
---
No words for it. I just love you so much.

Ew...

Ayyy pc is dope
---
Oh cool! And which weapons/armor did you use?
---
I can show you this really cool new piece of content in the wilderness, but you need to bring 100m cash along to access it
---
Man... i'm still sad they scrapped the original idea of a tank crystal armour.
---
Yeah it would be a lot harder. I think that for all that extra effort, a slightly brighter shade of red on a cape isn't a big thing to ask? I'm not even a HCIM btw, but I see no problem with it.
---
okay now THAT is an idea I like.  Bursting Nechs would be so much better.
---
I miss my dreadnips, so OP pre nerf
---
And then everyone is too "professional"/"nice" to tell them that it's bad and needs to be reverted.
---
It definitely is, I know I've seen it before, but I'm not sure who it's about.
---
Yeah I get that I'm just saying that it prolly wasn't a ddos for him.

Given how ludicrously expensive it is atm and how annoying it is to maintain, it seems reasonable. Though maybe they should also make it degrade a little when you use the spec

it is?

Flying Lotus I'm fairly certain is the subject of the original one. Not that it matters all that much but there you go

Do mm2 if you havnt already and when u get a black demon task do demonic gorillas. Ive gotten 5 zeneyte shards, definitely helps the bank
---
This seems a little self-righteous.
---
I‚Äôm happy that exploring the game provides a source of fun for you, legitimately.
---
But most of my enjoyment of the game comes from optimizing XP gain - I‚Äôve described it to friends in the past as ‚Äòan efficiency simulator‚Äô.
---
And you know what? I have more fun playing the game now I did as a kid. So that being said, this:
---
&gt;Veterans here, think about back in the original RS2, nobody did the most efficient ways, and the game was fun as hell, and it's precisely because we didn't know or didn't care about being efficient.
---
is so lewronggeneration it‚Äôs comical. 
---
You can still play the game this way. Hell, you can still play it this way even *if* you google EHP rates. 
---
Just seems a little self-righteous. It would be like going on /r/Teenagers and making a post about how things were so much better in the 80s and everyone should just try living without their phones and ‚Äònot getting so hung up on social media‚Äô.
---
Happy it works for you, but seems a little circle-jerky.

Yes and that's why they closed Classic down.
