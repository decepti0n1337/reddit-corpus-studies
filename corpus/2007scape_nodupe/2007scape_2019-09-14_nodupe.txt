Barraging nechs in the catacombs to rush mage levels got me so many totem pieces.
---
it must be xgrace trying to make aful look bad
---
I mean, I'm usually compassionate and against rampant pk'ing, but come on. Half the wilderness is abandoned.  The guy was either cocky or dumb, the only thing in there that you NEED is the mage cape and thats pushing it. Accept your down vote with grace
---
Hopefully an elder maul buff.
---
Get better at the game
---
Because it breaks other parts.
---
You can't just throw up "integrity" every time a poll that you want fails.
---
Integrity is generally used for things that ARE OP already but players are too greedy and stupid to vote for the good of the game and the change has zero negative effect when made.
---
AKA integrity is generally a nerf, rarely a buff.
---
PvP isn't toxic but all Pking is. Wilderness Pking is all about messing with other people, it's fundamentally toxic. If you want fun fighting other players in a non toxic enviroment, go and do LMS, Clan Wars, BH, PvP Worlds, DMM, Cwars, Duel Arena and any other actualy good PvP content they add in the future.

If he was gonna use them anyways, he saved like $144 total. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
And lets not forget that there are probably people playing this game and doing rl plugins that make double the money of most jagex staff. And now jagex sees that it is just better to allow 3pcs and get client work done in a way where the coders pay for jagex than the another way round.
---
What a flex!
---
It‚Äôs not, I had a passport when osrs mobile came out and I couldn‚Äôt get it on amazon or blackberry world
---
I expect nothing less.

No matter how good you think you are. There is an Asian kid who does it better.

10m 'downloads', except downloads in this sense just refers to the 2 second 'download' that puts the app on your phone, before you tap it to play it and find out that you have to now sit there and download the rest of the game over the next half hour.

Time to play WoW classic.

I‚Äôm not sure you know what literally means. Lol literally didn‚Äôt say that
---
Is that one of those gameboy looking things with like 50 buttons?
---
Right?
---
&gt; You can't be real...
---
Well, good thing he isn't.
---
Well, the way you solve it as a game company is that sometimes you have to take the reins and over steer whatever the community votes for the better of the game.
---
This is a good suggestion! It‚Äôs a step in a good direction. If the clues are from killing other players, I‚Äôm afraid they would be farmed or paid for kills etc etc. otherwise I see no issue!
---
God's work. üôè
---
I disagree, but I think that's a completely reasonable position to take
---
Do fake emails spoof the from bluehornet? If I see that im its jagex
---
If you dont want to risk getting PKd, don't go into the wild. Its *that* simple
---
I'm happy there a tldr
---
Gonna be 10-11ish EST guys. Eating dinner now and then got about a 1.5 hour drive home
---
Was it the twitch stream? I just got fucked too.
---
It doesn‚Äôt feel much different using one or the other. I don‚Äôt ever use them both at the same time either smh
---
I mean, bro, we've had since 2013 for updates to osrs. It's hardly like osrs is a new game: it's already 6 years old. 
---
Besides, not many people talk about Obor and Bryophyta, but they are the only f2p bosses, so if you were a f2p I guarantee you'd know about them.
---
Why doesn't he use his main to bodyguard is HCIM all the time?
---
This is your fault, I wouldve logged out too lol.why didnt you just sell it and rebuy
---

---
That's unfortunate. I was hoping to try it out once I get my desktop fixed. 
---
In the last BH poll blog, they mentioned they had ideas for a lot of recolors, but decided not to poll them as BH additions. Maybe they could add them as tradable LMS rewards, like the abyssal whip recolors.
---
the guy pretending to be aful was almost definitely a troll
---
This is probably one of the best features about Gmail. Plus, it makes logging in so easy, especially if you want to make multiple accounts. You just go something like OSRS+Zerker@gmail.com for your Zerker account, OSRS+Main@gmail.com for a main, and so on.
---
GIVE ME POINTS!
---
Crazy how prayer flicking changed the game tbh
---
Very well written and insightful.  Always nice when someone who REALLY knows a lot about something like this makes a quality post.  Especially appreciate how you gave your opinion on a lot of things but didn't let that affect the objectivity of the facts. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Glad the cat's out of the bag.  Do you think jagex made the new changes partially to combat this toxic community?
---
Someone get this tattoo‚Äôd. I‚Äôll pay for it
---
I've seen some pretty crafty phish emails tbh. The thing that I usually look for is the greeting with my in-game name so thats what I look for before I open the email details.
---
I'm so confused. You're talking about how toxic hosting/hosts are. The notice board only removes the auto-typer bots element. People will still host like they did before, no? I was reading all at the start, then just skimmed because man, it's just SO long.
---
Wouldn't it be a Strength Skillcape emote accident?
---
Jokes on them I never tip my hosts anyway
---
It stops everything behind it from getting to the mage.
---
I wish i could watch a esport event with games like castle wars.
---
Id rip off my own dick long before i would ever read thar shit in its entirety
---
Damn, yeah I just realized I'm not big enough for that.
---
yeah but the whole point is the better dps too for fights outside of no arm. right now u can run from new gate to level 1 to new gate to level 1 before you run out of food.
---
If this is real Im SO sorry...
---
I went on a loaners stream and asked why he was staking when he had no money on his inv. got banned immediately after asking
---
[removed]
---
Thank you for the interesting read. I haven't been on 330 since getting my construction up, but this was very interesting to read.
---
If this is how you feel when someone insults you as a grown person on a medieval game made for children in 2007 then you haven't learned how to handle your emotions.
---
Hey I have trouble too finding ladders, etch.
---
Which plugin do you use to highlight them???
---
Could you write my university essays for me? Please. I'm serious.
---
meh, you‚Äôre right there was loads of awful non reputable people advertising but it wasn‚Äôt a problem. leeches were aware which players got them the quickest/most consistent times+xp and simply stuck with them.
---
&gt;It wasnt me first of all
---
Jesus christ people are getting offended *on other people's behalf* now. Good lord.
---
Yesssss please. The whole wilderness needs rework tbh
---
or used to disrupt someone trying to box in wild
---
make it unuseable in single-way combat
---
Also should make the opposite version, calm
---
hey mr.i hate disabled people, i use the object markers plugin. hope that helps you find your head that hopelessly lost up your ass.
---
Thanks for letting me know what went on in the pic with that *bang*
---
Just delete the bots 4head
---
How come it's always Asian people who are able to do this type of shit? Dude doesn't even have a neck beard.
---
ur supposed to do revs skulled for better gp/h. This negates that
---
We want people staying at rev caves longer so you lose more when you die.
---
10 vs 1? you choose to stand alone
---
all revs are aggressive but adding more is fine. 
---
skill reqs kinda suck for pvp. it's a shit situation it even exists for b gloves. What if you needed 500 bh kills to kill vork. not a fan at all.
---
I dont mean that they should copy paste the runelite client, I mean they can work to make the OG one better
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
object markers! really helps with cave entrances and MLM struts/ladders too
---
why falador?
---
&gt;People will still host like they did before, no?  
---
  
---
That's not necessarily true.     
---
Most of these dirty tactics used were employed to keep new people from learning how good the money is when majority of guests enter your house.   
---
This only worked because very few people either;   
---
**A.** Had a max house  
---
**B.** Were curious enough to see if hosting was worth doing, and...   
---
 **C.** Were able to auto-type on an alt being ran on another device. (This also required bonds or money to have membership FYI)    
---
    
---
A surprising amount of players never truly questioned if hosting was really worth doing in terms of profits and when they do, they quickly realize they don't have everything they need to host.    
---
Lots of people only have one computer and mobile didn't exist for most of this time period.   
---
So they would have had to use a Virtual Machine (A computer within a computer) which requires your PC be quite powerful, or a Virtual Private Server (VPS) which is a computer you access from your internet browser and which costs money to run.  
---
As soon as they realize it takes effort. They leave.   
---
And the few people that actually give hosting a shot, get turned away by the toxicity, spam bots, having their alts banned, and not having anyone enter their house because they were new and unfamiliar to everyone in W330. And ofc because of rumors being spread about them, that they were typically unaware of.   
---
   
---
&gt;I was reading all at the start, then just skimmed because man, it's just SO long. 
---
I know, I'm sorry about that! I just wanted all of it said in one place once and for-all. But I went ahead and made a very short summary for you in this comment here: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d3vzpd/the_ugly_truths_about_w330_hosting_written_by_a/
---
I think the takeaway is only loan stuff to friends or don't provide 9m collateral for a 6m item.
---
I've borrowed DHCB and Lance from two different friends and gave them back because, y'know, we're actually friends and not just randoms.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is the answer, but the caves do need rework.
---

---
You mean before he ‚Äòquacks‚Äô... I‚Äôll see myself out.
---
I told you not to tell anyone dude... smh
---
Lol I have easily 3k hours logged in this game and have got all my prayer exp through someone else hosting and I couldn't even tell you a single one of their names.
---
Its wild that these guys take this so serious, and its wild that guests play Into it so much lol. 
---
Reminds me of the suckers that give free shit to beggars at the G.E.
---
You definitely just got hacked bro
---
Is there a good reason why 'use' can't be the left click option on bones by default? Or why you can't left click bank with bankers, left click trade with vendors, or left click slayer masters for a new assignment?
---
1) the poison thing is well..not to be rude, but its stupid. Being skulled grants a higher drop rate thus an incentive to be skulled. 
---
2) the single combat would be..im not sure. It would weed out lower levels since they'd only be able to do lower end enemies there, but it would take away the fact its supposed to be a "group" area anyways. 
---
3) the only thing id agree with here would be higher reqs to get in, I.e; agility level or etc. But again this would only effect the lower levels and high lvl clans still would hold it down. 
---
Revs cave is absolute aids and thus I dont bother going. Ever. Its not worth having to tele every kill basically, or get 30 man DD'd for 5k loot. There wouldnt be a real "fix" to revs and i think they're aware of this. Right now its either change the loot table and area completely, or keep it as is which is clanmanmode camping grounds.
---
Thank you for clarifying this.
---
Castle wars is definitely fun as is, but I always feel like if the game had better rewards/a reason to be there, it could be the top minigame.
---
damn and u got it on the 999th fish
---
My reply was on your comment but addressed the entire thread. The whole lot is nonsense.
---
I'm not 100% up on my OSRS history but apparently NMZ was added as absolute minimal-effort/budget content not long after launch. 
---
* No new creatures, just recycle existing bosses
---
* No new terrain needed, it's just the KBD lair 
---
* Literally didn't move anything out of the way, just dropped in a patch of "open" terrain near Yanille 
---
* NPC is named after the RS3 equivalent of the game 
---
* Rewards are just "multiply ring stats by 2 and slight palette-swap", or "stack of obnoxious-to-gather resource".
---
Good.
---
Well if they hire or merge with runelitw wouldnt they basically be copying and pasteing?
---
Charge your phone
---
Agreed. Surely it wouldn‚Äôt take that long to add features from Runelite... if random developers can do it, surely Jagex staff who get paid to work to the game can do it.
---
I was a swapper in a well known clan for a long time. I'm willing to bet that you wouldn't be surprised with how comparable my experiences in that swap clan are to what you have written in this post. 
---
Always thought that hosting and swapping were very similar, but damn if I changed a few names and words here and there it would describe exactly what I experienced while swapping.
---
Naming names is against rule #7 of this subreddit.
---
RL needs limitations.
---
Lol wow just delete your account
---
It could be like alkharid warriors or tzhaar, anything that becomes aggressive on completion of a certain actio
---
There needs to be a tiny empty island directly in the center, so if you fail going either direction you always spawn trapped on that island
---
Naw, you have to wear a trimmed diary cape
---
The real question is... Why would anyone donate? Like donating to female Twitch streamers. Makes no sense.
---
Can we make it 1 rc xp per stone?
---
So he hasn't been killed, ok
---
Nah I like dolphin and whales
---
Thanks! I try to help people understand :)
---
Lol. Check out an inflation calculator.
---
Oh I no doubt glamorized the text for effect.    
---
But I still think I'm being objective here. If you spoke to anyone who knows me you'll know I didn't soak that recognition up.  
---
I listened to audiobooks while I played and whenever people recognized me it would make me either pause the audiobook or rewind. And sometimes you'd forget to press play again. If you listen to audiobooks while you play you might understand how annoying this can get.   
---
I typically couldn't leave chat off though unless I was doing something that was obviously AFK because they might think I was being rude and intentionally ignoring them and then they might not come to my house next time I hosted.     
---
At the peak of my sweaty no-life hosting I'd say you'd get recognized at least 5 times a day if you did stuff like herb runs.  
---
If you used World 330 you'd get recognized a lot more, especially if you visited the GE and typed in public chat where people could see the name.    
---
People would randomly trade you donations even when you weren't hosting and would say things like, "I didn't tip earlier and I felt guilty" or say that they couldn't because they didn't have any money at the time because they were broke, got hacked, or had their money tied up in GE offers.  
---
I really did have pker's stop attacking me because they recognized me. This happened to me 3-4 times. Might have happened more if I wasn't the worlds-fastest-logger-offer. As is, I already never really used the wilderness for anything.  
---
      
---
I'm guessing the reason this happened so frequently is because majority of pkers have high combat stats while the rest of their stats are complete garbage and they'd typically always use W330 houses to either restore health/spec, unskull on steel dragons, or to teleport to clan wars to unskull and re-gear. Whenever I tried my hand at Pking the group I was with would use my house and they say that they'd normally hop to world 330 because they didn't have the max house they needed.  
---
As for clan chats I was invited into the CC I'm currently in because the admins recognized me. These admins can confirm this if you'd like them to. The clan is *OSRS Veterans* it's a wonderful clan for very chill people with 8+ years of experience.
---
They polled microtransactions for early-access cosmetics in July. They have not learned their lesson.

i've actually had to quit games in the past (notably csgo/league) because almost everyone there was such a cunt regardless of rank, things like prime, etc, that was in the past though so idk what state it is in today.
---
Good thing there's a [TL;DR comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d3vzpd/the_ugly_truths_about_w330_hosting_written_by_a/f05k4by/).
---
You do realize that if people didn't donate then there wouldn't be any hosts and you wouldn't be able to train your prayer that way right?
---
Because MONEY. As a business perspective. They would not gain money off of this.
---
I read more into it, Basically, A psychopath is a more severe form of a sociopath. So, that is probably what those people are. But I do think, the internet definitely helps bring out a lot of dysfunction in people.

woah :0 that's pretty cool, sosolid2k is also a legend, he had those Machinima partnered videos which is crazy to think about
---
&gt;So was he.
---
The OP pictured doesn't mention that.
---
&gt;If two women fuck while drunk, are they both rapists and rape victims?
---
Depends on the jurisdiction. Morally? If they're both drunk enough and there were no prior motives for getting them drunk it could just be an accident. It's hard to blame anyone when that happens.
---
Pretty much.
---
Back in the day that woulda been mad money
---
yeah not really a factor anymore because the new POH board lets you one click enter last visited

Because normal rings are piss easy to get, and would devalue the eternal gem heavily

Tell you what. Lets compare banks and see who‚Äôs handicapped.

Also, downvote isn‚Äôt a disagree button.
---
ign ‚Äúthe kehd‚Äù would love to play with you!
---
So you're saying that bonds are MTX, which I agree with.
---
But one comment back you were saying that we should trust Jagex to know what's best, implying that they've learned from the mistake of adding MTX to the game.
---
So why should we trust them on this if they've already added MTX, by your own admission, and polled adding more?
---
this whole controversy makes me nervous because ive already invested so much into my account and have a year long sub. So theyve already got my money, and have a track record of fucking over the many for the misdeeds of the few. i would have to switch to private servers but id probably just quit.  id never get my money back from jamflex anyways.
---
Nobody ever went to varrock except for maybe questing and low level stuff, maybe smithing
---
If she was kinda drunk she might not be in the right state of mind to consent.
---
It's like saying if someone under 18 initiated a sexual encounter or an animal presented itself to you. They may be "consenting" but they can't really consent.
---
talking about all games in general, not just rs.
---
No it's a dual wield
---
Do you have data showing a lack of playerbase growth? Is this actually recorded in a way that is distinct from active memberships?
---
angry ironmen at their bests
---
being an adult is knowing that that stuff isnt good still. Like im not about to kill myself because someone was toxic on a game but i am more likely to just not want to play the game. its not fun to see people just saying a bunch of slurs and harassing people.

Or the guys who made the day 1 Konar drop tables. Or the guys who fuck up nearly every single DMMT. Or the guys who haven't sent the KITS reward for nearly 2 years. Or the guys who... do I really need to break out the yearly drama calendars and point to you how many of them are caused by Jagex's incompetence?
---
You ever hear of Serene?
---
You realize 67 construction with boosts to 75 isn't hard to get and then you can do it in your own house right?

Thats true. But they've kinda created an in game monopoly against team making for money

Why would you think cosmetics are more important than pvp?
---
Good write-up, reflects how immature the community still is. Also, another resistor commented about how these people play RuneScape so much, it's a part of their lives. If you mess with something they see as ritual, they'll attack. I quit and honestly the game is fun but I never see the community maturing. It's honestly sad
---
You're not online yet.
---
True. I saw that reddit post too. ;P bone would be cheaper though
---
That‚Äôs me brother
---
It's not even a runecrafting meme. I'm actually genuinely upset. :(
---
How do I get info to attend?
---
What is the update I‚Äôm one of those rs3 players
---
&gt;Wildy has ALWAYS been high risk, high reward.
---
has it? in the release version of osrs what high risk high reward content was in the wilderness?
---
Yse rune darts until you get better at the mechanics by the time you get 20kc you will have it down I did it at much lower level and felt I would never get it. I havent tried vorkath in awhile but last time I did still easy. It just takes practice.
---
Go ahead and have your opinion, but 
---
&gt; I believe the ‚Äútreasure‚Äù is referring to items received from a player killer besting another player killer
---
Is some serious mental gymnastics.
---
Gg lol
---
This guy is honestly surpassed woox for best pvmer I‚Äôm convinced
---
It's pretty open
---
That makes a  lot of sense. If you kill  monsters faster than you  get a greater amount of exp per hour thus making it easier for defense to catch up? Thank you for the advice!
---
Why don't you go look?
---
4q So
---
To combat a lot of untraceable items from being used in deep wildly. A good handful of them are considered pretty powerful for not bringing any risk to a fight.
---
The agility training was nerfed. You can‚Äôt do it anymore there lol
---
Where do we meet in w500
---
Thanks for this post. I have been a semi regular host for the last year (some people will likely know who i am just from my reddit name) and I AM SO GLAD they made the hosting board change. One of the big reasons why i stopped hosting was that other hosts were spamming their advertisments with 3-4 different accounts which just drowned my advertiser out. Im not about to pay membership or buy bonds on 4 different alts so it was hard to compete when that shit happened. I like the money i made from hosting but i mainly do it because it reminds me of the old days when people would just chill and actually fucking talk with one another. Now a days everyone is so obsessed with efficiency but when i host i meet the people who just have fun shooting the shit. Thats what i play this game for.
---
Ah I see. Makes sense! Now to hit my forehead on a wall for a few hours
---
I'll go with you I have 95 to 96 in all combat stats just message me.
---
who killed this guy doing wildy slayer?
---
maybe take it easy on him next time, seems like you broke him.
---
Yeah it's almost like wildy altar gives you 2x prayer exp per bone and lets you bring noted bones.
---
Like a slayer quest or something. Do we have any quests with a slayer req? This one could be about a bunch of weird new war mounts the gnomes are developing, all with "bigger and badder" mini bosses along the way
---
I voted yes to some but no to others as well. A lot of these were just dumb/bad in my eyes.
---
From it's very release deep wildy had runite ore and I could be wrong about this, but I believe at first that was the only place you could get it.
---
TBOW at 100 kc even... the euphoria
---
*Rendimoto has entered the chat*
---
just delete this jagex
---
Well..hes playing on full screen so the guide seems accurate for him tbh.
---
P.S. runelite offers a stretch mode, which i use. Works nicely - not the super small fixed client size but its not full screen either or huge so i can still pray flick/swap with ease. Also you can move your HUD around.
---
Okay awesome, so the attack doesnt level you since you are mage based i guess
---
Oh my God! THEY KILLED KENNY!
---
does it matter?
---
Be careful at hydra Bc hydra loves to dc or lag and you end up dead. Happens to everyone

perhaps ur right. I may be remembering incorrectly. What year was fally the trade hub?

It would look better if it was just basic armor design but dark purple imo.

 Is there a way to lock your account while being inactive? I don't trust authenticator and bank-pin. Currently, I'm changing my password every month (both email and runescape).
---
 a zune?
---
I had a really old account that took something like 7 tries to successfully recover, every time it got instantly denied until I found some really specific info in an old note book, soon as I entered that info it worked.
---
I‚Äôm not upset? But you literally went on a little white knight crusade acting like you speak for the entire community. They aren‚Äôt overpaying if it isn‚Äôt unreasonable
---
Take my upvote I hope you can get it back for your brother.
---
It was a few drops and then a bunch of alts raking in trivia. Avoid for time save, or alch during drop for a chance at modest dough
---
No, just done before the collection log came out. Not everything is photoshopped.
---
Why are my nuts so fucking big
---
Man my best friend was named Blake. He fucking was always on and shit. He hated doing quests and so did I. Eventually he got good out of no where and I was still a scrub. He payed me to walk him through lesgends and payed me with a dragon skirt (which costed a lot less the. Dragon legs at the time).
---
He then sold the account to me to start a pure named ice fighter, which was as good as his old main he gave me in like 3 months. Then I stopped seeing him
---
Blake, 1c3f1ght3r if you are reading this, go home buddy. Go home.

That feeling when the hacking problem in this game is so bad, people mistake a genuine email for a phishing attempt.

Damn the mad cunt actually went and got 80 runecraft

it‚Äôs all common sense stuff. i guess it‚Äôs cool to have it confirmed but it‚Äôs more clickbaity than it is an expos√©
---
Couldn‚Äôt they have like a whitelist of clients? So only the Jagex client, and a few approved 3rd party clients like RuneLite are allowed?
---
Add me rsn PoachedLion
---
To be fair there are a lot of pkers at wildy altar nowadays, lots of duos too.
---
Maybe he's australian.
---
I would play again if they added stealing creation

Girls? Gay guys?

More people wear armour than people who do PVP.

An absolute unit

Now, is it a sewing needle or a heroin needle?

Probably sitting down too much playing RuneScape.

I spend more than that on a pack of cigarettes and a drink, he‚Äôs just complaining to hear himself at this point
---
nice
---
Lol you definitely deserve it
---
The default client is perfectly fine, y'all are just being babies. Third party clients and multi logging killed the spirit of osrs so much more than anything else.
---
It was an update to make hunter easier, and is still less efficient for gathering birds nests compared to Giant Mole. Stfu salty.
---
Yeah when I started reading this I immediately thought about her, she probably is the worst! And it's probably a dude with a girl name lmfao

Stop being a whiny entitled bitch, no one forced you to do this.

You don't need a new computer if your IP is leaked. You can always get a new one.
---
&gt; rest of those are meh tho just giving information for stuff we had methods for before clients were a thing
---
You can say that but look at ToB immediately after an update. Players play like monkeys bc they don't know what they're doing and just click when their clients tell them. I agree with your point about Demonic Gorillas tho, I think a lot of RuneLite/OSB plugins are broken too.
---
osrs has mtx as well, obviously not marketed in nearly such a predatory way as rs3, and not the same extent, but our version isnt completely innocent either 
---
this was already posted though https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d3a2j7/uk_parliament_and_jagex_with_regards_to/
---
I don't get this mindset.

Untradable upgrades are far less common than tradable upgrades. That is factual, and it's not new information.
---
What size monitor are you on and what's your scaling % in stretched mode?

Imo 9/10 people who rant about tbow being OP either don't understand relative weapon classes or have never used one. 10-20% increase in damage per second of niche use cases for a weapon that costs 10-100x the weapons it gets that much of a dps increase from is just not "op"
---
I'm not salty. It doesn't affect me really. But it was definitely an update to make Ironman pvm easier and you're delusional if you think it wasn't. The concept of hourly lump sum Hunter xp could have been done without making brew supplies more plentiful. Making the hunter method give bird nest was a clear appeal to ironmen.

Just think about that.  Wtf was that line? I get what you were going for, "bringing thing to light", blah blah, but that's such a bad way to say an overused expression.
---
There is not. Most afk crafting is blowing glass I believe.
---
It feels a bit odd that the proposed shortbow doesn't have a spec. If it requires higher tier logs to craft (and presumably a higher ranged level to use), I don't see it being a problem to let it use a spec as well.
---
Logically, it would out-perform the msb. Such is the nature of gear progression. But, regarding the current suggestion, I'm in favor of having a Redwood Shortbow/Longbow added.

Hello.
---
My name is iAmNotSharky. I am a rank in 07 altar, you might have heard it before. 
---
I used to host at Rimmington about a year ago and I was a common hoster, until I became busy with things IRL and wasn‚Äôt able to host as much as I used to. 
---
A lot of what you said is true in your post, as I have also experienced part of it myself. I have had other people‚Äôs advertisers run in my house and I couldn‚Äôt kick them because they‚Äôd keep running away and I‚Äôd have to be a square from them to kick them. It‚Äôs ridiculous and funny lol but really mean what they did. 
---
I remember a lot of the drama that went on back in the day and it only got worse until this update which solved it. 
---
I heard of some things that went on, in particular some host bots... people who hosted but didn‚Äôt interact at all, and would host non stop. 
---
They had bots out the portal who were programmed to force report other advertisers to mute them and lock them out of their account in order so that people would only see their advertisers. Believe it or now it‚Äôs true. It was a war zone and I knew people who were affected by this. The toxicity was really strong amongst hosters. I am glad and happy to say that I did not take part in any of these things, simply because it‚Äôs not right to do so. 
---
On the good side, this update gets rid of this which I am glad, but there is a slight downside. 
---
The cc [07 altar] helping advertising hosts on w330, which has been around for over 10 years is indirectly affected by this. 
---
We have always helped tell people who is hosting and such. 
---
People would join for this to know who‚Äôs hosting and for the social community we are. Now, people will just go to the noticeboard, cutting down our numbers slowly over time because they won‚Äôt need to know who is hosting. 
---
On the other hand, it might be a good update for our CC though, because we will always know exactly who is hosting at any time which might help! :) but I am glad the majority of this drama is over, but I just see in my opinion things getting worse.
---
The hosts that are protesting this will continue advertising wars and their stuff. Of course the noticeboard helps, but having an advertiser is always a plus. It‚Äôs like an extra leg. It makes the hosts more noticeable. 
---
Anyways I am happy this has been brought to light. As a fellow member of the [07 altar] and prayer training community, I would like to sincerely thank you for this post. 
---
I myself have always been kind to my guests when they came to visit, and made them feel welcome. I just wish and hope everybody can do the same, not for the money, but for the community and for the good of their hearts. The past is gone, the present is here, cheers to the future, and all in good cheer!
---
at least that riding sounded fun

WAAAAY too much to read. Can somebody plz give me a summary of this?

Because something isnt farmed 24/7 by every player in the game, that makes it dead content?
---
I've done some Sarachnis on my iron recently, i spot other players there frequently. Hell i even got crashed by a max main with scythe, presumeably there for pet. Its a good beginner boss for players without max stats/gear that want to try pvm.

Idk why people are down-voting you lmao anyone who‚Äôs truly played this game back in the day knew how fun fashionscape was walking around Varrock

okay thanks, i see other people blurring so i thought that i should.

I did ZMI to 77 as it was the most tolerable method. Try not to focus on or even look at your xp/hr rates, levels, etc - it'll just burn you out. One lap at a time mate and you'll get there
---
Yeah and it‚Äôs terrible design but it has 100% increased the popularity of the game. Most people that play now are in college or have full time jobs and can‚Äôt grind slayer to get base 80s or 90s combats. With nmz they can and actually approach endgame stuff while spending their free time able to quest or slayer 
---
I‚Äôm not a huge fan of it personally and it annoys me that people can literally be maxed within a couple weeks at work but it has without a doubt helped the game as a whole IMO 
---
I think a better compromise would have been to keep it as afk as it is but cap xp rates to like 50-60k/hour. It‚Äôs still a lot and people would do it but it wouldn‚Äôt be nearly BIS melee training
---
Hello my name is Mimic Angel. I have been playing Runescape since before 07. I have watched the PVP system go through many changes over the years. I remember when our right to free trade was taken away to combat RWT. This in turn took away the possibility of receiving any loot after killing a player. Thus the original bounty hunter crater was born to keep PVP alive. 
---
After that similar to the Bounty Hunter and PVP worlds of today. The original Bounty Hunter and PVP worlds began. In these worlds you could gain EP (Earned potential) while being in a non safe zone. The amount of EP you earned over time would be based on your risk while in the non safe zone. The higher your EP, the better the loot you got when killing another player as a drop. This would be completely random loot (plus the roll at getting a PVP weapon or armor). 
---
So here is my suggestion. Get rid of the bounty hunter store! It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Bring back EP! If a player wants a roll at getting something like PVP weapons or whatever else that‚Äôs chalked up. Then by all means they should have to earn it. If you think about it. This would be the best update to BH worlds, hands down. LISTEN! This is how BH should work. You‚Äôre in a BH world hunting down your target or being rogue. (This is the premises of BH). 
---
EP SYSTEM: while in the wilderness you will gain EP over the time you are in it. The higher your risk, the more EP you get during that time. When ever you kill a non target player your EP will be used and reset to a calculated percentage based on your rogue kill streak. Whenever you kill a target your EP will be used and should be reset to a higher calculated percentage then a rogue kill, based on your current target kill streak. 
---
EP REWARDS: Their should be a EP drop table made. The higher your EP the better your roll on the table. This could have corrupt and not corrupt PVP weapons and armor on it.  Free to play BH could be a thing again with corrupt dragon weapons and armor. Giving them a taste of what they used to have and are missing. These weapons and armor should degrade once used becoming non tradable. They can disappear after some time or after a certain amount of attack‚Äôs. If you risk this item on death and lose it upon your death. The player who killed you will receive it in their loot as repairable corrupt version of the weapon or armor being reset on time or attack‚Äôs. They can choose to keep it and use it or take it to a NPC that will repair it making it new and tradable for a fee.
---
You could add the existing BH store items to the drop table. All accept the rune pouch. This item needs to be moved as a reward to somewhere else other then PvP. It‚Äôs not just a PvP item. I think the wilderness elite diaries myself have high requirements and lack a substantial reward for having them. Maybe there might be a good choice? You could buy it from the NPC who gives the free once a day at the mage bank. Price could be according to the level of the diary you have completed. Easy diary 1m, Medium diary  750k, Hard diary 500k and Elite diary 250k.
---
Please for the love of OSRS let us all vote and make this happen! Thank you - Mimic Angel
---
GOals!!!
---
Its always been like this. People dont want to associate their reddit account with the osrs account.
---
With Jagex's lacking account security and reddit essentially being a backlog of info on people its possible to have given out answers to security questions years ago and the account may ba able to be recovered througu that.
---
Something like on a /r/awww post saying "Oh, my first dog Jade would do that too." Could answer the security question "What was your first pets name?"

Really? How often do you get attacked bro?

I just wrote like 10,000 words on very specific niche social issues occurring in a early 2000's point-and-click child's medieval game regarding toxic greed over digital gold, and that one specific quote is what bothers you most about all this?
---
Im at 65 trying to get to 75 wanting to same myself into a loop as well
---
U mad bro?
---
I have stopped playing OSRS now but Construction was my first 99. I enjoyed hosting a lot. I had a few rules for myself though:
---
1. Never bring up donations.
---
2. Host at Yanille. 
---
3. Assist players where possible. 
---
I think the longest I hosted for was 18 hours. I hosted in Yanille because at the time I was doing this, rarely anyone had all the utilities like Occult altars, portals everywhere, etc. My third rule came to be after visiting some other hosts and noticing that they blantantly ignored guests asking for help or just turned them away. 
---
Now donations. Donations was never my reason to host. I did it because I liked talking to people. I always told people who were interested in hosting to not do it if they were doing it for donations because it doesn't work. It might be different at Rimmington but Yanille is (or was) a lot different.
---
Bro... What. Is. This..

DRAMAAAAA

Thank god I have my own pimped out POH lol.

This dude definitely makes a shit ton of cash doing black market inferno.

any kind of ironmen are the only players worth killing imo

It‚Äôs legit but for some reason they address you with your first ever username.

God damn lol! That's the most *Edgar Allen Poe meets Drudge Report* OSRS post I've ever seen.  
---
Thank you for sharing that, that actually made me laugh out loud.
---
Spin flax lol
---
How much spec does it take? 100% im guessing
---
Ok then let us fix that together. I couldn‚Äôt think of everything myself. What suggestions do you have to fix that clause in my suggestion. I knew I would be missing some things. I do think this would be great for BH and would like to work it out
---
Hey dude I got to 80 when I played. What made it a lot easier was doing farming runs, herbs and allotments with contracts etc. It really breaks it up
---
is this really in the game? Runescape 3 tier design.
---
Maybe someday, as a community, we'll all be less "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" every time something changes.
---
It has a special attack bar, so when you switch to your spec weapon, you can do it in the same tick
---
This is fucking stupid. Go outside.
---
NP! Thank you, for taking the time to read it all.
---
What if I only apply the EP drop table to target kills? Making rogue kills without reward. As I doubt someone could keep getting a clan member as target every time
---
What is this survey?
---
okay, great. that wasnt my question. is there any reason there isnt amethyst darts in the game? physically and lore wise it would only make senese to have them. i was wondering what actual significant reason is there no amethyst darts
---
I realized after I posted, my bad üòä
---
&gt;Msbi&lt;blowpipe&lt;chins right?
---
Wrong. That's not a progression, those are three completely different weapons. MSBI is a good starter weapon and something to use if you become poor, Blowpipe is an all-rounder that's BIS in a fuckload of scenarios and is expensive (but manageable) to use, China are only used for training and arma gwd because they're too expensive for regular use.
---
You don't swap out Chins and Blowpipe, you use them in different contexts. That's what a good new weapon would be, something that fills an empty niche.
---
&gt;I trained my ranged up till 94 via slayer and it was fuckin slow with mbsi.
---
Don't fuckin do that then. Why would you think that a weapon that costs less than 1k and two emblems be a good way to get to 94 ranged?
---
Same (when my main was busy and my alts didn't have a max house yet).   
---
But some hosts just had really good house layout and I'd just choose them because they were the only host to have a spirit tree / fairy ring combo and a decent layout.
---
Lol fuck that guy Aful then
---
&gt;amethyst darts would be cheaper than rune darts and better than rune darts
---
&gt;&gt;i was wondering what actual significant reason is there no amethyst darts
---
Can you read?
---
English, same effect really, though maybe my mum would disagree.
---
Yeah I was misinformed. Two other people left a comment that broke down the explanation for why this was the case.  
---
That's much better than how I thought it worked.

You can scale up the interface in RuneLite--makes it much better.

I actually play on a vertical monitor, which is perfect for this game.

Sound for Mage prayer and Animation for Range prayer. The sound happens before the animation for the mage attack and the reverse for the Ranged attack. It also helps becuase you're only listening for one sound and watching for one animation. It's so hard to mess it up that way.

This is probably an unpopular opinion and I'd like a decent discussion about this rather than just hate spam but why would everyone be so upset if they lost their client? 
---
Shouldn't people expect that playing a game based in 2007 era in 2019 it's going to have its quirks and problems that newer games do not have? 
---
Also (yes I know this game is a grind blah blah blah) but have people become used to the client telling you what to do, for example telling you where to click and what to do when bossing, it loses discovering the game, learning things? Seems like people want to have the max exp/gp ph rather than enjoy the game and learn things (which I am guilt of doing to!)
---
Have people become to dependant on the client that much that they will quit the game rather than using the default client?
---
I've never used any sort of client apart from the official one, and I'd just like some clarity as to why everyone would be up in arms about this! 
---
Thanks for listening :)

---
I wish all clients were banned, and Runelite integrated into the game client. Although I use some of the features of Runelite that make the game unfairly easy, I'd totally get behind banning those. I just dont want to give myself a disadvantage if everyone else does use it. If banning all clients makes botting way harder I am all for it.
---
It only makes sense to have this, but the power creep would be real.

" When a part of the community only wants the game to be easier and safe so they can afk as much of the content as possible is when their opinion shouldn't matter. "
---
If we have a referendum system you also hae to consider this as a valid proposition. You may not like it the least but that's what a referendum system is: also accepting that others have opinions clashing with yours and accepting them as valid.
---
You are acting as a dictator, but then the question becomes: who makes YOU in charge? Who are you? Why would you decide what is best other than best for you?
---
I honestly prefer afk methods like farming, most of my game time used to be spent on games like ogame, tribalwars and the likes. (I quit the moment those games added pay to win methods like buying armies out of hte blue, other than a fixed monthly fee).

most people wouldn't be able to play wow without weak auras.

Pretty ironic to have such a close-minded, childish mentality while playing a video game. How do you know you don't like it if you don't even attempt to even take the first step towards improvement.

They made OSRS for a reason, why bring in this crap

Seriously how does this pass into the game, they really need to poll design choices and stop this high poly, shading crap
---
no
---
You're right. The runelite one is just infinitely more functional. There's some things I want to see that are worth nothing, and some things worth a bit that I don't care about cluttering my screen/chat box with. Runelite lets me have the freedom to filter exactly what I want item by item.
---
Also it's a fairly newer one but I love the seed and sapling identifier for the inventory. Yes I could live without it and did for many many many years. But let's be real, do they need to actually look the EXACT same. I can tell which herbs are which, herb seeds use the literal same icon. That's a QOL that I don't think can be considered cheating ez scape in anyway. Regardless, I'm on a tangent now lol. It just makes the game better Imo

Today in, nobody should care so much about a little part in a video game they write 30 essays of boring shit.

What‚Äôs eventually gonna happen is all 3rd party clients will be banned, but some will creep up that you could privately pay for, meanwhile everyone else is using the shitty featureless vanilla client. So if anything the situation would get worse.

A quick glance at your post history shows that you have a historical record of regularly being provocative for no reason at all. I have little doubt that if I actually responded defensively to you for having what most people would consider to be a rude-undertone. You'd just say,     
---
*"Ah ha! See?? DEFENSIVE!"*        
---
What's the incentive to reply to a person like that?   
---
To *defend my honor*? 
---
Answer objectively; do you *really* want to argue?  
---
Is that why you're on Reddit?  
---
 
---
Because if the answer is no, you can easily edit your original comment to have a less provocative undertone and then link me to the post(s) in question so that I know which of the 360+ comments on this thread you're talking about.  
---
And then I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have for me.

Just go for elite diaries and then go for actual max

For anyone else that was curious, the stats: https://i.imgur.com/Ibiy9Pu.png
---
Shame about that roll-back they just announced they were going to do...
---
What's wrong with it? Genuine question. I played back in the day and recently made an osrs account and have exclusively used the regular client. I really enjoy it
---
Muh red helmet
---
Bro the last question about player support making OSRS a safe space actually scares me. Please don't ruin my favorite game
---
im sorry I don't see arms in colors. Weather it be black arms, white arms, or Mexican arms, your all my brothers and sisters, and I want all your keys. Let me know when you change your bigot ways and maybe i'll help you.

Try torturing yourself to 90 agility for ardy rooftops, then realise that you aren't even fucking halfway and you're gonna be doing the same rooftop for the next 100+ hours
---
If see a guy who always goes to the purple portal and waits for the stragglers before shutting the gate that's prolly me
---
Redwoods are actually from black ops 3, osrs stole it from there
---
The self control to not level anything else beyond 80 while doing the horrible 3 is admirable
---
Bump
---
What‚Äôs swapping?
---
I like the ardy course since you only need to pick up your marks once an hour or so.
---
Beautiful! That was my first one it was so unexpected
---
I use xgrace because I can type the name with one hand
---
Lazyscape amiright
---
Shit that's actually pretty crazy. Most doctors and nurses I know (and that's weirdly quite a few) would kill for 8 hour shifts
---
TIL: People have/had better feelings toward tipping people to pray at thier alter for 3 hours than they do about tipping waiters.
---
Voted no on 3 accounts, and one is an obey maul pure. Get shit on pvp virgin.
---
And her other boot in my mouth pls
---
Soon enough you‚Äôll be basically afking it and watching Netflix lol
---
I did one kill for that hard diary too nice
---
Porfavor no please
---
i haven't even attempted infernal and I know that there are several things wrong with this.
---
Jesus you people are incredible. Threatening to quit if they take away your ezscape. They should have never allowed 3rd party clients from the start, how is it not cheating?
---
The way I tackled 99 agility is by setting realistic exp goals everyday. That way by the end of the day/session you have a feeling of accomplishment. At some point you can't just get a level per day and it's pretty demoralizing to see that 10 hours only gets you 50% to your next level. So setting an exp quota, for me, is much healthier
---
Was this like a troll question? It‚Äôs sad this made it through the questions that are relevant to the game improvement
---
I remember MTV Cribs 07 just because the name was super unique and I see him around w420 (or I used to anyways) quite often.
---
10,000 IQ
---
Make it so that failing it, would cause you to drift into deep wilderness.
---
Haaa forgot to change accounts there mate...
---
Dharok to 1 hp, use Absorption potions to not lose your hp, use overloads to hit more and afk your way to max melee
---
No, it's more like they want to accomplish their leveling goals, but don't have the time. It's not unreasonable, but the time gate to 99s or maxing is what makes it so satisfying in the first place.
---
i would actually kinda agree with the forced statement, since the runescape community is very goal orientated and will always do the best method no matter what, like when was the last time you heard of any pvmer in osrs doing anything for fun?
---
I usually scale it down for Jad but for everything else I just like being able to see more of the environment. Especially good for agility pyramid.
---
why is it that when im trying to get my two accounts to pair up as targets they are both 126 combat I have to skip multiple other people 4-7 times on both accounts the same people and i still have not gotten my other account as a target?
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in their territory and should always expect to be attacked‚Äù
---
Your argument falls apart here. If what you are saying is true then I should vote no to anything that helps you attack me.
---
I agree with you that the wilderness is about risk and everyone is fair game but it‚Äôs also obvious that the consequence of that is no to pvp polls.
---
Calling it ‚Äòspite voting‚Äô is just crying that you aren‚Äôt getting your way. It a logical consequence of the way the wilderness has been designed.
---
Not well
---
Not everyone can afford a proper education to learn how to spell you shitlord patriarchy supporting bot, how dare you correct me.
---
Its always been like this, stuff just didn't get aired out as much/easily back then due to less social media presence. 
---
Also theres far worse that goes on
---
I envy him for not knowing it tbh

Use this spreadsheet and plan your whole run with a good rotation. Reset the cave until you are on the right rotation
---
yeah, you show 'em!
---
Runecrafting is too high, make a new account.
---
Can't wait for it to kill every player in the area
---
I got "D1x".
---
Should I host?
---
And it's heaven
---
Why do people get so butt hurt over runelite 
---
You actually typed all this shit down about a FREE thing
---
Because PvP actually has a risk, and no one wants to bother learning it when you can just do completely risk free PvM for the best money in the game.
---
Will I lose my rank if I leave the clanchat?
---
Yes a tattered one that only works for the poh. Maybe he wants the helm recolor
---
If we already have an imbue skill why are we complaining about how shit a minigame is that is required to imbue an item?
---
??? U get one straight after 256 if ur kc was already over before update
---
Stronghold of security part 2
---
I hate nmz it's so expensive
---
Nigga you think the man on the moon is real and sings songs of hating the nogs?
---
Hold up!! op is complaining about 4 total hours of agility...
---
At 80 it‚Äôs now better to go to priff.
---
if it makes you feel any better once you get to 99hp and can brew over Jads max hit and wont be on 1hp to die to the healers that's a legit strategy with veng to kill Jad quicker as he can hit 97 so you can veng him a 72
---
Finally, worthy competition for my region-locked ultimate black man.
---
Basically, keep him just south of the altar and run to the area, log on, do a trade of noted bones, run back up and unnote, then use the altar.
---
I got it on teaks at 66 wc, nice work
---
cheap way to code it: The spell teleports to the jail in edge bank, then back.
---
Ice barrage
---
You in theory only need to pick them up before the update. They have a 10 minute despawn so you can leave them there during your 6h log
---
I was talking about the drama that existed before the POH change recently, not them getting mad that the board was added.
---
Bless by the chest
---
They really shouldn't. Beaver facts guy got the pet under drop rate lmao, and everyone was freaking out and mods talked about an ingame tribute. He didnt even spend that long grinding or get unlucky, and then he quit like 3 months after he got pet.
---
You're right, they should get killed. Jail isn't enough
---
How are the canoes going to get by
---
You don‚Äôt even go here!
---
Im glad i got it, but also sorry i wont be able to use beaver as an excuse to braindead cut redwoods instead of something more productive ingame
---
What I'm hoping for:  
---
* continuing existing quest lines   
---
* land expansions (to Zeah and the Desert)   
---
* a new skill   
---
* updates aimed at lowering the barrier to entry to PvP   
---
* new high level skilling methods that are about profit over xp   
---
What I'm expecting:   
---
* unnecessary slayer updates   
---
* another boss with an over-powered drop table that doesn't add anything that existing bosses don't   
---
* afk skilling training methods to skills that already have sufficient afk methods
---
So? It was good and funny content
---
read the username bro its a known troll
---
Awe üòï
---
Worst part your phone is only at 50%...
---
If that were the case, then the servers would be given the short stick until change finally happens. This isn't something that goes away in a month, or even years. America is heavily divided. It wouldn't be a uniform push to change things. If there was a group that stopped tipping in protest and awareness, that would only leave many employees without pay. It'd be harming the people we want to protect. For it to be smoothly and painlessly, it'd have to start at the legislative level. If it was proposed and brought into effect without anyone losing their tips in the first place (during a time in which they require it), then the change could come about.
---
Be sure to overload BEFORE you go to 1 hp since you need to have 51 hp to drink it since it does 50 hp self dmg.
---
i love it.
---
Jagex was phishing their own players all along.
---
These are the PMs after I ended his lure attempt. I left with an easy 2.5m (whip).  
---
I was doing Zulrah at the time with my tbow and went to the grand exchange when this person messaged me. We had a small chat and left it off at that.  He later PMed me telling me how he and his friend anti-scammed a 3a bow. I immediately knew this person was going to try to scam me but I kept him added due to seeing people benefit from these scammers here on Reddit.  
---
The person starts the lure with him being the bait and I swoop in to pick up the loot and we split it 50/50 at the GE. Then the next time it'll be me who will be the bait, and they will attempt to get me to leave the safe zone using some stall glitch or any other glitch.   
---
Anyway, since I knew this was going to be a scam, I just went with it for a bit to get an easy mill or two, and a threat to get posted on RSJustice. (Which is the reason why I took these screenshots in the first place).  
---
DISCLAIMER: DO NOT DO WHAT I DID. BY DOING THIS YOU MAY RISK YOUR BANK.

Not bots, he actually plays as all of them simultaneously afaik.

How does one crash with a cannon?

You're wrong buddy. Fally was the main trading area.
---
Fally was the p2p trading hub, varrock was always f2p trading hub.
---
Dude I'm American and still learned English through RuneScape
---
I mean it‚Äôs possible but the reasons op listed seem more likely
---
lol @ "once your ip gets leaked, it's game over, you can't ever host again without the possibility of getting kicked - without having a new computer setup with a new IP address".
---
You don't need a new computer to change your ip address, silly. It's not that hard either.
---
Agreed. Some of the plugins to even the normal RL are pretty ridiculous. One that comes to mind is the boxes telling you where to stand on Inferno.
---
in Scaperune obviously

Don't ever mention that rotten piece of content for anything other than fixing how cancerous it is.
---
How does runescape help you with english?
---
Imagine turning to them &amp; at the top of your lungs screaming TASTE VENGEANCE! then they just start feeling bad
---
Actually the occult change would benefit mage bandos where accuracy is more important than damage. Good update but forcing me to do LMS to get it was bad design.
---
I voted yes for the taunt even though I don‚Äôt pk anyone.
---
You get 5 agility xp at the very end. If you succeed.
---
Ok zank you!
---
I learned to type 130+wpm from runescape
---
thanks dude
---
I mean he's gotta afford his full rune (t) somehow. On a lighter note at least he won't be a nmz prod. I hate Slayer but I won't be max combat until Slayer provides so.
---
You‚Äôre awesome! I‚Äôll let you know, not sure if im online or not at that time yet
---
well most of it has terrible rewards compared to bosses outside the wild.
---
Nice knowing this thread
---
Any gear setup you recommend? Got 34m to use
---
Except.. you're being told where to click.
---
I feel like this guy's playing the wrong game if he wants easy outs...
---
i support this message
---
except rendering yourself and dding which is mega aids
---
You would be eligible to vote for pvp updates if you have been killed in the wilderness surely?
---
And the same argument was made about claws before - if you want to use them in the wildy, go do 100 cox. That doesn‚Äôt benefit anyone if you apply it across the game.
---
what slayer master assigns that?
---
It's been a long time since I've done Zulrah, but I recall just clicking on what phase comes up and Zulrah helper figuring out what rotation I'm on using that. After hundreds of kills using Zulrah Helper, I tried putting it down, but ended up realizing I was still dependant on Zulrah Helper.
---
Bot farms vs making PvM slightly more accessible are two totally different things. You're still physically *doing* the activity and making all the same clicks a normal player is. You just come off really elitist about your PvM, lol.
---
Not sure what that last line is supposed to imply, I'm definitely a PvMer. PvM is my favorite content in the game.
---
Disclaimer: I just came back from a 2 year hiatus, and am working on a low level ironman. I'm definitely not relying on a client to help me PvM, I wasn't even around when Zulrah Plugin was. I just don't mind other people using them.
---
You came in to this comment chain and started being a piece of shit before anyone else...
---
I don't understand how it's possible to get scammed by these guys if you just keep everything in your bank?
---
Rendi also streams
---
It's a decapitated head of a bot
---
He may have been drunk too, you never know
---
Someone in my cc is doing fight caves with 1 prayer and 1 def right now, so it is possible
---
Super helpful thanks, currently 62 HP, I think I'm going to get 60 attack, 75+ strength and see where I'm at HP wise and then get my mage and range up as high as they can without raising combat through cannon and alching. I see what you mean with the prayer, can always go up but not back down gonna try it on 45 for a bit a see how I feel. Thanks for the tips
---
it really shouldnt matter that much. if u are really getting ddosed. contact ur isp and they will happily reset your ip. even then, ddosing shouldnt be that big of a problem unless your isp has shit infrastructure.
---
engrish*
---
üò≥
---
Just lazy flick but if you really wanna learn I suggest using the prayer flick guide on runelite. Takes a while to get used to but I‚Äôm starting to be able to flick

You know what follows next..

I often find that any students who learned English as a second language, do extraordinarily well if they are playing games like runescape.  Like any language, you will eventually need to practice with people who speak it native or fluently.  This is a good way to do that.  Additionally, idioms are a bit tricky for people learning more advanced aspects of the language, and one of my students who played WoW managed to do pretty well with them.
---
U guys get off by a artwork? 
---
Get laid please.
---
Should have made beaver facts to maximize karma on reddit.
---
15m
---
What does a q p means? Is it a clue scroll step?
---
You can do vampire slayer really early too, will get you a lot of attack levels so you can train your strength with a better weapon. You've got the right idea doing strength first and then attack every couple of levels though
---
I don‚Äôt know why I laughed at that, here‚Äôs an upvote.
---
not even close.
---
The red portals drain your run energy you can clearly see the ape just stood still on the red portals taking damage instead of paying attention
---
yeah well i can type 111 wpm because of runescape
---
You mean like the corrupted armour from cryptic clue fest?
---
Yeah, I took Silverlight out of my combat tab and put it in with costumes where it belongs.
---
Surely you know Drew Gs name, hes always on
---
The mall is like a ags/gmall where it comes from pvm but its used more in pvp so i'd make sense for it to be a pvm update.
---
Im still mad my taunt emote didn't pass
---
Haha. Not long i imagine. Nothing magical about taking 3 hours to do something you could do in 20 minutes. Time is precious nowadays.
---
bam did u see that i typed that sentence in god speed i pretty much blinked and it was typed out already oh whats that i just sneezed and now this sentence came out of nowhere oh my god my keyboard is heating up the friction is so fast i see smoke oh my
---
Tits
---
This is already implemented in game. Superior Slayer monster's.
---
don't waste time on a game that's turning into eoc/rs3
---
I learnt a lot of it from runescape by examining everything and stuff when i was young, not gonna lie
---
Nowadays brits think i‚Äôm one of them whenever i join voice comms, and americans seem unable to process me telling them im not in fact natively english speaking
---
if you miss a few burners most of your guest leaves.
---
I can press laugh or cry whenever i kill someone, this just adds diversity and makes life easier so it dont have to manually do it everytime
---
I‚Äôm at 400kc and still need a guide lmao. I‚Äôm good for the first half but then my brain just forgets the rotations. Quick glance and I‚Äôm back on track for the next few rotations.
---
I wish I never would have clicked that
---
Oh that must have been a qol change cos soon after tob release u couldnt
---
You can either keep track of your buy prices on seeds and only sell the herbs from that buy for a profit (rather than insta sell) or you can buy as many seeds as you can plant and insta sell the herbs you get from that run. Both ways guarantee profit.
---
These are both probably over involved ways of doing it though. If you've got magic secs and use ultra compost you're gonna profit on average each run.
---
There is no way you type 130 wpm.
---
Mobile to the saviour
---
Holy fuck just get off your computers and go outside for an hour jesus
---
game is dead lol
---
Lol
---
Every pker can agree pking is shit money compared to pvm with the amount of time and effort put in, unlike pvm you lose a lot when u die and not risking makes kills harder
---
The only thing that shares any resemblance is the helm, and even then the opening is based on the [Tyras Helm](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tyras_helm). You only think it looks like RS3 because it is rune colored, but we get the same kind of detail on modern OSRS Armors like [Orante](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ornate_armour).
---
thought me 90% of my english easily
---
Then this grown ass motherfucker should learn how to get his ass on the ground and crawl.
---
The likelihood that he knows all of this and didn't participate is incredibly low.
---
Yes?
---
Why not? My form is fucked up and anybody who types properly would tell you that, but I type 130 wpm with very few errors
---
It‚Äôs ok to kiss dudes it‚Äôs 2019
---
Runelite is a collection of many different plug ins. The main fork is fine because the developers remove whatever jagex says is too much.
---
If you code your own plug ins or use someone's homebrew (since runelite is open source anyone can code a version) then maybe it's not ok.
---
Actually yes
---
With some activities such as jad where you need to flick prayers all the time, it's more convenient and takes less time. There's less distance between clicking jad and prayers, which is needed especially when timing can be as crucial as deciding whether you'll get hit for 70+ or not
---
If killing goblins in Lumby it doesn't really matter
---
Ok so you either need a near maxed main or a specific PK bracket account.  Still seems like a huge barrier just to "try out" pking.
---
Semi functioning adult here, how else are you going to get those sweet internet points?

Playing a game to be efficient or playing a game for entertainment and fun.

And replace it with what? You can't just remove a rare item that players have already spent a lot of money on.

Can we stop posting suggestions as this silly yellow text thing? I get that it looks nice and it's a meme but, it's way easier to read a text post than it is to deal with these image. You can even do plenty of text formatting and include images in a Reddit text post.
---
Text posts let the reader choose a font, font size, and color that is easiest for them to read. As an extreme example, A visually impaired person would be completely unable to view your post without passing it through imperfect OCR. A text post can be passed through text to speech and listened to by someone who can't see at all. Similarly, a text post can be passed though machine translation so that it can be read by someone who doesn't understand english.
---
The entire wilderness should be unsafe but it would be cool if you could cast a spell that give you like 10 minutes of passive safety and then has a cool down of like 2 hours.
---
This definitely doesn‚Äôt seem correct to me I‚Äôve never heard of any1 refer to any untradable as not bringing any risk to a fight ever and they all give coin value pretty similar to something else you would be using anyway..
---
It's your overuse of *italics and* completely RANDOM capitalization of words in attempt to add unnecessary emphasis that make this post read like a clickbait Facebook video.
---
On top of that you:
---
* Pull percentages and numbers out of your ass
---
* Insult hosts with words like 'nerds' and 'no-lifes' and make multiple other ad-hominem attacks that, given your "credentials" would apply to yourself as well
---
* State that these people are sitting at their PC's all day long, chatting with their guests and lighting burners, then go on to say the 'money is AFK'
---
* Provide absolutely no proof that any of what you are saying is true other than 'I've hosted before too'
---
I don't disagree that this update was a good thing or that some hosts on W330 are probably a bunch of assholes, I just can't get behind the way you've structured any of these 'revelations' and see this post as some kind of karma-grabbing attempt at a tell-all. It's horribly written, unnecessary, and tried to appeal to the emotion of readers rather than actually being a logically structured argument or discussion of the issues that surrounded W330.
---
When I started playing Runescape, I was a toddler, barely able to read or write. Kept playing on and off since then. Runescape is pretty much the base for my knowledge in English grammar and vocabulary. Learned pronunciation way later, but I was able to read and write English when I was 10. (obviously very broken English then, but impressive imo considering Runescape was the main teacher)
---
Yup... Still, West as given feedback on how to change it, then when he shared a design the wider community just hates it. So it isn't like they are ignoring it; it is just taking a while to get a design the community likes... Kinda like with all the PvP polls.
---
Do quests! Try them as soon as you meet the minimum reqs, like waterfall quest
---
With letters that's how

If you're gonna solo you need to maximise defence bonus for mage if you're gonna pray melee, or vice versa. It looks like you might have a duo partner so if you're just attacking, maximise your str bonus to boost dps and just pray mage. Hard to know what gear to recommend without knowing what you have. If you're tanking (assuming no justi) the essentials are: karils top, fury, dfs, bandos or guardian boots, probably tassets or torags, and max sure you bring an antidote++ or a serp cause krils poison is 16 damage per splat. If you dps just max available melee gear: torture, defender, torso or bcp, arclight. If you do get stuck in the next day and cant get through it i'll probably be back on in around 18 hours (6pm aest) and could take you for a short trip too
---
Meaning?
---
Yeah but you too much learning and the short term loss is too much for people
---
Whistle button on worn items tab
---
The Wilderness would still be exactly as unsafe as it is now.  There would just be new, additional areas beyond it, is my thinking here.
---
I mean I kill kbd with a tbow and 3 other max items + barrows gloves. If I get pk'd I lose like 500k. Not everything in this game is about gp/hr
---
Nope, with the house board it's gonna be a lot more common now I bet.
---
I've been trying to get some of my friends to break that habit for a long time.  It's not easy to get that through people's minds.  Even when they see that the skill gap between yourselves is massive and the better player is telling them that it would help a lot, they defend playing with their wrist because it's easier in the moment.
---
Unprotectable and disable all forms of TP? Because otherwise unless they only spawn deep wildy people are just gonna tab out.

That‚Äôs much better and far less slanted

G Fruit doesnt REALLY host like that anymore but he still comes around the w330 community and hosts seldom on occasion. The post was well thought out and well written as a w30 host who went from hosting 4 to 16hrs a day every week I agree with lot of the toxic traits you point out. Matter of factly myself and 2 other hosts had the initial idea, concept design and etc tweeted to mod ash over the summer that got the ball rolling on this. I love hosting cuz I just love sitting and smoking and talking to all the players new and old and helping those who dont have a full understanding of the game yet. My rsn is Lit Joint / LitxJoint I havent hosted in a couple months now due to irl shit and personal in game grinds but I'm truly glad to see a post pointing out the biggest flaws and issues amongst the hosting community good job OP üòäüòäüëèüèªü§ôüèª‚ù§

I'm not sure if you can start at 1, there may be minimum reqs.  It's been awhile since I've started fresh.

The instant that you can, do it.  It's been my primary agil training method since I got full Graceful.  It's a shit rate, but it's also training fishing at a respectable rate, as well as some Strength XP.
---
ur right i believe they both have blue in them. basically identical
---
Jad is easy shit. I‚Äôve done it without f-keys when I was bored on task. If youre doing a 6-way switch into 1 tick ags spec, or if youre doing 6 jads where you have to do every action on the same tick as a prayer flick, or if you‚Äôre doing 4:0 at olm and have to rapidly do switches without missing a single click and constantly switch between left and right hands, the extra distance makes a huge difference. In the Inferno, you might be in a situation where youre flicking mage range and blob at the same time doing a 1tick mage-range flick. You miss 1 flick and its over, but you have to position yourself in a safespot so the meleer cant attack you after teleporting.
---
Why is the fungus always being sold/bought? What are they used for?

level that agility, having low agility is bunk as fuck.

Yes but you still do Jad tasks

Not gonna lie, never heard of him.

I think one name that sounded familiar was xgrace. someone mentioned them earlier and I think I might have used their house to get 85 prayer recently. Maybe

Vannaka, Chaeldar, Konar, Nieve, and Duradel can all assign gargoyles. 
---
It looks like Chaeldar actually has gargoyles weighted the highest, so she should assign them most often. 
---
I used Nieve until 99 slayer and she also assigned them pretty frequently.
---
ya no

Why save when you can stake?

DHCB basically makes it to where you don‚Äôt need to spec. It would be a waste of time

---
There's sub-10 bosses in the wilderness, (it's not even close to 10 if you don't count the archaeologist or chaos fanatic. Most bosses ARE outside of the wilderness (and EVERY high tier pvm boss) so I'm not quite sure what you mean.
---
I find it easy to do with runelite and watching Netflix. It's not like rs3 where you can set up your camera so you can single click through a course without moving your mouse, but the clickbox highlighting is nice.
---
Is it such a bad thing I reposted it at another time? And yeah, it's simple, people see RS3 they downvote.
---
it isnt and will never be a true 2007 scape because the hardest part of runescape was never the bosses or quest. it was the constant disconnections.
---
Try doing desert treasure with dcs every minute. that is the true defining feel of old runescape.
---
Honestly I could see it as a prayer or an ancient magic  spell.
---
Wooooo wooooo wooooooo!
---
i think that was more when it first opened up and everyone was still putting a strategy together, because you‚Äôre right, those guys cruise it now.
---
Zulrah is no where close to 3.5m/hr. Even with max stats and max gear and hitting the drop rate on uniques it‚Äôs not 3.5
---
This was the kind of pvp update we needed, people are just so out of touch and short sighted. T\_T
---
Rip Cheese
---
Not Osrs but i learned english through a game called perfect world international. i used to be very bad at english. not even being able to have a normal convo. now i got a certificate called LCCI a few months ago.
---
it may not be much but for me that is DAMN huge
---
Only way to actually crash a high level pvmer is to be a high lvl pvmer. Trust me. People try all the time at kq, but I don't mind because all they're doing is speeding up my kills
---
"Back in the day" literally 6 months ago
---
Nice, thanks for that. I've been doing Nieve for a while and not much luck. I'll try like 20 tasks or so with Chaeldar and see if I get lucky
---
Hmm u may be right.
---
This is perfect 
---
I actually lol‚Äôd
---
..
---
you shouldnt feel bad about not following autumn elegys guide to max and only doing what optimal ehp demands you to do; its not like those who did are better or smarter than you. you dont do this because its not fun, and if its not fun, its pointless.
---
Ha! Gottem
---
&gt;Wrong. That's not a progression, those are three completely different weapons
---
Dude if you think thats not the progression you have no fuckin idea about this game. And just fuck off please game is basicly blowpipescape. Im offerin a shortbow.it is not going to fill a niche. itll just fill a missing spot. There is a log type that is higher than magic you can do shield with it but not the bow.thats is consistency.
---
&gt;Don't fuckin do that then. Why would you think that a weapon that costs less than 1k and two emblems be a good way to get to 94 ranged?
---
Yea dude.all the fuckin ironman has blowpipe right or have to hunter for range. For regular accounts, people dont have to spend millions for chins. Also for me i hate blowpipe just a powercreep. It make ranged too op.
---
Total level: 2277
---
It's because you're spam clicking with auto cast. If you click to attack when using auto cast the game waits one tick and THEN attacks. When you spam click you reset it every time.
---
There is the blowpipe. This only gives +10 accuracy.
---
He almost did a no supply run with only 2 crystal bows
---
Blast mining is highly click intensive but very good xp/hr and $. VM takes a bit of learning, highly recommend joining their discord, but has nice periods of afk and imo is a fun alternative for mining training, solid xp/hr too.
---
Do your clues
---
I thought the same thing when I got Vorki at 2kc, but less than a week later I got the squirrel at 65 agility, a week after that Jad pet at 4kc, then finally a DWH 5 days later at 1.5k kc. RNGesus works in mysterious ways!
---
Didn‚Äôt he also bought fake twitch viewers for his stream?
---
It is, lol, there's a stash next to the stairs before you go up
---
That clue step is older than GGs
---
A couple of DMM tournaments ago, Torv got DQ'd for muleing at the GE, which he was specifically told was allowable.
---
No fucking way!! lol I've been doing this for like months!! Checking it right now..
---
Idk if you've ever done any wildy bosses but they are absolutely trash tier for gp/hour especially if you get interrupted every single run
---
Most people are there for pets or they are playing iron man
---
Thanks for explaining!
---
Lmao
---
Yeah man if its headbang with a seercull, nezzy and combat bracelet. Thats just the normal top slayer floor
---
Bandits in the desert are good
---
NMZ magic training. 
---
Dagganoths are decent exp
---
If you train slayer, dust devils and nechs are good
---
I have no knowledge on the topic other than it do be expensive in tokkuls, but wouldn‚Äôt it be easier and faster to mine gem rocks?
---
Ill bend that cracka hoe over and jam her ass up full of bbc
---
worth to me because you're training magic &amp; cb as well, and more afk than bones.
---
Sarasword is one of those weapons that no one really uses unless they are going for 99 strength. I think Jagex is in the right direction buffing this weapon as well as other underpowered godwars weapons similar to zamorakian spear -&gt; Dragonhunter lance/hasta
---
Gaming chair? Lmao welcome to 2019, the year of the bucket
---
Bold of you to assume players can read
---
1/2000 on task, every time I‚Äôve had a wyrm task the place has a decent amount of people there.
---
Seems like a lot of people don't understand Reddit and like to complain about downvotes given out by a system they don't comprehend rather than downvotes given by people.
---
Downvotes are randomly attributed to posts so bots don't figure out how post popularity is calculated. This makes it harder to game the system. 
---
Additionally, there are bots created by people to game the system by automatically downvoting any post that isn't theirs.
---
Then you have those people who just spam click the door and don't let anyone through
---
You think too highly of your own shitty opinion rofl
---
I do remember my password.
---
I just tried to login and I got locked out for security purposes.
---
Then they forced me to change already secure password and didn't accept my 8 word password which is objectively superior and is the standard in today's world. Jagex's pseudosecure password checke didn't let me to use any of my generated passwords and then just blocked my IP all-together.
---
Learn to read.
---
(issa joke, he's wearing a Max cape)
---
OP can you link me to the original complaint thread from the hosters?
---
Best suggestion I could think of would be to subscribe to youtube premium so you can play audio in the background or split window, slayermusiq1s guides are easy to follow with audio only. As far as text base guides go, the wiki is probably your best bet, the quick guides with check boxes are quick nice
---
It doesn't go pass the square. It reaches about as far as bronze-rune longswords.
---
You sir, are my mvp for the year. I should've done more research lol
---
Damnit, THIS is the comment that gets a (former) j-mod reply lol
---
Why do you need to keep a dragon defender if you get an avernic?
---
That's not Bob. That's Evil Bob. C'mon man...............
---
Do I have to finish ds1 to get the possibility to get dragons as a slayer task, or is it unlocked after getting the antifire shield from Duke Horacio?
---
Looks like it‚Äôs Jed. This a text message instead of a DM so I‚Äôm assuming they would have each other‚Äôs phone numbers from working together. Also he replied in the thread saying he can‚Äôt share what Jed did
---
For your inventory you should take about 3 bastion range potions, 7-8 saradomin brews, and fill the rest up with restores.
---
For gear: 
---
Helm: Armadyl helm&gt;Blessed coif/Veracs helm (tank option)
---
Amulet: Anguish&gt;fury&gt;glory
---
Cape: Best ava's device
---
Ammo slot: Elite kourend diary blessing/any god blessing
---
Body: Armadyl chestplate&gt;Blessed body
---
Legs: Armadyl chainskirt&gt;Blessed chaps/veracs skirt (tank option)
---
Gloves: Barrows gloves&gt;Blessed Vambraces
---
Boots: Pegasian boots&gt;Ranger boots&gt;Blessed boots
---
Ring: Archers ring (i)&gt;Archers ring
---
Weapon: Blowpipe
---
Take atleast addy darts in your blowpipe (if you can afford, rune makes it faster). You could take dragon/rune dart switches for jad, but this is entirely optional. 
---
Jad will spawn where the orange mager spawns in wave 62. At half health, jad will spawn 4 healers, which will continue to heal jad untill you have hit them atleast once (each one has to be hit individually), at which point they start attacking you. The best way to deal with healers is to wait for jad to do an attack, switch prayer, tag a healer, then wait for jad to attack again, switch your prayer and then tag the next, rinse and repeat till you have atleast 2 on you (I prefer to get all 4 on me, it makes it feel more consistant when you kill jad), but having dragon darts and 2 healers on jad is fine aswell, as you should out-DPS them.
---
You can deal with the healers on you in a multitude of ways.
---
1: Kill them. Easyest way to do this is tag all of them, go behind a rock where jad cannot attack you (italy rock is the best for this) and just kill them.
---
2: Line them up. Its possible to line all 4 healers up in a single line, thus only having 1 attack you at any give moment, and then just continue to kill jad.
---
3: Tank them. This is not recommended, especially for the first time. since you might need to brew up if the hits start raining in.
---
For jad itself, if he stands on his back legs, he's is gonna do a mage attack, if he slams the ground with his front legs, he is gonna do a ranged attack.
---
For the gear, i recommend taking the highest available range gear you can affort, unless you feel uncomfortable, then take some tanking gear (veracs skirt/helm). I got my first fire cape in blessed d'hides with blowpipe and addy darts (no switches), at 80 range with 70 defense. I had plenty of brews left after the fight caves. So its just a matter of confidence. And dont forget to use your blowpipe spec for free healing.
---
Good luck, and hope you get it first try!
---
They already said theres no DT2 because the 'story is already wrapped up'
---
is he not aloud to make videos about it in his deal with jagex after selling infernal capes or somthing
---
He's just the type of guy who is always "technically right"
---
Sorry for getting heated lol 
---
Peop rwting botting and doing other shit are ruining something that has been important to me for a very long time and it sucks
---
It wasn't 164k.
---
You would be trading outside of the game, which is considered real-world trading (RWT). This is true regardless of what you trade it for, whether it is real money or any other virtual currency. Therefore, it is not legal to make this trade.
---
It's very simple, you're only allowed to trade things in the game for other things in the game.
---
Free trade was removed in 2007
---
Am endgame, am studying and working.
---
Win-win?
---
just use dlegs/dmed and granite body with dsword/scim for start, you should be fine
---
It's not useless if you don't have base 90's combat skills
---
And the worst part?....... Were going to let em
---
there is nothing to be happy about. youre not lucky, neither am i
---
Catch a pussy.
---
This isn't true. If it goes past the square there's a chance it gets mistakenly cut off because of how the engine decides what goes in front of what, but if you take a members weapon to non members it won't use that weapon's run animation and it'll just be glued to your hand instead. You can then test things like God swords or the lance and see they will render beyond the current square most of the time
---
As if the skill cap on PvM hasn't shot up with CoX, CM's, ToB, and Inferno? The average PvMer now beats the best back in Pre-EoC as well.
---
DISCLAIMER: I never used any macros, why would I even use any bots on an account from my childhood.
---
I pretty much just loaded up runescape every few months to check my friend lists, walk around the world and relive the nostaliga. Apparently, I have membership on my account activated which I never did, so I'm guessing it was stolen by some hacker since the account is really old.  
---
I also can't get in touch with JAGEX since the ban is not appealable 
---
Rip majmuncic, I'll miss you.
---
i have noticed that actually. interesting
---
The only ‚Äúgrind‚Äù with torso is annoyingly waiting in lobby for a team and then having teams quit midway through. You can literally get a torso in like 2 full queen runs I believe which is under an hour with a coordinated team
---
.
---
Well u are since u have had 2 claws and besides hitting drop rate don't mean u should have it. Ur luckier than some believe me
---
Except for the fact that gambling is a problem that a lot of people can't break and have little to no self control with, that 9/10 times breaks that person's bank.  No longer having money can be detrimental to ones life. Gambling is awful and only works out for an incredibly small amount of people
---
than some sure, but well below average
---
Flex but okay
---
nobody is nobody bruh they're real people acting like shitheads bc you can't get your ass beat over the internet
---
Yes except he's more than twice the drop rate. You're barely past it and only have a bit better than a 60% chance to have it by now.
---
Yeah well good luck anyway brother hope u get soon
---
WE'RE JUST GONNA LET EM PUT CHEMICALS IN THE WATER THAT TURN THE FRIGGIN' FROGS GAY
---
Y'all scurry in there for like 5minutes in full panic mode and then talk shit if anyone even tries to attack you. Lol

if you wanna say your racial slurs why not try them out in real life and see how it goes

Sorry took so long to respond im online now.

Yea it's great if you don't have an ironman already. If you have a higher level ironman already it's super depressing though, because you lose all reason to play that account
---
Raise your str up to 70+ to increase melee dps. Go for at least 61 range for rcb. Raise magic as well. For barrows do underground pass to unlock Ibans blast. Ibans blast and overhead prayers are about all you need for barrows runs
---
The ban also happened on 9/11
---
Jagex doesn't even want to put in the effort for apis for fan sites such as maxcape.com, you really think they're gonna put in the effort for this? LOL
---
Reminds me of a lizard
---
So you make $700/day? The other guy was right, this is a fuckin weird ass flex

?

Russian music, nah. Not passable.

Can't try it on mobile atm :/

For the users who haven't/can't reach end game content.

The link doesn't ask you for anything other than customer support questions, no need to fear
---
ok
---
It's a know but, according to jagex. I suspect it's brute Force but they insist it's a bug. There's a page in the FAQ about it but basically just says, we know about it, sorry, wait and hr and try again.
---
but i'm thinking it might be something with the IP..., so it would probably have the same result.
---
Original Occult Necklace: +12 Magic Attack, +10% Magic Damage
---
My interpretation was that it means one of two things, though the first makes more sense to me...
---
1. Occult + Attachment: +24 Magic Attack, +5% Magic Damage
---
2. Occult + Attachment: +6 Magic Attack, +10% Magic Damage, x2 Chance to Hit (added after all other calculations)
---
This is very incorrect. If you had high melee stats and low ranged then increasing your ranged level wouldn‚Äôt raise your combat level at all.
---
Duh
---
He does marbles on stream and has osrs in the corner, he also streams in the osrs section when he is clearly playing marbles the entire time. Stupid as shit
---
He's always been a next level memer
---
Is this a random survey people are getting?
---
Most clue rewards look bad, would definitely love to grind for this
---
It is legit. They just fucked up the usernames for everyone. [JagexSearcher Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/JagexSearcher/status/1172613348522962944?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
The ghost town - Madonna is better.
---
it's actually super obnoxious music, him begging people to sub to him, and him giving away money to people who play marbles on stream and win. giving away money is the only way he can retain viewers because it's such an obnoxious stream. he gets ~100 viewers, but i would be surprised if half of them said anything in chat other than playing marbles and taking his money
---
I need one to be able to talk to females pls
---
I‚Äôm literally in the exact same boat. Hit 67 doing Seers yesterday and that‚Äôs all I could mentally handle. I have some other tasks and goals so I went and did some of those. I‚Äôm just shooting for 70 at the moment but goddam what an awful skill.
---
Ah gotcha. Well that sucks then
---
Lots to learn. But gj!
---
It's a joke? Sorry if it came off serious.
---
Or through reporting and killing off venezuelan gold farmers
---
It wouldn't do much at gwd but it would be nice for some slayer tasks if it simply reset the aggro timer
---
Can you show me how its done in getting heated lmao
---
If you're feeling frisky, you could go into the wilderness for a cosmic rune spawn (3 of them spawn on the ground). The downside is it's very deep in the wilderness and its surrounded by ice warriors and ice giants. The other downside is potential PKers finding you and killing you.
---
lmfao
---
Liar
---
Your situation is different tho man!
---
You actually can't do things or have to relearn them.
---
Example (really simple one):
---
"I can't go with you because I broke my leg" is okay, you can't physically do it.
---
The comment above was:
---
"Sorry wanted to add credits but my ADD made me forget about it when I talked to my gf"
---
This is not okay, you could have simply said you forgot it without even bringing ADD in, people who talk like this are "self diagnosed" as well most of the time and just think it's a cool thing to have (because they think you can use it as an excuse for shit you do wrong), while it's not cool and makes your life a lot harder.
---
You are okay man! Really wish you a lot of success on your journey of recovery / bettering yourself!
---
I've also been playing for years, read and knew that line, and still never noticed the amulet. I thought it was a patch of orange fur, and that the line was just a funny reference.
---
I learnt basic spanish killing Venezuelan gold farmers.
---
This is a good idea. I would even give it a lower mage requirement, maybe even 75. I think the implications for tanking are what makes this idea valuable. I personally like the 10 square re-aggro idea, even if the neckbeards cry "ezscape" because really you can tag with darts at lv1 range, cannon as soon as you do the short quest... I dont get how this spell is OP in the slightest.
---
What comes to mind is the green orb attack at Kalphite King in Rs3 (reeeee). Boss freezes the tanking player and charges up a 1 hit kill attack. Another player has to draw aggro and then dispell damage using an ability. In osrs, it could be similar by a boss freezing and deactivating the tanks prayer to hit a 121+ dmg attack, then another player could cast this spell to draw aggro and then switch to the right prayer, or use an enchanted bolt, or a freeze spell, who gives a fuck. 
---
Bottom line is more tactical spells like this diversify combat mechanics without having to add Eoc. Big support.
---
Who cares? Why shouldn't they be able to do so if advertising in-game barely is cracked down upon?
---
Also, don't put your trust in a random video game sub. They'll barely have consistent or rational thoughts.
---
Sounds way too tough at my lvl tbh :S
---
1trip =139k agility xp + u get to bank and sell ur loot in ge sounds good to me
---
If he's a boring, toxic and useless channel, people with any ounce of common sense will avoid watching and the channel will die off.
---
It's simple to understand, jagex prefers it looks ugly 100% of the time than good and 0.5% of the time it's glitchy and the tip is missing.
---
Personally, I don't think completing clue steps in the wildy is a big deal, but a lot of people don't know about or don't want to spend 38k on a Clue Box...but honestly, they should just wear black d'hide. It's cheap and gives MASSIVE defensive bonuses, especially against magic. Assuming they took all the proper precautions, they get mad because they felt "forced" to go into the Wildy, which is "Optional Content" in most people's eyes, then got punished for it
---
RIP Bob
---
And this is why the 75% bracket is a GOOD thing
---
Otherwise more shit like this makes it in game

Ofc, how else would he talk to humans?  You dumb or something?

Looks too evil and doesn't fit osrs.

From a PSA to a suggestion, very  effective.

Just imagine misclicking on the shortcut and having to watch your charecter fuckin rock hop for two hours

Would you consider it rude if someone started barraging the mobs you were slapping about while you were afk for a very short time (20 seconds)?
---
I mean, sure? If you imagine it to look like a butt enough.
---
Yeah, 100m xp I had about 350m
---
From MY point of view, Bob_(cat) is evil!
---
Depends what gear he has tbh. POH not worth it unless you got good tier weapons and decent armor or void. And what he is trying to do, like you need that shit for efficient zulrah but not for Bandos or raids.

If people say he's toxic why prevent him from advertising his channel?   
---
Let the man be, if he's truly toxic it'll die out.
---
Runelite keeps logs of all the drops so from a sample of &gt;216000 we know what the droprates of Zulrah are roughly like, and we know that it's about 120-130k gp/kill atm.
---
I said without a main because my main is non-existent and SHIT
---
uh huh
---
They should honestly just straight up remove it. It isn't useful, it looks like shit, and it isn't even particularly valuable. Seems like something just dropped in from RS3.
---
Grats that's what I like to hear
---
Have u done bandos before?
---
sorry for using 2emojis lol
---
&gt; That's some grade A projection, painting the entire opposition as wanting to spout racial slurs is a strawman.
---
This isn't a strawman at all, the only rational people that would be opposed to such an update are people that like harassing other players online.
---
The SJWs are all for it because they see it as Jagex taking a stance against cyberbullying or whatever the fuck. The moderates don't really care because the rule isn't going to effect how 95% of people play the game, and they'll free up some space on their ignore list.
---
The only people that care are the ones who regularly go around harassing people and trying to be super edgy. And these people know they can't defend the position of "I want to say racial slurs and tell people to kill themselves" So they'll act like Jagex is trying to ban more harmless and common speech in order to make their position sound defensible and get more moderates to come to their side.
---
So basically when you make these arguments, you come off as either and edgelord or a confused moderate. If you're the latter I hope you don't take this criticism too hard and actually think about these arguments and consider them. If you're an edgelord I'm just wasting my time by explaining this.
---
But why'd you make this a picture? It would've been easier for a written self-post then a picture that you have to zoom in on.
---
I always loved talking to people learning english in RuneScape. I used to help out a Lithuanian guy. He was a good friend for a while, we would go pking together when we were noobs.
---
You've pretty much got BiS already, save perhaps upgrading your rune to the various god plates (e.g. a Zamorak platebody is rune with +1 prayer). If you don't already have it, green d'hide vambs are better than gloves.
---
The main money sink is probably adamant arrows for ranged (69gp a pop) and Fire Blast runes (226 a cast with fire staff). Otherwise the ceiling is fairly low, as far as F2P gear goes, but then again so is money-making methods.
---
Your next big challenges are Obor and Bryophyta, and those are probably the hardest content in F2P.
---
Judging by the levels and equipment, imbued heart plus lowest level burst spell means he started with 56 magic, addy crossbow means 46 range. 3 mage levels is 63846 magic xp, 13 range levels is 179903 xp, hp xp gained would have been around 60936hp which means he started at 33hp.

And its gonna make it easy AF profit for bottlers. Especially if the number of LMS players drops off later, leaving mostly bots to ‚Äúwin‚Äù
---
He said ironman. Getting the sweets alone would take hundreds of hours and a single mistake means several hundred hours.
---
Yeah, but usually you would still have some kind of good gear when you're at 150m xp. I could sell my bcp and tassets to feed my construction grind, but then I'd have no slayer gear. I could sell my blowpipe and pegasians too, but I would never do that just to feed my skilling other than combat, because then I'd have nothing left
---
Never but looking to get into it sometime. I have justicar and DWH though.
---
Sorry I gave you flashbacks to Nam man
---
Narrator: 
---
&gt;It isn't.
---
Yea, there's no delay opening the pouches, it's from crafting. If there was delay opening pouches you wouldn't be able to make multiple sets of combination runes in the same tick which you can
---
Username doesn't check out?
---
As long as they're untradable, that's also another solution
---
You can make a f2p cooking main and sustain membership bonds off tuna I think.
---
Congrats lad!!
---
aww shit we as the kids found auto typers to early to boast about high wpm :(
---
Do you still need some? I'll sell you some, just let me know.
---
oh waitttt, i read your comment wrong. You meant a different mask for every combat style, right? Thats an idea i like
---
I do! What‚Äôs your price, please?
---
I want to go end some hcim in wildy now
---
Dev team has stated multiple times that they don't want items like phats in rs3. Discontinued items are no bueno
---
Zap must have bought this trash armor lol
---
no, it can't happen, it's just an interface bug
---
yeah and then combine them together (combining "3" instead of 1 by 1 could be a reward of itself, though I think that's just putting barriers for barriers sake).
---
Human greegree
---
Very good reading comprehension
---
Problem is artists are trying their best to make something cool and swanky but the game is just too old for most people. And it doesn't help that their is no HD. It's just a couple pixels they have to work with
---
I‚Äôm okay with every 5 minutes if it gets this shit removed from the game
---
Around 115m. You can get that pretty quick if you're planning on grinding vorkath for a long time, I think I had enough for the upgrade after a few hundred kills.

What is this ‚Äùlarge community‚Äù?
---
170 ea. Looks like they are really expensive now huh. How many did you need?
---
Stfu Ser3ne. You ever hear of fletching, cooking, wcing, crafting, thieving? All skills that are much more afk than agility and give much higher xp/hr.
---
He's looking at a 5000h+ grind.
---
Why would he want to do that
---
Oh. Very interesting.
---
I don't know hahaha
---
Imagine trying to **bold** a title
---
God I'm so terrified of walking into BA, it's so confusing.
---
God I miss basic stone Falador so much
---
Thataccount makes no sense. Why would you want a point account to be an ironman
---
Marbles??? Wtf lol.
---
Nice try scumbags, its very clear youre trying to steal a split. Good Lord this community is fucking garbage!
---
Yeah I feel you mine was over too at 13 kc finally got it. Feels gud
---
Urg, is that how much they‚Äôve popped up to? Literally last night I was snapping them up for 145 each üòÖ

Probably like 200-400 I‚Äôm after

Kinda amazes me how everyone is amazed by this post. This is maybe the 10th time this year ive seen someone postig it ;)
---
Next month is mine!
---
Not to mention when i read bob on osrs sub my first thought goes to the axe guy in lumby and then to tehnoobshow, not the stupid cat i dismiss at every opportunity
---
They sued a pair of brothers who created a botting client and didn't shut it down after getting a cease and desist. 
---
Jagex won.
---
Lack of HD is a pisspoor excuse
---
It doesn't take half a brain to realize it doesn't fit in with the OSRS style at all- they were testing the waters with something fancy completely missing that fancy isn't why people play this game.
---
Well they definitely botted it so you might get banned :)
---
slayer helm currently looks ugly af with mage and range gear. The three different helms combining would be a simpler way to upgrade and maybe you can change the appearance to the original helms?
---
I need that rng ... took 1700 kills to get my first black mask on my hcim
---
This would be so cool
---
Yeah it did. They added elite skilling outfits to treasure hunter ages ago. They give the normal xp bonus that regular skilling outfits do, plus extra effects. The fishing one can automatically consume all caught fish for extra xp. Literally paying for MTX to unlock the highest XP rates in the game which requires one click every 6 minutes.
---
why is there anything wrong with this
---
The red part on the booty is from all the spanking people with whips gave him
---
.... You can just leave
---
Ok?
---
Not for me. Thanks for posting this OP.
---
That‚Äôs some crazy luck!! Make sure to insure it so you don‚Äôt lose it! Congrats!
---
nor good posts
---
I was 12 okay, i couldnt figure it out
---
Yeet
---
you're spam clicking lol
---
Idk what you mean by the *original* complaint thread. I've seen several hosting complaint posts the last few years, but none of them were a team-effort type thing. It was usually just one individual hosts writing about how toxic W330 is and then getting attacked by the people who commented on it.    
---
Many have since been deleted probably to save face, and for the rest it's very hard to find them because not all of them put keywords like 'w330', '30', 'hosting', or 'toxic' in the title, so they're nearly impossible to search for unless you know who posted them or can find all discord messages of you sending the links to someone.  
---
Here's one of the ones I could find that did make it to the front page:   
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8lrgud/w330_house_hosting_abusing_the_report_system/  
---
As for some of the others I'll definitely need help finding them. If anyone else knows of any!
---
Thanks! And yes that was the first thing I did!
---
It didn't take me as long as you might think.
---
Would never fall for that just look at that tryhard fashionscape my dick shrinks just looking at it.
---
I kill the brothers and then about 4-5 monsters in the dungeon, i get an item roughly every 15 chests if i look at my overall.
---
Probably max combat with like 70 prayer and misc stats.
---
My bwana
---
Also kicks bonerunners for no reason.
---
Yeah was just easier back then to group it into one.
---
Never go above 80% kc
---
Nice one
---
Yeah I read it after typing this, it‚Äôs just weird how mobile Reddit can look this bad
---
Mystic and Xeric, not Mystic and Ancestral, magic in general is missing multiple tiers, not to mention the like 4 sets that are just recolored Mystic (yeah, rune and black dhide have the same issue, but at least some offer prayer).
---
Gz man! If you want to there is a lot of clans for players ranging from casual to serious if your looking for people to talk to and make friends with in game.
---
I don't even host?
---
And you just - actually, I'm not going to say anything, hope you all enjoy being banned while I sit here laughing!
---
mismatch d‚Äôhide? you‚Äôre insane, congrats on mini jad though
---
More likely to get two defenders in the first two kills than you are to go that rare.
---
Thhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhick
---
"math"
---
sorry, not wasting my time on you. if you want to start an arguement, learn the meaning of the words first.
---
I did them with base 85s relatively easily, just learn the mechanics
---
yurr 10-ply bud

Nice argument strategy
---
When did you steal my account?
---
ü¶Ä$11ü¶Ä
---
That‚Äôs the name of the game with half the youtubers and streamers these days.
---
Forgive me if I misunderstood, but how is not killing a host in the wilderness if you noticed it's them is a bad thing? It would be just like it you attacked a streamer/ YouTuber you watch.
---
A lot of people thought it was going to be like the Dominion tower or whatever from rs2
---
It was not
---
Alch your self
---
This is a dumb question I‚Äôm sure but how do people profit from hosting?
---
 Combats have always been Afk
---
B4 nmz it was crabs or gorillas
---
Don't worry. It was only a bot. And as we all know bots have no souls.
---
WHAT SAY YOU?!?!
---
From donations. The more people you have coming to your house the more odds of donations. It's also why he was so salty about the advertisement board updates because now people who don't have alts to autotype on can also advertise their houses.
---
or tele after the second craft. the delays just derail any possible flow in the grind
---
Are you still playing this account?
---
Can you just not steal my exact thoughts. Thanks.
---
Keemstar and iceposeidon come to mind when you say that.
---
Thhhhhhhhhhhhhhick
---
That is ‚Äútenfastfingers‚Äù
---
You don't have to donate. But people do. And they donate, a *LOT*. 
---
This is where the problems come in.
---
I kept all of mine from bronze up to dragon because it looks neat in my bank to see them all in a perfect row. Did the same with my rfd gloves right underneath the defenders
---
I'm from Uruguay, Spanish is my native language. I've been taught English at school but thanks to osrs (rs back in the days) I've gotten way ahead of my partners at school and got able to achieve amazing English skills. So I will forever be grateful with RS and the friends I've made there :)
---
Or perhaps not at all
---
Just like anything if someone enjoys doing something dedication becomes easyer, If I was to dedicate the same amount of time in the gym as I do with RuneScape I would be massive but I don't, why? simply because I don't enjoy working out or care about my size, I only keep my fitness to a standard level, were someone would get pleasure from it to me it's a chore, the same with me scaping I'm sure most people would start losing there minds if they dedicated the same amount of time I've played were I have enjoyed it.
---
Craws bow?
---
Yeah but it's never required or even expected..and I have never even seen any of the big hosts ever ask for a tip. Its entirely your choice...
---
I dont see why it's wrong for someone to tip a few mil to someone who helped you get 99 prayer or helped your money making alt make tabs or use their pool to boss. Can you explain why it's a bad thing?
---
It‚Äôs an abusive relationship, I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way.
---
Lazy flicking is so easy
---
Especially since most weps in this game share the same attack speed with the whip. 
---
I like to lazy flick piety becuz whips attack speed is muscle memory at this point
---
Tick flicking really isnt needed for 99.% of content
---
He's should of just said he was account for invisible levels, then prodced to belittle you for not being Chad enough to know about the imaginary numbers that are past max.
---
Really? What items are like that? Because I‚Äôve been world hoping selling some things I crafted and they get bought for less after a few are sold
---
Like 30-35khr if I remember correctly. Profit is low but not too bad.
---
is that better than torso/ neitiznot helm?
---
Wonder if you are still here
---
Check out my new youtube vid. Loot from 3,000 gargoyles. Subscribe for more to come.

Yes
---
I did the profitable skills first before starting slayer. Figured it wasn't efficient to be slaying with sub par gear while I could do other skills at 'max efficiency' (or at least, max efficiency for the methods I wanted to use).
---
It's not a gold sink if the gp isn't leaving the game
---
Just buy 100 maple logs and try it
---
Saying, "Thank you *insert username* for donating" IS a hint among other very common methods. Especially when those people named never actually donated (because nobody can prove it never happened). If you thank people for donating by name. More people will donate because they want others to see their name in a charitable light and/or because they realize for the first time that donating is even a thing people do.   
---
You're saying that you've never seen a person get thanked for donating by name? 
---
You've never seen a random guest ask a host how much money they were making and the host said, "Not much, people aren't really donating"? Those 'random guests' are very regularly alt accounts being operated by that host to get people thinking about donations during dry-spells. 
---
As for me, I stopped being a host long before this update.  
---
I didn't leave because I was mad or because anything happened to me. I just got tired of how repetitious hosting was and wanted to play other aspects of the game.   
---
I have *zero* grudges against anyone. I didn't write this post because I was upset, I wrote it because several people asked me to write it.
---
b sale
---
Dude Google, "bird videos for cats 10 hours"
---
My cat went crazy for it at first, now she just chills back laying down chattering at the TV.
---
Right click makes more sense. The only problem is what labels it as a "reface north" button after you move your camera? Is it the position? If your last action before clicking it is moving with arrows or scrollwheel?
---
An SCP reference in 2007scape? Nice.
---
Thinking about it, the Temple Knights always sort of reminded me of The Foundation...
---
Or they like being able to consistently do slayer in the kourend dungeon so they can do skotizo and not being forced into specific locations all the time. Or be able to consistently do slayer in cannonable spots. There's plenty of reasons to not always be doing konar
---
lmao hes not wrong
---
Ironman maybe
---
It's not? I never said was it.   
---
It was simply a piece of information used to support the claim that it goes to their head. It's one of the many reasons these hosts start to feel like a player elevated to a celebrity status.   
---
It helps boost their ego to an unhealthy level.
---
Dad (Hard)
---
One thing that worries me is that Jed used billing information to recover the accounts. Information we've been told by JMods he didn't have access to, yet we know damn well he did. They handwaved that extremely quickly.
---
F‚Äôs in the chat boys
---
The only real way to curb the botting problem is to just get serious about banning gold buyers instead of just gold sellers. There isn't much incentive for Jagex to do this
---
lmfao get his ass
---
You get 10 more defenders so youll never need to ever worry about it again
---
Nah that animation is when I switch my music, If this changes i'll be stuck with dead silence if i wanna be efficient.
---
To be honest, I think about the same in OSRS when I see a player with a Max cape. One has invested easily over 1.000, perhaps even 2.000 hours into something which doesn't matter anything in the end - how often you talk about your gaming achievements with non-gamers?
---
But coming back to the bodybuilder on the gif, so what if they are "too big"? He is doing what he likes to do, and at least he can use them on daily life, like I can imagine lifting groceries are super light to him or moving houses goes very smoothly for him. Some people invests their time to other hobbies like music, art or building, and they do have meaning in daily life way or another while games don't. Of course games are VERY GOOD for one's mind as long used hours are fairly low, like 1 or 2 hours a day. I see games being supposed to be a way to rest and entertain one's mind, not take it away.
---
I wonder what all the great thinkers listed there would say when they saw that lol
---
What‚Äôs wrong with ez money scamming is a  memorable part of the game
---
Yeah I‚Äôll take all your money cunt
---
Fuck u and your family
---
No bitch I take all the money
---
That's the joke
---
I guess it would be if they trust you? I'm not sure
---
how do you see their stats?
---
Dude when did RuneScape 3 start looking so dope?
---
Use playlists.
---
Because people but the holiday stuff around hollidays
---
Hear me out. Id rather runescape where that noob is banned rather than runescape that is botted to all hell
---
This must have taken a really long time. I'm happy for you \^.\^
---
My friend knows how to sew and is good with fabric and stuff, once I get my quest cape I might seriously ask her advice and make a real qpc.
---
Sure, ban it. If I made multiple accounts I would be okay with not being able to move items/gold between.
---
Yo serious question what the fuck are those little things of furniture? Like do you use them in your house to not buy wood or what the fuck.
---
Nice, I‚Äôm surprised how cheap it is and glad I was able to afford one
---
Eh I'm a bit mixed, reasonable change (with balancing) but I like the fact that the mechanics of Combination rules are different. Maybe keep the delay on RCing but let you queue actions during the delay so like all the pouches empty once you finish if you click to empty during the animation?
---
Otherwise just nerf runes other than combo, bloods, and souls by like 0.5 xp/ess to make up for faster RCing and Minds by 1.5 because of the TP.
---
and this kids is why meth is bad
---
What about if u get a banana pickaxe or a banana visage
---
Lmao so as you see,, literally before the whip drop I said "jesus 4k no whip" aka I'm 4k+ kills dry of a whip from abby's. It's also VERY timely because my tent whip ran out the next kill after, and that kill ALSO got me 98 slayer :).
---
So 1 more level to go! Woo. Might go for a demonic gorilla task to get 96 att or close to it, then back to hydra for me. I'm 118 CB.
---
thanks brother :) lol; any video' guides you can hook me up with homie?
---
I thought Bob meant beast of burden, seeing as he puts you on that island with the creepy woman and burdens you to uncook him a fucking fish.
---
Damn I hate that cat...
---
+1
---
Not many will upvote as most players are saradomin scum or the odd guthix brainlets
---
lol nah.. still gonna smack you weenies
---
um?
---
that inventory is lookin a lil empty after your first kill my g, lmao. grats!
---
Thats just an infected nutsack though
---
I had only been logged in for about an hour doing clues before I get rangers. There's a timer under the chat box.
---
slayer has profit and trains combats. agility has a good flow and better rates. rc breaks up any possiblity of flow with banking running and an artificial delay between actions. thats not difficult thats tedious. jad, inferno, raids, pking could all be considered difficult. i dont think any skilling gameplay loop could be considered difficult as they dont challenge you to learn or adapt. tedium and difficulty are separate concepts.
---
Alright, here we go.    
---
I was scammed once this way, not that long ago, and I'm very ashamed.    
---
My scenario was the following: someone at ge said that there's a drop party in a pvp world at Varrock west bank, i put everything in my bank and went there. Obviously no drop party was going on. There was a cute noob who was really sad and walked out then got pk'd. He came back and was even more sad, so we started talking.    
---
Cool dude, he "started playing osrs not long ago", and asked me what items i had. I showed him my sgs, he was in awe. He asked how much gp i had, so me being a dumb fuck showed him how much gp i had. In the moment i traded him he stepped out of the bank and the guy who previously killed him ran there and snared me, and yup, i lost all my gp. Fortunately i only had like 7m or so in cash, so it wasn't a big deal but i felt so ashamed. I just got scammed. I always asked how it could happen to anyone, these are so obvious etc. Well I didn't know about the trade opening trick...
---
They are extremely easy to merch that's why. It doesn't matter how close the holidays are these will all be dumped by then.
---
Says the man who has 2277 total.
---
Replace the first one with Runelite for modern times
---
Imagine paying $11 a month for a game but then bot so you don't have to play the game you paid for.
---
Why would you say something like that? Wholesome comments are allowed too, not just hateful dribble. I really hope you‚Äôre too young to realize. If not, stay the fuck away from women and children.
---
I actually saw the first person to trade gets 2.1b in action yesterday. I didn't go for it myself because eww interacting with people, but someone else tried it and he kept asking for their entire bank. Your whole bank for 2.1b, with the idea being after you give them everything you own, then they'll give you 2.1b, but obviously they won't do that. Someone gave them some items, I'm assuming mostly junk and the scammer said 'more items' and he responded with 'it's all I got, am noob'
---
So yeah, that's about how that one works. The other one is probably the same. A two trade trust trade which is the OG scam.
---
Repost
---
I was on a slayer task my man
---
I mean obviously with the amount of bots not only that the gameplay itself kinda makes people want to buy gold.
---
But yea if nobody bought gold thered hardly any bots.
---

This?
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs easy or hard my original comment said it‚Äôs engine work. And my other commenting is saying that tick manipulation as a whole isn‚Äôt a one day fix.
---
As someone with 99 rc, I feel uniquely qualified to chime in here. 
---
[This just about sums it up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxK_nA2iVXw)
---
I'm so used to the delay already it's not something I really notice while I'm playing. Just don't add random variance to its length and I'm fine with just about anything you could possibly do with it.

Hey same :)
---
Where are you buying cocaine for $300 a gram? Do you live in Antarctica or something?
---
this video is clickbaity garbage. jagex has known about ahk bots for a long time and there is nothing they can do about them (hence why the bot maker is giving pugger this info in the first place, free advertising). ik multiple people who have botted 99 mining, 40m+ thieving xp, and multiple 99 magics with 0 2 day bans with just basic ahk clicker scripts/shitty ahk bots that are free for everyone.
---
There‚Äôs people out there that associate muscle mass (like this guy for example) as being overweight.

They‚Äôre all idiots.
---
Easily may take a few deaths to learn the mechanics but I started him at 75/75 when I was a noob. Slower kills and maybe only 10 per hour but still fun.

between the name and the model this thing is unmistakably horny af

Show her feet

You said it, first kill lol. Still getting used to it
---
Hi, I'm 83 magic and recently did a bunch of barrows and have enough money to buy the full ahrim set.
---
I really like the way the Ahrim set looks and the full set + amulet bonus is cool but everything I've read is that it's bad. It also looks like it will cost a fortune to buy runes for ancient magic spells and repair the armor. I'm really really not sure what to do. I want to do Ahrims + Amulet + Ancient magick but I'm afraid it will just bankrupt me. My bank is only 18m total.
---
What do.
---
Definitely follow that guys advice, I'd only emphasize do tonssss of range training if you want to do combat skills anymore.  Itll help with fight caves eventually. Otherwise don't bother too much with combat i think.  Getting wc up is also good so you can go get your nezzy
---
Solution is to just not trade anyone. Seriously theres no reason as the GE is available.
---
RC profit is better than Slayer unless you include boss tasks, training combats isn't really relevant to the time to get 99 Slayer
---
Agility having a good flow is subjective, I like the Rhythm and APM of Lava RC more than Underwater or Ardougne, I cba to do Brimhaven or Werewolf. It does not have better rates than RC. RC has it's own flow and rhythm, just with more variance so it takes longer to get used to and even longer get good at.
---
I think you're being ignorant of the amount of consistency skilling requires just because you see that you can do it to some degree but you're not seeing how difficult it is to actually maintain those rates.
---
You use barely seed for birdhouse runs.
---
Rough. I got mine about 2 weeks ago afking at magics level 79. Good lookin pet tho, took me a minute to warm up to it after wanting a boss pet forever
---
Yes thank you and /u/Kazenovagamer both!
---
Nah mimic is easy with bp
---
Nice got all mine on first drop aside from bronze and dragon as well
---
OP posted this screenshot months ago
---
Literally all of them are allowed. That's the problem. Most used are runelitr and osb
---
no idea. only got one account.
---
Haha, thanks!!
---
I think I already need the helmet at this point :')
---
No I wish lol. It's more just a troll to get people on PC to click on my flair because of the formatting on PC lol. 1:16 is because 76 is the atomic number for the element osmium so 76 seconds is 1m16s. Osmium is the densest element known to man and I'm dense headed LOL. It actually originated from my PC. I built a real custom PC with a gtx1080, 8700k, 32gb ram, 2tb nvme m.2, and all wireless peripheral dongles internally mounted, all in a case smaller than a gaming console. So I named it osmium because of how dense of a build, now it just stuck.
---
is there a thread making 10m with f2p items?
---
im literally runecrafting right now.
---
Thats disgusting, congrats
---
It was very very easy with BP/rigour and im sure itd be fine with just regular dhide/anguish (or even glory). But I am also 118 CB/85 def and 99 range/hp. 
---
With that said you should still be fine doing it id imagine, but check the wiki as it may have a level suggestion for you. But if you got decent enough gear and rigour it should be fine. Or even without rigour really. I over prepared for it only to not eat a single food and it took like a min lol. They made it seem harder than it actually is.
---
I don't think there's too much you need to worry about from a "mobile only" standpoint. There is a lot of content that definitely does need a computer to do, but tons of the OSRS experience is just fine on mobile. 
---
I'd suggest at minimum base 50s before coming to Members, alongside hitting all the point above that /u/PleaseHelpMeffs posted. Then make the jump and pick one of those objectives to aim for!
---
Also, get yourself a dedicated CC to become part of if you haven't already. I'll go ahead and shamelessly plug the CC I'm part of called OSRS Advice. We specialize in helping players to answer any questions they may have. We're a wholesome, family-friendly CC who's always looking to expand!

party hats are produced like 5x more than santa hats
---
I agree it‚Äôs bad but like y‚Äôall bitch so much. I have literally not seen a single person wearing this

if its the bot i seen on sythe, it costs 30$ per for that bot. the dude made 900 bucks already lol.
---
Amen
---
Okay willow ü§£ I really hope you‚Äôre old enough to realize I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your opinion ‚úä
---
Just posted in another thread but im sad that they keep doing these fucking spawns of 1000s of holiday items like phats/crackers/etc and giving them zero value. Back in RSC when they did a limited drop with the system message going out saying they just spawned some and good luck finding one, it was honestly the most fun and excitement. Just walking around exploring..it was fantastic. Now everyone needs a fucking trophy for participating and everyone's got an entitled attitude that they deserve something because someone else has it..its fucking disgusting and in a goddamn VIDEO GAME it has no place being a thing. You arent gonna have every item, and you arent entitled to have every item. Its unreal. 
---
To answer your question though: no one wears these anymore for fashion or novelty since they mean nothing now..so its probably just supply and demand doing its thing. Seriously tho back in 04-07 being able to buy a mask or Santa or phat was that upper tier of fashionscape and it felt amazing. Its just a shame now how devalued they are and its because they keep fucking adding thousands into the game for no reason. Its been 6 years man..had they just done one limited spawning event the rares would be worth something actually now. Think how expensive P hats got even with the big dupe back in rsc just from 02-07 in 5 years they were in the hundreds of millions and crackers/blues over a bil i believe in 07 (maybe not quite a bil yet i cant remember).
---
70 prayer and no rigour so might be interesting! Will report back tomorrow
---
Should‚Äôve posted this at 6:66pm on June 66th
---
Dang. Anyway to access their cc or get ahold of somebody there?
---
Random dude on reddit who frequents subs like r/drugs isn't exactly a reliable source lol
---
big brain, i have failed
---
Let's make a game and not tell them
---
To them swapping is no different than trust trading. They don't offer their own method of it because that would require actually having some form of account support to transfer data between games.
---
Jagex is too incompetent to manage something like this. It is a good solution but Jagex doesn‚Äôt have the means to successfully implement and maintain it.
---
oh man, ectophial was my *favorite* minigame back in the day
---
I honestly was expecting a satire video because of how corny that title is.
---
Stick to rune for a while and train attk to 60, then get ur str up.  Honestly u can rock 40 def for a long time
---
Shut the fuck up cry baby loser
---
Would be even cooler if it looked closer to Eileen the crow from bloodborne
---
Gonna need a source on that one.
---
Ah just keep grinding man itll get there! Once i got 95 I gave up my streak which was at 500 so I could do hydra. Im at 1100+ kc now for hydra which is over 1.2m exp lol and like 4.5m range exp. Its insane how fast i went from 96-99 range lmao. Also made me kinda sad. Im now closing in on "101" range exp wise.
