My mans. I swear to god. I saw this picture on Ben Shapiro's twitter and I instantly thought of this sub reddit.

Man I agree with you that settled deserves to make an income but when you put it that way the whole process of making money through being a Runescape content creator seems like a pretty asinine way to live lmfao
---
No need, for the places it is an issue, just tough luck.  The prices would tank on items if this was a thing.

This is it. This is content.

You're totally right. I just started and I'm doing the f2p bond grind rn, its bad lol

What I wish they showed is a slide saying. Old School Runescape will never offer double xp. Players don't quit and ask for your password to find out why. Beware of Account Phishing.

Idk where you guys are getting the teenage kid idea from. In our community it’s more than likely a super lonely 22-25yo with underdeveloped social skills but a decent income from a solid IT job along with no real hobbies / joys / responsibilities in life to spend it on

This is literally the Art of the Deal at work here. Make some online retards think you expect to them to pay $5,000/hr for a shitty patreon goal so they can come back and say, "HA! I found a way to only pay you $750/hr!"

What's the benefits of using Runelite or other clients over the jagex one?

I can’t afford this but it’d be funny to hear him sing Take On Me and try to hit that high note

idk, it highly depends on what your GM consider it's weakness.
---
But considering it's using melee I'd say use the Wand of Magic Missile and you should be golden.

Isn’t a 2 minute segment way more distracting than a slide show of artwork in the background? Just show 5 or so pictures and have them scroll across the screen throughout the stream.

Yeah man that mindset is definitely what got me through the jad grind after so many failures lol. Vorkath is just especially frustrating because I watch the guides and it seems legit effortless (I know they have thousands of KC so it’s basically second nature, but still frustrating), and I get stacked out before I even have the opportunity to start walking back and forth during the acid phase lmao.
---
Is that a stale baguette or are you just happy to see me?
---
Quality content right there. Rare boss you can kill faster than a steel dragon.
---
That's how it works with fish/fishes
---
Other bossing gets easier the more of it you do. Say someone has 1500 Zulrah kc it’s gonna be a lot easier for them to pick up galvek or vorkath because they’re used to gear/prayer switches and stuff. I’m sure you already realize this I’m just putting it in there in case you haven’t. I also go bossing with this guy who dies every single time. No matter what boss it is. The dude has half the pets in this game including hydra and he dies constantly

Yeah, it really doesn't take that long. I went into it with one buddy, and the rest of the team was either mediocre at any point in time, or probably Actually Helen Keller™, and it took us about 2.5 hours total to get our chests.

play on your zerk and do nmz on main

While I love my achievement cape and understand your suggestion, I feel that 10 tps a day is more than enough.  How do you use them all up? Even doing multiple master clues a day when I get luckily I never go below 2/3.

a scroll book is 8.4k GE price, 16 scrolls per book with each scroll at 1.9k should mean 22k profit for each book ASSUMING that all scrolls sell at GE price 1.9k and book buys at 8.4k which I highly doubt.

I did it when I had a 400m bank and was incredibly lazy. I figured the 8m extra cost ontop of the cost of a BCP was worth the leech. I cant remember my exact maths at the time but it was more efficient according to what I figured out

How'd you find this without a sextant and watch!?

He made a bet with multiple people totalling $4500 that he would defeat Jad without any help/online guides before he flies off to twitchcon in 6 hours
---
he has a lot of bets totaling 4500$ that he can kill jad before he leaves for twitchon eu
---
This is a tragedy
---
He made some bets he'd beat Jad before his flight to Twitchcon... He has 3~ hours left now before the flight leaves.
---
He's made bets with about 10 people that he'd kill it before twitchcon, which his flight leaves for in like... hours. The bets add up to around $4.5k.
---
He thinks that you can't flick the range one because the sound comes so late, so he's flicking back to range after every mage, but his instinct keeps making him pray back to mage just because he's hovering over it.
---
Ah, so that's why elites are so garbage and not worth anything other than trading for a master on OSRS.
---
it’s snowflake, the troll in Weiss.
---
Papa Smurf can I lick your ass?
---
He has a notepad document of bets totalling to $4500 that he won't kill it before he leaves for Berlin. He's committed to paying out even though he knows like 2% of the people who bet against him will because he was so confident he would win the bet, but now he has 3 hours and is almost out of strawberries PepeLaugh

How does one actually afk at NMZ for 20 min? Can you actually start the instance then leave for 19 min and 30 seconds, then come back with the character still fighting not logged out?
---
The crab meme isn't from this sub at all
---
Out of the loop?
---
I cant find the meme
---
No lol.
---
probably someone that uses a macro just like those who type in cyan all the time
---
Ya I see what you mean. I prefer that too, but some clue steps are more often than others... 10 teleports to twiggy o corn for the clue step near the willow trees there is gone within idk 30 meds? I’d be happy with 25 of each to be honest, or 30. Then it has more use.
---
30m in gear can net you 10m/h. With full BiS + efficient runs etc you can go up to 20m, I did the math using the lower end of the spectrum tho for this exact argument ;)
---
And as for "3 other people who never let you down and always raid with you"... That parts really simply actually. There are tons of high level clans, and considering how much better ToB is compared to any other money making method you can almost always find a team in the more active clans.
---
i was looking for my shoes this morning, give them back!
---
Well if that's the case then its not really unlucky.
---
Wondering how much they sold for?
---
I just don't understand how consistent I need to be. Do you start a new run as soon as your current one is complete? Some patches will finish before others so do you harvest those first or do you wait for **all** of them to finish then harvest all and restart?
---
I just feel like farming effectively requires a lot of questing first, to unlock all the teleports and patches required. It just puts me off.
---
Everything
---
Ask them how much
---
Bet.
---
If you're trying to get boss pets/drops on the side, you could try killing Vetion. The kills are slow, but you get 5 chances per kill, it's more fun, and you don't need to risk alot to kill him. I got the scroll off one of his hounds after about 400 kc.
---
Tbh they should buff that jumpscare at least give it the acb spec sound
---
Jagex listens too much to the community SMH

Are you sure? I haven't done NMZ in a year, but last I checked full obby was the next best thing after dharoking. I may be wrong though.

Can you insure it as an UIM?

Lmao rip
---
Also:  to anyone following this and going "when the fuck would I ever use peoples or persons?" you don't have to. I'm not stating grammar rules, I'm just explaining how language is really fluid, and how language nerds sometimes adjust the game to have more fun/be more specific. You could easily just use people and person forever and be fine grammatically speaking.

Excuse me

What the fuck.

Can I be the one to repost this next week?

I'm a new p2p player and I've been having a lot of fun playing around and training skills, except I really hate agility but I know I need to train it. Is there anyway to train agility without wanting to just stop playing the game altogether?

Assuming you're melee and Dharoking
---
Ice Troll King, Arrg, Moss Giant, Draynor, Dad if you want max xp but Sand Snake instead if you want to AFK.

Where is this?

Gz, go alch yourself

It's probably quicker to finish the kill and move on tbh

But the context we use it in is from the sub

This post was brought to you by Settled™
---
He doesn't say how to deal with Dad smacking you around.
---
Alright. I came across some player doing this repeatedly, it became REAL fucking annoying cause I don't really afk, I split screen netflix so I'm sitting here after every kill, killing some 1/3 dragon, I was like wtf?
---
Because it's a UIM
---
Yes, as long as you deal more damage than the bot does then you’ll get the drop
---
I run BCP/Veracs skirt. Sue me

I can’t wait for another month to see this baby reposted
---
He has played runescape before but his current account and skill is pretty new, he is one of the best raiders in world of warcraft but due to it being sort of stale right now he decided to play osrs. He plays ironman (btw), tries to learn everything on his own, test mechanics and do quests without guide. 
---
His struggle with the fight caves can be attributed to his scuffed gear and the stress of possibly losing $4500 dollars. His restriction is based on the fact that he has to leave for twitchcon in just a few hours and the bet ends then. So either he has to kill it this attempt or lose the bet. This is also his 4'th attempt total on this, reached Jad twice I do believe.
---
errm could you explain?
---
Found the guy who spent 50m on the parrot.
---
Take it back to sherlock if you’ve done it. 
---
And to tag a post as a question make a comment of literally just “q”. Theres a bot that searches for single letter comments, it won’t see the comment if you do anything other than just 1 letter. No spaces, don’t hit enter, don’t include another comment with it, cuz that wont work
---
Rolled nothing on the rdt. Unfortunate. Rdt roll is a punishment.
---
Lmao that’s definitely how you’d find an rs player
---
Ah, thanks
---
What kind of scroll was it
---
You’ve got no idea what the rest of the fit looks like m8 , and the shoes are neutral and look fine. But talk shit post fit
---
Million easy
---
As a Royals fan I am hurt by this.
---
But also yeah we suck.
---
2nd drop was rdt. Rdt has a nothing drop on it, and you got the nothing drop
---
75 is 1 10th of 99. You can't make a legitimate argument for 70 requirements being too high.
---
That’s rough. I didn’t have diaries either but I got mine in about 150 kills
---

Are you an Ironman?

Dude you poor thing :(

oh seriously? dam. thanks

no, just level 89, trying to get 99
---
Ppl in my group keep saying farming contracts got nerfed. Is this in an update I missed or is it speculative? I looked at the newest update and no mention.
---
# Are you fucking kidding me
---
underrated series. tbh was getting tired of gimmick ironmemes but this is super interesting
---
Are you both literally twelve?
---
Prims has attack bonuses that Tassets does not, which is why it's more than marginally better and is the obvious choice. In osrs's endgame, a few points is the reason for some items costing tens of millions more than others.
---
what? ornament kits are completely different tent degrades ornament kits just are cosmetics that you can take on/off
---
Got this step earlier haha. Was weird. 3 steps in a row all on karamja.
---
Kys
---
A fast, guaranteed 10 damage hit is significant combat XP for some accounts.
---
i didn know i could actually rolled nothing. thanks for the info
---
First things first, I am currently enjoying all aspects of this game. I have buddies who have reintroduced me to pking, since I haven't done it in probably 10 years. I've been having a blast, even if I die. However, you saying pvp is mostly dead kinda confuses me. If you don't need anything to change to bring people into the wilderness, then why is it dying? Something needs to change if the wilderness is dying like you say it is.
---
Also, PvM has been like that for the entire game. You die, you go pick your shit back up, that's it. It has never been risky. Unless you count shorter grave timers as risky, which I think I remember used to be the case in the original game, but it's been a long time. Raids require basically almost max stats and at the bare minimum, a 50m setup which won't get you too far. They also take 30 min - 1 hr to complete and can be quite challenging to master. 
---
Would you suggest they make it so you lose all your shit when you die pvming? Cause that's a great way to kill the game.
---
Looks like you’re doing it the old fashioned way.
---
Woah you did 1 beginner clue and didn't make bank I would submit a bug report for that
---
Holy fk there’s a lot of us...
---
Then I guess it depends on if you’d rather mine your essence or not, it’s all preference.
---
its not that big. it does make you sometimes run out of run energy though lol
---
Dude...I live in north mobile
---
That’s pretty dope. You should post a picture of all the loot when you open them
---
Cya in lumby kiddo
---
You averaged to get a brimstone key every 13.5k xp if you got 91 of them going from 98-99. That's a crazy amount of keys to get, what tasks did you do? I'm hunting for the hydra pet, so I'm averaging a lot more xp per key I get.
---
Grats on getting 99 slayer, and the sick cape that comes with it too!
---
It’s not a game changer but it’s definitely a small boost.
---
Dude, no 3a ring from beginner clues? Smh $11 poll results ice barrage authenticator delay you won't believe what happens next
---
you’re a life saver! just finished my clue. that really put my med clue grind to a halt for a little bit. much appreciation 🙏
---
POCKET SAND
---
“More than marginally better” 
---
This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. It’s barely better, not exponentially.
---
Put it for 1.5b abd lower it every hour
---
No.
---
Weak
---
Never would I ever guess my local university to pop up in this subreddit, especially in meme form lol.
---
A while ago, some jmod who was editing the map messed up and placed a Tbow spawn right next to the farming guild. I'm guessing this stream was before that happened, so that's why it's funny. Some guy talking random shit on twitch ended up being kinda vaguely right.
---
Because for bank fillers you need to remove all the placeholders for the items you want to fill.
---
Ahh the double click, I've done that before. He reacted way better than I did.
---
&gt;I didn't click any phishy links
---
phishy links look like legit recovery pages/official osrs forums nowadays.
---
You can roll a double nothing too, just wait till that happens.
---
Got mine not too long ago, it's a great feeling! I'm working on fire cape now but Jad has stomped me on my two only attempts. What's your next goal?
---
#W E A P O N I Z E D  A U T I S M
---
Thank you for such an in-depth response. Glad to know I wouldn't be incorrect not using them but those subtleties really make language and writing more interesting so I appreciate you taking the time.
---
Well it was because he's an UIM.
---
It's always weird when I meet people on reddit that are close to where I live lol
---
What type of shows do you like?
---
I've recently been afking to The Americans on Prime. I'd recommend that if you like dramas.
---
For an oddball comedy you might not have heard of, maybe Dreamcorp LLC. Seems like this show would not appeal to the majority of people, though, so ymmv. My sell is it's got uncle Rico from napolean dynamite and Nate from the office, and it's both of their best roles. Definitely a "surreal humor" type show.
---
I already have 99 magic, but I’m like 500k xp from 99 str too, so I think I’ll go for that next

I wouldn't recommend the risk, because it's so easy to just switch glories every 4/6 trips when filling your pouches, but if you wanted to go that route, you will want to wear Fally shield so that you can restore prayer and prot item before you die
---
They made my rune defender t even tho I got downvoted to oblivion 🤗
---
Ardy cape is also very good for farm runs and a close(ish) tele to a fairy ring
---
📸
---
Get a 99, do a raid, complete a fire cape run
---
You could also put in a ge offer of 1 coin for like a million blowpipes or something, but will permanently take up a slot
---
uh, varrock medium diary you knave
---
good boy, not taking hand outs. Keep at it, and when you become a member, make sure to keep sustaining your membership while you're still a member, as the money making methods are so much more extensive
---
F
---
Link?
---
I can tell you there's a bit or a drout at those levels for things that are actually worth it.
---
I posted basically the same thing you did with 99 attack and str, 88 range and 76 mage, and everyone just said "get 10 more levels in magic and do zulrah" to my dismay.
---
Barrows with hard diary is good. Two other things you might want to consider is completing monkey madness 2 for demonic gorillas, or maybe trying out Dagonoth Kings. I don't know how true it is, but I've heard that for strictly money making, GWD isn't the best and is mainly for 4fun group killing.
---
What helms do you have access too?
---
Meet you at your respawn point, friend.
---
I’d have him do One Week by Barenaked Ladies. That shits almost impossible to sing along with
---
That failed the poll
---
Call up Jagex right now and have them give me a 1 week demo as a developer. I'd work for free at this rate just to have the opportunity to work in a professional environment to learn and enjoy my time. Genuinely. Do it. See if I'm wrong? It's the only way we'd know whether I'm an actual technical genius or just full of shit. 
---
*kappa*
---
Haven’t gotten around to any of the city achievement stuff yet. Too lazy and having fun doing quests and skill stuff. I’ll get there!
---
Only ones that come close are 9rain and By Release
---
I honestly don’t know. I went 20 fishing trawlers with no pieces and made this out of frustration. Sorry for the shitpost mate.
---
You're the only person with a safe rs account
---
You're walking in the swamp
---
There's no one around and your phone is dead
---
Out of the corner of your eye you spot him:
---
Swampletics.
---
He's following you, about 30 feet back
---
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint
---
He's gaining on you
---
Swampetics
---
You're looking for your teletabs but you're all turned around
---
He's almost upon you now
---
and you can see there's blood on his face
---
My God, there's blood everywhere!
---
Running for you life (from Swampletics)
---
He's brandishing a knife (It's Swampetics)
---
Lurking in the shadows
---
Morytania superstar Swampetics
---
Living in the (haunted) woods (Swampetics)
---
Killing for sport (Swampetics)
---
Eating all the bodies
---
Actual UIM Swampetics
---
Now it's dark and you seem to have lost him
---
but you're hopelessly lost yourself
---
Stranded with a murderer
---
you creep silently through the underbrush
---
Aha! In the distance
---
A small cottage with a light on
---
Hope! You move stealthily toward it
---
but your leg! Ah! It's caught in a lizard trap!
---
Gnawing off your leg (Quiet, quiet)
---
Limping to the cottage (Quiet, quiet)
---
Now you're on the doorstep
---
Sitting inside: Swampetics
---
Sharpening his rune sword (Swampetics)
---
But he doesn't hear you enter (Swampetics)
---
You're sneaking up behind him
---
Strangling ironman Swampetics
---
Fighting for your life with Swampetics
---
Wrestling a knife from Swampletics
---
Stab him in his kidney
---
Safe at last from Swampletics
---
You limp into the barrows
---
blood oozing from your stump leg
---
But you have won; you have beaten
---
Swampletics
---
Wait! He isn't dead (Swampy surprise!)
---
There's a yew longbow to your head and death in his eyes
---
But you can do Jiu Jitsu
---
Body slam superstar Swampetics
---
Legendary fight with Swampetics
---
Normal Tuesday night for Swampetics
---
You try to swing an axe at Shia Labeouf
---
But blood is draining fast from your stump leg
---
He's dodging every swipe, he parries to the left
---
You counter to the right, you catch him in the neck
---
You're chopping his head now
---
You have just decapitated Swampetics!
---
His head Topples to the floor, expressionless
---
You fall to your knees and catch your breath
---
You're finally safe from Region-locked Ironmen...
---
I didn't downvote him. But then I downvoted him on his other comment because he used the buzzword sheeple.
---
I guarantee half the people who upvoted this live in mom's basement.
---
The final vampire quest needs to involve doing theatre of blood with swampletics as a buddy
---
There should be absolutely no incentive to vote aside from the content that comes from said poll. That's how you get people from blindly voting yes/no just to unlock a pet/cape/cosmetic/whatever.
---
That sounds like your disagree?
---
REEpost
---
That guy did not sound like he was enjoying that series one bit, so I sadly doubt it
---
Try reading what they said and not just look at the crabs.
---
I did 50-99 with 37hp. I only got hit 2 from the cold and 4 from the brazier. There is a spreadsheet online that calculates the damage amount.
---
You're right, because them sponsoring a totally different and unrelated person should have any bearing on whether or not this man should make enough money to live and still put in over 100 hours of effort to make content every week. After all there's a whole 168 hours a week. Making videos plus a 40 hour work week for a REAL job leaves a solid 2 and a half hours of sleep a day. He should be grateful.
---
Nah, just passed by. Saw all the downvotes. Then read an opinion. Wasn't important. Figured I'll just leave "k." I didn't downvote because that's like totally your opinion man.
---
Couldn't he use his main to tank in the first place?
---
83 attack, 84 strength, 77 def running overloads and absorbtions
---
Running str gear and dharoks
---
Bosses are ice troll king, argg, me, king roald, count draynor, moss giant, tree spirit
---
reporting in, didn't expect this as the first comment i read
---
He RWTed, only had his main banned bc youtuber, and at least owned up to it and didn't deny the shitty things he did, he still makes good content though.
---
This guy sold it for 250m so what's the problem with saying NO it will not be 2b.
---
Hell yeah. Was hoping someone would do this.
---
Please let me release this now!!!
---
Why not show warnings about fake streams?
---
Ah yeah I see the loot screenie shows the runelite plugin now, I had assumed it would've just shown the items in a price checker etc, my bad
---
A
---
You can also fletch right after clicking to relight the brazier, I'm like you and only fletched when running and relighting and made 500 each time easy
---
Respectable, have a nice day.
---
The Grove, home.
---
Tormented bracelet ornament kit! Good luck on the return
---
Wait, you don't pick out your rs outfit at the beginning of each day?
---
The ring of stone was released in 2005 which was 14 years ago
---
My entire account is a goof hahaha
---
For your people who acclimate here already, were just preparing a base for testing
---
How you get that old icon interface for the tabs?
---
Ty
---
People like new, they hate change
---
Yeah no shit it also turns you into a stone note 3rd age items I assumed jagex would make a rare 3rd age item simi useful but na this is memescape only left this up so lonely nerds can comment acting like they are superior
---
Along with what Sarc said, if you do go the STASH route, I recommend keeping a notepad or something to track which ones you make. Theres 103 in total, which could get difficult to remember.
---
all the other 3rd age items are just as useful. All of them are just for showing off, which is the same thing this is.
---
D
---
Wah
---
yeah I can totally see how someone could. he doesn’t seem like a dick or anything at all, I’m sure he’s a good dude
---
Do Morytania hard diary, save prayer doses where you can
---
There is no reason to have BCP unless you have literally every other item first. Thats even full ancestral, full arma, tbow/scythe(you can get BCP while you save up though), and all other possible items you could want
---
Brine Sabre
---
Champion cape , 10 drops of 1/5k one of the rarest capes in game :D
---
&gt; much pieces
---
why repost something that's currently top 5 on hot?
---
If you have 60 rc and magic Just buy that crystal and combine them into pegasian
---
Yup.  It's a Runelite feature.  One of the side buttons.
---
Whips are from regular demons
---
R.I.P.
---
Just do one agility level in between of every slayer task. I've done like 20 agility levels (50-70) and didn't have a hard time at all.
---
Agreed
---
Rochester?
---
Because the update was about 3-4 hours prior to this which was prime time for Aussies but not really so much for Americans and english. What’s my presumption anyway
---
The "Ok" is the funniest thing I have seen all day holy shit
---
people used to cyber in the upstairs of the blue moon inn in like 2002, it was common as fuck
---
I would go with bursting dust devils. You should break even at least and it’s solid xp
---
What about granite weapons?
---
Another Rochester person here
---
Even the way he talks has completely changed in the last few episodes. It's wild.
---
Clue scrolls are supposed to be something you do in the middle of a slayer task, or skilling, or w/e boss you're killing. If you allow them to be stackable there would be no point to immediately drop what you're doing and do the clue. You would end up stacking a bunch in your bank and then running around Gielinor for over an hour doing clues.
---
Wrong thread. This is questions about the game, not for jagex. Also sub rule says no ban appeals
---
Ah ok, then you must have done something for your data to get leaked in that time.
---
Bye ;(
---
There was a chain of Ironman memes on my school's subreddit. I don't know whether to be proud or ashamed.
---
Then you should have hp to buy the other items as well. Nobody is saying BCP is a noob purchase if you have the other items
---
People use the Granite Hammer for training as well, the Maul is a spec weapon for PvP, rest is not useful.
---
Thank you sneaker, very cool.
---
No he didnt, that was UIPanda. Anyssa lost like 5mil lmao.
---
Bajs spotted
---
Using the Falador shield to recharge my prayer would be very smart, thanks! Although you’re right, using regular glory’s isn’t too hard and gives me peace of mind.
---
You’re replying to yourself, not the people who answered your question
---
Just a side note, since your range is 99, you can get crazy defence xp rates by chinning on the monsters in the mm/mm2 caves
---
Well i bhought one for 210m, so those 1b+ people can take their 1b and show it up a place i wont name.
---
You made me think of something, maybe we can get a sign that says vote nay or vote yea. And can only wear it if we've voted in the latest poll. Would be useful in clans too.
---
Yep theres a dude in my old clan who was finnish and learned english pretty much exclusively through runescape. He became near fluent after years of playing lol.
---
Have you considered adding the RuneScape orchestral music tracks there aswell?
---
I'M Dirty Dan!
---
Well this is disappointing. Although if everyone is in the same boat I guess...
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks! This is a dark day for my 50 days of playing time :'(
---
Why is the gilded spade inventory icon upside down compared to a regular spade?
---
For points just put as many bosses you can except the ones with cancer mechanics, ThirdAgeFilm has a good video for it but it's kinda outdated, so just add Corrupt Lizardman to the list of bosses that you DON'T take.
---
I use a inventory setup for vorkath, with fremmenik boots and rune pouch in the right lower corner, if I want to keep the boots there I need to delete the placeholder and fill it, or bank every different item:)
---
Why does this thing exist? Like seriously, what happened evolutionarily speaking to produce a creature like THIS! It’s so comical looking!

Oh, you must be right since im being downvoted to hell.

I’m just wondering because I’m sitting at 20/25 items at 365 runs. Which I think I might be done with it by 600 runs if my rng is generous.

Good job you completely missed the point. Literally no one gets chainbanned for rwting. The only similar case is when A Friend got banned for taking a fucking gambling site sponsorship.

Challenge you to get up to 45 thieving through stalls. Doing mainly cakes. Going straight into solo wintetodts for 99 fm. Also you will come out with low 70ish construction. And then i challenge you to go for 99 thieving. Then quest cape. And that will be how i too have suffered. Ign: lonelift

It's honestly great.  But IMO the problem with the player isnt the music style, its the constant switching.
---
It wasn't the bank PIN or the train wifi - I've had a look at your account (comment history) and it seems the password was compromised as early as November '18 (there were some website logins dating from back then), and it's still the same creation password.
---
Since that time they've been unable to login to your account in-game because the Authenticator was active, but once it was disabled toward the end of last month, the path was cleared for them.
---
Definitely do change your password ASAP, and re-enable the Authenticator.
---
Same people voted no to this
---
Yes but the higher level clue, the more slots you have to roll scrolls.  An easy only rolls 2-4 items so it has a much lower chance than an elite which rolls 4-6

Gotta love those two. The series 9Rain's been doing with Avrah and Futa is highly entertaining. I also enjoy Verf, Wildernaut, Wildy Mom, Tiranwnn Only, and Potato Only HCIM quite a bit. Of the ones I named, they're all unique from one another. But I definitely have come across some Swampletics and Verf copy-cats as well

Either wizard tower or south of Port Sarim

Just go to the wiki
---
If you're bitching about the WC guild making the 99 too easy you better NEVER buy your shit from the GE than. You gotta catch all those fish yourself to cook, smith your own dart tips for fletching, kill all your dragons for their bones to train prayer. No buying things to make things easier and more efficient. Because according to you that's bad.
---
Yes. So how will this ever be useful? Things that are actually useful is those such as medicine and chemistry. Not astrophysics.

What fuck you counted them?

If it's like third age and the odds are 1/42k or whatever, that would significantly decrease its effect on average clue scroll value.
---
but lets just ignore the fact that people are stealing shit without repercussion. i think jagex is okay with it. otherwise they would give us the ip of the last login,(which is not without its faults) none the less they took the option of us taking matters into our own hands away from us when they hide the ips. just so u are aware jagex gets thousandsds of false recovery attempts a day. and to the day noone has ever been banned against it.(except mod jed) i think

You're fucking stupid, seriously. Kids working McDonald's jobs don't donate that much money to streamers. B0aty, and many many other steamers, have donators in the tens of thousands of dollars. People who spend that much money on streamers are adults with a lot of disposable income.
---
Also if a 18kid working at Mcdonalds wastes his entire weeks paycheck for something stupid like this, they deserve it. It'll teach them pretty early in their life not to be a dumbass with money.

Yeah, he's legit gone into this (almost) completely blind. Rewatches his deaths and learns from the mechanics. On his second time getting to jad (where the first time he got one shot by jad off screen), he got his attacks down and was praying against them, and then figured out the guys that spawned were healers and how to deal with them. Was really tragic seeing his final death to jad, he had all healers dead and just fucked up a normal prayer which he was able to do.

I was thinking if not wizard tower maybe mudskipper point.... which is south of Port Sarim

How is this relevant to OSRS and why should Jagex respond?
---
Was my first clue and instantly saw it
---
Inb4 they force change your name into something stupid and lock it for a year.

Even though he lost the bet, his next attempt whenever that is, is in the bag.

Assuming he doesn’t have that much stress considering the loss of $4500 will no longer be looming over his shoulder.

This happens sometimes, just a little bug.
---
Pretty sure you can report the prices and they'll correct them in cases of inflated GE price, so they probably would for this too
---
Eh I like Jakey, I don't think he makes bad videos. He just caters to a younger audience with his editing style of super fast cuts. 
---
But yea you're right, he does the thing with the exagerated reactions on entirely normal RNG.
---
Put the date on the screens.
---
"now what"
---
&gt; No idea why people were against it.
---
Because it would destroy impling farming in Puro Puro, which is solid money for people who enjoy it and newer players (also unfortunately bots and gold farmers).
---
You know what'd help? Not constantly reading about how bad of a job you're doing. Frustration doesn't improve performance.

keep doing slayer, pretty slow but it will improve you hp/def/ranged/magic + profit(better gear) for future zulrah farm

No it's not. It's not really possible for drop rates to randomly change (I mean, it is theoretically possible, but *far* more unlikely than going dry for 500 or even 1000 kills) and there's no reason for Jagex to change the drop rates of a random low level monster.
---
I don't understand why some people think it's a bug when they are unlucky. If you went 1000 kills dry (~ 1/7,000,000 chance) you might have a point, but right now there's no reason to believe that there's a bug.
---
Left alone
---
I think if you’ve noticed some other youtubers started before Settled.  Lost in 2005 and UIM Verf are just a few examples that I watch.  So I wouldn’t say “copying” but bouncing off others ideas seems like a better way to describe it.
---
Report it as a bug ingame.
---
someone said they went 1200kc without a clue. im not going to keep going.. something is wrong.. why all of a sudden after update people have started to complain
---
but if he has a main why didnt he just open 2 clients and do it himself, or is 1 person not enough.
---
Pures still have to train, the number of people I have seen in full ranger gear just to cannon is pretty high, especially since pure training is slower than normal, anything that speeds that up is worth it. I still agree with your price range though, bought mine at 13 mil and although it might drop a bit with the increase of people doing clue scrolls during this initial rush, I think it was worth it.
---
They’re not bots
---
Hahahaha imagine complaining about this
---
Reminds me of Scottish cod players
---
Yeah
---
Jagex listens.... ... eventually
---
Yeah. Out of my last 10 tasks, 5 have been black demons.
---
Yep, so the first time is just to 'unlock' the ability to fight mimics. 
---
When you actually receive a Mimic in the future you will be prompted to go to Watson's house again, where you use it on the chest, fight the Mimic, leave and THEN open the Mimic casket for a clue reward + the extra Mimic reward. 
---
You didn't lose anything, its just a confusing process.
---
&gt;  I saw in some beginners guide to do quests. But can i also just chop wood and fish all day to progress?
---
Quests will give you more access to more content, as well as a story-telling aspect of the world. If you want to just chop wood and fish, then go for it.
---
&gt; what do i do with all the wood, my backpack is full.
---
Put it in your bank
---
Woah, well done. Should've posted a screenshot (...) of his GE history.

I chopped 37k oaks for my first bond, F2P money making is rough.

Prims before Tassets. You can use Prims with pray gear and other setups, and the strength increase is the same

To add to the other comment, Wildblood seeds only use 5 per run (albeit it's still more expensive than the other seeds).

Stick with a simple hop seed (e.g. Barley) and just use them.

Ahh I see, yeah it was very confusing and a little frustrating but ill get my chance again. thanks for clearing that up for me mate
---
D2 LOD got my WPM up dramatically. Trading in that game was great
---
Is that way past the reasonable level? Most people I know attempt fire cape at 75 range so they can use a blowpipe, I don't think being 80 defense at 75 range is really that unreasonable.
---
I really don’t get using sound. Shits so overwhelming. Especially for jad. Stomp, range. Hover, mage. It’s not hard.
---
I tried logging in to the RS3 website as well with no avail :/
---
Either way I thought that having a runescape account lets you use it in both RS3 and Old School at the same time? They ofcourse will be separate in-game, but with the same log in, no?
---
Rapey, I like it
---
Yep, was annoying for me too :P
---
It has its reasons though why its complicated, at least we have Watson teleports now right to him!
---
I was wondering when this was going to happen.
---
After a certain point his entire video will become nothing but doing the same exact thing for two weeks. Sounds boring.
---
Works for both and Slayer helm becomes bis on and off task as it gives superior stats compared to shayzien helm.
---
Yeah it was lol. Before bots were really a rampant thing in the game the economy was great. Loved playing it back then when it was really a great game.
---
Exploration and exploitation. The content itself is really interesting but the presentation is lacking. Doesn’t seem to flow like swampletics. Still recommend watching him!
---
yeh but i dont like them, i find them annoying, but ive moved to them now as cant do thugs.

Only brainlets call it a skimmy

Not really understanding what your asking now?

---
Patreon is the last thing he needs, he's just "abusing" his burst of success...
---
I disagree and tbh I don't understand why anyone wouldn't use sound. The mage sound clearly comes before its visual animation. IMO you should hear the mage sound and see the range stomp. Just use the fastest queue for each
---
How about you max instead?
---
Man if this doesn’t get 10 million upvotes I’ll be very upset.

Crazy story! Reminds me of a story of my own.. back in 2010 me and some dutch fellow used to pk all day everyday together. Then 6 years later he is in my college class but we didn’t know who the other dude was. The one day were drinking beer together and somehow RuneScape comes up. He was like yeah i used to play alot my username was X and i was like wtfff dude im Y. 
---
Crazy how small the world can be!
---
Probably Settled.
---
Get Dream Mentor and Desert Treasure done ASAP if you haven't already. Then looks up a good guide for AFK points and AFK for a few hours and be done.

osrs is literally my go to game once im tilted in OW lol
---
You're taking them far too seriously my dude, they're just two 18 year olds picking on a 15 year old. Nothing is gonna happen, don't worry. 
---
In the future don't purposefully evade the censor though.
---
I would like to think you would get a refund because they are tracking the item and where it landed last. Then the item that was stolen/hacked returned to the person it was originally on. But this is me trying to think positively about how it would be handled.
---
I had this a few years ago, but I had 3 and it was verc, I was actually about to crap my self.
---
It was made by leaving the room after one spawns and then going back in the room and another one spawning
---

did I miss an update that made another dart outclass dragon? I was doing slayer so I thought it would be the best exp possible. if im wrong let me know =)
---
Doh, sorry I didn't read it properly, apologies.

Yeah cause ironman have that much bankspace to spare
---
I just did that one this morning
---
You’re fine
---
&gt; A stupid question, but your on par with it.
---
Oh boy
---
Haha, not a new clue scroll btw 😇
---
Nice try
---
Cos like i just said, to me it’s overwhelming. I find with visual cues you still have enough time to flick.
---
Ladies and gentlemen. One of the worlds best wow players

I also love the PVP challenges he does with LinksOcirana
---
How dare you, of all people have fun in a video game.
---
If your not min/maxing how can you get the most xp out of your time. 
---
People like you are killing this game, by dare i say it, enjoying the content at your own pace.
---
Runescape is a hard core game where min/maxing xp is all that matters.
---
/s
---
It’s seems there is a bug... got none at thugs aswell
---
And so many people only care about what others think about how they play a video game
---
&gt;Do i put the wood in the bank and sell them later?

Yep

Bottom of feet facing ground mage. Bottom of feet facing forward range. Easiest way imo. Sound is too overwhelming like you said.
---
nothing personnel, KID 🤓🤓
---
I don't know! It's the first clue scroll I ever did, pretty nice though! Regardless of the rewards it just turns your endless training a bit more fun when one drops

I'm not talking about you, there was another person who responded to this thread who put words in my mouth and tagged Zuhaar. But yeah, it's pretty weird.
---
Can't agree with you more! Do you use RuneLite? Or do you want to figure it out yourself? Should be do-able, since I don't think beginner clues have puzzle boxes. :)
---
Oh awesome, yeah I must've stopped after getting past 12. How long does 75 slayer take roughly? &amp; do you use them for anything else or just train until they can sit at gargs
---
We get the hard questions so swampletics can get the easy ones
---
Yeah, but I'd like to get back to the fork in the path so I can go there, and not have to TP out and run all the way back because I can't pass through the saw again.
---

How much can you sell them for? Thanks for all the info so far
---
Can confirm also have a dry sense of humor.
---
Great idea!  IMO PvP tournaments should have all competitors start with an even playing field (or as even as possible), giving players predetermined gear set ups is a great way to do that, with the rewards for killing others being a currency with which you can buy further upgrades from a store. I was thinking along very similar lines a few days ago, after Jagex announced a DMM rework and you have presented this in a clear and concise way, good stuff mate.
---
Side note; I don't even PvP in RS but would love to see this whole esports/ competitive scene work out.
---

Did you know that people make 10min youtube videos because then you can put midroll ad on your videos and make more money? Key part is that creator has to put it by him/herself. And if you watched the video you would know that there is no midroll ad.

So he did not gain anything by making video 10min so we can assume it was a accident. He even replied to one youtube comment about this and said it was not intended to be 10min.

He means that some people just see it as a item in a game and they do not put any real life value to it. This isn't a complex thought here.

He is not arguing the value of the item in $$ but just some people do not care that the item could be sold for real money because they do not care about RWT.

I’ll probably never have an achievement cape, but if you grind them all out, might as well have unlimited teleports. Crafting cape, fishing cape, construction cape and strength cape all have unlimited teleports, why not the achievement? I also wonder why some skill cape perks are op, while other are shit lol.

If true, Niiiice!

There's been multiple written on it.

Get up your stats and use the 7 day free trial membership to earn your bond as a member. It’ll be a lot faster and will probably provide you with better xp. Or do a shitload of beginner scrolls today, you might be able to get a unique and sell it for a lot since they’re really new

I don't think you could find good graphic designers that would want to do every new graphic in runescape hd style basically for free and with every osrs update that adds any new graphics you would have to wait even more time to use hd client. In reality the only possible solution to adding hd graphics woud require jagex to hire more people and making it toggable, but in the end it wouldn't be optimal to make every update twice as much work than needed, so jagex would probably have to push hd, scrap old graphics and we would be left with OSRS2.
---
Considering how much work it takes to finish all diaries, I'm quite sure unlimited teleports is fine.
---
Wtf, I got 48 from 98 to 99 slayer that's absolutely nuts the droprate you hit

Well there's a Skyrim screenshot in the post so you're *probably* right
---
When did somebody get banned for doing the first one?
---
Could probably chop a camel right in the hump and drink all its milk with one of those
---
same tbh
---
haha alright Mr. 4Head. RIP your account. No one can help you here. You racked up charges, AND you put your email username in this public post... Even if its a 'joke' email, thats a bad choice already. Plus if someone remote controlled your CPU, then you have so many more serious issues then your damn gmail pure.
---
Fucking HNMR.
---
lmfao you are kidding right?
---
&gt;Auth delay is because of Google
---
Never have I seen such a blatant lie.
---
I like the crystal quiver idea, to be honest... Make the bow get a 50% chance to fire an arrow without using a charge and give a +30 (or something similar) ranged strength bonus. Suddenly, crystal bow is good again!
---
&gt;  I did not have a pin on this account due to needing to hop frequently to buy items at shops 
---
Brah do u know how bank pin works ? Sounds a bit odd that u have 100m+ bank, multiple accounts and don't even know that.
---
Go to South?
---
It does not.
---
Oh lol, whoops. Almost done with the f2p quests (started Shield of Arrov and Dragon Slayer and those are the last two) so I might jump into the trial membership and go from there!
---
Maybe for super-rares, sure. But, I wouldn't really care for a bucket owned by *29dy59wlo41* for 51 seconds.
---
Do you ever want it to be safe again? Do you think no-one could try to doxx you starting at your Reddit account?
---
He’s holding Sid mate
---
&gt;I personally found...
---
I said right at the beginning that it's my opinion. I'm just offering advice.
---
You can get off your high horse.
---
Those water runes, idk why I like this
---
Imagine having trouble with a boss that you can flinch
---
Wait there’s a HD feature? Tell me more.
---
"Yeah but what if we take all these features we current have.... and gate them significantly!"
---
&gt;so many people level up this new shit skill
---
"Wow look how many people love this skill!"
---
&gt;Everyone tries to get all fancy and turn on sound despite it being redundant
---
Honestly not that rare. Anybody without a job/ prospects in life can achieve this. 
---
Congrats though!
---
It happened to me, i just logged out and back in. He popped up after that
---
I think this is your best one yet. Do you have a site where you keep all these?
---
I hacked the jaxed mainframe and found the ip address. It's 127.0.0.1
---
Having it on ranged by default is recommended, as you have to react much more quickly to the ranged than the mage attack.
---
And it’s already hard to find an open world for eclectics because everyone farms them for rangers (normals and irons alike). Stacking clues would mean people never have to leave, thus making it even more difficult to get a spot
---
that means you are going in the right direction tho. . ..  . . .
---
I work 12 hour shifts at a hospital , it took me a while , and yes it is that rare a mod confirmed :p
---
For real just hang out on 428 at either raids bank
---
I usually just trade in friends for death runes once they're grown, is alching them more efficient?
---
Probably because you watch some weird fucking porn
---
Not yet, but as soon as I finish the f2p quests (Shield of Arrov and Dragon Slayer are the last two and currently in progress), I'll give the trial a shot!
---
what part?
---
If this doesn't make it to r/all I give up on reddit

I got almost 2,000 coins worth of things.

You underestimate the ability of this community to invest a ton of time in to efforts that are ultimately worthless. That's kind of what this game is all about.
---
you’ve got the job
---
?
---
The sound is indeed redundant. There's two cues that tell you the same thing. That it the definition of redundant.
---
Again, this is my personal opinion, I'm just offering advice. I said right at the beginning that it was my personal opinion, yet 2 comments in you're still choosing to ignore that.
---
You're just trying to pick a fight when there isn't one. Are you having a rough morning or something? I can't imagine what must be going on for you to get angry at someone offering advice and try to make an argument about it. 
---
It's pitiful.
---
I loled at gmail pure, thank you.
---
How do you know? You don't know how many wealthy people you see that don't show it.
---
&gt;Auth delay won't happen because of limitations at Google's side of the authenticator. 
---
There's no "Google's side". The authenticator is based on an open standard. Google Authenticator is just one of many apps that you can use.
---
I confirmed it on a members world too
---

---
They spawn on the ground underwater. You could literally just sit there and alch for a couple minutes and have enough to start the grind. Then when harvesting the seaweed you will often see more spores spawn. Generally you can self sustain without actually needing to kill lobs or anything else.
---
Got full guthan's in under 50kc but I only have 60def rip
---
When you need to swap the authenticator to a new device, because you got a new phone or lost your current one, the only way to do so is by first removing the existing authenticator, and enabling it again on your new device. 
---
Add a delay into the equation and you create situations where people can't log into the game for X amount of days because of this. This is a big no-go caused by the limitations of the Google authenticator. 
---
So how is this a lie?
---
in what world is that a guessable email? lmao
---
Except raiding in WoW you wipe on a boss till you have it down. Pretty sure method took over 300 pulls on Jaina and 100 on Mekka. People fuck up and most fights are over in under 7 minutes with wipes being called after x amount of fuckups and you learn from it, rather than spending an hour and a half to get to that point.  2 fights this tier were longer than 8 minutes week 1, with only the end one lasting longer than 8 now due to gear levels.
---
I can confirm as I did this myself, Portal Nexus works for the diary req
---
think that turtle went back in when he realised
---
You need to either get help, or a life...
---
don't use it unless you absolutely *cannot stand* standard OSRS visuals
---
personally I just use runelite's GPU plugin and bump up the draw distance. the thing that OSB has can cause problems with the game, and I personally feel it is not worth the risk
---
I have to get 85 fm from 80 for a master clue with a +5 boost, get 77 rc from 75 for frem and zeah elite with +5 boost for frem, and study for an exam on Sunday.
---
Super good item for killing kbd, I love it.
---
You say they would need to hire a team for the client. Heres an idea.. jyst hire the guys at runelite. Boom job done.

As someone who doesn't do clues too often what does he mean by mediums form masters? Does a master clue include tables from all clues?

Can I ask why this is a meme it actually helps me study

Craws bow, do I need avas for this? how does this work? do I need ammo? I charge it, right?

how tf does it work?

They implied it will be fixed next week.

Which artery is most likely to be occluded?

Cool, sounds like you've got a good setup, I only have one account atm and want to do something like you but on a smaller scale.

I'd hope you wouldn't get banned if you were able to turn 30 accounts into a death dot bomb, that would be cool to see!

Efficiency scape is a bitch mdude
---
Sure, let's make all the previous requests to hide the polls seem illegitimate by requesting the exact opposite thing and making it look like it was always just a trolling attempt at Jagex. Asshole.
---
Lmao either you're highly mentally unstable or you're fucking with me in some way but I posted what it shows me, post what it shows you then. I done checked your profile and see you're not all that weird and you have some decent art. But this particular shit here we're commenting on. This is shit and I almost wonder if you're original comment was trolling the artist lol
---
If I get a West Ardy clue step, I always risk the lever with like 50m worth of teleport scrolls. I should really buy West Ardy tele tabs, but I keep forgetting or am too lazy.

Eh this one is better executed

If anyone’s on the spectrum it’s you bud

You started at 85? I would've figured you wouldve gotten more than 10 levels

Exactly..

Can anyone explain the pineapple meme? Out of the loop here :(
---
Jeez what's ur life like irl
---
I kill every imp I see wandering around edgeville and other random places. Always hoping for a scroll lol
---
Damn, HD was so beautiful...
---
Probably 10-15 tries here. Dont really remember but now I have over 650 kills.
---
One is removing a req to an inexpensive item. The other is adding two new items that will hold high value
---
RuneLite does not show the solution to this coordinate clue yet, so any help on this would be greatly appreciated.
---
Imagen.. doesnt know how he got hacked. But yet he post his email on reddit.
---
The reason they are harder atm is because there is no Wiki guide on these.
---
They decided that reducing bias in the polls is a good thing.
---
To be honest, I wouldn’t want RuneLite to get Jagexed. I think having some 3rd party competition in their own product forces Jagex to implement features that some clients offer to those who only use the official client.
---
That being said, the RuneLite devs probably know more about their obsfucated client than most OSRS devs. I mean, they hired Matt from OSB and got a load of tools, not detection systems, and client features such as their heat map in DMM, etc. And that turned out well. Wouldn’t hurt for Jagex to consider hiring more people like this full time on a salary worth living in Cambridge for. I’ve almost applied to work there myself purely for the love I have for this game. If only the pay matched the living cost.
---
I didn't know the girl that wrote &lt;0.2% of the black hole code played OSRS.
---
Wtf why?!
---
Everyone I know as an adult pecks keys. Meanwhile I fluently type 100+ wpm without looking at the keys and coworkers and friends are like, "where did you learn to type like that??". I'm just like, "uuhhhhh.... I'm just really into computers..."
---
You’re missing the point entirely. I mythic raided too, you don’t have to tell me how the game works.  
---
People fuck simple things up and you learn from mistakes. On top of that, most bosses have multiple phases you prog through. You don’t just blast through p1 and one shot it the same pull. Meaning you learn. Fight caves is basically p1 and p2.  
---
And that’s stupid there’s a GCD of 1.6 seconds and there is timers + healing externals you PLAN as you progress.
---
It makes sense for stronger rewards to be locked behind difficult content or long grinds. But that does not mean all difficult content and long grinds deserve strong rewards. For example, the Champion's Cape takes a while to get, but it shouldn't be a BiS Cape solely because it is hard to obtain. That is the logic you are using; it takes work to finish all diaries, therefore, it should be OP. But that is designing it backwards.
---
We shouldn't throw strong rewards on things just because they are hard; we should design hard content around the rewards. And on top of that, the rewards should be relevant to the content. Diaries already give a bunch of rewards and perks on their own; the cape is just a small added benefit. You shouldn't expect the cape to be THE reward for doing diaries because they already have strong perks. And turning the Diary Cape into a must-have Abyss RC buff or another banking cape doesn't really line up with the content.
---
Either way, "It takes time so it should be OP" logic is harmful to the game. If you say "well Completionist takes a lot of time, therefore it should give BiS perks", you fail to reward Completionists and instead force anyone who wants BiS perks to do content they don't want to do, which leads to a whole slippery slope of problems. Saying that the Diary Cape should be op because Diaries take time repeats the same problem of overloaded rewards for no reason. The Diary Cape could do with more than 10 Teleports total, but giving it unlimited is too strong for what the Cape is and what Diaries already give and it doesn't matter if it takes time or effort; those factors don't ignore balancing.
---
Imagine not getting 6 hour logged 3 times a day
---
Craws bow doesn't require ammo other than the ether needed to charge it. It always uses 1 ether per shot. There's no need/benefit for an ava's device other than stats, because there is no ammo for the device to retrieve.
---
the fact that 20-30 of these topics are made each week and only like 5% end up being reserved (if that) just shows that people fuck up and think they can come on here and shit will change.  Either you did something yourself, or you failed to secure your account.  Under both circumstances it's your own fought and lesson well learned.
---
A good looking version, yeah
---
100% agreed, someone needs to bring this up on the streams lol
---
Damn, got my hopes up for a second..
---
Happened to my halfway maxed pure, lvl 91 str 95 magic 93 range
---
Now I just focus on my main which is gonna be my piety account so I can still do bossing
---
That's a scam.

Next.

Thanks for the support as always man (and the gold) &lt;3

ill give it a go, thanks.

I went pking drunk once in max 2006 hybrid gear. Don't even think I made it from ardy lever to Mage bank before I died 😂

d

:) sounds like you're angry over nothing, sorry kid but you were unhelpful x
---
&gt; am too lazy
---
Also I have a specific set up for clues

At least vorkath is profitable even without the uniques. Grotesque Guardians is terrible.

Mystics are undead, so Salve (ei) is better than Anguish vs them

Can someone make OSRS HD pls ? Ill pay 15$ a month
---
What if RuneScape *is* your life?
---
Nice.
---
I ended with 97 but i cant be 100% as did take a few breaks but ah , alot of xp lol
---
Oops to early for that one.
---
If you follow that email you might end up in a museum of Darwinism one day
---
Right sided PCA infarct btw
---
They are able to make integrity changes, voting on a poll that was visible obviously wasn't integrity seeing how it doesn't negatively effect the game.
---
It's from the official account messaging system and I have the ban on my account status so unfortunately its real.....
---
Perhaps. But with how many locations it teleports to, there will likely always be something that slips past. Especially with updates since it would be easy to add something near one Diary Master forgetting they are there. But we could move Lesser Fanatic and Jarr to make those teleports less powerful, but then that would also be a nerf to anyone who uses them with the current limits.
---
this is beautiful
---
GE street price is 2-2.5m atm, so you'll have to up your bid
---
If someone sees this from the front page they will think the OSRS community is fucking weird.
---
Someone should just test it. It just a theory on how to dispose the minions because you'd likely run out of supplies before you reach Zuk.
---
Join “t d d fc” I’m game and tell em Daabzz sent you

I hate you
---
It isn't a dramatic enough change to keep people voting.  Look at when Obama was elected president, he had a huge turnout of first time voters and young voters voting for him, which gave him a huge boost.  Not even 12 years later and those numbers have dwindled back down to the flat levels they were before he was elected.  You will see a spike for the recent change, after that it will once again go flat again and stay there.
---
It would get lost everytime it gets stacked
---
I remember seeing everyone at castle wars with that cool ass bow when I was 9 it's a shame it's useless now
---
Yeah that is 100% false. You either clicked something or had the same info on other sites that got comprised. They clearly have all your info so they either got it from you or another website you used the same info for. 
---
Just pointing this out so when you either recover or make a new account in the future you understand it isnt random it is because you dont have good personal security
---
You mean shaking sweaty hands and talking to each other with dick cheese breath doesn't sound appealing to you???
---
Some of them do, Ranis Draken blood bomb can damage himself if you stand next to him. It also damages his vyre minions.
---
Yes, raids are pretty complicated so most people I meet are trash until 10-20s kc and even then you can ask your average player with 100-200 kc and they'll most likely not understand how the mechanics of the bosses (especially olm) actually work, they'll just understand the methods they were taught. So you're fine, dont worry too much about it and just keep trying.
---
Found the rs3 player. Get him bois
---
I bet you tbow/crossbow the mystics too
---
FOH with this rs3 stuff go back to your mtx.
---
Yeah as a kid I probably had no idea what I was doing!
---
We need a group high alchemy spell.
---
Well its not "unique" but settleds UIM progress videos are pretty good. The first ~10-15 vids are... not great, but it gets a lot better and you can really see how he gets better as a vid maker pre swampletics
---
I couldn't agree more
---
And what does this have to do with black holes?
---
Wait, so when Obama was elected it was because they hid election results during voting? Or just at the same time?
---
Do you think any player at all has ever clicked the poll booth and seen the results and thougth "hmm no real point in me voting"?
---
All the easter eggs in here are awesome!
---
What text did you find the first question in?
---
Can anyone tell where he is in game, seems like a cave
---
[Shhh... bro that was the joke] So anyway haha you should join the Guthix clan for extra castle war tix.

It says there are 2 comments but I can't see them?

They're bringing back chalkboards?
---
People gotta eat
---
Dunno why you're getting down voted youre completely right.
---
Probably. But each attempt takes ~1 hour. I don't want to waste another 4-6 hours attempting Jad and wasting scales/darts because I die to dumb stuff.
---
but urite i should git gud
---
This can happen to players too, pretty funny actually
---
Sector clear.
---
*Sector not clear, not clear.*
---
Hey Matt
---
Oh I see. Thought that was something else. Thanks!
---
Which ones are unlimited aside from Drakan's Medallion, fairy rings, spirit trees and the Seed Pod? Camulet costs 1m to be unlimited, Lyre needs to be recharged with fish, Tele crystal needs you to go to Eluned every once in a while, Memoirs need to be recharged, etc.
---
They all tend to pop up in premed curriculum
---
Everyone in this thread likes to pretend they understand Jagex’s finances based on subscriber count. You’re right, it does cost money and if it were in their best interest to hire more devs they would’ve done it by now.
---
Normie.... pathetic... ironman it damnit
---
Eh, that’s 30m I could put down for Pegasian boots.
---
Warum liegt hier Stroh?
---
Agreed. You really sparked such an awesome movement in the community that brings a lot of people a lot of joy. Keep it up.
---
Usual strategy is to use Mage since nearly all are weak to it so it would be better to level that up
---
Long tap where it says xp then click set up
---
I was just joking saying that ironman mode seems overly complicated. Just a joke, and a bad one apparently considering the downvotes haha
---
Really rocks
---
It's a very slight lower chance apparently. Hardly that much different than before
---
Never again.
---
Dying in an instance it does
---
What about the lump on her skirt?
---
I'd first get 50 magic and underground pass for ibans blast
---
What lvl do you suggest? Should I get to 50 for Iban's Blast?
---
Because a delay is intended to be made by whoever implements Authenticator to their services. The logic would work like this:
---
If $AuthenicatorRemoveRequested where $user = "ID" 
---
TimerTask for x seconds 
---
Print "Authenticator will be removed in 72 hours!"
---
$emailUser where $user = "ID"
---
The real solution would be to also add a form of 2fa to the website since having only authenticator on the game client is kind of a cyber security joke.
---
I'd much rather see FIDO/U2F security keys implemented as an additional option for 2FA since that security model is very solid and OTP is well know to have it's faults but is better than nothing at all. Authenticator is still a better security OTP model then a SMS OTP.
---
Does this really classify as humour?
---
Adamazmatar

This is the best comparison

I thought pvmers in the windy only dropped spades

Well, if you wanted to be efficient you'd do teaks but yeah
---
Can we please cut Jagex a fucking break for two seconds. My heart was so happy when poll results were hidden because Jagex finally answered us, in addition to having a constructive meeting about PvP. I'm so excited for the future of OSRS given the updates within the last week. Can we please THANK Jagex??
---
Someone??
---
Can anybody else out there hear me??
---
You realize you can unlock a shortcut right before Kruk? And you never have to go back to the start at any point?
---
It sounds like you grossly misunderstood or ignored every hint the quest was trying to give you.
---
No way i also live there, im by Davidson High School lul.
---
Especially bexause you can get to almost 40 farming with just quests. Speeds up the early lvls.
---
Ancestral top/bottom   imbued heart are all worth more than a bracelet.
---
Nah fuck rs3
---
I understand it's a hard balance to make between better security and convince while balancing labor constraints for an organization. I deal with it every day with my clients. There are plenty of 2FA models out there too. I'd much rather like to see a diversity so people can have the choice to which 2FA model they would prefer to use. Like a security key, or a push notification auth w/ firebase, Google Authenticator and Authy for OTP (Authenticator alternative). No one is suggesting an enforcement of 2FA and it already isn't an enforced policy. People who opt in to 2FA need to understand how each one works before opting into them, which I think Jagex could do better at informing best practices while using Authenticator during the opt in process much like a few Crypto exchanges do. 
---
I'm fully aware things like these take time and need to be fully researched by Jagex (hope someone from there comes across these and takes it as feedback) and I intend the tone of my comments here to come off as sensible and open minded. Not trying to be part of the crab rave culture, though I do find it entertaining and humorous from time to time when I see them.
---
I kind of feel bad for them. They can never win.
---
might as well give the thieving/agil a try, or the fish/hunter if you have some jute, doesn't take long to randomly run across a few dozen spores along the way
---
It’s charged with ether. For example, if you put 1500 ether you can shoot it 500 times. You can always uncharge it and get the 1k ether back
---
Damn. Had this idea for a while now but never got around to implementing. Good shit. What’s left for it to be complete?
---
they cant do shit with just ur username, otherwise all the big stakers/big names would be hacked daily.
---
Jagex have already outlined that it would not be possible to expand backspace further (can’t remember the reason but it’s not just because they don’t want to or server storage space).
---
This is why you see things like the stash, the Poh storage chests and the seed vault being brought to the game .
---
HA!
---
Maybe a damage/accuracy bonus for a full crystal set equip?
---
Full rune d long, 75 combat, watch out mate
---
It's just the same face photoshopped onto tons of kitten pics, but yeah the original is kinda sad knowing the teary eyes is some kind of infection :(
---
At least get barrows gloves before training imo
---
We've shown our power as a community by forcing Jagex to address their shortcomings and fix their process. If we refocus that energy towards OSRS HD, it will happen.
---
Damn what a coincidence. Anyone in Charleston?
---
Yep Everytime I forget a tele on a slayer task I habitually check exp as im using a home/mini game tele it stops me dead. Super annoying.
---
Yeah I don’t like that one. We’ve wanted the poll results hidden forever and already people are trying to meme against it
---
People want OSRS HD? I play specifically because the graphics are the way they are.
---
༼ ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉ ༽

if ur 99 all in rs3 buy a bond there

The pure scene kids are a special breed. In order to qualify, you must dye your hair black, listen to emo/screamo music, paint your nails black and wear heavy makeup irl. Send an irl video detailing all of this to your prospective pure scene clan to be considered. Gl.
---
The reason why they're popular is that they feature things we wouldn't otherwise do. That's why ppl watch porn, to see people have sex. U know..
---
Message me.

Odds on that being the truth? Would you lie to me Wolf?
---
If this sub focused on a cure for cancer it’d be gone in a week
---
Two tips that made defender a lot easier for me:
---
1. Food is "correct" or "incorrect" based off when you drop it. You don't need to pick up and redrop the new foods every 30s.
---
2. You can use the wrong foods intentionally to direct the runners away from certain areas. At the start of the round I drop the wrong food by the cave exit and between the left cannon hill and the exit to corral the runners towards the right side of the room. Then I go and make trails of the correct food leading to the trap.
---
ikr i get so pissed when my bf won’t eat my pussy while i play flash games on neopets.com &gt;:(
---
Can you sell the kits? I always thought it was like a kraken where its lost upon combining. Learn something new every day
---
I checked it in a DPS calc a little while back, less accuracy and less DPS
---
I agree the cape shouldn't be super useful on top the other rewards, but 10 per day can be a bit low given how many teleports there are. But I'd rather keep it 10 than give it unlimited.
---
I know. Here farming clues
---
Yea especially if you can woox walk. Bp spec is more dps than bgs spec. I get 4-5 kills per trip. Would get more if I left the bones. On the better trips I have to drop food so I don’t have to leave the bones.

What's funny is that msb actually does more dps than crystal bow. Crystal bow is only better on higher def monsters. Cbow with special bolts is definitely more dps and is even cheaper than crystal bow.

I concur, my f2p only beginners clue uim got some sick upgrades after this update.

I just play both most of the time but BFA is so abysmal I just flat out quit until classic/next xpack.

I think he did a bet like this in the past regarding one of the world first races in WoW and won $100 from one of the members of chat.
---
A lot of the chat are quite personal with him on discord and other platforms so I believe most of the bets have been made with those people and would likely pay up.

However I'm not the guy or the people betting so can't talk on behalf of them I'm just sat here enjoying the C O N T E N T

I think the HD graphics really changed the atmosphere of the game for the best. I loved the amount of detail and the way things looked, felt like a improved version. But rs3 graphics are an abomination

Your comment is a perfect example of what happens when there’s a picture of a woman on the internet vs picture of a man on the internet

I’d say Brews are really only needed for the last boss, but I did the fight without Brews and used Sharks. Took a couple tries though and I ran out of food on Galvek. Would recommend Manta Rays if you can’t use Brews

don’t think so. Part of me feels like group Iron will take a while to come to fruition. If ever
---
I love that you get various content creators to collaborate in your lore videos
---
I agree, I just think it's even more likely/easier to pull off with less suspicion if the numbers aren't constantly displayed.
---
Well for starters, you.
---
I hope so, I want a new skill darnit
---
Seriously, who even wants HD?  It is completely counter to the OSRS aesthetic and is a pointless time and money sink.  And if you really want it, why not just use the runelite plugin?
---
This seems like another issue where a small vocal minority bitches so much that it makes it seem like there is general consensus
---
How have you gotten 50 clue since the release of this? What.
---
Upvoted as this just recently happened to me maybe 3 days ago. I also followed secure practices and still got hacked on my hardcore.
---
Man I’ve seen a lot of interest in it. I know me and my group want to make iron men but we want to do group. That would be like 4 subs they would get back lol
---
oo spoopy
---
You'll get it. Watch the videos and take your time. Focus on improvement of loot and you'll be happier. First few raids will suck.
---
The game would crash when you try to wear gender specific items.
---
Runelite is the most popular client, so yes.
---
Who farms easies? Why not meds?

*genuinely*
---
rdoogan. I'm not on too much but I'll be your friend if you like! Gz on the rangers!

yeah this is about what i was experiencing. basically he would just fuck me up with the style i wasnt praying a lot. at first i thought there was some mechanic i wasnt understanding but i think i was just unlucky.
---
            .
---
Yup, quit a few month into BFA because it was trash and started up OSRS. I’ll go back when a new Xpac or vanilla comes out and just play RS on the side.
---
i feel like its split,  i think more people want it than you think.
---
And some people don’t care about a black hole that looks like it was taken from an Android’s snapchat. I’m only interested in seeing a black hole when there’s a video of it sucking everything and anything around it like my ex did
---
I only sub to UIM verf for that raking content. What a lad.
---
Lmao I have so many unanswered questions, are you trolling the OP or what? I complimented your pics please respond lmao
---
Get that RS3 shit-think out of here.
---
Dis is gud point lmao
---
I had assumed vork was better gp/h with roughly 50m more gear investment, and it would be fun to mix it up. Dhcb may be overkill. Would you just zul up to raids? Any other fun moneymakers I’m missing?
---
It's so annoying it'll be such a big jump in requirements as well. I've had the current requirements for ages but now I'm going to need 20 levels of construction and herblore which will be so expensive
---
What would he watch out for? He *is* the thug.
---
Lets downvote the photoshop crap. Guy posted for free karma
---
You wear max mage defense gear not max mage accuracy when you're at kraken.
---
I’d get an Occult for Zulrah if you haven’t gotten it already. 
---
Seems like a decent plan, Zulrah while not as much GP/kill I find myself powering through kills much faster than Vork without DHCB. 
---
Vorkath with DHCB is basically a GG money maker and you can always sell your DHCB to fund the last bit of gear needed for Raids.
---
downvote for /r/woooosh
---
Yeah it does go hard from that point onwards 😂
---
I hate runescape -\_-
---
5K?

I just got supreme pet randomly on 284KC while doin a task.

It’s not for the accuracy it’s for the %mage damage bonus.

its not really "2007scape" anymore anyway. Plus the whole point of osrs was the old combat system.
---
Curious to see the smackdown on this one. Gl.
---
yikes
---
This changes everything
---
We need 2009-2011 graphics.
---
The 4% doesn't mean shit if you need to leave 3-4 times to restock because you are getting destroyed for not having defense.
---
CHUT UP!
---
Vork is better with rigour and dhcb. You could do gwd and slayer to make money
---
The guy in the back can't kill Elvarg
---
Yup, there is so much osrs youtube content out there so who I watch is more based on the video production quality and personality than what content they're doing.
---
As a chemistry major, seeing that spectra and quantum related stuff was really cool. Especially since I took an extra course all on spectroscopy! Chemistry and agility are awesome, runecrafting too!
---
im not starting anything.
---
I'm always disturbed by the lava hellscape that surrounds the freaky forester's serene pheasent patch.
---
I assume you know the face of everyone who worked on the project then?
---
That lowers your battery time immensely
---
I wouldn't worry about the cost my friend, your time is more valuable than the gp! :)
---
70 con and 70 herb are really inexpensive if you have an account that achieved the quest cape, typically. Especially if you already got your house to a livable point.
---
Do you?

Her team has backed her up on this. I'm taking their word for it.

---
ok, so another question, why are there limited number of instances? this is unique to this boss, isnt it? seems really strange to me.
---
They literally slapped in 9 new rewards for the med caskets, 5 of them are the same worthless item lmao.
---
Yeah I’m a one skill at a time person, forcing myself to work on what I need rather than what I enjoy kind of makes it feel like work.
---
That being said, I also want to max my account, and working on the skills that take the longest also seem to make good money in the long run, so I work on those first, I got mining and smithing both at 99. Alongside those two and high Runecrafting profit is huge. Of course I also work on other skills to kill the monotony a little bit, but I’m trying to make the hard one a priority.
---
Next up after 99 Runecrafting will be Farming and Herblore together, I’m slowly getting through all the quests too. Dragon Slayer 2 and Monkey Madness 2 are my last two quests and currently Dragon Slayer 2 is holding me up, as I’m trying to beat Vorkath for the first time...
---
Pure scene streams play Blood On The Dancefloor and Brokencyde way too much
---
It's the same as using the GPU for anything.  You can change it back after.
---
That's scary to think about.
---
Lmao, awesome. I love these comics so much. x'D
---
I know you may not know, but this is a slight misuse of this meme.
---
7/11 was a part time job
---
Whats the 0.33% based on anyways? How do you even quantify amount of work done by a specific person in such a large scale projecT?
---
I identify as a moss giant. 
---
I wanna play as a moss giant.
---
I honestly hated farming but I forced myself to do my tree + fruit tree run once a day. Took me about a week to get from 22 to 60 with no effort. 
---
Once you figure out your route, make a bank tab with all the supplies and teles in and its a breeze. The initial push to set that up is the hardest part but realistically takes 10-15 mins for startup then 5 mins per day once you get into it.
---
Now I can get 50% more runes when elite hunting at barrows! 
---
Farming sucks but it unlocks cool shit.   Just do it!
---
I'd imagine they will figure out some way of only asking people that actually participate in PvP about PvP related changes (unless they would  impact other parts of the game). This makes sense as I kind of feel like I am ruining the integrity of polls when I vote on things that I do not care about.
---
Example from the current poll: permitting Pest Control games to start with less than 20 people (I think that's what it was). I could not care less about this question, I wouldn't do PC on some niche server without tons of people participating.
---
Wow! Appreciate the response. This feels much more digestible than the in-game tutorial for me personally so I'm very grateful!
---
Please end my suffering.
---
Am I better off using a ring of suffering (I) or archers ring (I) against vorkath?  I have elite void and am using blow pipe+bgs but I only have 76 defence.
---
i thought you get the sceptres from the middle chest, how are all 3 of yours on the ground after you leave?

Good chuckle.

How do you delete someone elses post
---
Guthans mystic boots and gloves with slayer dart is how I roll
---
Pretty sure he said that bc there were ~300 scientists working on it but I could be wrong
---
I don't think runelite has its own api for trading values tho right, I thought it used osbuddys? Maybe it's changed tho and I'm wrong though.
---
I would've bought it if it was functional. Whats the point of buying a spade that cant dig and isn't wieldable? Just to spice up those screenshots with a gold spade in the invy that serves absolutely no purpose? Its the functional equivalent of fashionscape for your inventory..
---
This worked for me! Thank you much! :)
---
What do better graphics have to do with adding slayer monsters and slayer bosses? big time waste imho
---
I was wondering where the Pauli Matrix question came from but it's probably from some physics of chemistry class. I hated those.

Lol I love the pms

Don't think it has been confirmed, you can be the one to find out

Don't be fooled, Vorkath is actually easier than Zulrah.

How are you 12 masters in? I need help getting masters/elites

---
If you watch where the orange one spawns (or pay attention to the 45 on wave 3) you can be prepared to stand there right in front of jad. Make sure at the end of wave 61 you stand in the middle so the orange 360 doesnt move. That fuckface outside of the caves puts up a message and you have at least 4  seconds to click jad and prepare to click whichever pray you need. I feel like luring is harder unless you're experienced.
---
Well then I'm not sure why you asked me that question because I didn't either.
---
You're thinking of Wolf
---
The name you login will stay the same. What you would be changing is your display name.
---
&gt; Saying something is easy because something else is a lot harder does prove a point.
---
This is Runescape, the end goal is 99 in a given stat. 75 is 1/10th of that amount. 
---
10 percent. 
---
You're telling me, to put things behind 10% of their potential maximum is simply too high.
---
Then who took the picture? Hmm, really makes me think...
---
beat his ass
---
Whatcha doing lol, just click the gate. I haven't seen this dialogue in years
---
Nice work.
---
Some people don't have a lot of RS friends and just want to share their loot with someone..
---
Don’t waste your time with this RNG trust me lol
---
Had that question on my exam last month too
---
Ok?
---
His statement would be accurate if the work was distributed evenly across the 300 scientists but some people contribute more than others, and even then lmao its incredibly hard to quantify that.
---
Assuming android
---
They spawn at a specific part of the quest and you have to go kill them. I don't know how it works if multiple people are doing the same part of the quest at the same time. When I did the quest (and was the only one doing the part on that world), I had to wait for each tortured gorilla to spawn after I killed one.
---
this update seriously devalued my easy clue only uim
---
Look closer
---
Yea I dont suggest he camps them, especially off task with those stats.
---
I just figured I had to tell somebody because I dont have any friends that play RS lmfao.
---
Oh, right. The trading API is exclusive, but the fewer people that use OSB, the less accurate trade information is because of it. I thought he was asking if there was an alternative client.
---
Rabbits are popular testing animals, so this is plausible af.
---
Archer's ring.
---
Hm. Wonder when everyone will finally get tired of this. Was funny like the first 10 times, now it's just predictable
---
Harlow?
---
:'(
---
Predict jad spawn with the level 45 on wave 3, then safe spot him. pray range and listen for mage sound.
---
lvl 99 photoshop
---
To add to this, your top 3 tradable items go to your inventory while all of the untradables you were wearing remain equipped - explaining why you had some armor on when you respawned
---
Just kill the healers. As long as they didn't heal Jad to full they won't respawn.
---
My point exactly.

I picked letter 3.

It was only around 8 mil total for me to do it.

why did u give your pass and pin to a phishing website
---
The others who worked on the project said the project wouldn't have come together without her so maybe just trust what they have actually publicly stated?
---
Its doable
---
Yep I know how to play the game without max gear in every slot.
---
I see, that makes sense. Also, yeah, I've been out of the loop for even longer than that haha
---
Experience Ironman with friends?
---
Warding will be rigged and passed
---
Not really sure yet. I might grind vork for a bit to get some money to throw into my skills or to get some BiS weapons and armor, since I use kind of shitty gear for my level

no for everything.  Let jagex decide what they want to do.

You're right but nobody here is going to agree with you.

Do it

And

Bwaaaaaahhhh!

You can do that now already

Crystal crossbow would also be a cool addition, similar to crystal bow but... a crossbow instead.

I think it might be a TSM reference from tsm legends.

Pvp is being bombed because most people 1) don't play the game for pvp and 2) are tired of being 'abused' by pk'ers.

There was some dude that logged in to Varrok westbank last night just to announce his curry didn’t burn then he logged out.

There is a big fat notification in the chatbox if a poll is running, still doesn't motivate me to vote for things like "remove green pixel from construction icon" or sht like that
---
Atleast the clue tutor in lumbridge pub mentions them, so I assume so
---
If it wasn’t rigged and it passed people will still say it’s rigged so people will just believe what they want. I want warding personally
---
Could be to some people
---
lol, thats a mess. apparently the guy already gave out 600m so it seems weird he would rig this, but it totally looks like he's just trading himself on another account

Wait so are you a physics major or a chem major or posted something that “looks complicated”

Genuinely curious o.o

This has more readings than you originally intended to show.

My thoughts on the gilded spade are simple: If somebody were to acquire one, why in the fuck would they ever take it into deep wildy just to dig up a clue?
---
I cried and laughed having my hopes up for a bit
---
Two different spells requiring the exact same runes in the exact same amounts. My understanding of how runes work in the lore is that you cast a spell using a certain amount of distinct runes and they work together and cause an output, whether it be a teleportation or a spell you can target at something.

Couldn’t even tell, what kind ocd shit is this?

chymistry does cox leeches for diary hunters, you just have to sign up and then sit in the starting room until they are done

---
hockey leaked into us
---
someone just "skipped and afked" his way to 2k+ total and a diary cape? 
---
Think logically. A player isn't a lazer focused robot who is rushing to do zulrah and only zulrah for 1k+ kills. 
---
Yes it is theoretically possible to do zulrah without experiencing much content of the game. Theoretically. If that was your only goal. What does zulrah get you? Money? To skill? To do other pvm? Why would someone play the game to skip everything to somehow do zulrah, which only has a purpose of getting you money to do more of the content?
---
Not to mention, how would you even hear of zulrah as a new player since its considered rather high level content.
---
O_O so its possible
---
But you could post the status of the votes to reddit. Causing the issue people sought to fix.

I feel like somebody that doesn't have sex would just assume this.

Go do barrows and get some better gear, you don’t need fire cape for barrows it would be more efficient to do that first

Didnt ask (jk gz)
---
Demonic gorillas I still need to do MM2 but I heard it wasn't as profitable any more? Vorkath, from what I've heard isn't as good with only 75 range and you don't make as much money as higher levels.
---
Imagine hating women so much you make a comment like this.
---
group in general is possible, yeah. it just requires a lot of changes to pid/clan system in general.
---
Nice, I'll prioritise doing MM2 soon so I can do it. What gear do you recommend?
---
It's all good thanks, can live with 2x since it's still a decent improvement. Also, na it wasn't the interface style.
---
If you have no friends, who took the picture?
---
He told you, "Mostly thanks to your full name (and other stuff)  you've posted on reddit". Run energy visibility is most likely how he got the rest.
---
Lol no. Vast majority had sick accounts long before they had any significant internet presence. They just really enjoy the game and are looking for new challenges. Why do you think ironman accounts are so popular? And who wouldn't want to turn their hobby into their job?
---
This makes my insides hurt but in a good way. Much appreciated.
---
You don't *really* need qp cape after you finish lumby elite. Obviously you wanna do the good quests (like the elf will be} for the rewards still
---
I recently did 1k rune dragons and made out with 56mill after all sold in GE. Kinda guessing here, I think it was ~50-60 kills per hour. 
---
Without rare drops I would guess it's about 1.5m/hr profit.
---
Another update to make clues more difficult (not literally difficult, more time consuming and reqs) for rewards that wont be worth much within a few weeks. Yay
---
protect prayers and iban blast would make this cake for your stats, invest in those 3 prayer levels very worth it.
---
what
---
Mostly database leaks, and a bit of googling
---
If you register on websites (that inevitably will have database leaks) using your Runescape username/email, you are just asking to be hacked
---
If I wanted HD runescape, I'd play rs3
---
Don’t know, don’t care :)
---
its like a hybrid of leggings and a skirt. Like skorts, jorts, or skants!
---
He's got vork and demonic gorillas wtf are you smoking
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
I've heard some of these people talk about training hunter so they can possibly catch dragon and lucky implings, but it will be interesting to see what happens once they are actually able to catch them. They are so rare to spawn in the first place, I think it will be a pretty difficult grind to get the items you want
---
Oh bro :(
---
Alch yourself
---
Why do you have multiples of certain things like the books etc. Is there a reason I'm missing?
---
Not a btw, but took me 446 for my first
---
BOOTS!
---
nope, adamant item
---
I 100% never voted on anything that was drastically winning or losing. Surely others have the same mindset. Hidden results objectively provide better and more accurate results.
---
Imagine hunting the most common pet in game. Lol.
---
flipping is for the GE not reddit
---
I'm so sorry for your loss ❤
---
10/10 argument
---
So, there's no negative to Jagex basing an update on the reddit algorithm when it directly contradicts an in game poll?
---
This is amazing
---
Neature!
---
don't vote at all.
---
Dunno. Monks robe g is still expensive. Monks t might stay pricy.
---
This thread is not about the merits of hiding polls.  It's about the merits of Jagex listening to reddit instead of the polls.
---
-.- I got that far but how do I customize it so it tells me how much exp left till a certain level not how much I've done etc.
---
HNMRs my FAVORITE
---
So you think the DMM prize money would be enough to support an entire second team of artists to make brand new assets for every single piece of new content in the game as it's released. And you don't think that would be a waste of resources? DMM is for advertising - and it's probably a very cost effective method of doing so.
---
I got the pixel 3 xl and it runs fine with the fps limited
---
Reeeee Jagex is making me play their game reeeee

For research of course
---
So many rs3 items lol
---
Only use I can think of for crystal bow is killing the respiratory systems at sire
---
It'll make the server wonky. Thats the only reason.
---
From what I understand they are either looking for engine devs and/or freeing up resources for them. At least that's what I think I've kinda gathered from the Q&amp;A streams and such (Ash seems to provide the most information about this).
---
What I've also heard Ash say is that they're slowly rewriting certain bits (or major ones) to be less of a mess, so they can be extended more properly in the future. It probably just takes a very long time to get this sorted, especially with a humongous game like OSRS (in terms of different mechanics etc).
---
I'm not sure if a full rewrite to something else would be viable to be honest. Not that I have a lot of experience with it myself (rewriting large codebases, that is), but from what I've read, it's a pain. There are billions of small bugfixes and unintended side effects that have grown into features over the years, and you have to keep all of them.
---
On the other hand, it's a custom programming/scripting language, and there may be huge benefits by switching to a modern programming language. Then again, we don't know anything about the features of runescript I think, so it's hard to judge.
---
Let's hope they manage to improve it rather sooner than later though! And I'm definitely curious to see where changes to the engine can take us. :)
---
Not sure how relevant these are to the thread but crafting and construction cape are great too

Not everything needs to be polled. It's an integrity change. It was polled before sure, but that was a mistake to begin with. It was obvious that the majority of the playerbase wanted it. Even if they didnt, jagex has every right to change it anyways. exactly how they have every right to buff/nerf drop tables without polls. If they feel it is better for the health of the game then that is their choice as developers, not the community.
---
If that in the case, that is not a good thing and if you want someone to talk to you can pm me
---
Awesome!

Like +1 prayer to pures. O wait

Same thing happened to me yesterday, not a bug. I ended up buying Eclectic implings cause I went dry for 45 minutes with a cannon. Somehow. Then I got Holy sandals. Very fun day.
---
Join a clan chat and make new friends?
---
Nah just Lizardman. Chances are you got it already and missed it. Drop rate is 1/250
---
Love it!!
---
Runecraft bad
---
Jesus my guy Ctrl+t and easy transform to fit.
---
For me by far the worst master clue steps are the three part clues fragments. Dig in the legends quests spot takes like 5 minutes an is only one third of a step.
---
Should of brought a hybrid switch to drop that kid to show him he the boss is
---
That’s a good point. I don’t think kids are getting suckered into gambling because of runescape though
---
Can someone explain this? Is there a specific new track you need to do a lot of elites for?
---
BA is great though
---
Here's the thing about a smithing rework, they would have to entirely rework every single mob drop in the game. The reason stuff has value attached to it such as rune is because it requires such a high level to mine/smith. All those rune drops would be worthless and what would take their place on a drop table?
---
ahahahah nah i lost like 50k but i will probably still use the same tactic but be more wary. Didn't think any would be there
---
If you use runelite it takes a snapshot everytime you complete a clue or acquire a level in a stat
---
You had sang staff at 87 slayer 70hp?
---
You're an idiot. You don't understand statistical bias at all. Also, quit dodging questions lmao.
---
I've never got one that one seems shitty lol
---
No like starting the kill at 70hp
---
So it's a good thing to change then?
---
Maybe it’s the mimic boss room music track
---
Wait f2p has clue scrolls now? How do I get them?
---
I'm more surprised at the level 40 agility with a giant squirrel
---
The flicking isn’t so hard on its own, it’s when the healers come out that I make mistakes
---
this would be awesome lol
---
Right, so it's the hopelessness of the skill that gets to you? The fact that it's a bother and you're not rewarded enough for the effort?
---
yea I’m pissed too man, I didn’t notice the sarcasm, and I didn’t wanna spoil your mood.
---
That's kinda the point I'm trying to make - it shouldn't be the case that you're better off using another shield, especially when the dragon has a weakness to magic. Adamant / Rune dragons use ranged attacks, so when you use shield intended to be good against their low magic defence, you're actually punished for doing so. Really, this change is more to bring it in line with the other shields - there's no reason for it to be the only DFS with negative defences.
---
Oh nbd. I’m still trying to get rangers. Ranked Like 7,000 in mediums done with no rangers or sandals
---
I'm on mobile.
---
I have yet to see this? And also, what was stopping Jagex from rigging the poll results even when they were visible?
---
Nope. All rune items are practically sotting at their high alch price. Itll never get cheaper than that.
---
Well that sucks. I am sorry that happened to you.
---
With the new treasure trail update yesterday, you have a chance of fighting a mimic casket boss upon trying to open an elite or master casket, and during the fight there is a new soundtrack.
---
Lol I see. Yes I agree
---

When I first smithed some addy darts months ago, and I found out what you have concluded (afk xp for no loss or a small profit) I thought I could easily train smithing to any level. Unfortunately, I gave up on that. Although it feels bad blowing money on blast furnace, smithing just takes a lil too long for me otherwise
---
was gonna say I haven't seen anyone say anything about that either lol, I feel like hes seen 1 or 2 people complain and now wants to rant about it
---
Rune stuff has value because of its alch value
---
Poll results unhide once they finish, right?
---
Basically. No profit, bad xp, mindless. Most other skills have other options, or benefits. Agility is very limited.
---
Shout out to the chad training in the back, I owe it to him
---
We aren’t a hive mind so idk why you are surprised. A couple idiots are always going to bitch no matter what they do.
---
ikr
---
Hey 'Myeww' wanna show us some posts of people claiming they're gonna rig it?
---
Questing.
---
skewing results now are we, why not let whoever votes, vote and see if hidden polls are better or not.
---
Sold two for 289m ea
---
I haven't seen anyone complaining too hard, but I haven't looked for it. It's mostly just been people amused by their &gt;100gp casket and wanting to share from what I've seen
---
Cannon is animated in RS2 so it evens out
---
The Ip for Swampletica is: swampleti.ca
---
I like it because when I pull it out during lecture, I blend in with my peers.
---
pretty impressive that that Mac has a windows desktop.
---
yes, i know its entirely fake, but cmon at least try
---
Actually kinda crazy how important alch value is to the economy. I wonder if they understood the impact a level 55 magic spell would end up having when they designed it.
---
Didn't see any replies in your post history about this, are you sure it didn't happen in a dream?
---
Gucci climbing boots
---
Imagine thinking jagex would need to hide the results to rig it..
---
You will do damage yes go ahead and do it if money is no problem!
---
That's part of the problem though. Should you be able to Smith an item that alchs for 40k at 40-50 smithing?
---
Levels 1-10 agility specifically
---
This is not uncommon knowledge and is also not a 2007scape post.
