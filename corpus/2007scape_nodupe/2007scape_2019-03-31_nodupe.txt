See this situation right here is why I always look stupid.
---

---
I need to talk to my girlfriend.. I hope she‚Äôs online 
---
---
---
I like this. However i'd want to keep the mining spot in place or a shop or two.
---
Are you stupid? Only he doesnt see himself...
---
I mean its in the game, jagex would disable it if it were cheating
---
what else is he gunna say though. cant blame him
---
You could make a zerker, although you will probably level over 45 defense if you haven't quested your defense.
---
I was busy this evening and couldn‚Äôt watch, what did they do to fix this?
---
Your comment makes no sense. If bots and gold farmers were buying more DHCs, the price would increase due to more demand. Also, DHC comes through the CoX. The DHC, along with the Sang Staff and Ghrazi Rapier are all being used for pump and dump schemes.
---
It's fucking stupid that it lets you see people standing underneath you but the ::renderself command is a feature built into the game itself so everyone has the option to use it so he's not doing anything immoral by using it, unfortunately.
---

---
We will follow your career with great interest.
---
Because businesses are driven by measurables. Memberships have been increasing at a steady growth rate. There's no business reason for them to make a major investment on something that presents far more risk (based on historical models) than potential ROI. I agree that if they rebuilt it they could do it right and all of us who already play would be quite happy. But until they start bleeding from lost membership, its really not worth it to them as a company.
---
No u
---
if you recover your account it is assumed you may not have access to the authenticator, so they must provide a vector for account recovery where there is no authenticator.  
---
This is the issue as I understand it, if they required authenticator after a recovery for website then people would never be able to access their account after recovering it.  
---
Ultimately I think the authenticator is fine, the problem is when the hacker gains access to your email, then they can recover the account, sign in, remove authenticator, and get into your account.
---
He uses ::renderself so his client wont render his own character so he can see what his opponent does whenever he dd's under him
---
Dude you missed off most the stuff from February and this month
---
you can write ::renderself into chat to hide yourself, this way you can see when people stand under you
---
thats what manked did in this clip
---
we need to nerf the fog
---
do it or I will quit the game
---
That‚Äôs very misinterpretable from the phrasing. Understandable, enjoy your day.
---
oh shit
---
fucking lol dude. 5 minutes to log back in and only 1/2 the 1/2 of player who died. Hoooooly fuck
---
I would also like to know 
---
I think this is Manked, who essentially stopped rendering himself on his computer so that he can see his enemy when the enemy is beneath him, so he can figure out what to pray etc.
---
lmaoooooooo
---
How much we'd have to pay per month to get real customer support.
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
More than you can afford, pal. 
---
It just doesn't make sense to me how the save account information to the servers. Why does each account have it's own separate time to sync to the servers. Why would they not sync all the accounts at once. It would be way easier for rollbacks.
---
You kinda don't get to comment on other egos buddy while trying to embark on a grand crusade to make everyone aware of how much you dislike J.K. Rowling.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\&gt; But you‚Äôre literally just here to bitch because I called out Harry Potter as being trash and you got your feelings hurt. 
---
As established, sharing an opinion you can't back up with the class isn't calling anything out sweetie.  It's just laboring under the delusion that your opinions have value and that you're somehow more relevant as a person for loudly trumpeting them.  Free life lesson.
---
No one who enjoyed Harry Potter actually cares about your opinion about the books.  I'm just here because you're low hanging fruit - you throw shit at the fan and when it flies back you come crying to mommy.
---
Were they able to fix it?
---
H
---
Sit
---
To be fair you actually have 3 shrimp per shrimp.
---
Port sup
---
makes sense thank u
---
50 attack pure is a good OP option to start with, and if you get bored, you can always level the attack to 60 or 75
---
fog killed everyone when 1v1 started
---
Why is it not the case that actions made to players are audited so you can just rollback. Honestly it boggles the mind.
---
I agree that it impacts the game experience negatively. I don't have much time to play because of my job so it's hard to not get affected by it :(. RIP the good childhood times when time seemed infinite.
---
Oi leave our Ben alone, he's precious and did no wrong. 
---
&gt; Sadly our recovery efforts were only capable of returning ~half of the affected players.
---
Or just not being able to log back in at all
---
&gt;We'll address the affected players at a later date.
---
LOL. Same time as prizes get sent out, no doubt. 
---
Literally just have 1v1 tournaments and do away with dmm 
---
RIP anyone with ears
---
He can see what his opponent is doing under himself, removing the advantage they have therefore giving himself an advantage
---
Imagine being able to use only the email to call into support and recover an account without any other information that doesn't belong to you. I can tell you fail to see why their support isn't what you claim.

How can you move away from calling people African Americans when applications still ask you to list yourself as an African American. Of course I‚Äôm talking about the applications or forms in America. But you can‚Äôt say we stopped saying African Americans when applications are calling black people african Americans. Until it actually transitions to ‚Äúblack‚Äù then we‚Äôll fully stop calling them African american . So what if I said African American. Granted the person I was referring to is actually from London, which I didn‚Äôt know. I wasn‚Äôt defining him as African American, i was stating that he was black and should‚Äôve just said black. This community though, what‚Äôs the big deal lol.
---
Imagine hoping a decently sized company would be able to at least somewhat properly host a tournament. I know right. Totally unreasonable 
---
In Edgeville can't you just glory to the bank, dump inventory, and run back before it appears to other players?
---
I wish LMS was more like the deadman finals.

Can someone fill me in on what happened?

Hey the fuck up could already be in game, just not discovered yet!

90% of my defense is prob from quests I probably should have prefaced
---
I get 3 weeks, where you working?
---
What a fucking joke. DMM is hilariously bad.
---
I didn't know this, that changes my opinion completely. This is weird but fair game.
---
These have to be attempts at publicity stunts.
---
If the bigger streamers stopped playing it all together the entire game mode would die, blame them tbh.
---
Imagine being able to recover accounts and not being able to change your own answers. And if your account gets hacked, no items are given back.
---
It creates one total ratio buy/sell = buy-sell ratio, so yes you are right. My bad for not making that clear in my comment Haha. Anyhow, nah, buy sell ratio indicates positive or negative sentiment. Basically for RS, this indicates that a lot more people are not buying the DHC compared to people selling it within a given time frame.
---
shut up ho i'll 1 tap your ass fix ur aa nerd nice paste
---
23s is a good example.
---
That explains it, and LMAO. Good job, Jagex

Filibuster is still wrong, buddy.

Fun fact: During the terrorist attack in Utrecht, the Netherlands earlier this month the whole country saw the culprit on camera footage shared on social media and the news, his name was also widely shared. The police who had the city on lockdown and are supposed to find the guy only got told there was footage with his name and face around 3-4 hours later, while the whole country knew already. Mainly because the police gets their intel by radio and that whole system sucks.
---
Source: My dad who was there on duty.
---
Its a quality meme, you should be proud
---
Cuz that is really boring - people watch dmm because of the risk element. Rs PvP is inherently dull to watch otherwise.
---
i'm not gonna pretend to know anything about servers etc... but is there really no way to find out what stats/gear people had 30 seconds ago &amp; revert to that? if not, why not? doesn't have to be for the whole game even, just for dmm. baffling
---
I see now! Thanks
---
Watch his cursor click and pay attention to his gear, he switches gear completely while his cursor isnt moving nearly fast enough to make that 1 tick 6 way, not to mention its pretty much impossible to switch like that and barrage in the same tick. A lot of people like to yell AHK, but this is ACTUALLY AHK. 
---
j mod gave him 96 poison dmg and he died :(
---
indeed.
---
Just look at the trend, not that hard. Facebook keeps getting into scandals too
---
only half of the players, didn't get their stats or gear back
---
Hahaha
---
You should be fine then.  Zerker is good for your current stats.
---
It‚Äôs john fucking cena and you cant see him

Sparc mac hopped to it for a drop party at one point I think
---
Troll post is troll.

they should just remake it tomorrow. 
---
LOL
---
Kinda cool though, he went from full Infinity then 1v1d to the better gear
---
He deserved that lol karma is a bitch 
---
Yooo that had me cracking up at work 
---
oopsie doopsie jogflox mek a fookie wookie.
---
I used to get 2 weeks lmfao what are you on?
---
That has to be the most Australian clip in the world???
---
TIL! I've aleays thought he's eddie murphy
---
jagex left fog on at the final area in dmm so when people were warped there they died immediately lmao
---
"~half" of them were brought back, but with base 94 stats &amp; the same equipment as each other. so it doesn't really matter if you decided to grind for 12 or 120 hours, you're on a level playing field now

I hate how they keep saying that the other clans had an impactful strategy that has taken them this far in the 1v1s

not hard to beat people with scuffed gear...

Does the phrase 'All publicity is good publicity' apply here?

This has been a shit show in every sense of the phrase

Forgot to remove fog from 1v1 area
---
JMod giving him HP and prayer? 
---
TFW this has nothing to do with RuneScape..
---
company size is largely irrelevant. the issue is that most of jagex is paid to work on rs3, not OS. for whatever reason, they're set on leaving their more profitable and popular product with a skeleton crew so it can subsidize the game nobody plays.
---
my guess would be corporate logic dictates the game with mtx has the most potential to be profitable so even though the raw numbers disagree, they still demand more effort be thrown into the game that standard business practice dictates **should** be making more money, even though it isn't.
---
also for this reason i consider it only a matter of time before old school has mtx, once rs3 is totally bled dry. so far, whatever poor sap whose job it is to repeatedly explain to shareholders why adding mtx to old school will kill it overnight has been successful, but these things always go the same way. respect to whoever that guy is, though - it's a difficult and thankless job to try to keep the corporate profit machine at bay.

Sell the gold you have, the game wil only go downhill from now on

i don't even play this shit game anymore but seeing this injustice is infuriating me
---
Meet the Old School team, my budget-locked ultimate ironman. After having trouble QAing the real game, I decided to up the ante: massive technical debt, no tools to fix problems that occur, but this time, we will say "we apologize" when people get DQ'd after wasting a week of their time. All leading up to eventually taking on one of the company's biggest challenges - PvP clans.
---
Esports ready btw
---
I get 52 weeks  
---
YANG GANG SECURE THE BAG
---
not yet? why would he get DQed he didn't do anything wrong.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ywmc6eS.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ywmc6eS.jpg)  
---
Noticed this. It seems the game gave him the round mid-fight. 30 seconds after that message he was teleported out.
---
Download one
---
Way to miss the point (probably intentionally). He's supposed to apologize on behalf of the company, not him personally. That's what being a figure head means. If a company fucks up that bad, it doesn't matter who the specific techie is that fucked up, the person in front of the camera apologizes on behalf of the company.
---
How will this ever be in esports 
---
Why not a jmod crown? Pmods had nothing to do with it
---
I will. Enjoy living in denial. 
---
If someone took time off work to compete in this I feel legit bad for them.  Imagine being so invested in this game you burn time off for a company that literally can't more than 2 days without fucking up.  
---
Rose tinted glasses
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DoubtfulAttractiveArtichokeKreygasm
---
Clip with mankeds chat visible.
---
It looks like for some reason the game thought he won there, restored his stats and started the 30s timer to teleport him to next arena.
---
I presume what happened at the end of the fight where he vanished was those 30s running out.
---
if the suits had their way this game would be crammed full of gachas with sparkly angel wing cosmetics and xp gems. you really want them to step in?
---
So you mean 2.5? Post HD-update but prior to the RS3 UI rework.
---
He did log head ass. Something else happened. 
---
He hit a blood barrage but idk about the prayer
---
he didn't get logged; in the clip with the blood barrage and then get's full hp&amp;pray the game seems to think that he had won the fight as it says: "you have around 30 seconds before you are transported to the next arena"
---
you don't say
---
Dont use the dmm as an excuse for your childish name. Shouldve been permed
---
It wasn‚Äôt a 6 hour log.

Manked doesnt deserve special treatment

ü¶Äü¶Äno beta testing, 11$ü¶Äü¶Ä

Imagine speaking out of your ass , then you realise the US army completely relies on windows xp 
---
It wasnt a 6 hour log they said so on stream. Shits rigged 
---
Bro are you fucking stupid
---
It was over
---
Manked went from 34hp to 99
---
Fools member did another 50 damage on top
---
Now here's some simple maths
---
50 IS MORE THAN 34 THEREFORE HE WON THE FIGHT IF IT WASN'T FOR JAGEX RIGGING IT
---
HOW IS IT YOU ARE THIS FUCKING STUPID YOU AND HALF THIS SUBREDDIT ARE SO FUCKING DENSE IT ACTUALLY PISSES ME OFF
---
Rigged
---
the game seems to think that he had won the fight as it says: "you have around 30 seconds before you are transported to the next arena"
---
Blood barrage would not give that much HP for the hit
---
No we don‚Äôt no one cares 
---
Exactly, they waste money on this shit instead of investing in bettering their game. They could easily hire a consulting team to overhaul and rewrite their engine to modern code with the same game. Quality check it, and launch it to live, unless I‚Äôm missing something I don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt being done for the longevity of the game.
---
Good riddance to you roo. An immature name change is totally related to the same part of Jagex responsible for the tournament. Use your brain fella 
---
Idk the raggers still permeate rev caves
---
He did apologize, he just downplayed it hard af. Guarentee you he was told to downplay it as much as possible. You honestly expect him to come out and say "25% of the players are unable to participate, soz"
---
It wasn't a 6 hour log it was some other part of their system screwing up. Why do you think they would have only gave a streamer a rematch?
---
He's been streaming, so the vods on his channel if you want to check.
---
[His perspective of this round](https://clips.twitch.tv/DoubtfulAttractiveArtichokeKreygasm) makes it look like the server thought he ko'd the guy there for some reason, and started the timer to the teleport which eventually pulled him out of the fight.
---
How did he heal such an high amount from one bloos barage?
---
Are you ayizas alt reddit account

This is just reskinned drake meme, which is just reskinned door man meme, which is just reskinned me gusta meme

regardless of how shit this dmm is this is still a meme. dmm can be a competition with a prize pool and still not be some arbitrary standard of an esport. and the money that comes out for dmm has literally nothing with the budget used for q&amp;a and shit. 
---
Manked won

tell that to jagex

Why can't they just go well already :(

What a stupid comment lmfao

lmao, what a stupid post.
---
If you're in a good clan you get a split and theres a solid chance someone in clan wins.  So still making money while using some of your vacation days that might have went to waste anyways
---
Can you calm down who cares it's not you losing the fight 
---
Why do you say that? Did you watch the clip?
---
How
---
Why is it always a circle jerk to have no more tourney's? Just properly QA the shit an fix it so the tourney goes smooth.
---
Idk its pretty disrespectful to the community at large to allow griefing such as blocking entire areas. 
---
Honestly if your entire strategy is to step on the fingers of people as they try to climb, you deserve to be kicked off mountain by those above you. 
---
Clans are okay, griefing clans, mafia clans, not okay. 
---
Glad jagex did something about it. Clanman mode can get fucked. 
---
Dude I've spend 16+ hours every day for a week, just do get DC'd and not be able to log in again. Holy shit this is depressing and frustrating...

I would totally think it was rigged if I hadn't seen all the other braindead nonsensical bugs and stuff. I can totally believe that his HP just randomly went to 99 for literally zero reason at all with how this has gone
---
Except he did log out: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/403761196?t=01h19m57s
---
You have 1 hour to apologise before i dox you and post it under this comment
---
Don't do the stupid thing and assume im bluffing like all  the other dumb fucks who thought the same.
---
He is stream and has been all tournament. Are u just following what others are mad about 
---
v
---
it is what it is :^/)
---
Wasn't even the blood barrage, you can see his prayer get set back to a full 99 as well.
---
It really looks like he was manually healed/restored in time with the blood barrage. Sketchy as fuck to say the least.
---
They restarted and manked‚Äôs opponent had no food. Wtf is even happening 
---
You're right, i'm so brain dead from this tourny. It never ends.
---
13th dmm tournament
---
anyone's game ‚Ñ¢ 
---
No, watch the clip
---
He was winning before that m8
---
You want too much from them, there are time differences between player backups in range of 10s of seconds, so some traded items were lost or duplicated last time we had a rollback.  
---
Backup system is not ready at all.
---
he eats a shark to 53, then blood barrages to 62 before getting the glitch to 99 hp. that's a 37 hp glitch heal. take 37 from his 60 at the end and it's still 23hp vs 4hp at the end so it's anyones fight. you need to chill dude it's not that big a deal either way
---
He wasn't healed because of the blood barrage. Read the chatbox.
---
You shouldn't expect much when they continuously fuck up their tournies :)
---
Just watch for the drama
---
You may need to rethink your priorities if all you aspire to be in life is a brainless castrated sheep whose sole purpose is being a cog in the corporate machine.
---
You would have to rebuild it to behave in the same buggy and broken manner. I think you undetestimate how impossible that would be
---
Oh god what happened now? 
---
Runescape DMM: e-sports ready!
---
I'm quitting this shit game
---
Because he wanted to and has goals? Lmao
---
crazy how chill he was after getting fucked over and being unable to play 100% because of jagex
---
&gt; No one is going to get offended 
---
&gt; it‚Äôs actually quite racist to say it
---
It seems we have reached an impass
---
Honestly sad that jagex can‚Äôt go a week without a fuckup. You‚Äôd think after this many dmm finals it‚Äôs be figured out but obviously not.

I've been playing osrs for about 2 months now, im combat level 59 by doing a shit ton of quests but i dont really know what else i should be doing.. yes i know i could fish or mine or whatever but i want something more enjoyable to do but i dont quite know what i could do.. i look for guides and stuff constantly but still end up always sitting at my bank not know what i should do.. any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.
---
Lol!
---
When you‚Äôre a company, there‚Äôs laws in place to stop you from gatheting personal information on people without their consent, wo I dunno if they could just do that, legally.
---
Can someone update me what a going on I'm a tad behind 
---
Hahaha fuck
---
When you‚Äôre frozen you plant them to move. Most people use them throughout the 1v1‚Äôs. Also a lot of pkers use them at all times if someone freezes you and tries to run behind a tree you can plant the seeds to attack them before they get the telly off. 
---
This is why I #DO watch DMM. Love me some drama. 
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄMORE CRABSü¶Äü¶Ä

Don't forget your barrow gloves also for maximum strength bonus.

Replace "Refs" with "Jagex" and there's your TL;DR for DMM.
---
Good on Skill Specs
---
Wow. This literally sums up the quality that Jagex truly is as a company. Not that it‚Äôs really Archie‚Äôs fault or anything, I‚Äôm sure someone higher up made the call to not run a beta.
---
It was around 60 people. 256 were supposed to make it and there were just under 196 who actually competed if I remember correctly.

OP is an idiot for not making February drama the dovvy drama, or at least splitting it between dovvy and tbow

imo
---
Perfectly unbalanced
---
He pulls off the one tick six way switch into barrage three times in the clip, flawlessly.  There's just no way that can be legit.
---
Really? I thought it was towards the end. Do you have the two clips?
---
I love that they pimped Torvestas guide. 
---
Best part by far. 
---
Yeah you're right. EA is shit but its shitty customer support makes jagex's look like it's run by a single quadriplegic lobotomized monkey. Blizzard is a great game company so IDK what you're getting on about. They've run multiple successful esports for the past 20 years and have rarely fucked up. Jagex has fucked up in every single fucking tournament it's hosted. Jagex has game breaking bugs EVERY FUCKING UPDATE. Yeah... you're right that you can't compare Jagex to other companies... They're just shit.
---
Hey Jagex you can stop trying to make RS an esport now üòä
---
Seriously though, they‚Äôve ran this thing 10+ times now and there‚Äôs been a major fuckup for each final
---
In Australia you can only buy $30 cards, and it only gives 24 days membership because the card costs money to process or something.
---
See you in hot 
---
LMS is ready 
---
Whats most astounding is that there are grassroot runescape tournaments (like Fantasy EHP) being run by passionate players that are doing a better job than people that are professionally paid to do what they do.
---
Passion beats money. Any day of the week.
---
But then you won't get the void set effect without the gloves

---
As manager her should be expected to properly do his job, and make the tough decision like test the damn updates. Someone should lose their job for this. 
---
Has it really only been a month since the tbow incident? 
---
Almost enough drama this month alone to fill the calender for the year its seemed so much longer. 
---
Thank you for letting us know that Jagex let you know at Zulrah!
---
Ya jagex killed a bunch of people because they forgot to turn off dog in the 1v1 area, fucked up the manked semifinal, etc. legit the worst tourney they‚Äôve had in a long time.

Lmao it's like if an earthquake hit the Olympics and half the contestants died
---
:(
---
Man, that really fuckin sucks...
---
Literally the plot of Infinity War
---
That's probably what the guys who spent weeks preparing for this are thinking.  Thanks for ur support taint.  
---
Torvesta hacked DMM
---
 Ironmen streamers consistently get way more viewership than pvp streamers.
---
The viewership for dmm also spikes as soon as it hits the 1v1 stage. I dont think the clusterfuck of clan chinning/barraging is really drawing people in.
---
Bug killed tons of the people who got through to singles. only half were reinstated but with 94s stats and default weps and armour for all. the other half just out completely. This was all caused because they forgot to remove the fog from the finalist area...
---
Then in one of the semis manked was healed twice to full hp and prayer before being logged out.
---
They then spent another hour talking before a rematch.
---
Overall the hosts had to stall for longer than the tournament was even meant to be for.
---
when that guy said "it is what it is" it's pretty clear they give absolutely no fucks about any of the fuck ups
---
Really is a shame because he probably thought it'd be fun, and also it's always cool to see ayiza but that stream ran so long he will probably never volunteer to commentate again
---
Don‚Äôt give a fuuuuuck
---
I agree he doesn't have the method to heal that much, but it is certainly possible. You can brew, karambwan, then mantaray/angler in 1 tick.
---
I bet he‚Äôs at home laughing his fucking ass off.
---
Update: they insta killed him after they found out there was supposed to be 16 players left but somehow there was 17 players alive. Check my profile for vid
---
I dont understand what's going on. Who is he fighting? 
---
I've never watched swampletics. Can someone who isn't a fangirl tell me how he is on a scale of 1 - 10? I'm subbed to framed/torvesta and a few other youtubers but I'm not really interested in any type of ironmen anymore. Is swampletics really worth the hype?
---
Other way around
---
jagex is being sold/for sale currently, so the next owners might think it's a good idea to invest in things like that, time will tell.
---
Bug killed all of the falador people that made it to 1v1s
---
I‚Äôm joking dude, thought it was obvious.
---
Yup. Saves me from spending thousands on goofing off during my vacation too.
---
Is there a company more embarassing than Jagex? Literally has not stopped fucking up beyond control since Dec 2007.
---
ooops, brought alch runes
---
The whole idea of dmm is resource management, that includes harassing your opponents ability to gather resources. That's why it's PvP. I don't play dmm buts it's a key factor of any strategy game.
---
This meme is bad and will always be bad 
---
I think Jagex is doing good. 
---
Fletching, crafting, mining, thieving can all get some decent money
---
I did woodcutting and mining for a lot of my cash starting out. 
---
But then you won't get the void set effect without the melee helmet
---
Yo sick Falador fight guys! *Teleports* What the fu-BOOOM! 
---
(Three hours later)
---
Peace people *home teleports from finals*
---
Guy using AHK script to gear switch
---
People randomly being fully healed in the middle of a fight
---
People randomly getting teleported away in the middle of a fight
---
[Incomprehensible screeching from the spectators]
---
Should sum it up.
---
Gotta say this was a pretty sad attempt at a dmm final. Esport ready tho as everyone can.
---
Learning how to take a screenshot is a good start
---
What are scorpions if not land crabs?
---
More like seasonal is waste of time and tourney is fun.
---
if you are finishing one kill with extra food but not enough for a second.  Then a more complex switch could be worth it.  However if bringing the switches reduces kills per trip then no its not worth it.
---
He walked away with 4m so basically was.
---
Imagine players going :  
---
"Well, botting just happens"  
---
or   
---
"Well we just happened not to pay for out membership, but we will definitely pay next month maybe"
---
His only 2... lol
---
As i said "i posted it again" i thought that was clear... Guess i must have not made it simple enough for u
---
You missed the sarcasm.
---
fools
---
SUOMI PERKELE HELVETE
---
Rs3 with pvp enabled everywhere. Didnt last long because it was a shit show like dmm.
---
Rip lol
---
Whoops I didn‚Äôt read that fully.
---
I did, but they don't show when you're in the building. I would have had to copy and paste the window onto a screenshot of the building from the outside, which is what I did to get the character in the window in the first screenshot, but to do the reverse would show the jagged pasting since it's close-up, I tried it. I'd rather no roof than obvious editing (Remember no photoshop cuz all my money goes to $11 membership). TBH it's more effort than I expected to put into a meme but I know y'alls standards for good memes around here.
---
/u/dl_lp /u/25xx /u/Legendarydukez I'll just tag you guys in this post to save me spamming replies.
---
If this is the clip I think it is, Mika was scrolling through Twitter and somebody had posted a pic of hardcore gay porn in a RS related feed, obviously trying to troll him and get him banned. He deleted the vod immediately, but a bunch of people clipped it before he could.
---
Pretty dick thing to do as well. Completely ruined the mood of the stream because Mika went from being in comedic disbelief at being fucked by Jagex to being legitimately worried about being banned on Twitch.
---
Better to start them early 
---
I never said his age in it your good.
---
Huh? I said people can do whatever they want in life! Also the irony in your post lol.
---
I'm pretty sure this was the absolute legend in full infinity at the start of the final hour who killed the poor level 73 that ran all the way down to edgeville after looting the chest in wildy.
---
What!!!!
---
I really like this
---
Ahh thanks! :)
---
SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt; Because it doesn't matter how many times they do it,
---
Yes it does matter, its infact all that matters. They refused to beta test this time, we saw what happened.
---
sadly, they do 
---
and carry 6 cannons and 2.147 billion cannonballs
---
That was like the first 5 dmms
---
Didnt get 6 hour logged.
---
What was the fuckup today?
---
I mean, if you want to go and play rs3, you can. It's still there. 
---
The idea of adding something to osrs because it's in rs3 is definatley not how I think this game should be running updates. And I think the majority of the player base would agree.
---
Maybe that's part of why I dont play DMM. Its fun to watch, but man some people are just straight delirious thinking straight up griefing is fine. Im not saying they have to fuckin hand hold every dmm player (albiet they basiclly do) but holy fuck if yall are so chill with these "tactics", hope youre just as okay with these people essentially gettting a free 20k from your $11 sub 
---
Lol wake up pvp babies 
---
Stop tuning in to jagex‚Äôs stream at least.  
---
Kinda sad it won't be the Tracy incident.
---
Church is for the brainwashed uneducated population to become drones for the rich. Almost all priests rape children gg 
---
Some days it feels like a monkey banging on a keyboard could write less buggy code than Jagex's devs. 
---
Yes. Its a toggle
---
That fucking edit had me dying 
---
As an Australian I‚Äôm kinda glad they delayed it so much. I didn‚Äôt miss out on the drama!
---
Adventurequest world's

Star wars the old republic
---
Club penguin
---
Learnin how to take a screenshot is a good start
---
that's a cool idea, and I like it
---
problems with it though... like, how do you sell charges? you can sell runes easily enough, but charges might be tricksy
---
in the books, which are slightly canon, the wizards literally have a bag of different runes and they have to pull out the correct amount of each
---
Who were the botters?
---
It's barely related to the game - in game stuff always takes precedence on the calendar. Anything that gets a sticky from Jagex at the top of the sub especially. It's not even close. In January perhaps dovvy would have made it.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely stupid if you think 19k is livable even converted to USD it‚Äôs definitely not livable unless you live in a poor community and can manage your money, living in a place like Cambridge and make that is impossible
---
Good tournament from him
---
all I see is REEEEEEEEEEEE 
---
he eats a shark and takes a prayer sip in 1 tick, almost the same or on the same tick as his blood barrage hits a 25, which heals him back to full and restores his prayer.
---
pls analyze the clips be4 u start a riot lol
---
So jagex didnt do any rollbacks? And noone took the prize money?
---
I mean I get where you‚Äôre coming from but I feel like most rs players don‚Äôt really care about this dude‚Äôs fucked up love life. There are a ton of videos of weird shit happening on live streams, but a major mmo accidentally causing an infinite respawn of one of the best items in the game is pretty damn dramatic. 
---
This phrase is used more in the context he used than in a sexual context.
---
Oh, sarcasm. I'm dumb lol
---
"Posted it again" could very well mean you saw someone posted it on /r/tinder and decided to... post it again... on /r/2007scape
---
That was a nice display of dedication. Great planning, teamwork and the editting made it a pleasure to watch. Thanks for sharing! 
---
ü¶Ä
---
Too far
---
&gt; The idea of adding something to osrs because it's in rs3
---
but it was in rs2, not rs3.
---
Thats so fucked up..
---
Aight bud i get it ur gonna argue for the sake of arguing... Jus grow up
---
It‚Äôs a reskin galaxy brain meme

I get 25 paid vacation days plus 5 sick days and all federal holidays and I live in the US. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
There are worse grinds tbh
---
There would be no tick delay
---
The guy who gave you the Limbs back made a post about it like 5 minutes before this post lol, He got 2x Limbs after he gave you those 1.5m lol.
---
What's going on with jagex causing these memes 
---
thought it was an hc too scared to leave lumbridge
---
As a casual player it would take me about 5 seconds to do all of that with about 2 mistakes.
---
lmao good on you mate
---
Wraths or double deaths. I like double deaths more because abyss running is pretty chill
---
I'd be down for this. Personally, I've always thought it would be neat to reintroduce the old models in a quest where you return to Tutorial Island. I'd expect the tone would be something like the Gower Quest but the gameplay would be more like Dimension of Disaster where your inventory in the new version of Tutorial Island is separate from your inventory off the island so you'll need to rebuild your gear from stuff on the island to defeat the creatures that have taken it over, building up to a fight with the original KBD.
---
ARE YOU KIDDING? Do you know how much the tourism helps the Falador economy.!?
---
It's wasn't Ash's job in the first place. Testing should be done by the QA and testing team
---
Depends on how many fuck ups. First time no they shouldn‚Äôt.
---
I showed the video of all the finalists to a friend od mine IRL and his expression was just about the same and he doesn't even know much about the game besides what I tell em.  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Moves to Varrock
---
People fucking in my upstairs bedroom
---
How do you tick delay to heal with no food? Rm was clearly by far the fairest way to go.
---
what about the prayer? no explaining that
---
How much do you pay in taxes?
---
Testing your code once to make sure it functions properly isn't QA, that's basic development. Testing every possible thing that could possibly break a piece of code is QA.
---
Well considering it's literally countless fuck ups at this point. Was that meant to be a troll post? Cas good job
---
That‚Äôs not really how development works. Dev‚Äôs job is to write code that compiles successfully while meeting the technical criteria laid out in design docs and specs sheets. From there, testing that product against variable criteria is the job of QA programmers/ specialists. At least this is how it works at like 90% of software companies. That being said, it should be somewhat of a group effort usually, as QA panels usually involve dev and QA techs. 
---
Assert('Free tbows') 
---
The one repost I never get tired of seeing
---
Not rly
---
they usually release the event a week before easter, since easter is 4/21 i would assume that we‚Äôd get the easter event on 4/14. 
---
D
---
Wow this guy actually made it to the last 17 alive. He was hiding in his house, but got instakilled but still funny. made it the furthest out of all the people who got reset.
---
Usually 2 weeks before. Mentioning an Easter update many months prior is pretty useless haha 
---
Question. In dmm. When you start are you starting another account at lev 3 and getting barrows etc in the week? 
---
Yeah, why are your preferances different from mine? 
---
At this rate the rate at this rate is very frequent. At this rate we need daily drama updates at this rate.
---
Another one
---
Ppl mad lol y
---
No anything that he would of mailed to himself would be sold on the AH, only armour and weapons get deleted on the hacked to piss you off, set you back a few hours until it restored. But blizzard have the ability to check on what you have spent and / or traded and who you sent it to. Im assuming they follow the money and ban the hacker. Im on mobile so i can't link but google "wowforums is there a way to check my mail history" two replies down is a GM response who can clearly check on the accounts activity. As for the stuff the hacker might sold on the auction house is now obviously out there for anyone to buy.
---
This is one thing I will give them. These guys don‚Äôt use their regular names so it‚Äôs hard to just know. The rest of it was total dog shit 
---
aite bet bet bet
---
The regular game doesn't, dmm yes. 
---
Nope, they hit through prayer and can match the best range you can have.
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start
---
You are jus unlucky my dude :(
---
Keep at it. Hopefully it averages out for you. 
---
How viable is praying at the alter in town and running back? I'm a UIM and the alch table looks juicy
---
Total witch hunt guys. There was no collusion. Fake news 100%.
---
Never heard it outside the UK but it's quite a common way of expressing the opposite intention of what was previously stated. Is the level of customer support provided by Jagex acceptable? Is it fuck. 
---
well mate. I have some experience about buying accounts.
---
firstly, I bought an account from sythe from a personal seller. But after a while only few weeks. The fucking seller recovered it back. I remember that he helped me changed register email of the account to be mine. but make none sense. He recovered the account back with the original information of the account. 
---
so after that I cant trust anyone in sythe. so that i start to search on google.com. and then I found gamerluck.com. and did some research on google about gamerluck feedback. I found a lot of good reviews about them. so that i decided to give them a go. finally I bought an obby mauler account from them. and i am so happy now. the account is freash new, never registered an email with it when i got it. and they even told me the login email address has not been registered yet.  the login user is like XXXXXXX@outlook.com. so that i registered the email address on outlook.com by myself. and then binded the email address with the osrs account. now i am sure that i will be the only owner of the account. and they told me that the account was trained by their powerlevelers. I think I am safe now:) 
---
But i dont suggest your friend buy high level accounts. the higher level the higher risk of being recovered. just buy accounts from them which was trained by their own powerlevelers. you will be safe. 
---
Whatever happened to Mr Bug? He hosts a massive drop party and disappears?
---
All your skills are going to need some grinding before you can really make good money doing them. You could level your magic high enough for telegrab and telegrab zammy wines for money, you could level your hunter to 60 and start with red chins, you could level your cooking, after about 60 you start to make money doing that too. Feltching after 70ish is probably about 180k an hour. But as far as making money with skills you've got a way to go pretty much anywhere. 
---
Slayer, most of the gear you need you will get as drops... Most of the gear your need to grind gold for is end game stuff.... Slayer = money 
---
Link
---
621 coins nice 
---
Almost no reason not to make a hc if you want a regular ironman unless its going to give you anxiety and ruin the experience
---
I figured as much, I thought maybe it had dropped &amp; I'd missed it but Runelite's confirmed it has yet to appear. Well, back to the token farming I guess.
---
I know this is a little late, but if you notice the announcement for 30 seconds announcement happens on the exact same tick. Some spaghetti right there.
---
Runefest or Fyrefest?
---
I want to be on jagex's side and defend them but literally every tournament has something go wrong and it just turns to a shit show. And for what? The multifights are complete trash to watch and 1v1's don't even matter unless you got fed by a clan all week.
---
It's time to pause these tourneys and really overhaul the final hour at the least, if not the entire game mode.
---
This is the post I was looking for all
---
Along 
---
Yet people still keep funneling them money! 
---
OP is dumb for thinking we have to pick the biggest thing each month. Hell no. Just add to it each time something happens. 
---
How dare you speak of defiling his being????
---
Couldve made $2,000 spending that time working ü§£
---
Not necessary brother 
---
&gt;while meeting the technical criteria laid out in design docs and specs sheets
---
Killing 1/3 of players is not part of the technical criteria laid out. As a developer, you are absolutely expected to take a cursory look over the results of your code before sending it on to other people to spend tens to hundreds of hours testing your code. If you actually think 90% of development teams literally never check their code beyond making sure it compiles properly, you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
üëéüèº
---
You guys would have been giving them shit if they had done that too.
---
Same here man
---
So look you go tell them that this could be good. You say that while it was a monumental fuckup, this will bring in the attention, and lead to interview requests from some big names.
---
Now at those interviews they'll probably just want to make you look retarded, little do they know you're just super autistic. So you throw the entire QA team under the bus, and even a mod if one steps up. I'm talking you better fuck their world up. You present whatever cool shit you better have up your sleeve and bring the new improved QA team. You give a guarantee that this will never happen again in a money tournament. 
---
Either that or just blame Jed, I'm sure he had knowledge of how to do something like this, and he wants vengeance remember, we totally heard him say that.
---
Does the ring of wealth (i) need to have charges on it for the double clue scroll chance to take effect?  I've killed 100 or so hellhounds in the wild w/o a clue scroll drop and if I did my math right I should have had a 95% chance of getting one by now.
---
Hardcore also wtf
---
Jagex continues to be Jagex, but keep one upping themselves with fuck ups basically.
---
Just when their incompetency reaches all time highs and you think they cant get worse...they get worse BY FAR.
---
Ever notice how every single other Esport doesn't require the players to grind unhealthy amount of hours to be able to compete in their Esport tournament? It just simply isn't a viable thing to make an Esport no matter how much Jagex want it to be.
---
500k is a good start. But you'll find that its not enough for any good gear you need for end game content. Be careful not to spend it all on a whim. Its hard to make money with low amounts of cash. It takes money to make money.
---
I‚Äôm sure someone was paid very well and would bet whoever wrote the check benefitted as well.
---
dont hit stuff yo
---
Nordlord is the one I'm in. 
---
We just did a bandos run tonight, and we're fairly active.
---
Excellent idea
---
That poor lady
---
Everyone in the fally safe zone who got teleported to the DMM final area,[ insta died to the fog](https://clips.twitch.tv/WittyPrettiestChimpanzeeDatSheffy) and it then took 2 hours to actually get "half" back in and the tournament to continue.
---
You're absolutely right, I downplayed that earlier in my mind but clearly strategies change in changed circumstances. 
---
In your opinion what would be the best way for players to hold Jagex accountable for their mistakes?
---
Varrock med diary changed my life forever
---
a very what
---
*hairdresser fucks up and holds up a mirror*
---
Jagex: Not fucked up enough. More!
---
Spirit tree gang reporting in 
---
Crazy! With only 10hp too! 
---
Runescript
---
Sure thing boss, I'll get onto that right away!
---
But really, wrong thread. This thread is for players asking questions about the game, not for  suggestions.
---
But then hows he got the attack level? 
---
Paint.net is way better and easier to use imo
---
That number is going to be negative one of these days. 
---
Now moving on to skill specs what do you think
---
Bold move cotton let‚Äôs see if it pays off
---
what if its 100x xp rates? 
---
the pre reqs for mm1 give combat xp.
---
or gnomeball?

What happened to him?

ü¶Äü¶Ä FALADOR MASSACRE 2019 ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
At this point literally any other game. This is why I have such a hard time getting back into this game.
---
You should always use ultra compost when doing herb runs. It increases your yield more. And bad luck with losing 9 ranarrs consecutively. Can't imagine the odds of that.
---
I just woke up and it looks like the dump has commenced.
---
&gt; Nothing will be done again.
---
Nah something is being done which is why their fucks are always a surprise. 
---
That‚Äôs offensive to primates
---
For the next tournament make it so it works &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I like DMM 
---
I only had dreams of getting stuff I never thought I could get. D chain mainly. That was a long time ago. Only time I really get dreams now is on binaural beats or melatonin. If they are nightmares it involves things falling. Either me or meteors, or planes. Or another reoccurring one is where I can jump stupid high, and glide around town.
---
The whole week leading up to the finale produces a lot of fun content to watch IMO.  I love playing DMM because it is fun to come up with unique strategies every tourney / season and seeing what I can accomplish.  It allows me to play the game in a whole new way
---
Accurate 
---
The funfair? I could go for some ungodly fuckups during an internationally viewed livestream!
---
Where?
---
There already is one. Right click the wounded soldier.
---
Oh I didn't think about quest rewards. Damn I didn't realize it was enough to get that high. Thanks!
---
Its loads of fun
---
That‚Äôs just the nature of DMM  account deletion during the permadeath stage.
---
The main game is accessible for rollbacks, if needed, so you shouldn‚Äôt have any fear there.
---
Ootl, what happened in DMM?
---
What's the average value of barrows chests? I got the Mory hard diary, kill all brothers + 3 skeletons and am seeing a lot of chests only worth around 25k of mind/chaos runes. Is that normal?
---
All you have to do is put 2fa on your email and it's safe lol nobody does that though so that's how they get hacked it's always their fault lol
---
How about hitting a ruby bolt spec on a crab in raids
---
Throughout the clips of past DMMT I have noticed he goes off on a tangent, I‚Äôve actually been watching prior tourneys prior to this one starting and I got one thing to say: that man needs a new suit or at least a second one, I have been duped many times thinking I‚Äôm watching x tourney because Ian wears the same god dam suit lol. If I go away from my pc for a few min and clip ends and goes onto next and it‚Äôs from a diff tourney I‚Äôll watch it believing it‚Äôs the same clip because Ian is In the same suit lol. 
---
At that time they hoped to restore everyone at least with the 94 stats and items. Fell asleep so have to catch up what happened.
---
Yes, how it was handled definitely made them seem quite unprepared for anything to go wrong.
---
I felt bad for the commentators but that was very unprofessional how it was addressed. Chris Archie seemed to just make light of the situation and the hours of monotonous small talk and dead air really wasn't enjoyable.
---
Mean while me over here. Killing blues and wishing for the sweet embrace. 
---
haha
---
Half the people who died got the boot. They gave the other half got accounts reinstated and were given 94 base stats and some gear. For some reason they were only able to do that for half the people. Or they could just be lying and nobody got recovered.
---
(oof)
---
The rapier is the real item that is being fucked with, the thing is 100% at the whim of whatever group is marching it 
---
As a manager, he made the decision to not beta test. On top of that, a project manager should still be engrossed in the project they are managing. Just cause he isn‚Äôt coding doesn‚Äôt let him off he hook, it that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre implying. 
---
&gt;recent history 
---
I just dont understand how any company can fuck up so many times. I mean it's not even funny at this point.
---
Barrows has 6 brothers, but I do like the idea of a new twist on the barrows boss
---
They had to go look for him when there were supposed to be 16 players left but the counter was showing 17. He was [hiding in his PoH](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b7hsu6/the_technical_problem_was_cause_they_couldnt_find/) lmfao.
---
Possible glitch with Zuriels? I remember they wanted it to heal more on blood spells.
---
The only logical thing to do is change nothing and not test the next DMMT
---
Don't take this the wrong way, but it sounds like you've never really worked on a software project. It's really easy to say, "oh just rewrite the bad parts" but what that glosses over is that those bad parts aren't just sitting in one corner waiting to be nicely replaced with something else. They're tangled into the very fiber of the code. That's why they call it spaghetti code, because it's so twisted and tangled together that it's difficult, if not impossible to work on one part without touching all the other parts, and it's almost easier to scrap it and start fresh than it is to make significant changes. Making a change on this scale would likely involve stopping all other work on the game for potentially months, and at the end of all that they could potentially end up with something worse than what they started with. Not likely, but there's no real guarantees. Tech rewrites are an incredibly risky proposal, and they have to be carefully thought through. I'm not saying that it's not needed, because god knows their current engine might as well be made with wet tissue paper and balsa wood, but it's a massive undertaking, and it doesn't have a lot of user facing benefit so it's hard to justify. If there were no updates for 6 months but at the end of it a massive content release came out most players wouldn't mind. But six months with no updates only for one to come out with no content, just the devs saying "it's better now trust us", that doesn't usually get a great reaction.
---
I am a professional developer, though not in games, but there's enough similarities for me to be able to sympathise, and hopefully share some of that. 
---
they never learn lmao
---
That got what?

Sweet, I've been looking forward to more crab memes. We should just rename this subreddit Crabrave, make swampletics and torvesta the only admins, and only allow posts showing - torvesta memes (specifically the tree meme, all others will be held until deemed good enoigh), swampletics worship and pop culture rederences, rule34 runescape NPCs, crab memes and jagex hate.
---
This sub is like 5% good oc, 95% rehashed memes and toxicity now..
---
Are you implying devs actually play this game and understand it, let alone understand PVP?
---
Imagine still paying 11$ a month. and grinding away your life for DMM.
---
When you know damn well all of these tournaments, are rigged as shit?
---
He went undefeated (6-0) in the pvp tournament. Wonder if that was rigged also.
---
I knew there was more to it but I decided to make a bad joke of it. Thank you for filling me in! :)
---
It's also a requirement for piety and lunars so no one but the clan camping could get those 
---
That‚Äôs pretty broken tbh 
---
In B4 Jagex Fucks Up Castlewars.
---
what a legend
---
Indeed. 
---
Damn u can't even count lmao
---
I don‚Äôt know of anything that is actually easier on mobile than pc. But some things that arnt awful are woodcutting fishing slayer(if you are just afk meleeing) and any bank standing skill that involves width drawing x amount of items and combining them 
---
Annual? They fuck it up every time. 
---
They couldn‚Äôt because either they didn‚Äôt have any backups, or they didn‚Äôt have enough time to do it on the fly while they‚Äôre on stage streaming a major event lol
---
The correct move would be to delay the event and rollback if they had one), or at least taking time to process everyone the same way and the most fair as they can. But they couldn‚Äôt afford to do that and were told to make a split second decision 
---
Only if it's on weekends 
---
The issues weren‚Äôt their fault...  they were doing their best to fill the time.  Give them a break lol
---
Honestly, me too, but even just the subreddit is good enough for that.

Needs more artistic flair better cropped brainlet head and jagex logo replacing the double lightining in the collar.
---
Yeah it literally did
---
1 its not archie's fault
---
2 apologizing informally is always a bad idea for companies
---
3 definitely a bad idea for any employee of that company
---
I didn't play it and I'm salty, they have a right to be salty stop being a fuckwit.

Ash is the only good one of I remember correctly. His effort is superb.
---
Click once and mine forever 
---
pull ups are diapers?
---
No no no, you don't understand. Taxes. Bad. 
---
Why's it seem like everyday feels like an effort justifying still playing this game when all signs point to someone internally actively sabotaging the product.
---
Companies haven been known to do this especially in video game franchises that they need to put-down.
---
200iq idea,  stop fucking giving clans 'n shit free 20k and use that money to actually make a functional fucking tournament worthy of a 20k prize pool. Honestly, at this point, it'd be quicker to put the top 250 people in a hat and draw the top 6. That way, you're prized player base wouldnt have countless hours taken away from them because they decided to tune into an "esports ready" tournament 
---
y'all ever think about eatin em
---
Nice
---
Why are twitch clips always so shit on mobile absolutely never functions smoothly.
---
Just buy membership or grind for a bond like everyone else?
---
I'm a simple man, I see a community meme, I upvote it.
---
I'm pretty sure there are people who'd pay lots of money to be blasted by 20 cannons
---
Wait for Archie to tell us how successful this tournament was 
---
There's literally a crab boss in this game why didnt you choose metal gear Excalibur :( 
---
Ragnarok M any good? Lol im so lost on Mobile man I just want something fun to play on the road...
---
This is a Deadman Mode thread, not a Main thread post. Please refrain from giving them praise when this tournament is a fucking joke.
---
I quite enjoyed it. 
---
Neener neener boo boo you‚Äôll never catch us PKers
---
F I had no idea, I did finished the diary almost a year ago and I'm still top 3 poos
---
Wow i din't know that rs had that many snowflakes XD
---
The guy in the clip streams and switches fast as fuck live on stream too. He 1ticks 5 ways on stream all the time.
---
But everyone can do it with ::renderself and if they took that away, they could just use entity hider on RuneLite. So fair play I guess.
---
Only if it‚Äôs &lt;50% and even that would be generous. Maybe make it 40 ranged requirement and only available after completing all f2p quests(except maybe dragon slayer to cater to f2p pures)
---
he‚Äôs been through some shit
---
They are all scams.Always. If something seems too good to be true, or even remotely fair, it‚Äôs too good to be true. Scammers go as far as making fake RuneScape websites and advertisements just to obtain your log in credentials. Even most streams are just phishing streams. No content creator will quit on stream. I hope this helps. Do the stronghold of security.
---
Nah they care about having it look like they care. In reality, they're just putting on a act which isn't necessarily the worst thing a company could be doing. But it definitely isn't reassuring for future content or events. They like to portray this false reaction of 'oh I don't understand how this could of happened.' whenever something goes wrong. But in the same thought they'll start working on fixing the problem knowing they've already thought out how they will because most of the things they put out or host are never properly tested. They just do things and then fix it after it breaks rather than testing it before they release it. Like I said, it's not the worst thing for a company to be doing. But god damn if you're hosting live events like this get ready for people to see through your bullshit eventually. It's pretty hard to ignore the blood on the wall if you happen to see it every now and then. You can only ignore the obvious for so long. I'm personally fed up with them still acting just admit what you're doing and own it.
---
Just browse this subreddit for like 10 seconds
---
5Head :Wine: exquisite
---
Because it‚Äôs Chris Archie omegalul
---
Broooo, stop making so much sense. This ain't the subreddit for that.
---
I'm more worried about them destroying the game through woopsy Daisy fuck ups and driving the community away
---
Jagex would be paying us to play within a year. 
---
Like, in total? Less than 200 players even bothered to participate in the final hour?
---
What I think makes this all so much worse is that they don‚Äôt even say sorry. Just play it off like everything is fine. Stop ignoring the issue and own up to your actions. 
---
Can we just have a 2004 scape?
---
Exactly :)
---
You can toggle it using the orb or hold ctrl and click to run
---
Between F2P, bonds and simply not playing at all you don't *have* to pay them anything. 
---
You‚Äôre the man thank you for all the help I‚Äôm headed over there right now!! 
---
Just when I thought it was safe...you got me.
---
Jamie pull that shit up!
---
Yes. I think I have a post of it
---
If you consider being good at Runescape and being good at something like LoL to be on equal terms, then we just fundamentally disagree on this topic. LoL has a pretty much constantly evolving meta, where osrs pvp doesnt change alot over time, outside of a spec weapon here or there. 
---
When will I find where I fit in?
---
Your limiting factor with kills is most likely gonna be whether or not you can consistently skip Dawn‚Äôs orb phase. When I manage to out DPS the orbs, I can get sub 2:30 kills. So if you say 2:30 average with 8+ kill trips, you‚Äôre looking at 20+ kills per hour depending on how efficient your bank speed is. 
---
If ya don't cross him, he won't cross you.
---
I mean maybe someONE needs to be fired/position change like who runs the show or oversees everyones work (i dont know how jagex runs their business.) Idk I‚Äôm just sayin.
---
20k can easily change a life. New car, finish school, investments, down payment on a house ...
---
made it to top 17
---
No thank you
---
Wrath runes worth crafting to 99? Also should i get either crafting or construction cape before starting?
---
I‚Äôm all honest I can‚Äôt retort to this.
---
What is the fastest and also profitable 99?
---
I‚Äôm talking about specifically for the poison and falling crystals in cox. If you could just click away and hit F4 to turn off run and walk them out, it would help immensely 
---
They're gonna hire another DMM commentator after this great success no doubt.
---
Enlighten me
---
Well yea, if you on the other hand are fine with opting out any visual info about your character (outfit and health bar).
---
He‚Äôs getting paid to be on stage, May be salty but he‚Äôs still getting paid lol
---
They play for the prizes. The content, exposure and fun are just a bonus, they would've played just as much if there were none.

One of the companies biggest challenges, engine work. 
---
No. There was supposed to be a total of 256 final contestants to 1v1 bracket style until the end 1v1, but only 196 actually did because they ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt recover‚Äù the other ~60.
---
Skill Specs don't care.
---
He .akes more money streaming then whatever jagex gives him for playing on stage.
---
Pluss we all support him saying that, so he won't really be losing anything of value.
---
Fuck DMM, seriously. How are jagex this inept?
---
I‚Äôd vote for this. Maybe have it a 50-60 range requirement 
---
Set goals for yourself and work toward those goals. I was in your shoes until I got self conscious running around with a combat bracelet and set out to do RFD. I can give you a couple of my old ones.
---
* Skill Total. A lot of my early to mid game in OSRS was motivated mainly by wanting to get into skill total worlds, lol. Less competition at money makers and less cancer at the GE. I spend most of my time in 416 and am very close to 1750 total. I am unreasonably excited to see even less people at the GE.
---
* Farming. Like skill total, a lot of my mid game was dedicated to questing and skilling so I can get the items and teleports I need to do farm runs.
---
* [Recipe for Disaster](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Recipe_for_Disaster). If it looks intimidating, it really isn't. Don't knock it all out in one day (unless you want to) and take it one part at a time. First I got every skill pre-req, then I did every quest pre-req, *then* I did all of RFD in a couple of hours. Overall it took me about a week or two of on-and-off play.
---
* [Fire Cape](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/TzHaar_Fight_Cave). Teaches you PvM mechanics and rewards you with a fantastic cape. No more douchebags at the GE laughing at your ardy or obby cape. It should be noted that Jad is absolutely doable without a blowpipe, it just makes it faster.
---
* [All Hard Diaries](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Achievement_Diary#Hard). IMO, Easy and Medium Diaries are very easily achievable (but their rewards are great too!) Hard Diaries are where it starts to get more annoying, but where the rewards get way better. Right now I'm working on Fally Hard (only 70 slayer rn and ZMI is so fucking boring) for those noted giant mole drops and so I can start doing Giant Mole proper. I really want the mole pet, lol.
---
I would be fucking livid if I were one of the people not reset. 
---
I assume this not legal? What are the current rules on AHK in all aspects of the game?
---
Great ancient engine with minimal bugs?
---
The fuck blizzard game are you playing?

This hurts my soul.. they fucked over these players sooo fucking hard

Click away and then click om the run orb at the minimap. Or play with run off and if you need it use ctrl click or turn it on then. Or click one tile per gametick to walk if you have run turned on
---
how should fools have won ur delusional  manked got healed from 62 to 99 and when they teleported him later it was 6hp vs 60ish(should have been 24hp so he was still up)
---
challenge accepted
---
Expected crab rave
---
Every veteran had many helping hands, I‚Äôm glad I could be one along your journey through this game :)
---
&gt;How  do they insta kill him? They teleported to his location and smithed him
---
Yeah. They turned him into a bronze dagger and chucked his ass into lumbridge river.
---
11 dollars is the only meme I dont get here, someone help ya boy out ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
he was 62hp from blood barrage not 40 to 99 tho nice math
---
Lmao im glad i didint stay up to watch this shit.
---
Thinking this the whole time
---
It‚Äôs a bold strategy, cotton. Let‚Äôs see how it plays out 
---
I know people in the US who work retail entry level jobs (not managers) who make more than Jagex pays QA Testers. 
---
Shocking, people use money to buy things in real life? Someone get the fucking reporters.
---
poorfags coping that they have to spend the money they make from working 2 hours every month on runescape
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the only way to do it. I‚Äôm just saying the convenience of just being able to click away in game while tapping a F key would be a great optional addition to the F keys.. even adding quick prayer for an F key would be useful 
---
I'd prefer castle wars over any Jagex idea at this point.
---
Nobody is disputing that the attention / gaining viewers etc is good. Your way of thinking is backwards. He is doing the tournament for a chance to win $20k, and the attention/ gaining viewers is a nice bonus. 
---
Mind you, skillspecs used to cast the livestream, that‚Äôs way more recognition / advertisement for himself if he really wanted just that, but no, he actually wanted to be in the tournament for that chance to win. And him being fucked by jagex 4x is just hilarious but quiet wrong.

if you cant afford 6m a month you shouldnt be playing. 3-4 hours of vork and your set. I made a lvl 3 looter for when I'm afking on the main, averages 800k an hour lol 
---
That's more of a problem with the gamemode itself, the fact that in the end it comes down to a 1v1 seems to cause alot of problems for Deadman, clans having strategies where they try to block off other clans from content is good content, having clans need to gear 20-40 players it solves the whole issue with clans feeding gear. If jagex just decided to make Deadman mode actually clan man mode I think it would be a much more interesting competition in whole
---
In an effort to #FreeTorvesta, EVERYONE gets banned this season!
---
I love u
---
It's much more impressive when you consider literally everything in ape atoll has the chance to 1-hit him
---
Not true, it was just people in placed in the wrong thing while jagex was fixing it, they were moved later
---
I don't have a response to you. I just want to reaffirm what you've stated.
---
This is bull shit. The VAST MAJORITY of individuals entered into the 1v1 brackets were by chance. I was in a discord with several dozen people and we all reported our status in a text channel. Food left, bank, gear, everything. 
---
From our point of view, people were randomly selected to fight for spots in the 1v1. I wasn't in a super position but we had multiple individuals whom, from everyone's point of view, were fucked by RNG.
---
I've been a part of every DMMT since its origins, and this has been one of the worst. Random disqualifications after hundreds of people played 20 hours a week to qualify.
---
My account wasn't stacked but should have AT LEAST made it to the 1v1s. Several accounts that we fed WERE stacked and got fucked.
---
This has been the worst showing of a DMM "e-sports" tournament ever. Forget anything else that happened years ago. This was a shit show.
---
It really fucking sucks because I can't even confidently say that "we will all quit" or whatever. We're good at this. We got fucked. We've been fucked. Over and over. Jagex really has to seriously fix their shit. It is really, really, really fucking bad. Issues for every tournament ever.
---
Fix this. Please. We want to be competitive but every time we try we are fucked, beyond belief.
---
Also doesn't let other people speak, and trips over his words every sentence after which he'll go sorry sorry until daddy ayiza tells him it's okay. 
---
Damn riggers...

Thanks for agreeing with me in that it was still a fuck up.

---
To be fair many MOBA's require a lot of time input to actually become competitively good and a lot of studying to actually understand the meta that is constantly changing. Not to mention that they all are games based around teams that have to work super tight and controlled.
---
 However I do think Deadman Mode ***COULD*** fill a very open area in the ESPORTS arena, that being the idea of an endurance competition. While MOBA's can lost hours (My longest match of Dota 2 went well over the 2 hour range) Deadman Mode requires 10 hours a day of not only alertness but active decision making, however what it is lacking is that a majority of that time can be very dull compared to that scramble at the end. I think if there was a better presentation method (Team did a great job up there today but still), specifically a way to show some of the excitement that occurred during those streams many players do, that the format would really excel. I think the only way they could do that though was through community submitted clips and basically have the announcer team go over the clips before the final round.   
---
I think because OSRS DMM is so different than any other Esport out there right now they really have to think of a different way to present it that is engaging which is something they really lack right now. 
---
Ban streamers so they can't streamer another fucked up DMM for the rest of this world to see. 4D chess by Jagex if you ask me, after all only this echochamber is projecting this hard over a tournament. 
---
after recently fucking up every official tournament, I decided to up the ante. No customer support, no giving a fuck, but this time, i'm going to insta kill everyone in falador
---
Cambridge is so damn expensive too. What the hell. 
---
Riot, the company behind League of Legends, is majority owned by Tencent, a Chinese company...
---
Instead of making another DMM where gear is based on luck or clans, I think competitive castle wars should use players main accounts. Games would be made more interesting by enforcing limitations on how you can form your teams. Teams of 8 players
---
* 1 player limited to level 10 combat or under
---
* 1 player limited to level 40 combat or under
---
* 1 player can only use melee
---
* 1 player can only use ranged
---
* 1 player can only use magic
---
* 3 unrestricted players
---
When clans are at their prime they leave baddies in the singles to make it a bit easier, so a solo player wearing "rag" gear to try to trigger that response is very well played. 
---
Technically you will be losing some supplies to have the gear switches, but any strategy as a solo player is better than nothing given how prominent multi ancient bursting is as the end-game strategy of DMM.
---
**My Random thoughts on DMM/PvP, they probably make me look like a shitter so read below this with caution.**
---
I feel that's part of the problem, the mess that comes about from the 300+ damage ancient barrages people use to clear out their competition.
---
Disclaimer I don't participate in DMM, so that may be part of its charm that I am not getting, but if so I somehow feel that's a poor idea at charm. Charming mechanics shouldn't feel cheesy, bullshitty, or like it was out of your control.
---
At some point you almost want to say remove ancients and chinchompa's to make the final mega fight require some thought, but at what point do you remove everything that makes OSRS OSRS  to balance what is at the end of the day a bad game mode.
---
They tried to make last man standing and the community doesn't like it. They've been pushing DMM for 13 seasons and failed on over half of the tournaments in some form or another. Castle wars is experiencing the same problems DMM is on a much smaller scale.
---
Maybe they need to admit they have no actual idea how to design a player versus player environment and stop trying. Think about the games strengths, none of the minigames I discussed play at all to it's strengths.
---
CAH?

What a legend

wait a sec. imps were just gnomes with a special outfit? I can't handle this it's too funny.

You wont be a p-mod if you aim for it...

It would allow pures to do another part of rfd. Also Jagex shouldn't make changes just becuase you choose to limit your account. Its a good reward for many low/mid level accounts.

But you can get to that level playing five hours a day for years. You aren't required to nolife for a week to be competitive. Esports are moving into colleges, but I don't see how any Esports team could sanction a DMM event when that means skipping class for a week.

Content in Zeah for a fresh iron-man. I have been away for awhile, and I never really visited Zeah much. Is there any content I should be really working towards? Any spots for good xp, or just fun content in general? Thanks in advance, ps, no need to mention Wintertodt.

does spam clicking increase farming yield? Or am I crazy

That's hilarious. Some laughs just really capture the moment perfectly lol.

Do we though? Iirc when jagex' annual report got posted here, we saw it pretty much ran on sponsorships.

&gt;It counts as admitting guilt and will fuck you over

Saying sorry is not as admission of guilt in the UK, officially

you can bank at the deposit box on the northeast-most dock at port sarim, that's probably closest. If you want to make money as f2p, killing ogress shamans/warriors is probably going to be faster though

If they want to make RS into a proper Esports game they should be working more on Last man standing. That's a kind of game that could make it into the Esports. 
---
I mean they already did, there was fog in the 1 vs 1 zones for whatever reason and since  you die your character file gets deleted so it was a pain in the ass to do a exact rollback
---
DMM would be so cool if it werent for issues like this and the fact you're required to be in a clan to stand any sort of chance.

That's seriously so fucking broken.

People don't care about actual clicking skills. In Edgeville this person I thought was a beast of a granite maul speccer was exposed as a fraud and banned. He used granite maul instant spec script to spec people out perfectly every time.

You can always use runelite to remove the defense combat style. That way u will never be able to attack with defense.
---
If you have runelite it will say how many levels you can get before you officially level up your combat. Depending on the combat level you want achieve the highest in all skills possible.

Yes they did

The alternative I had in mind was a muddled combination of ignorance and apathy because they cannot recognize what‚Äôs wrong :( 
---
Major issues with fundamentals are more tangible for managers. Managers are going to sanction and enforce the solutions. Identifying a problem leads to targeting it with best practices and/or experimenting with OSRS specific solutions. Failing to identify the problem means additional steps aren‚Äôt solving problems as much as creating new ones, and without understanding why/hpow/the effects etc.

I still don't know what it is besides PvP, because all the information about it was in meme format.
---
I did it with 90 range 90 defence but i had like 1/2 my food left fighting galvek and i killed him and vorkath first attempt
---
Oh fuck i love it
---
Why did you grind it out in the first place then?
---
It's your own fault for investing time in this failure of a project in the first place. 
---
So DMM is a battle royal? With 1v1s at 128 people left? That‚Äôs a pretty unique thing. 
---
Reddit isn't generally fond of reality especially when it sides with jagex, but the simple truth is that dmm exists for one reason and one reason only: advertisement. Every streamer on the planet is streaming the same event for a few hours and it generates a lot of buzz around the game. This brings in new players and we consistently hit ridiculous player counts after tournaments regardless of how well they are actually run (admittedly utter shit). 
---
What it comes down to is that none of this actually matters and the mission is still accomplished, so even though the event is shit it still shouldn't be cancelled. It does its job. 
---
Its funny you talk about dick riding with WoWs dick so far up your ass its coming out your mouth. You think your opinion = fact. Its doesnt, grow the fuck up and realise that. 
---
come on now 07 reddit giving mods a break.. omegalul

P.s. I have got hacked the last 5 weeks. I had full dragon armor and a whip. when I logged in I was at the castle wars with no armor, no weapons and no bank. :(. I felt like i was drowning into the ground.

According to KempQ on Twitter nobody from Falador was able to get back, the half recovered was total BS.
---
Just so everyone knows, Q&amp;A is short for question and answer. QA is short for quality assurance (stuff like usability and bug testing).
---
&gt;If they're serious about considering this an E-sport, then they really need to invest in a proper rollback system. Even games that don't need it often, such as League of Legends (I've only ever seen one rollback in a professional League game, and it was just last season), have that precaution in case it's needed.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Considering the number of mess-ups encountered during the DMM final hour, it would certainly be a worthy investment. &gt;.&gt;
---
*To be completely fair*, league only got that system last year. And it was huge meme it didn't exist before. Also, it doesn't work every time (unsure why, maybe just teething issues).
---
That said, Runescape is a MMO. It's reallllyyyyyyyyyyyy fucking easy to back it up, 'cause everyone's state is just a database anyway. They should be doing backups at downtime. If no downtime, then backups before the event/contests/whatever start. No amount of crashes/fatal errors should break the game in this way unless something is present in the save state which is causing it.
---
I wasn't watching DMM what happend now?

#ü¶ÄSCRAP DMMü¶Ä

Apparently they only save account status at all on logout.

Mental, right?

Why downvote the man in an ask a question thread, despite what you think of the question itself 
---
If you right click on Varrock and then click cast it will take you to the centre without changing the left click option.

Yes but more importantly when they're standing on top of you so you know what to switch to

This guy seems to have grown up, appears way more mature. Good progression.

oooh thanks, didn't know that!

He likes fallout 76, it‚Äôs not his fault ok?

Claims to have 82 Slayer but 1k Abby demons??? Lol

If i fucked up this badly this often at work, people would be dead and I‚Äôd probably be in prison lol. 
---
It's entirely possible
---
I feel sorry for those who invested a weeks worth of playing in the tournament. 
---
You've been robbed of a weeks worth of your life by poor management and glitches during the final. 
---
Just make it so you can't heal off the dummy, just like you can't poison it with a dds.
---
Had to bake lots of wild pies for that whip.
---
Grats on having a placeholder.... wait no this isn't RS3. Grats on bank
---
Americans thinking they don't pay shitloads of taxes gets me ever time.
---
Who the fuck is sash?
---
Ah, ok. I'm playing through the rs3 quests now and I haven't done while guthix sleeps yet
---
No. If Jagex succeeded with the tournament, more players could've joined. Due to this failure, they'll receive lower ROI. 
---
But, the people who already play rs won't quit due to Jagex  up. They'll stick around, so it doesn't matter that much from Jagex's perspective.
---
he had no bank pin

 Did you ever hear the tragedy of Mod Ash, the Wise?

Nice, try out MM2 now.

70 - 80 Woodcutting requires 7,134 Yew Logs which is 2,411,292. So, no.

wait what? a jmod killed?
---
so did everybody not die or?
---
Lol what a shitshow
---
All I ask for\*
---
wdym?
---
but twitch chat found a way around it by making an account called free_torvesta and then @-ing him in chat 
---
they can't ban a username quote ;)
---
Quest rewards can get you started quick in almost all skills with basically no hard requirements.
---
I  blame jagex tho, the authenticator should avoid people getting a free pass if they get some information thats been leaked somewhere.  
---
if they can just switch it off, and ask for the username and reset password, then why the fuck would i use the authenticator?  
---
If its that easy to change the email you use for the account, with the authenticator still enabled, why doesnt it ask for the authenticator?
---
I fucked up my email security, and i still dont know how, because i changed my password 4 weeks ago and i have 2 step verification, dont have a keylogger etc.  
---
But just because my email got leaked, doesnt mean it should be this easy to reset my runescape account within minutes.
---
Have you ever competed in anything? It‚Äôs not about money.
---
Lol wait the regular world became dmm for a time? That‚Äôs hilarious I didn‚Äôt hear about that. 
---
AND PEOPLE STILL PAY THEM EVERY MONTH SO WHY WOULD THEY GIVR A FUCK? 
---
He's saying there were about 2 or 3 succesfull seasons, not that season 2 and 3 were
---
Please ELI5 what‚Äôs happened regarding people dying, 11 dollars, Falador???
---
Too many memes on this sub to make sense of the situation from an outsider perspective üò¨ I used to play Runescape about 10 years ago and that‚Äôs about it.
---
We kept telling them they're powerless against a pvp clan...

yeah fucking off to the oil sands doesn't sound fun.  plus half the province be laid off every time oil takes a shit.  nty

ü¶Äü¶Ä JAGEX IS POWERLESS IN THE QA DEPARTMENT ü¶Äü¶Ä

I mean, I probably will come next month. I did the last one. It's really not that hard. Getting upvotes is the main problem.

It's pretty average for a graduate developer.
---
this one got me rofl
---
If that‚Äôs the unimbued ring that would be the easiest upgrade to get. Only takes a few hours in nmz
---
Live in Sweden, I get 6 weeks. Minimum by law is 5 weeks.
---
They probably just teleported him to Falador 1v1 where he was smited by fog.
---
Exactly, I don't understand the criticism. When most everything on Ape Atoll can 1hit him, it's the only way.
---
How else would you make money in this game?

Don't you get ranged xp for hunting 4000?

What‚Äôs exactly happened at DMM this season? I missed it and now just catching up on everyone losing their shit here....
---
You will never get to that level playing 5 hours a day, maybe if you are a 1 in a million talent but for sure not an average person. The main difference is that other games have players salaried on teams so its their job to play, instead of taking time off your job/school to play for 1 week.
---
to people you lose it, to monsters i believe you keep it
---
I was legitimately confused and appalled when I saw how little the devs at Jagex were making. It's actually disgusting.
---
DMM, deadman mode: https://www.runescape.com/oldschool/deadman  
---
  
---
What you're seeing here is the final, 1v1 part of the tournament. It's a great watch when Jagex don't fuck it up (and a great watch when they do, too).
---
looool pet ronald mcdonald
---
This is exactly what I was thinking as well. How does this not have more upvotes?
---
The last 256 players remaining on the main land during the final hour of DMM get teleported to a 1v1 area. The guy tele'd out from that area
---
Something something global warming
---
&gt;	‚Äã
---
&gt;	so i think its time for players to get a refund, its not hard that to rollback 2 accounts right?
---
Rollbacks for single hackings will never happen. It would duplicate thousands of items each day. The best we can hope for is just more security features.
---
The Thanos kind 
---
all the people from falador. it was half the players.
---
I remember playing one back in the day and it was super fun, however I don‚Äôt know of any now. Care to share?
---
At best you have a job and you can def swing $11 a month and at worst you can beg your parents like we all did when we were kids. Membership is a whole new game, I would highly recommend if you‚Äôre enjoying f2p
---
this comment aged well
---
I think you can't use it because it's undead. Blood spells don't work on undead creatures IIRC.
---
They died.
---
Man this is pretty ridiculous, I mean I understand things like Woox tick eating could slip through QA pretty easily and bug abusers would get dealt with accordingly without disrupting the rest of the game too much, unlike accidentally wiping half of the remaining players
---
This is something that would show up if they simply tested the transfer from the final area to the 1v1 areas, seems like they didn't test that once unless something else went wrong
---
If they did a Monthly ¬£1000 tourney, it would literally be the best progressive teamed esport
---
How can anyone possibly rag on the man for using alts? It's part of the game mode for him. The coordination and effort and planning involved to pull theses quests off is incredible. Not to mention the fact that there are large portions of the time where the alts are just him managing 3 accounts at once to keep his HCIM alive. Anyone who doesn't respect that level of skill and effort is an idiot. Don't listen to the haters Rendi, what you're doing is amazing :)
---
I just saw a clip. He just got smitted by the gods when he was half way crossing the lumby bridge to the goblins. 
---
damn you got a rusty sword that blows
---
What was the january drama though?
---
Apparently, I have indeed been pwned. Sucks. I do indeed use Gmail but I'm an idiot and didn't have 2fa on until now. 
---
Gotta balance the best money making method in the game somehow.
---
Can't they just invent some new dev role which is a promotion? Only his title and salary would change. 
---
It wasn't even meant to get updates and now it's coming up tot he 150th quest

Thats kinda fucked. Aslong as we have a doctors note we guchi here in norway

Honestly though as someone who never participates in DMM these fuckups are much better entertainment
---
&gt; because their fuck ups effect such a small percentage of the player base.
---
You realize this year we had two roll backs because the tbow drop bug and the max cash stack upon death bug? These effect literally everyone.

DONT FREE TORVESTA

Gz dude! Aim for 99 slayer! Great way to train cb and make 500m on the way

Yeah gaining an advantage is *rude*

How did they eventually fix it? 
---
If you listen closely just before the end of the clip, you can hear him say "oh shit".
---
I agree. Watching a million people run around in a big clusterfuck followed by RNG 1v1s really isn't all that great, but something always fucking up and seeing the memes about it is.
---
yup. Like I said, it is not mine - saw it on Twitch just like you, laughed my ass off, so posted it here so that this gem doesn't get lost
---
Or use climbing boots for the +2 str bonus

With your stats I would go to the bounty hunter world north of edgeville and loot the wild for some starting cash. You can make about 200k/hr just looting ammo, potions, and food from the ground.

There's a reason you don't interview a fighter right after they've been KO'd.

It‚Äôs just a legal cover your arse jagex said. It‚Äôs safe. Just ensure that you download from runelite.net

IIRC he's already got a special title meaning he's independent to most of the tea.

Yes. It's the best Ironman series to date by a country mile. It's cinematic, exciting, original and so damn interesting.

Is song of the elves in may? Might as well add that too.

Our political situation is fucked and apparently ~50% of us like it that way.

If this happens it‚Äôd be nice to have different phases, like team 1 defends the flag while team 2 tries to cap it and vice versa, and then a ffa where both teams just go nuts trying to score and stop others from scoring.

Turn your private on bud, that way people can massage you in game. I'll be on in 1 hour.

Psych got dqed after he won a dmm over manked cuz he botted earlier
---
Wasn't that guy 1013? 
---
Jagex stated they were able to bring half the people back (no proof of that whatsoever) and everyone were reset to the same stats (and gear?)
---
So a lot of people remained dead and were not able to participate in 1v1's unfortunately. Jagex really fucked up again. Im not supporting this shitty company anymore.

grrr im serwious &gt;w&lt; I weally just wanna know what u finking!!! it legit question pls dew not make fun of meh!

If you dont sell virtual pixel money for real money please dont start, you wil only make the gold cheaper and the smart people have less profit.

Nice discord server mod boost, time to hack

because encouraging people to waste 10 hours a day on this game is a normal thing to do

How do we know he wasn't responsible for the glitch? I know he was responsible for designing previous fogs and took responsibility that time woox ate the fog out. 
---
Nice flair. I hate it. 
---
Jesus christ
---
I highly, HIGHLY doubt they would rig the game in that way. Jagex fucks up, but they rarely do genuinely corrupt things. Most likely a bug somehow triggered into thinking he won the fight. Regardless, it was caught and they had a rematch. Jagex knows they wouldn‚Äôt be able to get away with visibly rigging a match with 40k people watching. It was def just a bug.
---
He makes more money from the content streaming anyway, I don‚Äôt think many of the streamers think they‚Äôll win, its publicity for them though, and fresh content for them to stream
---
It is himself who is invisible. He used ::renderself to hide his own character and be able to see what gear the opponent switches to when his opponent freezes him and stands under him. 
---
This was a hilarious post in the midst of scrolling through massive drama
---
I hope you got the pet...
---
Im on Slayer lv 68 and it costs more than that I earn, because of prayer pots and food,
---
What am I doing wrong?
---
That is entirely possible lmao, not even that hard. There are plenty of people in this game that can do stuff like that.
---
This is why the game is going downhill. 
---
All resources are going into them trying to make deadman mode e sports. 
---
My opinion. Cansel deadman mode completely. Use the resources to improve what content they already have in-game. Fixing pvp, adding group ironman. The REAL updates players want. 
---
All this price money is going to clans or streamers who are already loaded. 
---
NANOMACHINES SON!

Learn to take a normal screen shot insted of screen picture ?

Exactly lmao, 4 way 1 tick barrage is very doable consistently.
---
I fucking hate the fact that I fucking love this sub. The biggest meme factory on Reddit.

I cant remember that far back but I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve fucked em all up. The first one i can remember was when the storm was smacking people for 30s and was way too strong.
---
Could someone light me in on what happened?
---
this could've been a good meme
---
You have to realise 99% of runescapers are shit pkers..
---
Its only a 4 way too lmao
---
No idea how you come to the conclusion he should have lost. He would have been 24? HP without the heal, his partner at 6. A rematch was more than fair, as they were both very easily 1 hittable. 
---
Claims to have created an advanced AI. Doesn‚Äôt know how basic bot detection works. Sounds legit

Always an option to safespot? Or just pray flick as best you can and use 2 pots a task, money comes soon from slayer 
---
Prayer flick, don't need an inventory of ppots every task, just bring one. Safe spot with range whenever you can, using broad bolts to save money. Use pineapple pizzas because they're 600gp, 22hp per invent slot. Get a herb sack so you can get more from your trips. Talking about herb sacks, do herb runs with farming between every task or two.

Oh and don't use a cannon, you'll break even at best with most things.

Lol why so rude? Got problems man?

Except you have zero idea what caused the bug. It‚Äôs easily possible that everything was fine during testing.

We pay for healthcare with taxes though. Outside the top unis grad salaries for computer science are low in the UK.

Cancel the whole tournament, what a joke
---
We have a winner

Capable pkers who have not only the apt, but the time and connections.

DMM is also good content for the hundreds of thousands that watch osrs videos without having to play the game. It's really a classic esports model where your top percentage of playerbase provides content for everyone else that doesn't have time to invest in the game on that level or simply isn't good enough. 
---
It's also a fucking shitshow, you could compare it to competitive fortnite tourneys in that regard. Your game simply isn't suited for esports but it's the current way to market a game to the right audiences.
---
How was he being rude you fucking baby
---
Yeah. While things like tile and tick system are outdated and limiting, a different engine would feel like a different game.
---
Don't do it, you'll get caught, just farm
---
&gt; I woke up this morning and went to the OSRS site thinking I would find a news post thoroughly explaining the mess that was yesterday's DMM tournament, instead they start the next season as if nothing happened.
---
They aren't ignoring it; the season newspost goes live right after the tournament ends and it was already pre-written. They don't work on  Sundays, so they weren't in the office to do a followup today. And like you said, they put out a tweet saying they'd address it on Monday when they are back in the office.
---
Anyway, I can agree with boycotting Deadman, but boycotting the main game seems kinda silly. If you stop doing Slayer or killing Vorkath, that won't show there is a problem with Deadman. But if you stop playing Deadman and watching the Tournament, that drop in players and viewers would be a clearer message.
---
Every single DMM tournament has been a mess.
---
Whether it's tons of people getting gassed by the fog, people being unable to get gassed  by the fog and as a result tick eating forever, rampant server ddosing, legitimate players being killed off by a JMod for "refusing" to fight because they were trading items around during the finals, players getting their IP leaked by a JMod which lead to ddosing which is still on-going for some players might I add, players being told where the finals will be held early by a JMod and so on.
---
Honestly, enough's enough. It's pretty clear DMM hasn't worked out a single time and less and less content creators are playing with each passing season as a result. The novelty from the original couple of seasons and tournaments are gone and we're only left with a game mode that's held together by popsicle sticks and chewing gum.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking once the whole muling and feeding because a public concern. I guess in the end it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily fix anything because either you kill people and don‚Äôt get the reward or you allow looting and instead clans will just kill teammates for bank :/
---
WoW classic servers releasing this summer btw
---
What will you do in the down time you have in farming while the plants grow? Tithe? 
---
4 less hours of resources getting into game? Very economy shattering
---
Why does it matter 
---
I think this was mostly an issue with the PM deciding the season didn't need a beta because so little had changed.
---
Maybe it's a lesson learned for him, but with the publicity they're getting over this (and let's be real, none of us hopeless addicts actually cancel our subscriptions because of incessant fuck-ups either) I'm worried it might not be.
---
2500 Sara brew drop

---
He's not the only one. I do feel that jagex should be told in a mature way how their screw ups have made the community feel... However the manner in which players do it is disgraceful and childish.
---
Also regarding the jed and reach fiascos, two idiots don't make a whole company idiotic. They have created the game that I'm assuming you play and enjoy?
---
It's almost as though people forget that they're a part of a game that has been meaningful throughout the majority of their childhoods. That in itself should warrant some respect, surely? 
---
Manked could very easily have been hit that 24. 
---
There are no 70% tax rates, so that's a straight up lie.
---
Second, how are you not paying taxes on 64'000 a year? I'm interested. The US census (2016) puts the median wage at 31k, and if you don't pay taxes, I assume 70%+ of the country doesn't, either? Or you have 7 children. 
---
Trust me, I know how much Tax US-Americans pay. I'm a US citizen myself. As an expat I should fork over 33% of my income to the US state. With deductions and all that percentage doesn't actually reduce all that much.
---
So I'm very curious how you pay no taxes on 64k/annum.
---
Man I loved Stealing Creation game

Maybe Ayiza is actually from the future and knew all of this was going to happen, so he came back in time and quit his job just in the nick of time to not have to deal with all this shit lmao.

Plz don‚Äôt level up attack and def
---
Such an angry comment! I didn't bother to watch the rest of the stream as I had wasted enough time on it, all the way up until the start of Alvie's 1v1 was already 3 hours of my time wasted. As for the 2 weeks of membership, you think I ask this for myself? I quit this game a long time ago and I only ask this for the players who came to enjoy the stream and got screwed over.
---
Also, I am at fault for deciding to watch the stream? If they had announced beforehand that they would mess up than yes it would be my fault for tuning in, but people cancel plans or what not to enjoy the show and it was an absolute time waste.
---
"Community management doesn't work on a sunday", I bet you they would have them work on a sunday if the servers would crash on such a 'sunday', causing them to lose money.

&gt; It would however mean that we can participate in a fun, safe PvP minigame which the game is lacking at the moment
---
You mean like Castle Wars, Clan Wars, LMS, Fight Pits, and technically Trouble Brewing. When the existing options are considered dead content, I don't think adding more will go as well as you think. Also, it is easy to ignore all the major issues with SC and just remember the fun parts...

You could tell he was hyped and somewhat nervous about saying the truth to thousands of people. Roasted Jagex pretty nicely, well done Jay

This
---
Did you mistake a Warhammer for a Fish?
---
Noice
---
Tbf, you can write a new engine that keeps those core things intact.
---
Things like having a hard limit on the number of items you can add to the game is a limitation that shouldn't exist anymore.
---
Players having desynced backups is also something that shouldn't happen ( trading issue during rollback ).
---
I would really enjoy if an oldschool version of stealing creation was added. The problem is that I would not like the rewards of the original sc to be in the game but at the same time nobody is gonna play it if the rewards suck.
---
Despite the actual dmm shitshows, it‚Äôs always been successful as a marketing tool
---
That's what a lot of people do, yea 
---
&gt; Idk, they just seem like honest people and it's not fair to them to receive all the shit they get from the people who post all these degrading memes just for some internet points.
---
Oh really? You REALLY think that with ALL of the massive fuck ups theyve had and complete and utter incompetency they have displayed MANY times over is something they shouldnt receive a ton of shit for? 
---
Everything short of the people who are getting particularly nasty with their complains, are 110% valid and legitimate complaints to have with this company, theyre a clown show and an embarrassment. 
---
&gt; This company has the power to stop polling changes if they wish.
---
HAHAHA no they dont. Thats legitimately one of their ONLY saving graces, if that didnt exist the game wouldnt be anywhere near the popularity it has right now. They stop that? Watch OSRS slowly crumble into a shell of its former self. Not to mention, that means you would trust THESE SAME PEOPLE to then have 100% autonomy on what to put in the game and what to fix and what not to. You really sure that would be a good idea for them given their vast ineptitude? 
---
Jesus christ we need a patreon for ash. He deserves so much more than this hell
---
The problem is not just with Deadman though, it is with Jagex. If people boycott DMM they will simply terminate it "because it wasn't sustainable" and then "focus their attention on the main game". Darkscape is a perfect example of this. 
---
Imagine a pharmaceutical company testing a certain shampoo on animals and to boycott them you stop buying this shampoo. However, you still buy their other products, doesn't make sense right.
---
does chris have a personality? 
---
It sure was brother!
---
Dude that mango looks good 
---
I can‚Äôt go digging up the past dawg, this yo quest now. 
---
Otherwise try google..
---
This may sound counterintuitive but sometimes complete rewrites make things worse. A system is developed throughout years and little edge cases and small bug fixes get added. To reverse engineer this is hell.
---
Its been tried before on other projects and doesn't really work out a lot of the time.
---
If they'd be able to build a sort of plugin system so they can modularize at least some code it would help I think. But that's easier said than done. 
---
They also coordinated a 1hit after the pause at gdz
---
The speculation was that the 94 base players were entirely composed of people that weren't actually killed off and just had lower stats than that during the Annakarl multi fight. Super conspiracy theory or whatever, but it's just hard to imagine that Mika, Skill Specs, Abdullah and Sparc Mac all happened to get caught by the impossible to recover their account bug.
---
Id collect those tears
---
They have done this before iirc
---
Imagine thinking everyone is american on the internet
---
Do def next. No balls
---
Did you get Pked at all?

Wtf do you even sleep

yeah, makes me wanna create a new account, realize that i have to do all quests again, then dump the new acc and continue playing on my main

---
I‚Äôm still not sure how many people actually remained dead and I feel like Jagex isn‚Äôt going to tell us. Archie said ‚Äúa few players‚Äù but I‚Äôve heard numerous people say that it‚Äôs more like half. And then Sparc Mac said like 90%.
---
nah not really, his combat is mage/range based so he can get like 50att lvls before another combat

Woox final boss
---
Welp boys, I‚Äôm about to move to Sweden. I get 2 Weeks vacation, 4 personal days and paid holidays in the U.S and I‚Äôm still better off then most of my friends.....
---
What's wrong with that honestly? We are moving up as a species and it's in part thanks to these nameless cogs.
---
For real, fuck Shipment. 
---
How dare people spend vacations doing what they enjoy 
---
not really
---
There is 5 account all with generated names and the only skill they have trained is agility. Ive been watching them and there actions and trust me they are bots.
---
Why
---
Oh you are so incredibly right I winced for jagex when I read that. Imo the only chance osrs has for a esports scene is castle wars. But like you said they would have to let it transpire naturally.
---
RS3 had something similar called Botany Bay. If someone got caught botting, they'd be teleported there. Then players could vote on what type of punishment they wanted for the bot.
---
The punishments were:
---
Crushing:¬†The Claw of Justice slams into the bot from above, crushing it.
---
Swallowing: The pillar the bot is standing on shakes, then an abyssal wyrm devours the pillar and the bot before subsiding into the¬†Abyss.
---
Deity:¬†A ring of symbols appears around the bot, then a ray of light shines on it. The bot floats into the light and is incinerated shortly thereafter, leaving only a few remnants.
---
its upsetting that people are still going to play dmm even though jagex have proven that they are incapable of hosting a successful tournament
---
Could just be Venezuelans?
---
kicking sand crabs with 99 strength is 45k xp/h?
---
The best thing you can do when you hear about something new to you, is to look it up on the wiki. Here's the link to info a bout Barrows equipment https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows_equipment
---
I should probably mention if you're not a member though you really don't have to worry about any of the stuff you listed.
---
As far as goals, quests are a good starting point to give you some direction until you find something you really want to do
---
JMods hate him,
---
Bronze dagger
---
Or obby maul
---
One of the members of the clan won the tournament, maybe it was all for nothing or perhaps not. 
---
Upvote if you just tried to do this with your ear.
---
He ate to 99
---
make them brimstone boots! theyre great
---
Funded from main/bought gp or entirely self made? 
---
Nice English.
---
If you fell for this, you likely didn‚Äôt lose much anyways. 
---
/r/theydidthemath 
---
what about inferno cape
---
Now that I think of it, the same fletching setup I use with AHK could be "legally" be used in pvp for up to 7 item swaps with just TWO KEYSTROKES, pressed consecutively for 7 times each after placing the  cursor on the first item (and not moving the mouse while on it)
---
I'm pretty sure this would be more of a handicap than a help in a real fight scenario...
---
Why would Venezuelans be training agility?
---
If Ash leaves, old school has no future. That guy is literally jagex‚Äôs saving grace.
---
Couldn't even take a screenshot in 2019? 
---
Sort of the reason I bought bonds through in-game currency. I think that means people bought the bond still but it means it's one less person purchasing it. I stopped playing a while ago though, mostly due to burning myself out. After this, I'm not sure if I want to come back. 
---
Only do tasks you can finish in a reasonable amount of time. Something like iron dragons take a long time, and steel dragons take forever to finish, even though those tasks are like 50 kills and under.
---
If you're not sure about something you can check the monster page on the wiki, a lot of them have strategy guides that list recommended levels and attack styles
---
&lt;/3
---
Because his opponent could have eaten? We weren't seeing their inventory so we didn't know how much they had in supplies. 
---
woodcutting is complete trash for gp. Find other methods.
---
BTW if you have runelite enable the gpu plug in and set draw distance to max, you should be able to click on the altar from the bank 
---
Your only allowed to use the ‚ÄúOur Lord and Savior‚Äù Meme for Milo Yiannopolous, the ultimate feminism destroyer bot. 
---
But good try though. 
---
they could post one the tournament pay 1 extra day for hotels for the people who came (coast under 10k)       
---
take their time and work on it for a day or even two meanwhile ve streamers do lms/cards against humanity etc       
---
assuring everyone no one will be left fucked unfairly       
---
looks like jagex doesn't care about dmm and they just want it done
---
Marks of grace for amalayse
---
pretty sure its 500k xp an hour
---
lmao
---
Seriously. Dont grind on day 1-5? Good luck existing in a season. 
---
Does the deadman seasonal have any effect on the final week/finals or is it just for fun.
---
With 73 farming and using 7 herb patches i make 60k-180k per trip depending on the yield of each plant or if 1 dies. Ill admit its not a ton of money but it nice for 5 mins of work if youre a low level.
---
Underappreciated meymay deserves top kekin' page for sure. 
---
B++ love it
---
nvm
---
just let him be, it'll only ruin his gameplay not yours. Anyone with huge banks and almost no pvm kc's is obviously a RWT or lucky staker
---
Your so wrong it‚Äôs not even funny lmao research before you start tell people false information 
---
Can't be bothered any longer. not even aware of a single status page. also more the likely absolutely frowned upon to advertise any private server minus their own here.
---
Or just use a dragon scimitar ring of wealth and amulet of glory and do anything else. 
---
The 5v5s in clan wars they did a few years ago was awesome.
---
An ank script for example could move your move then click multiple times all with one press of a button.
---
1 input per keystroke. 
---
Actually at some point I switched to Mika's stream, where he would occasionally switch to the osrs stream just to see the commentators irritate everyone by talking about dmm in general. I couldn't bear listening to all the nonsense so tuned in occasionally hoping the tournament would continue soon, so yeah, I might have missed the 10 seconds they spent on explaining the issue. You can pretend I'm the one complaining about wet plants but if me suggesting you should stop playing osrs is enough to make you so angry I feel sorry for you. You probably have to face the consequences of your addiction on a daily basis so I will not add up on your sorrows for the day. You can have the last word jagex-banana-rider!
---
I would love to see some sweet pvp morytania action :D
---
The thing is, with only PvP you'll get nowhere in OSRS. It's not flashy and you only have a few mechanics for strategic thinking. A game like League of Legends has 100s of champions, 1000s of different abilities which bring in millions of possible ways of killing your opponent, let alone 5v5 teamfights. Castle wars has more than just PvP. 
---
I mean it's Jagex, what else would you expect?
---
Yeah there was a winner from the clan Fools, I believe.
---
NMZ, quests, skilling, get thieving and agility up, get hunter up and do some bird house runs, and farm runs. And do some achievement diaries, shit just play the game. 
---
Ok thanks for the info. I know that the droprate is 1/512, I was just wondering if anybody on this subreddit had some numbers on when they got a black mask drop. I'm nearing on 1200 kc now, so I guess at this point I am just getting quite unlucky.
---
Runelite has a plug-in the gives a code to items on the ground. Bog tiles have been coded to be ground items. Walkable tiles have a different code than unwalkable ones.
---
For str xp without hp xp, maybe. But faster ways exist! (Blast pump, OC, pest control)
---
you can show what the are correct by enabling console to show value of every tile. i think it's 288 is safe and 289 is false. something like that, can't be bothered looking up the real numbers
---
It looks like Manked‚Äôs opponent was also reset to 99 on the same tick and Manked was
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
You know what they say, 14th times a charm
---
I guess you are right, there CAN be outliers I suppose but it‚Äôs the extreme. 
---
I mean yeah that was a good move on their part but I don't think the innocent players caught along with the atrocious subhuman trash were very enthusiastic about it
---
/s, just in case
---
That post is an embaressment...
---
DMM is a combination of both. It is basically like an ironman mode for the week with a bit of pvp risk element to make it more interesting.
---
I agree the barrage/chin area is boring, but I think its natural that viewership spikes towards the point where the winner is decided.
---
I assume your first paragraph was intended to agree with me.
---
I've only ever met one person that lives in the kind of apartments that cost that much, and they had a loaded family and no job.
---
Realistically with a salary like that, you would probably want to be looking at getting a house share with a few others, and paying around 6-7k a year for a double room. A reasonably priced small studio apartment is more like 10k a year.
---
Inferno and theater of blood are for sure
---
you know an antlion isn't actually an ant lion?

It doesn't *need* to be changed, it's just a constant 0 days.
---
Allan‚Äôs brother?
---
Players wont receive their rewards. Again.
---
They‚Äôve tried it before and the viewership was considerably lower than DMM. You can say you it is more interesting, but that doesn‚Äôt agree with viewership figures. RS PvP is just so slow paced that I cba to watch it personally.
---
Anti illegal immigrant*
---
&gt;kill the same mob for a full days shift
---
So basically the same as most RuneScape players?
---
Since when is this a thing?  Ridiculous
---
Yeah, it gets more views than anything else RS related apart from maybe ToB/inferno release.
---
Good to know that investors will never invest in this. This is so rigged rofl. 
---
Didn‚Äôt someone already do this?
---
Expansion of the old areas always makes my nostalgia tingle
---
H-what?
---
Looked to me like Manked‚Äôs opponent also got auto healed to 99 on the same tick that Manked did. So I think the rm was fair
---
Tbh they should figure out the other half of the players that were affected and host a 32k prize pool tournament just for them.
---
Pretty sure we remind jagex every single day more than once about the poor state of a lot of aspects of the game are in. Cue the crab memes ü¶Ä
---
And I can now leave reddit and play RuneScape for today. I have found the best comment of the day. 
---
Still half. Because the ones that got recovered got inferior stats and gear. Was 2 guys with maxed gear (arma, Vls everything) I know of that managed to get back in after the falador disaster. But then they now had 94 stats (from all 99) and way worse gear.
---
Hell no, we aren't supposed to do their job for them. Rather have them use the resources needed to pull this off to hire proper QA staff. 
---
Besides at this point they'd probably make ppl gain xp and items on their mains on the test world or something equally retarded
---
I did not share those details with anyone tho, when i recovered it afterwards i couldnt think of anyone knowing these questions
---
It's a sunday, they're all at home preparing for the lowest morale they've ever experienced next week
---
Still at fucking cows üòÇ
---
How did you leave either hp or strength at level 1 while leveling the other to 99?
---
Nobody really plays castle wars, let alone watches it so I don‚Äôt think I could say that with the same conviction as you. Its incredibly slow paced. RS should stick to what it does best which is risky pvp /pvm content. Many many games do a much more interesting version of capture the flag. 
---
event rpg has a way faster attack. that or slay staff (55 slayer) for atk training. (have an obby mauler)
---
But add pvp to temple treking. Maybe teams can randomly run into each other instead of the next trek.
---
Only morytania locked im pvp? Sounds exciting
---
Don‚Äôt you need to speak to Rat Burgess to change the location?
---
Wtf is bouncing from player to player the white orb
---
Holy crap that place is bigger than all of the rest of the dessert lol
---
lmao fucking yikes

The ignorance is strong here
---
RPG launcher, slayer staff (not applicable with this acc but w/e) and obby maul are all 1 atk DPs weapons 
---
Isn't that just the Nightmare Zone?

Yeah, made it a while back. Uses google translate api.
---
Nah, don't be dumb.

Nice! What us the rune beneath the wrath?
---
Your email is probably wrong. Authenticator emails and account login emails aren't necessarily the same.
---
If you increase the reward or incentive you can get people to play anything (Pest Control, Barbarian Assault, quests, Runecrafting).
---
But having to offer cash to get people to play Castle Wars is just admits it's neither boring or rewarding. And it would still get less viewers than DMM because it's an old game everyone has seen before... There's really no hype or surprise. The most hype thing is the mage splashes 3 freezes in a row and the flag runner drops a barricade... How is this garbage going to get more viewers than DMM?
---
A great new minigame for OSRS is the only real solution here. It's got hype and it needs to be created with enough objectives for viewers to get interested and excited over. 
---
I interpreted it as a play on fog abuse. Just makes the comment that much better
---
I almost missed the 5 min limit because i dont use twitter, got told by friends, still couldnt login though
---
It‚Äôs all subjective. Personally I think the recolored graceful looks awesome especially in the White. All of the ‚Äúskill‚Äù outfits are pretty lame fashion wise and personally I think graceful is the best looking out of all of them. 
---
One thing I know Jagex does is that they change up these values from time to time (not sure how often). They may do this more often with more common objects, trees for example. The reason why they do this is to prevent number macroing but there are ways around this by setting those objects as the names themselves, rather than going by specific object number. 
---
Thank you ! It was the cabbage tube that was used for the April Fools event in 2016 :) Once I made most of them I figured I should just finish up haha

First pet at 5 kc, first magic fang at 230+. I only came here to get a BP to start doing raids one day.

It's far from perfect and it really isn't that exciting to watch as people think it is, it would get dull very quickly.
---
That's pretty awesome
---
his original plan was to do 99 def first with chins/ bursts to unlock the obby armour and then do str
---
Thanks for the clip. That explains it. 
---
Unfortunately, this forced a tribrid meta even more and decreases the amount of likely competitors. 
---
2 people on stage got booted out you moron
---
I mean, a PvP temple treking could work like pushing the payload in Overwatch/Paladins
---
How?
---
Closer to two, I think

&gt;They should spend a few weeks without any updates

Any game mode that relies on *"i hope i don't get hit by an ice barrage/entangle spell"* is trash and is not entertaining to watch, and that goes for all of OSRS not just Castle Wars.
---
It is just an unfun and non-entertaining game mode i don't get why people push this as if it has any chance of being an e-sport when it's a barely passable CTF mode.

The winner would be whoever doesn't eventually DC.

Nice read, thank you for the insight! I've thought about it myself might have to try
---
Shut up.
---
Nothing to do with full time or being salaried. It is pro-rata. For example, in the UK, if you work 10 hours a week you will be entitled to around 60 hours holiday a year which is 6 weeks holiday.
---
holy shit
---
Focus on barrows gloves, they're a really good account goal because they're great gear and get you questing. They're not the same thing as barrows though, so look up recipe for disaster on the wiki and start going for that
---
Thank you, but I just tried out literally every other email I use and it still doesn't work
---
S Challenged and J1mmy are great 
---
Are you claiming that you don't think it's a good advert personally or that you don't think produces results? Cuz obviously neither you nor I have access to jagex's analytics on the subject but they keep doing it, so I would wager it works. 
---
A goal!! I will look into it. Thank you!
---
genuinly wouldn't be mad if they made mod ash the CEO of osrs/runescape i would even pay $12
---
If your a member, go do waterfall quest
---
The people who made it to 1v1 got insta killed by fog that shouldn‚Äôt have been there. Jagex had to give everyone some shit, generic gear and they gave people base 94 stats because at that stage of DMM, if you die your account gets deleted iirc so they had no way of giving the people back their gear. On top of all that, only half of the finalists could actually resume playing.
---
The clue scroll expansion is coming out this week and from what I hear, easy, medium and hard clues have a fair amount of spaghetti code. Get your predictions in early for what the fuck-up will be.
---
Good luck man, good read.
---
Haha thank you! They do look like little biscuits don‚Äôt they ? That would actually be a really cute idea to make ! I enjoy baking too so maybe I‚Äôll make some RuneScape cookies :)

1v1 DMM. Youtube it. Will explain it better than me.
---
Give the enemy crabs...
---
Mate you're giving me a headache. Stop smoking whatever you find down the back of the sofa, it's not doing you any favours.
---
I feel you on that one, I remember shaking like a madman trying to pray against Jad. I do think the target demographic changed to a more mature audience together with the playerbase, making it easier to figure things out (knowing how to use google and people making really good guides).
---
Pking is an entirely different ballpark, with quite a steep learning curve, but I can't really comment on that since I'm hardly a pker nowadays.
---
You can still use a separate runelite plugin to do it.

Im a new player with 70 att/str/def/range. Can you recommend me some bosses which are best to camp for gp? I have been doing barrows and its fun but i was wondering what other bosses i can do. I tried KBD but couldn't get more than 2 kills in a trip. And tried dagannoth rex, lost most of my food getting there but i got 3 kills, I think if i dont waste a ton of food on getting there i could get a lot more kills. Is Rex a good boss to farm? I can get 75 range afking crabs but i wont have enough gp to buy a blowpipe hence im looking for bosses to camp. Any advice is really appreciated! 
---
Would be rather exciting to see the entire game get wiped 
---
Yeah i used to do that in pre eoc. Just didnt like having to stop whatever i was doing every hour to run around for 5 minutes. I just prefer to pvm for money and then get into flow and just bust out like 8 hours of skilling without too many breaks
---
any time someone says life changing money anywhere on the fucking internet, there is some retard to do this odd flex. shut the fuck up dude. we get it. youre a big rich guy who wouldnt have his life impacted by 20k. 
---
it doesnt even matter the amount. it could be 5k or 5M some idiot would come along t say "ok bro yeah its a lot of money sure, but life changing?"
---
I understood that analogy very well. Thank you!
---
Who wouldnt watch a bunch of high profile streamers playing CW for $?
---
Wouldnt farming a Dragon Pickaxe have made more sense? Of course its heavily dependant on your combat stats
---
LMS was released over a year before pubg and fortnite though.
---
I have at least 60 banked now. I'm just really lazy when it comes to boring skills I can't afk. 
---
Not fun to watch and you don't have to spend a week shitting in buckets and eating ramen to minimize xp waste.
---
They also need to clearly establish disqualification parameters.
---
Manked was disqualified in the past for boxing yet was then let back into the tournament in secret and Ayiza was **told** not to say anything because they knew it would be a controversial decision after the praise they got for actually treating a content creator like every other participate. Not to mention he sat on his stream whining and talking immense shit about Jagex and the people who reported him for breaking the rules after he was initially fairly disqualified, showing extreme disrespect to the event.
---
Torvesta then gets disqualified on all of his accounts this tournament for muling, which seems slightly off as only the mule account should've been removed considering it had the stored wealth on it, rather than all of his accounts.
---
In any case, we need to either disqualify every account owned by the player or disqualifications should only apply to the account that broke the rule itself. Having gray areas will only lead to more controversy and complaints about certain players being treated unfairly compared to others.
---
At your level I would suggest focusing less on finding a boss you can do and more on generally improving your account. Barrows money improves a lot with hard Morytania diaries for instance, and Gargoyles are a mob that require 75 slayer but they are easy to kill and provide decent gp/h for how mindless the content is.
---
Ha that's weird. Welcome back! :)
---
Holy fuck
---
If ironmen truly stood alone, they would be completely in their own world. Couldn‚Äôt use friends chat. Couldn‚Äôt do shit like ToB, and so on. It‚Äôs not standing alone in the literal sense.
---
I would just throw out there that your woodcutting is so good that you could probably get 50 firemaking before getting membership, just to save you the time. It's not really any faster on p2p until you reach wintertodt at 50.
---
Tome though... Thats crazy good!
---
Don't worry about being overwhelmed, membership unlocks an absurd amount of content. Quests and easy achievement diaries are good goals to start. 
---
For some other goals/specific quests, here's a few more in no particular order. 
---
 ‚Ä¢ fremmenik trials for the helms (berzerker, Archer, and farseer are all great until you get some really high level stuff)
---
- fossil island unlocks birdhouse runs, a great way to passively train Hunter and get bird nests/tree seeds
---
 ‚Ä¢ fairy tale 1 and start 2 (don't need 2's reqs, just get to the part you can use fairy rings)
---
 ‚Ä¢ tree gnome village or whatever it is to unlock the spirit trees
---
 ‚Ä¢ ardougne easy diary for ardy cape (free tele to an altar that's close to a fairy ring and a spirit tree, really good for getting around for free)
---
 ‚Ä¢ monkey madness 1 to get a dragon scimitar
---
 ‚Ä¢ recipe for disaster gloves (get a combat bracelet until you can get adamant/mithril gloves)
---
 ‚Ä¢ underground pass for iban's blast (be sure to upgrade the staff).
---
 ‚Ä¢ dragon defender
---
A lot of these are ways to get around, as RuneScape is huge and easy/cheap transport makes the game a lot more enjoyable. And remember, these are all suggestions. Find out what you like doing in the game and set goals based around that. Have fun!
---
...why would I play a game (or part thereof) that's not supposed to be fun? That kinda defears the entire point.
---
That's fair 
---
It's his birthday
---
That sounds like the best time to spend the summer. Warmed by a big fire, maybe with a blanket and a nice book. You're living my dream, man

Castle Wars is an ok game. We've all got great memories of it.

But for Jagex's purposes of getting lots of views and generating hype to make OldSchool look like an awesome game, Castle Wars is a horrible option. 
---
Jagex could try CW if they really wanted to, but it is very likely that even DMMT with zero fixes would get more attention than CW. 
---
lmao sueing jagex, gl bro
---
In any multitude of ways? Runescape is completely server deterministic‚Äîall of your meaningful inputs go to the server, and the server works things out from there.  The only reason to use different ground objects is if the client *is supposed to* have some visual indication of the difference between tiles. See treasure trails  dig clues for an example of an extremely similar activity that doesn't use ground objects at all. 
---
This isn't an unavoidable problem. 
---
Put a ring on it.
---
This is my first time watching one of potato's vids, I thought the production value was good. Plenty accessible
---
If you need 2 step authenticator man... 
---
when did you 99 hitpoints? and how?
---
well it wasn't free, as you had to invest many hours into getting there, and dying legit vs dying to a bug is a big difference.
---
dag kings?

DMM: Hide-and-seek edition
---
Some people get a lot better than the average person is even capable of. Shroud does stuff in fps games that most people would think is inhuman.
---
People are good at games.
---
Ham and pineapple, a man of class.
---
It was only a suggestion. You will save yourself a lot of time and unlock a lot more content by doing the quest. 
---
That‚Äôs just one part of the game.., also they could make a similar minigame to castle wars rather than the failure that is DMM
---
I honestly think this makes a lot of sense. Even with a proper QA team finding all bugs is pretty difficult in a MMO. Some things however could of easily been tested by a small QA team. 
---
Perhaps to incentivize testing the new updates on this server Jagex could also provide a rewards system for people who spend X time on the server as well as something special for people that find bugs. I would suggest these rewards be purely cosmetic perhaps with a high end being similar to a skill cape after finding 5+ bugs that shows the number of bugs you‚Äôve found.

Where would have been the best place to chin range? Desert bandits?
---
What do you mean?+
---
&gt;This sub flames just about everyone who claims to have been hacked, blaming them for not being secure with their account, whilst simultaneously complaining that Jagex's account security is no good.
---
well it doesn't help that the last two highprofile 'security' threads turned out to be BS
---
like the first guy turned out just to be account sharing with his brother who kept claiming the account back
---
the second person got scammed when she tried to sell her name on scythe and claimed she got hacked instead in hopes of getting her name back
---
Yeah man, you should try restarting your PC
---
I got a rune pouch when I had a 5m bank, best early investment I made
---
This is completely irrelevant imo. If graceful didn't exist in current efficiencyscape, everyone would just be wearing whatever weight reducing gear they had and nothing else. It wouldn't look any less homogenized as the playerbase would still gravitate towards efficient gear for skilling
---
I think by making the game more aesthetically pleasing they might bring in a bigger crowd of people
---
well i always like giving players choices when making items or using
---
I mean this isn‚Äôt unique to graceful though... all BIS looks the same, at least with graceful there‚Äôs a color variety. I can appreciate not liking the graceful set design though. 
---
Still, didn't cost anything. In theory you could enter, play for 0 hours and still compete in the final hour if you really wanted to 
---
Ive been playing since october and you have higher runecrafting than me so gz
---
Well and the heads at jagex still seem to think they could salvage this absolute shitshow at This point here
---
They want so bad to be an esport, but fuck man, how after all these seasons they still can't get this shit right is beyond me, it's not even a complicated premise, but they just can't pull it off
---
Pay more a month than most people make an hour btw 
---
$1 1

how can you "think" you're having fun? if you think you're having fun, then you're just having fun.
---
I'm almost positive lms came out almost a year before both of those and I actually like watching it
---
New Alfie reaction meme is pretty cool
---
I didn‚Äôt see anything about why we didn‚Äôt get an episode this week. Is the grind just too big at this point to fit enough content into one week?
---
10/10 op meme sauce
---
This one time I was 4. A car crashed into the fence outside my house. It scared me and my Grandma was putting me to sleep. I thrashed and my Sippy Cup broke her nose. I didn‚Äôt really understand what was going on but I said ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù.
---
If a four year old can say sorry Jagex can too.
---
&lt;---- incase u wanna know how i was born
---
Seriously. Has anyone actually played more than two games of castle wars since 2008? 
---
I sure will dude, thanks for the tip :)
---
You can't compare USA salaries with UK. Especially programming
---
All people can make mistakes, not all people can learn from mistakes.
---
If you didn't immediately stop watching after they scammed 60+ players out of the final you're exactly why jagex will continue to run shitty e vents and fuxk up everyone
---
Eh, I'm having fun smithing away at the moment, but I'll definitely keep it in mind for later, thanks :)
---
What exactly didn‚Äôt I say in English?
---
Forgive me for being a noob, but isn't nightmare zone basically dominion tower?
---
There was no monetary entrance fee
---
By charging $11
---
Actually there was nothing. There was no fog in the outside world (outside of the cages) so he didnt need to waste any supplies. As a matter of fact, he bought a house and then teleported too it cause he thought they wouldnt find him. 
---
pdn is easier but it has nowhere near the functionality of gimp or photoshop. pdn is just deluxe ms paint. that's not a bad thing but that's what it is.
---
Personally, I believe the biggest factor that makes an e-sport popular is the viewers ability to say to themselves "wow, maybe I could be gifted at this game and be like them." Of course, most people eventually realize that they can't, but they still had the chance to play the same game the pro's play quickly, and at least learn to love and understand the game within that time. They didn't need best in slot gear, the most ideal stats, a huge list of quests to complete, a huge list of PvE dungeons to beat to get certain items, and in most cases a huge clan to back them up. Players need all those things to only then start practicing to become competitive. I think people would rather just download a game and feel like can rely on their skill, rather than a bunch of gear, stats, and eventually RNG. 
---
Yeah normally a doctors note is recommended. But if they know you're not abusing it they're fairly lenient on if you have one or not. If you're sick for a long period of time I'd suggest looking into short term medical leave if you have it. My company forces me to take at least 50% of my vacation time remaining before theyll allow me to take medical leave. Most employers are pretty lenient if they know you're not abusing it and are a good employee. 
---
Idk if I'm just super inefficient or if it's the time, but 99s are just out of my Range or feels like. Playing on/off for 14 years, back on solid for a year or so now
---
Just watch the livestream and you will see that people log back in. Pretty simple no one is posting about it on reddit because singles have been over for a long time now
---
You know, I really quite appreciate this piece of art. Well done friend!
---
Now this is art right here ladies and gents
---
I‚Äôm really lost on this. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. 
---
You have to get through 'bog' in Temple Trekking. That's also the reference.
---
Both are good
---
Wow, did he really say that?
---
Yeah, he posted a comment on YouTube and I think on twitter too that the next episode has 100hours of work in it, the episode after that 120 hours and then he'll be starting on a 500 hour temple trekking grind. (not 100% sure on the exact amounts, but that's too much work for 1 week). He'll be trying to keep it once every 2 weeks and working on special videos inbetween. 
---
big difference with NMZ is that it's limited to quest bosses, right?
---
I'd agree with you that the journey we as the viewers share with swampletics makes it the better series.
---
But in my humble opinion this video stands out as the single piece of superior content.
---
What‚Äôs your reason? Don‚Äôt use it if you don‚Äôt want to 
---
I had 3 serps and a magic fang before bp. I was fortunate enough to get a serp which made venom less aids.
---
Isn't graceful only really used for runecrafting, agility, some hunter, smithing and maybe farming? Thieving, mining, fishing, firemaking and woodcutting each have their own outfits and it doesn't matter when you wear for construction, herblore, crafting, fletching and cooking. I really don;t see the problem with people using weight reducing gear for when they need to run around a lot. 
---
Would that even be worth? At 99 Str, obby maul + Zerker necklace, you can probably get pretty solid 70k exp/hr at nmz/crabs.
---
1 rc tho yikes
---
To be fair, he did say games *like* those. Battle royale games have existed for a long time, and LMS was clearly an attempt at an osrs spinoff of those games.
---
CTF on the whole map would be to much tbh.
---
It was dumb of you to click on it regardless.
---
Hey.
---
You're scaring me.
---
Something to also add that hasn't been talked about:
---
There was no countdown until the fighting resumed at GDZ. It just went from 
---
&gt;The tournament has been paused, it will resume as soon as possible. 
---
Straght to 
---
&gt;"the tournament has been resumed"
---
During the 20 minutes the game was paused, Fools were able to take the time and add everyone who wasn't teamed with them. and 1 bang the highest levels the moment everything resumed
---
I can't believe they haven't hosted a real Castle Wars tournament yet, just to get some testing out.
---
I mean, almost every ironman breaks that within the first week of playing by rushing straight to Wintertodt which is a group boss
---
I love this series. It‚Äôs incredible the amount of shit he knows and can pull off in the game 
---
I just want a jmod to look into the account and tell me what happend, but theres no response on any platform
---
This gets brought up all the time. CW is clearly not interesting enough for the vast majority of the playerbase. It's that simple.
---
It's *settled* then 
---
Smart
---
I have a plan and I want to know if a) it works. b) It's actually a good plan and not some bad thing to waste my time  
---
So im 54 slayer and I'm about to hit 50 task streak, I'm combat 65 with melee 51, def 45, mage 59 and range 68. I was thinking I'm taking all my tasks at edgevile dungeon and I thought I should take my 50th task from the wildy slayer master for extra points. Does that work and if so is it worth it for me to do it?
---
Glough was quite easy for me due to darkbow, demonics were a bit of pain tho
---
When you didn't care about winning so you would sit underground and collapse the rocks on your teammates.
---
Must be pretty bad luck that half of the accounts were recovered and not a single personality/content creator happened to be on the lucky side of the coin. 
---
You're right, it's 4 items. For me the main suspicion is how it's flawless every time with a same tick barrage. Doesn't 100% confirm it but this is the clip  [https://clips.twitch.tv/BlightedOptimisticSandwichPicoMause](https://clips.twitch.tv/BlightedOptimisticSandwichPicoMause) 
---
Trident of seas or swamp? If it's swamp you just are not making money regardless
---
I was like why is it getting down voted they're right lol
---
You forgot the part where Jagex was using their unverified and effectively dead OSRS PvP Twitter account as a primary source for important notifications: [https://twitter.com/OSRSPvP/status/1112110521556316167](https://twitter.com/OSRSPvP/status/1112110521556316167)
---
If youre looking for money making, cave horrors and doing the clues is decent. If you're looking to get stats up, Slayer or questing
---
Are player owned house loading times affected by the number of rooms or the amount of built things inside the rooms? Or both? I remember seeing Ash tweet about it at some point but I can‚Äôt find the tweet and remember what he said about it
---
I love this 
---
&gt; [2019-03-30 21:53](https://twitter.com/OSRSPvP/status/1112110521556316167)
---
&gt; Update: affected players have five minutes to log in before the tournament is resumed
---
And then what an even FURTHER breeze defence will be after that, and then the breeze that will be Slayer with Max combats
---
To add to this. When they realised people were instakilled from falador, they stopped allowing people to actually die. So, they spawned at falador cage and sat there for hours. So, they actually didn't log anyone back in from the falador side. It's only the players who were lucky enough to be teleported last of the 128 and died a few seconds after the majority of players died.
---
It's the river Lum, why do you think they call it LumBridge? Fuck
---
Why pick out the sandal alone then why not say I hope you get less random uniques....
---
The way they made DMM makes people think that because it's turned so bad, but if Jagex actually put in the effort to make a great minigame it could compete easily with other Esports.
---
Besides, it's not like they're going to quit now. They're getting 40k-60k viewers with a half-assed game, imagine if they made a real one. 
---
Castle wars with non maxed gear would be fun
---
bandits in the desert, but you have to manipulate there aggression and use alt acc when chining.
---
Oh my god lol I feel like an ass for laughing but in this context that might just be the best thing I've ever seen. Bravo
---
This is really cool dude 
---
Win+Shift+S creates a new snip and saves it to your clipboard. A window will pop up where you can make edits and then copy it to your clipboard again, or you can just paste straight to reddit/imgur straight from there! I use this shortcut at least 15 times a day at work!
---
If you want slick high production value i HIGHLY recommend lumbridge chicken farm only ironman. 10 out of 10 would recommend to friend. 
---
Not joking, it exisits and is the best!
---
There are backups made fairly often, so we've not to worry lad. Unless, of course, everything breaks at jamgex HQ, then there could be cause for worry :v)
---
I'm not saying I was okay with it being a thing, but it was not nearly as bad as people made it out to be. Plus your hyperbole about the tbow is nowhere near what the Sara brew drop was
---
garuntee.. 
---
There was no cash prize for original DMM (W45) and it got thousands of viewers and lots of attention on YouTube. 
---
I really doubt that even 25% of players are wearing graceful at any given moment.
---
Amazing work
---
Again wrong. They're not there to kill JUST you. You literally have no conception of clan pking it's disgusting.
---
hes just a very accurate lvl 3
---
Which dev time? They didn't develope shit, otherwise it wouldn't be such a shitshow.
---
Played WoW until like 2011. The game may have had small, occasional bugs but they've never killed half the players during a PVP tourny, they never stopped from implementing basic features like having the damage splash on stacked enemies change color, forced people to make their own clients to utilize their GPU's, etc.
---
Like I said somewhere else, RS3 has a solid engine from what I can tell. Porting it over seems like it would be great, probably would have to tweak a lot but I don't imagine it would be as much work to get OSRS running in it than it was to build the engine from the ground up. My only worry is that idk if we would be able to use a lot of the features on things like RuneLite in the RS3 engine as a lot of the stuff isn't done clientside that would need to be for RL to have a lot of its features. 
---
Part time rent boy doesn‚Äôt really count as ‚Äúin the workplace‚Äù so let me know when you‚Äôre legally employed and we can continue your education.
---
Balancing is not the issue. Making it viewer-friendly is. The different floors make it very difficult to track where players are and what they're doing.
---
Jfc Jagex, this is rough
---
Also on the manked‚Äôs rematch his opponent started with no hp and no food, so they rematched once again iirc
---
It's got more standalone appeal, sure I get where you're coming from
---
70
---
I‚Äôm at 312 Sire KC with no unsired lol I feel your pain my man
---
no u
---
Graceful doesn't need a nerf because it actually doesn't do very much.  Boots of lightness/ Spottier Cape wont have the mediocre set effect but will more often than not put you under 0kg
---
Doesn‚Äôt make sense . Idk
---
While I agree KOTS brought some fresh air and was a fun gamemode to watch, I don't think doing the exact same thing over again would get the same effect.
---
&gt; fun and creative, relatively casual
---
Apart from the total level bracket which obviously promoted varied gameplay, the individual skills were mostly a monotonous grind of the same skill activity for hours. Doing this with max efficiency for 24 hours of in-game time on a temporary account is not something the average player would do. KOTS was more of a streamer event and iirc there weren't that many players who competed seriously in this.
---
&gt; still new territory
---
One of the most enjoying parts of KOTS was to watch how the meta was created from scratch and developed throughout the month. Which skills should you train, when, how and how long? Small improvements were made each day. If KOTS 2 were identical to KOTS 1, we would already have a farily established meta since we haven't got that much new low-mid level content since Nov 2017.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
What I want to see is kinda a hybrid between KOTS and DMMT. In the first part you have a limited amount of in-game time to train your stats, gather your gear, supplies etc. (4/12/24 hours categories instead of only 24h to make it more appealing for casual players). All players are ironmen and PvP is disabled. Then in the 2nd part you'll fight other contestants in 1v1s deathmatches with whatever gear &amp; stats you managed to accumulate during part 1.
---
https://i.redd.it/m2cj2g0klio21.png
---
Well I think it's clear that they don't actually invest much time into the game mode. So not really no. Just a waste of our time.
---
January: KONAR FOR FUCK'S SAKE
---
February: A boat, the Jagex goes oprah on our asses.
---
March: JAGEX FOR FUCK'S SAKE
---
You also forgot to mention the second time manked got randomly restored to 99hp and 94 prayer from a blood barrage mid fight. Went unnoticed and the fight continued
---
Nothing. Lmao they spent 3 hours trying to fix it, couldn‚Äôt, then just went forward.

Has Jagex ever actually said their intent with DMM is ESports and not just marketing?

I know the feeling man, so close to barrows gloves on my new account and feeling so good about getting to end game
---
Ouch. I haven't gotten any skills past 80 yet, but just thinking about it feels mentally painful. Good job, though. Especially considering that you're feeding yourself content by doing it, rather than someone like me on a normal account who's either just looking at efficiency or profit.

Good job, man.

This made my day feel complete

Your account looks pathetic

Maybe they should use that $20000 for actual coding and not spaghetti code that doesnt cause this shit
---
I learned what a roll meant last week
---
LULvesta
---
nightmare zone is only quest bosses
---
That's strangely erotic, i like it
---
I agree with motherlode mine pre second floor. I also agree with smithing and construction and prayer doing those methods. 
---
I'm not saying it's useless I just think people overstate how great the effect is and it's ridiculous to see people call for a nerf when their are very few cases in the game where the set effect even matters.
---
To play devil's advocate, time management could be considered a skill in an MMO context
---
A) You can use a different runelite plugin like the other commenter said
---
B) You can also compile runelite yourself and get access to the developer tools very easily. I did it myself by following a youtube guide it's no big deal (but you do need to recompile it after every update and idc about dev tools that much).
---
haven't heard anything about it
---
Imagine two whole levels in one hit though. Id cream myself. Twice. 
---
I guess it‚Äôs up to Torvesta to save DMM 
---
I wish they'd just implement a cosmetic system like rs3 and other mmos have where the gear that's shown isnt necessarily the gear that's worn. If it was only active in non pvp,  or even non combat situations I don't see how this would negatively affect the game.
---
Buuuut staminas do also kinda make it so you can wear whatever you want so I don't think it's a huge issue. Just annoying.
---
Ah the good old days of training fishing 
---
idk I've had really good fights where I hit 100% of my 3 way barrage 1 ticks. 4 is very tough for me, but there are  people who can hit 4 way barrages consistently.
---
Do ypu have any tutorial? Looks really cool.
---
I just really like bow and arrows in runescape so I had to do this to sustain arrows that are somewhat decent
---
I would have never done this on a normal account and that's exactly what makes me like Ironman so much! 
---
I mean it‚Äôs popular for a reason but ok
---
Thanks for the info
---
When will they learn
---
Not sure why your name reminds me of some pokemon 
---
It would be cool if there was like a competitive trouble brewing.

American healthcare is bust, I‚Äôll give you that, but any American CS company worth working for has healthcare options. 
---
So if I start at $85k (very high for my area, but my specialization and publications are really pulling weight), and I pay $300 a month for premium healthcare, I‚Äôm still making well over $60k after taxes and healthcare. That‚Äôs fresh out the gate with a bachelors degree. It‚Äôs even more with a graduate degree. Even if it‚Äôs a regular salary for my area, you‚Äôre still making $40k+ after taxes and healthcare. 
---
It sounds like UK salaries are decent with added benefits from gov services, but a CS graduate degree is hard af and warrants much more than what they pay over there. I don‚Äôt want universal healthcare for me, I want it for people who can‚Äôt afford healthcare. 
---
That would be another great series to follow!
---
Well if it was he'd actually be apologetic and wouldn't try to make a lame excuse saying "this just happens". He literally tried to reimburse the prize money out of his own pocket because he felt bad.
---
Oh of course! I truly think the sweets and stuff would be a bit of a stretch, but it‚Äôs funny how all these little items in game could actually translate into something fun, interesting and memorable IRL. All thats needed is talented people like yourself to make it happen :D 
---
IRL Clue scrolls could be really interesting, the possibilities with that idea is endless. :) It‚Äôs great how your post has sparked so many fun and interesting ideas. I‚Äôm really looking forward to any and all creations you might make in the future :D 
---
Because the amount of accounts being hacked isn't actually high. You just think it is because you see a post on the front page every few days. For example, even if every single day there was a new account hacking on the front page, it would only amount 365 hacked accounts per year. Which is extremely low when compared to the size of the player base.
---
Complaining about someone doesn't make them do a better job
---
What
---
I miss Kots streams for sure
---
I‚Äôm assuming he can‚Äôt NMZ properly due to quests completed. I mean 33 atk would be really helpful in accuracy for Crabs
---
That's where my confusion was. That's not really an issue if jagex was to do 5v5 teams. You pick and build your team. I assume the big streamers would all group up. And then you battle  it put March madness style.
---

---
I certainly remember doing the exact same. Simpler times:)
---
Crab rave ruined it
---
This video is actually pretty good production quality wise. It's near settled level for sure (but without settleds pleasant voice).
---
It depends if you are going for mr/games pay is generally lower. I imagine there is a gap between US and the UK. $45k sounds like a hell of a lot for an undergraduate.

Hey its me ur brother, C Engineer

I mean it's the start of a routine. Lol

Alright boys, eSport ready!

NMZ is quest bosses, the new priffidnas update is going to be regular bosses from my understanding.

He's right

I remember picking up 612 burnt lobsters at lumbridge bank on the first day of my account in feb 07. My friend was adamant that it would be worth something because of the quantity. Honestly, my ‚Äúbank sale‚Äù didn‚Äôt go to well...
---
nice
---
You're braver than I am.
---
I never thought about it that way, was the ever lasting fire there back in 07? I don‚Äôt remember it being so. I could be wrong though! :)
---
years of regret to come
---
As others have said they'd have to change it up a bunch. I'd personally start by banning any freeze spells. That goes for the regular game too. I know barrages in castle wars are supposed to be iconic and shit and there's a diary requirement based around it, but fuck me does it make the games boring. Same goes for barricades on the 2nd and 3rd floors. If you removed people's ability to do either of those things I think first, games would generally be higher scoring and not end in 0-0 draws a lot of the time, and second it might encourage people not to camp their own castle and play more offensively.
---
I think I'll start by going to wintertodt. From the guide I'm viewing, it looks like I'm best off if I go there before leveling HP whatsoever.
---
Make a few thousand more of the minds and fires so your bro can splash on rats in lummy to get that sweet 99mage.
---
If you dont have a defender, get one.
---
If you're going to Photoshop god Ash, at least provide him with an appropriate sausage. 
---
Yeah my bad, I thought it worked in a similar way to sigils; 1/256 for the boot drop table then 1/3 chance of rangers  
---
He can't use ancients or chins though. He cannoned to 99 then did blowpipe at PC for 99 hp
---
Yeah, I was a little confused when I watched his video today. I remember pretty early on in the stream a lot of people in chat were saying he had already died. Way before the falador massacre. I'm a relatively new viewer of his (someone here suggested him after torvesta got DQed), so this kind of rubs me the wrong way. He could have just told the truth and then talked about how fucked the tournament was because of jamflex's incompetence.
---
White 2h for Vesta Long price, i prefer the term investment
---
ü¶Ä ü¶Ä 11$ ü¶Ä ü¶Ä 
---
Yeah I was super suspicious of that instantly, but maybe donations on streams are common and this wasn't that unusual?
---
What does it look like now? 
---
That's the Twitter they use every DMM final and it was promoted routinely from the main OSRS twitter 
---
Yeah that's true. Only reason gmaul is so cheap is it's a sorta-rare-but-not-really drop from one of the most camped enemies in the game 
---
It‚Äôd be a great investment for the longevity of the game. They can‚Äôt keep patching over problems, that never works anywhere, for anything. You have to solve the root cause.
---
61 B)
---
It doesn't. Iirc, at least for herbs, you have three "lives" which are rolled at every herb you harvest. After the three misses, the patch runs out. Compost and farming level affect the odds of losing a life.
---
His dick is obviously larger than that. Come on man.
---
Because its old, offers no XP, and no valuable rewards in terms of cosmetics (halo sucks) or training (i.e. fighter torso). This is the era of efficient-scape. Gone are the days of just playing mini games for fun. People play minigames that have a purpose and once they fulfill that purpose they stop. This is with every minigame. Idk why you are acting like its CW specific. 
---
Second, my point was that you would need to alter CW to make it E-Sport appropriate. CW isn't good to go as is, however a lot of the problems DMM is undergoing would be better controlled if CW was the baseline. That's what I'm suggesting. 
---
Now what exactly are you bringing to the table here? Do you have an actual opinion? 
---
Loot from 10 hours of killing prostitutes
---
who is Woox?
---
legit most intense series out there atm. good work
---
Because it's not meant to give a huge advantage, it wouldn't be inline with the other cape perks.
---
If you‚Äôre referring to the point about Manked‚Äôs opponent using AHK, that was from a previous fight in top 128, and not Fweeze. 
---
It‚Äôd be really cool if they did like a varrock Vs. falador capture the flag or something &amp; disable teleports
---
Only thing I can think of is the cadava berry potion from Romeo and Juliet, but that's not a teleport
---
People who disagree with him being called a white supremacist are either white supremacists themselves or confused moderates, which one are you?
---
I don't get the crab rave meme, why is it so popular on OSRS?
---
2 weeks of free membership and they don't have to qualify for the next tournament, so they can grind 120 hours for a fuck up like this again :)
---
Were you botting?
---
The normal dmm doesn't reset all the time tho.
---
settled in there lol'ing as well
---
As I'm not much into DMM myself, that might actually explain why I didn't hear anything about those seasons, oops.
---
I mean, RoT certainly got *attention* on this subreddit - negative attention, surely, but front page posts nonetheless. Whoops
---
Q do any of yall know when the rework is coming?
---
You know if you hate politics so much you can just not give posts about it your attention? Singling out a random political comment with no upvotes and replying to it probably isn't the best use of your time if you're trying to get away from politics.
---
Rather impressive...
---
The game team had a pretty massive fuckup, I'd sure hope EVERYONE is there working on stuff like this. Not really praise worthy behavior, there's a lot of backlash and an obligation to fix this.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b7igdi/dmm_skillspecs_fires_off_at_archie/
---
I agree. Players need to see the way other dev's handle different games. OSRS has by far the best community involvement of any game I've ever heard of. They've fought to avoid MTX and other predatory practices as well.
---
Unlike Skilling and PVM content, PVP is, and always will be, extremely difficult to create content for. The playerbase is extremely opinionated about the subject and that makes it difficult to please everybody.
---
Lack of QA is a significant issue, but they definitely don't deserve all the hate over a game. It's just a game and if you can sit back and laugh about the nonsense then you're probably enjoying it properly. If you're not having fun playing a game, stop playing. If we all love OSRS as much as we claim to, then I'd say it's not as bad as we seem to make it with all the memes.
---
Yeah we're gonna need some proof for this.
---
Can't be judging a guy off of what anyone posts on reddit.
---
Could add like a faction system in. Each faction can be under the gods or somthing along those lines. You can earn points for you faction by participating in Clan wars and Castle wars, maybe even wildy. At the end of a set time the winning faction gets rewarded and each player gets a reward. Maybe like a % like wintertodt or rewarded based on participation during the set time? I dont know just an idea you got me thinking about.
---
Dank ass anatomy my dude
---
Yeah we've all been there, my btw went like 80 dry for anything with a use, and then it took me 804 chests to get an ahrim's skirt.
---
I don't know whether he made it there or not, but the disconnects at least appear to be real. He mentioned on his stream he was getting hit offline all day and his stream itself was repeatedly going down every 30 minutes or so, so unless he's manually shutting off his stream every time and it's part of some elaborate ruse to try and make himself look like a victim, I think the disconnection part was at least legitimate.
---
He honestly sounded like he was on the verge of a mental breakdown during the stream after everyone got gassed by the fog and many of the people watching were concerned with his well-being as a result.
---
If this is true, he could have spoken about it without lying. But I guess you and others don't mind being lied to, and creators shouldn't be held to a standard

that's reddit as a whole for ya, it isn't limited to r/2007scape.

the fact that this has 1.4k upvotes proves how stupid the osrs community really is
---
It‚Äôs a rune that jagex thought about implementing back in classic (iirc) and was added to the game files but never actually released. If you google life rune you should be able to find the sprite.
---
Not trying to be rude, but what *I* see, is that he doesn‚Äôt do much. I don‚Äôt see him doing anything, pvp could thrive so much more, but whoever is in charge of it doesn‚Äôt seem to care.
---
I likes him when he was making videos, but really, I don‚Äôt see much passion from him anymore

Hope you can shead some light as I‚Äôm an outsider looking into his job where I don‚Äôt know much, just from what I see on the q&amp;A

And I promise you that if they cut the update schedule IN HALF and spent the extra time on QC so they didn't constantly fuck things up they'd get a lot less shit from their community.

My first 99.

Axe is right there, see, I drew it with a third-age marker

They give everyone affected 94 base stats? More like 87 base stats

Hey man how did you get 99 range?

Other than they ask for info that the normal website wouldn't and common sense says never to enter security info after following a random link.

I saw someone say this was an in-game feature, ::renderself or something. Which I guess is allowed but man does it make it look bad. His opponent was just fighting someone invisible and no one has a clue what's going on
---
Jagex commissioned this piece of fantastic art to be put up on Reddit to distract from DMM drama 
---
Need help figuring out some fletching numbers.   I want to get 75 fletching.  Currently like 34 but that is 20k xp so whatever.   
---
Would 16k be enough xp for 75?   75 is around 1.2mxp.  I'm buying arrow heads so trying to get something efficient for uim.  This seems like a fast method 
---
aah I keep finding you!
---
What you could do instead is train to 75 combat at crabs, then take your 50th task from konar, which would give you 270 points versus 60 points if you use vannaka (edgeville sewer guy)
---
Protip for anyone bursting anything, use bronze knives.
---
Okay that is weird too haha. I have no idea how I would have had smithing xp before this lmao 
---
I love this so much

Anyone have a clip of what Skill Specs said? 
---
Because 1 in 100 of you forget yo bank runes and are running around with 1-10k+ natures etc

---
He had 53 HP (hit "Lucky 25") on the guy in full melee tank gear which healed him to 99hp (+46 hp healed).
---
Blood barrage means 25% of dmg dealt comes back as hp, so +50% zuriel bonus is... 75% hp back?  its still under 100% which is 25hp and seems broken.
---
But prayer also went from 46 to 94 WTF - this is not described in Wiki.
---
Either shits rigged HARD or wiki is not up to date. No way 1x opponent should've healed him so much.
---
No one wants to watch this extremely boring content. Player vs player on the other hand attracts huge numbers of viewers and that's why it is important for it to continue. 
---
Maybe learn from your mistakes and not set a fake email as your recovery email on your new account
---
I'm out of the loop.  What happened this time?
---
This applies to all mods, not just Ash. 
---
Its just fun to kill people
---
yeah but I have a personal opinion and want jagex to change it cuz of my opinion
---
There has been drama nearly every single tournament, yet the viewer count has gone up. 
---
Selling ultra rare Scorpians 
---
Because.. nobody actually wants to learn/practice castle wars... and nobody really wants to watch it....
---
Castle wars is super niche, the competitive community is small. No popular content creators will want to learn how to properly play CW (which makes DMM popular), and thats probably because of the reasons i mentioned above
---
I believe it might be slower but I‚Äôm not completely sure. I think there‚Äôs a way to do it with qpc and tai bwo wannai scrolls also. 
---
Too true

guthan being thicc af is an underappreciated aspect of the lore, i'm glad someone noticed

Yes i realise that was not the smartest move because i thought i wouldnt use the account for more then merching so i just used a troll mail, but do u know anything i can do?
---
Pineapple diesn't belong on pizza.
---
The best e sports competition osrs ever had was the rot pvp tournament. 
---
*Get ~5 kills per world hop.
---
Who caaaares dude, the whole tourney was a fuckfest, one guy lieing and getting in literally makes 0 difference.
---
Like I said you can learn from your mistakes on the new account you make
---
If you wanna properly edit this, what he would do is he would get 99 defense through chinning and/or barraging, which would be decent xp/hr, and then he could wear full bandos and all armour he wanted while training strength, which is more xp/hr than his current setup.
---
Nah I respect fish more than that 
---
You make it sound so easy... in practice, most IT companies don't spend any more money on fixing problems than they absolutely have to. OSRS isn't crashing every 5 minutes and it's making tons of money from subscriptions so why fix it?
---
Another problem that is specific to Jagex is that they make their own development tools. It means that every new developer has to spend some time, possibly weeks or even months, learning to use them before they can do any useful work. And many developers prefer companies that use industry-standard tools so they can put that on their resume.
---
Commentators did a great job at holding down the fort.
---
I agree. Best money maker without the threat of danger would be unbalanced. The wildy can produce GP instead of moving it from one player to another. It sucks to get killed doing non-pvp stuff in the wild but that‚Äôs how you balance things like wildy slayer and revs. Otherwise it would be ridiculous.
---
This is what happens when you make your whole life about a single game....
---
low effort bait

hes obv not serious

So that was you, huh?

That‚Äôs awesome! I got lucky with a couple of items too

Oh, DO YA!?

double clicked his quick prayers again Pog

?
---
I fucking love this
---
Yeah he reached a point where weekly episodes are impractical if we want them to have any meat to them, this was always bound to happen and he‚Äôs still working hard so we‚Äôre going to get less; but better quality videos so with a little patience we win in the end.

I've done that but still nothing has came of it sadly.

That‚Äôs insane, I never get lucky with my 10k scythe offer 
---
Yes, yes they do. I can also confirm I have only managed to kill Jad on task. What you are saying is true for Inferno only. 
---
Eh? I know not of who you are lmao and so I assume nothing regarding you :) 
---
Not just b0aty
---
And we have no idea why these errors happened to say it was because of the engine is a huge leap. More likely it was a mistake in the new code by whoever was working on it.
---
They cry on reddit when they enter the wilderness and die, the game should be more clear about entering a pvp area I guess
---
How that will increase xp for my account
---
Thanks. Since DMM went past 1 am Cambridge time everyone was getting tired and it was hard to tell what he was saying.
---
Stake it all. Jk dont do that
---
Last man standing is dope, I never played and don‚Äôt play rs for years now but have always watched LMS streams / videos. It‚Äôs one of those things like castle wars, never gets old. Sadly in today‚Äôs RuneScape gameplay people don‚Äôt play castle wars like back in the day due to the mentality of xp/ hr and losing xp by standing or playing a game...
---
Oh The nostalgia back in the day 
---
I've already hacked onto the main frame and have his, his mother's, and his grandma's account details.
---
How many people actually care about DMM? 100, 200? The stream gets views because Jagex fuck it up so bad every year. 
---
DMM is a terrible idea for eSports. With CW people could actually form teams like every other eSports and play competitively. I don‚Äôt know why you think the only people that will watch that are the 20 people currently playing CW. I‚Äôm so sure more people would be interested in watching competitive CW than shitty DMM.
---
My goal is 5.5k rune platelegs while I‚Äôm training Runecrafting, since I have 99 Mining and Smithing... 
---
After that I can afford some good gear for pvm...
---
ok?..
---
&gt;until everyone's at that max potential
---
Just give up now gamers; everyone's gonna just going to "play perfectly" 
---
When did the Minigame shop poll pass? I'd love if we could play games like Castle Wars as an alternative to the NMZ which seems pulled straight out of a private server from 2008.
---
The ones who get scammed in rs are the ones who will grow old and give the Nigerian prince all of their savings.

I took a nap while waiting for 1v1s to start and by the time I woke up they still hadn‚Äôt started.

Hey its me, Jagex. Please describe the bug to me.
---
Isn‚Äôt the sky black 
---
This would still be like being in single combat against a giant clan. The numbers will still always win
---
Left out a vital thing that happened. Skill specs was invited once again, and once again got jagex‚Äôd. .4x he must be super unlucky. lol.
---
In all fairness he used to cast, and don‚Äôt know his reasonings for stopping that but he should‚Äôve never stopped. He would‚Äôve had more recognition / fame from casting as him entering the tourney was just a complete waste of time. He would‚Äôve had the same effect if he played the tourney for viewers etc but just casted instead like before as a caster is the fave of the dmm tourney essentially .

Since I started playing in 5th grade I‚Äôve never gone into the wildy without knowing the risks. I think the ditch is good enough, people just don‚Äôt pay attention.

You could mine like 4 coal in the time it takes to kill Cerb 4 times so I think it's fairly balanced
---
How did skill specs die? If it was from the fog than I would say he's being pretty tame.

If this doesn‚Äôt get liked you can say it‚Äôs hawaii on a world reddit lol.

It is still funny though. If you safe a lot and bail if you run into any trouble instead of trying to tank there's only a handful of bosses that have any chance of getting you. Otherwise you'll basically only die if you DC or get lazy.

All of these bingo charts should have a freebee deadman mode drama

Very interesting to compare the numbers on this post vs r/Runescape
---
What no they‚Äôre not... they‚Äôre 1/512 for a specific and 1/256 to roll a unique. 
---
The majority of people who actually participate in PvP do not want to play Castle Wars. It gets really boring, sorry. Nothing wrong with a separate tournament but not as a replacement for DMM. 
---
DMM is a week of content, with a finale that pulls in tens of thousands of players. It is successful at advertisement, but needs to be polished. 
---
What they need to do is have only two DMM tournaments per year, and replace the other two DMM tournaments with 1v1 tournaments accessible to all players. 
---
if you think this was bad wait to see their next one
---
Everyone is in here pretending that CW can't be competitive because it's boring in its current state, unbalanced in its current state, no one plays it therefore it wouldn't be received well by the community...
---
CW isn't played today because there are no rewards for 99% of players, the worlds are full of leachers, the mechanics suck, and the actual PvP is dominated by ancients. The game is old as shit and hasn't seen any rebalancing or updating for 10+ years.
---
If Jagex spent the same amount of time devving and playtesting a rebalanced CWars designed for a legitimate competitive scene I think people would be surprised at how cool it would end up.
---
1. It's likely that the map would have to be resized for specific group sizes.
---
2. Allow players to wear helms and capes, demark them in a different way.
---
3. Create a 'point buy' system where you can buy gear and/or combat levels (ie CW would be completely separate from your in-game levels and gear). Essentially even the playing field for players who haven't put 1000 hours into the game. Make it interesting by forcing players to choose specific builds. It would work the same for inventories.
---
4. Fix and change current metas which make the game boring for viewers and players (ie barricade mechanics).
---
I'm not saying this is easy. I'm saying it's possible and if Jagex follows the same premise used by hundreds of other games they could create a legitimate competitive scene within the game.
---
Do stronghold of security in barbarian village, you‚Äôll get 10k cash at the end
---
Make fashionscape great again
---
This dick says otherwise 
---
We really are messing with the natural ecosystem there. 
---
As a kid I fished lobsters at catherby and would get a full inventory, walk to the bank, and sell the inventory for 13k. Thought I was balling
---
&gt;The tournament started at 7:30PM UK time and finished at 2:30AM.
---
Note that daylight savings time kicked in so the clocks went forward an hour. So it would've ended at 1:30am had the clocks not changed. Regardless, still crazy long.
---
Okay, so it's game breaking, or at the very least, extremely advantageous if the 5% applied to runite ore. But it's 5%, meaning 1 out of every 20 runite ore you mine could potentially not deplete. So roughly about, 1 of the runite you mine in a whole inventory is given to you for "free". Considering runite takes on average 90 seconds to mine with a 12 minute respawn timer per rock, it's about 40 ore per hour giving a ge average of 11,249gp one could potentially make 450k/hr. If the perk is attached to runite ore, you could potentially get 2 more ore per hour making it 470k/hour. Logically... I can see an "advantage" but... I'm not even sure this is a statistically significant advantage -less a "huge" advantage
---
Gotta use the glassblowing pipe!
---
Make it a poll
---
They're not about to waste their time on CW when they can just keep running Drama Man Mode. CW will surely get less attention than Drama Man Mode.
---
So many people just wondering why Jagex won't pick up a mith scimitar when they've got a dragon scimitar in their hands. They should really just get a whip already. 
---
"just use a new engine L0L"
---
No problemo, you‚Äôre a lucky guy rn. Use it wisely haha.
---
Let it flow through you...

Manked is apart of Blazers, and Blazers were teamed with Fools the entire tournament.

Is this an original piece? Would you sell it?

I really like the fact the desert actually feels like a desert, I think it would lose a lot of its charm if you encountered something interesting  without first trekking through the barren sands.
---
ayiza wasn't happy about them runecrafting comments 
---
I mean making rune items with 99 smithing is one of the best F2P money makers, obviously having 99 smithing in F2P is unlikely. Best options are killing ogresses, or flipping.
---
Build a f2p pker! It‚Äôs best place to learn, and requires the lowest stats. If you want more info on building it I‚Äôm happy to help.

Why even bother? You are just going to get Jagexed during the final hour.
---
As a child with limited English knowledge, I truly struggled with random events. Oh Boi how many times I got teleported to random places... 
---
That‚Äôs a whole lotta nope. 
---
Why?
---
How‚Äôd you do fishing 
---
i think he meant gowers, the creators of RS
---
I remember looking at the time at 0:55 and then 2:00, i was like no way did another hour just pass lmao
---
Either way he would've died. Does it matter that much?
---
If they were back-to-back, the chance would be ~0.00004%.

Thessalia's Fine Clothes in Varrock for 2gp.
---
Thanks mate, I am combat level 55, whats the first "boss" i should do and what should i take into consideratiom about fighting them? 
---
At what point does this all go passed being a complete fuck up and into suspiciously sabotaged? With the random twisted bow spawn a developer would of had to put in the twisted bow code to drop on that specific tile, it couldn‚Äôt of been random and then for this amount of bullshit to happen in something that‚Äôs supposed to be Jagex‚Äôs main e-sports drawcard, seems suspicious.
---
Woox kicked jad to death with no food no weapon no armor potions or prayer so anything is possible with practice lol
---
Selling unfermented wine! Only 50k ea!
---
I hope your joking buddy, not everyone is a master at this game some people just play for fun..
---
Agreed. For the amount of criticism Ian gets, this is definitely one of his brighter moments. It‚Äôs impossible to always talk about relevant events when
---
1. The tourney is delayed multiple times
---
2. No information is given on what happened
---
3. Keeping 40k+ viewers entertained while waiting
---
4. **the event lasts 5 hours longer than anticipated**
---
Ian still able to speak enthusiastically is simply impressive and might‚Äôve even saved the stream from outright ending
---
I think other people's point is that many people just slap graceful on when they want to do anything thats not standing at a bank, I agree it doesn't warrant a nerf but an update to the game which preserved the ability for people to use graceful's effects while removing the monotony from seeing the same ugly outfit everywhere would benefit the game.

We aren‚Äôt talking about a British game developed in England with a tournament held in England, in the comments of a clip that features a British streamer. 
---
The comment said, and I quote, ‚Äúin most of the civilised world.‚Äù
---
In the part of the civilized world I live in, this is untrue. I stated it to be untrue, and some dipshit from across the pond thinks he knows better?
---
So, I ask you, ARE YOU FUCKING DUMB OR CAN YOU NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN LANGUAGE?

&gt; Create a 'point buy' system where you can buy gear and/or combat levels (ie CW would be completely separate from your in-game levels and gear). Essentially even the playing field for players who haven't put 1000 hours into the game. Make it interesting by forcing players to choose specific builds. It would work the same for inventories.
---
Interesting idea however what happened a year down the road and I as a new player goes to CW only to find everyone is 126 with BiS just like it is today, but could be worse since it is all gained from a mini game.

Just gotta set yourself the goal really. To be honest 99's are pretty over rated... Except for Construction that cape is amazing. 
---
Instead of burning yourself out aiming for 1 skill for 99, set goals of level 80s, then 85s, then work yourself up from there?

A simple auto hotkey script to remap f keys to QWERT or 12345 is fine and not bannable. if you PM me i could send u my code to the script i use, its pretty simple. I also use ctrl+e to toggle the script on and off so you can type in game.

I guess I should've made my attempt at sarcasm more obvious

I haven't played RS in a few years, what drama?

Fine:  A place where negative numbers are shouted a lot louder than positive ones.

spear or hasta for what? just use best melee dps. scythe rapier tent whip in that order.
---
Wow, what a gripping post.
---
yeah I'm thinking I may do Slayer last
---
that wasn't a 3rd party feature, and blocking people on stage from doing it when anybody they're fighting who's at home can is senseless
---
Well I didn't hide it? Just have a 99 pop up so it covers up chat bar? haha
---
Agility
---
Lol, I thought taking damage leveled your HP (since it only leveled during combat).
---
We should be able to have community engagement without needing to avoid hurting feelings. A Jmod who royally fucked up cannot then tune everyone out for "criticizing" them. The reality is that $132 annually is a lot of money given the playerbase, and the level of incompetence shown doesn't reflect well on where that money is being spent. 
---
I clicked on this thinking it was a list of the failures of each tournament... But that probably would be a novella. Anyway, this seems like a pretty accurate and fair recap.

Finally someone who will agree that peanut butter marshmallow pizza is still counted as pizza.

Yeah you can even hear him say 'I would've felt' or something along those lines comparing himself to another streamers reaction, indicating that he didn't actually had to deal with the bug. Probably just trying to justify himself for all of the donations he got. Doesn't really bother me too much, but seems like a weird thing to lie about.

not pictured: me dropping  all of the trout I picked up on accident omw to the giant cave

From company point its probably very hard or even unthinkable to apologize, we'll see what the next blog post will be I guess
---
Wow, you‚Äôre talented!
---
Go to the Grand Exchange in north west varrock. You can buy pretty much everything there.
---
Iron armor and an iron scimitar are very cheap. Like 500gp for the full set. 
---
Leather armor, for ranging, is super cheap. Like 100gp for the full set. I think shortbows are like 20gp. Bronze arrows are 4gp each.
---
Magic is fairly expensive. Wizard and Zamorakian robes I think are about 1k. elemental staves, which will give unlimited runes of it's element, are about 1k each. Mind runes and basic elemental runes are about 5gp each.
---
To make money, kill some cows and sell the hides. You can also tan the hide into leather to make a bit more. Sell the hides (Needs 7 quest points or I think 24hrs played) and buy a bit of food (Trout I think is cheap and heals 7). Go through the stronghold of security for 10k cash.
---
You forgot the fire and the burnt fish around it though!
---
not nice
---
level 3 skillers are like the guy that has a small dick and tells everyone about it.

This is wonderful

Thats why we would have to pay more money, to hire an assistant for Mod Ash to do all of the CEO stuff but report directly to Mod Ash.

id assume if you use spear youre not in his melee distance therefore he can only hit u with mage/range which u can tic eat?

You can't walk into a league tournament and start playing for TSM.

Shut up bitch!

Why he went down the "dying to the fog" route i have no fucking clue. Why not carry on with the stable DDOS narrative that seems to always happen at DMM. Just seems way too stupid to go over the top blatant when he could of said he DCed and died
---
if this gets buried under dmm drama then repost mid-april or so, there are tons of ppl on reddit who could actually benefit from clan like that
---
I always kill the 6 brothers, 2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm. Pretty easy to find, and puts you at 86.2%. Get 0 boltracks and maximum amount of runes.

I saw the melancholy in this too lol. I don't know what is tho? 
---
Can‚Äôt buy slayer xp tho
---
Thanks mate
---
Why does this have to as overblown as zeah and fossil island. compress the size. make quality not quantity
---
All the clans were hurt by Falador, there were members of Fools and Blazers who died. They more than likely would of still won, but I do agree I would of liked to see everyone participate.
---
If you reported it ingame, there is not much more that needs to be done. If you were expecting immediate action, they won't be back in the office until tomorrow and even then a bugfix wouldn't happen until Thursday update unless it was extremely gamebreaking.
---
Not really imo. But ok.
---
80
---
Yeah the issue is that pures at your level are insanely OP. They can just smack you down fast. You gotta have a higher level zerk so the def balances or you‚Äôre screwed.
---
Spears don't hit 2 tiles away you'd need a halberd. 
---
I mean I have a pool, but it‚Äôs easier to get graceful than 82 construction + the money required for it.
---
&gt; are you sure they can still recover the account back?
---
WELL IF YOU CAN, THEY CAN. Honestly why wouldn't they? Wait until you've gained a few levels, put on some of the good shit then just yoink it back and clean the bank.

This is the best spot in the game

Thanks for a very in depth response.

I‚Äôm fairly noobish, so I‚Äôd probably pay initially. I‚Äôm definitely too new at the game to play more than one account at once.

Whoa just take it easy man

your housemate understood "Deadman mode" a little bit too literally.

Ooh i remember running essence to the law rune place and the people there would just give you the runes so they could keep grinding.

Before Mika even streamed he used to be in the facebook page posting his youtube videos, I made a suggestion about how to fix his videos and he told me I didn't have a clue what I was talking about and to fuck off (paraphrasing I can probably find us talking somewhere) The guy is an asshole I was just trying to be kind and offer a suggestion.

I‚Äôm definitely not at the end game, so it sounds like paying for a membership would be my best bet initially.

It's almost never ever accurate for salaries. No one should rely on Glassdoor for numbers.
---
Why so few upvotes? That was fucking hilarious

Pretty sure it was because the system was fucked and thought the match was over, healed him, then teled him. 
---
How did he do hit points by itself?
---
They have their hands full trying to fine tune the dmm fog.

Yes, and not only this, a runelite plugin is to blame for it looking like this in the first place 
---
This is 100% not a runescape issue lol

He could‚Äôve milked atleast 1million views from dmmt... you really think so 
---
I think you should get to know the Mod team before defending them. I used to love the majority of the Jmods but after watching Q&amp;A's for a long while (Haven't for months now) and most DMMT and other events you kinda figure out a lot are incompetent as fuck and disregard the community for their own personal opinions. I know it's not strictly them nor is it all of them making mistakes but they are doing it consistently and need to snap the fuck out of it. They haven't learned from the previous 2 years full of mistakes and it's a joke.
---
Hey it‚Äôs me Jagex customer support. Tell me your secret and I will fix it
---
How is that toxic or bitchy?  They took a huge gamble putting so many pkers out of service, unable to train or hold other areas, for something that could become worthless if even one clan was able to prepare and clear them.
---
AFAIK one of the issues is Google Authenticator is a 3rd party solution, and requires a fair bit of work from outside of the content dev team to implement. Thus even if there was a massive drive to do this (and there hasn't been until this recent year) then it'd require a decent amount of doing.
---
LOL wtf, not cool bro :)
---
Literally this. All these neet cunts blaming testers as if they have the power to make a go/no-go decision.
---
Tf happened to his arm?..lol
---
Also he‚Äôs 30 agile so no barb fishing
---
I love it do more!
---
A good plan. There is still very low/0 requirement methods, even in f2p to earn enough for a bond in about 15-20 hours too :)
---
One of the few styles that I LOVE! Amazing drawing!
---
give me money i need for staking
---
I prefer 1 click bank/empty
---
Hmmmmm
---
This literally gets people killed. 
---
No there's next to no work involved in creating the delay and Jagex wouldn't even need to do anything to do with the Google end. 
---
The infrastructure already exists for Jagex to 'remove' the authenticator from an account, instantly. Adding a delay or locking the account for a week isn't a big ask. 
---
But is it really  better xp than monkfish
---
What the absolute fuck 
---
I basically got 99 fishing on my phone while barb fishing, there's no way to empty it in one click but if you enable tap to drop it only takes like 4-5 seconds

Nice

Nope he doesn‚Äôt give a damn about his supporters, I remember pre eoc he stopped making videos for a few months and people were asking where he was and then he went on to make a video calling his fans sad for ‚Äúmaking him make a video‚Äù guys a tool don‚Äôt know why anyone supports him üòÇ

Just checked it, obby has about 170 ish melee defenses and the set that I was using with fury is about 240

Lol, this games been around almost 20 years and I‚Äôve played for 12-13 years. Hearing someone say this still cracks me up. We will see you soon asking for coins because you gave your bank out. 
---
Yeah doesnt really feel that afk. and Barb fishing gets inventory full fast. I want leave my phone for like 5 minutes or more
---
Thats the problem, I can make a really in-depth game of painting a wall, but if it isn‚Äôt interesting to watch then no one will care. People want to be entertained, not lectured on the intricacies of burning barricades.

Who made this masterpiece

It doesn‚Äôt matter what E-Sport is on, I‚Äôm falling asleep.

It doesn‚Äôt really matter what they say. It matters more what it is actually for - which is purely marketing.

Were you born this fucking stupid or did it take years of practise? You think he can look at balance sheets, income statements, analyze stocks, talk to shareholders, figure out debt strategies, and other issues a CEO looks after?? Stop fucking circlejerking swampletics you pathetic cunt

I used osbuddy, hard to imagine I would get RAT through any other program and they target my 2007 scape account and not my stock portfolio or bank account, but maybe I should do a swipe and change  everything.

&gt; Jagex is one of the best developers you could ask for tbh 
---
They're so good at developing that they had to abandon their game and restore it to it's 2007 state because they're........ So good at developing.
---
Thankyou homie
---
Virtual levels mate
---
Some people deserve it
---
Tournaments of all kind are always fucked up and people still watch them.
---
The Super Bowl had a ton of controversy this year due to their refs and rules, people still watch. FIFA is notorious for corruption, people still watch. Boxing is notorious for corruption, people still watch. Not to mention the rampant use of drugs, usually performance enhancing, in all sports. 
---
 
---
DMM is not perfect, and the latest mistake was unacceptable, however the viewership has increased each tournament. It is very enjoyable for many players to watch the 1v1s, even still with all the mistakes. 
---
Amazing 
---
The only time CW is ever mentioned on this sub is when it is brigaded by the CW community after DMM. If there are &lt;50 active competitive CW players, then it is definitely dead.
---
Can I have come context?
---
I find it less accessible due to the depth he goes into with regard to the game mechanics, however I'm just able to follow as a casual player who is slowly getting more serious about the game.
---
Honestly it is just something that I remember from the old 90s TMNT cartoon.
---
Its empty af. Even on f2p
---
They tried polling rewards but they failed. You can change it all you want, but no one will play CW until you get rewarded for doing so.
---
Thanks. üôè I think the competitive scene takes itself too seriously. The title of this post seemed a little dramatic. But also Jagex is incompetent. 
---
Same guys

Drake's belly sure is SPHERICAL
---
This is amazing.

First off, rude.

And he can learn all that. He has the mental capacity to acquire all the skills he needs, and that is shown through his knowledge of RuneScape. I think you should put a little more thought into his capabilities before commenting.

Helm of neitiznot, fighters torso, and dragon defender would like their chance to say that you claim it‚Äôs never been so homogeneous is ‚Äúutter‚Äù ‚Äúbull crap‚Äù. Puns fully intended. Support anyways though cause I like seeing everyone in different setups.
