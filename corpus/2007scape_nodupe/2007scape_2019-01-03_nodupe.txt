Did you mean to reply to the guy I replied to? I didn't say anything about the diary equip being bad. I just think it would've been cool to go with a quiver since then we'd have another rehash of something from RS3 (which I like seeing, as a former RS3 player).

There are a lot of skills that have a level 70-80 skill being a (pretty much) sole requirement for an elite, so it's not like this is a new idea:

---
* Magic tree (Western Province)  
---
* Dwarf Weed (Kandarin)  
---
* 140+ water runes (Lumbridge)
---
* 100+ earth runes (Varrock)
---
* Steal from the Dorgesh-Kaan chest (Lumbridge)  
---
* Chop Magic Trees (Lumbridge)  
---
While looking at the list, I also realized there isn't a single "Hard" requirement that requires a skill to be 76 or above.

The issue comes from redistribution, not creation. Realistically you should be fine if you make custom assets based on preexisting work, but in theory a company can cease and desist your work based on the fact that they own the rights to the concepts you replicate. Companies often don't bother (mostly because of the bad press involved and the free advertising that mods do for the games they're based on) but companies like Nintendo are pretty litigation happy. Even if a judge would eventually rule in your favour you might well find yourself tens of thousands of dollars down due to legal fees. In shouldn't be a thing that companies can do to shut down individuals but it is, and there's very little that can be done to stop it outside of disallowing companies from suing private citizens. As with a bunch of shit it's who has the deepest purse.

If you're high enough level to smelt cannonballs, it's a pretty good profit to buy steel bars and sell back as cannonballs, I think it's around a 200-300gp profit per bar. It's a pretty afk method too so I like to watch shows while doing so.

Settled, a maxed UIM started a Morytania locked UIM and It's been interesting so far. A lot of content I didn't even know about and the skilling methods are creative.

The game takes &gt;2k hours for most people to just get max stats, hundreds of hours is probably a pretty reasonable estimate for getting to be decent.

Quick question, what did you do for tilesets?

Make them, commission them? Or did you find them free somehow. Cause I'm making a pokemon game (rpgmaker xp) and I'm really struggling with limited tiles.

I don't know how these things are even made, but I'd love to know the process, language used, etc. I am just starting CS in college :). This sounds like a fantastic first project to latch onto. Everyone keeps saying to find something I'm interested in to gain experience. 
---
It's not actually double its 50 percent more but you get the teleport as well plus the extra xp slaying in the slayer tower so I reckon its worth doing. Just a lot of quests.

Hard to say since it depends on whether you are willing to do more click intensive methods that give more xp or more afk methods that lets you surf websites while training. Some skills like fishing and woodcutting can be trained without paying much attention albeit at slower XP rates. Even combat can be levelled without having to check back on the game without much attention.

You shouldn‚Äôt even need to ask this man. Don‚Äôt be desperate for female attention.

Its more about the achievement than saving money. I could just pay some dude to play and get all 99s for me, do all the quests and shit but what fun is that? Earning your own way is fun. Like no matter how fast you get gp in rs, its not worth it, even top people claim to only make $700 a month max!

Wow wtf

Well to be fair it seems like no one on the original thread got it either. You really have to read the thread word by word and not skim through it to get what he means. Worth pointing out is that he's more than likely talking about RS3 and not OSRS as the title makes no mention of oldschool, so you shouldn't be too quick to judge others for making hasty assumptions
---
You may need to have the brews earlier in the raid before you‚Äôve dropped stuff to make room for more if things don‚Äôt go according to plan. If Verzik doesn‚Äôt go well you may also use more than the brews you‚Äôd normally use and you want to play it safe since a wipe is a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.

No a regular account. If you think the blowpipe is that much more effective then I guess I'll have to save you some money to buy one. How many scales do you think I will need to buy?
---
I'd do it at 10hp if you can it's pretty quick. I started it at a high level and it takes me 1-2 sara brews per round which is more costly but I take 10 out and each round have the same amount of space left
---
Twitch lets them get away with it too.
---
So, here's the things with botting these days. You don't need to provide a CC, or any form of ID to get membership. So if a F2P bot makes 10m before it gets banned, and a member bot can make 13m before it gets banned, then they're going to be majority membership bots, that just use 1 bond.
---
Alternatively, if your bots are limited by worlds, like at zammy wines, then it may also make sense to pay 1 bond per account to unlock way more worlds, even if you're using f2p method.
---
Gone are the days when membership was truly a barrier for bots.
---
This is excellent, thank you! I'll reference this when I get to him!

uWu what's this

After completing the Biohazard quest you'll get access to the caged ogres which are pretty good cannon fodder
---
This is good stuff, thank you. 
---
You get the xp drop when you light the logs? Not sure how this decreases it unless you have to run further or something
---
Guardian boots should also become useable there imo since you're basically encasing bandos boots in granite.
---
I kind of agree that it's strange how mid tier boots are going to be the meta, however I feel like they're going crash incredibly hard shortly after the area is released, once the hypenhas died down.
---
What makes you think anyone cares about you? 
---
Alright, good stuff. I'll look into his guide. Thanks 
---
Does that come from a quest? My prayer bonus is at 1 and I don‚Äôt want to ruin it.
---
Yeah, you'll be kicked out of the area when logging out or attempting to hop worlds

Try world 324 or 325 depending on the rotation

Barrows are more a mini game than boss, but congrats on some loot anyways!

I wanted to sell  him his AGS back at a good discount (15m) because he seemed like a good dude. I Googled his name to find if he's in a clan so I could contact him (his private in-game was off or turned to friends only). Instead what I found was 2 twitch clips of him losing an elder maul just a few months ago.. I feel bad for the guy. Over 100m lost since August that has been documented.

Youd think the elite diary would be the best of the best things out there. Hey atleast you might be able to get 77 rc on your shit acc by the end of 2020..

Ohh a raid is required for the elites? Well that's great motivation to finally try completing a solo raid.

No it doesn't?
---
83 construction seems unobtainable with the amount it costs

I guess. I'm assuming these are more ffa style raids? I can understand being inefficient in ffas.

I was doing a clue in wildy and found a bit in the agility curse. Started attacking it, motherfucker was actually impossible to kill, doing the ladder trick, running perfectly, etc. I being entangle for clues now 
---
Also, if you weren't aware, there is a discord called We Do Raids that is does learner raids and is dedicated to teaching people how to raid. Worth checking out if you don't have people to raid with or you and your buddies want to learn with a bigger group.
---
Has something to do with teleblock I‚Äôm sure. You can cast teleblock and it hit someone and if they attack you before you attack them, you will get skulled. So I‚Äôm sure the player has to have auto retaliate on.  So make sure to not have auto on. Just saying this for the real players, keep fucking up them bots though. 
---
When you wear nothing your prayer bonus(prayer bonus is different from prayer level/amount) is at 0. If you equip an ancient staff your prayer bonus goes down to -1. The staff comes from the desert treasure quest. Prayer bonus slows down prayer usage rate. 
---
I noticed this a while back too! They all have super wonky run patterns and run to the same corner to hop.  
---
They also wear super budget welfare gear, like barrows pieces, obby shield and a dmed.  
---
Good news is that all of the ones I came across all eventually got banned, though I can't give a timeframe on it.

Picked up a quarter off the sidewalk today. Easiest 110k of my life.

They're defense tanks. They get their def up only and just log into a f2p world with it on. Its a really useless account build that takes longer than its worth.

Thanks for confirming I'm not having a stroke and it actually says 1080, lol.

thanks I dont know much about it ill look it up

YOUR PERFORMANCE REVIEW IS AT THE END OF THE MONTH.
---
Orginally, when I first started that was the plan, but I have something WAY better than that.
---
I did this on NYE at a party
---
That's wat I thought, but I thought barrows also required the same strength? Or is that only for weapons? It's been years since I've played.
---
Polling or not, they need to hear out the community to make it work again. 
---
restricted accounts are the best, most interesting content to watch.
---
"Blanket statements are always 100% wrong" Now that's a paradox
---
Yes, until it stops being fun. Do NOT fall into the grind like most of us and keep playing even when we aren't having fun.
---
Dude a white cash stack is something to be proud of. I feel
---
loads of people just use guthans spear, but that would be slightly slower kills, if you dont have a whip just use the spear and take a dragon dagger p++ for special attacks
---
For a long time after the first time you start playing, you should probably just explore around and do quests. 
---
Typically, from this exploration you end up figuring out what parts of the game entertain you, and then you grind that for a while.
---
This game is quite sandboxy, its up for you to decide how to play it or how far you want to go.
---
Does having a bank pin help you protect from hackers at all? Genuinely curious 
---
Just check the timer tab on the right side of runelite. 
---
Ok great i have a whip so ill use that and a dd. Thanks again man!
---
Now we‚Äôre talking.. actual bounty hunter
---
Just always have a goal you're working towards and do whatever the hell you want that makes you happy. Dont play for no xp waste. 
---
No probs :)
---
Every single time I've brought up rs in a group, I get 2 or three people freaking out that they aren't the only ones who play.
---
Zulrah is easier than Vorkath, you just have to give it some practice. The elite void will make your vork trips far more efficient. 
---
Pass, you shall not!

Well it doesn't affect me cause im an ironman

I do. I teach learner raids on stream. Go my to twitch channel and just type in !apply and the next time I do learner raids you'll be allowed to come. (For the next few days before the update i'm going for an inferno cape. I should be done with that before this update roles around.)

Safe spot it but you‚Äôre going to splash a lot so bring plenty of runes. There‚Äôs a spot you can lure it to so the gnomes do most of the damage. Watch a video guide.

Nah, his comment history confirms he's stupid as hell.
---
Hey, I also suck at pking but its fun even when I get absolutely destroyed by a pker with his eyes closed. You get better with practice
---
Yeah you're right. I deleted the comment. I will say people with custom PC's are worse to vegans when it comes to talking about what parts they have though. At least on the internet, not so much in person.
---
and you play a game infested with incel dipshits, so not sure why you're trying to insult other's choice of games
---
As others have said, it‚Äôs probably not the game for you if you‚Äôre not looking to put in the time. It requires a LOT of it to do any content that‚Äôs worth playing for.
---
Rather be around people who fuck nobody than people who fuck animals

The easiest way to manage the hp issue is to only gain range levels by cannoning and mage levels through non-damaging methods (splashing, alching, teleing).  Then you train attack strength and defense and if they're all equal your hp will be as well.
---
Give this man your monkey nuts
---
Reminds me of when people on reddit tell kids to go mow their neighbors' lawns for $5 / $10 to buy whatever they want.

How're you so sure that they're bots? That one has a god cape on.
---
RIP baby supreme

Who's laughing now? 
---
Mithril hatchets.... Bruh. I will gladly hand over the crown of inefficiency to you. 
---
Some of the best experiences I've had with this game involving not knowing what the fuck to do. Just explore as much as you can, raise your magic level for some useful early teleports, and do as many quests as you can.
---
The early game is just as fun as the mid/end game so relax man you're fine as you are.
---
You gonna commission that?
---
They have mobile out though
---
Honestly, this is the best suggestion i've seen so far. 
---
wc levels?

But its only for rs3

Selling it bro. Whips are fairly around 2.8-3.1mil for a few years now. You‚Äôll benefit from using that money now .
---
I love it!
---
yeah i like this one heaps
---
&gt; If bots are banned left and right, then it's likely a decent share of bots that consumed bonds can't make back their cost
---
No, I don't think that's likely at all. Actually, how many bots there still are, is actually pretty good evidence that any measures they're currently taking aren't working. It's still very profitable to bot, or no one would be doing it. That means at the very least they're lasting more than 24 hours of playtime, at a minimum. So in those 24 hours, could they make an extra 3m if they were on a members world?
---
The only thing that matters is that 3m barrier. Bots aren't banned immediately, they're monitored, tracked, learned from, then banned. So how much can a f2p make before that point, and how much could a p2p bot make before that point. 
---
&gt; I hardly ever see a big pile of weird names like I see on every other yew or water fountain in f2p.
---
Well, that's because p2p bots wouldn't be there. They'd be doing more profitable p2p methods, or sitting in a POH where you wouldn't see them alching, and they wouldn't get reported, or hopping worlds buying bstaves, all places that have low visibility to your average player.
---
Not to mention, that on P2P worlds, you're probably not going to be in those locations that would be more popularly botted, given their typical lower level requirements.
---
You're right though, we don't know for sure. But membership really isn't the barrier it used to be. Now, does that mean you're only going to run P2P bots even if they're slightly more profitable? No, you're going to run both, only limited by resource limitations on the servers you can access.
---
No? Squirtle has always been speedrun meta.
---
no thats barrows gauntlets
---
I had to range them for 1.1k kills.
---
Good luck
---
and literally *none* of them are the ones you mentioned. the only actually active one is rev caves (and get this, the existence of profitable pvmers is a massive reason why everything got so centralized there and it proves my point about how this stuff works)
---
most of the other hotspots are the places i was referring to by saying deep wild. Pretty much all driven by the same idea of hierarchy in wilderness driving action. Callisto, GDZ, RDG, Glory Hill, Altar &amp; have a scout at scorpia bh world. The only one that doesn't fit is GDZ... and GDZ is incredibly dead at this point sadly.
---
Now that‚Äôs a lot of damage
---
Looks like someone didn't put two step on their email! Woopsies doopsies! 
---
True to his name
---
Yeah, those lines last a while. You already get up to 4 lines wide when training firemaking optimally. Increasing the duration significantly would make it harder or impossible to maintain the best rates.
---
id recommend 60 attack 86 strength 97 range 94 mage 88ish hit points 52 pray 45 def and being like a solid ~87cb zerker 
---
What the other guy said is totally true but the rumors I've heard lately are ~1 year away as it's behind other updates that are more concrete and needs a considerable bit of engine work. 
---
Though I've also heard there are other often suggested things that would become possible with the same engine work that group iron man requires so that slightly decreases the likelihood it will get shelved indefinitely

What are JMods thoughts on this? I believe it makes sense for the new update
---
Sell it.
---
Really cool but Nintendo will just smite it as soon as it‚Äôs out.
---
The best way to train firemaking is to make lines going back and forth from the GE bank. You are pretty confined in terms of usable space unless you do some weird maneuvers.
---
I post this in every post about a player trying to get a tbow from raids.
---
Getting a job allows you to get tbow much faster by buying bonds.
---
that face tho
---
You also get like 3-5x the exp/hr at nmz. You can afk for 5 minute periods if you ignore rapid restore and just overload, rock cake down and re-absorb every 5 minutes. You still go very positive in points and make money from herb boxes. If you can't be arsed to check that infrequently, idk why you're playing the game lol (unless you're doing mobile at work or school, but that's different priorities.)

Not really though, that doesn't catch up to the exp rate and money you make from nmz 
---
TIL 1m is bank
---
Even at the ge youre going to do a second line and the first will start disappearing
---
You couldof atleast tagged the ranger as soon as it spawned. The ranger was able to hit the shield three times, doing doing 46-20-(unknown) damage. if you tagged him as soon as he spawned you would have time to tag the mager before the shield went down
---
Keep in mind the rs3 and osrs dev teams are vastly different
---
Is your character in Metalocalypse?
---
This is literally my two favorite things combined holy shit. 
---
I see. But how often do you encounter other pkers, especially groups of pkers in multi hotspots? A potential problem with this is that it may take too long to find a real pvp fight, meaning you and your pking team would spend more time world hopping and scouting than actual pvp. PvP worlds, Edgeville ledge, or BH may be solo pvp, but it get you straight to the action immediately rather than relying on luck.

Really starting to get annoyed as hell with every new boss being instanced. Everything new that gets added to OSRS caters to the immediate whims of the laziest members of the community. I bet the boss will have a teleport right outside of its lair too. 100k/death for an INSTANCED boss that gives profit better than vorkath (whose obscenely profitable drops are pretty much guaranteed to already cover the cost of a death and then some in a single kill) is not nearly enough punishment for dying. 
---
The boss should be un-instanced, single combat, with three separate chambers in each world. Dying should cost 300k. There shouldn't be a direct teleport directly to it. Profit should be equal to vorkath, vorkath should be nerfed. I'm also of the mindset that dying anywhere in game should have way harsher punishments and the entire game as a whole has been catering to easyscape for a while now so I know this is going to get downvoted to hell. Hope there are more of us in the polls or active on Twitter to sway Jmods on Twitter/Reddit or this game is not gonna have as long a lifespan as it should.

I think fighting over bosses is a beautiful thing that rarely gets seen anymore because of this wave of new instanced bosses. The whole game shouldn't suffer because of a difficult to solve problem that comes along with being an iron man.

Charmander (and sometimes squirtle) are new because the things bulbasaur was good at gets skipped by broken glitches that haven't been ruled out. Bulbasaur used to be required to skip brock among other things.
---
literally none of those things are an even remotely similar pvp experience. people who like team fighting against other clans aren't going to go bh pk instead because occasionally they are idle or killing a pvmer while looking for a fight. i have no idea what you are trying to argue but it's completely incoherent and makes no sense.

Things like fallout and elder scrolls mods come to mind (specifically the remakes of older games on newer versions of the engine), and on a less mainstream level you have things like warhammer 40k mods for rimworld and half life 2. There's plenty of companies out there that don't mind people using their IPs elsewhere - as long as it isn't for a profit. I could find literally thousands of examples of people mixing two games together as a mod and it being ignored, but honestly it'd be easier for you to go on nexus mods and browse by most popular of all time. You wouldn't need much more convincing after that.

When I started playing after mobile was released for the first time in ten years my wife started getting pissy saying she knew how it was gonna be that I was gonna be obsessed and not pay attention to her or participate in family time etc. I wasn't even playing when she was home and if I did it was to do some quick buys in the ge or sell since stuff... I told her that with my lupus symptoms, with the stress of being a stay at home dad and having to do everything a woman would do as a stay at home mom plus all the things men are expected to do that OSRS helps me relax and takes my mind off of everything as I immerse myself into a fantasy world where I can be anyone and do almost anything... Over the past couple months she's mellowed on it even allowing me to purchase and keep members as she understands now... I love this game! I have no friends in the real world I can get together with, but in game I have tons I can quest with, have a beer with, train, or skill with and they're from all over the world... It's great!

Unlucky Lady gave out 45MIL+ to random players as gifts. I've had my fair share of bad player encounters, but the sheer generosity and kindness of this player community astounds me. 
---
You‚Äôre correct, but I would suggest there is a reason for this.
---
The first of which is DDOS attacks, when GWD came out, servers would be hit offline so attackers could loot high level PvMers gear.  Now we have graves to prevent this.  These attacks are nearly impossible to stop.
---
Then second reason is because of the fact that fear takes a whole lot of time to get.  Imagine dying and losing 100m-1b in gear just because your internet went out.  No one wants to participate in a MMO like that.  Extremely dangerous death would make high level and/or expensive gear useless in non-safe activities.
---
There are other ways to balance the game.  I personally like the GWD model, where you just kind of get enough money back for your supplies and make a killing off the rare drops. 
---

Not interesting in changing your mind, but I never liked the system of losing all but your 3 (or 4) most valuable items to begin with - so I prefer this now.

No

---
[no](https://youtu.be/QTVJphDHs8E) 
---
If you get your mage and range to 75 you could do zulrah. You also have the reqs for barrows with an Iban staff
---
not only is it rewarding, but it keeps the item economy in check, ensures that players aren't invincible without decent risk, helps ease player into risk being ok (clearly the entitlement to risk has been killing new pvpers), and slows down the influx of shitloads of gold into the game.

The mage cape already supplies a spell book swap, which is powerful on its own
---
Maybe bp is faster if you woox walk. I ain‚Äôt on that level though so I can‚Äôt test that theory.
---
Yeah, the spellbook swap would be OP, Id only want it to be visually different from a ME2 cape
---
not unless it's just a cosmetic change. it'd be just an imbued skillcape with the looks of the magic skillcape and nothing else.
---
Max combat you idiot, not max total
---
It‚Äôs literally just a reskin of the imbued cape to be a mage skillcape?? 
---
Is fashionscape really that important lmfao 
---
but OP is saying to remove the spellbook swap
---
Maybe bp is faster kills if you woox walk. I didn‚Äôt bother to learn that though so I can‚Äôt test that possibility.
---
Nothing from RS3 needs to be in OSRS guy.
---
Yeah, but wouldn't it be sweet if you could have your avas device with the visual look of the ranged skillcape?
---
Then what's even the point
---
Kinda. Just the ones i find attractive. Generally humans.
---
RemindMe! 8 hours
---
Yeah, most of those guides are bullshit. The 3m/hour while using a blowpipe is considering you had perfect RNG, missed no game ticks while banking and getting there, had good BGS hits, and are not eating in between special attacks.
---
Lmfao go pay for runemetrics you dislikable cunt. 
---
But... Youll only get that xp if you already have 95 slayer
---
I'd want it to essentially just be a visual override of the ME2 cape, a spellbook swap on the BIS cape would totally be OP

I mean the magic skillcape has the same color scheme as the ancestral tho

Barrows is definitely a bit far off from where you are but for me personally it was the first big milestone for me personally where I felt like I had something I could spam whenever I needed money, and is also satisfying getting drops and whatnot. You can definitely do it fairly early, it will obviously be at lower efficiency though. Most important skills to work towards to be able to do barrows is magic, and defense/hp would help. Also, get prayer to 43 asap. it's a relatively cheap investment (look into ectofuntus) because 43 isn't that high. Not just for barrows but for everything, protection prayers are important.

I think the spec attack and spec defence in itself are best compared to the magic skill is what they are trying to say :)

Yeah definitely get elite void it has better dmg for the ranged set and that prayer bonus is quite nice

Honestly why not. Could be a niche use for the fletching cape

No no

Bloods/souls are total garbage compared to library

End game content isn't just "raids" but ok bud. You're trying to compete with yourself in a dick measuring contest, and it's hilarious to watch. Having 99 attack doesn't mean your opinion on runecrafting is meaningful in any way. All you do is cry about runecrafting, it's hilarious. "why can't warning be in runecrafting so I can train easier?" "Why isn't there a combat way of training rc?"
---
You're a brainlet. 
---
&gt; 1.) - if an entire server is taken offline due to an extreme influx of traffic, cd rollback.exe 
---
Easily exploitable and prroblematic.  You'd have to reset every RS3 and OSRS server due to trading and swapping.  
---
&gt; 2.) - This is exactly why it is good. With modern chaoticscape you don't have to think about your 3/4 valuable items to bring with you. Meanwhile people go out into the wilderness risking 800m. 3/4 items is extemely safe compared to 0/1, which is what I'd consider extremely dangerous. 
---
Losing your makes a game good? I disagree.
---
&gt; 3.) - balancing bosses isn't the issue, but the resounding lack of risk is 
---
Risk is inherently part of the balancing of a boss/content.  For example, see revs 
---
75 atk zerk master race
---
Man you're the biggest crybaby on this sub. You're making serene look smart.

there's no such thing as "ironman rng"

Agree unequivocally.  I felt that the ever-present specter of death was a major part of the spirit of the game back in 2007.  It was always in the back of your mind any time you had a lot of money on you.  Gotta be careful fighting whatever monster in case I die in some freak accident (since everything was kind of easy as shit back then too...).  Gotta keep checking back when I'm afking bandits or whatever to make sure I don't die for my Guthans.  Hell, even logging out when stepping away from the computer on the offchance some evil chicken randomly kills you.  It was always there.
---
It's actually kind of crazy to me how this isn't a bigger deal to this particular community.  Any time you see some random minuscule QOL update to like the fucking chat box or some carpal tunnel-inducing nonsense, it's met with a cacophony of people screeching about "ezscape."  But here we've literally removed this entire dimension of difficulty and spirit from the game, and this is somehow acceptable.  I realize there are reasons for it (DDOS/server issues) and I can understand if there are a few areas in the game where dying is protected, such as if you want to have a piece of content that pushes the absolute limit of runescape characters and requires roughly max gear while still being difficult and threatening, I can understand that being a protected death.  But that should be the SMALL minority, the exception to the rule.  The vast majority of the time, even doing dangerous activities, dying should be punishing to at least SOME extent (not fucking 100k at a millions-per-hour boss, like you said; that's fucking dumb).

Did 1 ticking with the event rpg into obby maul get nerfed? When I used to pk on my mauler 2-3 years ago I remember being able to stack the hits but now the switch into maul takes super long.

That‚Äôs useful, thanks man I‚Äôll make sure to use all this information I really appreciate it. I‚Äôll try to get some grinding in f2p till I see fit then I‚Äôll start at p2p

I did MM2 is one sitting last night, it took around 2 hours. It really isn't that bad and I never got frustrated doing it.

Awesome thank you for the link.

Can we get an NSFW version of this too pls?

Why aren't you giving me your RSN? Let's discuss this in-game, you already know mine.  And my opinion isn't on runecrafting, its on PVM content being locked behind runecrafting.  And I'm pretty sure I have enough PVM experience under my belt to have an opinion on that.  Do you?

the code behind it isn't optimised for multiple cores, so yes, the game engine is "at fault"

You were trolling people on a video game and someone in a position of power did something about it..... Like reeee or what here? 
---
Because stats aren't relevant here. Your opinion is moronic and unpopular, and all you can fall back on is "but muh combat stats!". Nobody cares. 99 attack doesn't mean you have a good opinion on Skilling lol. I bet you don't cry that in order to get faster approval in miscellania, you have to kill all the dogs and gwd? You won't say "waahhhh why do I need to do pvm for a Skilling reward?" Because you like pvm. You just have a telephone pole sized stick up your ass lol

In 2007 the best gear took 10-15 hours to get, assuming you had 85 slayer.

How long does it take to get just bandos, a whip, and steads?

Was a joke bc it was 8k and my lowest hard clue ever. I've done over 80 hards, I obviously know I'm not going to get good rewards everytime...

How did he even make it off tutorial island...

Lol it's the same thread bud. Really funny to watch how you respond to people disagreeing with you though. 
---
just a btw doing his thing

id say granite boots will be the best for normal meleeing, but when it comes to hydra boss i think the new upgraded brimston boots will be better coz they are hybrid boots and it looks like your going to need more than 1 style to kill it

You do realise max means either 2277 total or 2736 and not 99 nmz stats

Well there goes about 2 years of work trying to be original

Very true..

Twisted bow and ancestral robes did not exist in Runescape in our childhood tho.

I know what you meant. I was saying, ‚Äú*yeah his ring was good for the time,* but not for that drop‚Äù. Obviously you weren‚Äôt smart enough to tell!

I‚Äôm confused what did I forget to cut out?

Your shaft has an attractive bend near the tip that I'm really into.

If you thought mm1 was hard because of the fights, then you should probably train your stats a big more before even attempting mm2.

If you thought it was hard due to the time commitment and frustration, well good luck and have patience

Yes. Each brother gives you another loot roll in the final chest. So instead of getting 6 rolls you would only get 5.

Not quite.

The requirements for the music cape will be bumped up again: this time to to 95 slayer to unlock the song at the boss lair.    
---
The trimmed version (all achievement diaries) will also required 95 slayer as killing the Hydra is part of the new diary releasing in the same update.    
---
(shame about this to be honest, I haven't even gotten around to getting 75 slayer for the gargoyle boss track, the only song I haven't unlocked yet right now).    
---
Now to wait for that!

Is there an actual chance I get to play this someday?

1hr safe death allows noobs like myself to try content they'd otherwise skip entirely out of fear of losing their stuff, while preventing other players who end up dying because of lag from straight up ragequitting and never playing again.
---
Seriously though, what does that that level of risk actually *add* to the game? I'm not saying it doesn't, because I know I personally enjoy tense moments in games, but what harm is it actually causing?
---
Also, anyone who is actually making that much gold from a boss probably know what they're doing, and probably isn't risking very much of their bank in the process because they're sitting on fat cash stacks from their successful runs and can just buy back all the gear they would've lost.

More importantly, what did it cost?

Yeah I have a question. Why do you have the worst customer support ever? People constantly get hacked and you do nothing. No matter how many steps we take it still happens. I log into mobile and I magically lose 300 mill overnight. You have trade logs. You know what‚Äôs going on yet you still blame us, the consumers. No one is asking you to pay them their lost money. We want you to Go get the money that was stolen so you don‚Äôt have to ruin the economy. It‚Äôs not hard. Open the trade logs. Follow the trades. Bring me back the original money that was stolen.
---
Trimming a music cape requires all diaries to be completed.
---
Since you can boost kebos diary from 90 to 95, the slayer req for a diary cape stays at the 93 from western provinces.
---
For the untrimmed music cape, you need 95 unboosted and a task.
---
And so you'll already have the slayer req to trim the cape before you're even able to get the untrimmed one.

The way that you make the wing claw look kind of like a thumb makes me look at the entire wing as a distorted hand. Which of course is extremely accurate as far as I'm aware. 10/10 execution. Just slightly off enough to be creepy to me.

anyone know how many of the kebos lowland diaries 1 def ironmen pures (BTW) can do?

Now's a little late, but it's probably a good idea to hide how many days old your account is. It could potentially be used (along with other info someone might dig up) to recover your account.
---
Grats :)
---
That's better! Otherwise the [Combat Bracelet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Combat_bracelet) would've been your best option since it doesn't have any requirements. Mithril has comparable stats and from adamant and upward, the metal gloves are better.

No you can just listen to them mentoring you through the raid and type ingame if they ask you something

Anyone that has the opportunity to play Runescape has the opportunity to make money online, it's as simple as that. Just stop with the nonsense, talking about people who don't have the same opportunities.

just look at his feet the sounds distract you. hovering feet is mage and instant slamming stomp is range. use blowpipe with addy and dragon darts for last waves and crystal bow for luring waves

Best one yet!!

Yeah, but this one gives you actual combat stats! It's not like the scarf I was using.

I love Jagex in general.  They aren‚Äôt perfect, but I feel most game devs could learn a thing or two from them.  They don‚Äôt have the best infrastructure sure, but they really party attention to their players if they have legit problems with their account.  Most people I see getting ignored are asking for items back from getting hacked or scammed.

I think the engine work required for that and the work required to make it so you could log in the more than 1 of the accounts at the same time would make it unviable, but agree it would be cool to have 
---
I just tried to use the recovery system, in every circumstance it sent me to an e-mail and required I do something from the e-mail before it allowed interaction with my account. It never gave me the option to directly do anything. I know in the past before when I tested for security vulnerabilities(3-4 weeks ago) and tried to recover the account while logged in it told me to try support options in game or log off. It wouldn't allow interaction with my account while I was logged in at all and just repeated that message.
---
Maybe you found some weird way to access accounts, but without access to your e-mail they are unable to do anything from my testing.

I've quit runescape; I've just not got the time to play this game and pursue my ambitions as an artist/animator. I gave away my entire bank to seal the deal, more as a way to let other people to use a part of my account while it remains logged out forever than to deter myself from coming back. A scythe to my friend who was scammed his tbow, an Ely to a friend I've met while farming ranarr, and my remaining 200m to a w314 ge drop party, my homeworld. This is something I've put together to help me deal with the sadness I have leaving behind something so dear to me. It makes me sad that everything I've spent so much time on is just going to disappear and be forgotten as I never log onto this game anymore, so I thought I would feel a little better if I publicly posted some of the things I've done in this game.
---
Why? That's the highest value of Farming and would grant the most devastating reactions. Dead trees.

I think the mechanic you‚Äôre referring to is that you can only see dropped items if you were logged in when they were dropped and you‚Äôre still on that login session.

---
True, I couldn't think of the right term though. It's like when Elon Musk said he was considering a change to his company so his stocks went up. I don't remember what that's called though, insider trading was the closest thing I could think of.
---
Awesome work man! 
---
ghrazi gonna drop to like 150-200m, dhcb is ranged and has more uses it'll stay at 150m\~, i expect lance to be between 75 to 100m tbh long term. And on release street price it'll be 200-300m for a day or two before plummeting to below dhcb price. All depends on the drop rate.
---
Are you wearing a witchwood icon?

Not into such ideas, never!

I believe it's important to be able to visually distinguish gear and 2 different items with different stats that look exactly the same shouldn't be a thing. If this were added, the cape would have to look different.

In other words, this won't be added.

Whether it‚Äôs outdated or not is irrelevant. A stereotype by its definition is a gross representation of a general populous. It is by its definition often inaccurate or just plain false as with all other STEREOTYPES.

I've always thought a path of exile like seasonal would be interesting. Every season they can switch some things up, put some kind of twist everytime, and offer some kind of reward incentive then after the season your character becomes a regular account. 
---
The biggest hurdle though would be the lack of character select in this game. You would end up with a shitload of accounts. 
---
I'm 800\~ kc in without a DHCB, one nature rune &amp; 5 fire runes.. 
---
I don't think they'd make it so you could log into multiple of your characters on the same account at the same time anyway, many MMOs have this system and only allow 1 login to the account at any time. I still think it'd be cool anyway.

No, it's part of what makes it difficult.

I'm sorry but it really annoys me that you gave the Pokemon that doesn't have hands a sword. Charmander - a pokemon with perfectly capable arms - is stood there casting without a weapon. What's wrong with you?!
---
Why are they impressed? 100% valid and an appropriate question.
---
I lost my account once due to forgetting the password and they straight up ignored my requests for almost 4 months. I had already given up at that time and just decided I would give 1 last time before I decided to call it quits and I sent the support team a long email, telling them my frustrations, with attached files of pictures of every level stored through osb pictures basically and they replied a week later basically allowing me to get back on my account. It was super frustrating to take 4 months to get threw to these guys and I understand that it really isnt their fault. It just sucks feeling hopeless.
---
No. Seek help you pathetic psychopath. This isn't how you respond to humorous remarks which would've been highly embraced if anybody else posted it.

Dude that was pretty funny. Nice joke! Simple meme, good joke, good enough for me! Yu Gi Oh always gets an up vote

Raids 1 is much better gp/h long term if youre good at soloing, but vorkath is better for consistent money. 
---
See you in a few weeks
---
I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and call this for what everyone knows it is. BULLSHIT. I have a friend and an alt account that I regular trade over 3b worth of stuff in a single trade (scythe tbow max sets) and absolutely nothing ever happens. 1b is an insanely small amount of money in the grand scheme of things and they don‚Äôt ban accounts for trust trading tbows LMFAO
---
Or just talk to him to skip the whole entrance 
---
Nobody is impressed, nobody mentioned impression. Why do you speak in riddles 
---
&gt;im impressed 
---
&gt;same here
---
I'm asking why they're impressed over this. How hard was this to interpret?
---
Lmfao
---
Because kids fall for it
---
No, repulsive swine.
---
So they shouldn‚Äôt improve the flaws in their system because it teaches people a lesson? Most of us played when they banned people for very little reason and I think we are much happier with the system we have now then before when we could get banned for saying ‚Äúfuck you.‚Äù and that system didn‚Äôt teach us that cursing was bad, we all just saw that the system and the reasons they had for banning people were dumb.
---
Why cant it be combined with our current slayer helm?
---
Tell that to T-Series sub count.
---
Yeah, but they're not as vocal about it as the autistic core playerbase.

My old old account (from when I was a kid) only seems to be on RuneScape3 or whatever, how did you get it on OSRS?
---
Your incompetence is off the charts. I cringe every time.
---
88% still gives you a chance of bolt racks. 86% has no chance. 
---
Ok, dumbo. Block me so I won't have to see your idiotic hate ever again.

Starting today it would take about [16393 hours](https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/suppliescalc.php) but fast as methods didn't exist back when he started so he played about 17000 effective hours.

Fully auto slayer scripts are out there
---
OSRS isn‚Äôt the game for it. There is no other MMO that I have played or even heard of that takes as many hours to obtain high level gear as OSRS does. Ripping away hours and hours of work due to a DC, DDoS, or Jagex‚Äôs incompetence? No thanks. It‚Äôs just not the game for it. The old engine, the way osrs plays, it‚Äôs just not the right game for it. Losing everything on death doesn‚Äôt make people ‚Äúhave that sense of risk‚Äù or ‚Äútake lower tiered gear out of fear‚Äù it makes people just avoid the content. The way modern games are styled aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlose everything‚Äù games because game developers have seen that the market doesn‚Äôt WANT that. OSRS already struggles to maintain completely new players for a long time and this would only further decrease new player count. OSRS is not designed to be a ‚Äúhardcore game.‚Äù And sure, you can say that back in 2007 it was a ‚Äúlose everything‚Äù game, and was still wildly popular, but I‚Äôd argue that the only reason it stayed like it did for awhile because a large portion of the community was too young and didn‚Äôt voice their opinion. Jagex realized after awhile that the death system wasn‚Äôt working and added the gravestone system we saw back pre-rs3. They realized that runescape can have risk vs. reward WITHOUT being a ‚Äòlose everything‚Äô game.

The animation for fire surge removes the weapon, I was gonna give him a thamoran sceptre

Buying a blowpipe is one of the single greatest power spikes you'll ever get on your account. Even if you can't afford it now, it's better to go grind gp and get it since it's a really big deal.
---
Blowpipe is stupid cost effective, even if there's an upkeep on it more than what you're used to.

I like you Serene. Idc what anyone says.

As someone with 3k horror kills for only 3 mask. I‚Äôm so unlucky :*(
---
why would you not update your info sometimes? Make a fresh email and password just for your runescape account. People like you are the reason its hard to feel bad for the random recovery victims, hopefully you dont have much to lose
---
I'll ask her! 
---
Unlocks slayer tasks, areas, teleports, gets you account rounded out well so you can afford things or have the ability to make money.

And hey, quest cape teleport is pretty dank too.

This was absolutely pure &amp; beautiful. Well done

Everytime

Rs3 is poor
---
Yea but don‚Äôt ya think the 95 slayer req is going to be to kill the boss hydra not the little hydras? Much like the 93 slayer req on the western diary is to kill thermy and not a normal smoke devil.
---
Aka you need a task for the boss aka 95 slayer
---
There‚Äôs bots everywhere all the time, man. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle for some of Jagex‚Äôs bot detection squad.

I have 287m agility exp.. Let's assume all done at ardy (which is not true, Ive done probably half of that at brimhaven which is more clicks):
---
287,000,000 exp / 793 exp per lap * 6 clicks per lap (minimum number) / 1400 clicks per calorie = 1551 calories burnt from agility alone (probably closer to 2000+ as brimhaven is much more clicks etc.)

yes

Unless he maybe started this account when OSRS came out and if i recall correctly there was a skippy there for a short while so if he used that he could've killed a chicken as his first NPC

I'm 11 so shut the fuck up

No it‚Äôs the slayer pet

That's hilariously untrue and you know it.

Quitting the game...

because thats a drawer full of clothes under it lol
---
If it hasnt been compromised in 12 years wouldnt that mean that im doing something right? ü§î maybe going to phishing sites,emails and having your password be password123 are the reason people get hacked.
---
Lol 20-story superskinny POH's start popping up in varrock and fally but they are always completely empty because they were 15th and 16th homes for some Al Kharid princeling
---
As for hydra gear, the teaser fight was predominately melee which makes me think this boss will be much like cerb. He damaged the blue phase with a rapier during the trailer and hit a 40 to phase it to red phase. That pretty much throws all tribrid or potential tribrid fights out the window. If dhb is used I would venture a guess that tbow will be better like at brutals or olm. I would guess that melee will be the fastest kills/hr based on the trailer. It would also make sense that this boss has a weakness to stab considering it drops the lance and things generally drop the thing that kills it fastest (olm and the tbow verzik and the scythe). But I would also guess that unless this boss has an insane crush defense, that scythe/dwh will become the bis meta. 
---
Of course 100% speculation but based in the 15 sec teaser trailer that jedflex tweeted. 
---
The sweatstain crowns this
---
\&gt;when you literally strike gold.
---
hey stop bsing.
---
18 years isnt that much...
---
So what're you up to today 
---
Uno
---
You're just listing general BIS items for certain stats, thats not what im asking at all.
---
I'm talking about a specific build, an obsidian tank, just as the best choices for a different build would differ, for example a SOTD build.
---
My current stats are irrelevant, as the pathway of an abby tank is set out, hence the items will remain the same at whatever stage.
---
I appreciate you taking the time to reply, but i'm not sure that you understand what I'm asking.
---
Well you just said yourself that they fixed those flaws you are talking about. They aren't going to reward people for using malicious language and shouting abuse across the internet on, lets face it, a kids game. People are arseholes who rarely admit they made a mistake, so its easy to blame the company because they got hacked due to a 'flawed system' even though they put themselves in vulnerable position... That isn't jagexs problem.
---
They now have 2FA, and various other systems implemented, its down to the user to use these features for thier own security. It's like shouting at microsoft because you recieved a dodgy email and clicked the phishing link, that isn't microsofts problem although they try thier best to prevent this, offering advice and anti virus protection. Jagex also goes out of thier way to create some in game content teaching people about what to do and what not to do. Even though it should be common sense.
---
Is this going to affect slayer helms that are recolored? Will I be able to use my black slayer helm or do I need to make a new one? 
---
Probably because they're worth more than 10m???? It's not that hard of a concept
---
Or at least a figure of how much is taxed every 24 hrs - 7 days - 1 month - year.
---
Like a sign post that has the horse that says "say neighhhhhhhhh to gambling"
---
Ancestral wasnt a childhood memory, entire art needs to be redone.
---
afaik skippy has only been in the main game when hardcore ironman released, otherwise it has been dmm only.
---
He certainly wasn't there when the game released.
---
you guys really need to stop assuming what i would do with it. i just wanted to rush with it but obviously the osrs pking community is toxic lmao what was i thinking
---
all ive got is the bop it tune going around my head, but instead of bop it, it says 'sit kid'

I think u‚Äôvebeen seeing this post 153344 times in a year

Sucks to be my idiot friends that have lost billions staking
---
Oh hell yeah Im gonna try that when I get home.

Go gamble that 100m you brainlet

While you were staking and putting in effort, i made 10m in 5 mins just begging at the GE. Sucks to be you I guess 
---
Well is it not true that anyone can make money?

Let's see I was in your shoes in a couple of years ago. I started learning Wordpress off of YouTube videos. Learned a theme really well. Applied to Upwork. Began small oddball jobs on there to build up a profile. Learned copywriting. Added that as a skill on there and began providing copywriting for clients for $15/hour. After that, started building small websites for $300-$500. Always underpromised and overdelivered, received great feedback, and kept growing a small profile on there. Kept growing that. 
---
Separately, run two different websites, one for e-commerce and another for web design &amp; copywriting on my own where I began cold calling websites I researched and grew off word of mouth. In 2018 I expanded into Facebook &amp; Google ads from literally nothing, just by studying. I fully live on my own with no "real" job and nothing but a Google Chromebook, and grew up in a household where my parents didn't even know how to use computers.
---
It's not as easy as AFK'ing at sandcrabs. But still, anyone who speaks English and has an internet connection can do it. Google is your friend. I would suggest:
---
- reddit.com/r/beermoney
---
- reddit.com/r/flipping
---
- reddit.com/r/entrepreneur
---
- TheFastlaneForum's hustle forum
---
- Amazon Turk to get started
---
- Upwork
---
- Fiverr
---
I can hire a VA from Vietnam or the Philippines or anywhere else really to take care of smaller tasks or do research for $10/hour or less, which is a huge amount for them. And that's almost two bonds worth of money. If they can do it with English as a second language, anyone can. 
---
I allways do this, and i repeat it when i get drunk aswell

Unexpectly satisfying.

Hello,
---
I am on mobile, and whenever I post something on this sub it tells me to add a flair or it gets removed. It tells me to leave a comment with a designated letter, but I haven't seen any other posts with an OP post with a single letter. Am I doing something wrong? 
---
You are missing the point, his friend was a RWT, they don't ban trust trades, but his friend bought gold and traded him items making it seem like he bought gold.
---
To elaborate on this - 
---
With a defence pure build (1 att 1 str with high def), The set up would be tyranical ring, RGP, fury as key items (Crush bonus), until 40 def,  where the key items change to Strength ammy, maple blackjack (d) and rune boots with zerker ring. 
---
These arent BIS, but best for build.
---
I understand how hard it can be to make sure you remain self aware and not project your insecurities into other people, and I can see you struggle with this!  I can link some very helpful resources for you to help you get yourself into the proper state of mind which involves being fully self aware, if you would like.

Rip 11gp

So i uninstalled the Geforce Experience app and it helped, thank you all for suggestions :)

Best thing to do is to view the edit history of wiki pages. 
---
Go to the page that's closest to what you're looking for, and then click the history button in the top right. 
---
Here's and example: https://runescape.wiki/w/Wilderness_Volcano?action=history&amp;dir=prev

Risk averse compared to *what*, exactly? The average MMORPG has it set up so that you never lose any of your gear upon death. OSRS is very different when it comes to death, especially in PvP. As for PvM... to be blunt, who cares? Playing against AI was never about "risk", because bosses can be learned and have predictable patterns. It's easy for you and I to sit here at several thousand Zulrah kills and say "lol you should lose all your shit when you die at Zulrah" after we learned the boss and it's piss easy. 
---
If you want to play 'risky' PvM, make a hardcore ironman, otherwise, go PKing. That's were the "risk v reward" is and always was.
---
You‚Äôre a monster

you can try a webarchive/wayback machine service and browse the wiki

This is amazing but I prob would have switched the combat styles for squirtle and bulbasaur though.

Whenever I play Pokemon I need 3 save spots, one for my Charmander, one for my Squirtle, and one for my second Charmander.

If you post a comment with a letter to set a flair, that comment gets automatically hidden, so nobody will see it. Most people remove that comment because otherwise it would still look like a comment got posted, but since its hidden, it's misleading. Removing that comment doesn't remove the flair.
---
Tried to explain it as best as I can.

you mean "take a seat, dear"

And yet i still got 10x more cash than u in 5 mins.

Yeah but you worked for it, I sat back and did nothing

&gt;is a rusher

&gt;Calling other people toxic

I probably cleaned 'em haha
---
well of course my mistake, the PC version 
---
It‚Äôs 2019, can either twitch or jagex or both get a handle on this shit? To use players it‚Äôs just another step for us to our account security but to the outside world, imagine downloading mobile and then coming to twitch and looking for a streamer and all you see is. OSRS DOUBLE XP STREAM OSRS, and then the next stream you see OSRS NO SUCH THING AS 2X XP, FAKE STREAM OSRS
---
do y‚Äôall not agree this pushes new players away?

At least you can't spend too much on your PC if you play DayZ.

Seems a bit like this would gatekeep content, as in newer players wouldn't be as inclined to try new bosses and such. I think the vorkath system is pretty good but make it appear upon respawn and bank everything maybe

Copy-pasting from a response below:
---
"I'm looking to get the name of the software their Watcher picked up as a bot program so I can get rid of it, unfortunately the evidence tab simply states "mod comment"."
---
It is not covered in their support page, and since I've never knowingly downloaded any third party software for botting purposes Id' very much like to get rid of anything giving a positive so I don't find myself facing a ban again.

I haven't botted.
---
I'm not whinging for a ban appeal, the account wasn't high leveled enough to give much of a shit. But I absolutely do not want to invest in a new account, get it up and running and then face a ban, again, with absolutely no way of, again, getting any clarity as to why.
---
&gt;Not using night-mode
---
Smh
---
Well, what us your suggestion on how to change it?
---
Keep in mind, that most monsters have access to this rare drop table and that some monsters have a higher chance to land on it. 
---
I'd also like to note that a **rare drop** doesn't necessarily have to be an **expensive drop**. I think it's healthy for the game to have a few random filler drops. 
---
dont buy em man, there really over inflated right now, wait until the drop back down to 1.5m
---
Ok mr (super alpha) hotpocket
---
(I got the bot message about the comment reply tag thing? I'm not sure how it works since I don't seen an option to pick flair. So labeling this is a question via a comment. Correct me if I'm doing this wrong &gt;&gt;)
---
nice
---
Oh wow, that would save an entire 0.5 sec every time
---
thanks
---
Why? Your character automatically goes to fill it back up, plus you can have multiple Ectophials in case you screw up.
---
Well, there's no way to ask them for that because that's something that they would absolutely never do. 
---
You want them to give you details about their internal bot detection system. You can ask all you want, that isn't going to happen. No way no how will they ever make any of that information public, since it would compromise their detection system. 
---
You can appeal your ban here if you haven't already: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002238729-Account-Bans

It very much was a battle

This is some good shit right here

I have protect from Magic, I was going to load up on food and prayer pots, let the gnomes fight him then jump in with prayer when he is low

Scales are 150 gp, that doesn't mean it's not still decent money

Is that fighter torso? What about hands and boots, any suggestion?
---
Rooftops
---
Ahh I get that, I just watched a video on this topic and it seems to make sense to not protect if the cost of protection is more than 1/8 of the seed cost. So its only really worth to protect normal trees if you follow this.

Lol awe someone jealous that you dont get in no attention next stream ill give you a shout out

How did you manage to get all that addy on your iron!
---
Do I have to buy Void Armour first, then accumulate points again for Elite Void? I'm assuming that's how it works, knowing this game. 
---
Just hit cmb 100, so I think I'm ready to start the regular Void grind so I can kill Zulrah, then onto elite void.
---
Then I'd support a RDT rework, but not until skills get reworked as well. PvM already bringing in 90%+ of the game's wealth and all.
---
Nah thanks for the advice but I don‚Äôt need the drop right now. Just wanted to share my unimportant bad luck on this droptable lol
---
Its karamja gloves 3, and he's wearing clue hunter gear. dude
---
Dps calculator says addy knives in snakeskin is better than fire bolt in mystics against Jungle Demon. Either way let the gnomes do most of the work.
---
Lol i love a good keyboard warrior 
---
Exactly. I started when I was younger back in I believe 2005. I quit around 2010 or 2011 because RS3 blows. I only started back up again about a month or little more ago, and like you said I'm already beyond my expectations I had as a young teen. When was young I always wanted a skill cape and to have a 99 to be cool, and I played for years and years and never got it. This time around it took me 2 weeks to get my first 99 lol. Super happy with the grind this time 
---
Btw its literally you idiot
---
So how long exactly? And are they planning on switching back?
---
On my ironman i got 4kc ahrim staff and 12 kc ahrim staff but after that ive been very lucky lol 
---
Hell, I'd even be okay with the falador party knights showing up and doing a 'rare drop dance' when you land on the RDT, anything but this abomination
---
Wtf is the 89 meme about
---
I‚Äôm sure he dug back 44 days just to make SURE he wouldn‚Äôt post something on this sub that hadn‚Äôt been posted before because that NEVER happens on reddit 
---
Rarest untrimmed cape iirc
---
Maybe just note the items on it? That way you can walk away from a training session with like 3 diamonds, 5sapphires, 5 emeralds, 4 rubies, etc and only take up a couple inventory slots
---
Wtf swordfish, amulet of power, regular pots...
---
Implying i watched your stream? 
---
? 
---
I'm also trying to contact jagex sadly. My fully quested pure got banned for real world trading. Idk if trading gp from my main it's banable 
---
Someone should kill a demonic gorilla whilst playing with it

Just wait 4 hours and then do it? I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would put themselves through that haha
---
Osrs community is autistic ... 
---
There was when OP started playing though
---
Your inv hurts me 
---
Sorry i guess im not chain gang gang material goon squad XD
---
If you really care about the exp, yes protect. But if the cost is too much, you can farm your own yanillian hops with yanillian seeds, which are like 10 gp ea.
---
I personally dont because i dont bother doing extra farm runs nor want to spend money on protection.
---
Serene, shut the fuck up. 
---
60 minutes
---
No plans to change it yet. It will never be reverted to the way it was but grave stones have been discussed
---
cannon tasks make me fall asleep and bursting is too expensive, can't barrage yet
---
This happens at work a lot too
---
Not since Infernal Cape came out
---
Should drop dragonstone
---
My suggestion for a rework is to have the RDT composed of a chance to roll at one of the uniques of a monster, the shied half and spear, empty spaces and master scroll. This way it becomes worth it to actually consider wearing a wealth ring instead of zerker all day.
---
your irl rng takes the hit not your ingame rng 
---
Rooftops or werewolf
---
Yep, haven't done the hunter/crafting grind for glory and only 50 herb so no super str/def
---
who cares haha
---
Older than I am. Kidding. I probably could have played RS at 6 years old, but who would have introduced me to it? I don't have any brothers, and my cousins played WoW (though I don't know when they started).

Thats not how paying services work, even remotely. The company requires grounds for terminating a service the customer has paid for, the table membership in the poker game and membership in runescape.

Without compensating the customer for the unduly termination or providing evidence to show it was justified its absolutely a very Grey legal area.
---
Just as people grind 200m without bans, i was banned for something i did not do, and there is nothing other than Jagex' (Who have been proven wrong before) say so. 
---
All orcs must die Cyngus gameplay
---
The grind is not as bad now for sure. When I was younger, like 12 on my first account, i remembers it taking ages to get 60 attack. I actually thought that someone had hacked my account and lowered the xp rates because it was taking so long.
---
Literally the same drop rate. 1/10 for both
---
You can always swear at her
---
Ah, I remember 2nd grade.
---
More like RS3, did you even see Runefest, compare OSRS players to Rs3.
---
Just have to go wildly or bh I guess
---
You can hate the Pats, but Randy Moss is a god damn national treasure and any Moss Jersey is cool to wear.
---
Yep he stated in another comment that it was his intention! He did Squirtle first and then decided to do the other two with classes based on both triangles
---
Whenever I play Pokemon I need 3 save spots, one for my Bulbasaur, one for my Charmander, and one for my second Bulbasaur.
---
Especially in 07/08 :(
---
All you need for the tank route is brews and staminas, with maybe a prayer pot or two. 
---
This is a repost
---
Not really. Most dragon is already selling at alch price. Onyx would be super rare. No one is making bolt tips, they are all from drops. Elite and master clues don't have a large effect on the economy. I'm interested to see what you think the negatives would be on the economy. 
---
Nice. 
---
Do you have night mode on mobile?
---
This is a decent reward, don't be so melodramatic.
---
THATS A FAX
---
I had so much trouble with Galvek :/ got 80 kc at vorkath now :) loot tab growing so rapidly 
---
Pull a fakey so they twist it then flick it and pull it for the ko
---
&gt; regular hydras
---
Thank you for your help.
---
I just started my ironman this week and this has me drooling
---
I'd like to see it updated or have a second better one for higher level stuff and this one for low level stuff. It doesn't need to be something super expensive either, 50-150k would be decent 
---
Yoink my idea now
---
Why should I use that one over the one that comes up on Google search results?
---
His Youtube algorithm game is on point
---
well if ur going for runite ore might aswell try out MLM 
---
I kinda like the old style tbh, but new one looks nice too
---
It's not a crime to be proud of an accomplishment no matter how small! Have a great new year bud :)
---
!wiki
---
But no one can enter your house...
---
I got the last 2 hunter levels I needed then completed MM2 in one sitting, took me almost 6 hours. I enjoyed it, good quest. Can‚Äôt wait to be assed getting reqs for DS2. 
---
why is that a problem..?
---
not sure if we can summon him as he doesn't have reddit gold but i'll give it a try anyway, /u/settledRS/, care to comment? or are you keepings things a surprise
---
You got hacked RIP. You didn‚Äôt secure your account lol
---
gratz man :) hope you don't mind me using the clip , I just thought it was too much bs not to post \^\_\^. just tell me if you want it taken down or anything 
---
They're referring to the line "Get up on the Hydra's back" which is repeated frequently by Phil (Danny Devito's character from Hercules) during a boss battle in Kingdom Hearts II. Danny Devito did not return to play Phil in the Kingdom Hearts games, so they got Bobby Costanzo instead.

Not sure if this is a serious post or not, but it will be back up tomorrow http://services.runescape.com/m=news/maintenance-thursday-3rd-january?oldschool=1

RIP my low ping worlds, I get ~28ms to the US West worlds (I think all of these are US West), and ~80ms to US East.
---
its called twitter lottery
---
Farming runs can easily make yourself bonds every 2 weeks. 2-3 herb runs a day (takes 15 minutes every hour or so). Very easy to start. 
---
Slayer eventually will be a good way to make bonds and train combat up. You‚Äôll be able to make enough cash to also train up ranged and mage (mage xp is free after 70 when bursting nechs and dust devils) 
---
Is over, 3 zenyte in a task, gl to u.
---
me, never got it unbanned no matter how many attempts
---
Because the wikia one won't be updated moving forward.  
---
$11
---
I just started the abyssal demon grind. 400 in and nothing yet. 
---
Yep. It‚Äôs never a 100% success rate. 
---
Why not add the various types of noted planks to it?
---
Nah, just did it a couple weeks ago. It just takes forever. When you finish it you have to talk to some dude and he‚Äôll fly you to karamja. At that point you talk to another dude who takes you on a boat
---
I got my first on 8th kc on my iron. Didnt go further tho.
---
Go for 88%. Kill 2 skeletons
---
Just add the wiki as a search engine
---
To burn off one cracker youd have to click over 60000 times.   Never mind that cheeto in your hand.  
---
Because the one that comes up on google is abandoned and won't be updated, if that's for you then go ahead.
---
Should go the rs3 route and introduce a new luck ring which improves the rdt, and also adds an ultra rare item you can get.
---
It's not game changing, but it's nice to have that one in a million chance
---
I love the new night mode! Also a big fan of the reader mode, didn't know that was a thing.
---
Oh Jesus now I feel dumb.
---
Thank the goddess.
---
I think the MTA plugin is on by default but if not be sure to turn it on. Under the settings tab, you can just search for it.

but ok

---
Hey thanks guys I‚Äôm in :D strawbery btw!!! 
---
Zulrah only requires mage/range
---
Yes I have had some luck trimming some runs down about 30 seconds. Switch to sharks/Kara‚Äôs as most recommended. I did get an imbued heart. I do not have Rigour unfortunately but I‚Äôll post one of my kills later when I get the time.
---
With the food switch I can‚Äôt barely stay for 3 kills so with increase banking it has not really made the difference in kills per hour still about 12-15 hourly
---
*immoral, my dear Serene.
---
Now, you made some good comments last week, some of which were not downvoted. Please keep that up.
---
Thanks man! I'll catch up with you one day 
---
I actually just tried mlm for the first time when I used my free week of membership from mobile. My mining is now at 69
---
Once you unlock worms pisc fies really fast
---
one day...
---
Do you have an Android app for this?  That would be awesome.
---
Definitely possible to do. 
---
That type of functionality is something that is valuable in UI testing. 
---
Also, wayyy back in highschool I messed around with Auto Hot Key scripts and created one that would open the browser and log me in just to see if I could. 
---
Who?
---
Just dinged 51 slayer and had a half drop offf of the base fire giants under waterfall 
---
Giant Spiders in the Stronghold of Security. Great melee XP and they don‚Äôt hit that often once you get around 65 Defence. 
---
I need to go back to boot camp smh
---
Ah that‚Äôs what it was, haha
---
Me in middle school 
---
Does Salve (ei) work on monsters reanimated with arceuus spell book?
---
That's the problem they don't know it was his friend, he could have paid his friend to do it for him so if this ever arose he would have an out. If just having someone middleman the gold made it safe jagex would have other problems. I agree it's a shitty situation but not much he can do.
---
Yup. It's all very D&amp;D-esque feeling. With having to check every single thing you do and have a fail or succeed but it just makes the area feel clunky and slow when you have to go through it so many times. 
---
There's only one leg.
---
Because fandom was/is awful and it didnt run well
---
Fandom (aka Wikia) blows fat donkey dick
---
Unrealistic expectations, bulbasaur doesn't have hands! 
---
You can make them less detectable but never undetectable unless you're a god. 
---
tbh even with all that I'm still skeptical, like just doing the steps all correctly felt like it would take that long at least.

Thanks, I was 50m from Dragon hunter crossbow so I decided I'd keep going until I got enough. Never got that unique. I'll take a pet as compensation though Jagex

Bad RNG and bad cropping

As soon as you can use the Addy C‚Äôbow, do it. That with Mithril bolts worked pretty well for me.

rune darts are 1k each and dragon darts are 3k each. For someone like me who has 1 defense, you want any advantage you can get to kill those 90s quickly. I think I used about 800 rune knives with bp after 1 run even with ava on
---
Fixed! Hard refresh your page, and it should not be readable. Thank you for pointing it out.
---
hahaha yes I haven't played OSRS for a good while now but your series awoke my inner nerd, so i did some digging around the wiki.
---
I'm adding more to it even after you've replied lol
---
Very excited for the series !
---
Wouldn't you be 2278 when warding comes no matter what you do ;)
---
Paint is hard

Suck my penor serena

Shut up serene

At least the upside here is the DHCB. I'm grinding for the pet/tanz mutagen currently. No luck yet i'm just coming up to 1K kills.

Rite.

3 hours apparently so we were both wrong 
---
Wvyern sheild 
---
It's down for maintenance
---
I fully support killing Wikia, but let's not kid ourselves. It's going to stay updated. Maybe not by the most passionate editors, but still. 
---
Fast and easy buff while not devaluing old skills:
---
- add 5 new skills
---
- flood this rare drop list with items from new skills 
---
Cheers thanks for the responses
---
I update it manually every few weeks or whenever I get around to it
---
So it does change both, I'll have to try when I'm next online!
---
Good luck! I'm off to vorkath now, had enough of Zulrah for now
---
Serene you dumbass, no one picks flax, not even bots. They're like 2gp per.
---
I call bs on his flax.
---
You thought of this?
---
I thought of this. 
---
Darts in a blowpipe affect accuracy and damage. Bp has 60 base accuracy and 40 base strength.  Putting darts in the pipe adds the stats of the darts to the base stats of the pipe. 
---
People use the field? Lands Ends FTW
---
This is what I was looking for, so when you‚Äôre skulled and walk into a safe zone, the guards kill you?

"Judging by the way you write I thought you were a little girl"

For once you make a funny joke

---
First time killing Bandos on my OSRS account. Got a little lucky.
---
I had shield left half and skotos pet same kill, rng took a hit, and also it didn‚Äôt.
---
So if I Google "OSRS Wiki" and if Jagex's Wiki is the 3rd result, it's quite obvious that Jagex doesn't have superior SEO strategies. SEO is literally what I do for my job. The Internet isn't magic, search results can be manipulated using a few lines of data on your website.
---
Barb assault world is under maintenance, what world is everyone playing BA on?
---
[Silence seal you](https://i.redd.it/tluvwa4wns721.jpg)
---
also better for your eyes
---
Wow, that must get frustrating! Especially when engaging with randoms and if the individual in question covers up their arm in a subtle manner 
---
It's already 3 months out of date with no signs of changing.
---
Imagine thinking this makes the game any harder.. its just annoying, its not hard. Whats hard for you is using common sense.
---
If you meant you liked the fixed width, there's actually an option for that under the half-moon at the top right.
---
You will most likely have to complete it after the diary comes out to get credit.
---
You're confusing personal wealth with general economics. 
---
You're correct that adding high value items makes the rdt more valuable but it won't have any effect on the amount of money in the game, which is the main point of a gold sink.
---
Whats wrong? 
---
They definitely aren't necessary, it will just speed up the jad kill by a bit.
---
My 9 Jad kills have been with either broad bolts or rune arrows and a msb.
---
It does not. 
---
It's not Jagex's wiki, we self host. Jagex just funds us.
---
Just leave them. Not worth. 
---
no it doesn't show at all. you click through people. cant skull up with it hidden
---
I love what they do with supply drops on DMM.  
---
Something similar to that, an additional drop of something useful.   It doesn‚Äôt have to be the same table as DMM, or supplies really.  
---
The tasks  will not be retroactive. 
---
Pest control. Just run around by the portals and burst everything :)
---
It was a sarcastic comment dipshit.

You should try to recreate this picture 
---
Hah, grats dude. 
---
Wrong. While yes there are a lot of cases mostly involving high profile named men where women will try to take advantage of that and falsely accuse them, it absolutely can be true that a woman waited several years to finally speak out. Especially when youre tied to said person being accused with kids etc. You've no clue what goes on in their head, scared of being labeled a liar or scared of breaking up your family. Yes its easy to sit here on the outside and say they should have spoken up but when its you in that position you would understand how some women feel. Its not always easy to just report something of that matter. 
---
The second one. 
---
woow, this is both the most toxic and stereotypical response from an ironman player...way to raise the bar 
---
I 100% agree but not 30 minutes ago I got smouldering stone, while my friend has been doing Cerb and hasn‚Äôt got it yet 
---
Just to clarify, i dont care if the account doesnt get unlocked i quitted years ago, i just thought it would be cool to play again and try osrs mobile
---
it already has a peek option
---
Oh, I could def do that... I have high herb, con, and farming 
---
I don't disagree, there is obviously a grandmaster quest waiting to be set in Zeah and it seems silly not to use it in an elite requirement. It's worth noting that there is still the area south of Zeah to be discovered and expanded into, so the grandmaster quest may be tied to the elite diary of that future area.
---
Average value 739, replaces regular drop rolls. Christ. Isnt that a nice thing to happen on bosses.

the gems would be worth more cut

Just a prank bro

But how do I buy

Hey guys so I was just curious where I should take my account. I‚Äôm making a pk account and I plan on using it for some p2p pk‚Äôing, but also f2p. I don‚Äôt plan on getting anything past 65+, but if it would satisfy a certain build I might consider it. I like the idea of pk‚Äôing with ranged and hitting them w a melee. Anyone have suggestions on levels to hit to make a decent stat pool?
---
I feel like grinding for the diaries is more for accounts with a higher total level. Even tho they‚Äôre helpful it‚Äôs more useful to do quests or train stats to a 70 base before completing the diaries. 
---
Just my opinion no hate on your knowledge of the game
---
Do it in runecrafting youll be a god 
---
It's true PepeHands
---
damn, ty so much i didnt know that
---
Spent 150m on rigour+augury 18 months ago and still don't regret it
---
Doubt it. With f2p do rates that would take years for one skill
---
Bot clients work exactly like Runelite or OSB. In most cases, they load the client externally and inject code in that allows them to utilize the functions and data from the client. Bot clients can then inject synthetic inputs (mouse/keyboard gestures) and play the game autonomously via scripts.
---
It's to prevent abuse so no 
---
I turned it on and it still doesn't do anything.
---
Look up Pawz
---
Wait. Is jagex like cool with this?
---
It's also impossible to prove one was never a member, so it's really a personal accomplishment thing rather than an official record
---
Why's it gf account? And thanks man, want to learn a few bosses as well as raids 1 but trying to focus on uni atm, just getting bored of farming and rc üòÖ
---
What are your stats? I want to try sometime, I'm cb level 108. 
---
89atk, 89str, 86def, 81 range, 76 mage. Can I do it? 
---
I second this
---
It's in a book called "Convert Anything to Calories" published by PHP Science World Shinsho
---
I would definitely look into getting Proselyte gear as it gives great prayer bonus, if you‚Äôre looking to train slayer it helps a ton. Also on that note, try and get your prayer higher to 70 if you can eventually. (for piety)
---
Elite would be one of the best options. But you can kill her with dhide and mystics. But trident and bp is a must have If you want some effienciency. 
---
Great writeup!  
---
However, I must add that the pickaxes only drop iron picks. Rune is from catacombs only.  Speaking from experience :(.  
---
Also I've gotten 5 drops in one hour from tarns lair mobs which were not on the wiki drop table, so they might be even better than assumed!
---
Is anyone suggesting that or are you just being retarded?
---
"Rare drop table" averages less than 1kgp, idk man, but Jagex might not know what rare means. 
---
I will when the official wikis are better than the old ones. A lot still lack a lot of info.
---
Cool, I'll have to read up on it a bit more üòÅ
---
Nice
---
Gratz! How many attempts did you do? 
---
Cant wait to see you stream! keep us updated 
---
Yeah I know that. I was questioning the guy who said the wrong answer.

I went 811 without a unique, hang in there.

@JagexSupport on Twitter is one option; if you're able to get in contact with them, you can contact one of them on the list [here](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/208513575?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=support-cm&amp;utm_campaign=support-deflection&amp;utm_content=community%20helper%20team) and try your luck.

If you've got legitimate proof of ownership, such as matching recoveries, billing, and old emails of your account ownership, you should have every reason to get it back. Make sure to setup 2 factor Auth on your emails too and have a backup for cases like this.

You have progressed so much and this is so wholesome. Gratz on the new computer, cant wait for the streams to start. Also gratz on that hunter!!
---
Plenty of YouTube videos to help you out there. Again, people say it's expensive, and it very well can be, but like I said, I blew on my points on the most expensive stackable I could get, which was fire runes, so I pretty much broke even-ish. (Give or take a couple M). Good luck!
---
Yeah I compared the recent changes pages and realized I was wrong. Hope Google deranks Wikia soon.

KempQ's videos shows him doing AFK blast furnace pumping for str xp pretty sure you can do it from 1 str.
---
Then they will release 2013scape, the perfect copy of how osrs was in 2013. The circle of life is beautiful. 
---
yeah its not to difficult after some practice, do you do raid or still learning? 
---
COULD IT BE, and hear me out here. that maybe just maybe, "rare drop table"  does not equal "expensive drop table" ?
---
Combat xp is pretty fast, you can get 60 base from scratch very fast. I played a lot because I was having a ton of fun rediscovering osrs.
---
And I thought I was lucky when I got 2 leaf blades swords in 20 kills
---
That‚Äôs not true, it will just force people to not use bis until they have mastered the boss. But even then people will die, which adds to the risk. 
---
And each single bis item may not make a big difference but having all your items be bis makes a HUGE difference. So people will still risk it for faster kills. For some it will be worth it, for others it will not.

This part of the game is literally to old to safely recode at this point.
---
They should take a month to recode a brand new karamja island.

I've never worked with them or tried them out. I like to stick with the ones I know and prefer.

If you haven‚Äôt done DS2 I recommend if you have the level!! It‚Äôs so fun

Yeah that is what I plan to do if I switch to Duradel. I'm 10 cons levels away from having my own occult! In the mean time, I'll use Kara 3 gloves and W330.

Not like 10 hrs, I make like 300~ 650k (3~ 6 full inventory) per hour depending on pkers and how available it was. But people cannoing destroys your profit, if you find a world without one basically double you profit.
---
It‚Äôs up to you but from my point of view it comes down to these factors:
---
Runelite is free so you‚Äôd get features locked behind OSB Pro. OSB used to be a boring client back in the day so I was weary of it when I used it. Runelite is open source (mostly besides what jagex asked them to hide) so people double check it for funny business.
---
Other than that they are similar so it comes down to preference. There might be some difference in features but it‚Äôs minimal
---
Nice try but I've already completed the Stronghold of Security.
---
In all seriousness way back in elementary school a friend's older brother had an account that was slightly better than mine that he didn't want (like combat 35 instead of the weaker one I had) which he gave to me. Been using that username ever since. Funnily enough I gave away that same account a year or so later so the RS3 xereous93 is the only account by that name that I know of that isn't actually mine.
---
New vid series perhaps? 
---
House/Ardy cloak tele, recharge prayer and tele back to Kourend. Takes less than a minute and you can afk those tasks for like 6 minutes at 70 prayer. 
---
And then they‚Äôll delete rs3 because they deleted classic 
---
You'll log every 20 minutes I think 
---
Wow this one is amazing, Zelda vibe ;D
---
Tbh, I would prefer an alternative route to avoid yet another memory clogging extension and slower loading time.
---
There is more "wealth" because wealth encompasses items not just gold, but unless the new rdt drops a fat stack of coins there's no new gold being generated, except if things are being alched as stated previously by /u/applejacksparrow (ps awesome name)
---
You can't bust with a trident, dont know if that's what you were implying. You'll need desert treasure completed and ancients staff for auto cast.
---
D
---
it's like 40k exp/hr at level 1 smithing.
---
Lol I feel you with the liquor. I only keep beer in the house as I need something to stop me(my stomach being full) from consuming alcohol indefinitely
---
Holy crap. Hope you get it soon
---
Who cares...
---
Ok, I do agree with alot of these points, they definatly could expand on existing features. Adding an SMS option would also be very useful and could be tied to recovering accounts, I would like to see this added personally. 
---
I haven't had any bad experiences with customer support, myself. I did contact them over christmas because I purchased the wrong bonds for my brother ( like an idiot ;) ) and it was promptly solved.
---
And I will confess to being one of those nostalgic 20+ year olds reliving his childhood! I don't have figures either just an assumption given the mobile release and a surge in new players.
---
Thanks, I'll definitely give it a shot. I see it mentioned a lot, so it can't hurt to check it out. 
---
Well I plan on at least moving the camera around. But I'm sick of using the stupid ass Rock cake and potions
---
Give ornament option pl0x.
---
Birthday cake helmet 
---
Awesome thanks man
---
They aren‚Äôt gonna be going up in a while just buy bonds and play the game... btw it‚Äôs because all the mobile players already love buying there currency on other games so osrs is just like that with bonds
---
Just what I needed!!! Thanks so much &lt;3
---
Justiciars are specifically with saradomin tho
---
Well it‚Äôs not really the first link. It‚Äôs a sponsored ad, not a search result. 
---
I'd do Monkey Madness and get a Dragon scimitar for general melee use. 
---
for Barrows i'd use rune plate body &amp; legs, neitz helm, ardy cloak, ibans staff with a rune kite or tome of fire for all but Ahrims. for Ahrims and the tunnels I'd have a black dhide top and ava's switch with a magic short bow and rune arrows. bring 1 or 2 Prayer pots, a stamina, and barrows tabs, use a dueling ring to tp out to clan wars to restore hp and prayer with the FFA portal and bank if needed and tp back with a barrows tab.
---
It gets faster the more you get used to it.
---
Yeah, can always just stick to OSB if you end up not liking it.
---
Good luck!
---
u/JagexSween new merch?
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/EliManningFaces/photo
---
Yeah but I have 2 separate family vacations so I gotta save all the days I have :/
---
I want to try iron man, but farming pots/foods?? I ain‚Äôt feeling it
---
Do you mean gp? Not every monster is supposed to be a good moneymaker
---
Check under your seats...
---
More so just wanted to see that sweet stack in the bank! Hopefully you get the hilt soon, though
---
Well sorry sir! That would require a lot of days.
---
At the end of the day it's a suggestion that I think is more realistic than OSHD itself. By no means am I implying that this would be easy to do or that they should drop everything they're doing to focus on this, just something that could be considered.
---
\&gt;1795 total kappa
---
Seems like the most reasonable and least intrusive option, granted pk teams will be ‚Äúsit kid‚Äù and ‚Äúsat kid‚Äù as a duo to try to skull trick people but at least you would have the option to see who is attacking you
---
The bot just looks for the words wiki and stickies that message. You did nothing wrong. 
---
 For what it's worth, that wouldn't have been funny regardless of who said it. 
---
That would be such a huge overhall I doubt we'd ever see that, besides that would never pass a pole. 
---
If you have an Android phone you can use the Google Play rewards app to get credit for the Google Play store and use that credit towards membership when you buy it through the android app. Once you buy membership once it's pretty easy to maintain a bond with member skills. 
---
 MaD CoZ dUmB pOsT?
---
i was just saying d scim in general is good, you could use it for the tunnels if you want to save on rune arrows but you only NEED mage and range for barrows.
---
Rune Full helm would be fine, its just neitz has no negative bonus for mage or range and a +3 prayer bonus so if you have it it would be better to use.
---
gz on rev essence
---
Wait you need these boots to enter that place? Oh lord.. btw here
---
I got my first tanz fang (and first unique) at 678, second tanz fang at 698. Keep at and they'll come eventually.
---
But I did manage to cop a script of adderall so I'm sure I'll get enough efficient time played for this update haha 
---
I remember farming  from green for sgs. It was insane, no clue how I managed to go through it all! Best days ever
---
Looks great, I'll be voting for yours
---
Haha I know thats not what trident is for. I just want 75 to use it for other tasks that are not bursting. Sorry i worded it poorly :P. 
---
And yep DT is completed and I have ancient staff. Though when I start bursting tasks I'll probably pick up a master wand. Ive only got 4m cash stack atm so I'm gonna do some more clue grinds tonight! 
---
It‚Äôs beautiful 
---
I didn't hear about that change, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's the case. 
---
Wanted to use prop swap but they didnt answer me back, so I used OakDice and it worked fine

Focusing on zuk hoping to kill him before ur ultimate death is a shit stratagy. If he just tagged atleast one of them he would have increased the time the shield was alive.
---
I haven't had this problem even 1 time. A handful of articles out of tens of thousands are messed with lol. 
---
I'm in tears :(
---
It *is* different information though. New changes won't be seen in the old wiki so it won't always be fine
---
200 greaters, 400 dags.. one a shard no totem pieces...
---
Ask me anything.
---
If you use the player to mute, it'll stop playing when in the background. If you use the chrome option to mute the tab, you can then forget it on the background and it'll keep playing. Just remember to set the quality to a low one if your internet is limited.
---
The sponsored ads show up first and are usually look like a regular link 
---
This was the 7th attempt, got to zuk every time from attempt 3 and upwards, luck wasn't on my side
---
What's spy hits and world trackers?
---
&gt; The new architecture in Kourend has left much of the Gielinor look outdated in comparison
---
Depends on the view point, because the more detailed Zeah looks stylistically out of place and whacky in comparison to the rest of Gielinor. And I don't think I'm speaking alone here, as posts like https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6t99dt/attention_new_updates_bring_us_models_which_are/ have been upvoted in the past. 
---
Hmm, that‚Äôs an interesting way of saying,
---
People who PK iron men...
---
‚Äúare enjoying content intentionally placed into the game by the developers in a zone where the game warns you about the risk.‚Äù
---
You'll get it bro! i maxed my zerk before i even really pked, so it was rough for a while. I just brought d scim/dds so i wasnt risking too much. DDS honestly wrecks and its more simple to me, gave me more time to focus on my veng casts since i wasn't as nervous about getting smited. 
---
I'll do a tribrid fight with 10m on me, as long as you do the same.  I'm not giving you 10m for no reason, you can go earn your own money you poor piece of shit.  Imagine giving a shit about karma, I wasn't even aware I was being downvoted and I continue to not care.  And I told you I was maxed because you said it wasn't the game for me, assuming I'd never reach end-game content, as if its something I can't succeed at because of whatever reason is in your head.
---
It was a sponsored result that used to show up before that link. I'm pretty sure it was removed 
---
I kind of agree, but also it just seems like one of several terribly option. I'd rather have this than not. 
---
Big tip. Mithril darts. Super cheap, with an Ava's they are auto picked up and are better do than a crossbow. 
---
Also, you might think to stop at 50, or 60, or 70 because those seem like high levels. But really 70 is like 5% of 99. I'd say go for 75, that gives you access to blowpipe which is one of the best weapons in the game. It's relatively cheap to buy, but expensive to use and will make getting a firecape magnitudes easier. 
---
Stats &gt; gold until your 1750 plus total. 
---
Oh yeah and get a fighters torso. I didn't replace mine until my bank passed 700m.
---
Why would I imply I had 2277 total if I'm complaining about 77 runecrafting.  Not to mention I don't go out of my way to hide my RSN or anything, I've posted on reddit without hiding it.  You're legit braindead lmao
---
I was at the last one, definitely a fun event!
---
Yea but this is pre-GE economy and the strongest weapon was a D scimmy or Abby whip. 100k/hr actually wasn't awful.
---
Hey man I hear theres a game with updates graphics you can play that's pretty similar
---
gotcha, well then i guess what youre proposing makes sense.
---
No...Justiciars aren't just a RuneScape or even a Saradomin thing.
---
It is different information though. New changes won't be seen in the old wiki so it won't always be fine. If you look for the holiday event you won't see that in the old one. 
---
Wtf you on about
---
That‚Äôs why you get that pet insurance 
---
Thanks man, wish I kept them too. Would be a sick collection to have :D
---
costed me 210k exp from a rune to a dragon defender
---
Yeah and buffing rdt won't change that, only minority of monsters would actually benefit from this and those are mainly already popular
---
What was flax used for?
---
Are you killing things to get early levels? Waterfall quest gets you 30 str with no requirements. Iirc you get like 50 attack and strength from questing 
---
i personally think its very op
---
Sometimes I'd rather get nothing than rdt drops
---
I'm too retarded to do that.  I have my buddies on discord watching my screen screeching at me where to stand.  I have RoS.  I've gotten loads better and I've barely attempted to beat zulrah more than a handful of times.  I find the easiest part is jad phase.

Have you ever been to barrows?

Sure.

Thanks! I‚Äôll check it out. I‚Äôm a mid level Ironman not quite ready for raiding for probably another 1-2 months. 
---
I use the same besides guthan body, v skirt, dfs and warrior ring. I take 2 range and super combats, 1 antidote++, 1 sara, 1 super restore, the rest p pots and 4 sharks for initial entry. I managed minmum 60 kill trip but have managed 75 kills. My combat stats are 85/92/75/91/74/89.
---
I've done guthan's, but wasn't a fan. Too slow and repairing it is a pain. Eventually switched to just using obsidian and absorbs.

When you kill a monster it rolls a random #. This # is then looked up in a table and that's the loot you get. So for example 1-20 is gp. 21-40 is  a saphire 41-80 is a bucket. 81-99 is a diamond. Now 100, instead of being an item is another drop table. The "rare" drop table. It rolls a second random #. And then you get that item off this second table.
---
all numbers made up, but that's how it works.
---
We talking low alch or high alch? :0
---
Yeah we have a few iron man. It‚Äôs just a nice environment and things like skill of the week and chilling on discord is fun :p 
---
completely agree, and while we're at it the abyssal bludgeon is also totally goofy 
---
&gt;The wiki‚Äôs historical price data is currently stored in modules, page names in the format of Module:Exchange/item/Data, eg https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Module:Exchange/Bones/Data. You can get this as plaintext by adding ?action=raw https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Module:Exchange/Bones/Data?action=raw  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This is a lua module which returns data in an array of strings, each of which is in the format unixtimestamp:price (or unixtimestamp:price:volume, if volume data is available (though IDK if that was setup for OSRSW)). This should be easily parseable using regex.  
---
&gt;(ps make sure you‚Äôre using the new wiki not the old wikia)
---
Thanks that's exactly what I was looking for!
---
type the needed quests for gloves in the search field on youtube and click the one by slayermusiq
---
I think it would be easiest just to store it at the leprecaun and the take the time to put it in the bank when you have a lot stored
---
Scythe and abyssal bludgeon are much worse
---
Make my switches, change prayers, run to where I need to be, make sure I‚Äôm attacking and all that. Glance at chart to see where I need to run next and that‚Äôs pretty much it. I use the ‚Äúinteractive zulrah learning tool‚Äù

Helm shop in Barb Village, plate legs store in Al Kharid, chain mail shop in Falador, 2h shop in Taverly (probably).

You get a Rare Drop Table! You get a Rare Drop Table! Everyone gets a Rare Drop Table!!!

It's because jagex's made up lore is more important than what the players actually want that we didnt get this. In the fake lore of jagex, justiciar knights invaded the theater of blood or whatever and died, leaving their armor behind. It's dumb

Ironically in the competitive Pokemon scene, Hidden Power is like specific account builds people do in OSRS to have access to unusual move types.  Pick the right IV combination and he can have access to Hidden Power Ice easily.
---
Thank you so much for this. Love it.
---
I'm not disagreeing. Always hated the bludgeon. 
---
Just get rid of it and redistribute the items elsewhere, might make that shield left half worth something.
---
Well the game calls him "the dark lord" so....
---
It takes 188 clicks minimum to make 26 pizza bases if you do this 8 times you will have clicked 1504 times. Doing it 9 times just makes me tired of doing it.
---
that would be dope
---
Google a pure guide.  Essentially if you never plan on it going 50, 60, or 75 atk for p2p pking then it doesn't matter at all. If you do then you will do quests that give attack until 40 and stop.  Other than that you just train in p2p because there are better xp rates than f2p.  
---
If you want helpful things for p2p training then look into stuff like a halo, bear's head, varrock easy diary for the armour, horror for the deep for a book, dwarf cannon to use a cannon, w/e quests you need for the range backpack(these will give pray), etc.
---
And? This isn't about real life. It looks stupid and chintzy. Some rs3 bullshit
---
Obby has strength bonus 
---

Gold is also worth literally a tenth in rs3 compared to RS, so saying it adds 1m death cost is a bit misleading isn't it? 
---

15m
---
From a Singles perspective CharY loses out to switch-in heavy games to SR.  From a Doubles/VGC perspective, CharY has more control and move variety over CharX because of weather control, brute forcing Sun boosted Heat Wave/Fire Blast, Hidden Power options like Ice/Ground, and one turn Solar Beams.
---
The fuck

D gloves are still gona be a minimum of 107 qp. You might as well just do the 175 at that point tbh. 
---
Yeah I actually started off with wilderness slayer for the emblems + amount of points and med clues. And at a lower combat level it really wasn't to bad and rarely did i deal with pkers besides the one time I had a revs assignment. That one sucked ass lol. 
---
But my main source of income was from doing medium clues. Lets just say i got extremely lucky on a medium clue and had only done around -20 or so. That paved the way for me to buy my fury/zerker ring/blowpipe/ancient hide etc and 70 pray. 
---
Actually I just spent my cash stack on dharoks too. I had to sell my archer ring though but ive got like 1.5m left over. The dharok is for NMZ since I do need to imbue my black mask. I figure that I wont really be using range any time soon (a lot of my $ got spent for cannoning to 70+ range for fire cape, after a couple failed jad attempts I got 75 and blowpipe which was ez mode). 
---
But I'll need to start the clue grind again. I need to get master wand + occult neck and my archer ring back. I've already got seers ring and ancient d hide/ancient hide boots for range so I dont need to get kharils or anything. I do need ahrims though. I heard ahrim staff is actually good if you dont have master wand or the kodai thing.

Strength bonus is (almost) always preferable. That being said, Obby is just the lazy option to getting a torso. Which is the cheaper option to getting BCP, which gives you the best of both worlds, plus a prayer bonus. Albeit a small one.

95 slayer is listed as a pre req for completion of the diaries in the dev blog. Tbh this probably isn't the finished product right? Still a week out. Not difficult to change some text on the final touch ups. I expect it to be a kill of the Alchemenical. Even though its the only requirement I'm missing for completion

Nah the red contrasts the blue volcano way too well. If you make the braziers blue as well, it will throw the whole thing off.

Lets ask their mom.
---
This is true, I always forget that. I got to 93 wc in a few months of casual play. Felt SO close to 99 and someone said 94 was only halfway and I just about killed myself 
---
It's exactly like regular accounts, but uses up all that sweet noted essence from slayer
---
Crossdressing Cloud, Aeris and some blue lady?
---
Deal With It
---
Wait, what happened?
---
Are they changing the graceful set?
---
Underwear?

Does anyone know if you can +5 boost the 90 wc req?

I feel like playing RuneScape as a teen taught me a lot about economics and life in general. If only if it were as easy to get rich though in real life. 
---
No joke, uim exists 
---
Do Monkey Madness 2. Then there's an option to perform said act afterwards for your heroic achievement.

Pest control dying would be a real tragedy.

They already won't be using BiS if they haven't mastered a boss, because they'd be new to PvM. 
---
The risk vs reward simply isn't big enough to warrant using BiS in the scenario laid out. Saying "having all your items be bis makes a HUGE" difference is sort of bullshit - if we're doing say, zulrah, with TB only (as that's a consistent +4M moneymaker that's easily camped and has a very defined bis vs non BiS), the difference you're looking at (with 3x items kept on death) is:
---
Twisted bow kept. Anguish kept. Ring of Suffering kept.
---
Pegs-&gt;D'hide.
---
Arma -&gt; D'hide. 
---
Accu is free. Barrows gloves. 
---
Alternatively you can bring recoils and use pegs instead for upgraded DPS, but less QOL.
---
So lets say you go for the recoil+pegs and blessed d'hide to drop 80M off of your gear value, this is what you're looking at:
---
https://i.imgur.com/pEEBVdM.png
---
https://i.imgur.com/qDgXAig.png
---
https://i.imgur.com/tXoWHXD.png
---
Less than 1% DPS difference between wearing full arma or full blessed d'hide, but a 80M pricetag difference. 
---
The issue at hand is that no, it really doesn't "add up". BiS would only be used if you don't care about money, or doing a safe activity, and that's no fun. The current implemented system at TOB+vorkath that gives you a minor punishment (lost time + 100K cash) are good solutions IMO. Losing access to high end gear because you're afraid to lose it isn't. 
---
2200/22= 100. There are not 100 skills in osrs lol. There are 23 skills. 2200/23 is 95.6. 
---
&gt; There is a time and a place for risk content, in the wilderness. It doesn't necessarily need to be a main aspect of the game. High level PvM is structurally unsustainable with extreme death mechanics. 
---
Meet in the middle you talk shit i talk shit add me on osrs PRLS0N might end up bein friends lmao both on that shit tlk game
---
Plot twist, HCIM...
---
Can we please get vectors of each alone?
---
Not gonna lie
---
Maybe goldfarmers?
---
Crazy archeologist is super easy and requires only mage, venanitis can be safe spotted and is weak to range, but clans come every 30 min. 
---
Zulrah is super easy after the learning curve I‚Äôd say 20 kills. KBD is weak to range, but not very fun drops although the pet is sick. 
---
Before hardcore players never did that. They would only risk what theyre willing to lose. Nobody risked ranger boots when soloing kq or sara for the short time it was out for example. Hc players are also addicted to the game, so a loss wont cause them to quit.  Casuals die for their mith helm and quit. Casuals also need max bonus to do certain bosses

99-77=22 2277 total lvl s...

Na

No worries. Im pretty sure jebrim isn‚Äôt a real person 
---
Gratz on getting big high ward god dildo.
---
1/10th, 1/6th, point is that "an added 1m death cost in rs3" makes it sound like it's actually a lot for anyone that doesn't know that the exchange rate between the games is gigantic. It's basically the same as we have right now with vorkath and TOB chests paying extra gold to get our items back, people don't seem to moan about that. 
---
a great daily workout for them (rs) gains
---
That‚Äôs a dope feature, I want it
---
He said 2200 total lvls not 2277
---
Get her in a discord call
---
finish off ancestral, take a helm switch, and take ring switches for when snakelings aren't on you
---
I tried you missing out on a good time
---
Lmfaooo this mem gets even funnier if you watch the compilations
---
KKona Clap
---
Lvl 22 in all skills is 506 total lol
---
Possible option and i thought this before one of them spoke to me briefly saying they was brothers
---
99.76% chance you should have gotten at least 1 hilt by now. RIP
---
Yes transportation is huge cause it saves so much time. Tbh don‚Äôt worry about the diaries unless you‚Äôre a skiller 
---
You had a Tbow. Rebuild Rome yourself.
---
I dig it, good job
---
Getting augury prayer will help alot. They are decently priced. Quick question: why not add a helmet switch?
---
If people aren't moaning about it already then you proved your main point wrong.
---
People are willing to pay more for better gear. If it costs 166k for a 0.5% upgrade then people will pay it if they're anything like rs3. 
---
I don't see how it makes my point about rs3 pvmers any less valid
---
Just worded it poorly.. "The lowest single skill you can have to enter a 2200 total world is level 22" assuming everything else is maxed
---
Now thats gold
---
He said base stat not all stats.
---
But that is not the lowest base level.
---
I bought dhcb close to 170m, not selling it so far, the way I see it as long as it has use to me I don't lose much if it's price drops because I have it for the purpose of further moneymaking, bossing, and general use on draconic slayer tasks, so it serves it's purpose all the same.  Plus I'm still waiting on those kbd and vorkath recolors
---
With each loss I thought, this is the time I'll win it back.
---
don't do maths, kids
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Mods: West, Gee, Munro, Sween, Ash, Kieren
---
2.  Hint about Hydra boss by comparing it to an existing boss?
---
  *  It's a slayer boss so it won't be a TOP END boss. Perhaps in line with Cerberus or slightly harder.
---
3.  With many new Spirit Tree Patches available compared to the release of OSRS, could the farming level multiple spirit tree unlocks be reevaluated? Perhaps +1 tree with every 3 levels after 84?
---
  *  We're happy to if the players want it, no strong feelings either way and since the seeds aren't tradeable it probably wouldn't be a terrible thing. Currently the player can have unlimited trees at 99.
---
4. With the 3 items being removed from Chambers of Xeric drop table, what happens to those rolls on the table in CoX? Does it get split among remaining items or does the chance of getting an item generally decrease? 
---
  *  The way we've set out to do it, it wouldn't effect the drop-rate of other items. So essentially your overall chance overall of getting an item is now lower. Happy to publish numbers after launch. Pet rate HAS been changed to accomodate - to keep it in line with what it used to be. 
---
5. Will Hydra be instanced and/or limited per world?
---
  *  Instanced and unlimited, with an item collection chest if you die - 100k reclaim. 
---
6. Will a mine-cart be added to the Kebos region?
---
  *  No, but we have made sure there's plenty of ways to get there! 
---
7. Was Alchemical Hydra inspired by RS3's Alchemical Onyx?
---
  *  Nope, the first we heard about RS3's thing was at RuneFest Rehearsals!
---
8. Will there be any Quest or Favour requirements to hill Hydra Boss or Just slayer?
---
  *  Just slayer really, quests/diary may be helpful for teleports etc.
---
9. Can we use Wild Pies for Hydra or not?
---
  *  No. You have to kill it ON TASK and you cannot boost to get tasks.
---
10. What Zeah Diary tier requires 77 Runecrafting?
---
  *  Elite.
---
11. What is the couches favourite models/animations from Kebos?
---
  *  Sween: The Lance!!! --- Munro: The Ring! --- Kieren: Redwood tree (farming) --- Gee: Drake NPCs. --- Ash: Extra Large compost bin filled with rotten tomatoes! --- West: The final form of the Hydra!
---
12. [IMAGE] Gif of Konar (then Gif of a bugged animation model)
---
  *  Wow, looks cool.
---
13. Sneak Peek of Kebos Lowlands 
---
  *  All looking good, can't wait!
---
14. Back to the couch
---
  *  Cheers guys!
---
15. Cannon or no-cannon in the Lizardman dungeon?
---
  *  Hmmm haven't decided yet. Strawpoll: 70% NO, 21% Yes, 9% Don't mind.
---
16. After completing Kourend Elite diary, will dynamite automatically be delivered to bank like Berts sand? 
---
  *  No you'll have to talk to him each day.
---
17. Can the new slayer monsters be killed off-task (not the boss, rather the other stuff like Drakes)
---
  *  Yes. However the uniques are 5x rarer off-task. 
---
18. Are the new slayer monsters unique to Konar? 
---
  *  Only Hydra's - Wyrms and Drakes etc you can expect to see on some other slayer masters tables.
---
19. Will Veos get a new travel option to Kebos Lowlands?
---
  *  No, there are a few new quests coming up which will unlock memoirs teleports. 
---
20. Favourite part of working on Kebos?
---
  *  Munro: All the different items, creating something new with the Dragon Hasta that uses a percentage of special attack which is new and unique. Cool! --- West: World building etc! --- Gee: Making Konar! --- Kieren: Redwood Tree (farming) love it! 
---
21. Will the new prayer boots be able to be used in the dungeon like granite boots?
---
  *  No doesn't really make sense. 
---
22. Will the double fish perk from the diary have a chance to roll the pet, or is it just fish?
---
  *  Just fish.
---
22. Do the Kebos monsters (Wyrm, Drake, Hydra) use dragonfire, can the lore be explained further to explain why they'd be weak to dragon-hunter weapons?
---
 * They don't use D-fire. Lore wise: These weapons (Lance, DHCB) work against creatures that were created by the dragon-kin. The Wyrms, Drakes, Hydras are created by Dragon-kins as failed experiments.
---
24. Lore reason why Konar is so different to the others?
---
  *  The Khalith are effected by their area, like in a radioactive way (glowing eyes, Sulphur mountain etc). Konar is a Matriarch of them. 
---
25. Kieren and West back showing the farming guild!
---
  *  Awesome!
---
26. Back to couch!
---
  *  Redwood and farming guild looks amazing! End of Stream.
---
Jokes on you, I have 72 alts
---
Ive always been told that watever your lowest lvl is makes that your "base lvl" so you can ha e all 99s and 22 in rc
---
What is ur combat level so i can log in?
---
there are posted rules both on reddit here, if you would put in some effort into googling "wyverncc reddit" for the rules, and on discord. We expect members to know the rules and be willing to be kicked if they broke em. It is clearly stated on those pages that the discussion topic "drug use" is banned.   
---
Your attitude towards the kick as stated is about as mature as a 10-yo (Glorifiying bullying, encourages hacking,unjustified banning of accounts for upholding the rules), who are people who also play OSRS, thats why we have to regulate chat with this degree of scrutiny
---
This guy gets it 
---
We also have a guide for various devices and browsers here: [https://osrs.wiki/RS:FIND](https://osrs.wiki/RS:FIND) 
---
Oh man nice! I have a fresh off the island account that I'll be making into a ranging mauler to keep fights a bit simpler. Something I can mull around on while I catch the rest of my stats up in nmz. 
---
Pvp is more enjoyable than I ever thought. Even though I have not won a single fight with a K0. Baby steps lol
---
You can‚Äôt cannon in chasm

Are you sure that you're not confusing it with a falador shield, which is used to restore prayer?
---

---
1000 upvotes
---
So almost all good gear would crash making the bosses less profitable and fun (another reason hardcore players wouldn't like it) and evne then this much cheaper gear wouldn't be used much as dcing exists and is a real bitch.
---
If you want punishing deaths make a hcim btw
---
Old gracefull was so much cooler.
---
Ya rofl he said literally base stats. Never said maxed stats then 22 combat 
---
Cause 2007
---
I am dealing with it, just wondering why it's only 12. Maybe there is a reason for it being that way. And if there is no particular reason, would it be alot of work to increase the limit?
---
Hype!
---
In last Q&amp;A they said their main concern was adding an extra character to usernames and putting new content on the back burner 
---
Did you read your own comment or something?
---
Or did I misunderstand, and you wouldn't have it so you can repeatedly try a boss over and over for free without needing to even get to it? Because those are the two things you're complaining about. 
---
Infernal cape would be a joke if people could just practice zuk 100 times. The reason people like yourself don't have the cape is because it takes time+money to get to even get practice at zuk - removing that removes the achievement when you actually defeat him properly. 
---
Unless you say maxed stats and base 22 combats you are implying base in all stats by saying base. That‚Äôs the definition of based 
---
Just quit... 
---
Where's the off switch on this timeline
---
well if you remove it as a filler drop it increases the drop rate of everything in the game, retard.
---
Looks like shit
---
Yup hahaha waste of $100 for a few karma
---
Let me know when you figure out 2200/23 is 95 lol. He said base stats in post not maxed skills and 22 combat
---
Make sure the clock on your phone (i assume that's where you have the authenticator installed) is 100% accurate. [Check here](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/internettime.html)
---
Yes, but u can boost for the normal ones since u can kill them off task.
---
$70? WUT
---
fighter's torso works with avas and is arguably better than torags
---
bout 50k
---
They're russian chicks, look pretty young from their ig.  This pic is from Dec 2017 and its the only one like it on her account, the rest is basic russian shit
---
Old graceful looked like absolute shit. There is no debate here.
---
Cause 13 is unlucky, silly
---
I think also the lowest combat level you can have in a 2200 world is 103.
---
Thank you sir
---
Yeah thank you. Literally 2 minutes difference between my phone and my computer! 
---
Mega world that has no player limit*
---
world 15 also 
---
#F
---
I also loved it and it has gotten me into progress vids. So far I enjoyed Verfs Karamja ultimate, caveman only and Flippingoldschool's slayer only IM. Any other recommendations? Like maybe a good zeah only series? The one I tried didn't get me interested.
---
You can also set the wiki as a custom search engine in Chrome so you don't need to go to the site to search.
---
Navigate to **Manage search engines** in **Settings.**
---
From there, **Add** a new search engine with whatever keyword you want (I use 'rs'), and use this URL: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/%s
---
So now, when you open a new tab, you just type 'rs' and hit space on your keyboard and it'll automatically change the default search engine to the OSRS Wiki.
---
Credit for this tip goes to /u/Beretot. They posted about it about a year ago on the mostly dead subreddit /r/OSRSProTips
---
Nice 
---
To you and me I agree yes it is very obvious. But they wouldn't work if they didn't fool people. Sadly they do work sometimes. 
---
Don't think I ever got one on rs3 and my slayer was 99 (101 now that it goes to 120, but I quit before then)
---
$70 is like 6 months territory, 3 months should be like $30
---
Probably the ruler of Wakanda at this point... 
---
Imagine not doing birdhouse runs
---
14 would be perfect for me :)
---
First shield half i ever got was in the wildy, got pk'ed 2 minutes later.
---
Cons: even bigger buffs to slayer exp/hour 
---
Pros: /r/slayerscape kids get to kill 500 gargoyles 
---
These idiots are really struggling with the fact 2200/23 is 95.6 lol. 
---
Warm light hands, cold light background

Didn't u post a while ago when u had only like 8 acbs? feelsbadman

I've got some good news for you! Unless you hate cannons...

Yeah isn't the 3 month membership only $30? I'm so confused why I have this massive debt when I already canceled &gt;:(

You skipped over the first half of my comment. The old wiki is prone to errors or outdated information. You can do whatever you want, I'm not your mom, but the push to move is a collective team effort to make things easier for everybody as a whole.
---
2200 is by 77 less than max. So he substracted that 77 from single skill, hence 99-77 = 22.
---
Second this
---
Haha my guess would be coding. Basically the main reason why you can‚Äôt change something in osrs. Like the max cash can be changed but would require a lot more work than it‚Äôs worth, I figure it‚Äôs the same with the names
---
Just get runelite me boy

Dont think he is, I have seen a lot of people with that shield too

I just posted this on another thread, but I think it's helpful to add to this stickied post.

99x22 + 1x22 . Not sure what you are talking about.

I finished Trimmed Comp before I moved over to OSRS. That itself is only 5k hours, normal Comp probably 2k hours playing casually. He doesn't really know what he's talking about.

If someone says base 60s they have all skills at 60 now all 60 except one skill at lets say 25 or whatever. Jesus Christ lol..
---
why are your comments so weird sometimes
---
No way it'd pass, people are already freaking out about how overpowered Nech and Dust Devil tasks are
---
Killing men in Edgeville and banking the bones is also decent if you seriously have no clue what to do. 
---
New graceful is just as ugly if not uglier.
---
The only difference is that now it's ugly in 7 colors
---
and we're only 3 days in &lt;3

Old graceful has grey gems. At chest and leg. 
---
Do you understand the concept of a joke?
---
i wonder how long they were getting away with it for
---
Best achievement cape in the game!
---
Gets you 9 Hunter in a few minutes. You will regret not training all your skills. You might not feel the effects for a while, but they will come. 
---
Do birdhouses ( YouTube a guide) for easy Hunter xp. Those alone will get you to 99 before most other skills. 
---
And 70 mage cause it's a combat stat ;)
---
Yeah so we can get 15 fps everywhere just like in mushroom grove. 
---
Hot take right here
---
There are already two hunting pets
---
Soisit 20 or 30. Even with 20 people, if not a single one of them supports your definition of base, it already means something. And talking about community, search base in reddit posts, you'll find lots of posts using not your definition.
---
You mean to tell me this person has a dick?

ive yet to see a cat that doesnt make me go aww

Strange, I could swear he said something like "I don't have bank notes for that time". Maybe I was just too sleepy, will try again tomorrow.

Thank god for that agility shortcut. Even though I have to sip an agility potion to use it right now, so much better.
---
Oooh gotcha. I'll do that tonight then! And haha you are correct. I kinda meant to say melee's but y'know..whatevs :p

i currently use it. Just saying the official client should have this feature

Sure thing pleb. I‚Äôll get right on that homework assignment

That site is absolute cancer with its ads, I was almost in disbelief. I rarely do much browsing on my phone aside from reddit, so I don‚Äôt care to have any kind of Adblock. That site is completely disgusting with it though, they should be fucking ashamed.

On the one hand, please don't 'snitch' on reddit, too many reportable things.  On the other hand, please yes snitch to tipoff@jagex.com or report in game.

It's not supposed to be great, the monsters that get a roll on that are either easy slayer monsters that shouldn't have good drops or monsters that have a suitably rewarding drop table of their own that you can also get drops from (though it's worth to note that the items on many monsters drop tables average to be worth *less* than the 8.5 k average of the rare drop table items). It was only ever designed to be rewarding during long tasks as a cumulative thing and to provide a break in the monotony of a slayer task by providing different items at times.
---
Having said that, the sheer number of blank spaces on it has always been stupid, they should just remove most of them and leave a couple as placeholders in case they want to add new items to it later. 
---
Having said that, if they buffed it even slightly, it would pump a lot of extra money into the game fairly quickly, causing some serious inflation. We would need a suitable money sink to be added at the same time for it to not imbalance the game even more. It's probably best to leave it where it is right now and only change it after a money sink is added.
---
Thank you!

It's nice to see videos from someone who isn't desperately stretching their sentences and repeating themselves to make the video 10 minutes

I wonder what the achivement diary item will bs
---
This is probably pretty accurate.
---
 Basal Metabolic Rate (The amount of energy to run your brain and keep you alive) doesn‚Äôt really vary too much from activity to activity. BMR is roughly 70 KCal/hour (for an average sized 20-25 year old M). Any sort of light activity such as desk work, talking, or general seated movements only boost the calories you burn by about 30 Kcal/hour. That includes clicking, talking, typing, or whatever else you might be doing in that hour. 
---
I have no idea how bonds or any of that works, nor do I know how someone got into my account. However, this does seem like to the most logical answer. Thanks for your help, I just changed my password and enabled the authenticator as well. Hopefully they respond soon and I can get this sorted out. Thanks a lot.
---
I've been wanting to start gwd, do you think I could do it with ~80 base combat stats? I'm familiar with barrows, mole, kbd, and dagganoth Rex but I'm trying to start doing some more advanced bosses

And that would be his base skill level. If the lowest skill level is 22, then all of his skills are 22 or above, which makes it a base level.
---
Yes should be fine
---
Watch out!  You‚Äòll trigger the osrs kids with facts that dont support their: ‚Äûrs3 bad!‚Äú ideology 
---
Rs3 items go by actual item values because you know that makes sense where as ge is fucking stupid for multiple reasons
---
Of course it will be more effective to use the minimum gear but not by much, most people will still use the best as it's not that punishing and if you have the best you're gonna have the money for it anyway 
---
Yeah yeah I get it, were being all technical 
---
Try getting a little creative man, jeez.
---
I never said victims don‚Äôt wait to report crimes. I just said that, to many people, and especially in court rooms, unless there‚Äôs evidence, nothing is gonna go through. In the end the victim will be scrutinized due to the fact they waited so long and many people will judge from the outside. 
---
I‚Äôve never been in that position, but I complete reports very often regarding these issues and unless there is real evidence or a confession, it‚Äôs not going anywhere.
---
This is my first ever Visage since playing RuneScape since 2004, I'm legit so happy I got this on the Iron man! 
---
Well... he specified females.
---
pic?
---
I can't tell if the problem with the hammer is the speed, the crush bonus or the strength bonus.
---
Disagree, your design is fucking edgy for no reason. Right is respectable templar knight.
---
Honestly deadman seasonals and tournaments is by far the best viewing experience, especially if you go really hard while at the same time upload daily (yes, that is crazy difficult)
---
Secondly, I think HC ironman is really fun to watch, I‚Äôm not that into these crazy niche accounts but hey thats just me
---
Yea it's all good. Atleast we can agree on each other's view and understand the points being made, unlike someone...
---
&gt;You‚Äôd lose qol due to no suffering, probably also take more dmg in the process.
---
So lets use pegs then, for a 1.5% DPS difference. I'm now killing an extra zulrah every ~3 hours, based on DPS.
---
&gt;With arma you‚Äôd take less dmg, which means more dps because you don‚Äôt have to eat as much. You‚Äôd also save money on food and prayer.
---
You don't lose dps from eating on Zulrah outside of unlucky mage-combos, which you'd know if you had good experience with the boss. Only eat during down phases when it's switching. 
---
With that being said, you can't actually be serious with this argument; while on a boss that hits you with mage (which, coincidentally, we don't really *have* in this game, or if we do, we pray against it anyway) you'd have a point, but Zulrah only does damage with range. Armadyl and D'hide has almost the exact same ranged defense (helm is same, chest and legs is 2 less). The difference is actually smaller than the offensive bonus difference. It's magic defense that Arma is *big* for.
---
&gt;In addition, you can stay longer because you have faster kills, and take less dmg so you‚Äôd save time on banking.
---
No, you wouldn't notice the difference at all. Losing out on 1.5% dps and ~3% ranged defence is not actually going to cause a noticeable impact on your kills per trip or kill speed; Especially due to the "all hits above 50 are converted to 48-50"-rule that zulrah has. Unless the difference is big enough that you consistently get an extra kill per trip, nothing changes except you might shave a few seconds off of a kill here and there resulting in, as stated earlier, an extra kill in the grand scheme of things every few hours.
---
&gt;Overall you‚Äôd probably get 15% more kills per hour using bis. And in your example it‚Äôs not even bis vs non bis, you‚Äôre still using a tbow and pegs and anguish, although they are kept on death.
---
Based on what numbers. Please, please oh god, what numbers. I'm using 3x items that are kept on death because they obviously wouldn't be risked; That is how the game has always worked. But how you get a 3% ranged defence and a 1.5% ranged offense to equal to 15% more kills per hour, I cannot even remotely fathom. That number *has* to be based on nothing but "I want to win this argument, so I'm pulling a reasonably low number that still seems impressive from my ass". 
---
&gt;If you can afford bis, you probably know the bosses and you are willing to take the risk to use bis because you can afford it and would rather take the slightly faster kills and QOL.
---
Depends on server stability and general confidence. But yea, that'd be the one use case - you're already so good at the boss that you never die so you can whip out the minmax gear. Gee, it'd be a shame to actually be able to use your best gear to learn how to do the boss without worrying about losing tons of money. Can't have that.

Nice, I post a full story about my 10 year journy to ranger boots and it gets 2 upvotes. You post the shittiest screenshot ever of a drop that is hardly worth anything. Hundreds of upvotes and front page.

It's still making a shit ton of money that you'd be retarded to dismiss it

It definitely would've helped.

Couldn‚Äôt agree more!

For bursting though.

You can't have full endgame content without reaching the end of the game. That means getting maxxed. 
---
Or a thing to call bankrupt 
---
They don't. The spikes are much much smaller. Spikes that big like in the picture are bad weapon design. You hit something with it, great, good luck taking it that out of the corpse before someone else comes to hack you to death.

My apologies, forgot they were a 2010 thing, and when I checked the wiki it said 07 (But I think it was showing the Dark Bows release date, even though I was on a coloured one's page)

Still I don't mind either graceful, and I like having my disgusting green man outfit.

I just type what I want to lookup into Google and the old wiki is there with what I wanna know

Thanks for the help

I always liked the concept of it hitting twice every attack cycle, but yeah even with that it would need a decent accuracy and strength buff to ever be close to viable.

The other thing they can do is buff the set bonus and the amulet of the damned bonus so it actually does something in PvM.

Old graceful looks like it was already in the game in 2007.

Were you at north chamber or south? If it‚Äôs north fine, but if it‚Äôs south the only purpose of using that chamber is to AFK, so you were crashing him. He might be toxic but it probably gets annoying getting crashed all the time because he‚Äôs an iron

I really don't like the modern graphics in oldschool. Just look at raids 1, inferno, and zeah they use too many polygons in the walls and environment which not only looks ugly and out of place compared to 99% of the rest of the game, but it also drastically increases requirements of the game (although not as much of an issue anymore thanks to 3rd party clients gpu / opengl mode) In zeah especially, you can see all the walls of the houses are like 2 tiles thick and use so many polygons for every brick, which looks very busy and ugly without anti aliasing (which oldschool doesnt officially support) compare that to the rest of the game where walls are like 1/4th of a tile thick, and usually use textures (althuogh you can see even in 2007 jagex was moving towards polygons for walls as you can see in varrock / falador remakes)
---
Equipment like graceful, justiciar, dragon hunter lance, almost all of the ornament kits are so complex or weird looking it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the armors and weapons. Just look at something simple like barrows or a whip and they are just really simple, which is what we want in oldschool. All the new weapons use much smoother animations also. Look at the rapier animation it's out of place compared with all the other weapons which use very simple animations.
---
In all their weapons and and armor you can see they are at or near the polygon limit that the game can handle which is just stupid and makes the game harder to run. Especially since the game is now on mobile, having more complex graphics means faster battery drain.
---
Another example of how Artists on oldschool seem out of touch with the community is the fact they made the eoc version of the staff of light, which I am 100% convinced that 99,99% of people who voted on it were expecting the pre-eoc version of it.
---
I am not an 3d artist by any means but this is oldschool, and we want oldschool graphics. If the artists can not deliver the graphics that the players want, they should be fired, or they need to change their style. If they move to simpler graphics they can also put out updates faster with the same level or higher polish while looking better in the oldschool engine.

During slayer, definitely use slaughter over tormented bracelet. Extending the task will boost your xp a lot more than the minor buff from tormented bracelet (assuming you‚Äôre talking Dust Devils, Nechs, and Smoke Devils)

Not anymore, they inexplicably banned "NSFW" content.

Which means they banned Tumblr.

I want it for sure, although there's some uncomfortably high runecrafting skill required on a couple diaries.

I do vorkath without a bgs, I avg 2:20 kills with addy darts, 95 range and rigour tho. Even before rigour and at a lower range level my kills maxed at like 3:30. You should be fine w just a blowpipe, 50 kills won't take very long.

---
&gt;You want to use bis with no risk. It‚Äôs ok to lose money, they game already has too much money and items.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs ok to have another sink. Feel free to use bis, but expect to pay a price for it. If you are charged approx 500k more to get your 80m more in gear back, that‚Äôs good for the game.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt want to lose an extra 500k? Don‚Äôt bring it.
---
I never said any of these things, so feel free to go reread. 
---
I said I think the current value that's still removing billions from the game on release of new content is perfectly fine. I don't think it needs to further punish players. Right now if you don't count in team raiding (because fuck doing team based stuff in RS), you're likely going to peak at 4M/hr for money-earning potential, so a death removing 100K cash and ~5 minutes worth of time spent failing a kill+retrieving gear and setting up inventory again is about 430K lost. A player that's less good at the boss and with worse gear will comparatively lose less (because they might only be making 2M/hr, making it a 250K loss). 
---
To a player, the current death mechanics at bosses with cash-loss on death is perfectly fine because it already scales with player skill/gear/level, because the better you are, the more you as a player are losing out on by wasting time being dead. The chunk of cash serves as a barrier to keep people that can't afford to invest anything from learning the boss, making the content semi-exclusive.
---
Wanting a player to lose out on a fifth of an hours work (500K cash+330K from time wasted) for a death seems excessive to me. 
---
&gt;You‚Äôre arguing that the difference in bis vs non bis is barely anything. If that‚Äôs the case it doesn‚Äôt even matter what gear you use, so why does it even matter if u can‚Äôt use your bis because of the extra risk?
---
You're sort of getting the point but you can't seem to grasp it. The point is that if this becomes a thing where it's better to use the gear that's a percentage point of the price because a single death will offset the value gained from the extra speed (again, refer to the fact that wearing BiS on zulrah worth 80M will net you an extra kill every 3-4 hours, depending on setup, on average, profitting about 140K from that kill), the "good" gear will crash in value, because only people that are already confident enough in bosses that they'd never be affected by this because they do not die, or people who do not care about money, would use it. That crashes the value of high end gear, which crashes the value of PvM'ing, yada yada. I don't think this is a good thing. Feel free to disagree.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre saying It would be a shame not to be able to use your best gear while at the same time saying the best gear hardly matters. So if the gear doesn‚Äôt matter then why does not being able to use it with no risk matter?
---
Because it feels good to get a perceived power increase. That's how games work; Having something to work towards that increases our characters power, however slight, is what drives a lot of people. It's why people go for 99 strength, despite the fact that you might not even get a consistent +1 max hit extra except for at specific boosted potion levels. 
---
It's like asking why people go for 99 woodcutting when everything is unlocked at 90; It's a boost to our character's progression. It doesn't do much, but some people still like to chase the miniscule increases. 
---
Ahrims staff is actually better for bursting since it gives a small damage boost.
---
I'd rank them Kodai &gt; SotD &gt; Ahrims &gt; Master. Honestly though autocasting whilst bursting tasks is overrated, since I don't have a kodai on my zerk I just leave my iron darts equipped and click each cast, all the stuff in the zeah cave is low mage def anyways so you won't ever miss a cast.
---
Nope.

Where‚Äôs the NSFW tag?!

Just started playing OSRS and I was wondering what that armour was that literally everyone is wearing.

Hah ya a lot of people don‚Äôt get how it works but in reality it‚Äôs easy money. I made like 500k chillin in f2p alching  while doing stuff around the house lol. Thanks to mobile

Most people's reasons for leveling runecrafting are for the diaries, so it's kind of a chicken before the egg kind of situation. There's not really much of a point in getting runecrafting up aside from diaries, so people that have a reason to do diaries are going to get the xp lamps, and use it on the skill that they Pike the lead to takes the longest to level, which is often runecrafting.
---
Pretty sure you have to submit this on the website somehow.
---
Os.wiki is even shorter than that!! Although it doesn‚Äôt work:(
---
For me it's because the duckduckgo bang !osrs still goes to the old one

Unlock upper floor before getting prospector. Everyone makes the most sense of getting the outfit first, the xp rates are wildly different top floor vs bottom floor while outfit only gives 5% boost.

I only play on mobile. I have a tor browser installed maybe it could be that?

Spectral is still basically useless outside cerb and maybe dks (tho even there there are better alternatives)
---
Hahaha. I remember that conkere guy too. And actually I do remember the timeline a bit now somehow. I believe it was probably exactly around the 3 week mark when whips dropped below 10m. Because I sold that whip i pked (i actually pked several whips the first month it was released, mostly from using the g maul but a a couple were from pking with whip itself. I had sold all the whips i pked when they were above 15m still then i believe i kept one and used it to pk with. 
---
Ah man those days were golden. Back before barrows gloves and torso and all the prod shit. Back before tick manipulation and combo eats to full hp from 1 lol. More nostalgia, remember the clan TLP? (The last pures) hiei the pk (the leader I think) was a good friend of mine but i hated this dude named Finnald in the clan. This is back when NH pking was frowned upon by many, and i was a big voice on tip.it about not using tele runes/prayer/safing. I bring up Finnald because I had a feud going with him but I pked him several times and twice i smited him for whip. This was well after the specs had gotten nerfed though. If you remember I mahatma I, got a whip off him too :P. Was pretty funny, my stats werent great. I wasnt a pure at all, and i think i rocked 60 def for a while. However i got tons of fights and some good kills because i pked a certain way (not safing/never NHing) and when you lured people into not eating when youre low health thats how i got so many kills. Monkey 933 was my tip.it tag. Maybe someone remembers that lol. This was a looong time ago though haha.
---
It would be cool but based on what they've said in the past it would probably take a crazy amount of dev time and then still result in game breaking bugs.

 I‚Äôm 2 roles away from this also unlocking piety. Wish I could say my gear is as good as yours it‚Äôs close but not there yet. Keep up the hard work.

Less pray pots and some combo food

I love getting on reddit to see people tell other people how to live

In true RuneScape fashion, let's poll it again!

yeah thanks ill try it

I don't like the new wiki.

It's harder to use.

Aint fix don't break it.

You're not wrong, but when you start the fight hes not enraged. I went ahead and bought an Elder maul and learned the 2step method instead of the 4step hasta method. Managed to kill the Tekton in challenge mode with 0 dwh specs hit.

I think my learnings here are the zammy hasta is literal dog shit for solo raids. Thank you and all the others who commented anyway, at least I wasn't doing anything "wrong" as such.

There used to be a brew rdt drop in pre eoc

It has been a while since we‚Äôve had a good Jmod smackdown. I say summon the mods!!

Alching seriously brings in a fuckload on money into the game.
---
Everyday I buy my battlestaves from Zaff, turn them into air battlestaves, and then alch them while doing agility. This is about 130k new gold added to the game per day.
---
When I do slayer I alch most of the drops, that could easily turn into 1m new gp.
---
Sometimes I google which items alch for profit and that sometimes ends up in 10m+ new go added in a day.
---
Hundreds of thousands of people play this game and are likely doing similar things
---
I‚Äôm erect 
---
Wow. I don't feel so bad on my account hiking of doing the kill
---
lmao it hurts tho
---
Rune items are ~30k sometimes, most resources and drops that aren't useful armor and weapons will eventually make it's way to someone's alch pile. Every one and log has a good chance of being processed by production skills and alched.
---
One of you is going to end up getting a majority of the drops so almost everyone will consider this crashing and it‚Äôs very annoying.
---
Kinda both. I enjoyed slaying stuff (particularly in wildy), but I also spent fair amount of time in nmz.

Go to runescape official site, go to your account and check your message centre. The email is probably a scam and whatever you do don't click that link.

The good ol days.

My biggest regret in this game was way back when i used the rfd 20k lamp on slayer. Really missing that now that im 3 levels shy of 77.

Farming is good for this. You can grow ranarrs and make 600k-1m per day if you keep on top of it.

I work at home, i play while working and I started with mobile. At first I did NMZ and got 99 str and 75 in attack magic defence and ranged. Since then I afk slayer, up to 81 now with 90 attack, 83 defence, ranged and 80 magic mostly all from slayer

As a matter of fact I did go back to toontown! Jagex has not earned my $.70 today, and will not during any other day that they choose to impede the games playability like they have today. They may as well have taken all the servers down at once; I‚Äôm done with runescape for the day.  As for the servers, I have absolutely 0 hope that this will fix any of the problems that currently exist. It‚Äôll likely be only a bandaid when a replacement is needed. Also, you‚Äôre a cunt!
