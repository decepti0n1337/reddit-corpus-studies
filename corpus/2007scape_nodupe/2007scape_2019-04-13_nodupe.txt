I could run 50 accounts by hand and make what he makes per day in 4 hours. If you wanted to get real crazy, you could even do that and have each account do farm runs at the same time once an hour. Not sure if worth, and I could literally be brain dead the entire time doing it, with absolute no risk, or "real" attention, yes you'd constantly be doing -things-, but if you were to look away, or stop at any time for any reason, your accounts wouldn't explode.

What about the brainlets that pronounce scimitar like "skimitar"
---
DHCB is really good as well, and you can employ 2 different tactics...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1) 2:0. Start at a far side, start running as the head is turning towards you. Attack with the blowpipe after crossing the mid "line" (So you're attacking as head is turning to middle), instantly continue running, and attack with the DHCB in the far safespot. Rinse, repeat. Doing it this way, Olm will never attack you and the only damage you'll take will come from falling rocks. Do this if you're running low on supplies, or while learning.
---
2) 4:1. Start at a far side, start running as the head is turning towards you. Attack with the DHCB after crossing the mid "line". Continue running, and wait for a tick for the head to turn. Walk 2 tiles out, attack again, then run again to the middle line (You'll take a hit here).  Attack once as the head turns to middle, run to the side you started at, and attack again. As soon as the XP drops for that last attack, rinse and repeat. Doing it this way you'll attack every 5 ticks (max speed for DHCB/Twisted bow), and only take 1 hit for every 4 that you do. This is a bit more advanced, since you have to deal with olms attacks (and occasionally "special" attacks like acid / flame wall / etc.) so uses more supplies... But deals better DPS.
---
Also, if you're using ruby bolts, switch to the blowpipe method you've been using for the last \~ 20% (Unless you bring a bolt switch, which I wouldn't really recommend).
---
As far as equipment... Bandos/d'hide/ahrim &gt; void. Really the only times you should be using void in CoX is when you're first learning team raids (So you can bring more brews/less swaps into Olm) and possibly when no-prepping team raids (since you'll need the extra space to bring more brews and such in)... Tho I have no experience in the latter, and for no-prep solo raids it isn't necessary (Most layouts you'll get a few brews from vasa/muttadiles/vespula/whatever to augment/replace whatever you use during the raid).
---
Sure man, get that next bond. Here is the price check I was going off of if you're interested

So what is it that you think happened? What did jagex do that allowed someone to gain access to your account?
---
I agree, news outlets like the Varrock Herald unjustly slam King Roald. He is just making a joke and they run off with it. It's people like them that are ruining Varrock.
---
I have no clue what happened, that’s why I’m trying to talk to them about it.
---
The fact that it didn’t happen to my main and was only this account which was set up for my mrs when I was teaching her the game is what has me stumped.
---
What is your top 100 list?

Let it come through! It makes it more bar ballad. I love it

---
Encouraging, I'm doing everything on mobile only cuz my laptop broke. About to kill vorkath tonight.
---
Mobile is practically unplayable for me. I don't know how so many people do it. All the clickboxes are microscopic, the menus are on opposite sides of the screen, it takes 3 years to right click something, it drains my battery 10x faster than any other app, and it makes my phone too hot to touch (even with fps limited to the lowest). It's easier to just use a remote desktop app and use my phone to control my pc, but honestly it's not worth even thinking about RS for the whole day. I even tried the NMZ thing that only requires just a couple clicks every 20 minutes and even that is enough to distract me from things that actually matter.
---
I guess this is getting off topic but that's just what came to mind when I saw a mobile post.
---
I myself had a friend pass in his sleep not but a few weeks ago.

The GE price/estimate takes time stabilizing to the actual price, because the GE estimate/price can't increase/decrease more than a few % every day, to avoid showing prices of the items changing in price by a lot, which could be a sign of people flipping them or trying to manipulate the market. At some point, the GE price/estimate will get close to the actual price. Until someone or people start trying to change the price by dumping all their items or by holding them.
---
Seems to have stopped for everyone. Must not have been automatic and was manually forced pushed out which someone got lazy and stopped doing. It’s sad I miss them.
---
What bosses should i use in NMZ for xp?  I read the wiki and it suggest a few, including the boss from haunted mine.  Problem is that boss teleports after you hit it, which messes with my xp/h.  So now im doubting the quality of that list, so im hoping someone can give me the list that they use.
---
Thank you for taking the time. I’m just so overwhelmed with everything and the people who’ve stopped to pay respect to someone they didn’t know, but a man well worthy of it. Just gives me hope for a better tomorrow.
---
This is every level for me for like the past 7 years

Why do care so much about ranger boots? They have only +1 higher ranged bonus than god dhide boots, but with worse defense and no prayer bonus.
---
Right now it’s just so hard to see how. I’m just trying to be strong for his wife and his family and get them through this time. He was always my rock and I just want to pay them the same.

What bosses should i use in NMZ for melee xp?

They do plan on fixing the engine...
---
They have 1 person working on warding..
---
And I'd love to see it.. They need new content to keep players... deal with it.
---
yup, but that's how new items are, especially ones that don't have much function besides fun.
---
for how much I lost, I could have dropped some real 3rd age items lol
---
I understand your concern, but you underestimate how much attack speed affects dps. As someone else pointed out the sword would compete with whip at Graardor, but one you fight anything with lower defence it will fall flat. 5 tick weapons need these kinds of stats, or have a special effect, to be useful in PvM. Just look at the leaf-bladed sword, even with the stats you mentioned they needed to add a huge damage bonus to it vs. Turoth and Kurask for it to be good.
---
PvP is a different story of course, and it would be really powerful there, though that could be offset by having it be high-cost.
---
I just hope through all this pain, he’s at peace. I never knew much about epilepsy and the absolute toll it places on peoples lives. Thank you to everyone for your kind words. It means more than any of you know.

I am soooo glad the "runez scazmatar" meme is making its comeback!
---
There's plenty of things that have multiple teleports, or at least very close teleports:
---
1. Kourend Castle has like 3 (Xeric's Talisman, Standard Spellbook TP, Diary Cape)
---
2. Barbarian Outpost has 2 very close teleports (Games Necklace and Lunar TP)
---
3. Waterbirth Island (Lunar TP and Enchanted Lyre)
---
4. Fishing Guild (Lunar TP and Skills Necklace)
---
These are just a couple of examples. There are plenty of other similar spots with multiple teleport options
---
Like barehanded impling catching type stuff?
---
Just north of the stronghold over the first bridge, then on the first chunk of land
---
Four. The new one references the original three, making it a fourth video about it.
---
I feel like our option would be hd/not at that point right now. I'd prefer to keep the old graphics for now.
---
I cant tell if this is a joke or you are actually this stupid. If you see they have an item to scam you in their inventory do not accept the stake?
---
You know what while were at it we should get rid of seeing what were trading other people, them being able to see me trading cash for their item allows them to decline and just scam someone who does not. If they cant see whether im paying or not they cant scam me.
---
eh. graceful set effect isn't very useful in the first place so its no big deal. the weight reducing is the major part and he had more than enough. the set effect doesnt work when running which is what you do 99% of the time you'd think you'd need graceful
---
Just luck.

Near gwd dungeon?
---
I think retiering gear and adding more bosses for said gear should be the way we go, but we won’t because people are terrified of it becoming rs3. We will miss out on a lot of potential content by keeping lvl 65/70 gear as BiS forever.
---
This would be really convenient, but at the same time I think it'd crash head prices and make Prayer a lot cheaper.  Lots of people don't bother picking them up since they can eat up inventory space.
---
Gotta put your OS in English, I remember having this problem
---
I think he means ensouled head bag
---
Tbh, a good fix, and I don’t know why it wasn’t originally designed this way, was just making weapons/armor degradable. Maybe, *maybe*, with a high level smithing to make an undegradable/untradable variant. We already have metric fuck tons of metal armors coming into the game, so there wouldn’t be a “shortage” of rune plate bodies, it basically wouldn’t effect PKers because fights last for such a short time in comparison to grinding activities or levels, it would be an item sink without creating gold via high alchs, and the average price of rune items would likely go up, making slaying/smithing more profitable
---
catching anglers is useless, catching black chins is useless, cooking the highest tier foods without a chance of burning is useless, according to you.
---
Awful examples.
---
This is why you do Tithe Farm asap
---
People here don't seem to understand the difference between something being logical and something being playable/enjoyable. Very little in this game is logical, yet, it's very fun.
---
I'm glad 99% of the awful game breaking RS3 style suggestions people make on this sub get ignored. Once you start fucking with the time tested underpinnings of this game, it too will die.
---
Who are you arguing with?
---
my funny story with them was that I clanned with their guitar player way back in the day. been years since I've seen him but heard he was in fit for rivals now
---
Your friend may be a complete moron. How do you see players running around in full graceful, all the fucking time and not notice a pair of boots on them that match the rest of the outfit and clearly look like they’re apart of the set. 
---
Also when he bought his graceful, did he not see that there is only a few more items in the shop besides the top, bottoms, cape and hood? Seems like he may have a mental disability? Poor guy. I hope he doesn’t get bullied in school. Tell him I said H-I, B-U-D-D-Y :)
---
Yeah or fish, but in this instance its reverse update. It makes sense
---

---
Where’s the fun in that
---
&gt; I feel like too many people would just freak out, saying it's not "2007scape"  enough.
---
Technically speaking, the Grand Exchange also shouldn't be in 2007scape as well, but enough people wanted it enough for them to add it. I don't put much weight in the people who claim that something is not "2007scape" enough.

---
I doubt adding another teleport to Falador Park will be game breaking. The cape has some decent requirements, I think it would be fine with another thematic teleport.
---
the only tip i needed to beat him was to always pray range on jad until you hear the magic sound, then go back to range pray once the sound is over. makes it feel like theres only half as much going on because you just keep attacking if he does a range stomp. also to use F keys to switch between menus but that should be obvious. 
---
other than that its just overthinking thats the problem.

---
I mean these are the same people that when they wanted to pretend they always loved Kanye West had to research him on Wikipedia for an hour.
---
I can only tolerate 10 minutes then I don't touch it for a couple months. Runecrafting XP waste.
---
I didn’t say anything about putting it at 40 or changing anything, I just wouldn’t mind them reworking it so dragon is higher than rune. Whatever they’d use for that

It's a good thing I have a mouse tbh

Case in point, mobile at work doing some afk bull shit and I hadn't read the poll blog (or read most of the minigame wiki pages let alone played them, don't worry I skipped those).
---
I put a reminder in my phone and went back amd voted about an hour ago
---
actually went and unlocked them and gonna be testing now, bank doesnt seem to be too far from the 3 crab spot I found although i dont have 21 construction yet and cant make it, So far seems really good but not sure when compared to NMZ
---
Sure, 
---
With one kill, the probability of getting the pet is 1-(1-1/65)^1 which is the same as 1-(64/65)^1
---
For two kills, that exponent becomes 2. So the chance to get the pet in two kills would be 1-(64/65)^2
---
So your chances of getting the pet in 45 kills is 1-(64/65)^45 which equals .502 or 50.2%
---
If you search “drop rate” on the osrs wiki, it explains it a little more in depth
---
what str level would you leave it at?
---
Amazing content
---
Level 60
---
Considering bones aren't noted and they give less XP I don't see that many people getting on board with it. They made is so you can cast the reanimate spells where you get the drop at least, just need portals in your house and house tabs to get around efficient ly while on the spell book. 
---
And I'd say make it the backpack from ghost busters instead haha
---
"All we had to do, was follow the damn train, CJ!"
---
60 for a dragon sq, 94 for a rune sq is even more drastic
---
That's a veeery dangerous like to walk
---
?
---
Idk I play on mobile 95% of the time. Granted I’m not bossing but I’ve pretty easily hit a total level of 1300. As a working dad I just don’t have time to sit in front of a computer but I can do quite a bit on my phone at this stage of the game

Yeah, god d'hide is good... Not only for the ranged bonus, but the pray bonus can be helpful as well. You'll definitely want both for Jad.

If I'm not obsessing about trying to get the best, most effecient, or even most usable interface. Because when I say RS isn't that important to me, I'm not trying to be rude. I mean I genuinely don't want it to be important to me, or it could take up too much of my time.

I'd rather have it be something I can play when there's literally nothing else I could be doing, because then I can play it guilt free and actually enjoy it.

I tried one, didn't bother installing it on my other computer, and somehow the fact that I don't play the game enough to require those extra features is a problem to you?

l lz marie is a player moderator.

He could at the very minimum kick the player since the player is in his cc but considering he's a pmod there's no reason why they shouldn't have been muted. I get screwing around having fun but there's a line.

He is not a player mod, he is a general in zezimas clan chat he has no power except maybe to kick that guy.

You can get a new task from the slayer master in Burthorpe
---
Exactly, if they would of just stuck to their roots and realized what the players actually liked about the game, and improved on that, instead of pushing out one of the biggest and most controversial updates in RS history.
---
I really don't expect rs3 mobile to revive the game at all, it's too off-putting for new players, while osrs, especially mobile is easy to grasp and understand hence the quadruple player count.
---
Oh and it doesn't cost 30 slayer points?

Get a task from Tureal if you can't do the hell hounds. He's the only master that can assign a task when you already have one. Otherwise you can safespot them. You can google safespots
---
Try kill a few in budget gear (so if you get PKed, you dont lose anything). If you have a spare 40K, buy a ring of wealth scroll in GE to imbue a ring of wealth and you will get a ton of hard clue.
---
Stolen 🤷‍♂️
---
Nope. You get one free change per task from Turael
---
Well id assume to just allows higher level xp and sooner (as in, its the same xp per bar based on metal) but that will probably hurt the bums of a few max capes
---
yeah i just installed it. it's awesome.
---
no. it just resets your streak. dont use krystallia unless you know you can kill every potential assignment as she doesn't check combat level when giving tasks. so you can be cl10 and still end up needing to kill 40 lava dragons
---
Runecrafting higher then my slayer? Agility highest non combat skill? Whatt
---
It makes sense for dragon plate to be lower smithing than rune because you're just attaching pieces to a chainmail instead of making it from scratch, so changing like that just for "consistency" doesn't add up.

or even like what if you receive their bank after extremely reasonable evidence, this would still make bots a problem tho right? bc all the influx of items generated by bots they would rather remove them idk what do you think

Is this game an alternate timeline of Runescape without EoC and all the other bullshit changes?
---
OR
---
Is it a nostalgia trip and essentially meant to remain as close to the original state as possible without groundbreaking changes?

I'm ok with either TBH. But I wouldn't know which one the community prefers and I'm not sure Jagex does either.

Distractions and diversions were one of the most insidious pieces of content ever added to the game. With things like MTX, double xp weekends and EOC, you quickly found out whether you liked them or disliked them, but D&amp;D felt like a fun little break from grinding until you eventually developed the subconscious feeling that their existence just served to punish you for every day that you were unable to log in or felt like doing something else.
---
It was a pity because the individual concepts behind some of them were very interesting. I fondly remember going to my house to use the telescope and try to find out where the shooting star was going to crash and then rushing to the location so I could mine it before other people finished it. They could add something similar to OSRS, but not as a once-a-day-only activity.
---
100 KC with no pet. Alch yourself.

You're supposed to use the dragonfire ward while ranging. It has a - 10 magic accuracy so you wouldn't be complaining that you are punished for using magic with that shield would you?

If you actually use your axe to cut trees during a tree run, you're doing it wrong. Just pay the 200gp to have it instantly removed.

Never got more than 125k from my elites. Gotten several 1m+ hards, and nothing decent from my elites
---
Also done 8 f2p begginer clues on my main have now made over 4m. Done 3 on my f2p hcim and got random shit but its been great on my main account especially since im f2p for a bit now.
---
If it overrides your PVM gear then its rs3.
---
yo this vid those shrugs

Yea i see im mostly f2p anyways didn't realize about the clues lol.
---
Not that I know of unfortunately.

They're pretty well known... you ruined a sweet comment chain

I suppose. But even on my main I wouldn't want to waste money getting favour. Just seems pointless to me.

It was interesting in theory with the different houses being in conflict; but terrible in practice.

When or if I finally make it out to the UK some day, going to a show out there is totally in the plans. Seeing them at a festival would probably be ideal too. They put on such a good show and they're all so genuine, in a crowd full of strangers I always feel welcome and in some kind of family.

5 plots and planting on the same lap you harvest for even less chill &gt;:D

because people usually want a goal to work towards when skilling. Woodcutting gives you Redwood trees, crafting gives you zenyte, herb gives you really good pots etc while smithing gives you nothing even if you go higher.
---
Well now when you put it like that 😀

Smithing gives you a max cape.

Tfw soy is among the highest natural sources of phytoestrogen in the world which are viable ligands for estrogen receptors, yielding estrogenic changes in the body (they're made by certain plants as a defense mechanism against mammals)
---
Tfw soy is very high in polyunsaturated fat which causes excessive lipid peroxidation in your entire body (and your balls) which obliterates testosterone
---
Tfw whole milk is high in estrogen due to unsustainable factory agriculture in the West only, and countries like Mongolia who don't abuse their animals have milk with less bioactive hormones. Even so, hormones are lipid soluble so reduced fat milk barely has any estrogen left
---
Tfw being fat as fuck (these two) turns your testosterone into estrogen and increases estrogen receptor density
---
Yeah I was/am still using it. Everyone had the report option, even that person. Once you clicked it, however, it wouldn't continue to the reporting prompt. I got a streamer in here to check it out and they couldn't either. We got the players name tho and a screenshot.
---
it should be easy to secure your account and a pain in the ass to recover it, not the other way around. just like nearly all businesses and situations in real everyday life, you generally don't have to worry about getting f'ed daily and if you do, the process to recover it is hell because companies know how critical it is to verify the person given along with how infrequent it is for someone to be compromised. yes you can blame victims, but honestly the issue at hand lies with the current system. it is too easy to recover or hack someones account, and too many people have been victimized.

---
They have commented on this before. The amount of work to do it would take about a year and delay major content for that entire time. Content is what keeps players playing, graphics are just nice. 
---
I’m sure runelite will get some enhancements going soon enough so ask there instead.
---
Ah yes, everyone that votes thinks "hey my no vote = 3 yes votes". You also conveniently didn't mention that sometimes something might not be passing and then people don't vote yes because it doesn't even counteract one no vote.
---
Change to decrease the bias in the poll results is a good thing no matter how you look at it. There is no logical argument you can make to back up you view. Your argument is literally "I don't want the polls to be less biased than they currently are because I don't understand statistics and I think that an undeniably biased poll asking whether we should start hiding poll results should be binding!!!1!"
---
Also, people are down voting your comments because what you are saying is incorrect. Playing the victim card on Reddit is pretty sad lol.

Well, all the experience adds up. Next raid should be more smooth, gl.
---

---
See, that's your issue. Having unhidden poll results undeniably introduces bias into the polling system. We wanted the poll results hidden to reduce the bias. That's all.
---
Fair point!
---
Yes lol.
---
Awful idea
---
that'd be hot af
---
"Content is what keeps players playing" That's it! We dont want the same players, we want to reach out to players that have never ever played this game before. I don't think new players that takes a look at osrs graphics would draw them into the game as much as HD graphics would. And they are a business, they need to think longterm and the reality is its 2020 soon and same graphics from 2007 just wont cut it..

I'm also oddly invested in finding this out now..
---
The creators of runelite actually don't want this feature in the official release because it would make hydra too afk, goes against the spirit of the game in their opinion
---
He was Jeremy Servil before, which is a slight variation on Jimmy Savile, a famous and once-beloved BBC presenter.
---
Between the release of Fight Arena and now, it came out that Jimmy liked to diddle kids. He's not quite as beloved now. (He's also dead).
---
Been out of the loop playing sekiro and just realized this is all part of new TT, so yeah it's probably something new.
---
They're doing this as a trial. So OP trying to artificially increase voting *could* be counted as skewing results as the people who'll vote because of this wouldn't normally vote.
---
That shit ain’t a joke period ain’t nothing edgy about it
---
I disagree, the ge is awful. 
---
That's why I play an ironman only.
---
Btw
---
D
---
It's not a plugin the runelite devs, or jagex, want to endorse. Some of the parts needed to make the plugin have been disabled for the boss variant of the hydra. Essentially Runelite doesn't allow you to get information about the projectiles fired by the hydra boss. You can't re-enable the hydra boss projectiles because the code that hides them isn't easily modifiable (although with enough knowledge and effort you could, like with any code). If you want to know more I believe their wiki has a page on mixins which should help you understand more thoroughly why the code is hard to modify.
---
Why would I google that if I clearly don’t think it’s a joke. How is making fun of a terrorist attack a coping mechanism for someone who wasn’t part of it. I never said anything offended me I was just saying it’s not a joke.
---
I think they let you out in a bit ahaha, so innocent

Like another person said, obviously you could still get defense xp for quests or even an accidental xp lamp. You should just be able to lock to a certain attack style, or perhaps even just be able to block defensive style.

If they knew your pin its possible you got RAT'ed and they disabled authenticator from your own machine while you where afk.

As far as EOC is concerned. I can just play another MMO with complex combat if that is what i wanted. Them changing the combat just made the osrs one a worse version. I liked simplistic combat and also liked complex combat. But if they make osrs combat complex i might aswell play guild wars 2 with better complex combat
---
Last time I checked the G.E. MASSIVELY overvalued Mine/Smith gear. You should definitely not assume it is accurate.

---
The rule basically comes from Windows keybinding being okay, although using other keybinding software is generally thought to be okay, as long as it's used in a way that the windows built in software could use.
---
A generally recognised rule of thumb to follow would be 1 key press to one action, so for example, with dropping an inventory, one key to act as the left click, another key to move the mouse down, one to move it across, and one to move it up etc
---
also, diagonal movement isn't allowed as it uses two movements, (one to move the cursor across, and one to move it up/down).
---
The way you seem to want to use the software sounds like it is probably against the rules, unless you reprogram it to 1:1 movement, although a lot of people seem to get away with using more complex AHK, so it kind of depends on how much risk you want to take.
---

This exact picture and title about agility has been posted before. Varying time in the title.

Imagine all these people being at work/school/something important and then getting a message that there is a new login from a different IP or anything like that. Not saying everyone is like this but lots of people will just rush to the nearest pc/home/mobile to 'prevent' getting hacked while it's too late.
---
This doesn't battle the problem, it only makes sure you get notified and super anxious when it's happening.
---
Authenticator delay is not too hard, but neither is having a unique password for your rs and e-mail, a bank-pin and not using your data for anything other (scams and such).

I mean it depends how you classify countries, depending on definition it could be above 200 by a bit

Ironman is better for you if you easily get bored. Normal account if you want to buy stuff and skip most of the grind.

It's my understanding that anything programmable is against the rules. That being said, there's tons of high ranking players who never quit ahk after the ban, and they're doing fine. Just make sure it's 1:1 and make sure you don't advetize yourself doing it

Yeah I’m not sure what went wrong but it’s a Bernoulli (binomial) with 65 trials with p=1/65. Expected successes are 1 in that time frame.

Eh I’m 99 smithing, and besides alching Rune armour for a lot of profit it’s pretty useless to me, and most people who wear Rune can’t make it let alone get ahold of it freely outside the skill. Especially when most of the monsters that drop it require combats skills well past 40 anyway, making the rune drops useless by the time they do get it. It’s basically just a gold sink now if anything.

Meanwhile skills like Runecrafting although tedious and ridiculous to train will always be useful,.

I think you would be able to complete chompy hunting with 10hp. You’d gain a little xp but not enough for 11hp. I think theres a few scenarios where you have to gain small amounts of hp xp, so you have to work out which ones are worth it most to you!
---
Correct, the actual windspeed will typically be stronger and more consistent at sea because there isn't any land mass to obstruct it.
---
The only major downsides to having mills in the water is accessibility and cost.
---
Duude this happened to me at cerb haha. Prim would have been nice but can't complain with that!
---
Gj and gl bud :)
---
How long does it take to get level 5 in every role in Barb Assault? Only grind I've ever done there is for the fighter torso
---
So he could just not be a fool and take bets to do something he's attempting to do at his own pace without 3rd party info? smh
---
If I got a bond for 14 days, what would happen to my P2P items when I go F2P again?
---
Chill dude, I thought he meant xp lock in general.
---
Thats not my point friend, I think its great f2p content and completely agree that its a nice mix to the f2p content already at hand but when people feel the need to post every mediocre clue loot they get its kind of repetitive and unnecessary. Beginner clues are meant to be awful loot unless you get uniques, point is I don’t quite think everyone gets that. People are expecting insane loot from them and get disappointed when they don’t get a unique every clue lol
---
It’s practicality is questionable
---
I killed about 800 with no clue drops. I'm afraid they changed what drops clues ):
---
Did you do this all on mobile? Mobile is great for chilling doing easy thing like woodcutting and fishing, but using the game client on a pc will make thing’s even more enjoyable!
---
I just go around. It ain't much, but it's honest work
---
How have you done 105 beginner clues in 2 days. And the other question is why
---
This is so fucked cunt look at the fucking inconsistency of upvotes to downvotes on exactly the same fuckin statement.
---
rune pouch doesn't get converted to coins it just disappears. Also, barrow gloves (which does turn into coins on pvp deaths) u can drop those and pick 'em up if u make it back within 2 minutes.
---
Had a friend in the same boat, he hated me on my main and iron Man got the set in under 15 games
---
I think they stopped dropping clues
---
Aw you woke up your sister
---
Are there any good F2P moneymakers?
---
Cannoned goblins for my first 30 then opened young implings for the rest of the clues
---
Why is 75 defense needed for "range tank"? Also I heard zerker pures are melee pures...
---
If you use Opera (the browser) you can do this with any video, anywhere. I use it to watch youtube videos while skilling.
---
Nice dude! I got a pair yesterday and sold for 8.5m
---
Yikes, total expenses vs. profit?
---
Lol dont ask. And got my first 1 step at 112
---
Not everything can be easy scape. Not that hard to scroll friend
---
When will people realize that rs3 and and osrs bleed over each other
---
Note 9 :)
---
That’s strange, could try checking your java version and updating that. Also check you don’t have 3rd party software trying to optimise it and messing it up somehow.
---
Wtf why can't I see the results?? Jagex can easily rig this shit.
---
than\*
---
Right?
---
*laughs in auto weed*
---
This would actually be really cool
---
I'm not talking about points. I couldn't give a fuck less about karma. Fuck you cunt. You're part of the problem. How about helping someone for once instead of being a fucking asshole.
---
Ty fam
---
Now this is quality content.
---
Q
---
Can I get a magic short bow before being the correct fletching/woodcutting level on an Ironman?  Level 55 ranged, and I really want to upgrade from willow.  Are crossbows better?
---
I could care less if people are using this game to feed their family. It’s not intended to monetize. It’s against the rules.
---
A
---
I almost lost my whole bank to the animation cancel trade trick on a pvp world, it was such an elaborate trick and I got frozen 1 step outside with no food. Luckily the guy splashed like 6 times and I walked back into the bank with my 80m lol.
---
_You have been frozen._
---
This is why people vote NO to PvP content.
---
OSRS runs on macs?!? Maybe mac’s are OK after all
---
I'm at 598, need a stupid brittle key and then a mimic
---
This made me laugh uncontrollably at work. I needed this to get through my day.
---
Limited to five times per day, I often swap my spellbook tens of times per day. With Slayer, tree runs, NPC contact and so much more I really use the shit out of that altar.
---
Also, you really couldn't. Getting 99 magic cost me ~38m or so bursting pretty efficiently (like 2.8gp/xp), of course if you just want to alch then sure you can but is it worth it? It might take 200 hours to do that, whereas you could just go to Vorkath for a day and you will have enough money for the altar and a fair chunk of 99 magic too.
---
Occult altars are definitely worth.
---
🤣🤣
---
*Aggressive*
---
Oh look it happened again
---
It's made so you don't take damage while going to the boss lair. It isn't meant to be faster than walking there though.
---
Orcas scare the shit out of me.
---
So smart, and fast, and strong. And they eat meat. In an environment that I could never hope to function in, let alone just seeing one coming.
---
If I ever see an orca while I’m in the water, it’ll be too soon.
---
You need to get off the internet for a while.
---
I think they've said that reports just make it so the system flags them and checks them out.
---
what stats are conducive to killing skotizo? i have 75/75/72 melee w 75 HP, 58 pray. just finished my first totem, can I slap this guy up you think if i have arclight?
---
Lmao 2 have protect from missiles and 1 wants to be splashed.... hmmm
---
Ahh, another shitposter that got too greedy with his content and decided to post too frequently.
---
I think they look pretty cool. Much better to look at than a boring grassy knoll.
---
Give banks a right-click “Repeat transaction” button
---
Wtf, pet??
---
Mr. Mordaut is sexy
---
Are you kidding
---
...
---
Are there any clans I could join just to chat around? Basically skilling at MLM right now and feels so boring...
---
You forgot they require atleast 75 rc
---
Not if you have the requirements for DS2 lmao. 70 Smithing unboosted. Addy bars are plentiful (and easy to mine or buy in Mor Ul-Rek) and you need like 74 for the bolts (easy boost or just get a few more Smithing levels).
---
explain the upvotes on those posts then? :P
---
Lol
---
it was for the new clue scroll items introduced in Thursday's update.
---
&amp;
---
how do you get an ags box in a clue wtf? ^^^^^/s
---
This has been mentioned before, and the reason that it can’t be dropped is because you can only have one at a time, and they didn’t want players attempting to get another by dropping their first and then realizing they wasted their BH points.
---
Gotta count the cballs for the first 30 too
---
Zulu the ugliest guy I’ve ever seen and dumb enough to film this
---
Java is up to date. I deleted the cache for osrs and it fixed it on the offical client. No luck for runelite. All plugins are the same as theyve always been.
---
I do, but I realize its my fault and move on.
---
That will have a dozen bots on them on each world. Still not exactly ideal
---
It takes a minute to read and answer questions.
---
Why would you need this, if you are on the spellbook you can just look
---
later virgins
---
&gt; wilderness slayer 2
---
what quest is that
---
To add to the incomplete reply you got earlier, the NPC you get the collection log from is [The Collector](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Collector) located on the first floor (American) or ground floor (English) of the [Varrock Museum](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock_Museum).
---
You should crop it by dragging the bottom right end of your image to where the screenshot ends in Paint :)
---
It sold for 315m :o
---
mages book is better than ancient wyvern shield for raids. Olm only attacks with ranged/mage, and range/mage def is better on the mage's book.
---
They should make it so when you get 99 the rune plate that you can make make makes it untradeable but really good dunno
---
That makes his examine text kind of awkward.
---
I don’t understand how people fall for skull tricks. Set up the “right click to attack” option and then throw on a bulward and gtfo there
---
THIS GUY IS LITERALLY TRIMMING PAPER
---
If you are the original owner of the account, Jagex should be able to ask for proof that you should have. 
---
Honestly though if the account is totally fresh, you could just start over on a new one so that you are not always worrying about the account being recovered by the hacker.
---
We should petition a climate change event to Jamflex.
---
The goal of the event is to clean a certain area of garbage, and once you collected enough, you could exchange it for a boss ticket
---
Bosses like Gas Clouds, Plastic Bags, Chemical Solutions and anti climate change advocates 
---
By doing the event you would have a change of optaining "Millie" a windmill pet, which only characteristic is a small smiley face. 
---
And yes, we have a lot of downtime on this job, lmao.
---
so then why does the arcane spirit shield have +52 range def
---
*This changes everything*
---
Ahhh okay I have 40 in str att and def so then I should be okay to try it thanks man I needed to hear that haha
---
They may be bugged since ive seen a couple people posting specifically about thugs but Ive not seen confirmation and 300 isn’t unheard of to go dry of a 1/64
---
You're\*
---
On runelite try turning on the gpu settings. I have a fairly decent gaming pc but without gpu it didn't run very well either. Not unplayable per say but when it better utilized the gpu it was perfect
---
Na it's just cause you're a HCIM.
---
Nah, this quest is super easy and should not have any good rewards
---
Damn bro good question
---
i imagine dying with them skulled would produce a similar effect but they’d be there for an hour?
---
Rune bolts? Oh you mean that trash drop you'll get an infinite number of after monkey madness 2?
---
oh then you’ll be completely fine, go kick Elvarg’s arse 👌
---
GUTHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIX
---
New grandmaster quest. Torvesta is the final boss. Little do you know...
---
Bro what are them shoes
---
hell yeah baby get them back
---
Try downloading SwiftKey or a third party keyboard. If that doesn't fix the problem it's just because your screen is too long.
---
You still can fail
---
They don’t think it be like it is, but it do
---
He thought it was his turn to repost.
---
I like your item: Monkey Nuts.
---
Thats skull tricking we are talking about the trade scam where trading someone inside of a safezone drags you outside and they freeze you.
---
one of the worst screenshots I've seen
---
We didn’t have ezscape back then smh
---
And its always like cooking or fletching.
---
Don't worry he just has a case of double autism. Iron Man and posting to MGTOW
---
Holt shit

He has made some, just not any lewds yet
---
Better remove all cosmetics from the game then just to be safe
---
I'm looking for a better money making method. Recently i've been doing barrows as i got the mort hard diaries but i'm 80 chest with just a dharrok weapon so far so not getting anywhere with that. Looking at godwars it seems i'm too low for that anyone know of anything i can do that can make me a good amount of money to eventually buy item upgrades such as bandos and sara godsword? Thank you.
---
He fell into the bog while trekking
---
No dick pics? Surprising

How so?
---
Buy obby legs. They're better than d legs
---
You got under some people's skin lmao
---
You realise the crab rave meme was a thing well before 2007scape started using it
---
Oh hey it's weird to see you on Reddit boo, congrats
---
Farm easy clues
---
This.
---
That is shortening way too many interactions.
---
It actually IS completely average luck, though. The expected number of attempts to make a random drop that has a chance p of occurring is 1/p.
---
Windmills are fucking wildly inefficient
---
Whats the point of insuring a pet anyways? Surely people dont do pvm with them out, do they? Seems like a waste of 500k when you can just keep them out when you do safe skilling activities.
---
For about 3 weeks now I have been lagging my ass off during birdhouse runs. Fps drops like giraffe nuts. Just wanted to let you know you’re not the only one
---
Devil may cry scape

This is more of a reference to the original ‘ OBAMA IS GONE’.

Ffs 😂
---
I started zulrah I’m lower stats than you do you could I’d imagine that’s your best bet besides slayer. If possible, try to get 85+ mage
---
I truly hope he felt no pain. He may have passed but he’ll never be gone, I won’t let his memory fade. Thank you for your kind words.
---
Theres actually a safespot in elvargs room, if you look it up
---
 you can do it at any combat level itll just take a while because you hit him once, get back to spot, make sure his HP bar goes away, then hit him one time again, and repeat
---
Just search on yt for elvarg safespot
---
Why would you ask then?
---
It's offending you or else you wouldn't be having such a fuss about it. Get over it, not everyone is a sensitive snowflake.
---
It's a joke whether you like it or not, you don't get to decide what is or isn't a joke.
---
Dont know abaut npc's but most of ironmen have some sort of mental issues
---
Zulrah, Vorkath, Slayer, Herb runs.
---
Username checks out
---
i love these memes
---
very nice u were on my heels all day thursday :P im missing sandwich maid skirt atm 600 clues in but done for now
---
Oh my b 😂
---
It was definitely a bond, that’s the only way to get just 14 days. It could’ve come from a different account, if you don’t see it in your GE history. They mightve been trying to turn it into some kind of bot, it’s very common.
---
I will, that’s the only positive thing I can see taking from the, is living twice as hard for him. I want to make him proud of me, like I am of him for all the things he did the short time he was here.
---
Sparc Mac bough a stick for 1.9Bil 
---
Hah!
---
It's a nice stick though.
---
Yikes - READ IT AGAIN 😂
---
Yet so controversial
---
Maybe they should start tick manipulating
---
Oh. I did not. I’ve only ever seen it on 2007scape. Below there is 🦀$11🦀 and other 2007scape central memes that I couldn’t fit in the screenshot.
---
I have the 2 not xl. Runs great, was planning on getting the 3 xl for the bugger screen, glad so see it looks so beautiful and runs good!

The support the community, a game I’ve played like most of you since we were kids, has been overwhelmingly amazing. You always hear and see people being toxic. But this? Our people are generally and mostly good if you ask me.

Damn y'all gotta chill and let ppl be happy everyone play this game different. Some of y'all got too big of egos to let people be proud goddam

Congrats! MM2 boss fight is much much easier. Honestly thought the quest itself was easier but a lot of people have trouble with the platform maze.

I had 90 range to be fair, but i did it with a rcb, broad bolts, and diamond(e) bolts. Use god d hide top and a granite shield.

Rough estimate of 40k\~ moss giants in total so far. Only reason is that I'm slowly working towards collection log completion (PvM-wise, that is, since 3a from clues isn't gonna happen).

I've mostly been killing them in the catacombs since it gives me a decent amount of passive totems/shards along the way

git gud
---
Back to lumbrige for you goblin boy
---
    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
---
According to wiki vork is 2.5 per hour with bp and 20 kills per hour  (imo that’s max efficiency with bp ). This is profit after supplies.
---
I can’t give you an accurate estimate on zulrah besides wiki because I haven’t done it in a while. But zulrah is estimated at 2m after supplies. This includes 76 agility for faster access and assumes 20 kills an hour.
---
Imo if you want a definite answer, see how many kills you get an hour with vorkath and base that 
---
gp / kill / hour ratio with the 
---
wiki’s 2.5m/ 20 kills / 1 hour
---
That’s if you’re experienced and have 75 for all pouches lol. I’ve paid a lot of runners

Hahaha those fuckin losers who dont play as much as you. I bet you they have a life too!! Bahahha what the fuck is wrong with people man????????

Hmmm was this polled????? 🦀🦀🦀🦀

Hey I suggested a shuffle, and search song months ago. Everyone was live "REEEEE USE RUNELIGHT"

Yeah I’d rather see a fire cape than a 99. Literally anyone could click on trees for 200 hours

Server time is much more useful, it'll tell you when dailies reset
---
Mines like 50/50 chalk vs white
---
That is what he is suggesting though..
---
They were based on back when Rune was BIS I assume for classic, should definitely be looked into although I don’t have an idea of where to begin without affecting the game too much
---
Behold my ingame successfulness that 10 year old me would be proud of.
---
Theres a reason why they dont have anyone on their friends list
---
Congrats to you! A worthy achievement indeed for an Ironman!
---
That's impossible, most jails aren't underwater
---
I can't find an ASCII brainlet to paste here but imagine my comment here is one.

Barrows,zulrah, revenants
---
I prefer top down view, this provides the farthest view in the direction I want
---
Skeletal wyverns and gargoyles are great afk money makes that don’t have too high requirements, and both allow you to stay as long as you’d like without banking
---
I’ve been playing for 12 years. Still no 99. When I finally get one I’ll make sure to post on reddit about it with a “only 7 people who sort by new will see this, but I had no one else to share this with” title and on my cake day too.
---
I'd give you 500k if you weren't an ironman. Gz
---
What did they say?
---
thoughts on jagex recoloring the ugthanki kebab without polling it? or is its name forbidden and thoust who praise the unholy god considered heretics?
---
Fair enough my dude, happy scaping!
---
What are the minimum stats to do grotesque guardians? 
---
I have 70 attack 75 strength, 99 range, and 80 defense.
---
Lol yep. Albeit, I've seen both men and women take credit for things that they didn't do or lie about the things they know. But Katie's CV is beyond impressive, it's crazy how people can discredit where credit is due. The funny thing is that she never once took credit for everything, that was just the media. Why can't we just appreciate the work &amp;&amp; recognize this woman.
---
Except it would change the percentage. It would increase it. If you're going off of lifetime *observed,* 20 years of observed time is a larger % of your life than 20 years passed. Which is what he was getting at when he said "more when you consider time spent sleeping"
---
It makes perfect sense. I don't get what you're not getting here, lmao.
---
Maybe you should learn the game before complaining. Every portal has a weakness. You're hitting 0s because you aren't using that portal's weakness.
---
name checks out
---
It’s a shame BA can get a bad rap, I actually enjoyed getting lvl 5 in all roles recently.  Mostly because I made my team of all 120+combat people so even if they were new to the role they weren’t at much risk of dying.  Should scale NPC lvls with average team combat lvl a bit imo

No he’s suggesting multiple items, people on here are upvoting because of stuff like masks which I find stupid. I just think you could add some stuff to the actual character model like an eyepatch for example rather than going overboard as people will want all their items being remembered by this makeover mage and it just get over the top and stupid. I just can’t imagine seeing someone in a goblin mask and a berserker helm or something
---
Not you specifically.
---
Well rune armor is available to the f2p plebs so that's more than likely the reasoning lol
---
I know. I’ve actually enjoyed BA so far, it’s not really that hard. Just takes some attention and learning how to call. I swear that’s everyone’s problem. Almost to my chestplate!
---
Jad is easy lol
---
I killed him, took me 3 attempts tho. Hotel wifi dropped out on second attempt first attempt I used brews and it didnt work out great. Gonna do galvek here soon. Any tips?
---
If 20 years go by it's not 20 years observed. The percentage doesn't change.
---
It’s because your str lvl is too low
---
Nice cape
---
cool
---
I don’t quite have the 500k to insure this little guy yet...
---
When you need a bond to renew membership, but your bank is full of member's objects.
---
Yeah I would much rather bosses be about mechanics than just having to need the best stats to get by. I was really pleased with the Galvek fight though. And yeah, Vorkath took me way longer than Galvek and Robert almost got me but that one only took 1 try
---
My buddy got hammered and bought my friend a bond and gave him an abby dagger. He was combat 50 maybe lol.
---
Mine insta sold for 3m earlier today, but that seems to be about the cap for it now.
---
No this is Patrick
---
21 pkers
---
The anticipation of getting drops is good enough for me. Keeps me motivated.
---
I was being a little generous.
---
Since when do you have to go to law school to craft law runes?
---
Crafting opal necklaces is pretty fast and low level, see https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Jewellery for more.
---
Prices are dropping on everything, nows the best time to sell before the f2p rewards go down tp a steady lowered price.
---
Got mine on KC 13. Glad I didnt have to get THAT many totems
---
Range is fine but melee stats will slow kills by a lot. very do able
---
1, because I got the shield and want to be able to justify using it?
---
Men in edgeville is a good option to been dropping pretty fast for me.
---
Yikes my guy. Super hypocritical
---
Rah, he's replied saying it's not for him. So he's getting upset on other people's behalf over comments made on a small subreddit on the Internet. 
---
If someone were to actually be upset by this affected on this way of course I'd be sorry. 
---
But again, look at the first comment it was a joke. Sort yourself out Bro. Imagine being so upset over a comment not directed at anyone and then ranting about empathy.
---
It's just the community aspect that makes then want to post. Why you gotta be such a prick?
---

Well ACTUALLY those knives are meant to prevent players from becoming forever stuck inside if they somehow don't have a knife when trying to leave.

Tsk. Common knowledge.
---
It does. You get a few shots at it and every try the extra reward decreases.
---
Hold up. So you're unnafected by this, but speaking for them? It's the Internet, they can anonymously speak for themselves. It's clear no one who's seen this comment is affected by this. And if they are, they've already moved on.
---
BECAUSE CONTEXT.
---
1 line of text is considered ranting now? Wow, W O W.

Nah there's nothing wrong with posting an achievement, but to post it here with the "wah I have no friends" story is ridiculous. It's not like it's hard to find a few people to talk to or find a community you can feel a sense of belonging to these days on osrs. There's numerous clans, friends chats, discords, etc. that are more appropriate for those minor achievements like a 99 or a fire cape, I'd even throw inferno in there. Unless it's something groundbreaking I don't feel it deserves a post because we've all seen it before. You can call it gatekeeping and shit the bed over me having a differing opinions like most people in the thread, or understand not everyone wants to see the same recurring posts that do nothing but draw praise (which is fine but again, unless you soloed theatre or something like that... I don't think THAT many people genuinely care). I don't actively go around flaming said people who post those things either I just down vote and go on with my day. But I'd be lying if I said it isn't annoying sometimes.
---
If everyone did their clues the value of the rewards would decrease drastically and finally people would stop urging us to do our clues.
---
maybe op is hardcore addicted and neglects his marriage and kids and job to play runescape and she's just reacting appropriately
---
Hell yeah brother
---
And you accidentally pull out a pet cat...
---
Your new inventory decoration until you get members back. I even asked Ash if there was a method of disposing of the cat... I think PvP death was the only way in the end.
---
try deep wilderness hot/cold with the purple squad waiting for you to dig
---
Well, truth be told, I didn’t use that either
---
how else would macbooks be usable?
---
There should be a f2p max cape tbh.
---
Something meme-worthy, we can argue the effectiveness of it later.
---
You can, but it would be a bit harder to justify one without the other.
---
Unlucky aha glad i dont deal with this in the 100-115 bracket
---
I just want OSHD and Summoning added to the game as one off update, igorning everything else and not asking the community anything.
---
I just want to finish my summoning tank so bad lol.
---
WHAT?????
---
Not enough cleavage, this aint it chief.
---
Real men do blast furnace in full dragon
---
Ironmen asking for instanced scenarios so they don’t get crashed by others. This statement would exactly fit Which would fit the basis of your statement- asking for something that you’ve voluntarily restricted.
---
lmao whats up man
---
Have you seen your replies to other people? One line here, one line there. All adds up. Stay consistent with how you feel, because you want to talk about empathy?
---
Here's a comment from last week made by you. 
---
'Get your RS3 playing bitch ass outta here nigga'
---
At least I'm consistently a cunt. You know what you get with me. With you its one day you're empathetic and the next day you're upset at a different community...
---
Tldw: a chick takes 15 minutes to complete tutorial island
---
Then they'd be the BIS F2P cape slot, and needing two 99s in F2P for a BIS item is dumb.  Plus most of the perks involve members' stuff.
---
I wouldn't really mind seeing cosmetic F2P skill capes with no stats or perks, though it's still Dev time used for things that like 0.01% of players will use.
---
Thats not against the rules...
---
And woodcutting
---
You're *
---
Yeah it’s not a replica by any means
---
So that’s what the typical runescape player looks like
---
Lol I saw your absolute unit of a account smashing down fally guards.
---
Absolute unit
---
Thanks man! Crafting gets stale after awhile.
---
Oh. And obviously I dont have the elder maul! Lol
---
Though I hope to start raids soon.

True, you could. But at that point you might as well not bother.

Only other mmo I play is ffxiv, If I go to the hub area for one second i'm already seeing gold sellers. I'm gonna assume its like that in every popular mmo.
---
Lol I saw this same guy doing the same thing a few weeks ago. Guess this is his main source of income. Not sure what he is expecting though since it was in f2p
---
Mean mugged, not just mugged. It's called context mate.
---
I was walking around in my Lumby-hood and saw a bunch of bots that were up to no good
---
It will always require darts and zulrahs scales and won’t fire without them
---
And I'm already adjusted to the client I use. I don't doubt that the other clients are better, I just don't care enough to switch. 
---
If I started trying to optimize my experience in the game, I'd start putting more time into the game than I actually want to. 
---
If I found myself playing the game enough that I actually wanted the other features provided by Runelite, I'd set it up on my laptop. 
---
But honestly I don't play it enough to want those things. I installed Runelite on my desktop simply to see what the GPU plugin was like, because it needed a dedicated graphics card to run. 
---
That's the only thing I was interested in, so I didn't install it on the computer that couldn't use that plugin.
---
It's not illogical to not use a third party client, it's just a matter of using what I'm already comfortable with, so I don't have to play the game even more to set it up in a better way.
---
I'd say alch yourself but with that drop you might not be worth anything! Lol
---
Probably about the new sound track. Lol
---
Good bot
---
Because rune plates are fucking fast smithing xp/hr. And rune 2h's at 99 smith are insane gp/hr for f2p
---
Runelite is the rs equivalent to addons for WoW. 
---
It’s not bad to use. 
---
That being said I still use vanilla client lol
---
but that’s my personal choice.
---
Spotted the pker

I have only one friend left that plays (irl) with my clan joined in about 2014 i trying to make a meet and greet for the community in summer. We are about 400players in total and amlost 1/4 th already said they come. First time seeing most of the mate i play with. Already met one of my friends from back 2006 and we are now friends irl
---
Equip a ring of suffering, wait for Jagex to fuck up everyone's pures again and then randomly reset your stats, complete fight caves with just recoil and tick eating, easy game
---
All hard diaries and mm2/ds2 completed is a good longterm goal you could work towards
---
Wanted to give you 500k sinxe you seem so poor. But your hcim!!!!
---
This^^^ who cares if its a small achievement for you? This sub isnt for boasting
---
That's correct.
---
There's a massive difference between a reward and locking a BIS item behind two 99s in F2P.
---
F2P PvP is pretty accessible, which is basically it's entire selling point.  Forcing people to grind out two 99s in F2P to PK optimally is the polar opposite of accessible.
---
Ah is that better than 3 skeletons? I always forget.
---
Is skillspecs the quest giver?

To be honest I think he's quite easy first time if you've watched a video or 2 beforehand. I got him first try and I suck dick at this game.
---
You're thinking about it too hard. Stuff like the eye patches or bandit mask or whatever under a helmet wouldn't hurt anything. A goblin mask with a berserker helm wouldn't be possible and would have clipping errors out the ass. I just want to have an eye patch and helmet at the same time
---
Mithril. Check out Mac H on youtube.
---
My first time I thought I got all the healers but there was one hiding behind him while I aggro'd and killed the rest. I got so tilted when they respawned that I died. But since I technically did over 100% of Jad's max HP that basically counts tbh.
---
Im sorry that life turned you into such a hostile and shitty person
---
what if they dont want me?
---
then cya hicks
---
bye guys
---
I've used both OSB and Runelite and OSB is still my favourite. Runelite is a sore on the eye.
---
To be fair the problem is with greater skilling and not just with mining, that is the tick-manipulation methods.
---
From gameplay point of view it makes no sense that obscure item like tar grants you higher EXP rates, right?
---
It would be better if you instead had some sort of a bar on top of your head that told you when/where to click to receive that higher EXP rate.
---
Another issue is with mining rates. If it wasn't for MLM, no one would mine Mith, Addy and Coal(until much higher level) because said methods are much slower EXP than mining Iron.
---
You gotta have some randomness in the letters you choose to capitalise

No.

What I'm a shitty person for having a giggle at the expense of people who post the same accomplishments 10 times a day?

My only thought of how to prevent it woul,d be to restrict the amount of accounts you can create in a given time period for an IP. However, then they just change their IP and bypass it so really there's nothing they can do but ban them when they get the opportunity to do so

Doesn't the ore only giving one ore per 1:30 gate this still? Correct me if I'm wrong, but most rune rocks are less than 3 per area, so even then they still have to fight each other over the limited number of ores available per area per hour. The more bots created to utilize this will only decrease the effectiveness of said bots as competition increases.
---

That’s pretty irrelevant. If you’re in a relationship where your significant other is destroying your property over you playing a game, you probably have bigger problems and worries than the cost of a divorce.

Doesnt have to be nerfed just has to be made more of a risk item. Remove em all from the game and make it drop by grotesque guardians at 1/128.

You’re right mate, getting a PhD doesn’t call for celebration since thousands of others have done it before. Winning the Super Bowl, pffft, yeah right loser, there are hundreds of other people that have won the super bowl? You overcame your alcoholism or drug addiction? Good for you pal no one cares cause so have millions of others.  Try doing something literally no one else has ever done, THEN you can be celebrated.
---
I agree with you, I’m merely saying his example is valid, just pay $11 and have full access.

I’m sorry, have I done something to you? I wanted to buy an account because I am a skiller and personally I don’t do fighting, and found a good man that offered to get me 50 for every fighting skill for a few bucks. How does this affect you personally, enough to insult me?
---
Vro you’re just jealous that his brain is almost as big as his massive horse cock vro plus he wears the freshest clothes and hangs out with the hottest dudes so stfu vro
---
It's probably not enough to support a bond but if you're sorta newish then fishing lobsters and depositing them at the deposit boxes in port sarim is pretty decent. A few hours of that and you should have full rune and anything else you might want in the limited f2p world of Runescape. Cutting yews is nice and afkish as well, it took me about 2 days or so to hit 60 wc on my new ironman with braindead woodcutting on my second monitor while I played other games. The gp/hr at edgeville is pretty nice for how afk it is.
---
Is there anything besides Woox walking and not wasting ticks that I can immediately do to increase my trip length at vorkath? My gear's the best it can be without 30m upgrades. Can you tick eat the ranged attacks with guthix rest teas?
---
Its actually a pretty tough call to make. It depends on your gear and what other content you do. If your main focus is vorkath then personally I would say go for DHCB. It will increase your dps and allow you to take less damage and get more kills per trip. However if you do anything other content that requires range then rigour would be a better call. The dps increase from rigour with 50ish bgs damage is fairly close to then dps increase of the DHCB but you have less inventory space and take more damage. I did have to make some assumptions about what gear/levels you are using so results may vary. 
---
Personally I would say go for DHCB. It makes vorkath so much more peaceful.
---
Obviously his team has deacent "defense".

I’m sure that I’m stupid and you are so smart, random teenager that insults me on a social media dedicated to a video game because I asked a question

WoW is the exact same way. The chat channels are full of gold sellers spamming. Even the group finder is full of people using it as an advertisement board for ToS-breaking activity. On the 2nd largest US realm, for example, it's basically *required* to use an addon to block any messages with Chinese characters, or else the Chinese gold seller spam makes public chat unusable.
---
Yeah, it's not in the rulebook, but that doesn't change the fact that you were annoying and were consequently muted for it. Let's not pretend that standing at the GE posting identical messages every 5 seconds is something people want in the game.
---
Shilo village people

Soz didnt realise it  was that loud lmao

That's true, but we have over 200 worlds. That's a lot of rune coming into the game if the requirement is just lowered like that.
---
The more bots you have, the higher the chance of getting a rock in a pid competition, so you might even be tempted to have several bots in a single rock, yes. But that'll most likely only happen when every single rock and world are taken.

I have 72 agility so I just RoD to clan wars, GE teleport to bank and fairy ring summer pie to get back. It takes 1:30 if you focus. If you don’t have the agility teleport to Camelot and charter a boat it’s 2-4K more depending on charos.
---
I’m getting down near 2:30 more often now, and a good run I use 4-5 monks. I don’t have a suffering, so that’s another slot for a recoil switch. Still, plausibly could be hitting it back to back, but I do like the rhythm of banking every kill.

Clues or get your stats up to base 60s-70s and Google money making methods.
---
  
---
Pro-tip, it's really easy to make money in me Evers worlds whereas f2p is just the worst thing in the world for money making.
---
1) wrong sub.
---
2) your argument literally makes no sense. Either elaborate or delete.
---
the reason everyone sits at full hp isn't because of the gmaul, it's because of damage stacking with ranged to melee, everyone does it against every weapon at every bracket.
---
triple eating should be removed if the gmaul was to be nerfed, otherwise no one would ever die, then again it's been polled and didn't pass.
---
and you'd still end up killing most of the pvp scene as it's centered around gmauling, if you think they're all suddenly going to get 60 attack for dds you're deluded.
---
I like the "Suggestion" tag

Funniest thing I've seen on this sub in a while lmfao

im assigned to do fire fiants in the catacombs of kourend and its a first for the giants. Is there anything special about those? most importantly is there a safespot? thanks

maybe just don't open the bird nests immediately? then it's only one spot being used up until you feel like depositing them

yeah i agree. Im a low/mid level acc and my total bank is like 16m. Every time that number goes up its so satisfying, and being able to splash on things like a cannon or fury or god dhide makes me feel like im making real progress. I wouldnt even know what to do with 72m cash. Something like 5-10m wouldve been nice for him, i suppose.

Wikia didn't try to get us to stay: there was no legal grounds to stop us, we'd already done all the importing before they became aware of the move, and they weren't interested in working with us (ever, really). Since the fork they've tried to wipe out any mention of the previous community, including deleting all userpages on the old site (???)
---
I wouldn't say we necessarily encountered any legal *issues*, so much as Jagex was venturing into what was (for them) uncharted territory: I don't think their legal team deals regularly with Creative Commons licenses, and entering into this sort of business relationship was new for everyone involved. That meant they moved very cautiously in drafting the licensing agreement and contemplating worst-case scenarios. It took a while, but we got there in the end -- in retrospect I'm pretty impressed they took that chance. It seems to be paying off.
---
Imagine not only getting pked while doing your clue but now before it too
---
I wonder why I never got muted. When I switched to a different mmorpg 10 years ago I advertised it and called everybody who still played RS idiots. Am I glad I returned to RS and quit that microtransaction ridden game before my friends convinced me to spend money on it.
---
Also the brainlet camping retribution
---
What if you've already done it?
---
It’s a dumb loophole. I forgot which JMod stated this, but apparently using that line is not scamming as said player is not promising anything in return.
---
Good chance it’ll be 30m by the end of today
---
Are you too stupid to take a screenshot? It is actually very simple.
---
There are a lot of assholes and edgy trolls as well. That's every group of people though I suppose. I've definitely met some cool people!
---
Everyone can do it. Simply getting a 99 or 200 mil xp in a skill is brain dead easy. You don't have to develop as a player at all.
---
Getting a fire cape, while easy, is about managing resources and learning to change prayers and use safe spots. There's actual player development involved.
---
yes completely forgotten about by everyone aside from you and me
---
Not gonna down vote bc I disagree, but imo I really liked the clue scheme for these, unlocking music has almost no point outside of music cape (which doesn't have a point) and I felt was a interesting experience. I'm not sure of all the locations, so I'm not sure of all the different tracks required, but it made me think; Do I have this unlocked? What do I need to do to unlock this track? What if it's in a region locked behind a quest or a skill requirement? Do I need to do those? I even scrolled through the music player for the first time in a long time on my first clue step like this.
---
Sad day :(
---
How though lol
---
Healing to full every time you take any damage in pvp then teleporting instantly when low on food. It gives your opponent basically no chance to kill you and most pvpers won't really fight you if you do it.
---
It's much easier to played fixed because clicks are much easier and faster.  Matters a lot for PvP
---
Not sure why they think some random forum is the place though. The vast majority of the playerbase has one and I think most of us aren't impressed by a fire cape at all.
---
Yeah, prayer isnt bad either, attack and strength will get you there too!
---
The mith platebody

Looks like momma's wrong again
---
Never said the N word? Even if I wanted to, I deff wouldn’t do it on a account that I actually play on. I’d show you the evidence which resulted in the perm mute but Jagex doesn’t do that anymore.
---
I should have been more clear. what do you make with the bars?
---
Ngl that npc still makes me mildly terrified until I get the first prayer right and realize I have 17 fire capes in my bank
---
Lmao what a fucking idiot , enjoy the mute
---
At least you missed the sand casino
---
Got 270m from a friend at ~700 total Didnt ruin anything. Got to skip the lame mid grind and now I’m at ~1800 grinding bosses
---
Stfu u virgin 😂😂
---
Get elite void and all of its helmets
---
Your own source confirms that the US’s life expectancy has decreased for the last 5 years. Congratulations, you played yourself
---
Did you buy her for 10k gp?
---
It varies a bit as prices fluctuate, but last I heard both Zulrah and Vorkath were around 4m/hr with max stats and gear. I believe Kree'arra can also make around that much profit.
---
Torture
---
Nah he clearly needs granite dust for those cannonballs
---
All of the relevant God books aswell.
---
I think I might have to but I’m just thinking about the 99 fm which was a pain for me to get haha
---
&gt;it's definitely on the upper end of difficulty in content in osrs
---
Maybe when Old School came out it was. CoX, ToB and most notably the Inferno all blow Jad out of the water in terms of difficulty and mechanics.
---
You can only have one of each clue
---
Do YoUr ClUe ScRoLlS
---
What’s the difference between red and reg Chins?
---
Hmm, well I don’t have max magic, only 94. I also don’t have ancestral, but I have Arma, so I could probably do decently well at zulrah depending on drops
---
 barrows gloves, torture, Anguish, bcp, tassets, prims, ferocious gloves. mage arena 2 cape, tormented bracelet.
---
I’d rather do my grind in 1/3 of the time since I don’t care about virtual gold. Time is money
---
we're assholes that mess around a lot
---
Healing higher than you can be combo'd. It's a joke cause with a 1tick gmaul you can hit like 100+ so you'd literally need to be angler'd to 121 to not be safing technically.
---
Probably safe to say it's E N G I N E   W O R K
---
exilent, runeloader, osbuddy, official
---
listed in order of usefulness
---
Yeah thought it was really overpriced at 126m
---
An interactive map for the wiki?
---
Aw, that's hot, that is hot
---
If they changed it to 60% per spec it wouldn't be as broken, i guess everyone can use it though so its still fair, just kinda annoying
---
Bandle
---
There’s only like 1 room that spawns rats and the path doesn’t always go through that room. That’s why it’s inconsistent
---
Why not raids? It’s so much better money
---
Not quite :)
---
If you got the money go 70 pray then 70 attk, then just train with whip on controlled. Don’t worry about range till you hit your target CB lvl.
---
D boots.
---
But with how easy these are id wager that theres bots being created right now. I feel like the prices will fall to what their loot notification is.
---
Yeah, use all the essence pouches you can, and I usually run with glory, spottier cape and boots of lightness (since I'm too dumb to have graceful), a cheap pickaxe, and fally shield. If I get pk'd while skulled, I can use the fally shield prayer charge to protect item, but I've yet to have anyone attack me. Just don't forget to swap out a charged glory when it runs out, and take a sip of a stam pot at the bank when needed.
---
Nothing special, I think they’re just higher level than normal ones. Personally I’d wear pros and camp melee pray
---
Just start with some questing, getting ur hp/cb up.. then do some wintertodt... dont worry to much bout getting 1 skill to 99 quick.
---
Sort of rude even
---
What do you mean you are "met with errors on that email (outlook problem)"? You have to describe  your issues if you expect anyone to take the time to help you.
---
Don't worry I agree with you
---
I did my first solo raids 1 today, took 2.5 hours im 111 combat and forgot to bring air runes for the water spell to get of the olm firewall
---
Coming from osrs. Just started an ironman today. Any tips or advice?
---
I very much enjoyed this video
---
OSBuddy was probably the biggest client before Runelite (if it still isn't), and Jagex has given OSBuddy an "ok" and says it's fine to use it.
---
Just wow. How did everyone came up with the same meme idea at the same time. Even matching titles. Great minds really do think alike.
---
Added mate, private is set to on so you should be able to find me
---
Chicken teriyaki or bust
---
They’re both ugly
---
Barrows gloves.
---
ironman shouldn't be allowed to use the blast furnace at all, it goes against standing alone
---
Aren’t shards 100%?
---
Eh, depends how you define "up there". It's harder than, let's say, bandos with a group but for example it's in no way comparable to the inferno. I definitely see where you're coming from though.
---
Sell tassets for torture
---
I work at best buy and almost started playing swampletics on one of my demo TVs
---
Aprox 150k
---
 Get all your untrables. Barrows gloves, fire cape, elite void, fighters torso. That should cost you almost nothing. For traonign, finish your obby set. Get the sword and zerker necklace
---
that surprises me because this place fuckin hates anything that might be a pvp buff in some way or another
---
Aprox 150k, dragon scim, rune kite, couple other stuff
---
God’s work 👏
---
I think arcane is one of the last upgrades you want, ancestral pieces give dmg bonus. Maybe learn with sanguinesti staff, cheaper than arcane and heals you but expensive to use.. I would use a serp helm to learn. It helps a lot to learn the 2 melee rotations first, If green ranger or blue mager comes 2nd phase just log out. Do 100 kills or so like this until you’re comfortable. After awhile you’ll catch on to how many attacks you can do on each phase and be ready with your switches, prayers, moving spots etc.
---
Never said you were.
---
out of the loop :(, can someone fill me in?
---
Or r/shitescape
---
If they make money playing the game it is their profession

^^^^^^^WUT
---
DAE RUNEMAKE SLOW
---
I'd watch this series if streamed somehow LOL. See how far you can get before getting repeatedly kicked out and eventually banned from the store.
---
Okay thank you, also I'm currently doing the 1:0 method for the melee hand.. should I learn the 3:1 or the 4:1 or just keep practicing with the 1:0 until I can do it without dying?
---
The only thing not allowed is using such programs to move your cursor or to perform more than one action per key press. If all you’re doing is remapping one key to another then that’s fine.
---
You have any rough idea of what you might have said? Sounds like you got lucky and they used some discretion on you. No previous offences I'm guessing?
---
Justiciar set too I think. I'm just a midgame noon so idk
---
You'll get it, remember you can pause before the next wave by clicking the lohout button once!
---
1. Make a bit of money (Cow hides/leather sell for like 150gp each), do some quests (need 7 quest points to sell cow hides), train stats. If you get a [clue scroll](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll_(beginner\)) (Goblins and men drop them, I think) do it. They can have some decent rewards. Once you have some armor and a bit of food, go do the Stronghold of Security. It'll give you some decent boots and 10k cash. You need to set up 2-factor authentication to do it though.
---
2. If you're unskulled you lose every tradeable item except your 3 most valuable. You won't lose untradeables. If you're skulled (Usually through attacking another player) you lose everything tradeable. If you're past level 20 wilderness you lose untradeables. Unless you're in an instanced area (Some quest bosses, for example), you have an hour to go grab your stuff.
---
Right now the easter event is going on. I'd go do that to pick up the event items. They're mostly just untradeable fashionscape items but the easter eggs are tradeable and heal 14 if you eat them. They're only going for about 1k each right now but early on that's a free 2k  to get you started.
---
1) Make an alt to pre-scout raids with. Seriously. You can bring much more efficient setups this way.
---
2) 3 staminas is enough. 1 for the raid, 2 for olm. Once you get better you can even drop this down to 2 staminas (1-2 douses for the raid, the rest for olm).
---
3) 2 restores is enough, only bring 4 if you have vespula without muttadiles/tekton before hand (which would drop a prayer enhance for you).
---
4) I'd ditch Kharils for god d'hide. The defensive bonus from Kharils makes minimal difference, but the prayer bonus from blessed d'hide can be nice.
---
5) Swap serp for neitz. Serp has negative bonuses for range and mage, so it's just one more thing you have to worry about un-equipping when you're maging/ranging. Neitz does not have these penalties. Also, neitz doesn't waste scales. Really wouldn't recommend serp unless you're going for a WR and doing things like skipping rope (Where the defense bonus is clutch).
---
6) Ditch the sanfew unless you have Shamans late into the raid and aren't confident you can make it there in time. Otherwise, just sip an antidote ++ before going in.
---
7) Only bring Hasta if you have Vasa. Otherwise, you'd be better off with a tent whip.
---
8) Bring more swaps. Torm brace, fire cape, prims, torture would be my recommendations.
---
9) Alch that pick and buy a dragon pickaxe.
---
10) Consider bringing in a DCB/ACB. Doing 2:0 on the head phase of Olm with a crossbow + blowpipe is easier when you're first learning than just blowpipe walking the whole thing. It can also come in handy for Shamen if you're having issues getting the rhythm down for blowpipe (especially if both get aggro'd onto you simultaneously), and a hit or two to see if you can get a ruby bolt to proc at large mutta never hurts.

Professional Overwatch 😂
---
The better player wins a large majority of the time, and that gap gets way bigger when bridding
---
I'd like to know how it got to this point. Are you neglecting your family entirely?
---
I always somehow go brain dead when the healers come out. Idk why, I know the strategy, I just miss a switch once and get destroyed.
---
Oh shit! Is this one of those ill refer to the post if i get banned??  
---
I feel this way about every "i was hacked and they botted me to *70mining*" this must just be on a whole other level, the size of the wall of text feels the same.
---
Justiciar does have a set effect but it doesn't work in pvp
---
It's a mystery.
---
Yes but we also love expensive clue scroll rewards. Remember money talks.
---
I'm still learning myself. Just passing on what people have told me but learning 3:1 or 4:1 would really help you take less damage. I guess it depends how often you mess up doing 1:0
---
Reality is such a poser
---
So what types of items are traceable and can I store them in my bank if I want to keep them safe
---
Cancer says no
---
Don't forget me. I've got a fuckton off sullisceps.
