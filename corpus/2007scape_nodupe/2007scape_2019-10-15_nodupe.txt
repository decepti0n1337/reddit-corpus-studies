Playtime makes me feel sick. How much sleep do you get a night on average?
---
Naw tons of people whore their YouTubes on here
---
Put some money on his books
---
heck yeah!
---
dont wanna get hacked its rough out there
---
An hour of gas is like 5-10 bux though, and then you have to pay car repairs and maintenance. Do you even make any money?
---
I absolutely love these dusk/night pictures you do. Incredible.
---
Why are fire talismans 4k when everything else is 100 or so? Am I really gonna spend like 400k just training runecrafting?
---
Yeah that’s way too high
---
They can change the inventory icon without remodelling, they did that for the justiciar legs (getting rid of the skirt was a separate thing)
---

---
There was a gif a while back where they showed the tool, moving the 3d model around and how that changed the inventory sprite without any additional work.
---
The toxic blowpipe is only worth 74k more than the 20k scales it can be turned into. Whenever the price dips a bit people probably destroy them for a profit.
---
The GE buy limit for scales is only 30k every 4 hours. Maybe people are buying tridents and destroying them to quickly buy tons of scales.
---
I only crash at bosses, no chance some ironman with a hasta and mith darts is gonna outdps me at kq. Crashing at nechs/dust devils is kinda pointless cause it's so easy to anticrash
---
Yep!  Also applicable in streamer's chat.  "Hey @Streamer, I just smoked a massive bowl.  Notice me pls."
---
Id pay not to have hd graphics. Like if everything goes smoothly, then the best case scenario is half my content creators have this ugly ass skin. 
---
If everything doesnt go smoothly, we waste hundreds of work hours.  the engine is a laggy piece of shit like it was/still is on the main game. Loading line rushing is a thing because of the engine update that happened in 2008. Loading screens take no time right now but in 2008-2019 on the main game they take seconds. Game was really unresponsive too at first and id hate to go through that again. Then ofc every update from then all will require double the artist work. Oh and half the content creators use an ugly ass skin.
---
Hey you did put me in the screenshot!
---
&gt; whoever can relate to this meme is a total loser
---
Whoever? My cousin is a doctor, but his parents are rich af, so they never wanted him to risk his grades for a shitty $10 an hour job. He started making like 300-400k at 27 with his first job.

I’d say work on goals such as quest cape, or diary’s, these helped me level certain stats and quickly gain experience.
---
Then it just depends what you like doing. Don’t go for “MAX” 
---
Go for base 70s or quest cape then work up, I’m currently finishing base 80s while also heading for 94 slayer. It’s stops the burn out as I’ve felt the same multiple times on long “99” grinds. Usually only 200-300k exp into the grind.
---
I tend to run a level then switch to stop getting bored.
---
Hope this help.
---
What about if the cork at the top was additionally replaced with a blue elven crystal
---
You could sort by new and see there's a post about it like 3 minutes before yours... then another 7 minutes before... and another...
---
i drive a volvo, my mileage is like 30-32 per gallon. 1 tank would earn me about 200 bucks with about 40 filling it. So yeah I make money.
---
How could he sort authenticator delay when he's already working customer support?
---
haha, me too mate - usually around 7-8 hours
---
People said this in 2013 and osrs still grew. Mobile inflated the numbers. The decline is rather small when adjusted. It could be better but a slight dip is nothing to worry over. One big update away from sailing back up.
---
Just like Eve, just the neckbeards are goatees.
---
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever read.
---
I was afraid of that. The almighty money at it again.
---
You just know that the engine allows only discrete increments for icon scaling.
---
Can we make clue scroll bottles take priority over other items on the ground?
---
&gt; gap in employment
---
I fucking hate that that's a thing. I can save up enough money from independent income (renting) to take like 5 years off every couple of years or so, but then I just think how the fuck will I find a job after... So instead I blow my cash like crazy and only take vacations on my vacation days.
---
Hey just wanted to say u/SuppzOSRS 7th Sleeper is the originally creator of this piece of RuneScape art that I just slapped text over to make this meme.
---
hey cubelock join my guild :^)
---
Whats going on with the peg-legs?
---
Hey this is the guy who donated me a d haroon the other night at Wyrms.
---
1. If 400k is a big loss for you, consider training with a cheaper but slower method
---
2. Fire talismans have a use and aren't dropped in large enough quantities to warrant picking up. Some demand and very little supply -&gt; high price
---
Nice try, bonds were announced 10 months after EOC.
---
No
---
Thanks for the tag! (:
---
Is this what we get when they NERF blowpipe?

Oh shit you're right. Time flies, I keep thinking it was Nov 2013, but it was 2012 and OSRS was feb 2013... damn.

Blowpipe and trident could cost a couple of hundred k an hour

Who me?

If i were you, i’d get 99 runecrafting before jad. And also a t bow
---
Just in time for spook month
---
the united states celebrating two of their genocide holidays is essentially just an annual 99 slayer party
---
i thought that was the joke
---
Simple. If you're at buy limit or splitting with a team, just run south to the gates of the Grand Exchange and do it all there. If the money or items are important enough to you, you'll probably offer enough to make it worth someone's while to run south 20 spaces and run back. Likewise, if you want your splits, you'll all probably go down those 20 spaces as a group to split loot.
---
Damn that sucks. I doubt she quit because of that tho
---
Why do you think that is?
---
A lvl 36 I’ve seen personally had beaten it, so with those stats you’ll be able to brotha!
---
I think the consensus for efficient slayer is base 85 melee stats
---
But its not high reward...
---
You literally posted in a comment you made above how nothing in the wildy is actually useful or profitable which i agree with you on.
---
Literally the only 2 things 'locked' in the wildy are a mage cape thats 'mostly' bis for high end PVE and the best pickaxe for skilling.
---
The pickaxe literally has zero use in the pkers mind and is literally there to try to force some life into a dead part of the game by forcing pve players in so you can kill them as they dont fight back.
---
PvP is essentially dead and long may it stay dead. The pking community at large dont give a shit about actually PVP otherwise the PVP worlds (that you have an even footing against others) would be more busy than they are.
---
All these 'pvp' players that complain pvp is dead but never enter into pvp worlds for straight fights. Preferring to PK essentially a standing target that doesnt fight back.
---
Not necessary true:

Hey man, this happens A LOT on new accounts. Are you playing on a VPN? Did you change IP addresses? Playing a new account on VPN can cause this. If you downloaded the client from runelite.net and NOT a phishing site you are safe. Trust me.

Everything I have said is historical fact.
---
Lmao it's the BiS and you want the drop rate to come down? Are you even on task? And even at that you already know, or should know, how long a grind for a RARE DROP is?
---
Lol acting as if the United States is the only country ever in human history to comit genocide.
---
Yeah, so you could have way more than 100 chests with that many bolt racks if you kept the percentage low, right? Like, you CANNOT get them under that percentage?

It was painful. Had to even do Mountain Daughter quest to unlock a song for that clue :p

I personally wouldn't mind but at the same time I think it's a bad idea. It's called Old School Runescape for a reason.

Nope! I took them out and it's still the same size.

If you even put in the slightest amount of time looking into Christopher Columbus, beyond what you learned in middle school, you would know everything he said is easily verifiable.

First its a sign we can't use our eyes.

Then its so insignificant that it isn't worth using.

---
Papa bless
---
He never implied the US are the only ones? If you believe Columbus and the settlers committed genocide you almost certainly believe the British did across the world.
---
How does the damage boost from a slayer helm work? does is roll damage and then add the modifier, or is it simply a max hit increase?
---
I used mostly Dharok, Staff of the dead and Whip(controlled) from 70 to 99
---
More like the thing about the delicate psyche and cliques. Most stoners I know are more in it for the persona because they gave up trying to fit in anywhere else.
---
TB’s a fun minigame, shame it’s near dead content
---
You’re strawmaning an argument out of thin air to push in this random point. He in no way implied that America is the only country that committed genocide.
---
Some of them (youtubers) could be acting but maybe you just dont enjoy the game as much as the players you're talking about, acheivements feel better when you're an ironman because no G.E. too.
---
Ah ok thanks for the insight. I mean maybe over the course of a few months I’d be willing to camp vorkath for that long. I’m not in a rush to do much else. Maybe I’ll buy the dhcb and dfw, kill vorkath a bunch, and sell it back.

I stopped playing RS around the time they started making all of the major changes. Switched to RSPS and loved it. Became moderator of a couple of big servers, even helped one guy start one. The community of course had it’s toxic apples, but for the most part it was really fun, especially in regards to pvp and clan battling.
---
I love how you haven't used any sort of historical source. Really compelling.
---
I'm new to OSRS I was legit just trying to figure out if i had gotten a skilling pet drop or not lol
---
Most people, even in the US, are stuck playing at night. We get off work at 5pm ish... that’s 9pm UTC meaning we would play 9pm-12am strictly at night. Basing it off server would be more logical due to the ability to switch to a day time world. Or there could be strictly dark worlds/light worlds.
---
Yikes, I just screenshotted the fact that you're [posting on mobile AND in bright mode](https://imgur.com/tRmxaiI). Absolutely disgusting.

You used 22 food on one KC and didn't get the kill?
---
Also why take 2 divine pots when you get 20 minutes (10+ kc) out of one potion?

Haven't played in a year. What's changed in the game?

Runescape was massive back in 2008. The game was still evolving. It only made sense to work on an update like this. 
---
Nowadays? Not so much. From 2008 to RS3 is what it evolved from. Why would they put all that work in just to go backwards? No need and is unnecessary.
---
Use anti aliasing and smooth animations. It looks great.
---
What this is suggesting is a whole game redesign. That's way too much work for how many people play this game. There is not enough demand to justify that much work. Not to mention, they haven't even bothered updating their own client which is what should really be suggested day in and out.
---
They don't exist. There's 2-3 in a game at peak hours and everyone just fucks around to get their 1 finished game for the diary.

It’s not random whatsoever, the typical trope these days it seems is to always bring up the United States history of conquering and killing while completely ignoring how it’s been done a million times over by past nations.

Based Columbus wiping out the bwanas

It should be an in game world timer like most games
---
That reaction doesn't leave much room for when you get a 3a drop from a lucky imp. You'll probably just die of a stroke if that happens. 😅
---
It's a Runelite plugin called inventory tags. Turn it on in settings then right click your inventory icon.
---
How dare people who aren't dead inside play the game!

I hope you get the pet soon. That little Santa hat he gets in December is the cutest thing in the game.

Are prims or basilisk jaw worth getting with 50m cash stack.  I have the other essentials and it seems faceguard would be the next best upgrade by stats and cost efficiency.
---
Finally an effective gold sink
---
No need for instanced west ardy, just do same as nieve/Steve and burgh de rott before repairs/after. Same place, same instance but 2 players can see 2 different worlds.
---
Atleast 1
---
Yeh they're relatively interchangeable to me.
---
Prims offer +2 melee accuracy, tassets offer you +1 prayer. 
---
Defensives don't matter, but if they were to be considered tassets are huge in comparison. +20-25 in melee defensives, +53 in range over obby legs. Whereas prims are just +4-6  in melee.
---
So dps wise prims would ever so slightly edge out tassets, with that tiny accuracy bonus. But defensives and prayer bonus could assist with regular slayer more to me, while matching the strength bonus 
---
And that's over obby, right now he's using bandos. So tassets are a +2 whereas prims are a +1 over his d boots.
---
Is that the you trade someone and end up running into the pk zone, because a character uses a animation stall.
---
Yeah it's old news, and a issue complained to by all.
---
Thanks man
---
It counts from the creation of your account in rsc/rs2/rs3
---
Need RTX for those reflections in the water?
---
If they spent the time training their accounts to out-damage another team and get the drop then there's no reason they shouldn't.
---
That's some insane pet luck. Id be over the moon, not forgiving ahah. Especially from such a tedious boss
---
Now never go back
---
If an ironman does the majority of the damage, nobody gets a drop. So it's literally griefing at that point.
---
“People” here being the small sliver of humanity that listens to screamo, while the rest of the world knows it exists and labeled it with a definition they deemed appropriate.

it's sold as 'belgian moon' here oddly enough. guess the marketing worked.

it's been my goal for a bit to get hard karamja diary done for the gem mine, but what's been bothering me is that by the time I get 100 combat for the duradel task, I feel like I'd have much better moneymaking methods available. Do you think it was still worth gem mining over the other profitable activities you could do? Was it laid back enough for the decreased profit to not really be a factor?
---
I am pretty sure I fixed this back in July.

seeing as how he has knight's sword done i'm gonna go with old/current player just farming the karma

---
Ok wow I really didn’t expect this to blow up this much lmao, for those of you asking yeah I’m pretty new to seriously playing the game. I played it waaaaay back like 10 years ago but I just recently discovered and watched all of Swampletics and it inspired me to get back into it. I literally only use runelite because Settled was using it in his videos and I thought it was cool.

The whole point of a metronome is to make a simple sound at a certain speed so as to tell you when a tick has happened. It's to practice 1 tick flicking to get used to it. Not for making songs ROFL.

How about just remove the empty option, who ever actually uses it anyways?
---
Lol they sound like absolute legends
---
if your slayer lvl is over ~75, duradel is better for both.
---
nope, pretty terrible since their only loot is from rare drops.
---
Actually, there is nothing wrong with eoc right now, there is a learning curve though if you want to go into higher level bossing though. Otherwise people just use revolution majority of the time for afking slayer and whatnot. People left because the combat changed the game with abilities and made the combat system more complex. There really isn't anything wrong with the power level of weapons. Its to be expected that higher level weapons are better than lower level weapons. You can wait and see what OSRS plans to do when introducing higher level weapons (T80+ &amp; T90+).
---
Nice try, but I see a whip in your hand

Using Law and Dust runes in a rune pouch allows you to home tele AND pick up an additional drop.
---
Then the bots can immediately detect that their account has been bricked.

Theyre inconsistent. I'm maxed and I still do the task of them because I can burst it pretty fast and whip drops are still one of the nicest things to see.
---
But yeh they entirely rely on a whip drop to make you money. So they aren't good for that purpose alone. But as a slayer task they give decent melee xp, average slayer and chance at a whip drop :)
---
Could definitely be the case that the drop rate is lower than 1/100, That’s what I have but i’m only about 500 in. Could be closer to 1/175-1/200
---
Did you keep track of how many total clues? I feel I’ve been getting them at about 1/30, which seems high since dragon implings are 1/50 at 3 hunter levels higher. On the other hand crystal implings are untradeable, so maybe jagex felt they could give them a higher drop rate

what a time when people typing from the comfort of modern life try to explain away the deaths of millions of human beings as “unfortunate progress”

There was a lot more to HD than just textures (not that textures alone weren't a huge undertaking). Lighting effects, shadows, terrain blending, fog, water translucency... Even if the engine work was done to support these, it would still require significant extra effort to ensure new content looks right across both graphic modes.
---
Thanks for the write-up! Definitely seems like there is more emphasis on the diaries on OSRS than RS3. Really appreciate your suggestions :)
---
Always feel kinda bad for the people who think that smoking is a personality or the start of a conversation.
---
Castle wars is what should be pushed and have more freebies involved.  Instead of having to bring your own gear you get access to all items in game, but have to farm them over the course of the game.  I.e.  you get items up to x tier to gesr up at the start then have 5 minutes to farm a bunch of randomly generated minibosses for higher end gear.  After which the entire arena opens up, and its a team fight to the death.  Or something to that effect.
---
Some other games have short day/night cycles, in the range of 20 minutes to a couple of hours for a full cycle.
---
Yea that was my next go-to, I just completed the quest requirements for it last night so am keen to stop picking up all my arrows
---
I keep hearing about he spaghetti code, but I want a source on the spaghetti code they're dealing with so I can understand better. I want the source of jagex claiming the game is a mess to code in.
---
Yes
---
I loved PvM in RS3 so that’s kinda where I wanted to head with 07. Right now I’m thinking of attempting some low level barrows, or would it be more worth to keep training/doing slayer?
---
Amen brother

Yeah, chainmail protects from stabby stabby and slashy slashy. The chains wont stop you from being crushed.

Yeah but I figure in an mmo, where the whole game world feels so alive, it might seem weird if day/night is changing too frequently. So finding that sweet spot between it being frequent enough that everyone gets to experience the cycles no matter how infrequently they play, and it not being too often that the game world feels less real because the sun is rising and setting so often.
---
That would be a gigantic change for UIM. No support.

Pleaaseeeeeeee!!

use a chisel on it to get the cut version, then use a chisel on that to get bolt tips.

Wait they are removing emblems from Wilderness Slayer? That is a large nerf to profit gained, are they doing something to Wilderness Slayer to make up for this change?

Just like google rs2 staff of light

Create a straightforward quest with a final boss requiring ~80 combat to defeat to access the dungeon.

Do you happen to know what its called by chance? I can't seem to find it anywhere.

Rather have pet tbh

Maybe. I've been places where the code is so bad I tasked myself with full rewrites. Being as this game was originally independent and coding standards of the era the base is from I'm sure a bulk a code is probably almost unreadable for some (thank god for powerful ide's).

Curious what the dev ops is like at Jagex. They have a ton of developers company wide and seems to take ages for the most basic fixes. Probably a board with sticky notes 🙄

Why does the way someone else plays the game affect you in anyway? I dont 1 tick bones but it is way more convenient and more enjoyable to play the game with menu entry swapper on.

Honestly go to appeal the ban on runescape not oldschool website, but go to normal runescape and go to the support type account ban and you'll see how to appeal bans that are not appeal able from your normal account status area

To be fair, if you're going to block out your name you should show him the same courtesy otherwise hes kinda right about you.

Did you just teach yourself corner trapping
---
Who knows, but Wildy slayer was already nerfed by tradeable T10s which crashed normal emblems from 175k to 66k. Unless you get lucky with larrans keys you can end up getting 10k worth or pure Ess in the key which doesnt even make up for the loss in emblem prices.

You block out your name to make it harder to connect your reddit account (ie person details) to your rsn. Either way what does not censoring his name have to do with anything he said?

The wiki states that:

&gt;Temporary boosts do not stack - for example, a [dwarven stout](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dwarven_stout) provides +1 [Mining](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mining) and [Smithing](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Smithing), and a [mature dwarven stout](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dwarven_stout(m)) provides +2 to the same skills; using them together will not produce +3, but +2, as that is the maximum boost. 
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Temporary\_skill\_boost](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Temporary_skill_boost)

Is that incomplete for negatives?

Also, I'm pretty sure that I restored after the last one, or else why try to boost smithing with an existing -1?

To reiterate your final point, part of life is dying, so even though dying isn't part of living, it's something you can't escape and it's something that is part of your life. Just because it happens AFTER you live doesn't mean it wasn't part of your experience of living. I'm sorry but you are genuinely so lost on this subject. You're basically saying because dying isn't meant to happen in HCIM so it's not part of the mode, sure, just like when you kill a monster their whole point wasn't to die, it was to kill you, does that then mean their loot isn't part of the kill? Fuck no. Dying is literally a mechanic of HCIM, it's a core mechanic of the game, you try to avoid it the best you can but you know you can fall easily and you're always thinking about it. Just because when you die you're no longer a HCIM doesn't mean dying isn't part of the HCIM mode. At this point you're basically blindly arguing until I give up, but at the same time you're coming across as very stupid. I put this at the end so you can't argue that I'm calling you stupid because I'm "losing" the argument.
---
Really depends, some of the smallest ones have been around for years now but they come and go under different names. Creativescape has come and gone like 2 or 3 times. SimplicityPS is one I played a lot and it’s died and come back 8 times now I think?
---
A lot of them specialize, I liked simplicity because of, well the simplicity. It was super casual and was really just one big chatroom where you could afk giant moles all day or whatever. But there are ones centered around clan battles, pvp in general, raids, mass bossing, even ones with 1:1 xp ratios that are JUST SKILLING, no combat.
---
And because so many are so specialized, they tend to keep small userbased and die and come back over and over.
---
Simplicity was killed by a lack of players, broken content, lack of players again, magebets (I turned one ely into 190 in 3 minutes), eco reset that made everyone quit, server physically died, lack of players, etc
---
And then it comes back and it’ll die again. But it’s been years and years now, some of the more niche servers are about the same age as osrs.
---
If you read slowly enough you might be able to understand it. And I never said other countries don’t get shit. Not that the examples you gave matter. The recent China outrage is completely different and separate issue to what I’ve been talking about on this post.
---
does she do burger king commercials?

It's a waste of both players time if no one gets the drop was my point. You don't have to give them a free world you can just be stubborn and stay. Task will be complete either way.

Single the good ones out to paint savages as decent people now thats revisionistic. Fact is only a few big tribes controlled land other tribes were wiped out raped scalped. Even scalped children.  Natives never even had the wheel pre-columbia. And i think its unfair to judge with todays standards and Morales back then it was kill or be killed for everyone truly barbaric.
---
I remember seeing this guy shilling his music on Facebook, and I think I recall him constantly advertising in some music discussion groups and not taking any criticism well at all? Not a surprise to see  him advertising on Youtube for his shitty deathcore.

Use runelite stretched mode for a larger UI

L0L wait til you go over 100 dry on a drop or even a split it'll balance out eventually though

---
Unpopular opinion but I like how they're smaller, makes them easier to distinguish from regular potions
---
Incoming downvotes, but 3rd party clients open up the path for too much exploitation as has already been demonstrated and shouldn't be allowed at all in my opinion. 
---
Everyone else managed to achieve the things they did without these add-ons in the past and I see no legitimate reason for them to exist. 
---
Everyone's argument for them is either "just because you had to suffer doesn't mean everyone else should" or "the main client is literally unplayable".
---
While I understand people wanting QoL updates to the client, it's definitely not unplayable. As for the first point, try to apply that to any other non-extreme situation and you'll realise how ridiculous it is; "just because you had to work for your money doesn't mean I should have to". Another poster commented something about a parent not wanting a child to experience abuse if they did... What an absurd comparison implying that using the main client is equivalent to real life abuse. 
---
Menu entry swapper is one of the add-ons which gives massive advantages over those who do not use it. This is inarguable. 
---
Arguing that these 3rd party client plugins don't give an advantage over other players because "AnYoNe CaN uSe ThEm" is as reasonable as arguing that botting doesn't give an advantage because anyone could bot.
---
A max hit is quite important in runescape actually, since it basically raises your average hit by 0.5 damage, which is quite a dps boost in the long run. Infernal cape gives 4 str over fire cape, and is considered a huge upgrade.
---
Ahahahahaha, they already nerfed Dinh’s and pkers are still complaining, funny, people actually want to live. 
---
Changing how magic defence is rolled has a far bigger impact than just pvp.
---
Really didn’t think any of this out statistically did you. 
---
You want to complain about pking, yet have only complained about trying to kill someone not interested in pking and not fighting back.
---
Nah
---
Don’t be a hater
---
What error? Can you be a little more specific?
---
Sarachnis, KBD, maybe DKs would be my recommendation. GWD is the classic duo spot but his stats might be a little low, something to work towards though

And that is all. I respond to the email immediately so I have no idea why it says it expires.
---
I'm sorry for posting this here. I just don't know where else to get help.
---
So you just admitted to botting
---
If you cant solo pk, you're doing something wrong. Risk more than a dds and cabbage robes you might kill someone. Even then what are you expecting to kill off of a pvmer? Smite them for a Verac's flail?
---
Maybe he just wants to rip a hole into brutal black dragons /s
---
yeah no shit. I played back when this trash came out in 2008. its disgusting like all of the people that want it
---
I am just as uninformed as you truthfully. I don't have a clue.
---
What is the purpose for the proposed daeyalt essence if it won't be faster than current rc methods and (as far as I remember) won't give more runes?
---
I thought the prayer/construction update for menu entry swapper only came out on os buddy recently?
---
He’s actually a 600 lb man with Cheeto dust encrusting his previously black neck beard with squinty glasses and a bad hair cut. He had his larynx removed from breathing in popcorn years ago and had a robotic soundbox installed to give his voice back. There aren’t any cameras allowed in the basement where he resides now because of how monsterous and disfigured he is and his body can no longer fit through the doorway so that’s why there aren’t any pictures and you never see him at all, you only hear his robotic voice when he’s a part of a bot busting stream.
---
I mean you can look at my post history, my clan history says otherwise though. I just don’t go with the hiv mind mentality of prey vs predator because it’s been proven each time it doesn’t work. End of the day the shit that gets put into the wild gets works protected and  you end up with game breaking gp rates, or you end up with bot farms. You were right about one thing, even while I was pk’ing I had 3 alt accounts killing rune dragons, getting 200m exp in all skills isn’t cheap.
---
Is that why half of the OSRS reddit community starts/ends every sentence with lol/lmao? I just thought they were teenagers.
---
Imagine having friends
---
The update made it so that you wouldn’t be forced to wait if you hopped several times in a few minutes. Anybody could switch incredibly fast before, but only like 15 times. Now the only restriction on how fast someone can hop is how long it takes for the next world to load
---
Or for any game for that matter
---
Did this tonight with the boys and got 100M stake from Odablock FeelsGoodMan

Charged scythe on gargoyles and dark beast usually yield me 160-180k xp an hour, 210k-220k an hour using piety. Scythe is by far the best weapon to use to train melee. You can break even/make money too if you do gargoyles. GL!
---
No I feel what killed single pk’ing (ge,edge,mb) was the fact that the learning curve became to high with the knowledge of being able to manipulate specs so you can get lucky and hit for above max hp. Being able to do that isn’t fun or healthy for the game.
---
Lmao accurate
---
In that case you're greatly overemphasizing the unintentional spread of disease and minimizing the deliberate acts of genocide. I own that book and just read through some of the relevant passages. The point of the book isn't that European colonizers should be absolved of their guilt for the destruction of the native Americans because they were just too ignorant about the germ theory of disease. The lack of immunity in native populations only made it easier for the colonizers to eliminate native communities from lands they wanted for themselves. It only made it easier for them to mop up the remaining survivors of the plagues (which again, weren't always unintentionally spread, as linked in the above comment).
---
Diamond himself even writes about this in GSS. See p. 374 where he lists various massacres by European colonizers against the natives. 
---
GSS isn't an awful book, but it's not particularly well liked by Historians due to some misconceptions and oversimplifications. Regardless, it doesn't support the point you've been trying to make here.
---
but that use to be the way the wilderness always worked.... any suggestions on fixing it luls?

ah, forgot about that. then ill stick with ice

It will be after China is done with you.
---
Yep! Two skellies one bloodworm and all brothers = 86.2%! That’s my kc every time and no bolt racks at all so far, always 50-100k chest in just runes, it really adds up fast.
---
Except that 5k mind rune chest yesterday..
---
Ok now imagine if 10% of all comments on reddit were that size.
---
&gt;It was inevitable.
---
probably, but its important to say that while the vast majority of indigenous people were killed by european disease, the effects were not uniform and the people who were enslaved by european colonists (mostly the spanish) were dying in much higher numbers
---
Nice

A legit scam

Runescape has sound? Thinking about it, its weird that ive played a game for 12+ years and only used sound for jad, cant think of any other game you would play without sound...
---
Cool it with the antin00bism buddy
---
osrs will never have double xp
---
Thats what i thought
---
The period the wild was most alive the only content in the wild was rune rocks, chaos ele, kbd, mb. What kept it alive was the simplicity, the ability to do it at any lvl, the ability to have some tank mechanic outside if just running south and eating (hugging rocks, trees etc. btw this killed clans by introducing 3x3 fights in f2p) and the fact that a majority of people ok’d in gear that was easy to get at a low lvl (rune to barrows). I don’t see a solution to fixing today’s wild. Best I could say is remove multi (this would kill the few clans left in p2p), remove the ability to skull trick via using alts with the same name so people can fight back, and remove the ability to stack damage to one tick.
---
You just got unlucky, in another universe a fellow nerd caught you and made you made a friend.

Well the pizza is already cooked and the anchovies are already cooked.

can you pwetty pwease do something

Because 4/20 was Hitler's birthday

It would be a upgrade you buy with nuggets just like the sack.

According to Ash atleast so maybe they can make it so UIM can't buy it.
---
Hiron man, or highron man?
---
These graphics suck. who can possibly support the current graphics, besides the nostalgic factor?  
---
To me; HD rs2 is nostalgic. (as that's when I really began to play rs).
---
I had given it a chance back when it came out and I just felt hard pressed to enjoy the art style, combat system, and microtxs. It just didn't feel like RS anymore. Idk if RS is on mobile, but If it's not it'll be awhile before I can try it again as I'm away from any computers and it'll be awhile till i can use one
---
Please get an infernal in your next picture. I really like these.
---
Can you make it so more active players get more tickets from Castle Wars? 
---
Like extra ticket for X amount of players killed, from bringing in enemy flag and extra ticket for MVP?
---
Seems like current meta is to sit in middle floor of castle (just outside spawn room) doing minimal effort "defending base". And i agree, it is very tempting just to afk there since you will receive 1-3 tickets anyways.
---
It could be done so these changes applies only in official Castle Wars worlds to prevent ticket farming.
---
I see that, but never to late to change the build... unless... you want to go backwards 😂
---
I think she's gonna die.
---
you mean RS2. HD graphics were already a thing before RS3, which came out in 2012. HD graphics came out in 2008.
---
a lot of the combat system can be overwhelming but it's a lot less in depth than most people think. u can always ignore mtx with a little self restraint and rs3 mobile is in beta atm so probably coming sion
---
Your combat seems to be high enough where DH will be the best experience for you.
---
If you're just after experience:
---
* Moss Guardian
---
* Sand Snake
---
* Ice Troll King
---
* Count Draynor
---
* Arrg
---
Points is pretty much every boss minus a few niche ones you can't damage (or not easily) or that can hit you hard etc. The primary goal is to keep as many of the hard bosses (Dream Mentor, Desert Treasure, RFD etc.) active as possible.
---
The wiki guide is perfectly good for this https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nightmare_Zone/Strategies/Optimal_points
---
Damn /u/IronedDown shit on you. embarrassing
---
Wow you are thick l, not that I expected any less from an ezscaper. Firstly I don't stream or watch streams so what the fuck are you on about. Secondly why are you talking down on playing an old game when you are going for 200m all on said game? At least I'm playing the game and not staring at an exp counter slowly tick up for literally no reason. If you get 200m all you won't be front page so you are just wasting your life for no reason?
---
Yeah I wasn't really worried about purchasing them myself, it was more of a principle thing. I am curious to see my old character tho. I kinda miss him. I don't think I ever finished getting a full dragon set. Too expensive and I had terrible patience as a kid
---
Sorry you chinned and think you profitted 800k/hr?
---
But yeh 89 range full void you shoubd looking closer to 2m/hr vorkath. Are you BGS'ing each kill and banking inbetween? Maybe you need to speed up your banking. Woox walking the kills?
---
rule 5
---
lmao if it's been that long since u have played there is a lot that's changed
---
You do realize divine potions are just re skinned holy water right? 
---
Look it up, do a little research lol. Jagex just re used the graphic
---
How about the new pots that came with the SotE quest? They refresh your stats every 15 seconds(?)  
---
Not sure how much more expensive they are.
---
a lot LOL. i went there and there was 1 other guy there and he waited over an hour before i showed up.
---
The last time I seriously played was the Guthix quest (that I sadly never did bc too high level for me) and subsequent god wars invasion. I remember mostly supporting Saradomin but then at last moment switched to Armadyl for some dumb reason
---
Yes and no. I prefer bursting them. Faster task, respectable slayer xp/hr, whips balance you out to make a profit normally.
---
Arclight is if you wanna melee afk them. I wouldn't call it a waste as you can gain charges on it super fast with dust devils, nechs, bloodvelds, ankou and abyssal demons all being tasks you do and do in the catacombs. There isnt a lot of places where arclight is meta afterall. (Zammy, Skotizo and Sire?)

I don’t agree with using arrg due to knockbacks and that’ll make it a lower speed rate if you are afking. With regards to using DH, use the dps calc, I’ve constantly read that obby is better than dh unless you have 90+ hp.
---
i think you mean while guthix sleeps. if so then yeah it's been fucking forever since u played lmao
---
It's a game. I don't play the game to make a noob's experience better. I play the game to enjoy it myself.

But many times i end up f’ing up so i tele out
---
Yes, just the loot alone.
---
I think he's referring to the 20 minute log timer. He could just be exaggerating when he says 20 minutes to realise.
---
Right, but you definitely never should. As long as your HP is over 50, you should use overloads at all times. Theres 0 benefit to using Super Combats over them. You're spending money for a worse pot that has drain.
---
Also i'm downvoted for stating useful info?
---
Yeah lol. I played as a really young kid and then as I started to grow up I had less patience and time for it which caused Dad to stop paying membership which lead to even more not playing of it lol
---
20 min is log out timer not something botting related?
---
Buy back a trident imo if you want to get into raids or bossing. Trident great for slayer bossing, kinda a neccessity.

Then I'd say prims, then tass. Assuming you have anguish and occult/torm

This is why I can't do nh bridding because I hated the fact people would use the prayers instead of smite. Protection prayers adds another layer which is vital today.
---
Rune knives secret broken meta. Anguish mandatory ofc. I recommend DFS+tank boots with void so you get the maximum afk'ability while getting void dps boost still.
---
Alternatively, msb (i) - it's pretty good but you don't get a shield slot.
---
(and if you're at 1000m gp from buying bonds then you can use blowpipe)
---
It depends how well they're done. I loved the light puzzles in SOTE (just doing it without a guide and slowly working it out) but hated MEP2 (which fuck doing without a guide because of the stupid ghosts). Haven't done MM2 yet but that does sound much more annoying.
---
Basically, if I can take my time and work it out with logic, I love it. If I'm constantly having to move or watch out for monsters/guards/whatever else, I generally don't like it (eg. Ratcatchers)
---
Pretty sure you was attempting to sell secret methods to zalcano aswell for better chance of MVP lmao. You dont ban crashers at all, you just ban people calling you out for scamming or being the total bum that you are.

Wait really? Thats interessting. How come, how is the damage frm dharoks calculated
---
As others have stated, wow does this by putting the two different player groups(the ones in the new and the ones in the old layout) in different 'worlds' aka they cant interact. It's not a matter of laziness, it is just going to be clunky no matter how you try to make it work.

Please make more! And also please suggest on Q&amp;A!

Pretty sure its just reddit tos. No witch hunts or doxxing etc. Someone making remarks like that, then you posting his rsn here can be seen as that, for example whats stops the next person grabbing this image and editing the rsn of someone they dislike and then reddit hunts them and fuckd them up. btw he would probs love the exposure this is giving him.
---
I'm right with you bro. I'm 120kc and got literally nothing, not even a dex or an arcane. I honestly would be so happy with an arcane in my name, would be something at least...
---
As soon as you get 77 it's no longer a bad skill. Blood runes from 77 to 86 was very enjoyable and it made me around 40m. I just did it all on mobile on my tablet whilst I was on my pc.

Definitely worth doing, very afk’able. But might as well do it with slayer if you’re planning on training that anyway, but it does depends on which tasks you’re getting. I did both, but most of my ranged xp came from doing NMZ

A propaganda term used to describe the last famine in eastern Europe that affected the southwestern USSR, including Belarus, southern Russia, western Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, as well as parts of Poland and Romania - a region that was historically plagued by many famines throughout history.

Who starred in the movie “I Know”?
---
Yea. Im not saying what happened to them wasnt wrong. it just gets old hearing everyones half assed opinion on the subject, that basically boils down to just shitting on white people.
---
I'd suggest using the follow:
---
Magical secuters for increased yield.
---
Ultra compost to increase (somewhat) the amount of herbs per patch.
---
Get 100% Hosidious favour when you can so you can use the farming Guild. This allows you fight the boss Hespori (you should get some Hespori seeds throughout your farm runs). Hespori drops a seed (can't remember the name) that increases yields.
---
Make sure you're using all the available herb patches you can. If not, I'd suggest grinding out the requirements for them. It'll make a big difference to the amount made.
---
Finally, grind out the Lumbridge and draynor medium diary to unlock the ring to teleport you to the Falador herb patch. I'd suggest doing the same for the ardy diary to unlock the ardy farming patch. Speeds farm runs up so much. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Did profit/h increase a lot? How many kills/ trip do you manage to get? I kinda struggle to do 2.
---
I know that road well, it's fucking ass.
---
I believe you are referring to Background App Refresh, unfortunately that doesn’t fix the issue on iPhone
---
farming level does slightly affect yields. use this  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs) to find which is the most profitiable for you.

Fundamentally unfair/ladder pulling up behind them from high level players especially ironmen 
---
How would a newer ironman do corp? How would you ever do anywhere near the same number of zulrah or gwd. Zammy boss eventually killing you is somewhat inevitable so now newer ironmen have to use sub optimal gear for it 
---
Oh and meta becomes altscape even more, you now have to pay for 2 accounts so you can loot your stuff on death 
---
Old death mechanic simply not suitable for modern game
---
You can woox walk it yeah. And the setup is just bandos and serp for antivenom, lance and defender
---
If I’m just using the teleport back to zulrah after every kill I get about 2-3 kills per trip. But a lot of the time I will use a nardah teleport, and then pray at the altar to rejuvenate everything and then teleport back to zulrah and I will get around 5-7 kills a trip. It’s a lot more expensive but I end up getting more kills an hour. But yeah profit/h did increase a bit but idk by how much. The uniques have risen in price aswell

Jagex can only detect stuff that sends packets to the server, overlays don’t sent a packet to the server, the same goes for menu entry swapper. They can’t detect right clicks, you can test this if you disconnect your internet and start rightclicking stuff, it all gives the correct information. Yes they can detect if you are using a 3pc but not which one, if you wan’t to test out all that stuff for yourself let your friend make an overlay and see if he gets banned.
---
ikr, it expands the game and makes the skill more appealing to new players and relatively easier to veterans, maybe adding some cool runes you can make after hitting 99, some good perks and things like that
---
agree, it feels organic

If it was server-side, then playing on a server close to your geographicam location would make it sync for you. And if you wanted to have night ingame during the day irl, switch server location. Seems reasonable to me.

Server-side time would be cool because everyone on that world would have the same lighting.

Oh frick!
---
a possible explanation is that if you die in the wildy (even pvm death), your death pile is visible to everyone after 2 minutes
---
don't know for sure but that would probably fit
---
Risk pre-death mechanics at best was around a few Mill. Now it's hundreds of Mill. And most places where can die are instanced or safe. The only places where can you die is due to DCs where people's hiccups with their internet should not be an item sink.

&gt;You're talking bullshit, you don't just "download" the bot. You have to pay for it and get an authentication key. I've used it for almost a year before his video (before mobile) and have never been hacked. You probably don't even know the bots name. You also cannot run it in sandbox since it needs a unique hwid which you supply to the owner for the unlock key.
---
Ornate
---
Dds never stands for "dragon dagger spec" in any context.
---
The "spec" is implied when you mention dds. 
---
When you say "dds" him, you are still saying "dragon dagger superpoison" him, implying the spec because no one pulls out a dds just to poke someone with.
---
Alternatively to the other guy's answer, you can plant Attas seeds in the guild that increase herb yield by an additional 10%.
---
I'm not sure what your farming level is, but you might want to save up your expensive seeds like Snaps and Ranarrs for when you have the farming level to plant these anima seeds.

---
But "Pkers aren't toxic, infact PvMers are even more toxic" or something along that line on a recent thread. Even Torvesta's new video show these completely non-toxic pkers.

Exactly especially if you are gambling virtual gold coins that aren't real money...

Can you please fix it so that mobile players can like uhhh PICK UP ITEMS

Wow, you dip into some sketchy stuff like botting and get keylogged. I just can't imagine....
---
I would really like this but I'm not holding my breath.
---
The troll questline gets you two very handy disease free patches, if you have the stomach to grind some of those levels out. You have to do both of the My Arm quests (My Arm's Big Adventure + Making Friends with My Arm) and you get one patch each quest. Definitely recommend for herb runs as you have a near 100% chance of getting your money back with these.
---
Don't stop lol, i hear 10k kills is super lucky :p
---
Sometimes I declawed my fridge too. It's a lot less painfull when it climbs in my lap now and doesnt destroy the leather couch anymore.
---
One aspect of this I don't see discussed very often: if you revert death mechanics, a lot of items will crash.
---
I lagged flicking DKs the other day and died, and dropped like 200m worth of stuff (and even more if untradeables weren't protected). Bandos/arma on the floor. If I couldn't retrieve those items I would never have brought them in the first place. No one will bring items like bandos/arma/etc. to bosses because they're worthless stat-wise compared to weapons and jewelry. If you can't bring them to bosses then why own the item at all?
---
Lmao just left that post, this sub is golden
---
Pure xp wise sure but there are many skills that are significantly slower exp than others, most evidently combat vs non combat skills for example (with the exception of slayer obviously). Not to shit on your party but your rc and agility are notably lower than say your cooking and fletching.
---
That being said, gz on the progress thus far on the acc.

Where do you die regularly that you need to run back for your dwh and bp?

Because I am never going there lol

you've said an extra positive outcome tbh

Hello there

I dont understand how it's so fucking easy for them to hack it. Like wtf I lost my account of many years. Granted all my stats were on rs3
---
Yeah it was worth it.  I’m not particularly sorry today for the actions some guy took over 500 years ago.  For his time, he did exactly what everyone else would have done.
---
same on uk/german servers. usa is more ping but stable
---
Seems like a good plan! If there's ever a day where you *don't* hate yourself after an hour of it, don't be afraid to carry on that momentum! It may save you from doing lavas on more days.
---
Whatever you say
---
Yeah I know. Mine was wiped as in fresh sorry for confusion bra!
---
I'll be browsing shit and it just clicks in my head.  Dunno about the other memers but yeah, when it hits it hits lol
---
nah, i dont mind my chat constantly being filled with people who profit off gambling addictions and naive children to fund rule breaking, its pretty chill
---
I was never aware of this mechanic in the wilderness even tho I play since day1. Wow... Thank you for clarification
---
Yeah. But the full Torag’s set is really bad because it’s set effect is a 25% chance to reduce the enemies run energy by 20%, which doesn’t have any real use in game. However, because of this, Torag’s armor is relatively cheap, and is has relatively “good stats” so it’s a good armor for people around 70ish stats that need some tanky gear.

Deiron and buy a new one.

No, auto retaliate disables after 20 minutes until you attack a monster manually. That was added to combat certain splashers.
---
Do you never let your phone drain then recharge it?
---
What the fuck is going on in h
---
But on the flipside, should a newer ironman really be doing the same number of zulrah or gwd? I am against the old death mechanics based on the imminent influx of ddos but at the same time, I think a real risk-reward factor should also be considered. Currently, dying is simply not penalized enough.
---
This is most likely the minority of the playerbase but I really liked rs from a young age because unlike most games, when you die, you actually lose your items, whether that be in the wildy or pvm.
---
"Venezuelans nervously laughing"
---
Seriously wasn't aware of it. Maybe I just missed this part of death mechanism because i never really die there other than getting pk-ed. Thanks for the clarification.

why not 30 hours for a day? :P

I don't have too much of a problem with people smoking and talking about it a lot, unless it's literally all they talk about.

&gt;This is just a common thing about stoners, their personality is basically "lol weed", and feeling cool for smoking weed.
---
But dude, people who drink and go out a lot absolutely do this exact same thing with alcohol lol. Talking about how many shots you did the other night or what craft beer types you like is the same thing, just with another drug. 
---
Smoking, drinking, playing video games etc... people are always going to talk more about things they do, it's just how we are.
---
They hit the nail on the head with a lot though, the only really confusing thing is that they mention bringing full mystic then all the pics of them fighting the brothers is in the rune armor they brought. Smart enough to know that you don't need a high magic bonus, but bad inventory management?

---
I was kinda torn on efficiency and having nice looking stats, so I totally get that. Having slayer around the same level as my other combats felt really good, but I don't want to miss out on NMZ being so easy.  However that emblem change is painful. I was worried they might've not been tradeable at all though, so 60k&gt;0 at least. If keys are worth 100k and have a decent droprate then I guess it kinda balances it out.
---
:(

What do you mean? All you need in order to make an account is legitimate email account? How do you stop that? What other requirement should you provide to make an account unique? And way to just dodge the giant issue of the duel arena being a giant aspect of osrs... where is the difference?

It should be possible to prevent a bot filling in the account making, so it will reduce the amount. And I was talking about making a start, instead of giving up immediately.
---
i was chillin outside the kraken cave a few weeks ago, and started chattin it up with a guy out there. He had pretty standard welfare gear, and I had just won 10m at the duel arena, so I popped off my eternal boots and gave em to him. 
---
Now we are really good friends and he is a really cool guy to talk to. glad I did it.
---
They could do quite a bit. These bots are extremely common in members worlds, and Jagex could ban them extremely easily by having hotspots monitored. If these were to get banned easily in members worlds, they're not going to keep coming back so easily when they have to pay a bond each time. Then when their profits tank from losing the ability to host in members worlds, where people with much more wealth would be, I'm sure the f2p bots would die down as well. It's so easy to track and ban these bots on p2p worlds, and discourage them from coming back so frequently, but it just doesn't happen. I suspect Jagex makes quite a bit of all  the bonds from all the different types of p2p bots, and they don't want to make it so they stop bothering to try. That part of course is just tinfoil hat thinking, but they definitely could do way more, and easily.

---
It doesn't take away from the ironman or give any advantage to them so I don't see a good argument about why a normal account can't pick up ironman drops. There also isn't really a way to get around pking trading either without completely changing how PvP drops work and you might as well lock ironman to ironman world's which wouldn't be too bad of an idea either

Oh hey, I forgot to add you last night! My Oculus name is ItsChachie, I'll add you after work. I tried out OSRS on it, but I couldn't figure out how to zoom in/out! I also tried ALVR and while I got it to link to SteamVR, it was a weird laggy mess. So I'll just stick to the games on Quest for now! I picked up Superhot VR because I loved the original. Great game.
---
I think that a good start would be automatically (temporarily) mute anyone who advertises their youtube channel with a form of reward attached to it. While the dicebots are gambling, this just is a straight up scam and it's mostly naive kids that fall for it.
---
Well come up with a way to instantly ban these bots and send it to jagex. The community shits their pants over stuff like this and they have no idea how difficult it really is for jagex to develop anti botting measures. What are they supposed to do when one person alone can have dozens of these accounts created and within minutes of having one banned, be right back at it with a new account? Now imagine hundreds of these people with dozens of bots each and are making new bot accounts everyday. You tell me, what are jagex supposed to do?

The mods need at least a weekly reminder until they acknowledge it. Post it in ever Q&amp;A thread as well.
---
 Honestly, I don't get why dying "should have" consequences. I get that some people like a bigger risk factor within the game. For those people we have hardcore ironman. 
---
I think for a lot of casual players time is very valuable. They don't want to die because they lose time. Making them lose their stuff simply scares them off from doing any risky content.
---
No, if I want to address items entering the game id address drop rates (for resources) and clients.
---
Much bigger issues. 
---
Alt accounts is at least more effort, theres no "effort" to a lack of punishing death mechanics, theres no "effort" to a client that tells u all the clicking u need to do.
---
So what u described is a non issue compared to the questions I addressed.
---
I bought like 100 lock picks and rolled up with food and shit and then opened it on the first try.
---
Account may have been hacked and used to bot. Not sure. Still worth reaching out to support.
---
Yeah and if the items crash they’ll become less valuable and therefore more people will justify bringing them.
---
The economy will be fine because it was fine for a decade with these death mechanics in the 2000s
---
If you're using a blowpipe, then slayer helm + anguish is better than salve + blessed coif. If you don't have an anguish, then use the salve ammy still.
---
They don’t become less useful just because you lose them. Every barrows set had one expensive piece because it was the one that was lost on death.
---
Is that an easy way to get Spirit seeds? I'm hitting 83 Farming soon.
---
not really. they've been extremely shitty lately. funny because i planked 3 infernos at around wave 60 blob flicking and then everything froze for around 6 seconds so i got destroyed after the lag spike. wish they would fix it as i never had these issues before. shit is fucking annoying and been happening pretty frequently for the past few months.
---
\^ this. Almost any other useful herb like Irit, Toadflax, Kwuarm, etc. have way better margins. The seeds cost roughly what *one* herb does so there's essentially no risk of losing money.
---
They are restricted from receiving help or items from other players yes, they cannot trade yes, dropped items? Where the fuck does that come into any of this. Remember visafe guy?
---
Next youl be telling me iron man accounts should be immune from being pkd aswell because it brings items into the game that should have been locked to their account.
---
English, por favor.
---
Lol, imagine not actually reading before you reply.

I am returning after 18 months on not playing, I am fairly poor 15-20m and I am not sure where to go to get the most out of the game again... I have never done raids. My only decent skills are 90s+ in all combat skills and 95 Slayer. Any Advice? My RSN is Im a potato.
---
Thanks!
---
Just fyi. You are going to get better luck with responses if you respond to their comment and not your own

Worth it for that fast 99 Farming. I've banked 99 in Magic, Mahogany, and Dragonfruit. RIP gp but less waiting on my next cape.

---
If the server lags  (like on high pop worlds that are no where near you), the monsters and their attacks lag too. If you died to a lag spike, that's your internet.
---
You can't bank those lamps, so if you want to use it on RC, just get it to whatever the minimum level required is for it.
---
the cannon doesnt give as much range xp per damage as ranging and gives no hp
---
Wouldn't need to be a revert, if the items simply despawned SOONER without appearing for others the reason to DDOS is mostly removed.
---
Make the timer start based off movement from your spawn and now you're fine to get DDOS and try to retrieve a day later even.
---
Not saying these are the best ideas, but it doesn't need to be a revert to increase the risk again.
---
Nearly every polled pvp update and reward fails the polls. Since spite voting has become such a huge problem, how do you plan on implementing pvp updates in the future?
---
That's not the problem, thats a risk vs reward mechanic that no longer exists in pvm unfortunately. The problem is the DDosing that will ensue if death mechanics are reverted.
---
Yes you are able to bank the Recipe for Disaster XP lamp
---
Remember when they said in the ironman dev blog that they wouldn't cater to the game mode? Also, the problem with a gold sink punishment on death is that it doesn't sink items from the game. This is legit why some of us spite ironmen. They don't care about the economy and only think of themselves since their gameplay would remain unaffected.
---
You could also keep a normie like I do and learn on that before you attempt the content on your ironman.

Wtf happened to the comments below your comment lmao
---
Thats surprising, because i would get disconnected at least 4 times a day in summer 2015. it was really bad. you might just be really lucky and played at times when lizard squad were asleep.
---
me too + mahoganys, works out well under 2gp/xp (not even counting herb runs), and its going up quicker than any other skills.
---
I don't think this is a necessary change. There's barely any activities in this game besides Herbiboar and Zeah RC'ing that requires the full set effect. Remember that it only works when you're NOT running which in most cases you are.
---
dank
---
I would not recommend doing it for money at 35 farming, you will consistently get the minimum yield (6 herbs). I'm currently at 95 farming, and I get at least one patch that gives me over 10 herbs, and my average ends up being around 8 per patch. There have been very rare times that I have gotten a huge amount (20 herbs), but that's near impossible at lower levels.
---
The head bobbing being in sync with the music is impressive af
---
The current death mechanics are fine.  Having a system where a disconnect or sloppy death can cost you a year of progression makes the game not worth playing.
---
Runed?
---
Makes sense
---
Well. Possibly Ill finish my current task and if no jaw drop ill just earn gp by doing something else to buy one. After update to complete task takes ages lol.
---
You never risk death unless you act according to ignorance
---
I’m 81  with 8 grandchildren and I still love making noobs sit in the wildy

Yeah, as in runescape, or runes - magically charged stones that are frequently used throughout the game to cast spells. You get it yet?
---
To add to this all; YOU and your CURRENT CC are the reason people are creating new ones.  
---
Calling us crashers and advertising your own scamming clan-chat in our CC tells me all I need to know, and to procceed with this new CC.
---
ye and?
---
I didn't think they were planning on reverting the death mechanics? I thought they had planned for items to be "damaged" similar to in PVP? Meaning you have to pay X amount to get your gear repaired thus punishing the fact you died.

A tip for ZMI: use the runelite GPU and extendable zoom feature. Set the render distance to around 50, zoom out all the way until you can see the runecraft altar, and now you only need to click twice every ~30 seconds or so (then, when you teleport, the ladder will be on your screen since you are zoomed out all the way, requiring only one click).

First, the purpose of a monster in this game isn't to kill you, it is to be a challenge for you to overcome. The monster has no consciousness and the developers gave it a loot table specifically because it is meant to be killed by the player. The punishment for a player failing to overcome this challenge is death. This is why chickens cannot physically kill you - it's so that new players have a challenge they can overcome with no risk of failure.
---
Second, you're missing my point entirely. The moment of death is a part of the mode, the aftermath is not. When you die in real life, you may very well have a funeral like you planned. You might also just have your body thrown in a ditch by a less than reputable mortuary. After you're dead, you're in no position to care unless you believe in ghosts (if you do, then I will concede this argument to you). You might argue it's important to the people who were in your life, but when you are dead they stop being a part of your life because your life has ended, thus making them irrelevant. I know, it's a nihilistic philosophy but I hope you can see the logic behind it.
---
Anyways, you missed my third point. Even if we assume the aftermath of death is relevant to a hardcore, it doesn't mean RS3 isn't easier. If we hypothetically say each Hardcore Ironman dies once every 3 years, then an OSRS HCIM would die in 3 years while an RS3 HCIM will completely die in 9 years because they have 3 lives.
---
So, answer this question: If I have life insurance, does it make my life easier than a man without life insurance who can die three times and has no life insurance?
---
I ask this because it's really a matter of stuff after a certain point. In RS3, you can pay like 750k (chump change) to ensure you turn into a normal Ironman after death. There are only a positive gain from buying the conversion like there are only positives to buying the extra lives and, as such, a logical player will buy these things.
---
Thus, it becomes a matter of keeping your stuff for the aftermath (like life insurance gives money to the people you leave behind) or not keeping your stuff (you have no life insurance and your family has to fend for themselves). So, would you say living once with life insurance is easier than living thrice without life insurance?
---
Also, no, I'm not arguing blindly. I don't want you to give up, I want you to see that RS3 HCIM is definitively easier than OSRS HCIM because RS3 HCIM has a system of multiple lives. Please do not dismiss my arguments with insults. I am countering your own points to the best of my abilities and I am disappointed you are not willing to do the same if you truly believe in your case.

Yeah fuck that. My house is old as hell and because of it isn't internet friendly at all. There's a single cable, and it's in a terrible place to actually get a strong wifi connection through the house. It's good enough to work in general, but sometimes some random interference happens and it dies for a good 10 seconds. There's no way to fix that outside of rewiring the house/not having my computer in my room, and yeah, I'm not doing that.
---
Bring back old death mechanism.

I'm here to join the team for the Q  ;)

No, that's pvp combat in the pvp area

I would save it for runecrafting.  The other skills can have better xp rates and suck a lot less to train.  Though that last part is subjective of course

10gp!? Where am I supposed to get that kinda money!

The point of ironman is that collection log is more compelling gameplay than the main "farm gp using best method, do whatever best exp method is/buy best gear, repeat", not to be an additional challenge.
---
Thanks! I keep forgetting about all sorts of new content.
---
2 things:
---
1. Can you add an option to take the ladder straight to the 2nd 
---
    level of redwood trees as entering the middle part is just 
---
    annoying. 
---
2. Remove the trash feature when recovering items on death from the interface at hydra/vorkath, it's not worth the risk of deleting all your items accidentally.
---
Whenever you boost using a normal potion, your boosted stat steadily returns back to the base level. A divine potion provides the boost effect for 3 minutes, during which your stat does not drain, it just immediately goes back to the base level after the time is up. Idk if its more cost effective, since there is also the Preserve prayer, which extends the duration of normal boosts, but it's nice to have the maximum available boost for a longer time.
---
That's a great feeling...now leave it in the dust.
---
You guys are wrong in two assumptions:
---
1. The items will stop being used due to risk
---
2. That assumption 1 has anything to do with price
---
There was a very long period with the old death mechanics in place. Can you give me an example of literally just one item that your assumptions were true for? (BiS upgrade for the time)
---
On a side note, there still aren't any divine bastion/battlemage pots right? Should be repolled imo.

This is those people with only 99 farming and an 8m bank like "can you believe i made all this from farming"?

Palms are a bit more pricey, but you can easily make back the cost of them from just doing an hour or so of money making. Also a good bit faster. With 6 patches, you get over 60k exp a day from probably 10 mins of running around. With papaya it's only 36k exp.

Yoo gratz! I just got that last week, took me 30 tries on my ironman

---
I wish they'd get reverted. They were one of the biggest ezscape changes next to the grand exchange. There's no risk now, no fear. It'd help keep gear prices high too
---
How would that work? Random ppl from outside the wildy being teleported in all of a sudden to be killed by a bunch of waiting spade hunters?   
---
Otherwise a cave of npc's sound a lot like rev caves.
---
Lol omg true, I remember the “wanna bug a box” one. Shit was hilarious as a child.
---
Me too thanks
---
Big if true.
---
It's officially out of the control of player mods. I'm a p mod on my main, so my alt sits at GE, watching these bots spam away, but as soon as I teleport to the GE on my P mod main, the bots stop speaking.
---
At this point I don't even wait around and try to catch them slippin (never happens), it's not worth my already limited playtime and I'd rather just go play the game.
---
In terms of average play sure. But on a gamemode you can't even die once, no.
---
It's a play on words, not a pun.

---
What's happening October 25th?
---
I'm 100% certain that the reason death mechanics are being changed is just because of engine work. This is already a solved problem, RS3 had multiple variations and combinations of fixes for this issue so there can't be any other reason why they don't just redo or survey the implementations RS3 already did.
---
Someone has to much time on there hands, but very good
---
What did they do to my boy Hans
---
The instance thing for castle wars is a great idea, that's what I mean though. Saying "Improve the rewards" is useless since everyone agrees most minigame rewards are god awful, but as the recent LMS/BH polls proved, the community does not want to improve minigame rewards. Suggesting new minigame ideas is my point though, saying things like "improve old minigames" is just circlejerky spammy nonsense that gets upvoted every week in Q&amp;A threads and doesn't go anywhere.
---
Ahh, with context the reaction make much more sense.
---
my dps calculator, and my experience, is telling me otherwise.
---
I really enjoyed the old gravestone mechanics of RS2. The amount of time you had to retrieve your items was based on what kind of gravestone you had, and higher tier gravestones required higher prayer levels, as well as buying with coins. I think even then the best gravestone was 15 minutes. Then another player could bless your gravestone by sacrificing their prayer points, extending it to one hour. In most cases a friend or good samaritan would bless your grave anyway, so in that regard its not much different from what we have now. All it really does is make it more risky for soloing, and maybe iron men if theirs couldn't be blessed, but allows the risk to be mitigated with higher prayer.
---
I kinda just loved the theme of gravestones and seeing them around in dangerous areas and being a kind person and blessing them when I could, or getting a notification that some random person blessed mine, and I could PM them a thanks. Would also be awesome to see unique gravestones for HCIM or something.
---
this is magnificent
---
What if my name is Valve?
---
Add it to django store at least

my alt will have about the same stats as you. Do you think that maybe using an archers helm would be better here?  or maybe just upgrade from the black d'hide to some god d'hide? (the cheapest one.)

Q
---
Every time I hear a pvper say they should add a pvm update to the wild. All I get is that PvPers want a dedicated place to get easy kills from non pvpers.
---
Fuck getting the quest cape
---
Just reduces go per hr if you are bad at the game
---
Any dates been specified at all for when or around what time the Bounty Hunter rework is to be released, or perhaps announced?
---
Not really. It's just a place to feed pvmers to pvpers and not really an update to pvp.
---
Also why does the wildy need a second Slayer cave when the first one is already very popular?
---
i think if i wasn't sub consciously recording everything i did for myself, it wouldn't have been as cringey as i was lmao
---
Irits and toadflax then buy the dip on the seeds. 
---
Like anything in this game having capital to play with is important. Using irits and toadflax will net larger margins.
---
Unfortunately you have to briefly disable it and can't transfer it like some other MFA solutions.

I updated my post with the DPS sheet results.

You should check your inputs, I think you may have missed something.

I missed the QnA, did they talk about 3rd party clients, menuswappers and so on?

because I am sure noone is getting banned or warnings even they said, atm.
---
Does your email have 2FA as well? also, they might have brute forced your account
---
I will after work :) In the mean time I learn right clicking isn’t that hard
---
If PandoraRS is your rsn then I'd be surprised if youve killed anything in the wildy with those stats.
---
If they keep the slayer points option more expensive than normal accounts would really be willing to pay, then I wouldn't say it significantly affects normal accounts. Which is the problem with "catering" to ironmen: when it impacts the normal game mode. If it's more cost effective for normal accounts to just buy it with cash (or BH), then who cares if it's in there at all. And if they lower the point cost a bit but still keep it more expensive than the cash option, then there's still not a lot of impact. That's the main thing, not making it too cheap. Idk if irons really asked for it to be reduced, but if it becomes their main method of getting pouch and it takes longer than the previous method, then maybe a reduction makes sense.
---
With regards to pvp specifically, irons do kind of get shafted with a lack of kill loot. If they allow normal accounts options to not have to do pvp, then it's kind of maintaining status quo to allow ironmen similar options on a case by case basis.

"...there’s other fundamental things that are broken in PvP"
---
Don't do PvP myself but have no anti-pvp attitudes; it's been a core part of the game forever.
---
What are the other fundamental problems with PvP? Whenever PvP comes up, it ends up being a flame war about whether PvPers or PvMers are morally superior, and very little substance ends up being discussed. 
---
Also, your comment made me think: could changing the death mechanics so non-wildy deaths at least cause some inconvenience improve the PvP-PvM relations? That way wildy deaths would only be somewhat worse than non-wildy ones

Heart sank when I read the title. Glad you're not leaving.

RS3 death mechanics would solve that

That’s what I’ve been doing at the moment. It’s honestly fantastic
---
A lot of 200m exp skills reward you with carpal tunnel.
---
True if big
---
I'm really sorry to hear that. I didn't know how awful it felt until now. Hopefully Jagex pulls through, if not I'll be happy to help you out providing I'm back on my feet soon.
---
The problem isn't "if youre in the wilderness its free game" The problem is that PvPers dont want actual pvp content for PvPers. They want to add content that brings pvmers to the wilderness so the pvpers can get an easy kill. Why dont you change your post to, instead of adding a pvm dungeon, you add a pvp dungeon where clans and fight other clans and the winning clan takes all the losing clans loot. (just an idea off the top of my head.) Basically, add pvp content to the wilderness. Not pvm.
---
D
---
You go into a PvP enabled area you're participating in PvP.
---
It sucks because you think it will never happen to you, hopefully I hear from jagex through email soon.
---
Fuck ign I guess
---
Great quest.
---
I think they're fine as it is. Also you might wanna explain why you think your suggestion makes it better.
---
So only 5k have been banned in the past two years?  That's hardly nothing to these botters making 20m every hour these bots aren't banned
---
If you would like to talk about supply or demand and the effect they might have on price, I'm right here. Otherwise you can keep running around pretending you've bested me.
---
so instead of a glory i should upgrade to the fury would be best? I'm asking because i did ds2 a while back now and i dont want to "practice" galvek" with 99 range and rigour and a dhcb.

Runelite and OSBuddy aren't really "clients" they're wrappers around the clients which provide additional info in additional formats over the base client. I don't know much about their code-base but I assume they do it by directly referencing java-objects from the client, in their client-wrapper. If you use C# you won't be able to directly access these java-objects since C# and Java are two completely different languages with completely different run-time implementations.  
---
So if you want to do this in C# you have 3 main options: Watch and analyze memory used by the Client; Find/write an API that allows inter-op between C# and Java; Rewrite the game client in C#.  
---
Of those, finding an API that allows inter-op would be by-far the simplest if you can find one that does everything you need.

Oh right, sorry. I'm a bit high.

Cheaper for you? Or...

Yeah I personally never understood that design decision.
---
What?
---
iirc this was specifically polled
---
Ibwould like to see this polled

Theres a pic of all the jagex female employees somewhere and you can see mod maz and everyone else in it
---
Just like you cant prove god doesnt exist.

Jebaited
---
I know spikes are a common theme for barrows, I decided my design didn't need them because it's fairly distinct from many other armor sets as is. The current sets kinda need their spikes because they're clearly based off models from lower-tier stuff, mine avoids that by having a unique design to begin with, but that does run into an issue where adding spikes on top of it would, IMO, make it feel overdesigned.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Depending on how important you consider spikes to be here, you might either say I did a good job at breaking the mold, or consider my design entirely antithetical to the Barrows spirit.
---
This took me a minute, honestly
---
I switched to diamond bolts for final phase (4). You technically should switch around the tail-end of phase 3, but i found that sometimes you hit a spec and do good damage up until phase 4.
---
Ty lilsmokey, very cool
---
Where are shit pkers
---
Sword whip reminds me of the extendable weapons in aion lmao
---
Dude everyone on here is just going to say its impossible without Tbow. Just get the best gear you can. Arma cbow and stuff. Youll be fine
---
The red messages are not runelite lol, they can be toggled on in settings somewhere. Don't exactly remember where though.
---
I laughed way to hard at this Lmaoooo
---
at top is clan dragon
---
Honestly I'm only bringing it up because I just started play again after a year or so and I was getting some points in NMZ fully expecting to buy some herb boxes, then I'm hit with the message saying it is locked to Ironman, that sort of content should not be locked it is not like I'm buying herbs in the GE, I am earning points to buy something. Makes so sense to me
---
I mean with the ammount of players osrs has they could move the game to unity and rewrite all the code in a better way
---
I want the brawling gauntlets and whip sword in the game from any content please.
---
Try pking someone that wants to fight back dude
---
Princess Neach?

That’s awesome! 70 is low low for a range level to do it. That some insane pvming

What is this lmao

Thanks. Took 5 mins

The only other thing I could think of would be malware, or an unofficial 3rd party client / plugin

tbh I like how they look now.

I'm fairly certain they are holding it off for a "Desert Treasure" level quest for Zeah.
---
Looks like I found what I'm doing tonight.
---
Btw if you wanna give the inferno a shot, this guys comment above is great. Just substitute an ancient staff with a master wand and you’ll be set. Bring a bandos chestplate for waves 51+ 
---
You’ll be surprised how far you can get with just an ACB, blowpipe (use rune darts), god dhides, crystal shield, master wand, and a BCP.
---
Guardian boots for extra defense too, preferably an anguish if you can afford the swap from anguish to fury. The anguish is only really necessary once you can get to triple jads/zuk
---
Anybody going to tell him the quest cape is part of the diary?
---
...You haven't seen Molly?

I'm glad this type of underground lingo is still secretive. Inside jokes are great.

Ok, that was a month ago. Its what I would expect from someone using mobile, not having enough time to switch prayers and sometimes missing gear switches. Its extremely hard to do nh tribrid with 2 thumbs as I can imagine. Not bad though.
---
i AM SO DOWN TO DO THIS WITH YOU!!! Im the same way im at 67 rc i would love to do 1hr  a day
---
About slayer blocklists, if I block for example spiritual creatures with Nieve, will they still be blocked when I move on to  Duradel or are the blocklists kept separate? I'm around 98 cb and wouldn't wanna waste 100 points now if I have to block them again in 2 cb lvls.
---
Even still, why can't they ban these bots instantly? They're not exactly inconspicuous in any way.
---
Looks like the dude that reviews As Seen On TV products on YouTube.

Sadly, I dont have a chance of an elysian or scythe when im skilling, this needs to be changed.
---
Reminder that Avantoe will net you about 11k per seed
---
It’s sad to see really. Watching someone die to a moss giant back in the day was one of the most exciting things, because you never knew what they would drop. It was one of my favorite game mechanics, and I’d say it brought life to the game. It was also a really good item and gold sink which we desperately need now with the gold being so inflated.
---
Unfortunately some special flowers argue that the servers would start getting ddosed again. But you can just make it so other players can’t pick up your items. They changed it without a poll, and it was an extreme change. This is part of what makes PVM against most bosses so damn boring. No one cares if they die at abby demons hardcore afking. Because all it costs is a couple of minutes or less to get back.
---
Anxiety as a protective factor against Deep Vein Thrombosis.

---
Yes they have. They stupidly named the file for their own game boot.ini then deleted /boot.ini instead of ./boot.ini. One deletes within the folder, one at the root of the drive.
---
They chose the wrong one.
---
Underrated post. So hard to get a decent display name these days.
---
I don't think it would make it look over designed if you added two spikes on one shoulder, similar to torag. Right now it looks too plain and there's nothing that makes it stand out or look unique. As I said earlier it looks like a lower tier "barrows" armour. I definitely think you can improve it
---
yee guess I would also sleep better at night if I stopped working for a company that preys on the mentally vulnerable to make them spend thousands of dollars in MTX
---
Rapier is 100% better, 100% of the time. (Just ran a DPS calc on it)
---
What really surprised me was in welfare gear - Verac Skirt, Torso, Fury, Black Mask, B Ring (i), D Boots, B Gloves, D Defender - the rapier has a higher max on demons than Arclight, when not using Piety.
---
But it is also BIS for stab, which demons are weak to. I've used both extensively, and had a similar question to OP. If u have rapier, might as well use it if you don't have the shards. In my experience, both worked out to be very efficient, and practically indistinguishable when fighting demons on a slayer task.
---
I think you feel the body asking for movement before there is any risk for that.
---
people who want old death mechanics are either a bunch of poor plebs who don't understand what high lvl players risk or want to loot other ppl's shit. The mechanics is outdated with current gear prices and progression. Just introduce Rs3 style death mechanic which will remove some gp from the game.
---
My turn to repost this next
---
Never expected to see a Vinland Saga reference in this sub.
---
If it's not too much of a pain to manage while banking, you could just bring say 5 alchs of runes. That way you just drop them if you don't get alchables at no real loss.
---
Runelite still fine^TM just like 3rd party clients have been for ages. Some 3rd party clients have obviously cheat features, but largely cannot be detected by jagex anyway. The whole thing is honestly more of a shitshow now than it has been lol. But short answer yeah, runelire is fine
---
Is the blowpipe/bgs method even viable for 81 range? I’ve just been using dragon cbow and can get around 4 minute kills when may or may not be slow for my level, I’m not sure.
---
Op did you google image search money sneak and pick the third result
---
They persist between masters yeah
---
Who says I don't make $20/hr and have wasted my entire teenage life on the game?
---
When did you start? Last week? a year ago?
---
The idea is likely on hold until they have a Grandmaster Zeah quest to release it with.
---
It is not very cool to unlock a new Spellbook or Prayerbook without an epic quest to go with it.
---
Your qp should be your real gauge for how far along you are
---
Actually, the base win rate tends to be around 25% and it only gets lower depending on how high your bet is, a win being literally impossible by a certain threshold.
---
At this pint just set a skill total for the entire wilderness to be honest they are in all the hotspots
---
Lolol
---
I got mine in 16 kc on task yesterday please send hate
---
Wow?
---
So I "started started" in 2008 when I was a kid and had little idea of how to really play the game.
---
Played  on and off until EOC with no efficiency. (Highest combat stat was 80 ranged and after that 73 str)
---
Now I started really playing 10 days ago, and I completely fell in love with the game even more than when I was a kid. Now I just completed MM1and got 63 quest points as well as a 20m bank!
---
Hence my RSN: Firstrealtry (hmu cus I have literally zero friends on RS)
---
question if anyone's here:
---
Should I try for a firecape cus I've seen some people do it with even lower stats but then again I never killed jad.
---
In addition to all the engine problems, it would make all other fashionscape obsolete and crash the markets. Bad idea.
---
Dyes as clue rewards?
---
Being a student means ur not a NEET dummy
---
For real. They might as well change it so your HP drains to zero and you faint in the spot like a Pokemon for 30 seconds then stand up and keep fighting whatever you were too shitty to kill.
---
Never done this
---
You just finish the kill and go brb
---
What's so important that you can't w8 1min and log out?
---
we all want the old death mechanics but we all know we can't have those in the current day and age. People will just ddos servers and claim loot
---
I can never xlog at dks becuz I'm always afraid something like this will happen and I'll log in later standing in prif
---
wooo wooooooooo woooo
---
Money = Time my friend. That's the analogy there just in case it flew over your head. Don't strap your helmet on too tightly next time.
---
I did 16 kills/hour with elite void/blowpipe w addy darts/no rigour. Multikill blowpipe trips with rigour at vorkath can get you about 20-25 kills an hour which is about 2.6-3.2M per hour. It's still going to take a long time to grind, but not quite as bad as you estimated.
---
About a 2 out of 100
---
You bastard prick cockhole you had me with this one
---
Filter out the text they're typing and they'll change it up. Obviously can't ban an outfit, but if you did they'd wear a different one. And yes it's easy for a human to hop through worlds and ban them, but how much good does it do when they're all back 10 minutes later?
---
No but I'm constantly worried about it.
---
Fucking got me
---
Yeah all rich people are pricks huh?
---
Time my friend
---
And old death mechanics still does not deal with the extreme amounts of hoarded wealth. It will only punish newer players who are more likely to die.
---
Items like kraken tentacle are great item sinks. But having someone with a 10m bank lose their gear is not helping the game.
---
That proves nothing lol
---

Also it makes firemaking more useful

I'm really low on a Twisted bow. Let me know if you can hook me up.

If big true...
---
Sorry to hear that your quitting man :( I’m low on skilling exp lately lol what kind of stuff are you giving away?
---
It makes it faster for more effort, like it's supposed to. But good for you, playing the game the way it was intended. How do you feel about unpolled features, the topic of this thread?
---
Salve ammy when slaying, I may decide to go with the torture in the future but grinding 75 str was more so I had the option of prims later on and save my future self the grind

---
"Boy gosh I sure wish I had 99k gold"
---
Moderate.
---
This can be bypassed by just dying in the wild though
---
edit: being pked in the wild
---
Exactly. I've been back at the game for almost a full yeah and my bank is like 45m. Now, I'm sure it will grow faster as I unlock more higher end content, but if I lost 200m in a flash, I would certainly quit and move on to other games.
---
Call me a filthy casual if you'd like, but I'm 30 and have a full time job, a relationship, and friendships to maintain. I spend my little free time playing a game i love, and if my progress were to get reset after a small mistake or bad connection, I'd be livid.
---
Old death mechanics worked back in the day, but they simply don't now. If we want the game to survive we need to do everything we can to retain players and give new players incentive to play. If a new player spent 5 hours getting stuff in lumby and gets rocked by the dark wizards in varrock and losea everything, they're not likely to keep playing.
---
Bottles exist homie
---
Eww rs3 graphics lol, I wanna think it could be good though
---
Gameplay stuttering can still get you killed, especially places where the boss can very quickly kill you if you mess up
---
The servers are ok, but one little mess up can ruin 2k hours of work
---
Rev up those guillotines.
---
Lol
---
"Just rewrite the whole game without changing a single thing to the end user"
---
do you climax at a 99 skill?
---
osg
---
Just because you breathe heavy over this game doesn't mean you need to be a dick when I'm just trying to be helpful to newer players or people who play casually. I'm well aware of what corner trapping is, I've been playing this game for over a decade.
---
And then people turn around and bitch about PvP and being lured into the wilderness to lose their items. Not realizing they got these lovely death mechanics to shelter them in PvM
---
So many good ideas
---
do people not need to learn any other boss? why would zulrah get a freepass?
---
Also bots in Minecraft are last image

For sure, I bet black d'hide do alright for you to 3 or 4 item with bossing.

How do you even do something like this with the osrs animations and such

But with recolors you can be unique.

yes pls wildy only claws acb torture lets  crash the profit of pvmers doing raids ;)

wtf is that keyboard
---
They won't waste their time banning legit players. Because Mod Weath will be in charge of it. 
---
The more time he spends on banning legit players, the more money they lose. Because he should be banning bots instead, but if they tell him to ban legit players (who actually pay for the game), then they're going to lose their subscription (assuming they pay this way).
---
All they can really do is say it's "illegal" to use, they won't really do anything about it. It just seems like a massive waste of time.
---
The people who abuse OP plugins for pvping remain unbanned (unless streamed it), so why should they ban others for using plugins that save their wrists from getting fucked?
---
They can add whatever they want to their gamepack, but it will just be bypassed. No point in really bothering, this whole ordeal was because one person on twitter bitched about it.
---
 Like who fucking cares man? 
---
Play the game you want to, don't let some OP plugin ruin your fun. Just because others get it easier (and the person complaining refuses to make it easier), why should we all of a sudden care so much? 
---
Whatever happens, will only really impact the public. We're all here chilling with our private clients.
---
That whole set needs a buff. Torag is supposed to be the tank but his platebody and legs have identical stats to Dharok. 
---
I'd buff his defence stats and maybe raise the speed of his hammers to match claws. 
---
Keep his Amulet of the Damned set effect but change his normal one to a % chance to land a second hit at a % lower than the first hit.
---
Gib downvotes
---
I was talking about for 1 invent but yes the math and odds are crazy!
---
Proly on tutorial island lol
---
Design that actively encourages you to not use your items is not good design.
---
Is no one else excited to play with... themselves?
---
RuneScape was always my go-to for low moments. I don't really play anymore though. I would recommend it for this purpose, but if you find yourself sinking into the game and not progressively focusing on life then remember to pinch yourself and put the game aside for a little while, the beauty of osrs is that the stats are still there for you next time you need it.
---
I did not find this to be the case for me. I started farming ranarrs as soon as I could. If you get 7 herbs from a patch (6 is the minimum w ultra compost), you just made about 8k. You have to get like 16 of most other herbs from a single patch to equal the profit you get from an extra herb or two above the minimum harvest w ranarrs.
---
That makes way more sense! It just seemed like an eternal was more than 1 in 1000 so I had to check
---
I don't think he needs any more after Exposing Swampletics

I've doing the same but more specs so it take us like 8-9min ~ i would try less specs, thanks!

---
Makes no sense, the Nezzy already has its original color
---
10-15kc an hour sounds really good, ill bring less switches for all the specs and bring bag whole of food just in case, i could die also and leave some food on the ground just in case, thanks!
---
PVP will never be fixed, the only way we will see a good pvp scene is when we get a place for it, lets call it "arena" where you enter tournaments or fights and have a mmr system.
---
that way people will be able to fight people of their levels and that will led to new players in the scene to not get out of it in less than 2 secs.
---
the problem with this could be "smurfers?" or how you deal with dead wildy, which we already have this problem.
---
Also how we balance the "arena" with what items to use, levels, etc... can be discussed
---
But what if I get thirsty

Those brawling gloves (Crush) sound like a fun weapon.

Considering most third parties don't need to inject into a parent client or modify packets to do overlays it is quite literally undetectable. The only possible way I could even imagine is they scan your background processes while playing which by EU regulations is illegal.
---
I'm finally starting to feel not poor (270m bank). I have 2.1k Vork kills (210M+) and went 82 to 90 runecraft mostly doing double astrals (maybe 100M). It's taken 3+ months of pretty much spending all my time in game trying to make money. 
---
It does get easier and faster as you progress. I started out getting 10 vork kills per hour with blowpipe and dhide, now I get 30 an hour wearing 180M of melee gear. Lately I like to kill Vork until I get 5M of loot every night then do other stuff.
---
I still can hardly imagine saving for a tbow, but if you keep at it the money really adds up.

Could Zamorak's grapes have 100% chance of producing wine of Zamorak with the Cooking cape, similar to regular grapes. Currently even with the cooking cape equipped there is a chance of failing this recipe.

how long do you think it will take?
---
This sounds crazy but hear me out, you could *actually train your rc* lol
---
Quests!
---
You could have been a ONE HUNDRED MILLIONAIRE in less than 10 minutes
---
Just do it. It doesn't really matter how long it'll take.
---
Do it.
---
Early game isn’t fairly important, probably best to focus on quests since they give great EXP. one of the first great goals for a newer account would definitely be aiming for barrows gloves from rfd :)
---
Yes... thats how its supposed to be. You shouldnt be farming bosses in bis gear with zero risk
---
It wouldnt be easy but it could be good for tge game. Making future delvipment and fixes alot easier
---
People are wearing Bandos anyway. It's BIS. We're not getting any new melee BIS armour anytime soon, so I'd prefer if other stuff at least looked better with it.
---
Questing. 
---
I think a lot of the good and fun content is behind quest. 
---
As well as focusing in getting geared and skilled for raids.
---
I'm a personal fan of the "I once named a duck after a girl. They all hated it." Line. I miss that man.

You should also go play the lotto, I’d buy 4 tickets.
---
Shit was dope
---
I’m sure the newer the better lol
---
There is an spreadsheet for efficient slayer training 
---
Which tells you what tasks to block or skip.
---
also get a black mask/ slayer helmet if you don't have one.
---
Use a cannon.
---
Maybe bring up your stats first at crabs or nmz depending on your level.
---
Play however you want and do what you find fun, primarily.
---
But, early game meta with membership is a questathon for melee stats. Witches house, waterfall quest, a few of the gnome quests I can’t remember the name of, priest in peril, whatever.
---
Then work towards useful items like getting a bit into RFD, Ava’s accumulator, starting slayer, etc
---
The fun way though, from my personal experience, is to set a mid level quest goal and work through the list of requirements. Get rune gloves and a Nezzy. That will have you occupied and doing all sorts of things for a while.
---
You can't focus on the xp/h or you'll be disappoint.
---
Just splurge on a cannon and cannon... Everything!!!! Can't be cannoned? Can't be assed. *Skip*
---
Needing to carry brews I'd you're high hp is a weird way to do this when lvl 3s can use 0 food in a kill.

Void mage is already pretty powerful, it’s just that it’s not used much since it’s niche is things like pvp rushing, lazy barrows tribridding or void bossing like zulrah.
---
Yeah, because the hacker didn’t already guess your password 🤣
---
eciN
---
I want to do this so bad but I can't stand the thought of unopened caskets sitting in my bank lol
---
Agree to disagree. What's the point of bis gear if the places you want to use it you shouldn't because of the risk? Do we farm high level bosses and raids so that we can grind slayer slightly more efficiently?
---
Are there any plans to add new rewards to slayer as right now it really isnt profitable enough as killing zulrah or vorkath is around 4x better than slayer profit wise.
---
Yes, hulk hands would be sick. Would love to punch the shit out of everything.
---
16 total runs or 16 zuks?
---
If true big
---
It already did get nerfed into the ground. It's not a better method than existing ones..ironmen who do it just want some early levels without needing to gather essence. That's fine, it's a good alternative.
---
Why would you want to remove the slight diversity a skill as mundane as RC has?
---
Ive wanted this for a very long time. This would make the game a lot more enjoyable for me
---
Anybody know a guild chat I can join?? Just started playing again about a week ago. I’ll be on for the next few hours questing. I’m on a fresh account but I’m almost at 57 combat already. Formerly played from 2008-2012 had a few max stats but can’t recover my old account. The email it’s linked to has been deactivated because it’s from the dial up days so no big deal.
---
Yeah, but I thought that was intentional as a skilling boss to make it harder for mains.
---
Do I think it's implemented well? I can't really speak to that, just didn't realize this was perceived negatively (though obviously annoying)
---
Already got nerfed didn't it?
---
They have been since it's release.
---
NOT FUNNY!
---
any guide on how to get geared and skilled for raids? have no idea what I need to complete for that.
---
Idk if there is a site with all the bis things... But for mid levels nothing has changed really. They added obsidian armor which as a full set buffs obsidian weapons so that obby sword is a viable option. Dscim until u get whip is still perfectly fine. Also yes, slayer is still a great way to max combat. It might seem there's been a lot of changes, but the developers always try to make changes that keep the spirit of osrs and are not game breaking (in most cases). Most of the more notable changes are some very expensive end game pieces of equipement.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Remapping of keys is perfectly legal and safe to use.
---
Co-ordinate based mouse jumps? Bigggg no.
---
The only official mouse movement tool you can use is the built in windows mousekeys. And that's a fixed distance moved in a fixed direction at the press of a button.
---
I'd suggest possibly looking at mobile and touch screen if your hand recovery limits mouse usability.

Damn that's rough, least your KC is still relatively early. Didn't see my first prims till about 800, and then got 2 more in quick succession in the next couple hundred kills. Keep it up mate :)
---
If you're emulating windows mouse keys, you should be fine. 
---
Motions need to be relative to current mouse position and a fixed distance from your cursor in one of the four cardinal directions (or the sum of two distinct ones).
---
What can I tell ya
---
That great mace looks absolutely sick!
---
Yes but you'd have to have the joystick set up that the input is 1 to 1
---
So say you press left on the joystick it'll go left, but it won't keep going left as you hold it. You'd have to reset it to netural and press left again
---
There's windows mousekeys that allow mouse movement with keys. It moves a fixed distance as you press the button. You'd have to set it up through that
---
Basically as you press the button it moved a specific direction at a fixed amount. You'd then have to press the button as much as you need to get around the screen. Its very tedious.
---
Have you thought about maybe getting mobile or a touchscreen laptop or something? I don't wanna assume anything about you, so idk if that would work well

Getting the Music Cape back means hunting for Mimics, which are fun to roll extra loot off of anyways but it can be tiresome when you just want your cape back.  Taking the time to do Masters is not bad if you run it as fast as you possibly can with all the skills ready.  It helps Masters roll for all mega rare tables plus pet too compared to the other clue scrolls.
---
Now as a pet hunter, Masters are actually enjoyable when you get to do them at all, not when you try to force obtain them through "efficient methods" so you can actually start one.
---
Have you tried checking your bond pouch?
---
Edit: checked ur profile and you don't seem new. Contact customer support, I'd imagine(hope) they'd be more responsive considering this involves money. You can chargeback too, but I'm pretty sure people in the past have received a negative account balance and a locked account doing that. So, gl

be glad it was that little. ive seen accts get hit for upwards of $700 before :)
---
Thanks! It's arguably the only cool thing about me :)
---
Great mace, brawling gloves are brilliant! Youd have to explain to me the concept of whip sword, but I'm less keen on instinct. I think narrows claws would probably be way OP and might need a nerf like obby dagger, but then what's the point in them. 
---
Sumnary: love the great mace and gloves. Great ideas for new content! Mace wins for me.
---
Can you explain the unplayable posts? I’m just coming back to the game
---
Mate I'm from New Zealand, come aboard!

Yeah, in the server 2b2t: The oldest anarchy server in Minecraft

Get your strength and attack up by 10 levels(doesnt matter how you do it just so you have 130 combined) and go to the Warriors guild to earn that dragon defender
---
It is a valid method, but a tad annoying, and it hardly forces you to do sara at the end of the task.  Imo the keys are best saved for arma, and sara done with kc - but that's entirely up to anyone's opinion.
---
Dude who hasn't heard of you to. You're a bloody legend around here mate

I understand thanks for helping me out

That's how it should be. Slayer profitting you a solid amount on the way to 99 is already a great thing. When I did 99 slayer in 2015-16 you lost about 100m doing it. 
---
Bossing for money will always be better money than even true profit skills like runecrafting etc.
---
It's most likely in his bond pouch. It's never made clear you have a extra button  in game that holds all your bonds for you when you buy them.
---
And then get teleblocked by f2p wildy pk'er
---
It's kinda like a meme where a minor inconvenience, overlook or something like that is treated like a major problem. In this case the summer pie weights 0.001, but an empty pie dish weights more 0.1
---
No problem
---
Hope you find a solution
---
Osrs isn't exactly the most handi-capped friendly :(
---
No exact dates just "next year". It's currently being worked on in engine development. Also it's a whole clan system. The current "clan chat" is merely a Chat channel that will become a friend's chat after the system is made.
---
I stopped my goddamn car to read this
---
Yeah, cause you got it way under the drop rate
---
I got 71 fm today so I could get tears xp in RC and holy shit wintertodt with 99hp is shit
---
I'll try getting a tablet for that with a bigger screen but mobile is pretty hard atm, thinking of using the windows mouse keys for movement and remap left, right and middle button to zoom. thanks for helping
---
Not really QoL, but is f2p agility still on the table? It was one of the few things in the beginners experience blog post that had a strong response. Is this idea still open? Would be nice to atleast have some closure for the f2p community. Also addressing ability to move around the map, open up rings further to rings of dueling?

Get one of those mice that you control by blowing air into it. They're meant for people on wheel chairs. If jagex bans your account sue them, and show up to court in a wheel chair.

Group ironman is a mode where you can have up to 5 ironmen in a group together that can trade and interact with eachother, but no-one else.
---
It's essentially ironman mode, but with a few other ironmen able to work with you. Kill bosses together, trade items etc.
---
Lmao yup, then 5 years from now, you all will be asking for OSOSOSRS Legacy mode...

Its like you all refuse to learn from the recent past...

Wtf? You think the game is about enjoying yourself? Jesus no wonder it’s going down hill these days...

Amazing designs, especially the 2h! Would definitely not mind seeing that one in-game, in whatever context.

It's insane how different PKing has become.  I definitely spent well over a thousand hours edge PKing in RS2, it was literally the only reason I played the game and I instantly quit on "D day" (Dec 10, 2007).  And even I don't really feel like PKing in OSRS.  I'm sure I'll end up doing it at some point but it's so unrecognizable that I'm not even looking forward to it, I could be doing it already if I really wanted to.  
---
It was ALREADY kind of tough to get into even in RS2, and that was when people would get comboed out by just straight whip hits, because nobody brought anything but sharks, ever.  The concept of a "tick" didn't even exist, I was in the top echelon of edge PKing and never even heard the term.  You were considered "good" if you could even pull your DDS and spec on the next hit without poking or wasting attack time.  XP drops didn't even exist, and you were like Yoda if you were in your stat screen watching the XP increase and then switching for a spec, basically nobody did that.  The absolute pinnacle of skill was DH risking, which was nothing but knowing rough damage/hp thresholds and knowing who had next hit.  
---
And now?  The learning curve is a goddamn vertical line, like you said.
---
Did you know you can get your very own basilisk jaw in game now?
---
it is not in my bond pouch brothers and sisters thanks for that one though

Molly can get stuffed.

Do you even lift bro?

Just up your scaping level! It’s bound to fix something, right?
---
&gt;whats new compared to 2007
---
Start with this list: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/wiki/updates
---
Go to the bottom and read upwards to see the updates in order of release. Combined with the wiki, it helped me a lot in understanding the main changes to the game compared to "vanilla" 07scape.
---
&gt;What should I focus early on
---
If you have a membership, loot piles in PvP worlds around the grand exchange for a little bit to get some money together (maybe a few hundred thousand gp, just to start with; it won't take too long). With that I'd buy some runes, some teleportation jewellery (rings of dueling, games necklace, a glory...) and any starter armor and food you might need. You may also want a few stamina potions or energy potions if running around is becoming a pain.
---
At this point you can either buy teleport tablets and start questing, or train your magic up a little bit so you can teleport yourself without using tabs (with the added benefit of raising your HP). Here are the quests most low levels start with to make their lives easier:
---
- Waterfall Quest (will instantly get you to 30 Att/Str)
---
- Tree Gnome Village
---
- Tree Gnome Stronghold
---
- Fight Arena
---
- Witch's House (Huge HP xp)
---
- Tourist Trap (put the XP rewards into Agility for a huge jumpstart into the skill)
---
Quests for accessibility:
---
- Priest in Peril (to access Morytania)
---
- Druidic Ritual (to unlock Herblore)
---
I'm sure I forgot some, but those will set you off in the right direction.
