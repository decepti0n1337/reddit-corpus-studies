All the power to ya for dressing in fashion, but farming has utility items you need to use (magic secs, farm/max cape, teleport jewelerry / capes). And using those + weight reduction to save a whole house trip to replenish is a massive time save over time with the amount of herb runs you do.
---

---
But again, play how you want. What's your go-to fashion for farm?
---
---
---
i use the g305 its amazing

This is getting milked for karma pretty good.  Seen this a couple times already.
---
DYEEEEEEEAAAHHHHHEEEEEUUUUUHHHHHH
---
Where?
---
Though tbh there isn't much else to wear while doing zmi, you bring a big hefty shield like a DFS, and your dust staff. Then with essence in inventory and that the weight reduction helps. As its a stamina potion activity it's not end of the world to fashionscape but some people don't really care about looking slightly different to others when half the people aren't even paying attention to their screen for zmi haha
---
Thats why I do it. If I am somewhere safe like at the GE or something I just walk away from my PC and do not even log out.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Even better yet is if I am WCing or fishing, I just wait until a new tree or fishing spot spawns, click it, then walk away. A little extra XP while im gone, idgaf ban me jamflex
---
thats suck
---
Forgot about that guy oh shit lol
---
What I do is mine until I'm interrupted (by falling rocks or w/e), even if it's only like 2 rocks. Smith and imbue them. Go back for another cycle while waiting for the blue circles. As soon as they pop up I stop what I'm doing and throw the rocks, and if I run out I just go back to mining/smithing/imbuing until the boss is down
---
Doing that gives you zero down time and seems to give the best loot. I get MVP sometimes even with 71 mining and a rune pick
---
70+ mil gone
---
Yep brews were the key for me. Couldnt do it with rays. Would always run out
---
It‚Äôs not possible to play RuneScape for less than 8 hours. That game is worse than heroin.
---
I read this as "[Suggestion] Kalphite task." That's all have a nice day.
---
6-7m for Chambers, 10-11m for Theatre
---
Not a single mimic kill chance ?
---
Mainly because there's not much point doing any other method after 77. Most do zmi up till 77, and then bloods till 99. Very few will go to double nats or double astrals because it's more effort, and the profit these days isn't even that great compared to far superior options for grinding gp.
---
Especially with bloods 77-99 making 150m these days at a relaxing 35k/hr
---
Just slay and you will have all the cash you will need
---
Those are two capes I really want next, but unfortunately I don't have as much time to play anymore to get that bank up and I got other things I need to get before those ._.
---
Not gonna lie this is a good idea.  Progressssionnnnn
---
I was expecting Chestbrah
---
Nice
---
Hey fuck you, don't be an asshole
---
This is just wrong. I'm at 91 and running anywhere is still aids.
---
Penance gloves are the only ones that are a bit weird and not many people obtain because they only do the minigame for torso and then LVL 5 roles for diary.
---
But boots of lightness are free, and spottier cape is merely a hunter requirement, just as graceful is merely an agility requirement. You have to grind to the low-mid 60s to get full graceful, same applies for hunter with spottier cape. And it's a faster skill.
---
Wear those two slots and you're golden for most skilling / general activities.

Yea but I'm not personally super crazy about efficiency, and lately my bank hasn't been getting any bigger because of the lack of time that I actually get to play, so until I get enough time to consistently play I'm trying to cut costs everywhere I can lol
---
time to bank stand at g.e world 302
---
Not nice
---
I can‚Äôt otherwise if I happen to PK someone with a odd number of charges like Amulet of Glory(2) or burning amulet(4) I wouldn‚Äôt be able to bank them.
---
I think its 4+1 which is 4 raiders and 1 alt for doing secondaries/dps. You can also have another person prescouting so the team doesn't have to wait around between raids

Tbh idk how you find wintertodt socialy nice... its a reunion of the worst toxic players in one minigame... but isnt the competition against player the main purpose of zalcano?
---
Also elf crystals
---
The ordinary general store stock is still at base levels.
---
Cast 1 barrage on a salamander hunter and you've actually lost money
---
ahh yes that is because i am a noob and died from his teleport before.. just picked everything up and didnt put it back in order
---
I say this because people ar ecomplaining gauntlet o ly makes 2m an hour and thats not enough
---
that means you'd have less traction and run slower
---
Fuck chestbrah, Zyzz needs to come back to us.
---
Most people say to grind for graceful and stay in canifis for as long as possible for the best marks/hr, not go for the best exp you can while getting the set passively. Also you don‚Äôt spend a lot on stam pots. They‚Äôre dirt cheap and assuming you use on average three per quest that‚Äôs like 2m for a quest cape. Graceful shouldn‚Äôt be something new players should rush for but rather just get over time by training agility whenever they feel like it instead of spending like 20 hours grinding for something that can be substituted for a 5k potion that provides you with almost infinite energy for 8 mins.

Even if he didn't go there to crash him, he is still a dumb ass for going there in that gear.
---
What are those items for??
---
I think the median (and possibly mean) elite casket is worse than a hard casket
---
What about the GE transactions after you bought it? Maybe you accidentally sold it again
---
Yes.  The only advantage to not leveling it is having a build that's good for PvP, but you lock yourself out of a lot of content like quests and gear that's good for bossing.
---
PvP has a steep learning curve and is expensive to get into, so if you want to get into that later on it's better if you have a decent main account to fund it anyway.

Sorry guys just got back to the game, how do you see loot and collection logs? Is this a slayer thing? thanks

I made so many ‚Äútwin‚Äù and even ‚Äútriplet‚Äù accounts back then (accounts with very similar names/stats) and would usually end up using them for like a week max before the other person/people got bored or stopped logging on. I didn‚Äôt care though, I was having a blast.
---
Why making the rapier potentially useless with buffing the shards to charge the sword? I dont think its the best option... maybe adding a special attack or a buff while wearing crystal armour? Idk
---
H

There‚Äôs a CC heroes and SOA... rip

pretty sure duradel is better for those tasks

The Asian one is missing part of its chin.

yeah but realistically they're just going to follow him around and drop rune cbows

I mean you've gotten both mutagen already, could be worse. Seems like overall you're above drop rate. Goodluck tho!

---
NMZ is a good chance for ranged too, just use MSB(i) and rune arrows if you don't want to spend much. (Elite) void is the best choice to go along with it.
---
I also like sand crabs for super AFK while I'm at work. Problem with NMZ is that if you can't check on it at least every 15 minutes or so you'll get logged out or run out of absorption, then you have to set it up again. Sand crabs are slower XP but all you have to do is move every 10 minutes, and it doesn't matter if you get logged out.

I died a bunch of times, thought I might not have the levels for it...whined in my cc and heard a bunch of people say they died a few times too, with even higher levels than me.

So one to the right is a main?

---
the staff is a decent cheap option in pvp
---
the hood can always be swapped for a farseer helm, but most likely a slayer helm
---
the robes are always worse than ancestral, but you can use ahrims as a budget alternative when maging things with mage def, which is uncommon mostly just pvp. For barrage slayer, barrows, rex the npcs have basically no mage def so youre better off wearing prayer/other combat gear instead of ahrims since the benefit is incredibly incredibly negligible

If jagex will give us a list of rules they enforce so the confusion is cleared up would be helpful.

Slayermusiq does this in a series he has, I think it's called one level at a time or something. All his leveling is done evenly spread throughout all skills. It actually imposes some new interesting restrictions like you've brought up that you wouldn't normally think of.

Do you automatically get a trimmed capes?
---
Yeah to the right of there is no dogs. I don‚Äôt think a lot of people know about it
---
You're right, it does add up but the time it takes to juggle it with supplies in your inventory to bury them while killing other things isn't worth it. 
---
With the Morytania Hard Diary (one of easier diaries imo) you can obtain a Bonecrusher that can bury bones automatically for you for half the XP. Even then bringing that isn't worth the extra inventory spot for some situations.
---
However, if your account progression is done "efficiently" you should even be close to halfway through your account progression by the time you unlock the Bonecrusher, so you would have hundreds of hours worth of bone crushing ahead of you. So picking up the bones and burying them at the early levels isn't worth it in the long run.
---
Very solid advice but i am a lil skeptical about selling my serp helm because having 1 less thing to worry about helps a lot but i agree it's more expensive and -5 mage bonus is annoying. Maybe when i get more comfortable with zulrah's patterns.

You click the antivenom once at the beginning of the fight after he goes down the first time then you never have to worry about it. Maybe you‚Äôll have to click it again since you said you have slow kills but tbh it‚Äôs the easiest part of zulrah

yeah, the thing about reddit is it's an informal passtime to enter into conversations. if the value isn't there for me to discuss something i won't. especially something as trivial as to why dungeoneering is objectively a mini-game and not a skill. the conversation was had Ad infinitum on the skills initial release and years after the fact. if he doesn't wanna do the leg work on looking for those had-conversations nor to think about it and expects someone to do the thinking for him, that's his fault. as for the replies, the value was there for me.

Getting 99 was really boring for me. You just memorize a bunch of cancerous puzzles and speedrun each floor. Its probably more fun with people, but decent randoms were few and far apart and my friends usually weren't up for it.
---
Considering the primary reasons for doing dungeoneering were chaotics and bonecrusher, which we already basically have, im not sure what rewards they would give it.
---
Someone fill me in??
---
You'll probably want to be wearing full graceful with ice gloves, boots of lightness and spottier cape. When you're running with a full inv of ores or bars, it's super heavy so going for maximum weight reduction is best.
---
Okay thanks. Yea I really good find out where to click to be more efficient, but I'm glad I got to that point as a first attempt.
---
Iron man's not for everyone. If this kind of situation makes you go "what the fuck, too much grinding" or "fuck that, sipping antipoisons or cadting cure me is so incredibly inconvenient", you might be better suited for normie playstyle.

Doesn't make sense to use karils cuz the only thing karils has on dhide is made defence bonus, which is negated since after wave 31 you should be praying mage

It sure is, but 18 hours a day of Runescape is objectively unhealthy.  There also is no reason for leisure and productivity to be mutually exclusive, and you can even end up with even more leisure time because you start making money from your hobbies...

1st option gives credence to their judgement, and people with bad ideas need to know their opinion isn't valued or good

It's why when you get yelled at irl you feel compelled to either leave and be a bitch or improve
---
yes
---
imo you've come this far f2p, you might as well use your stats to generate the money for a bond, then members is a nobrainer.
---
Id just use goddhide
---
Darn you got me
---
Yea those guys are usually the ones that end up hitting me because I try to body block the other guys while looking him.
---
Yeah, I've been debating doing farming or slayer first since they seem to be pretty good money makers. I've also considered Agility since it is a good general utility skill that increases run distance if I remember correctly.
---
I've been seeing a lot of these posts lately and I really just don't understand how this subreddit is so damn insecure about its hobby. You don't see /r/pokemon posts that are like "man isn't it fucking lame we still play a game for kids :((" and Pok√©mon is literally, actually made for children where Runescape's target demographic was teenagers and young adults.
---
Stop being so fucking insecure about your hobby. It's a video game.

I mean I have the money already to purchase the bond, but I've heard that buying the bond makes it entirely pointless. Part of the membership fun requires that you have capital to spend. But noted, thanks.

I literally gave away my dining table and chairs this week coz I never use it and just put shit on it. And now people say my place looks like I‚Äôve been robbed lol.

People can't task your shit unless they kill you, you trade it to them, or they hack you. All of those are very preventable

Ah yes, storm of armadyl, it was fun watching people in full virtus absolutely decimate everything at the ditch, it also gave you access to teleblock, entangle and such, bretty gud.

Does anyone have any suggestions for the best run of bosses to do? I've done quite a few quests so have a fair amount to choose from, but still need to finish Desert Treasure and Recipe for Disaster. And what sort of run should I set up, as I understand there are different game modes there?

I've checked the Wiki but found it quite confusing! Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm kind of confused by the context here. At first, he says 'exactly' to your saying Vorkath gear, but then later says Salve (ei) is better, which is correct.
---
Given you just got a Run helm, you're probably on a random slayer task, while using your dragon fire ward?

This entire exchange is so back and forth, like, he's half right, half wrong...Complete cunt about it all either way.

Puzzles -&gt; Not "hard" like mm2 docks kinda is, but like 3x as long as the MEP2 light puzzle.
---
PVM -&gt; Much easier than ds2
---
Length -&gt; About the same imo
---
I've just started runescape again after like... 15 years, I'm out of the training and into lumbridge doing quests. Is it important doing quests or grinding skills etc instead? Bit lost where to start, also is membership worth it this early? Thanks
---
boss fights are easier than mm2 and ds2
---
but the puzzle part is probably pretty hard without a guide
---
15 years, still play 18 hours a day. The Jamflex got me.
---
Uno reverse card
---
Anything below 0 doesn't make a difference. Any negative number is the same as 0 weight when determining run drain. The only thing negative weight does is that it allows for you to carry weight and have it not begin to affect run drain until your weight passes 0.
---
Check out the OP video. It's clearly not the case that weighing less than 0 made any difference in run drain.
---
Do a first run with just prayer gear and pots and just protect melee to get initial pts. ~120k-150k pts to be safe. Then bring a rock cake, 6 overloads, and the rest absorptions. Sip an overload, rock cake to 1HP then absorption pot to 1000 so you can only take 1 damage max. Go to a corner so only 2 bosses can hit you at once. That‚Äôs pretty much it. You can camp 1HP and flick rapid heal every minute or just afk for 5 mins til overload runs out. Good luck :)
---
Doesn't have to be exactly the same place, but the closer the better. With the sheer size of the US, you'll most likely need the same state at least.  
---
Another option is if you have parents or friends still living in that area. You could install TeamViewer on both ends and submit the recovery via TeamViewer.
---
Considering I've done it multiple times, I think I have it right hahah
---
its one of the shortest and easiest quests lol

Done it on release and if you do it without any sort of guide and do it entirely yourself you'll be spending quite some time (Took me 7 hours, with the help of streamers and clan members). If you use a guide you'll get through it a bit faster than the other two grand quests. MM2 took me about 4 hours with a guide and DS2 something similar and I recon SotE would take about 2,5 hours with a guide.
---
I really hated doing Dungeoneering, but I don't think the game should be limited to things I like. What I do want to prevent is that BIS gear is locked behind something like this, like it was in the other game.
---
That ava though

Oh yeah Pharah is literally a tf2 soldier that has rocket jumping replaced with a boring ability because the devs think the playerbase isn't smart enough to figure out rocket jumping.

If OP decides to go this route (which is fine) you can log out and the sapling will still grow (takes 5 minutes max) and you can keep the +5 boost for about 20 seconds after logging in. You can keep relogging before the boost drops to keep the +5 infinitely.

I know this is posted many times but my best memory was paying by paybycash, sending my local currency from eu to usa. got 3 months membs for the first time after two weeks and could finally go through taverly gate. white boots were probably first item I aquired and I thought i was cool as fuck until I met a guy in full dh outside catherby bank. also spent an extra 100k or something like that for dragon mace I couldn't wield only to relalise later I've been merched. was fun
---
Couple months ago my cc did mass cox with newbies for their first kc. One of them got 1kc tbow with less than 3k pts. Things do happen like this. Congrats
---
You wait until the damage starts hitting 8/10s then you double anti to reset it. You probably need to do that twice per kill at the start.

That happened to me too at like 480kc. The odds of not only hitting unique on both rolls, but the SAME unique on both drops. Something like 1/250k? Mine were both onyxes as well. How strange.
---
Once you're playing with Runelite, go to the wrench icon on the top right and then search for the GPU plugin. It changes the rendering from CPU to GPU. Then set the rendered tiles all the way to max. You can see sooo much more of the game.

You're welcome, it's no problem man. If you need more I'm normally in that CC i mentioned so just hop in there and my rsn is my reddit name, I'll help as much as I can. I'm honestly pretty new to old school myself, only about a year in but I've fallen in love with osrs and I'm currently really enjoying raids, another thing you could set as a goal!

Still works there, you can still run over the tiles

The main change I was personally thinking was to make it 50 charges per shard, but I understand your feedback. We won't be making any changes to the Ghrazi rapier alongside any changes though.

thanks alot :D will save your comment for future reference :)

I didn't realise I ticked the runelite option that makes a metronome noise and for the longest time I had no idea what was making that noise, I assumed it was my footsteps or something

 The Trouble Brewing homeworld is world 304.

Thanks for the advice my guy

will do it thanks :)
---
They tried putting bone whip in the game
---
Yeah I do currently have the stony basalt in the Portal Nexus but I am not sure what I would replace it with. Perhaps camulets.
---
I recommend going for base 2 stats
---
You're supposed to camp canifis for an extra 10 levels to nab extra marks at minimal exp loss.
---
You can do whatever you want but how about getting 273 quest points?
---
Not at the moment still need to grind mimic :/.
---
Nice collection!! :)
---
Also, both OSRS and RS3 work under Win XP. Though RS3 only with min graphics, for sure. OSRS runs smoothly and fast and nice, but.... Runelite does not, unfortunately. Or I'm doing something wrong.
---
Really? I think it would be pretty cool to have. Hell, even as a recolor/reskin of the normal whip that you had to earn somehow.
---
Stony basalt and Icy basalt which are unlocked after the Making Friends with my Arm quest: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Icy_basalt
---
&gt;A total of 3 people had access to my account ever since its creation, they all dont know each other though and I allowed them to use my account as a money making alt. Surely that was not smart but that should not stop me from recovering my own account. 
---
It won't stop you recovering the account, but it does make it much more difficult. By sharing the account you have blurred the true ownership of the account. When the jmods look at the account, they see logins from lots of different locations by different people, all of whom know the password.
---
To stand a chance of recovering it, you will need to provide lots of strong information relating directly to the creation of the account. 
---
This is a prime example of why sharing an account is such a bad idea.
---
Np im a pker btw ;) gotta keep my loot inspired tehehe. but fr any wildy questions you got, dm me.
---
Best bet is to ask here on reddit or perhaps try the osrs soa chat, it's sad the lock diary achievements behind dead and worthless content.
---
Yeah was thinking of doing this but 6m seems a lot for one teleport atm.
---
99 rc
---
Seriously though, get your non combat stats higher and finish quests and diaries.
---
They proposed to use a hydra tail to a whip to improve it and the community shat on the idea. Good imo. But recolor sounds good imo, maybe from lms
---
Bcos she fkn hotttt

Can we stop focusing on solo play in a mmo please? Ironman mode was a mistake for this reason.

I haven't got enough time left to dedicate my life to 99rc before I die of old age.
---
I'm 27.
---
Already have maxed POH. But some teleports here you cannot get in there or they have some other value meaning it has to be the item itself. For Example I need actual rings of duelling for Lava Runecrafting but the ones in my POH would slow me down.
---
Yeah, I think earning it from LMS would be pretty cool. Would keep it sort of uncommon as not everybody would be grinding it.
---
I didn't know about the hyrda tail idea though, I would of loved that.
---
Repost Indefinitely
---
You are welcome to do so :)
---
Git gud shrub
---
You have pretty high melee stats....  
---
The only melee boss i can think of is Abyssal Sire but u need 85 slayer for that.  
---
You are more than ready for fire cape if you don't already have it.
---
I watched tv while going 82-95 at astrals then double laws to 99. Its decent xp like the man says and pretty afk other than filling pouches. Was definitely more afk than Wintertodt with shift click empty pouches.

Most people make a second account if they want a pking build with low defense. You should have a main before you worry about making a pure

is there a subreddit or group for roleplaying? I know theres the specific world, but was wondering if there was some way to connect on the internet and not ask random people in game lol.
---
Chaos runes were 81gp each yesterday so that could be why
---
They are literally 2.59m if you buy chaos runes from a rune shop, sell them at the tzhaar place and buy an onyx for Tokkul. They're always been that price and will never be more expensive than that because they're linked to chaos rune prices.
---
Afaik there's no info on it other than it might be a thing soon.
---
Yes its worth it.
---
Alot of people have summed it up pretty well but I'll just reinforce this.
---
There will never be a double xp weekend. If you go to OSRS twitch you may see alot of "farewell" streams. These are people trying to get your account. Dont click on them.
---
Set a bank pin. Its saved many people.
---
Ive been playing runescape since i was a wee lad and never been hacked. But alot of new players sadly fall to these lies. Be mindful and you have nothing to worry about.  
---
Beauty of runescape is how much there is to do and free it is. Just do what you want and have fun :)
---
I definitely try to do that for most things. But if i don't enjoy it i dont do it. Lavas is one of those methods. I quite enjoy EHP methods for some skills, and absolutely despise others. But if you're enjoying it thats all that counts :)
---
Maybe a corrupted version of Azzanadra. Maybe re-introduce the mahjarrad folk. Even if you dont like the game, you could hit up the rs3 wiki to look for zarosian followers stated in the lore. They expanded the lore around Zaros a whole lot.

Can someone calculate both mutagens + pet + jar + elite clue drop chance?

On an iron this is a terrible idea unless you already have the Bob shirt and flared trousers since you need those for other clues.
---
Yea zalcano dumped chaos runes and onyxes simultaneously.
---
Head to brutal black dragons, or wyverns very afk and good money!
---
Not that much. You know how fucking hard it is to draw a bow? Even if you were in full plate, you're maybe using 10% more energy moving it about compared to what you use to draw, say, a longbow.
---
Mod Curse commented on a post in this sub.
---
Why wouldnt you just put 100m in the chest instead of buying one for max cash?
---
Sounds great, doesn't work.
---
Pvpers will stalk these clanchats to get info on easy targets with valuables on them
---
Its a bug in RuneLite. Next time this happens, log in and out so fix it and see the proper value.
---
The piss jugs are a nice touch
---
no
---
This, you don't expect to get kills at bandos either using a rune scimitar.

Graceful is already a clone army and black will be the look to have (myself included), so for that reason, I hope it's difficult.
---

Not disappointed
---
Ah here i was wondering how the zalcano onyx could have such an impact while zulrah's onyx always seemed to have none.
---
It's the chaos runes that did it.
---
It failed to contact the server. 
---
Please check your connection.
---
So you want them to make it easier to farm the already easily farmed items for bots!?
---
yeah but i just bring an inventory full of wine and eat the damage

---
No need to buy a run. There are plenty people who would just boost you. But I'd suggest you join a clan and look to learn raids, you have the stats to go for it.
---
There's also a raids discord, I dont remember what it's called though.
---
A q p
---
Buying one for max cash guarantees you a party hat. Instant transaction. The 100m in the chest means that anybody in the room has the chance to get one, but you're not guaranteed.

Well I'm pretty sure this isn't the problem , I'm not the only one facing this problen , secondly I can open or download anything so my internet connection works fine , thirdly runecape site doesn't open no matter what.

It worked fine till yesterday.

That's true. But you can try like 20 times before you break even on buying one?

You‚Äòd think that when someone can bot through the whole account creation process then that‚Äòd be one of the biggest problems, but hey at the end of the day these bots give Jamflex (bond) money.
---
My kids won‚Äôt be playing this game
---
Yeah but who the fuck uses a longbow anyway?

Its not about devalueing current bis, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre already way too f ing strong so even stronger stuff makes current bosses too easy

I talked with mod ash a few months ago about porting summers end, since CB is in the game but the quest line is not. They have no interest in it, or at least porting the quest. They prefer leaving it as it is, or making their own quest to give Cbeast a purpose and background in osrs

If your weight is -20, you can pick up 20kg of stuff and not have your run energy be affected. But if you weighed 0kg and picked up 20kg of stuff then your run energy would be affected. So there is an advantage to being below 0kg.
---
Yes. An example of this would be if a monster has 100 hp, its worth 100 slayer exp. Meanwhile if you are ranging. You will get 4 exp per hp done so for every 100 slayer exp you receive, you should be getting multiple times that in range. I think cannon exp is slightly different however but for normal combat. You are set.

Also no tendies.

I really enjoy catching salamanders there. Its good xp. Some guy hit me with his tent whip, he was 1 iteming, whilst he was already skulled and then peaced the scene?!! Like I didn't even have time to say hi to him he just fucked off.
---
Yes! Unless you‚Äôre taking 1 minute to bank while abyss runecrafting (LOL)you might as well take penance gloves/spottier cape/boots of lightness
---
recharge your prayer you lunatic, what are you gonna do without thick skin ):&lt;
---
It took me 1.7k for first claw :p
---
I‚Äôm sure the owner of all of these accounts must be making bank if he clears out the inventory every few hours. I dropped 100k into one once just to demonstrate they are provably unfair and I was guarenteed to lose. If 5 people do this across worlds over a hour your getting good money

Additional security features would be good I agree, but this whole ‚Äúuse a number and a symbol‚Äù etc stuff is a load of bollocks. Yes it does increase the entropy slightly but if you‚Äôre using 10+ character passwords that aren‚Äôt just easy to guess words then you‚Äôre fine anyway. Even a sophisticated bot farm or supercomputer won‚Äôt be able to brute force a 10+ character password even with a ~62 char character set. Entropy is usually a red herring in password security, some of the newer hashing algorithms are sophisticated enough that even quantum computing doesn‚Äôt pose a threat.
---
Enough with the raids
---
Don't need stats and it's on the way right there at the GE.
---
I've dropped 100k once, lost it and that's that. But i see people luring others in. Like someone would say, hey i need 400k for prayer levels(begging is so hot right now), then some dude says, hey take 100k and give this guy u can win 200k. Then these people win and they are thankful to the end of world and shocked that it worked. I assume some are setups, but having talked to some of them, it blows my mind that some are real people.
---
I think the lore of OSRS has diverged to the point where WGS no longer makes perfect sense. I definitely support a new questline exploring the Mahjarrat though.
---
Looks happier than me

Awful...
---
Literally no one thinks osrs is one of the violent video games that causes rl violence lol
---
Looks like a typical nig range rag setup, definitely bannable, GL w your acc
---
Why does it look like Thomas the tank engine
---
Mod ash told me that himself over Twitter. The issue is quantity over quality. Osrs is a small team to release all those quests in time if they are made from scratch, porting them from rs3 and adapt them / mod them a bit to fit osrs would prove more efficient and less resources would be needed as well as men power
---
Or just buy pineapples from the GE? They're dirt cheap and papayas already pay for themselves...

The general idea is that US media perceive the general concept of video games as violence. You be surprise the words that comes out of your average Fox News guy

None of the other portals were sideways.

Holy shit

Still better than being multicombat. Clans would get bored eventually after they realize it's a 100k/hr split
---
If you're skulled in 20+ wild, graceful does indeed make your run energy last longer, give it a try!
---
I think it‚Äôs cunty as well, and am shocked at how each negative comment about it is downvoted.
---
I honestly think 25_buttholes may be using extra accounts to downvote that stuff.... the way each one so quickly gets a smallish yet significant and similar number of downvotes is.... suspicious.
---
Yeah he took a break at max, then EOC came out and he started playing hardcore again. He 200milled his account in all skills at that point
---
Unfortunately it‚Äòll only be an extremely small inconvenience for whomever is running the farms, while the bot‚Äôs name is the least of their worries. 
---
Also there are a lot more options for names revolving around dicing/gambling :/
---
I reset two of them to medium, but I did nine in one go two days ago. The flower patch didn't get used.
---
We get it man, you aren't funny

And you could still get them for 2.59m if you bought chaos runes from rune shops.
---
Hackers hate him. Find out how this pleb secured his account in one easy step.

I agree with you guys.

This is a shitty video, and the robot voice is annoying af.
---
I liked 25buttholes.... hopefully this is a one time thing
---
If you have them together It‚Äôs slower for fairy ring access. Better to have them separate unless you want a perfect 4x4 house for 1t load in
---
Protect item is based on the ge value though
---
I've said it when they first posted the blog, it's nothing but an attempt to silence the outcry temporarily. Realistically nothing will be done and they are hoping everyone will forget and it will be swept under the rug.

---
Bandos godsword.
---
I'd say blowpipe is fine if you can't afford a DHCB, but BGS makes it so much easier.
---
Yeah, the average normie single pker is really bad. msb is dumb though 0 chance I'd ever bring that lol. Bolt + ags is all you need. Just constantly fire bolts into them and whack with gs + bolt when unfrozen and they will legitimately crumble. I'd imagine it's even more potent with veng (bait them into ags spec and then veng anti stack it would be easy as hell), I usually just have that setup because im a smooth brain multi bot and occasionally have to end up firing bolt at head of single pkers that get on me.
---
I still don't really like that setup for chins though. Whenever I do blacks I bring the good tank gear just in case actual competent people get on me and just have an alt logged out in bolt rag gear for the little brainlet rats walking around with a salad bar on them
---
oh god oh fuck
---
But why would having defence ruin that.
---
The yield of a fruit tree is six every time, secateurs don‚Äôt affect them.
---
Also check out the OGs of the genre Tanzoo and Virtoso while you‚Äôre at it
---
You would need Elite void and a blowpipe, which requires you to get at least one Zulrah kill anyway so may as well start there?

---
I'm in your position, but I play on and off for a couple hours every few weeks, and even then I would rather spend 10 minutes flipping to make 5m overnight and buy a bond rather than spending money I worked hard for...
---
I'm pretty sure fruit trees only give the amount that you see on the tree
---
I personally don't enjoy PvPing in OSRS at all, so the idea of being PvPed while trying to do some non-PvP content isn't really appealing to me.
---
If I wanted to PvP, I'd go PvP, not chinning.
---
Oh, really? Are you 100% sure? (No sarcasm, I'm genuinely asking as I stopped playing RS for years and only recently came back).
---
You're positive I can take it into the wilderness and not lose it in pvp? I paid nearly 18m, for the little fucker I want to make use of it where it counts... Anyway, thanks for your help based knowledgable stranger &lt;3
---
Combat bracket? Having lower defence allows you to do more damage and access to better utility at a lower level range. Defence levels are combat levels that push you out of that bracket and don't offer you anything particularly valuable. Can't tell if this is some weirdo bait or not but there you go
---
Def = unwanted combat levels. Easier to rush lower level people, including other lures.
---
Off topic, but if you‚Äôre an obby mauler and already ruined the account and have low stats I‚Äôd just restart. You can get an account back to your level so easily.
---
I like it!
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes. 
---
Games don't cater to the gullible. The world doesn't either.
---
Too bad. you could have gotten some nice, shiny new fire lighters..  now I can make elite colorful fires.
---
The goal is to maintain a certain combat level in order to both broaden the number of potential targets for you to hunt, while also protecting you from max mains
---
This. If you add them to your friends list you see that most have had a name change.
---
hhhhhhh
---
Little jimmy sure does love mining.

I care. I think it‚Äôs a crappy thing to do and I think far less of 25buttholes for doing it.

Lol and my highest skill is Rc at lv 90

Then it's still their fault. ''Let me just make this type of account, I don't know why or the point of it but it sounds fun!''.
---
GIVE US A NAME Joe_Bill64!!
---
The recovery system doesnt work fine for any competent user, 2fa on email/account etc etc mean jackshit when you can just recover an account via jagex's system. I shouldn't have to be scared of revealing anything about my identity online incase someones internet stalking me to recover my freakin runescape account.
---
Yes it was changed a while back.
---
Also suffering is only useful in few places (Zulrah and KQ notably). For melee, Berserker ring (i) is way better in the large majority of situations.
---
If you train your defence it would increase your cb level significantly so higher level players can attack you. Defence does not have an impact on your dps output so it's basically a glasscannon build. Fights are way faster between pures etc and you are not like 2 hours fighting for a draw.
---
IP bans should never be a thing though tbh. What if a family member was running a bot farm and it get's you banned?
---
Dont worry man. Took me a while to get it as well.
---
Jailbreak your iPhone and use the app FloatingDockPlus and you can disable the autorotation of apps on launch. 
---
The only downside is you want to play in landscape you have to restart the app and reenable that feature.
---

That rl grind is harder than anything on Runescape tho, years ago I was a musician I was getting out all the time talking to real people. But I suck at social events I suck at being extrovert with a crowd and being a part of a unit in a group, I‚Äôm always wanting to do my own thing. I absolutely hate failure as well, putting a lot of time and effort into a passion only to see it fail brought me down harder than anything I‚Äôve done in my life. 
---
When I had money I could get out and go anywhere I wanted and buy anything, I was still living with my parents at the time so finances weren‚Äôt a problem.
---
Then three years ago I moved out and everything changed and I haven‚Äôt gotten use to it or helped myself out of my rut. For the first time in my life this year I‚Äôm unemployed after 10 years. I have no idea what to do with myself because any new job I apply for might not last long and I need something more than that. 
---
I‚Äôve only played this game for over a year and it‚Äôs been my obsession ever since... it didn‚Äôt cause my anxiety or depression but it‚Äôs not helping escape it either.

---
&gt; Why not? Shit takes time, and idk about you, but I've been enjoying this game a shit ton. They've been doing a great job.
---
You're comparing apples to oranges, game content and backend account security/support are two entirely different teams and people.
---
&gt; It really sounds like "the thing I want done isn't being done first, fuck them". They have a huuuuge back log and changes take time.
---
I'm not asking for them to prioritize raids 3 over a new skill, its not a "i dont like this update, cater to me". It's i want to play the game and enjoy all the content without having to worry about essentially losing all my progress, like many of my friends have because of the failings of the team that manages account security/support.
---
&gt; I get the message you're trying to push, but to say we shouldn't even empathize with them at all is a bit extreme.
---
They're still humans, they're not perfect either. That's why we should cut them some slack. Just because they work on a video game doesn't mean we can't empathize.
---
Cutting some slack and empathizing on a human level are two different things, i feel bad for the people dealing with this and are (i hope) doing everything in their power to rectify it. However i don't go to the store, buy my mountain dew and cheetos, then when they taste funny say "eh everyone fucks up sometimes, ill cut them some slack".
---
Just because they say 54+ to win doesn't mean you have 54% chance. Maybe there's a 70% chance that the roll is less than 54. Maybe the odds are advertised truly until the bet is 1M or more, and then it's auto lose. The bots can be programmed to behave any way the operator decides.
---
*hol up*

What I did was post on the official forums. Not Twitter. I did this like 2 years ago for my main. I wanted to change the password but realized someone had my account linked to their email. Got it sorted out and to an email I own.

In all honesty, jump to p2p ASAP.

The time it takes to say get base 40 combat stats in f2p can be a week or 2

For p2p it‚Äôs about 3 quests and can be done in a day.

Would still be camped by clans.

Your Range is definitely low. 90+ Range, Salve, Elite Void, (no rigour), and a DHCB I was consistently getting under 2 min kills and 3-5 kills a trip depending on RNG

---
scaling doesn't impact whether void is better than arma, because defence doesnt really change too much with scaling, and almost everything you range you dont drain defence. Certain rooms are better with one or the other though. IIRC olm head slightly favors void, but stuff like vesp portal and mystics are very heavily in favor of arma.
---
same tbh, specially summers end, ritual, the penguin quests, while guthix sleeps, the world wakes, etc.
---
That sound is ptsd-inducing.
---
Lmfaoooooo
---
&gt;The build and setup is going to take some time. This is a key priority for Jagex so it will be ready as soon as possible - current estimates point to a rollout in the first half of 2020. Despite the challenges, we think the benefits are worth overcoming the issues.
---
...
---
&gt;Our focus for the next year is on stopping the hijackers before they even get to an account, but regardless we need to improve how we process account recovery attempts. This may mean that appeal information requirements become stricter. It‚Äôs going to take some time to find that right balance between safety and swiftly getting players back into the game. At the moment we don‚Äôt feel we have it quite right, so work will continue on this.

---
Obviously not
---
I'm glad no one did this to me. I would've been slightly upset having my overload time wasted.
---
Yeah, I just assumed it was similar to the old kinda dicing games where if you had to roll (in this case 54 or higher to win), giving the bot a better chance at winning.

But i‚Äôd assume they have some sort of auto lose thing for certain amounts
---
Too long. Months. I afk MLM while im in work

It's a zammy cape :p

In this Youtube video, this guy who‚Äôs like a level 126 (which is a pretty tough chap if you don‚Äôt know already), is like, you know, in a santa suit and shit, out with the sand crabs and if you ask me it doesn‚Äôt make much sense because all the sand makes you think of warm beaches but the dude‚Äôs wearing a santa suit which is hot as fuck (not in the sexy way) (but in a sexy way) and basically he‚Äôs going up to pures (which means they don‚Äôt eat meat or vegetables I think) and he offers them this thing called a noose wand, which is like a stick with a hanging rope thing on it and then he tells them to whack the crab rangoons waddling around on the beach because it‚Äôs better than the scimitars they‚Äôre using,  and so the pures are all like ‚Äúfuck yeah, I‚Äôll take this free kajigger and try it out omg tyvm I have a stiffy‚Äù and then they spend like five minutes trying to figure out how to equip it because they‚Äôre small Chinese children or something that have never actually played the game and the whole point of them is to not eat their meats and veggies and just be fruits for some white person somewhere so they don‚Äôt have to actually play the game and the little person running the account gets like a whole dollar or something for their endless hours of crab whacking so anyway they finally equip the noose wand (or ‚Äúgoose wand‚Äù as I like to call it hehehee I‚Äôm so funny sometimes lol) and then they tickle the lobbie with it but HAHA joke‚Äôs on them because the noose wand only gives defense experience and people who eat fruit must not like to train defense but then they hit a couple times and their defense goes up and the first little kid that did it realized it and was like all sad and shit so he tried to run away from the  desert lobbies but the jokes on him again haha he had auto retaliate on (which means they keep poking each other like my dad and uncle billy do)  so he got fucked in that sense and the guy in the sexy santa outfit laughed at him and hurt his feelings but it was still pretty funny and then there was the second little human-bot that was really dumb and he just kept using the noose wand on the crabs and kept getting his defense levels up and didn‚Äôt unequip the wand and it was funny and then the guy narrating with the spooky Microsoft Sam voice mentioned some guy on reddit who doesn‚Äôt eat his meats and veggies called him out and tried to warn the other white people who have their own little flesh bots to not talk to santa or play with the goose wand because they will get defense experience and then he told everyone (us) to smash that like button and put our winkies all over the subscribe button and then that was it.

I recovered a 10+ year old account I had that was permabanned years ago by just giving them as much information as I had in the ticket. You don't need everything, but I also provided explanation on why I couldn't provide some details. Hope you can get the account back!
---
So after putting out multiple Dev Blogs detailing all the things that are in the works and going over how much they need to rework their backend systems to make these changes, you can't even wait two months before going "where is it?". Only a couple of features were labeled as "coming soon" and while within the month would be soon, I wouldn't say we're past soon yet.
---
&gt; Jagex is so worried about people splashing in Lumby and confusing new players 
---
Dude jagex didnt give a fuck about this, the community relentlessly complained until they finally did something about it. Thats a simple problem to take care of anyway as we saw. Botting and such is a much harder problem to take care of cause theres one simple solution that would get rid of all of these bots.

Check my other comment.
---
&gt; 1.	‚Å†This is Old School. 10+ or 15+ Old School accounts don't make any sense. If you recovering an account, that's for Runescape because in Old School you'd be sent to Tutorial Island. If you're talking about 10+ email account, jump to step 2) :)
---
Just because OSRS isn‚Äôt 10 years old yet doesn‚Äôt mean that people‚Äôs are accounts aren‚Äôt older. When you make an account for RS3 you are able to log into OSRS with the same account (even though it‚Äôll boot you to tutorial island). That means that even though OSRS isn‚Äôt very old you can still have an OSRS account that is much older. If you go to Hans in Lumbridge you can see for yourself how old the account is and in this case this persons account is 15+ years old by definition.

---
There really aren't that many actual engine developers on Old School or at Jagex in general (most are "content developers" who use RuneScript) and it's probably something on their backlog to fix.  Hiring more people wouldn't really fix the issue in the short term since you're looking at at least 3-6 months for them to come up to speed with how the product works and that would be at the expense of the productivity of the existing team.
---
It's weird because if someone is having an issue, what's the harm in literally just creating an account to solve the issue and delete it afterwards?
---
Lots of companies use Twitter as a support platform, whilst I totally agree this shouldn't be the case the fact that you're denying a potential solution due to "I don't want it" is honestly baffling to me.

I reacted on this thread to help a guy out, if you want to downvote me for that be my guest.

Pasta for android as some people couldn't find it: 
---
I wanted to share this incase anyone wanted to use it. 
---
I'm doing this on android. Using a app called ultimate rotation control you can force auto rotation, with this switch on open your osrs app. This will give you a small login screen at the top. (This expands when you log in) once you've logged in you can also lock rotation so it doesn't change. 
---
Pros:I found this made Agility training alot easier as you can play one handed. Don't look like a nerd in public.

I'm sure you can come up with other great uses for this.

 Cons: inventory ui etc. Is rather small.

Respawn tele to camelot for catherby patches (now obsolete with POH catherby).
---
Interesting. Alright, thanks
---
Ya they're both blue lmao
---
My forum picture is a blue phat and has been ever since forum pictures came out.  My login name is visible in old pk videos of mine that I leave public.  My login name is extremy similar to my current name.  People in OSRS always asked me how I had a tbow at level 90, I told them about the several phats I owned in RS3.  My membership hasn't run out for 13+ years, so it should be easy for people to guess when my account was made.  Why haven't I been hacked?
---
You could even assert...guthix may be asleep at this point

I believe taking the fact it happened back to back, about 1/7bil

ok

zulrah/vork until 100m then raids 1

Scythe seems pretty good and it's a 5-tick weapon.

how does the price of an uncut onyx affect the price on chaos runes? and please don't tell me it's because of ironmen.  
---
Runes and ores are crashing because Zalcano shit them out the first week and a bit off the release of song of the elves
---
Hahah you're very right
---
next time do !remind me 5 hour
---
It's also safer in P3, especially for webs, and DD ball. He still whips verzik, it's not like he is at a disadvantage with a tbow lol

Giving out free money is extremely rare. Always suspect a lure or scam.

This has blown up since EVscapes video. I believe it's completely legal I'd you use in-game keys for it's a 1 click in/out. I think you were a false positive
---
Hmm, I did hear of a few people having that issue lately. Nobody has been sure of why so far though.
---
There should be an option to submit a ticket for a different issue (like payment or whatever), you could try just using that to submit your issue?
---
Doubt they'd just ignore it.
---
Only reason I mentioned Twitter is because it's usually the fastest solution, whilst this shouldn't be the case I only offered a potential solution for contacting support. :)

Voting no to warding only wastes money and time already spent, this shit is already made, in case people forgot.

I once was given 100m by some random who said he was quitting in world 73.

No bs, just gave me and 4 others the cash

I agree it's a dick move, but I wouldn't call it unfair when any pure with a brain should know to check which combat style you're using, to make sure it won't train defence. There are a lot of real world examples of corporations taking advantage of stupid/misinformed people and selling useless products, it's no more unethical than that. It's not like they have to know/remember it for every weapon, you just have to check the combat style you're going to attack with, especially when using new/unfamiliar weapons. Takes less than 2 seconds to look at the combat style/spec interface to double check. This trick and even specifically the noose wand itself is the oldest trick in the book, I got my pure ruined nearly the exact same way around 2009-2010 when I was younger and stupid. I deserved it (greed on my part, was a different setup, guy did a big stake vs nothing and said I have to use the noose wand), and I learned from it.
---
Report it as a bug ingame
---
In the very slim chance this ends up being helpful:
---
I was in a similar, albeit less dire, situation with some old EA games I had licenses for. They were licensed to an old Yahoo account I had stopped using for nearly a decade, but my EA account used that email. I thought it was a lost cause.
---
It turned out that Yahoo had *deleted that address* entirely. But this ended up working to my advantage. I was able to create a brand-new account using that old email address. And sure enough, it worked. **Anyone** could have done this in the time it was deactivated, but I suppose it was unique enough that no one ever attempted to.
---
I was able to reset my EA account like this, since EA just sent it to that email address as if it never got deactivated in the first place.
---
Regardless of the email provider, I encourage you to try recreating that email account with the same email address. If it's old enough, you may be able to just make a new account with it and regain access like that.
---
Good luck OP!!
---
No it's your own clouded viewpoint. People in this thread want to support through merch, and my argument is that's perfectly fine lol. You're just a deluded person, touting some conspiratorial opinion where people are buying hordes of clothes to throw away.

Dont use obby sword if u dont have the full obby set. Otherwise use dscim.

I play rs like so.. Everyone wants to scam me. My group of friends is very tight and very small. Am I missing out on experiences with a lot of cool people? Yes! Have I ever been scammed? No.

Unless you count that one one I got yeeted for a bcp by some random guy at bandos a few months ago. (Which further hacks up my everyone is trying to scam me claim lol)

Well, non degradable blade would turn useful, but what the heck farming 5k shards is a hell of a ride, wouldn't change it's price due to its extreme rarity, nobody farms the gauntlet except for pets.
---
Imagine it's still +50m and you pay virtually 100M shards and in opportunity cost a ton more. It will be more expensive than a rapier..
---
I think it just won't work, everything about the item is wrong. Grindability makes it too scarce, usability makes it worthless and maintenance makes it expensive as fuck.

I personally don't like Twitter's privacy policy at all, but I have a Twitter. I totally understand why someone wouldn't want one though. Also I think if you delete your Twitter, you really only exit the agreement if you're in the EU because of their privacy laws IIRC.
---
it's a little bit cunty, but it's also not a huge deal. 1 extra defense level is pretty much irrelevant, it wouldn't even be enough to change their combat level 99% of the time. 
---
It's stupid but mostly harmless, so people laugh. And now those guys will always triple check before using a weapon they aren't familiar with
---
Great meme.
---
Bots will *always* find something to make money with, then we would just all be playing Ironmen. 
---
You also say "etc", but how far would you go? Just up to willow or all logs? That would kill things like birdhouse runs, fetching (and thus somewhat alching since people alch their fletched bows often), and definitely firemaking.  But bots would just kill green dragons for example, and you'd have the same problem unless you want to kill prayer
---
It would be really difficult to stop bots while also keeping normal gameplay intact, since normal gameplay is so bottable
---
 I remember opening one of this guys streams recently and let me tell you, what a fucking gamer. His opening intro was just this fast paced trance music and it cuts into him doing 1tick 6 way gear swaps and fakies in this tribridding fight. He literally destroyed this guy so hard and dropped him for max gear it was fantastic quality and skill. I dropped a follow and subscribed with my twitch prime. Just on the side of this pking screen, he had another account doing 3tick 5g mining in the quarry. His next stream that I caught, he was completing a solo ToB and it was like the 5th in a row he had done. This guy is a fucking gamer and probably the most versatile and experienced player in Oldschool aside from Woox. He's top tier in skilling, PvP and PvM. What a fucking gamer

How much did that AGS cost you?

Comments like these remind me why the community can't seem to grasp that large projects take months, if not longer, as opposed to a few weeks.

Single pking doesn‚Äôt stop me from bringing my team of 30 and pjing me off one at a time. Wilderness is dead content unless Jagex makes a pj timer of some kind
---
Not really into this one tbh. Should people be punished for being stupid? Probably. Accounts ruined? Probs not.
---
Thanks! I'm struggling with 3, keep getting the head out of phase and having to run around like crazy. I think that's my issue.
---
I might be getting woosh'd right now, but they come from Chambers of Xeric (raids 1 or commonly referred to as CoX)
---
Nice, what stats?
---
The game had a vote on whether or not we should have an NPC to remove defense levels and people said no, so obviously us pkers aren't welcome in this game and should expect the community to do things like this.
---
I honestly kind of like this. It definitely panders to the idea of easyscape but as long as it has difficult unlocks just like how the block list is, I'd be okay with something like this.
---
Maybe ill finally get cerb pet if i do 9 million hellhound tasks
---
It 1000% makes a difference if it's a game or not. Have you like literally never done anything time consuming in real life?
---
while you are learning you can bring in a full inv of stams (pre prep) and suicide-reset phase 3 if you want to just get in a ton of practice in a single raid.
---
Tent whip is cheap af its not going anywhere.
---
Next time vote yes on the NPC to remove defense levels
---
they should make a quest called while guthix poops
---
Yeah definitely might be an issue with a clan chat. Maybe a private invite only subreddit though?
---
You didn't post a voice recording of you saying this lol what an insecure manlet you must be
---
Glad you enjoyed :D
---
That was the completionist cape. Basically required more than maxed cape. Requirements included things like 120 dungeoneering (only needed 99 for max cape), all diaries completed, and so on.
---
You were the cunts who voted no on the NPC that removes defense level

Shut the fuck up

It's 40 minutes of boring just running around... however... I did realize as an adult the dialog is pretty funny at times... which helps...

dhcb rubys since you only use it at olm head really, outside maybe occasional shots at shams/mystics when luring
---
Yeah but you're not the only one playing. An individual could win while another loses. Everyone hopes they'll be the winner.
---
You sit at the ge to much
---
It is still rosy
---
Such a quality episode
---
What? Back in the day people talked all the time! I did most of the random shit I did because of random players.

It's almost as if there's always exceptions. Gz on not getting hacked

To each their own, but I would highly recommend that ironmen use the temple so no one can crash and steal their drop.
---
It might depend on the community, but I've never considered one of my scripts to be "banned", just the individual accounts. I've seen waves completely annihilate certain scripts though, primarily the type being talked about here. Where people can simply roll 10+ accounts onto one client and just go ham.
---
Nope but i like the footage
---
Love it
---
Garaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaage
---
Great to know, I really appreciate your in depth answer. Thanks! It has been a really long time since I have started fresh off of tutorial island so putting a plan together for all my skills and questing is important.

I dont think recording audio really was neccessary here...
---
oo nooo 29 kc and hasnt got a 1/128 berserker ring yet pooor you
---
Nope. I just like the meme :p
---
This is crazy, I don't think about it much bc it happened about 10-11 years ago now but my house burned down when I was a kid while I was fishing lobsters in catherby. My sister and I were home alone and I smelled something so I yelled to her and asked if she was cooking anything and she said no so I went back to my lobbies for about 10 more minutes. Then I smelled it again and went into the kitchen and the whole goddamn patio out back was up in flames. So I ran outside and put it out with the garden hose but it was too late it had already gone up into the little overhang at the edge of the roof and into the attic.

Nah, Tirannwn is functional.

Hahahaha this was great

Congrats on 99 firemaking!
---

---
but is there runecrafting?
---
He‚Äôs referring to mythical cape racks
---
Probably still won't get banned so whatever
---
I can never tell if these post are serious or memes. Cause they seem very plausible.
---
My account got banned a little over 2 weeks ago for "macroing" and I haven't played in months... Help??
---
Alright, I guess arrogance then?
---
I was literally rank 1 in OSRS before
---
I am currently the best geared HCIM (maybe tied with Xzn)
---
I came 4th in a DMM Tournament
---
So... clearly I'm pretty good at all aspects as the game, whereas you're just being a salty cunt.
---
How about that for "fake humbleness"

Also I wasn't being humble I was being snarky. :)!

My friend said he was better at League of Legends on acid. I think he's a liar.

The long pauses in between the insults killll me
---
I won like 2M in total of a bot had a big winning streak and pple started reporting me.. that I was a friend helping him scam or something
---
really awesome paintings mate keep em comming
---
Generally defense is thought of as a less advantageous stat. So by no training it you can focus on better stats while keeping your combat level in the range players that do training it
---
Why not? We work hard for those spades, all alone and in the dark.
---
Ignore that guy he's a pleebian
---
Don't be an asshole to people.
---
if you go for quest point cape you'll get most of your stats up to something decent just by getting the requirements. seriously go do some quests.
---
I think the problem is new-ish players might think they are even legit. They are pretty uniform and in every world. I could see someone being confused and believing they are an official Jagex function
---
Yeah cape racks are a slower but cheaper alternative
---
got mine at 2k kc 
---
best of luck man. 
---
tell us when u got it
---
i didn‚Äôt think the logic through. i‚Äôm a fucking idiot
---
Don't chug stams only.use when necessary
---
First of all, did you even read the blog? The framework is from 2001. While it might be easy to do with current systems, it probably isn't nearly as easy as upgrading something older than a decade (almost 2 decades old now).
---
Plus, they're upgrading EVERYTHING, not just case sensitive passwords. I expect that they'll roll out all the fixes in larger quantities once the system is upgraded, rather than trickling out smaller fixes while they're still upgrading it.
---
For someone claiming to have a software engineering major, you sure don't seem to know a lot. (Again, did you even fully read the blog you're griping about?)
---
I do it.. it's fun when ur bored.. just a little bit of gambling.. I think I'm in the + atm so.. I dont mind lol..
---
This has a whole other meaning in Scotland lmao
---
Hit 500 vorkath kc today and have 1 zulrah kc. I'm biased but do vorkath, way easier.
---
A pokemon game that played like runescape would actually be pretty fun.
---
I'm a very competant user of a computer, I change my passwords, I know not to go to stupid websites... Basically I keep my computer very secure. I do the same with my runescape account, I'm not in any CCs I'm only helpful and respectful to other players and I use all of the security measures jagex provides.
---
I have had my account hijacked and lost over 100m
---
Fact is, it happens, and it's not always the fault of the user
---
False positives will always happen. It's also common for people helping the bots to tout what they won, so that's normal and expected. I'm talking about the bot's "fill", as they don't get that initial startup cash from nowhere.
---
Said it before and I'll say it again. Obviously banning them isn't very effective because these bots take no effort to make. What Jagex needs to do is be more strict on the players who gamble with them. A lot less people would be using these bots with the possibility of a temp ban. Of course Jagex won't do this because these are paying customers and they want to keep it that way.
---
&gt; And that argument is lame, by that logic slayer has no place as a skill either
---
... Yeah. Slayer isn't that good of a skill. Your point?
---
I like dragon hunter lance more, seems more consistent than the crossbow and you are not using bolts.
---
How do I preprep a full inv of stams solo?
---
It doesn't hurt to poll stuff...
---
Just poll Gauntlet loot buff, if the community wants it, it gets 75%.
---
Just poll Blade of Saeldor buff, if the community wants it, it gets 75%.
---
There is no downside to poll these things, just fucking do it. I don't understand what is taking you guys so long.
---
I won like 5 times in a row had 2M and stopped.. guess the house doesnt win all the time huh?
---
That huge mobile player base can't do this :(
---
337 whoops
---
Good effort, but honestly the yellow Runescape font + black background looks horrendous.
---
Yeah. I want a rotm style quest already! The fortress is there now. Mod Ry added it
---
Yes! I was just thinking about this!
---
Fixing the broken houses, nourishing npcs, perhaps keeping the gate fully open.
---
This was everything I was thinking after completing SOTE and visiting west ardougne again.
---
Some other locations could use this as well, but thats an another topic.
---
I'd stop paying for the service alltogether if deemed unsafe. Again, you have no say in what the company does, but of course are free to raise your voice to address the issues! 
---
You might just want to try a more professional way, as posts like these tend to just push the devs further from telling anyone anything. "Fix your shit" is the single most efficient way of never getting any response from any dev, ever.
---
I guess that's what you get for asking an innocent question to people that don't have the ability to formulate words to explain things. ....

Anything for a zaros cape

What happens when you skip leg day

Meanwhile, you suggest tiny post-99 RNG scaling and people go "We can't have that, pets are supposed to be rare!"
---
Careful, that raccoon is going to steal your stuff
---
at least RS has a sense of consequence for violence (you can die and lose lots of GP/ in game progress). If anything this game teaches you the important lesson that violence comes with risk.
---
the game is not fun anymore since there's nothing new to do that doesn't require grinding
---
It‚Äôs called Ironman mode. Give it a try :) can‚Äôt lose the bank at sand casino.
---
I don't agree that any of those things are issues.

According to who? Me. Just like they *are* problems according to you. Welcome to the internet, both our opinions are essentially worthless.

Its important to know when something is report worthy vs using the ignore button. Macroing reports dont harm your odds I believe as its part of the anti cheat team. General cursing wont hurt it your odds depending on the context ofcourse. Maturity is one thing they check for. People who curse the whole GE down will likely have less chance.
---
When I was those stats I went dharok, karil, ahrim, verac, Torah, guthan so I‚Äôd have prayer guaranteed for dharok, karil, and ahrim. I just face tanked the last 3. I only ever needed the prayer pot if dharok or karil was in the crypts. I sometimes just face tanked karil in the crypts if I had enough food but he hits accurately enough to avoid.

Yes I believe they said early-mid August so hopefully this week!
---
Maybe the actual dialogue would be a bit tricky for actual-children, but I don't think runescape actually tackles any "mature themes" (well, other than The Giant Dwarf, which is weirdly largely about corporate politics and lobbying).

Why would the guy follow so deep in wild without food? wtf

While you think that being in rune makes you not worth it, that just makes you a nice juicy high alch target. In reality you should be practicing on quick escapes and making yourself less juicy (i.e. Black dhide set, using ctrl + shift + arrow keys to quick hop world's) and I mean if you're doing green drags there's a spot so far south in the wilderness that you can one click tp with a teletab as long as you don't let yourself get teleblocked.  The name of the game is vigilance :)

I mean, why?
---
underrated meme right here
---
No plz
---
Funnier IMO
---
I know magic attack doesn't matter much when bursting dust devils/nechs so prayer gear is better than mage robes. Is ancestral worthwhile for the damage boost or am I still better off in proselyte?
---
make the clue scroll drop a trimmed (g) version  maybe.
---
That's what everyone's been saying, but it feels like you've intentionally worded things vaguely just so you could show that you knew what everyone's already talking about

My bot
---
True. I run into stoners everywhere in rs.

But on a side note I'm poor and need runes to train can you give me 2m?

I totally have not been using it at the sand casino or dice bots.

Hopefully soon. I'm excited for smith X personally.

A bunch of cry babies upvoting this. First, I am a developer and my company codes to high standard. It takes a long time to undo bad decisions even in okayish codebase. Jagex codebase is massive, and they DO not hire good Deva because they pay shit wages. Hence do not expect quality people employed there.
---
Second, security takes a long time. You have no idea how massive this problem is in software engineering. Even with massive help from AWS which they obv use, the level of rework on the shit code they have is massive risk.
---
Overall, people who are not developers do not understand the trash we scoop every week. Coding is one of the hardest mental toils on the planet, shit is really hard, and I enjoy the thing. But I would not work k on jagex codebase, I treasure my life too much.
---
I repeat, the legacy code they deal with is a massive risk. Just the courage to deal with it is admirable. You should show pure gratitude instead of entitlement. 
---
Also, their current security is good. My company uses authenticator with password, no one gets hacked. Use a unique password, authenticator, 2 fa email and bank pin. Getting hacked is impossible in this way.
---
I was just giving a tip on how to improve the videos if he happens to read Reddit. Sharing why you dislike something isn't bad in any way.
---
No one is forcing you to play bitch.

You can also do actually decent activities between runs..

Immediately what I thought about
---
You can do natures through the abyss at your level for like 330k gp/hr rn, up to around 400k gp/hr at 50 when you unlock the large pouch
---
Experience rates are pretty poor though so you might just want to do ZMI and make less money in exchange for training RC more quickly. People usually stop doing ZMI at 77 when they're able to do bloods on Zeah
---
Hey man,

Things will turn around, you can't let your failures define you. If you didn't do was well as a musician as you wanted to you can always keep trying! Also you cant think about jobs that way as most jobs don't last, because you'll move on to do bigger and better things.

Agreed, Nex was very different from the 4 other bosses so I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôd go in a similar direction

---
What I'm actually proposing is to follow how raids were intended to play out, which they corrected with TOB. I'm not interested in content outside of raids 1 in this post, but I wouldn't be against a hard mode inferno with a trimmed cape. 
---
It's a problem that scouting exists and it should be done away with by replacing the main raid with a dangerous death linear progression. This would make it less easy to cheese through COX, people wouldn't go 500+ Raids without knowing how to do vespula and both theiving and vanguards wouldn't be insta-skips.

Teleport to Stronghold takes you literally directly in front of Nieve which is convenient for many players, as Nieve is the most popular slayer master between 85-100 combat and can still be used above 100. If you don't have one then you have to go to the Stronghold via spirit tree which can take 15 seconds with a spirit tree in your POH or upwards of 30 without one
---
Likewise the Slayer Tower TP is useful as it saves time over using a fairy ring to Canafis, and the Fremennik TP is one of the closest teleports to a fairy ring in the game

Snipping tool is a friend that you have in you so why do you neglect him? Are you being serious right now? He's always been there for you and will be. 
---
Did he hurt you or something? Babe, what's wrong? He's literally there. Just use him, you know you can, but you're not doing it. Why? Do you need to see a therapist? Do I have to reserve a time for you?
---
Are you living at your granny who only knows how to snap pictures with her Nokia brick? Babe, you deserve better. Just use the snipping tool. Not only will your marriage make you happy, but it'll make us others around you glad as well. Please, just remember the next time.

I mean you can‚Äôt really make much gold out of it. 1k accounts and all you‚Äôll make is 5m. If you‚Äôre so concerned about it getting taken advantage of a minimum total level of 60 can be added as a requirement to get the gold reward.
---
how many characters have we beheaded?  You just basically rip off Elvarg's head after killing him (her?).  Then the troll king in The Fremnink Isles.  
---
The underground pass with all of those things in cages...  creepy
---
in regicide we basically bomb and burn alive the "good guy" because we just follow instructions lol.
---
A bit of both our ideas would make a good mix, th pressure of scarab damage would be interesting! The rewards are tough! Mine weren't all that great. It's hard to find a balance of worth it and not super op.
---
Let me elaborate on my yes and no. As for your rewards. I dont want to see any of that armour back into this version. We should have something entirely new but it's either going to be bis or niche and worthless. I think nex armours and pvp weapons would definitely upset the power creep as it did the first time. So that is why I was so against the primary amount of your rewards.
---
That's terrifying.  
---
I will say, I do appreciate some of the benefits of living in a an apartment. One being commercial building fire protection systems.

Some time ago there was a suggestion to install some sort of 'well', where players could destroy their items( with its own hiscore of who donated the most  gold and such). Why didn't this pass, what could be done to combat the crashing economy?
---
Rs3 mtx is getting out of hand. 6 ice blitz‚Äôs in 1 box?
---
The main issue it has is that usually the trade off between ranged and melee is that melee could hit harder whilst ranged was more accurate. And all weapons in the game are generally on a curve where there‚Äôs a tradeoff between accuracy and dps. 
---
The blowpipe breaks this balance completely and needs a huge accuracy nerf so it fulfils it‚Äôs purpose as a high dps low accuracy weapon. A blowpipe with full arma is almost as accurate as a godsword.
---
Definitely orange and blue in the boots and braces, also that's not sellotape it's tipex (whiteout) used for the skin

That's against my guthixian edicts

Fuck leveling herb with just cleaning herbs though, Christ my wrist is sore thinking about it.
---
Bot anti detection is surprisingly advanced.
---
You can feed the bot human click and mouse movement data to imitate people. This is stuff like reaction time, chance to overshoot with cursor, click accuracy.
---
There are scripted events like checking xp periodically, or adjusting camera angle.
---
They even have a few quests pre-programmed and might vary their skills.

Then there are the Chinese gold farm bots. They just play a numbers game.

---
As much as it sucks, I'm fine with it existing and Jagex turning a blind eye to them rwt. Matter of fact, I hope they don't get banned. I hope Jagex finds some damn good gold sinks to increase how much real money they make per million. These people need to put food on the table for their family, and I have no problem with rules or laws being broken for that reason as long as it doesn't hurt a single individual in a drastic way. Lord knows I'd be down at the local Safeway stealing some food for my starving family if I needed to, and this is practically the same thing.
---
The issue is moreso botters than anyone else. If only rwting players existed who didn't bot, it would do damn near nothing to the economy compared to the fuckin botting problem.
---
It's not really a meme as much as a real daily thing that thousands of people do daily.

Use Expeditious Bracelets for bad tasks (low xp or tasks you don't like), Slaughter Bracelet for good tasks (high xp or tasks you do like), always pray piety no matter what, strength bonus is better but you can use prayer bonus like Proselyte to offset the cost.
---
Cannon every task you melee, ice burst/barrage every task you don't melee (usually Smoke Devils, Nechryaels, Dust Devils with Bracelet of Slaughter, also extend them). If you can't cannon or barrage the task, skip it unless it's something like Metal Dragons.
---
You should only have to bank at the end of your task following this method, or when your inventory is full of drops while burst/barraging.
---
You have been powned epic style.
---
I remember AutumnElegy mentioning they devalued his 1300 rune scimmy grind by releasing it as a drop from something. Can't remember what, just assumed it was that giant boss.
---
I'd like to see them release a GWD style raid with Nex as the final encounter. We coul face other generals (mor bigger and badder) from each faction too. So much potential and everyone already loves the godwars lore so the hype would be real
---
Probably on here, it remember a few posts peddling that number while also using it as an opportunity to shit on jagex
---
As long as you say no chromo first it‚Äôs fine

Nice, didn't know there was a real weapon that actually looked like the runescape scimitar, think I'll sub and watch ep 1 and 2 later. 
---
Ardougne is the most medieval-ish city I can think of, been there yet? And have you looked and talked about the boats/sailing in the game?
---
At least the burners were lit
---
You still sound like a turbo sperg.
---
Void is gear you get from pest control. Boosts base damage a chunky amount while being okay defense. Easy to make swaps between ranged/ mage/ melee by simply changing the helmet.
---
Elite void is an upgraded version
---
Running essence is basically having 75 runecrafting, filling your pouches, quickly running to someone who hired you for an hour and trading them the ess, then going to bank and repeat. You have to be fast/ be used AHK and runelite likely. Pays well, intense, too grating for some but it doesn't take too long to get into.
---
Such a good strategy, I don't know why pk'ers don't use this more often
---
Epic
---
Nothing in the game is straightforward. Ironically, you're being ignorant, yourself. You're like sub 1k total and you're trying to be elitist about how to play the game. In the strongest possible way metaphorically, get over yourself, please. This is embarrassing.

I asked a simple reason as well. I don't see how asking whether it was rs2 or rs3 is relevant.

Did you have a blowpipe on?  I remember something similar happening to me and I want to say it ignored the blowpipe for some reason (even though the stats showed over 182), so I switched to a crossbow and it worked.

Mining is decent money for f2p. If you want to get a bit of combat, you can also kill cows and tan their hides in alkarid. Stronghold of security (west of varock on barbarian village) has some okay drops too, and would be better combat training than cows at higher level.
