Ah true.

---
---
Very interested how do i even go about installing other plugins
---
I am not certain, but I believe I saw an answer to this in a prior thread:
---
Currently if you disable the authenticator it happens immediately which means that all someone has to do is log in once and disable the authenticator to then have full control over the account. Adding a delay would be helpful because it would been that the person would have to continue to bypass the authenticator until it is fully engaged, allowing the original owner time to protect their account.
---
It’s like OP is trying to communicate something!
---
Why'd this get deleted? 
---
Well they already have CarPlay which is a partnership between most car brands in apple. 
---

---
It just doesn’t work with all apps.
---
it's a nice way to get 99 slayer haha XD
---
Also, brodaki posted screenshots of the guy on "his" account chatting shit and saying he was going to drop his untradeables.
---
If you're some guy who just got their account back, why the fuck would you brag to the guy who stole/bought your account that you were going to drop their untradeables???? It doesnt make any sense whatsoever.
---
Jagex just wiping their hands and going "yup back with original owner now" really doesnt fill me with any confidence.
---
YES FUCK YOU REDDITBITCHES
---
My opinion: mobile is not intuitive, the controls are clunky, holding for right click is slow, movement is not responsive, buttons are too small, textbox is too big, the UI is inconsistent with different devices, ground items like seeds are impossible to see....
---
  
---
It's doable for ago things like cannonball but that's not fun. I don't think they should have released it in its current state because now these things wont be addressed.
---
Can say I fell for this when I was 8. 
---
I know they're never going to provide proof, but that doesn't mean you should automatically think they're infallible here.
---
It's like you people forget what company this is. Their most consistent trait is that they make mistakes. 
---
You just really can't critically think for yourself. You'll see a new highly up voted meme and take that as fact, because you're a lemming who can't think of an opinion for themselves.
---
That's basically my experience at 1,200 KC. We'll get 'em eventually. :')
---
i'm not sure what you mean, to my knowledge a death at cerberus means you need to go back to your death spot within an hour to get your unprotected tradeables back, vorkath is the one that has the safe chest
---
Technically, since Runelite and OSB has such a large marketshare of total clients; they can track what their players are voting and there is no way jagex can hide it. 
---
However Jagex could just tell them to not implement it, however I'd never imagine such a feature to get merged to runelite, I'd me more inclined to believe a hide poll results plugin to be implemented.
---
At the moment, someone can immediately remove the Authenticator once they recover your account.
---
Which basically means the Authenticator does nothing. A delay would mean someone would have to wait a week to get into an account if it’s compromised, and the person would be able to take actions to protect the account/lock it.
---
what is the blue stuff next to the pet?
---
Replied to the other guy with an explanation 
---
That's a fair point about maintenance cost. Especially now with amethyst arrows which are quite strong. The cost can be even lower for close to the same power as dragon arrows. I also mostly agree with what you said about only cerb and hydra mattering. Zulrah has BP but doing BP/Mage is far more expensive and less you have literal max gear minus tbow then it's actually faster to do that than tbow, but tbow has that low cost.  
---
I think it is to late to make any changes be it truly needed or not, but what I would like to see is it "moving up" on a tier list. People complain saying no 80 tier weapons/armor so they just add the same thing but give it lower requirements. Weapons such as tbow/scythe should require a higher level. At least to show they are "worlds" apart from other weaponry.
---
This is episode 1 of my one chunk at a time series. The goal of the series is to unlock the whole RuneScape map. Feedback is appreciated! Thanks to Pookaguy for having this idea and inspiring me to make this series.

Man you just draw random girls and loosely attribute them to Runescape characters 
---
And walk straight to the unemployment line!
---
Tbh i think jagex should just add tax to GE and then sell that to players, and undercutting gold sites. That would probably reduce some of the scummy things that happen thanks to black market sites.
---
The lengths to do what? Ruin their own account? Are we talking about the same people who can't be bothered to send prizes to winners of competitions they themselves held? Allowed Jed and RoT to roam free? Etc?
---
Ye failed was within last few months
---
Nice! 
---
Not compared to other weapons. It's only 5m right now. It does "degrade" in that ammo gets expensive though.

Use the house planning tool in the game. For low levels focus on power building (build, remove, repeat)

If you’ve got money to burn flatpacks might increase xp rates but are huge money sinks.

**PLAN AHEAD** (goes with the first tip) — this skill is very expensive!! The rooms cost $1K minimum. If you can, build your portal chamber(s) close to each other.

---
The biggest thing though is to have fun imo
---
What situations? Some raids 1 bosses, Sara GWD, Inferno are the only relevant ones and in all of these situations you STILL use a blowpipe. Whereas the blowpipe is OP in pretty much 80% of bossing and many non-boss NPCs. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
If you're willing to really put a lot of work into it recipe for disaster is an iconic quest that would be really cool if you put a spin on it. Or if you want something really easy do cooks assistant, which is basically the first quest anyone does

Ok but T-bow didnt break the game and meta.
---
Blowpipe did (and rigour in combination). 
---
Given its such an easily accessible and cheap weapon, yet incredibly powerful and more than worth the operating cost in the vast majority of cases makes it just game breaking. Plus its pretty much not only viable but the best DPS or very close in so many situations its just stupid, meanwhile the T-bow is only particularly OP against things with high magic defense. 
---
T-bow really isnt an issue, blowpipe is.

Or you could just 1t enchant bolts for 97 exp per cast for a maximum exp rate of 582k/h, costing approximately 2.7m/h (as of current market value + staff enchanting). Much lower requirements (87 mage no quest vs 90 something for heal and lunars)
---
I'd disagree there. How do you expect them to have an open discussion about a Poll Rework anymore than they have? They've discussed it dozens of times over the past year, going over feedback, their thoughts on what could change, and the issues they face. It is also pretty clearly what the community wants from a Poll Rework; if they asked it would just be a spam of hide poll results. So until they are ready to make a change, there is no update to be given and nothing to be said that won't feel like dodging the question. Same for support; they know what players want done, but until they are ready to make changes they can't give any resolution.
---
"crappy money-makers" you mean money makers that would be good for low levels but aren't that good because they get gold farmed. Also if cheap prayer exp is such a good thing I have to question where the line is, would it be a good thing if jagex spawned unlimited dragon bones for us so we got free prayer xp?
---
AMD CPU, that explains it all.
---
&gt; Sure, OSB users has been steadily declining, but it has not dropped 50%+ the last week to explain for the decrease in trade volume it displays.
---
It wouldn't have to. The smaller userbase simply means that the OSB figures are much more sensitive to fluctuations in user ge behavior.

Agility question, the wiki says that marks of grace drops are 80% less frequent when you're &gt;20 levels above a rooftop course's requirement. However, I've done 80-83 at Seers without noticing any drop-off. Is the wiki incorrect? The reference for that fact is a Mod Ash tweet from back in 2015.

No that’s the metamorphic dust. It can be obtained by completing CM raids under a certain time.

Yeah my point being he said nothing about a rule being broken so why do they need to be stopped I guess I am confused

If you've ever been to rev caves, you'd see a huge difference in the amount of pvmers inside from just a week ago. They are currently out of power a d there are about 1-3 pvmers per world in revs, sometimes its a ghost town. The venezuelians that do move out of venezuela and move to colombia, some of them have to work 16 hour shifts just to afford basic necessities. (From what I've been told from 2 different people). Its tough for them. I help out as much as I can and I hope I don't get banned for "rwt" because I usually give them 1-5m when I can. 
---
A lot of times, don't work
---
7k votes, no response, sad.

Gold Bars is by far the best xp/hr.

It's just mining iron ore at a 3 iron ore spot as AFAIK. Mining Guild close to the bank is nice for some gp.
---
Yes
---
If it's clear what the community wants, and they want poll results hidden, then how is it difficult to just do what is asked of the player base? They've even stated, they can hide results in game but not on the site, and 3rd party clients could potentially see the results anyway.
---
At that point, you exercise your power as a company and ban 3rd party plug ins that would reveal results, similar to how they've banned other plug ins before. Additionally, many have voiced that since the site is less used than in game, to just go ahead and hide them in game and leave the site alone. It's not like this requires finesse or some drastic measures. It's pretty simple to do, so just do it.
---
Support is a bigger issue, I understand, because it's got to do with human resources, the reallocating the budget, management, etc. But something as simple as hiding poll results has literally zero excuses for why it's not implemented as an integrity change.
---
Slayer is a bit click intensive though for AFK? What levels for good tasks?

They could give it slayer helm bonus, stacking with void, only vs dragons? Would make killing vorkath on task way better and help with the hydra itself

Context?

Hey retard, skilling barely takes any thinking. That's why most skilling methods like this are called AFK and brainless already. You do this stuff so you can play the game later with some actual thinking. 
---
This allows you to skip the boring stuff and get to the actual gameplay, or at least make the boring stuff somewhat less, well, boring?

Quarter of the video is this guy attempting to say Shayzien

There was no extensive smackdowns like some of the others, the replies were really short. The guy just wrote his whole life story and phrased things unnaturally. Feels like a shit post more than anything because he acts interested in recovering the account, but then the original owner could pull a loop, so it's worthless.
---
Though, ethically, I do think more stories need to end like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4qgdoy/a_sad_day_in_the_office/
---
Sure the account was sold, doesn't mean the seller theoretically deserves the rights to an account they, on record, did nothing to build to current status. If anything ethically it should be rolled back to the point they last had it. They don't even deserve the username technically as it's be cleaned due to inactivity. The stories are a bit sad considering people make such mistakes many years in the past.

So one could just buy flame-enchanted rune scimitars, abyssal whips and godswords from GE? If there’s no level requirement to wielding enchantments, like there’s none for poisons, then what’s the point? Sounds like fun but the suggested implementation would just make rushers in pvp hit that much harder, make killing passively little faster in pve and change everyone’s weapons into flaming weapons. I’m already hating the idea of having 150 identical flaming weapons in pvp areas and GE.

&gt;Venezuela’s not a first world country.
---
I mean that's sort of my point. The classical definition is that capitalist countries are first world, socialist countries are second world and developing countries are third world. 
---
&gt;It wasn’t when the socialists took power, either - Venezuela has always over-relied on oil production as its main export, not to mention the effects the ‘94 banking crisis had on its economy.
---
It would have become a successful economy by now had the socialists not took power and capitalism be allowed to flourish. The over reliance on oil isn't an excuse for the failure of socialism its caused by it. The oil wealth would of made Venezuela a great place for capitalists to start investing in (oil refinement, energy production ect.). Not to mention they have other natural resources, they could use they have huge lithium reserves which the modern world desperately needs, but no capitalist would ever in his right mind invest in a lithium mine in Venezuela because at any time it can just be nationalized by the Venezuelan state.  Venezuela has no excuse to not be a first world nation when Chile easily categorized as one, except for socialism.
---
&gt;Furthermore, the Maduro government is having to deal with the US-backed Juan Guaidó faction, whose people were recently found to have set fire to an aid shipment, attempting to make it look like the fire was orchestrated by Maduro, in order to turn the public against him. 
---
We don't know all the facts right now about who's at fault for what sources inside Venezuela are all heavily biased obviously. But that doesn't matter Maduro is at this point fighting off a revolutionary/civil war the fact that such a significant portion of the population is against the Maduro regime and had their lives impacted to the point that they are willing to fight mean that Maduro and his socialism is still at fault.  The US couldn't back a successful coup of say Sweden because there wouldn't be enough people to fund. 
---
&gt;Maduro has a lot to focus on at the moment
---
Maybe he prioritize focusing on the well-being of his people first and maintaining dictatorial rule second.

Ds2 requirements(necessary for ferocious gloves) are greater than RFD, really not much to complain about imo.
---
Well you felt insecure enough about it to reply to me, so what would you call it?
---
Most 1 defence pures will prefer the superior defence bonuses of d'hide. I don't suspect they'll take that lack of defence hit for a negligible +1 strength, but I could be wrong. Especially not in Pk, as they'll inevitably be worth 100's of times what d'hide costs.
---
Sorry I dumped my stack of 3million and crashed the market 
---
They're best in slot for melee. For range and hybriding barrows is still much better.
---
They're also locked behind DS2 which I'd argue is much harder to do than RFD
---
Oh my. I’m not sure you’ve heard of this but it’s called a joke...

For mining, if you want to do falador hard/elite diary ever you'll need full Prospector, which means you'll need to do a boatload of Motherlode Mine. That means it will be macro efficient to level with MLM even if the rates are slower than powermining iron.

Thank you for this concise reply. I've already stayed away from clicking suspect links via streams and social media but it's a good reminder. Unfortunately the database leaks will happen but it's a smart idea to use separate emails and passwords. Social engineering I think is the most interesting of the bunch you posted; it's hard to detect unless you're trained for it. What you may see as a harmless question can actually be an attempt at gathering information; I'm not saying we need to isolate ourselves but it's good practice to avoid those conversations. 
---
In regards to the poor customer support when an account compromised, how would Jagex go about separating the "wheat from the chaff" with claims? I think that's their biggest hurdle to overcome; not only from a logistics point but a system aspect too.

May I know what constitutes poll versus not to poll? I believe in using a neutral attitude, values driven decision making, checklist to decide what runs the poll. I do not believe in bias, self-serving decision that influence what goes to the poll, and how it’s deliberately worded.
---
As far as I know, this open-result live polling system has caused a snowball effect in a negative way since 2013. The rolling snowball doesn’t seem like anything until it’s big enough to cause a lasting impact. My opinion is, the osrs team has not done a great job in their internal working system. It has only done a good job only for people who values pleasure than the integrity of how this game is run.

why would I put 1.5b on an acc, 1 year of membership to bot. please just think about that lol.

They are. Tons of bot accounts are banned daily. It's too easy to make an account and get the requirements for most f2p money makers. Many bot accounts dont last more than a day or so.

My biggest piece of advise is to take breaks. I know it’s not “efficient” in terms of getting it over faster but in reality it will help. When I was doing my grind for construction I would take breaks every hour or so. I would go out outside and play with my dog for 10-15 minutes. It took me longer to do construction but overall i never had any hand pain or got tired of it. I would also do Atleast 1 hour a day.

I mean jeez, I understand being upset that your account got recovered and you are losing your items but to go this public about it has to be ridiculous. You are asking a jmod to look into the situation and OP should have known if he bought the accounts they would not side with him.

Are DKs worth doing on-task without the elite diaries done?  I see various sources saying they're ~2m an hour with the diary, but nobody seems to talk about what they are without it.  And I'm not sure why not because the diaries require 77 rc, and runecraft=bad.

I'll give you 9,999gp for it to complete the trifecta

Ah ok thank you for the source lad

I did and it is sold out unfortunately.  I numbered them 1-125 and will not be reproducing them.  If you check the facebook group "The Runescape Pin Grand Exchange" you may be able to find somebody to sell you one but it seems to be a pretty saught after pin from me.

I doubt it. While less direct, DT is a quest to unlock a teleport and I believe the others prevent you until you unlocked it.
---
I agree with what you're saying. I mean wandering the wilderness was the best part of old runescape to me. But by making revs such a hot spot, the rest of the wilderness is effectively dead due to pkers being incentivized to only go there. Outside of revs, wilderness bosses, green Dragons, and the chaos altar, the rest of the wilderness is pretty "safe" to walk through. I'm all for having pvm content in the wilderness because i think it fits well, and I enjoy pking there too, but still the wilderness meta now, for everyone, is to farm pvmers which will obviously create some anger.

This isn't 100% of people but it's clearly the majority and it's clearly jagex's intention, which is the problem.

Hey Sween, I appreciate that you took the time to at least let us know Jagex is listening. This is more progress than anyone downvoting is giving you credit for.

Basically the only difference between profit slayer and exp slayer is that you unblock black demons, extend them, and put that block on bloodveld. Then do demonics at zulrah and blue drags at vork. Between the two you should make over 500m doing 99 slayer. The other 5 blocks stay the same. Cerb slayer is technically very good if you're going for 200m all because the melee exp is so good, but in terms of profit he is worse than demonics/vork. He would be the next thing to add though if you wanted a 3rd money task. 
---
That could possibly be the worst attempt at a zulrah helper I’ve ever seen
---
oh boy its a rs3 streamer we all know hows this ends nothing will happen just trying to get more people to view a dead game smh

No, unfortunately there's no boosts allowed in MM2, or DS2 for that matter.

I just asked u a question bro. 
---
Just do zulrah then
---
Twisted bow is great for certain bosses with high mage due to its mechanic. Otherwise it has roughly the same stats as a dark bow.
---
so gear literally does not matter if you cant get the rotations fully memorized and where you need to be at certain phases, study the rotations, phases and where you need to be as if you were studying for a final and i guarantee you that zulrah will be a cake walk 
---
That is a lot of balls
---
LMFAO NVM I was selling them and collected the cash and didn't realise
---
Rip. Thanks.
---
Yeah for people with 40m banks.
---
its not terrible and a *lot* of people do profit slayer. its just a great way to make slayer take longer than runecrafting.

Some elect to spend the money on the boss since it isn't as profitable versus conventional late game Slayer bosses for the sake of skipping over the Orb Healing phase, so a full Arma/Pegasian switch with Dragon Darts in your Blowpipe to maximize your chances is preferred.

Luckily, just by playing the game, you create an opportunity for them to make money!  Yay we're helping

some say that reposting is the path to true power; I disagree.  the true path to ultimate power is through reposting with your own watermark.
---
I realize the experience is really slow but that isn't really relevant to me, I essentially don't care if or when I hit 99 slayer.  All I really want is to have a good moneymaking method that will allow me to fund bonds and alts, are there any options that are vastly superior to profit slayer for that without requiring hundreds of mil to get started?

Could we look into getting an update for brewing? It's a fairly flushed out process already but it's relatively untouched content right now due to brews themselves being practically useless when pots are objectively better and easier to make. An update adding new and different types of brewable drinks could add new and unique buffs to the game, give Calquats a use as kegs rather than just being used for supercompost, and it could also potentially help revive the Trouble Brewing minigame, another forgotten piece of content, by adding in unique rewards to help with the brewing process.

most dedicated money making methods are going to earn you more money than profit slayer over the long term, especially if you have a zero value on slayer xp. 
---
And yet out of every game I've ever played, even free ones, RS seems to be the one where this happens the most often.
---
Might be the recovery questions, they are quite personal. 
---
So tired of seeing this mindlessly false scenario portrayed. Unless you have had large amounts of personal data leaked that is specifically linked to your account details as well, databreaches will never supply more personal RS account info than what the true account owner possess.
---
Care to tell me what databreaches would possibly contain my old JAG questions? An old list of IP's that have changed hundreds of times since? account creation date? Account subscription dates or the multitude of payment methods?
---
I have a written log of these details and a journal of when I was in middle school of my first passwords I ever used on RS that were never used anywhere else and long forgotten unless I pull them out. 
---
Case and point, unless you have limited account history and your credentials NEVER changed, there is no data breach that will ever allow someone to successfully impersonate you for an account that contains information that shouldn't be found anywhere else other than in Jagex's files.
---
As Jagex has stated themselves, hijackings almost never occur that way anyways, and as J mods have stated as well, the majority of people don't use authenticator to begin with.

It takes a special kind of person to want to collect chaos runes to get 10k. I really am not sure if you average app store user can really be expected to be like that. There is a big influence also from the fact that many of us started play the game when we were quite young (many *cough* before they were 13) and now are in your 20s. It has become a part of our lives in that way. New players coming in, seeing a game with outdated graphics and even more outdated game design can easily be turned off and go elsewhere with so many options out there now for quality MMOs. Not saying all of them will, but it is very understandable why someone would stop playing. This is coming from a guy that has basically consistently played this game for nearly 15 years.

There are some upgrades I could get. Some reasonably priced, some limited to a small percentage of the playerbase. But guides I see doing barrows quickly are always wasting lots of gp by maging Karil, using the lower gp/hr Swamp Trident, and not using the optimal dds specs against Ahrim. Blowpipe is sadly inefficient here. You can calculate all of this yourself based on the dps calculator and time saved and money earned. I've done this already and would prefer any future guides actually do their optimization research first. Faster does not always equal higher gp/hr. And you can be efficient for your stats / budget. But yes, I should upgrade to a fury/torture as soon as I can afford it, as well as bandos.

Kill time seems about right for your stats if it's regular void as well.

I looked up what to do and now I see there’s literally nothing you can do. Anyone got tips on how to prevent this again?
---
*brooklyn accent* it’s da baby dragon! Cmon Yug lets use time warp!
---
I feel bad for saying that I got herbi on the same day I got the hunter requirement. Was under 200kc (~140) and got it. Never went back. Congrats though!
---
they were considering making slayer f2p. i think thats a dope idea.
---
Q
---
Wasn't even a contest.
---
I go around 25-29 clues an hour if I try pretty hard. And profit is 2.5m+ if loot is decent
---
he's not wrong at all though..

get mith gloves grats your done

your prolly too poor to be targeted lol

Well i'm keeping my tbow and I let my friend borrow my half of the other one. So I still have no cash until he pays me my 600m. Anyways, after the solo tbow I had everything I wanted in the game. I only did more raids to fuck around and test the tbow in some group raids for a change, because I already won solo raids. Then i got another tbow.
---
gl on your raids. I went 50 dry at the start of my raids, and then that 80 solo raids dry streak was rough too. But sometimes you can make bank :D

F2p pking is the only true nostalgia I've gotten, obviously no bots, 99% original weapons/armour, everyone's trash talking and dressed like a scrub 
---
No real reason to be f2p these days unless you actively want to be f2p tho
---
There are f2p money making methods with no reqs that can get you a bond pretty comfortably 
---
Dude! I got rocky at 55 thieving if I'm not mistaken. Was at master farmer, which I think its about 1/250000 chance?
---
Economists hate him! /u/Kattekop_BE singlehandly found the solution to world poverty! I nominated you for a novel prize. 
---
He can never train thieving again. 
---
got a prim today at 32 kc :D
---
I don't enjoy it but I can do it during work breaks. Money wasted otherwise. 
---
Recently started osrs so I checked out twitch and saw some high viewers streamers quitting.  Being concerned about getting into a game that people might be leaving I clicked the link. Thankfully it was some forbidden message and I couldn’t go to the site.  
---
Wasn’t until like 2 days later I found out they were fake streams and those were bad links. New people don’t know those streams are phishing, and wards off new people potentially. 
---
they'd have to make changes to parts of f2p in its state to make slayer work. and the amount of work would be minor.
---
they can make the lumbridge swamp cave a f2p area and they can adjust vannaka to give more tasks oriented towards the available monsters (notable areas being stronghold of security, corsair cove and of course the lumbridge swamp). a beginner slayer master could be introduced to lumbridge swamp area and give tasks such as rats, men, goblins and frogs.
---
of course, this does give f2p a small handful of monsters to work with for slayer. and since its such a small handful, reworking drop tables to give free players a taste of the excitement of getting a good drop during a task should be no large feat either.
---
I think your name is Assistant
---
TBH, chilling on the porch playing RS and listening to birdsong has to be something close to the perfect calm
---
It isn’t 1 click destroy
---
1 def for a deep wildy pure? Unless you’re going with a clan you’re acc is doomed to fail 
---
U righ
---
I've tried using rsbuddy's calc before and it always seems to give me wildly incorrect numbers. Thank you though.
---
It's like you've forgotten Konar is a thing.
---
I can hear this comment.
---
What does “using two bonds” mean? 
---
I've been trying to learn some bosses. But I have no one to go with. If you're down I'm down! 110 combat.
---
Active poll results still not hidden smh
---
Can something be done about limpwurt roots from farming? They've been removed from the drop tables to decrease availability, but farming just isn't enough to keep the amount high. Can there be some upgrade like a super limpwurt root seed or something to account for this?
---
Abyssal whip is a body part
---
Rood
---
Probably a question that has been asked a 1000 times, but here goes anyway.
---
I've played rs a very long time ago (I suppose 15-16 years back), now and then I came back to pick it up or start over. Always in f2p. I finally felt like giving back to a game I wasted about half my childhood on and bought some bonds.
---
But where do I start in p2p? I don't have too much time to play (mainly when pooping or a few hours on a lazy weekend). Are there a some must do things in the big members world that can be recommended?
---
For one, when an acc is sold they provide enough info to recover it, they dont provide enough info to have the strongest possible recovery. Eg the original owner still has the absolute first password, the buyer might have an early pass or two but not the first.
---
Also obvious xfer of email , change of pass, pin paired with geographical moves is a giveaway.
---
F2P  pvp is okay, other thn tht its bs
---
RemindMe! 2 days "would you look at that"
---
Jmods are only looking into to the bans/issues because of the huge community outcry. Thousands and thousands of upvotes, multiple golds/silvers/plats to a guy who's lying (brodaki in this case). If community didn't give so much attention to these guys (which they don't deserve), this wouldn't be a such big issue. Even if Jagex made their CM the best possible CM in the world, people would still post on reddit and community would still keep upvoting just because of the memes and "smackdowns".  
---
In the brodaki case, Jmod who replied to his thread was Weath, who works as anti-cheating specialist. Not really the wrong guy volunteering to do the work.
---
What?
---
Ah I remember in the years between 2004-2007 when a good amount of players were &lt;15, you would both threaten to get your mains and follow thru with it and both bring your level 60cb accounts lol
---
Ah yeah, taking the kids shit and abusing him. Glorious times indeed. 
---
I know this reddits for memes but no one is going to look at this and think you're cool. 
---
I get a reminder of this post in 2 days. Because i want to know the answer too
---
There are that runescape guy phsing streams
---
RIP A Friend. Got 5 years in jail, but could have gotten full 12 years in Netherlands for sexual abuse. It was fun, see ya in 5 years when we're all grown up. :'(
---
Oooh I thought you were making some sarcastic joke..
---
__RemindMe! 2 days "would you look at that"__
---
no its fine how it is
---
Thanks, I love it!
---
Venezuelan here! Nowadays I do not play anymore, I got tired of the bans. Seeing this post I think that if the electric problem in Venezuela persisted and the Venezuelans did not play anymore, RuneScape would be a dead game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
B2P unlocked yet? 
---
the commies are downvoting you
---
Really? I had no idea. I just figured it was more of an OSRS thing because I see so many posts on here about it
---
Invest in farming and you can do ranarr runs. If you use ultracompost you'll make a profit guaranteed, it's solid passive money. Green dragons maybe for combat.
---
abyssal flip
---
I joke in my initial comment but tbh I'm totally fine with pray flicking. In todays Runescape, everyone is looking for the easiest and fastest "AFK" methods. Even doing combat, slayer, etc is a great afk method. 
---
If people want to do harder monsters earlier, or complete bosses and fight caves/inferno but doing 100% skillful, attentive inputs, than I'm absolutely fine with it.
---
I'm an AFK player myself, I've given pray flicking a shot to get tasks done a bit quicker, and it sucks. So hats off to you if you wanna spam click to make your tasks 15 minutes less, or not use pots, or do the Inferno.
---
Cheers
---
Lazy flicking isnt exploiting tick mechanics
---
Also in max gear you can for sure do it without flicking. Watch inferno speed runs, its like 4-5 range pots, 1-3 brews, rest restores. Hard camps rigour. A casual could easily do 1 range 1 stam 4 brews a fally shield and 16 restores, just using overheads, sgs spec off cd and do it.
---
Only if you have to get 200 million after talking to Oziach
---
RKO! RKO! RKO!
---
Playing osrs isn't a profession and it shouldn't be treated as one by anyone other than entertainers on twitch. People are breaking the rules and that's the hard truth. Downvote me if you want but that's just how it is.
---
huh i guess some have a harder times than others. im pretty use to cerb i did like 2k kills so its just engraved in my brain
---
You forgot to mention you aren't being hacked because your account is trash.  
---
Cuz reddit is all about karma. I think I will commit suicide for those downvotes for sure though. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
---
Makes no difference to me, if I'm being glorified or not. Shit was fun as hell.
---
nice name, gf account
---
They have the data they can check.
---
For example Jagex locks your account when they detect a significant change in location. If you have an authenticator enabled and successfully login with the provided code they won't lock it, because you've already proven your identity through two factors of authentication.
---
They're also able to check when your password and registered email where changed. There are probably loads of other things they can check. Think about your playstyle for example, if it drastically changes  the first time you login from a new location then Jagex knows something strange is going on. (Like suddenly using F-keys and 1-shotting Inferno)
---
I saw this yestersay, why notify me about something i’ve seen already? Wtf reddit, fix ur shit
---
Its sad that this is 95% and not 100%.
---
With a shoulder bag
---
?????
---
I was wondering about something! If you had  the quest, achievement, and music skill capes, does the max cape get their bonuses as well? 
---
I'm still 3000+ hours away from actually getting all 4, but still wanted to know. 
---
Those hands are actually chicken wings.
---
99.99999%
---
The fact that I speak for the majority is proven by the literal existence of this thread
---
Some people enjoying it doesn't make up for the hundreds of people whose fun it ruins. PVP in Wildy has literally no function except griefing. PVP worlds let clans do whatever they want without griefing. Until that happens I and the majority of RS player will always vote against anything that remotely helps PVP players in the hopes that they stop playing.
---
Damn
---
Do bone voyage and integrate birdhouses into your routine for a while, the passive hunter exp is extremely good and low levels and cuts out a huge bore
---
You can do really anything for example you can collect mort myre fungus it requires just few quests and you can do it pretty fast
---
It’s 2.5m/h profit if you get the drop rate after buying the implings. So it’s definitely a competitive way of earning money. Just high requirements (elite diaries) and high magic.
---
What are your combat stats? 
---
How?
---
I have to make it past the rest of the 63 waves first, jad will be ez lol
---
Go on, where’s a photo of you? 
---
my main of 15 years was perma banned for a while, i was actually able to get it back because not long ago jamflex did some kind of event where they were letting people appeal for their perma bans, when usually the option wasn't open. anyways they decided that since there was suspicious activity on my main at the time when it got banned, that it had indeed been hijacked and they unbanned it for me.
---
That’s epic! 
---
i just found out it isnt
---
You're not anglesscapes....
---
cool, what else has it affected in the market?
---
Sure
---
Karamja elite gives noted bars from steel dragons in brimhaven dungeon. Although sacrificing the rest of your inv for smithing cballs is very extra
---
I hope you get hacked thru a database leak eventually. It's easy to say people are entitled and have no shame when you. Any relate.
---
If you’re on a 10th task, do it with her. She gives the most points of every slayer master, besides the wildy slayer master.  
---
Best would still be Nieve/Steve for you. 
---
A big goal you can work towards is completing Recipe for disaster: a 10 part quest series that requires 175 quest points to ultimately finish. If you do a few quests a week you'll have it done before you know it. 
---
As a starting point I would suggest initially doing waterfall quest, tree gnome village and the grand tree.
---
How did you get that interface?
---
 &gt;Blowpipe is sadly inefficient here. You can calculate all of this yourself based on the dps calculator and time saved and money earned. I've done this already and would prefer any future guides actually do their optimization research first.
---
Care to share your calculations then? 
---
Yup. In these cases the community turns so quickly and calls anything that Jagex says without any evidence as a “smack down”. It’s kind of pathetic, really.
---
Nice trading sticks you got in your bank.
---
The context is a communist saying that bread lines are good, even though they are almost exclusively a consequence of communism.
---
Also, please check they are not taken first!
---
Just bang out 99 fm and only use a 100 of the crates and wait to use the rest is the most efficient way of doing it I think 
---
Cringe? Fuck no. Cool as hell.
---
Hit the gym bro
---
Grab em by the sulphur vent 
---
Both are piss easy, fight caves are just boring.
---
you can only ctrl to run while run is turned off, but you cant ctrl to walk while run is turned on
---
Ok but.. y fletch?
---
Is there a level for herb/wc/fish ect... that its a good idea to opening them at? 
---
The thing that is that most guides overemphasize DPS because they're trying to get you to the point you can do efficiently, rather than getting it down the first time.

JosephsPlace [5 Tips for your First Zulrah Kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwohmDWSlM) guide really helped me with this list of things to do in between phases, in order of how important they are to survivability:
---
1) Switch Protection Prayers
---
2) Get to the Correct Position
---
3) Swap weapon
---
4) Eat
---
5) Swap gear
---
6) Kill snakelings (if your recoil dies or there are too many)
---
I got my first Zulrah kill on the 3rd attempt with 78 Mage and 82 Range, using Mystic Robes as my mage gear. I had a couple rounds where I was maging in range gear and vice versa. It took me about 4 minutes to kill, but I killed it and still had food left over. Sure, I need to get a lot better to get minute-minute 30 kills to make Zulrah good money, but I now know how to kill it, if somewhat slowly, safely.

Mod Steve W sent this my way - send an email to [oldschoolcommunity@jagex.com](mailto:oldschoolcommunity@jagex.com), I'm pretty sure that the inbox message sent to prizewinners instructed you to do this. We certainly can give the membership to any account of your choice. 
---
This a runescape thread how many people here ya think are hitting the gym 😭
---
Guys like you already ruined the game by suggesting to just ”make everything easier” attitude. Yes rc grind up until 77 is pain one way or another, but name any other skill that achieving level 77 makes you a lot prouder then some of the 99's. Runecrafting is more like optional skill, apart from diaries tasks, you can progress without training runecrafting at all, the people who are dedicated enough and want that juicy gp/hr rates chooses to train it for 22-25k/h rates and everything is ok with that. My biggest fear is that one day, we could get a poll with questions about adding RuneSpan to osrs, and im 90% positive it would pass.. I heard theyre considering altar teletabs, just like it was in GOP, hopefully they will reject this idea, cause it will make rc too easy too easy
---
I notice a lot of people turn that autistic grind to the gym and get gains
---
Not true, you switch to Melee void to get your specs in
---
Hide your poll results man
---
Have jagex ip ban you/IP block jagex/RuneScape on your end. The next steps are extremely important. Get a therapist and find the source of your problem. As with any other addiction, you'll be left with a massive hole in yourself. it's on you to find a new hobby.
---
I'd say recognising you have a problem is the first step of problem-solving so you've started your recovery but you have a long road ahead of you. Good luck.
---
Hey it’s me your friend
---
Check your GE history, see if there’s anything in there you didn’t do. 
---
You are the freak in here.
---
Bro I hit the gym 6 days a week. Changed my life. I cannot recommend it enough. If you have any questions or need any advice, don't hesitate to pm me.

Canadians too

imagine if pkers had the stone cold entrance, you're just chilling at green dragons and then all of sudden you hear that glass break and you start to tremble in PTSD

Odyssey is objectively better than 64. 64 was one of the best games of all time when it was released but it feels dated today. If it was released today it wouldn't even be a question of which game is better. Camera is and always has been a sore spot with it.
---
Is Farm Guild protected? I thought I had read somewhere it was but I can't find any info about it now.
---
It's not like it's a hard skill to train, but it takes very long and is very click intensive. You don't have to be super smart or have sick mechanics to train rc. I'm not suggesting to make the skill easier, just to have a different training method (every other skill has multiple ways to train it except runecrafting for some reason).
---
Besides, all of us don't have as much time as we used to back when we played this game as kids, and that is all that runecrafting requires. If difficulty for you implies managing your daily life to fit in a couple hours of runecrafting training; that's very difficult for a lot of people. I don't see anything wrong with making outdated skills such as rc a tad faster to train or adding afk options. Understand that people just don't have time to grind out the 77 runecrafting at 25k xp per hour.
---
I'm a noob and got my first one and I had to finish Fairy tale 2 so I had to go from Herblore lvl 19 to 53 and farming from like level 17 to 46.
---
I was thinking exact thing! He shoulda dipped when he saw dem robes tho!
---
it's mad to think woox was like 12 when he did this
---
Unless you're using a barrage spell it would cost 0gp in souls to chin.
---
I feel like i'm doing something wrong with slayer. Each task takes more than an hour and i'm only getting around 10k xp/h. Slayer is 63 and combat stats are low 70s and 75 ranged.
---
Yup. 
---
then they write a long rant on reddit how the wildy should be safe 
---
4.4k kc no pet
---
So this is where it went lol
---
I bought it when it came out for 4.2m, eh. Now it's 2-3 times lower than that, but if you are doing just herb+hops without any new special locations from quests, it is still 8-9 patches where you need to long tap the leprechaun, get the compost dump it, then do it again and etc. Bottomless spared me from several stages of cancer, especially with doing allotment. I rarely bank, but do farming contracts and the search button for items is right near the «bank inventory». I am not sure why it can't be hidden as «bank worn items», but really sucks with the phonecase on, it messes my tap accuracy, so, once a while I do bank all and then go «Oooooooh, shit» for a minute 
---
Knowing how people are about their inventory spaces I think this is fine
---
It's not the only thing in the way, it's the last security measure for when they've already gotten into the account. And yet majority of these people don't have bank pins. It's could easily be the difference between losing a couple 10s of mils (depending on what you were last doing) to losing a couple hundred mil, yet no many feel that the inconvenience is worth losing their entire bank over if they have poor internet security.
---
You realize even basic single word names go for a few mill right? 
---
rakattak
---
Yh if I ever want to fully train farming in the future I will prob get a bottomless bucket but for now I just wanted to get to 46, which will actually be done at 10pm today when my curry trees finish.
---
Yeah I think it’s bullshit they’re pandering game mechanics to big abusers 
---
Farming with the low level allotment crops but no herbs/ limited trees would be nice
---
Can we have account security addressed? All the possible measures do not seem to be enough based on the amount of hacks happening.
---
You should be ok. Don't share your account information and that's about it - also having all the possible security measures to protect your account will help a lot more as well. Not sure if RS3 security is directly the same as OSRS but I can only assume they are the same and my 10+ year old runescape accounts (yes, multiple accounts) have not been touched by a single hacker ever. I was able to log into them with the same progress I had when I last played 6 or so years ago and the only real security they have are bank pins. The password and bank pin has been the same for years as well. Point is that not sharing your account details to suspicious links, unreliable third party game clients, etc is one of the safest and easiest security measures you can take to prevent loss of an account through hacking (but even if the reliable third party game clients are entirely safe, I'd stay away from them for even more extra security - though I am more on the uneducated side about their real security and if it is really safe but anything not legitimately from jagex is always a potential risk, small or big.
---
Just waiting till RuneLite drops an inferno plug in to tell you what prayers when and then I’ll do inferno 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
There isnt much activities in osrs that can be labelled as ”hard” and all of them are PvM based. Everything in osrs is time consuming and the one who can put in  more hours/use more click intensive  methods will have advantage over those who cant and thats they way it should be. If you cant find gime for rc, go do lavas/pay for zmi runners, if you dont want doing that, maybe think about switching to other skills? And what about those who got it before? it wont be right in theyre eyes for sure. They had to grind it with low xp rates and click intensive ways and you want to devalue them because the skills seem too slow for you? Back in the day rc cape was the rarest, everyone who had it, wore it with pride, and those  who havent had lt, felt respect towards those who have had. And lastly, adding Blood/Soul altars, already made rc A LOT easier, anyone can get it nowadays and with your suggestion, 99rc would be more common then the 99wc, because with rc, at least you can earn a lot.
---
Thx runelite
---
i haven't got mine yet but i did only start rs again like 2 weeks ago, just need time to rebuild my stats
---
Other way around, you take a category for a dollar value
---
Okay. (งツ)ว
---
*Surprised Kourendchu*
---
Shouldn't they be in a straight line? 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Unfortunately it does, it's the only member skill that has direct impact on the f2p experience (gives you an advantage in deep wild f2p pking over f2p players for example)
---
Which is better these days? OSBuddy or Runelite? 
---
no its fine
---
Do i only need to do Natures spirit? Or the whole Mortania Diarys? doenst that need skills high and take alot of time?
---
Gotta love how the guy isn't even watching the series he's just happy enough for a blank picture with the words 'meet swampletics' on it.
---
While I wouldn't mind the fishing cape getting a buff (chance to catch double fish sounds best to me), I should point out that teleporting to otto's grotto is quite useful for doing clue scrolls, since there are a few steps that require you to talk to otto.
---
Dude I'd pay for some osrs wrestling commissions. 
---
Downvotes? You’re not wrong with the argument
---
I didn’t actually read the article. I should have. 
---
Not that I care so much about A friend drama. But did he really get that hobgoblin preggo? 
---
DS2 is easier imo.
---
For Deadman do you have to start a new account there and you can only play there?
---
Right on broseph, sick of these wetback goldfarmers.
---
This happened to me. It’s what happens when your bank refunds you for jägex stuff.
---
I had like 6 months worth of mems and I charged it back and the Jagex were like “hold the fuck up son” and they said “you better pay us back every penny and then some or you will NEVER get your account back” 
---
So I did what any other normal person would and created a new account. But, I recently couldn’t resist playing my old account (main) so I just paid the tab and I’m back baby 
---
Muscle memory at this point to be honest. The only hard one is the rope. 
---
Whilst the viewer count is extremely tiny compared to the osrs version, it also means that the top few streamers dominate that viewer count- there are only about 5 that will ever be floating around the first row, meaning the viewbotted phishing streams are a huge problem for the small minority of rs3 viewers
---
And that assumes everybody has such high construction level + a pool available... Right.
---
Or inflamed tendons like I’ve gotten.
---
Yes he did, however the hobgoblin is going to refuse a friend from seeing the kid as, the state that he is it the mother has the last “say”
---
&gt;I don't think there's a way to get noted steel bars.
---
Gargoyles my friend
---
If ironmen can max without selling items from bosses, I don't see why regular players who can sell off skilling items (rc, hunter) wouldn't be.
---
I'm maxed, don't do bosses and have yet to do a raid. I got 23M herblore xp without ever buying a herb. Oldschool rs has been around long enough to be a casual player/skiller who is (beyond) maxed.
---
Can the shades in the last level of the Stronghold of Security be given nornal experience rates? Currently they give barely any experience, which is terrible for slayer. The Tree Spirits in the Enchanted Valley have the same issue, but at least they have decent drops. 
---
I’d rather let them die cause muh spades 
---
With the volcanic ash update it’s easier to mine so I would use it on bins and start storing up the ultra. 
---
Nice post, I rate it 5/7.
---
Don’t quote me on this but I believe people Blitz because of the ability to stack damage. 
---
But for a major power creep item? It should be 1b imo on par with the Bow.
---
Oh, word.
---
So edgy LOOOOOOOOOOL.... 
---
That was basically the only reason it was ever holding its high value honestly though. I mean its still bis for slayer and non degradable but yeah.. Plus more and more coming into the game with none leaving.
---
also for those worried about eoc: you can copy a basic ability bar (99% of people do anyway) and just turn on revolution, which uses the abilities for you, so really you just need to click and wait, like on osrs
---
hunter2
---
What sort of Zamorak-sucking heathen is voting RS3 over OSRS?!?!
---
Well you have to look at the cost of production not only the ge price. And making wine is quite expensive for the amount it heals. 
---
It uses your current rs account with its name, but yes, you starts from the beginning. It doesn't have that many players nowadays, so, I guess, you can waste a week or less to do, uhh, wintertodt and something else to get two 99s. But is is a super safe way in case you don't need to change servers to keep untrimmed. If that helps you save a cape for more Runescape days to come, why not 
---
Good thing, I have no intention of playing the trial version of the game.
---
That sounds interesting, might look into it a lil more not for the capes or what not just as a mode. Thanks!
---
Imagine being so fragile you think telling someone to grow up is "acting tough."
---
How do you avoid getting blasted as soon as you walk in?
---
What? How are other stats fast to 75?
---
I'm struggling getting 60 WC...
---
Time to add a new degradeable involving the rapier l0l
---
Slayer helmet with abyssal whip against that berserker helm and torso with rune legs (prob a STR pure) lol
---
Deal with that indoctrinated rs3 fool
---
How is 11$ their fault?
---
Damn. Remember when you could only hit an 80 once every 7 ticks from 1 tile away with full dharoks at 1hp? Power creep remembers
---
I think it would be cool for "tank" mechanics in group content but it is hard to fit it in without it being lame. 
---
I've just started to grind out vorkath, is it worth selling bank for the DHCB? Currently just using void, salve, blowpipe. I wouldn't have enough to get a dfs or ward if I get the DHCB. Just wondering what would net me faster gp per hour overall?
---
Ye lol if I gave this guy my bank he probably would've just thrown it at the sand casino. He was definitely not the same as the guy you're describing.
---
/r/oddlysatisfying
---
I would use it just cause I can't tell the difference between East and west :D
---
lance is by far #1, torture next, gloves and justiciar are both small, gloves tiny bit more kills and justiciar just makes it easier
---
lance is better than all the rest combined twice though
---
Yeah easy for us. For a noob that's never pk'd and doesn't even know what a spec weapon is, yeah not happening.
---
Come on it’s not like that entrance is the player bases’ security concerns 
---
Less switches, it's actually worse then traditional zulrah setups (ahrim/dhide) until very high range, but it allows you to have more inventory space and focus more on prayer.
---
That's always been the case though, hes asking why its dropping so hard right now
---
Looks like Mr Mammals account he has in his intro
---
So if I need about 600,000 xp to go until 70, and it costs me about 500k an hour, I'm looking at....6-6.5M? 
---
Need to organize a fabulous present for this fabulous screen shot. If 999 of us all give in 1m gp he'll get 999m and become lucky.
---
I'd say more like bow and a book
---
Fire cape
---
If that's what the math says, then yeah. 
---
Almost base 70's with 99 con and rc grtting lots of diaries done now. Still no fire cape
---
I think I honestly enjoyed rsc more, i remember the day rs2 came out and how sad i was
---
Have fun with the debt
---
If you're not using a cannon a lot of tasks are gonna be pretty slow.
---
I had a sonic the hedgehog kid
---
lmfao
---
I said this in another post and i’ll say it again. Don’t do slayer for consistent money until higher levels. Just suck it up and do herb runs. Farming is OP and you don’t need gargoyles or nechs to make it happens. I love slayer, don’t get me wrong. But if i had been doing herb runs all along i woulda made bank long before i got some zenyte shards and turmoil cores and whatnot
---
DESTROYED
---
Lmao!
---
The events are independent of each other
---
So whilst you would expect this happening 1 time out of 60,000 the probability of it occurring on the 60,000th time is the same as all the times before
---
What nerf
---
Can i have my hired and fired back please? &gt;.&lt;
---
D boots? 
---
So what you want is no PvP in the game at all because "smurfing" an account is unfair. Sure man, want what you want. But that's a pretty unaccomodating opinion. You want to eradicate a part of the game that's existed from the beginning. You want to have a wilderness thats somehow risky with NPC's? In a game where you're immune to damage with a level 43 prayer, I have a hard time seeing how that would work. 
---
Anyway you can fantasize all you want. I disagree with everything you said though 
---
Wow!
---
That's one l o n g hellhound.

You've been hacked. Hackers bought bonds on your account and charged the money back.

I’d say about 95% of my ignore list is gambling bots or the YouTube scammers. 
---
That's actually looks kinda like Woox, nice
---
Yeah because it's the osrs sub lol. It's like saying xyz game doesn't have phishing streams because they don't post on another game's subreddit lol. 
---
Just do what my roommate does and have 10 f2p flipping accounts. Uses the profits to buy bonds. Then you pay nothing
---
Almost the same speed. Bp is also better at more than 99% of the monsters in old school, including most of the ones with high mage levels like maiden and xarpus.
---
OK, well that makes it pretty safe.
---
For 5k tries, which the average would be for a brute force method, it would take 210 hours. 
---
You're talking past him. BP's cost neutralizes the extra profit from more kills pr/h, depending on zulrah scale prices. You are correct in that BP is effectively better because most mobs have drop tables with unique items in them, making the faster kills pr/h better because on average your kills are more profitable when we count unique drops. 
---
I got my black mask on my ult on kill 4 (and then lost it during a questfight the day after)

Can I get a source on that?

There will never be a x2 xp weekend on this game. How do people not get that yet?
---
bruh where is the setting in runelite to get my screen setup like that, instead of the weird default fullscreen
---
Twisted bow at 6secs.
---
Yep, I’ve been getting my total level up so much since mobile came out 
---
Limited to task though
---
I'm always amazed at how big and realistic the rs economy is. The way certain item price changes or new updates change the demand of other items for example. 
---
Probably because DMM was supposed to make them tons of money (like other mlg tourneys) but noone wants to play and not get paid, get cheated the whole time, or hacked.
---
That's cool though
---
they can't really... forget about moving, we're in the age of vpns now, this wasn't a problem 15 years ago but for jagex to say for certain that someone is who they say they are based on location is a hilariously outdated methodology.
---
Take out the trolls.

I splash om mobile while at work afk for days

Can this be our twitch icon?

He’s wearing adamant, doing thieving at ardy will get him killed
---
You are probably talking about a minority. One cannot create a desirable marketable account in a month unless they no life it, and even then they would require experience which most vzs won't have. They'd have to invest 7m on bonds per account + gear + supplies so that requires capital which once again most won't be able to afford.
---
I've spoken to one and the best way to put it is there are some who live like kings. While the ones that are very poor and need to sell what they get daily to put food on their table, there are others who take advantage of them by buying at a significantly lower rate than most places and then those few individuals just resells it. I'm guessing this has to do with most of them not even able to speak English.
---
Huge fan 
---
You must gwt daily offers for that name
---
Serious question about customer service: Can something be done to return Reddit/Twitter to it's normal state? The fact that people have to tweet Ash or post about their account on Reddit is tragic. 
---
Scamming is though? If you hand me money to protect you and then kill you that is a scam. 
---
Yeah, my drivers are up to date. Windows 10 makes it difficult cos they love overwriting stuff like nvidia drivers with their default garbage but it's immediatly noticable because most games start malfunctioning. Java is 64bit, latest release.
---
It does both actually. Sometimes it freezes (sounds keep going, but the game view is completely frozen. Side bar still works, and turning the plugin off fixes this), sometimes it just completely crashes. No error message, the client just closes.
---
My acc now yoink 
---
As someone who has done a lot of NMZ, I thought it was legit
---
I think my account may have been the victim of some sort of data breach, I didn’t use an Authenticator or a bank pin. But I’ve never shared my account details. My PC at the time was kept healthy and I always avoided phishing attempts.
---
Someone had gained access to it, and used it for some sort of macro but I was able to recover it.
---
They used it for RS3 and never even touched OSRS, so clearly this guy was a real P.O.S. 
---
Take out dad for sure. Big knockback attack, will hurt your xp rate a lot.
---
Yup. I used to write out plans for Thieving before I got members. It was something like 1-20 Men (picture of man), 20-40 HAM, 40-50 Guards? etc.
---
I really like the lunar isle method of banking for vork.
---
After Fremmy elite, where do you bank?

Maintaining bonds really isn't that hard

You decide yourself. If you don't get a ring, you will make hardly any profit

You might have to swap in different bosses. But it really depends on what method too I believe. If you plan to use prayer potions and pray protection, then yes the trolls can F you up quick. If you plan to use the other methods that don't require prayer, then no I believe you will be ok but you might lose a little bit of time with dad since he can hit you far away and that will make you lose a second or two. 
---
its in the 90s, like 93 or something
---
but honestly the difference really isn't worth the amount of attention required imo.
---
Fuck off Serene.
---
I am so impressed. no lie.
---
no sorry
---
Dude jad spawns at the yellow Mager on round 63. Just stand in front of it. Don’t try to do that safe spot bullshit behind Italy rock like the guides tell you to do.
---
&gt;Took me **at least** an hour and 45 minutes to get through all 62 waves, but it was incredibly easy. I had plenty of super restores and brews left over for Jad.
---
This really sounds way too slow, are you waiting for HP to regen?
---
&gt;Get to Jad and take him to the healers, panic when they start to get a lot of damage in on me and fuck up my prayer flick while drinking brews. Done in 5 minutes.
---
Just do 1 action per prayer flick, also using F-keys would make it easier to switch between prayers and inventory.
---
&gt;It's the 2 hour dedication to that one single task that is making me dread a re-attempt though, I don't want to waste all of that time for nothing.
---
Just do it instead of putting it off, 2 hrs is nothing.
---
What do you plan to release first? Warding or Song of the Elves? And when can we expect both of them?
---
What options you have selected within the GPU plugin? 
---
I know, I don't know why on earth I ran away after killing yellow mage.  Also the first 45 (Wave 3) uses Jad's spawn.
---
True but slayer is just so meta people usually kill most monsters/bosses on task. 
---
I'm gonna say that, since my account is around 10 years old, I don't have a clue as to what are my recovery questions, and I don't know any of my older passwords.
---
I check with everything else OP posted(no antivirus tho, mine is Common Sense™).
---
Is there any way Jagex can review my security questions so I at least try to remember their answers?

---
Good ol' Canifis pole jump.
---
I’m interested as to why you don’t want to do nmz. Is it because you don’t have the best bosses unlocked?
---
Jagex fucked up and put a respawning t bow outside the farm guild. They quickly rolled back the entire game to undo that 
---
Hookers and cocane

The account recovery system invalidates authenticators, it’s hella backwards.

I am a noob - I knew why you said it.

They don’t really pk they’re the ones killing the imp and goblin in the corner 
---
If I want to make a pking acc to duo rev caves/multi what would be a good range and magic level to get to?
---
Also would it be better to cannon to that ranged level or afk at crabs?
---
yeah it is not retarded way like those 2
---
Yeah, but it's not as good here.
---
EZ
---
No thanks. There is a simple solution for you if you want those things: become a member.
---
I've never understood the argument behind bringing "dead content" from P2P to F2P. According to the community around 73% of the content is what they call "dead content".  So if we're going to apply that logic to everything, Jagex might as well make the entire game free to play. 
---
Giving them better money makers is easily countered by the fact that those methods will be botted to death. Combined with the higher price associated with those items it will cause massive inflation, potentially ruining the economy.
---
Then I'm not even talking about the many inconsistencies. F2P generally does not have access to items that are obtained through member exclusive content, with the exception of cosmetic items. If they do get access to those items, they'll end up getting some weird (inconsistent) method of obtaining it. Take Antipoison potions for example.  With Herblore it requires unicorn horn dust, in F2P you need to give cadava berries to the Apothecary. They made it F2P for a F2P boss nobody even seems to be doing.
---
Yeah, you're going to need better arguments.
---
How bout the community gets together and speeds some information about where to get help for gambling addiction instead of whining to jamflex about the deal arena 😐

Gf acc
---
There's other information in my recovery request that should verify my account ownership prior to 2010. Obviously, i have a lot of paranoia about saying that here for everyone to see with everything going on with my account, but it's there for Jagex to see. I completely understand your disbelief in what I'm saying though. I was the same way with other people until this actually happened to me.
---
Its the bloody mark of Cain \*pats down self spins a circle\*
---
Made it had 4 times on my ummaxed pure. Healers stress me out.. 
---
agree, just another alchable :P
---
Did you.manage to get the cape using this set up
---
I've been following the economic crisis for a while, through work, and I *think* I saw an article about Venezuelans farming in-game currency but I guess I thought it would be a barely noticeable minority. 
---
Just took a look at nature runes and dragon bones. WOW.
---
Don't see this happening.  The ability to level up and then retroactively drop your levels will cause weird issues, you could max your account/complete the quest cape and then drop your defense to 1 but now you have access to barrows gloves, for example.
---
Tele to Lunar Isle - use the bank there (you can use one of them without a seal of passage) - then chat to anyone else (without a seal of passage) and they boot you off the island, straight into Relekka market
---
When I was at you level I used to afk cannonballs while studying. It's ok exp and money for how afk it is at a low level.
---
Thought you were going for "This is Sparta", but even then he says "I'm" ;)
---
Locking xp/modify xp will never happen, but technically nowadays with Runelite and other 3rd party clients you can disable certain attack styles so you will not misclick. That's about as close as it will ever get. 
---
Ding Ding Ding
---
Just use old reddit, they already changed it 
---
So because they decide to pk in a pk zone you're mad? 😂😂 
---
I will second this. Got it at 107 combat on slayer task and it was a lot easier, and taking a break before helps a ton. Just cheeeeel u got this bro
---
As a zarosian , nice idea and nice models. I agree seren is too close to rune(t) and the god book won't have much purpose. These are some cool looking sets though ngl. Whilst I wouldn't mind the implementation of serene since zaros is in - I think the os team would rather create a new direction, with the way zeah is going they intend to. I hope theres some sort of nod to serene in the new quest (hype)
---
Oblique?????????? Wtf his bicep bro lmfao
---
It's supposed to be hard or else the cape wouldn't be such an achievement.  Either adapt or be overcame 
---
Yeah it's a pretty immense impact
---
Yeah I know caveman was the first (that I know of). Not gonna lie I've only ever been interested in settled and he deserves the youtube success but it's sad to see so many others go without notice. 
---
I've been talking to my Venezuelan friend, he gets 12 hours working water per week, he doesn't have internet at home so he can never contact us, he's offline a lot cause of the power outages and he has a family including a newborn sister.
---
And yet he has a very low opinion of RS gold farmers, in fact he specifically told me to kill as many Venezuelan gold farmers as I cam and insult them in Spanish. I haven't obliged him because of the reasons here but its kinda weird that he has very little empathy for the RWTers
---
It's not really an unpopular opinion, more of a super obvious one, hence my sarcastic reply. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation has spent billions researching new contraception tech specifically with developing countries in mind. They currently have  a big prize available for an effective condom that only covers the tip. 
---
I tele to house (doesn’t matter where). 
---
Hit pool if you have one. If not just pray at altar and eat a few cheap food when you get to lunar isle bank. 
---
Use a house portal to lunar isle. 
---
Bank on the far south bank booth. 
---
When you’re ready to return to vorkath talk to the banker in the middle and he will teleport you just south of the vorkath boat.

Sounds like a lot of steps, but when you get the rhythm down you can be back at vorkath within 90 seconds.

Be aware that a lot of pure clans are active at revs. If you duo, you will be outnumbered a lot.

It's so fun. I loved learning jad. Now I rejoice when I get had tasks!
---
true
---
Nice 
---
Christ, in Cambridge? Turbo yikes
---
In my understanding it wasn't sanctions, it was Dutch disease. By I think 2014 80%+ of Venezuela's economy was based on oil. The state owned oil company, PDVSA, subsidized all of the welfare programs that made Chavez popular and kept him in power. That was all fine and dandy when oil prices were high. 
---
The problem is with such a strong export economy, the Bolivar was a very strong currency. So much so that it was significantly cheaper for everyone involved to import food, medicine, etc. Domestic suppliers just couldn't compete with cheap foreign imports. So the domestic supply of everything needed to keep a country going died out. But it was fine because PDVSA paid for imports. 
---
Once oil prices dropped, so did PDVSA revenues. All of the sudden there's no money to import and distribute goods, and no domestic supply either. That's why you hear of shortages. Of course this was all exacerbated by rampant corruption and nepotism. 
---
Having a market economy would have mitigated the impact, but the situation in Venezuela is a textbook case of "don't base your entire economy on a single commodity", not socialism vs. capitalism or American imperialism. Maduro is a corrupt autocrat through and through. 
---
This. That Q&amp;A thread is insufferable. The security team should have their own Q&amp;A but instead they hide and dare not come out Bc they already know. And I feel really bad for the Devs as if it’s their fault since they are putting their faces on the line. 
---
Va fongool skatidza, cappesh? 
---
You sound like a garbage person 
---
I found a different one that looks exactly like the legit rs3 one, lost 95m to a scammer.  Feels bad
---
The past few fuckups weren't even small. The max cash drop would have been caught by anyone playing the game for 10 minutes. 
---
Osrs is too ez compared to what rs used to be. Zooming out that far makes the fight much easier. 
---
Of course it's proportional but that wasn't the point of who I replied to. 
---
Whats ur rsn so I can exclusively hunt you down
---
Its fun until cb lvl 65 or so. Once you get past rune armor and weapons.
---
I gave a Venezuelan a gout tuber once so you could say I'm somewhat of a  humanitarian myself.
---
It's not so much that it's the wilderness, it's the fact that they're like ants in every world and no matter what I can't do anything at revs without being piled by them. They risk nothing and they swarm you like flies on shit, that's why I don't like them. I can don't really care about real pkers or clans, but yeah, it's annoying when you're being ragged by 10 million Venezuelans who risk shit in every world 
---
Stake it, ez 2 mil
---
expected result from posting this on reddit, rip mod sween's comment.
---
I am simply trying to max profit per hour. I think that banking on occasion saves more time than B2P, plus you need super sets to be efficient. Blowpipe is too costly and lowers gp/hr.  Why aren't you using dds against ahrim? It's significantly higher dps than blowpipe. Void has pretty poor defense and increases food usage or prayer pots usage. I can tank karil this way thanks to the hp restoration from my pool.   
---
Maximizing number of chests without banking does not make the highest profit per hour. At 1m / hr it's 277.77 gp per second earned, so it is super easy to calc whether banking or restoring stats at clan wars is worth it. You just need to see how much you are spending on energy restoration (and pray/hp). 
---
Making people pay bonds for some account security? Nty
---
? It's true tho
---
I just don't understand why you keep saying "2010" then? It's about the account owner, account creator, not since when you had your email attached or since when you paid membership. And now you say there's account information prior to 2010? Why would you wanna tell everyone about everything from 2010 onwards, but not prior to? What's paranoia about that?
---
&gt; Past Bank Pins
---
You had bank pins in the past, but not currently?
---
&gt; Multiple Membership Transaction ID's dating all the way back to 2010

Someone else has transaction ID's prior to 2010?

&gt; My recovery request is coming from the email that has been registered to this account since 2010
---
At the account creation there was a different registered email address? 
---
&gt; My recovery request is coming from the email that has been registered to my membership payment methods since 2010
---
And someone else had their email registered and paid membership prior to 2010?
---
&gt; My recovery request is coming from the device I've been using to play for the past 3-4 years
---
That doesn't imply account ownership. Maybe you bought the account and the seller recovered it.
---
&gt; My recovery request is coming from the IP address I primarily use to play
---
&gt; The hacker's recovery request came from a completely unrelated email address
---
Proof? Maybe it was the first registered email address?
---
&gt; The hacker's recovery request came from a completely unrelated device
---
Proof? Maybe it was the device someone played on prior to 2010? 
---
&gt; The hacker's recovery request came from a completely unrelated IP address
---
Proof? Maybe it came from the IP the account was created on?
---
Basing over 80% of your economy on a single commodity doesn't work. 
---
Unfortunately the world works inverse to logic. Poor people usually have more children while the wealthy generally have less.
---
I don't :( tried 3 times. Instead, saved up for a blowpipe, so I will be going back soon.
---
Agree. He's definitely a total dick. But abusing a system to achieve it isn't the way to go.
---
When you shit in the OSRS room
---
I personally look at the results prior to voting so I can gauge how controversial an update may be. If it's barely passing then I know that I need to read more into it before deciding as it likely isn't as black and white as I can at first see. If it's passing by a wide margin then usually that's because it's just a good update and in those cases I'll just vote with my gut.
---
That all being said I think the results should be hidden. I may use it to help me understand the updates better but most people just dump their votes in the winning side if they have no opinion.
---
Me and my friend when we were like 9years old, i had a tree branch as a rune scimmy and he had a small tree with roots as a g maul.
---
Proceeds to whack the living shit out of me with the tree straight to my face, got koed.... And smited
---
ah, the maze random event rewards nature runes sometimes i believe as well.
---
What range level?  I'm currently at 65 and wanting to do it soon.  AFK at sand crabs rn trying to get to 70 ranged.
---
Just YT some people doing F2P to Main, or just people who are starting fresh on a new account going from 0 to X gold. I do believe SirPugger had an old video from a year or two ago that showed some methods for new members.
---
You could also go to PvP worlds and loot.
---
knowing these types of polls, i bet one guy just added 3 stripes to the osrs side.
---
Yes the authenticator that can be removed immediately if my basic information is found or a database leaks, I suddenly feel immune.
---
Check out the wiki, you can order the money making guides by skill levels, choose one of the easier ones =) 
---
Well I happen to also be working on 99 agility at the moment, so I'm sitting on a fat stack of marks. I'll look in to staminas and see how the gp/xp works out. Thanks for the tip!

How would you recommend I get started with Slayer? I actually don’t even know what it is haha 
---
My morytania locked ultimate ironman.
---
D pick drops no where else... I'd say your hand is definitely forced in the matter. I wouldn't expect a spade hunting simpleton to understand evident meaning.
---
Blimey, that show is still going apparently. 
---
Remember watching it like...7 years ago and it was getting drawn out then. 
---
Got my first with 52 prayer 73 range on mobile.  Took 2 attempts but whatever now I've killed had like 9 times for slayer.  Still no pet though.. one day.
---
buy bonds with IRL Currency and sell in game for gold. ez safe rwt. 
---
use that money to train to 75 runecraft then start running at zmi altar for 4m gp/hr or whatever else you want. 
---
ree
---
I remember pretending to be low on run energy and stopping to walk every 3 meters

Thanks for your answer, some honest work could be good for me 
---
I think the first area restricted Ironman was wildependant. Although it was an unofficial Ironman. He made it before Ironman accounts were even an option
---
Yeah it is but thats not with my method. The afk method requires clicking once per 15 mins

My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

LOL "spade hunting" you poor broke sweet summer child. I've gotten multiple d picks from vetion and callisto kid and then pked some bank loot later.

There are slayer masters scattered around the map. I usually go to the guy in the edgeville dungeon 
---
Haha OMG please it made my day yesterday can we please have another one again haha
---
G maul specs attack instantly
---
There's obviously some luck involved in any success story but I feel like him being more popular is also due to his content appealing to more people/being flat out better. No hate towards any other video creator, I myself tune into the karamja videos, but if your stuff has been out for longer and is still going unnoticed maybe it's just not as good. There's entire companies who have built their success on polishing a product idea they didn't come up with.
---
Yeah desperately waiting for more stuff from Zeah - kinda hope Xeric is a Mahjarrat.... That'd be insane!
---
He does 300-400k views per episode when it comes out. 
---
Netflix would be dumb not to pick up this gem. 
---
Probably because things haven’t changed. I don’t know how things can change sporadically when you have the “freedom” empire placing sanctions against them and a president trying to hold on for his life, no matter the cost 
---
Because it’s meant to be shitty. What kind of business model is that to make F2P totally bearable? The aim is to get you to buy members.
---
Looks like one person drew the whole thing
---
So you dont have any of the farming cape one left?
---
What if you lose your phone/authenticator codes? What if you lose access to registered email (old school/work email for example)? What if your account gets locked?
---
I’ll look into that. Thanks! 
---
RS2 used opengl starting 2009
---
I did mention it in my OP lol. "Past ISP's, Past Passwords, Past Payment Methods, Security Questions"
---
No, I don't have the email address prior to 2010. I know the email, but I don't have access to it. That email provider doesn't even exist anymore. Do you still have your same email address from \~15 years ago?
---
Laziness? Believing my authenticator would protect me? Didn't really care about the items that much since I haven't been that active on the account lately? I don't know, but why would I lie about not having one now, but having past ones? If I was going to lie about this, wouldn't I say I have one now?
---
It's not saving up I just have to actually get 75 range lol. I'm determined to do it old school right now though
---
Just stay on one side of island. Bring 3 way range/mage switch. Stand behind pillars to eat/avoid attacks.  Dont care for zulrah so never learned rotation, got my kill and dipped.
---
&gt;Most of us played RS2 HD in 2008 on ancient toasters.
---
2008 not 2009
---
Doing more than Jagex
---
I want the real game not a private server..
---
This is what is wrong with runescape players who get scammed or hacked.  Just gullible greedy idiots who fall for anything that is too good to be true. 
---
yeah the rune armor is way too similar to trimmed rune, but the prayer robes and dhide look good.
---
i can trim those prims too!
---
&gt;Kid
---
Funny way to choose to discredit yourself 
---
my question is why was the original account owner fucking with the op, threatening to drop untradeable? if you got your account back wouldn't those still be useful? is it pettiness ? vengence? 
---
Just make your own account to avoid problems like this in the future, it’s simple enough
---
Let me tell you something ass-eyes, let me tell you ALL something: war has made me very PARANOID! and when you get to eye-balling me, makes my Agent Orange act up, makes me want to KILL!
---
No prices are permanent.  Anyone who says such a thing does not understand the fundamentals of economics.  
---
I would wager that prices actually rose a while back when mobile came out.  Farming is very lucrative, mobile friendly, low time/effort, and ranarrs are the first herb most people would grow (and, likely the most common one to remember for returning players of old).  
---
Then, as time goes on, people move on to other things, people stop playing, etc. and the price bounces back down. It's also possible farming contracts are to blame but if that was enough to have such a major impact I'd think people would have noticed that much sooner.  
---
This is all just speculation.  I could very well be wrong.
---
As for your last question, there's definitely an opportunity here for flipping, and likely for a longer term merch as well.  The true question is how long-term are we talking, which is something I can't answer.  
---
Ok, so what if you've somehow lost access to your registered email and your phone with your authenticator crashes?
---
Lend me the bow and I won't have too! Cheers though dude, I am getting closer every time just so hard staying calm with so much going on. It helps reading so many people saying the first few were the same for them.
---
I think your crying about doing pvm in the wilderness has already done that. 
---
Damn he even deleted his account he was not prepared for those questions you animal
---
Highly inadvisable. They're paying you for this, after all. Your employees would probably get pretty mad too, as others have mentioned. And if you use a company computer, they're probably going to see OSRS.
---
If you absolutely must, do something on mobile that you can quickly put down and don't have to watch, like fishing or woodcutting. You'd treat it like an idle game; set it to do the thing, put the phone down (maybe in your office, maybe in your pocket) and walk around doing your thing, and when you get a moment, check on the thing. No scaping while walking, though. That's just a bad idea.

Osrs he finally got what he wanted osrs jagex osrs Ironman osrs

I was parked waiting on an inspector to show up

I gave it a shot last night for the first time. Made all the way to jad then panicked and died.

these are amazing! genuine lol
---
Okay thanks. Good luck with your recovery attemps. You could tag JMods in your post.
---
If u want minimal effort making Cannonballs is always a go to while doing anything else IRL
---
Nice lad
---
Dont do wildy slayer, go to vannaka and get tasks from him and train slayer while training combat and prayer. best advice. will take a bit longer to get stats but much more efficient. 
---
The sanctions are not on the country, but on the dictatorship's leaders.
---
Okay? But how do you consider it ***1-hit***? Just because it's on the same tick it doesn't mean that it's just one single hit, it still has separate hit splats.
---
I think they look great
---
Talk to Oziah, pray to RNGesus and paint your computer with platypus blood

Since I have lady bits, I can tell you that neither I nor any of my girl friends would let any disgusting neckbeard who refers to having sex with us as "pussy" anywhere near us. But tell me again how I don't know anything about pussy.

Vorkath leans to range often when I fight so I just pray range and tank mage.

We all want some heroin... It's okay..

Do us all a favour and answer this simple question. Are you the original owner of the account?/did you create the account? yes or no
---
Then what question are you asking? We'd need more information and a full question if you want an answer.
---
Best (skill) training is with Full Obsidian. Best points is (AFAIK) the gear you mentioned with all bosses on.
---
Think about your comment there my dude
---
Imagine actually thinking it's sad that someone would try to accommodate their spouses needs by making a minimal effort sacrifice.  
---
Awesome, I'll keep an eye out for this ^^
---
Why aren’t some of the features that runelite has updated to be included on the vanilla client? GPU/Smooth texturing being one of them. 
---
I... dont usually feed the trolls.. but.. Jesus fuckin christ if you make another fuckin text face you might actually have some mental disability...
---
exactly! I didn't xfer my stuff (2 phat sets!!!) into rs2 because I liked rsc better. When they made it members only, my 4th grade ass couldn't get membership so i lost it all.
---
I do the same. When I’m at work I do sand crabs and when I’m at home I do nmz. 
---
Me. Panic mode
---
I used to draw layouts for my Poh never got construction up though. Nowadays I have a max house to make up for it. 
---
That's honestly way less time then I expected. 
---
I'm checking some efficient levelling guides. Is starting by getting 99 fishing a meme or something people actually do?
---
No problem dude. Just make sure to remember the killing order and use the rocks and you'll be surprised at how little damage you'll take.
---
Eh I wouldn’t call being a human metronome too skilled. Especially when third party clients tell you exactly how to do it.

You should get bonus xp for that.

In deep wildy there are no items u keep on death. The only items u keep are the ones shown in the lost on death screen

Mind blown how many in this thread have given up after 2-3 tries. I spent almost a whole week trying to complete it before I finally got it. 
---
Did it say when you last logged in as early today or from a different IP when you checked your main? If it didn't say either of those I would say it was just a glitch, but if you don't remember I'd bank everything when you log out just to be sure for awhile

Have fun getting chainbanned

&gt;everything that's meant to be soloed
---
Is there a lot of forced group content?
---
Lmao why is almost everyone here so toxic towards f2p players
---
If you ever see something with http and not https, stay away
---
bingo
---
I think I was doing Vorkath before hand, and I prefer having it off as I do BGS-&gt;Blowpipe and if my switches are slow I run into melee range because of auto-retaliate.
---
This looks sick! Your friend's pretty talented!!
---
They've been talking about reworking hew magic defence and attack works, they should combine this with warding. Lower regular black d'hides mage defence and when you enchant it (or something like that) it get more mage defence. Same idea for mystics but adds more mage damage. 
---
In the current state warding adds nothing. Yes I know firemaking has no use but no need to add more.
---
As far as I'm aware nothing's strictly group only, albeit Raids 2 isn't meant to be soloed - quite cheesy and inefficient to solo it.
---
One round KO if you prefer. If we're going purely by hitsplats it doesn't really make sense. Can't include veng / recoil and dharoks is the only meta. I was going by quickest instead of minimum number of hitsplats, like most people would. Going for consistently quickest is another thing, but again, twisted bow is probably not the meta. Dds specs should be + veng. 
---
Where do you think RuneScape came from?
---
Ooh, I didn't know about the bandit camp gen store. I've been going all the way to Varrock armour shop lol.
---
Guessing Ranaar is the best for this?
---
Yeah that guy has no clue what he is talking about. Plenty of legit people on sythe
---
I'd settle for that
---
I’ve spotted you doing herbiboars last week, I remember that name. Also have the urge to lookup stats when I see someone, sick account man! On the grind to 99 hunter atm
---
Updooted for smackdown.

If there's no rs logo on it your good to go

Engine work.

When are you going to patch the animation stall glitch that people use with books to push people out of banks in PVP worlds?? 
---
Only if u hate ya self n decide to play as a ironman
---
AESTHETICC\*
---
I'd definitely recommend it. It's so damn good. 
---
if you are an ironman thats a legit strat, more reasonable to probably get ~92 (barb fishing gives slight str and agil xp as well)
---
Isnt he that guy who died to a basement?
---
No because security is fine.  People are just retarded.
---
Do you actually need those buyable skills to play the game though? I saw that the max cape on OSRS is purely cosmetic.
---
The problem with the tbow isn't how strong it is everywhere, it's how strong it is against bosses with high magic. Makes a lot of bosses go from a real challenge to just plain easy. The passive effect of the bow should have been nerfed more heavily on release to prevent things like inferno and various bosses from being twice as easy when done with a tbow. Watching streamers use tbow to take down bosses is so resident sleeper because half the challenge is taken away. It's just a poorly designed, powercreeped item.
---
Blowpipe is also very strong and also is too good against enemies with low range defence. Jagex should just make rapid bp less accurate, but engine work probably.
---
Sheep herder is up there on the frustration charts though
---
If you are looking strictly at cost for 99 probably not but if you plan to ever use range post 99 (such as bossing) then buy rigour first. It will save you some time and gp plus 99 range isnt really useful for bossing without rigour. 
---
Bro the feels

Our asses earning cheap ass phats from the dupe only to lose them to sweet justice

What’s the rush
---
Wow he was crazy dry

I got it around 3k, well before 99!
---
You got this!! 
---
What would you use if you have dhcb then?
---
I bet your brother is trolling you.
---
When I was 14 I used to log into my 12 yr old brother's account and bank everything but his keep on death stuff and tele him to lumbridge/pray/eat.
---
No what happened, wether you’re full on bullshitting us or actually got hacked, the fact that you’ve received no response on twitter, **the single place they say we can contact them**, is unacceptable. 
---
This is a really interesting take that makes a lot of sense, something to incentivize players to train it. if there’s going to be a new skill, i want it to have use. I think we can all agree lol. Didn’t the original idea Change how we imbue? (No longer from NMZ)
---
I love the workaround they made because they couldn't dynamically show the dead unicorn for each player. They just added an identical second room except with the unicorn dead in it and teleport you to it after you kill it.
---
A dragonfire ward lol, dfs is for meele
---
There are always fishing spots. They don't despawn, they simply move. If it seems like there are less at some point it's likely that 2 or more spots are stacked.

1

Looks like they dropped in price
---
It doesn't seem that long a grind, and starting with a high strength level and skipping the low agility levels might be worth it. Gonna consider it lol
---
I'm not sure about arclight I never really used it. A bgs would help, but no spec wep is alright, vine whip is accurate enough, but you will miss more on olm hand. It doesn't really matter if you are doing 1:0 though, which I'd recommend starting with.

Getting your money doubled at GE. Limitless gp/hr

I listened to an [NPR Podcast](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=621563128) about how bad things are there. There's no real way to measure how impoverished they are because at some point inflation rates start being so high that they become meaningless. 
---
Instead, they measured how many calories you can buy with minimum wage, buying the cheapest available source of calories:
---
"Take a typical Venezuelan worker, someone who makes the minimum wage.  If he spent every single bolivar from his wage on that cheapest food  available, how many calories could he buy in one day? Here is the  incredible and frankly devastating answer from Ricardo.
---
This is a calculation that went from buying 57,000 calories a day in 2012 to buying less than 900 calories today.
---
Which means that, you know, if a person normally spends over 2,000  calories a day, it means that a worker cannot feed myself, let alone his  family. He - and that's assuming he doesn't spend anything in clothing,  in transportation, in medicines, in housing, et cetera. So it just  gives you a sense of how catastrophic is the collapse in income."
---
It's a seriously sad podcast, less than 10 minutes, I'd recommend giving it a listen.
---
and if you get the pet from a yew tree it should also have a 1/1k chance to say "yew have a feeling yew are being followed"

Grow ranarr weeds and get daily battlestaves from Zaff.

I also hate the fact that we can't use a vertical keyboard on OSRS mobile. I'd rather tilt my phone 90 degrees then type horizontally.

Howd you get the tabs on the left

It's not manipulation it's how the game has worked forever.  J mods know about it and haven't said once that it is abuse in anyway 
---
What are your thoughts on how most Q&amp;A's are just people asking for game suggestions now rather than questions about the game? I remember the first year they did Q&amp;A's and the majority of questions back then was about lore, game mechanics, and other odd ball stuff. Nowadays nearly all the questions on the Q&amp;A's are about whether something could be added to the game. Honestly they should rename it to suggestions and answers cause that's what it has become.

For hydra the only way for poison to affect it is if it’s already on the tile before the poison comes but not if it’s walking into it... can this be fixed? 
---
Back in early rs2/ late rsc I met a dude named Hero fishing on karamja. 
---
Don't you need to be really good at the game to get the infernal cape? Did that change in the last year?
---
Each arma piece literally gives 3 more accuracy than black d hide, pretty much 30% better than blessed coif while while chest is 10% better than dhide body. 
---
I sold some brutals afk money farm gear and just bought melee/range (bp)/mage gear for slayer only if it’s indeed more efficient,

It’s all cuz of slayer i guess since ahrim hood is 70k and other pieces 2,4m

Upvoting to show everyone your stroke
---
Thought I'd mention as you said you started a year ago. Most skills are way worse on OSRS, the only ones I'd say are arguably better are agility, smithing and fletching.

Do you protect pray or camp smite?  And is 20 bolts enough for an extended fight?

I died to a bear while AFK on Zeah

So it means all chad ToB'ers own a coloured serp helm? Or are they too obsessed with ToB to actually acquire one?

The whole game has literally no value unless you have fun or rwt

Be smart with your time

it will only get easier as time goes on and people will hate it later for same reason they do rs3 power creep
---
Im at 160kc and no items.. :(
---
I bet someone can make a bot that auto-flicks for you. 
---
I am wondering how people in this sub feel about giving f2p a bit more content in the game. I think more f2p content would intice more new player to try the game and eventually buy membership.
---
An example of more f2p content would be to allow p2p (all or some) skills in f2p until level 20 or 30. After that level, the xp gains stop in the skill.
---
I was just wanting to see what the community thinks about this. 
---
I am member btw. I just thought that something like this might help the game gain more players in the long run.
---
I'm not sure if I'll ever get inferno cape- 10 years in (and a switch to osrs) and I'm nowhere close to being able to beat Jad :/
---
I mean Cloud Badass can flick every GWD minion in a DFS but most of us aren't that great. That's why we'd need tank gear. Then again, content like GWD is just bland and outdated imo. You're right about this though. And that's why it's so hard to create decent PvM content to revive tanking.
---
Looks like you clicked the prayer right at the beginning of the tick that rolled whether or not Jad would hit you based on prayers.
---
Just because there has been more than 1 person who has tried to do that doesnt mean you have half the autistic retards in this thread automatically trying to discredit the OP completely disregarding the actual content of his post and comments which heavily suggest he actually is the OO of the account. 
---
&gt; Most account recovery posts go nowhere or get Jmod smackdown'd because most aren't the original owners. It's perfectly reasonable to be sceptical of them.
---
Yeah most go nowhere, because Jagex's customer support is complete dog shit and that should be known by now, thats all its evidence of. 
---
However saying MOST arent original owners or something like that is just completely disingenuous when reddit is basically the only form of customer support Jagex has so youre trying to discredit the MANY people who actually are OO of accounts and still have significant issue with account security and recovery, also insinuates that Jagex's customer service actually isnt shit which would be insane.
---
You'll have to keep saving up since you'll be burning through scales and darts
---
Yeah it took me about 300 kills at Zulrah before I felt comfortable enough to do it without the visual guide
---
I just want to play with my screen vertical. 
---
Originally the highlight guy politely asked solomission to remove his copyright strike on his channel, and solo basically responded with give me 300 bucks or fuck off.
---
I'm not here to argue who is in the wrong here, but it's obvious that there's more to this than solo is letting on. They're both acting like petulant babies. If you don't want someone using your content, ask them to stop without striking their channel as a first step. 
---
Just funny lol
---
I mean if you want to preserve prayer you'd use prayer gear and drink pots, 1-tick flicking is akin to the logging out to preserve stat boost.
---
If you ever feel committed to questing, just do it so you don't have to do it later/have it already done in scenarios where you would feel forced to do it. Goodluck! 
---
The current price doesn't matter for ones he already has. Say he bought 10k and after 5k he broke even you would need the price to double (the initial price) for it to be more profitable with his current trend.
---
Anyways gambling like clues is more a statics problem then an economic one. If he is ahead because of a 2% chance then it could be feasible to sell. But 10 to 15% chance to stay in line or out preform current sample is worth it in my books. It's all about preference and how much you trust your luck
---
upvoted for jmod smackdown
---
hydra is fine, task-only and you need to use an inefficient slayer master to even get the tasks
---
Because no one who properly secures their account has been hacked, except by a jmod (but I saw Jimmy secured his account! He said so on Reddit! Yeah well Jimmy is wrong)
---
Now thats a good vintage osrs meme.
---
It's inconsistent for one reason: People. They're all reviewed by humans, many different humans could review yours. One human makes different choices than another. 
---
Eh you would lose it sooner or later.
---
I was in WT, eating after every hit. Server lagged out on me and I got insta killed.
---
What kind of gear and statline were you rocking for each? 
---
Damn son, you're right. Didn't know sleep deprivation could make me this mentally disabled.
---
This reminds me of my friend getting ranger boots doing his first medium quest about a week into the game and rubbing it in on me and my friend that were grinding hard the month before.
---
Didn’t know that. Thought DHCB was just good because the effect
---
1 law rune huh? Your account is mine gf noob
---
That’s not the last unique though. His last unique was twisted buckler. Can’t remember the kc though. 
---
There's a plugin on Runelite (third party client, use at your own risk etc.) called Bank Tags.
---
It allows you to have vertical tabs where you can have items feature in more than one "tag". For example, you can have tags for Vorkath and Slayer as well as a tab for potions, with Prayer Potions being in all of them. Hopefully that makes sense?
---
I have 13 pray and I'm not good enough to tick eat so that's a no. Not sure I will ever have the motivation to learn it either.
---
I really hate when video games disguise how easy a boss fight is by locking it behind 1.5hrs of bullshit to get to it, then if you fuck up once its like "nope, you're dead, gotta put in another 1.5hrs to get back and give it another try!"  
---
There's a reason they don't let you just practice jad on unrestricted worlds. It's because they know how fucking easy it would be if you could get more than 10s of practice every 1.5hrs.
---
If you have 2fa on the e-mail, don't have known legacy security questions, have 2fa on your OSRS account, and don't RWT/download/go to shitty websites your fine.
---
All you're doing is working yourself up over a boogeyman. How many max mains are out there? How many have been hacked percentage wise? Not that many. Yes the OSRS community is persistent about account theft but if you're doing the right things nothing will happen.
---
You are your own worst enemy.
---
But since you seem to be so scared:
---
* Change your password right now
---
* Change your password every 4-6 weeks
---
* Use KeePass or something similar
---
* Change your e-mail from your login to a one off e-mail. I recommend crypto german e-mails as they have pretty damn good safeguards. Then your login won't be where the e-mail to remove 2FA.
---
* Seriously don't RWT or go to Hacker/RWT websites.(IF YOU EVER DO USE A FUCKING VPN)
---
* Don't click phishing links
---
* Careful who you Trust, specifically around Discord.
---
* If you Stream your gameplay at all you need to be well aware you have a target on your back and need to be assuming people are phishing you for info if they just come in and start asking tons of questions that seem random.
---
* Seriously if you Stream your gameplay this is where things will go tits up very quickly. Again you will compromise yourself, but its the most common way billionaires lose their banks when they don't RWT/download shit.
---
* 2FA on your e-mail(s). This is so important. Bigger then OSRS or any video game important.
---
TL;DR: You aren't going to be hacked unless you fuck up.
---
That's the dream.. But not gonna happen.
---
It really depends on what you are going to do with the max melee. Do you have void/elite void?
---
I think he meant that it was very dry to still have 2 items left at 2402 kc, but I'm not entirely sure.
---
At first I thought this was a general meme about everyone... turns out it's about jmods using reddit. In that case, you should have also added some tiny yellow crowns to each head. :)
---
They're*
---
You did something terribly wrong if all 4 healers are hitting you. Also since Jad can hit 97 you should just assume that if he ever hits you, you're dead
---
Fire cape has drop not destroy
---
Thats one hell of a good rng right there.
---
Gz
---
I hate noobs like you always considering your RuneScape wealth to be real currency. People like you are going to be this games downfall. 
---
Nice job man :)

This isn't a fan concept, it's literally in the game
---
After 4440 Zulrah kills and no pet I decided to do Vorkath. However, my kill times are kind of shite, usually around 3 mins per kill. What am I doing wrong?
---
Level 91 range. 
---
Gear: Elite void, dhcb, anti-dragon shield, blessed boots, salve ammy (ei), archers ring (i), assembler, ruby and diamond dragon bolts (e). 
---
I want to like vork cause it’s fairly chill, but I was definitely getting more gp/hr at Zulrah with these slow vork times. 
---
No one will comment because hide poll results.
---
Location isn't the only thing used to determine this. Playtime cycles, passwords, authenticators, etc.  There's many thing's that could be used to tell if it's someone's account or not. Also bought accounts are very commonly stolen from buyers and then resold to someone else. 
---
Which is also not against the rules lol you're just stating random things within the game and saying they aren't right because you don't like to play that way
---
Don't those only work if you take damage?

I didn’t even bother respond to him.  I’m an IT Professional, I know damn well how not to get my accounts compromised (assuming they’re managed by companies that understand security).  Jagex has multiple holes in their “security” systems, there’s no point in arguing otherwise because it’s just a plain fact. 
---
START THE DAMN JOUST BEFORE I PISS MESELF
---
What does that have to do with literally ANYTHING were talking about?
---
WoW had a MUCH, MUCH, MUCH larger player base and therefore a bigger account trade/selling scene for the years and years it was far more popular than RS and there was not even close to as many issues with account security and recovery as there is with RS. 
---
Way bigger population of players and bigger account trade scene&gt;less issues
---
Smaller population of players and account sell/buy (since safe trading isnt even possible with Jagex's system which alone shows how much shittier it is)  scene&gt; far MORE issues
---
Do you not see how there is clearly a massive difference just in the numbers alone?
---
Regardless of current popularity, the difference between Blizzard's account security/recovery and customer support is so far superior to Jagex's that there isnt even an argument to be had lol.
---
Absolutely, hell i'd even include mith-rune drags just to bulk the list. Any old crap can go in there like even brutal dragons/revenants if possible.
---
Had no idea that was the pet mechanic. Thanks for the info!

in that case im just trash xd

Hi ... just a nooby question about switching spellbooks. can you do it in someone else's poh? as opposed to running to the pyramid and back
---
Unless you work for Jagex you can't possibly say that with 100% accuracy. You make wild claims whereas there have been cases here on reddit where people that were not true account owners getting their accounts recovered. Example one being the iron that lost anc legs to roll back then getting tbow and his account got recovered. Weath even commented on this. So the burden of proof lies on you to prove he was either 1. Account sharing or 2. Sold it. 
---
Good luck. The way the recovery system works is not the greatest and needs improvement is my final point. I don't see how you can argue that.
---
3 actually! Very icky 
---
i cant believe youre getting people with this low grade shoop

Didn’t trade confirm it, so I won’t believe it.

Copyright striking someone on YouTube and abusing the broken system before contacting them first and asking for them to remove you from their channel is ridiculous. Likewise, this idiot shouldve asked for permission first before using someone else's clips. There are no winners here. Just petulant manchildren.
---
Yeah challenge mode reward
---
Why are ammonites better?
---
Well if they have reason to believe it wasn’t you on the account at the time they’ll send you and email asking for previous sign-in locations like “x city and state”
---
Time frame of when you last played “x year to so year” and any previous passwords you might’ve used. 
---
It took maybe 2 to 3 months from the initial appeal before it was all said and done.
---
One other bonus of Stams is that you can make 27 potions at a time since the crystals stack.
---
Right, lets point at the most popularized examples on reddit, where people werent the OO the account and say "see look everything is GREAT about Jagex's account security/recovering and customer support".
---
Because that totally isnt a completely biased and invalid way to assess how good their systems actually are at all.
---
Firmly believe youre just a massive Jagex fanboy who cant even so much as criticize Jagex even in the places they receive the most valid criticism from. Keep that Mod Ash dick deep in your throat, its actually incredibly pathetic LOL.
---
Keep ignoring the fact Blizzard NEVER had anywhere near the same amount of issues as Jagex even though they had a far larger player base at their peak for years. Weird how you havent even attempted to address the clear gap in their systems and support. Probably because there isnt even any remotely valid argument to be made.
---
Yeah few weeks ago I was getting 2 to 3 a house.

It doesn't seem to be effected by the seeds that I can tell.

it’s a nice feeling getting something in your first few chests.

i’ve still only done about 20 chests in total but i’m expecting to go dry awhile lol.

I might start doing that then once I get some mushrooms from Sulliusceps. Good to know I can grind them out within the same time frame of herbs if I want to though.
---
The only question I have is if the berry replenish rate is much slower for bushes that are already grown. It seems like it's slower, but I might be completely wrong. 
---
I think a big flaw is that you can log in the RuneScape website without the authenticator. If they only would add that it would be impossible to remove it with access to the authenticator itself. That's how every other website works
---
This. Honestly blowpipe either needs a nerf, or the T-bow or the incoming crystal bow need to offer something substantially better than the blowpipe in SOME department. It's unfair how there is a weapon that has not only some of the best PvM dps, dot, AND a spec with sustain, all under the most op stat in the game. But  nobody is going to go for a nerf unfortunately, so maybe a buff for other weapons is the best bet.

Can we please remove the player limit for Last Man Standing? You currently need 24 players to even start a match. On casual mode. With no rewards.

If you remove this cap, at least some players and clans can play with smaller crowds.

Can all the castle wars items be made F2P? This would make castle wars items the void of f2p, and it would stimulate the castle wars community. The couch has long stated that they wished to make minigames more popular, and I believe this would be a great way of doing so. The tickets take a long time to collect, and the benefits are still tiny compared to that of members.   
---
I know some would be upset because this would change the f2p pk meta, to which I respond by saying that all items should be destroyed on death.

Sorry, but I'm not. Sick nerd calling him a content thief while blasting copyrighted music in his stream all day is hypocrisy. It just is. He doesn't have permission to play that music from the artists, and he is making his product more appealing because of them.
---
Or if the US ever drops its sanctions
---
Looks very similar to my routine. Heed my example: 39M xp and still nada.
---
i don't get that logic.
---
osrs allows streamers to stream their content. streaming the game is allowed. re: music? many streamers stream playing music they are allowed to. Some don't, and they risk running into issues (esp eu streamers soon). The difference is, music labels don't enforce their rights, unless the person who holds the right to the content cares then it's fine. There are a lot of content creators who absolutely do not want people stealing clips from their stream and profiting from them.

You can protect yourself from them.

What do you think of being able to burn god pages into burnt pages?
---
Maybe 1:5, 1:10 ratio?  some god pages are really cheap and pegging them to the price of 10x burnt pages for is a way to keep its price stable. This would help solving issue with very low rewarding clue scrolls (Guthix page!), and also create an alternative use for all the duplicate god pages ironman gets on their account.

Because I think a lot of people would want yours

Dude this sub brings out the worst in people sometimes, blows my mind.

That dude did recover his account successfully, and Weath basically implied his email was compromised.  So yeah he had shit security and got cleaned.  That's his fault but they gave him his account back.

You sacrifice damage with blowpipe? What are you on bro blowpipe has some of the best dps in the game lol.

“Has Jagex had a database leak?”

No, but it’s very commonplace nowadays for other sites to have database leaks

If only there was a delay of some sorts on removing authenticator

That's absolutely the reason they farm dragon bones

If you went to the Twitter thread where all of this went down, youd see streamers like Sick Nerd calling him a content thief. He is a content thief, I agree, but earlier this morning and probably throughout most of his streams he was blasting copyrighted music to make his stream more enjoyable. Did he ask all of the artists to make sure its okay for him to use that music? I doubt it. That's why these streamers are hypocrites. That's my entire point.
---
If you have a separate password for your email (which you should), then it will do a lot for you.

not at all an excuss but it should be acceptable,$11

Low effort. High quality.

Pk them all boys, let Guthix sort them out

Security questions aren’t the main way to recover since they’re now obsolete. If you had them set they can help, but if you don’t know them it’s not the end of the recovery process. 
---
Sounds like you may have just bought it if you don’t know anything about the account past the recovery questions
---
Yet they still get 'hacked' 
---
I’ve got 67 atk and str, 64 def, 69 range, 51 prayer and 58 mage.

I just started the other day and those stats were all 3-5 levels lower and it was still pretty easy. if you’ve got stats around there and use the right gear I’m sure you could do it. 
---
Did you ever get your prize?
---
Karils bow tho
---
That's why I use authy and not Google authenticator, authy can sync over multiple devices, so even if you brake your phone, you can use another one, the only bad thing that can happen is that someone can hack your authy and access authy, but I feel that authy is more secure than jagex/runescape
---
this has happened to me in the past as well. i had to log onto my old abandoned hotmail email to get 2004 transaction id's and it still took a few tries to recover the account.
---
Yea. Jagex gave it back after massive backlash from community, and b0aty threatened to quit OSRS.
---
Lol, if you're blowpiping you should pray range. Only pray mage if using DHCB.
---
Not securing your email correctly is your fault though. Lots of people probably use the same password for their email and their Runescape account.
---
A few of the obstacles can one shot you at the pyramid, so don’t go out unless you have Guthix rest. 
---
I need to complete I think 2 quests and I can finish morytania hard. I do have all other requirements done. 
---
Right, because you get offended im somehow wrong...nice, makes sense.
---
If you get offended because I was criticizing someone else calling someone an idiot for wanting to buy an account because they dont have the time to play the game much anymore because they have a life and arent a kid anymore or an adult that does nothing with their life then sorry bud cant help you, youve got bigger problems if THAT offends you so much.
---
Sure, im the asshole for criticizing the asshole who was calling a group of people idiots because they dont have the time to grind because they have a life. Fucking crazy LOL.
---
If you get offended by my simply MENTIONING how someone who has a life and cant commit the same level of time and dedication as someone who does nothing but play RS then HOLY HELL does that wreak of projection. I didnt even attempt to condemn someone for NOT having a life, simply mentioned it to make a point that calling someone an idiot is wrong.
---
Man some of you people on this sub that play this game are INCREDIBLY sensitive and offended by ANYTHING even if it wasnt offensive or even meant to be offensive at all.
---
You are colorblind if you think that's purple.
---
too forced
---
Possible except I’ve been hacked on Friday night and I’ve never once used a gold buying site (I have bought/sold between a friend irl though) 
---
No, only a select few people who followed osrs Reddit/twitter and saw woox post graphs on the DPS on various bosses would have known how strong it was in practice. Jagex didn't give damage and accuracy numbers, just a formula for the two based on magic levels. The vast majority of people aren't going to do that math and it's jagex's fault because they should know that and have accounted for it.
---
Nah buddy, I enjoy a lot of boring shows that you may not like, which is fine. Difference is you just want to be a hater and leave shit posts rather than real critique - on top of that attack me.
---
What are you even doing here, mate?
---
Since you already have 83 Construction, go for Rigour then IMO.
---
what combats are you guys? i have all the required gear and 105 cb, been looking for a duo to join (on EST btw) and usually on from 8pm-1am during weekdays and more on weekends
---
why
---
Idk I feel as if she should have a separate Armour set, even if only an aesthetic upgrade. The rune and dhide set seem bland we have so many already
---
Depends on what you're doing on your main. Also if you have tbow vs having to do switches. 
---
They don’t need publicity you fucking retard. These bottom feeder highlight channels (probably you) are spoiling their clips for your own YouTube gain, which in turn takes views away from their own streams and YouTube videos. OSRS Highlights (you) is bottom feeder garbage.
---
Saw a guy a while ago n osrs names OilyPussy lmao
---
What are your thoughts on adding Farming to F2P limited to the low level/unused  allotments and the F2P trees?
---
I killed vork 400 times after getting rigour. Same gear (bis everything) same level (99) exact same everything and I didn't come close to my PB and my avg barely changed. Rigour is overrated as fuck. 
---
I mean I would join but I never last long in clans. I'm at 100 solo xeric raids and I want to get into ToB. I just don't do get into social events. 
---
Woah that's pretty neat. Probably useful for noobs level like 1-20

I'm allowed to speak my mind and I'm allowed to be in this subreddit even if Settled isn't my "daddy". I feel like his content is boring, sue me.

He has a runelite plugin that changes the hc symbol displayed for you on your screen only. If you look him up on the high scores he will be crossed out. He was not given his status back.

That or he’s streaming his new hardcore with the 2007 restrictions that he made because his last one died and didn’t get its status back. 
---
Why is the fishing trawler a 15 minute game that on operates 1 game per world? It seems like this could work like the pest control boats. Once a certain number of people board the ship, it just sets off. This would also prevent people from simply getting 100% activity and then afking because with less people on each boat there is more accountability. 
---
Are you left handed?

Theproblem isn’t botting, it’s the Venezuelan gold farmers who are RWT

Merch clans do not exist, there are just scam groups. As a trader, other traders are competitors, they either cut your margins to buy/sell before you or match yours takeing part of the cake.

Old merch clans were just scamms to trick kids into pump and dumps, that has nothing to do with economics, merchanting, trading, investing or shit. Nothing.

Big capitals do no harm.

Never said you weren't allowed, just wondering why you want to purposely and actively be a bitch to his content and everyone that enjoys it. 
---
Enjoy your bitch life bro
---
See like what was the point of this comment? I'm not offended and even said you're right. No one is going to listen to you if you sound like a douche is all. Its only human nature, just like you can't change Trumpers by calling them idiots. If you want to make a point and to be taken seriously, you should stop addressing everyone as "idiots". PS: you can have a life and build an account.
---
I like this a lot. Agility being all laps is kind of terrible, it would reward game knowledge I.e. knowing the fastest route from a to b. Having to go to the wildy for high risk contracts would be fun too. 
---
he actually did quit if you look at the osrs twitch streams smh you out of the loop man
---
jsut so you know, going forward the best way to do a lot of content is with ranged or mage. I went members when i hit 60 attack, now I'm 75 atk 75str 70 def wishing i din't have to range to 75 and mage to 75 for a lot of the later content I want to do.  
---
Melee is dope but you spend a ton on gear and a ton on food because you don't get the benefit of safespots.  
---
on that note, mossies also are a nice multicombat area for using cannon.  
---
ALSO: download runelite. make sure it's the official site not a phishing scam, it will let you set stuff like tags for items on the ground showing their value, makes sure you don't miss any expensive loot, and lets you pass over the chaff you don't want to bother picking up let alone carting back to the GE.
---
80+ combat stats and void are good for cox, at least 95 in combat stats and 94 mage are good for tob
---
I'd imagine they are doing the best they can
---
team Cox is pretty braindead after 200kc or so, watch Netflix/podcasts and do olm just fine
---
36% of fantasy mmo players are women sorry I rounded up. Still higher than your estimate of 20%. Western rpgs like DA/skyrim/basically any AAA rpg right around 50%. Shooters, racing, and sports games have three lowest percentages at 2-10% so that's where the disparity is that is made up in casual puzzle games (still enjoyable, still games)
---
I know that's a lie because Boaty is one of the last streamers that doesn't want to use anything but the main client
---
Na - we have banks. Thing is this will change the game in ways you haven’t bothered to consider. Bossing will be much faster - can now do everything to prep for next run via one POH tele. Can store bones etc to make prayer training much faster. Put the bank next to the kitchen or dungeon and you’ve got a much faster/cheaper way of training construction. 
---
Devalues the seers/crafting cape tele.

When making suggestions consider ALL the effects, not just the benefits.

God damn the hidden brag

Damn created yesterday and already 473 clicks on that link rip
---
You good. I actually didn't know if that was a duel arena mechanic
---
I dunno, man +8 prayer bonus for an offhand slot seems pretty high. 
---
I mean the current +66 is crazy enough as is, but that would put it at +69 ^^^^hehe 
---
At that rate, piety, rigour, and augury  would cost 1 prayer point every roughly four seconds. 
---
So when someone has an opinion that you do not share they are a bitch? Wild logic man, I'm sure you're doing just fine lol
---
It’s just a rune longsword why are you so excited?
---
&gt;something that has been HEAVILY criticized for SO LONG
---
People who share and buy their accounts tend to bitch at Jagex when their account gets recovered by the original creator or someone who has far more information than they ever should.  That is not criticism or the fault of Jagex.  That's people who got burned by their own stupidity whining.
---
you’re too forced
---
Looking at you like 'why is this retard taking a picture of hia phone with a phone'
---
&gt; WoW gold is far more useless than RS gold. The only thing you get by having a lot of it is BoE mounts and endless consumables you can easily get anyway. Guess you can buy carries too but at that point you may as well let someone else play the game for you.
---
I mean its not, but ok. The only reason why WoW gold is more useless NOW is because Blizzard introduced tokens, but that wasnt the case for the majority of WoW and gold buying was just as big if not bigger during the prime years of WoW as it is with RS.
---
&gt; Jagex has proven several times recovery requests get looked over fairly fast. The ironman that claimed to have gotten his account hijacked the other day literally recovered it like less than 24 hours after he posted about it being hacked, albeit after it was cleaned. I don't know if you've used Blizzard support tickets in a while but they literally take a whole day at best, and several at worst. If it's taking you a lot of time to recover your account it's probably not "your" account as you're not providing solid information or the info you do provide Jagex has marked as compromised.
---
So youre using the most popular reddit posts where someone HAD to make a fucking reddit post and it get upvoted for anything to happen, and happen quick? I mean seriously how can you be THIS dumb?
---
I mean Im just done, theres no point even if trying to shove the truth down your throat anymore, theres far too much Jagex cock already in there.
---
ANYONE who has played both games or is at least anywhere of both Blizzard and Jagex's account security and customer support systems knows that Blizzard's systems has been FAR more effective and has had FAR LESS issues. Theres mountains of evidence out there and evidence in just how the systems work in themselves to prove that, if you want to keep believing Jagex's system is perfectly fine and even go as far to try and say something as crazy as it being just as good as Blizzard's be my guest you can live in your own little delusional world.

---
&gt; You literally cannot provide me actual evidence where someone who is a legitimate sole owner of an account has had trouble recovering it. In part due to the fact you're fucking brain damaged and don't understand what evidence actually is.
---
No the difference is im not going to waste my time going and linking hundreds of threads where people struggle to with account security or recovering their accounts dating back for years and years because its a completely pointless endeavor since youll just say "theyre lying, ALL of these people arent actually the original owners" or I dunno some other delusional shit where you make up excuses for Jagex having notoriously poor customer support.
---
The mere fact youre calling someone else brain damaged when youve been arguing for a company whose BIGGEST criticism has always been their customer support and account security is actually some next level shit, may god have mercy on your brain.
---
I put one vote on either side when I put in on the wall so people would start contributing

&gt;	I eventually got it back by recovering my old email but it took like a week.
---
I eventually got it back implies you now have ownership of your account, which was not the case from your first comment in which you state “I can’t even recover my own account”. 
---
Again, I can’t = I cannot = implies present tense as in this is still an active issue and you still do not have access to your account. But your latter comment of “I eventually got it back” directly contradicts your first comment. 
---
This sounds like a personal issue, has nothing to do with Jagex. But you’re posting in a thread relating to people bitching about Jagex fucking up about how **your** problems are suddenly the companies fault. You lost your email password, you lost the phone number tied to your email password, you were able to get your email password reset. None of that says Jagex. Therefore you’re just stirring the pot. 
---
You even said it, you’ve moved countries, you stopped playing for years at a time and you expected to recover an account based solely on 3-4 questions that anyone can find out and nothing else? That doesnt sound sus to you? That sounds like a theft attempt and I applaud Jagex for denying your request and requiring you to take further actions to get your account back; *that* proves ownership. Not knowing your pets name. I bet you have your pets name on your Facebook profile with a plate of your favorite food. The recovery questions are supplemental, because of how trivial they can be. That’s why they want tons more info like ISPs you’ve used, cities you’ve logged in from, bank transaction receipts potentially. 
---
You’re a dolt, go pk some spades
---
So you're saying that a large group/conglomerate can't pool resources in order to manipulate the economy?
---
Because that's just not true. You're just wrong. 
---
Only if you're negligent.
---
Ironmen do as they want to stockpile qll their food at once I guess. And 70 cooking is needed for recipe for disaster
---
I'd get rigour immediately with ur 100m or maybe earn another 20m then get it. Eitherway get it very soon.
---
Well you could just train prayer to 43 at bone yard 
---
Yes, true buddy!
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
So you want more agility gear besides graceful? Nty.
---
Also, agility is fine as it is now.
---
I was counting prayer as combat experience in my assumption seeing as it levels combat
---
\~800m
---
What are you on about? OP clearly demonstrates the true rate is 1/80
---
Seren godbook would be lit tbh
---
They can't restore HCIMs on the high scores sadly. When they did the rollback after the twisted bow bug, dead HCs got their in game status back. But they remain crossed out on the high scores.
---
I started when I hit 70 range. It’s the best strategy. Go grind out range at crabs and you’re set. I’m 62/62/62 on other combat stats. Run black d hides, blessed boots/coif, rune cbow, fire shield, amulet of fury if possible, ruby bolts until half health then diamond switch. Use range pots, prayer pots, food. I stand in melee range with protect from melee on to lessen his number of magical attacks. I average 3-4 kills a trip. I’d be happy to run some with you once you get range up a bit, my friends are weird about the wilderness so I’m usually soloing it.
---
I’ve heard you can do it at 60 range but I think that may be miserable. 
---
lol funny story this reminds me of, had a similar situation of sorts where one of my friends' friends dropped his 10 t bows he had amassed over the last year and a bit for jokes (which obviously isn't jokes...) but anyways, my friend decided to go to his house to smash his windows for revenge and the guy knocked him out without a baseball hat. I think he was hospitalized for close to half a year with minor hemorrhage damage. Couldn't even sue because he was the aggressor by invading the guy's property.
---
lose-lose for trying to get people back man
---
The only reason you would ever to make a Reddit post whining is because you failed to recover your account.  The reason you failed to recover your account is because you didn't have the amount of information that the original creator should have.  Stop complaining about Reddit when Jagex provides a perfectly functioning recovery system independent of it.  You can pretend it doesn't work as much as you like but that doesn't change the fact it's there.  People post on Reddit because THEY fucked up.
---
As for the WoW token shit I forgot about that.  It's not like Blizzard can't revoke whatever was purchased with stolen gold.  Jagex bans accounts that steal gold as well.
---
Yeah no thanks
---
The amount of people getting accounts hijacked is probably being overblown due to it being posted on reddit/twitter, it gaining traction and getting to the front page.  Buying gold from some website obviously increases your chances of you account being hijacked.
---
I keep my pet rock there. 
---
It's weird how he moves in between home teleports

well I'm hoping I don't get one again. It took foreverrr to do my task

Rift Guardian good

I feel like a noob now getting rocky at 65!

It really do be like this. 
---
This comment was made by the F2P HCIM Gang
---
Me at kbd
---
This has similar vibe to gnome delivery, I like it.
---
Jesus christ, its like you literally didnt even read any post I made and just decided to create your own narrative about what you think you read.
---
&gt; you should stop addressing everyone as "idiots"
---
I was literally making a point about people who buy their accounts NOT being idiots after SOME ONE ELSE referred to them as being idiots for doing so and I said they might actually have lives and not have the time/want to play the game if they have to do the endless grind to do the things they actually want to do.
---
I mean wow, your reading comprehension is literally that of an idiot. There ya go, NOW I called someone an idiot.
---
Get 75 magic and Zulrah opens up for you.  
---
That being said, at your level you really don't need much gold. Full guthans, fury/glory, barrows gloves, dragon boots, black mask/slayer helm, warrior/berserker ring, whip, dragon defender, full black d'hide, snakeskin boots, a magic shortbow (i), and some rune arrows will get you through all your slayer tasks til your stats are higher, and if you continue to farm slayer for higher combat stats then much, much better methods of making money open up to you.
---
For comparison... Zulrah with 75 mage + your stats would probably cap at around 2m/h if you're really really good at Zulrah (probably closer to 1m as a learner). With higher stats, you could get this up to 3 or 4 mil. With much higher stats, you could do Chambers of Xerics for 4-9m/h (depending on your team size and efficiency). With 90+ combats, 94 mage, 90+ range, and 77 prayer you could do Theater of Blood which would start at around 10m/h once you started getting consistent completions and cap around 20m+/h. When you look at it like that, trying to make money now you're going to be spending 500-1000% more time to make the same amount of money you could later on.
---
With that said... If you really need some money early on and slayer just isn't cutting it or not the kind of thing you want to grind, then get your hunter or RC up. Hunter I believe is the best skilling money method in the game (Catching red chins from 63-99 nets you around 70m in pure profit, and XP rates start at around 100k/h and cap at around 185k so it's fairly quick. Black chins from 73-99 profit around 120m and caps at around 200k+ xp/h but comes with the added risk of being in the wilderness... But the added benefit of being the best hunter XP in the game). Doing RC through the abyss can make 500k-1m/h, and altho it's slower than alternatives XP/h wise it may be worth during your lower levels to help you move towards that level 77 RC (Where you unlock Zeah RC, the only truely AFK rc xp in the game. If you did bloods from 77-90/souls 90-99, you'd make a nice 81m profit ontop of whatever you made getting RC to 77).

Talks about sara sword in title, talks about leaf bladed sword in post. K.

SS wasn't even useful for 99str. Let alone after it. 
---
Why thank you 😊 little DBM II on my way to work
---
This is me once the healers come out smh
---
Thanks to this thread I’ve learned that I bought my account. I don’t remember my first email or password from 12 years ago. Yikes. 
---
&gt;anything other than void at vorkath 
---
LUL
---
I guess my title was too short, oh well, Congrats Farming Brother.
---
No Authenticator Delay
---
Amazing,
---
MGTOW fellows. :)
---
I know I was joking
---
As he said, go to sand crabs and just grind it afk. It’s super boring and slow but worth it. Rock a shortbow and get a magic shortbow as soon as you can wield it. It just took a few days to hit it. Those last couple of levels are slooooow.
---
People that do that deserve to get their account stolen. I meant come on, what do you expect will happen with these sketchy sites? 
---
Thanks for informing me. I thought it was a little more legit sneaky than that lol
---
Lol so defensive out of nowhere, show us where the swampman touched you 
---
Nice cut and paste
---
Friggen Jomflix give him his acct bak
---
Ok retard. Buying an account and expecting it to be secure is the real brainlet power. Keep up being a sperg.
---
Let's keep the sigil streak going!
---
I still remember my first try. 
---
Cleared out the wave with no problem, just running low on food at the end. Down jad to half and manage to kill the healers one by one without messing a switch. Go back to Jad, confident of my victory and thinking it really wasn't a big deal after all.
---
MFW a second wave of healer spawned.
---
It's time to stop
---
Why is he bastard because he didn’t share? He didn’t even know the people nor is he obligated to share.
---
You are the bastard &amp; asshole.
---
I'm only getting around 60 million in my calculations for a 50% chance of having at least 1 of every drop (tho I'm using the post konar drop table that removed a few items from raids 1 and changed purple chance). What was your method for calculating it, and did you do pre or post konar update?
---
I've tried it on an unrestricted world to practice after I failed my first attempt.
---
Still haven't beaten Jad. With max stats. Fuck my life.
---
While that is true he doesn’t have his status back. Soup showed off the exact same plugin a month ago and people lost their minds. Its a troll 
---
Blessed dhide is almost exclusively better than normal void unless you are max ranged with rigour. And elite void is only marginally better some of the time.
---
With toxic blowpipe, blessed dhide is almost always better. 
---
If you get a very good bgs or dwh spec elite is a little better. 
---
wow, a shine of light among these spastics
---
How did you find the boss from lunar diplomacy at Zulrah???
---
hi I'm new player, whats wrong with customer service?
---
quick follow up. jagex doesnt have authenticator removal delay, but your email should. remember that your EMAIL ACCOUNT can have 2fa as well as osrs account. have both. The email 2fa is arguably the most important piece of this shitty security puzzle because google (and friends) take their cyber security (more) seriously.
---
You're completely missing the point. It's not about some people losing accounts to buying them or their own stupidity. It's that people on this subreddit just automatically assume that everybody who can't recover their hacked or lost account either bought it or handed all of their information out on a silver platter. The mindset is immediately guilty, and it's ridiculous. The point he and many others are making is that the account recovery system, and Jagex support as a whole, is and always has been horrendous compared to almost any MMO near the size of Runescape. And because of that, it's quite clear that many innocent people are going to have their account recoveries denied for a variety of reasons. And people come to this subreddit, or the Jagex twitter, as last resorts because their web-support is awful. And they are immediately blasted with people screeching at them that they're *clearly* an account buyer, or that they *had to* have shared accounts with someone before. It's the mentality of people reading these posts that is insane.
---
It literally has nothing to do with whether or not somebody did in fact buy their account or account share and get burned. It's the fact that the automatic response from half of this subreddit is to immediately blame them for doing that whether they actually did it or not.
---
No. My bank is worth 1.4b without hiding my name. I’ve even been on threads and called anyone to try and hack me. As I’ve said time and time again, if you didn’t sell your info/ get phished, there is no way anyone is going to brute force into your account. 2FA furthers this protection by having a random generated 6 digit number only available to the owner that changes every 30 seconds.  Hiding your username is useless. At those standards, you should never log on because anyone you walk by would see your name and be able to hack you. Big lawls to those gents.
---
Just so you know, everything on a network is visible, mobile included if you are using company WiFi. I can see the people on our network playing Runescape at work but what am I going to do, tell them I am essentially spying on them? I have better things to do with my time than play IT Police Man. If I wanted to it would be simple to get their passwords and hijack their accounts, but so is blocking the application or port.
---
There was an idiot that posted here about a month ago bragging about how he plays Runescape at work. He posted a picture with his personal info, phone number, company name, sticky note password and names of clients fully visible on the second screen. 
---
I thought you can be reinstated and the scores still dont change
---
Boaty only uses the default client so itd have to be OBS overlay
---
&gt; People who share and buy their accounts tend to bitch at Jagex when their account gets recovered by the original creator or someone who has far more information than they ever should. 
---
Yeah, youre right EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the history of RS who has ever complained since '05 about having trouble recovering their account whether they just forgot information or were hacked were actually lying and they werent the original owner.
---
Jesus christ I cant handle this level of stupidity anymore, see ya.
---
I guess I could have been a little clearer, but honestly I am probably not the best person to design rewards.
---
Some things I could think of off the top of my head would be weight reducing clothing, an item similar to a holy wrench, but for energy, a walking stick to assist with agility shortcuts ect... 
---
While I disagree with your opinion on agility being fine as is I respect your opinion and appreciate you reading my suggestion. You have my upvote.
---
He called me a bitch because I don't like what he likes, am i supposed to let him bend me over or something? Ivan and Victor lol, who knew Mexicans played OSRS. 
---
I enjoy cashing in my stacks of ranarrs, but that's about it
---
Bruh I use my mouth to talk I ain’t no eye-talian
---
It seems like most of the time when people get their accounts stolen, it's due to the hijacker having their password and access to the linked email. I thought authenticator was meant to help with that, but in this situation where it's needed more than at any other time it can be removed immediately. Can you offer something else that could keep a hijacker with the password and access to the recovery email out?
---
idk man, if power in Venezuela goes out again we'll lose the support team
---
heck
---
I just fairy ring to that one, start at the GE and go from there.
---
Do you live in Michigan? 
---
I tried it with ACB before I got DHCB and it was slower kills than blowpipe but much longer trips because of way less damage taken, I'd give it a try if I were you because it's much more chill
---
shady idiots actually. it hurts seeing jagex being punished on this community cause players can't stop being fucking retarded
---
True working on that method on myself normal iron man best way for ess on 10th is mining it and abyss would be hard
---
Because if he goes in there and "helps" kill then the polite thing to do is share the loot since he didn't he's a bastard... Are you him? 
---
what?
---
That's not why they do it. They Barb fish so they don't even get food out of it.
---
If you have a bank pin and dont leak it ur fine. If someone is getting hacked and losing bank they fucked up 99% of the time. Anytime I've recovered my account it's taken hours, they should never have 3 days to disable a pin and clean ur bank.
---
Barrows is not endgame lmao
---
Yep. They have fucked up with false bans the number of which you can probably count on your fingers but they unbanned the people and have improved greatly since then.
---
well, considering a tbow drop is worth ~600-700 USD its not a terrible mindset to have when you have double to 5x that in osrs bank. 
---
a 5b bank is 3k USD. thats not a small amount of money
---
Thank you, I do honestly like some of the suggested names more than my own. I appreciate your feedback.
---
Over 2000 hours to acquire all the uniques is pretty fucking ridiculous when you compare it to pre-raids content, GWD, DKS, barrows, etc. Raids rewards are too rare. This new super mega rare rng item trend is pretty dumb. Probably catering towards streamers just to give them more junk to stream.
---
Looks like someone’s thigh lol
---
Yup, I do a lot of grinding while watching TV with my partner. It's a great time to do things like agility that don't really take any thought, just clicking.
---
True I'd need to do lost city for cosmic sense take ages to buy cause of bots
---
For greater demons, use the annakarl teleport tab, and kill them there. Only bring monk top, monk robe bottom, and your weapon (in not sure if you lose your slayer helm that far or in the wild),and camp there with protect from melee. The site will restore your prayer close to, is not more than it drains, and you won't lose anything if you die.
---
Longer trips? 6 kills a trip? And did you use your house pool inbetween kills for prayer?
---
Why is this marked as humor? This is true
---
Turns out he is just as crazy and just as stupid as she is. They're made for each other tbh
---
and to remove authenticator, you need to open a link in your email. So if your email is protected, your old account is safe as well. 
---
Brobdingnagian if veracious
---
I see your point, I changed the bonus between +1, +2, and +3 many times when making this. Maybe +2 would be better, I figured +1 would be dead content. I was looking for feedback on the book more than the equipment, because colours and whatnot can be easily changed. Maybe it could give slightly negative offensive bonuses, and also give a slightly increased prayer bonus, or higher defense bonuses than the Sara book?
---
Hijacking top comment for the vorkath pros out there; is it work bringing an imbued heart there for the massive mage defense boost or will those blue mage attacks hit me either way and I should just bring another food?

His hand turns from metal to flesh in frame 3.
---
Ah. Thank you, never mind then.
---
&gt;tfw a hacker knows more about you than you do. FeelsWeirdMan
---
Hm
---
Is there even a way to see what security questions you had without a recovery attempt?
---
Dude having your pin be 1234 is a lot different than not changing your password constantly and using randomly generated fucking strings. And even in the scenario you got your account compromised cause your pin was 1234 do you think your banks response would be "tHaTs YoUr FaULt ByE!" Like ya you're an idiot but it's ridiculous to dismiss it as your fault and not help. 
---
And I'm aware there's a lot of money in this game and that's why there's so many hackers. And I'm aware account security matters, my Reddit username isn't even the same as my rs username. However we can agree that's not normal. Most people playing this game probably don't even realize how targeted it is. So it's kind of hard to say it's their "fault" when to them they are just playing a video game. They don't realize they need to lock down their account like some kind of billion dollar vault.
---
That is nothing short of a perfect 10.
---
Me: Logs in on mobile and takes phone with me to the shitter
---
No xp waste
---
If they recover your account using leaked info jagex just changes the account email to theirs. 
---
That's a chad move
---
Agreed, we were chilling on discord and he asked about the stray dog following him while I was training watching his gains, and I look away and he's like
---
"What about Rocky?"
---
I was like huh? Lmao 
---
What the fuck LOL
---
authenticators dont even protect itself
---
Why in gods name dont you need auth to access account settings.
---
Holy shit jagex. What the fuck are you thinking

I wish we could do this on rs3, but skull bugs are so rampant with a jmod in bed with the pking community in charge of fixing them. Remember how things went down with the osrs mod in bed with pkers? 
---
Crystal will probably be worse XP overall, not to mention the time requirement to obtain
---
I got killed by a damn range pure trying to eat while running and then chunk loaded. Needless to say, it didnt eat and I lost my hc status lol.
---
Wilderness only hcim is a bitch. But I'll keep trying I guess lol
---
Then theres generally a way to recover the auth with previous info.
---
Blizzard uses auth with great success, even before smartphones were so widespread. Because you cant fucking remove the authenticator without having the authenticator, or a serial# tied to the auth
---
LOL "grinding" favor in 2019. They nerfed the effort required to get favor like three times. It's a joke now.
---
Literally nothing would change except people would complain about jagex rigging polls when they continue to pass lol but nice meme i guess

This is the only thing I want from os I’m very jealous 
---
What do you even mean?
---
Hit stuff...
---
I totally agree with your sentiment. We should have a dedicated weekly/monthly thread for collecting suggestions, or at least some kind of official suggestion submission system. The q&amp;a definitely needs to move away from answering specific player suggestions and toward discussing the direction/state of the game
---
Yeah the problem is no other company let's you recover an account like that. Jagex thinks there's 0 problems with their system and that's why so many people want some sort of solution. 
---

the exp is only marginally faster in the amount of time that you'll be mining to 99. idk man, I tried mining 3t granite, blast mining, and mlm on my way to 99 and from all that experimenting mlm just was just a way more enjoyable experience. It's not mind crushingly slow, and it makes it far less annoying to train. someone might *want* fast, but seriously unless you are on stims or autistic you will burn out
---
Yahgex pls
---
Couple things come to mind, securing your email is up to you. Gmail helps as they have additional security features.
---
Creating an email only used for your osrs account
---
2FA on your email
---
Complex password 
---
A handy tip is to check sites like haveibeenpwnd. Scans database leaks and tells you if your email got caught up in one.
---
I visit the GE often and report bots whenever I'm there, it doesn't take that much time, if I was a pmod I would feel like a god every time I went there I had the ability to shut up those annoying dice bots

This change actually affects a lot of players as those bursting dust devils will have to bank elsewhere rather than use the shortcut. 
---
&gt; **Poll Question #2**
---
&gt; If the Hosidius Rework passes, should we add a Hosidius Dungeon as described in the blog? Please note that should this pass, it will arrive in game at a later time than the overall rework.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; Those of you who read the original blog may remember a unique dungeon that was pitched for the Hosidius House. The design is still a work in progress and can be expected to be revisted at a later date. In the meantime, it has been removed from this poll blog and won't be polled until we are more confident in committing to this piece of content.
---
Let's not poll something first and then present the content later. 
---
Otherwise this is great!
---
Just dont type lmao
---
Doesn't even make sense
---
Did a crab write that? jesus.. :D
---
Definitely not a Leap. I have one and mine looks a bit different. 
---
I honestly don't mind it too much, but I wish you could do it in shorter stints than 100 seeds, or that you got more points per game. 
---
Nice! I managed with 3hp, venomed. Thankfully I had house teles.
---
Let's make it a teak tree
---
Christ I'd insult you but fuck, dont think I can hurt you any more than yourself
---
Left click on birdhouse spots? Why? It's so ridiculously easy and profitable as it is. What's this aversion to double clicks/right clicks? I know mobile exists, but make those changes mobile specific and stop morphing the game around mobile (spec orb, etc.).
---
A little bit of a bad analogy because it’s a known best practice to change your password every 90 days and not reuse passwords. If you’re seriously comparing being too lazy to change your password to being raped you’re a lost cause. 
---
Idk why are you taking my words out of context. I said that you can protect yourself from password leaks, and you're ranting about all these things that are wrong with the security system. 
---
The things I mentioned are something that you should do on any account that is any valuable. 
---
That's all I said, I was asked how can you protect yourself from data leaks, and I gave an answer. 
---
And it's no victim blaming, you want to be safe? Just do that. There are bad people in this world and you need to protect yourself from them, it's that simple. 
---
I mean I definitely can't disagree with these things. 2FA on your email will save you from a database leak. I'd still hardly say the player is at "fault" though is the thing. Like it's not common sense you need to put up such a blockade for a gaming account. 
---
you're\*
---
How many hours?
---
I mean it failed the polls previously so people clearly didn't want it. They are choosing to not repoll it though because they don't want it to potentially pass which is the problem
---
You know... my dumb ass never thought to take a boat to ardy. That level 70 wolf on white wolf mountain was so scary at low levels.

Honestly you're not gonna spend mils learning zulrah. All your gear is recoverable so you'll lose scales, runes, food/pots. By 50 attempts (at the most) you should be getting much more comfortable. 
---
Yup, I found out when I was installing my new phone, I logged in on RuneScape and I could access all my settings without authenticator 
---
Damn, Jagex needs to hire more staff

Some random dude spamming.
---
This is dependent on whether you're running a manufacturer version of Android or pure Android. A lot of manufacturers still block this.
---
Yeah that may be true, but if your account is recovered what else would you expect them to do? Not let the person who recovered the account log in?
---
You can't make them. You buy them from either GE or from "Nardok's Bone Weapons." 
---
Yeah I realised it didn't after I read it again lol, ah well

One bullshit story and everyone is giving the OP shit with no proof. My account of 6 years got hacked and it took months for Jagex to verify I was the original owner. This was pre-eoc however Jagex runs into these fucking issues all the time, with reliable customer support there wouldn’t be reddit posts at all. Manual verification everytime something like this happens where the actual owner can be identified in minutes. I lost access to my LoL account and tried recovering it a few weeks ago. I was chatting with a person who verified me and got me set up within minutes. Jagex has given me a million issues whereas I’ve never had the same problems with any other game.
---
You people are acting as if Jagex is perfect, whereas we see their colossal fuckups weekly. The guy has had no interaction with a human being, which is the point he wants to get to. How do you expect a shitty automatic recovery system to go perfectly?
---
Oh gotcha. I would've been really sad cuz I had to literally clear out my bank just to get bludgeon lmao. 
---
Well when the US and other NATO allies literally stop trillions of dollars worth of wealth from re-entering the country, then yeah.

On my first kill, zulrah killed me with his final hit as he died.

What's your teacher's username? I'll say I'm you. I've got a good account so can kick his ass.

Show me where Jagex said they didn't intend it to be that way 
---
Shit I know where you can get a whole house for 5k.  I can't guarantee you will live through the night though.

What do you mean?

Then you get to play the game.

I got mine at 72 farming 😭😭 I’m so sorry

I'm 25 and still do this, dclaw, and barrage my irl friends.

I play only on mobile i don't even know how to do that stuff

Ok?

It's still pretty quick even as an ironmon. Mostly afk and then you go buy compost at a farmer.
---
Learn that “double XP weekend” is not a thing 
---
What if you forget your bank pin and have to reset it and you have to wait a few days for that then what? You’re stuck with an inventory of items and cant play the game. 
---
What? No it wouldn’t lol
---
+4 accuracy and +3 melee str bonus over abyssal tentacle is something not worth over 50m
---
Cuz 12 districts in the Hunger Games duh
---
Never even heard of double xp weekend so I know that not a thing n I'm about to just create a new one
---
That's just wrong. There was a guy a while back who got falsely recovered despite playing regularly on the account. He lost like 5b or some shit iirc. 
---
Whats your gear set up for hydra mate?

I mean you can ignore the rest of the sentence if you want I guess....I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Probably because a normal UIM is just a regular account that chooses to waste a lot of time. Morytania lock is not a fake challenge.
---
Create a Morytania only Ultimate Ironman and train it up so you can join Swampletic's Theatre of Blood team.
---
Most people who get hacked compromised their own account at some point, if the hacker got through two sets of 2FA and a pin. Or they bight the account. People won't admit their own faults though.

arma, book of law, dhcb+ruby dragon/dragon dragon bolts I use bp w/ addy darts for the last phase+spec then to heal, with rigour. \~2min average kills.
---
I didn't know he played Runescape.
---
your 2fa code and password does that :)
---
Fun times. 
---
It was one person spamming, pretty sure they’re shadow banned. Looked it up on removeddit and it wasn’t that interesting 
---
DHCB will always be better for 4 reasons:
---
1. Ruby (e) bolts hit 100s and speed up kills/hr
---
2. Using DHCB means Vorkath can only hit you with 2 attacks, 1 of which is always prayed against. If using melee, he can hit you with 2/3 attacks since you have to be in melee range.
---
3. +95 ranged ranged accuracy and 122 ranged strength with DHCB/DF Ward/ Dragon bolts vs. +85 melee accuracy and 77 melee strength with Lance/DFS. Even with attack speed being slower with the DHCB, the accuracy/damage is much higher.
---
4. (Elite) Void ranged is a 12.5% bonus to ranged damage and accuracy vs. melee's 10%. 
---
&gt;That's a lot of assumptions lol, and to reply to the first part of your comment, if I gave you a 10 oz gold bar irl, would that mean nothing because it's not a currency? Everything is worth what a purchaser will pay for it. 
---
If I had a pair of socks that got a big hole in them, I would throw them away. Somewhere out there, there's a dude with a weird fetish who would pay 20 bucks for them. That doesn't magically make me feel like im throwing $20 away.
---
You should be concerned that your account is hacked because you effectively lost time and accomplishment over it, not because you lost actual money.
---
What if you just don't sign up for double xp weekend and then you wouldn't have to worry about your account getting hacked? Seems like that would be even easier to code.
---

I am ecstatic that you are reworking the original Zeah map layout. Everything felt forced, unnatural, and empty and was my biggest complaint to OSRS

Damn sorry to hear, i lagged on like wave 42 or something mid prayer switch and got blasted. It happened on my first and only attempt and im quite disheartened, my internet is such trash.
---
Yeah because he's so accurate it really doesn't matter. And if you use an imbued heart you have to take 1 less food.
---
Another aspect is that usually I end trips with 0 pots and a full inv of drops, so taking the imbued heart would mean 1 more piece of loot you'd have to leave behind.
---
it wouldn’t show a logo but it would feature a picture created by Jagex. But i think its broad enough where i should be ok if this is the case

Me. Haven’t really played for a couple of months now but yeah I still can’t get it.

Wow this looks fantastic.
---
The chance of getting only 1 item in 80 chests (assuming you kill all 6 each time) is ~3.9%. while that's pretty bad, it happens. (16/17)^79 (1/17) x (80)
---
So your advice for people who are unjustly banned is what? You can only contact support through the ticket system but you can't use the ticket system for ban appeals? Surely you see the evident failure in the system here.
---
Thats an awesome way of putting it, i enjoyed that.
---
Wasn't him, mate.
---
He does not play at all, however he has friends that do farm gp. One of whom was formerly an "engineer" as he describes. 
---
Hyuk hyuk!
---
Definitely, but this isn't skill-based. You can do it blindfolded if you're good enough at remembering and clicking correct spots.  
---
Skill-based randomness is like the inferno. Sure, the spawns each wave are random, but the choices you make in where to stand, which ones to safespot, which ones to kill first, that's what makes it skill-based.
---
Can this be addressed please, why would we vote on something with no details of it.
---
Best way to keep from getting hacked is to be bad at the game and have no money/good gear (⌐■_■) 
---
This is some dead content I wouldn't mind seeing get a refresh
---
Hey so I asked this question a couple of years ago and the mods on the couch were all for it from my understanding.
---
Can temple trekking followers be changed from what they are to what they later were in RS2. Currently the followers are static, bland, and do not progress in abilities. Near the end of RS2 the followers were changed to have a leveling system which went from 1-99 and they actively became better followers which made the minigame even more exciting to do.
---
With the popularity of Swampletics, I feel a nice revamp of the followers could be a nice touch!
---
I totally feel it! But like I had said, most of the pain was legit just because it was a death that was 100% out of my control. Not even like.. bad RNG or something. Just.. Living in Korea and ocean is big. :( It hurts on a deep level, but we'll get there. 
---
Like I had said, I got to wave 56 with plenty of supplies left and was feeling myself entirely. Wave came up, went to stack the mobs, and just kept lagging out in-between clicks. Absolutely nothing I could do. :-\ Just sucked a lot, made me pretty sad.
---
Everything must be slayer 
---
Seers village hard bruh. 
---
I think he means UIM being rather an incovenience and a struggle than a “real challenge”.  
---
Isn't that Kandarin?
---
I wonder what item spawn we will get this time 
---
Don’t Pk and Reddit, kids.
---
To add to your comment its not ardy but kandarin hard
---
It's not *always* like that; not at all! But it just happened to me at the time I absolutely most needed it not to. The sad part is, unless they open Asia servers or something, there's nothing we can do to beat the ping of the Pacific Ocean, continental United States, and then the Atlantic, all the way to the servers. :(
---
Didn't they remove like 200 infernal capes at one point when there were only like a couple k in the game?
---
Could've sworn I saw a reply to this...
---
I'll only mention this. Not a straight answer of do it or don't.
---
When Jagex refunded those players that got hacked due to a mod situation a while back. Most of them rwt, simply because they had already gone through the pain (I'm not memeing..) and probably had the thought 'i should have just sold it' and then Jagex gave their banks back... And some of them did sell it.
---
I personally have sold accounts and gp, I know many people who have sold gp... They all have better pcs than me now. Some continue playing with that 'bare minimum go to raids' or whatever. And some quit like me.
---
Kept pausing to see if the text on the other monitor was a 🦀🦀🦀

I could give you my rsn and password right now and you wouldnt get shit, i have a bank pin and log out at the bank with no gear equipped, good luck to the hackers.
---

---
thank u good sir
---
Do you not have a problem with 90% of osrs content then?
---
Not really, because of game rules that prohibit player-run banking for example. Although "buying gf" is peak ancap.
---
ook ook! thank u

oooops. thx

I work for a small (less than 10) insurance company and my boss isn't the greatest with technology. I close out of teamviewer when i start my computer up and not one word has been said. There is no "IT Team" at my work and i try to have the client in the background doing afk activities such as bloods rcing or Redwoods. The client is only up on my screen when i am banking/dropping stuff &amp; my work gets done on time so I do not anticipate any backlash.

I suppose it does help that I took over for an incompetent employee and now I'm viewed as a hard worker even though I'm half-assing everything.

I really like Gmail's 2FA, as it'll only ask once per device and won't ask again. Security without the annoyance. But I do agree it sucks we gotta take extra precautions to secure the account.

This isn't really necessary for the casual player, but if you post your account showing vast wealth - your gonna be targeted by many people
---
say goodbye to bulletproof account when half these idiots can't keep their mouth shut about their personal details though
---
Ya in a professional field man. It's supposed to just be a gaming account. I've never had to update passwords on my gaming accounts every 90 days to protect them like this. If you want max security you're right it's a necessity, but I'm just saying it's not the players fault if they don't do it. I think you have every right to be a bitch if you get it stolen after setting up a 2FA, bank pin, and complex password but you just don't update it every 90 days. You shouldn't need to do more than that. Ffs most game clients don't require you do more than even a complex password. How do you expect players who don't browse Reddit to start RuneScape thinking "alright, how do I lock down my account like it has the nuclear codes behind it".
---
Change password occasionally?
---
Seems like maybe Jagex should let us know if someone has our password but gets stopped by 2-step.
---
(I've suggested login notifying.. people disagree with me)

Nah man, Konar is pretty trash gp and xp before 95 then it's just trash xp

"Wow, that’s a really robust analogy, comparing rape victims to carjacking victims and mugging victims.

If I live in detroit and park my car in an abandoned parking lot next to drug runner alley, and I leave it there for three weeks and it gets stolen, I can rest assured knowing that there is **nothing** that I could have done to change that outcome.
---
If I drunkenly stumble into a classmates house-party with a couple 20s peeking out of my front pocket and a couple 50s peeking out of my  back, and someone jacks that money from me, guess what? Zero percent my responsibility."
---
I use authenticator but seriously how the fuck is it my fault if i get hacked and wasnt using one. Isnt it runescapes fault for having shitty security and allowing their databases to be breached
---
Do not flex rc per at me PLEASE.

No problem lad. Just didn’t want someone grinding out ard hards and then being disappointed 
---
Catacomb days are all melee.

The reason it doesn't work well is because some of them are bigger, and larger targets mess up bursting a lot.

Lol no. This is literally not a thing that happens. Maybe you can find one or two anecdotal (and probably fake) stories about some girl from tumblr trying to pull something like this but I can assure you that this is not something that ever happens, nor is this something feminists support, despite whatever bullshit you probably heard from some SJW cringe compilation video from 2015.
---
I am not sure if the beta world has all diaries done, so that may have been it! On my acc I have all Hards done (besides Kourend cuz fk favor)
---
Imagine actually typing in any twitch chat
---
Nah. Plus why would they “warn” you instead of just banning you if they really thought you were involved in that in the first place? 
---
You're absolutely right, and this is critical. Jagex has failed here catastrophically. They're far too concerned with continually pushing out more half-baked content than they are with fleshing out, refining, and expanding upon the content and features (including clerical features such as support and account security) that we already have. That's not to say that the a lot of the new content isn't based on good ideas, but players want a well-crafted gem - not a bloated turd.
---
Shave that nasty nose stash you look like a 14 year old 6 year old my god.

If you're actually interested, and not here for communism memes, I think it's closest to mutualism. That is a form of anarchism. It means that means of production are publicly owned, but the products of labour aren't. People can then sell the products of their labour freely on the market for their full value.

But we already have RuneLite! :D
---
Hey Gratz :) (fuck you)
---
&gt; Oh jeeze heres this fucking guy again.
---
Oh jeeze its another delusional Jagex dick rider who is clueless to what an actual competent customer support team and account security/recovery looks like from a game developer. 
---
&gt; You should have "most of these things" on all your online accounts. 
---
Of course? But they arent nearly as NECESSARY and NEEDED in maintaining account security as they are with Jagex and RS. Weird how Blizzard never had near as many issues when they had FAR more players and were setting records for an MMO. Could it be that it was because their system was far better than Jagex's? Even though thats blatantly obvious, you nerds who dick ride the shit out of Jagex something desperate cant realize this very simple fact.
---
&gt; Runescape accounts are highly sought after, thus are constantly being pursued by hackers. 
---
Lol, yeah because thats something that is supremely unique to RS. Because WoW accounts were traded/sold (and you cant even TRADE RS accounts because its not possible to even safely do like you could with WoW accounts because of Blizzard's system) and gold wasnt a HUGE RWT scene during its 6 or 7 year peak when it had millions of players, and a far bigger RWT market. You think there are a lot of RS gold farmers? Do you have any idea how much gold was sold in WoW?
---
The big difference is that hackers are WAY more successful when it comes to hacking RS accounts...its EASY to do. Why do you think it wasnt such a big problem in a player base that had MILLIONS of players? Because the system made it very hard to do the same things that happen with RS... I mean how can you not realize something so obvious?
---
&gt; just reading that first paragraph makes me glad I didn't invest any time reading literally any other of your responses, cuz you lack very basic common sense as to WHY osrs accounts are constantly looking to be attained.
---
Lol coming from the Jagex cock rider who has no clue what hes talking about and has so much blind bias and ignorance as to what the RWT scene looked like with WoW during its peak and consistently ignores the blatantly obvious fact that WoW didnt have the same issues RS has even when it had a player base around 10 MILLION because Blizzard did a FAR better job at not only securing their accounts but also recovering them and their customer support. I mean seriously how are you not getting this? Why is Jagex notorious for having these issues and dog shit customer support and a game that was 50x more successful and had 50x more players DIDNT have these same issues?
---
Keep being completely clueless and having this weird Stockholm syndrome type retarded disease where you blindly think Jagex's system is completely fine when theres a mountain of shit that proves it isnt. See ya retard.
---
I recovered my RS3 account after 7 some years and when I logged on I had a Santa had and 4 new 99s.

Trust me, I have inside information. RWT as much as you can without getting banned. Its only a matter of time before you get hacked. Could be years but it will happen eventually. SELL. SELL. SELL.

To be honest, it's probably because it's OP that Black Dhide Chaps don't require a defense level. Seems like an oversight from 15 years ago that never got changed. Don't need to buff something that's already OP, even if it's only a tiny buff.

Stealing an idea from other courier missions I've played, long distance runs can be fun if implemented correctly. Throw in some leveled highwaymen if you're carrying valuable goods, maybe throw up a few guards to block certain choke points like White Wolf mountain for "construction" to make people try alternate routes.

The extra kills per hour from bringing a couple pots more than pays for them. As far as doing a different boss that's up to your preference as long as you're happy with the profit.

I personally don’t think so but we work with a lot of classified information.

4:29? Wasnt that easy was it
---
Definitely not theatre. For chamber, definitely not in solos, maybe it can be brought in team raids but it’s a low priority item 
---
Who the heck would make a snelm bot?
---
hoohoohoo
---
I didnt even see it before i went to get my eternal crystal :(
---
I asked :)
---
It's worth it to stay. Also get rigour (if you don't already have) before dhcb. The DPS increase of rigour + blowpipe is more significant than just a dhcb.
---
Well that's just stupid, Seren is in OSRS and has nothing to do with eoc or whatever. RS3 has great lore as well.
---
Hotel, Trivago. 
---
Construction or gear for slayer :)
---
93 lol.
---
Whoa cool dude. You’ll have to show me the ropes. Add :: ohyeahyeah 
---
Ok got it. Thanks
---
stfu fag
---
I can’t remember the farming or herb requirement but you can easily get farming up each day by doing daily runs. Bonus experience if you grow your own herbs and make potions with them. 
---
If he can get at all lucky at tob I think he can finish out the rest of the grinds pretty quick. Been a super fun account to keep tabs on
---
Sounds like you've got some personal issues that need to be dealt with. Damn boi...
---
people will use them, watch punches or st0ney on youtube, they both use regen brace for the +1 str bonus but it adds 3m in risk.
---
Nh hybrids risk A LOT of gp for extra max hits. even i plan on using these for hybriding. 37-37 dds spec with inferno cape and b ring is so worth it
---
Cat and a rock is all i need
---
your mom dropped in price
---
What do you even do for gp? Like half of the game is still locked for you with these stats .... 
---
You the guy the that told me i had the wrong boots on the other day?
---
You must really like nmz. If you dont get 78 herb and 55 farming you will need to leech of your team mates. If you don't have a clan then not many ffa will want to make all your pots for you. 
---
Obviously not for theatre and I don't do solos since I'm not an ironman. It may not be a high priority item but it's very worth bringing, especially if you're in max
---
you're wasting your real life time trying to get p2p when you could just do something for someone for a few hours and theyll give you $20 which you then spend on runescape card at the store or something
---
Why don't you play on your cassette player tho?
---
Zuhaar post with this little upvotes, 2 hours old? What is going on here?
---
$40 is 109 days at $11 per year 30 btw.
---
So even worse than you thought
---
I would watch it. 
---
Reminds me of a Zeah Only regular Ironman with the name UIM Swamp. He said he changed his mind after tutorial island
---
Order doesn't matter. Just get as close as you can go 88.0% without going over. 6 brothers + 2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm will get you to 86.4% iirc
---
I usually ended up just using pots. I got it down pat to where I won’t eat a lot of food during kills but the food helps with extra kills. I think my average kills an hour was 20.  
---
It’s perfect
---
God yes. That song is awful
---
To
---
Ahh that explains it... I'm only at 73.
---
What are you talkin about mole is a boss
---
No, you can kill them anytime during the run
---
It’s funny cuz u actually believe that
---
&gt; How is a Latin American country going to become a 'paradise' like the US exactly
---
Not be socialist for a start, duh
---
&gt;but thats... the whole point of them.
---
This is a nonsensical statement. 
---
I never said nobody will use them. I was watching quatarr high risk brid with rangers + acb today. My point is that it's not really going to change the PvP meta for most people. I nh brid all the time and I'm not really concerned about another max hit for a 30m+ item.
---
Quack
---
Rush stronghold
---
V
---
you have the wrong boots on bro
---
But why does anyone buy the amulets? 
---
Sit
---
It's in NZD, so over here it's close to $15 for a month. Either way I'm overpaying by a pretty large amount.
---
powerless against a pvp clan
---
 "I doubt the Spiked Manacles &amp; Fremennik kit will be used in PvP"
---
Firemaking probably
---
Nope it's 50/50 
---
You either get a drop or you don't 
---
Simple stats man 
---
I'm autistic, go fuck yourself. I'll call whatever I want whatever I want. 
---
Lot of turnover recently
---
The problem is getting it up to 77, I've been trying to get it up but after 10 mins of ZMI i want to kill myself
---
I like this so much better. The current Hosidius has always looked way too boxy to me, this looks way more natural. 
---
Fuck off.
---
Yes it's getting the cape legit. It's just easier than not using them. When you drop pots you still have to avoid clicking them, for example.
---
Yeah but he's asking a question
---
The lance is underwhelming if anything 
---
Keep 3 of each torch and glove, you will get better rewards after since they roll magic/torstol seeds after 3
---
That'd be awesome. Cosmetics for how far in you last.
---
Tithe farm changes need to be reworked. 
---
* The wiki states that 25 is the most plantable. It's more intense, but I'm sure some people like that.
---
* One of the ways of doing 25 plots is with 3 rows. This update only has two rows.
---
* Tithe farm is not player instanced, it's group instanced. With this change, it needs to be instanced to the player. There's nothing you can do about getting crashed there except move on (and it has happened to me).
---
Its a shame they literally give 0 fucks about LMS anymore. Time after time they said they would work on it/rejuvenate it but nothing has been done for a long time now. This is something I dont like about the game atm. They always want to release new content but with content that is buried in the ground they leave it to rot. 
---
That's only because people compare it to blowpipe and tbow, which are completely overpowered.
---
Now I want a small hydra to cuddle 
---

he clearly doesnt know in his post

yea we dont need a new skill either

So have I. If it was your first main account, you should remember that shit.
---
Is this the face you made when the mean kids hacked your account in the library?
---
His username is i dont shower in dutch so you smelled more than bs there
---
i can see how you would feel that way seeing as you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
You type like an autistic kid with brain damage. 
---
Hyon hyon hyon!
---
Thanks! Wish it wasnt so expensive ha
---
yes thats 3 out of all the people pking
---
Har har
---
You are a scholar. I do have oysters in the first spot in a bank tab. Thank you 
---
This is just anecdotal, but of everyone I've met with infernal, literally half of them bought cape. IMO, it's wishful thinking to think that bought infernals are few and far between.
---
Sauce? 
---
Oh boy here comes the skull trick
---
regen brace
---
Deep wildy pking
---
Oh really, I exchanged one torch for a supply create. But the loot was then the worst. So I kept the other ones. Thanks for the tip though :)
---
Classic plonker insult, I hope you have watched only fools and horses.. 
---
general in Hexis
---
Spot on champ!
---
Right, thank you for your application to the dumb ass virgin nerds on this sub for the ignore list, it has be accepted with flying colors.
---
Enjoy your stay.
---
But if a jmod hacks you with authenticator, it still your fault
---
Yeah I can see how this happens I ended up turning 300m into 4b then I ended up losing it all even tho I had more than enough on the game but it will teach me nothing good comes from gambling so ive decided to stop playing rs so I don’t stake again 
---
What I meant by that is, it won't really affect PvP as much as people think it will. Power creep is a real thing but I think introducing BiS gear with high risk &amp; clear weaknesses is a fine trade-off.
---
I just find the concept of a hat destroying someone humorous. My grammar/spelling on reddit is atrocious, no judgment here. 
---
I think there’s a subreddit for this
---
My gf has big boobies so I've tried to convince her to stream so I can quit my day job. OSRS pimping would be a bright future.
---
You feel like you’ve completed the game , get bored, get cleaned and start all over again
---
I've never seen such heinous looking arms
---
That’s what she said
---
ZMI is not hard to manage.  Once you have a good inventory and banking rhythm, you just follow people to the altar.
---
So much dopamine
---
This wasn’t about hacking. You’re missing the point.
---
That account was highly contested because I was a young dumb kid that gave his password to all his friends, I wasn’t surprised. My point was that the recovery system is automated and if you remember when your account was created and the original passwords to the account you will get it back.
---
Yeah pretty much but doubt I’ll start over again just simply can’t be bothered I only started playing again in my free time 
---
the lance is ridiculously OP
---
makes melee a viable alternative at vork
---
bis for raids1
---
makes steel/mith dragons fast enough to do for slayer points efficiently
---
huge buff at rune dragons
---
&gt;logs into osrs 
---
&gt;you just wasted 12 hours
---
No, my understanding is you get an appeal button when the ban comes in, you need to use that. They have separate systems for support tickets and bans. That's why they do not respond to appeals through the support tickets.
---
I keep my runes, cash and teleport tabs/jewellery to the top sorted, and then have subsections for different types of things. There's a potion subsection with a placeholder for each dose, a tool section for stuff like hammer and chisel and all that, a gear section with all the juicy stuff, loottab section, junk section, etc. Try to put stuff you use together often in one tab, or close to each other
---
I completely agree.  It's deception and manipulation on a MASSIVE scale.  Honestly giving someone a child when they don't want one is literally probably one of the worst things you can do to a person short of killing them.  It's the largest possible commitment that the average person can ever make in their entire lives, and someone trying to make that commitment for them should absolutely be illegal in as effective and as functional a way as it possibly can be.  Especially if there are other laws in place that force the unwilling party to pay child support no matter what.  That basically amounts to scamming a person out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  There's no way that should be acceptable under the law.
---
yes
---
You're right when it comes to entitled people who don't know how to take care of themselves, but for a regular person 5k can enable them to make some moves that'll improve their situation. I'm about to be moving from one first world country to another, and the 3k i saved up is going to help me get situated and set up. Of course 5k isn't enough to ride on your whole life, but for a resourceful young person it can go a really long way.

Mine is the GE music. I can't stand it.

What's with people ripping their headset off I'm pretty sure they'd still do it if it was wireless
