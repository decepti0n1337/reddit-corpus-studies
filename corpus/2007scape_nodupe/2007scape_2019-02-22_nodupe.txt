To be fair, not that these guys would know about it, but until FunOrb shut down, you were able to stuff an unmetered number of requests at the login servers without getting locked out.

The logical thing to do seems to check your attack style so you know what you're training 
---
Okay but they're not the same game, they have entirely different economies. If I were to trade steam items for OSRS cash, I'm sure people wouldn't think that's okay.
---
What contracts are you doing? I'm always doing the hard/ high tier ones

You couldn't before?

But like what the fuck is 3 bread is it 3 loaves 3 slices, 3 what??

Please note: this post is only for the lulz. I'm going to main OSRS soon as I finish questing in RS3
---
holy fuck this post is a work of art

It’s a common scam with new items. They won’t sell unless you remove the poison and then after that you will be lucky to get 90k each for them. Sorry bud.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with what he said.

Don't buy into people trying to make "retard" and "faggot" bad words. It makes you sound like mentally disabled old people who wince their buttholes when people say crap.

Imagine hating a whole group of the community that you wont let them get a targeted update every once in a while.

Anyway you could look into why my main of 3 years got perm banned for the same reason? Got a friend to log on my alt and send me 50m from it and you guys slapped me with a perm... working on a new account now, doubt I keep going though bc these quests got old the 2nd time when u made us male new accs with the rs3 shit just to re enjoy the game we had already spent years getting to where we were. Now I have to make a 3rd main? The system is ridiculous.cant count how many time I've been hit with false bans that "are not appealable" with no good customer service to even try and get an explanation except your system detected it...

Is it possible to simulate a first-person view using detached camera mode, or is it impossible to aim the camera up and down? I've wanted this for so long

thats because it is a serious problem you fucking melon

Fair point. And yea wholesome disagreements do seem to be more sparse on reddit, especially in this sub

I see. Thanks!

Who the fuck autocasts magic anywhere switching is required besides barrage slaying

&gt;Brute forcing doesn't mean random numbers, it means trying out a lot of common passwords
---
**That is categorically incorrect.**
---
Brute-forcing is trying every possible combination of characters until you get the right result. You are describing a cred-stuffing/dictionary attack.
---
When you switch to it, for some reason it takes forever to start auto casting, so it may actually not be worth it

Lol my dude, assuming i "hate" ironmen because I think the game shouldnt be catered around them is by far the biggest reach you could make. I could care less on your play preference. However its a simple fact. You chose to play the game that way under CURRENT mechanics. Expecting a change to suit a game mode that isnt the "main" play style is absolutely ignorant and arrogant. 
---
I'll just leave this here, but as already mentioned by others(including runelite devs) runelite cant solve ctc2 for you... what was done here was just the ingame model was changed visually to reflect the new model.
---
[removed]
---
To clarify a bit more - I'm def not going to be using bandos or statius armour or anything like that. I just want to use regular d hide, ahrims, and ags/gmaul switches. I have done some pking on regular worlds but I find that I get wrecked by people my combat level (\~100) when they know what they're doing. Practicing that way is going to be pretty costly. I also haven't finished alching to 94 mage, so I thought it would be good to get practice in between alching sessions. 
---

This is why games need decentralization—no need for questionable centralized figures to govern and take away our hard work with little to no legit reasoning.

Yeah, when is that coming?? Has it already been polled, and we're just waiting for the update? 
---
Then put a cap on how many u can use to prevent these builds from starting. It has been proposed this way. It needs to be approached carefully, but it should be able to be accomplished. Just because something is risky doesn't mean it should be completely avoided. Think about how risky space travel is and how much good can come from it.
---
Tons of other people have made literally the exact same suggestion for years, then Tractor suggests it and everyone sucks his dick for it. Maybe we could get him to suggest hiding poll results and they'll actually do it. 
---
It was hitting defense and attack in strength mode but talk more about what you dont understand
---
Hahahahhaha 
---
As far as I understood from Settleds video it doesn't just work. He's trying to make it consistent
---
Sorry but you are asking for top tier dps in the most dangerous hot spot in the wilderness to be less risk?
---
ah yes I forgot about the clan pking treaty of 2014, those pesky clans refusing to attack each other, what a shame

Don't forget using the remote desktop inside of an Oculus or Vive to play with a controller pointing at a screen like a laser pointer in order to click on a mobile emulator for osrs mobile.
---
Because using F** is hella disrespectful and rude. Its not a good trend that the osrs community is so brazen with homophobic jokes and slurs all the time.
---
If it's to good to be true, it is.
---
If you have to ask then you got scammed
---
what?
---
No. You just make a new account and that's a fact.
---
As already stated for those who think ctc2 was solved it wasn't. The model was simply shown over a currently existing armor set. Runelite doesn't have to ability to tell you what items to have where to stand and what to do because that information is server sided.
---
Man you're 99 rc..shouldnt you be knowing this kind of stuff by now?
---
youre retarded.
---
sorry bud they made this feature only work outside of pvp combat 
---
It would be nice for ironmen to get content catered to them once in a while.
---
I play a main account but I think you’re wrong about this statement. Yes, the game should be primarily balanced considering mains. However im/uim do make up a fair share of the playerbase and their game experience should be considered too.
---
Wtf? Imagine being actually retarded LUL
---
Bonds are way more expensive. Can get gold for 1.2m/$1 instantly
---
Chinning is 100% worth the investment. The amount of time you save makes up for the cost. If you chin to 99, and then go bossing with the time you saved, you will profit in the long run, and have free 99 range. 
---
Add a stack of pots and food right outside every boss, and add a rope outside everywhere that needs a rope, and lets add teleport runes everywhere incase you forgot the ones you needed. We should probably just add every single item to every single tile in the game just in case.
---
No. This idea fucks a lobotomy hole.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tij2t_p4TTw) is a video of me from mid 2012, would describe myself as moderately good. There are options to vary the size and number of players between 1 and 5, that's the largest map with the most people.
---
At the very end you can see I got 74k xp in 13 minutes (15 minutes if you count banking etc.) I was level 113 here - dungeoneering goes up to 120.
---
Traditionally you do a simpler version for the lower floors which takes probably an hour so the xp rate isn't quite as simple as 74k*4.
---
Also the ones who were bad at it/bad total level and only good combat level lol

Adding a combat level would change your combat bracket in BH. It makes a difference albeit not a huge difference.

Tonight at the blue moon inn I’ll be hosting a joke contest. Participants will tell one joke each, ill pick the best two for a final joke off, and the crowd votes for a final winner who  gets 1m gp!
---
We’ve done three of these before and they turned out great. If you weren’t there here’s the rules:
---
When I call your name step up next to me near the bar and tell one joke. Any jokes told out of turn won’t be counted.
---
Everyone will get a turn to say their joke so keep the chat to a lol or haha when other people are doing theirs. Just so we all get a chance to type a setup and punchline.
---
If you want to tell a joke talk to me in game before the show, simple as that! Also if you just wanna hear some jokes come out and help vote for a winner.
---
After the contest we tell some more jokes and drink some beer. Thanks to everyone who came last time and gave me a donation! They’re always appreciated. Last time we had a matching donors so the winner of the contest got another 6m gp on top of the prize money!
---
If you have any suggestions, especially if you came to the last one, reply to this and let me know.
---
They don’t have to deal with all the issues that come with working for one of the shittiest gaming companies in the world tho
---
Or duelling like in RS3 /s

Dude fucking roast him wyd

Shouldn't matter burnt pages only allow the extra damage doesn't affect the fire rune source

When I was an idiot in 6th grade I bought gold in order to buy some black and red mystic armor and got permabanned. Only did it because a classmate told me he did it and didn't get banned. Was crushed at the time
---
Damn fucking roasted
---
Do you really need to imagine it?
---
God I’m sick of you 
---
I get you think these threads are all individual fuckwads trying to unban their accounts, but in honesty these threads serve a greater purpose: telling jagex how shit their current ban, appeal, and overall communication systems are awful (if at all existent in the first place).
---
We need visionaries like you with great ideas about the important things in our daily lives running for office.
---
This is really good!
---
Hate to break it to you but most people make pk builds to uh... pk? One combat level can easily make said accounts useless in edge/bh style Pvp as it pushes them into another combat bracket.
---
Putting 2 and 2 together to get 5.
---
Oh man, this is a good idea! I’ll be there! Thank you for doing something positive in the community instead of just complaining about everything like I usually see here. Brings me hope &lt;3

Nothing wrong with only voting yes on stuff that affects you, i won't vote on pking changes because i don't understand the content enough to have a choice on changes.
---

Poor guy!!!!!!

So many pures who have a few combat 99s crying cause their accounts got ruined but the rest of their account was dogshit lmao. Go make another, takes zero time.

how can i get a trial for membership ive been looking everywhere yet i cant find how to get one

found his bitch ass there lol

The fact you made a new account for this meme!

You choose to limit yourself.

Thats a big OOF

Yeah this is what happened for sure

I know haha, thought I was finally gonna hit the slayer helmet point total. So annoying

max cash bug lmao

can u look into banning of ign Evn. was my account for over 13 years
---
Instead of speculating why not wait for a mods response?

What does this even have to do with limiting ourselves? Jagex messed up on this one not us. You're the one that needs to grow up my man

Ah sweet, was wondering about that. Totally worked. Thanks for the tip!

no support. just remember to bring your pickaxe, what's the point in even needing a spade for barrows or hammer for bandos if we just spawn everything we need right where we need it...
---
Get wilderness medium diaries and kill tree Ents in the wilderness you'll make solid profit albeit with some risk involved
---
I know it sounds kind of ridiculous but there's another thing to consider as well which is the psychological factor of actually risking GP while fighting as opposed to having absolutely no risk. It really does change the dynamic
---
it's their job.. they can hire more ppl
---
You’re an idiot, don’t risk items you don’t want to lose when you go into the wild. And the only thing we’re forced to get is the pickaxe.
---
I don’t kill purples
---
Pures BTFO
---
The difference is that you can't do combat effectively in this gear. 
---
I mean, prices change based on what people are willing to buy or sell an item for. There's no formula that Jagex controls the prices of things or anything, if that's what you're implying.
---
thanks i hate it
---
Have you removed your imbues?
---
Thank you for your amazing reply I was only aware of settled's series, this will give me a chance to make a much more informed decision! 
---
Getting 2 defense doesn’t mean you can’t play the game. You’re the one putting arbitrary restrictions on your account, and personally I don’t think Jagex should be rolling these back at all. 
---
Yes
---
It’s always a great party
---
only how the outfit looks like got leaked, not the actual puzzle. I am pretty sure the first ctc helmet design was leaked through osbuddy.

Interested in posting a screenshot of the mail the mod says he sent to your inbox?

I find the hatred of PKing/Wildy utterly fucking bizarre because I still vividly remember the colossal shit show that happened when they actually did remove the Wildy. People are so fucking weird.
---
Ah, I see! Thank you~ 
---
They refund like 80% of points or something like that
---
Of course not a problem, there’s also some more good series out there, these are just the main ones I like and remember the names off the top of my head. Good luck!
---
You can’t, the tiles appear the same as every other. It’s a serverside check. People watch a swampletics episode and suddenly think they understand how the game engine is run.
---
No hiding poll results still. I expect nothing, and I'm still let down.
---
I had that in my mind as a desert run, I plan to certainly look into that, lots of content there!

If you're just going for points, you might be better off boosting by using Turael for all tasks except the multiples of 10.

---
pretty much yeah. we have one notable exception being touchscreens about 1.5-2 years ago and there were like 3 documented cases which jagex resolved. but for botting especially, false positives just aren't a thing. seems very unlikely for rwt as well. i think the only category of bans which are disputable are the manual "streamer harassment" bans which are pretty bullshit. but automated bans for rwt and botting? doubtful.
---
I watch Chymistry. Such a down to earth guy who’s just fun to watch/listen to while I get that XP.
---
I'm still pissed I got macro banned despite never using a macro I miss my iron Man so much 
---
Only way to get upvotes on this sub
---
Why doesn't Jagex just add an NPC that can remove up to 1k xp per day from any skill? So you can choose to remove 50 xp from attack and 950 from runecrafting in one day, not 1k from attack and 1k from runecrafting. With a limit of 1k per day, it will be enough to fix accidental xp gains at low levels while minimizing the ability for someone to ruin an account they gained unauthorized access to.
---
Everyone saying this is going to lead to Jagex banning Runelite is overreacting. This happens in literally every game that patches in items early. Tons of the new drops for WoW are known long before they're ever gotten legitimately. There's basically nothing they can do to stop someone who really needs to see items before others get them.
---
At worst, it ruins the fun for people obsessive enough to peek at spoilers. At best, it's free advertising for the game.

Rot pet was on the test server. Just pull it out the archive 
---
Any unintended mechanic is a bug. That's what a bug IS - anything that wasn't explicitly intended. RS players just seem to be very confused about that - so they tend to use the term in wildly incorrect and totally inapplicable ways.
---
Sure, it's emergent gameplay, and that's generally accepted - but it doesn't really change the fact that it's a bug.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Just that for some reason, a lot of non-devs decided that there was some magical situation where computers just randomly forget how logic works, or something, and that they do random totally unintended stuff for no real reason. That is a fantasy - things don't *actually* work that way, that's some matrix-level fairy-tale shit. Things go horribly wrong because developers implement different feature sets without considering how they'll affect the rest of the system they're implementing them into.
---
It's a snowball effect, and it's that much easier to succumb to when you've got 3 other devs, and half a dozen different teams/positions asking for new features in systems you've never seen, written by a dude you briefly worked with a decade ago that died in September and didn't document his work correctly.
---
What most people consider a "bug" isn't a real thing that exists in the world, or universe - aside from some extremely unlikely situations involving cosmic rays (yes, I'm serious), but those are pretty much prevented by ECC RAM in the server hardware used for deploying virtual/dedicated servers (game, web, etc).
---
The closest thing is when developers have to work with massive, unwieldy, clunky systems that they scarcely understand. This tends to happen a lot more often in companies with high turnaround rates. After all, your old devs really aren't under any obligation to come back and teach their replacements how things work after they leave.
---
Had to upvote you to 9 but had to upvote the OG post because it was at 11. No bad luck for me man. 
---
That's an additional 10% boost, like void with the complete set. The separate items still have their own bonuses. 
---
&gt; does not give a strength bonus!
---
It does though, as well as the 10%. You also want a berserker necklace.
---
You only get the bonus points for the mile stone task itself. So like if youve completed 9 tasks the completion of your 10th is going to give you the bonus points.
---
 It seems like you did your 10th with the easier master which is why it gave 4 instead of 2 then you have gone back to normal points from chaelder which is 10 per task when not on a milestone assignment
---
The fact that its tilted slightly tilts me.
---
You should’ve just said you play on your phone..

*fucking casual*
---
Neat.
---
Blast mine is the fastest behind power mining, 
---
It’s literally twice as much defence it’s obviously worth a combat level smh
---
So the same...doesn't...go with RS3? In OSRS, you can't boss in absurd gear (or, rather, appearance). In RS3, you can. I'm sure that CS was already aware of what your saying as he's obviously implying that the cosmetic overrides are the issue. 
---
Meanwhile I've rwt ~20 times with no ban

---
Take out 8 hours a day to sleep
---
This is an extremely gay post
---
Honestly an explanation like that is more than enough to satisfy me on why they aren’t implementing a poll result
---
Id be fine if they banned 3rd party clients as long as jagex added ground item prices, total bank value, a gpu renderer, a skybox option, and skill orbs.  None of those give a competitive advantage and should really be in the vanilla client to begin with.  Until that happens jagex should just be happy that there are people out there willing to improve osrs for free.  I doubt very many people use/even know about runelite features that could be considered overpowered.  
---
It doesn't even affect the account that much 
---
just hop loser

Oh didn't even think to check the collection log, looks like they got a fair bit of stuff, they got all the unique drops

Does this game have an insane amount of things to do and explore?
---
Probably banned for selling RS3 gold. Didn't want to shame him that badly. 
---
You’re right the crush ring and ring of the gods as well but those are pretty niche and b ring (I) is generally considered bis at most places. the mage cape is part of wildly lore and actually has a reason to be in the wild. But outside of the pickaxe and ring drops everything else belongs.
---
There is a constant demand for them due to their stats and set effects.
---
Is kinda brute forcing if all you have are the hashes
---
&gt; The fact is that the vast, vast majority of cases can be solved via the system already in place.
---
Ahh yes that's why we have multiple posts a day of people desperately looking for help with their issues because the existing channels are useless. 
---
That is an understatement, yes.

I wasn't aware I had to outline every single scenario where it would or would not be a fucking buff. I can not make this simple for your simple mind. You're arguing a straw man and I'm fine letting you do so, bye kiddo.

The GG means "Green Green." It means he's going range twice in a row. 
---
The GB mean "Green Blue." That means he's going to go range then mage.
---
The GR means "Green Red." He's going to go ranged and then melee. 
---
The GR South means when Zulrah goes ranged he's going to spawn south of the island. The GR West means he's going to spawn to the west.
---
All GR rotations start with the same first 3 patterns, Green, Red, Blue, and then the difference is when he goes ranged, he either goes south or west. 
---
They're just titles for the rotations.
---
The numbers are indicators for where to stand during what phase. Each time Zulrah changes colors you move to the next number. The little numbers beside those numbers are the amount of times you attack Zulrah before using your special attack.
---
I've had a similar name on my alt for 3 weeks, the amount of people who follow and ask me about my name is worth not being able to talk.

"You were incorrectly banned, but at the same time we don't want bad reputation so here's the thing: we keep your alt banned because if we unban it it will be too obvious we fucked up; if you even think about sharing this conversation your main will be perm banned as well, and good luck suing us cause the account has been our property since you created it.

The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding﻿

How is it any easier after eoc? If anything, keeping up with the meta is getting harder and harder. Optimizing your surges and blades dives is a thing now and the inventory changes makes switches way faster. Basically the skill ceiling is way higher now
---
I would run a check on https://haveibeenpwned.com/ just to see if it's been leaked if you haven't already.
---
Dungeoneering (before EoC) actually was fun and I'd like to see something of the sort (although I guess Raids 1 is that) in OSRS, just not as a skill.
---
People make account for specific reasons. Of course it matters if they gain whatever point they were trying to restrict. 
---
Make it a boss and give him a badass cane that's a very rare drop. Maybe a F2P boss since they're at the bottom of the stronghold. I actually love the idea.
---
Well, I see people who play TB regularly - but they don't actually *play.* They just bring 100 buckets of water and then afk for 17 min. Those who work for rewards, I mean. Not many people, for sure, but they do this every day and have those navy costumes and flags. And *even they* skip most of the content.
---
As to the diary, it's tears.... Indeed, pure forcing. People don't want to, they hate to, they spoil all the fun for some single persons who love the game... because it hurts to hear all those "dead content, dead content..." It's a great content which is dead due to some minor miscalculation in gameplay and some disbalance in rewards. 
---
I wanted to make it work :). Mb it's not a good way, but that's what I was thinking. I play TB regularly, for the Stuff and outfits. And I do *play* it, I don't AFK. There are some like me, but very few. And those mostly old oldschoolers, who remember how it was played then. With drive and fight and enemy saboutage... But then every variety was precious - in outfits and in minigames. 
---
It’s ok, they once forced me to change my name because it had the word “succ” in it. Meanwhile, people are running around with the words gay and tiddies in their usernames 
---
Never said that
---
I think this is the route I’m going to go. 
---
You can keep them untrimmed by dropping them on the ground, getting the 99, and telegrabbing them. 
---
Could cast Iban’s blast at barrows. It’s free and you could make good money if you get some nice pieces.
---
You're right, but why'd you have to call him stupid? 
---
smh jamflex accepting bribes
---
I'm surprised they like blue cape, considering that's the one that cheated at the bog. 
---
When using the blowpipe it's difficult to get more than two kills in a trip unless you're maxed or have extremely good RNG.
---
If you want longer trips at the expense of more variable kill times, I'd recommend a crossbow with ruby/diamond bolts. At 85 ranged I can consistently get 3 kills a trip with a rune crossbow, and on average, the kill times are only a little longer.
---
In general, when using a crossbow you have the advantage of avoiding essentially all damage from Vorkath because the antifire shield negates the mage attack and you can pray ranged negating the ranged attack. With a blowpipe you have to pray mage and as a result you're relying on RNG to prevent you from taking too much ranged damage.
---
TL;DR - Use a crossbow if you want longer trips.
---
I'm the minority but i want dung back and i want it to be a skill again 
---
You just take a lot less damage with dhcb because you can pray ranged and use an antifire shield. You don’t have to spec at the start of the fight either. 2 kills trips is pretty much all you can expect when using a blow pipe. 3 kills if you’re lucky. 
---
Holy shit what have you awakened within me
---
This but the guy on the left is safespotting
---
Why compare trips with dhcb people? I've only ever used dhcb but the name of the game is fast banking, dont worry about kills 
---
Could you give us an estimation of how long your kills take? Also, have you considered upgrading the rune cbow to something like dragon or armadyl?
---
Imagine unironically lording it over people who have clicked their mouse fewer times than you have.  
---
I should clarify - I love the idea in revitalizing the minigame! And totally think it would be a great use of developer time to bring some life back in it. I hope they see your suggestion and consider it :)
---
Except you can't train just str with a whip, so unless OP can afford abby dagger or bludgeon (95% of cases), he is better off knocking out 70 str first 
---
Goals 😍😍

Less talking, more raiding.

When that other part of the community has been voting no on polls you want, that tends to happen. I have no sympathy.

You should feel bad for being on the wrong end of free speech. Absolute idiot my guy. As long as there is no ongoing harassment or calls for violence/threats, you should be able to say it. If you don't like hearing or reading it OPT THE FUCK OUT.

I think you forgot halberds which are arguably the most dangerous since they give def xp in the first slot.

It's a personal problem you're overthinking. Yes prices are on a decline based on an influx of seeds and herbs, but a vast majority of those seeds and herbs are coming from the Konar drop table, even post-nerf.

I hope to be there!!

---
Weird question, couldn't find an answer through Google..
---
Someone just walked up and gave me, and several (10+) other people 10m, no strings attached.
---
I feel slightly paranoid over this interaction; Like, could I get banned or something if this guy just cleaned someone's account? Why would someone hand away that much GP.. Lol
---
Thanks for taking the time to (hopefully) quell my fears..
---
I genuinely wasn't going for 99 dungeoneering, I just wanted a shadow silk hood. That's all I wanted, and I figured I'd get it by level 85 or so and call it quits at that point. 
---
I got it at level 97. At that point I was committed to the 99.
---
Do you attack while he does the fast bomb attacks?
---
You lose a lot of dps if you just walk/run to avoid, instead of attacking.
---
A pure, say, a 1-def pure, has much higher damage potential than its combat level might suggest, which is important, for example, if you're PKing in low level wilderness. You're fighting people near your level, but you hit WAY harder than they do.
---
Other people just want to build a weird account for fun.
---
My name isn't Mark.
---
"walnut of a brain" lmfao. 
---
My name animet1dd1es got banned a few days ago.  I feel your pain, brother.
---
I meant obby maulers, not g maulers. lol. we were talking about both and I got confused.
---
I think they're the same thing. I don't think that random shit that we like to do has value.
---
Like if you think making a youtube video about some 10 year old game has value I disagree. It's just random clutter in the void. It's not going anywhere. It's one of 10,000 hours of video uploaded to YT that day. 
---
That kid writing the 10 millionth essay in class about a book everyone reads in middle school? Yea. No value. Oh sure, the kid learns something, but guess what? It's not valuable to learn that thing. It's not useful. It doesn't get us anywhere that we haven't already been. 
---
A doctor who goes through med school with straight A's but dies in a car wreck the day before graduation had no value. He didn't actually help anyone. He just studied and died. No value. 
---
Oh look, someone rescued a dog in Vietnam. Now they're best friends. Cool. But no value happened. Nothing changed. 
---
Hey Bill Gates donated billions to save millions of lives in Africa. HOLY FUCKING SHIT that's value. That's a contribution. Jesus christ give that guy a goddamn medal. 
---
Value is contributing.

That’s sucks butt home skillet. Gold gets locked in the coffer that requires your bank pin, why would you keep it in your inventory? 
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with the update, and everything due to you signing up for double xp weekend.
---
Thank you! 
---
I didnt sign up for double xp
---
So if I spam clicked the pile and picked up a warrior ring, I would have picked up claws before that?
---
Stick to vorkath. Zulrah is for losers
---
it actually implicates him more than anything lmao
---
I mean, the ToS say they can ban you literally any reason, or for no reason at all. They own your account, they're just letting you play on it.
---
Are you an elaborate troll or just an underage attention seeker?
---
So he is, I stand corrected. Odd that it works out to an equivalent 30h of dh. Probably intentional.
---
You're doing Saradomin's work. Fantastic job.
---
Your password isn’t even case sensitive. 
---
Some people spend all day raiding and have more money than they know what to do with.  If you have max gear and a bil in the bank its just sitting there doing nothing.
---
God damn!!!🔥🔥🔥
---
Punished for the 100 xp from putting the head? Come on..
---
Yeah Bludgeon would be better, if you're using prayer though Guthan's is still pointless because you don't lose any HP. The Catacombs and Slayer Tower Abyssal Demons have the same stats btw.
---
Remember when the Stronghold of Security was introduced and they said things like don't follow links that aren't on the official website and Jagex will never ask for your email address?
---
As of 3-4 weeks ago they were up to making slander videos against Frontline. Now disclaimer I am not affiliated with any clan, but if you want to see what they've been up to search "Frontline: The Clan behind the tweets".
---
Its like 20-40 minutes long. Imagine hating your rivals so much in a Medeviel RPG game where 60% of people use auto clickers that you make a video entitled "Frontline: The Clan Behind the Tweets". As if you are somehow going to descredit one toxic group by saying your not toxic and doing that psuedo creepy announcer voice with dramatic music in the background while you have some nerd "tell it how it really is".
---
Like Clan v Clan warfare in OSRS is so childish a 13 year old would approach it with more maturity, but that's what RoT has been up to. As well as holding total level worlds hostage at ~~Jed Caves~~ Revenant Caves. Seriously imagine if the senior partner in your clan/guild was able to hand design the content you sit at for 12 hours a day charging people the right to use those worlds. 
---
Jmod Jed literally has given ROT the keys to infinite wealth and yet they still have a statute and when it comes down to Q&amp;A Jmods are always like "well guys if the clans could reach out to us for feedback". Like you're willingly hitting up motherfuckers who planted a shill in your company who you now have to sue, yet ya'll still look to them for advice. Asinine.
---
Your spot on man! Except for the total level, I’m actually around 150 total level at the moment. Don’t know what barrows gloves are but they must be hard to get! Wish I had 72 mining but I haven’t upgraded my bronze pick yet so my exp goes by pretty slow :/
---
You really only need 43, anything more is bonus. 44 is good for eagle eye ofc. 
---
Fight caves is hard, don't fret!
---
It really doesn't matter if they spent 5 min or 1000 hours on the account. If a poorly tested update ruined their goals for the account, that's not fair. If the player screwed up and clicked the wrong attack style itd be a differnt story. How would you feel if a glitch removed a bunch of gp from your bank? Its not fair for a fuckup by jagex to waste players time
---
sadly they wouldn't even hesitate to kill you and probably not think twice about it
---
Reddit at large references runescape a lot, I look at r/NBA every day and I probably see a runescape reference probably about once a day lol
---
I'm not saying it doesn't need work
---
Oh wow, did not realize that ranarr seeds ever dropped that low. I chose the worst time to get 81 Herb.
---
Yeah, though running for exp is a relatively new thing in the grand scheme of things and I think it's bad game design too. There's no easy way to change it, either, which is a shame. 
---
Do people even scythe gargs for real?
---
Can someone explain what crack the clue is?
---
I believe it’s a worthwhile investment.  Bloodvelds are a common slayer task and they are also weak to stab.  Also, the weapon is more than likely to retain its current value until you get 99 strength with it.
---
Can you tell me a geology fact
---
It's pretty much just for str training. The z hasta is the better choice purely for dragons and if you aren't focusing on strength, whip is just fine 
---
How exactly does a pure getting 2 defence through a bug influence the game economy in any shape or form? Your logic doesn't quite hold up. 
---
You can't say "you chose to limit yourself" to one account type and then say "well it's fine because it doesn't affect me" to another account type. At least be consistent. 
---
I had something similar happen to my pure whos name used to be "u got 12aped" 
---
:^ )
---
I knew I would see this here when i saw it in /r/sbubby 
---
Wow I didn't even know that
---
What method for vorkath are there that don’t involve void? 
---
Ok so bludgeon with void? I might get plyte tbh it sounds like a major game changer
---
Could you explain why 83 construction would be good. 
---
And I don’t have fighter torso unlocked so also what would be good about selling the bcp
---
Like a giant clue scroll, where the reward is mostly cosmetic and a bit of fun.
---
Last time it took over 12 months to solve.
---
Uhhh excuse me? As I said above, I'm not a pure nor have I ever owned one. 
---
Then you’re actually an idiot
---
You did no read what I put.
---
He know what me mean when me say runecraft bad, and we best friend!

Cool story nerd

may as well bring the spade and try. let me know and i'll add the info to the wiki.

Holy ****, forget the poll

how? lol

Hmm,  well I'll try it out for a bit worst case I can always sell back thanks for helping me come to a conclusion 
---
Lol nice 
---
Gladly!  A fairly new concept called carbon sequestration seeks to capture and bury atmospheric carbon dioxide and inject it back into the massive reservoirs that used to hold the petroleum that released it.  It could help dampen the effects of climate change and is the focus of my degree :)
---
At this point yes, when I posted that comment they hadn't said what they would do, I'd anything
---
Made me slightly exhale more air out of my nose
---
Looking through my post history and I saw this reply. And while I think you're wrong within the context of this conversation (I won't get into why I believe this, but I digress) I so absolutely agree with you that reddits pro drug stance is extremely destructive. Good comment serene. 
---
Make them sell on the GE for as much
---
Those are also called strawmen. There is no point addressing them or being "consistent" with those things.
---

What would warding even entail? I’m interested in the idea of some of these but given that  things like construction and all happen to be only leveled by paying money makes me worried for artisan/ dungeoneering

Yeah put in an automated appeal system again so ppl can abuse the shit out of it some more.
---
Godspeed
---
Bitch I've played for years and still find myself with an empty Ectophial sometimes. You can't cure forgetfulness

it being a skill is what made it good. as a skill you are forced to do it, and even after getting the rewards you want, you just keep doing it for xp.
---
that's just adding gp to economy...

Rs3 had a system where you could only log in with certain Ips. I don't think this would work anymore with mobile unless you could enable only select mobile devices to access your account.

I honestly just did ranged at slayer tasks that let me semi afk and safe-spotable (pretty much everything in chasm of fire has a safe spot and many other slayer tasks do as well). Never really trained ranged outside of slayer and currently at 86. Tasks take a little longer but if you use broad bolts it's really cheap

&gt;Or better yet take away more dev time to hire someone to do appeals...pssh smh.
---
Any company that gives a shit should hire an adequate staff to review ban appeals. This isn't an argument.
---
I forget a rockhammer for gargoyles at least once a week, shit happens.
---
My bank is quite a bit larger but I just spent 30m to get 83 construction, it is definitely worth it. With boosts you get access to all the best house features, it’s a game changer having your own house with all the bells and whistles.
---
Frog head? Do people wear those pking?
---
No shit, not even joking, this is 1 kill off from the exact kc and loot I’ve got off of demonics 💀 shards and all. We have a hidden umbilical cord attached between both our accounts feeding us good rng.

I'm always amused that "kid" is the go to insult. I can't imagine there being that many people under 18 even playing this game.

What about the people who dont read updates once they come out, like me...
---
I love this
---
While you are busy requesting duels ill be busy ignoring you and finishing my task.
---
You overestimate this sub
---
The ten minutes a Wednesday I wathh swampletics will definitely not impact my free time as much as the game itself lol
---
How would you feel if it was just relevant armor you could change appearances to? Like you could make your mystic look like wizard, but not like rune or d'hide?
---
I mean... That just can't be helped. 
---
Just move the bronze pick crate to the start.

no, that's fine

---
literally the majority (75%) are against pures. 
---
As long as your internet is fast enough to have your character perform an action in the same tick as your opponent(0.6 seconds of the duel) then pid is a random number assigned to each player, the lowest of the two number gets pid. 
---
Each characters "pid random number" is re-rolled every 90 seconds 
---
Erm... Trying to get to level 75, so can't use a level 80 spell =/
---
I guess I wrongly assumed you were doing multiple-kill trips. If you're refreshing stats after each kill, you can easily make it through one without a brew dose, with redemption as a backup.

You can already do that for anything that matters other than RWT and Botting ban appeals. The problem with offering support for RWT and Botting ban appeals is almost all the appeals end up being fake, either people trying to waste Jagex's time, or hoping they'll slip up and give them back their account they broke the rules on. They've done events in the past where for like a couple weeks or a month or something, they accepted appeals for wrongful bans (like for people who got hacked and the hacker botted on their account), and they received so many appeals with only a very tiny percent of them being real appeals. To do something like that full time they would need to hire extra people that would often spend work days finding nothing but fake appeals.
---
There's certainly things Jagex could do to improve account security that I wish they would do, but expecting them to pay people to go through 1000s of fake appeals for every 1 real appeal is just not realistic. Though it's been a while since they last did 1 of those limited ban appeal events, so they could always do 1 of those again.

thing is, normal people are in the 1-60 combat bracket for like 1-2months. You get cycled through too fast. It wouldn't matter if pures were 99 range or if they were a "normal" acc. The guy is going to lose no matter what because the pure has experience pking
---
Imma do it on purpose just for the karma.
---
I'm a new player who just started and decided to start with membership. Should I have waited and done more f2p stuff or is there early game p2p stuff I can do to progress my account faster? Love the game so far btw.

---
it has a ton of qol benefit for pvm, it makes switching requite 1-2 less clicks if you would have also had to switch attack styles. Hopefully all the ruined accounts get the rollback they deserve though. Its a simple change but its one of my favorite updates of the year so far.

I don't understand why you think I'm even arguing anything. I've simply stated facts and told you my opinion. You're free to read the facts yourself and come to your own opinion. There is no argument here besides you trying to convince me that OP is innocent. I have already acknowledged there's at least a small chance he's telling the truth, and at least a small chance he's innocent.

its the only AFK magic method for lower levels.

But I'm not sure they will even see it... Because of the downvotes.

My mistake was to suggest something other than lobby for the medium diary. And I do understand those downvoters... If someone wanted to run Barrows, it was stupid to require of them to bring even a couple buckets of water - in a minigame they don't need and don't want.

How do u still stake with 7b??? You can literally buy everything in the game..,
---
Is it worth to add Limpwurt to my farming runs? I already do herb/bush/hop simultaneously. 
---
What makes you think I don't go outside you dumb cunt
---
There’s already a shortcut, but it requires a pickaxe to get to lol
---
Finding a team can be a hassle, especially if you just wanna join in for like an hour, but volc mine is like the chillest way to grind mining. I could spend hours doing volc mine without a care, honestly most under-rated piece of content in the game, I just wish more people did it so finding a team wasn't a hassle. Though it's been a long time since I did a few mining levels, so maybe it's more popular now.
---
No because it’s built into the slayer helm
---
I wanted MORE 
---
But if the entire world gets knocked out, the looter can’t access it either...
---
Problem is I’m in a 2K total world so most are already inside at the top level 
---
Once you pass level 95 or so pures aren’t gonna have any huge advantage on you. 
---
But if you’re in that 60-85 range pures will totally fuck your shit up
---
Eh I vote no on literally everything for no reason other than I like saying no.
---
Seems so bullshit even though I know you’re right lol

These Runescape fansites are all on life support.  Reddit and the wiki consolidated all these sites into one.  Most likely won't see any guides added there.  Only the wiki and YouTube guides are available.
---
Evscape is doing a 365 day video challenge which I really enjoy watching l. Small arms has a 5b from scratch series which is hilarious ✌️ hope this helped 
---
Well I average around 8 herbs per patch with the following
---
- 5% boost to both farming guild and hosidius patch ( zeah hards)
---
- 15% boost in catherby (kandarin hards)
---
- 10% from magic scateours 
---
-Ultracompost from bottomless compost bucket
---
-I don't have the harmony patch yet.
---
Which means I get 64 herbs on average.if I had the harmony one it would have been 72... How were you getting 80? Farming cape + elite kandarin and zeah?
---
I'd look like that if i cared to get roasted for my 48 defence
---
I really love your videos bro, keep up the good work ❤️
---
Can we get an actual answer on outcome?? 6k upvotes suggest we are interested in the situation
---
Jokes on you I sold my headboard for RuneScape money 
---
Man do I love seeing these. We might genuinely need a proper drama chart at this rate with the amount we get per month. 
---
You're right it's not QoL. That's a misnomer. My rationale was that it would make disturbing whirlpools more convenient and convenience updates tend to be QoL, but it doesn't really fit.
---
I think that each *type* of weapon should, in theory, have a niche. Even though longbows are worse than shortbows in OSRS, longbows still have more accuracy and range, which also makes sense intuitively.
---
  
---
To me at least, it also seems intuitive that throwing axes would have longer range than throwing knives, given that they'd weigh more and have more momentum when thrown.
---
But the suggestion isn't really a big deal. Mostly just a passing thought. Thanks for the feedback!
---
You really think osrs is the only sub with a drama calendar? 
---
This devalues my Big Brody Ironman
---
Elite zeah. no farm cape

The net wasn't added because of swampletics.  It was related to someone else asking for it on Twitter.
---
They added that after accounts were ruined
---
Yes then everyone will have a bitch that it’s dead content pick the lesser of 2 evils and stop crying
---
Dang that sucks. Tbh all I want is the steps to be numbered and short. The issue I have with the wiki is the guide and lore is mixed into the same paragraphs. When I want to get a quest done quick, i'm way less likely to care about the lore. 
---
Someone who keeps their defence level at 1 in order to max their strength level and minimise their combat level, this is a tactic used to create PKing accounts. The logic goes that you can hit as hard as a high level player whilst still being able to attack low level players. 1 def pures have the advantage of dealing more damage at a lower combat level but are disadvantaged by not being able to wear any decent armour which is why their strategy is to deal as much damage as possible to end fights quickly in order to minimise how much damage they need to absorb.
---
Sceptre? Or for the cheaper route than 1m, Pollivneach house tabs for the carpet to the bandit camp?
---
 Nice try Dovydas
---
Then you are just lying. There are so many gargoyles in the bottom slayer part that this is totally a not-problem. Yikes dude.

I understand that too. And again it is to prevent boosting. A lot of people can find a group willing to let you "tag along" so to say. Now i think 115 could be lowered to 110 IMO - because thats reasonable enough to think a well geared 110 could be sufficient there. 
---
However..again, besides the whole boosting prevention lets just forget about that for a moment - the fact of the matter is that it acts as a level requirement. Now you can do it BEFORE that requirement, but it will lessen the points for you and the team. You also need level 85 slayer to do Abby demons..you need combat level for certain quests, etc. 
---
It's end game content that requires an end game combat level as part of it. And honestly it counters the argument of "wah its locked behind a CB level" because you can still DO it if you want, you'll just get less points. 
---
Regardless..again, the main point is that its an end game piece of content that requires end game levels. And part of that is combat. Low level skillers, pures, etc, you choose that path and you aren't forced to do the raid..but if you want to do it efficiently then you need to be the proper level to do so. I dont see an issue with this..the raid provides some BiS powerful gear, so the high requirements of doing it are justified. Im not sure why its so hard to understand this point. Should you be able to do hydra at 70 slayer now? Or ds2 at lvl 30? Wear rune with 1 def? Its just another "requirement" for max efficiency..and you aren't even really required to have the combat..you just wont get the max benefit. 
---
It gives incentive to those who ARE high level and worked towards it. I see nothing wrong with this at all.

And clear you of any damage over? so if you get hit for a 50 at 48 hp it will just teleport you out anyway? Or did I misinterpret? Cuz that's almost like a 2nd life basically, and def don't support if that the way it be.

Why are you people upvoting a 5 year old's drawing?

You’re trying too hard, darling.

hmm i haven't actually tested, that sounds to be the case in the log though. unsure. but in any case it's just another execution simplification, this could already be done it just took more skill before.

Yes, that is the entire point of the joke. Good job!

Like others have said, archers is good, but what you have is fine if you can't get your hands on that.

Blowpipe will help you shred, but keep the guthans, in my opinion. It'll definitely help you heal up on the blobby boys, and reduces your need for brews in your first time around. With all those prayer potions, it means you can focus on learning the waves without having to pray flick the mages. With that amount of prayer pots, you can drift through the entire second half without turning off protect from mage.

Good luck! Post results. :)

I really liked playing dungeoneering, and I would have liked to see it in old school, but in past Q&amp;A's they've mentioned that with the size of the current dev team introducing it would require halting production on any other updates for several months/ close to a year. If it weren't for this restraint I would like to see it introduced. 
---
There's always been alot of back and forth on whether it should even have been a skill instead of a minigame, but with the way progression and the later rewards functioned, it wouldn't have worked otherwise.
---
I voted for Warding here as think it has the highest potential of the other three to provide unique content while still tying into the rest of the game seamlessly with links to other skills, items, and locations.
---
I haven't read the actual dev blogs for Sailing but from what I've heard, Sailing would be somewhat similar to Dungeoneering  in that it would be primarily trained through minigame like content. I do think this has potential but I don't think it has the same potential as dungeoneering, that incorporated so many gameplay aspects and skills inside of itself. I just can't see it having the same scope.
---
As far as Artisan, I don't believe I've read the official post for this either, but everyone knows it as the slayer for skills. While this skill obviously incorporates other skills inside of itself and, from what I've heard, proposed exclusive methods of training and tools, I don't think this would provide enough unique content to satisfy enough players.
---
Overall I really like the concept of a new skill for the simple fact that it's easily accessible and available to all players of the game regardless of the progress in their account.
---
I said that meaning it seems pretty realistic to me. I wasn't trying to call anyone out, you need to chill coconut man.
---
no this isnt that i prooooomise
---
That I'd absolutely 100% how I feel. I've had so much more fun on my ironman than I ever had on my main.
---
I just feel overwhelmed with some of the endgame content as an ironman. I will continue to play it. I was just curious if anyone else feels that way.

2 def = 1 def due to rounding down in the roll calculation. You need 3 def before you get any tankier from defence levels. The only theoretical advantage to 2 def I can think of is you can pot to higher defence.

That only applies below 20 wilderness. Above that pures are the meta and then it instantly switches to low level meds. The prayers can always be used, but zerks/voiders lose the majority of their advantage when they can't use untradeables or vengeance.

Iirc, the original intent was to reintroduce Zamorak into the world with Floor 61, and that was meant to happen shortly after the Warped floors released. Unfortunately, that never quite happened. Zammy, and the other gods, returned when Guthix died, and Zamorak made floor 61 into his hideout. You can visit like 1 room of it after a quest (Dishonor Among Thieves. You also visit a couple rooms of it during the quest iirc), but we're still waiting for an actual piece of content for it. Jagex has stated they want to do it, but they don't really have any idea what it would be, so nothing has really happened yet.
---
Goodbye. 
---
This will make top page. But you may want to take down and repost in the am for peak hours 
---
This is a great idea. 
---
It is based on drop rate, but if Runelite was able to do this, you realize it would be patched very quickly and you would likely get a ban for abusing it.
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
Just hop bro
---
Honestly pisses me off to see this from Jagex security. All they have to do is add authenticator delay and you would know when someone is trying to get on your account. Or maybe case-sensitive passwords.  
---
But the principle of someone getting a hold of your acc in some way and then RWTing or botting gets you perma banned and you can't appeal unless you go on reddit or twitter in hopes of a response so Jagex doesn't look bad
---
And what about my 13m RC xp?
---
Well you need to pick a more central spot and eventually reach Nash Equilibrium 
---
That sucks :(

well isnt she asian? u need a girl irl too

I realize that, now there's only ~300 ppl on that world tho. Which means theres about 700 pkers. I'd say thats pretty active.

it's a yikes from me dawg

&gt;And risking HC status is just as meaningless as maintaining 1 def instead of 2. The status means nothing.
---
completely agree
---
&gt;Pures dont min Max with defence
---
They do/should. If you have 52 prayer, you should be min/maxing your defence to 4, considering you won't be gaining any CB levels from 1-4 defence. 
---
Hello there!

Are you drunk?

It wouldn’t be stupid if they didn’t look, they never change style so why check

Nobody knows the stats. Nobody has found the items yet.

Because autocast barrage is a tick slower on the first barrage, and the wave nylocas usually die in one hit so you're losing heaps of ticks for a minor convenience. On the nylo boss you're switching gear every 2/4 hits and prior to yesterday's update setting up an autocast each time would be stupid.

Are Rune Dragons worth killing with a subpar setup (no Justiciar/Lance)?  I only get about 4 kills per trip with my ghetto Torags setup.  Average might even be slightly under that since I feel like I get rolled pretty often and get like 3 kill trips.  Sometimes even 2 with really shit RNG. But anyway I know you're supposed to get like 7-8 kills or so.  
---
Are they even worth doing at that point or would I be better served just doing some other afk monsters like BBDs or gargs?  I figured since I have 90+ melee stats rune dragons would be the natural answer for afk money, but then I realized I was kind of getting owned.

Agility is my highest skill. I hate it when I start doing the rooftop course, but after a while it's just mindless effort that I can do while watching something or leveling an alt. Then once I see the results it turns the initial hatred into love for the skill.

Until I start training it again and hate the first couple minutes...
---
It's a cyclical love-hate relationship.

I'm doing this from now on

You have a couple of options(assuming you have the respective slayer level req). Namely gargs, kurusk, green dragons(with looting bag),skeletal wyverns.
---
I agree that should be treated as an integrity issue.
---
The point I'm making is that Jagex repeatedly ignores this subject, without any explanation given. Here are some examples:
---
1 The ["QoL Month Week 3: Re-runs" suggestion thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/apgnxz/qol_month_week_3_reruns/eg83wqp/): Top comment with a large margin, even gilded multiple times. Ignored.
---
2. The ["QoL Month Poll: Re-runs" announcement thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aq85vq/qol_month_poll_reruns/ege9s4m/). Once again top comment, once again ignored.
---
3. The ["QoL Month Week 4: Other" suggestion thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/arxuk7/qol_month_week_4_other/egqbetm/). Once again top comment, once again ignored.
---
4. Plus all the other times it has been brought up. 
---
It's fine if they don't want to poll it again and treat it as an integrity change at some point in the future. However, the least they should do is explain why they're not picking certain suggestions (or Q&amp;A questions).
---
i wonder what his fremenik name is
---
im coding it to my bot scripts now
---
Old but logical suggestion. Pures shouldn't have the possibility to roll back or decrease levels though. Mistakes on rs3 tends to be punishable
---
the office funny
---
Nice of him to be proud of marring a deaf girl.
---
(That's the only way anyone would ever be able to stand this guys voice for a prolonged period of time)
---
cosmetic overrides are fine when your game isn't full of giant angel wings and super saiyan glow-hair
---
the alternative is everyone looking the same
---
HC is official 1 def pure isn't. Also don't act like people don't make memes when HCs die thats just how the community is.
---
This is hilarious 
---
If the community wants it
---
difference being in black desert and other asian mmos, the scantily clad bikini armor isn't even cosmetic it's just what the armor looks like
---
I was bank standing at ge a while back and picked up a bgs from a random drop party that was going on, other stuff was like rune plate body and stuff like that and then all of a sudden he says "I dropped bgs here" so I'm like eh why not give it a try, spam click the ground for a minute and then boom it was in my inventory 
---
Sit
---
yeah 7 years is long according to jagex thats why they wipe the name idk why i got downvoted for giving information but yeah nice 👍🏽 people cant handle truth or something?
---
Mfw runecrafting is my 2nd highest stat after woodcutting

Nobody cares. It’s one level.

I solod till pyro set and 3 torches/gloves. Got them at 91 and started afking in main Wintertodt worlds. Around 2k total at the time, was lazily getting 300-400k an hour which was nice. Unless he has post 99 so your not making close to 400m though
---
No, it’s real. I’ll always vote no on poles that benefit them.
---
too true
---
I agree! Just make the attack bonus 0 would be great
---
Nah. I don't have any friends and I play with hiding other people for the most part.
---
you can change that to 7 days at the banker
---

If it WAS viable to have a whip pure the "tiers" would obviously fucking change a hell of a lot. The meta wouldn't be 60 att xx str 1 def, it would likely be 70 att xx str 1 def (for 1 def pures) simply because of how much better a whip is vs what's available now. 
---
Those 3-4 combat levels aren't a big deal IF you could freeze xp.
---
However, go make a whip pure today.
---
See what happens when you try to attack anyone.
---
Enjoy those combat levels that will never stop coming.

i mean what he said would work in reality perfectly fine, but nowadays you have coding standards and have to stick to them
---
If you accept a random event with a full inventory it drops on the ground(obviously), but it treats it similar to an item on death so it will chill for a  hour before it becomes visible, then despawns.
---
Just shut up, man.
---
Just a meme that Torvesta doesn't have a GF and that it actually was his sister which he introduced in a video.

I got hacked and lost all of my gp lol.

ty i was like wtf happened since i trained crafting last O_O 
---
ty
---
I have full prospector outfit (for the fally diary) but haven't unlocked the upper level. Recently got Varrock armour 4. Is it safe to sell the prospector jacket back to Percy?
---
its not big of a cheat compared to other runelite features, theres alot bigger cheats in runelite. 
---
YOUR DRAGONFIRE SHIELD IS ALREADY FULLY CHARGED
---
Theoretically you would be able to get as many skills as you want down to 0 exp
---
I mean it DOES give +1 prayer so I wouldn't call it fashionscape.
---
I know it's been said a million times so whoever wants to downvote me can. However I wish people would consider shit like that time they bought infinity boots instead of wizard boots for an extra 700k for +1 magic offensive stat. We do it all the time, because a +1 here and a +1 there adds up. Point is pures don't need extra prayer bonus, so if it's just "fashionscape" why should they care if it gets polled no.
---
Perhaps, but in your average encounter, that 1 tick is so meaningless I'm surprised you even brought it up, and doesn't show me any benefit aside from the easiest possible way to cast any sow you want. Making new people excited about PvP is GREAT, but there has got to be a better way than make the game faster and easier.
---
Clues are 1/128 and masks are 1/512. Looks about right.
---
in anothergame u wouldnt have runelite, runelite is just one big cheat client if u look at it objectively and compare it to regular client
---
Why fletch lmao
---
It will be the rarest.
---
Why is Adobe gay
---
I don't think most people really care what world they hop to, as long as it's world with low ping or if they are doing content like Wintertodt. 
---
“Just wanted to share me getting junk again on my 2521 medium clue :)”

Chill bro, stop being so triggered

Noice. Thanks for the info.
---
do it n film it too lol
---
LMFAOO
---
I dont quest much.. I have att, str, def and range 1.
---
I only train mage, prayer and hp + non combat skills.
---
- buy jugs in shop
---
- fill them with water 
---
- pick grapes and make wine
---
- willow / maple logs easy to cut
---
- cut logs and knife them into bows
---
- pick flax &amp; string your bows
---
- fish for trout/salmon, cook them and sell them or use them as food for combat training
---
- start thieving until you can do the ardougne chest with 3gp + 1 nature rune
---
- high alch upstairs 4x then thieve the chest 1x
---
It makes highalching easier, including 1 free nature rune every 15sec / 4 high alchs.
---
That is how I started to make money while training. Not much but its something :-)
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Its gambling you fucko lol win big lose big
---
How afk do you need it to be? Netflix afk or homework afk? If its netflix afk go do blast mine. Im 78 mining and im getting 50k/h plus decent amount of rune ore. Can watch YT/Netflix in the meantime. 
---
What is/was your username OP?
---
I love how a Jmod acknowledging the post and looking into the issue automatically = fuck off shit jamflex.
---
Rip jaggo
---
More group content please. Memes aside wintertodt is fun as fuck imo, I love reading the dumb shit people say and would like more of it. Grinding that solo is way more a chore
---
they do, but it's not used for PvP as it doesn't give a max hit.
---
Re-reading it, I disagree.
---
ma shnibbla
---
But the divided by two means (two) get (.5)
---
Which one are you supposed to click? 
---
They will fix the bot scripts within hours..the bots dont have  more then a few mill on them. Ddos problem will stay forever
---
nope maybe my client is glitched but some fishing spots don't have the blue box
---
We wouldn't want to hold your hand every step of the game would we
---
You'll ultimately get better rates of ore, exp, and nuggets using the upper level, so sell back pieces of prospector if you have to to get access to it.
---
The only thing you definitely need the actual jacket for is the master clue step that requires you to "mine a runite ore while sporting the finest mining equipment". For all other purposes the varrock armour is equivalent/superior.
---
GE = bad?
---
Have you played path of exile? There is no auction house there, it is a populated game, and even with plenty of third party websites and tools designed to make trading easier, it often is pure cancer. Especially for items that are used in high quantities.
---
The only thing GE mostly removed is scamming. There was absolutely nothing fun about spamming your message about selling lobsters 1gp lower than the guy next to you. 
---
That’s what I’m trying to tell you, from my experience when I have auto retaliate ON.
---
I log into pvp world and someone attacks me and I cannot attack back until I interact with screen. And yes you can afk on app and not get logged out when your in combat but my point is when your not in combat and switch apps you get logged very quickly .
---
But msg jagex and they will sort you prob
---
Thanks for the QoL Jagex /s
---

---
How?
---
Thats a disgusting hack and you know it. 
---
Justice for voting no for divine sigil
---
You think you'll ever make these at a time suitable for europeans? 
---
You're absolutely correct on this. Pkers don't use their voice.
---
Pkers mainly only play the game to have dynamic fun, they don't waste their time going through uninteresting poll questions.
---
It's sad, but over time this lead to pvp being marginalized in the polls.
---
No fucking way dude that did not just happen no way holy fuck that did not just happen 
---
Rot
---
An elo system should be added as a no brainer at this point.
---
But first, pvp polls need to be made exclusive to pkers, else nothing will ever pass.
---
cos it breaks the pvp meta
---
How did this even get through testing lol
---
Did they only check if the switching worked or something?
---
is that some sort of relative to farquaad? 
---
Yeah but you probably wouldn’t notice it if you didn’t already know it was there. Definitely would take away the need for game knowledge treating everything like this. Knowing what to bring for birdhouse runs and farm runs is a good example, 5 seconds now compared to 30 seconds even a minute if fucking up before should exist 
---
Well that's very worrying that we've seen people trading gold to their alts (something I'm sure you can see easily) get banned. Train them better because things like this really are inexcusable. 
---
Yes this. This even works for skillers!
---
Just one quick question. With all the recent talk about downloading wrong runelite Client im getting kinda paranoid. If you download the wrong one do they hack you instantly or do they wait for you to get more Money? I have it downloaded since a few months and didnt get hacked and im pretty sure i downloaded the right one. This question just always floated in my head.
---
Maybe but it isn't worth the time overal for me, lamping to 27 isn't going to take too long, I prefer working on all my other goals in the mean time
---
OSHD got shut down because they wouldn't comply when Jagex asked to see the code, not because of graphical changes. OSB's plastic mode existing for as long as it has is proof of that
---
Reminds me of the time my buddy got his character name "Bærstad" (His irl last name) removed on his WoW characters because people kept reporting him thinking it said "Bastard". Atleast he didnt have to pay for name changes on his characters with the names. 
---
those definitely follow you
---
what month is the 15th?
---
No bots for chinning and bursting efficiently, without deaths. Care to provide source.

Wow this is fantastic! Glad to see some good original content on here still.
---
Thank you. I've been searching for a way to solve my minor Warrior's Guild Token problem. I should go train 30 attack levels right now. I'm sure it'll save me HOURS of time to get my D Defender

oh yeah let me make 1 defence bgloves vengeance accs! NICE

After some discussion, we figured out what his end goals are:  
---
* Kill goblins for the max attainable BiS gear, a fearsome bronze scimitar, durable bronze kite, and stylish red cape  
---
* Ask players to make fires for him until he can reach 34 cooking and no longer burn anchovies  
---
* Train up to 70 mining with a bronze pickaxe to mine Adamant  
---
If only cruel Jamflex had put an Imp in the swamp, which would unlock for him riveting content such as making wines, lighting his own fires, and delectable Cooked Chickens.  
---
Please wish this man plentiful dopamine in his endeavors, he deserves it.  
---
The problem Will be that i join that World top get a free spot at my slayer task, mining spot and so on. I (most people) don’t care that it’s a rp server if the spot is free I take it and don’t chat/ rp

Isn't there a bronze pick spawn in the Fally castle?
---
Exactly, 95% of posts on Reddit recommending a 'PvP' update aren't from actual pkers, they may be from edge pkers but none of these players tribrid or NH.
---
Let me make it clear right now don't even think of rejuvenating the wilderness, just fix the thousand bugs plaguing PvP and all the autoswitchers.
---
People shoot themselves in the foot all the time, or subconsciously hate themselves without knowing quite frequently. Just like when the lower income individuals vote for the right wing fiscally conservative agenda whose goal is to further widen the Gap and not help them. It happens.
---
It's a breath of fresh air because area restricted accounts don't follow the same old meta. Things that are normally easy suddenly require ingenuity and grinding. 
---
Settled adds to that with good cinematography and charisma
---
Oh sorry, I think I worded that weirdly and you misunderstood - I never said nor implied it got shut down because of that. I just said that's how OSHD likely worked, and mentioned it got shut down to give context in case people didn't know what client I was referring to. Also, I believe OSBuddy's OpenGL mode works differently - it doesn't replace the individual models as OSHD did, it just renders Jagex's models using the OpenGL API.
---
Best update ever imo. Game changing in pvm
---
Green tears for the extra salt
---
He truly stands alone
---
Every main account is also strong. Voiders are also insanely strong, often thought as being stronger. I'd say my zerk is stronger than pures any day. 
---
Pures wouldn't even use the chaps/vambs in wild most likely, as the cost would sore. It's a pvm item and fashionscape. 
---
I can understand that people have opinions that pures are overpowered, but it's simply not true.
---
The prices of bonds are determined by supply and demand, therefore 3rd party rwt is always going to be cheaper than buying legit bonds from jagex.
---
Can we have a head pat option now?
---
Sorry was in a bad mood. The joke went way over your head
---
I'd love to see my entire history but I realize that wouldn't be possible. I think the max possible amount without seeing performance issues would be nice, around 75 or 100 even.
---
Grumble grumble polygon count grumble grumble engine work
---
Since you do sand you could collect the bowstring from seers’ (kandarin diary) around 14k a day.
---
Awe. Good for Framed!
---
Why wouldn't you check what's new update wise to see what's new in the game? Even if it means a few months backlog. Even if it's just reading the titles of most (oh look a new quest 'i don't do them so I won't read about it' sort of thing) I'd suggest checking any qol updates because those tend to effect everyone - just like this one. Boo boo I didn't read the top post on the FRONT PAGE now my account is ruined. I'd understand if it's someone coming back in say 3 months time from now, but it's not really an excuse when the update happened yesterday.
---
&gt; Why is it that people get 95+ Slayer, if Konar assigns all other slayer monsters besides hydras more often
---
Because slayer is fun and you still have a chance at getting Hydra.
---
&gt; Also why is it Nieve/Steve and Duradel assign Drakes,Wyrms but not Hydras
---
To give a reason to use Konar
---
&gt; Konar task weigh is not accurate it says 10 for Hydra
---
It's accurate
---
Well, yeah I think the pvp hate runs similar to pure hate. In my experience for deep wild pking however, the defence of characters ranges wildly.
---
NHing is pretty popular amongst characters with 40+ defence, and those that do NH tend to like pking in wildly. This is anecdotal though :/ 
---
And of course I can't dent that 1 def pures do pk very very often, usually I see groups of 1-2 pures at a time killing skillers or pvmers.
---
Real question is, why is she wearing a skirt when it has snowed?
---
LOL
---
tbf if you weren't intentionally exploiting the combat level mechanic then you wouldn't consider a bit of attack xp to "ruin" an account.
---
 Nah they do polls just don’t pass often. For the amount of pkers in the community they attempt to help enough
---
Can i get some of that humanity for my banned accounts? 
---
And the majority of players are immensely inefficient. Justify it however you want, I won't stop anyone from doing gargs, but assuming you know what you're doing in terms of efficiency, you're gonna block gargs fairly early in your account's progression
---
But consistency is key to games being overall healthy. Randomly set requirements with no consistency is just poor design. 
---
Plus there are tons of items in old-school RuneScape that didn't exist previously.
---
"your" too stupid. The irony.
---
Damm son can you imagine grinding that 9 rc again
---
Ahhhhhh didnt know that
---
I believe 72 is the highest quest requirement, which is for Making Friend with My Arm. You can boost with a d pick at 72 though.
---
I think the highest achievment diary is 85 to mine runite for the wildy diaries.
---
haha to each their own.. i usually listen to anime~~
---
I feel the flax is a bit out of the way considering I only grab the sand on my way to nmz to get the herb boxes. I could use a cammy tab instead of catherby tele on my first farm run of the day though I suppose. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll throw it in a few runs, every little helps aye.
---
Thanks guys for the support!
---
I see that Jagex is polling a trade history increase to 40.  Vote yes!
---
99 is good goal tbh.
---
Tbh you aren’t missing out to much. I’ve had a 60 attack and a 75 attack zerker. The consistant 0s make pkin much less fun
---
Congratulations! You've just advanced a Breastfeeding level!

Its not an obligation to read every single update, and this kind of update should be WAY more clear for everybody. Take a wild guess why Jagex is helping us out post-update you fking nutheads.. God damn the stupidity in these comments.. 
---
A fair statement.
---
Sometimes I think Jagex wants them there.  On the off chance that somebody gambles their money away and then maybe they'll buy a bond...

tHiS wOuLD cHaNgE tHe pVp mEtA if you can’t beat a 1 def pure on a med or main you suck at pking black dhide is op af against pures and if pures are allowed to get other items that are def locked they would risk more so it would take care of all your brainlets Saying pures don’t risk anything just because you don’t like a pure build doesn’t mean you should be so saulty against people who like to pk with that build

So I really want to start doing Barrows, but I’m a little confused magic defense works. Since most of the brothers have shit magic defense, do I really care about stacking my magic atk? All I care about is magic dmg bonus and prayer bonus, right?

---
They didn't force you to buy a million vials.
---
You need to google what "chance" means buddy because it seems like you think it adds up
---
Some people who are addicted to the game and has been for years managed to get laid but didnt use protection because it wasnt a NH-lay and thus sired themselves a human whelp, and while PKing and meeting someone they find rather easy to kill they deduct that this particular player isnt as good as them at the game thus requiring less playtime and therefore they ask you if you could babysit for them, since they are better at the game and more invested in that world and you are better at reality and thus more invested there.
---
Glad I could illuminate the situation for you, comrade.
---
The best mining goal is the absolute minimum possible
---
Attack styles are still on attack mode by default. They haven't fixed shit.
---
Framed account isnt a zerk it's a main 
---
Because they don't use google chrome duh
---
It’s because when you equip the auto cast weapon it checks to see if you can still cast the spell (which you probably cant without the free fire runes from tome. A temporary fix would to be just carry a few fire runes on you then it shouldn’t happen or just switch in the right order.
---
It probably wouldn’t be worth it, but if you’re bored of a regular dag task then go ahead. Better to use ibans on standard spellbook but ancients would get the job done as well.

Obv I'm a dude. Posting here on an alt because my normal username can be linked to me in real life, but I post here daily. Most of you have probably upvoted my posts at one point or another. But yeah, I'm old, and I'm a virgin, and while it doesn't bother me much anymore, it's really bad to call people virgins as an insult or to make fun of them for being virgins. Incels are bad not because they are virgins but because they just blame women for their cause. Make fun of them for their shitty beliefs, not because they are virgins.
---
But seriously, that's all I have to say. Please think before using virgin as an insult. It's just a state of being, that of having not had sex, and every single one of you were a virgin at some point in time. Thanks for reading. I love all y'all anyway.
---
I don't use runelite I ping using a basic cmd script, I'd say that's pretty accurate. 
---
That ring better be BIS or else she aint gonna wear it
---
So this OP is lying? In any case, there are still false bans within various different offence categories and people are forced to spam social media because perm bans can't be appealed. 
---
Did you have authenticator, 2FA for your account AND your email?

‘Doctor blunt’ on the hat got me good

He didn't discover it through 3rd party clients, the person is talking about people knowing the first spot before it got released
---
Complaining that MA2 is locked behind wilderness content is like complaining that a Fire cape is locked behind PvM boss content. It impedes my pking progress to go do PvM content. 
---
He's genuinely soooo loocky.

What the fuck are you on about?
---
Does anyone else feel like Ayiza leaving the OSRS team has had a negative effect over the past few months?
---
Cheers from Iraq!
---
Probably :P I tend to watch them Thursday mornings with breakfast though.
---
Fucking learn you whiney little twerp.
---
is it fine for me to keep training my str or will that delay the process? 
---
And you stroke her pussy
---
Gets recoiled.
---
By browsing for them? It’s probably the real set and obviously in game and not used elsewhere. They probably have a similar naming scheme “birthday_iron_armor_helm” etc..
---
Lol can only get 67 range at Max so saving for when I pk
---
Maybe they just sick of your lack of game filter. 
---
So everybody, just Ree with me
---
i pk a fair bit and i’d put my money on msb and dclaws, (you wouldn’t use dscimmy)
---
Probably bluestacks
---
Yea I've kinda been looking into that. the 85 magic everyone says you need is a pretty rough requirement for me, though.
---
If you don't mind me asking, how'd you bounce back from it? Like after this, I just cant even bring myself to log into an alt and try again. I just dont have the heart to do it right now, you know?   I love this game, but after this I just can't wrap my head around how to feel.  honestly maybe i'm taking it a little hard because My gf started playing the game with me, we quest together and that's some of the most fun i've had in the game in a long time. We were going for quest capes lol  
---
Device—&gt;restart.
---
Raids are dungeoneering but they're more fun because you don't have to grind xp.
---
Not even close

You just summarised 90% of the community

Everybody who disliked dung always says it’s more like a mini game than a skill — as if most people aren’t training firemaking exclusively through WT, or making repeat runs to altars in the wildy or in a house to train prayer, or running around all of RuneScape, killing randomly assigned monsters to train slayer, or sitting at a tree and chopping it for 100s of hours, etc., I could go on. 
---
Dung was fun. Dung was more involved a skill than literally anything else in the game, and even better, it’s core mechanics encouraged working together and engaging with other players, who are also training the skill. If you didn’t like it, you complained that it shouldn’t be a skill (so you wouldn’t have to train it), and it’s that simple. 
---
Opinions like yours are the reason we got a skill proposal like warding, and it’s so void of any fresh or exciting content for the game, that everybody who basically begged the community — to at least give it a chance and see what the mods come up with, they don’t even want it anymore. 
---
The only thing dung really needed, was a better way to train the skill outside of daemonheim, and slightly toned down rewards that didn’t offer essential items for training, basically all other skills. BiS weapons on release was a questionable move too. They can be good, but not the best weapons in game lol. 
---
Oh well. Guess we’ll just keep the same tired ol’ skills, and when the whole of the community has nearly maxed, we’ll just go down the road of RS3 or stagnate into irrelevancy I guess.
---
Start reading updates when they come out.
---
Thanks :) 
---
So we can get a little reversed xp
---
Have you had the email you used for the account for a long time, someone may have access to your email. Do you have 2fa on your email as well?
---
Ill tell you a secret: theres 2 keys on your keyboard named alt and tab. Press those at the same time and discover a secret....
---
What happened? Cannot find anything about it anywhere :o, not able to login for a week... :(
---
Thanks!
---
Took this meme to heart huh
---
Can you give us a teeny little hint? :D
---
But then it would have to lower your highest skill since tears raises your lowest. Guthix is about balance. As all things should be.
---
You wouldn’t. That’s why the ability to freeze xp is a problem 
---
is there anyway to check if i posted on forum post? pretty sure i did but id like to know for sure.
---
I’m not the only one??!!
---
Or look for the big red pointy things.
---
Dude needs therapy.
---
Yeah I’m a little cynical after playing for 15 years lol
---
mid 2015, my first exposure to it was back when nmz was hot and the logout timers changed. Got a 2 day and took it for granted. Ban expired. Quit the game after I got 99 hp and came back a few months ago, played legit up until recently. It was super fulfilling to get from 70 slayer (where i picked back up after I started again) to 91 on my own. Classes started and haven't had the same time to invest into the game. Having tasted those bad gains before I resorted to that. I knew the risk, I messed up. I've only myself to blame here, guess this post was kind of just a knee jerk reaction, and an apology to the community. 
---
Don't know, it is in temple tracking 
---
I'm fairly unexperienced with OSRS and am quite confused after logging in today, first time after the update.
---
Yesterday I started training melee in the Varrock Sewers (50+ in all three stats and hitpoints). Wishing to log out I moved to the cutable net just right of the Red Spiders, as that seems like a safe spot (Moss Giants had already lost aggro due to the time I've been there). Today I log in to see me at Lumbridge with most of  my equipment gone. Does that mean that somehow something aggro'd me and I've died? I was fairly sure I was safe at where I was. Or might it have to do something with the update?
---
Report as a bug in game so testers get an official notification.

Lol good god. Youre a pussy and a virgin.

PS how do i add a flair to my posts??
---
Everyone should read the gnome childs dialogue. It's lit 
---
Do you lose holiday items past 30 wildy? Or do they go back to draynor?
---
No what they're saying is the reason for doing so.
---
With the rise in f2p due to mobile, they're trying to visually emphasise the huge content increase of going p2p.
---
Is it really that big of a deal to *You?*
---
Yes, and Jagex updated it roughly when OSRS came out on mobile. They expected a lot of new players and made a few minor tweaks to make their experience smoother.
---
That’s because it’s new. Lol

**\*Lowest skill ends up being RC due to 0 XP\***
---
Pures are a major hindrance to new players who want to check out PvP.  I started playing a couple months ago and every venture into a BH world ends up being miserable when I'm in rune melee and there's people in my level bracket with rcbs hitting 15s.  I haven't tried since unlocking overheads this week but before it was like, why bother.  At low levels a pure can drop a main so fast you barely register what happened
---
We dont live in 19. That’s 2000 years ago smh
---
Do you really think you're going to change MrNutHugger69 that Shrek is a good presidential candidate because of Shrek? NO. Never.

well I just went to check on one of my alts to decide what direction I was taking it and wanted to review my p2p skills.

is it a big deal? not really.

do I care? definitely.

RS3 brought back duel anywhere so I wouldn't mind OSRS doing the same. It would just be for safe Duels and they could probably make it so stats go back to pre-fight values or something to prevent exploits for healing or such. It would be nice to see, but I doubt is a big priority. Also, perhaps it would be best to limit to certain "Dueling" worlds since it could be a bit weird on every world.
---
Is that why I don't have a ddefender anymore? I don't play very often but I was feeling super gaslighted
---
Likely wouldn't even be accurate. Prices for these kinds of items are all over the place.
---
I loved it
---
Just practice a bunch now while they're up, learning a boss then not fighting it for a while will still put you way ahead of trying it for the first time live
---
Tip: don't kill black demons anywhere or ever except demonics.
---
So in a word, yes
---
I don't think that's correct, afaik QP only extends the amount of time you get to do it for whilst the exp per tear is capped at 60 exp when your lowest level skill is 30 or more
---
Ah. My bad if I fell for it. 
---
Why are you using Tome with Iban's? It's just acting as an expensive fire rune without the damage increase...
---
If you see this flier it’s happening soon. Always eastern standard time.

What else if I may ask. Like I 100% will start doing birdhouse runs for hunter xp are there any other good passive XP’s for skills? I will also be doing tree runs.

Nice thanks

No, but some people really like weed and enjoy talking about it with others.... why is that so hard for some people to understand?

I really wish the Wildy Elite applied the "always cut webs" to all weapons and not just the Wildy Sword. Or maybe it could let us cut down those trees...
---
A 13th century relic such as this wouldn't maintain such genuine condition, back in those days they're mithril was far more blue tinted. I'd know, I was there. Just ask my buddy who's an expert in time travel.
---
Okay, but who cares about that? 
---
Why did you block out your stats?
---
yeah but what about people that come back to the game? they have no clue.
---
Holy shit I’m excited!
---
Upvoted for mediocre stats like mine
---
&gt; 2 def &gt; 1 def because it doesn't effect your cb level if you're maxed. So what if the majority think 1 def is cooler? Coolness is irrelevant, its the performance that matters.
---
Who are you to decide what matters more? If the person wants to stay at 1 def and he gets fucked over by something that's not his fault then it's complete bullshit. Are you being deliberately thick or wtf do you not understand?
---
Roll tide

if you point out a difference between then and now you're obviously crying bro! /s

I can just pick it up before it shows to anyone else, why would I be worried.

How is he being annoying?

Trash acc anyway lol

Lol, buddy

You have no idea how they solved it. They've provided no details at all.

There are a million and one ways to make sure third-party clients can't be used to solve things like CTC.

Don’t get why you’d amass such a collection but more power to ya, friend. Hope someone wants to buy it. 
---
I was just going by my playtime on the website when I recovered it, its probably more. The website tells you your total play time. 
---
Barb fishing on the Ironman. Just started that grind last night
---
Finally did Monkey Madness; accidentally added 10 extra minutes to the quest by making the Zombie greegree with my first talisman.
---
It does not work for the quest; you have to be a Karamjan monkey.
---
It cannot even run.
---
When I get home from work today I'm going to finish up 70 Prayer.
---
The clue hasn't been released yet. So unless they hacked a jmods email account or they dug on every game tile in the world, yes they're abusing a third party client.
---
Oh yea! I always forget about that. I'm like 33 and I like skilling so I'll probably do it anyway I've just been putting it off. But I'm definitely gonna buy the flatpack for the time being. 
---
OW!
---
This was my point yes
---
They should just make an item or something where you can deactivate exp for certain skills if you want

Got an audible chuckle out of me

I agree, I think it should be like this:
---
Easy: Reduced fail chance at cutting web with sword
---
Medium: Never fail cutting web with sword
---
Hard: Reduced fail chance with any weapon
---
Elite: Never fail with any weapon.
---
Way overthinking it

Found with reverse image search.
---
As other's have said, no need for guthan's as you will only really need it for the waves of mages+rangers and they hit hard with melee so it kind of defeats the purpose. Blowpipe spec will heal you. I suggest bringing another bastion and 3 pray/restore pots. Other than that, an identical setup to mine. You also have higher def/pray than I did so should be easy
---
&gt; or they dug on every game tile in the world
---
And you know they didn't do this how...?
---
Now hold up buckaroo did you know that if you level fishing to 99 via barbarian fishing you could save yourself the hassle of manually leveling to 65 strength? Talk about saving you from wasting time by not being xp efficient, you can thank me by western unioning me 5,000 schrute bucks at your earliest convenience.

Take some bong rips and make cool cool iron man content. Or maybe learn pking on a new build. Try to fall in love with the game again. Plus you said you like to watch the numbers go up. They are going to be rolling in your early levels lol

There is an old glitch i'm aware of where someone drops an item on yours and it makes it disappear not sure exactly how it works; I thought it would be fixed by now.

Not really tbh, there are tons of people that use their pures for other activities and locking them in BH worlds would just cause a mess.

Are you trolling?

How badly would gaining 1 level in deff really mess up a pure?

Oh gotcha, for sure.  Never assumed you were talking shit, all good brothah

OWO
---
I'm not saying it wasn't done with RuneLite. I'm saying we have no idea how it was done.
---
Plus, the team are more than capable of hiding information from third-party clients. So, why wouldn't they? And why is it any more likely that they would make that blunder than someone brute forcing it?
---
That's the best one, IMO. 
---
As a lefty, i would like the choice.
---
Could it be... exactly for this reason? No it couldn't be.
---
forgot the username and couldn't find it anywhere on the subreddit so i thought the mods removed it.  
---
my bad, thanks for tagging me.
---
That's not the point...
---
he got caught up in the moment. you know how it is
---
My advice usually is based/taliored to the OP asking. Dude comes across as lazy and nonsensical. He got a shit post for advice, that isnt technically wrong. 
---
Clue was leaked 30 minutes ago, meaning the person that originally found the URL of the clue more than likely knew of it before 30 minutes ago and told some lads that put their brains together to figure it out.
---
Actually set up my hotkeys, good idea, thank you.
---
70 something agility too! You still need to do a fuck load to get full graceful, but who cares! It's efficient! 
---
Was jk, just found all of the other skills barring cmb stats pretty funny :p but in all seriousness I hope you gl on the firecape grind whoever owns this account. You got it :) 
---
blocking tasks is for stuff you will basically never want to do. skipping is for when you run out of blocks (because the maximum amount of different task blocks is 5 or 6) or it's a task that doesn't show up often.  
---
e.g. if you don't like doing iron dragons and they have 1% chance and you don't like doing steel dragons which have 10% chance, then it makes more sense to block steels and skip irons.  
---
if you look at it in the long run, if you are trying to get as many points and slayer XP as you can per hour then you would probably get more from doing the fast tasks and skipping the harder tasks that you don't like.  
---
lets use your ice giants as an example. for some players, it may be quicker to skip them, lose 30 points, and then gain 40 points from chaeldar (4 tasks) than do the ice giants if they're really slow. both situations give you +10 points than before the task, but the first one also puts you closer to your 10th task bonus, gives more XP and more drops.  
---
bronze/iron/steel dragons are a good example of this. they're slow to kill because of their high defence and their common drops are usually not very valuable. at least with normal dragons they also drop dragonhide and are easier to kill, but no ones going to be picking up 5 iron bars from each kill though.
---
you're also right that if you can't fight them you don't have to skip them, you can just train normal combat until you can. just depends on how badly you want to level up slayer.
---
I've thought about this a lot...
---
Can never train Hunter or Fishing
---
Can't train ranged outside of throwing knives or thrownaxes (feathers) or use virtually any ranged armor
---
Can only kill sentient beings
---
Can't wear amulets (ball of wool)
---
Idk what's up with the hostility. This was a bug. Apart from your normal preferred attack style not being saved, it defaulted back to "attack", like it used to in the past. This bug also gave some people defence xp even though the attack style wasnt set to "defence".
---
Don't want to accidentally put in content people don't want /s
---
Would actually make sense. 
---
Thanks for your kind words. 
---
Swampletics
---
Nah. Another player just picked up the items
---
That creates the exact same problem. Instead of waiting for a few seconds for them to attack and auto retaliate to kick in you want me to take a few seconds to run to my next target. Theres no way to justify this mechanic
---
I’d focus on training slayer it’s great in the long run (also do the Varrock museum mini quest)
---
Smh silly jamfloss 
---
One person is paying the other gold
---
yeah this is a good point, i avoid using halberds completely for this reason but i'll buy one now to change the option. thanks.
---
If anything, it shows that the support team puts about as much time looking into inappropriate usernames as they do account recoveries... next to none. They just do whatever then let the players deal with the consequences.
---
I'm rude for asking him to tell us what happened while he's clearly trying to sweep it under the rug? Lmao, nice one. He's only trying to help after it blew up on reddit which is the fucking problem I'm talking about. 
---
VM is still 0 time ash, though. Assuming you get 99 mining through VM you're looking at 88k~ ash gained in 0 time, which is more than enough ash to last you a lifetime lol
---
&gt;  I'm at 63 slayer at the moment and it's really making it terrible to level up getting the same dull tasks over and over

Get used to it.

---
It's not that great of an idea tho
---
For pvp. What's the point of playing this game if you dont pvp? To fight mindless npcs over and over do that you can get end game item drops? And then use those otem drops to fight more mindless npcs? I play for pvp and anything else is a means to an end. It's sort of like getting on halo and fighting skirmishes. You just log on and go fight other pures. It's pretty fun and exciting. 
---
yes im using the free week trial from mobile 
---
thanks ill check those out
---
First of all ask yourself: what do you even need cash for right now? If you don't actually need cash for supplies I would suggest doing some farm runs whilst training combat stats at sand crabs or whilst doing slayer.
---
I would suggest a goal of 75 mage/ranged as this lets you do barrows at a pretty decent rate and even at lower levels makes ~800k an hour.
---
What you'll find is that training combat/doing quests etc is the quickest way to get a decent bank as if you're doing skilling it will take 50 hours minimum before you start getting decent returns. 
---
If you are super low on cash however, get your herblore to 30 and then buy rannarr weeds, make unfinished potions and then sell them on the g.e. It'll make you about 200-300k an hour if you only have a small cash stack (as opposed 600k+ when you can buy a full hours supplies at once) but I know that's probably still a really decent amount for you.
---
there's a dude called "Gay Shit", look it up on the hiscores
---
I know they are easy but waiting for the auto retaliate just takes forever most of the time. I know it probably only adds up to a couple extra minutes on your task but its just annoying and pointless. No where else do you have to deal with this mechanic which makes this one really stick out 
---
What do after 60 
---
I thought that only worked zamorak plates? 
---
&gt; I prefer the female arma helm over the ridiculous looking male one. 
---
Agreed.
---
&gt;Why make all armour look the same between genders?
---
Disagreed. Male characters should be able to use Armadyl without looking like a plucked chicken.
---
What, why did you want 4 of them 😂
---
Where is the blue moon inn?
---
&gt;It's heartbreaking to have that taken from you in a rapid moment of pure greed and perceived opportunism. Stay safe, play smart, and never trust something that sounds too good to be true, because it simply isn't.
---
Well said. You noticed your fault and you're passing on what you've learned.
---
You'll make the money back man. When I was newer to osrs (must have been late 2015), I fell for the elemental workshop one; I lost an acb, sotd, and dfs (a lot to me at the time). I was heart broken, how could I be so stupid? But instead of being upset and quitting, I took being scammed as motivation to learn Zulrah (best gold in game at the time).
---
You'll get it back man.
---
He has a post about trading rs3 gold to osrs gold on his account, I'm not sure, but I think that breaks the RWT rules. 
---
Why was it even polled? Just fix it, its more of a graphical error than a game breaking change
---
Studded armour for a stud ;)
---
Whats the gloves
---
Oh god I wish
---
It doesn't matter. When your stats/bank/etc are stored in the DB you have an unique identifying value. It doesn't matter if it is numeric, it only needs to be unique.
---
Are you aware there’s a server for VM? It’s easy to find teams

Bring about 8 brews and ~16 super restores. Prioritize not taking damage over wasting prayer

Sorry, but IDK what you mean by flavor. I also had to install Ubuntu, if that's what you mean. I haven't touched it since I was banned.

Pretty decent idea.

Double the average per patch isn’t lucky? Lol

I get maybe 1 diseased herb per 5 runs, it's definitely worth doing them all imo

Because new design looked worse, prefer old one, simple

That’s so lame. I never realized that.
---
What is there to confirm. Are the IPs the same or aren't they. If they are then it's case closed. 
---
I'm for negative xp lamps, but restricting xp in some skills would make some builds extremely op. Obby Maulers would become the new berserker pure as they can new use range forever instead of maxing it out at 60-65, it would be a shit show.

Also, I could set to deposit 1,5,10,X,all on mobile and just one click deposit all my monkfish while keeping the fishing net. On desktop I have to right click to deposit all the fishes without depositing the net. That’ll be a nice addition to desktop for QoL.

The rest of the pieces are probably limited to F2P zones too.
---
B0aty is the only person to call it 'One man army' so B0aty is heavily implied. You also said that's how Ironman "began" rather than rose to popularity.

Ah very true, didn't even think about that, good point!

What so you mean a margin in this sense?

You don't understand the ramifications of the old if you think this is the worst outcome.
---
So I should be using that instead of Trident at Barrows at 80 magic?

It took me a short while to get up to rune, maybe like 2-3 hours. So when I was going for the dragon defender I figured I may as well get a butt load of token so I dont have to keep leaving to get more. Got it on my first kill and now I have 4.5k warrior guild tokens that I have no idea what to do with.
---
If you’re talking about the Graceful outfit you buy it at the rouges den with marks or grace.
---
Truth. Going back to Alchemical Hydra and get some claw drops. 
---
Then there's me, who fills his inventory up with saplings and rune pouch to humidify them all, and realize I'm on ancients from bursting. That switch to watering can is a bank swap of shame.
---
Wouldn't it be negative xp in your highest skill, to maintain balance? 
---
This game doesn’t give me much happiness and I still play it. It’s like im... addicted or something
---
touche'  for sure and with imbued mage cape its a 38 barrage instead of 37.  But yeah the surge is good for combos in max team fights but for focusing it's almost useless because 7 second freezes. Soloing it's okay if you are elite as fuck at the game otherwise if someone on ancients fights back you are up against it. So with way less inventory, way more risk, lower dps, shit freezes, basically contradicts everything i said in OP. Lol I spent last few days soloing at west drags on my 60 att 103cb to test shit out and yeah if i get a 15 sec tangle I can usually drop someone quickly but if the first freeze is 7 seconds, they are into the wizzys before i can get another freeze and then theyre at the ditch and RIP. I think rushing in PVP worlds is only real application of standards that is feasible.

You can just lock barrow gloves with a defense requirement like private servers have been doing for over a decade

If what you say is true, how have you made it this far if such trivial things bother you? I have a very hard time believing that any long term player would have serious issues with the interface. 
---
My bad. I watched it then. Was amazing!
---
because people that don't pk still think somehow it unlocks 'overpowered' content to pures like the abyssal whip, and low hp rushers.  
---
both of which already exist within the game (although temporally as they gain xp) and they're not very good.
---
Herb runs with ranaar will make you tons of gold even at 51

I mean no one is saying to like grinding but I really don't get how buying 200m in gear and buying BIS for PVM is fun. At that point its literally just grinding kills and raids 
---
Hey, I've been bothering you on Twitter for a while to look at my account too. Display name is "afk rs acc". It got banned for botting like 2 hours after I made it even though I wasn't botting.

Ah. Yup. It’s called graceful. You get it from grace in the basement of the bar in burthorpe.

If you read, I clearly said I get why people would buy gold instead of farm vorkath for 10 to 15 hours. It's buying gold every time you need it I don't get bc like what's the point if all thst money if you're just gonna grind PVM in BIS? Or stake it in duel arena? 
---
“So how much do you want for it?”
---
“Well you heard the guy, 2-8k!”

Exactly why stackable clues isn't a good idea. Perhaps if it isn't stackable, it'll occupy bankspace and could work as a motivator for not hoarding hundreds of clues. It's just for quality of life if you've done the ranger boots grind - that brief moment of pause everytime you open a jar to check. Ultimately, the time taken for the entire grind remains the same. You're only eliminating the need to rebank/withdraw 5 jars at a time.
---
And of course, you cannot complete clues simultaneously.
---
Were in the endgame now
---
turn the other cheek
---
It's not always, and maybe I've been getting really lucky consistently. Even if I have, it just seems like too of a high ceiling imo for no compost. 
---
No Mimic warning please :)
---
This is the guy you fight in Zaros gwd
---
Oh I agree, I'm totally in favor of these updates coming through. It's just a somewhat roundabout way of saying that these updates to clues are a great time to address these plugins and whether or not they should exist. 
---
How do you mean?

Jagex typically has a zero tolerance policy on botting.

Memorizing clues are quicker then using the plug-in an having to open your map. The puzzle box plug-in should be removed tho.
---
It all comes down to who reports you. I saw someone the other day just named Cat Shit. 
---
If you have blowpipe you can range nmz pretty efficiently. Otherwise, you could invest into chinchompas and chin in the mm1 or mm2 caves.  Chinning is much faster but more costly. 
---
You also have to reach the tier though. Let’s say it’s 20 elite clues for 1 elite reroll. If you’ve done 20 elites you’ve pry done a fair amount of the necessary requirements. This time you just don’t have to do one you don’t enjoy. That’s how I see it anyway.

Love the sound of all the new rewards. Would love to see more colours for firelighters and whips, maybe even firework items to use to help celebrate with friends their big achievements, Recolours for dragon-hunter lance, on the extreme side maybe even slight ornamental barrows cosemtic kits? The cosmetics unlocked through treasure trails have always been some of my favorite pieces of content. 
---
It's really cool seeing a piece of gear that holds its value based on being rare and really nice looking. 
---
My personal favorite kind of items though are emote enhancers, transformation items and animation changers. I know they are more dev time to create but they really spice up the game. 
---
Obligatory "make gnomish firelighters hold all coloured firelighters please" suggestion.
---
Stackable clues **killed** treasure trial item prices on RS3. Such a stupid and not oldschool-like update. Sad to see people being happy about it here, reminds you that the community mostly consists of people that can't look further than short term personal profit.

To distinguish clue scrolls, don't color the whole thing, but add like a colored ribbon with the existing colors for clue bottles. Like the ribbon around the clues in clue nests

I was mining iron at the mining guild last night and a group of 3 crowded me and told me to leave. They each took a rock and was trying to bully me to leave. I didn't answer them and kept mining. I was getting about 40% of the rocks I attempted to mine. They told me they were reporting me for botting, when clearly I was fighting for each and every rock. I'm a pretty stubborn guy and mined what I could and dropped the ores for about 25 mins. Eventually, they realized what effort they were putting into delaying my xp rates were multiplied by 3 for them. They called me names and each left one by one. I didn't say one word to them.

Yee, another crack the clue! This is why I like the devs and this game, stuff like this.
---
Agreed, it should be like being able to use fairy rings without the staff for lumby elite
---
&gt; Why didn't Jagex just implement this new update without changing the attack style from what it was before?  
---
Because if they could they would, people just assume programming is easy when they have no idea that even visually simple changes like adding commas to examining stacked items can be difficult under the surface due to poor original code.  
---

People can meme all they want about "engine work" but it's true at least in some degree. You can tell which people know nothing about IT by the responses like "EnGiNe WoRk" or "just hire more QA people 4Head".  
---
&gt; This is no players fault.  
---
If you use plugin that warns you that you are using the wrong attack style and you ignore it, how is that not your fault. Incorrect XP makes sense because you shouldn't expect to gain attack XP on aggressive, but after that was fixed and you have in red letters "Accurate" on your screen, explain why you should not expect to get attack XP.  
---
Because if the fault is entirely on Jagex, then every restricted combat account would have have been ruined. That is why there is blame on both sides, because fucking up your account means you didn't pay enough attention, because if there are people with restricted accounts that managed to not ruin their accounts, how do you think that happened? By magic?

Snape grass is a high level allotment.. it should be able to be made into super compost 
---
But Jagex's system is so far from perfect they can't even comprehend what the word means
---
Was it the problem was different xp showing on different attacks, or was it the problem with logging on resetting you back to the 1st attack style?
---
Hey bud, you wanna like fuck off with your spoilers? 
---
It sounds like those rerolls are pretty locked, requiring a certain number of clues to have been completed before they are available. If you've done, say, 50 master clues and then you get a reroll slot, then you likely have most of the reqs by then.
---
I like the concept of a mimic but it should be very rare like 1 in 100 caskets. Really unsure how it would be implemented though, it seems like it would be a pain to have to gear up before you open a casket.
---
I think the best solution would be to have the mimic swallow you and have it work like a random event where you get teleported to an arena and have to do some minigame and as a reward you get some extra rolls on the clue drop table.
---
It heals some health.
---
They once polled this change but it didn’t pass. I’d like them to change it for consistency
---
Filthy statist doesn't understand why some poor people don't vote for astronomical taxes. More at 6

I am saying before they issue a name change they should look into it. If they don't have the time to look into it then bolster the team of people or enhance the technology you're using to check names. If you can't do either then don't issue a name change. It's that simple.

---
I'd go with the RS3 system of "Sealed Clues". You could only have 1 active clue like it currently works, but when one is done you could open a new clue to make it active. You could still open one, drop, and open another to clue juggle and such if you wanted but you couldn't have multiple hard clues active at a time.
---
Isnt it a tax on winning? So hes won 2.6 trillion?
---
I just don't really follow the logic or any point being made here lol.  It's not like clue drop rates are changing.  If I get 3 elite clues from Zulrah in an hour, nobody in the world is going to throw their hands up and be like "Well fuck now I have *too much* content to do" lol?
---
Like I guess put in a stack cap? Not that it'll make any difference at all but many of you seem to think the placebo affect of "Not seeing so many clue scrolls" will...encourage you to do them?
---
Idk.
---
Doesn't seem to change ANYTHING except for convenience imo.  Now you can just pick up your 3 hard clues on a greater demom task without having to stop and complete the clue mid-task so you don't miss the next clue drop.
---
I didn't think of this. Thanks for posting. Needs to be updated for awareness. Non stacking clues but having multiple ones sounds decent. Capped by back space

Recipe for Disaster is a major questing goal people work towards. Unlocks BiS gloves for ranged and 2nd bis for melee and magic. Working towards that might be a good idea.

Or the mimic could teleport you to an instance that has bank access, so you can gear up before fighting it in that instance.
---
I go so back on forth on this. While on one hand, you're right that it can change the dynamic, there's no reason it *has* to. You could easily still do one clue at a time when you get it.
---
Thank you! Tip of my tongue moment there

No Rerolls!

Lmfao oh poor you losing items that you willingly brought into the only place in the game where you can lose them

Thoughts:
---
F2P clues are cool, but I think a clue tutor is dumb. Clues feel like a sort of thing that pops up out of nowhere with no other information or extra help in how to process it, like a cryptic message or a map with an x on it. X marks the spot quest kind of acts as a clue scroll tutorial too, which is what I thought they were going for. I wouldn't want a beginner clue as a reward either but I don't feel strongly about that.
---
Stacking clues is a STRONG no-go for me. Stacking caskets is a super cool idea though. Maybe prevent people from taking it to entrana though? Idk.
---
Elites need good rewards.
---
So that's why I gained like 500 atk xp on my zerk, I'm a mobile only player so I had no idea about this, I don't read many updates lol. I honestly thought I did something that changed atk style but it's was on their end, now I don't feel bad at all.
---
I mean that really sucks but why ever switch to melee pray? 
---
because else who decides what's being polled and not? If this isn't polled, why would EOC not be polled?

---
All fun and games until you realize that it tanks all the clue scroll rewards. Having stackable clues forces you to stockpile them and do them all at once for efficiency reasons, defeating the purpose of having it as a diversion.
---
I don't think it would be outrageous to say these people are the exception, not the norm
---
I would totally dig this idea but hard clues are generally more efficient than elites anyways and hardly anyone does them. If this happened, I reckon they'd be even less popular. 
---
Don't get triggered by my jokes.
---
I don't think that's a easy task considering I have 85 combat

shearing literally KILLS sheeps bro haven't you seen the PETA ad
---
Hate to burst your balloon but they do in fact reduce weight.  You just can't see it due to decimal trimming
---
I do like the stacking limit and wonder if you got 2 or more clues that all have the same step if doing that step will count for them all. I could see that messing up value if someone has a full inventory of medium clues or something and can grind them much faster 
---
If the Mimic looks like a casket, upon killing it, there should be a chance to get the mimic’s body upon killing it, then maybe you could do something to the mimic’s body to make it into the casket helmet, the drop rate for this could be really low, like that of obtaining a pet from pvm

Did they update the number of inferno capes?

Now his is the type of content I like to see from this sub

That mimic idea is so cool wtf

They just hotfixed it then, thank god

I'm not actually sure how it works since I don't use the sand casino, if it's 1% taken from both players' bet then that changes it a bit.
---
You doing those all the way to 99 craft? I’m f2p at the moment and have been thinking about doing that method but I’m afraid the xp rates will be too slow.

100% agree with you. Some minor client stuff is borderline necessary, but shit like clue helpers, jad helpers, gorilla prayer indicators, etc etc is WACK as hell. Something needs to be done.

If OSRS is never updated it will die. Any game that’s left to its own devices and has no additional content, especially a time-progression based game like RuneScape, will die.
---
OSRS isn’t 2007 RuneScape anymore. It’s its own game with its own features and path. If you want vanilla 2007, go to a private server, but most of us want a good and updated game that still captures what RuneScape is meant to be.
---
I personally think it should depend on how difficult the boss is. If it's like a modern boss with actual mechanics and a challenging fight then I think a warning is fair. If it's something you can just pray against and kill easily then no warning. Either way, definitely a yes to putting the mimics in the game.

Every Elite I get literally means my boss trip is over because I always do my clues and chuck one Elite to Watson for a Master in my Bloodhound grind.
---
I would prefer the stacking so every trip where an Elite drops, I don't have to worry about not being able to get another Elite soon after.
---
I went back and played DS2 after playing 1 and 3. I was surprised by the lack of mimics and got complacent. That was mistake 1.

Then I presumed that the metal chests in 2 couldn't be mimics. That was mistake 2.

This game would have died without updates and almost did

Mutated bloodvelds aren't even highly sought after spots. You can hop 3 times and find a world. If you're crashing someone there then you're just being lazy.

Especially since i have to do my 95-99 slayer grind would make it super fun

Yeah when I'm playing on my iPhone at work (can't waste xp by working now can I) it gets really annoying. Maybe I need that new Samsung Galaxy Fold so I can have a much larger display for Runescape.

No, only playing on PC. Thought its basically the same mistake...
---
He is right they do flux a lot. Just a short time ago the value was 600m GE price, now its 200m. TT bulk collectors do not usually worry about the GE price as we know they jump up and down a lot. We just know that if they are unique then they usually have a nice premium attached to them. 
---
I think that might have just been moreso due to the declining interest in tradable fashionscape in RS3 - to the extent people engage in it, it's typically through microtransaction stuff and the plain Thessalia clothes you wear when you don't have gear.
---
Also, fortunate components are pretty great and preserve prices. Heck, the Alchemical Onyx might have come out before stackable clues if I remember correctly, which would basically cancel out your whole argument.
---
HOLY CRAP THERE's Zaros(g) oh my that's my favorite god above Zamorak!

Was in there for over 3k tokens for bronze to iron riiip rng

Yes, that would be nicely fitting!

I’ll vote yes if they make Brimhaven dungeon relevant again

Also you need to gain a certain amount of xp or qust points that week to be eligible.
---
Maybe you could toggle the warning? And if you have it toggled off, meaning you have no idea what it'll be, you get a better shot and rewards? 
---
You wouldn't be able to toggle willy-nilly though. It should cost like 5m after one or two.
---
Oh, I was going off the actual definition of feedback, not your invented definition. Saying a bad idea sucks isn't trolling. You're not that bright, are you?

Well there you go, if you even would keep updated on checking emails you would have gotten one about your bank pin being removed/account recovered (unless the hacker knows your personal email details and deleted them)

Is that the crack the clue 2 cloak in your inventory?

It was a result of bad updates, not frequent updates.

Nice strawman.

No words should be "protected". The fuck?? What a horrible slope to slide down. The fact that you don't understand where that path goes shows leads me to believe you eat paint chips to this day. 
---
The point of clue scrolls are that they are a D&amp;D. They are supposed to distract you from the thing you are currently doing. So if you get a clue scroll you can take a break from slayer. If you can collect multiple clue scrolls the distraction aspect isn't there anymore because you can just do the scroll later while also collecting more clues.
---
I knew the second I saw the title it was going to be long af

The TT expansion is pretty much exactly like the RS3 one from last year and that was the best update that game had gotten in YEARS. I'm all for it.
---
I should have been more specific. I just dont want to buy all the rare or higher end stuff from the ge. I want to earn it. I will be doing quests somewhat efficiently by buying most items at ge beforehand.

thats a construction skillcape

No point in playing offline servers, who ru gonna say “FE btw” too? Correct me if I’m wrong, but that is the only reason people play ironman modes to begin with.

It's the brimstone one, +6 mage, +4 range, +4 str (for SGS), and the bonus 10% chance to ignore some mage defence. I wanted an offensive ring but only using it on an archers ring for +4 range seemed a waste

I'm bringing ancestral over bandos because I'm going to be learning the pray flicks over tanking hits, for more consistent runs. Brimstone for the same reason, if I flick well I don't need the defence or pray bonus.

Do you keep your herbs from slayer, cause it saves you money on herblore?

Update Im now 700+ monsters level 89+ with no key. I have 2 sitting in inventory because I want to open a bunch of chests in a row. Any idea if theres a limit on how many you can get?

I agree with this. Set a low cap (2, 3). Enough to reduce the frustration of "ffs i just got here" but not high enough that you can ignore them entirely until you feel like doing them without penalty.

I'd really rather have the dragon hunter crossbow recolors just be using a kbd or vorkath head on the weapon just like a slayer helmet, no clue kits please
---
Disagree. Current "meta" is to ignore clues altogether for the most part. I'd pick them up and save them to do in one big go if I could. Especially hard+ clues that suck to get. 
---
There really is no reason for them not to be a stackable item to begin with, it's just a massive inconvenience. Doing them in bulk when you actually want to is more fun than being forced to do them constantly just to get the next one. 
---
Thanks! When I get off mobile I'll look into it! :D

Imagine balancing the game around an area locked uim rofl.

My biggest worry is the fact that it already only takes no time at all to get easy clues from HAM members (especially if you have a high thieving) and even imps. Players could easily stack hundreds of clues in a single play session. If this passes there definitely has to be some sort of balancing.

Not happy about the stackable clues, this will most likely crash the price of TT items. The only reason this works in RS3 is because invention helps keep the price high for TT items.
---
Everyone at the GE in that picture got PWNed
---
The change is not within specifically just the community, its the direction society and the newer generation of kids have went in. Back in 06-07 and right when OSRS started again in 2013, the game and community simply was not anywhere close to the way it is now. Sure people didnt like getting pked but they knew it was the way the game worked for the most part and that goes for anything that gets hated on in this community.
---
But society and especially the kids who are just turning 17,18,19 now (and younger but I dont think too many kids that age play OSRS) have been coddled to shit and been told all their lives that this is the proper way to act if you dont like something. And theres usually a complete overreaction to even the smallest of things. Its a neo-liberal mindset where if theres something you dont like or agree with, you shout it down, you shame it and you try to take it away from OTHER people who may be fine with it or enjoy it because of your own selfishness. There is no objective and rational discussion where you can come to a middle ground for most, most of the time theres little real discussion at all.
---
Everything is toxic, everything is hate (and coincidently NONE of what these people do is considered to be either by themselves, even though it obviously is) no matter how little or insignificant or if its banter/jokes and if you support something that they deem to be wrong or bad then they wont only attack you for it but theyll try and actively make your experience worse. 
---
Its really quite fucking pathetic and aggravating. Half this community needs to learn you dont ruin or try and prevent others from enjoying the game because you may not be very good or enjoy  one aspect of the game while others are and enjoy that aspect. People need to check their own personal bias' and feelings at the door when it comes to deciding what is going to make the game better for everyone, but thats a lot of maturity and things to ask of some of these people who have an irrational seething hatred for Pkers or think youre going to ruin the nostalgia and the game if new things get added etc.
---
This is actually a good compromise, maybe just replace the examine with “Something seems off about this casket.” Boom, mimic warning for those who take the time and surprise mimic (as that’s what mimics are supposed to be) for anyone who fails the perception check- er I mean fails to examine it.
---
Your analogy suggest OP did something once where he had a high chance of being banned, and I did that same thing once and didn’t get banned.
---
This completely misses the mark... OP did something let’s say 100 times where each time there’s a small chance of being falsely banned. I’ve done that same thing 10,000 times. I can’t tell if everyone is actually this bad at analogies..
---
If you want to tell me this guy is innocent, give me something that’s not irrelevant.

So i back home i installed the authenticator plugin on chrome on laptop

How fo i move the codes from my ios to the chrome ?

Choices allow for variations in playstyle. Lets say you are on a hellhound slayer task, and you got a clue 40 kills into a task of 130. If youre more focused on slayer XP you might hold off until the end of the task and do the hard clue as change of pace. On the other hand, if you are really wanting to hunt clues, like an ironman trying to get blessed dhide boots, you can make the desicion to leave early in hopee of getting more clues in the future. By adding stackable clues, you remove a small decision some people make, and make a small step to a more stale and straightforward game. Why remove the decision to do or not do something, in favor of a clearly superior option?
---
I'm completely against the idea of updates that remove thought, decisions, or varying playstyles.
---
What the fuck OP. Nobody makes me feel my own feels. Nobody....
---
No negative weight???? How dis-graceful.
---
i agree wildy steps are annoying :/
---
btw it’s 30 seconds until it shows up for everyone, and 100 until it vanishes 
---
Almost as bad
---
Authenticator delay would give you enough time to transfer your valuables to a safe alternative account until you can re-secure your main.
---
Also why would someone who actively plays suddenly forget their log in info and want to recover? (Unless they recently had a brain injury) accounts should have a recovery delay.
---
A creature that takes the form of something else to surprise and harm those seeking something of value. Generally video games romanticize the idea of a mimic taking the form of a treasure chest.

I always thought the hands were meant to be from two different people. Like making an exchange.

It's the emptiness that I feel when I look at my friends list, on the other side though, I can see who pokes their head back slowly more names switch from the generated ones to their old names
---
I went in with nearly no tokens cause "screw it" and now I have 5 tokens left in my bank. Iirc they go down by 5 at a time (?) so I never had to go back for any tokens for master clues. That's about the extent of great rng on this char though.

My index finger cramps hard enough at 27. I can’t imagine how bad it will be when I’m older. I’ve been thinking about switching hands and using the mouse with my left hand to give my index finger a break for a while. Mobile also helps out a lot!
---
If you’re just learning, you’re going to mess up. Having tanky armor will let you stay in the Inferno for more waves and use less supplies and thus practice more. If you want to switch off to DPS gear in the future, that’s fine, but right now I’d recommend going in a bit bulkier.
---
G maulers aren't actually primed till around the 70 cb bracket when they reach full damage output, before then obby maulers have the upper hand. I'm talking specifically about the 50-60s bracket which obby maulers run. Most Obbys can max out at 60-63 combat opposed to a gmauler which maxes at 74 without overheads.
---
Dh and d claws
---
Yeah but a big mimic boss is exactly the same as rs3 which sucks
---
Pvmer here, voting no as well as everyone in my clan. 
---
Yeah, this post is definitely a personal opinion based off experience.  
---
As long as clues slow down stuff like efficient training they will always be a chore *regardless* if they stack. 
---
This update now allows people that would have otherwise not have had picked up/completed clues *save* their potential for a later day should they want to do them. 
---
Though OPs points are fair, I don't see them an a sufficient argument against implementing this update other than personal preference/spite. It doesn't negatively affect the game as a whole other than maybe slightly more clue scroll rewars items coming into the market at a later date (which I would bet would be insignificant compared to the current rate)
---
Hey man, I’m plenty of episodes deep already!

Where are you from? I can tell you have an accent, but your English is really, really good!

Stackable clues should not be a thing. By only being aloud to have 1 clue it gives you a break from monotonous tasks but I would love stackable caskets I see no problem there. Also rerolling steps is a no go for me, it helps players level skills they normally would not have gotten or complete quests.
---
Yeah but then you're limiting clue scrolls to just slayer. 
---
I'd disagree a tad with that. Treasure Trails aren't a D&amp;D since that doesn't exist in OSRS; they are still classed as a Minigame. But you can already buy implings to mass clues, which isn't a distraction. And doing clues post-task is still a distraction from Slayer without interrupting you mid-task.
---
Rough luck. Done like 30 chests since i got back and only got a guthan spear, though i had it bad lol
---
Not everyone plays everyday...
---
So.. dont let them stack?.. simple. To me this is a great idea. While i like the break once a while sometimes i just dont want to do them. But why miss out on more clues? Former rs3 player here too love it in rs3 will love it in osrs. Remember youre not force to let them stack nor do more then 1 at a time.. or maybe add a toggle for it
---
That is there fault there is always gullible people which is why there is always sob posts about being scammed at GE.
---
Also why would recovery delay not happen? why would someone who actively plays suddenly forget their log in info and want to recover? (Unless they recently had a brain injury) accounts should have a recovery delay.

Either this or letting you only loot extra clues within the context of a single slayer task would fix most of the problems the naysayers have with the idea while still getting the meat of it, really.
---
It just feels really terrible having to either unnecessarily leave a task or permanently miss out on a drop you could have gotten. Sure, the player gets to choose which bad thing happens to them, but the player choosing something certainly doesn't make it good gameplay.
---
mimics come from tabletop rpgs originally
---
If your preference is doing the clue right when you get it, this change doesnt affect you whatsoever, as you can continue to just do clues as you get them. Why deprive people the option to continue their tasks or skill grinds if they would rather finish them first and then do clues later? 
---
In my case I get to play on mobile during the day and like to slay or afk skill train, and as soon as I get a clue drop I end up dropping it, because I'd rather do my clue at home where I have the benefit of a mouse and a 2nd screen to pull up a wiki. This proposed update would eliminate the frustration of deciding to put something off or leave the clue on the ground, and in general just give us more of a choice.
---
I don't get this mentality of changes like this ruining the authenticity of the game. Stuff like this wasn't in the game prior because it wasn't possible to do in the past, and if your wish is to do it the way it was before then cool! You can still do that! Let other people enjoy it another way.

I like this comment 
---
Oh dang ur right. That’s crazy.
---
I'm gonna have to disagree with you here. The limitations on clue scrolls are important imo. You cannot streamline this game too much without removing the fun. 
---
I'm okay with stackable clues as long as the max stack is 1.
---
mimics are from DND and very old rpgs
---
Oh, lol
---
FYI, I believe this was addressed in streams this week or last from the dev team... they will inevitably nerf nmz, so get xp in while you can!
---
It just happened yesterday, they will get to it.  It's not an instant flick-of-switch change.
---
So you can only stack clues if you have the stack in your inventory? I guess that's not too bad. 
---
I thought it did pass, but the poll actually only made it consisten for elite clues, which could give you either a second challenge scroll, or have you do it like hardclues do.
---
it's dumb, they should all be hard clue style.
---
Not dope at all fam, u don't need higher mage accuracy, nibs have negative mage defense and he has double mage items. Only use is +4 range but he's missing out on so much vs suffering.

Hards and meds have the same average gp drop and my argument is valid for any teir of clue.

I think the issue is a lack of extreme for stupid. Saying "your stupid" is enough sometimes but people sometimes want to search for a stronger word, which is why we have curses. There's really no curse for being stupid though. Retarded was the default for a while and I agree I prefer it a bit more. But that's the main reason why they use it. It's just a curse word for stupid.
---
As for it insulting autistic people, it pertains a bit to my other comment. It can cause an implicit negative view of autistic individuals. But I think it's fairly diluted.

Blast furnace is so accessable that I can't help but feel like I'm wasting my "skills" there. I know that's not a great mindset to have, but it's also kind of annoying to do as you gotta pay every 10 minutes and it's as click intensive as runecrafting.

---
You’re almost halfway there! Lmao
---
Nice.
---
What if I just spent it to look cool?
---
Or, what if attack bonus is also a thing?
---
&gt; Also, you could farm clues so insanely easily at ham members or hellhounds. All rewards would drop in price so dramatically.
---
But that wouldn't be much of a difference from how you currently farm clues there? The back and forth time is often trivial to the time it takes to get the clue and the time to do the clue, so multiple clues there wouldn't be as insane as you claim.
---
And the issue isn't that you don't' want to do them, but the opposite. I very much want to do clues and work on my milestones items, but they can come at unfortunate times. Like if I am killing Graardor with friends and early in the trip I get an Elite... I'd want to bail to do the clue since killing it while I have a clue is wasting clue potential for me, but I can't just leave and come back since I'm needed there. Letting you have more than a single clue of a tier would remove that issue since you're not wasting drops.
---
It is actually a bit similar to Totems; if you don't bring banked pieces and get final piece, it is a waste to keep killing. But as seen in the current poll, players are okay with removing that restriction since it isn't needed. Though the difference is you can save a totem for later and don't have to do it right away. Anyway, similar to the Graardor example can be said elsewhere. Like when I just want to grind through a Wildy Boss task and I get an Elite Clue so I have to take a break from the content I want to be finishing to do a clue now. Or when I get a clue from a Hellhound, stop task to do it, finish, go back, and get another hard clue first kill. So in those situations, I'd say the single clue limit is more of a chore and ruins the fun more than multiple clues would, which is what the OP claimed.
---
What the flippity flap
---
I can't live anymore
---
You dont have to stop your current activity to do the clue. You can wait until you're done, but you'll lose the chance for another during that time. It's a tradeoff. Wanting more is simply greedy, imo.
---
It shouldn’t even be a warning. 
---
Currently the examine text for caskets is “Cross your fingers and your toes.”
---
The examine text for a mimic chest should be “Cross your fingers and your toes?”
---
Subtle but different. 
---
You sure?  I'll give you 500k
---
The inv icon was shown in poh, is that what you are talking about?  That is very different to a screenshot of someone wearing the full set in game before its even been announced 
---
Stackable caskets are problematic for uim. It slightly buffs filling house if you are ready to collect shit ton of caskets.

I do hit the hop limit quite a bit, the gp per hour is pretty accurate since I did factor in the time I was just waiting and/or logged out.

It definitely is being parroted, but for the reason I expressed in my other comment.

By this same logic we should let the pking client slide too, the strings to make that work are already in the game so its ok?

got rune and left. probably should go back and get dragon but that rune defender and d scim just looks so nice.
---
do i necessarily need to get dragon?
---
He's not realizing that Arma has 3 pieces and blessed has 4 XD
---
hush money
---
That is the main issue I’m sure, they want to use a stronger word for stupid so they use a word that inadvertently has negative effects for people they don’t intend to insult. When I insult someone’s intelligence my go to is. Recap what they just did wrong, explain why it’s wrong, mock them for getting it wrong, and offering no solution to their mistake. I like to let them fester with it lol
---
I said the Set, is higher, the whole set not piece by piece
---
FullBlessD'Hide Set =72 Range Bonus
---
Full Armadyl=63 Range Bonus
---
Crafting 1.0 is Smithing 2.0 anyways right /s
---
Full dhide is 5 pieces. Arma is 3.  The three arma have more than the same three dhide. You also wear barrows gloves and pegs instead of vambs n blessed boot. 
---
You don't have to, but if you like clues then it makes more sense to stop. The problem is that even if you like clues, you may not always want to do them right when you get them. I don't think it is greedy save the distraction for between tasks instead of in the middle. And if the OSRS Team didn't feel the same way, they wouldn't have offered it...
---
OP is talking about instanced bosses which no you can't go back and get your stuff. I'm not necessarily stating that I agree with keeping the worlds for that reason.
---
Yeah, keys help a lot. Got six keys on my past one. 
---
Whats the perk of the ornament then?
---
I knew theres some benefit
---
Can you give me Chub Dick back? I genuinely like that name
---
You seem very calm despite what happened.
---
Stackable caskets for the dopamine rush memes and non-stackable clues.
---
Remember when you got a clue and it required you to do a quest so you went and actually did the quest? Yeah, that wont happen with stackable clues - you'll bank it and get rewarded through completion of other clues of the same tier. Seems like you'll get rewarded for inaction. Drop the clue and wait till you get another one, don't hoard them!
---
Easily worth a couple of platinums. 
---
I wouldn't mind something like that. TBH, I'd even be okay if there was an NPC or somewhere that you could have "store" a clue so you could get another; like how you can with Watson. Then when I get an Elite I can stash it there between trips and go right back instead of having to spend half an hour doing a clue and losing setup and world.
---
They have a soft cap of 25. So again, you’re wrong

I’m gonna cry when they don’t pass
---
Holy shit bro chill
---
Man, I've seen a lot of shit reposted in this sub but it really hurts when you seen your own OC get retoasted
---
If they don't warn you, people will have to go gear up and get their PvM inventory every time they're about to open an elite/master casket, just in case, that enough seems incredibly obnoxious amount of time.
---
I can indeed - about to do that today actually! :D
---
The two comments about spirits seeds are that after this one I plant I don't get another until I get 5 at 99... Which seems goofy. And also that every seed I get now will just accumulate in my bank with no purpose
---
So do that. Quests are a great way to build up in every skill and unlock more content at the same time. A good goal is to complete Recipe for Disaster.
---
I disagree. They are a chore each time I get it have to do it and bank my god damn stuff.
---
Sometimes I wish I could just do ten clues and log out.
---
Are you saying this is useless? What are you, some kind of heretic? 
---
Tbh if they at least let you get anywhere between 3-10 clues stacked that would be enough that you don't have to constantly re-gear to go do clues but you can't just pile up a ton of them, you could finish your slayer task or your bossing session and then go do the clues, rather than banking all your gear constantly for wildy steps. It's still a break from what you're doing, but you can at least do it inbetween slayer tasks and such, rather than mid slayer task as no one likes banking all their gear multiple times a single slayer trip.
---
That’s a great idea, I just looked around at a few bars to see which one was easiest to get to and big enough.
---
Talk to him. 
---
yeah i was thinking tying it to the godless or maybe some unknown god, it doesnt have to be called blessed and the lore around it can be adjusted, i just want a set of d'hide thats black and gives prayer bonus 
---
I get that it was meant to be a distraction from what you’re currently doing but you can also do that with anything, to kill something else, go train a different skill, clue scrolls don’t have to be the only thing to break up the monotony.
---
Plus for those of us who like the monotony missing out on clue scrolls because you’re already prepared to do something else sucks.
---
Maybe vorkath wasn’t a good example, how about something like a GWD boss, you spend all the time to get prepared to get, get a team together, get the kc (or key) to get to the boss and then you (or someone on the team) gets a clue scrolls. Now you and the party has to stop killing bandos because someone wants to do the clue. You (or someone else in the party) just brought the whole raid, or bossing trip to a screeching stop.
---

---
Treasure trails are already so bloated. There are so many cosmetics in the game I can't even identify all of them any more, so much random trash.

He's agreeing with you. I really like your sealed unstackable scroll idea. And definitely no warning for mimics. 
---
Start loving slayer

I too returned ( again ) to rs after watching our beloved swamp boy.
---
Tons of Bananas
---
Which is part of my point, people have weird shit they gladly accept in this game that are completely unbalanced, blowpipe is completely overpowered for the price, and twisted bow turns nearly every single boss into a joke. 
---
But people are totally happy with that but if you mention turmoil or overloads people lose their shit and cry "RS3 ezscape". Chaotic crossbow was nothing compared to blowpipe or using black chins at arma.
---
Behind the pillar is a safe spot for melee you don’t even have to move just dps and no need to worry about being hit.
---
Also have protect from mage on In melee phase if you are taking damage from mini mage snakes
---
To be fair, I think you're right about that.
---
Could do dragon slayer 2 and do vorkath, probably could do dks especially on task, and duo-trio some god wars. Any boss really there I’m sure you could swing
---
Didn't realize RuneLite snapped a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/yzjJYYZ) of my demise. 
---
I know I should, unpopular opinion but I really don't like the skill
---
&gt;as that is what gave them such an impact in darksouls
---
You just hit them once to know if the chest is a mimic or not, big fucking deal. Mimics are such a pointless mechanic/enemy in Dark Souls for that reason alone.
---
It's more of an example, the minigame is designed to waste time, so is it okay to just skip it with RL? They clearly intended for it to waste time, what other time wasters are okay to circumvent? Etc etc
---
Runetip1 you out there buddy?
---
While you make some fair points, it's pretty annoying to have to switch out my inventory and gear just to do a clue scroll. While this is optional, so is letting clues stack up to some ridiculous number such as in your scenario. I'd be content with a compromise of like 3-5 of every type of clue scroll. 
---
Vorkath/kree/zilyana 
---
Part of me is okay with rerolls because you don’t have to use it if you want the challenge, right? But then on the other hand, I think that making clue scrolls potentially easier may devalue those clue items a bit. Definitely mixed about this one.
---
Check the images in IMGUR
---
This isn't the case. If there is a way I can show you my playing activity for the past couple of years you'll see I'm not lying. But ultimately you're gonna believe what you're gonna believe
---
Yeah was thinking this and mm2 I'm not far off doing them. Raids is a long term goal but I wanna be fully ready for them skill wise. I need to join a pvm clan and start doing gwd as cash is becoming a problem 
---
I mean, stackable clues don't stop you from taking a break to do them. I personally like grinding one thing at a time for a long time. I would like to be able to slay/PvM and amass a lot of clues to then grind out all at once. 
---
Didn't realize RuneLite snapped a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/yHs31PT) of my demise.
---
&gt;However some people would prefer to keep grinding their slayer or whatever and when you get a clue
---
And they can. The balanced trade off is that they can't get another clue scroll.
---
Most I ever got was \~85 torstols. That's at 95 farming with all 9 patches, magic secs, all the relevant diaries for increased yield done, and attas seed in the anima patch.
---
If you want to do them as they drop, *go ahead and do so nobody is stopping you*.
---
What about the drag from running with objectively bulky objects?
---
This would likely overcome the gains from the lift provided by the balloons as you simply can't look at the problem in 1 vector, as it clearly impacts 2.
---
So I would suggest 1-2% faster energy drain rate as well!

For the love of saradomin can you please check on IGN Honest Neos as well?
---
That’s hot. If you get lucky with clue scrolls that may help too if you’re into that kind of thing.
---
First I was about to call you out but realized ur just a troll.
---
Assuming it's like RS3, it actually wouldn't. You get 1 active scroll and a stack of inactive ones. You couldn't activate a new one without either completing or dropping your active clue. 
---
I do not, I used to do this in 2003-2006.
---
I made money now myself and included flipping standing on a nice 6.5M now.
---
Invested in 1.5M clothing, spent 1-2M on items to flip and the rest is for play / skilling.
---
I can teach you but DM me first :-)

At least in DS1 the chain direction is switched for mimics, so you don't even have to hit it

---
This, so much this. If someone wants to do them as they drop they're more than free to do so. Just because they stack doesn't mean you need to hold them until you have multiple.
---
Didn’t watch it firsthand, I heard it through word of mouth. I don’t believe they mentioned a specific timeline though

---
Well RS3 has a soft cap of 25 from general PvM/Thieving etc. Just drop it down to like 5 for OSRS and it should be golden, could do say an entire Hellhound Task without having to bank every 30 kills. 
---
I feel like content changes should be polled E.G stat changes to weapons or equipment, drop rates/ loot for npcs or rewards in general, additional weapons or armour, you know the more ground breaking types of changes. 
---
User interface changes shouldn't be polled I think it's dumb to poll them like you stated most people will vote no spitefully it isn't ground breaking to be able to rearrange prayer magic or resize the icons of them in fact some third party clients allow this so I don't see why it's  such a issue same with the remembering combat styles on weapons and auto cast for mage when equipping staffs. Polling literally every single change down to the smallest change like how a helmet looks on a particular character is dumb and often times is worded and polled poorly so it doesn't ever get passed
---
You don't wear it for that

So what? You can still do clues as soon you get them even if they are stackable. No one is forcing you to keep pvming or skilling as soon as you get them.
---
They have always been in the game
---
Very cool stuff guys, can't wait!
---
Just as dumb. After 6 or more years of logging in with aggressive selected, why would you check to see if tlsuddenly it's changed? 
---
~15% generally voting yes does not sway polls in the same way as 15% generally voting no, since it requires 75% to pass. They would be more relevant if it was 50% to pass.
---
Have you considered that more people vote yes to ideas that are good, and more polls are passing because more good ideas are being polled? Because that's the more likely scenario.
---
You're not wrong that people always voting yes is a problem though. However that just adds to my argument that the poll system is compromised: if we actually have over 50% of the players who aren't voting based on what's best for the game, then why are polling things at all?

I downvoted ya friend.  IDK who the hell would ever upvote you when asking to be downvoted!
---
Graphic design is not working out for you. This is bad. 
---
i think the point they're trying to get across is that it makes it more likely that any individual clue scroll will get done at any point. Today, someone might get one. If they care about the rewards, they'll go do it immediately so they won't miss out. But the people who didn't do that before, rather than missing out, will be able to stockpile clues and do them whenever they fancy, rather than being locked into one until hey do end up doing them.
---
Pffff..
---
I really don't understand the logic behind pets being an item you can lose on death. Should just be an interface you bring up and can spawn/despawn them. 
---
No invention :'(

Not paranoid enough. U left the special attack orb visible, thanks for the acc kid
---
&gt; All this update would do is make more clues completed on average, which would add more of the rare drops into the economy and then make clues less profit on average.
---
Stackable clues will not if players right now do clues immediately after obtaining them.
---
You can f2p both and see which one you like. 
---
I felt like that too at first but now that Im a bit more calm I think I deserved it. Imagine how many capes have been obtained with Zuk hits. Its still not 'easy'.

Saradomin is awesome but I feel like the Zamorak robes could use a darker black maybe idk?
---
18 and counting. 
---
IPwnUWitRange if you see this i miss you. 
---
Well that being average means plenty of people take longer than that to max, but also consider that it’s only counting people who have actually maxed. If they extrapolated from everyones gametime and rate of leveling I bet the average time to max would be significantly higher since people who max tend to play more efficiently overall.
---
Good stuff it’s definitely worth doing ds2
---
The argument here is that stackable clues leads to more clue scrolls being done which naturally leads to more clue scroll items entering the game which means the supply increases and the value decreases of said items.
---
Clue scroll rewards are gated by both their rarity and the amount of clue scrolls that are done per day. Increase that amount and the price goes down. 
---

Good for you, for the substantial portion of the player base still leveling where things like Vork or Zulrah aren't an option it would be a significant boost. I CAN EARN MONEY FAST SO LITERALLY NO ONE ELSE CAN'T
---
It's okay buddy, I agree with you. Sailing seems like it would be plenty of fun, but there's literally no reason it should be a skill and not a minigame instead. It'd be like if Temple Trekking didn't suck.
---
Same thing with Artisan, horrible idea to make that a skill, I'm glad it didn't pass. But as Farming Contracts have proven, great minigame, every skilling guild should have an equivalent.
---
Warding on the other hand is the exact opposite. It makes plenty of sense as a skill and _should_ be added, but it also looks boring as shit and like just another buyable. 
---

I don’t really get the point in stackable clues. Isn’t that kinda the point of the clue scroll? If you get one in the middle of a slayer task that you have to go do it in order to get another? I know that makes it more annoying to collect them and finish your task, but I always thought that was the point? It’s just an extra possible reward if you want to take it, not something you can just bank and come back to a stack of after awhile.

There was one guy who called me an idiot right off of tutorial island, and from 2007 to 2013 every account I made he was on the ignore list. For the life of me I can't remember his name anymore
---
In that instance, they wouldn't have had the chance to insure it right? So it would be lost forever?
---
Holy crap, hello other me

When you double KO on a jad task

Lmao loved that episode

Shoot I don't even like the fact you can have more than one type of clue at a time. I think one of the BEST parts about clues is that you can only have one. If you want a chance at another, you better go do that quest in order to finish it. Yeah it's a little annoying to get to hellhounds and get a clue on your second drop, but to me it's endearing. Clues were never made to be efficient, and we have to stop this EHP-scape creep. 
---
I disagree with this. I find being forced to do your clue is a chore rather than a pleasure. As well I'd rather do a bunch of them at once, rather than stop whatever im doing currently to due the clue.
---
Agreed, everyone please vote against stackable clues.
---
wasn't it other pk'ers that opposed that because it "ruined the meta" or some shit?
---
Yea, good point. Might as well insure even if you don't bring the pet to areas where you might die.
---
My personal solution is they should stack up to a small number (something like 3-5), but for each clue in your possession the drop rate is lowered, like with ecumenical keys. This means there is still incentive to doing the clue the moment it's obtained, but you don't feel punished when you choose not to do it straight away.
---
With the current system clues can still feel like a chore, feeling as though you have to stop mid-task to complete them to be efficient, so I feel this is a fair and reasonable compromise.

Back then I don’t think I really talked to anyone. But the account with my Reddit username was banned after it was hacked and botted on. Thanks Jagex for the awesome appeal system!!!!!!!!!

If you have to ask that question you haven't been playing osrs lmao. Just go sit at the GE for an hour or two.
---
Make it "Count your fingers and your toes." For even more subtlety. The mimic might bite some off!
---
It doesn't necessarily have to be 'stackable' but maybe just being able to hold more than 1 at a time.
---
It could still be bad for uim because they potentially could get 28 but that probably won't cause to many issues and be a lot of effort. 
---
Yep, immediately gone forever

It would too dramatically change GWD.

Dyou mean Oyester?
