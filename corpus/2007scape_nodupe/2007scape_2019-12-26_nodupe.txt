Top two worst events in falador history

i dont get why this confuses people.  Its all the same game just depending on what world you log into it loads that profile up.  just like twistedleague/deadman
---
Mate you could replace that for like ¬£20 legit or ¬£10 black market. Your post makes it seem like you've lost millions. I bet even the hacker was gutted when he saw your bank man haha
---
Why are you posting fake clips, OP??
---
Buy swampletics merch, watch streams and play osrs is best Christmas eh...
---

---
Sounds like you just want to gain some nerds favor and ‚Äúsympathy‚Äù gp tbh.
---
If not, just buy a few bonds and move on. I‚Äôm sure at the age of 22 you have a spare $20ish lying around.
---
Wow these look really cool!
---
Bullshit that's clearly diavolo
---
Dude even when osrs was released it took forever to buy or sell an item. Sometimes more than an hour, a few hours. Do you even play the game?
---
Who cares?
---
dont think so.
---
I also keep my public chat off lol
---
I reckon you should buy a few bond, dust yourself off and carry on soldier
---
the gnomes are tired of being splashed on
---
Who gives a shit that you don't give a shit? Assholes are everywhere.
---
Using prayer and super combats is super wasteful, could just bring super atk/str for way less cost. But play how you like :D
---
If you're P2P then I'd strongly an Extended anti-fire potion and Crossbowing.
---
1. If you‚Äôre dedicated enough to play twisted league you probably won‚Äôt be botting.
---
2. Purpose of 90% of bots on the maingame are goldfarming.
---
so no.
---
You‚Äôll need to unlock [Fossil Island](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fossil_Island) to mine volcanic ash and to do birdhouses. 
---
For the compost, fill each bin with 15 supercompostable items (pineapples) and let it rot for ~90 minutes. Then you‚Äôll open the bin and use 25 volcanic ash on it to convert the supercompost into ultracompost. 
---
For birdhouses, you can just look up a guide on YouTube, they‚Äôre pretty easy to do.
---
found the zoomer
---
I noticed one of these :o
---
The equipment sounds good but you might want to consider upgrading your food to swordfish. Salmon only heal 9 while swordfish heal 14. Another upgrade that might help would be to bring a strength potion with you. If all else fails, you can‚Äôt go wrong with just training your stats up more. You‚Äôll get it eventually!
---
I knew the context. The context doesn't change the fact that you claimed something's impossible, when it's not even close. Just admit you were wrong on that part and move on.
---
Don't get hoked!
---
&gt; botting is the entire reason why rwt is such a problem
---
There wouldn't be goldfarming bots everywhere if people weren't buying gold from the black market.
---
I got someone that dmd me on here. He said he would pm the reactions, will make a post and hit you up

Not necessarily a scam but moving to Venezuela to max your account might raise some red flags on Jagex's end
---
All that squirting might be xp waste.
---
Damn, I could never play on 3 accounts. Even 2 is too much :D
---
It's in osrs, so yeah...
---
. I am clearly missing something can I get an explanation rather than an insult lol I must be a super noob
---
Oh hell no, the only squirting I need is the dagganoths attacking me whilst I grind xp
---
I feel like I'm too late to the party for a chance. But merry christmas!
---
sticks and bird shit
---
I must be missing something. Sorry for being dense. I just don't get it. I must be a super noob
---
You've never done that? I usually run 2/3 Vorkath alts whilst TOBing on my main.
---
I thought Brimstone boots were supposed to do that, Guardians are purely defense.
---
I got back into the game a few months ago and found that my bank was mostly cleaned too (it was a mess so they only bothered to take the really valuable stuff). There was also $70 of disputed charges on my account. All because I used the same username/password on another game that had a data breach
---
shit sucks but what can you do but restart the grind?
---
It‚Äôs probably my favorite, that or the shirt.
---
have some dignity , man
---
Its on the pets  Bandos / skotizo / zammy. They make that god awful noise and if you get more of them you can actually see your framerate drop from it rendering all the noise its kinda nuts lol
---

No. It would ruin the rewards even more.

He's just behind the general store at the lockup special event place, it's annoying because the dairy says he's on the square

Barraging and luring it away from healers is annoying lel
---
That shit is what killed minigames on rs3. Leave the shit games dead. Castle wars, pest control and BA are the active minigames here. They need to make theit own jagex run bots to have a buffer to keep pms from being dead. As some who loves minigames and played a lot of rs3 i think spotlights would be a terrible idea for osrs.
---
Oh thank you! It was my first real attempt at fashionscape and im so happy everyone liked it! I love running into other people with it! :)
---
that 9m a hour is profit after paying protection, so of course.
---
Wait you took a picture of your phone? With what?
---
people debate over the weirdest things and they aren't even making limited builds. can't take 2 steps in gelinor anymore without a in depth youtube guide...smh.
---
D
---
East coast baby!
---
I mean if you want to kill the game then sure make small rwt offences bannable.
---
I have a 60 atk pure right now, 92 str &amp; range and like 85 magic.
---
Honestly so bored on it debating on turning it into a zerk because I feel like there is way more to do. Just my opinion.
---
How are you getting 1m+ nmz points in 1 hour?
---
Instead of making 1 minigame popular per month because of better rewards, why not make all minigames have better rewards? That way I can just play the one I want with better rewards. People only play castle wars and ba and pc because castle wars is sorta fun and ba and pc are necessary for diary rewards/gear upgrades without gp cost. And lms is fun but provides similar cosmetics to castle wars but can't be afked for points (as easily) and the tradeable items aren't worthwhile at all.
---
yeah i mean i was front page the first 3 weeks and even had the rank 1 spot for total level and top 5 points for a few weeks, but i just slowly lost interest. I can easily keep up lol im just bored of runescape in general.
---
Right? And the more people who buy bonds for rl money the cheaper they are for the rest of us to buy
---
Uhhhh, please say you‚Äôre still on? üò≠
---
even if it is 1,2,3 mill whatever it might as well be a few hundred k at that point lol.
---
Nope
---
AMA for people who get diarrhea from McDonald's food
---
ima put an offer in the ge for those tasset couple gp over u =p
---
It most definetely matters. If i try to do the same things i used to  when i was 1 def 31 pray:  range to maul, fire surge rushing. Which is imo a fantastic bh/ varrock pvp build.
---
I already got 44 pray today but not sure about the def.
---
10 to 20 Defense unlocks pretty strong items like slayer helmet (i), mystic (far superior too ghostly), addy gloves, mith defender. 
---
Which would be a better build in deeper wilderness than the previous one.
---
The funny part is that I said it as a joke knowing fully well this would be the reaction. My comment originally was going to be "Fair enough I misunderstood your comment have a good day"
---
That's how it's supposed to be. New bis from higher level content replaces old bis from lower level content
---
It confuses people because it says runescape 3 on the card.
---
Wow, such intelligent conversations.
---
Nice
---
Not for long.
---
Too poor to follow through :(
---
In other words sailing but the entire skill is jammed in the already longest list of things in the game - the construction skill guide. Yeah construction is boring, but so is 90% of the other shit in the game and at least construction is like 900k xp/hr.

I was today years old when I learned it wasn't "paws"

At first I thought it was an elder scroll map on the r/gaming sub. So glad it wasn‚Äôt this is cool
---
I probably won't be able to log for a long time tomorrow. I don't know a lot about the 25 def build, what does it unlock ?
---
Our first person who didn't read the whole post. Congrats, you got here sooner than I expected.
---
That would be dope, man.
---
Imagine being letdown someone didn't drop free things for you to try and get on Christmas in a video game.
---
Let them stack up to 2-3 at a time would be nice.  You can finish your slayer task knowing you don‚Äôt have to do it right away or miss out on another one. But you won‚Äôt be able to keep loads in your bank.
---
Annoying to get a hard clue 70 nechs into an extended task of like 230. Even if you try to not bank everything, half of the time you have to bank it all to go into the wilderness. After all that you get 50k of rune plate legs and have to waste time regearing and hopping worlds to find a open spot.
---
What ratios are you talking about ? 
---
So according to you every non 1 def account does not even worth playing ?

Just infinity and frog leather.

This brought back so many good memories - thank you
---
Maybe 0.01% of people would consider using this? A handful of host alts or something? If house load times were reduced it would be worth offering larger houses, but for now it's such a tiny audience that there's no point. The people who use this have to not care about PoH load times, that rules out most PvMers and PvPers; they also need to be wealthy, that rules out most skillers. The only audience I can see for it are *maybe* hosts.
---
Just fix load times first and then I'm sure lots of people would enjoy it, no?
---
The Chinese company that owned jamflex sold them earlier in the year.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad update, but you really need to experience a slow loading house before you understand how awful they are. The beta world houses are the best example, the update the OP is proposing plans to make that *even longer*. I just think they should reduce load times before they consider expanding PoH limits and adding more "fun stuff" that most people don't use because it slows down load times.

Hey merry christmas!  I have my first christmas with my baby girl as well! 18 days old!
---
Makes no sense but I do like the concept.
---
Well the bludgeon could still be used by people who can't afford the mace, and I'm not sure if you've killed much Sire, but it could certainly use a slight boost in unique value. It's a very time consuming boss with relatively tiny rewards other than the bludgeon and dagger
---
I have a feeling you wouldn't have anybody to invite to a fake party... just a hunch.
---
Yo you wanna do group Ironman with me? Lol
---
I have both already for alching during agility/raids
---
and that's a good point it ultimately won't be very significant and I'm not doing 100 hours of vork anyway, more like 15 hours more from where I'm at
---
I think the easiest way to explain why is to look at why it was created. It was pitched as a stronger Godsword but without the spec; it could deliver a higher hitting whack but not much else. It is too slow to find much use in PvM outside of flinching and some other methods were you don't hit often, so it was mainly for PvP as a Godsword alternative.
---
But if you look at the AGS price, you can see why the maul isn't fairing well either. Compared to the AGS, it might have a stronger whack, but chances are you'd rather an AGS spec instead. And if you bring an AGS, it is close enough to the Maul that you don't have a reason to carry both. It still does get used in PvP, and PvM, but it was designed from the getgo as a niche weapon.
---
That said, there has been some talk of buffing it. There was an upgrade that was polled and failed, but some feedback I saw was that the upgrade should be the baseline rather than an attachment. So perhaps it will be revisited in the future.
---

I turned public off shortly after, I have been blocking these bots for months and months.  Really doesn't matter anymore - they multiply like cockroaches.

the point of goals like that is that they are super hard to achieve.... they lose all their value when they become super normal to achieve.

 I'm back on osrs after a few years break, made a new account and been having fun f2p pking. What's going on with rune drops? I had a few kills which all runes dropped were only 1 of each.

Was it an update to combat RWT? Is it to do with risk, or combat level difference? Is there a way to prevent it?
---
Justice
---
Graardor dropped his pants, and those goblins gave you head.
---
Can we stop with the attachments?  This isn't the RuneScape I know.  It shouldn't be hard to introduce weapons that are equivalent or specific use case at the same power as the tier they belong in.  The attachments are stupid.
---
For large monsters, dragon halberd? This is coming from really old school knowledge though
---
its a normal price flux chill out. barely even changed and they were at a high price anyway - due to drop.

Funny you can look at this map many years later and still know exactly what is being sold in each location around the bank. The real feels...
---
that‚Äôs what rs mobile is for 5head lol
---
I think it would be a nice addition to the kebos and kourend diary since it isn't very enticing to get done. Allow easy to stack 4 easy clues. Medium allow for stacking of 4 medium and 8 easy. Etc.
---
With Watson in the area I think it could fit and be a fun thing to go for. You could still not stack master clues and only 4 elites. But you could build up a good number of easy clue then do them all if you felt like it.
---
We could tackle adding an item sink into the game to help with clue value later, reward value should not be a reason to keep bad game design.
---
RT, I play on my laptop but strictly use reddit on mobile, why criminalize me show some love :(
---
I haven't played in years, i don't know anything about it and i've only heard that you restart, dono for sure. 
---
We get it, you're a no life runelord. Praise you.
---
Could trade in 10 easy clues, 5 mediums and 5 hard clues and either 1 elite or 1 master at Sherlock for a clue stacker that can stack up to 3 clues of any tier. Would be a cool way to do it.
---
cant u just afk and get carried for that though.  Guess u need to get in morytania which requires prayer if im not wrong, idk

Original nice thinkin
---
Dunno if a bot could do it, I'm sure they could detect the waves and where everything will spawn, but the tick eating would be the biggest issue. Mostly because of latency and ping. You need human intuition for that kind of stuff, when you're playing tick by tick
---
Yea while you guys post all day about trying to get your alch-price hoards buffed or make 99 crafting for your ironman easier, these guys sit there and play the game for fun.
---
Player A: How much? 
---
Player B: Offer? 
---
A: IDK what u take?
---
B: what u give?
---
Then either player A low balls the fuck out of player B, or player B asks for a ridiculous amount. And the deal ends with a ‚Äúgtfo noob‚Äù.

Just play btw

Lol you right. I meant spaying and neutering.

This is obviously a joke, a funny one too

You jolt awake.  You‚Äôre 26 years old.  Your heart aches remembering the times when you had no responsibilities, and your biggest worry was selling some lobsters.  
---
You now work at a dead end job and play RuneScape on your phone during breaks trying to regain that morsel of satisfaction you got as a kid, and it‚Äôs always just one more goal away. 
---
You ask yourself why you still play this game and never get a clear response other than it used to make you so happy and it reminds you of those times, times you would give anything to go back to, but can‚Äôt.
---
Cerb unfortunately doesn't count, he ordered a hit on an lower ranked internal member of his gang (normal hellhound).

I remember back in 2006-2007, i was friends with this one dude on rs. We would do everything together. Skill, train, quest, hangout. He lived in the states and i lived in canada. I was like 10 at the time. I remember i actually asked my parents for a phone card, so i could call him in the US. We would talk on the phone for hours while grinding away at the game for years. When gwd came out, he got full bandos and would actually loan me it from time to time.
---
A few months went by after the summoning update, and i noticed that he wasn‚Äôt on as much. I finally see him on one day, and ask where he had been.
---
He replies to me telling me that its his brother, and the younger brother ‚Äúmy friend that i played with‚Äù, had actually passed away due to having a heart attack at age 13 during basketball practice.
---
I thought that this was some type of joke, so i called him, and his brother added me on facebook and he linked me the article to him. I was like 13 at the time and i was fucking devastated at what had happened. I didin‚Äôt cry, but i was just so confused and in disbelief. Sometimes to this day, i still think about him from time to time, or when his brother makes a facebook post, it reminds me of him.
---
Sure, if you think gish gallop is impressive he might seem like a decent debater.
---
More importantly, he's a bigot.
---
Lol yeah I need to try fighting Kruk again. I've been having a hard time with Galvek so i figured id do a different quest. I'd rather fight Galvek than Kruk.....
---
That was just world 2 every second of every day
---
Copy and paste from my other reply because y'all both brought up a similar point that really doesnt hold weight.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It didnt require **meaningful** interaction though. Standing around and spamming the same things over and over, doin a quick trade, then leaving; isnt quite an interaction, nor does it "make friends".
---
Standing in the ge, also allows you to interact and to make friends. Hell its better, because youre not having to stop advertising your product in order to sell it; to chat with others.
---
And requiring players to interact, or rely upon others isnt always the best long term game design other. Look at SoA, now a days youre better off creating an alt in order to finish it than to find another player who is doing the same quest.
---
Yeah that is one that I dislike. Tentacle just happens to attach to one and only item in the game to make an upgrade for no reason.
---
Stuck on where to start? Look up oziris ironman guide v3 on Google. Even though it's for irons, it's a great starting point. Quest cape is also a good first goal to work towards.
---
Skilling to PvM? Go for 90 herblore, 80+ farming, 81+ agility, 80+ mining, 84 construction, 95 slayer.
---
Skilling to max? Go for base 70s, base 80s, base 90s, achievement diary cape, max cape.
---
Pvming? Easy: team god wars, team Corp, slayer bosses. Medium: zulrah, Vorkath. Hard: raids. 
---
Join a social clan or two, make some friends. Watch twitch and join a community there to make some friends; streamers tend not to care about you unless you donate them money so if you can't afford that, stick to social clans.

Oh, so a bunch of high level people are mocking those who do things they don't agree with... But you aren't an elitist. Rofl.

Works fine in RS3. Wasting time going back and forth makes no sense. There should be zero reason why they couldn't stack. I would do 8 easy, 6 medium, 5 hard, 4 elite, 2 master. Prices really wouldn't be changed because you are still taking time killing the monsters. I would say per clue it would remove about 5 minutes to account for bearing, traveling to boss location and setup.

Ready for downvotes for rs3 reference.

Um I could have yes, but they were different thoughts at different times, so editing the one post might lead you to missing something. Good try anyway I guess

Great write up. Honestly better written than nearly every feature request or bug report I've seen at work.
---
Looks like a fiddly problem to fix, knowing companies like Jagex, there will be different codebases for the two journeys and it won't be covered in a good amount of tests making figuring out and fixing the problem awkward. At least you've explained the problem very clearly, just hope they can fix it promptly, it will be losing then customers so should be prioritised.

Would you mind running me through your process?

It seems that in the past there were methods that worked (if you read my post i leave examples of them) but more recently, possibly due to a game update, (and there was a recent update to the game's UI) it could have broken the ability for people to do this. Either way, let me know your solution so i can try it.

&gt; I think the issue is that eventually the Bludgeon loses all of the value from people selling it to get the mace.

people will eventually buy it back if mace is too expensive.
---
Yeah I agree that the lack of indicating where the resources are is an issue. Even though Runelite is my default, I always use OSbuddy to make corrupted gauntlet less stressful. It has a free plug-in that shows the resource locations so you don‚Äôt have to memorize all of them. I think this should be part of the normal client too.
---
And no.. nerfing the rewards is a horrible, horrible idea. Not gonna happen ever. I get where you‚Äôre coming from that too many solo bosses are full of alchables but of all the things to nerf the loot, gauntlet should be the very last thing you look at. The gp/p hour is already garbage. If you wanna nerf the loot, I would probably never EVER play it again.
---
Hey it goes with the osrs vibe
---

I didn't know OSBuddy has that plugin...is it the paid version or is it free. Does OSBuddy also have the Demonic Gorillas plugin except for the huntlef?
---
&gt; If you wanna nerf the loot, I would probably never EVER play it again.
---
Fine, don't nerf the reward but make the minigame either in general. What do you think about adding Rigour to the chest loot? That way solo players have a alternative method of obtaining the prayer outside of CoX group.
---
Pretty sure this is only an issue for ios anyway which you can't emulate.
---
Lol. You blocked out 2 of the hp levels, but not the third.
---
Probably wouldn't be that valuable. The challenge is hard, but if they can be bought and sold it will just get treated like any piece of gear. None leave the game while the supply keeps increasing. Once done with your pvm session, you would sell it back when not using the cape.
---
I don't see the fire cape being over 3m. Everyone that does slayer knows they can finish fight caves in 30 minutes. That's 6m an hour for semi afking a slayer task.
---
As for inferno, If it was the first couple month, sure I can believe it staying at 100m to 300m.  However, today I don't see it going over 30m to 40m. Think about it. Do you really think inferno would stay at 50m to 150m an hour after a year or 2?  Many people that go for more than one cape would probably do it in 2 hours to cash in on both 100k slayer XP and a huge lump sum. While the pet hunters or speed runners would do it in ~75 minutes tops. I just don't see this money making staying that generous when there are many people that camp it.
---
[Suggestion] stop posting suggestions plz
---
CoX isn't intended to be soloed. The Gauntlet is.
---
sure but then you end up with a shit piece of plastic instead of a real mouse. I did this last couple years and had like 3 different mice since then and they did their job but I recently bought g502 (because the best mouse I ever uset was logi years ago and because I saw it at my friends) and it was one of the best decisions I've made about my setup. Compared to the mice I had over the years this one is much better in all the things
---
Not saying all the "non famous brand" (idk how to call them lol) mice are shit but yeah some more established companies like logi make much better mice than all those new "gaming" brands that sell you some piece of plastic
---
my game has been freezing then going black screen then logging me out ever since the last hotfix they did for the servers, not totally sure but im convinced its on jagex end since when it logs me out it lets me log back in right away and doesnt say "acc still logged in" like a normal dc
---
I‚Äôm not kidding, I cried. This game will always be such a part of me.
---
Mine had a red party hat, and a tiny deck of playing cards.
---
These ‚Äúworkarounds‚Äù allow you to solo the Olm fight without running out of brews. That seems like the normal way of doing it
---
Maybe you should adjust your expectations
---
I mean who wouldn't keep it there and flex having level 2 herb
---
Was doing vork just then, extended super anti and pray mage worked as usual. &lt;10 dmg each time. One time I didn't turn on protect mage fast enough and I got the rng "you were horribly burnt" even with anti on and it hit me in the 40s. So yeah, if you forgot your potion, then it makes sense.
---
Are u talking about in osr or irl? üòÖ
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs ‚Äòintended‚Äô or not. The game was not intended to be soloed. You signed up for a challenge when you made an iron man. Stop suggesting for the game to be changed to cater to your playstyle. You should be willing to accept the challenges you come across and not beg for easy-scape. Why would you even play as an Ironman if you don‚Äôt want anything to be difficult?
---
IRL! Turns out party hats are a real thing. I should have taken a picture when everyone at the table was wearing different color P Hats.
---
Swamp man overrated
---
Im an Ironman :) thanks!
---
Yeah, I would go with divine str and atk pots. So much cheaper than combats

Just move it to ge

This Reddit makes me laugh, j remember when ginger  beardie sold his t bow or some shit with Reddit supporting him basically!

There's nothing skilful about an infinite food source in a game deliberately designed with a limited inventory.
---
When I was 12 it was all about RS and my dad wasn‚Äôt really thrilled about me wasting hours in front of the pc but that Christmas I only got 1 gift and that was membership for 6 months. You can‚Äôt imagine the Hype when I visited my friend the next day also playing RS, watching me as I logged into a members world ... good old Days when taxes where only payed in game.
---
Yes manipulating olm's head is designed for teammates to distract while others take down his hands without getting attacked. That's how it intended to work since olm hands have large amount of hp so you'd want to attack them without distractions.
---
Soloing where you constantly run back and forth probably isn't the "norm" method of dealing with it. (even though jagex sanctions this method cuz click intensive) Sort of like how tick-skilling isn't the "norm" or prayer flicking etc.
---
before you do this, check f2p pking spots to see how many people in that combat level are fighting no arm. Most f2p pures are low level (like 60-70 str/range). So, make sure there is enough people your level pking right now. Maybe you'll make this account and there will be like 5 people to fight over and over again.
---
Just walk LOOOOOOL Damn my depression is cured
---
Ahh I probably just forgot to flick my prayer on then. Doesn;t surprise me considering I've died 5/10 kills today lmao, I'm actually getting worse.
---
It's too early for reality
---
I'm using blowpipe so I need to use mage protect, yes.
---
Idk what you smoked to get this idea so, how do you think this would be any better? Or are you suggesting this just because your ironman can raid now and you want to solo without learning any solo tactics used in olm?
---
It is 100% the norm method of dealing with it, it's manipulating the head to take no/less damage.  It's 100% intended, that's why even in team's you run the head.
---
I think he meant he's taking an actual shit. Not going through some shit

No

[time to post this again](https://i.redd.it/nycnj1itq2f21.png)
---
I don't think raids will be dead content for a while yet, it drops the most expensive weapon in the game and raids 3 when that releases will probably be weak against the bow.
---
But that doesnt usually make sense. Its already not an issue with it just being replaced anyway
---
Then you remember the account you spent thousands of hours on is an RS3 account
---
Elaborate
---
This is dumb, damage soaking is what made this armour good, we have no soaking in osrs.
---
What did you mean by tent whip is fine then...?
---
That does not sound correct, since the HA value of a magic longbow is higher than the GE value.
---
Did you just nostalgia trip me over bank sales?!
---
GOD DAMNIT

You should check out brutal black dragons in The catacombs if you have 77 slayer

I disagree because I believe the elder maul is currently used very well in its niche already.
---
I‚Äôm your father
---
The thing is, i was like 70% sure this was going to happen, but needed the cash. those were the prices before nmz was introduced to the game so to me it was kinda obv it was going to happen but impatience got to me :D
---
???
---
As I mentioned, defences matter very little in almost all situations and the meta is to have high strength bonus gear. Do you seriously think a zerker or rune pure is going to wear rune armour over the Inquisitor set because rune is more tanky? All jagex have done is remove all melee armour variety from build metas built around 30 defence, 40 defence, 42 defence, 45 defence, 50 defence and 60 defence.
---
Happy that it made you happy haha!
---
if you get fake xp drops, can runelite get the xp/h from that?
---
not sure how much overlap there is between small updates and important updates, just by the definition of the words
---
gmaul was changed to 60% spec, which may fit your definition i guess
---
what stuff do you already know about? (prif/sote, fremmy exiles/faceguard, karuulm/konar/hydra/farm guild, bh and lms reworks, hosidius rework/sarachnis)
---
People are so stuck up about their pictures. Bruh, I just want to show one thing, it doesn't need to be 8k ultra HD quality. I'm sorry my cellphone screenshot hurt you.
---
Like 90+ atk strength, 80+ def, mage, range
---
78 herb helps a bunch too so you can make brews and restores in the chambers
---
Pm me
---
Supply and Demand says that anytime you increase Supply, price will drop. If there's twice as many of something, it's twice as easy to come by and therefore not worth as much.
---
I'm suspicious about this. Wish OP would include more pictures.
---
I think you took my joke a bit too seriously there.
---
Funny part about this is that the things the person was gonna drop were junk anyway

Getting that tome of fire before 120m fm xp would be nice...

Funny how both those screenshots are using the same unique embedded font from the android OS.
---

---
Oooo! Yeah the herb will definitely be a shout. 
---
So those stats will cover everything in both raids? 
---
And can you duo both raids easily?

Ancestral would be BIS at bloodvelds and Kraken.

This is the first I'm learning that there even is a K/D ratio tracked in game lol

Yeah I know it's not like that 10m broke the economy or anything.  It'll just make me feel better about it, and some level 70 at Catacombs or whoever it ends up being is going to get a nice gift some day.

---
Such wise words. I'm always finding new things to do and always thinking 'shit how long has this been a feature and why didn't I know about it'
---
maybe not profitable, but i don't see anything wrong with this. barely anyone likes skilling as it is, and even when people do skill they choose afk methods over tick manip or any actual engagement. making the game enjoyable = easyscape lol such a dumb argument tbh.
---
But it doesnt get rid of all bots does it? It just bans them faster with a huge risk of banning legitimate players with no chance of appeal. 
---
Just as the bot nuke in rs3 and the increasing ban rates of bots, botters work around it. Banning people without evidence is a terrible idea.

I want to get my first ever 99! Been grinding fletching using profitable methods for the past 2 weeks. About to hit 87 and it's my highest stat. I also want to get to 85 slayer for those abby demons. Considering making an iron man, but there's too much to do on my main right now.
---
I think 90% of people play this game because of nostalgia and taking away the graphics would take away the nostalgia
---
Literally unplayable
---
What 99s do you have now?
---
Lots of quest have good rewards or teleports that make future grinding improvements a pretty good motivator
---
Plus you need to do the quest cape emote for Lumby Elite which has great rewards
---
stop needing a dramen/lunar staff for fairy rings 
---
Unlimited cabbage-port
---
30 highalch a day with no runes

and 50kexp lamp you can dump in RC

Untrimmed slayer is really the only rare/prestigious untrimmed cape these days. 99s just aren't what they used to be.

Oh shit im about to cry bro

Weird people!

Do you know if it auto screenshots the runelite page when it levels up or does it just screenshot whatever you have up at the time? Cause I may or may not have been doing some... research while woodcutting a bit ago, and I don‚Äôt even know where to find my screenshots.

None at the moment. Close to base 80s and a few skills 90+

&gt; The obvious solution is to have different items be optimal for different situations ie arclight/dhcb.

That's true, until you run out of niches, it's just delaying the inevitable and eventually you have to find a way to deal with powercreep.
---
&gt;Runescape also differentiates it‚Äôs self from other MMOs in that every player can do every activity
---
They can and still will be able to, but normal players never did and always outsourced something to someone else.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt have the game balanced for Ironman and moneymen at the same time.
---
They conflict with each other, ironmen design philosophy pushes it closer to the gear treadmill system of other MMOs where older content is made dead by newer content. The alternative, attachscape, is better for the economy and keeping content alive for as many people as possible, truly giving it the old school feel as older content can remain viable for far longer. As well as making an easy progression path for returning players, but over time it becomes unreasonable for ironmen to grind that much content.

The general rule of thumb is to never directly trade someone. You buy and sell items on the GE. The days of bartering like a medieval npc has long passed.

Man... OSRS really will just never be the same huh? I miss those days, but maybe it is cause I am being nostalgic. But back in those days, it felt like a made actual friends and would get on and have fun.. we‚Äôd play castle wars and pest control.. Tears of Guthix, etc. We didn‚Äôt really play with a purpose, just to have fun. I‚Äôve kinda done the same with my new account, a jack of all trades who isn‚Äôt focused on combat or skilling. I‚Äôve got decent stats in everything, and just want to have fun like the food old days :(

Did Jagex update the number of League points that puts players in the top 1% in a recent blog? If so what was it? I must‚Äôve missed it.
---
Big oof.
---
Probably be a bigger player base, and on a more level playing field of sorts. So may not be as bad.
---
Ok, jagex removed the ability to take birdhouses into thise places so people couldnt take near infinite brews, hiw are purple sweets diffrent?

Why does it only take and load 12 cballs when i first go put it down but when i reset it a 2nd time it loads to 30?

When I first got back into OSRS, I met a Canadian guy. We became friends and we used to do some skilling and questing together while we're on Discord. One day he stopped going online for a while and I just assumed he was busy irl.

One day he logged in. Turns out it was his best friend who logged in to tell his friends that he passed away in a motorbike accident. I was also in disbelief at first and didn't know what to think of it.

I've actually never tried it! I usually do MLM or iron ore mining, but i still dont feel like mlm is THAT afk and iron ore sucks when i just end up dropping it on the ground (xp is nice though!) Would you say i can get more or less resources from blast mining? I dont want money to be a main priority but im going for base 80s and some of these other skills can be expensive.

Unfortunatly it isn't :/ Im not even asking for a plain xp Increase on Best training, just increase on the other so we could jump from Air altar, to Earth, back to Air at a higher level, and stack them runes. If someone wants to make plain money and stick to Natures or cosmics, go for it, might not be the best xp but would be the best money therefore balanced.

Honestly the grind isnt that bad until like 70-75 at Ourania (ZMI) going from 70-77 is around 25 hours straight at max xp/h (30-32k) but it jumps up significantly at 75 (close to 40k/h) i heard that bloods are a lot more afk so hopefully it makes the grind worth it

A lot of what these older skills have as their core issue is a disparity between the afk-money-xp ratio. 
---
Fishing can make decent money with minows which are bad xp and high intensity, have great afk'ness with infernal eels which give pretty bad money/xp, and finally have high xp with barbarian fishing that gives bad money and has high intensity.
---
Runecrafting has lava runes, that for the same effort would yield immense xp in other skills for a far lower price, then they have all the money making runes which are a good balance of xp/intensity/money, and finally blood/souls.
---
Making double runes would violate the triangle somewhat because it would be very good money and very good xp (for runecrafting). I would think that making a better intense option than lava rune crafting and making a low money, low xp afk'ing method pre-77 would be the correct way to balance RC with itself.
---
But I'd vote yes to any question making Runecrafting easier lol. The entire skill should have all XP rates doubled imo.
---
you can also right click the rl screenshot button and choose open folder
---
I smiled. No teeth though.
---
:flashred: Selling Rune Scimmy 40k!!!!!!!
---
The task list was available from the start.. you could see where the points were
---
Can someone break down how pre-EoC combat was? Or point me to a write-up?
---
Everything that doesn't result in EHP, or a BiS piece.
---
By all means, keep making your 900k/hr with your hidden money maker. There's a reason nobody is doing it.
---
Reported for taking my rng (300 dry streak)
---
The intensity required to get good xp out of lava runes is enourmous while the click/attention intensity required to get good xp out of agility aren't comparable. 
---
Lava runes giving carpal tunnel memes are around for a reason. Agility is nowhere near that extreme.
---
How the fuck is splash damage a bug
---
the game is really social, it's just that all of that socializing happens within clan chats nowadays. And I super rarely see people get called noobs/xp wasting, it's almost fashionable to do. Mobile brought in a looooot of fresh noobs.
---
EHP? Help me out here
---
Yes I am a noob
---
Let be honest here. It's not the poor multi-billion dollar company that would suffer, its the engineers whose bonuses will be cut.
---
I don't mind runecrafting, think it's at a pretty solid place xp wise tbh. Now if we could make mining better I'm on board.
---
Efficient hours played.
---
it's not just OSRS, every single remastered oldschool game or simply old school games still being played today have become hyper efficient.
---
you can power mine and get 70k+/h or 3tick and get 100k+ or afk and get 30k-40k/h while runecrafting has none of those options
---
If there is that many posts,then maybe, just maybe, rc is unpleasant and poorly designed
---
Who downvoted lmao
---
Nothing makes sense anymore.
---
Nice.
---
Why don't you just grind it out, it's either extremely fast, good GP or super AFK.
---
Quest cape and 95+ Slayer on my UIM
---
lol
---
If you think anybody besides the nerds playing TL cares about the shiddy cosmetics ur wrong
---
Live action osrs show when?
---
Comedycemetery
---
Hook me with a bond and we can grind stats together :)
---
Its the lowest effort to xp to money ratio skill. Agility easily has 10 different medium intensity ways of training it that are far better than every RC method but RC.
---
Only by putting maximal effort into RC can you beat the laidback xp gains of agility.
---
Ohh. Welp never mind. I guess minnows is it. Thanks.
---
Glad to hear about this, pizza man!

&gt; ‚ÄúThis opinion is popular dummy‚Äù
---
&gt; ‚ÄúNo wtf ezscape‚Äù
---
I'd say it is worth considering, but there could be some issues with that. The two runes that would likely eclipse the others would be Air, since they have the highest multiplier, and Fire, since they are the quickest to craft.
---
I'm seeing up to 27K~ exp for Fire Runes, but that is likely without the higher level pouches since the method is targetted at low-levels. But even with that, 3x at 70 would make it around 80K per hour. While that may not seem to crazy, it is questionable for Fire Runes to surpass Lavas when Fires are just easier Lava Runes. I can't even find an exp rate for Air Runes, but it would be 10x so... That could end up quite high. There is also popular 2x runes like Nats and Astrals, which you'd effectively double their exp rates, making them like 50K exp per hour on top of high profit; not the worst thing TBH but it would mess with some of the endgame balancings.
---
So it is something that would need more information. That said, if the extra exp wasn't the full exp it could probably work well. For example, if it were half exp for additional, I could see that working pretty well. Then 3x Fires would only be double the exp, keeping them below Lavas. 10x Airs would only be 5.5x instead of 10x, which would likely still be a decent buff but not nearly as high. Astrals and Nats would go from around 25K to 37.5K instead of 50K. Anyway, I do agree that tweaks like this would be a better way to modify the skill than massive buffs to exp or far easier methods.
---
Support, it makes no sense at all that most of the runecrafting exp is absolute garbage. A lot can be done already to improve the skill without touching the max xp rates already.
---
So basically the lower level goes off a chance every ore to deplete, but the higher level goes off a timer from the first rock.
---
So the 2nd floor if waaaay more afk than the lower floor, because it's a guaranteed 15-30 secs of afk, and it doesn't matter how many ppl are on the rock.
---
2nd floor is so much more afk, it's way worth it
---
The 2nd floor makes it way better btw
---
Turn your TV on in the background. Bam instantly better with Netflix.
---
Well yeah. Because people that circlejerk that RC BAD don't do it. People that just do ZMI to bloods then souls probably don't love it, but they realize it's not that bad.
---
You cant make 1.5m/hr with agility either lmao. Lets make every skill 300k exp hour.
---
Oh I didn't know about that change in classification, that's interesting. 
---
Still, if I'm not mistaken, tech companies (and pharmaceuticals to my understanding) already tended to shove what would have been otherwise profit into R&amp;D to avoid taxes mainly because their variable costs are next to non-existent. It costs Walmart a fair bit of money to build a big box store in a small town, but it doesn't cost Facebook anything meaningful to have 1500 new accounts made for an otherwise remote group of people. I still prefer this world to the ceaseless expansion because at least Amazon's endless R&amp;D leads to new and potentially useful goods and services that were otherwise too financially impractical to develop.
---
LUL you must be new to that course
---
Slayer , Slayer, Slayer, and some more Slayer.
---
Why would you buy Intel period at the moment
---
Fifty percent fifty percent chance
---
maybe hes trying a lv 4 firecape and he traded over a suffering/recoils, sweets and other stuff needed?
---
Dwarven axe can smd
---
Nice! Enjoy your trophy :)
---
summoning was a cool skill
---
u can get 80k xp and be pretty afk mining. just do volcanic
---
It seems so. *woox has entered the chat*
---
*They will heal Jad if they are within 4 squares of Jad, but will stop healing if interrupted.*
---
Yeah it's gonna end around 11k so watch out at the end!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not quite sure what I Was thinking When I wrote that, il blame the christmas spirit
---
While we are at it, instead of discrete steps, make it an increasing chance. So at level 1, you have a 100% chance of making an air rune from an essence. At 6, it‚Äôs a 150% chance so you can expect 1.5 runes per essence on average. At 11, it‚Äôs 200% so you get 2 tunes per essence.
---
iPad or Android?
---
Yes, it is completely possible and that's what I thought before the password recovery. But don't you think it is a bit more targeted attempt? That scenario is a little bit less probable, i think
---
Lavas for 75k xp/hr
---
This is the problem with a lot of people who get outraged and complain. They get angry without knowing the details.
---
Its an incredibly niche and unpopular method that its not really a part of the conversation. But regardless, Arma is the only boss that *requires* prayer flicking to be solo'd successfully. 
---
You once again are doing nothing to invalidate my point but saying that another type of bug abuse is required for Arma to be anything but awful. 
---
Sure, nowadays prayer flicking isn't a bug, especially after the Infero came out, but Arma was supposed to be killable without it. The other 3 bosses are but Arma's mechanics are so bad that you still have to have methods not designed for the boss to kill it efficiently.
---
i listen to old rs music when studying it's just so good
---
Jagex leadership wanted to make the game more like WoW, and certainly whoever internally working on market research strongly suggested that was "the way things are going." 
---
Whoever was allowed into Jagex with that mentality was the toxicity that ruined the game.
---
There already is an RC guild. Just north of draynor manor.
---
I went for hunter after i got my first bond. It's pretty fast to get to red chins and it's easy to sustain membership with those.

Congratulations to /u/94sahdad for winning 15M for being the only person who commented. Thanks for the support bro!
---
This about sums it up. Still loved it.
---
I see you‚Äôre a woman of culture as well. :)
---
Blast mining is more click-intensive, but in a predictable way; it‚Äôs on a set pattern of chiseling a cavity, loading the dynamite, lighting it, and moving. It‚Äôs involved enough to keep one‚Äôs attention. 
---
You‚Äôll get a mix of mostly gold/mithril/adamant with a few coal and a few rune. Generally-speaking I just sell the rune and keep the other ores for my own smithing training (and alch the results of that)
---
Why?
---
Imagine having to play the game to advance in it
---
Good thing RS3 has Revo++ now.
---
How do you do this? I tried to do splitscreen mode on mobile on a new iPad
---
You can use them to buy amalyse(the secondary ingredient in stamina potions) and amalyse is tradeable on the GE. It works out to about 11k/mark
---
I started like 3 weeks in and might still make rune by the end it seems, lol
---
99 magic + 99 defense + 200 magic defense is LESS than 99 def + full rune.
---
Magic defense is the lowest out of the 3 combat styles across the board.

Youre insane lol

you pretty much nailed it, accumulator, artisan, selection, and i think what really screwed my pooch was the clue perk, then xeric's focus.  it's a mishmash of playstyles that isn't particularly good at anything.  don't get me wrong, i've been having fun, but the rune cup dream is long dead.
---
Don't. I got PTSD from those back in the day.
---
The account has some weird skills too.

20 mining 32 smiting, 18 fishing and 10 cooking.

Soo.. judging by this, do you think raw sharks will drop from 900 again?
---
Then get your own and stop bitching about free shit you little rat
---
How can they make more money if that's MAX CASH STACK
---
I‚Äôm not sure. This photo was yoinked from Twitter it seems someone saw him
---
It doesnt make it irrelevant if it comes from harder content is my point
---
I like it. Great for hybriding and places.
---
However, it should not give defense penalty. You already sacrifice 25% defense boost by not using piety.
---
I think RC is in a good place. There isn't much gated behind an extremely high RC besides a couple diaries. I rather they focus on agility. If you get to 77 RC you will be rewarded with afk, good gp methods. My gripe is agility. It is so slow and all the best rewards are gated behind diary requirements. Why should you train to xx agility level for you to be unable to even use the fucking shortcut. It is the only slow skill gated by other skills when it comes to rewards. It's lazy design.
---
You've clearly put a lot of thought into this
---
The swampletics circle jerk is real
---
Is this the crossover episode between Wallstreetbets and 2007scape?
---
Magic defence is based 70% on your magic level or 50% in some game modes for PVP. 
---
Even over armadyl, it‚Äôs a +80 magic defence boost which is huge. 
---
I would vote no to this purely because of the huge boost it offers. We need to be conscious of power creep for the longevity of the game. 
---
This would be a lot more reasonable if it offered +20 on armadyl with no attack bonuses, it would still be BiS.

---
Holy moly...
---
thank you sir.
---
It's a lot chiller. I use eternal glory and con cape to tele. No need charge glories, no need for stamina potting. I use all 4 pouches. Supposedly, if you use 3 pouches it's faster on the long run, also if you teleport to legends guild with quest cape you cut down a lot of time because of the loading when you tele to house. Even my 'slow'  fairy ring methood is at same speed as abyss rc.
---
Called alching. It‚Äôs the fastest way to train your mage level
---
i think he just need some milk
---
wow!
---
Hmm... what are people's thoughts on raw sharks right now? They're sitting at around 900, up from 600 a few months ago. Is it a good idea to sell now before they drop, or hold for rises?
---
Okay thanks, do they make money from it or just gain magic xp?
---
You need to be kneeling the other way
---
Lmfao
---
It depends on the item being alched
---
it's 70% on magic and 30% defense. It's actually harder to get more magic resistance than melee/range since you need 2 skills.
---
This equipment has no defense bonus aside from magic, and no offensive stats of any kind.
---
I dunno, Armadyl has other stats besides magic defense.
---
As nice as the idea of "giving to the new players," sounds, doing drop parties in f2p is always abyssmal. I usually get bored like once a month and do some sort of drop party and giveaway. Not a ton, usually like 2-4m. But thats multiple rune set, and a couple gilded pieces. Ill do a drop party, with a trivia contest for some other drops. WITHOUT FAIL, I get two sets of people afterwards. Theres the ones who are mad they didnt get anything and claim its rigged (in the partyroom?) and that I'm the asshole. Then theres the group of people who cant seem to speak english and just spam "Plz me 25k" and trade me over and over the entire time im online. Granted, I still end up forgetting how bad f2p giveaways are and do them, but they always end like this and it leaves such a sour taste in my mouth.
---
It is not the fastest way by any means but it is a pretty cheap and viable way to do so.
---
That would probably make air runes one of the best xp/hr, support XD
---
You‚Äôre facing the wrong way
---
Well, that's fine because mainstream content creators are exempt from critique.
---
I'm a nearly maxed (Im like level 82 of 89 possible lol)  30 def pure and my thoughts are that it just might  
---
A lot of pkers still like pvp worlds over BH worlds, in bh you usually fight people exactly your level.  at 89 combat I'd be 60 attack, 99 str, 99 range, 99 mage, 99 hp, 49 prayer (1 more prayer level and it'd be 90 combat)  At this level BUT WITH 1 def they'd be level 82 with 45 def they'd be level 93 . These variants mean that in BH you can fight all 3 of these builds, with 1 def less likely to see zerks. However in pvp worlds you fight people all the time 10 or 15 levels higher or lower.  I think in terms of deep wildy clanning, clan wars, and pvp worlds users 30 defense will be appealing because things like d claw rushing will be way stronger then before, and the combat "bracket" differences don't matter. In BH as 30 def right now vs a zerker it's mostly rng, I can spec a zerk out, but he can spec me out, so it's not like 30 def is terrible or anything.   
---
TLDR: Clanners/rushers, and pvp world players are very likely to consider 30 def. This also makes zerkers/40 def build stronger.   armor will probably be expensive so it'll be as common as low level defense pures, or mage pures (with 40m gear for damage)
---
&gt; I'd say it is worth considering, but there could be some issues with that. The two runes that would likely eclipse the others would be Air, since they have the highest multiplier, and Fire, since they are the quickest to craft.
---
Also mind runes, as you can literally teleport right to the altar
---
level 92 prayer healed you 20% of the damage you did so you never needed food if you prayer flicked it
---
summoning pets doubled your inventory size
---
You want reward values to go down the shitter like they did in RS3? No.
---
Penguin spies really brought players together.
---
alching is by no means the fastest way to earn mage xp, however u can make decent money from it and all u have to do is left click your mouse
---
*extremely*
---
I don't think this is necessary. Those other weapons are 2 handed. They're powerful but you sacrifice your offhand slot.
---
Also at vork doesn't dhcb out perform tbp and tbow?
---
Why shouldn't there be?

I don't remember it having a delay pre-eoc...

yeah, i'm not saying that it's wrong for everyone, just that for my play style and the limited amount of time i can put in, i think i would have been better off with konar's blessing and way of the warrior, etc, rather than what I picked. there's no *wrong* way to play, of course, but in terms of making the most of my time, i could have picked better, i think.  Not trying to say this is for everyone, not sure why some of the replies are acting like i did lol.
---
What a time to be alive
---
Honestly I liked all of those things even if they were op.
---
Pack yak was probably too much, esp with banking but it took a ton of charms and money
---
Curses took a ton of money
---
Overloads also took a ton of money and we‚Äôre an actual reward for herblore
---
Chaotics were op and cheap but they were a great reward from probably the best skill ever made
---
From experience getting 99 fishing i dont even think im halfway lol. The xp required gets ridiculous. Think half the xp you need total for 99 you get at above 90
---
Untrimmed? Nice. Make sure to keep it that way!!
---
That‚Äôs how I started out. I was a baby pure/skiller and being 40ish cb in a 1500 total world I never really got pked doing black chins, which I heavily prefer. Red chins are aids unless you do the western province diary
---
Clicking once a minute at Zeah while matching Netflix absolutely massive.
---
Cooking is enough of a grind for me :D
---
I lost 7 in a row, won 1, then lost another 7 in a row. I martingaled for the first 5 stakes.

I mean when eoc first came out, he could have just used a mouse w/ keybinds

Wait quick 100k? Does this apply to ironman?
---
 Reddit is full of idiots with limited scope and knowledge of a game trying to make devs change stuff. This isn't isolated to osrs. And a majority of the time the suggestions are bad and games are even ruined because of devs listening to Reddit.
---
Dds is almost always better; while the halberd hits hard it's _so_ slow that it ends up being not that great overall.
---
Well your pickaxe head did sometimes come off iirc.

He libeled Nick by citing a cookie monster joke as a source for holocaust denial. Also said he wouldn't debate him because he killed him in GTA.

Doesnt look too tight tbh
---
Low level slayer masters (mazchna, vannaka, chaeldar), most slayer places due to catacombs, over half of the things in the cooking skill, over half of the things in construction, hops farming etc. etc.
---
oh my bad
---
I've always had this idea of what if you got xp per runes crafted instead of per essence crafted. It would absolutely make rc training way more bearable. It'd never happen though, because of all the sweaty nerds with rc cape, who want everyone to suffer too so that their fake accomplishment isn't devalued.
---
girl
---
I quit 2 weeks ago, lol i'm still in rune, guess i should push a bit more to maintain it
---
The dream came true!

Arf arf, im   a seal!!! *clap clap clap*

---
could be quest done to get diary reqs for bis armor
---
And didn't pay any taxes. #YangGang2020
---
At 54 RC, in terms of speed/exp, is nature or law runes faster? With no weapons, abyss is harder for law runes isn't it?
---
I hope they keep the change. :)
---
have you done master clues yet? you get tons of points for very little time investments. Also, Konars blessing really isnt great for points since you can essentially only use it for slayer. Its great if you want to camp bosses, but getting points there takes forever
---
Clue Relic may still still be able to pull you out of your slump! Running around is a problem for you, but there's ~7,200 points to be had from doing clues alone. Just pick slayer tasks that are easy for clues and go to town. They're super easy to gather and complete with the Relic and almost impossible without it. This makes it a huge boost for you compared to the Konar's Blessing/Dihn's crowd. You may struggle hitting Dragon but Rune seems well within your grasp.
---
Doing a bunch of Alchemical Hydra may get you some points too, you've got an ok set up for it.
---
yep! first 99, going to keep it untrimmed when i go for 99 range. I just have to drop it when i pickup my second cape right?
---
Near infinite? Don't you think you're exaggerating a tad bit? Also that has nothing to do with how the sweets are being used which is primarily for tick-eating. Trust me if someone as stupid as you tried to utilize sweets as a form of infinite food by tick eating then you'd probably quit the game before accomplishing anything with them. You seem to gloss over how fucking difficult it is to never miss a tick eat for hours.
---
When you demand change in a game the change requires the support staff to spend time on that change instead of spending time elsewhere. I think it‚Äôs fair for someone to not want the limited time of the support staff to be spent on something that doesn‚Äôt bother them. People like you act like making changes to a game takes no time and is free. Development in one area means less in others.
---
I can hear all the whiners screaming about rs3 now...
---
The problem isn't that the bot won't know what to do, it's that it's inputs would be delayed. 600ms ping isn't much in the grand scheme of things, but for computers and electricity it's something
---
r/cutenoobs
---
Clicking once a minute for 300 hours...
---
I suppose. But that's a thin line to walk, filling out progression without making mid/high-level content a cakewalk. It's the reason Jagex is reluctant on releasing T80+ armor and weapons, even with extremely hard content like inferno and ToB.
---
Arguably takes less
---
Hey Mr. Burger what was your old name
---
How many "random" level 3's do you think enter that area lol...
---
Double exp doesn't exist here. Don't trust anyone. Slayer good. Farming good.
---
I've gotten 2.9m rc in the last 2 weeks here. I've uhhhh had an extreme amount of downtime at work and this skill is pretty easy to not pay be that interactive.
---
Outside of work the weather is shit and doing bloods is easy as hell while watching netflix and RD alting.
---
Skilling is dead content for mains unless it's for a diary/req.  Pvm is such superior option money making wise it's not even close.
---
Why don't we start adding people from here, so we have active friends?

This is why I never bankstand at ge lol.

Lmao you‚Äôre not tricking us. Girls don‚Äôt play osrs
---
If I recall right didn't soul split also smite you? I remember people who would refuse wilderness fights if people were using soul split due to how broken it was.
---
I guess but 71 Magic for the teleport (and NPC contact) is a bit of a high barrier if the reason you‚Äôre training RC is for the runes for training magic.
---
why
---
the ol' reliable strawman

I believe at 21.5k pts you can buy 1 of everything from the rewards store including the T3 outfit

Eyyy thats  my first 99 and still my onlu 99! Congrats!
---
Mole Slippers, Dragon Hunter Crossbow?, Salve Amulet (e), Whiteberries, Black beret??, ??, ??, probably one of the special bones from the Rag and Boneman subquests (x2), eye of newt
---
In PvP, magic is actually the most accurate skill. Compare the attack to defense ratio.
---
Both PvM and PvP magic defense is the weakest. in terms of accuracy, magic is most accurate in PvP, while in PvM it's either very accurate or very bad depending on the NPC.
---
You ok?
---
I think it‚Äôs a great idea, except for things like air runes, if you have 8x air runes it‚Äôll be the best in the game thorough training rc. Maybe only allow it for higher lvl runes, like cosmics, astrals, laws, nature‚Äôs as well. Just the 2x would be a great solution to how aids runecrafting is. But there will always be those players who already have 99 and will say that their achievement is devalued. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk

When you run away from the altar too fast and the praying animation faces the wrong way

if you left-click on an item in your inventory and choose ''examine'' you will see   
---
an icon of scales and a price: this is the price of the item in the grand exchange
---
An icon of a beaker next to three dots: This is the [high-level alchemy spell](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/High_Level_Alchemy) available at level 55 magic. Other low-level players might be using the [Low-level alchemy spell](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Low_Level_Alchemy) available at 22 magic.   
---
What players are doing is finding an item that has a higher cost when the spell is used, and alching the item for gold.   
---
some players might be doing this for magic experience and not caring about the cost, but most players are finding an item that when it is alched they gain gold.   
---
They are then purchasing that item in the grand exchangewielded and using a fire staff (unlimited file rune when whielded) and nature runes.   
---
Every time you cast the spell you get magic XP.

Wasn't kept quiet for a long time, the mods banned the threads for it on Reddit. People were trying to make it public, and outside of reddit it was known. To top it off it only remained slightly hidden for a short.period of.time until, surprise surprise, Rendi made it widely known.
---
Someone will always go for the fame. Even before Rendi people were trying to get the Reddit Karma for it.

And he is ignoring forthos dungeon as well, so he just wants content designed specifically for himself, not necessarily for "the 80-90%"

It's well documented that once america has had enough immigration the possibility of any republican president will be zero. But besides that it is just hypocritical. If Israel was getting an influx of immigrants that would turn it "brown" then he would consider it genocide(which he should btw).
---
Do ZMI, it's not that bad
---
16601 are at 99 RC. If we assume that the average number of players from misplaceditems is the total number of players (this estimate will be smaller), then that‚Äôs 64324 players based on the most recent quarter. That‚Äôs 25% maxed. So if only 25% of players reach what you call casual, what do you even call the remaining 75% that are below that?
---
Watch rendi's videos. You'll understand why what you said makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
---
it‚Äôs torvesta
---
It‚Äôs all because of youtube, figuring everything out yourself isn‚Äôt really a thing anymore which is why I think I don‚Äôt play video games as much anymore or maybe I‚Äôm just getting old. Lol
---
When is the Christmas event over?
---
TIL wsb and 2007scape are linked
---
By saying less top-tier content, I didn't mean "more low-tier content." 
---
I honestly just meant less focus on it and more focus on other things.
---
I'm sure if OP's suggestion were made into reality, Jagex would adjust the xp rate for low level runes accordingly. Maybe giving diminishing xp per multiple or something. 1x xp for single runes, 1.5 for double, 1.75 for triple etc. and then slightly lowering the base xp given would likely be pretty balanced.
---
I like rcing, one of my favorite skills lol
---
I looked up the twisted bow/dihns guide. I hadn't seen it myself and only had it explained to me by a friend who apparently explained it wrong. I see what you're saying now.
---
My only point was that the main way that people kill Arma is through bug abuse with chins. Back in 2007 the boss was unevenly balanced. Your point that things have changed is fair, though I'd still argue that Arma should be made easier given the relative difficulty of the other 3 bosses.
---
You don't have to personally insult me over and over again just because you disagree with me. Your points are valid, I just see the boss as being designed poorly and that people came up with creative solutions to get around the poor mechanics.
---
Mentioning being maxed really only works in a context like this. Whether they were inefficient or not with their time, anyone who maxed toiled over the skills. Many then follow the same mentality of hazing and such where something may suck, but I did it so you have to or I‚Äôll feel shitty.
---
Depends what you're doing. Spamming CoX? Go sang.
---
Doing slayer with the occasional GWD trip? Go kodai.
---
You should watch rendis lvl 9 fire cape. You don‚Äôt wear the ring for the recoil. You fill the ring to refresh your recoil. You uncultured swine ;)
---
you're post 77 so you saved yourself 1hour and 15 mins of bloods which is 90% afk? :S
---
I remember the shooting star and evil trees
---
I know how the system works I made almost 5B doing it lol
---
Lunars is a far greater barrier than 71 magic is.
---
No because the point is to give bludgeon a new purpose
---
That would make a bit more sense. The problem with that is the more bosses you'd have with those unique drops, the fewer options you'd have for new bosses. Perhaps limiting to a few would work better than limiting to one; for example, who should get Red Spider's Eggs? We currently have two Spider bosses that both drop them in bulk. But that is already fairly niche, kinda like the KQ and Potato Cactus, so even if other bosses or monsters drop some it isn't a huge issue.
---
It might help to work on a list of which bosses lack a unique skilling resources and which skilling resources are vastly overused. Then maybe we could get a better idea of what could be tweaked around. That said, whenever you remove a big drop like Battlestaves from a boss, it will likely need to be replaced with something else.
---
you're post 77 so you saved yourself 1 hour and 15 mins of bloods which is 90% afk..?
---
A kobble of nutz boy.
---
To be fair when r/cutenoobs is used properly it‚Äôs pretty great, but yeah sometimes you have the elitist players with swamp ass who post just to shit on another player for not having barrows gloves or not having a fire cape lol. Then sometimes they try to tell that player in game why they‚Äôre ‚Äúplaying wrong‚Äù and being all condescending. 
---
Imo that sub should be about supporting players playing how they want to while also finding some humor in their innocence, and I think the best posts reflect that.
---
Nom nom nom
---
Like skilling? Go for westerm hards and do red chins to 99. Like afking? You can do yews or magics at wc guild to 90 then redwooods, fishing has options too id do karambwans til 90 then anglers to 99. Like pvm and want to learn a boss? Get 75 magic and learn zulrah.
---
I don‚Äôt like Ironman mode just because you really do go about the game solo. I wish there was a large group ironman mode, like for example you create your account and the stipulation is you can not use the G.E. Or trade with players who can use the G.E. We can call it local Ironman or something, and they can only trade with other local Ironman who also can not use the G.E. I feel that would bring back the feeling of the good years much more than just Ironman mode does today.
---
No you cant....
---
I actually don't mean that at all, that's putting words in my mouth.
---
I just want Jagex to not forget skills and glaring QOL issues. Like the game client itself.
---
&gt; Mentioning being maxed really only works in a context like this. Whether they were inefficient or not with their time, anyone who maxed toiled over the skills. 
---
False. Max players have very different mentalities for the aforementioned reasons.
---
&gt; Many then follow the same mentality of hazing and such where something may suck, but I did it so you have to or I‚Äôll feel shitty.
---
Incorrect. Things have to be anchored on firm principles, this is how we know what things in the game represent, what is a whip, what is a fire cape, what is bgloves, if all this was "up in the air" "why shouldnt I be allowed to do bgloves in 40 qp just because u did it in 175" is not a foundation a game can be based upon. Go play a private server where you customize your stats. Thats more suitable for you.
---
because I half expected this post to be a setup to reveal your old name was like cum fart or something

Probably the best thing you could‚Äôve told them tbh

Wait did you have a Karils crossbow?
---
Truthfully I always liked exchanging the star dust for XP, for me it was more about training mining in a more social way. Removing the level cap and scaling the rewards (be it items or XP) to level makes sense though. Also made my PoH feel more useful with spotting where it‚Äôd be landing. Aside from that, I really like the idea for the axe and other events.
---
I picked up a Microsoft surface a few years ago from an estate sale, and it runs RuneLite. Overall, it‚Äôs a little slow but the newer ones might be better.
---
I jsut made a post asking if I can just use my current account lol
---
Combining consistent money like vork and zulrah with things like bandos (or any gwd), demonic gorilla's, and higher level Slayer has built my bank from like 100m to 500m in like 3 months. That got me to the point where I'm doing raids and stuff to make money for the big ticket items as well
---
Different degrees of casuals. But I wouldnt refer to them as anything other than casual, that would be mislabeling them. I consider myself pretty casual.
---
Man, back in 2013 and some of 2014 when Dlegs/skirt drops were 110% worth camping Iron dragons even at a low level...  I agree though, DS2 was a very fun journey and I appreciate the work that went into it.
---
Yeah the surface seems like one of the only options since it runs windows. Might have to scoop one
---
And you got very lucky
---
No. It doesnt say anything about the fact that RS is a sand box game.
---
ackshually MIDI is only the interface they use to control the sounds, MIDI doesn't provide any sounds itself
---
Same thing happened with me in my cc Clan Matrix. Clans make it more interactive and it's fun to have a group of people to do stuff in and celebrate achievements. Glad to hear ur cc is doing the same :D
---
People have already done that. Figuring out a way to ensure every wave can be approached in such a way that you never have a ranger and mager firing at you in a way that can't be tick eaten is the hardest part, then of course executing everything perfectly.
---
Use a bond? Not that difficult
---
is 77 really only 50 hours? Seems like it'd be way longer. Not trying to rebut you though
---
Sang for chambers and zulrah
---
Kodai for everything else.
---
Your definition of casual is horribly flawed.
---
Really? I haven't done it but the 61 Crafting looks like the only other difficult requirement to meet. The rest seems to just be a big time investment.
---
Hey buddy don‚Äôt know if you know but it‚Äôs the holidays and a lot of us have families to visit so we don‚Äôt really understand the logic in buying internet for a house I don‚Äôt live in or will be in after tomorrow. Happy holidays though!
---
Doing things that are dailies for me is something that completely takes the fun out of video games. I would suggest to you to just stop doing them completely and do other things instead to find fun in the game. Ex: instead of doing your dailies do a daily trip to a random boss.
---
Oh well, Adamant is good enough I guess. I have 6800 points, which is enough for the Slayer helm recolour and the home teleport animation. Kinda want the T2 outfit as well, but meh

afk ess mining fucking lmfao... this is the type of guy that decides the future of the game
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Twisted_League#Rewards

Yeah screw people who want to be apart of something amirite
---
Because people are babies and want AFK fast xp rates. I genuinely believe most people complaining about rc don't even do it properly.
---
Depends on how you slay (purely xp, bossing for pets, money). Determine which tasks best fit your slaying style, then use a slayer spreadsheet that shows you net point gain/loss depending on which tasks you block/skip. Block the most commonly assigned tasks (highest task weighting) you don't want to do and skip the rest
---
How can people use abyss appropriately for law runes then? Only aim for agility tunnel?
---
And lava runes makes, but I guess I want to balance the utility of the craft with exp rates and I'd have jo use for lava runes.
---
The user who posted this screenshot on reddit also has a YouTube channel, do you think he posted it hoping to get attention and people would go to his profile and find his channel then subscribe? Or did he just post it to share

How are tedious and this guy different?

imagine unironically using apple products and thinking it's not your fault when shit like this happens
---
He‚Äôs on mobile not on runelite
---
Relics
---
This sounds like something apple would do. I would be happy with just a ticket system where you submit a ticket and a jmod can manually enable pc login using the same or specified credentials, but currently that is impossible. You literally don't even have runescape credentials/login with game center. Your account is just floating in the void that is your AppleID.
---
Sang staff is best in slot for magic at Zulrah at the moment. If you can‚Äôt afford a Twisted Bow, bring a blowpipe/gear switch for blue phase. More kills per trip will come when you perfect the mechanics of the boss and figure out how to make zero mistakes on all kills
---
Who cares what the crasher feels? Not like doing this is going to change anything whatsoever. People will crash, some people are just giant fucking cunts and there's nothing we can do about that. I've been grinding corp for a moderately long time and nothing annoys me more than getting crashed. And the thought that some people have been crashed like this for sigils infuriates me. But rather than bitching and moaning about it I wanted to do something somewhat creative. I never once even asked anyone to upvote this, nor do I know who you even are. I posted this passively on my friend's discord which isn't even completely centered on runescape, not once did I demand upvotes.
---
Maybe people don't want to take the time to answer this question, but I'm curious to know how people rank the 23 skills in terms of enjoyment. Happy holidays all!

This meme is worse than talking to Oziach.
---
Fuentes uses "jokes" all the time to display his political views, to minimize the backlash, repercussions and risks. He has hinted on supporting H-caust denialism several times, it is quite apparent.
---
Yeah each to their own. That‚Äôs what makes the game what it is. The fact you can play it how you want with or without restrictions.
---
&gt;  I wished people who don't like aspects of this game wouldn't comment on it.
---
You don't like the aspect where people in an MMORPG have differing opinions, so perhaps you shouldn't comment on it :)
---
I really hope this fixes it. I will follow up if it doesn't work.
---
I already know how zulrah works and everything Im not that nooby :P Was just wondering why Kodai wasnt an option for Zulrah.
---
:'(
---
If you aren't planning on playing a Hardcore, there is a good chance you could die early, which would forever be on the hiscores. Most probably don't care about that, but it is a reason to make a normal Ironman...
---
Yes, that is a semi-afk, good profit, slow xp method. 
---
If you read my response I was asking for a interactive (little to no afk), little to no profit, higher xp method.
---
Delet sounds exactly like he would pronounce delete.

My information is old but they believe the future will not include media hosting. Content will be so accessible all the money will be in producing content. Theys why it's worth it to invest in producting content at a loss now.

Symphony of Shadows was a good QLIMAX anthem. Proud of B-Front and a much deserved anthem‚Äî his collaborations with PN (the Solution &amp; the paradox) show that he‚Äôs still got it in him.

Seems Heady is slowing down as of late, kinda like Brennan Heart. He‚Äôs still amazing but I‚Äôm concerned he‚Äôs going the way of NC since Bas split with Arjan. The new generation is good thankfully.
---
Your goal isn‚Äôt to go from 80 rn to 99, it‚Äôs to get 100k per day, or something like that. Be realistic but challenge yourself. Also bang out the slow ones first. Now that I‚Äôm maxed my goal isn‚Äôt to get the cox pet it‚Äôs to do 8-10 cox runs per day and maybe get lucky. Gotta be realistic within your own limitations my good sir
---
I died to a mage blast while protecting from ranged, i was out of food and gambled with 17 HP left, then died. Only after a few seconds after i died, did i realise that i got the pet drop.

Percy voted for trump
---
Hopefully it doesn't take us that long to get it, lol. Good luck to you, friend.
---
Ah okay! Well some people are learners with lots of money for that kinda stuff so I was just making sure. But yeah basically kodai attacks a tick slower (5ticks) than Sang (4 ticks) which inherently makes Toxic trident/Sang staff 20% more DPS. Also, having the Sang staff/Toxic trident takes away the need for a rune pouch, unless using Vengeance. Also, I believe the attacks with the sang/trident are more accurate than Kodai would be, but im not 100% sure on that. So basically yes theoretically you could use Kodai but Sang is just better in every aspect.

Did you have a stroke writing this?
---
it‚Äôs fight caves
---
Alrighty, then
---
Picture this if you will

10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes
---
In my "need to know" pose, just outside of Area 51
---
Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy
---
When just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
---
Like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
---
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
---
And stopping right at my Birkenstocks
---
And me yelping, "holy fucking shit!"
---
Just out of curiosity if you or someone happens to know. Does runite ore from blast mining complete master clue steps?
---
How did you make 14m in F2P?
---
Personally i'd use them on agility, find it far worse than post 77 runecrafting. its slightly better xp/h but far more click intensive, tedious and you literally gain nothing but marks whilst rc makes you bank.
---
H
---
The earliest they have removed it in the past was on the 4th of January, but have gone as far as the 10th of January. Pretty likely its in the middle of that.
---
Get it!!!!!!
---
Without POH cape you'd probably get less gp due to using law runes to tele. But nice find, lad!
---
What is the method for 4 cb Fire cape? Just a few days ago people were theorizing that it could be possible IF you could avoid overhead prayers. 
---
So without Prayer, what is the method for 3 or 4 cb firecape?
---
Damn investors should look into this.
---
This is fishy, 13 mil xp fishy
---
Can you not? The wiki makes it seem like you just need a successful hit independent of the hit
---
Items with low trade volumes are updated once every few days or once a week. [source ](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange)
---
have you tried wearing female clothes, the pockets suck lmao
---
Runespan sucks balls and is actually as fast as you would think
---
Running Souls at like 91 yaves admittedly too much xp per hour but at91 you should be getting considerable rates kind of off topic but yeah
---
Mod Warden has and from what I've experienced and seen so far in a short amount of time he's had has all the Elder Gods balls twisted up in a knot killin the game
---
Coming from a maxed out combat old school old school RuneScape player
---
Herb
---
bro you are just one chuck away from tbow go get it !
---
Fuck Toby tell him to go back to Costa Rica
---
Yeah that's fine. Even if it wasn't people AHK eat and spec in high risk pvp everyday and don't get banned
---
Nice it was my first 99 too. What's next? I'm going with herblore.
---
What are your stats? You using the chin method? Been looking to get into some kree
---
Obvious troll
---
Amythyst is pretty AFK though... not a lot of running around or bank standing... easy to keep it casual and still get decent xp in the long run...  
---
The thing about Ironman though is because trading is out, you're forced to work a lot harder than someone on a normal account, even if they're on grindy skills like mining.   
---
Move onto a production skill like Smithing or Crafting, and you're forced to gather everything you need by hand, and it will take a lot longer. As a guy who does like to make everything he needs it's still nice to be able to trade for the basic stuff once in a while.
---
Buy a bond
---
Yeah you can‚Äôt. A successful 0 cant land a poison hit.
---
Lol I was shamed for wearing slayer helm or meleeing while wearing range gear and ava‚Äôs.  For context I‚Äôd hop there between slayer tasks to break up the grind. Those efficiencyscape assholes are out there
---
This is what I said verbatim
---
Hmm.. I feel like I opened pandora's box with that question.  
---
I like herb, but if you're a richboi it's pretty fast...mining tho.
---
I dont want dummy rates
---
I just liked when every 4-5 levels got something interesting
---
But now i need 13 levels to get anywhere and also those 13 levels represent so much more grind than the 13 previous levels.
---
I agree, I'm at the Barb fishing spot right now to get my easy xp out of the way.  82agility, so I'm just a few levels from afkscape.
---
99 range mage and hp, 91 defence, with rigour unlocked. I did use the chin method, spent a fair bit of time catching them btw
---
yeah but did you know you can take a screenshot on your computer as well?
---
You can buy them online although it is way cheaper to just do a at home print on a hoodie
---
Earn money for maxed range, melee, and mage gear and also max out my combat and 99 Slayer.
---
What skill will you complain about if runescape becomes ezmode?
---
Oh, I see. I thought he was talking about Woox's reply to the tweet. Yeah, you're right that he can possibly just wanna post lol.
---
Why fletch?
---
I know. A lot of Ironman stuff is afk too, just slow.
---
HAHAH fucking rip
---
Think about how logs have absolutely crashed in price.  That's not botters lil
---
People have been saying Zulrah bots are back. So more scales are in the game, therefor price goes down.
---
Yet agility got updates that increased its xp per hour at all levels.
---
Should trolling really be a bannable offense?
---
damn, nice luck, my man
---
Sounds like my ban appeals for botting around that time.

Get hella dosh
---
Xzact mentioned there are 4 waves that need to be solved for no overheads. Certainly one of these legendary pvmers will solve it if it‚Äôs possible.
---
I thought 3 cb would be possible with 0 hits but apparently that‚Äôs not true so the 4 cb would be the lowest unless someone finds a new mechanic to deal with the 180s
---
Gear
---
Slay helm, anguish, karil top and bottoms(well arma top and bottoms now lol), pegs, bgloves, black chins / rcb switch, avas, diamond bolts, crystal shield, ring of suffering
---
Inventory
---
Rcb, mith grapple, ecu key, b2p tablets, ancient staff, blowpipe, 3 range pots (tried without, really prefer with), 6 brews (started at 8, been going down - 4 to 5 should be plenty - rune pouch w blood barrage, 2 trollheim tele tabs, rest super restores :)
---
Lekker pik
---
Do you have a link for this? I didn‚Äôt think there was a specific 1 requirement
---
Ga eens spelen dan :v
---
Irl methods to max both these skills?
---
Ive done around 2000 zulrah, 800 cerb, 500 DKs, 600 hydras, etc etc on my iPad (actually catching minnows in splitscreen while im typing this comment). Sure, you might lose a tick here or there because of a misclick, but two big advantages are 1) having two hands is awesome: can use one to move,one to use the menu: this helps a lot for zulrah and cerb for example, in their aoe attacks that pop up while you also really wanna eat or switch prayer; and 2) being able to do it anywhere, with anything in splitscreen. I take a train to/from work, where i nearly always watch youtube/netflix while playing RS; its nice for on the couch/in bed, etc. Would definitely recommend trying it out with an open mind if you have a tablet.
---
Sooka (Cyka) means bitch, byoolot is how they say fuck I think
---
If its in runelite, its allowed. Runelite has entirely complied with jagex law, per jagex.
---
Boooooo
---
I'm guessing its other people like me who quit because of the game changes and are coming back when they find out they can basically get the og game experience again plus some new content
---
Botting
---
The idea behind boss pets is to show an achievement of earning a pet right? All six of the brothers do not even wear shoes, let alone boots lol.. the relevance isn‚Äôt there. Barrows pet idea has been tossed around so much.. the best response from this sub was a chest that followed you
---
I've been trying to get Jad as a task for ages now. 30+ tasks skipped and completed yet no Jad task...
---
Only if they got 8.25s
---
Thank you and the entire team for the fantastic content, looks like 2020 will be just as great, and u/JagexSween thank you especially‚Äî you get too much hate but a few of us genuinely appreciate all your work and candor
---
Wilcum to de swump
---
Knife and hammer are classic items of the game. This is a slippery slope towards toolbelts.
---
&gt; people love it because it's fun
---
A bit disingenuous because to a lot of the community, fun just means they don't have to interact with the game. It's really obvious when you check the high scores and all the top skills are just the fastest, most AFKable skills, with combat skills at the top because most people care more about PvM.
---
They continue to update it based off what the community wants, add the players voting for what comes into the game it‚Äôs extremely player friendly
---
Correct, but xzact was showing off an actual way to tick eat melee attacks earlier which allows 0xp meleer kills.
---
can you please do everyone a favor and delete this before the front page is flooded with pun posts for a week
---
You‚Äôd get duplicate sire pieces
---
There's a 50/50 chance to get barrows gloves from barrows if you talk to Oziach.
---
Pretty sure if they can get level 4 then they can get level 3 now. This is crazy stuff.
---
That‚Äôs very exciting. Does he stream?
---
&gt; The truth that no one‚Äôll admit is that PvM has gotten out of hand and drop tables need drastic roll backs to 2007 era
---
A lot of players admit this, even the JMods admitted this, it was either Wolf or Ayiza I think who were pretty clear on Q&amp;As that they think that they overbuffed PvM droptables when they did the Slayer buffs back before I even started playing.
---
Those lemon stealing whores
---
Why the fuck do people get so worked up about what random strangers equip their fantasy game avatar with? I never once have given the slightest shit about what player around me were wearing.
---
Feedback welcome :)
---
Lol, bots can 100% perform tick perfect actions. With ease. It's not even a sweat.
---
Fuck.
---
Got'me.
