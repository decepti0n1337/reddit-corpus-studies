I'm 2002 kc and only ever got a single prim around 1500kc. :(
---
Bruh that bone whip needs a new model 
---
Restart your computer and when it‚Äôs turning on you can hit and switch that gives you access and you can swap it around where you f keys are first and you hold down FN to use the other features. Google it for your computer, a simple easy fix in 5 minutes. 
---
The fact that scythe still beats it on olm just means it needs a buff. Scythe does need some love too, particularly in the prohibitive use cost. When people are willing to pay 1b to use an uncharged item you know there's a problem.
---
Idc how it looks, I don‚Äôt want it in the game. If this is put in the game, people will no longer use whips. It‚Äôs a direct power creep that‚Äôs completely unnecessary. Furthermore, it kills a level of nostalgia and an iconic weapon. THE iconic weapon arguably.
---
Whips are already good enough for what they are, they don‚Äôt need a replacement. If they want to buff something, buff mage. Shit is dog trash. 500-600 gold per cast, less dps than range and melee, doesn‚Äôt get used anywhere. Mage needs buffs
---
I‚Äôm not just saying names. Im listing off items that made power creep a thing and a rs3 weapon.  If you constantly want more or less,‚Äù BiS ‚Äú items you‚Äôre going down a slippery slope. Yes the rapier is better but you probably can‚Äôt afford it otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be posting about this lol
---
I'd be for it. I'm definitely buying that trim kit though.
---
Nah the stats are fine but definitely a useful special attack. Tbh Abby whip may as well not have one
---
Can you guess?
---
What, is your mom not around or something?
---
only gaining  half a level a year??? your not taking runescape as seriously as you should be man.
---
I mean how many accounts in general get one?
---
I know quite a few just in my clan chat that have one
---
I'd settle for "more than like 400 xp from a whole inventory and a half of supplies". 
---
I have several questions
---
the whip will not be BiS it'll just be an upgrade but alright dawg have a good day &lt;3
---
Poison damage doesn't provide exp so preferrably a normal dagger.  
---
I believe the short sword is best for exp.  
---
Note the obsidian armour and necklace only provides damage increase for obsidian weapons.
---
Besides rapier what‚Äôs better than tent
---
Deez nuts.
---
ZMI is easy af (even easier now that you can 1 click to the altar) and semi afk and zeah rc is afk
---
I'd rather have a tome for the other three elements like the tome of fire. Same exact setup, add pages to add charges. Charges are only used up for combat spells, etc. 
---
You‚Äôll be lucky if you get the beaver before 15-20m exp
---
Came to this
---
What the hell are you talking about? We literally just had tons of QoL changes for it. 
---
TIL :o
---
What's there to think about just hit accept alredy. 
---
Have you done MTA? Could use a lot of Alchs in there to get some items, I did 72-77 in MTA getting B2P, wand etc
---
Yes I was going to say the same thing! Abby whip may as well not have a special attack because it‚Äôs so damn useless. People (me included) would pay just to have a useful spec + cool cosmetic upgrade
---
Blowpipe also out dpses tbow most of the time but we‚Äôre not planning on buffing that are we
---
Jatizso!
---
Looks better than the other abyssal items
---
I believe so. You need to select low-defense monsters for it to be most effective     
---
Stab.

Spoiler alert reeeee

1. I just started playing again
---
2. It‚Äôs still as slow and shitty as before. 
---
There‚Äôs room for improvement.
---
I just read the word bananas again.
---
No it doesn't. Scythe is 1.3b item, so of course it beats generic item obtainable by slayer. Lance even might be better at cox solos, so no it doesn't need a buff. 
---
If it's his first time. The longer range will help him greatly in learning.
---
That is among the most beautiful sentences I've ever read.
---
He just got an item worth 16m GP traded in with the Emblem Trader on a BH world which is invaluable to rebuilding after losing everything on his account to a PK.
---
[removed]
---
Okay, so then you don't know what the phrase "speak for yourself" means. Got it. 
---
firstly, if you think power creep single handedly ruined rs3 you're wrong. and secondly i just said it wouldn't be BiS and you bring up the actual BiS that point is null and void. lastly, i said have a good day. stop responding lmao.
---
Nieve/steve yes, duradal no, konar hell no
---
Geomancy btw
---
We'll allow it
---
Mining guild gives invisible 7 mining boost so coal is fastest there, esp with varrock diary armor and mining gloves
---
It's an untradeable,  cosmetic, zero value, zero high alch value item. It doesn't affect the economy at all. Players afking gargoyles effect the economy in a more harmful way than anyone farming bryophyta for a pet. You also have to keep in mind it has the same key system from obor, 1 key per kill. Adding a pet wouldn't do shit to the economy.
---
where did you just steal this from? I know I just saw it somewhere other than reddit
---
Well tent is 75 so it can‚Äôt be higher than that. And let‚Äôs be real, level reqs on high level gear in this game don‚Äôt mean anything, it‚Äôs all about cost
---
What if the elite diary reward gave the player a 50 percent chance of receiving noted hydra bones after a kill. Idk how hard that would be to implement but I feel like that's a good compromise if it's possible.
---
Ahhh, can‚Äôt trust anything you see on the internet
---
&gt;The majority of the suggestions that get upvoted here suck ass.
---
They absolutely do, which is why I am so proud of the community for putting so many good ideas forward in regards to the Konar drop table. I've seen a lot of really creative ideas about how to improve that. It's kind of nice for a change
---
Hey doofus, making dead content doesn‚Äôt do any part of the game any service. And you didn‚Äôt even know what torva or drygore was so don‚Äôt tell me about rs3 lol 
---
If you ever need to vent or need someone to talk to. Just DM me. I'll listen.
---
jokes on you I have two dads 
---
the mystic colors are awesome i love it.
---
&gt; Hence why this set wouldn't be usable for bosses/demi-bosses or pvp
---
So random gear dropped by stuff like bloodvelds should be more than twice as good as raids gear? That's a fuck no from me.
---
&gt; Someone wearing BiS gear with a slayer helm on task will still out dps this gear, short of maybe mage
---
Not maybe, it is flat out better. No one needs mage accuracy since pretty much every target you fight with mage is likely to have 0 or less defence.
---
&gt; What would you suggest changing the buff for the mage to?
---
Not making the set at all. We don't need another broken void set in the game.
---
Preferably stab since it provides the most attack bonus with the sword. But I believe monster weakest and focused stat takes priority.
---
Yeah they're pretty useless
---
Do you use them efficiently? You should only be using two casts of Cure Me per fight. Just going by averages, and for a 1/512 item you'd need about 2k cosmics. 
---
He said best one handed non degradable, not best cheap one handed non degradable...
---
irons are the only ones who care about non unique drops/. for mains it might as well just only drop gp, theres no difference
---
Yeah there's no need to add the bone whip, ez no vote.
---
It's relaxing and makes bank. Hunter and agil are 50x worse imo
---
It‚Äôs stupid quite frankly. It‚Äôs like they would rather help out goldfarmers before they‚Äôd support any content that benefits an Ironman 
---
"r/Wallstreetbets wants to know your location."
---
Same with zmi right click follow. Wait 20 seconds craft runes, teleport to alter, bank repeat..
---
The only variety is when I don't get enough runes to tele back. Then it's just cwars then back to the alter.
---
Have you experienced something similar ?
---
Warped Jellys, southern crab spawn, safespotting behind other jellies on conntector bridge to sand crabs. I just noticed that I normally get one or multiple superior spawns on Bloodveld tasks, but I have yet to get a single Jelly superior. 
---
The dusk mystic was never polled..
---
If you want defense you bring meele armour.
---
Magic accuracy is usually worthless in PvM. Either you bring ancestral for the %boost or you dont bring robes at all.
---
You are acting like mystic is niche when its basically the only robe other than ancestral set that players actually use for something.
---
Seems legit 
---
Is warding confirmed
---
I didn‚Äôt take my account security that seriously and didn‚Äôt have a bank pin. And how they knew the email is linked to runescape? No idea... I only use runelite (the real one, I know there‚Äôs lots of fakes) and YouTube for help so I didn‚Äôt sign into anything malicious
---
Unless you don't want hitpoints experience, anyone splashing would be better off doing it in Nightmare Zone. It's equally as afk and gives a lot more experience.
---
So uh, what is the towel for? lol
---
Not everyone wanna throw 5 hours towards that at max efficiency. 
---
I play a lot of pest control with it (was actually using salad robes for a long time) and you know what? Still have managed to have fun without being efficient. 
---

If you have membership, slayer is a great way to make money. Otherwise just start grinding out your lvls. You‚Äôll catch on soon 
---
I'm the baby!
---
I don't care
---
Or you bring another set of robes to PVM because you like using less runes and can't pay 142 M.
---
I meant rewarding as in how interesting the skill is to level, or being able to do more interesting things at higher levels. Compared to basically every other skill RC is super linear and boring. (Now that firemaking has WT for leveling)
---
800!
---
s d
---
What? I‚Äôve dropped so many clues because I alched my tune spear. Where do I buy it?
---
I like this idea, but I also want it to still look just like a whip. It's iconic. 
---
I'll test this out on my 36 alts and let you know.
---
Fancy giving me 80m then?
---
If you think torva caused power creep, you're a little bit mongolian, aren't ya?
---
if u mean jagex\_chache\_32 , i didnt delete anything in that file also there is one application in this file name browsercontrol.dll

Ctrl+click blew my mind

I don't see anyone saying they bought cosmics in this conversation but maybe I'm blind. Regardless, Thieving and agility pyramid are both low level money makers and aren't very good. If you're going to recommend someone not do battlestaves for money, at least recommend something that actually makes good money like Slayer. I agree with you that if you want to do crafting you're better off farming giant seaweed and using superglass make and blowing glass, but battlestaves are a good supplement to that.
---
That's funny. I don't recall you making an concessions. And it seems you cant take criticism without taking it personally. So this looks to me like a case of the pot calling the kettle black, but whatever. Keep complaining about the game on reddit. It's sure to help your account progress 
---
Is the sugar free there to balance out the rest of the sugar?
---
Considering the next best Armour was 65 def bandos I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre a jagaloon to assume it wasn‚Äôt the start of it 
---
Lol i was being sarcastic. 80m is a lot and its shitty. Ive been butthurt over losing 10m i cant imagine 80m. Sorry i didnt use /s, back in my day ellipses meant sarcasm
---
What the autism. I appreciate it soldier.
---
Gz!

---
The reason the black market is so taboo is because it's not supposed to exist, and the people participating have to knowingly do things wrong to do business in it. Black markets violate the rules, and should be crushed and held back as much as possible to limit their influence and size. 
---
The same goes here. The gold-traders are knowingly violating the rules, and should be stopped as much as possible. 
---
It's not about the game. A game is a game. It's about the principle. If we let people break rules in a game, they'll start to think they can get away with more severe offences. You punish a child for stealing a piece of candy not because you're worried about them stealing something worth $0.25, but because you don't want them to think they can get away with stealing $20.00 in the future. Good people follow rules and principles, and you're justifying defying both.
---
These people can rot to death for all I care. They're breaking the rules, and they shouldn't be doing what they're doing.
---
Just came back, what did they change about the bank? the auto withdraw all thing?
---
Main use would be a lamp for Slayer exp plus a somewhat useful tele. I see your point tho
---
It is already red. The 2 pink pixels at the hilt are barely noticeable. 
---
damn.. very helpful and detailed guide.. now i can finnaly try this endgame content. thumbs up for you.. 
---
How does cannoning in single combat zones for slayer tasks work? I feel like it isn‚Äôt speeding my tasks up much. I typically melee with a whip while the cannon shoots at what I‚Äôm attacking. Should I sit in a safe spot while the cannon hits a lot of things at once like in a multi zone?? It‚Äôs just not making the tasks go much quicker.  
---
Of course there is nothing wrong inherently wrong with most things in the game, including these robes and spells. And it's not like I think the way it is right now is bad. 
---
The main thing I am trying to accomplish with something like this is to add more variety to what content you can use for your own personal play style. 
---
Currently, there is no reason to wear any specific color of mystic clothing. There is nothing wrong with this, but I think it would add a more immersive feel to the game and increase the ways that you can train both magic and combat if there was some benefit to what specific color you were wearing. 
---
The other, and in my opinion, bigger issue is that wind, water, and earth spells are not good enough. They cost virtually the same as fire spells, but do less damage. They do have lower level requirements to cast, but this is usually not a factor, because when you have enough money to cast a tier of spell, you usually already have the level to cast the fire spell.
---
Magic is also a rather expensive skill to train combat with when compared to melee or ranged. This does make sense to a certain extent, as magic is often better than melee or ranged early game. When you level up your melee or ranged, the cost is generally still relatively cheap, but magic almost universally stays much more expensive in comparison. If it were cheaper to cast certain spells (like wind spells which do the lowest damage), it would open up a new niche of training where you could still train magic in combat, but not have to spend so much. The trade off is that you would do less damage than you normally could. That way, if you like using magic as your main form of combat, you could still do so in a realistic way.
---
Another thing I want to address is the exact chance to save runes for each element. Almost any time I make a suggestion like this, there is almost always people saying that it is under powered, and people saying it is over powered. I usually try to be more conservative with how good it is, as people are generally more susceptible to saying that it is over powered. Personally, I think it the percentage to save runes should be even higher, but that doesn't leave as much room for other equipment to have a better chance to save runes.
---
Of course, there is no objective reason that anything of this has to be done. It is purely my opinion that adding more options when training combat magic improves the game in any way. If you think my ideas to add things to the game are stupid and frivolous, that is fine. In my opinion, some updates that have already come to the game are stupid and frivolous. That is the point of the polling system. If enough people think an update is worthwhile, it will usually make its way into the game. That is how osrs has become a success so far.  You are completely correct when you say the game as been working fine for almost 20 years.
---
Sarcasm very hard to translate when it‚Äôs not super obvious. I‚Äôm still of the old mindset where 10m is a lot while this sub is used to 3m/hr bosses so it‚Äôs hard to tell
---
Then how do you get across the jump after you shoot the draw bridge down without a rope?
---
Because this is a table rebalancing, not an opportunity for Ironmen to get supplies they don‚Äôt feel like gathering in the traditional way.
---
so you say make bone whip better than tent? what about Ghrazi rapier? its now equal to a bone whip/worse and its the hardest team content in the game? So do we buff it too now. good call since its so hard we give it another max hit. Now we've got people hitting 55's with a rapier in the wilderness. Npw the rapier is 1b and TOB becomes better money. Now we got more people grinding TOB for money and bringing more scythes in to the game. Now scythe prices drop and more people buy those. Now people camp COX with scythes and bring way too many tbows into the game and now everyone can afford tbows. Now everyones got tbows and inferno capes and the game is ruined? is that what u fucking want? thats what 2 strength bonus will do to this game. fucking brainlet
---
Maybe the fact that this wouldn't be meta actually makes it a decent idea. What's with this subreddit? Everything has to be BIS or else it's dead content and not worth considering.

If 40 to 50 magic is a hard grind for you and you're not an ironman, I'm not trying to sound elitist but there may be other games you'd wanna try that are a better use of your time and money.  
---
Also, yes, we all occasionally play the game in inefficient ways, however "it's usable if I don't care about efficiency" is a weak niche for an item to have from a game design perspective.
---
This is the kind of cringefest type shit that gets me through the day

---
Same! It's a pleasant chill progression with a nice side of gp
---
I'd think you'd probably want them to have a lower chance of not using runes, maybe 5% maximum across the board. Otherwise you run the risk of making it much more expensive and so more difficult to obtain for the low to mid level players it's most useful for, depriving them of one of the only affordable magic armours for that level

---
He's going to world's that aren't the official world and specifically crashing people that are using the pump part of the furnace for str xp. No one on those worlds is using the furnace to smelt bars.
---
Back before they had the official worlds people would crash clans that would run the furnace by hogging the pump to stall the furnace progress, this is the same idea, but for folks getting str xp.

Jokes on you we dont have a basement! :)

I feel like this level of undegradable power should have to cost more than the 3m it's at atm. This should be made a rarer drop chance so that the price hopefully rises to 30m.

Because theres no reason to train mage via battle magic anymore. There are tons of more efficient ways to train magic that don't emphasize combat and if this perk only affected battle spells (which it should) I could imagine a ton of maxers throwing a big fit about unfairness or something.
---
I have 6 pets at 2k total...oops
---
Maybe i should give it a look it just seems like and i genuinely haven't checked , it's low xp an hour? like maybe 40k? i don't know though i'll have a look after this post to see where it's at but , what would you think to a boost to ALL rcing exp? across the board? i think that could solve everything to be honest , or incremential additives , so the higher the rune the more exp
---
I do decently at seers even without hard, like 35-40 an hour with like 30k magic xp.  Wildy is around 40-50 but I need the marks...
---
But it's degradable
---
*Yay* *gz*
---
did you unlock boss tasks? or did she give you blue dragons in ungael? how many vorkath kills you had to do? i switched back to duradel because it bottered me that Konar doesnt assign me tasks to do bosses as i like like VOrkath or GWD...
---
Yikes

But why would anyone grind 500m at vork when they can raid? I don't know any decent max mains who bother torturing themselves with zulrah/vork, only plebs who get cleaned at duel arena weekly.

The desert is not great IRL lol. I live in Southern Arizona and it's dry and hot as hell during most of the year, then winter is here for like 2 months where it gets down to the 50's a couple times then it's hot as hell again. But we do have nice sunsets... I wish I lived in a climate where you really see all 4 seasons. 
---
1) LOL RC SLOW XD UPBOATS TO THE LEFT
---
2) It's even worse when you realize that the 2009 is from what would eventually become RS3, so the difference in level is actually 39 because everyone had to start over fresh in OSRS.

You‚Äôre clearly insane.

The thing is, there are many different ways that things can have a use. For example, compare motherlode mine to the quarry. The quarry offers way more experience per hour, but mlm is way more popular. Why? Becuase mlm is less effort, you make money, and it offers rewards like the prospector set.

Think of it like this. Remember that one time you lost your entire bank to a Pker/glitch/death/bad investment. If your bank is at literally zero, you could quit the account. But you‚Äôve already invested so much time. If you‚Äôre at that point the only way you can do is go up. I know it‚Äôs a shit analogy but maybe you can understand. Hope shut goes well for you. Sorry for your circumstances.

Blowpipe's use at brutal blacks fluctuates with the price of scales. Right now when scales are 200gp each it is absolutely not worth it. If they lower to below 150 again then a blowpipe becomes much more of a viable option at brutals. Also hawk eye is the most efficient offensive prayer as it's half the drain of eagle eye for a 10% boost over eagle eye's 15% and will add more profit per hour than the extra prayer pots you use up.

If you're going to play an uim you can't be stupid and not look at the minimap when you're risking literally everything on you.

Why are they different percentages
---

---
That flax is so nice for ironman tho.
---
haha sonic adventure 
---

---
so we gotta make seercull and all other rare ''useless'' items more useful? Fuck off, all bosses have had rare useless items.
---
Why...?
---
Isn't it from temple trekking?  not shades?
---
Look up the "Tortoise" prototype vehicle, lmao
---
Wind, water, and earth spells do lower damage
---
Where do you watch it?
---
OMG I never noticed that lmao I'm dying
---
Begun the gnome wars have
---
I think spells need a buff, not exactly the gear
---
Please. That's not so bad. Here are all of my 99 parties:
---
haha thanks, I think I'll have it down next round :)
---
I asked a mod why it was pink when it came out.  He told me it isnt pink it's just transparent and that it would work if it was red.   Idk if you ask me it's a dragon defender not a crystal defender.  
---
Crossbow for the buds, no need for range gear and you just bit them to disable them, pray gear as i personally read the wiki and it recommended it for my 2nd kill so went with it.. :)
---
Hydra should be a ranged thing, its mechanics dictate that you spend a lot of time out of melee distance. I wouldn't really mind equalizing their range/stab def, but lance doesn't have to be bis at hydra just because it comes from it.
---
Half the player base are ironmen 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you only get boss tasks if you killed the boss before, right? So the player should know where it is, and Jagex put "somewhere" as a joke.
---
exactly. Many bosses have ''useless'' rare drops. What's the problem with hydra having one? I mean hydra will always have the big-ticket Hydra's Claw and Leather, not to mention its regular zulrahlike droptable. (useless other boss items for example: bone necklace vorkath, bandos boots, steam battlestaff, seercull, d chain, etc.)

Back in 2008-9 before there actually were AUS servers I learnt how to pray flick for slayer tasks with a 250 ping delay. When AUS servers came out for OSRS I had to learn the timings for flicking again because with 30 ping I kept missing all of my flicks. It's not impossible to play with lag you just have to adapt.
---
Less brews, more restores.
---
I‚Äôm currently 600 kills in with no crystal are you telling me I need to talk to someone to get crystals

"Not everyone wanna throw 5 hours towards that at max efficiency."  5 hours is about 30 seconds in runescape time.

Do yew birdhouses have a lower chance of getting nests or something? The wiki doesn't say so but ever since I started doing yew ones I'm lucky to get 3 nests per run and they're usually empty or 1 ring nest. Should I just swap back to mahogany ones until I can do magic bird houses? 
---

---
I think he's right, but in practice it's not the case because you'll fire bolts while it's empowered and lose 1-4 ticks of damage.
---
Dhcb/ruby is about tied with rune darts, but rune darts are inefficient for everyone but post-gp pet hunters.
---
Good thing it's only around for a little while to promote the new content.

Yes, it is. Made it myself in photoshop.

I agree, but melee takes significantly more effort so I also wouldn't mind it being at least a little stronger.

This sub could be renamed to r/sunkcostfallacy
---
I agree with that
---
you sir are honestly fucking retarded lmao. You think osrs doesnt have power creep? it does. its just hidden behind fake t75s. Blowpipe? elder maul? sang staff? rapier? those can all be classed as t80-t90 extremely easily. but to keep the kiddies happy, jagex put their reqs at lvl 75. if you think a tbow is really only lvl 75, youre absolutely the stupidest player in the game.
---
Fish have spines too yes
---
Nice job, im at 1735 right now working towards it :) 
---
That‚Äôs fucking amazing haha 
---
You better vote no boys
---
well you should be using blowpipe but since most people don't kill jad on their first time i guess its best not to waste all that money.
---
Fair enough. I just want the lance itself to get a buff so it can compete with the dhcb in general, losing when the distance advantage is worth the ammo cost and winning when it isn't.
---
But isn't that only on task?
---
r/whoosh
---
If you want the value to go up then start rounding up a few hundred sets and remove them from the game.
---
Yes you do. It errors out
---
Gonna guess its track 9 and titled I Love Kanye. Was I right? Definitely didn't look it up
---
Reddit isn't an echo chamber LMAO
---
Elder maul...really?  
---
definitely a good idea to make it a crush weapon with the lack of 1H crush weapons in the game
---
I see prezleek, I upvote
---
No, this was more or less due to him using gold trade websites.  Throughout the rest of the convo it was pretty clear as he wasn‚Äôt too sure of many money making methods.  He kinda hinted to it later on, but I figured this screen cap would demonstrate that.  Guess not though.  Oh well, lesson learned for me, don‚Äôt be an asshole, even by accident XD
---
Mlm isn't powercreep though.  It's a tradeoff between time and effort.  I think these sorts of changes are healthy additions, but if you asked someone who capped mining pre mlm they'd probably say otherwise.  Mlm isn't more "powerful" than granite.  Though it's probably more powerful than hopping for runite.  This sort of suggestion is just a flat out buff.  
---
Powercreep is a toughie in osrs.  It should happen at the max level.  But maxing takes so fucking long that players will want to get there faster so they can enjoy that content.  Absolute tangent, but max players in this game really don't have much to do.  Pets, clues, completionist stuff.  If creep happens it should happen there.  But everyone would scream about content being released to a small portion of the community.
---
I used to stand upstairs in lumbridge on random worlds waiting for someone to buy law runes for 1-5k. I usually didn't advertise it cause sometimes you'd see someone buy one for 10k just to get it instantly.

Actually while we‚Äôre here, has identical stats to chaotic rapier, but with less strength or something like that for balancing so I‚Äôm not sure about that one

Oh no! Jagex gave someone that actively promotes their game free membership?!? The absolute horror! how will i survive
---
In 2009 I was around 50 now in 2019 its 10...
---
Nice
---
I think this is more of a novel idea than something that should actually be added. Not everything in game needs special set effects, especially something as important and common as mystic. Maybe if this was added to splitbark, or some of the other very underused med-level mage sets but mystic is already very widely used and dominates that niche. To make it even stronger makes no realistic sense.
---
elder mauls the chaotic maul. just reskinned
---
Same thing 
---
It‚Äôs biologically impossible for you not to have a mom fam 
---
Staff of air has a 100% chance of saving runes.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if it the scimitar, boots fury or torso that was the achievement. Shit maybe it‚Äôs the cape 
---
This smells lonely 
---
Lance and dex if you dont have those.  Bin void, use dhide torso ahrims 
---
Chaotic maul was +167 crush, +155 str vs. elder maul 120 and 147 str huge difference 
---
Dex?
---
*pssssst* I'm mahleeeeeg now
---
In case you did not understand, I'm happy of finally achieving top t60 gear from back in the day. This is the same acc of my char in RS3 who is still below lv 60 in all combat lvls.
---
Use them for runecrafting
---
Ups someone got triggered

Also when tf does this chick keep rowing me out to see their god when I‚Äôve killed him 1200 times

It's all of that together, actually hahaha

Wow there‚Äôs a lot to unpack on this one 
---
Use the Event RPG. The tench wouldn't have been anything new. Event RPG is 3 tick attack with 0 stats.

It‚Äôs important that runescape remains medieval.

Yes, engaging in PvP with somebody who enters the one PvP area in the entire game makes you scum..

You‚Äôre retarded. 
---
I'm in the Stronghold of Security killing Fresh Crawlers-- don't laugh, they pay off big in rare herbs :-}}
---
Agreed, its an attempt to fix a useless item by creating a unnecessary item that seems like a forced upgrade. Whip doesn't need 3 different variants. 
---
yeah theres a fuckin difference. but elder maul is still the strongest crush wep in game. theres power creep, whether u believe it or not.
---
Nothing official yet. I would assume it‚Äôs between 1/1000 - 1/5000.
---
Damn, no wonder those seeds skyrocketed in price. On the other hand, torstol seeds and some other seeds have plummeted in price. Very erratic changes in the seed price market atm

Punch em in the nuts

The game is still fairly balanced

Don't lie, you got that stupid cape but banked it. Pulling fake card.

What? This is incredibly dumb and flawed logic.
---
Literally the only place its on par with a weapon that costs way more than it is on Olm.
---
Literally one encounter. One.
---
And that much more expensive weapon is literally better on 99% of all other encounters/mobs in the entire game
---
Its a niche weapon, if it isnt at least top 2 on bosses/mob in its niche then its underwhelming. It also requires you to have another weapons spec to make it competitive with the top options for that boss (BGS/DWH spec). DHCB does not require that same spec, and yet still out dps' it and has the big advantage of being ranged. BP is still better than it on Hydra no matter if you hve BGS spec, and Vork its basically on par with BP (as long as youre BGS speccing of course, BP is better if you arent). Not even viable for Brutals. DHCB is much better at KBD just as it is on basically most everything.
---
Why dont you try actually thinking before making such lazy dumbass posts

Oh ok! I have rigour already and I plan on getting augury in the next few days. I guess I could get a lance!

My high level thinking Gender Studies class at the local state university says otherwise. Checkmate.

---
Refute my point rather than saying namds because in my opinion you‚Äôre a raging jagaloon who probably identifies as genderfluid and sucks dick on saturdays while having a girl avatar on RuneScape, but you don‚Äôt see me being that guy calling you names 
---
That‚Äôs still a dick way to do slayer if you‚Äôre just killing the stack, hopping and repeating. 
---
But you'd have to code the default text...
---
Can't unsee.
---
Not sure if you'll see this, but an idea for the spec. Have it randomly choose one of the Alchemical Hydra special attacks. So 33% chance of each one. i.e. spawn a small pool of poison under the mob that ticks for some poison damage and maybe leaves it poisoned. Spawn electricity directly on it that does some magic damage similar to sara sword spec, and snares it for a short period. And set it on fire dealing 1 bigger hit and then a series of smaller hits. Obviously it can all be balanced, and not take numbers and durations directly from Alchemical Hydra, but I think it would be a fun spec.

---
Shoot I have this too. I gotta check if it's fixed, thanks.
---
imo, those banking/pouching clicks are the main thing that separates rc from agility. A lot of the flavor of the skill comes from doing a quick series of fast clicks, then having your character run to Point B so you can do the next series of clicks. It feels pretty satisfying to get the process down in muscle memory, and watching your rates improve as you get better at it.
---
I'd certainly be down for introducing lower-apm methods that are separate from "run essence pouches to altar", but i feel like click-intensive banking is what makes the skill enjoyable for me in the first place.
---
blessed d'hide boots instead of dragon, also bring an accumulator and explorer's ring for +1 pray

for real though just get a blowpipe. you're making life harder for literally no reason. they're cheap as fuck.

Yesss!! Even if it were identical to the abyssal whip with a Strength option would be amazing. It just feels so satisfying to attack with a whip.

Did you attach the blow pipe to a air compressor? If you just equip it and use it you get about half the damage.

We hiked up about 1500 feet for that! About a 45 minute hike to get up there.

What is your ranged level it‚Äôs all about kills per hour
---
Agility sucks but has twice the exp rate unless you‚Äôre tick-perfecting Lavas.
---
Pipe at bbds offtask cuts into profit heavily but you should still make okay gp... using dhide, eagle eye, addy darts, repot range whenever your max hit drops
---
Not gonna lie I was thinking of making a post like this, but more of an overhaul and less QoL angle. But I'll talk more about your QoL here.
---
 ***
---
- **Vespula**
---
Honestly the big issue is how the grubs can spawn before you enter the room. Fopr a specific solution I'd say make it so the grubs don't start hatching until something in the room is interacted with, vesupla getting hit or hitting someone, the portal getting hit, flowers being picked, etc. So that even if the room is triggered early, the grubs don't start hatching until its important.
---
- **Vanguards**
---
In my opinion, the lower health is fine because you can account for your max hit and simply not use the twisted bow unless the mage vanguard is by far the highest, or removing strength gear when attacking with melee. 
---
What I would like to be seen done is slightly reduce their aggro range so you can consistently melee a particular vanguard spot without aggroing others.  Currently its dependent on what spot, what room variation, and how that room is rotated.
---
- **Ice Demon**
---
There's 2 major problems with this boss, the amount of time it takes to complete the room, and how it effectively requires a chest. I say we could simply shorten the length of the room by decreasing the amount of logs needed by ~33% and reducing the damage resistance the ice demon has by a bit as well. To solve the chest issue, i say you should be able to load kindling into the braizer before lighting, or fix the issue with adding kindling after the fact. As it stands adding 2 sets of 8 kindling is significantly less effective than 1 set of 16. This is why you either need 2x23(46 logs) 3x18(54 logs) or 4x16(64 logs) to do ice demon in a solo.
---
- **Thieving**
---
This is a room that's fairly straightforward to fix, since its fine in even duos. Allow it to scale downward much better, and maybe even double the points you get for it. Currently in a solo you need to collect 30 grubs for 600 points, and in a duo you need to collect... 30 grubs for 600 points. I say we cut down the grubs needed in solo to 20, and double the points earned per grub. 20 grubs for 800 points is a lot more bearable than 30 for 600.
---
- **Skeletal mystics**
---
I agree, but did you know you can stand under the mystics to get them to path out of the wall, allowing them to path correctly again?
---
- **Olm**
---
As far as I'm aware when doing 4:1, if you miss all your attacks between running from middle safespot to when he is about to do his "nothing" attack, he will turn his head towards the middle because he prefers having his head be in the middle when there is no damage going on and there is no preference from where people are. He prioritizes his head based on what position lets him see the most people, then towards the direction that is receiving the most damage (why he turns his head all the way towards his mage claw when doing the mage method), then finally prefers facing forward if there's nothing to determine his head direction otherwise.
---
Agree on scuffed olm.
---
I'd personally like the delay on the teleport to be lengthened slightly in solos, because its currently very difficult to reach your target quick enough, and if you mess up and get trapped in a fire wall, you can also have a teleport be timed at the exact same time to potentially stack you for more than 100hp in 1 or 2 game ticks worst case.
---
Sounds fun.
---
Horrible idea I'm sorry I don't mean to sound like I'm hating 
---
I presume you've turned authenticator off... big mistake my friend. You're fucked. Change your password and everything. 
---
I made this mistake once. Had 99 pray banked and like 200m extra stuff. Cleaned within 3 days of turning it off. Never turn that shit off. 
---
whoa that's like 0 mega joules of power ü§§
---
We had fun together the time has passed since he desapeared from the game. But yeah I miss him from the old days we had lots of fun but that time has passed. :) 
---
I like rc
---
Didn‚Äôt know if I was on this sub or r/frenworld
---
if you dont use the runelite or osbuddy cannon plugins which show you the double hit zones it takes a bit of practice.
---
the double hit spots are the tiles surrounding the cannon, extending two tiles from each corner. the suth west tile of the monster needs to be on one of these double hit lines.
---
when done right, it adds about 10 to 15 damage every 4 ticks on average, which is definitely noticeable and worth the cost.
---
Why does it sound bad?
---
:(
---
Oh no
---
Almost definitely. I'm 99 fishing, thieving, agility, and 97 woodcutting without the pets. Getting the pet before 99 is actually very lucky. 
---
Fairy ring and spirit tree (separate, you need 95 for the combined version). 
---
I mean technically he doesn‚Äôt die, he‚Äôs just wounded, like Vorkath.
---
You beat reddit gj
---
It's the little things.
---
Pretty sure its set at a 1/200 rate, so it should be every 1-3 tasks (depends on what task).
---
Here's some hot concept art I just cooked up. https://i.imgur.com/C2Ejclc.png
---
That is what I meant by technically. A Rapier is 1 in 100 while the Hydra Tail is 1 in 500 or 1 in 1000; I've heard both. So technically it is a lower rate, but like I said, "it takes longer to get and fewer players are doing ToB". But if you really want to compare them, the Hydra may be a 2 min boss, but you can't grind it like ToB since you need to get a task. Probably still quicker to get, but it does slow down the rate they come in from just 1 in 16/32 Hours. Anyway, I am not saying it is as rare as the rapier but it could be a decently rare item if the demand was high.
---
Why do you say cool whip like that?
---
Gl homie
---
Considering it's the entire purpose of this "meme", I think it's fair to nitpick it haha. And yeah the person above me is right, the 2009 version was entirely different, didn't even resemble what the picture shows (rather than slightly different like OSRS is today).
---
YES
---
Yeah but it's still annoying
---
Let Zulrah grind 99 runecrafting and he'll start sacrificing himself
---
Same dude. Went from 70 str to 90 str and 50 fishing and cooking to nearly 80 in two months just farming rune meds after school for an hour or two back in the day. Loved every second of it. 
---
Have you seen the posts that've been made of 3b hackings?
---
I admit you have a point, but I absolutely hate shortcuts when I don‚Äôt have the agility level and it‚Äôs so far out of reach.
---
World 330 should have a host, theres also a cc called 07 altar or something similar
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of bis. Is that not everyone has the best items. It‚Äôs something to work towards. Not something easy and cheap
---
You're the best. Add me I will pay you for your information. Lord noir
---
It's the idea that you can train magic without any thought. Believe it or not; when OSRS was released (Back in ~ 2004) AFKing was against the rules and you could get banned for it.
---
So you can probably see why that when people train legitimately through bursting and/or alching etc, it annoys people that have spent time training it vs someone who's moving a mouse once every 20 minutes to train it.
---
First suggestion I agree to in this subreddit.
---
The reason it‚Äôd  make certain builds insane is because pures and zerkers would be able to use it without gaining att levels 
---
Nice! Keep us posted!

blowpipe is a million times easier imo.
---
That's pretty shitty to lose that much progress ouch! Also look at all these absolutely dickhurt pvmers and stream lurkers talking shit. It's the wilderness, he chose to not have a stream delay, and he knew the risks. If you could scout a huge kill and know you could get away with it why wouldn't you unless you're not about that action

Shut up, Kevin.

Yeah but 200 k Xp per hr vs 13k it‚Äôs not really comparable even arching is 55 to 60k.

Just make it so you can only do it when you're not in combat so you have to wait for someone else to attack the dragon or wait for them to stop being aggressive.  
---
"Osrs Lads Cc" no reqs dont give a fuq what you say or do, got a discord as well pm me if interested

But they taste absolutely rancid. I don‚Äôt drink my mixies straight

Tbh I‚Äôd get to 50 firemaking and check out wintertodt it‚Äôs a lot of fun
---
I think I have to disagree. 
---
Once something hits a poll booth it should have gone through a decent amount of back and forth on whether the community wants it / desires changes etc.
---
Anything being offered in a poll should be a finished product that is a result of a decent amount of consultation, because if we vote yes for it Jagex can't be doing takebacksies without a massive amount of backlash - even if it ended up being a bad change for the integrity of the game. 
---
Try different skills, see what you like!

If you want something to work toward, start question to do Dragon Slayer.

Do we have a PvP f2p world?

So you sat there and fucked with him until he lost his cool and said something stupid (which ill admit is a horrible thing to say) but then you reported him? Christ you must be bored lol

Thanks :)
---
If you cant afford to do regular trees then dont. Just do your fruit trees and special trees, throw in herb runs and allotments if you want
---
Ayyy I recently started rewatching DBZ while I scape. 
---
Both of those have significant downsides (degradable and extremely rare/pricey). Whip still is the staple weapon of the game. Buffing it is power creep.
---
Not being a cunt but, prob shit rewards for him I assume since his lvls not that great. But whatever he wants.
---
i feel like you could swap the stab and slash options and would be fine i guess
---
Farming contracts in the farming guide are incredibly OP rn for tree seeds, I'd suggest a look at them. You will get less rewards not having the harder one unlock though. 
---
&gt; Is there a better way to acquire these seeds? Is there a monster that drops them, for instance?
---
Really, for getting the money together for skills you should be doing the best / most efficient money makers available and then buying all your skilling supplies.
---
Specifically going out to grind out maple seeds yourself isn't efficient. 
---
If you do really want to do it, I'd recommend setting your kingdom up to get birds nests and grind out the giant mole pet. You'll get tonnes of birds nests from that. 
---
Try to train those lower lvls get a base 50 for example...
---
Now THATS A ROLFCOPTER MOMENT
---
How do teens acquire drugs 
---
Not defending him, but you're also a shithead here, idk why you posted this.
---
I like that a lot more than a new tier in of itself. That extra 3 str levels and the ability to train strength with it would be sick. Only downside would probably be a drop in the Abby dagger's price since most people use it for strength training already. The whip already has the better stats and melee str so people will use it over the dagger. The only thing the dagger would have over the whip is stab bonuses. It'd still be a slightly cheaper alternative over hasta or Lance for dragon killing and such.
---
Ugh but hunter and farming are so boring... I'll never be able to get those up tbh :( 
---
And why do you think that?
---
&gt; on whether the community wants it / desires changes etc.
---
this is exactly the point i was making. reddit does not dictate what the community wants. r/2007scape does not speak for everyone that plays. the only way to know if it's what the community wants is to let the entire community vote on it.
---
comment and upvote + thanks

Same.. flying Jetblue next tine
---
Could you please teach me how to do this?
---
Lmao! It was late last night and I was trying to avoid my farm run.. it was priceless, I actually hopped and a level 3 really got mad lol dogs left her with 1 hp. Then I found some high level auto clicking smh ignored the dogs, char kept turning to the stalls and eventually died.
---
Psa I was super bored.. I had fun doing this. Dont judge

Unsafe activity? No thanks, I'm a pussy.

/u/adam1210 Is there a way to make info boxes to wrap left instead of right? If there isn't, could this feature be added please? :)

I don‚Äôt understand how people do farm runs off Lunas.
---
bro i expected to go 25k dry at shamans because my luck everywhere else but it continues to be FUCKING RETARDED
---
I still do :(
---
Is it that much better than the xbow? I used Karils for my firecape to not worry about the weapon swap for long range and it worked fine. Bolt racks arnt too expensive either. 
---
I really like this idea. Would be cool making it look more flail-y.
---
Does he have any way of repairing barrows? He would have to use the equipment sparingly.
---
I hate when people think like this. "Oh, if they just do this one change it'll ruin everything!", that's why you do two changes. 
---
One to remove runecrafting and one to make bloodvelds drop 10 of every rune every kill.
---
Honestly a good idea, support.
---
It's all of the above plus from doing farming contacts
---
original dragon ball is the best of them all, and i've watched every single DB series multiple times. It gives me so much nostalgia of staying up late watching it and playing runescape on the side. 
---
Replace that bottle of wine with a bottle of bourbon, and I could swear that's my desk ;)
---
Kinda fills the same niche as hasta, but it's a good idea. Definitely much better than just a "forced" whip upgrade
---
Its safer than slayer or anything combat related 
---
they did
---
For half the exp/hr
---
What are efficient money-making methods?
---
I have 50 ranged, 45 melee combat stats, and the rest of my skills are sub-par.
---
The seercull being useless isn't a good part of the game and hopefully some day is useful somewhere. Yeah bosses should have shit drops like the rune sword at bandos and things like that, but if a unique item is useless it's bad game design, and a waste of team resources. Make the shit drops not unique items how bout

What you see now is my normal state.
---
So there's a chance of getting one when checking the health of a fruit tree **and** when picking some fruit from it?
---
Yeah that'd be too much of a change; people might actually like RC after that update.
---
Yo, thanks for the tip! The deposit box is new to me since I haven't played in like 12 years so I appreciate you pointing it out.
---
If it has a check health option, you can get it from that. If you can only harvest, you have a chance to get one at the end of the harvest. They also come from seed boxes for completing contracts.

Don‚Äôt you guys have DriveCam?

I heard negative things about soup's guides. But why?

This I can get behind. I'm voting no for another whip, but I'll 100% vote yes to a crush weapon. 
---
I personally don't like the design so I would like maybe Konar to sell a Flail head that you have to attach to the spine. Maybe have a design closer to the one we saw in ToB.

I spent 50 hours fishing to get a 3m reward from a master clue once. At the time, didn't feel like worth it, but even if I don't fish at all, it just made my life easier from time to time

And that number is dwarfed by the people who don't, fact.

If it'd help improve the chances of the bone whip passing a poll (because I really think the design looks fantastic), what if instead of a slight improvement over the abyssal whip, it were instead a weapon with similar stats to the regular whip, but only trained crush, and had crush attack bonuses rather than slash? This would incentivize people to own both the abyssal whip AND the new bone whip, and would keep the iconic abyssal whip still very present throughout the game

For real, looking at this made my kidneys hurt. I suffer from em, mostly due to drinking these when I was around 16. I still drink them occasionally but not like that.

Personally I have it at 1k because there's alot of shit that's not worth anything that has a high price on the GE for some reason.

What drop table devalues runecrafting? No iron is like ‚Äúshit, almost out of laws better go runecraft some.‚Äù Irons get their runes from drops and buying out the stock in magic stores littered around the game. If they‚Äôre weren‚Äôt tons of worlds with 4 shops that come to mind that stock 250 of all the commonly used runes then yeah, pvm drops devalue rc, but it hasn‚Äôt been necessary for a long time.
---
Only runes that aren‚Äôt in stock that are needed are cosmics. And now that theres giant seaweed and other crafting methods, irons don‚Äôt need thousands of cosmics anymore. All the rune drops do is prevent them from having to go to the store mindlessly world hopping and buying out the stock. Super engaging content we‚Äôre missing out on.

My apologies son of dads

if spammy advertising bots weren't a problem, this would be the best way - keep your private on and anybody that pm's you earns their spot back on your friends list.

Lol

You can eat and drink a pot in the same tick. You can even eat 1 thing, eat a combo food (Karambwan, for example), then drink in the same tick.

Drinking potions won't interrupt your attacks though, unlike eating.

Lol yeah, or he's flipping for profit which is clever and funny

Not necessarily, it's possible OP never played before bonds were introduced and bought their first bond as F2P.
---
OP's suggestion is that when using elemental spells with the specific set(ex. The dark mystic set and using fire bolt) there will be a 10% chance of you saving the fire/air/chaos runes you would have used to cast the spell. Do you see now how it's different than the staves or are you the one that needs a class on critical thinking? 
---
Learn to screenshot
---
That's such a nice drop regardless! Congratulations! No sarcasm 
---
Money please
---
How many times can we just have a drop attach to a pre existing item to make a new item? Magic fang + sotd/trident, eternal/pegasian/prim boots, tentacle whip, the list goes on. I just think its lazy and instead of coming up with something new, lets just upgrade something old again^again^^again

Taken from the gear discord:
---
&gt;How to load your house in 2 ticks:
---
- Make sure your house only has one floor, delete your dungeon/upper floor. 
---
- Your layout should be 4x4, with 16 total rooms. 
---
- You will also need to place your house portal in the same position as shown on the picture (the 6th tile of the 4x4 PoH area). 
---
- Make sure every room in the 4x4 is in the exact layout that you prefer, BEFORE you start moving it around
---
- Your goal is to get the least amount of green around your house (shown in 3rd party client minimaps) as shown in this picture: [https://imgur.com/3VkfkWN](https://imgur.com/3VkfkWN)
---
- You will have to find exactly where to put the house on your own, since it depends on how your house is currently setup, simply placing it in the middle won‚Äôt work. A hint however would be to move the whole house southwest in most cases, as that seems to work. 
---
Tfw I actually just moved back into moms basement 
---
/u/jagexgambit please consider this. Upgraded whip will probably fail the poll and if it doesn't it'll change the meta so much. Improve the stats of the necklace instead so that it'll be worth using e.g. on certain slayer tasks.
---
I am a dork able
---
I have pegasians and an acb and I get pumped whenever I see something 10k+ pop up
---
With magic is it better to counter the element monster you‚Äôre fighting, or just use the highest spell you can?
---
For example: Pyrefiends - water blast because water &gt;fire or fire blast bc its the highest level?
---
How do you know it‚Äôs the old wiki? New wiki has the same color scheme as this one and it looks like the new wiki. Am I missing something that really distinguishes it?

The best one was the guy who said he just randomly shot all over the carpet of his room. He said he tried to launch them as far as he could. One day one of his cats gets sick and pees on a carpet. They get the cat treated. Parents get concerned cat may have peed across the house so they get a black light. Kid goes on 2 week trip. Comes back home. Mom went through his room with the black light and found dozens of blacklit spots in his room. They had the cat put down thinking it was sick again and peeing everywhere. His artillery jizz damage to his carpet got his cat murdered.

Yes, I think everyone is aware that an animal had to die for you to eat meat, I don't think anyone thinks otherwise. But let's be honest. If a cow or a chicken had to die for me to have a delicious meal, it's 100% worth it.

The game shouldn't be balanced around deliberate autism.
---
There's no generic elemental counters (some monsters have them programmed in on a case by case basis but it's not worth worrying about) so just use the highest damage spell you can, usually something like your strongest Fire Spell, Iban's Blast, etc.
---
You need 84 construction for the fully upgraded nexus if you didn't know (although the room is a lower level to build, just the nexus itself requires 92 con which can be boosted from 84).

Although this is just a small note, I thought I'd say it anyway, I believe the underground mine has a deposit box rather than a bank chest.

Great now its gonna cost more LOL. Honestly though I didnt know about this until my friend told me about this 2 weeks ago. Kinda crazy that it isnt that well known.
---
That was true a few years back but jagex have made updates catering hugely to Ironmen since that was said; giant seaweed, bucket packs, snapegrasa farming, birdhouses to an extent, just off the top of my head. Even myth guild has a better location for picking up blue dragon scales.  
---
They do currently consider Ironmen for new content so I don't see why the drop table should be any different
---
Woof 
---
as a finn this is unacceptable.

Lava runecrafting. Put on a sick music album or podcast to distract yourself. Another thing that helped me on the way to getting 99 rc, was to do sessions where I would try pb either the xp/hr or the duration I was doing rc for.

Wrist support. Two birds one stone amirite?
---
Okay, just let me go ddos my friends for their tbows. 
---
I'm in the same boat. What I did was looked at certain benefits that would help me in the long run, this includes things like Enlightened Journey for hot air balloons, the My Arm quest series for 2 disease free herb patches for easy money, One Small Favour for 2 10k xp lamps, Kingdom of Misc for long term money, etc.
---
Then I would do quests that give you xp on skills that aren't as fun to train such as Agility and RC. Either that or you can go for the quests that give the most QP.

If they make prayer actually drain, and let you charge bonecrusher with something else than ecto tokens, then you have a nice item.

Are Ancient Magicks viable in any way for the caves? I‚Äôm 69 range and thinking of working on that to do caves but I‚Äôm 80 magic and surely blood spells to heal and ice spells to kill, maybe even smoke to poison.

Expensive as fuck for sure. However is it viable?

It's kind of stupid that the 95 Slayer Monsters drop an item that is basically only used by people that are too broke for ppots.

I'm definitely for either buffing the tail, or make it easier to get. This ain't it tho.

Rune darts are abour 250gp/shot. Addy are about 165gp/shot. That's a trivial difference given the profitability of Hydra lol.

they are both basically just passive skills to a certain extent if you start doing birdhouses. I got 65 hunter in the last few weeks from 9 just doing birdhouses

I usually drink beer or whiskey, wine is a rare choice, but tonight was that night

id say it should be slightly worse with dragon defender and on par with avernic, that would be a fine balance imo.
---
not sure how common the tail is though, because if the price is gonna settle below 10m it would crash bludgeon hard.
---
Contracts are good, cuz you just plant random shit that gives xp and you get some reward for doing it. Maybe not good for mains, but very nice for ironmen because of the seeds. Hespori boss is also very nice xp and the bottomless bucket is incredible if you do herb runs. Other than that, it basically just has more patches where you plant shit for xp.
---
100%! And if you are the YT jakeysoaurus, even more so haha!

Good god runes are cheap as fuck just fucking pay for them.

That'd indeed be macroing as it would involve 2 actions in one button press. Moving and clicking the mouse.

Very unnecessary, hydra already had enough good uniques without adding a straight upgrade to the most used weapon in the game

Besides the proposed model looks ugly

Konar is not supposed to be an outlet for people who doesn't want to gather skilling supplies the way it was intended to be. I'm reliefed jagex made this changes, it's better for the health of the game instead of giving slayer way too much diversity loot.

6 prims by kc 500, all my luck was used up

Oh , I see. The +6 boost works only with things that require saw to build 
---
&gt; Did any of this change? I want to play again but feel like i will just have to join the PvM playstyle to be able to enjoy myself.
---
If you enjoy skilling and consider yourself a skiller why do you need to compare yourself to pvmers?
---
You will make enough money from profitable skilling methods (gem mining, $ runecrafting, chin) to 99 to pay off most of your buyables.
---
Skillers don't need the expensive shit that PVMers need to be efficient and have fun.

And no, it hasn't changed. PVM is still king for money making.

This is the old wiki 100%. They absolutely do not look the same. Not even close.
---
Did you make Teak Shelves 2? If you did, the saw should have given you +3 and the tea another +3, totaling +6, and allowing you to build anything at lvl 91 or below, which would include the Ornate Jewellery box, as well as the Ornate Rejuvenation Pool, which is what you inquired about.
---
Or you are just bad.
---
Just relax and read the information, listen to the video, whatever. You're clearly rushing through the quest and messing up over and over, just relax and think about it. Also, you need to try to identify why you are making all these mistakes. Are you not comprehending the video well enough? Watch it a few times or also use a text guide. Are you not remembering what to bring? Write everything down on paper so you don't forget. Are you trying to go too fast? Slow down and make sure you know what you're doing.
---
One thing that helps me is using both a video and the wiki. I'll watch a video section and then check the wiki for that part. That way I always know what I need to bring in case one of them was wrong or forgot to mention an item I needed.
---
If you're already 85, just use a crystal saw + a cup of tea made in your house for a total of +6. Easier than getting the spice / stewing. Check wiki for making the cup of tea.

alright, so after 1 name change the old name is still reserved? thanks for the info!

Skilling is greatly inferior to PvM, sadly that's the reality. PvM should yield more gp/h but as it is right now skilling only have 2-3 okay methods for gp where as 95% of the skilling grind is litteraly 0-100k gp/h even though a lot of it is high effort.. #slayerscape
---
Yes m8, I got pool. Many thanks. But you can‚Äôt get the jewelry box or the altar with that boost since you don‚Äôt use crystal saw for building them ;(
---
I believe its second best to the twisted bow when it has enough health for rubies to hit 100s, although ddarts bp is very close and it doesn't work well in practice. 
---
Ancient staff isn't really great lol.
---
If you saw what I put I said balance the stats as necessary to make sure it‚Äôs not better than bludgeom
---
The problem with magic is that you hitting anything is 70% calculated off of the enemies magic level, not defense. This means that in most cases it‚Äôs better to bring defensive gear because your magical accuracy is mostly out of your control. The obvious exception is ancestral because % damage boost but yeah 142M
---
Did I miss the bronze chainbody meme?
---
to be fair i hate farm runs and farming was my lowest skill. never do herb runs or tree runs
---
Oof that stings.
---
To add onto this, it also gives a low magic exp/point damaged ratio iirc
---
Just normal I guess
---
Amen to that comment. I totally agree, efficiency somewhat kills the fun for me. I like to explore, take my time, try new methods. Someday I skill, other I pvm or do quests. When I think about it, that's is what I like about this game is the enormous amounts of possibilities, activities and all the different approaches you can take. 
---
and the weird fact that only osrs is the one that has packet loss as of now as I've checked it in the cmd prompt. I have no idea why. 
---
well done :o
---
This needs more attention. 
---
You can't die. You know what to do.
---
Yes! The current one is way to big i like yours alot i would be up for this being added! Im no big fan of all the other colors though :P
---
When my gall bladder got taken out i was able to do all the questing and lots of training for my zerk. Hope your time is made a little better from the gains. Good luck bro
---
Should probably bring them incase something like this happens in the future. Also wouldnt ring of life prevent dying in wt most of the time? 
---
I‚Äôve been planting them when I can and killing the boss, doing tree runs daily, and I have about 5 more sitting in the bank. So about the same as you. 
---
TIL it's not use of macro if you don't use it a lot lmfao.
---
Ye you wouldn't get banned for it, but it's still macroing.
---
Also, takes 5 seconds to make it ahk, just do it lol
---
Vote no for forced whip upgrade and bamboozle everybody
---
you ever done wintertodt?
---
This post is just totally wrong. First of all, why are you comparing their dps at fucking green dragons, red dragons, brutal green/reds, wyrms, drakes, etc. All of those are totally dead content and don't matter.
---
Despite it not mattering, I *still* ran a dps check for every single mob you listed and what a surprise:
---
|Monster|Dragon Hunter Lance DPS|Dragon Hunter Crossbow DPS|
---
:--|:--|:--|
---
|Green Dragon(79)|10.54|9.13|
---
|Blue Dragon|9.60|8.72|
---
|Red Dragon|8.91|8.40|
---
|Black Dragon|7.52|7.78|
---
|Brutal Green Dragon|8.15|8.06|
---
|Brutal Blue Dragon|7.56|7.80|
---
|Brutal Red Dragon|7.55|7.80|
---
|Brutal Black Dragon|6.36|7.30|
---
|Wyrm|8.66|6.86|

|Drake|7.37|5.80|
---
|Hydra|6.10|6.90|
---
|Alchemical Hydra|10.93|10.06|
---
|Rune Dragon|7.53|6.03|
---
Of the places where DHCB is better, it's beaten at black dragons and hydra SIGNIFICANTLY by BP, brutal blues, reds, and blacks SIGNIFICANTLY by tbow. Which leaves us with DHCB being the BiS weapon at the following places:
---
&gt;!Vorkath............................................................................!&lt;
---
Meanwhile the lance is BiS at:
---
&gt;!Rune dragons, solo CoX vasa raids.......................................!&lt;
---
They are VERY similar in terms of usefulness. I don't know why you made up some random facts about DHCB being amazing at so many places (many of which it's beaten by the blowpipe or the lance itself).
---
 You're calling a bot an idiot fyi
---
WOAH. Date me.
---
Ruined his acc with the 20 magic :^)
---
That rng holy shit. Gz dude.
---
Kc?
---
Think about it in this way, the master clue was a side product, you got a lot of useful stuff done in the meanwhile such as quests and high crafting level, there is no such thing as wasted effort when leveling up stats for clues
---
chainmace is bis 60 that has crush, around 11m atm. no quest requirements. pretty good for afking crabs tbh
---
yeah I think that's for the best now, I'll probably just have my teleport in my offhand incase this happens again.
---
so the main thing that i'm going for that (I think) would be effective and efficient for me is to do wintertodt until I get a bruma torch so I can get myself a light source for "The Lost Tribe" Quest which is the first ring of life I will ever get.
---
so yeah. it's just weird that only this game is lagging as of now.
---
Top priority

---
Yeah. The variations were mainly just for fun. I don't want/expect them to be used but I really hope they slim the Bone Whip like I showed. 
---
Food pot karabwam
---
Depends what you call shitty small projects, one of the games I work on had a ~1 million owner count according to steamspy, I doubt that's very accurate, but I still think it'll easily hit 100-200k total players
---
bludgeon would still be bis strength training, and as i said in the second paragraph, it would crash bludgeon hard IF the price is low.
---
if the price is pretty high and bludgeon is still better if you don't have avernic or for strength training, i don't see the issue.

Get runelite

Would you recommend to use osbuddy or runelite? Back from a long break and everyone seems to use runelite.
---
If they were to add the bone whip (which doesn‚Äôt REALLY need to be in the game). I‚Äôd want it to look like the half tail half bone whip. That looks fucking sick cunt
---
its not afk at all, the money is like 300k/h so with 2 alts 600k/h those who claim they earn more are liers cuz i have 99 fishing on both alts, if you afk you make shit money so its not worth it to afk, its better to have volcanic ash alts or teletabs alts than minnows.

Literally my comment on another post

Tl:dw u should tell us why the lance is so good instead of upgrades with it

Haha, semon.

Well I don't pk 
---
That should be mine
---
I was about to damage him with range and then use the sword for the last hits.
---
Bp is only better if you‚Äôre using the same tier arrow/dart. If he‚Äôs using addy darts, tbow w/ rune arrows would be more dps. If he wants to out dps tbow, he needs to use d darts.
---
You can get the warrior / rainbow boots at the bottom of stronghold of security, BiS boots for F2P. Just bring some food and sprint through rooms, you should be fine.
---
Yes, you need to hit the semon with silver light
---
I'm in the United Arab Emirates. 
---
You tryin to get them to nerf zulrah again?
---
This exactly, if you‚Äôre already making lots of money every drop more people are going to farm a boss, thus creating more supply of the uniques. 
---
It also means that the bulk of your gp per hour will come from regular drops and the uniques would simply be a nice added bonus. If they were actual bulk of the gp per hour which would make them hold more value.
---
Just compare bosses like Cerberus and GWD to Zulrah and you can see clearly how this works. 
---
Elemental tunes are 5gp each. As a member you can get dual-element tunes for 2gp each. I‚Äôm not referring to other tunes, just the ones that would be saved by these robes.
---
I don't remember asking for your opinion
---
It‚Äôs 1/64 so you‚Äôre still under the drop rate. Honestly unless you have the hard mory diary done it‚Äôs hardly worth it imo unless you‚Äôre a BTW. When the pieces were 3+m a piece then yeah. Fuck going on a drystreak just to get some torag hammers.

Sounds like he's having an orgasm.

Bet if i pay 4 runners to run essence for me cause im lazy i can try and get karma on reddit.

You killed him on the same tick and since it's PVE it works in your favour I guess
---
fuck
---
He‚Äôs using addy darts though.
---
Well yes, but the other post said tbow would be max efficiency, just saying that blowpipe is better. Neither did he use venge

Because whenever someone says girlfriend there‚Äôs always someone who says ‚Äúnaa your sister‚Äù so he‚Äôs saving them the trouble of being unoriginal.

Imagine being OP
---
I'm really curious as to what the current profit per hour at Hydra is to warrant having players stand around instead of playing your content just to slow it down. Imo they should re-visit the spawn timer. If kills are happening too quickly they could always buff it's defense, or nerf the stupid bows efficiency there.
---
Hahah xD please give Syrnia some love! honestly it will help the game alot.

Outside of reddit you‚Äôll find tons of players use the regular spellbook more often than not. On Reddit people are very efficient. Even the people who say they‚Äôre casual will often still be way more efficient than your regular non-redditor.
---
Point is that if you take a look around you‚Äôll see tons of people use the regular spellbook even into high levels.
---
Yeah nothing wrong with that! Depends on your preferences, income, etc of course. Don‚Äôt Jagex make more money on bonds though? Like the cost per day of membership is higher?
---
This isn‚Äôt hard or an accomplishment at all lol, anyone with a spare 150m~ can do this.
---
Look up ‚ÄòCrafter‚Äô
---
I use it quite often honestly.  It's nice to have that prayer bonus and bury my bones all in one. Somebody needs to do the calculation for how many prayer pots it saves in the long run. It's really awesome for the new stuff, and other stuff like cannoning dagannoth where you kill them so fast it almost recharges your prayer. 
---
Just make it so when you create accounts from now on they come with 99 rc 
---
Those things aren't exclusive of one another.
---
I don't care about people who I don't have anything to do with. I have nothing to do with the Venezuelan gold-traders, or Venezuelans in general, so they could all fall dead tomorrow and I wouldn't have any reason to care about it at all.

Good people do follow the rules. These people don't follow the rules, and they are not good people because of it. There are ways to make a living respectably even in a shithole like Venezuela. 
---
Everything is black and white if you want to have solid principles. Grey areas just leave space for excuses. If you want to make disagree with the rules and make that a principle you stand for, then you may do that. However, I'd rather not die on a morally grey hill.

it took you 8 waves to figure that out? if the team is bad leave after wave 2 or 3, not 9
---
the gear setup usually consists of stuff that i currently have no hope of obtaining.
---
My method for 60-75 was using Mithril darts and Ammonite Crabs on Fossil Island. It's very budget friendly, and very AFK, you just click a few times every 10 minutes and I got about 40-50k xp an hour.
---
Alternatively you could either do the same at sand crabs, or cannon Ogres at the training camp if you  have the money. I've seen some people also do Slayer tasks from 60-75. Once you hit 75, NMZ is definitely the way to go, since you get about 80k-100k xp/hr.
---
But it is in the shield slot... and can only be used with a 1h weapon... You're just spouting nonsense at this point. Shields are in no way dead content.

How exactly is it not fair game? If you‚Äôre broadcasting the fact that you‚Äôre carrying 80m in the one PvP area in the game you‚Äôre just asking to get PKed. 
---
Yes we need more weapons Bone flail bone whips bone arrows bone mace bone bows list can go on
---
I made it leave. Reddit is safe now.
---
Good advice - getting strength up doesn‚Äôt harm anything :) and dragon weapons would help as well 
---
Why to 85 specifically?
---
I‚Äôm unsure on prayer - will cost a lot of combat levels! And expensive. But at same time, be useful for questing 
---
Nah. Right where your standing is the place to world hop for 99% of pkers. Your far better off inside the gate with access to the shortcut. 
---
I understand that; It's just what's recommended for efficiency's sake. You can always boss with a welfare setup, it just makes things more difficult. Hell, when I started killing KBD for money I wore Red d'hide and used a Rune Crossbow. The kills took longer and I used up more supplies, but I still managed to take him down.
---
they also have a 44 slayer requirement (i think) so a lot of lower level players will still be stuck going to the desert.

Try not to give up my man

You may not like it, but this is Reddits ideal account build. 
---
how is it worth 700m?
---
Bossing in runescape can be very painful without the right gear. You should start questing to finish recipe for disaster (barrows gloves). Some of the good gear is untradeable and makes your kill times faster. Am easy one to get at lower levels is the fighter torso (only takes like 4 to 5 hours to get)
---
hey look brew prices back to 2k again after the nest nerf nice
---
streaming mm2
---
I think he's talking about 2 heads on the front? Yeah, he's definitely the pickaxe from Stealing Creation minigame but that thing wasn't osrs lol
---
What's the cc?
---
It's about 610m atm.
---
Runecrafting. Try to get up to double cosmics or just go with natures. Might take a while but I reckon its your best bet here. Not much else you can do really.
---
Fastest would be chinning in mm1 or 2 caves and probly get those 15 lvl in an hour or two
---
well it took me a while but i finally got some evidence the kills arent real!
---
you can see in frameds latest vids that the people he is killing are talking to him, asking him to be in the video and giving away 3mill or 600k kills
---
hate to burst your bubble bro :P
---
why would you vote no?
---
How does it look like with eye of newts?
---
well yeah, but this way sucks. don't know about you, but if I read about an "amazing continent" with "new bosses" and "a house of farming" I'll be like 'ok, I don't farm, I already know members can do loads I can't, how is any of this news?'
---
So in short, don't like this solution.
---
thats the fucking point of the wilderness you cunt.........

If you‚Äôre computer savvy lookup RKill and do it‚Äôs process that‚Äôs my goto when a device has heen compromised. Get malwarebytes like suggested I don‚Äôt have the premium version and I love it (I also just setup a script to auto run it so who needs premium :p ).
---
Okay then, thanks for clearing that up for me.
---
Wtf?? P room cc???
---
Nice try live streamer
---
she*
---
If it were me, I'd take this one nice and slow. List it on the GE for 700m and give it 48 hours. If no sell, drop the price by 10-15m and wait another 48 hours. Lowest I'd personally list for is probably 625m, unless you're super desperate, than no less than 600m for sure.

How do we know you have nothing or only a clue? How can you immediately prove that to someone? Ask anyone who PKs regularly, and they'll have that story about the naked guy they killed for bank.
---
If you lose your clue it is 100 percent your own fault. You don't need more then 3 items, and if you do you can drop the extra before you die, and if you can't you can use a clue box, and if you can't afford that you can drop the clue and come pick it back up. If you lose a clue in the wilderness, it's because you're bloody stupid and no amount of "kindness" from PKers can fix that.

I'd rather not have the whip at all, but if it gets voted in at least don't make it look goofy
---
so they ran?
---
It‚Äôs not as shallow as it is pathetic m8
---
Yours looks much more like a *whip*
---
Fair enough, but there's still some flaws with that: it's level 60 and costs 11M. I'd imagine a Hydra flail/mace to be level 70 and ideally around 5M in price. To prevent it from devaluing the bludgeon, it could be a slower weapon like the leaf-bladed battleaxe.
---
Why, yes! That *is* the point of the joke. Congratulations on understanding humor!
---
How does one kill anything with no cb Stat? 
---
Attacker and collector are both pretty easy. If your team is good and doesnt need the cannons collector is easier because you're basically useless. 
---
I just tan dragon hides for mine usually. 
---
Zulrah is possible with stats as low as 70 range and 70 mage with rcb or msb and ibans. Recommended, hell no, possible, 100%. With 75 range and mage with trident occult and blowpipe kills would become much quicker, but at those stats you might make like 1-2m profit an hour if lucky and you dont die which if you havent done a lot of kills isnt likely. Happy if it helps

Keep on! Will be like riding a bike soon.

Normal crossbows are generally slower on low-mid defense targets.

I genuinely think this kind of buff is needed for the game to progress. Maybe make it an 80 attack requirement or something, but I really like the straight stat buff.

You can lookup https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_SKILL_training (or https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/SKILL_training if the skill is member's only) and process the page. Parsing it will be the hardest part since each one has its own format. But if you scan the headers using a regex like "[Ll]evel \d{1,2}" you can find out the specific level range the skill is divided on, and maybe have the bot paste the respective paragraph
---
Certain skills don't even have level division on their page, though, like herblore or prayer, so further experimentation and refining will be necessary
---
yeh thats pretty effective tbh

Plenty of shops and other sources provide runes, altough not in as large quantities.
---
Abby dagger is worse. It's just for strength training. Blow pipes OP everywhere but it's range. People only use tent whips for staking and some high end pvm. 95+% of whips in use are regular.
---
You need ores for smiting? Go kill some monsters
---
You need seeds. Kill monsters.
---
You need herbs? Kill monstrrs
---
No sandals not jesus
---
Do rcb with diamond bolt e way faster 
---
Rings are 1/128.  I am not sure if there even is a more common unique.  Imagine if every player thought a post was required when they got a 1/128 drop.
---
Look up some currently famous PK streamers, they experiment with different builds, you'll see which builds are OP and have potential (look up people like Torvesta, or Framed, to name a few)
---
LMAO we are fucking idiots m8. Glad you had this issue too so I didn't have to search forever. Thanks!
---
Why have multiple attack styles then??
---
I've been a player for over ten years and I don't think I've done any bosses lol so I'll probably get fucking merked. 
---
Ur mums face when u stick it in her ass
---
Where, ice trolls? 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs nice seeing drops on the ground, lets just make gwd drop keys to open a chest for a chance at a drop. 
---
This version looks better, good job taking the feedback. My thoughts:
---
-Seed Vault will be excellent. Seeds should not be the reason an ironman's bank overflows.
---
-Glad the agility req was raised (To exactly the level I have...) Also glad it won't really change the kills per hour. Not much use for it now other than convenience as tanking hydras isn't very hard, but I'm okay with that.
---
-Now that runelite has a timer for Hydra, I don't mind at all that a respawn option isn't there. On noted bones, no idea how I feel, so again no issues with it being held off for now.
---
-Hydra helm, rip my slayer points. Jars sound like a lot of dev time for how often we get to see/use them and how many there are already, but I'm sure it'll be low on the list.
---
-Do the bones need a buff? Idm higher profit at hydra, but I haven't really heard anyone complaining.
---
-Bone whip... That's gonna be a contentious one for sure. Was there really "a large gap" between tent and whip? I've no idea. Unless hydra tail's drop rate is really low I see it continuing to drop in price in the long run just like the tentacle did before the trident update. Every non iron will get one as I can't imagine it'll be crazy expensive like most of the melee items from tob are. Also means less people using the tentacle so I expect whips to leave the game slower as well.
---
I do, I ran out towards the end.
---
If you use ultracompost and magic secateurs, it should still be fairly good. Having the extra patches (trollweiss, farming guild) is probably the reason for that price change, since you obviously can farm more in a single run.
---
Mining needs a afk upgrade, its too click intensive.
---
Retard we need some answers
---
No it isn't. With ultra compost, magic secateurs, 99 farming cape and attas plant active, you could oftenly get above 15+ with no limit except RNG. 
---
If OSRS did a rework, I wouldn't expect the Alch prices would need a change. But the bigger issue is how it would impact Diaries and Quests. Then you also need to find new items to put in the space you feed up and would players really want a Level 50 Armor Set or such? It would likely end up pretty lackluster and still not worth the level. But unlike RS3 who has T90 Armors and a clear Power and Tank split, we can't as easily allow players to mine and smith T70 Armors or such.
---
Okay I‚Äôll just say it, alch ursef. 
---
Gz tho. 
---
+15% attack damage against hellhounds, 30% against Cerberus
---
Yeah because someone like that would go deep wild where you can be forced into fair or very unfair fights at any time 
---
agree 1000%
---
Upload to imgur its the only whitelisted image post here
---
Yes, 469 is a free to play world.  It's in silver on the world select screen for this reason.  As I mentioned, you need to select a gold world like 313 (there are over 100 to chose from) in order to log in to a members world.
---
Fair enough, personally id rather grind less boring skills but spend money on fast prayer xp
---
A lot of it is due to the farming guild. First off, I think there are just more people farming now, so that means more demand for seeds. Secondly, more patches means each run that each player does needs more seeds, so that increases demand even more. Then there's the farming contracts, which is probably causing more people that might not normally use expensive seeds like snapdragons and torstols to need them to finish their contracts. Finally, there's the anima patch, which has an affect on patches all over the world, and can either increase yield, decrease the chance of disease, or speed up the growing process.
---
I mean its just a way to double check the location shes assigned you, not a joke
---
No axe in inventory? Gotcha kiddo. I‚Äôll race you to his bank.
---
Take the screen shot.  
---
Go to imgur, upload the picture.  
---
Post the link here.
---
What I like is on runelite I can click the area around the altar from the balloon. It‚Äôs so fast it makes Abyss feel like a waste of time for law runes.
---
no keep the thiccness
---
Welcome 
---
thank u, will research more on that
---
cheap humor. i do not permit myself to laugh lest i encounter art that enriches the soul and mind. tell me, have you read dante‚Äôs divine comedy?
---
Except any QoL change is deemed ezscape from the same crowd. New gear? Ree rs3. Fixing old mechanics? Ree rs3. How do the devs win? Just bug fix and let the game become stale again?
---
Thank you guys for the quick responses
---
Well ..... i just wanted a picture of 99 in all skills so i tried finding one and i saw this one best one i could find i a not good with making things i made my own thumbnails and stuff wich are not that great but hey i am tryijg my best haha
---
did you paint this?
---
There's a basement to the party room?
---
what the fuck
---
1/128 for a unique. I'm close to drop rate so I'm now sure how that is lucky
---
Isnt the value decided by the community though?
---
i admire you seercull merchers for your persistence
---
Just spam in the ge that you're selling 13 trout's, while wearing nooby gear ofc... You'll make 1.4m in no time.
---
Why not use a blowpipe? 
---
Same lol. Might just go do it today at some point and yolo it while I'm snowed in. 
---
nice, that really makes sense but imma try to grind it out first, if it gets too boring i'll pay 
---
Wtf
---
Q
---
1k racks is not enough bring atleast 3k
---
The same way the phishing streams ahve 1k viewers.
---
Viewbots.
---
Lots of people bought them to boost points for hydra through wildy slayer, since it came out they all sold causing the price to crash is the only thing i can think of
---
Theres only a limited number of revs spaces per world, theres also only a few places outside revs where each weaps really good.
---
Revs are farmed for regular drops and stats, the weapons are just a biproduct, so they continue to come into the game
---
Is this a serious suggestions? I think that'd take hours, lol
---
then you didn't actually watch them, what the fuck?
---
Im an ironman BTW
---
YT it.
---
When he puts in his d long
---
I‚Äôve been watching them too and I think they‚Äôre dropping because a lot of people aren‚Äôt doing wildy slayer anymore since they can do konar for the extra random drops rather than the emblems. I could be wrong but just my opinion.
---
haha, hella cheap way to train smithing though
---
lold hard 
---
This was annoying me too.
---
You could also use gyazo 
---
You mean 99-92 / 92 ? xD 
---
yoink
---
Ohh sorry, didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks for the info!
---
They did, looks like someone managed to figure out how to teleport again.
---
That's cool. Did not know this. Thanks
---
niceee gratz man no matter how good u are a first firecape is always amazing to get
---
ah yes, i found it.... *divine*
---
I've seen the YouTube videos, seems too unreliable to actually do
---
This needs to be higher! All of his guides are great except for one quest. 
---
It's just an onslaught of information but not much explanation of it at the same time. I'm sure it's easy though this is runescape there is literally nothing hard in this game it's all a matter of just doing it
---
I think my first random event on my Iron was the quiz master. Took a chance with the mystery box, because 1k gp would have been statistically more useful. Ended up getting an uncut dragonstone. 
---
I still don't have the magic level to enchant it, but I can at least make the jewelry. 
---
Why does this matter though? I don't see the problem with this, why do uniques need to be super expensive? Just because you think they do?
---
Hello? Retard?
---
lmao dork wizard what an amazing name
---
eye of newt is cheating
---
Nope, arma still better, 99 range, potted, riguor. Elite void only good at zulrah for record kill times or if you're using dragon darts.
---
At least he‚Äôs not a HCIM
---
This whole thread just screams: ‚Äúthe lid. The lid. The lid. The lid! The lid!‚Äù
---
50/50
---
Yeah I wish there was something near the mining guild that maybe gave lower xp rates but more afk ü§î
---
Sounds interesting... Whats the clans name?
---
Im just a bit stupid sometimes yall lol 
---
That‚Äôs where I was getting to. I would always kill two skeletons and one bloodworm. 88% is ideal. Good luck!
---
"Be maxed in the activity" also "casual." I understand not wanting the garbage allies that literally don't call once the entire first round but I feel a mild dissonance here.
---
I don‚Äôt get how to learn zulrah without investing most of my bank. 85 stats here too, watched some vids and tried a few times, not feeling confident at all that I‚Äôll learn every phase in a decent amount of time. 
---
Jad is ez but I just don‚Äôt get zulrah - is it just memorizing the phases?
---
[hey its jimmy newtron](https://i.imgur.com/phC63kg.png)

PROS:

1) we have too many whips already
---
2) bludgeon needs more love
---
CONS:
---
none
---
Rich get richer smh
---
Look at mr big shot over here without the clap!
---
That is 100% the reason why I made this gif in the first place! Here‚Äôs to hoping!
---
That's sounds like a great idea. Maybe my opinions of rs3 are unfounded. Honestly, I just feel like I know so very little about rs3 it would be more of a chore to learn everything rather than fun.
---
No. Make it into a crush weapon, we don't need another whip. 
---
When do you eat, go to the bathroom, etc? That‚Äôs 10 hrs straight sitting in a chair doing zulrah, what the fuck
---
Yeah this is like high hp being punishing in wtd. I agree it would be fixed in an ideal world but it doesn't really matter.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
But then most players use a guide due to the arbitrary nature of what the quests expect you to do. Imagine doing Desert Treasure and doing the Trollheim section only to forget the spiked boots and back track all the way to a bank to backtrack again? Or realising you didn't have bat bones, for whatever I reason I guess, to talk to some random NPC to initiate another event? Imagine this is somewhere hard to reach and you have to do this, that might take half an hour to get to. Who has the time? Or better yet, why should anyone go through that when they could play a better designed MMO? I love RuneScape primarily out of nostalgia, and I'm a sucker for mundane number games, which is a huge element of RS ala grinding. There's maybe two quests I've enjoyed overall for the writing, not for the actual gameplay aspect of doing them. If there was better gameplay design behind the quests and less backtracking I'd probably love doing them. But as it stands, no.
---
I died 25 times and used 1m in supplies before getting my 1st kill. After my 10th kill or so I've never died again. Most things seem really hard until you learn it
---
How many nails you own?
---
have the phases on another monitor or printed out if you only have one screen
---
Okay i‚Äôll right click on mobile thanks
---
Is there a way of training Thieving on mobile that isn't horrible? I'm doing 45 to 50 so I can get the rogue gear and blackjacking is horrible and master farmer is slow and annoying. Will the hosidius fruit stall take forever? I need to get the favour as well. 
---
Do inferno pls. I‚Äôve been grinding three weeks for it and I‚Äôd definitely call it hard
---
you have a strange dick my friend
---
fishing on main, agi on alt, you?
---
Massive power creep with the hydra tail, for just a mil or two you get a stronger weapon than whip? Cmon man, not cool. Especially when there are already kraken tentacles. Also very unoriginal.
---
I'll be very dissapointed in this community if its voted yes
---
I just did I yew house run and got only 120 feathers :( no nests at all
---
24 zeah teles remaining, logging in as we speak

F
---
Why does it look like Trump
---
make it a hunter drop.
---
make you actually dig holes in different random spawn flower patches around the game to obtain seeds. 
---
which quest is that?
---
Have you even tried to read my post you bum?
---
testicle aha
---
But I don't have one... is there any way to short sell in RS?
---
2500 brews is okay.
---
Yea I did jad, thought I was hot shit, tried to learn this zulrah thing and have been getting clapped every single attempt 
---
what does a high mining level even add? 
---
Lucky number 7
---
If you do the quest underground pass and get 50 attack you can wield the ibans staff, pay 200 or 250k to upgrade it to hold 2500 charges. Get 43 prayer in wildy altar or someones house in house world. Then buy barrows teleport tabs and you can do barrows with magic shortbow and ibans blast. Ibans blast all the brothers except ahrim and the crypt monsters which you range. You won't make 700k with your stats but maybe 400k an hour? And you can hit some big bomb items worth 2m.
---
The point is that bosses become pretty much all the same
---
The drop tables are all similar with low price uniques
---
Also floods the market with supplies and alchables
---
What type of wood u used ?
---
Whats next? Soulja whip?
---
Your name made me gag.
---
Oh shit that‚Äôs a great idea, thanks
---
can afford a bludgeon but cant figure out how to kill a demon
---
Finished all skills 99 except combats and slayer.
---
Slowly working on slay tasks and doing a little nmz because I'll have extra combat xp after 99 slay.
---
And on my ironman I banked 99 construction so I'm turning the teak logs from kingdom into planks.
---
I don't think it's possible because the Slayer bracelet just gives a 25% chance to count one kill as two. In order to get 99 Slayer off one task, there would already need to be a task in the game capable of getting you within one kills worth of xp of  level 99
---
Alright y‚Äôall convinced me, gonna learn zulrah today
---
Your point? Dragon thrownaxes was about 100x axes PER 200+ hours of raiding. It was a rare as fuck drop compared to now, but was never worth a lot because of its limited uses.
---
Higher max hit on the guardians room
---
Hey this is funny
---
But part of me thinks maybe not quite appropriate for the subreddit? :(
---
Base isn't flared. Would make a bad butt plug
---
iirc: Higher mining level = higher max hit
---
Vote no out of spite!
---
Add me! Rhinoserious 
---
It's not trivial, the numbers are already there, I posted them. Each hour you save costs 13m. Bad idea if you still want to buy other things, good idea if you don't.
---
Wish i had your rng
---
Read the calculations I posted above. I used 1m in darts + scales in 10 hours so thats 100k/hr. 1 kill of zulrah already nets you more than that
---
do you have 2 step authenticator for email? btw this january there has been a massive security breach in which 773 million emails have been compromised, 21 million paswords. check if yours has on haveibeenpwned. hate to say it but if yours has and your password to your email hacked, then maybe thats how they got in.

ye thats why youre probably broke lul

why does this remind me of the default fortnite skin

Not much options since you don't have any combat stats

---
&gt;This new whip will require¬†72 Attack¬†to wield, be non-degradeable and have stats just shy of halfway between the standard whip and the Tentacle whip.
---
So hard to read.
---
bitterkoekje's dps chart with the darts you use when gp still is a thing
---
Why not make the bonecrusher necklace actually useful? Forcing weapons into the game because it "looks cool" is dumb.
---
Cry, shiver, spin
---
yeah, resetting your task resets your task streak...
---
RAUUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLL!
---
There are a few things you can focus on for GP that noone has mentioned:
---
1: Passive Income in completing the Varrock Diaries (even getting to just medium is 30k a day x14 =420k of 0 effort run) and Miscelania.
---
2: Blast Furnace - I am a newish member and have done herb runs etc and made some cash off things mentioned in this post but I have really "felt" like I have made some money.
---
Good Luck! 
---
Feel free to PM and ask any questions from someone just slightly ahead of you
---
For real. At least with the doors there it was easy to tell when you walked through. With this I have to spam click and it *still* sometimes doesn't go where I want to.
---
Why
---
It wouldn't make any cool pk builds. People wouldn't stop at 72 attack just for this, they might as well get 75 or stay 70
---
Oh :) . Lucky btw 
---
Pretty good for slayer task
---
If you don't mind me asking what's your preference for streamers?
---
I replied it to someone else here: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ahhsg6/comment/eefw5g3

You should be a mod with that logic.
---
Boss makes a dollar while I make a dime, that‚Äôs why I poop on company time. 
---
You‚Äôre about to get it man, don‚Äôt sweat it; took me five tries to get my first cape in 2008, and I haven‚Äôt failed the last 30 tries since on various accounts including pures. It gets pretty routine, though consider trying to grab yourself a slayer task for that juicy bonus damage. Best of luck!
---
Iraq pizza

Lol Wut

This was the original intent behind clues! To make people level up and do quests with the hopes of getting a nice reward at the end. While you didn't in their case, you still clearly improved your account by a substantial amount in that time. I think you'll find that to be its own reward in the long-term. :)
---
the person who is hosting those anti scam streams might have found information on the scammers. likely he is claiming those individuals names on the thumbnail are the scammers and one of them is a child molester.
---
i think the ardy one is pretty high up on priorities, morytania is pretty up there too
---
Some skills are fast and some are slow. Lavas make the grind to 77 way easier and once you can do bloods it can be one of the most profitable afk training methods that isnt pvm. 
---
Over the rainbow
---
ANOTHA ONE
---
your 99 fm cash stack should last you till you start getting good gp from slaying.
---
You can store 5000 buckets of any compost each giving it 2 charges for a total of 10,000 charges. But, when you use the bucket on a farm patch, it only uses one of the charges. So its like a 2 for one stackable compost
---
There actually is a bottom to it. You can load it up with 10,000 of whatever compost you want to use. The thing is that using one bucket of your favorite compost on the bottomless compost bucket gives you double compost. So I only need to use 5000 buckets on the BCB to charge it up to 10,000 which is pretty nice. 
---
Because there are plenty of builds that stop at 70 attack?
---
Ironwomen btw
---
You can do mid to even high tier pvm on 150 ping with no issues. He's at tater todt, there shouldn't be an issue 
---
Neat, my point still stands tho lol
---
i believe you man. im just trying to help out and figure how this could have happened. recently my email got a message (phishing email) pretending to be jagex in order for me to click a link to enter info. if jagex ever needs to contact you they will in game, but the thing that freaks me out, is how can hackers find out what your email is? how would they manage to do find out this info? 
---
I like the idea of the entangled abyssal whip, or honestly just the idea of a whip with bone shards in general 
---
I had a desk that was technically too small for two monitors when I was studying.
---
I shifted one of the sides to be more like the "center", and had the second screen stand more on the edge of the desk. So the stand would be more or less all on the desk, but the screen itself would hang on the outside the desk surface.
---
/r/VeganRuneScape thanks you
---
We see you ac engineer
---
I'm at about 45 slayer rn and about 300k left, main worries are for runes atm, especially for doing upcoming barrows/ibans staff and etc. I'm really new to all of this so I feel like I might be wasting money
---
I just sniff deaf runes instead cheap coke, it gives you a better shot lol
---
thanks
---
Ask yourself: "Do we actually NEED this?" This is such a waste of everyone's time. Vote no on bone whip. It's a pretty pointless addition if you think about it. We also recently just got rapier and DHL, do we really need even more one handed weapons?... ridiculous.
---
Cheat client gives you cheats?
---
If you get around to actually acquire the name it the future, take care.
---
2sa on both acc and email, it is not unheard of people hacking just for names to store and sell

I hope you'll get it in the neat future happy hunting
---
barrows should at worst break even on runes.
---
get slayin.
---
Bone weapons always look bad. Whether it be skyrim dragonbone or rs3 drygores. Please no drygores for osrs they look so bad.

No, I mean given the minimal amount of information given with a thumbnail what instantly attracts you to a stream? 
---
Hell no. The idea of a tax to pk is dumb. It‚Äôs already a struggle to get people to pk, forcing people to risk is not the answer.
---
Here is an idea how about you just mute the stream. God the osrs community sure isn't very bright. 
---
If it's an in between of regular Whip and Tentacle that's essentially it's own thing for reliability and no degrading for those who can't maintain Tentacle or need a decent Slash alternative. I don't see why not to add it.
---
Use it for Slayer and conserve your Tentacle for bossing to save charges. Get this until you have the Slayer for Krakens. Enjoy a new weapon for Pking that isn't as high risk or after some time passes won't be as high risk. It's not supposed to replace, it's supposed to be an alternative. I'm sure they're gonna avoid powercreep.
---
soy lol
---
Why do I need to use a staff as a melee strength training weapon at level 75 onwards
---
I actually like the Drygore design.
---
The bone whip does look bad, though.
---
There has been a massive data breach and "I got hacked" posts litteraly 10x since the beginning of this year 
---
Get it up to whatever you need for lunar diplomacy with gold bracelets and start casting super glass make. Or if it's for a master clue drop it because if your crafting is only 33 I'm guessing you might not be able to do the next step either.
---
Yeah same, can't wait to see how they split off from the rs3 storyline. (Which was also pretty good)
---
Hydra doesn't need a unique that improves the most used weapon in the game on top of the good uniques it already has
---
Also the design looks bad
---
Yes but unless you have good melee stats and high defensive bonus you get shrekt
---
Yeah, the rewards for hard contracts are definitely better than easy or medium, and there isn't a penalty for switching to an easier contract. You definitely want to at least start with a hard contract, then if it's something that takes a really long time (like a redwood tree) or is really expensive, you can just ask for an easier one.
---
No it doesnt. Learn to read
---
Ja tiz so! 
---
just do one role at a time, collector &gt; attacker &gt; healer &gt; defender. collector is the easiest role you just have to focus on callouts every 30secs and pick up eggs. once you understand the minigame better its really easy to pick up the other roles. maybe watch a role specific vid before changing to learn some of the ins and outs
---
At level 49 do Hand in the Sand to get 84ish  free sand everyday.
---
Then do Varrock Diaries 2 for 30 battlestaves @7k ea.
---
Buy soda ash from charter stores and use your sand to make unpowered orbs.
---
Charge orbs into air orbs and make air battlestaves at level 66. Then alch.
---
In the end you make over 50k per day and around 6k xp with only about 10 minutes of work.
---
Yea so I completed it, but remember as a F2p player you have to have 150 total skill levels to even use Clan Chat üò¨üò¨ was not an option for me at the time
---
You're entirely right. But a big part of this for me is that I dont care if it has no uses at all. The term "dead content" is annoying as hell to me. Why not just have new content and expand the world that we can play in? Not everyone is going for max efficiency. Some people want to just play and explore and have some fun along the way.
---
Over 5000 dry? ... I'm at 1200 dry and almost gave up

Abyssal Dagger

I'll give you my bone whip (if the polls pass). 
---
Bone flail. Crush style, 70 attack. 1h crush weapon. 
---
That's what I want.

Why would we use a subpar class of carrier when we have the United States Ford class of carriers? Even the Nimitz class out shines that atrocity with its little ramp to help the birds get lift.
---
How many osrs players does it take to change a lightbulb? All 100k bots
---
Yeah, tell me why they don't. Hint: because it's expensive to use, just like blowpipe is.
---
I'm stunned at bow little I've serene lately
---
Is dragon hasta good to use? For range, blowpipe or rcb with ruby(e) or diamond(e)?
---
I get bored quite fast so i'll likely build my account for a few methods including bossing. Thanks for the detailed reply mate
---
Is that a problem? Abyssal Tentacle for attack/defense training, this for strength training. Sounds good to me.
---
But it‚Äôs not true ... agility pyramid makes money, and marks of grace are equal to like 12k gp each if you buy amylase with them and sell to the GE
---
Looks a little rough so not sure how well it'd be able to be implemented detail wise but definitely prefer this style over the poll design
---
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your argument now‚Äù after trying to make a point definitely shows you have a popped blood vessel in your 4head
---
Its multi, if ur lower lvl i sure as hell aint hopping lmao. 
---
No because it's shit, unlike blowpipe.
---
Looks A LOT better. The few last bones could be a little bigger, but this actually makes me want it in the game for its model alone.
---
Extremely relevant
---
yes, this is the first one
---
Tentacle is degradable and consumes a whip.
---
Semen
---
Has the stats of a dragon sword and attack speed of a whip
---
Saying ‚Äúour new content‚Äù makes it sound like the content was specifically for obbies. It wasn‚Äôt. Neither was slayer staff. My ‚Äúargument‚Äù still stands
---
I‚Äôd rather see it attached to the dragon mace and make a flail
---
Hello???? The whip already has an upgrade! Is everyone suddenly forgetting about the abyssal tentacle? 
---
As far as I'm aware he doesn't, unless OSBuddy is still considered a bot client, and then I would having the same issues he is having, as I also use it. Though I seem to recall once seeing a post mentioning using third party clients with OSBuddy having specifically being mentioned, and a response by a jMod saying it was alright to use. Thanks for the response.

Oh just on thumbnail? Well them having a cam (or their gender regardless) isn't important to me for starters. One of my favourite streamers is Lake and he doesn't turn his cam on these days. I'm also a big fan of Hey Jase who doesn't own one at all. Conversely I also enjoy streamers who do use one such as B0aty, Alkan, Sick Nerd and many others.
---
But thunbnail alone is never what gets me to watch a stream. And contrary to what you might find favourable, an attractive woman's facecam (or "face" cam) is not a plus for me. It doesn't dissuade me from trying a stream but definitely doesn't make me think "Yeah an attractive person, that's something I'd like to have up on stream while I play"
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to get at, honestly.
---
I'm millions of dollars and 1/2 way in ranged exp you have to skips is basically impossible for anyone but the most knowledgable and perfectly crafted players to be able to reasonably do this at level 75.

Any quests you can do you should
---
Oh you got it on your 11th clue? My account now.
---
Yeah crafting is a drain on my bank 
---
Aren‚Äôt most whips tapered anyways?
---
What do you need gold for if you don't do combat lol
---
from my experience no only gotten horrible tasks and about 200 kills with no notable drops, from how this sub complained that the drops were so plentiful and game breakingly good you would think so tho. 
---
but it's a video game
---
I wouldn't trust my SO with my bank let alone a Randy.

Before 'lending' anything above 50m, I need to know their password, discord, ip address, and facebook.

2.. 
---
85 is a reasonably high level without spending 100s of hours to get it, that's the only reason. Of course, the higher the better and you'll get faster exp at higher levels but in general, getting levels are a lot slower at higher levels. 
---
Level 55 - 85 = 3.1m Exp (+30 levels)
---
Level 85 - 92 = 3.25m Exp (+ 7 levels)
---
Level 92 - 96 = 3.2m Exp (+4 levels)
---
Prayer is a tough one.
---
1 or 13 prayer - If you don't plan on using expensive items to pk with you can stay 1 prayer or get 13 for super human str. Downside is it's hard to get a fire cape and you can't use expensive gear if you skull.
---
25 Prayer - if you want to use an expensive weapon like AGS, claws, sara sword, d bow, etc.  youl'l want protect item otherwise you'll lose it every time you skull. 
---
43 Prayer - Protect prayers are nice for general game play like getting a fire cape but only really need for PVP if you want to NH hybrid/tribrid and will give you a few extra levels.
---
52 Prayer - Smite is nice for potentially smiting people for their +1 item but again, at the cost of more levels
---
Whichever one you decide on, do as many quests with prayer exp rewards as you can otherwise you'll get a higher prayer level than you want 
---
Nice. So you think I didnt get keylogged or what? 
---
Surrender level 99.
---
Then why turn it into a weapon? The hydra tail already has a use to upgrade the dragonbone necklace.
---
I have my phone propped up on the machine console with a portable battery charger. 
---
Cheers!
---
It is inproportion to my body. 
---
Why do we need an extra use for the hydra tail if it already has one?
---
Why does it need to be a weapon?
---
Why does it need to be used with a whip so it can become a upgraded whip which already exists in the game? AKA the tentacle whip.
---
people like you should get perm-banned tbh.
---
RIP pet tho
---
That would be good too.
---
Nmz at your level would be half what you're getting.
---
70+ stats for nmz to be worth.
---
The only quicker way to get exp would be quests and lamps.

LOL the laughable thing is you, little neck beard hahaha. You seem personally offended that someone was lazy one some pixels.

I bet you even walked upstairs and told your mum about it.

1. Patterns don‚Äôt nullify something‚Äôs difficulty. Being a doctor is all about recognizing patterns: acute vs. chronic symptoms in patients, their previous hospital visits, changes in their medication/diet. Chess is about patterns. Recognizing opening moves, common strategies, etc. Investing is about patterns too, following the stock market trend, looking at companies revenues etc.
---
2. I‚Äôd argue that being 1 hit is not the hardest part of the inferno. It may be the most frustrating. The hardest part is the start of the wave and making a split second decision on how to react + managing gear/switches.
---
3. Just curious, how far are you into the game? Total lvl + PvM wise? Because if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs 1500 total lvl with 1 Jad KC then tbh your opinion is not very valuable. However, if you‚Äôve easily done solo CM raids for example, I‚Äôll accept your opinion because you‚Äôve actually done something most would consider challenging. Just as an example, I‚Äôm certainly no where close to being good at this game, but I have some experience. 200+ KC in theatre of blood with multiple duos, and PB at triple Jad in inferno.
---
4. ‚ÄúJust have perseverance and you‚Äôll complete everything in this game‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean something isn‚Äôt challenging or hard. That same mentality can be applied to nearly everything in life. Just keep putting effort in and you‚Äôll write a fantastic thesis, just keep putting effort in and your company will succeed, just keep putting effort in and you‚Äôll run a sub 4 minute mile. I‚Äôd argue that needing to put effort into something is what MAKES something hard.

No to bone whip, seems pointless. Just buff dragonbone necklace to have offensive stats similar to a glory or something similar but with no defense?

and for good reason.

The new table is so lackluster, clouds is way better

Why not have new content? Why not have an alternative weapon to use if you choose to? Tentacle whip is expensive to use. Not everyone is end game.

Idk if its still worth it, but i did my 1k chompys a long time ago, and had a friend trade me for the meats and bank them at castle wars. You could do this with an alt im sure. They sold for over 3k each, and didnt really take too long to do tbh because a little money makes time go by faster

Hey there, keep going up the ladder for armor. Black&gt;mith&gt;adamanite&gt;rune. FTP is extremely limited and slow compared to members, and I highly recommend membership (not bonds) for new players. In a year or so when you're a boss then it is worth the 6m a month for membership.

Honestly youre probably right. Its probably the skeletal frame they used to model the golden on.
---
Jagex is the epitome of lazy. 
---
Jagex basically admits that the dragonbone necklace is dead content and that it is even dead content with the hydra tail and their only solution is to change it into in an upgrade for a weapon which already has an upgraded version.
---
Just lower the alch value and call it a day. Hydra is enough gh/hour as it is...
---
300m isnt an issue when you can just sell back.

No problem noob

Wait what? I would literally pay like 5m for that

Same, that‚Äôs why I always crack myself up

lmao

And why does it feel great 
---
Vegetasama16 we're s growing clan but usually have people on most of the time. Where people will actually respond instead of your text disappearing in a sea of chat.
---
What they do at that point if you have an authenticator is get your account locked, then recover it which changes the email to theirs. 
---
All this happens without jagex sending a single email to your currently registered email so you don't know until you try to log in. That's why so many people have a problem with the recovery system. 
---
Why would you do this though? Will just devalue the bludgeon
---
and yet still more flavorful than you..

Not true
---
Thought the same thing.

either a nmz hero, or maybe a blue dragon bot(70agil) lmao. also why the fuck would they be at sandcrabs if maxed? lmaooo

No its R for rangers.

No u are not standing alone u are standing with some grass ok
---
Just off the top of my head:
---
- 1/15 chance to save death rune cost when a spell is used on an undead or dragon creature?
---
- 12.5% damage increase when using it and killing undead / dragon creature.
---
- 10% damage increase in general.
---
Ugly as sin mock up of what it could look like if reddit actually likes the idea.

There's no information on that currently available but it would seem they are all equally likely (from the relative task's difficulty pool ofc)

Get your slayer level up. You will make money just doing that
---
Sometimes streamers do it for cash I‚Äôve seen sparc Mac doing it alot also more recently flutten was doing it last week she was paying 2m per runner for an hour I think

Where did you buy Gianne‚Äôs Dough? I‚Äôve been looking for it for years!

What the hell? Bone whip? Why have I never heard of this?
---
Try doing Nightmare Zone if you haven‚Äôt already and you should get it afterwards. I believe you mostly get lower level herbs (~1k gp/ each).
---
All these add ons really making me wonder if all their content ideas revolve around these band aid game fixes... this one doesn‚Äôt even need a fix tho lmao 
---
Yes it is ideal if you're trying to grind Hespori.
---
Just do slayer. 60 attack will come with the slayer xp 
---
OSRS OSRS OSRS 
---
Same way the dragon harpoon special attack is the same as dragon battleaxe
---
Do slayer and just do boss variants.
---
We have enough whips.
---
I explained in another reply, I use the term max efficiency as in max profit.
---
 I‚Äôd recommend blowpipe + kbow personally. Blowpipe is great dps and kbow has nice range 
---
Get full graceful for a short term goal. Quests
---

---
It‚Äôs mobile, had to take a shit so no xp waste. Kinda figured that would be a comment somewhere. Congrats on being the first one!
---
Well shame that, if that's shit compared to blowpipe, guess there's no point adding bone whip as that has 3 strength less than the tentacle whip. Thank you for agreeing with me.
---
They shouldn't even have it if they aren't going to make something competitive with tiny independent app makers can create
---
Holy shit am I retarded for just getting these names 
---
Switch to a rune scimitar, or preferably a granite hammer. The faster attack speed will increase dps.
---
Rock, Sand, or Ammonite crabs are better training.
---
Thanks! Keep getting desert tasks haha

I usually google translate insults to people that speak other languages or rely on my high school language classes. "Tu perra madre" for the Spaniards and tacos, "J'ai bais√© ta m√®re chien" and "Ta m√®re baise des chiens" for the Frenchies. "ich wei√ü nichts" for the germans. That really gets them going usually and I just imagine an angry twink with a bowl cut and stereotypical accent raging at their monitor. It is good for a laugh before I ignore-list them and counter-crash them for an hour or more. I highly suggest it. The bad grammar google translate usually gives just adds to the rage it induces from my experiences. Just make sure you memorize the unicode (alt+numpad for non-english characters) for common shit in other languages.
---
Do Vorkath it‚Äôs so fucking easy it‚Äôs a joke it even makes 2m an hour lol.
---
I got told the G longsword would be the best until 60?
---
&gt;Top search is a scam site, good look rl good shit
---
That's Google's fault. Literally nothing RL can do about that whatsoever. If OSB was the most popular client, phishing sites would be paying google for fake OSB download links instead. But it's dead so they're paying for fake RL ads. 
---
&gt;You guys fucking jump all over anyone saying anything about osb is all I was originally stating
---
No, that's not even close to what you were saying. Are you purposefully trying to deflect or are you straight up delusional?
---
&gt;but I dont see any posts EVER 'just downloaded osb and got hacked.'
---
You were clearly insinuating that OSB is more secure than RL since people don't post about getting hacked from downloading OSB. Somebody else already pointed out that back when OSB was the most popular client there were tons of posts of people suspecting OSB got their account hacked. Besides, blaming RL for getting phished is like blaming Jagex for your chicken tendies getting cold.
---
You retards always revert to the "lul why do you RL chads care so much" because that's all your mongoloid brans can do when all of your points are proven irrelevant. Clearly you're dug in on your OSB stance too, it's just that we're right and that makes you mad.

Could be just a guy who doesn‚Äôt enjoy questing??? My stats are around there and I know that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm like that. I enjoy the killing grind and being able to actually make profit off of pvm. Runescape quest just aren‚Äôt fun to me. I realize it‚Äôs worth it for things like barrows gloves, etc, and eventually I‚Äôll get around to that. But at the time being combat stats are the funnest for me to train.
---
try giant mole
---
I have a love/hate relationship with this sub. 
---
Do mage only kills, hide behind the pilars during mage phase. Gives you time to focus on the rotation, no need focus on switching gear or anything else. Will be slow kills but you should be able to kill it consistently, just take notes of the rotation and switch to normal gear when you're confidient with the rotations.
---
I've always played on a laptop, but manage to split the screen so I can see everything important from osrs and have a Web page open so I can watch YouTube or have something open.
---
Keep up trying zulrah, once you kill it once it gets easier, 10-20 times even easier - barely needing to look at rotations, then after 50+ kills you start killing it without paying much attention.
---
Whenever I kill zulrah now I'm mainly watching a video of some description and barely focus on zulrah. It's a case of when you have it, you have it. 
---
Why is your fire making so high?
---
haha fuck runecrafting, funny
---
The fastest time is just over 3 minutes lol
---
I think you have been blinded by frog overdose, frenchy. 
---
Most kills a druids are a minimum of 50k and I‚Äôve had several 500-1mil kills. 
---
Definitely will in the future!
---
ok :(
---
Get used to the grind homie Cx
---
Wintertodt made me my money pretty early on. Around 600k was a great start to build my account 
---
I did another crappy paint of a Flail see updated post
---
Granite hammer is definitely better. Pretty sure rune scimmy is better as well.
---
True, they should have it at least combine to a bludgeon or stabby. Do we really need another slash weapon and a 70, 72, and 75 tier whip? That would make the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th best weapons all slash weapons. 
---
holy shit i dont know if u saw it but i think you captured a ghost on ur picture
---
^
---
Thanks man! I'll keep that in mind. Never trust the internet, unless it's from Reddit!
---
Let‚Äôs go with him 
---
Lol. Yeah man I just think it has its own niche to fill. If you can toss 300m on a One Handed, you can probably afford DWH/SGS/ Claws whatever for a spec.
---
What build is seriously stopping at 70 and not going to 75 for the ags?
---
He‚Äôs obviously a nihilist for liking one small favour quest...
---
Instead of the player saying it, the dog at the end of barklight will say it, with a bark animation and everything.

Just get an abyssal dagger or SotD

70 attack pure whip pking hell ye

Alright, have fun
---
I thought 6 was minimum with ultra.
---
Ez fix buy avernic poor noobs
---
Theyre actually removing the unf bolts?? Damn that table really went to shit.
---
intentionally opting into lower xp rates Krappa
---
That would be absurd since you'd be able to just duo anything forever with ease. 
---
Same rocking a Gtx 1080 and the chg90 monitor and I mostly play runescape sometimes WOW
---
Thats exactly what I did, no intent on directly completing the scroll. But when I finally unlocked slayer rings I said screw it and committed the crafting which ended up being the last skill for it.
---
Certain skills like Farming, mining, herblore will affect the loot you get. If you're doing wintertodt to build up a bank on a new account, I'd recommend 50 in your gathering skills at least. 
---
When does poll go live?
---
Its borderline bizarre. 
---
Hydra is fine it has like 6 unique drops jesus christ it doesn't need any buffs. I'm genuinely curious how this idea even came into play it just seems so weirdly uneducated of a plan.
---
Also,  plenty of actual dead content in this game that could really use a new uniques if you guys are just cranking that shit out right now.
---
That‚Äôs how spines are though, they get thicker towards your tailbone
---
My last 2 master caskets have been worth less than that.  Most of them aren‚Äôt worth your time you‚Äôre doing it for the chance at mad bank.
---
Hola, si, juego siempre. Soy Arkanis en el juego.
---
I'm sure, do you feel like it was time wasted or was it worth the 600k?
---
Yeah sometimes it takes me forever to catch shrimps. Grate bro, hope you didn‚Äôt burn them since u can‚Äôt just buy more.
---
I mean I would suggest making the cost of healing expensive, such as requiring more runes or another stackable resource to cast the spell, making it only viable for very high level bosses.
---
i don't have a problem with the grind itself especially if the mini game was actually interesting  Ive done the grind multiple times and i'm sure this wont be my last. i think the mini game isn't fun i don't feel like getting a piece of void knight is impactful(because it isn't) most sets in the game give you something even without the full set angler, lumberjack, graceful acquiring one piece is still useful and even if you don't go balls deep on the grind you still have something to show for it. but because void knight requires the whole set to be even usable it makes the grind feel worse so speeding it up and giving each piece of equipment a use without the full set is just good game design 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs crazy, I will admit it would change many aspects of how the game would be played, but my point is that the spells are already in the game, they just suck to use. 
---
Whoever commented before me is shadowbanned. Also talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It's a post about releasing wanted content and you think a typo is proof that JaGex is incompetent or doesn't care?

---
Dude the games already been made easier once. Every year are we supposed to just compound more and more updates because the next wave thinks it should be made faster??
---
I'm all for making PC feel more fun and engaging, but I don't think just simply speeding the point system up is the right way.
---
They needed community to tell them that their loot table was broken. Needed the community to tell them that the tail shouldn‚Äôt have a high arch of 900,000. Needed the community to tell them that combining it with the dragonbone neckless is not going to change its value. Needed the community to tell them to make the slayer master itself give you its rare loot via a key being dropped instead of the loot itself. And even needed the community to tell them that they are spelling things wrong in their updates.
---
you should be able to drop a one, pick up a new one, and repeat. Just pick em all up once there's 23 on the ground
---
At wintertodt it make sense so you can hold more logs. They said on a stream they want to look into making jugs and vials immediately destroy on being dropped there so I hope that happens. 
---
Bigger dopamine rush than a DWH drop
---
While this does solve the problem for most, it honestly shouldn't be needed. The base version of Oldschool Runescape could do with some optimisation &amp; proper interface scaling. 
---
ALL ABOARD THE GOLD TRAIN
---
do you keep it as one of the three items when it's in your inventory?
---
it's like organizing a room or a collection. there's always that satisfaction that comes from putting everything in its place
---
I feel like they could buff it somehow. It's a pretty useless spell.
---
I'd assume anywhere you aren't needing tank armor and aren't on task.  
---
Like brutals and normal dragons you'd take zero damage ranging them I figure, so why wouldn't you be using void?  I'm not sure what setup is meta for the new ones.
---
&gt;Also whoever commented before me is shadowbanned. 
---
Probably OP tagging it as a Discussion.
---
&gt;you think a typo is proof that JaGex is incompetent or doesn't care?
---
I think these are 2 separate things, 1 is pointing out the typo the other is saying that its baffling that this wasn't added on release such as the Jar, and the fact they think it requires new items after less than 2 weeks shows they even think its lacking.
---
Could you listen to everyone and use blowpipe
---
You got it right: Magic hits are 70% magic lvl + 30% Def level. So to defend yourself from barrages you need a high magic level as well as a decent defense. A high range for the gear would also help a ton.
---
I'd say suffering exclusively because of the Recoil damage, since KQ has 100% accuracy with Mage/Range the defense stats are pointless but the recoil damage is guaranteed to proc a few times over the kill.
---
The stats from Brimstone would be pointless other than the 4 str since you're DWH it.
---
What about second kourend?

Cause he is me

Support.

A lot of red btw's will be mad when i run up with that thing

These are insults a 13 year old would make, owait osrs

happy cake day dad

Unfortunately the PVP meta is built around specific account builds (always has been) and anyone remotely good is pretty sweaty (think Rick eating and Gmaul stacking and the like). I wouldn‚Äôt recommend pking with an even account build although it‚Äôs not impossible. If your goal is to kill revs and survive pkers that‚Äôs very doable. As far as snares, teleblocks and ancient Magic‚Äôs - protect from magic reduces there effectiveness and double hides is very OP in terms of mage defense and cheap

don't matter what we say itll remain dead content.. 1 in 1000 drop from a boss and its almost alch value rip dragonbone necklace merchers
---
Every shield you mentioned there is either niche and required for a specific monster, or only valued as a dps boost. Also obby shield is trash and completely outclassed by defenders.
---
The biggest part of this update and Jagex doesn't even respond to it.
---
Much appreciated

Journalist gone pimp.

Just for visibility. Yes, the sim works on mobile. Obviously it's still the rs3 layout, but the prayers are in the same order so it shouldnt be much different
---
thank you friend &lt;3

Round One

FIGHT
---
Yes
---
I would be okay with it, but i feel as a KDT item it is not good. I would much rather see it on something such as metal dragons to make them worthwhile as a task or somewhat. That or make dragon arrows drops from bosses requiring ranged such as arma or something. Maybe even a new boss to have that kind of content
---
Nope. All magic gives 2 xp/dmg, including the trident. Trident just doesn't have any cast xp. You can check for yourself on the respective Wiki pages:

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Trident_of_the_seas
---
As a consolation prize. You can now do all the parts of that clue if they come up again.
---
Double teak benches &gt; 0ak doors
---
Then it should be a inventory only item, granting 2 extra spaces for you to click twice as much.
---
I'm just going off the wiki rates that say 27k/hr from 40-49 and then 32k from 50-59. Averages to about 30.
---
I wish that that dude who wanted to be in your arms was in my arms. Then he'd have nowhere to put that baguette besides in my ass.
---
If you enable it. Its off by default.
---
I'll give an actual answer.
---
For the first part
---
&gt; yeah sure it's dead content
---
That's the problem. Apparently it needs explaining that content only obtained from bosses is better if not dead.
---
For the second part, it does not have to be a weapon. They probably just picked the whip because it is tail shaped.
---
Basically the nature of the beast unfortunately.
---
Casual ba cc - helps if you have a general idea of what you‚Äôre doing 
---
Don‚Äôt use both stick to one. If I do sound ignore the movements if doing movements ignore the sound
---
Honestly though if you think about it, that's such a good thing. Something as simple as Runescape, kids these days are so hung up over a game looking beautiful(which runescape does in it's own charm) is what a game really means.
---
Madman, hope you get pet or claw soon!
---
I thought I was the only one with brains here. Why are so many rs players so fucking racist and misogynist? Sometimes I just think these idiots are children on something... I hope they are.
---
Well done u 10/10 meme
---
Because they ran out of hops and the next time they try they'll be timed out for 5 mins
---
100% Agree on this.   
---
Sometimes you just have to take a step back and appreciate what you have.
---
How this team managed to revive this game is truly amazing.
---
The old 36 double nats thing is done, sadly. I miss it.
---
There are people who still run, but they generally charge. Sometimes you can round up some noobs.
---
Be proud of who you are.
---
Where? I can‚Äôt see it
---
Yes and it's generally better to mismatch pieces for god affiliation in God Wars Dungeon.
---
I did 87-95 all mythical cape racks homie. Git gud. 
---
Out of curiosity, is there a reason you are bothering with tithe? Arguably the most dead ‚Äòmini game‚Äô
