If you exhausted all options, try the general store where you start the quest
---
Pvm updates being forced in the wild are 100% responsible for Pvp polls always failing, they're band-aid fixes that temporarily 'rejuvenate' the wilderness but just create resentment between the game's communities.
---
Texas a&amp;m wya
---
Yes
---
Haha (crying inside) this is me In one master clue I have had to raise 78-83 herblore (8m) 73-83 crafting(7m) and now craft blood runes 58-77 currently 76 will finish tomorrow... I want to die :). ( holding back tears)

there "doing something non-optimally" but this dude literally has full dragon with an acb
---
I started at 58 and took me 44hours which I have nearly grinded out in 1.5 weeks
---
OP please used the screenshot function built into your OS.
---
This game was good don't hate lol
---
You shall not pass!
---
So sorry to hear.  It sounds like you guys had a good relationship and that she was a great mother.  the only thing I would say is to make sure this is something you want to do.  Dont feel "forced" to come back to RS.   Im sure your mom would want you to do what makes you happy so if this does then perfect.   If you get around to this message lmk your ign and I'll add you, if not Im very sorry for your loss and I hope you make it through this alright.
---
The head part made me laugh out loud
---
I destroyed my book got it back then Robin had an option so thanks mate
---
I have full ancestral and a tbow, is there a good guide I can look at to see what I should use gear wise?
---
Just put soul wars portals in the wildy, I'd be game for that.
---
F
---
You know Jagex is English.. right? lol
---
And should I use crystal bow over arcane? Or will crystal be more than enough
---
Please this
---
"save less time" - so it \*is\* worth it? As I save more time using bgs, thus taking less time in total...

This guy gets it.

---
Wow looks great!
---
no
---
The breakfast one reminds me of baron sharks, but a budget version of them.
---
They should increase the base requirement of smithing cannonballs to reduce the amount of bots doing it. That would make it more profitable for real players.
---
Or, you know, just kill the damn portals before the knight dies.
---
Yeah it's shared but I don't have any kc on any other boss that drops it other than vorkath. My kc there is also really low XD
---
No sorry, less time is saved than you would consume during the actual animations of the special attacks. So the net time difference leaves you with longer kills. In addition, you can bring less food so shorter trips
---
I did but it was a 2nd post, was at work and found it faster than editing my comment
---
Reanimated bloodvelds 500 ish 2-2,5 same for wildy altar kinda
---
When you hold out the blurite sword it has no hilt, unplayable af
---
They gave reasoning to why its too strong, can you read?
---
&gt;and to repair you have to use it on the anvil next to your suggested location in the wilderness.
---

---
Or it just degrades to dust like it originally did, making it not op as fuck and giving a reason to actually continually do the content
---
I honestly wouldn't be against the idea of a blessing that beats the radas blessing because a diary being bis everywhere but gwd feels just as odd. Even ardy Cape which is useful is niche in its use case
---
Big brain time
---
Why do you perceive me as having assumed that?
---
You may be able to finish it at 80 combat with decent gear. Read some guides and make sure you know that the only way out of the boss fights is through the portal
---
Yeah, spam clicking a pixel isn't for everyone, I agree. 
---
I do love this game though
---
He didn’t want to die but he didn’t want to seem like a bitch to you. Pretty smart if you ask me.
---
Hardly by a margin
---
That 72k number is from having alts trap the NPC and from before they nerfed the course. (You could clip right onto the slide before from the rock climb but now you walk over)
---
Could a DBow Spec make this faster or meh?
---
Careful buddy, you're in deep wilderness lava maze if steel plates are ahead.
---
Impressive. Very nice.
---
you didn’t think a web browser game from the early 2000s had a cap

I KO’d him and got the pet as I died
---
The checkered one?
---
Oohh! I thought you stayed for an additional kill. My bad
---
Wow
---
You've gotta pay tax for that Swamp Man hood
---
Yeah sometimes it got a little annoying  I wrote down key parts and kinda just figured the rest out I can also watch YouTube as I play towards the end.
---
I mean i didn't really get it for some fat fps on osrs it was just a funny question as to how many it would get. League of legends on max settings can get up to the 240 cap I have set.
---
Chaos altar and change your bones to use from bury.. bring burning ammy ring of dueling and (cake rock, or strange orb)... bring your health down then grab the wine of zammy.. telly to castle wars grab inv of bones Telly using burning ammy repeat..~~400k+ xp/hr
---
Honestly I agree - Jagex is going to have to do something extremely drastic to legitimately fix the wilderness PK'er vs PVM feud. I just seriously doubt that they are going to have the guts to actually do what needs to be done. 
---
When you look around at the PVP systems of other popular MMORPG's on the market, what do you see? You see exactly nothing even remotely similar to Runescape's PVP design, and that reflects badly on Runescape. Runescape's free-for-all, item-loss PVP design is a relic of 15 years ago, and other game developers have moved way beyond it into better systems. Runescape's wilderness system is not fun for half of the players involved, it's not worth the risk for half the players involved, and it only breeds conflict and resentment, which is why the wilderness is so freaking empty.   
---
I know that Jagex is pushing really hard to 'fix' the problem by stuffing the wilderness full of high end PVM and skilling content, but really they are just making the problem worse. In the old old days, the wild didn't have that many bosses or crazy drops or high-xp skilling hotspots - players understood that the wild was mainly for PVP and South of the wild was for skilling / PVM / normal activities. The PVP and PVM communities stayed largely separate and the feud wasn't as bad. But now that Jagex is essentially *forcing* skillers and non-PVP'ers into the wild with clues / unique drops / best xp skilling methods, they are creating conflict. And the more that skillers are forced into the wild to be PK'er fodder, the more pissed they get and the more they vote no on PVP polls.
---
The only long-term solution I see is for Jagex to simply separate the PVP and PVM / Skilling communities for good. Either go to a 2009 style, no PVP allowed wilderness with PK'ing allowed only on designated PVP worlds, or remove the item loss mechanic from PVP entirely. Take away the item loss mechanic so that PVM'ers and Skillers won't be afraid of being killed, and thus will freely enter the wild, and at the same time give PKe'rs some other incentive to keep killing, like 1 point per kill and they can turn in points for unique rewards or something similar. That would fill the wilderness with people again and keep both sides happy.
---
Just turn weapon switching off...
---
Key point being the thug needs to be knocked out whereas knights can stand in one place doing nothing for hours for autoclickers to be used.  With the thugs being knocked out, you would need a friend or bot to knock them out for you if autoing which almost defeats the purpose of simply autoclicking
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Had this happen to me as well, when you call people out the Reddit circlejerkers just downvote you
---
Sent you a pm
---
Every time dude
---
Personally I like a bp for spec and I find it easier to woox walk with as well.
---
LMS is completely free to play
---
Disagree unless you’re taking like Barrows gear 
---
I’m 80 defense and super combat to 96 or whatever and he was still smacking me for constant 15s and used basically an inventory worth of sharks
---
Group ironman would take major engine work. Much of the same work required for a better clan system. It would require some sort of static pid
---
Personally, I don't have anything worth taking, just junk and stuff. But something I would like is a Godsword. Bandos, which if I remember correctly is like 9m, but I could be wrong.
---
Lemme know next time you're cleaning
---
Blowpipe is slower friend.
---
Killing dhers with splatters, endless fun
---
im calm, just pointing out a coincidence?
---
Wear dragon, take a super combat potion, full inventory of sharks or better and a couple Sara brews (and thus restores) and you should be fine 
---
Defense is a bit low for the first boss cause he hits hard but the other ones are safespottable 
---
Only sucky part is if you die then you lose your shit that isn’t protected cause the fight is instanced
---
I have a item I could do it with to try and see if it will work. I have no problem.
---
He turns of prayer for specials so he loses dps aswell, this kid is a flexer with no efficiency.
---
All they will find is a rucksack full of dildos
---
Correct me if i’m wrong but wasn’t Vesta a Woman?

The cape could be the Sail itself.
---

And a gust of wind blows you into the wilderness
---
What?
---
The engine uses integer division (whole numbers only). There's 1000 milliseconds in a second, so dividing by 60 would get you about 16.7 milliseconds. You could round the number but it could lead to inconsistent game ticks, so they decided on 50 fps (1000ms / 50 = 20). Just made it easier to develop the engine back in the day.
---
And thus starts the long quest line where all the insects in runescape die all leading back to hundreds of thousands of callous idiots running around spraying insect repellent on the beehives just to get some honey. Now there is a worldwide famine because nobody can get their crops to grow!
---
Feel free, but i can tell you that is 100% how it works.
---
The lose in dps for dbow is pretty high. But if you could Rambo a last hit with dbow it might.
---
Just get in there and do it. I got zammy spear on my ironman with worse stats then you. You ain't gonna learn by watching some guide made for maxed main in max gear. Go put in the leg work.
---
Someone should make a sub for all FC posts to be filtered into lol
---
Maybe with different rewards
---
Medium+? That's a bit unlucky. I've done 100 of each med and hard and I think my best clue was a little over 1m 
---
Over half the expected value of opening a medium clue comes from the chance of rangers so they're very high roll dependent
---
check if the code matches?
---
okay? lmao you got me man i’m pathetic for watching a form of entertainment you don’t like. all this bc you can’t read and I’M the pathetic one? hahahahahaahahhahah good one.

I tele to my POH and use my bird bath to restore anything greater than 1 prayer point and about 5 run energy.
---
I also don’t have the super high level bird bath so I have to restore my health at the bank, and I do so with lobsters because they’re the cheapest food in my bank.
---
The genie lamps are such a small boost that it doesn't really matter what you use them on, if there's a skill you're specifically working on leveling up then it's probably a good choice. 
---
If there's no one specific skill you want a tiny boost in, then most people choose tedious (runecrafting, agility, mining) or expensive (construction, herblore, prayer) skills.
---

Imma be shooting darts through a glassblowing pipe bro

Ardy tele to bank? That's a long run.

This is very techinical and probably non of us here can answer but wouldn't it be possible to detech apps on the phone? Make it mandatory to to have permission to open other apps if you need to, then when u detect the present of any botting app, BAN

Ye no.

you're straight up too ez lol a literal walking weeb cliche
---
Bro what other cape is in the picture
---
And? Without pve content, why not just remove the wildy and make everyone fight in the duel arena
---
It’s simple really PvMs vote no to PvP updates because PvP players are the most toxic fucks on the game the wildly is dead content for most people because of them. you could have literally nothing on you and they still break their neck to kill you.
---
@wannabe
---
@The Deli
---
@dbone
---
... This Members Content we permitted F2P to use? It is getting botted and crashing prices and ruining the game experience?

Then we must remove trees, runecrafting ores, fishing, all combat! Cows have to go too!

Don't be afraid or guilty to feel happy. She'd want you to feel as happy as you can manage.
---
Already have the BGS, you think I should hold onto both? I mean if I save up enough for a DWH then I'm almost all the way to a Dex scroll, seems like I'd wanna just hold on for a little while longer and buy that instead.
---
We should make a third accept screen incase the second one didn't work.
---
Meh, I don't consider that lazy, more like making the best of your preferred playstyle (in the same boat with lots of afk time for class/homework.  
---
22 healing food isn't exactly the easiest thing to obtain in mass, I like your approach to it.
---
Honestly construction giving essentially a teleport everywhere is so good, I don't know how other capes could keep up. That is like ranged Cape retains 100% of ammo good. Or agility cape reducing stamina drain from running by half. Hell these sound dope. Let's buff all the capes to be this good.
---
Im maxed but im too lazy to do kandarin and falador elite diaries.

No worries

The ring of suffering is there for zulrah, and bandos godsword for vorkath.

If you find the blowpipe to be too expensive to upkeep, you can switch it out for a magic shortbow (i) with rune/ amethyst arrows.

mines 1:12 as well not max combat yet and no infernal or avernic

So is the timer based per section and not per vein then? Maybe I should read the wiki cuz I don't understand lol

You might have seen [this upgrade guide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581817716844003357/581818230096789515/Progression.png) before but I find it pretty useful. Keep in mind that it's specific to Cox, but can be used as a general bossing progression.
---
Mine's 0:57
---
Girlfriend lol'd. She doesn't play.
---
Yeah that’s an interesting view, I don’t think your the odd one out, I’ve had a few people mention this, so it’s definitely a trending issue. I suppose using the 3rd party to sell also has its issues, and massive effect. If you don’t mind me asking, what makes you nostalgic about the game? And would you still play the new version if the old version never came back? 😁
---
Yes you should read the wiki. And no, it's not per section, it's per vein.
---
It's an online payment system used in the netherlands.

Fletching cape should give a time machine function where it teleports you back before the time you thought doing 99 fletching would be cool

It would be cool if there was some pvp-centric mi nigame that *offered pvp-specific rewards that would be beneficial in the wild*?

I only play on mobile and it saves me time it's only 1 less food I still get the same amount of kills a trip at 99 range 
---
It's just more convenient just tapping the staff instead your just dumb if you think it's a trap when it can make somthing more efficient anything that saves time but yields the same end result is smart you idiot gl...
---
Not even avernic? A real Chad doesn't speak poor
---
I’ve seen private servers with better coding!
---
It's still alive and kicking with like maybe 2k players or so, if that. They're undergoing server merges so all the players in the US would be on the same cluster,  same for Europe and SEA. Maybe seeing their downfall would re-prioritize jagex, highly unlikely though.
---
I'm not on my pc atm, but mine records my desktop even if no games are open, so if I save a clip while I'm in runelite it's actually saved to a folder called "desktop" and is a recording of my whole desktop including runelite. I'm not sure if this was a setting that I turned on to record desktop though or if this is default
---
The same reason I don't play black Jack. I don't gamble with wealth I worked for. I know there is skill in it and I could possibly get rich off working hard at it. I don't want to spend the time as an easy mark to get the skills to break even. And even if I were given a safe PvP learning environment to learn the ins and outs and get good at it; I base line think it's shitty to get wealth by robbing others. Money is generated for time spent in this game, why would I spend time gaining wealth by taking it from other players that worked for it? It just feels scummy.

How do you type a degree in rs?

I've got both on the main and don't think that it should be added and probably sets a bad precedent.

---
the only person at my school who played runescape was a girl and she ate my fruit rollup once
---
Who cares. If people want to blow their gp on some streamer staking, let them. Why is it Jagexs job to police how people use their money as long as they arent using it for irl transactions
---
I dint know if this helps but years later I still know the OSRS map/world better than the town I've lived in for 20+ years
---
What I determined: there are several good potions to make for a regular account to train herblore from lvls 78-&gt;85.  Ranging, Super defense and super restore seem to have the best balance of time to goal and total cost.  For the record, I'm going from 78 which I got for raid brews to 85 for Varrock elite diary.  I assume there are plenty of people who are thinking about doing the same thing so I figured I'd share my findings.  Also all costs were generated from the insta-buy/sell price I tested myself this afternoon.  
---
Anyone else make excel sheet guides like these for skills?  Did I make any mistakes the guide here?  Any other herblore training methods which I should consider?
---
Hello, is there any plans to have servers in Brazil is OSRS too? I really don\`t care about the game not being in portuguese, but some servers with nice ping, maybe a PvP server also, would be very cool!

If I remember correctly you may not have to take the att correct for mm1. I could be wrong but I remember not going back and talking to someone and I didn’t get the final cup bonuses while still finishing the quest

My A1C has been around 6.2-6.5 lately, it's not bad.  Just I used to have a lot of mornings being woken up by paramedics due to low blood sugar.  And by a lot I mean maybe 5-6 times a year.  There was about 30-40 a year with my ex trying to DIY it.  
---
Can't afford a pump so I just buy OTC stuff from walmart.  Stopped going all out with the sweets and stuff and made a more conscious effort to pay attention to my sugars tho and so far so good.  Couldn't live that way any more.  If I stay on track I got another 50 years in me lol
---
&gt;serp doesnt give a max hit
---
it can, depends on lvls/gear
---
@Chumpy922
---
:)
---
The whole point of the max combo capes is so you can flex your max cape while wearing what is otherwise BIS. 
---
Champion's cape is not BIS, so no.
---
Wtf did I just walk into?

Scam
---
That+ justiciar would look fucking amazing
---
Same problem here. I kept asking everyone else in the cave and they just said I had bad internet. I have 300mb fiber optic and I'm running a ryzen 5 3600 with a Vega 56. I would be more excited for black demon tasks if I didn't get that annoying frame drop.
---
Is it still crashing the parchment price? They made it you can't buy it in f2p didn't they?
---
You need to see a professional sir
---
Nice
---
I agree.  
---
My suggestion: Right now competitive LMS is definitely end game f2p content - for which reason I think it should require 32 quest points (champions guild access) and 300 total lvl.
---
The party gets so suddenly lit after you finish it. Balloons come out of fucking nowhere and everyone is breaking into dance within seconds. Every quest should end with a dance and balloons.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Wait, no... Jagex, don't actually do this.
---
Lol only regular 2080s. Feel sorry for you.
---
1/16 people get it in their first 3 kills, 1-(49/50)^3 = .94 = 1/16%
---
Abyssal Whip.jpg
---
Neither is the Fire Max Cape. In my opinion, I feel the hours put into maxing and gaining the champions cape deserve to be combined.
---
You have a pretty low bar for "weeb" eh?
---
No requirements :)
---
cant wait

I can only imagine :D

Kinda interesting to always see both sides of this on the sub, pkers who think pvp is dead because of too much change and others who think its dead from too little change.

what is that item in the mage glove slot?
---
I feel it'd pass to be honest.
---
Honestly not surprised to see a performance issue with an amd GPU
---
What I’m seeing from this is a suggestion to never get avernic, so I’m gonna have to disagree. Any time you’re using a dragon war hammer, you should have an avernic defender. With 650m he’s about 600m away from the bow + reasonable gear, so the defender will pay for itself by the time he can finally afford the bow
---
Wait are you using void with a slayer helm in this pic?
---
Boosting prayer only gives you more prayer points, doesn't let you use higher level prayers/complete achievements.
---
As a rule, you cannot boost for any equipment, be it weapons, armor, or jewelry, so I would assume the same applies to zenyte.
---
No, the boots only give a 0.2% xp boost which rounds down to no extra xp from iron (possibly? or you may have just been missing the occasional 36xp drop every 10 ores)
---
You will never reach truth!
---
Jesus christ i just sold 3 for 4.7m each last week
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself :P
---
Kandarin helm does the same
---
i think id make super restores ud end up using them anyway eventually

Toxicity exists in every sub community. Whether it’s PvM, skilling or PvP. Most pvpers are toxic to each other. I’d bet my left nut that if I killed a pvmer I’d get flamed more often than not. Stop circle jerking the anti PvP Reddit hive mind.
---
I feel like the important part of the story is wanting the most afk fishing method in the game.

How many players do you think would have that cape? Maybe 0.05%? Still fuckin sick though, support.

Updates for past few weeks have been pretty underwhelming (Not that they are bad updates), but other than runefest there hasn't been anything to really look forward to. Never really was into pvp to begin with so ofc I'm gonna be uninterested in the pvp rejuv happening/being talked about.

It will only help things to look visually smoother, nothing mechanically would change.

The reason I don't think sailing is a good skill is that it doesn't fit in to osrs. With every skill you have, they make sense in the game. If you want some armor, you can mine the ore, smelt the bars and smith it. There are also fish you can cook and fires you need wood to be lighted. Agility helps you get around when training other skills etc. etc. Sailing is totally separate from anything else. That's why people say it feels more like a minigame. Training skills makes you a better all around character. Training sailing makes you better at training sailing. That's what warding did well.

It's /disco in the console

No.

The only time they have given stuff back was when it was found out that one of their own employees was the person (or reason) behind the hacks. That was only targeting ultra-high wealth individuals (we're talking 10 billion+). 
---
I don't believe they have ever given items back otherwise.
---
Makes sense, cheers

Let people do whatever they want, but he has set big goals for himself. He evidently wants to make it big on Youtube, and he acts as though the character is going to do it. Honestly, would you watch a standard account progress series with that personality? Everyone watches his video for the spectacle, for the knowledge in it, and to see it actually be done. Thats why settled can ubiquitously get 350-500k views on a video, but Rendis views wildly scale with how iconic the content is. He got 350k on the fire cape video, but then only 70k on the MEP2 video that came after? This is not a dedicated audience, its hit or miss viral content
---
bet you those girls that bank stand at the G.E are soaking wet
---
Well its high reward high risk. U can make like what. 3-4m on revs if u dont get pked? Maybe 5m skulled?
---
If u dont wanna take high risk then dont expect high reward
---
That sounds a bit op.  That’s basically another crafting cape with how close it is to a bank.  I don’t mind it for crafting but for the easiest skill in the game, getting 99 shouldn’t give you something that op
---
Ah, understood. Perhaps I'll buy the tormented bracelet to get better magic XP/hr for a while until I've got enough items to sell off, then sell those plus the bracelet back to buy a Dex.

This is good bait

It looks to me like a cheap mobile game.

I think they are intended to be that way. They use a ton of brews and then shit out a bunch of xeric aids
---
Cor blimey mate, What are ye doing with me new skill?
---
It won't stop the bots. My solution was much better.
---
Have 2 sep shops, 1 for F2P and 1 for P2P. 
---
F2P shop -&gt; Cosmetic only, no tradables. 
---
P2P shop -&gt; normal items and cosmetics.
---
As it currently stands, the only tradeable item is members only. This will not hinder f2p lms at all. The bots will be forced to buy bonds from day 0, instead of buying it when they reach enough points to buy a bond + make profit. 
---
Weath can ban them daily, easy as that.
---
It's been like that for years.
---
Don’t hate me but 127 kill count 🤓

Ironically, unlike Dungeoneering, RS3 actually made Sailing into a minigame in the form of Player Owned Ports.

I understand that is the point of upgrading, but the upgrades seem silly that it jumps from 2&gt;4&gt;50....

this exact reason is why this shouldnt be a thing. giving incentive to people like you the wrong reasons. which ends up with crybabies asking to make things easier for no reason like we have with skilling now cus of skillcape perks.
---
I hope not. I love the game but don’t have the time to play since I graduated
---
How about you go fuck yourself I didn’t ask for your opinion or impute so go do whatever the fuck you do somewhere the fuck else we didn’t go see this movie for the fact we are ddlg or kink related we went because I wanted to see the fucking movie I’m the daddy btw a 22 year old guy who fucking likes movies if they are good so go fuck your self because I’m planning on watching it again and guess what you can’t fucking stop me so you need to grow the fuck up this isn’t even inappropriate your just looking to start shit so move the fuck along you piece of fucking shit and guess what I carry a fucking pistol on me to guess you have a problem about that to so just go to your safe zone where you can play big and bad like you have any fucking clue how this world works and quit trying to tell someone ho
---
100m to get combat stats and a few quest locked items? You're dreaming.
---
100m isn't even that much, and PvPers making new accounts aren't that common compared to clowns staking and removing trillions of gp every couple months.
---
GE tax is the kicker; that'll sort the game pretty well.
---
On a side note, we don't need gold sinks, we need item sinks to remove the BiS gear getting cheap.
---
Like its maxing your combat is so damn quick. I mean it's not slow...but  cut the kid some slack lol

I was about to lose my virginity with my demon butler in the spare bedroom. His pants were off and he was full sail. His hands were on my bed leaning forward while licking his lips signalling the best suck I would ever have in my life. The servers disconnected and now he is left alone in my residence horny as a demon dog while I am sat here thinking how I just lost my chance at sex.
---
This is probably the best and worst thing i've ever seen in this sub, you have my congrats and sympathy

Willing to bet it's an app on your phone. You're checking usage on your phone, yes?

Naw, the monkeys down there drop 1 dose prayer pots. All you need to chin/burst maniacal monkeys is prayer gear and runes/chins. It's a 1/10 drop so when chinning them you get one drop every 5 prayer you go through.
---
plenty of "rs3 crap" in osrs.
---
Why does it need to be updated? There are enough alchables/resources being dropped as it is, and dropping rarer items in larger supply will only make it so that in 2 years the rate drops are all worthless again.
---
Damn this is good.

Do the math.

I highly recommend you joining a clan in game for some instant company and friends. Check out the clan section of the RS forums for a list of clans to find one that suits you. :)

Took a week off and its like a new game. Take a break dude.

With AMD you get full control over how your GPU works too unlike NVIDIA.. Like on my budget AMD build, I have completely disabled all textures in all 3D games..
---
Just told my GPU to simply not render them, and it does that to all 3D renderings.
---
Makes games look really cool too if you're into it.
---
Then there shouldn't be any excessive data use. My computer is very barebones and has everything disabled. Within the past month, I've used 600MB with runelite. 
---
Note: this counts all clients as one, I play on 2 clients. 
---
I've played everyday for that month too, so it's safe to assume around 350-400mb. Something else is draining your data.
---
someone do that but with officer shooting black bolts

Keep in mind with corrupt dragon weapons f2p food can't outheal that amount of damage very well, i think a bit of an oversight on the players behalf suggesting it
---
Someone did. Jagex banned it. I will say i loved rshd but, i feel using smooth animations, renderdistance, 16x AA and sky boxes etc make osrs beautiful. The only thing i could ask for is ui scaling. Osrs on 1440p and above is aids.

---
Oh I didn’t realise that. So would you recommend me getting the anguish before the tormented bracelet?
---
So surely this means we just have to make bigger cards for more powerful spec?
---
Seems easy to do, just keep the scale that works and scale it up..? Obviously it'd require proprietary motherboards and cases but- That's already being done with the likes of the AMD Threadripper CPUs and we already have varying types of GPU sizes and formats.

This might not be a terrible idea, but i honestly think this would only have a really small initial impact, and after a month or 2 barely anyone would use it.

Shards are like 1/250 on average I mean totems are more common than getting 15 shards
---
you just need to be 100% when the 2nd portal starts and it will be enough to last till the end of the round.
---
So what are they gonna do? Die for all their money? Are you dumb?
---
20 hours to fish 36000 sharks? What? Are you fishing sharks faster than i can alch and still have time to bank them?
---
Also after hundreds of hours id basically only have to do 1 - 2k damage per hour which is basically 4 opponents per hour?? I cant deal that kind of damage faster than somebody can cook them though. Which kind of shows with the fact that sharks are slowly dropping which means they can cook and fish them faster than THE WHOLE COMMUNITY can consume them.
---
Now tell me, have you ever pked?
---
the best position is purple.

They are trying to get that bread

i like how this community shares the same kind of craziness 😂😂

How do we know which part of the community is quitting

skull trickin has been a problem. skull was supposed to be a risk/reward for ppl trying to fight in the wildy. it's not supposed to be a "whoop i skulled" thing. so jagex gave you a way to get around that. its called "player attack options" under settings.
---
so that said op, heres the law of the land
---
rule 1: u dont bring anything in the wildy u want to risk except 3 items
---
rule 2: if u ever fight anyone, even fighting back, rule 1 now becomes "dont bring anything into the wildy you dont want to risk"
---
rule 3: there is no rule 3, see rules 1 and 2
---
im sorry for ur loss but when u fight sum1 back u forfeit ur nonskulling rights

When killing corp and tele house to sip pool, use games neck to teleport back to corp instead of jewellry box right next to the pool
---
I did get the kill myself and there was a delay? Whole situation was I was at high altar anti pking someone, killed them, got kill notification and loot popped up. Opened my looting bag and tried to loot but got a generic error like "you are unable to pick up loot right now" or something. A minute passes, 3 people see the loot appear and take it. 3 seconds later the "delay" ends and I can start looting with my looting bag. Guess it was just a glitch then
---
I have been having the same problems since last weeks update, I have tried reseting my internet and also did an internet test everything is running top notch, I also have no problems with other games or streaming videos on high quality. It seems it has to be world lag which I find super odd because my laptop on 4G wifi hotspot runs better with less issues on the same worlds and my home internet is wayyy better, it is very frustrating and made me play way less. I even uninstalled Java and Runelite, nothing worked. Tried using the regular client too. I am from Central U.S if that is something that we might share in common maybe?
---
I am going to do test of every american world and see if I can find out that works. I have never had these problems before so this is extremely annoying...
---
It’s so painfully obvious let me enlighten your plebeian ass. Mining different colored rocks has immense depth as well as burning different colored logs. The satisfaction and reward you feel when you burn a darker colored log is incredible. Same goes for mining and WC. 
---
If you can’t understand that without me explaining it you I have no hope in your existence.
---
Someone of your IQ obviously cannot appreciate such complexity in skilling. Go back to RS3 noob! /s
---
If you know it isn't special then why did you post this?
---
Construction, hunter or thieving don't really fit into what you said.
---
Maybe OP meant it’s not special to others, but it’s special to them and they wanted to share their accomplishment?
---
I mean it depends on what you want your own goal to be. When I can first thing I did was train combat one goblins and start going for mage and any quest that unlocked a teleport or travel options. 
---
I than quickly switched to getting 60 agility because in my opinion stamina is the biggest difference between the games. Also look into getting a graceful set from grace when training agility.
---
They downvoted him for the truth
---
Okay :(
---
I made good money picking super antipoisons and purple dyes when osrs came out. 
---
Quest items in general were worth bank.
---
thats why he said he wants to get lucky in the next 1k kills to finally get a pet under the droprate
---
this, do those two quests then rush full graceful. it'll be the most useful outfit you have
---
Good call! Let's all be a dick to the guy who was happy about something and wanted to share it with the community he is a part of.
---
You botted to 99. Your day in this is invalid now. Lol
---
I think it may be that you have either changed your email or ticked a box to not receive them at some point. But judging by their track record they probably send them to someone else by accident
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
Yeah. It's not anymore but it is still used. We have other stuff on TH of the same tier but it's not really used anymore so I think that's why people weren't THAT bothered, but people really dont like this (quite rightly in my opinion)
---
That looks awesome. I’d love to see this in the game.
---
Hey that’s not asshole-y, it’s factual. BUT since OSRS is all about luck and our superstitions about it, the general feeling I’ve noticed regarding pets is that once you get the first, more will follow soon enough.
---
I was def in the clan chat. It was full of people, but the only message was that "200m if you go to youtube and check x" being spammed over and over.
---
Should I be worried about my account security? The only way I could think I would end up in a cc like that would be if someone was on my account, or if somehow I joined it, but I can't figure out how.
---
So is the champions Cape if you choose it to be.
---
Teresa May type of way
---
Why is locking something incredible broken behind a quest any better 
---
And you ignored soul split, which with pray flicking completely broke sustain everywhere 
---
Twisted bow is not stronger than storm or the dps of rapier/ovl/turmoil/max str. It's admittedly better than any range gear 2013 rs had but not melee/mage
---
Needed to get to Gnome place
---
Tried walking across white wolf mountain - died
---
Killed goblins for gp
---
Now walking to gnome place 
---
Most stressful situation ever.
---
I really like not having teleports to every bloody square like there is in RS3
---
Everything about sailing sounds fun for me, the whole concept of getting around to explore unknown content fascinates me, and i believe would excite the whole playerbase of OSRS, even the jmods are thrilled about it and wish to add it into the game.
---
Probably bc the Max cape variants are variants of a bis while this has no stats and is useless
---
My ironman has 45 runecrafting this way, haven’t done a single rune.
---
Not a bis don’t know why you need a max cape variant

I had a 2k total 99-99-45-99-85-99 clanning zerk. Now I main a 60-99-75-99-77-99 and have no problem pvming. There's only a few bosses you can't really do "ideally" but keeping it slightly lower cb offsets having to be a leech in a couple CoX rooms to me. But 75 is def viable. Just got quest cape, 99 con, and 99 craft this last week for the pvm and Skilling side of things. I'm loving the build so far, has same dps as my 99atk zerk, but more def and such and can thus go more places and boss better.
---
That’s all the information you need to google it and look at it yourself.
---
You sound to me that because you had to do a boring grind, everyone should do that particular boring grind.. 
---
It is not like that, times are changing, we as players in a changing world dont want to stick in a place that boring, that why \_every\_ game i repeat \_every\_ game needs updates or the game will simply die,
---
You try yourself not moving and doing anything and see what will happen to you, same applies to games, OSRS needs thrilling updates to keep the game fresh for us. u/jagexsween u/jagexmaz u/jagexash
---
Why bother you gonna be poor in both games
---
Yeah I just kinda want 75 def overall just to be able to use all the cool weapons, and Ill prolly go max combat at some point anyway, and make another account for "pure" pking.
---
can you stop tagging the mods, it doesnt make you any less of a retard, go play fortnite and see what frequent updates does to the game.
---
its not always positive, why change something thats already working for a lot of people?
---
Remember bigW. Loved that place.
---
Don't use websites just use some of the swapping ccs in game
---
I'd suck dick for fist of guthix and the great orb project. Two minigames with incredibly sexy rewards my 12 year old self dreamed of
---
If you want to skip a lot of tedious early game problems, swapping over god fro RS3 is an option.  Otherwise I'd say just get to questing.  Ideal starting goals would probably get birdhouse and herb runs up and running if you want money and quest for Barrows gloves.  Fire cape and Fighter torso are good goals to aim for as well.
---
Make an Ironman and let the motivation flow again!
---
its part of their fun and amusement to act that way to uphold its 'culture' as a toxic cc. half the comments arent serious and quite an active cc with their memes. if you dont like it then there's plenty of other chats you can sit quietly in.
---
Nobody gets loot
---
Who do you use to xfer gold? As much as i love rs3, and even used to be a whale of a whale, its just gone wayyyy down hill. Think its time to turn my mains 1b and my irons 1b into osrs gp. Mainly play iron but would be nice to have a newbie main i could practice bosses on before i did them on iron.
---
Hell yeah! Put the money you save at Aldi toward membership
---
You'd have to bury 3,250,000 bones.
---
It would be faster to kill like goblins or cows and bury those bones. Unless you can find a way to kill yourself at rapid speeds.
---
Thats about 2.9m deaths worth of bones. Even if you had someone spawn kill you every like 2 seconds that would take you roughly 1.7k hours.
---
Because bonds are 5m

You just said it’s really annoying when you have to fix the wheel yourself
---
Too bad this is 100% faked
---
Just grind irl money , much easier
---
Kinda bummed considering this isn’t a new game mode friendly for all players. Some of us have full time jobs and children, where some play runescape for a living. And I understand that it’s shit luck for some of us but a new skill or something could have been fair and exciting, not a race to the finish line.  But good work on the creativity. :)
---
After you start the animation of picking the herb, just click twice slowly and it does the same. Spam clicking is not lazy enough
---
Yes you're the only one gz
---
So what it’s like since nobody is fixing it, I guess I won’t either mentality? That’s what I was thinking too
---
keep it up XD
---
GenerateTask just got a game mode.
---
Why didn't you do it at anglers?
---
Did you get your rewards yet?
---
More along the lines of every click coming through at an exact time, since the speed of the wheel doesn't vary.
---
Though yeah your case wouldn't help either
---
Pretty much SC in RS3, no-one plays it for xp because it's no longer good. If it was good then everyone would do non-combat games to get maximum points per hour. Only a few handful actually play the game besides a few who show up for points for the outfit pieces or when it's on spotlight for thaler then most people just afk it.
---
Looks like a really cool idea. Hope to see many different and interesting goals
---
“We decided we’re both grown adults and should be able to do what we want. She found some foreign lover and I get to work on my car now. My daughter is shacked up with some Pakistani gangster and my son is just a dope head so I gotta make due and enjoy some of my own life. Can’t let the small things get in the way of my time. We had it tough as youngsters too but found our way; they just have to take a few tumbles to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.”
---
Can someone copy-paste the article for job people?
---
Some people have limited time to play and can't afk whilst at work. Sorry but that's fact, I myself WILL try to hop if the world is taken but I have limited time to play. I will hop a maximum of 20 times and that's it. I feel I've been fair by hopping that many times in the first place.
---
Also you're afking. There is no justification for you to complaint when you're afking and not actively playing the game.
---
Yes it did
---
I hope you botted it like everyone else has
---
G'day!

Could we look into making Halos at LMS sell back for 100% rather than 80%? Additionally could we look at adjusting their colours, they seem dull (Arma is grey rather than white as an example).

Is it like dmm but without PvP and instead of that having certain tasks? (I mean with higher exp rates and stuff like that). Or will it just be a normal mode seasonal mode with tasks?

The content is genuinely aimed to be wider appealing. We ain't really aiming this to be a super competitive game mode like we've done in the past.

It is a fresh take on Old School and a different way to play, whilst playing less you'll get less points, every point you earn makes a difference in terms of the rewards you can get onto your main account.

i’ve used oakdice so far cause of the healthy reputation, will be looking for better rates though cause they was pretty shit, mainly cause the person i dealt with ‘could only do 300m a time due to rank’ which is all well and good but you know you’re just getting a shitter rate, id say keep your irons gp/a money maker on an account, my rs3 main has all its max telos gear which will not be liquidated due to it being such easy osrs gp
---
Meh update, this is going to cater to a very small fraction of the community. You also need a new account and subscription to take part, Although I guess that's that point.
---
I mean, 9 out of 10 times posts like these get downvoted and shit on. I'm honestly curious how this one made it to the front page lol.
---
Ahh this was exactly the kind of thing I was hoping would be released. I was thinking the other day about how you could have economy/stat resets without upsetting the players who wouldn't want such a thing.
---
Did you read the newspost? They said cosmetics will carry over, but other rewards will stay in the "league" world
---
This seems a bit unfortunate for ironmen players. I know the point of the game mode is a limitation where ironmen are requires to get everything themselves.
---
But if making cosmetics tradeable is the only respite for casual regular players, then casual ironmen players have zero incentive to participate the seasonal leagues because they would have to grind crazy hours to keep up with streamers like MmorpgRS/B0aty to get the cosmetics on the main game.
---
Or will ironman mode be disabled altogether on the leagues? Even then, if it carries over to the main game the cosmetics would be unobtainable on an ironman. It seems like this was not thought through IMO. I thought that the point of ironman mode was to be forced to get everything yourself, not be locked out of cosmetics because you can't grind as long as someone else in a time-locked tournament. In the main game, every item is theoretically obtainable by an ironman, even if exceedingly unlikely (e.g. druidic third age). This will break that.
---
If it's like how King of the Skill was, where we played a fixed number of in-game hours rather than IRL hours, I think it would be a lot fairer. Sure, streamers could make multiple accounts to keep trying for better and better attempts, but ultimately what matters is your personal efficiency in-game, not how many IRL hours you have available.
---
It's not that they *don't want* to engage in the content. But they will not be able to keep up with the NEETs who have all day and night to . play and therefore doesn't see the point in taking part in leagues. 
---
Also, I don't think people with jobs are the lowest common denominator. Most people have jobs or go to school or something that stops them from being able to play constantly.
---
While it looks a little tedious, it looks like there are some twists to make it not as tedious with things like the buffs they described in the blog.
---
I'm excited for it!
---
Fingers crossed for BiS recolours so I can have matching sets!
---
Stsrt with ppots. Pray melee. Only have melee bosses. Once you've acquired enough points buy the absorption pots. It's been a year since I've played so I'm a bit rusty. I prayer flicked the entire time (hella easy on mobile if you're innovative)
---
Quest a little. You can opt to bypass a lot of training with Waterfall and Witch's House, but honestly restarting the old grind feels nice
---
Ranged is the end-game meta in OSRS. Blowpipe and Tbow rule except in very niche situations.
---
Maybe edging isn't the best way to describe it, it's more like blueballing himself throughout the day. If he knew he was gonna play that night, he would jerk off almost to finish and then stop a few times throughout the day.
---
Listen here you little shit..
---
Nope, it doesn't - that's why we'll be polling it to see if you'd like what we offer.
---
I’d be fine if it was just cosmetics.
---
Only if you can play a few hours a day? For some people playing even 1 hour a day is a lot. Why design something that so many people won’t be able to enjoy fully simply because they can’t spend hours a day playing
---
Path of Exile inspired leagues with possible area restrictions? Sounds really cool! Will look forward to more dev blogs on it!
---
I gotta go explore tonight :D
---
Thanks for the response, I feel with Old School Runescape, any player should be able to obtain an item regardless if they were available at the time or not it was released. 
---
I feel like these rewards should be treated as holiday items/ctc in a way where if you miss out on this season's league you can still obtain the previous rewards in the next season. (Perhaps at a cheaper cost? Whilst still requiring to be worked for) 
---
And for the players who have obtained a hiscore they get rewarded with credit on the item's examine.
---
12 games compared to like 300 for elite void? thats 3%. i wouldnt put in more effort for 3% efficiency.
---
In addition to this can we have the tap to drop added to the desktop client? I cba holding the shift key
---
Damn
---
It looks like crap. I will continue voting no on every single "update".
---
They'll be talked about more in a future blog and polled.
---
97 slay here, I've got 2 whip drops and done all my abby tasks. I went 7k demons dry until I got my first whip lol.
---
today, yesterday you gonna post this every day you fucking mongoloid your name is a reference to a addicting hard drug just shut the fuck up and change your name stupid child.
---
Nah you’re not wrong. I’m also not defending it but I don’t think an etiquette guide is really necessary tbh.
---
 If you know you aren't special then why did you post this?
---
Was this polled?
---
That's not very nice.
---
Hi, I'm curious if we will be able to play on our main account at the same time as we're playing Leagues?
---
Only weapons you can’t bring. Should he fine.
---
Which one can you afk more while doing lol.  But i believe zulrah is rising due to bot bans thank god
---
I just wore the skirt to remind everybody to not skip leg day
---
and 3rd party cheat clients still arent banned
---
"who can make the most broken plugin"
---
Vorkath is on average better but zulrah has more frequent uniques and theyve been picking up in price. 
---
Do an hour or two on each and compare the results!
---
Yeah aldi squad checking in, made the swap recently, really happy with the prices of everything and the cool random shit they always have
---
I don't get the mentality behind these ideas.
---
*"Grind all the shit you already grinded but from scratch, also, you have to spend even more time on a computer in order to keep up with other players!"*.
---
It's like they know OSRS appeals to the guy that has too much time on his hands.
---
We POE now boys
---
Definitely
---
If its not on vanilla client only it will just be who invents the best plugins and abuses them the best
---
Then this update is not for you. Not every update is catered for every demographic. Continue playing the base game, and move on.
---
Ty! Will try that
---
99% chance you wont get your name back. Once its gone its gone
---
Absolute fucking shock that somebody that plays less won't be able to compete with another that plays more. That's the nature of a competition on a game, you can absolutely still play and engage to see how far you can get with your time restrictions, just because you might not come first doesn't mean that you can't engage with the content.
---
I also didn't say that people with jobs are the lowest common denominator. Just that people with more time to play will do better in a competition than another with less time to play, and catering to those with less time to play would be stupid.
---
I mean this is cool and all! But I am too busy with school and job to even get a chance on this. 
---
Isn't this just waste of the development time? 
---
On the other hand, I hate competitions. They sometimes bring the worst out of people.
---
Work smarter not harder
---
Do I then need a dwarven rock cake?
---
For this to be appealing to everyone, they could have time-limited leagues every now and then. For instance, a league for most total level from scratch within 24 hours of game time.
---
I always used 13itch back in the day lol
---
If they don't let us play on both at once, I will do the same. Especially if the cosmetics are tradeable which they said they would be
---
hats
---
This word just means “fear of the unknown” and is a less specific, but perhaps still accurate term than the one provided above you
---
We won’t let the mods escape to wow classic.🦀
---
Haha fair enough will remember that, tbf i usually sell one at mid and then just set additional bonds a bit higher. First sold Insta for 5100k hence I set at 5200k, mid price was around 4700k
---
If you RWT ~$20 and vouch for the free mil, you'll probably get like 35 mill which is 7 bonds.
---
Just a thought.
---
Wow I hope my first Abby task be this good
---
100% agreed. plus let’s look at the last time JaGex introduced a seasonal game mode. Horribad.
---
Osrs is the future of runescape. I started playing abt 1 year ago again and I'm having a lot of fun (1860 total). The community is nice and using the old combat system feels really nice. End game bosses can be pretty hard (like zuk for example). Learning zulrah felt like learning araxxor in rs3 if you want to compare... I can feel the magic again :)
---

Dominion tower I believe is what it's called. You fight a unique boss called nomad at the end and can get his cape as an accomplishment.
---
Ughhhh
---
I agree 100%
---
It do.
---
This mode is absolutely not for the majority of players though. That’s the point he’s making
---
Thanks man. I'll eat the downvotes but I stand by my words.
---
Congrats!
---
I dont think its double xp was very efficient for most of the skills it had. I played in like 2015 in a clan designed for max efficiency sc and i remember calculating the rate you gained dxp and thinking it was pretty shit, but after an hour of it, going back to normal scape and getting those fat dxp drops was addicting, even if i knew i spent more time earning it than it was worth. Plus sacred clay is t40 so if somebody wanted to use it theyd have to sacrifice the extra efficiency of better tools and equipment like dragon or crystal.
---
Even if this isnt good enough for you, just make the dxp less efficient to get, no need to remove it entirely
---
Grab your popcorn, JMod smackdown is possible
---
I better be able to use my 99 construction to make a bad ass boat, to light powerful ass cannons with my 99 firemaking, firing the specialty cannonballs I made with my 99 smithing, with the gunpowder I made with my 99 herblore, as I set my mast that I made with my 99 crafting... To cut out the middle man and I'm able to sail everywhere and no longer have to deal with charter ships or any god damn port NPCs!
---
Slayer is my lowest
---
how many points did u have when u get the twisted bow drop?
---
I've seen a couple memes about RS3, what's been going on with our cousin game?
---
yeah playing osrs with a gtx 1080, i7 8700k 32 gigs of ram on a 144hz monitor feels *slightly* overkill
---
Seems like yet another Jagex-pushed update that no one asked for? Just like warding, why do you insist on putting effort in to developing these ideas that no one has expressed a desire for? Stick to what works. 
---
New (in-the-box) content in the main game is *always* well received, *especially* quests. Why not do more of those and keep the playerbase happy as is?
---
Calling all JMODS
---
Drinking bird.
---
It's literally in the image.
---
Glad jagex has the balls to suggest something like this.
---
the game is really fkin stale currently.
---
Thanks bro.
---
When you put it like this - jagex assuming everyone who plays from Venezuela is a gold farming rule breaker and subsequently denies access to the game from this country - could certainly argue xenophobia
---
If they're just cosmetic, then I don't see why an ironman can't pick up the rewards in the main game from an NPC if it's done on the same account.
---
If you're talking about impossible to unlock because of the competition between other players, well, tough I guess, some people play more than others. 
---
I just hope they bring out rewards for casual players (participation cosmetics, or reaching certain milestones etc) and have separate rewards for those who do well. We'll just have to see what Jagex have got planned.
---
Makes a blog post that sounds like a super competitive game mode, says in reddit response its not meant to be competitive and the rewards are all that matters. Now im confused.
---
Sure, there are many factors. I wonder how many manual gold farmers are affecting the gold coming into the game. But overall the red flag seems to be gold prices cut in half since mobile launched. I really hope Jagex can find a solution.
---
I wrote this earlier.. 
---
Pvp leagues would be fun with challenge like:
---
10 quest point gear fights. 
---
Ogre bow finals
---
40 range or lower gear fights. 
---
Firecape required fights
---
God item only fights
---
VENNIINAtIS final hour fogmatches. (3 tile draw distance, giant spider, uncapped gear/numbers, LMs style restocking?)
---
Duel Tournament finish - no looting
---
Castle Wars Bo5 with auto-balancing. 
---
1 defence reset for final hour/1v1's. 
---
Rune Weapons only
---
Quest Cape Unlocked DMS. 
---
You can finish with multiple multiple contests of PvP &amp; enable a lot of people to have fun at the end rather than a few limited.
---
**PLEASE**  don’t let rewards carry over to the main game. Maybe let the winner have a cosmetic that carries over to the next season. But keep these rewards **OUT OF THE MAIN GAME**
---
How were they ever 800k? They alched for 1.2m since the day they were released.
---
I know it's been discussed around the thread and I know it's been mentioned that future discussions polls will come, but I really feel the need to throw my hat in the ring and say that this should have absolutely zero bearing on the main game, including cosmetics (tradeable or otherwise).
---
It sounds interesting and I look forward to following the development, but it absolutely needs to stay separate.
---
I definitely wouldnt bother with it if its literally like the default game. If its akin to deadman mode in exp rates, it might be alot of fun.
---
Ehhh, check my comment above, think there's a clear winner here.  "Trump good" got downvoted to hell, we're still in reddit.
---
Did you lose all 20B on stream?
---
...yeah, I know. There WOULD be if you added better rewards to it like all the pkers here are crying about.
---
This is totally unfair, the account should have never been banned and a great member of the community taken away from us! 
---
Would greatly appreciate a positive result with this case! Much respect to Jagex and all decisions made. Have fun and play safe everyone in the community ! 
---
Yours sincerely, myself as an individual and the RuneScape community as whole. &lt;3
---
Seems fine to me if they're cosmetic. Path of Exile does the same thing.
---
yes
---
Got mine at exactly 70, we're so lucky :D
---
How much more xp per hour was the elf course? Lol I don’t do much agility, want to start but it’s painstakingly difficult
---
yea this isnt nearly as realistic a concern as the other 2
---
I*think* it was a joke
---
(obligatory) Is this what people do post-max?
---
Clanscape player will make up any excuse as to why they should be be able to upgrade from salad robes for free.

---
I hated that trade limit bs didnt mind the share items at all i remember i borrowed a d scim Because back in my day gp was rare....
---
You're a cunt anyway so who cares?
---
&gt; The content is genuinely aimed to be wider appealing. We ain't really aiming this to be a super competitive game mode like we've done in the past.
---
The only way I can see this panning out (and not getting destroyed in the polls) is if you are bucketed into a group of 50-100 players when you join. If everyone is competing against everyone, only the sweatiest players are going to take home the top rewards. On the other hand, if you're randomly grouped into a small subset of the league playing population, you stand a much better chance of coming out on top.
---
Either way, this idea is going to need a lot of fleshing out and refinement to pass.
---
who’s he talking to in chat
---
U got caught red handed homie sucks to suck!
---
i got it pre-max actually, i didnt max until over 1b total xp
---
 Will the goals be available to regular accounts who want to just work at them at their own pace?
---
Tbf they could have the same points, it'll just cost a lil bit in mems
---
You can't alch a bond regardless of what the wiki tells you

Those image based ones really annoy me.

Honestly sounds pretty terrible. It's taking the worst part of the game (the grind) and making it a competitive gamemode? Nonsense.
---
How about an improvement to clan wars? Part of the game that is actually exciting and skillful, a once vibrant scene that you let die.
---
I would like to know if you have any plans to translate the game into other languages, such as Portuguese and Spanish. I'm Brazilian and I would love to understand the quests and events without having to translate.
---
i have an account with 80hp 1 ded with edgewille spawn, once dead i will teleport to wildy using the lever, there will my pure wait and kill with minimal risk. Its like 60k/h and requires no supplies at all
---
Honestly why not remove trading player to player and only allow trading on GE? Would remove Rwt wouldn’t it? The only other way is to drop trade and they could make gold not droppable. Or make it insta despawn.
---
disco disco good good
---
dammit yagex
---
Yeah it's just the competition aspect. If you do win you'd be able to buy it from the shop I think.
---
Milestones would be good, and actually honestly if they keep rewards in the shop consistent between leagues then I'd be fine with that too. It might take 10-15 leagues for a casual player to buy certain rewards, but at least you'd eventually get the satisfaction of having it.
---
I'm not a fan of time-gated one-off uniques that promotes unhealthy gameplay just to get one. As far as I know there are no items in OSRS currently that are unobtainable (in theory) if I were to make a fresh account today. Having one-off uniques is what I'm not really happy about. Anything else sounds good to me :)
---
didn't want to get pisc favour lmfao, i did consider it. i should've done infernal eels yeh
---
What method did you primarily use to reach blood runes? I want this on my 1 defence main but the abyss isn't really an option.
---
not really afk if i get an inv in 1 min
---
which is against the rules. To someone playing the game legitimately, how does that information help at all?
---
I know but buying gold is what is making botting worth doing. So I'd rather quit than be part of the problem myself.
---
Something fun and new? Oh you mean like Dead Man Mode?
---
Yeah man, loved that. Can't wait for the next season. 🙄

No.
---
For non-ironmen hunting herbiboar the caption could be: You didn't get the pet again!
---
I think that's pretty local to certain parts of the osrs community, particularly reddit. There are a lot of people who genuinely enjoyed DMM despite its flaws, and prefer a flawed DMM over no DMM at all. The hardcore competitive nature of it is something that you cant really find anywhere else in OSRS. 
---
DMM was usually the most viewed content and most exposure the game got. It was some of the best advertising the game ever had. I mean, if you looked at the numbers in terms of when OSRS had the highest viewership on Youtube/Twitch, particularly the latter, it would probably almost always be when DMM finals were airing.
---
Can confirm
---
But people at your bracket will have 99 str 75 atk 99 hp 99 mage 99 range. Not a fair fight. That's why people make purrs, pking on a main won't work until almost max cb
---
Good early game goals are the untradeables: Barrows gloves, fighter torso, Nezzy helm, dragon defender. They take time to get but it's a good way to get your account to mid-game
---
What this blog did not answer is *why* I should want to play this. You describe what you're doing, but why exactly should I bother playing this? I have to dedicate hundreds of hours to doing something I've already done before just to get cosmetics that are tradeable anyway? 
---
Why would I, a normal player, dedicate time to trying to win something that you have to be a NEET nolifer to stand a chance at? The jmod comments in this thread imply that this is not really a competition and being first is not the goal, yet the first paragraph in the blog ends with
---
&gt; Level up as fast as you can, complete tasks, and earn points to customise your experience. You’ll have to use all your skill, knowledge, and determination to build a workable strategy – before someone else snatches victory from you.
---
Which says the complete opposite thing.
---
ask the team outside the door to let me go in for 1/2 kills since im practicing theys aid yeah and first kill i get is a bcp so shoutout to those guys
---
You can search the RS official forums in the OSRS clan section to find a clan that suits you :)
---
They are just doing stuff as easily as possible. I guarantee making a new world and slapping some weird affixes on it (increased xp, more monster dmg, stuff like that) literally takes like an hour. 
---
I honestly hate jagex and hate myself for getting addicted to a game they are in charge of.
---
How do you keep interest in the game? I feel as though I’m consistently on a huge grind with not much reward
---
Or just as you get on the boat
---
You’re the one creating multiple reddit accounts because you got banned in a game.
---
Group ironman mode will just like Runescape League funnel a couple hundred players and streamers and that's it.
---
Both of these stupid things are aimed towards 5 normal players and content creators.
---
Found an acb that I had forgotten about
---
Wiki has a great Optimal Quest guide that lets you quest for low levels. I also recommend joining a clan for help and support asap. RS forums OSRS clan section will show you clans that you can pick from to find the right match.  :)
---
I used to dislike fixing the wheel. I actually turned it around to keep me sane instead of mining 24/7. Plus. It's not that hard to grab a hammer fix the wheel and walk a couple of tiles extra, rather than waiting untill someone else fixes it.
---
Lavas
---
PvP isn’t a gold sink...
---
and the high viewership got to witness jagex fuck up time &amp; time again. deffo good advertising for the game
---
They mention its possible to earn rewards that carry over to future seasons, meaning over time you might be able to tune/customize the account.  But as youd only get one or a few upgrades per season, this would be a slow, long term process.
---
Meh

Seems like you have no idea what you're talking about at all. Also the only person who gives a shit about you cancelling your membership because of bots in F2P LMS is yourself. You are actually delusional.
---
Dragon ilk is hard to get out of clothes.
---
Runelite basically solves it for you already
---
Nice, I got a whip and an Abyssal Head on my first task a few days ago
---
&gt; the main focus of leagues isn't to be hyper competitive
---
Yet in the blog it states
---
If the goal is to level up as fast as possible, use all your skill and complete tasks before someone else 'snatches victory from you', isn't that the very definition of being hyper competitive?
---
Botting is against the rules as well, but obviously Jagex doesn't care as long as they profit from it. When the cops turn their heads away, you should just do it.
---
Can you link whatever jagex post you’re talking about please
---
If you've ticked the box "remember me for 30 days" it won't ask you for 30 days.
---
Pisc is probably the easiest to get to 100%. Not sure why people shit on it. It probably takes at most an hour.
---
I did natures for cash, then using that cash I bought everything to do lavas. I don't recommend doing lavas all the way though....they're rough! Being 1 def and doing RC is going to be tough, goodluck!
---
People would just bring low lvl alts to kill so they can get a kill. I’m not in favor of mixing pvm content with pvp.
---
It's been working for region-locked games forever now, with only a dedicated few who have experience with vpn being able to get through. For most people it's not worth the effort.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
\#1 you got scammed
---
\#2 use the Grand exchange for everything you have to buy
---
\#3 you have now earned your \*been scammed osrs badge\* 
---
\#4 you seem like you possibly might be a \*newer player\* to this game, make sure you have 2FA on your OSRS account as well as your email, and completely secure your account by setting up recovery questions. Also beware of phishing scams. Losing 2m sucks, but losing your entire account is much worse.
---
If the aim isn’t meant to be super competitive, why then in the first paragraph, mention that we’ll be “in a race to be the first to complete major Old School achievements“. That sounds rather competitive, imo.
---
You mention the points making a difference on the rewards for our mains.  That is unbalanced towards streamers.  What they earn in one league, others will possibly take a year, or more, worth of leagues to obtain, assuming points are retained.
---
It looks like I’ll be a hard no on this vote.  I’m more likely to vote in favor of overpowered pvp rewards so that I get slaughtered every run to the Abyss.  I’ll give it a read one details are specifically announced and maybe get swayed.  But this sounds like a really bad idea.
---
I just don't think I see the issue if the rewards are purely cosmetic. I think it would be cool to have people rewarded with unique cosmetics for being good at/dedicated to the game. Its not like something like the comp cape exists that would necessitate getting all of this stuff for a main game advantage.
---
I mean, couldn't this same logic be applied to other difficult to attain cosmetic rewards like CWars decorative armor? Castle Wars could easily be considered an "alternative gamemode", or at least somewhere along that spectrum. Couldn't you say that alternative game modes like DMM and Leagues are just more fleshed out minigames?
---
I think that the only real difference would be the limited nature of some of these rewards. If there was, say, an exclusive cosmetic that was only available to top players in a particular season, it would stand to reason that it would likely be unattainable after that season had passed, which I can certainly see people taking an issue with. At the same time, though, the exclusivity of these rewards could make them all the more enticing and respectable. Idk, it's a difficult issue.
---
It's definitely not worth it to do blast furnace without the coal bag. I would set the coal bag as a goal that you can work up to in bits and pieces, I did 20 or so nuggets at a time unless I felt like I could keep going. But I would also mine iron (powermine or bank it, I used the mine west of falador West Bank to bank it) til 45 or 50 mining before doing MLM.
---
For your first question you should quest up your combat stats and then start training on stronger mobs. Good quests include the tree gnome village, waterfall quest, fight arena, and I think the grand tree but I can't remember rn. Waterfall quest on its own will get you like 15 or something levels in attack and strength.
---
Im so sorry bro :/, may RNGesus bless u sometime
---
My snap dragon seeds where in my quest tab for since my account got its first one and found 146 of them

Imagine writing a whole paragraph lol. You think i read that ?
---
Look at this guy over here not being a loser, what a nerd
---
RS3 joke..
---
This is now the current top priority
---
HA-HA-HA WHAT A HUMOUROUS STATEMENT THAT IS!
---
Again, I really think you overestimate how much of a shit people gave about fuck-ups that didn't affect them. People usually just laughed and memed about it and moved on. A lot of the people that shit on the fuck-ups the most were people that didn't even play DMM.
---
Not an option really as I don't have access to lunars and the cost of having to buy talismans for each trip is ludicrous.
---
It's not a minigame though, it's a gamemode and will have its own servers. A minigame is a game inside of the main game, that's not what this is.
---
It's dead man mode, not castle wars.
---
&gt; maybe this becomes the first big minigame of osrs that isn't popular solely because of bis things or xp. 
---
But you have no reason to expect that it will. The last gamemode (DMM) failed. All minigames where the sole draw is cosmetics fail. The only minigames that are populated don't have cosmetics as the sole reward. OSRS players need to feel like they're earning something worthwhile when they do things or it will become dead content.
---
Cheers for the response :).
---
Might just suck it up and do fire runes. will be slow but *shrugs* not many viable alternatives on a 1 defence account.
---
No, this sounds exactly like PoE.
---
Only you can figure out if it's real, here's how to check:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ct0va6/guide_how_to_spot_phishing_emails_and_other
---
They're similar intensity, of anything melee is more afk due to less damage taken on average.
---
You do realise that if botting gets too far out of hand the game will die out. So the bots would essentially kill their own source of income.
---
You should check out the official rs forums in the osrs clan section to find a clan that suits you. Keep trying till you find one that is right for you. :)
---
Hopefully this parasite leaves osrs now

---
What the fuck lol. You're out of your mind.
---
Why are you certain that implementation would be easy for Jagex? I’d imagine it would not be.
---
I know others have the option where the clan leader can choose the loot share style. 
---
You can choose round robin: equal rotatation on which players gets the loot each kill.
---
You can choose damage based.
---
You could chose all goes to the leader to redistribute. 
---
You can choose randomly roll a cc member each time.
---
everyone knows they are the ones funding this war
---
I have a crazy idea.. what if we just stopped adding in extra gamemodes, and focused resources on the main game instead? Yeah, the one that is played by most players and still isn't getting enough new content.
---
Group ironman would be extremely marginal, and the resources required to upkeep it would never be worth it.
---
Imagine I just wrote in my reply that he LEFT Jagex, nobody said he was fired?
---
And I can't blame him... there is so much wrong right now, in both versions of the game. I just hope they tackle these problems rather sooner than later.
---
And here I am thinking I was the only person singing that line...
---
Bruh, you don't need to get the last word to stroke your ego, hush, cause you ain't getting anything else from me.
---
I don't get what the problem is with 2x exp rewards..
---
Even at max efficiency, all they did was make the time sink of playing the game worth the exp lost.
---
Isn't that exactly the sort of reward we would need to combat the "efficiencyscape" mindset?
---
Yeah hard pass from me. Maybe that guy who shit in his chair will be down with this
---
i got no problem with it as long as they dont incentivise playing it by adding items (even cosmetic) into the main game. i do not want to feel forced to log into this game mode i have zero interest in to get some cosmetics. especially if each season offers unique ones. this would "force" me to play every season.
---
## bruh 😡😤💀💀💀

Get void and you can edge ok straight away. Try to go for 94 mage asap and then slowly work toward rigour afterwards. Don't touch your melees

Yea bro it's called a VPN! Stands for...

N - mode

I always use it for porn and cheating runscap and they'll never find me and I'll never be tracked! Completely safe on internet

Why does this look like odablock

Goodbot

no just have zulrah behinde a paywall that u unlock after spending atleast 99£ on TH
---
1gp profit
---
Just VPN through Brasilia make no worries putting your CC number through a foreign server will definitely never be an issue.
---
HyahyahyahyahyaHAHAHA, W0W!

real talk that skill would acually be legit.

I kill him and logout before his clan shows up.
---
They reduced his salary to $11/hr
---
(1)still uses the imagine meme format, sharing it with some of the most toxic and condescending people on the internet.
---
(2)calls other people’s words “vomit” despite of that
---
(3)calls other people childish despite of that
---
(4)thinks saying “have a good day” after every comment is somehow walking away the better man (honestly it just makes you look insecure about your argument and bratty)
---
(5)implying someone beats his girlfriend just because he absolutely outplays you in an argument which you already had no grounds to compete on.

Yeah, i’d say at least one of us is wrong here.

Join us over at r/KingkillerChronicle!

im doing the same and literally just commented on this in game. u sitting next to me?? lol
---
RemindMe! 10 days
---
If you already filled it out it won't let you do it again, don't worry.
---
A game mode for people who spend 16hrs a day or more everyday on OSRS
---
You should find a way to change your name to 'iAmNotSmarty'
---
This man can't be killed by a mortal
---
Here for you if you wanna talk bwana
---
I don't mind this at all, my bonds will go so much further in terms of general mats to get 99's. Especially on items who's base price is set my alch value's. I know bot's suck, but if they truly are the issue, I personally like it. Hopefully it continues to go up, since new accounts are easy to make, let's go 10mil bonds! I got some 99's to pay for.
---
Not exactly sure when but I think they might have been dropped when 2fa was the new thing to add an extra layer of security to your account
---
W520??
---
I thought about this yeah, however I figured the amulet would give enough incentive to fight back.
---
Agreed. I usually spend all of my free time playing games, that's my hobby and it keeps me from being bored. I feel like alot of people can't keep themselves entertained so they leech off of other people's energy.
---
Yay another game mode for people with absolutely no obligations to real life.
---
IP bans are a thing. My country has been banned from Korean games all throughout the past decade
---
That's not so much a serious suggestion as it is an example of something that could work. I'm just saying that not every implementation of loot share is gonna cause economy problems. I just want something to be done because I don't like rolling the dice on one of my team members being a sociopath.
---
climate change
---
I struggle with this enough without any other silliness. Pls no
---
the thing about bosses is making the assumption that what MAYBE 1% (probably lower) of the community is doing to fully optimize the game, is what the majority of the community is doing. the vast majority of players aren't putting in the effort to negate supplies like you gave in your examples.
---
It's literally 2 runs. And they made changes to it to make it less painful (left click to water)
---
Jmods?
---
Looks awesome cant wait
---
Because they make a ton of money from it. The people quitting are just the subscribers, and most are moving to osrs so they don’t lose the sub anyways. The $11 dollars is nothing when people are spending 1000’s a month on cosmetics and spins.
---
&gt;I also see people drop tons of cheap items (worth 1k or less) right at the G.E and I'll pick them up and put them in for 1gp each and boom make 10k profit. Sometimes I make even more!
---
how is this lazy? This is actually the opposite of lazy ....
---
Can someone explain how this yields profit for bots?
---
This game mode requires a new high scores. As well, you realize that right?
---
They’re not. They were an ok money maker or a way for iron men to get seeds, then they were nerfed, and now nobody does them except maybe some iron men.
---
More chores!!
---
So basically a knockoff PoE. Considering how long it takes to get stuff done on OSRS, this is a mega flop.   
---
  
---
TLDR: OSOSRS
---
I do agree, but as many people have pointed out, this is very similar to Path of Exile's seasonals - the entire objective of this is to create a 'fresh game' every so often, with a fresh economy and new goals.  There are actually a LOT of people on PoE that see this seasonal as the only real way of playing the game, and simply give away everything they own to random people when the seasonal ends, because the core early grinding with a fresh economy is what's most fun to them.  I've played PoE quite a bit, and while it is fun, I find the early grind pretty tedious and repetitive... but some people love it!  I can see this being succesful on OSRS, espescially if it has some really fun gameplay perks/increased xp (like dmm)/increased drops/interesting mechanics.
---
We shall see in a subsequent blog post I reckon.
---
Clan system, Group iron and slayer partner update are under the same blanket and the tech for it has been in development for a while. I expect to hear more in Runefest.
---
Security blog has nothing to do with OSRS team, it is for the people in player support. Same goes for bots, that is for the AC team. And what do you mean bot nuke? They ban bots all the time, why would they not ban them for a while just to "nuke them". All in all this mode affects those things in no way.
---
They have more than just 1 dev too lmao. They can do multiple things at once, and to me this mode seems quite exciting, more exciting than changing how WT works lmao.
---
Which would you recommend while using a PC ?
---
yes pls
---
It rolls off the accuracy stat of whatever attack style you're using. If you're using a scimitar or a whip, for example, it will roll off your slash accuracy bonus.
---
New mothods to train/make money, new bosses and mechanics, new updates etc. We ( i am a returning veteran from fallador massacre days ) and i dont know how to build a main with all the new things. İ allways check youtube for new stuff, it is a bit harder than you think.
---
/u/JagexGambit thanks for bringing this up today.
---
why would this be remotely viable
---
wow haha gottem
---
Nice thanks
---
Why the picture of a rock golem?
---
That's why entering the krypt would be rng based on theiving and agility with 4 different krypts to Land in, it would be difficult to get two accounts in the same krypt on purpose, definetly wouldnt be consistent
---
I’d love this
---
Herb runs and birdhouses are a god way to get started. There's approximately three billion "how to make money on a new account" videos on YouTube so I'd recommend looking there.
---
It’s only runescape bruh 😂😂😂. But I need preventative measures so this does not happen again ?
---
Damn you must be really poor if you think 10k is nigerian prince money, toss me your paypal I'll send you a few dollars
---
I can't speak for these leaving mods but who won't go for better offers?
---
However, as Mod Atlas said there was nothing "sinful" and he is just leaving for greener pastures. So far I haven't heard anybody saying they left/are leaving Jage because they don't like their games.
---
But it's so worth it when you get to see that sweet sweet curly fry on the ground
---
What about a PVM boss that only let's you fight it after killing your target in a dangerous PVP area where the amount you bring in/risk is limited to 500-1000k and where the loser always loses 100% of their gear and the winner is only given a 50/50 chance at claiming those items. 
---
To get into the PVP area you need to enter a waiting room that then places you into a different server so all the PVP'ers get pooled together (or limit to 1-2 worlds). You also cannot leave once you are in without forfeiting. 
---
They could also have a challenge mode where you have to kill the boss without banking for up to 2x loot, or give you the option to bank and over the next two minutes the loot percentage would drop until it hits the base.
---
This would do a couple things:
---
Provide a loot sink for pvp items
---
Provide a pvp gated pvm boss
---
Extra challenge mode for beating boss in the same trip
---
back in rsc they added fatigue and sleepingbags to stop botting. ur char got more fatigued by skilling or combat train and when u slept it went away. every time u slept there was a captcha
---
Brought 20 bonds for gold premier a year ago. Just here chillin and laughing at those prices
---
Or Runelite interface options
---
too much engine work duh, what else can you expect when they programmed the game using runescript
---
Sorry. Engine work.
---
True, but getting a scroll isn't as fulfilling as hitting an important milestone level. I don't think anyone thinks to themselves "I'd be happy, if I just got the goblin and imp scrolls"
---
Like an OSRS version of the RS2 boss Nex. Basically like Zulrah/Vorkath with Raid boss difficulty/complexity for groups.
---
&gt;basically made DJ Khaled an npc
---
Top kek

How do people tank Cerbs hits? I'm using a spec shield and hasta, I can make it through the first kill but end up using half an inventory of food and I usually got combo'd out on the second kill. It's really annoying
---
Only streamers will be doing it.
---
You don't use prayer at nmz, you use absorption potions. Just bring an inv of food in until you can get some absorption pots (and overloads) from the rewards chest.
---
PvP is a tough thing to “figure out” nowadays. Back when PvP was thriving prior to EoC, I think the “fun” aspect of it had a much higher priority to players. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that players were younger and a lot of PvP mechanic knowledge wasn’t as widespread (Combo eating, tick manipulation).
---
Nowadays efficiency is king, and like you said profits are a top priority. A pvm boss is a known variable that players can continue to kill with the same method for the same profit. On the other hand in PvP you face unknown variables (players) with wide ranges of skills for an unknown profit and a risk of death on top of it. Definitely not efficient unless you’re a top tier PvP player. 
---
The fun aspect of PvP seems to have taken the backseat for many players who might still be open to partaking. I think players in many games nowadays have a hard time dealing with losing. And when you’re bad at PvP or trying to learn you will lose a lot. Not to mention the guy that killed you, whether he talked shit or said gf, got all your items.
---
Thanks for your deep and insightful post that really eloquently details your thoughts and opinions. It is really useful discussion.
---
Bots aren't their issue either that is for the AC team. Account security is customer support's job, customer support is also customer supports job funnily enough. 
---
There is no good solution for 3rd party clients sadly, they should have done something when OSB launched. Now it is too late.
---
Also they have multiple devs...
---
how's that?
---
This isn’t the grammatical error you are looking for
---
Thanks m8
---
sums it up as in you mean being mute and not responding to every single question that needs answered cause he doesn't wanna get fired?
---
Care to elaborate? I couldn’t find any def requirement for fairy tale but I guess I overlooked it
---
Gear wise you could upgrade to ferocious gloves (big upgrade) and primordial boots (meh upgrade). Otherwise those xp rates look about right for the afk method.
---
Rwt reported
---
It did reach 75% sort of. 75% were in favor of holiday items. 36% wanted prefered continued and 64% preferred discontinued. There was no drawback to voting against discontinued if u were in favor of continued. If faced with discontinued or nothing, it would have definitely increased at least a little. How much? No one knows. 
---
 What should have happened was to just not introduce the holiday items.  This would have been repolled and people would have swung to discontinued since it would be easier to pass. 
---
repolling now isnt really an option. For one, its now removing something from the game so it needs 75%. Two, game has changed. People now have these items and we now have ironman mode. 
---
Also jmods still dont think they did anything wrong with it. But in 2013 they were all against discontinued items which explains why it was polled that way.
---
Worst part is they need to connect to the google servers which means they are spying on you.
---
stop making alts sirine
---
Gold inflation causes people to be able to afford better gear, which they can then use to farm big ticket items like those you listed so more of them are coming into the game. I'd say the fact that they aren't rising could still be due to gold inflation.
---
I'd wager the gold sinks we have in game are completely negligible compared to the money coming in daily even just from vorkath and revs by themselves (assuming materials are processed and then alched).
---
i still dont get it
---
Omg now I want this so bad
---
the graphics were still terrible here. best was 2008-2010 time
---
3rd party clients, well if there official client ran off the GPU instead of CPU I would use it but i just cant. The game's graphics are literally to shit. If they ban the client 90% of the player base will just leave, they really should just hire runelite devs to do the main client work.
---
R/cutenoobs
---
Post nerf zulrah is still better for resource drops. Vorkath gp/hr comes mainly from alchable drops.
---
Its almost always better to just run one powerful GPU alongside a CPU that can keep up with it, than run an SLI setup.
---
At least they finally gave up on making runescape pvp an esport. It was great for the viewership/promotion and the memes when they fucked it up every time but I think most people would rather be competitive in an actual competitive game with a scene and money.
---
It costs 1b to max or so, and then you have nowhere near enough for bis gear. 2b is not anywhere close to enough money for everything you ever could need.
---
There are so many more things to fix before adding more streamer content
---
Oh I understand why it was polled like that. And I agree that it was made with trading in mind so nowadays if it was repolled it would 100% not pass. Kind of sucks that we're in that sort of situation but then again I'm pretty happy that we don't have discontinued items honestly.
---
Some may disagree in principle.
---
I love rs3's landscape graphics, the water is gorgeous. Character models are a different story though 😅 there are some really cool looking areas in the game.
---
Can we get an ornament to change the Bandos tassets into platelegs? Ive always thought Bandos armour was hideous, and it's getting tiresome as a BIS.
---
U can also die right as you kill it. If u die first, you spawn with the pet. If you die last, rip pet.

Why can't jagex just take runelite for themselves and gut the features they disagreee with? Isn't it technically theirs because its their code?
---
Finally a great suggestion. Ill never have a max cape but I see no downside to this
---
Jagex recently nerf'd the XP rates of the Player-owned Farms activity whilst at the same time making BXP and other effects like Pulse Cores work on XP gained from said activity **and** released one of their most powerful Treasure Hunter promotions to date on top of it. Similarly, they destroyed Hunter XP rates as well and most theorize the nerfs were explicitly done to push Treasure Hunter. Furthermore, they're beginning to add Nex armor sets to Treasure Hunter which seems to have been the tipping point for a lot of people.
---
I always had the guthix plateskirt, because it was the only cheap piece of god armour, even the reg legs were too pricey for me

The real one is accompanied by a message to the inbox attached to your RS account

now thats a nice cape

Why shouldn't you get rewarded for time spent on the game?
---
&gt; LMS rewards poll failed because players specifically didn't want that.
---
That's a hell of a stretch
---
I really wish i could play this again. I also kind of want to play vinesweeper again but im dead ass certain people wouldnt even vote yes to it.
---
How do you explain the price of gold on gold selling sites going down universally? Gold used to be close to $1/M two or three years ago and now it's around 60 cents.
---
Also I think my theory would work on most big ticket items as those are the ones that are the most sought after.  There are a lot of factors that go into judging the osrs economy though so it's hard to say for sure IMO
---
I like how hell act like he's joining in on the disscussion then never reply to anyone
---
Why shouldn't you be able to make money for time spent?
---
If its actually like the Barrows it would take a few minutes tops. The IDs for the correct answer are always the same, you don't even have to write any logic to "solve" the Barrows puzzles, it's literally just "Always pick this one".
---
Only under 20 wildy I believe? Above that they are lost or broken or whatever
---
It's more that ppl thought it should be a minigame
---
They would have to be cleaned though
---
Woah woah woah did you say hire? That costs money bro no way
---
Does it solve it for you?
---
&gt; Isn't it technically theirs because its their code?
---
Amazing rng even better since it was on iron gz man
---
Lol as long as she enjoys her time spent
---
Is your girlfriend special ed?
---
if you select from the spell book you only do a manual cast. go into the combat style menu and their should be an autocast button that lets you select your autocast spell
---
If you gotta shoehorn in xp at the end to turn it into a skill it doesn't really have to be a skill imo
---
I wouldn't be sorry either! Gz
---
This should be the Drakkan’s Medalion teleport animation.
---
You wouldn’t have to win a tournament to get the items. You’d get points from tasks and spend them in a sort of shop - look at the pictures in the blog
---
[OSRS should not be a chore for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQhDcyNynjc)
---
Can you explain? I don't know, it isnt their code thats being used?
---
It's more like 5-10% don't want a new skill
---
According to jagex over 85% of the player base wants a new skill, ppl just can't decide on what
---
These are the things.
---
It's almost like not everyone on the subreddit agrees about everything, and that the people asking for third party clients to be banned aren't the people who got mad when Jagex tried to ban RuneLite...
---
Imagine if this guy appeared in your IRL PoH
---
I truly don't trust jagex to make a 3rd party client better than runelite I'd say that have to take over runelite is the only way. They'd probably ban 3rd party clients then come out with their own improved client that features nothing cause its all cheating.
---
I’m pretty new to OSRS, I am only playing free for now so I can figure out if I like the game. What should I be doing first and what should me goals be. I know it’s sandbox but idk what to start out with!
---
They polled it tho?
---
We almost did get it. It would have brought zenytes into the game, but it failed. So we got mm2
---
It's not, learn more about programming before you comment on it
---
U sacrifice yourself to zulrah instead of a gnome child, which doesn't really make sense if you run in there 5 times in a row
---
I hope so, it would be cool to have those kinds of times again.
---
Explain then?
---
Doesn't matter if ur a customer for 19yrs if 95% of the players are customers for 19yrs 😂😂
---
Stam pots are so expensive in terms of gp/xp because they're more afk. You can make 27 potions at a time instead of 14. It's the same reason stringing longbows is always way better gp/hr than fletching unstrung bows, even though the xp/hr is basically the same.
---
&gt;you would notice many pvp related questions that should be a 100% yes vote get like 50%. 
---
Thanks for projecting bro.

Not true, he can do grimy ones

I literally walk away slowly and laugh hes a pleb let's be honest.
---
you braindead bro?
---
nerfed an established farming method by 50% (albiet it needed nerfing for over a year) while allowing bonus exp (+50%) to work on it (earned on p2w treasure hunter). i.e. the old exp rates. same day as releasing the most overpowered treasure hunter promo to date
---
Supply and Command
---
I bet you bot
---
when I started playing there was three servers allowing for a maximum of 6000 players online at any given time I don't think 95% of the player base was playing back then but regardless that has nothing to do with my point at all anyway
---
Pretty sure they meant in terms of supply cost.
---
Makes sense, when I made it snare wasn't f2p yet. I tried doing normal like edgeville pking and it wasn't very effective, but that could work! Where are some decent places for deep wildy f2p pking?
---
Yes. I’m pretty sure the skin is noted as well but I’m not 100% on that.
---
Couldn’t they make a client whitelist? So only clients like their own and good 3rd party clients, such as Runelite are allowed, and then all others aren’t. Or a blacklist on the bad clients.
---
Don’t need jutsicsr although it’s helpful. I’d stay at one of the other two until you can afford it tho. I can’t think of any afk money makers like that
---
I'm talking about supplies not sunk cost you braindead. That should have been obvious. The price of amethyst arrows is tiny compared to the colossal amount of scales used in both trident and blowpipe, as well as trident runes.
---
Just because something is open source doesnt mean you can hijack it for yourself
---
Don’t need justicar although it’s helpful. I’d stay at one of the other two until you can afford it tho. I can’t think of any afk money makers like that
---
Devalues my PETA only ironman
---
dude i use so many guides, efficient slayer tasks and shit. where to cannon, what gear to wear. etc. best quests to start with for xp. etc.
---
Bonds are consumed when used.
---
High end PvM gear is not.
---
Significant difference IMO.
---
Seren armour is non-degradable virtus, then there's tectonic and elite tectonic, there is also upgraded seren armour, so that's 4 better sets than virtus even if you completely disregard tank armour. I'm sorry that people being good at the game put you off from it.

To be honest the easiest fix to dead man mode I think they would of fix it for me was assigning you to a team when you create the account. Like if we had a three team system like ESO, or PlanetSide I think people would feel a lot safer overall, and there would be more solo players. Maybe a way to still be on a clan and join the same team, but this way if just happened to be fishing at catheraby with your Sara boys, and one zammy guy walks in maybe your the strangers all on your same team would jump in to kill him with you if they felt seeing that it's naturally a more comfortable environment.
---
No joining some weird ass forum with some nasly mouth breathers on discord, or hell even joining a clan chat. You just are on a team. The finals can still be 1v1. If the tourny comes down to it you will have to fight your team mates, but you are WAAAAY more likely to get into the 1v1's then you would be on clanman mode.

Heresy.

I am not sure about wildy pking yet, havent tried. I have been on a pvp world to test things out and I do fairly good since I am 42 combat level, with 60 rng and 50 mage. pking in wildy I would assume targeting any spawn points for resources or monsters that bots or ppl tend to use often
---
It's interesting to hear that you liked them, that's not how they're often viewed...
---
I wouldn't say that we snuck them on, Favour was present since Kourend's release, and Architectural Alliance came after (one of many Favour-friendly changes we introduced in the wake of what was quite a panned Zeah release).

Thats what Im saying. Literally why bring a "max set" to kill a Runecrafter. They have no food, no armor, no weapon. Just TB, catch the freeze, and smack him with a whip. He wont be able to get away even in level 4 wildy.
---
It does make sense. They assume you're a little pussyboy who's not devoted enough to actually sacrifice himself to their god. All they think is "oh boy there the pisses-his-pants boy goes again".

After learning of a mobile bot my curiosity got the best of me, i looked into it but didnt buy it .. Dont play rs enough to want to bot it
---
imo vork is very easy to learn compared to zulrah. All you do is walk a few squares to dodge the bomb he shoots up, dont stop walking when he spits the acid out to avoid his rapid fire attack, and crumble undead the spawn when youre frozen also he can venom you but after you sip the antivenom youre fine for a few kills
---
You mean you dont play enough to pay to bot it
---
Sorry, need 99 mage to spellbook swap. Catch the "ENTANGLE" is what I mean.
---
No reason to feel bad, if they killed it alone it doesn't mean they would have gotten the pet. The RNG is account desperate not a monster. I probably worded that poorly.
---
7th brother exists in rs3 but idk what he’s called
---
I don’t think there’s a setting for that. It’s pretty intuitive though, you should be able to get the hang of it pretty quickly.
---
Just let her do what she enjoys dont try to be so controlling.
---
If you go to Game Stop they sell 10$ and 25$ runescape membership cards, which I believe is at a discount when transferred into actual membership in-game.
---
Do you have DHCB?
---
That's exactly what it is
---
There's Akrisae the Doomed, or Linza the Disgraced, so there's actually 8 now. Though Linza is a woman, so not really a brother

I've personally lost a load of friends because there haven't been any new raids released.  It's one of the only mmo aspects of osrs left everything else is just soloscape.
---
Yes! Been using it on Brutal Blacks and Wyverns
---
I dont play enough to use a free bot either .. I literally login and bankstand for like a half hour😂
---
I teleported out right after this. Of course I realized immediately and booked it back to Barrows. No one took it. It disappeared as I opened to door into the chest room.
---
Never forgive, never forget.
---
This should be a smoke spell animation of some kind.
---
Huge fan of duel tourneys back in the day. Combat brackets for the tourneys would be very fun.
---
Looks like p2w Chinese mmo fodder.
---
Good luck, cheers.
---
I I figured this was the case. I mean I do have decent gear atm. Anguish, blowpipe. Archers ring. And occult for mage etc. But I figured it would take some learning. I'm assuming the profit is worth the grind to learn and get good? Would you have any other suggestions for making my bond rent so I have time to practice zulrah?
---
I went for thr bone spear too lol
---
I stated it could have the benefits of the regular max cape with perks. Either way i’d be happy for it
---
Clan system is most definitely a pressing issue. Clans need more support and resources for their communities.
---
Look all I want in life is a clue scroll solver, actively traded prices, and true love.
---
I've already settled for 2/3, please don't take them all away from me
---
I think the game rarely gets good updates because of vocal minority of autistic weirdos bitch and complain until updates get nerfed to the point that they are basically pointless. Look at the crystal armor set from song of the elves, it could  have been really decent tank/hybrid armor, people complained it was too good because it had slightly higher range defense than justiciar, so it got nerfed into being an expensive and inferior d hide.
---
This would be soooo sick
---
I think it'd look cool with the pyromancer outfit

Nice tats.

Seed pod protects over clue, so you have to protect item. And if you are smited, rip clue
---
&gt; Runelite has not been good for the game
---
A number of people who tried to game and quit have been willing to try again with me because of Runelite. The default client sucks, and I dont think I ever would have gotten hooked on osrs without OSBuddy or Runelite
---
sorry SadDaddy2001
---
You're dumb

One of the best looking shields in the game imo

I'll always be standing outside of a boss or activity that takes any commitment
---
"Alright I gotta do this and this b4 I go in, ok grab a drink, make sure I don't need anything else, talk to the people outside the area for 15 more mins..." Aaaaand it's time to go to bed
---
I see a lot of people complaining here and I do think that our concerns are heard and they probably are working towards fixing these issues that we have. However possible it might ease tensions if they responded or said something about what is in the works at the moment. 
---
I think this game mode will be an interesting experience and I'm looking forward to it. I do have some questions of my own that I want to ask:
---
First off there is sign of concern among individuals that their gains in the game mode would be a loss to their gains in the core game mode. Would there be some sort of compensation of gains given out at the end being half the exp or something (assuming no dxp), similar to when darkman mode or whatever that Rs3 mode was that got shut down? 
---
I believe this would incentivize more individuals to test the game mode out, and would theis might be less worthwhile for "hardcore 8+hrs a day streamers" which is a large complaint here.
---
Second would your ironman status transfer to the game mode automatically?
---
Third is it safe to say this is more so a challenge against ourselves rather than against other individuals?
---
Lastly will this be available to free to play players as well as members? 
---
This could potentially be damaging to the game mode If people are able to sell their bonds from their main account to effectively buy currency for the game mode.
---
Roll for initiative
---
Caught slippin in lv 4 wildy lmfao
---
I think they could fix this by having certain challenges that only account for in game time.
---
Or you got hacked and now have no auth ?????????
---
We already have a few useless ones after they've added new stuff to the game. Like what maxed player would ever use the accumulator max cape, or the non-imbued god cape version (outside of fashion scape). I can't imagine a lot of maxed players hasn't done Mage arena 2 or DS2 at this point to get the imbued version, or the assembler version.
---
I realize that these capes were bis when they were released, but they aren't really being used outside of fashion
---
quite ironic coming from someone acting like people haven't played runescape for over a decade without any cheat clients
---
1 person plays a disabled account in moratanyia and now jam flex thinks all of us want to play a disabled account?
---
Vorkie. I mean I dunno how much you want to learn zulrah. I'd say it's always a skill worth having but you can always prioritize something else. Even if you do decide it's not worth it right now maybe in the future you get burnt out of whatever else, you always have something to switch back to, even if it's just for a pet hunt. 
---
Once you get going you'll kinda see what Im talking about with profit being tight. Like once you kill the boss, you'll immediately have to switch over to thinking about how to minimize damage, how to pre-switch, when to run, how many attacks can I do on this phase. Not eating until zulrah is not attackable. If you are eating while in combat, you always double eat.
---
It's the small things that add up to the point where you can just being monkfish or cheese potatoes and bring back 200k+ a inv in like 7 minutes from the time you left the bank.
---
Yesterday I was asking my clan if it was possible to die at a boss and respawn early enough to not lose the pet if it drops one for you. I guess this answers my question lol
---
As if sustained dps matters in 2019 lmfao
---
This guy gets it
---
Couldnt agree more.
---
clue scroll things can be found in the wiki
---
prices can be found from various ge tracker sites, even jagex has one  though it isn't 100% accurate
---
I think that's how they used to look a long time ago
---
Punctuation police have arrived.
---
This sounds awful.
---
Is there room for challenges like "lowest level (total/combat) to complete X?" I feel like that could add an interesting challenge that isnt a straight-up grind contest
---
runecrafting heaven
---
Membership is shared between both games.
---
I traded my full rune for a pirate outfit... There was no grand exchange so I didn't know the prices and young me decided to trust the guy when he said it was worth a mill. I quit runescape for a couple months when realized I had been scammed for what took me a month to get. Good times
---
Honestly if there were worlds where things like this happen I would absolutely play on those
---
Imagine your shit not being secured in 2019. Good luck getting my account, retards. 2fa email linked to phone and not phone no, passwords are 32 random chars or longer, bank pin is randomly generated, who even needs authenticator? It's literally pretty much useless, if you get my password and bank pin you likely have my computer compromised and my password manager compromised

&gt; Botters are mass downvoting these posts
---
&gt; &gt;  (89% upvoted)

That's 11% downvotes for lying to us :p
---
Yes both of them together
---
Unpopular opinion. Tile markers shouldn't be allowed. Neither should bank tabs, and a plethora of other OP features.
---
Me hunting herb seeds after I ranarr of other ones.
---
if that's your main and firstly listed reason for using a third party client it's kinda sad
---
tbh man when it comes ti shit like Konar just block what u dont like doing.
---
You're allowed to have that opinion, its just wrong and you're stupid af for having it.
---
As if it's not easy to reclaim.
---
You're dumb^2
---
Didn't even know second wasn't part of the game
---
Excellent meme, I plan on investing all of my Jahcoin in this one
---
I can see why tile marks but bank tabs really?
---
idle timer, ground items, GPU render, better loot and xp tracker, item names on hover, camera zoom, agility clickbox markers, are my favorites
---
Sorry I don’t like left click black jacking, auto prayer switchers, inferno hand holders, etc
---
Please upvote for visibility.  I hate this right now.
---
It's literally just OP lol. All his comments here are downvoted, almost every comment is talking about how much they need/want/rely on rl.
---
get your head out of your ass
---
Look guys the remainders of 2 dead clans fighting over who is more dead.
---
Well I am a big fan of Path of Exile so why not turn this game into it.
---
funnily enough this happened to my friend
---
you know how he found out that someone was getting into his bank etc? his rs password was changed, that was the first or second thing they hit besides his bank account lol
---
Your link doesn't have relevant information, nor does your post answer the question that was asked.
---
 I don't believe it's possible, unless there's a runelite option to change the chat color.
---
To the polls!
---
So make it a Distraction and Diversion..?
---
Bots made new emails and abused the free trial
---
Ty for still making these bro

New accounts dont get freeweek of members so bots buy bo.ds now.

No axe, get back to work.
---
ban runelite???  what are you retarded?
---
Went to the members area in Varrock
---
That's probably because a ton of players were using OSB before, and slowly mostly converted to RL because it's a better client for free.
---
Not really interested in something that gives main-game rewards for doing something outside of the main game.
---
They turn into seeds. You can pay either money or crystal shards to turn them back into a new shield or bow.
---
The imbue option was removed because it would be useless now. Crystal items' stats don't decrease when they degrade anymore.
---
Cute, love the art style
---
It's also free! 
---
You can get mad xp rates, and do continuous grinding for farming, instead of waiting for for trees, and buying seeds. 
---
If you're motivated, you can go from 34 Farming, to getting the big money making herb runs in less than a day.  
---
...though I think herb runs have become less profitable recently
---
Not worth his 🦀🦀$11🦀🦀

Dude, get over it!

is it April 1st already?
---
It does, thank you for taking the time to run me through the nitty gritties!
---
Doesn't anyone play on mobile?
---
I play 80% on mobile except on weekends, runelite is nice but it's not worth quitting over and majority of people who say they would quit are full of it
---
I'm so happy for you that you got it approved. I got a medtronic and with a sensor and it really did improve a lot and my "life quality" everything is just so much more easy :)
---
It's a task from the master at Canifis, im just getting started into combat and slayer
---
Alch urself
---
I don’t understand how people can max and make new accounts regularly while I’m over here hitting 1250, and 65s for my combat skills after 15 years.
---
like the others have said...Herb runs and birdhouses for sure. Do some questing to work towards doing those. Along the way, you'll unlock some other great content.
---
Some of the Achievement Diaries have daily rewards, as well. You should be able to complete Varrock Easy without too much trouble, and the Varrock diaries are probably the best

That won't solve anything. The but owners have just been sticking bonds on their bots once they have enough points to buy a bunch of traveour parchments. The profits from the parchments easily pays for the bonds.
---
So it hurts more when she steps on me
---
Not protections like this do not work, they just duck over a trial players and make the game feel like shit.
---
Fuck this suggestion.
---
GPU didn't even work on my old PC, just crashed. Built a new one last week, not a fan. Was looking forward to clicking across the map at blood altar, but it's quicker to just use the minimap like 90% of the clicks don't register, and you can't see anything that zoomed out anyways.
---
It could be that you have a set of goals that award x points for completion of each goal, and being the first to do it is just for hiscores.  If you get 50 points regardless of if you're the first or the 5000th, being lower on a seasonal leaderboard shouldn't be a dealbreaker.
---
70% dry
---
Watch raikseys 1b from lvl 3.  He does all the right things up until he goes to dks. At med lvl best thing to do is farm zulrah/brutalblacks/wyverns/gargoyles/zolcano til u have craws+5m then go to venne.... which he also later does in that series
---
They could still use it as a base for their own client, disclosing source for GPL isn't hard, but it's a very permissive license for RuneLite anyway.
---
I've been plying casual for a year (with even a 6 months break or something n I got my quest Cape 2 weeks ago. There was a grind n a route to take but it was well worth it.

Guys let's remove the wilderness.

Add lots of events for people skilling.

We'll stop all the bots!
---
Yeah, ground items is Chad. Tried doing slayer on mobile, gave up after a few kills because I couldn't see any of my loot.
---
Agreed tbh
---
- tell him i have nothing even despite my master scroll book being full.
---
- begin to cry and start flaming him for “having no skill” and “this is the only way he can get a pk”
---
- threaten to vote no on all future pvp polls just before i die 
---
- watch the new torvesta video and realize looking like a whiny bitch was all caught on video 
---
- buy 2 bonds and double name change
---
Unlucky, but probably not THAT unlucky. The chances of getting them are pretty low, and if you're below 65 Farming, you probably haven't done a huge number of tree runs, in the grand scheme of things.
---
https://m.imgur.com/QfDl3qJ maybe this?
---
With how unlikely a skill is to pass, it's the next best thing. More content, it's a minigame so hopefully has a minigame teleport, and on top of that it doesn't "devalue" or ruin anyone's skill cape.
---
That's probably going to be the future of progression based content to be honest, it's the easiest way around making a new skill that relies on other skills without it actually being a skill. It just makes sense, especially if they pull a dungeoneering type thing without the whole chaotics bullshit. 
---
Having a replayable piece of content either needs to give good items stat wise/value wise for replayability reasons or it needs to give bragging rights (and obviously fun like dungeoneering was). Think rs3 titles or something similar, with osrs it'd most likely be cosmetics. 
---
Honestly yeah why don't we have another form of dungeoneering? It was the main and sole reason I kept membership along with my friend group, purely because we had so much fun with it.
---
RS3 has an overlay program that can do clues. It's just as effective as it being built-in.
---
Imagine someone thinking that wanting your game to take up your entire monitor is cheating
---
I posted this day one within an hour or so of the update...
---
Fire surge now does 569 damage max =D
---
Grandfathered in from 2003 bro. This argument is so overdone, yikes
---
Bulge.
---
I haven't heard all three in a long time. The more fish thing was probably trolling in hindsight.
---
Negative mage, negative range, no pray bonus, 100k an hour to use, yeah it will not be used almost anywhere
---
That and Camelot castle seem to have both been developed by some nihilists.
---
There is a zulrah bot ?
---
You should suffer for not being able to recognize every single item you need for each specific activity or not having an organized bank. So if you hit up arma gwd and forget to bring mith grapple or ecu key you should have to tele all the way back and waste all that exp for not being perfect. Or if you're mid farm run and forget payment it's your fault. Otherwise it's super op. /s
---
As someone already said, i believe is replayability. Why get the players of your game to stop playing after max, etc cause they already accomplished all they wanted? Why not reset them to 0 and let them strive for something new everytime again... and again... and again?
---
Inevitable speculation
---
Created using a anti dragon shield and a Molonic Visage
---
Nah directly tied to number of worlds.
---
no problem! glad i could help!
---
Many of glory all the way
---
I need runelite it's so helpful especially when you're bad like me
---
why is the rs3 guy wearing OSRS dragon stone armour ?
---
To max all his stats. His name is ‘Jebrim’. Yeah, you dont wanna know the guy
---
I'm saying that's primarily where Pvp takes place and a lot of these issues related to pvp stem from. It'd be a lot harder to get someone that only pks in a pvp world to vote for something that's meant to thrive in a deep multis scenario at like rev caves.
---
My point being is the devs don't know how to handle conflicting feed back about Pvp when they don't understand it like they do pvm. For each poll that failed there where a few issues I think could of been fixed by suggestions on Reddit yet they didn't ever repoll it with that idea, or try to add a clause into the poll explaining why this or that is changed about it. It's kinda like they give up on the ideas a little faster as if knowing it's a touchy area to mess with so they tend not to do it.
---
Moonlight ay, magic pray
---
Sorry I was at work but yeah I mean vork
---
Yup I totally agree. I just started again a couple months ago on OSRS and I can't think of anything I want to do less in life than grind out early RS levels again.
---
Void sucks just get some ahrims and black dhide. And its anywhere from 1-2m an hour depending on gear and skill. And yeah its predictable because it only has 3 possible rotations, and does the same exact attacks in the same order every time
---
Drop them? Have a cool collection in your bank? Why does everything have multiple uses
---
Generally yes
---
This would be hilarious. Every yellow dot would have people on edge.
---
Even a random event! Seems like it’d be perfect for a Halloween event for a week or two in october
---
Hurrah, more RoT cancer
---
Jungle hunt
---
Wrong. It is the niche. Deep nh and clanning are the bggest types of pvp now. You are right about the devs not knowing what to do. They are trying to revive something that doesnt need it and ruining major other aspects of pvp. Most integrity pvp changes have made multi pvp worse. Clanning is massive and one of the only true social aspects of this game. 
---
The problem lies in thw ideas they pitch. Also they gather feedback from burnt out edge pk streamers and fucking ironmen
---
Use my spade to dig away
---
😂😂😂 this is the best one so far
---
My tears go on mining. Fuck mining.
---
Trick question, drop the clue, fuck the wilderness.
---
can we stop tainting all these legitimate suggestions by adding the authenticator delay meme please? it just makes everything else look bad.
---
People already do this with HCIM, literally grinding out early levels as fast as possible to get as far as they can without dying. There is a demographic for it but you’re not a part of it.
---
I may give it a try with blowpipe and BGS just to mix it up for now and keep grinding zulrah in the off time for money towards rigour. Rigour or DHCB first?
---
