Q

You don't get it
---
Do you use rigour??
---

---
I have 99 range and use pegasus boots and max melee stats for dwh spex which I super combat each kill.
---
Vorkath the drake
---
Oh I didnt even know about this feature, thank you again.
---
OSRS literally exists as a response to what people hate about RS3... otherwise we would just play RS3

He doesnt drink and smoke on every podcast. It depends mostly on the guest.
---
It would be good if he actually mentioned leech ba or ba services and clarified that it costs 10s of mil. Serene knows he can't be too helpful or  normal
---
Although annoying, I do not believe this is a punishable offense. Also, you can report people by just typing their name into the report box.
---
What if they were stupid like ladybug wings
---
Don't bank iron.  Just drop it and use the time you save on an actual money maker.
---
Are they equally as likely to drop?
---
Someone has been buying gold... How can you have 1k onyx bolts and be this clueless 
---
I take lots of damage from the range hit but the mage hit never lands I have pro magic on. Food and prayer pots are both about empty when I do 4 kills.
---
Typically I wont do a 4th kill if I dont have 5 sharks left. 
---
Super anti fire every 2 kills with pro range completely protects me from the magic attack.
---
Even if you could report him, he likely wouldn't even get a slap on the wrist.. there are many, many, players who are clearly bots that I report, then add as friends to see if anything happened.. alot of them still play lol 
---
Ah yes. Bird hat on dragonhide. The classic. That's how I look right now too
---
It‚Äôs not that deep bro 
---
They are damn close I‚Äôm sure
---
Okay but what do you think about context? :thinking:
---
Trying to make bond in f2p, currently buying eye of newt and rune packs and reselling at grand exchange......so hopeless lol

Those OG ratchet and clank sounds tho

barbarian ass salt
---
Well if you get him to spawn near Italy rock and use chinchompas you might have a better time with healers. I did it at 85 range actually started fight with addy darts so killed him to healers  spawn swapped to chins for a bit then safe spotted. Killed healers swapped darts to dragon darts. Then I cleared the last healer that got hung then him. 
---
Yeah i do

Ya look up a app called automatic clicker it will keep the game logged in

Thought you were asking about Pinocchio for a minute

Damn bro who do you think Serene is DIO?

When I do that I just get this message "For that rule you can only report players who have spoken or traded recently"

If you get a spot in the mining guild it's not terrible money considering it's such a low level ore and it's less time to bank than it is to drop 
---
rs3 will remember that.
---
He wants the series to end, tbh. He had no reason to up the pay-out to 150m. He's only been genuinely targeted, like once, and spends most of his time welfare grinding on-edge in mostly empty worlds. It's gotta get old.
---
Wouldn't this mean that vorkath is ~4m gp/h? I mean... 1k kills means it's 200k per kill... If you assume 3mins per kill, that makes 4m
---
Y tu
---
Why wouldn't you immediately insure it after getting it

Is there a ba cc that isn‚Äôt some expensive leeching service that is just for finding teammates with at least half a brain?

Sure is. Happened while I was stealing from cake stalls a couple weeks ago. 
---
Oh man that sucks. I always wondered exactly how that scam worked, so a few days ago I tried it and realized this is exactly what they do. I can see myself falling for that if I'm not paying attention. 
---
All I'd add to this is finish all the F2P quests first. Then jump right in, makes the game 100x better

if you don't have this type of banter with your friends, are they really your friends?

Kebos?

Are you trying to one up /u/_Serene_ ?

It's a more consistent method of catching sharks, but it's not nearly as AFK. The fishing pools move around the platform in 15 second intervals. Sometimes the pools have flying fish that pop up and eat 20 of your minnows each second if you're not paying attention.
---
After killing the gorillas you should be able to go to the crash site in the northern part of the stronghold with nieve following you.

People were banned for using it, it counted as a third party client

I think they meant after tutorial island where people can burn their shrimp

Gz m8 that's a hell of a grind
---
&gt; e success rates are very low unless you‚Äôre an idiot and are using a very simple / common password. ‚Äúbruit force‚Äù lmfa
---
You have no idea what you are talking about, I work in the cyber security industry..... scoff all you like but you have 0 idea what trade-offs you are talking about.
---
I use a password vault for almost all my passwords with 99+ character passwords (for example: qC8@%v0^Kci&amp;GSGr9PW%IykY&amp;$cQhhMf@904e@q^PXc6KNz@wb@j0WP^Q5oRMSLk6hFdRZ%4@T&amp;Hb752vMK!ih7Ythgy8qmBNhed) and even I know how easy these are to brute-force...... never mind how much resources that attack would take up on the OSRS login servers if it was not checked properly making for an effective DoS attack.
---
2FA, pins, unique strong passwords (15 characters of a similar context as above) and most importantly user education to spot odd activity / emails are very effective in preventing account takeovers however basic steps like account lockout are needed for services like this...... Twitter is a different ballgame as you have VIP individuals on there and its a security trade-off.
---
The inner machinations of your mind are an enigma
---
This is rs3.
---
Better idea. Move the ladder to the other side of the bank so I don‚Äôt fat finger it while training agility on mobile. 
---
Hey. That's pretty good.
---
broken clock is right twice a day
---
Nice.
---
Post this in pewdiepies submission subreddit it might get on 
---
Frugooscape and all the Dodian based servers we had back then. So sad to see the trash we have now. D:
---
Haha this is great 
---
You‚Äôre looking for r/runescape bro
---
to make it to what?
---
Here‚Äôs something that worked for me.
---
The range attack comes out much much faster than the mage attack. 
---
The mage Attack is so slow you can react much easier with the nerves.
---
Switch back to range after every mage Attack automatically. Then you literally just default are set for the range ones and the mage ones you have all the time in the world to react to.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know I wanted this, also why is runelite able to do things so fast but  when it comes to jagex it‚Äôs ‚Äúengine work‚Äù ???
---
I had a lot time off in lieu due to working events and extra hours, add that to only taking like 1 week off during the year and you suddenly realise there's more time to take than available.
---
Pretty sure the standard is over 20 days tho. 
---
Lovakengj is ass. That is all.
---
Yes. You have arrived.
---
Snotty little brat.

We would go to our friends house and charge it to the phone bill, we would have 30 days before we would get our asses beat lmao

Does this actually matter at all

How do you know if something is noted?

There was the guy that was hacking accounts, and then if I remember correctly there was something about a mod being fired and a Corp immunity glitch that was abused for heaps of gp, not sure if that was ever confirmed to be him though

i been wanting this for a while. looks clean

Nobody ever claimed this was good parenting, homie.

Kinda curious if anyone used an online timer for the 15 sec interval. I found one on YouTube, but it was only for 40 min.

Is your rsn Welsh?

been grinding to 91 fishing with 2 ticking and i got  7 atm only 82 fishing so far.

Please make a pull request on github 
---
So jagex DOESNT hide polls? 
---
Funny, I also got 68 mining as the last requirement for ds2 and hit 1600 total the same time like a week ago
---
At your level he had his mom's credit card lol
---
Yes, but I don't think this is a healthy long term solution for those people, hence the "bad taste" part of it. Even if the streamer "knows them" it's still very much a one-way relationship which they may not fully realize
---
I like how it is because I hate myself

If would look better if you dident skip leg day then you can really call yourself an iron man

I'm assuming individual, aka when you get a plow you are picking up the most expensive items first.
---
Do you have a good idea to differentiate them? 
---
The other guy said square brackets to make it different from item names that have parentheses but I think square brackets to differentiate stacks is better.
---
Noted items could keep the current brackets

Like 3000 def xp, and maybe 20k attack? Just do all attack and def xp quests before you train. This is why some people don't make zerks, it takes some planning and patience.
---
RuneLite's Git blog says this is too OP to be released. There's been a few of these now. 
---
I want this to be the top comment 
---
I‚Äôm a total noob but why is 95 Slayer a huge deal? I know 99 SpYer is a big deal, but why 95? Is there a backstory to this? I just saw a guy at the GE with a Slayer Cape today actually. Tried to ask him to emote but he ignored me lol
---
I wouldn't say it's a one-way relationship, this isn't B0aty we're talking about. (Referring to him having so many donations/comments that he has no other option than to breeze through them and read/respond as quickly as possible) With Ayiza's stream he reads and replies to every single comment in detail, and him doing pretty afk slayer has helped that a lot. I'd say that the "relationship" is pretty two-way. Through me typing in chat and him replying on stream we've had whole conversations, as have dozens of other viewers. Due to the fact that his stream is fairly small in comparison to all the other big runescape streamers, he genuinely does have two-way relationships with his viewers, as he's able to remember details about the majority of them and recall them days later.
---
It's a third party open source client with various plugins, google it for better info. There's no reason why you'd need to make a new OSRS account to use it; it's not a separate game, just a different way of displaying the existing game.
---
Because it's ok if a runelite feature only works in 95% of cases, whereas jagex features need to work for everything. 
---
For example the increased render distance didn't work on some specific gpu's. If it was a jagex feature then that would be enough for the entire update to not get shipped.
---
Plus runelite has way more people working on it than jagex :p
---
Guy had shared it and just not really told anyone because guy's very shy and generally avoids the limelight. :)
---
So, just for my own understanding, would take raw shark (13) take all of them or 1 at a time still?
---
Badass dude!
---
&gt; The runelite plugins are written client side so it takes the information from the server and changes it before we see it and I imagine when jagex wants to make changes they want to change it server side so it comes to the client that way. Atleast this is how I think it works, dont quote me on it.
---
why waste time doing kingdom, u could make way more gold every week by just doing some flipping

Every weekend is double xp weekend according to facebook ads

---
See ya back here in less than a week. No one actually quits runescape
---
I thought 2t fishing was done with trout and salmon
---
Happy cake day 
---
I guess I should clarify that's it's a one-way relationship in that you only "hang out" when he wants to, so to speak. He turns on the stream, you come keep him company. If he just stops streaming then there you (or whoever) is alone again.
---
I recognize this guy. It's CowkillMcgee. Best cow killer on this side of Gielinor; the moment he crossed the River Lum and saw those magnificent bovines, he found his passion in life. He slaughtered them by the thousands, buried the bones, took the hides and sold them. 
---
One time someone even started a fire in the cow pens! It was a really exciting day, he cooked like 8 meat! 
---
He dabbled in tanning the hides and selling leather gloves once, but unfortunately the demand wasn't as big for his handmade products and he closed down shop pretty quick. After going back to his cowhide roots and making his fortune, he decided to wander the world and find new, more challenging bovines to slay. 
---
The minotaurs in the Stronghold of Security gave him some trouble early on, but he got an Oak Longbow from the archery shop in Varrock and stayed there many a long night using their own iron arrows against them. Eventually, he emerged triumphant.
---
He's currently stocking up for his next expedition. He's heard interesting things about the Tower of Life...
---
No, dragon armour other than the boots are essentially cosmetics

Okay thank goodness...

I hope in the intermittent period between that job and securing your next job you're supposed to be on call support so you can just not do it.

How can i install this plugin?

Just tell me what date and time and where, I‚Äôll be there ;)

It would just increase the price of iron and coal.

Nobody is going to vote for it, even of you tell them all that lol. We need a new model.

Well considering I had literally just accepted my salary 2 months earlier it would have been nice to know I would be expected to be on call during negotiations.  But I mean who needs all the info when discussing job requirements and how you would like to be compensated amiright?

Sometimes people make mistakes, my dude.
---
The only places it‚Äôs actually BiS is Vorkath, Corp and chinning.
---
May also be used for zulrah and CoX, or against any low-defence enemy off slayer tasks.

How do you get the drift nets?
---
I'll give 10 lobsters and 8 tuna if you complete my 3rd grade math homework. 
---
You're under the assumption the person trying to bruteforce the account can't just start attempting again right after the lockout is lifted, which if it's a targeted attack, they will.
---
I forgot about barb fishing, the list literally goes off the screen there so this could be quite handy
---
You just gotta pray you get the gloves first or else it‚Äôll take forever
---
Ill do it we are this desperate at this time
---
Then don't take 7, only take a few.
---
Yep, havent been able to for a while now.

I hated defender when I got a torso ages ago, but I had no idea how to do it efficiently. I watched a video on it and once you know the drop spots and mechanics it doesn‚Äôt seem too bad.

How long did 85-99 take you? 
---
My lord, is that legal?
---
A client is about 550px tall or something, so 1650+ px should cut it.
---
Any updates on the skill icon sweatshirts?

Should have been low alch hehe
---
There might even be an extra tuna for you in the future if it's done within 20 min. 
---
K sir pm me
---
No lol 
---
Love this one
---
When I got torso I had bad teams the first few days I tried it, finally went back and found a good team and we knocked it out it one long session. Quick queens means everything.
---
Occult definitely. Seers, no.
---
You can try with mantas, sure. When you get more comfortable try dropping down to sharks instead cos I think they're better value for money. 
---
And fun fact: at 88hp anglers would heal you 16. That could be the reason you kept running out of food!

My only thought was what if you just wanted to pick up 2 sharks? 
---
WOULD YOU SHUT IT
---
Maybe they can just see themselves dying in the future and wanted to be prepared for it now
---
Nice haul, fuck yeah!
---
For one, maybe he's not looking to get banned. If you want to spend money on RS, go have fun with rs3. 
---
Yes it's definitely true you could do Zulrah or Vorkath for the same time each day and make more money but low level players who've only just hit 32 farming or just have the requirements for easy Varrock diaries aren't going to be able to do either.
---
Also while gold and time are resources, so is attention. If you just want to chill out and watch a movie while paying little attention to rs, if you haven't done a decent number of kills you won't be able to not pay attention. So while Vorkath/Zulrah is a great idea, it's definitely doesn't work in every situation for every person, this allows lower level people to be free to play members.
---
You'd have an awful difficult time implementing the fake gear and enemy though, I gotten l guarantee this was a private server, you even see stuff like this to this day

Is this reasonably doable on mobile? Or is a mouse necessary for good rates?

I thought it said "Take Sprite" and I was like hell yeah but this is cool too I guess
---
the first thing most people do is walk across a bridge and go start clapping some green cheeks, so it's understandable
---
Nice
---
Yeah they only take coins so you have to liquidate your bank essentially.  And they will give you an exchange rate up front.  Before the trade just ask what their rate from RS3 to OSRS is.  7:1 will mean 7m RS3 and they will give you 1m OSRS.  They won't take a cut out of that rate, you will get 1m OSRS for your 7m RS3.  It's just that the rates between games are different, in their favor.  For example: Their OSRS to RS3 swap rate might be 1:5.  1m OSRS for 5m RS3.  So swapping 7m to OSRS, then back to RS3 will net them 2m profit.  That's how they make money.  Their cut is built into the rates.  And if you're wondering who has the best rate, I honestly don't know.  I would just go with someone you can trust and eat the small premium for a guaranteed successful swap.
---
AFAIK they could have changed it but the best of luck!
---
Thanks
---
Thank you u/frogfucker17 very cool!
---
Sad
---
Just wanted to keep the awareness out there (especially for n00bs and kids), don't go clicking on these streams. And to everyone else, please go report them. It's not just a OSRS problem, but it does directly impact the integrity of the game, unfortunately - and from what I've read over on /r/twitch it doesn't look like Twitch cares.

Cool!

Unless your task is undead. Then combined with salve (ei). That should be better than slayer helmet

Thanks man, attempt 3 is in the works, just taking breaks every 10-15 waves
---
Does anyone know the cc for paying people to do it, and what's the running rate for torso like 4m?
---
Yeah, that would be nice
---
Funnily as well, the second top stream in the pic is also a scam.

I recommend focusing on offensive gear for slayer. You'll get more XP, and slayer is already a very slow skill.

If you want to make your trips last longer, bring prayer potions and learn to prayer flick.

Luckily it was only a months worth of gp and not a years or more. Learn from mistakes now when they could be worse later. Hopefully you didn‚Äôt buy bonds and got that money stolen, but either way, you‚Äôre a higher lvl now so money will come in faster than a month ago

So do I have to wait for plugins to pass the audit and make it to the RL update, or can I manually go in and add this from the gitpage you're linking around? I use RL, but just started a week or two ago and have been learning all these different QOL plugs. Looks great so far. 
---
Bank pin could have saved you...
---
You can‚Äôt venom jad, and regular poison is too weak to be worth the effort. If you insist on using a cbow I‚Äôd recommend just sticking with that the whole time

Rapier is currently best in slot at almost every melee scenario. Its now just losing its vorkath (assuming you are using melee), rune  dragons, and raids 1 spots. Still best in most general use boss/slayer tasks. Should be pretty stable with the lance.

When I think of fighter torso, I think of Spongebob telling himself he doesn't need the water. Same for Void.

In RuneLite, search for the plugin resize, there is some modifier to scale UI

Void isn't actually that bad and games are rarely lost now with the inactivity timer, no doubt takes ages though

Well shit, sign me up.

Cheated in his own RuneScape competition. 
---
OldfkschoolRS... Should be a dead giveaway
---
I can‚Äôt see them building a slayer wep that they said the boss is mid tier being better then a raids wep. That said I think it‚Äôs being made to be a melee solution so range isn‚Äôt always the meta. DHCB will raises and then balance out after hype.
---
25 q  p
---
He said
---
&gt;
---
All this does is show you how many there are, after you click Shark [7] you'll pick up a single shark, and when you right click again it'll say Shark [6].
---
I guess we‚Äôll have to wait and see haha, I don‚Äôt see how a boss requiring 95 slayer could be mid tier 
---
jagex pls listen
---
Its just another flawed feature of the game, unfortunately.
---
Cannon will speed up tasks resulting in faster xp.
---
And just to nitpick a bit as well, once this new boss is added 95 Slayer is the highest level requirement in the skill so it essentially is equivical to 99 aside from the skillcape. Slayer isn't one of those skills like fishing where the level influences exp rates so it's basically the same.
---
Should I do wildy tasks or normals?
---
I heard somewhere that it has the same rate as seers village as far as fail rate I just can't recall where.
---
And it was glorious
---
Garbage gp/hr and xp/hr. There's no reason to not skip them unless you're a btw.
---
Just take my upvote you savage alpha. 
---
Was it TheOnyxKing
---
Definitely not in terms of revenue.
---
For the imbued Zamorak cape. Is it like a fire cape where I can repair it if I die in the wild but will lose it after level 20 or do I lose it either way? I can‚Äôt seem to find a straight answer on this online. Also how about if I use it in the pvp worlds? Is it lost? Thanks
---
So this can only be done in pvp worlds then?
---
HA! GAAAY
---
Eh, didn't help that I went to Pest Control after 20 solid hours of Canifis roof tops for full graceful, which came after getting the looting bag in MLM in one trip......I'm unwinding the grind by making pineapple pizzas from scratch.
---
Gl with that
---
I‚Äôll see if I‚Äôm able to later tonight when I get home, but honestly if you don‚Äôt want to go through this hassle then you don‚Äôt have to do anything lol. Honesty shocked you‚Äôre doing so much for a random other player!
---
Idk 1 person always getting pid or some shit
---
Have any idea how you were hacked? Phished? Cracked? 
---
I have contemplated on getting a small ironman logo tattoo'd on me. Since I have playes RS for 13 years on and off the game means a lot to me and is a big part of my life. Seeing this made me want to get it for sure now. It looks great, artist did a nice clean job!
---
2.5t barb requires an alt to bank + grab karambwans + trade them to you. All while you're doing click intensive tick manipulation lol
---
Cannoning tasks is always faster. Once you get higher level you can burst/barrage tasks in multi areas (nechs/dust devils in catacombs). Wildy slayer is just another way of boosting points.
---
Yep
---
mute the video and open hotline bling on spotify
---
Thank you so much. I need to keep composed but it so hard after 62 waves of repetitive clicking. The real challenge is Jad nothing else. Thanks for the advice!

Can someone explain what happened.
---
Runelite gets shut down I'm quitting this game.
---
Thanks for this! I actually have all the materials minus several thousand gold ore but knowing this I feel better about doing it! 
---
As shit as defender is, I kind of prefer playing it because at least I have some idea what to do. When you play with randoms it seems like you occasionally get someone amazing at it but mostly get utter trash that makes the rounds run twice as long.
---
hows life without your nsfw tumblr bro
---
i think the item pics are a bit too small. i can't even tell what some of them are
---
Menu entry swapper plugin on runelite makes it so certain npcs have trade as their left click option rather than on ‚Äòtalk to‚Äô option.  I forgot I had it enabled, so I spent quite a while trying to trade with Ava rather than selecting the talk to option. You must complete the quest that I was trying to start in order to trade with her. 
---
I‚Äôd nut in it 
---
This is better than the 99 Cooking Skill Cape emote....
---
How would you show the difference between noted sharks and normal sharks? 
---
Yeah, I can confirm you still fail it at 64 agility since I fell off with a pie applied
---
Sick cover up

The only way to trustfully buy an account is via irl and knowing the person/persons house. Anything online is a straight up scam. I once sold my rs account many years ago since I was quitting. Gave the details and never received any money although they had a PayPal link. I checked  account and the password was changed, didn‚Äôt care since I quit anyway but yea. It‚Äôs all a scam 
---
hello fellow singaporean

And there are still people camping Zamorak mage to kill runecrafters for their glory and me getting gangbanged by 11 lvl110s at Venenatis for my glory and a handful of food because they cba to do shit like rfd and other quests to make their way to vorkat
---
Dragons 
---
This guy is legit I have used him before
---
There's been a few ideas here, from literally putting the word "noted" in the option to using x10 instead of [10]. I'll just have to play around and see what works well really
---
I got one while cannoning dgaanoths...
---
Don't merch based on me, but I think it's already crashed as much as it's going to due to the update. It's already been known for a while that lance beats rapier on dragons. Maybe if lance turns out to be super expensive when people thought it would be cheap, rapier will rise, or vice versa. Strictly in terms of people buying/selling based on what's bis though, the market has already had time to adjust.
---
It's not the best money - but it's consistent and a task like gargs will make you 800k+ an hour
---
ill suicide in less than 20 wildy and above to pvm. ill check back in a bit
---
Lovakengj is the big gay
---
Don't do it; you'll get banned, recovered, or more likely both. If you just want to skip straight to pvm you can put in a paltry dozen hours of questing and then nmz to max combat while reading some books.
---
It‚Äôs just really weird. I spent a lot of time on that site over the last 4 years. I wasn‚Äôt a big shot or anything but I had 1,400 followers on there and just seeing all of that go to waste is like. Crap. Rebuilding too has been trash but overall just trying to expand where I am so if one thing goes to shit it‚Äôs not as bad. Thanks for asking. I‚Äôm gonna try and do more osrs stuff because it‚Äôs seems to be what people enjoy more atm.
---
god you are such a fucking loser

Cool! Sounds great. Keep it up! We love you

You can do any combination of attack and strength that you want as long as you stay ranged based. I'd get 50 attack 90+ strength just for fun if I were you.

BROOOO i did the same thing with speaking to toe foreman for my fremmy hard diaries early. created a post and facepalmed two seconds after i created it realizing what i did. immediately deleted post lmao

I made sure I wouldn't die (unless I disconnect!) Had like 30 or so kills left

Sadly if you're solely looking for money makers mining isn't very profitable. I do recommend watching a YouTube guide for making money at lower levels. 
---
Dont want to die? wtf what are you
---

---
Gold bars-&gt;Amulets.
---
Crafting generally isn't a profitable skill, it'll cost you money to level except for extremely slow methods like bowstrings and gold bars-&gt;amulets (people use them for string jewellery training magic).
---
Every day, we stray further from Saradomin.
---
That‚Äôs the new slayer master
---
Who is Nieve? 
---
Ayiza is a cooler friend than you'll ever have tho
---
Yeah that's how it works.  Its tough to boost more than a level or two but for just one kill it should be fine.
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll give this a try for a while.
---
Sounds like a simple fun gimmick, but it would probably end up being   a massive job for the dev team. They would have to go through every instance a regular hammer is used and configure it with the dwh. 
---
I was at a party last week and decided to do an herb run on my phone and it was an icebreaker with a girl who was looking at what I was doing
---
"omg I remember my brother playing that game!!!" boom, done. 
---
me when i see the xp drops at zmi
---
that anatomy is really poor
---
It will be easier to make a low level pure. You would be fighting people with much higher combat stats. If you don‚Äôt want to do that you could prob going a rev pking cc.

Other than OSRS and WoW, what other games have Old School versions of their main games, and how successful are they?
---
Serp helm is ideally used for only melee because it gives negative bonuses to other combat styles. It's only used at Challenge Mode raids and Theatre of Blood and even then it's a minor role.
---
Lol so true 
---
Cake makes it seem like you got irl pked lol. Like its over
---
missed dialogue steps in the quest happened 2 me once
---
No but I can double your gp
---
Didn't know that, interesting. The 7 levels at fishing guild probably make it more worthwhile for those who have 2 accounts though. Haven't seen the rats at Pisc so hard for me to compare.
---
I got 4k I can trade tomorrow 
---
What about the god wars or dks?
---
Read a couple of his other comments, I'm not sure he's a native speaker.
---
9 mil isn't that much money.
---
pre sure u have to ask that guy in the house with book everything on his options
---
he got his team to stockpile brimhaven tickets to inflate their EHP weeks for the competition
---
The game already does that??
---
Full bandos &amp; obby cape 
---
My first thought exactly lmao
---
This crashed my fucking phone twice 
---
Better off waiting until you get a task (greater demons, aviansies, dagannoths) for those to use Slayer Helmet or there's better helmets out there like Justiciar and Fighter Hat (for Bandos) and Arma Helm (for Bandos and Sara). People only usually use Serp Helm if the Venom effect and/or poison protection are useful enough to outweigh the loss in DPS if you mage/range with it, which it usually isn't.
---
Do it  big puss
---
The brine saber is slightly better than rune scimmy and the price is up from mobile.
---
+2 strength and +2 slash
---
I've been doing every brine rat task I get since mobile lol
---
U hav smol penor
---
Does anyone know what's more efficient for training Woodcutting and Fletching in tandem? I cut my own logs and fletch them, so I'm wondering if it's more efficient to cut/fletch yews and turn them into longbows, or if magic logs/longbows is faster.
---
Thanks!
---
no

This is genius.

I downloaded TOS about a few days after osrs mobile came out and sure enough I got hacked and lost my bank about 300k..

It's the equivalent to the "Why Fletch??" from Wintertodt. 
---
I cannot offer you friendship but we can add each other and i promise to turn private off the second you log on to avoid any social interaction.
---
It was going for 140-145m for a couple hours on both friday and saturday. Also a very highly merched item and yes it will crash. probably back down to its 120m price point once were a month out from hydra and its drops are being brought into the game
---
Support only if the original unmodified cwars stays available. Theres a small but hardcore group of cwars players and it'd be shitty to mess up their game 
---
This is tight as hell but out of everything I‚Äôm surprised he picked Torag hammers lol
---
By mid teir the boss is slightly harder than cerb apparently and cerb is not all that difficult
---
You won‚Äôt get a true account for that price... if you want a good account you gotta figure out if they have no email accounts they are the true non scammers but it‚Äôll cost you 
---
ouch, how does this happen tho?
---
Yews are far more efficient because Magics are too slow to ever be viable.
---
so if you click just one will it take all the items for example like would it take 7 sharks at once? that'd be epic
---
Ive been in the CC for an hour now and its just getting worse, more BAs looking for pheonix
---
Why be upsetti when you got spaghetti 
---
The brine sabre is better than rune scim. You could always just sell back the brine sabre to help afford the hammer.
---
The best way to reignite interest is to stop doing it so often. The novelty is gone
---
They should do more things like king of the skill, maybe do quest speedrun contests, big duel tournaments, competitive castle wars events, etc. 
---
He used the lowest level slayer master. 
---
yeah I know close to 500 myself but lowest lvl master doesn't give any points?
---
Turael doesn't break your task streak unless you use him to skip a task... Just doing a task with him will never reset your streak. People totally do use him to boost points.
---
I'm talking about rs3.
---
better yet reach out to them and get their collective feedback on ways to improve it before turning it into a more professional scene.
---
I imagine your like level 85 at best lol
---
It is, sitting on [420 points](https://i.imgur.com/f5vit1p.png).
---
RS3 is irrelevant. Turael does not break your streak. OP used turael, not the canifis master. Nothing you said makes any sense. Hello?
---
&gt;Question 18
---
&gt;If Konar is added to the game, should killing monsters whilst on a task from **him** give you a chance to hit an additional loot table that includes the tradeable 1-handed Dragon hasta?
---
&gt;Yes 88.5% (46949 votes)
---
oops
---
Fuck you guy, I was like 12 at the time. How else would you sell an account you don‚Äôt want anymore? You go to a fucking shitty website 
---
brine sabre is better only only slightly, its debatable whether the extra cost is worth it. You could just sell it after youre done with it though. Aim for dragon scim and dragon defender. 
---
Yes officer here he is, yes his name is Spencer.
---
Me, an intellectual:

Get accounts to level 6 combat level by magic and hunt looting bots on f2p wild pk.
---
Hello fellow weslman 
---
I hope you appealed it, this gets punishment but you still see rampant advertisers in f2p AND p2p? Sounds legit
---
Disregarding all the stuff about irl and whatnot, ultimately what is the problem with sucking up to streamers, or helping people out with a goal, each persons goals can be reached however they want, and they can do it on their own terms, and if other people want to help out, why is that bad?
---
The person I responded to thought turael gave points, I assumed they may have mixed that up with the canifis master which does give points and that people used to boost before osrs came out. Hi.
---

---
Full Bandos, Fury, obby cape, gold d boots. Bruh
---
Absolute madman
---
Yeah because everybody should be excepted to have 2fa on every single account they have online.
---
How about putting a delay on removing the authenticator? If people are dumb why does that mean they deserve it? Jagex have the power to protect them very easily but they refuse and thats just as bad as being the scammers themselves.

then again, I was just looking for info on Nieve..
---
Trust me, I don't and never have indulged in anything shady. I'll take your advice though. thank you
---
Why do we want them hidden?
---
They said they'd have to look at each use case for a hammer and then rewrite all of them to include DWH. Definately not worth the dev time.
---
That 7 day removal thing makes it so pointless...
---
Oh well. Thanks.
---
not a virgin i fuckex ur mom

Happening to me too.

When you make these kind of posts, you basically guarantee this dude loses his name, and probably the ability to name swap for a period of time. It's just a dick move. 
---
I can relate to none of those.
---
Just hire skinnier people 
---
The fuck, all of OSRS Wiki redirects me to Nieve I can't do shit without this site :-( 
---
Even googled Snape Grass and was redirected to a Nieve page, also the Recipe for disaster quest guide redirects to Nieve site. 
---
If you want to go deeper than edge you need protection prayers, and then the cb levels put you at a disadvantage at edge, it balances out at higher cb. But I do not regret getting prayer in my baby pure since I enjoy green dragons ect much more than the gmaul prodding in edge.
---
Although If you enjoy edge wait until you've got 85 magic/ high range before getting prayer 
---
Im like 95% straight.

It's not really pointless in case you forget it.  If you don't log in for 9 months, you should have had adequate security in place before hand.

"Hello and welcome to my guide"

Wow what was he trying to do there. Like it looked like he wanted to switch back agro but didn't realise the other player needs to attack the boss for that to happen. But you'd think some where before the end of the clip he'd notice it wasn't working.

He reminds me a bit of [this rabbit ](https://youtu.be/lAKPZkiq970)

Why would you regret a tattoo like this? It‚Äôs subtle, small and on his ankle. It symbolizes something that‚Äôs a big part of his life, and it doesn‚Äôt scream nerdy to anyone who doesn‚Äôt play RuneScape. Really rad tattoo if you ask me.

They said it will be comparable to falconing kebbits but on the water, so not very afk.

Where does it say in runelite

Ah you're right mb. But yeah pretty sure DCB is better than blowpipe by itself.

Hi Papa_Senpai!

i use google search bar for auto completes. I shouldn't have to use the terrible wiki search. Jagex should promote their own wiki better

Hi DocSneezey!
---
Search rankings are determined by people clicking through the site from Google and other factors too. The rankings won‚Äôt improve unless people stop using Wikia because they have had a lot of years of high ranking.
---
I know it‚Äôs annoying, we find it annoying too, but it isn‚Äôt something as simple as ‚Äútake down the old wiki‚Äù (Wikia won‚Äôt let us) or ‚Äújust fix your SEO‚Äù (our SEO is fine).
---
&gt; I do not wish to die
---
/r/absolutelynot2meirl4meirl
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the wiki search? If there‚Äôs something you think it should do that it doesn‚Äôt then let me know, but for the most part you type something in and get to the page you want.
---
I made a post shortly after you, it's doing the same thing for me.
---
They have to manually approve that they want the idea at all. E.g. they could decide it is OP, or just not something worth including.
---
Then they have to actually go through the code in one of these pull requests. This would involve testing, code review, etc.
---
Finally they'd merge that code into the main code (called the Master branch).
---
Then the update would go out with the next release of runelite.
---
You could build it yourself locally, but you're gonna struggle unless you're familiar with Java development and have used an IDE before.

Nah he only got to raking her weeds

Dude, there is even a record for the first person to be in a car accident when cars were invented.

Basically anything "first" can be a record in Guinness books.

That‚Äôs down to Google not indexing those pages, Google has a set quota of pages to index regularly and we‚Äôve got a lot of pages that it needs to get through, so some things don‚Äôt show up yet.
---
It isn‚Äôt an issue with SEO, it‚Äôs an issue with Google not crawling those pages yet. We regularly check Google‚Äôs search console and for pages that are indexed, they‚Äôre high in results, but for those that aren‚Äôt - you obviously won‚Äôt see them.

idk why but this problem occured to me just now too

Wait was song is this once it gets to not sea shanty 2?

Most modern browsers will let you add the wiki as a search engine to use in your URL bar.
---
We have info about this here: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Finding_the_wikis_with_ease
---
This is ridiculous. All the gambling bots and scammers at the GE but people get muted for saying naughty words 
---
The new wiki honestly looks awful. Any chance it will eventually look like the previous wiki?
---
Yet another fake clip from GingerBeardie... SMH

What a petty thing to destroy one's reputation over, although I haven't heard him talk about this at all so maybe there's some details I'm missing
---
Were you dared to tattoo a dick on your ankle?
---
Can you expand on that? If you prefer the fixed width layout of Wikia, you can click the cog at the top right of the wiki to turn on 'Reader mode' which emulates that. There's also a dark mode.
---
Most of them that do have a guild to teleport you there.. I think the only one that doesn‚Äôt is magic.

Wait people need Phoenix members?
---
That seems so backwards, because Phoenix is the gang you can join alone, but Black arms you NEED a pheonix member to join it.

Back in the day, it was always Phoenix members having trouble finding Black Arms members, why is reversed now?

God bless

The Old School RuneScape Wiki has moved to an independent site. As a result, the old version is no longer actively maintained. **Please edit your comment with the new link:**

For more information, see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9kqum1/).

Probably because he‚Äôs trying to smash.

He said he on his Crystalmathlabs profile that there will be a social media return on ‚ÄúQ3 19‚Äù
---
Not everyone has a long bone, don't shame him for it! :(
---
Also I find it very hard to believe that the wiki is rampantly linking to Nieve because of "Vandalism"
---
Osrssoa
---
I was very interested in DDM but clans put me off it. Don't feel like getting jumped by 10+ players as soon as I enter multi for 2 seconds and don't feel it would be fun to be one of the 10+ players jumping a solo. Maybe as a noob it's just my inexperience or paranoia that puts me off. 
---
Are you saying the elite boots take you farther than getting kicked off?

Same for me. Some time it reloads it correctly when i refresh the Nieve page. Other times it doesnt and have to go through google to get to the page.
---
I thought it was maybe an anniversary of some sort for her haha.

Just use the new wiki ffs. How is it easier to open a cached page than it is to just use the new wiki

Can‚Äôt see the zuhaar part of photo when scrolling on mobile. Maybe fix it and you‚Äôll get some more traction with this meme. Best of luck.

Everyone uses Garyshood lol.

If you're defending these people, you fit perfectly in the same category as I previously described.
---
"Fun" isn't something one considers while playing RuneScape. But this... does put a smile on my face.
---
I doubt the game even tracks those things
---
It's 99.999% viewbots and like 3 suckers. So not quite the true #1 vid with 1k+ "viewers".

I mean you being a dumb motherfucker is a well documented fact. why else do you think people hate your stupid ass? you prove yourself time and time again to be a dumb motherfucker and that's why people downvote you. get a grip on life man, and stop living in a fantasy world where you're always right 
---
This title is exactly my thoughts lol
---
&gt; and unironically calls people sheep.
---
Weird concept huh when every person throws around baseless insults without being aware of why they're contributing to the hateful narrative in the first place
---
Tbh that is a sick imagination of full dragon. I like the full helm now, but this would‚Äôve been amazing. I wish newer updates and imaginations worked like this and stayed true to the old art style instead of the more RS3 look. I don‚Äôt dislike the new stuff, I‚Äôd just prefer it looked old and ‚Äúcrappy‚Äù like the classic stuff did lol.
---
Nice try, autist!
---
It's still buggy as fuck though
---
What makes you say this?
---
False. Update your perception before engaging!
---
I have said the worst and most racist shit in game to test the boundaries, multiple times, all my accounts still have a clean slate.
---
Out of genuine curiosity I looked up bonds, and they're selling for 3,000,000 gp and cost $7. So 420,000,000 gp would require selling 140 bonds, which would cost $979. Assuming an 8 hour work day, he'd need to be earning a little over $61 an hour, which would mean he'd be earning at least 6 figures. But his logic is stupid regardless. Some people enjoy playing Runescape and *earning* their fat stacks, instead of buying their wealth with their real money which probably has better uses.
---
Don't project onto me, that's disgusting.

Hi I_Swear_Im_Sober!

Hi gijsro!
---
same is happening to me came on here to find out.
---
After what happened with the Max Cape, I'll pass...
---
Yeah, was wondering about this as well. Just because a large portion of people are using a new wiki doesn't justify vandalizing the old one imo. It's childish as fuck. Not everyone wants to or has to use the new one. Frankly, I am not even sure why the "migration" took place. The old wiki has never done me any wrong. It has always worked and continues to work for me (except when children deface it)
---
No, I responded to the guy bringing up this nonsense https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/acftyd/whats_is_up_with_this_dude/ed81sj3/

Then you derailed it into even further idiocy

The automod just commented saying the wiki moved to a new Domain?
---
I can always count on the Reddit community to be as helpful as an ashtray on a motorbike. 
---
I did this yesterday also, for the exact same reasons. 
---
Finish pisc first!! You should be at 30pc after queen of thieves. From there just bucket worms to 100pc. Takes about half an hour.
---
Then do hosidius using the plough to 5pc, then make compost all the way to 100pc. Takes just under an hour. 
---
Awful teammates. When I got my torso, it took me 6 hours to get my first queen kill. People would stick around until waves 6-8, get bored and leave forever. We hit wave 9 and said fuck it, let's not reset and advertised in the wave 9 room. We had to give up after an hour even though we were accepting all roles.
---
Found the immature highschooler.
---
I believe so. 
---
why did you forget smithing, you bastard :(
---
It doesn't matter. If someone can't take criticism they don't really do anything important or do anything long enough. Any experienced dev/artist takes criticism well, it's just you shouldn't expect these kind of people usually be in a sub like this. 
---
Is this on RuneLite automatically, or do we have to add it manually? If so how do we do that üò¨

It won't track lifetime since it would have no data to pull, only kills from the point rl gets that tracker.

Remember when 2007scape was that server that stole everyone's money and took off with it. I think that's what finally pushed jagex to make osrs

Actually love the idea behind it. My gf hates tattoos and would definitely leave me if I got this one though.

Imagine using the old wiki in 2019
---
Yeah why does every item need an Examine option 
---
Yeh can cook them.
---
Shut up Serene alt
---
I'd spend my time getting f2p skills up, get most quests done and then get member. Going soley for money making in f2p to buy a bond is gonna leave a lot to be desired.
---
Then why not have that? A session killcount would be pretty cool.
---
If they're bruteforcing an account without a lockout then they can use a computer to create X number of login attempt variations a second (depending on power of computers, servers, network connection, etc.) using an automated programme which keeps going until it cracks the password.
---
If an account gets locked out after 5 failed attempts then it gives a massive protection to this type of attack as it requires a manual process to unlock it and carry on bruteforcing, also after unlocking it you only get another 5 attempts before it get locked again, and likely, I would imagine after so many unlocks in a certain time they will start to the ignore the unlock requests.
---
The only reason OP got hacked was because of human error (getting phished after the account lockout). Had the automatic lockout not been there then they could've used his email (which they knew already) and kept attempting to bruteforce his password.
---
Could even lock it behind an elite diary where you get an increased yield in mining, fishing, woodcutting, etc. kind of like runecraft where you can double runes at higher levels. 
---
Clickbait title, 11minutes
---
That's a link to the old wiki which has been heavily vandalized
---
Hi jonasfull123!

It seems like "5% chance to mine two Dense essence blocks at once" would increase the exprate no?

Guessing this was with a tbow?
---
Runelite, April fools ain't for another couple of months
---
Well when the Devs say there is a reason they aren't doing it because of the states from darts, chances are it isn't as simple as you think.
---
As a new player with a little bad luck, it could be harsh. Most full rune with a rune scim at least, or 40-50 ranged. Bring a ton of high lvl food for the final fight.
---
&gt;is a well documented fact
---
If you believe an irrational hivemind promoting a bullying campaign with the use of a flawed point system, you're seriously delusional and impressionable. People created harassment accounts to spam my notifications and get people onto the hatetrain due to my post frequency/certain opinions. If you're part and endorse this behavbiour, you're totally braindead and should stop engaging.
---
You're part of this group, and will likely apologize some day when you change your own naive reprehensible attitude.
---
Isn‚Äôt it 1/15 rate? Seems a bit lucky 
---
Christ that sucks
---
Looks like an iPhone with an advanced lock screen
---
It's not broken - somebody has been editing all the pages individually to redirect to the Nieve page. They're editing ~75 pages each minute and it looks like they're still going.
---
But yeah use the oldschool.runescape.wiki link from now on for your 'scaping needs.
---
Engine work nty
---
Oh, wow, you're absolutely right. I skimmed over the rewards and didn't notice. That's definitely a little helpful.
---
Yes

I dislike you more every day

Lol youre joking right
---
Exactly this man, sucks
---
yeah it's jagex fault not at all yours
---
okay.
---
I'm already slaying away! I don't know how they got my account, but i have taken every step i can to prevent it happening again. 
---
when will this be available?
---
Not an argument nor an answer. You're so exceptionally incompetent. Get lost.
---
The issue with mobile I found was having to click through the dialogue to take down the net, that'll probably reduce the overall exp per hour by 10-15 nets (770 xp fish/1015 hunter per net)
---
The boots take you slightly further away than getting kicked off lunar isle iirc but its more that you cant home teleport&gt;portal to lunar&gt;bank&gt;get kicked off all in one process anymore
---
Gem mining is great for me, completely braindead once you're in the rhythm but not interactive enough to be aids, make a decent amount of profit and it's 70k+ xp an hour.
---
Instead of a bigger couch make the other mods smaller

Of course, you can receive all of the fish pictured in my screenshot. The lower levels I discarded all of my loot because to me it wasn't worth banking and then I started to bank when I hit sharks+
---
Bless you

Untrue. Using drugs as lube is simply laughable, no one should have to resort to such measures.
---
Also, trying to normalize drugs which destroys and pollutes cities shouldn't be tolerated.
---
botter btw
---
lmao.  When I was in the military, we would ask people to name what was in our hand.  I was surprised to learn some parts of the south just call all pop "coke".  I had a buddy who explained he had to change to pop because everyone gave him the wrong thing.
---
You have a few options. Venge pking at ge/bh.
---
You can wear dharoks or the regular main set with torso nesi and rune legs. Or you can use void. There's lots of options.
---
You can also go deep wildy and learn how to bridge/nh
---
A few hours a day of sleeping or of playing?

Good luck to you too.

not sure what's your point

I though fighter hat and treasonous ring were BiS for Corp but I could be wrong

Unfortunately, I wasn't, I'm an idiot.

I remember when I joined the sub was at 87k subs. Ahh the memes were so much worse and more low effort back then.

This really made my day better, seems like I'm already at maximum effi and didn't waste crafting resources as I was about to. There really should be a toggle somewhere or make it teleport you closer to docs.
---
Oh ok so I‚Äôll just get the requirements for ELITE LUMBY DIARIES and my life will be easy like yours. 
---
Textbook man spreading, can't believe Jagex would allow such unruly behavior by their mod team!
---
With certain setups treasonous is better than b ring iirc
---
Just because someone doesn't know one thing that you think is obvious doesn't mean ''they know nothing about the game''. Fact is, it's not hard at all for a noob to have 9m.
---
Thats exactly how it works. Jagex's devs are just lazy, under-qualified, or a mix of both. The only reason this would require engine work, would be when you click an item it picks up the whole stack. However Im sure most of us wouldn't care about that. Programming isn't actually as hard as they make it seem, even if its a proprietary language.
---
The Babe is calling his shot. 
---
Tell me how a noob would make 9m other than getting lucky on a clue.
---
Casual Ba allows only lvl 5 all roles members to play and is a fun run/pet hunt cc.  
---
If hunting for torso, "Osrs Ba" is the best cc that often fills up with people hunting torso. 
---
Alternatively its possible to buy torso "boosting" from either Leech Ba  or Ba Services cc for a ridiculous price.

this fucking title, yikes

Yes, this is more accurate.  I can step outside a business and have a cigarette. I can not step out and have a joint. 
---
&gt;It seems like the kind of weapon that would just burn through money, though it‚Äôs excellent. 
---
Correct assessment. Basically anywhere you would just melee with whip you'd be better off using blowpipe so it's a good choice most places. But expensive. So if you can't afford it, it is what it is. 
---
Damn this hurts lmfao, 250th tasks are the shit

Questing. In the middle of Ratcatchers, after that probably Legends Quest.

&gt;it's a bit demeaning, for any gender

&gt;B-but ackshually it's specially (sic) bad because the IT industry is dominated by men!
---
Cringe. I'm guessing you also believe the IT industry being quote "dominated" by men has nothing to do with personal choice, either. Or maybe that there are no differences between men and women period, although that'd be a bit strange- who forms the bogeyman if this is the case?

And surely everone should just believe you? Like I've seen people stoop lower than this, and calling you out seems fair

On the off chance you're not full of shit, know that this is a comlon occurance, abd that the entire community looks down on people who buys bonds. People generally want you to play the game to earn the money yourself.

Getting "scammed" and then begging is a shit move on your part frankly, and crying "toxic" is even worse. Get bent to be honest

You can't have 2 of the same pet. The game will say "You have a funny feeling like you would have been followed..." meaning you technically got the pet again but it doesn't allow for it to happen. The reason he got 2 pets here is because they are different Dagganoth king pets

Im just back in the game and RC has grabbed my attention, specifically making money in the Abyss. Now my CB level is still quite low. What are the basic requirements to do some RC @ Abyss ( beside RC levels). Do I only need to complete the quest and have a decent CB level? At what level won't you get attacked? Do I grab food? Can it even be done &lt;100CB? How long would it take me to get all the requirements? 
---
Focus on getting your farming up for herbs. Read a guide on herb runs and try to do them routinely. You‚Äôll want to do a lot of questing when you get P2P. The most bang for your buck would be going for Varrock achievement diary requirements and start with those quests. You‚Äôll get daily discounted battlestaffs from Zaff that you can sell at the GE for a profit. These two things alone will sustain your bonds.
---
I mean it's only 5%. I wonder if, over time, it balances out with the loss of the extra mining experience, given how slow mining can be. 
---
We make pull requests on GitHub, i.e. a request to merge our changes into the master repository - the main version of the client. The guy(s) in charge discuss it and decide if it belongs or not (is it too overpowered, etc.). They may request changes and improvements.

Until that happens, I'm sorry to say the only way to use it is to build it yourself. But hey, that's not so bad!

I've no idea to be honest, last I heard it was under consideration.

Sorry if you don't like the game mode you chose, but you chose it. People are going to exploit it. That's the way the world works. If people make a petition for iron only worlds i'll sign it but I'm not going to lose sleep over iron man players getting crashed. You chose the game mode, deal with the out come.
---
I would like to complete all hard diaries and so need to kill KQ, Zulrah, Chaos Elemental, Crazy Archaeologist, Chaos Fanatic and Scorpia.  
---
I have 80 melee, 82 range, 78 mage, 84 HP and 73 prayer ( yes, 73 XD ).   
---
Which of these are viable for me, and which should I train a bit more before taking them on? (only need one kill on each, not particularly looking into camping them atm)  
---
I also have normal-ish gear, nothing too expensive, and don't want to risk too much for the wildy bosses
---
I suggest doing a little bit of blast mine every day. It will pay for bonds, the exp is solid, and your brain wont die.
---
Hi OSRSDrugsnMusic!
---
Look at the exclamation mark at the end, it indicates that this is more of a harmless and extremely funny contribution - Combined with some truth of course. Becuase yes, I'm 100% for a strict drug prohibitive state for obvious reasons. https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/abuehk/addy_med_helm/ed5cnpb/

Same mechanics as dying to Vork, just pay torfinn 100k to get your stuff back. 
---
&gt;lock it behind an elite diary
---
No, fuck that.
---
Diaryscape is awful.
---
I'll DM you, else automod will eat my links.
---
Then you're part of the issue. Make a petition for iron only worlds and I'll sign it. But if you chose the game mode and expect other players to respect you for it, you're disillusioned to the reality of the world. People can and will exploit anything they can. You chose the game mode, now you have to deal with the consequences of people exploiting you. You don't have my sympathy nor will you ever.

Dissecting jokes isn't that hard.

With that said, being strictly against drugs is a reasonable principle which any academic individual occupies. When the topic comes up, of course there's gonna be debates about the issue. Especially to change the angled pro-drug narrative which junkies on this website regularly preaches.

Well, great. Block me immediately so I won't have to witness your bs ever again. 
---
I've tried dying with these items at nechryaels ;
---
rune pouch filled with runes,
---
infinity boots,
---
book of darkness,
---
trident of the seas (158 charges),
---
karil top 25,
---
karil skirt 100,
---
barrow gloves,
---
imbued zamorak cape,
---
seers' ring (i),
---
slayer helmet (i).
---
occult amulet,
---
ancient blessing.
---
I kept all the items, except occult amulet and ancient blessing. 8 of my items shown on the list are untradeable, and 3 of them are tradeable, but why i kept only infinity boots as a tradeable item?
---
What's your stance on caffeine?
---
Well you are in certain cases, want the BIS mage cape? You have to go to wildy. And before you say hey just use normal cape, that's not really a choice for any more serious player.
---
That's what I figured. So all the grown ups moved out and the kids are essentially running the town now.

Idk what's wrong with you but being a noob doesn't stop anyone from doing farm runs. They're not hard, they don't take any significant setup, nor do they take any significant requirements.

Just keep being dumb.

Pffffff lmao
---
If you search "OSRS Wiki", the new one is the top search. But if you search something like "OSRS Bandos Boots", the old Wiki always comes out on top... every item or quest I've tried to Google. And look at all the comments here with people having zero idea that the "new wiki" was even a thing.
---
Because some of the untridable items have a higher value. It first calculated your 3 highest valued items then keeps most remaining untradables
---
But then how can I laugh when people tell you to shutup
---
Derailed again. 
---
But, people are upset about the post frequency and some opinions. So a couple of hateful users initiated a hate campaign by spamming every remark I posted. The impressionable herd jumped upon this narrative once these spam accs got banned. So now every dumbo is spreading hateful bs and insulting me because they're incapable of forming an unique thought/argument towards me.
---
The majority aren't even aware of why they're being so edgy and hateful. Totally pathetic.
---
Should get BTW tatted somewhere else .

good job strawmanning and appealing to popularity, for someone who enjoys presenting as a faux-intelligent person you sure don't know how to debate anything

how did you highlight your gear?

Of course it's personal choice. But that doesn't mean we get to treat women with disrespect just because men are the majority. I imagine male nurses have similar problems.
---
yikes.

how did you highlight your gear in your inv?

The wildy bosses are are fairly easy. You should be able to do them no problem. You should be able to manage 1 Zulrah kill assuming you have a trident and blowpipe it will just take a bit of time to stop freaking out about the rotations. I would lookup a rotation chart that you can put up next to your client. For Kq I recommend finding someone with similar stats than you and duoing it. You‚Äôd probably be fine for 1 kill but it does a lot of damage and it‚Äôs a pain to get back to

Is this the best to do or no?

Dont ger me wrong, I dont intentionally crash people. I'm just tired of hearing iron men complain about being crashed or expecting other players to give them extra consideration because of the game mode they chose. I'm not going to do it. Get over yourself if you think that.

TBH I don't think they should release rates for everything. They already tell us way more than they used to, especially in regards to monster drop rates. 
---
The game need some uncertainty too it
---
You can safely drop most of them, it depends on how many quests you have done though, some items do come back into play but really not as many as you think.

Oh my bad thought you were talking about alchemical. Sounds be able to fit normal ones, although I'm not sure if they'll be as worth it to kill, most of the info I've heard at been about the alchemical hydra.

100k/hr is hard to hit, it takes a pretty decently leveled account t or experience in the game. There's no way a new persons hitting 100k in f2p

Caffeine doesn't lead to the same destructive and harmful consequences for the individual in question. Not as much of an issue. Same pretty much goes for sugar, combined with the fact that diets are really complicated to restrict. 
---
The only real solution against extreme ugar consumption and obesity is to remove any incentives of becoming fat in the first place. E.g. remove the possibility of receiving allowance from the government and the general societal acceptance of these outcomes by incorporating valuable information within the educational systems.

Its all about computations per second, a 1024 bit key can be cracked at around $75000 worth of computational power in 1h from rented amazon servers (this was over a year ago I needed to look into this so I might be a bit off with the numbers). In the case of Runescape though allowing unlimited attempts to attack a system would be more likely effect a DoS for login attempts however I have no idea what solution the team have for there servers so this is just a guess.

The old wiki looks absolutely awful as it's ram filled with ads. I'm surprised you think the new one is worse.

True many people despise defender because they probably don't know that Youtube exists with very good guides explaining methods to get runners 99% of the time, and kill them usually almost before everything else.  I honestly think defender is the most afk role in BA.
---
I've been playing a new account 4 days straight. All my levels are 10-30 now. I've finished about 5 quests. I've stockpiled about 15k.

So, what is recommended to do next? What skill should I focus on? Magic? Mining? Runemaking?

Also, when should I sign up for membership? I'm worried that I'll have too much to do and won't be able to finish up the f2p content.

Lots of animals aren't like humans, they don't get injured as easily as us. This is especially the case with smaller animals (hence the phrase "the bigger they are, the harder they fall"). I get what you're saying but I'm not going to argue the morals.

I came back recently after over a year. I had two DHCBs that I sold for 30m prior to the update. To be fair, no one knew it would become so useful, but man does it hurt lol. Can‚Äôt afford one now.
---
Gonna assume you knew what I meant 
---
If you have every other BIS other than BCP than it would be worth spending the cash on lol. If you could instead get literally any zenyte jewelry, any weapon, even tassets would be better. Spending the money on supplies to increase your wealth to afford more expensive things like Ags would also be more efficient than upgrading fighter torso to BCP. You can spew epeen juice over the internet to strangers all you want but that won't change the concepts that have been established for milenia. Get smart. Take a seat, dear.

That's a good point. Though RL is significantly more trustworthy I think, because it doesn't have an ex botting community running it.

If Vorkath is so easy and safe, why is it okay that it is so profitable?
---
I understand it is locked behind quests which require a lot of time, but under the same logic late-game skilling should also be as rewarding. Mining and hunter don't make nearly as much gp/hr as PvM - yet the most profitable PvM bosses are safe and easy (Vorkath and Zulrah).

No. The first picture shows the stats from the 6th of january 2017. That was the time when I actually started my road to max cape.
---
I agree with almost everything here. The one thing I disagree on is the XP aspect. A skilling raid wouldn't have to provide bis skilling XP methods in order to be used. Raids now don't provide high XP rates, but they do provide an incentive to get up to those levels in the first place. The same could be done with skilling.

I had a team of supposedly more experienced players kick me from the group because I was Defender and the guy playing Healer went AFK for like 5-6 minutes in a wave, meaning I had no callouts. Collector stopped collecting and nobody was firing any of the cannons. Apparently it's my fault we didn't breeze through the wave even though I have no callouts and i'm a Lvl 1 Defender so the lure range is absolute shite. I had many quitters and a few salty people in the grind but that group was just next level twattery. 
---
That's not true at all. The resources that you choose matter when you collect, but the total amount matters every day when the kingdom ticks.
---
Torags? Really? A man of your talents?
---
Right, keep telling yourself that. Toxic animal.
---
Ye, that's what it is. People using a "meme" to mask their hateful insults, incitements of violence/threats and general reprehensible attitude. That's per defitinion ""targeted harassment"". The mods agrees, the admins agrees.

Bunch of uncontrollable pigs to deal with here.

Already at a few thousand. Still better than Agility courses where you frequently fall and don't get the big XP drop at the end.

This game is not for you then.

Thanks man!:)

No, sand crabs are better xp assuming you find a spot and don't get crashed for it, which is near impossible
---
LOL
---
Wtf
---
You should consider completing the hard diaries for all areas. This will require you to do a decent amount of skilling that will get you a nice total level and complete some quests. 
---
Someone already mentioned it but you should probably sell your bandos chestplate and get a Fighter Torso and reinvest your chestplate money into other items!
---
Still waiting on the proof of this "research"

For decent do rates, you'll lose money. However I've been doing opal bracelets for around 40k xp an hour and this does turn a small profit but is reliant on the market as with most jewelry

Sell chest plate (although it looks cool you‚Äôll get it again) and get torso. Sell now too while it is expensive.

It's just nice to see the progress I supposes, be it xp, kc, or gp.

if you have max gear, just do Raids, it's 100x more fun than Zulrah or Vorkath and it makes more profit too.

This. That torag bod is visually great. Makes me want to try creating something similar. 
---
Oh, wow, I never knew that. I never finished the quest series in RS3 because I stopped years before that. There are plenty of references to the Dark Lord being Zamorak in the quest line, so I had simply assumed that it would obviously be Zamorak. I guess it's not that weird when judging from [the wiki.](https://rs.wiki/w/Dark_Lord)
---
I guess the red, female figure makes sense then :O
---
&gt; Both King Lathas and General Hining assumed the Dark Lord to be Zamorak, but they were proven wrong when Zamorak returned to Gielinor in the Sixth Age and the Iorwerths continued to attempt to summon the Dark Lord.
---
No, sarcasm is not just something clearly wrong. That would an obvious lie. Sarcasm is when something obviously wrong is said in a humourous way, either in jest or to make fun of the target of the sarcastic remark. Your example is sarcasm because it is said in a humourous way to make fun of me. Ironically, you do know instinctively what sarcasm is, but you're unclear in your definition.
---
&gt;It's more like shitty game design.

It's no surprise people would rather kill a dragon than cut down a tree.

Add the Red Axe questline to that list...
---
Damn. Gratz man
---
It's a book and you can build it in your PoH too.
---
It was [released](https://services.runescape.com/m=news/the-collection-log-and-deadman-permadeath-beta?oldschool=1) just last month.
---
&gt;haha user experience is pointless
---
Found the Blizzard shill
---
Well I did not play a lot so that's why. Yes it only takes months/weeks you are correct.
---
Nope. There was a collection lag update. You can get it in Varrock museum.
---
I still am not entirely familiar with all diary rewards despite having all hard ones done. Just used the lamps to train RC.
---
I told you, don't use the f**king Glock!
---
Kill blue dragons with magic for several hours. It would be faster with 70 agility, but you'll be aight.
---
Huh. I guess that shows how little I use Twitter. What does the acronym stand for?
---
This happened to me with the elf crystal. I thought I was the only one. 
---
How do you get that blue text above the chatbox?
---
Insert brainlet meme here.
---
I said this forever ago.. they need to change up the pron couch. Lol. I wish they‚Äôd do a JRE style podcast/video, it‚Äôd feel more comfortable for them and us
---
Saw u spamming Whip 650m - mr the other day but ok
---
You can get it by talking to the collector in the varrock museum.
---
So an incremental game
---
Glassblow Unpowered orbs, around 4xp less per glass than lantern lenses but around 30gp less loss per glass
---
I started out with an iron defender, walked in and started chatting with a guy who had been in there for 3 hours working on addy. He started out laughing and then wasn‚Äôt talking anymore when I asked him where to find the ones that drop drag defenders 
---
No they‚Äôre redirecting everyone to the new wikis it sketched me out this morning too but people in the cc I was in said it‚Äôs legitimate 
---
Just play and you get gp. As long as you're not doing buyable/net zero skills literally everything makes money. 
---
They moved urls to oldschool.runescape.wiki. I read about it in another post. Surely they can toss up a splash page informing people right?
---
World hopping you inbred mongoloid
---
You're using a fake wiki site. 
---
This is the real one: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/
---
Hide name, show stats. Way to go!
---
You grinded all the way to tbow? Nice man! 
---
You wouldn't download a skillcape
---
Thanks! 
---
Curator Haig Halen*
---
It‚Äôs just someone messing with the old wikia. There‚Äôs a new wiki which has no ads and is officially supported by Jagex 
---
How often do you have to do hops runs/makes nets? What kind of time making supplies vs time actually fishing do you do?
---
That you can switch between prayer/equips/inventory with F keys
---
Just make out already..
---
I hate you
---
Bunch of racists in here trying to hide the facts. There are no black Pmods at jagex, it's a fact. Something needs to happen, this is 2019 ffs!
---
I can name multiple ways to hit 100k+ with a fresh lv3 account.
---
Buying items from Varrock stores and selling on GE nets you well over 100k an hour
---
looting food and arrows on f2p wilderness worlds nets over 100k an hour
---
and even begging, as terrible as it may be, usually gets you around 250k-500k ak hour, sometimes even 1mil an hour if youre lucky.
---
There are more, but I'm just mentioning a few.
---
Never thought I‚Äôd see regular show on here. Best cartoon ever.
---
You're the best, thanks.
---
With coal you could have 546 a day. So 134 days is 73164. Which is worth 16,535,064.  
---
Implying we wouldn't say the same thing about Ash.
---
Start training slayer..... I just would like to throw a number out there from 92-93 slayer I made over 50m just sayin. Nothin serious. Think about it though! 
---
Ironic
---
 Not valid response.  Try again moron.
---
Sometimes I put HCIM in front of my name as a skull trick
---
It works really well 
---
Update: It was world 341 and I managed to reclaim it! I now have a phobia of black demons though... 
---
Pretty sure that is in the game now? What do you mean "might've"?
---
4 herblore levels and 99 fletching and 99 firemaking. Nice!
---
Objectively true, open your eyes and see it
---
....just get ecto and ardy cape, they‚Äôre very easy to get. 
---
IT'S THE WEED NUMBER XDDD
---
Yeah I've tried this but the remapping of the numpad doesnt work for me, pressing D for example just does nothing.
---
You are fine doing this 
---
Rsn: Tai Otoshi, for future SotW üòÄ
---
To add to this, a bunch of people are doing wildly slayer to boost points so they can skip for a hydra task
---
that +5 str bonus isnt worth the bs that is that minigame. The game is fine but there is so much standing around to drive anyone insane.
---
It's actually more beneficial to have the lower combat player tanking. That way the higher combat player can provide more DPS and finish kill quicker which conserves supplies in the end. Also gives you a better chance of getting loot when you inevitably get crashed.
---
Meaning my ass, looks retarded.
---
this devalues my tiara headgear only iron man.
---
Finally came through 
---
Nobody complains about Verac's brassard until someone cosplays it :thinking:
---
the minions respawn...?
---
if you are doing team gwd then the boss respawn timer is the big limiting factor and you should profit supplies anyways.
---
Yeah, the only point in doing most skills is purely for the 99, nothing else really.
---
I've been here from the beginning. It's been cancer everyday.
---
They also released a video with someone in melee gear when zulrah was released. They purposefully misguide you.
---
yes, however it isnt particularly effective because its not a full freeze. even if you hit the spec it can still eat.
---
yeah thats fine. the margins on herbs change often so youd want to use a calc if you were super concerned about maximizing profit and cared about a few more k gp per run
---
I think you can but the mobs will agro to you.
---
How does it run with 60fps still gets hot? Jw I might upgrade soon. Thanks. 
---
Vorkath is also a lot less gp/hour if you're going with a blowpipe + BGS setup, the ideal setup includes DHCB (160m+), Rigour (60m+), Elite Void, and Salve (ei) at the very least.
---
are you absolutely 100% certain you logged into the right account? eg is your rs3 account gone from the highscores? its more likely you ended up creating a second account with the same email/similar login info and just logged into that one instead.
---
jagex does not reset accounts.
---
What builds have you played this league? 
---
the bosses all have mechanics. you need to kill the orbs the guthix one places down iirc.
---
Dude, I hated mining so much, especially after getting a Coal bag.
---
You're also constantly competing for spots and you have to click individual ores for most of the training. It's awful.
---
Hi tiblack9!
---
213m xp after quest!
---
I don't know why people complain about design, fandom wiki isn't any much better because on the right side you see "trending fandom articles" instead of that empty space.
---
&gt; All of it are old wiki links that lead straight to Nieve [https://imgur.com/a/22XmT5V](https://imgur.com/a/22XmT5V) 
---
Ah yes, it's vandalised, it must be those despicable [os.rs.wiki](https://os.rs.wiki) admins that are doing to steal work that Fandom made
---
I dont think its ever been a thing, its just an extra reward for the level.
---
thats a good fucking effort 
---
The only vandalism to ever happen on wikia is destroying the page and then saying use your new wiki lmao.
---
Is your new wiki just for fun? You make money off advertising correct? Seems off that "vandals" politely leave a link to the "real" wiki. 
---
Riot S Retro#7511 and yeah I do. I'll charge a little more if it gets complex because  more work I'm putting into it you know? And also thank you!
---
Slayer is 80k+ xp per hour if you don't want to go into a point deficit.
---
If you have 2k points banked you can easily hit over 120k+ per hour. That's like 20 hours for 2.2m xp.
---
Well it wouldn't necessarily be "fixing" it since the xp is doled out based on how many essence are used, not how many runes are made. Unless I'm misunderstanding your question.
---
https://twitter.com/RiotSRetro
---
are they underarmour socks
---
Would be interesting to see how your bank progressed as well
---
It‚Äôs simple economics my dear Watson 
---
Yes! This is super useful. I was just complaining today that there wasn't a map for how to get to Rashiliyia's tomb on the wiki. Keep it up.
---
"to me irl for me irl"? What.
---
Hey that's me :D 
---
Gotcha, he's higher melee and combat lvl (~115 vs 103) and I have slightly higher ranged (85 vs ~80) which was why we had decided on him tanking while I ranged. Do you think it would still hold true for melee vs ranged dps? 
---
Who cares
---
Who the hell needs to go to barb village? Not like Edgeville, the fairy ring, or even Varrock Square are that far.
---
Epic frog haha! :)
---
Some people really appreciate maps, they're maybe the best way to know where to go. I appreciate you!
---
Foe?
---
You all are lame
---
You can also look at the [new wiki -&gt; Managing Miscellania](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Managing_Miscellania)
---
binge some netflix, do it in the background. Goes by super quick. Save the logs for fletching xp, and take a flecthing break every level or so. 
---
I also find it helps to do the clue nests as a nice break.
---
yeah i understand lol more detail means more money. its like if you're a prostitute more stuff means more money. idk why i keep comparing you to a hooker but yeah.
---
1:1, if it's just remapping, is perfectly fine
---
you're mostly just not allowed to use programs to move the mouse around (with the exception of windows mousekeys)
---
literally unplayable stupid jigiflaxo
---
Look at the farming guide. Find out what allotments, flowers, and herbs you can plant. Buy the seeds you need (3 each allotment patch, and 1 for both herb and flower patches) also a spade, rake, and seed dibber. Rake the patch, compost it (ultracompost&gt;supercompost&gt;compost), then plant the seed and wait for it to grow and harvest ot when its fully grown. Look on the wiki for the patch locations. Eventually you can work on trees and fruit trees, planting those are a bit different tho. Only ultracompost the better herbs and all trees and fruit trees, use normal or super compost for anything else.
---
TLDR: rake, compost, plant seed, wait, harvest (literally that simple, just try it).
---
I‚Äôm in 
---
Wikia vandalism happened all the time, but we dealt with it before most people saw it. Because we were moderating the site.
---
The Wikia wiki, quite obviously, has no administrators or moderators right now and thus vandalism goes ahead untouched.
---
The new wiki is the official one, and we‚Äôre the same editors who were editing the old ones for years and years. Before you make accusations, do your research, we have a whole thread about leaving Wikia on [this page](https://runescape.wiki/w/Forum:Leaving_Wikia) and there‚Äôs also newsposts on the RuneScape website about it.
---
We don‚Äôt make money off of advertising because **we don‚Äôt have any ads**.
---
Fisherman, master chef and pyromaniac?
---
A women‚Äôs later means the same as jagex‚Äôs soon
---
Holy shit, the one time serene is being downvoted but I agree with him. Back in the day log in/log out messages didn‚Äôt just disappear in a few seconds, they stayed indefinitely. So your entire private chat would be filled with people changing worlds and it made using private chat super annoying. 
---
Jesus ur realllly paying attention to what matters the most. /s
---
How many chickens they knock out to succeed in this
---
Would you like to open this page in the reddit app? 
---
if people don't put the same amount of hours of effort into something that other people do, why should they get the benefits? Nothing from the diaries is needed in the game, they just make things easier
---
That‚Äôs exactly the point, the rc skill doesn‚Äôt really allow you to get faster xp rates as you get further until you get all the way to 77. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such a meme target all the time because you‚Äôre stuck with xp rates blatantly lower than almost all other skills of a similar level. The multiple runes giving extra xp has been mentioned by a lot of people and would be a way of improving this 
---
::bank
---
I did that just now, hopefully I get  response tomorrow (not expectin much sunday night).
---
What content is not present on the new wiki?
---
The RuneScape Wiki has moved to an independent site. As a result, the old version is no longer actively maintained. **Please edit your comment with the new link:**  
---
https://runescape.wiki/w/Special:BlockList

For more information, see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9kqukw/).
---
I guess he really did deserve that clue reward
---
now do a futa edit pls
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/wiki/quickstartguide
---
RC gets way too much unecessary hate. The skill is basically easymode now with zeah runecrafting. If you are complaining about AFK RC then IDK what else to say. 
---
Agility is also not terrible because once you build muscle memory, you can watch a show while doing it and the xp is fair. 
---
Mining was by far the worst until afk volcanic mine happened. 
---
There is zero terrible skills on OSRS now. The game has been slowly changed into ezscape for a while now. 
---
i got balls too but if space is conserved im not gonna keep my knees out. maybe it's a fat guy thing idk
---
Bis in my bank. I don't want to spend all this money on an addy plate or even rune. I guess I worded it wrong
---
Zeah RC is like 48k per hr afk. 
---
I just do ranarrs on all for the most profit. Barely any die, and if they do you can use the level 78 arceuus spell to revive. 
---
Quests are a really good start, with the rewards and training towards the reqs to complete more. Just come up with some goals for the account, and grind away!
---
you can add me in game if you want - shaaylyn
---
Excuse me? Not sure about what your talking about. Are you saying that finding the site itself has zero impact on the sites traffic? Because that's a bold claim contradicted by literally every social online phenomenon. Why do you think Amazon is more popular that Ali Baba? It's the first 25 results when a user looks for something.  Saying the wiki people shouldn't care about who sees their page is 
---
&gt;the most retarded comment I've ever seen
---
So what I‚Äôm still confused on is say I‚Äôm only wanting to pick up two shark and I have 10 spaces available. If I right click and select, will it give me the option of how many to pick up? 
---
This could be a nightmare in PVP. 
---
Love the work though!
---
Volcanic mine is like 55k per hr afk. Zero reason why you should be complaining. 
---
Inb4: my account got hacked and I have no idea what caused it
---
&gt; no bank pin
---
&gt; probably no auth
---
&gt; probably no security at all
---
You literally don‚Äôt have any idea what you are talking about. Also the word mongoloid is offensive, I hope you can find a better word to use in the future. 
---
Thats foe
---
If you say your password backwards it's censored 
---
Depends on what you're fighting. A lvl 2 man, or a boss that switches attack types and is aware of overhead prayers, or even another player who makes conscious decisions to best you. 
---
Not gonna lie, former Trump voter here. This is fucking hilarious watching Trump crash and burn. But in all seriousness we can't let this guy get the nuclear codes.
---
You can straight up AFK at volcanic for 55k per hour xp. 
---
/r/beetlejuicing?
---
Its intentionally like that.
---
Lol
---
Just cuz osrs has no double exp. I feel like this meme will trick sum noobs into giving out their account info to one of the many scams for double exp. out there.
---
Don't tell me in 4 years of using reddit you've never come across /r/2meirl4meirl 
---
What am I looking at

why even bother using the old one?
---
Getting pkd is really fast, takes like 30s max if you have a shitty spawn
---
I should get the UIM tattoo cause there‚Äôs nothing in my bank :,)
---
bronzeman
---
Old wiki &gt; new wiki. Google agrees
---
Why didn't they make it forward to the new wiki instead?
---
This really confused me as I managed to open a page on the wiki, then when I clicked a link it forwarded me to Nieve. I guess I must have opened the first page just before they implemented the forwarding. I found my way to the new site eventually.
---
I like your item: Dripping Pipe.
---
ohhhhhhhhhhshhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
2 minutes, shows to others after 60 seconds
---
even still, 60 seconds + the time it takes to kill whatever it is (and i‚Äôm assuming it takes a bit, typically lower levels are the ones afking wyverns gargs) is still more afk time than you get at zeah, and the fact that it‚Äôs more fixed (ie always going to be 60 seconds to show) means you can pay less attention than something like zeah where it could deplete at any second 
---
It's not p2w though? I own nearly every champ and play less then 6 on a regular basis and never more then those 6 if I'm doing ranked. The only advantage you get is trying more champions which is an arguable advantage at best. Having a wide champion pool isn't a thing you need in League.
---
&gt;90K/Hr at 99
---
Why the fuck are you recommending a skilling method that needs 99 for max xp rates? He obviously needs a method to GET to 99, holy fuck.
---
Imagine stinking up your chair mining post 99.
---
Twisted bow would just raise in price. 
---
According to the wiki, marks are ~12k each and you can get around 20 per hour in the Ardougne course which is lvl 90.
---
Nature runes are 500k+/hour at lvl 44 rc even accounting stamina pots.
---
Unless they were pure chance
---
It's pretty common practise for people to preface their query about the game in google search with "osrs". Unfortunately this usually fruits the old wiki which some annoying people have rendered useless. There is a way though that makes Chrome automatically search the new OSRS Wiki if you preface your query with "osrs" or any other keyword you like. 
---
Go to Chrome settings and look for "Manage search engines"
---
Once there, click "Add" under "Other search engines"
---
In the "Search Engine" box, you can type what you like. This is simply the label for the search engine and does not affect how this operates.
---
In the "Keyword" box, type whatever word you'd like to use to preface your query. This keyword will be the prompt for Chrome to search the wiki, and not google. I use "osrs" because that's what i did with google anyway.
---
And in the final box, add this link: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special:Search?search=%s
---
And save. 
---
So now every time you type your keyword in the search bar, it will readjust the search to search the new OSRS wiki, not google. "osrs bandos boots" will take you straight to the bandos boots wiki page. 
---
The only annoying thing is if you genuinely want to google your query, then you can't put the "osrs" qualifier at the start otherwise it will induce this search engine redirect. 
---
He will show up after Underground Pass, you rarely need skill requirements to start a quest
---
Clicking ge history offer to load up a repeat of the same offer
---
I have 30 
---
Why
---
He‚Äôs probably the best combo of gp and slayer xp in the game, if you‚Äôre doing it right he‚Äôs 2m+ gp/hr and actually ok slayer xp at ~40k. So if you want gp or the pet then it can definitely be worth it, if you only want 99 slayer and don‚Äôt care about anything else keep it blocked. Cerb is actually a fairly chill boss with spectral and a good prayer level, you just need to pay attention to his specials as those will clap you if you‚Äôre not
---
I'm pretty new to RS, haven't had time to level it
---
No, if you suicide in the instance you will lose your stuff
---
Please submit links using the [link submission form](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/submit).
---
You need to get a torso for a master clue, granite body and level 5 roles for diary requirements. After that the only reason to play is either for pet or for fun. There are plenty of people who keep playing after the pet because it's an incredibly fun and challenging game to become an expert at. Also, ironman accounts can do medium level gambles if they need an adamant square shield.
---
Who the fuck is Tony?
---
and if hitler was the first girl you met on a party would you still date him?
---
This is a rare half-woosh
---
Sorry but I already did what I had to do
---
That is an old method, now you can skip the b staves grind, and what most ironman do atm is to farm giant seaweed and just collect sand to later train crafting. 
---
..if everyone dbow spec'd Trump at once..you may have a chance before he eats a sara brew..

whoops accidentally pressed ctrl+v guess I'm a wiki admin now where's my flair at
---
Link to the plugin please?
---
... wat.
---
The "grind" in League is nowhere near the same as the "grind" in rs3. RS games are all about the grind making you stronger. In League, the champions are all balanced in power, not based on how much they cost.
---
There's no real advantage to having a wide champion roster. In fact, most high-rank players siggest learning a few champions very well.
---
On top of which, the design of the cheapest champions (most avaolable to new players) are intentionally generally easy to help learn the game.
---
Yeah these are great!
---
and you dont get aids 
---
Do ourania altar, its extremely chill and if you use runelite you can increase your render distance which lets you click a bit farther.
---
What do you mean, friend?
---
Looking for suggestions on the order I should upgrade my Zulrah gear. 
---
Currently have Ahrims, Infinity Boots, Ring of Suffering, and Book of Darkness with blessed d'hide &amp; fury switch. Blowpipe and Trident of the Swamp as well. [In picture form](https://i.imgur.com/y5xtE1m.png)
---
Planning on picking up an Anguish next, then wasn't sure if I should go for Ancestral Hat &amp; Arma Helm switches or Imbued heart. 
---
Also for doing the 50 or whatever Vorkath kills for the Ava's upgrade, should I wait till I can grab a BGS, or just go for it now? Would be using blowpipe as I don't have a Hasta. 
---
Wiki admins RESIGNED! 
---
Probably not. The random number generator probably uses time code as a seed so unless you got the kill at the exact same time it would‚Äôve been a different drop.
---
I didn't get aids.
---
Weird flex but ok. 
---
Buying gf
---
A UK house world would be amazing, the lag on the current US one is painful at times
---
You are talking about that huh, it takes 2 clicks to remove sidebar, just press moon icon and enable reader mode
---
The age in the UK (and also Canada and even many parts of the US) is actually 16, not 18. :P
---
Would be one hell of a boss fight, what would be a proper rare drop?
---
Probably, I turned my game sounds on and not only has my depression gone but I'm great at prayer flicking now
---
Vorkath/Zulrah along with raids are the top money makers with the Alchemical Hydra releasing in a few days to be similar gp/hr at first due to the high price of newly released uniques but only on a slayer task.
---
In terms of more chill money makers I personally prefer gem mining with the hard karamja diary completed which can be at least 600k/hr depending on your luck with the more highly valued gems. There are a lot better methods than this but you literally only need a rune pickaxe and a charged amulet of glory for this and as I said, is a personal favourite of mine.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm not a fan of lavas though and the money from Bloods adds up slowly so I‚Äôll be happy with that cash stack after a while.
---
Oh that‚Äôs awesome, thanks for sharing! My buddy wanted to see the capes so this is great!
---
well, I could have been fooled by the internet, but I believe there were some bosses for ftp to fight. Im a bit of a noob, my stats are around the 40s currently, but wanted to know who to fight and how to prep for it. Does this make sense?
---
My membership ran out and I can't figure out how to renew it, when I go to the membership page on the website it says i'm not eligible for any items in this category, what am I doing wrong? 
---
I instead petition that Ash gets a massive lazyboy chair and everyone else sits on the floor.
---
&gt; during study
---
How do you accomplish any quality study while skilling? It's not that AFK, and I tried. Is there a trick except from botting? 
---
I did 22-90 smithing on iron knives just to say I did. Do not recommend. 
---
Petition to make OSRS team sit closer to each other.
---
Hey I‚Äôm a huge supporter of the new wiki but I just wanted to say that the wave layout for Fight Caves is genuinely better on the old wikia.  It‚Äôs formatted so that important wave changes and which prayers you need are highlighted and bolder in red.  The new wiki does not do this.  
---
I‚Äôm not sure who to contact about this.
---
Of course they care dipshit. If morons like you would take the time to type in the website instead of using malware wikia it would have enough traffic to be a top result.
---
That's not even a good name 
---
Either way both new players in league are going to suck ass and wont have a gameplay advantage. Doesnt make it p2w imo
---
True. We own chickens, the feathery bastards are tough as nails. The rooster once attacked me, I kicked it in the chin, he did a double-backflip, landed on his back. Walked dizzy for a few minutes whent to live a few more happy years during which the fucker didn't dare attack me.
---
I was a badass 13 year old.
---
nice mayming :]
---
The only name I respect like this is the streamer ron whose name is " I Ron man"
---
Hate to be that guy but it's 'than' not 'then'.
---
Well what do you know, I actually like to be that guy.
---
&gt; Looking forward to crushing quests
---
This makes me so happy. So many new players say things like they hate quests, they‚Äôre stupid and they‚Äôre not going to do them...it‚Äôs disgusting. 
---
Quests and diaries give such good rewards and xp *and they‚Äôre fun* 
---
Very nicely done, that will be useful!
---
No you're techincally right, it will be called [Kourend &amp; Kebos Achievement Diary](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Poll_Blog:_The_Kebos_Lowlands)
---
Is this serious? No support.
---
As it would only devalue my 4 squares south of CW Bank Genie Random UIM.

^^^/s
---
Right? What‚Äôs not to like?
---
any specific reason why you won't use the new one?
---
Right? What‚Äôs not to like!?
---
Get a stat up to a decent level that can make you decent money in p2p (fishing, wcing, mining)
---
This way, you don't have to rely on high level combat to make your money in p2p to keep buying bonds (if you do plan on using them only)
---
I'm grinding 800k for Salve ammy right now and i went over an hour without even one @ 114cb.  I only seem to be able to get about 100k xp an hour in there to running Dharoks
---
but.. runecrafting is also running in laps but you have to bank in between. how can it be worse?
---
Sometimes i think you are on drugs serene
---
I would sell torm for a bgs, bust out 50kc at vork for a head. Buy back your torm after selling the bgs. Then I would get an anguish. Then your pretty set till ancestral hat/other upgrades. Another "upgrade" could be 83 con for pool, which is super nice at zulrah
---
No thanks.
---
The problem with Dark Beast and other creatures with unique item drops, is that the players decide the price of said unique item. This means that the price will fluctuate and therefore the droptable can never be properly balanced.
---
I mean, imagine that Jagex buffs the Dark Beast droptable, but then the Dark Bow becomes relevant again and rises to 2-3m or more. Do we then nerf the droptable again?
---
Alternatively you just make the Dark Bow relevant and keep the current droptable intact, but then other unique ranged weapon drops will crash in price. Do we then buff those droptables?
---
You run from edgeville and into the Abyss :vUse Stamina pots or dueling ring to continue running/healing (I guess you could use food in the bank, but I prefer the full endurance).
---
Idk, it's usually about a minute per run give-or-take (depends a bit on your rng) and before lvl 50 it's 35 runes per run.
---
Which means over 2k Nats in the hour. Yea, the stamina potions eat into your profits, but you make way more than enough to pay for them since it's 2 runs per sip. I guess you could use Energy Potions too since you only need \~35 run energy per run.
---
I didn't really calculate how many Stamina pots I used, but even if I bought 10 of them, that's still \~550k profit. I'm estimating you only need about 30 sips per hour or around 7.5 stamina pots in an hour if you ONLY use stamina pots (which you probably wont).
---
*Devalues the skill, and essentially the whole game.
---
This is unironically the type of suggestion that 07scape would like to implement, memes aside. Which is why Jagex has to issue thorogh scrutiny before taking suggestions on here into account.
---
You can‚Äôt really leech in pest control or you get no points.
---
Fell for it. Lost 40m bank on ironman. Not been on Twitch in years, barely visit the subreddit, I thought the developer stream was legit. My own fault I guess, I just wasn't up-to-date with how prevalent this shit was 
---
Use the NPC at the GE?
---
Someone did make an extension for chrome so that when you click on an old wiki page it redirects you to that page on the new wiki.  I still use it, it is amazing.
---
But the dude at ge does the exact same thing? Even for noted
---
I think it depends a lot on account age like if the account is.12 Years old and you only give info that's a year old it may raise red flags 
---
Counter picking is important, should have at least 3-4 characters for any role you might want to queue for ranked, no idea why you're saying it's not important at all. (I was plat in league in like season 3 it's an ok game)
---
are you an idiot, or just trying to be funny?
---
I think that need to make it so they cannot be in sub mode only if they don't have the ability to have subs or a sub button. Would like to communicate with people via chat but you cant because of the Twitch settings... Shit sucks. 
---
Sell them
---
b-but his source is more legitimate cause it's his opinion /s
---
I'm curious, do you think we get paid for this?
---
Unless you're ironically collecting an idiot tax
---
Pace
---
Very informative and straight-forward. Thank you for putting time into making this.
---
Btw are you insinuating DotA is p2w lol
---
Did you do barb fishing? I just ran the numbers for getting 70 agility and it‚Äôs looking like 140 hours. I hope that‚Äôs a high estimate. 
---
Probably depends on the phone and launcher, but on my S8 with nova it's "Old School R...".
---
I think mining is most people's last 99 so you're definitely not alone. 
---
You're going to love death runes once you get there. I just did like 11k xp to finish off a level and made close to 300k.
---
Play with sound on, when the sound stops click, then go back to studying. 
---
blowpipe only merks him if you have expensive gear and rigour, which not everyone that does bandos has 
---
So your saying because purrs have low def you are probably not going to hit more often with high att anyway?
---
This pic gives me PTSD... Might do with my military service...
---
I hate Blast Furnace, but I liked AFK Smithing on a regular account making dart tips. So nah, Runecrafting is worse.
---
I support this, nice job!
---
Hi Mr_Weber03!
---
Use a main account novelty accounts are not good for bosses
---
I have no idea!!! 
---
frozen in disbelief 
---
Why are you even using the old outdated Wikia?
---
This has to be fake, no one can train runecrafting above level 2
---
What is your reason? I love using cannon for slayer you get way more xp/hr
---
Can you do a live stream or a video of you building this script in exactly 3 seconds?
---
Wow she‚Äôs done a lot! She‚Äôs like the female Tom Kenny (voice of spongebob)
---
Do quests!
---
IMO, it's because:
---
1. RC is WAY more money and I know I'm making decent cash for my level every lap.
---
2. It feels way less frustrating to train because I'm not constantly falling off of courses at the end and missing the big XP drops
---
3. It feels like I'm actually upgrading my account over time, going into more expensive runes, bigger pouches and even more money. Agility just feels like an arbitrary click gate for shortcuts and graceful set.
---
My problem was that I felt the need to ALWAYS afk something if I could, which lead me to stress if I didnt and less focus on stuff like studying. Recently decided to take a break for this reason, even though I still love the game. First break I've took that wasnt due to burnout
---
Hi darbooka!
---
Bit of both

Dude what is this for real? 
---
Should RS3 players who want to play OSRS not swap their RS3 gp to OSRS gp too?
---
"NoW YoU CAn TrAiN SlaYeR"
---
Ya lol that hurts
---
I noticed as well, but if you click on the green arrow next to the url and click ‚ÄúCache‚Äù it will show what you need to know 
---
lmfao this actually happened im surprised watched a bait video and not get baited bravo.
---
Then don't use the old wiki.
---
Because the grass is always greener on the other side
---
this is pissing me off

Wanted to hit the ground running but ended up hitting the ground lookin like roadrunner.

sorry man, but i really can't be bothered to read all this. it just isn't interesting enough, it's not like it don't want to know your point of view, but damn
---
Sabotaging wikis in general has been a thing for as long as wikis have been a thing. Along with the fact the admins of the wiki were banned from the old wiki so there's less and less strict moderation, there's a precedent  from it being a fad/meme to vandalize the old wiki when the new wiki first launched, a long standing hate for Wikia's practices in general, not just with the OSRS wiki, and some people just like to vandalize what they can.
---
Damn I didn‚Äôt know ranarr wasn‚Äôt first 
---
Hi nIceBarrage!
---
Tbf I still inadvertently use the old wiki because of my habit of googling everything instead of going directly to the website.
---
are you an ecologist
---
They're permitted. Last I heard, Jagex's official stance is 'use at your risk' in regards to being banned or hacked. I've also heard Runelite works pretty close with Jagex to make sure none of their addons will trigger bot detection or otherwise get users banned.
---
Can I add you just because you're cool?
---
I just bankrolled my gf to 43 Prayer when she started and she still plays about 2 years later. Have no idea how it worked but I guess she saw me play enough before making an account that she didn‚Äôt burn out as easily and just got hooked. I think it helped that I made my alt with her and progressed as she did.
---
Now I give her like 5M every Christmas lol. 
---
Legit never noticed this!!
---
Whenever mobile came out for iOS. Octoberish?
---
The new one isn't even fully finished
---
Yes.  99 attack 50 str will probably have pretty close DPS to 50 attack 99 str against a 99 def character.
---
If you're still confused about how accuracy and damage works you should take a look at the accuracy roll formula, I think you can find it on the wiki
---
Makes sense. I used to have pretty bad anxiety and avoided playing with try-hards. Not so much anymore, but I'm still not a very competitive person.
---
Use the wiki, not wikia.
---
What do you mean? What's missing?
---
I also notice you didn't reply to the poster debunking your strawman, get off your high horse you're an idiot with too much free time on your hands and not enough real life human contact.
---
Wow. I could have never done these skills that fast solely on F2P. Congrats on your achievement!
---
Hope you enjoy members and GL on maxing :)

What's unfinished about it?

Same except I actually got one who stuck around and is about to buy membership.  He loves the chill grind.
---
People in full armour skilling secretley annoy me
---
Better yet just remove rc
---
I don't get why hackers drop untradeables.  Just take your shit and sell it. I can at least understand that hacking and stealing someone's gold can yield you IRL money. Why spend your time making someone's day even worse for no personal gain?!?
---
I'm sure we could turn this into a very eloquent conversation that spans many comments, lasting days, perhaps creating a friendship. But I must henceforth attend my meeting with fellow MENSA members, lest I be tardy, which I assure you is quite a faux pas!
---
Some npcs and guest steps the last time i tried to use it, which was a week ago.
---
Also you really have to look for the new wiki since like the first 50 links when you google "osrs wiki" are wikia
---
Because it‚Äôs multi combat
---
**Personally** that's what I think about pvming or skilling. I prefer to play pvp because it's more dynamic and OSRS has unique pvp compared to other games which is still evolving.
---
pretty sure he made that date up...
---
no i‚Äôm not at all, you‚Äôre just being rude to them. they‚Äôre trying to have fun and they‚Äôre being happy, you don‚Äôt need to try and put them down

Hi Eyjaffjallajokull!

I totally thought she was going to grab that second basket and nab the kid too

Just barrage them while he collects them and let him do all the work for you. Low effort xp without the need for ppots.

That wiki is full of viruses use the real one.
---
He didn‚Äôt shoot the doors of a bank though 
---
Thanks. I've been looking for some of their comments on Reddit.  If I find any, will post them here.
---
Pls. I need this 
---
I only crash when they say something rude. Sometimes I'll even bring my main account to help crash.
---
Fucking moron
---
So I can‚Äôt google and get RS wiki anymore? Related items aren‚Äôt linked anymore either?
---
Why have you broken it?
---
You can make 250K in 5 minutes at some rune shops.
---
Stop using the old wiki, its trash. 
---
And a recline. Can't forget the recline.
---
Maybe a boost too. Why not.
---
lmao 10/10 mimic of how he talks 
---
just too smart and sophisticated
---
The point is that it's not hard at all of make a bot script to do this.
---
Nah just wondering cuz I've had them turned off since doing dream mentor and something on the wiki said it had a magic attack
---
Btw, are you the kid I just crashed at sand crabs?
---
Ah yes Fashionscaping while fly fishing is my favorite sport.
---
Because the one with the most expensive toys wins...
---
I‚Äôve noticed thag many pages on the new Wiki contain much less info than the old one - that was what made me happy the old wiki was still my first result. For exampl, the old wiki page for Desert Treasure gave the best methods for killing each boss, on top of saying what makes each boss unique and hard. The new wiki simply says ‚Äúkill the boss‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt *guide* you on how to do it or what to look out for.
---
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE DRIVING DOWN THE PRICE SO THEY CAN ACCUMULATE!! BUY NOW AND HODL!
---
It hasn't even been polled. There is no date. 
---
that sounds fair enough
---
Fair game, I do all my wildly clues 
---
I think you are looking at the wrong page -- https://OSRS.wiki/Desert_Treasure has strictly more info than the similar wikia article.
---
Whose gonna say it
---
How the actual fuck do you get to 99 thieving
---
bad bot
---
HR department would like to have a word with you.
---
As we moved to an entirely new site, we need time for our search rank to rebuild itself. It's not an easy feat, and using the new wiki will only help speed this up. 
---
Yooooo I got rangers on my first medium clue too. That's wassup.
---
Or maybe because this subreddit posted a shit ton of nieve porn a few months ago...
---
Big facepalm
---
I'd really need some extra detail on what is missing to investigate - everything on old wiki was moved to the new wiki on October 2nd and no substantial edits have happened to the old wiki since.
---
I recommend checking out https://osrs.wiki/RS:FIND for some ways to get to the wiki easier.
---
Then complain to twitch. Jagex cannot control what twitch does. 
---
There's no rule but if you're going to hurt your own exp rates and someone else's for no reason other than you don't want to spend 20 seconds hopping, you're probably a dick IRL too
---
Some quests, waterfall, camp slayer, monkey madness and other; did some sand crabs but mostly on slayer.
---
stuff that can be repaired (eg defenders, firecapes) break in pvp deaths below 20 wild.
---
gear that doesnt break drops to the ground no penalty (eg graceful)
---
untradables (stuff like rune pouches, clue scrolls, etc are destroyed on death)
---
the ma2 cape is always lost in pvp deaths due to lore or something
---
Not just me then holy fuck

Underground pass isn't even bad.

Only recently came back after quitting around 2009.... really miss summoning was shocked it wasn‚Äôt apart of osrs. 
---
Well i don't really remember the stuff i was doing then, all i'm saying is i prefer wikia and i don't get the witch hunt on what runescape info website people use
---
I forget wha they‚Äôre called, but the Taverly dungeon has these monks in red clothing that are pretty good low level money making, but you won‚Äôt find very good combat money making until later.
---
i dont even know how to do clue scrolls i have 2 hard and a medium in my bank. is it hard?
---
He might have alched the cape for gp 
---
The buff everything mentality will get us to rs3. Dark beasts are fine, if anything we should nerf nechraels and gargoyles 
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Personally I don't think it needs it. You can get 500k/h xp rates at todt already and there are things outside of log burning you can do. It would be dead content pretty quickly imo
---
"I don't want to see you talking to her anymore! What was her name again? Fl0ppyB0ner? WHY DONT YOU CUT YEWS WITH ME ANYMORE??"

Agility is so chill to do. You can watch movies next to it so easy. For me agility is like any other afk skill.
---
Butrc is so click intensi
---
Worst skill in my opinion is mining. 
---
Clean and simplistic look probably helps compared to the visual diarrhea that is the average MMO at least
---
In the top right corner there's a button resembling a wrench somewhat. There you can add bank fillers. 
---
I use these for now and replace them with saplings once I have the farming level for it.
---
I did this same thing lol
---
So looks like you have a long road (its actually mad short in osrs terms) ahead of you to achieve your goal. Don't be frustrated as it only gets worse from here. Let the new adventures be exciting and learn to enjoy the grinds. 
---
Eat my fucking ass Serene
---
I legit couldn't find a world earlier and gave up to do something else 
---
I can cook the tuna I catch but I haven't been because the prices were almost identical and I know I will burn lots so will be loosing profit but I suppose if it gets my cooking level up I should start doing it! I just don't think I'm anywhere near being able to get the swansong quest done because of the requirements. Really I need to just do loads of quests to get all my skills up a bit but I'm really bored of quests atm lol
---
This isn't gonna be a viable method of training the skill; yes we have wintertodt but that doesn't actually make the skill useful - it's training for the sake of training.
---
Do as many quests as you can! It unlocks so many good moneymakers! 
---
That isn't really the point of it, just to see how many you can get. Incentive to do things you might not have before, just to get the total number of completed tasks up.
---
if you click the down arrow at the end of the link you can view a "cached" version from googles servers.
---
Same here man. Probably best to logon late at night for that task tbh
---
Last sunday I checked osrs had 4 times more players online 
---
maybe it was personal
---
English must not be your first language then

Whats the plug in called that removes other players?

It's pretty useful when you consider all the rewards you get from the crates
---
So i just started some mining and then quickly started leveling my strength up (lvl 20) and some attack (lvl 11). I found out selling bronze bars are giving nice amount of cash so im gonna mine some more and sell my bars

The wiki is fine. The trash old wiki is broken, as it should be  
---
I don't have a source, but they have specifically said they will not be banning anyone for using a third party client. They are also working with the 3rd party client developers (to keep OP plugins from being used, for example)

Oh trust me I love the grinds, in the sense of leveling one thing at a time lol just not enjoying the early game and having to do quests haha. I know when I'm at the point of being able to just grind one thing I will start enjoying it more :)

Aside from low level ironmen they're mediocre. And again, wintertodt is more of a training method than an actual incentive to train the skill past level 50.

True. I only know of gargs that drop them pretty frequently. What other monster drops them?

Everyone uses it and you probably got banned for other reasons they won‚Äôt ban you for using a Client that they themselves talk about. 
---
I believe Mod Sween said it multiple times on the Q&amp;A and I think there's blogpost to follow it. This all happened around the time Runelite almost got shut down. I'll try and find you a link.

You need to win over this guy's heart to use that barrage

Yeah the first few quests really suck. I actually got so pissed at always having a missing quest requirement that I spent a couple weeks and got the quest cape.

Extra trick: if your bank is all the way filled up with fillers and you deposit your entire inventory, this means only items that are already in will stack and the rest will stay. Handy for smithing for example when you wanna drop the items you made but not the hammer

Hi JesusMafia1!
---
agility is definitely my least favorite to train, so you're not alone. takes goddamn forever and the marks of grace aren't shiny enough to really break the monotony (falling off of roofs is annoying as well)
---
Yeh would be nice. Hopefully one day they do something like this 
---
Quality chat
---
The only objectivity is in xp and gp rates.
---
use the actual wiki.

It alchs for like 60k....

Agility ranks higher for me since its more afk.

I understand, it's because you're a silly crab. 
---
Regarding afk-ness, I preferred mining amethyst over MLM. The XP is only half as good though (~20k xp/hour), and the method itself is locked behind 92 mining.
---
Cool thank you for this, just set up the search engine
---
OSRS by a very large amount also pking is completely dead in RS3 but still active here.
---
Using your mouse, presumably. 
---
Looks like you're using wikia - We moved on the second of October to https://oldschool.runescape.wiki (or https://osrs.wiki for short). [here is a guide](https://osrs.wiki/RS:FIND) on how to get there easily. 
---
I know, I'm not saying I have an issue with it but if anyone especially new players who don't read reddit search literally anything osrs they won't find the site on the first page of results. The first result is the old wiki.
---
get dark reader app dark theme for everything
---
get dark reader app dark theme for everything and only adblock u need is ublock origin
---
 These people watching are 100% only other runescape players.
---
You are acting like OSRS brings in thousands of foreign viewers who are intrigued with the games mechanics but aren't willing to commit to the grind. 
---
Only runescape players watch runescape streams. There are thousands of you guys watching but your point doesn't really have much relevance.
---
Timer for one vein after you start mining. IIRC it's around 15s per vein. It's better to go to someone else's vein because you will have more available veins since more ppl mining =/= faster rate of depletion for 2nd floor :)
---
Yeah. It's not that bad though, because the rates for AFKing are still decently balanced imo (zeah rc is probably too strong though). Looking back at stuff like runespan, LRC, and ivy, it could be worse.
---
I've got 81/90/81 for melee with 90hp. I usually do a few on black dragon task. I have a hasta, slayer helm, and treasonous ring. Would the DFS be worth swapping out the treasonous ring for? I usually get 3-6 kills but I just jump worlds until I find an empty one and haven't had any issues with crashing tbh.
---
No you? 
---
Oh okay! Thanks 
---
you have 0 understanding of the word objective, educate yourself

Imagine clicking anything other than the first result on Google

I agree; I'd much rather RC than do agility. I always hear people say "oh but with agility you just put on youtube/netflix/tv and grind away and don't even pay attention". I find this to be false with agility; you need to consistently be turning your camera so you can click on the ledge to continue the course; how is that NOT paying attention?
