I sincerely have a propose to make you, I'm half Venezuelan, my family moved out of it last summer and I know how difficult and fucked up things are over there, since Maduro turned president he can't stop destroying the country and I know how hard life is in there. So hit me on my messages and we can talk about something you might be interested or not. Anyway, mano tienes mi upvote, solo hablo un poquito de espanol pero quiero solo hacer una pergunta, eres de Caracas?

P sure ppl use noted items during super heating cause it's quicker to talk to the banker and un-note them in your inventory than it is to open bank and withdrawal them
---
There's not really a point in enhancing. You're paying 5m just to increase the max charges from 2500 to 20k which is completely unnecessary because you're rarely if ever in a situation where you need that many casts where you're also unable to go to the bank / GE and resupply.  
---
Upgrading to swamp is definitely better than upgrading to seas. As for which is "better" they're both very close in effectiveness so imo it comes down to preference.
---
The swamp does cost more per cast but does more damage on average and you get the venom effect so it's the same reason behind upgrading from Iban's to the regular trident - more DPS = faster runs = more money, even if it costs more to use.
---
Personally I found the swamp to be slightly better but try them both out. If you feel like you aren't noticing a difference you can always detach the magic fang and keep it as a regular trident.

It's best in slot in a lot places, just not in the ones most end-game players care about, such as raids or vorkath.

It is still the best in slot weapon for general Slayer and training. It's just not 160+m worth better.

Not necessarily. Think of them more akin to the Greek Gods, where each represents their own aspect of reality.

There might be a stretch fix mode plugin on runelite, not positive

Yes. Look up the difference between ARM's RISC architecture and x86\_64.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
x86 processors do much more work per clock. So much so that an x86 processor at 1.5Ghz could best an ARM one at 3+. ARM processors are designed to have very VERY small dies. So small they could sit on your pinky nail. x86 processors are comparably very large, sometimes the size of a quarter or nickel. A quad core x86 processor has about as many transistors as maybe 15 flagship ARM chips.
---
It's all about transistors, work done per clock, and clock rate.
---
ARM processors do usually have pretty awesome GPUs, though.

in bs, but many prices in Venezuela are set in dollars because of inflation
---
for example
---
today 22/03 the US$ is in 3200bs
---
then a cellphone costs 70 US$, that is paid to the exchange in Bs, which would be 224k Bs.
---
maybe on 25/03 the US$ is in 3500 bs or more
---
then the same cell that costs 70 US$ will cost 245k Bs
---

30 cents what? You can sell for 0.75 a mil immediatly if you want and the pricrs fluctuate with game updates. Sometimes you can get 1$/1M

If you want to get your combat stats up. Id recommend questing and also slayer. Theres a great quest guide that shows what quests gives exp rewards to narrow it down for you
---
But I should also add: Android is designed to run on these "weak" processors, so the end result is that a clunky piece of shit like Windows on an x86 processor is actually completing tasks more slowly than Android does on a little x86 chip.
---
This is why Apple seems to do so well on benchmarks despite skimping so much on their hardware costs. They design the chip and the software in parallel for years and get some optimizations in place that add extra performance for free.
---
If you ran Android on an x86 processor WITHOUT EMULATING anything, it would erase the entire extended family of whatever ARM chip you put it up against.
---
Pm me your rsn I will give you some tips and a starter kit
---
Try on osrs website. If not, you may have been hacked.

Because of the clue i think.

right now there are actions to change the situation of the country and the current government, but for now there is nothing concrete, the whole country is in expectation, and the world too

I think you're right that it's still currently bannable, my bad. Glad you caught my mistake. It says later on that the summer season doesn't start until 30th March 10 pm, so that's when the ban should be lifted.

It’s lovely
---
Upvoting for support, can’t make it tonight but I’d like to learn soon
---
it is if attempting inferno
---
Antiviruses don't really detect viruses. People who are targetting gamers, etc have always attempted to make their viruses FUD. That's how it's been done for years. If it gets picked up by one antivirus, there isn't a point of them attempting it.
---
Mobile is as secure as your internet / PC is secure. There are malware applications and processes that can run on androids, and if your internet isn't secure technically someone who has access to it could abuse that. The same applies for if you play on any network in a public place, like a starbucks wifi, which can be sniffed. Again, unreasonable and doubtful.
---
As for runelite, it is secure. The entire source code is public and the builds are public and can be decompiled. There is no malicious code. It's not a possibility.  
---
As for the Jagex leak, even though everyone mentions Jed, the accounts effected by it have all been handled if I'm not mistaken. It wouldn't make sense for one account, months later, to suddenly be effected. We don't even know the details of what information he accessed / gave out.
---
So if this did happen, general consensus is that it's something on your computer or network. Backup ur documents, format ur hard drive and reinstall windows.
---
Ffs!
---
Why does it bother you?
---
My thoughts as well... I don't remember and cant imagine why I was out in a dangerous area wearing these items on my ironman but it seems the only reasonable idea. However if I did die this way I imagine I would still have the 3 items?
---
Is it possible the items were stored somewhere because I was in a members zone and was teleported to lumby when I logged on next (with no membership) ? As my bank is full due to no membership?
---
It doesnt
---
Wouldn't really be attempting it below 75 magic personally since Toxic / trident is BIS there and with the stats you provided, iban's blast is really slow; you'd be eating through more ppots than you'd be getting back with rewards.
---
But if your ballsy, Black d'hide legs &amp; top, an MSBI with amethyst arrows (For ahrims) and then use iban's blast for all the other brothers. If your want Reward potential, bring a meele switch, like a d scim, glory etc 
---
Can confirm, killing of animals is still murder, priest made me do 10 hail marys and 5 our fathers ~~5 mins in coat closet~~
---
I just wondered since more complex activities aren't easy to do on mobile and often it is easier for me to get a remote connection to my pc, so I was thinking of using for example TeamViewer to do dailies.
---
And iron arrows nice
---
Dagganoth Kings sounds up your alley.

---
Magic and prayer are the two most important skills for barrows runs. Your prayer looks okay but I would focus on training magic a bit before you go for it or it will take too much time/resources to be worth it. Look up some guides on each brothers crypt location and get into a routine of who you take on first. For example I start with dharok and then go guthan, Karil, ahrim Torag and finally verac. I pick that order because it’s more important to conserve prayer points for the first four brothers bc praying against torag and verac isn’t really necessary.
---
hm, alright. Thanks!
---
I know who you are. You used to be an active pker. You've account shared in the past with clan members, you've also been doxxed by those same clan members. You also willing share other private info in TeamSpeak. It's not a surprise you've been hacked.

Not true. Graceful is frequently refunded for the marks which are expensive.
---
Solak is easily 30m/hr at 4kph in a duo. AOD is also 30m an hour easily. Magister is upwards of 20m/hr with 55kph. Vorago trio is easy 25m/hr with 5kph. Telos is 80 to 120m/hr if you're a god and do streak telos to 1k+
---
Thank for the reply’s guys! So what spirit shield would be the next upgrade besides spectral? If I have maxed melee and sgs and dragon warhammer what would be next upgrade?

Either way, it's not like red bull is the only energy drink you can buy

Is planting limpwurts on farm runs worth it?  I currently has nasturtiums planted to protect my watermelons, but idk if that's worth it.
---
On that note, is there any for-profit farming I'm missing out on?  I'm at 55 rn.
---
Lol 😂 😂😂😂!!!!!! Omg!!! Hahaha@!!!
---
No lol that doesn’t happen. You’d still have them on and theyd be called “members objects” 
---
Graceful can be returned for marks and then used to purchase amylase. They do not take your items in anyway whatsoever when your membership runs out...
---
but then they had the full bank too if they wanted which was left untouched.. It is so frustrating guys.
---
So why would he not be wearing Justiciar helm and top in that case?

I'd legit put 10mil down that it's not new Justiciar. Lol.

Yes it is actually, we don't have to sacrifice our game just because they have live in a crappy country. Why don't you donate your irl money to VENE then? Is your money worth more than the well being of another human bean?
---

---
See, I do not consider most skulltricks in the usual sense a scam. Also I don't consider most luring scams either.
---
Skulltricks, bsing, and lures I don't really consider scams. Like you, I see the value in these as well, perhaps differently though, not cause of the nostalgia effect but I think it creates variety in beating people. Context is important though.
---
Like that one trick where someone comes up to you and shows you money..."I bet you don't have this noob" and makes you follow them and you end up in a pvp zone (further details snipped) ....I hesitate to call that a scam. It's definitely a lure but they didn't really lie to you.
---
I use blessed d'hide for the defense, slight prayer bonus, fairly low weight, and range bonus. You don't need magic attack bonus because the Brothers' magic defense is so low. For Ahrim I use an MSBI with amethyst arrows and Ava Assembler and Anguish because he's the only one with any significant magic defense. For the others I use Trident, but Iban Blast will be best for you. I also bring a melee switch for getting rewards potential (kill 3 skeletons).
---
My path is Ahrims &gt; dharoks &gt; Guthans &gt; karils &gt; Torag &gt; Verac. A lot of people do Ahrims &gt; Karils &gt; dharoks because they're generally the 3 most dangerous so you want prayer for them. You can snare the melee brothers if you're out of prayer but Dharoks can hit super hard if he gets unsnared at low hp.
---
Without a maxed house you can use a ring of dueling to go to Clan Wars to reset your stats.
---
Anything not ******@jagex.com is a scam.

If you don't care to give money to jagex, why not buy 4m from the vennies and then buy a bond ingame? I'm sure you'd spend less money.

Probably using that method with super combats posted not that long ago. Cuts your exp by like 30%, though, compared to overloads &amp; absorbs.

Besides things from 08 and even further have been added already, ghrazi rapier is similar to the chaotic version, the dragon platebody if im not mistaken is also from 08, addy and rune dragons arent even from 08 but even farther then that, other quests, zulrah and a whole bunch of things, which totally different then actual 07.

Sorry for the late reply! The events typically start between 1pm and 9pm EST.

I farmed like 50 barrows with same or worse stats. Ibans staff (u) is key. Bring best tank gear you can and maybe a crossbow switch for ahrim! Your profit will increase with your prayer (as you’ll spend less on pots) it’s pretty easy to do and you can even come back and finish off bosses if you are practicing as it doesn’t reset if you leave. Bring like 4 prayer pots and food etc. maybe melee weapon for kc?

&gt;	not everyone will be aware of every scam, especially the really not obvious ones, and new scams can be made in the future.
---
They are still doing fucking scams that were popular during RS2, they don’t even have to create new ones. Most of them are extremely obvious and can be avoid by simply not trading, droping, or risking your items. The rest of the scams are to manipulate trusting people (the long con, wealthy loaning scams) or people who get tricked into thinking they can out smart the scammers (anti scams). All of them can be avoided easily by just being careful.

RWT from osrs gp into cash is ruining the spirit of the game, but cash to osrs gp is a smart way to restart if you've got an alt or know the game to some extent. Every new player should buy a couple bonds and sell them, it saves you hours on the tedious stuff. 
---
Do you go through your friend's past Twitter posts at parties when they make a joke that offends you?
---
Thank you my man!
---
Nice
---
I would HIGHLY advise getting closer to 80 range... You might get past work, but Galvek has soo much hp, you're really relying on Ruby bolt specs most of the fight. There were 5+ times I had to leave Galvek simply because I was running out of food. Another word of advice, when you do make it to Galvek, if you don't hit at least 2 Ruby bolt specs on phase 1 just reset.
---
I hate those 30 second intros to your channel
---
Yeah there's a YouTube channel that teaches gold farming methods in Spanish 
---
Yes I feel like it's a waste of time. Especially as barrows could have been easily completed in the time it took for the extra exp after 99.
---
Those mole slips should have a dig option
---
no thanks
---
Your dps will be the same. Your max hit with a standard trident is 20 with an attack speed of 2.4 while with Iban Blast it's 25 with an attack speed of 3.0.
---
Damage boosting and magic level boosting stuff will help more with a trident though. An Occult, for instance, adds +2 max hit (10% extra damage) to both Iban and Trident. For Iban that's +2 every 3s while for Trident it's +2 every 2.4s. Trident's damage also scales off level so higher magic = more damage.
---

There's a venezuelan person right here in this thread speaking english. YouTube has CC translations. Gold farming is money making. It's not that difficult.

The colour difference would be the ornament kit, onyxes also aren't red...

All i said is that the shape reminded me of it.

it would be silly to take bets since i don't even know if that's how female justiciar is shaped, as the wiki has quite a wide cloth for the male one.

---
Is your email password the same as your rs account password? If someone somehow associated your rs account with your email they could just check to see if your email was part of a leak, get the pass from that, then get into your OSRS acct.
---
Iirc, you can get two trident hits vs 1 iban hit, so the DPS margin does exist, it's just that at the minimum level for trident; it's max hit of 22 at level 75 (with an occult) has a lower hit than a max of 25 with iban's. 
---
While it may be cheaper, you're gonna be using more prayer potions, so speed is essential.
---
Just use a different password for the email and the account

Haven’t played on OSRS for a few weeks, but I was getting an average of around 7 nests per Mahogany run I would do, which lines up with the wiki. Just sounds like bad RNG on your end. 
---
Random timers are not as clever as you think. Jagex’ bot detection isn’t that primitive. 
---
Random times create new repeating patterns that are easily picked up (being random is a pattern on its own). Humans aren’t random. They’re humans, they display human-like patterns.

Can you please add the ability to note items on a bank as an UIM..? I don't really understand why this is not a thing already. If it has to do with gameplay then noted items shouldn't even be a obtainable thing as an UIM. I find it dumb that you can only get noted items as a drop...... That kinda forces you to pvm to get materials rather then skilling.
---
Same reason I grinder to get the gold trimmed mage robes lol
---
Karils crossbow is better
---
Or just get 75 range for blowpipe.
---
oh so you were trolling alright :D damn you got me. Since you didn't hack my acc I tought you implied that I was cheating 
---
Which is why war is still a thing right?
---
I have already banned two accounts, that is normal here in Venezuela because Jagex already knows that here is the gold farm, I have friends who have lost lvl 90 acc, so you can only sell once and say goodbye to your acc
---
The first time they say "let's go boys".
---
Nah you seem too stupid even for such a simple blue collar no education required job 
---
That one's clearly a Chinese knock off. 
---
Karil is better for a fact? Okay, is the rest of my setup okay if you don’t mind? Veracs helm and skirt, Armadyl chest boots and vams, anguish archers and accumulator with book of law. Ty so much for any advice 😊
---
When has this scenario ever happened lmfao. 
---
Hugodzilla, wolfbane, luispipe...

I have no idea who might be a required item. 
---
Huh. I got 1k and a black scimitar and got asked my gender and age by a random lvl 20 when I rejoined. I noped out immediately and told him to take his stuff back, then he logged without taking it back.
---
His loss I guess.
---
Yeah I guess
---
I use barley seeds.
---
You definitely want desert treasure and dream mentor bosses.  While annoying to kill they give insane point boosts. Besides that, you ideally don't want anything that requires a certain weapon (Family Crest boss or Tangleroot) or can teleport you.

Jagex mods have literally called out people on this sub for using mouse recording software. It’s something they can and do detect.
---
I think it's just 1/100 odds I'm pretty sure it's not a guaranteed drop on 100th chest
---
Why are they annoying to kill? Will just using a melee weapon work?
---
"You don’t get no loot out of it." ﻿ 
---
Because i fucking hate people like you that think it's normal behaviour to single out people and post them on public forums to make fun of them. The fact that you censored your own name tells me you dont want this being done to you. Atleast have the fucking balls to show your own identity, fucking hypocrite.
---
Apparently I trimmed down my original comment for fear people wouldn't read it, and elected to give a standard comment about password safety instead. I am aware. In that regard, make your password as long as possible and avoid standard formats as I said and you can guarantee greater safety. 
---
another reason jagex is idiotic. basic password protections and practices arent even an option, even if they are mostly innefectual
---
&gt;common decency
---
Consistently comments "gay" on a subreddit about "delicious traps"
---
Doubtful
---
\~$4.8 CAD. That's literally a third minimum wage, yikes.
---
All passwords are unique.
---
Yes, the best way to ask for a suggestion is to insult us all, great idea. Way to feel great about yourself.
---
That was 1999 
---
As much as I think this would be a great thing to have, I don't think jagex will ever fully endorse this. They had classic servers for a while but ultimately had to close them because of a cost/benefit analysis. There's just no need for the company to maintain that burden sadly.
---
No I literally did not.
---
yes
---
Must have died the first day at Wintertodt
---
Freaking love this 
---
To get into my email yes.
---
I seriously love this video, I just about split my sides open when you said on death you had to play Rs3 gor an hour! It's too good I have to subscribe and like your stuff now!
---
I ragequit everytime it drops spirit seeds
---
thats why i take notes xD
---
Devious mud, yes. I was referring to the mining game of which I can't remember what it's name. Played that shit for hours. 
---
depends on what your doing.. minimising the app will log you out though. 
---
Dude is clueless.
---
I just legitimately can't tell if your initial post is sarcastic or not
---
No.  The most effective method would be to preplant all the patches, but not harvest them or check the health.  That way there is a chance to complete a contract as soon as you get it, or complete multiple in a row.
---
Truth hurts punk
---
I'm almost tempted to just post the screenshots to show im not seeking attention. But rather it got to the point where it has become a borderline hate crime. But i'm glad you think "im seeking attention." Like i said ive never used Reddit. This is literally me reaching out for some help. 
---
No. I'm not a retard. I wouldn't fall for a phishing scheme
---
Missing a crude chair?
---
Sorry what? Are you trying to internet challenge me or something?? LMfao. Good lord I had to reread this whole thread to remember what it's about, that's beyond pathetic that you would type out a comment to try and actually continue an argument
---
"look who isn't replying now" you actually don't have anything better to do? I feel sorry for you and you clearly need the last word, so go ahead and type some petty reply to make yourself feel like you won an internet argument. I'll be the mature one to not respond because 
---
1) I don't care
---
2) I feel really bad for you
---
RS3 BAD
---
Thanks, I hope it dies down in the next few days. There is a way to set up the friends chat to ranks only if im not mistaken correct? maybe this will completely fix the problem if thats an option?
---
How about a chinaexit? Get Jagex out of Chinese influence after Fukong sells it?
---
Pulovers macro creator. You can use color search to make your own colorbot in AHK real easy with no coding. Just make sure your movements are 1:1 so don't have it move and click in the same action and used randomized delays. Then just rotate what you bot and don't bot for more than 4 hours a day. Easy.
---
While I don't fully disagree, I do think it ruins the early game experience a bit if you just buy your gold.
---
Come back when you remember it I wanna know
---
Omfg, GZ OP!!!!!
---
In Az? That’s hot
---
Yes but using the logic you’re already using, the dry streak isn’t a real thing. It’s the illusion that the roll before is in anyway related to the roll after. To say you are 1,500 dry is to say that the 1,499 kills before the 1500th were in any way related to you not receiving a drop on that 1500th kill. It’s not, so if you want to believe in “dry streaks” you also have to believe in “lucky streaks” as the other end of the spectrum. You are contradicting yourself by giving value to the term “dry streak” but disregarding your prior 6 in 600 kills. 
---
Does that make more sense to you now that I’m elaborating? 
---
holy shit hahahaha
---
You limit yourself to be a f2p and then you're asking jagex to change a reward because you limited yourself, seems legit
---
People who only start making videos becuase they think they can make $$ quick
---
I mean if obtaining the gear/bones while managing ur bank isn't a goal, fair enough...
---
Tf just get rid of it. If it's cool enough to keep its cool enough to take bank space.
---
The level 99 money/h tho
---
Put private on friends, that's literally all you need to do, why are you still posting?
---
IT managing a school's computer lab. Lots of down time between the rushes.
---
coming from what playerbase?
---
Maybe you were just looking for something to furiously reply to.
---
It's true it really did happen and I knew people were just going to downvote me and call me a liar
---
Hell yeah lol. Not gonna lie, going on this sub it feels like people who hate quests vastly outnumber people who like them.
---
Someone said Jagex is aware of the issue and trying to fix it.
---
The bank is literally at the bottom right 
---
Yeah that’s what one of my buddies in game mentioned! I think that might be the next grind
---
392 kills and still dry.. #thisiskillingmeslowly
---
I didn’t call you a liar or downvote you. Just a joke make. Relax.
---
Thank you sir. I'll continue getting 99 fletching. Nothing to see here.
---
I recovered my account and realized it is just not the same game as OSRS, the game I fell in love with over ten years ago
---
Same lol, Got 3 in my first 24 kills.
---
Hard pass
---
I play fixed because that was the only option from 2004-whenever they released the resizable. It feels homey to me and familiar 
---
runescape is tile-based so this is actually surprisingly doable
---
hope you expand to the whole map someday
---
Bring a slayer staff switch: with default spell crumble undead just leftclick the spawn.
---
if you're worried about 1 iteming...it doesn't seem to be as big a problem today as back in the day. Everyone today is more experienced and extra care is given to the "pj period" just after killing someone and looting. Rushing is more profitable and that involves more than 1 measly item.
---
You can already do a couple bosses go do barrows. Get 80’s for combat except prayer. Get 83 con.
---
The GE is closed due to stingrays.
---
NoT rEaL ComMuNiSm.
---
Ahhhhh my bad sorry for letting it fly right over my head I'm freaking out atm my password was just bugged and somehow integrated into the GE as normal text right in front of my face so lmfao
---
Get cheap stackable items (feathers, headless arrows), and do it in the fountain of rune. I got 72 till 75 there. Inexpensive and AFK
---
Ive seen a few posts like this bro, other people have had it happen in different dialogues too. Itd only be client side and not data able to be grabbed by anyone unless they are standing behind you. Surely runelite finds the issue soon :)
---
I believe you haha
---
He's the only rs related streamer that when I see a new video I get excited to watch it.
---
I have faith in you. You are the chosen one.
---
&gt;I'M NOT CRAZY you are the best thank you
---
I agree the game is becoming too easy and the majority of players are all for it. Ironman mode is a sort of fix but limits you to a lot of stuff also. Nothing can be done about it now but there’s no doubt the game is way way easier than it was on its initial release. Maybe group Ironman will help but as much of I love how RuneScape is now I can’t help but think some RuneScape vanilla servers would be good for a lot of players missing the old game
---
He's talking about a melee gorilla switching to either range/mage einstein 
---
Bro this doesn’t fit oldschool at all man. Might aswell release op degradeable armour like they had in rs3
---
What bosses could I attempt at the combat stats I have currently?
---
100% id like a 15 year cape coming up soon! 
---
Hell yeah can't wait to rock those slippers with the ale of the gods! 
---
Organized how ? Lol
---
Oo I’ve never even heard of the fountain of rune before. Thanks for the tip!
---
Cant use a lead on dogs?
---
Shows up after you vote too.
---
By partner said “Lava-egg”
---
That's not very Swampletics of you

I had the same issue last night; after a really bad lag spike, you’re not crazy ahaha:) 
---
But he has to wander, not just sit there
---
0 in 1,000 🥳

Oh shit you're right..

Maybe I should rethink this
---
Oof

100% yes. A million times yes. 
---
How can I get that Runescape sword?
---
He says as he takes the time to litersllly write me a response longer than the on I gave. You seem as invested as me bud, but you can pretend if you want. It’s pretty obvious you’re trying to deflect by pretending to not care

And tormented brace lit kit ,3rd aged skirt
---
Are you in bedrock edition?
---
Idk what that means 
---
Fuck.that.fight.
---
There’s a Runescape Classic Private server available on Android in the google play store it’s a little different but the graphics are what you’d want, I think if you search runescape classic you could find it.
---
I just looked up the fountain of rune. It said there’s no xp granted there?
---
PC is easy mode

A rough estimate suggests it would take him over 7000 steel bars to 66.

Posting the day you created your account isn't wise considering it can be used to recover your account.

When I was f2p PKing I wouldn’t even be safing and they’d still be all:
---
“Safe”
---
“??”
---
“Safer!1!1”
---
I’m sure they just do it to distract. Also the amount of times I’d get approached with a “GL?” While I’m skulled and they weren’t was amusing. Like, yeah go ahead. 
---
Also found it amusing when other 1 def pures would complain about my friends range tank and say “amour off” 😂
---
I miss f2p PKing. I might have to make an alt for it again. 
---
wtf? you can get 4x 275ml for 6 nzd
---
Because its nearly impossible to hit as high as some people eat. Like never ever will you smack a combo big enough to hit 70+ yet a whole load of people sit 70+ lol
---
Are you also illiterate?
---
What's the scaling? Is it 1:1?

 Meet Marxletics, our Soviet Union locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing our Ultimate Ironman we decided to up the ante to forge our own journey from scratch. No inequality, no food, but this time I can't leave the Gulag. All leading up to eventually taking on one of the Soviet Union's biggest challenges: Democracy
---
We need answers
---
I wasn't, I was pretty far away, climbing down the mountain to go to the fairy ring. The loot message just displays that far away, which is why Im a little annoyed about it.
---
more corrupt jagex employees jed was right
---
&gt; The biggest fuck up with the tbow thing was it took them a few hours to decide to just rollback.
---
That is a monumentally huge thing, compared to having to reset some people's stats. They had to shut down the entire game to do it and wipe out likely thousands to tens of thousands of players hours worth of progress. 
---
&gt; I'd argue that any source of coins defaulting to max cash instantly regardless of location is a lot worse then a tbow spawn since it's also a lot easier to track I'd imagine.
---
That wasn't how that bug worked at all. It was to do with the conversion of non-gold items (stacks of items) into coins.
---
E.g. when some of your untradeable items get converted to gold when PKed. 
---
Gz, alch yourself
---
Not good 
---
I get the joke, check my comment history.
---
Lol, O.
---
I was trying to save up slayer points for one, then I realized I could buy emblems, but that would run 3.5-4.5m, so I decided I could just do wildy slayer and get them myself, didn't know if many people knew this.
---
Hmmm I must of gotten a few rewards from it then.
---
What level were you 
---
&lt;3
---
To be fair, it's meant to be worn with obby armour. It probably looks a lot better with its corresponding set.
---
That is the only explanation for them to still be enabled. You can't just get an auth code and bank pin by magic...
---
What about the obvious question were you the one who created the account at the start. Also have you ever let anyone on that may know any kind of recovery questions. 
---
Have you specifically chosen not to enable additional rendering? This looks like garbage
---
I want something inbetween the two, but it definitely needs to be darker imo.
---
A toggle means twice the work for every future update though
---
Oh damn, that's badass! 
---
I’ve played for 15 years. Why would I need to play more?
---
Ya live and ya learn 
---
Not on this account obviously
---
SOM also gets him prayer, crafting and cb levels which are more useful.
---
Sounds like something a botter would say 🤔
---
Only if op puts a hole in it.. for science..
---
At dks if you don't have great gear and stats you sometime end up trying to avoid drawing the agression of Supreme. Depending on how the bosses end up wandering it can be super useful to have greater range.
---
However, most (all?) ranged weapons have a longrange option that increases your range by 2. This has a massive cost to dps, but it works in a pinch. As a result it's not really worth having a dedicated longrange weapon unless you're using something very short range like a bp.
---
For shortbows vs longbows, it's even dumber since a shortbow on longrange is still faster (and thus higher dps) than a longbow on rapid; even though they have the same attack range.
---
Thank you. That helps.
---
Might’ve caught the bot dump all at once 
---
Next level cringe

Unlock all bosses bring ice gloves a cbow and a mist staff. Kill everything you will have in no time

Nah man i almost got dropped on my hcim out at the steel plate spawn. Luckily the punk bitch didn't expect my main to log in. Im way to slow to pk on p2p shits insane i sat at the ge watching fights a few nights when i had members lol looted a few and got 3 hit like rsc days before i could even eat
---
Kdseiler... thank you
---
Firerawks... thanks

I don't believe it has a wield option
---
This is the equivalent of not wacking it for a week and letting all go on Friday. 
---
Old swampletics videos? I would say they are just as good as the newer ones, if not better (mainly because of the progress/unique training). As for older videos in terms of his UIM series they're still good but there is a noticeable increase in quality in the newer ones.  
---
Anyone remember the roll backs they used to do from people being caught botting? They ended up with 20 def and able barrows gloves and turmoil lol
---
Thank you for your input Captain
---
Thanks everyone
---
I don’t want a 3a skirt at all personally
---
Congrats 
---
What are you on about? I said originally you can get two 500mls for $3.80. 4 500mls for $9.80 is a worse deal..
---
Kingdom come deliverance; brb gonna die from a paper cut 
---
No problem man happy scaping 
---
U must not play very hard, bank standing isn't really playing... Or is it the only real method of enjoying the game? 🤔
---
Stupid catch phrases that are forced , imitating other youtubers, mispronounced words in rs. Example, pronouncing rune like ruin
---
I can’t even imagine 
---
yes, it is popular especially for young people, like Tibia...
---
True, but bloodworm looks sort of similar to other pets where as the brothers are unique.
---
You can't just ban anyone you want. If you start banning innocents mistakenly shit goes south really quickly. So you need to be very careful when banning someone.
---
I don't mean just these rng bots, I don't have an answer for why it's not possible to instantly delete them. But I just mean banning in general, it's definitely bad policy to have a Reddit shit storm because of false bans ya know.
---
So training is probably pretty intense because you are directly removing customers from your game.
---
I wonder if we vote yes to grexit, will they run one more poll JUST to be sure if we voted correctly?

I can login to the website on my account settings fine just wont letme login on the game it was fine until I thought sombody was on my other account so I exited all sessions on my accounts and changed the passwords 
---
This would be great!!
---
completely lost it at country jug
---
You're telling me you WASTED law rune? Bruh cmon those things gotta be heckin rare.
---
This may sound picky but I avoid some RS youtubers because their voice annoys me (for example I prefer Torvesta over Framed, Framed just sounds annoyed and monotone a lot). Besides that I just look for whatever content is interesting and unique as a casual viewer. You can't cater to everyone, remember that, some people may love your content and others will never want to watch it, you just have to do something that YOU like otherwise it will be all forced, and nobody likes that at all.
---
And they could bring out more of them if they didn’t waste their time with stupid shit like this. Try thinking before posting.
---
That's where it all went wrong.
---
I have recently come in to a lot of wealth. My cash stack before was never more than 20 mil, usually around 10 because I flip a lot. Anyway, there was a guy at the GE walking around with full armadyl and a t bow and he dropped at least 150 mil worth of stuff in a random drop party. The P.I.D gods must have been with me that day, because I managed to pick up a sara sword, 2 whips, an anguish and an elder maul which just about tripled my cash stack.
---
I really have no clue what to do with 60 mil. Ive just kind of been flipping with it all day. I had been saving up money for construction for a while, so I was thinking that I should start there for spending the money to better my account. I like doing wildy slayer, so I'm going to upgrade my non-risked items for ranged and melee, and I was thinking about cannonning more tasks? I'm not really sure if that's a waste or not. Anyone think they know of a good use for my excess wealth?
---
stats: https://imgur.com/gallery/UXrNOY5
---
I also want to add it seems to be for specific devices or operating systems. My Galaxy 8 has not had a single issue on mobile regarding one tap login.
---
It's probably why it's not more well pronounced around here as an issue due to the fact that not everyone whose on mobile has this problem.
---
I finished it tonight, game has a weird difficulty curve, I'm kind of underwhelmed by the experience tbh, I'd rank it around the same DS3, maybe a bit worse? Definitely better than DS2 though.

Necklace shading is off. Looks too high res

ITT: people mixing up demand and quantity demanded

do not let that shit keep happening there, socialism should be illegal

Wait... Doesn't the "are u a bot?" Tactic work best for banning?
---
This is happening to me now aswell ffs just renewed membs too anyone know a fix?

Did you force close the app and try again? I had this the other day and I’m pretty sure I did that and it worked.

S10 lineup this year is really good. Got an s10+ and I'm loving it. Battery life is outstanding.

Thanks bro

i just play hard mano, one acc at a time

But what if I don’t win the fishing contest 😪
---
I’ll recognize robots as sentient beings the day they are  advanced enough to be allowed to play Runescape without getting banned.
---
Or maybe the weight increase is accurate and the bow actually stores the energy of 10 megatons of TNT, about 666 times what was dropped on Hiroshima. 
---
He’s lame lol
---
Would need a toggle. I use the left for scrolling
---
WHATS GOING ON YOU LITTLE COCK KNOCKERS!!!!
---
It's not the look of the Diary gear I don't like, it's that you need to be level 90+ in numerous skills yet it's only as good as adamant. Doesn't have to be as good as Justicar, just better than it is now.
---
If he's that mad about pixels EVEN if you said you would grind it out, you're in a seriously abusive relationship. I'm not trolling or anything, you should let him go.
---
Dealing with inferior controls doesn't make building take more skilll. It just takes a bit longer. 
---
Okay you solved my problem but not exactly how you wrote it.
---
So totally it's about date and time.
---
But my account (and myself) are British and I'm currently on business in Sydney, so setting the time to GMT and having another go solved my issue.
---
Wow. What a fucking shit.
---
Thanks dude. 
---
Less effort to move than pray flick constantly. Although when not recording I just face tanked with bass. Generally when doing things for a longer time it's easier to do the less effort ways. 
---
Xbox does. Sony refuses to add cross-play to any PS4 games. 
---
what has this game gone to
---
That about sums it up! It certainly isn’t good, but if you want an afk zenyte, you can get an afk zenyte :)
---
W1 is dying , bots have taking over the game and jagex won't do shit  about it.
---
I was waiting for it

Imagine he slowly created all of lumby fally and varrok lol

No, you're the only one who remembers.

It's not harder, just takes longer. BP average for me at least is 2 min 30 ish to 3 mins, depending on BGS spec. Grind the fuck out with his DHCB cos it cuts through vork like butter

This is amazing! I cant wait to see more progress on this. Great job
---
They had chainmail under the plate for this reason 
---
I posted m8 got the kc wrong but still shit 2520 dry

Yeah had it happen twice
---
Eh I doubt it. He had a lot of subscribers.
---
Honestly if this was an honest option, I bet a lot of people would go for it. 
---
what bolts are best? should I keep using ruby and diamond dragon bolts ? 
---
Geez! I thought my 1k dry streak was bad. 
---
Yea i dont get it. F2p is so bland i bet you they drive away a lot of players
---
I swear I read this exact post a couple of days ago with people in the comments quoting him also.

They’ve done it twice after the initial referendum vote lmao

SHINGAURDS NEED STRAPS OR THEY WILL FALL DOWN TO ANKLES!

Its ridiculous there wont be anyone in the office till Monday aswell they better give me 3 days membership cause thats what I'm wasting 
---
What?
---
As long as you’ve unlocked dragon defender 
---
, you have permanent access to the basement, regardless if you do/don’t have any other defenders on you/in your bank
---
Ahhhh gotcha. Yeah I didn’t know you can poke him again, thanks!
---
so for the teleport to lunar isle, that’s not the waterbirth teleport is it? I already know where I’m gonna put this portal room tbh lol, right next to my pool
---
Restart
---
Yo im getting membership tomorrow so i dont have too right
---
Yea didn’t even think of that actually. If this makes it to the top maybe they’ll still see it on Monday and can respond, but I doubt it to be honest.

*Eyy, another year!* It's your **1st Cakeday** vanexii! ^(hug)

Jagex done fucked up again.

Venezuela has the capability to have oil prices tank and still be rich as hell. They have a shit load of minerals, natural gas. There is mines that have so much gold, that they cant even calculate it. Their location is prime. They get no earthquakes, they got tropical weather, hurricanes dont hit them. Their land is super fertile, they have a saying, if you spit into the ground, a saliva tree will grow.
---
Their population is 32m. Not a whole lot, so the amount of resources needed to provide quality social services to the people aint that hard. They have spectacular jungles, deserts, beaches, snowy peaks great for tourism.
---
In other words, Maduro is playing Civ in super easy mode and somehow still managed to collapse the whole country. So lets not kid ourselves with the whole, 'prices tanked so venezuela tanked' rhetoric. 
---
I used a DPS calculator. Show some evidence for your claim
---
You can also mess up bots by punching them with boxing gloves
---
theres just like 50 level 3 bots parroting stuff thats said in chat

Put a GE at priffdinas, no more bots or else their accs are high skilled or bought

Yeah its stupid I changed my pass cause my alt was breached and exited all sessions try to re login and it does this what a joke hopfully one of the mods can sort it from home that's if there even aware of this bug can you report bugs from the website?
---
The point of a zerker is that the 45 defence is quested so u have barrows gloves, gl though maybe watch a guide or 2
---
Can you give the ducks a stroke or two for me? They're good ducks and they deserve it.
---
Its better is you do
---
Via the favor menu 
---
Please, dont talk about things u dont know, the "famous" ones have nothing compared to top tier pvmers, who use runelite and take same security measurements lol. Zulu is as close at it gets, but pretty sure his account is also protected and cannot be recovered, but thats irrelevant. You fucked up somewhere and the sooner you find the problem, the faster you can keep going on, but dont start bullshiting here, ty. Mod jed went rogue on rival clan players which were only few players out of millions.
---
Right thanks
---
Hmm didn’t know rule breaking was encouraged now. Interesting. 
---
for when you're doing clues and dont need spade
---
Little did he know.....

Damm, there is a nice little button there, I guess ive never actually look at that tab really, thanks a lot

Thanks for the feedback, anything specific you liked most about the glory charging?
---
I don't get why he didn't start the mith plate grind until he actually got the clue that needed it. And he kept the clue on him... does dropping the clues after you do a step no longer save the progress?
---

Obtained after making history, I think. You get an enchanted key which you can use to find treasure.
---
is the reason for 11$ and jmods getting fuck all salary, whilst Jagex make record profits
---
Honestly the guy is correct. How can you fault him for "bug abuse" when this is not his fault its entirely jagex. 
---
It’s not encouraged and I’m not encouraging it, just sick of people botching Bout it all the time
---
I love it
---
So then let them make their own account.

Looks like their left hand was one space over to the left.
---
Y’all are legit fucking retarded. “Drop the cunt” is your reply? White knights really need to get impaled already. 
---
Smh all these noobs. Block all roads/exits in this way:
---
Dig a trench 4 deep to block them, then add a sign to the side of the top blocks in the trench and place a carpet matching the colour of the ground/road on the sign. This will look clean and no mobs can cross it as they don't see sign nor carpets so they just see it as a hole and can't jump down as they won't do that if it's too deep.
---
2000 IQ Minecraft knowledge.
---
Another solution:
---
Command blocks. Have them check if the dog/wolf is too far and then teleport it closer. I am pretty sure this can be done no problem.
---
Thanks! Definitely an upgrade from slayer gloves.
---
wave3: SELLING 7 LOG
---
I mean, I’ve played for years and never pked so I figured rushing could be a fun way to get familiar with switching and speccing. If I shouldn’t rush could I pk with these stats? 
---
I think the jokes just landed a bit better like...
---
"6 people told me to kill myself and I think the rest were bots" pretty accurate runescape experience 
---
"Like every girl I've ever matched with on tinder.."
---
It had an extra comedic factor to it because trading uncharged + a few k for charged glories used to a legit thing back in the day
---
this is real and not staged! nice pic!
---
Good additions thanks for the feedback
---
Wtf lmfao
---
Probably a visual glitch don't worry
---
Thanks for the explanation 👍
---
Thanks
---
needs more upvotes, puts all those other pure build videos to shame
---
Pressing the return button on your phone closes current interface, smooth brain.
---
Review above comment thread 👍🏼 thanks for your opinion
---
Die
---
Yeah you could edge pk with those stats, nobody will be stronger with the same gear and people around your cb level will have similar stats. Just give it a go rune sets to pk in are like 200k.. do you have 94 mage?
---
Tbh idk how to prove it wasnt staged. I was hopping around in ghostly robes looking for rwt'ers and came across this unfolding in front of me
---
Not joking i did a 1000 eclectic challenge vs my friend and genuinely i went 250 dry
---
No but I plan on getting 94 mage in the next few days. So just rune sets and gmaul for spec? D scim as main weapon? 
---
You got 3 messages? And?
---
that would make sense if there were 2 versions of a heavy ballista and 2 versions of a light ballista.
---
🦀 POLL RESULTS STILL NOT HIDDEN 🦀 
---
Mage 75, enables you to wield a trident, an extraordinarily useful tool when it comes to battling various npc in osrs... and get your range to 80 :)
---
Is this actually bannable?
---
Everyone form a line and let the vampires bleed you. It’s for the common good. 
---
If i was starting out i would just go welfare for a bit.. neitz, torso, rune legs, fire cape, climbing boots, rune gloves, str ammy, drag defender. You can upgrade bits like drag boots barrows gloves if u wanna risk some more.
---
Get 94 mage for veng before u go
---

Hello there fellow agent.
---
I guess we're both fucked from the green poison because I sure as hell don't have a gas mask.
---
What sort of PvP updates do pkers want? Genuine question.
---
Yes, you receive a rune spear (kp) as part of the reward regardless of which spear you give during the quest. 
---
Whats wrong with seeing poll results?
---
i dont care just stay out of my wilderness
---
You get a rune spear kp from completing the quest.
---
you lucky fucker you
---
got mine at 1684kc...
---
Bud it’s a joke. You think I give 2 shits about a tinder profile? I found it funny, so I posted it. If you don’t that’s fine. Everything okay at home man? You need to talk to someone? Drink a beer smoke some weed and chill. Way too damn toxic. I think r/LeagueOfLegends would be a better fit for your toxicity
---
Maybe it is
---
何?!
---
Is also the reason for RS3 as a whole.
---
thank God i can sleep now
---
go in the trouble brewing cc, ask anyone in there to do it. (or one of ur friends lol to afk with u for 20 mins)
---
You don't even have to win the game, just afk until timer runs out to complete task
---
This is my favorite thread 
---
I use them once a week. Its quite fun. Lol
---
I honestly can’t believe how he was consistently one key over as well. Pretty amazing. 
---
Design is okay but the model looks shit. Real shit
---
not "regularly" (as in a set date) but yes they do it rarely and they usually make a big deal about it
---
Best off task rune dragon setup? Bandos vs justicar?
---
Hi again. If you still have the DHCB you can use this as a general guide for effiency:
---
"I've got 99 range/elite void/dhcb/dfw with no rigour or pegasians and I'm hitting ~1:45 average kt. I switch ruby bolts off at 400 and switch pray off during both zombie+acid phase. I don't wooxwalk during acid phase because it's not worth the trouble IMO. I eat up to 2 times during zombie phase and eat to full during acid phase and avoid eating during damage phases as much as possible (aka only eating when I'm below 30 and see a magic attack about to hit)
---
Inventory for myself is bolts switch, 1 range, 1 anti venom, 1 extended s.a.f, 2 pray pots, rune pouch with dust/chaos/law's and rest sharks. I repot ranged potion after every 3-4 drops (check when your max hit drops tbh)
---
Make sure you have done dream mentor and have built lunar portal in poh as that's the fastest banking method (faster than fremmy boots 4).
---
P.S: Get DFW asap because it gives a +15 range bonus and a massive +26 magic defense over anti drag shield"
---
When you give back the DHCB, your gear upgrade priority should look like: Buy DHCB, buy dfw and then sell for rigour, buy dfw again, buy pegasians.
---
If you have any more questions let me know
---
Cuz if u are above 20hp u literally cannot die lmao 
---
Fake
---
If you are melee Vork, which is same kills/h as dhcb Vork and is becoming the new meta if you have Inferno cape. It’s actually beneficial to bring SotD and use Vengence.
---
Gap years are smart and should be encouraged. Fuck teachers that push you straight to uni.

I thought it was a funny post bro keep on doing you.

Someone will get it... then they'll post it on reddit. Then there'll be a public outcry. /konar sara brews.

Don't really care where I had you, but to be honest anyone who engages in that line of thinking are exactly that.  It's very dangerous and 90% of the time they don't realise the irony they're bathing in.

I use emblem area. Make sure to use a middleman and leave cc/turn off private when obtaining the emblem. Costs 2m - 2.1m including mm fees

You do realize you're bathing in irony yourself by calling people disgusting little cunts?

That quest with the dagganoth queen legit took me three attempts because I misclicked on teleports 
---
You talked to oziach? 
---
how can you depth first search in osrs
---
ToB is best, followed by CoX.  
---
After that it's probably Hydra, Vork, and Zulrah.  
---
Others that are decent are Rune Dragons, Demonic Gorillas, and GWD Bosses.

Don't be like me and forget I had a med clue burried in my bank. Spent an hour opening magpie jars and selling the content until I figured I already had a clue

if there should be, I personally dont know any, here we dont use bots because using a Venezuelan IP jagex is very aware of the activity of our accounts and making the slightest illegal use and you win a ban
---
The skirt needs more than just some recolouring lmfao
---
I find that it's not as bad as it used to be. If you start with a quick scroll it doesn't happen.
---
Well yeah you and your family could if there were a few million of you and you could trace your lineage from a certain part of the world and all had a similar genetic makeup and appearance.
---
Plz no rs3 lol
---
Sadly it's probably being botted on currently and will be banned for it.
---
Yeah you’re a moron. For one, the Leuchter report is heavily flawed and has been criticized and debunked in several different ways by experts of the fields in which he made his claims. Take off the tin foil
---
You deserve your mute

Grow up

You clicked the private cave portal then

It sounds like you are still learning game development which is great, keep it up!

Id say if you're feeling confident enough check out the engine 'Godot', it is incredibly powerful, easy to learn and I think you would enjoy the step up!

There is loads of tutorials out there to get you started, YouTube is a good place to look =)

“ hard workers can still get better rewards” that’s where you’re wrong buddy

Well yeah true. I was just thinking that players could pass by. Also I forgot barrier blocks existed.

I have bgloves. The idea was that it'd be funny to watch people try doing barrows for years to get gloves because they don't understand probability.

Oh, you're one of those people, that's why you don't get it

You aren't even reading the dialogue. Not really qualified to judge them as "not fun".

Monetary gain vs finding pure entertainment in playing the game

it's not meant to be used as a weapon, just as a weird flex

Damn is that all you got 😄

40m for 14 days of protection. You go naked to revs on total world and ask them. They give you their discord for more info.

I just want it to match the plate body. Whatever color that is just use it.

np retard keep giving your 'slayer profits' to rigged bots :') might motivate me to make my own dice bots

Answer yourself this: what would be the difference between you setting up a robot with a random time interval, that physically clicks a button between a script that imitates the click that also has a random time interval.

Ahhh good ol' Slu1. Used his house for most of my 99 prayer training.

Oakdice should do that for you.

How do all of these HCIM have the reaction time of a snail while also not even paying attention to the game?

Nice.

I had an account get hacked and it went from like 50 to 89 strength killing green dragons, too bad it's like 42 def it could've been a good account, but it was banned and i was wondering why (i hadn't played on it for very long), so I sent in an appeal and it got unbanned and unlocked.
---
I mean, it’s not like they is empirically saying quests aren’t fun, it’s just not fun for them.
---
Lol that's where vz usually drop trade. Some dude did a video snagging piles.
---

Regen brace and an untrimmed str cape

Venez gold trades be happening up there all the time
---
Your parents blocked purchases from your SIM
---
&gt;  I’m not sure what to do to make him forgive me? 
---
well if he's holding a grudge for you accidentally dropping his cape ask yourself what would happen if something not so trivial happened 
---
sounds like he's a dumb bitch, if my gf did that (knowing rs or not) I'd probably laugh it off and tell her it's no big deal, would probably be the same if it happened with infernal cape or something wiht more value. it's like being angry about an infant throwing up or something since you did it accidentally
---
There was a popular YT video of someone crashing them and taking the dropped loot. Not sure if they even use that spot anymore though to be honest.
---
As a mobile only btw with fat fingers, I support this idea!
---
No planning, just went for it with prior knowledge of questing, so in that case, too many hours on rs would do :p
---
Lool
---
Is there a tool for calculating most efficient xp money? 
---
I'm curious to know at what point paying lots for fast xp and making up the difference with zul/vork isn't worth compared to say slower methods that profit
---
Like I can manually do some math but for example given 10 hours, how would it look to do gold at blast furnace and pvm, or to just do steel/whatever at blast furnace.
---
I know in general it's better to do faster methods but some fast methods are super pricy
---
I tried doing that but ran into a minor issue, walls in runescape dont take up a square/block, they are on the edge of each square.
---
Drew G is my man
---
yeah but if he does get ko'd he will unequip his dfs... that's not worth it ..
---
people would say they were selling or buying the group gatestone as a means of saying they were either getting rid of it or wanted it.
---
look at the angry nerds who'd cry if they lost their grace cape downvote you
---
I think word 'abusive' is a bit harsh but yeah getting angry and holding a grudge becuse of something so trivial is not a good sign
---
How can you wield the power of the fairies if your staff is in your bag

the amount of time wasted on endless slayer updates.

You could briefly smuggle items out of Daemonheim

Very carefully =]
---
They’ve been there for months lol.
---
this lol, watch sad nerds who've never seen a pussy downvote
---
Would also be heaven for rushers to decide who to rush first
---
Lots if hostility in these comments lol nice job my guy
---
no i was there the whole week without getting pkd
---
Just chin before you complete the quest?
---
Which movie is this from?
---
So I somehow got a Vengeance proc on my pure with 68 magic.... got the text and everything to show up. Was wearing a ring of recoil. Wtf jamflex?
---
I can't imagine it would be hard to make it so pures wouldn't be able to continue RFD. There is a need to change this part of the game though and I cant see why not when pures can already do it prior to completing the quest. The ¨age¨ of these kind of things shouldn't really make them immune to change.
---
Watching guides is not the norm.
---
My morning coffee is $8m 
---
The spam and phishing seems to be ramping up lately and it’s getting pretty annoying.
---
So you’re saying an obby cape and granite gloves are better than a strength cape and regen bracelet? 
---
You are either trolling or autistic, and I don't mean that in a mean way lol. Nothing wrong doing content without watching guides or videos but you never thought in your time doing kills, "Man, maybe this 60 dmg every time he does a crab phase is avoidable?"?
---
Usually skillers that can’t equip their steel axe because their attack stat is too low use the torch. Other than that no reason too
---
So what, why should that matter. Whats the difference to you.
---
I don’t add people in the game because I don’t usually talk in the game unless I have to. Just how I am. Also, the trouble brewing world is completely dead. Nobody plays it anymore. So, I will wait for someone to message me on here that needs to do it.
---
Have you ever misclicked the zombie twice in a row and had to watch powerlessly while it blows up on you...
---
Suddenly no one is “able to do one”.

You’d have to have the idealistic, naive brain of a toddler to agree with anything about communism, lol.

everyone offering you pvming and events. Join akira28 were mostly friends on there we have discord and all of us get a long. Not a big clan but we tend to just have fun and teach teh noobs about bossing and some of us are learning raids at our own pace no rush no requirements

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ring_of_wealth
---
RoW only affects the RDT. The RDT is filled with empty slots, you can hit it and get no drop, ring of wealth removes every single empty slot, guaranteeing a drop. The ring never affects normal drop tables.
---
Nice 
---
seems like a fake post jagex doesnt fix anything that fast,,,,

DopaMine grants a gift to reward your efforts at random.

DopaOurs steal XP from other players to give to you in the form or a small XP gift. Note: overhead exceeds unsustainable amounts, XP may be so small it’s not worth it. 
---
What was chest 3772?
---
Wait, I have a question. If Konar assigns me 150 dust devils in the smoke dungeon, can I boost infinite ammount of time having the slayer bonus? Or there is no slayer bonus? 
---
To be honest, I was skeptical I would ever get it back after hearing about jagex support over and over on this reddit, so getting it back came as an extremely pleasant surprise lol 
---
A cooking cape is the runescape equivalent of walking around with a "kick me" note on your back.
---
First off, deal with it, it’s never gonna change. Second off, get 65 slayer and burst dust devils.
---
Sounded like Sarcasm to me

Why would u not just safespot that boss?

Or just use the shift click ?

I did firecape on rs2 _with_ prayer and thouhht that was a hard enough challenge. Is there a new technique on osrs for cheesing Jad?

My alt btw. But the main point being there's no way you should have made the cash for justiciar and dont even have rfd done and I'm assuming haven't killed Jad either 
---
Nice last week this happend to me also dont even use google translator weird af
---
He's practicing you moron. Do you know how many people do that...?
---
if we were not in this situation I'm sure we would play OSRS for fun, OSRS becomes annoying for just making money making, but we know is only for that... Thanks for the support!
---
Ah yeah forgot about the lack of consistency with armour sets
---
That’s literally the room I use to drop trade from my Ironman. 
---
Yeah but they have small peepees
---
BuTtHeN WhErE wOUld ThE sKiLl bE??
---
If you're fighting someone you trust it would be better not to wager gp though the arena and just pay though trade after the fight. That way you avoid the arena tax
---
make sure to have good acc decurity
---
Just started on my normie account, 36 chests dry :(
---
Just ignore them and they will go away
---
Why do you care what other people do though, it’s not hurting you in absolutely any way, buying bonds would provide people with free membership, RWT on the other hand is a different story... 
---
Are you too lazy to press shift?
---
Lol no your right. In rs2 I'd only play once or twice a week, and my main (which is now on rs3 obviously) is decently high level, but never got any rare drops really at all. Now I've been playing osrs almost every single day since I started playing about 4 months ago and here we are.
---
Tabs are a waste of money when you can use crumble undead and house tele in the same pouch. The tip here is to just not click on house teleport. lol
---
“Everything you said +1!”
---
Ignore the retard with the "1o miL A dAy" shit, you have base 50 stats acc, so you should focus on 2 things: combat stats and money. 
---
Gaining access to dragon weapons is a must, do Waterfall quest for combat xp, Lost City for dragon longsword/dagger, Monkey Madness for dragon scimitar and other smaller quests on the side. Get slayer up and pick up all loot. Your first tasks will be horrible loot wise but later you get herb drops and stuff that'll give u like 100k/hr profit. 
---
Eventually you should be able to profit with slayer enough to buy bonds without having the need to kill green dragons. The 1m/hr profit starts rollin in only when u get like base 80 stats to kill bosses. 
---
I’m ashamed I didn’t get it 
---
Once again, I am not asking to be removed, just moved upwards for a matter of consistency. 47 Farming IS NOT AN EASY requirement.
---
I wish this YouTube series had a stronger more historical edge to it. Discussions about how things were, what happened when, and how it came together in the play style of that time.
---
Using Ava's Accumulator with Rune Arrows (I'm not expecting it to collect them, just using it for the ranged bonus) and very few rune arrows are dropping. Is this some kind of bug where it destroys way more arrows than normal?
---
Good Lord, what is happening in there?
---
The disrespect of not having a POH teleport in all spellbooks.
---
I wonder what my pet mole is gonna think when I wear these slippers
---
That is a solution for level 3’s
---
Also, I completely agree that a lot of the arguments against him are lazy &amp; poorly constructed.

I also wouldn’t say he’s wrong. To conduct research and form an opinion based on your own research is admirable, given that the same research allows others to have an opinion too.
---
I think it's Paul Denino doing it FBI raided him this week
---
Lavas have been diasbled for a long time
---
I doubt it's possible for a single account. 
---
False, level 3s cant afford teletabs
---
More cushion for the pushin
---
How come lavas have special mechanics?
---
Probably trying to evade bans.
---
Sounds like you know you’re wrong buddy :( 
---
Iron life 
---
R
---
I never said I'm wrong, theres nothing wrong with the teletabs we have now, they are convenient to use especislly when you are not in regular spellbook, it offers a 1 click panic teleport, it saves spaces that runes will take up, etc etc.
---
It would make sense to me that admins should just walk around osrs and ban bots on the spot that they find. 
---
You can lookup 10 defence with turmoil, veng and barrows gloves.  So a zerker rolled back to 10 def for botting among other stats lol.
---
Yes it is.
---
Are you iron by any chance?
---
how is it bizzare? 2200/23 = 95,65
---
Well you can sell the jar
---
it's no fun to calculate that way, just take the best-case of it being 1st and 2nd.  otherwise it'd be:
---
 (x choose 2)\*(1/512)^(2)\*(511/512)^(x-2) where x is number of kills.  
---
I also like using during slayer when I’m too lazy to pick up coins. Which is always. 
---
No I play on my main, I have a HCIM that I play once a week or so
---
This screenshot isn't really relevant. The comment chain is talking about "what he would have to get through *in the future*"
---
some great counter arguments, keep it up
---
he's 100% right buddy
---
The entire premise of your comments here was addressed in the video. You deserved snarkier responses than you've got so far tbqh. 
---
Good stuff man, got the quest cape yet?
---
You tagged the wrong guy lol
---
Dev's arent here to cater to your specific self imposed limited gameplay style. You chose to be an iron man, deal with the consequences like the rest of the adults on iron man accounts. Kids need to stop whining about making everything easier or else this game is going to turn into RS3 more quickly than it already is.
---
Yeah no, why even get 99 construction if they did that?
---
Teletabs. Nuff said
---
Just admit ur wrong lol 
---
Vorkath does not give you 2m/h at 80 range. You are misinforming people, thats my point.
---
Do u think of it was in every spell book it would help iron/non iron at all? Instead of making it a necessity to get 70 (or boosted) construction 
---
for a whopping 25k D:
---
I wont lol. My New phone is way faster than my old netbook, no way in fucking hell a 2gb , old laptop is faster. its just retarded and factually wrong. fuck off retards
---
Ye they took it down cause you’re brain dead lol
---
Not everyone only got 1/2 xp
---
Source played more and was a bigger part of the cheating community.
---
His content is definitely refreshing. It's just that all the hype and low-effort memes get stale after a while. Yes I know you like swampletics, yes I know you are waiting for the next episode everyone is,...
---
Hijacking this to note that getting a mithril plateskirt on a UIM is a billion times easier than on a Morytania locked Ironman, because there are NPC shops that sell it somewhere (Al-kharid or Keldagrim IIRC)
---
Combat bracelet &gt; Barrows gloves
---
That doesn’t make sense sir 
---
Elite is the hardest requirement in the game so it already makes it fair, so yeah this is a good suggestion.
---
At the time of this writing, thank you for being one of I think 3 people being nice. You're wonderful!
---
W330 or bounty hunter world for POH
---
reqs 10k gp to buy a house at falador construction npc so you can tele to the portal and benefit from 99con from someone else
---
EZscape
---
I’m in the same spot you are. I got 99 cooking/fishing and do sacred eels by zulrah.  Make about ~270k an hour with cape and cooking gauntlets. I would say it’s fairly afk but you will have to click one every minute or so with the spot moving unless you get lucky and have a spot not move for a bit
---
Goodness that’s a lot of barrows runs lol. Any particular reason why you do it so often?
---
people have a high tolerance for learners if you're up front about it. learning the basics in a group is much faster and frankly more fun. group with your friends and start gaming.
---
What he means is that there is no way a human can perfectly make the same motion every time with all the mouse movement involved in 3 ticking. A bot on the other hand would be able to make the exact same pattern every single time.
---
Therefore, if the anti-botting software detects someone moving in exactly the same pattern and clicking at the same intervals for hours on end it would flag that account as a bot, for this reason more advanced bots do actually incorporate some randomness in their movements and clicking intervals to evade this.
---
Botting isn't hacking...
---
At the time of this writing, thank you for being one of 3 people being nice and actually saying something nice. 
---
You're wonderful!
---
How about the documentary David Cole in Aushwitz?

Ssshhhhhh, don't tell them!

Fair enough

70 const isn’t the problem for me it’s just an idea that doesn’t seem so wild 
---
I just got my first ever 99 a week ago, but it was fletching so I knew the hate it might get. As long as we know younger us would be proud, that's all that counts!
---
I sometimes report people because they're annoying me. 
---
Tf is that mean
---
Big if true. 
---
Stop buying gold
---
You think its better than sharks and anglers?
---
25 hours in a month? That’s like 40 minutes a day lmao 
---
I just checked cml, you have the highest hardcore 10hp melle xp. Next is artisti with 4m str, then woofs with 2m attack. 
---
Haven’t boss
---
Pet is actually an additional roll, so you don't lose anything.
---
but if you do loads of vorkath surely you research how to do it better and faster for more kills per hour? by the sounds of his original comment he has done a fair bit of vorkath
---
This is like the millionth tinderletics post though. It's getting old
---
&gt; I'm not expecting it to collect them
---
why?
---
&gt;very few rune arrows are dropping. Is this some kind of bug where it destroys way more arrows than normal?
---
the accumulator is collecting your arrows.
---
Dude is salted over an open fire. Literally tried to argue with every person who commented lol. 
---
My younger self would go rub it in my friends faces lmao. 
---
Just wait until you have money and can buy pretty much anything you want. Money is so easily obtained whereas pets aren't. 
---
Hmm maybe just because something isn't broke for you, doesn't mean it isn't a broken experience for other people.

I agree, it is convenient, but a little too much so.

This is not me btw
---
I see Woox Surfing
---
Yeah you’re right, it is easy for iron man then /: construction is chill and quick thats not my concern but since it’s chill and easy that makes sense 😂
---
I have money, it's just that I literally could not care any less about a pet that does nothing for me. Getting one as a drop is as exciting for me as getting my 800th grimy guam leaf
---
Gz I’m at 650kc waiting for pet 
---
Vote no on polls then
---
Can we talk about how this post has more upvotes than the actual video? Like it on YouTube guys, don’t just upvote it here!

Some people find it fun.

Haha maybe I’m recreating the titanic and not trying to teleport.

Its always sunny in Philadelphia

Anyone else get so tired that you just try to teleport to your bed?
---
In b4 your friend’s main gets banned and claims he’s never botted.

Nah but report does nothing.

It’s a good goal for sure

People are using them in raids so they can use fire surge on ice demon easier possibly.

Cannon caged ogres. Set an auto clicker with random intervals and it is undetectable.

You can disable depositing worn items... I have to do that on mobile because I *always* deposit worn items on mobile.

I stream for fun. I definitely don't make money and attention I could take or leave (certainly none right now). It can be a community aspect to it for people that approach it as a hobby.

Part time Ironman btw here,
---
47 farming is ez
---
Sharks with a harpoon are trash and like ~110k. Anglers are about ~160k if I remember right, just above cannonballs. You could always do that. Three minutes afk and 150k an hour. I’ve tried a lot of different things so if someone has something better I’d love to hear it.
---
Almost as if the people going to 330 to do prayer or use someone's house will turn auto chat on in order to find a host...

Oh right - even stronger point then :p

Whatever luck the dude gets in barrows, he's paid for with that DWH grind hahah

I dont see why they would care if admins did this on their free time tho.

Oh boy, a thread about politics in a video game subreddit. This will be great!

Well it's an exaggeration but wintertodt mostly

Lol there's one like this in the Camelot bank where if you trade someone when they're standing in a certain spot, you'll get put outside the bank. Saw some guys trying to lure with this saying "EPIC DP / TRIVIA MEET IN CAMELOT BANK W325" and they had guys with the rock ring outside the bank.
---
Dang freaking neat dude neato good shit this is damn neat 
---
Hiding from what? I did move the goalposts a bit, won't deny that lol, but the guy I responded to originally was wrong and never responded. For me, that's a "win" and I'll never accept otherwise. If randoms like bigretard49 didn't come in and actually have some decent points(only 1 really) then nothing would have came from it. At the end of the day, I took issue with how a comment was worded and the implied impact of a very small youtube series and I got shit on by the reddit hive mind. Nothing new happening here
---
I think the only one we know for sure is that dragon axe is about 10% more efficient than rune axe, and if crystal axe passes, it will be about 15% more efficient than rune axe.

OSRS IS A 5 STAR GAME!

i’m guessing he prolly played more some days

Ok. Thanks!

So sometimes when I'm doing Barrows, the 6th brother doesn't spawn. I feel like it happens when I fail one of the door puzzles but I'm not 100% sure. Is this bug/intended and can I spawn him in those cases by just going through a million doors?

Play on PC

Probably cuz brits call it lasagne

Also lasagne is plural and we already know people aren’t just eating one pan of it

"because if you take 92/99, but then you use each as the exponent of appoximatly 110.4% as the base to model the ratio of expeewence, you get (1.104)^92/(1.104)^99 = 0.500, which is appoximatly HALF!"

How are you making 5000 runes an hour ?

when you bad english but stil try make post:D

If it's literally making you angry, perhaps you should change your perspective on what "luck" is. It can be an enjoyable mindset to consider it like a resource if your that type of person but it's really not a resource, and especially if it's making you upset it's not a good idea.
---
'Luck' is just a descriptor, getting a rare drop does not negate your potential for future RNG rolls. That rare drop was always a part of the drop table, rolling it did not negate another drop, the odds are always the same. 
---
reddit userbase

well fuck my life :) but thanks for the help

At the height of my drinking problem I used to accidentally compare monetary purchases to amount of beers all the time... 
---
Like I would think “damn this mini-golf was fun but I could have had 5 and a half beers for that price” without even trying. It was one of many parts of a wake up call. 
---
Expected some truth from god Ash based on title.  False advertising.
---
LOL
---
Possibly it's fun to be part of a community? Rather than fun just for attention
---
My wrist hurts from watching that
---
I think it's already stupid broken tbh. I think a lot of people misunderstand how the math works for it. A 50% chance to not consume a bone doesn't result in a 50% xp increase over gilded, it's more like 100% increase, because the bones can be used more than twice as long as they keep hitting the 50/50 chance to not be consumed
---
wtf
---
Seriously? 😂
---
Idk man even at my worst I’ve never been depressed enough to consider that 
---
If you think about it, 3 mil for 75 smiting levels ain't too bad lol
---
Ah yes, Jagex, owners of Twitch, had so much to do with this!
---
I wonder if the owner of at least one of the phishing streams getting doxed on here 2 days ago is related though lol?
---
Do Arceus Library for RC while it still exists, I imagine Jagex will nerf it to the ground once reddit catches on to how broken it is.
---
There are wayyyy more obscure areas than that.
---
ahh that's a shame, I enjoyed ardy knights on another account with a load of people.
---
Probably won't happen - OSRS is written with Java (different than JavaScript) which used to run in all browsers back in the day but now most browsers don't allow it to run in them because of a lot of security issues. A game client running Java itself is the way to get around a browser not running Java, but the whole point of a ChromeOS is to be simple and not have lots of 3rd party applications running so you can't do that by default.  
---
If you google how to play OSRS on Chromebook though, there are some suggestions such as installing a Linux OS (which could run a game client) to exist alongside ChromeOS but it might be a project to get up and running.
---
It was nice of your sister to take the picture.
---
Is it really broken though? I mean Lavas are 70-73k/h
---
Man I want the shit out of this. 
---
It's what every company does 
---
If you're paying $11 why not use the chest in the basement 
---
Need to extend those bad bois
---
Please elaborate on that I must've missed it
---
Diamond bolts to swap with, rune pouch with crumble undead and house tele, 1 anti-venom+, 1 extended superantifire, 1 range pot, 3 pray pots (usually only need 1, maybe 1,5 for 2 kills) 2 karambwans anf rest monkfish.
---
Full elite void, salve ei, archer ring imbued, god dhide boots, avas, rune cbow and ruby bolts e equipped.
---
If you het lucky with procs 3 and sometimes 4 kills a trip is doable, but mostly its 2 kill trips and if I fuck up or get really unlucky (lots of mage hits) its 1 kill per trip. Fastest so far is 2:28 but they usually take between 2:40 and 3:15 atm. 86 range now though ^^ 
---
Never done this before, but I can tell you that bandits aren't the meta anymore :)
---
Runenfertigung bad
---
Berserker good
---
Yup. It was season 7, I believe. Dee got into a gaming addiction and paid Charlie 5 bucks to take care of the account and he pretty much almost maxed it for her. 
---
But yeah I can see an osrs episode. Obviously Mac would make a zerk pure.
---
Samurai jack...?
---
You should be able to get the pet from any woodcutting activity (a few exceptions), whether the tree is natural or grown by you. So yes.
---
except when it does.
---
No it stands for shitty mate
---
That has to be some fucky code if you can't stretch a fairy ring past a 1x1 tile, goodness. Like just replicate that 1x1 tile in a little square around the initial one. It won't be so pretty because you are clicking into a square instead of the aesthetic circle that we have, but visually it would look the same.
---
Downside is you may accidentally click the fairy ring when you didn't want to but I feel that's preferable to the 1x1.
---
But runescript is runescript so if Mod Ash says so, I'll believe it. 
---
Yeah W325 is the PVP world basically they just act like it's a normal drop party, will probably drop a couple of items to get people to come there. Then they'll start hosting trivia or something and stand in the spot, be like "trade me for your prize!" and bam you're outside the bank barraged and probably dead. All they got when I saw it happen was a spade from some guy though and reports from everyone there, seems pretty hard to fall for since it's in PVP world but you typically think you're safe in the bank so I could see someone losing a lot like this.
---
I recently got hellpup and prim drop in the same task, I was stoked 
---
No, but you can recover the RS3 account and then swap the gold to an OSRS account. Use oakdice.
---
What funds? Barrows is pretty much self sustaining.
---
Extreme casualitis. Extreme pay to win. Extreme, consistent deletion of your accomplishments by making it the game ludicrously easy
---
Not to mention EoC, turning it into WoW
---
At this time of day?!
---
you dont type commands in on osrs. its not a private server. an everyone who downcoted me ya moms a hoe. downvote this one too lmaooo

Tldr this comment section:

---
I only had hope because OSRS is already on android and if Chromebooks can run android apps then it makes sense for the game to be compatible.
---
Furthermore RS3 is compatible with my Chromebook via the Play Store, it's just beta right now so I can't install it. OSRS on the other hand doesn't even show up. 
---
^^^^ Sounds about right. You know what i miss? The wilderness volcano.

It's a shame the meme posts always bring out the legit racists/idiots.
---
Not telling you how you should play, but having different goals can help if you get burnt out on one of your goals. Personally I got burnt out on 65 runecrafting for ardougne hard diary, in the end I just got 60 and used like 100 spicy stews.
---
If you're focusing on getting the quest cape and you pay for bonds with gp, do you set yourself enough time to make bond money for example.  
---
Farming is a good way break up the monotony and also make money as your crops will grow while you're doing a quest, so you can still focus on the quest cape and at the same time mantain gp for a bond.  
---
It helps if you break down your goal into parts. So even though your end goal is the quest cape, some quests also have their own rewards that make them more useful than just being a requirement for the quest point cape, which means if you find their rewards more useful you could prioritise them higher than what the optimal order suggests.
---
For example, you get in total, 2 disease-free herb patches from the troll questline, so even if it may not be the most efficient to do these sooner, there's more to the game than just getting the quest cape.  
---
click on the quest tab and and go to the favour one and you can turn it off
---
Anyone with a maxed UIM has put in their time, let's be honest. 
---
I was looking for "to play some shitty games that suck ass" but that works too
---
Same here, got magna mut kc 86 on my alt. Rip.
---
I just default to praying range every time there’s a 50/50 because I’d rather increase my DPS when I’m ranging. Might not be the “correct” way but get faster kills and still get 25-30 kill trips. Could do way longer with a BP.
---
Shut up Serene
---
Is that a gat??
---
not false
---
Just by having quick clicks, especially when banking. 
---
Thats like saying let’s change such and such a quest to give no def xp to cater for you. The quest gives xp and fortunately for you it’s after the quest so you can still wield a d scim 
---
Reddit usually hates content creators as a general rule. The OSRS subreddit is actually refreshing for the most part as content creator's are allowed to self post around here without much issue.
---
However if the content creator is even slightly unknown or just happens to post at an akward time they will be nuked. Go look at new posts lots of up and coming content creators try and get in on the action around here and are completely dumpstered on.
---
I come from Path of Exile subreddit and it's way worse there. Like ZiggyDStarcraft puts out some of the most informative content, and at the time he was self posting on the Reddit he was a moderator and one of the very few to put out content. Mathil and Zizaran at the time barely existed.
---
The aftermath of that debacle still leaves my head shaking, ZiggyD very rarely posts on that subreddit anymore as do most PoE content creators.
---
Karma is vicious for people who willingly put themselves out their for the community because toxic, unhealthy people use those people as scapegoats for their insecurities.
---
Ahh yes browsing Reddit, playing Runescape and masturbating all day is so healthy and you're edgy for saying otherwise
---
Most companies handle anti-cheats this way. They let it build for a while then mass ban so the people creating the bots don't knwo exactly what it could have been.
---
pfft that means you run isn't 100% optimized for maxed efficiency SMMMMMMMMMMMHhhhh

There isn't one, he just needs to reaffirm that he's a loser lmao

Ohhh thanks?
---
If I understand what you’re asking for that doesn’t really make sense. There’d be nothing behind the chatbox if it was transparent on fixed.
---
God is a black woman.
---
It's really good for ironman with similar rates to lava's. I wouldn't call it broken but rather an oversight from Jagex. They probably didn't expect players to farm books to trade in as a viable way to train runecrafting.
---
I had a fun little troll goin on with him tho gave him a taste of his iwn poison and WENT TO TOWN on his low hunter lvl :)
---
I would love of a good amount of dev time was taken to overhaul these things until they work. They drive me nuts every time I use them
---
Dying really isn’t a big deal in this game anymore.  Tbh you shouldn’t even need to return for your items due to the current death mechanics.  Only things you should actually be dropping on death are potions.   
---
I've started only scrolling in the empty space between the items and the navigation bar and has totally fixed that problem for me for now.
---
This is pretty cute, I like it. 
---
Im sorry I cant like your post its at 69 likes. But I do like it.
---
as i said, in terms of average stats, not playtime. rs3 has 4 extra skills, thats (3x99)+120-2300=1883 total.
---
What a deal dude. You're gonna give him 3m gp for something that sells for 50+ dollars. He would be an idiot to pass this deal up!
---
It's already cancer enough, don't make me die to an NPC that's just as toxic
---
You must have missed the memo, turns out the one true god is Allah.
---
You may not remember, but I actually did watch it and we had a decent discussion about it. I basically decided that the idea anyone can get into heaven just by believing is stupid, and so is believing in an almighty being who can do literally everything except just forgive people and get over things. Also I mentioned the book by Robert Sapolsky. I watched your video, did you check any of the sources I suggested or are you not expected to try understanding other people's "truths" as well? 
---
Absurd cosmetics, too much power creep, lack of player involvement with updates, and EoC of course
---
Recently heard about dh bombing gorillas in a duo instead of slayer helming, wicked fun even if it meant one bad aggro and I had to run my ass back and relose aggro, felt good to have fun again instead of being worried about pixels/hr

Yes but it’s unfair, some having will gloatingly post on reddit and everyone will reee 
---
rightfully so
---
A skilling boss that gives Runecrafting, mining, and smithing xp is coming out with all the new elf stuff.
---
Lol those people are the worst. I say something someone disagrees with in a cc and theyre all "nice account kid"
---
If they are aware of it and it seems that you don't have an actual login, just a mobile login, they aren't going to do something about it until at least Thursday of next week.

I could be wrong and maybe Mod West or Acorn pops in and helps you login, but who knows what they are doing since it's the weekend.

Eh one tweet about anime tits doesn’t mean he’ll be a bad parent, like if my future Wife has big tits I will fuck her every day and suck on her titties so much and motorboat and whatever activity I can do with boobs I’ll do it but I’ll take care of my child with all my strength and heart.

So you've done it? Post a screenshot/crystallab or something?

Yes it is. I started learning Zulrah at 22 million bank value. I am about 370sh KC and around 200 barrows runs since that point and my bank value is above 125 million between the main and alt accounts. This was only about a week of 50 kc of zulrah a day.
---
Im having trouble with barrows on my ironman aswell because im a noob.
---
So is your order dharok(prayer on) ---&gt; karil (prayer on) ---&gt; the rest without prayer. And only using ppots on tunnels.
---
What mage gear would you reccomend? I got 78 magic with making battlestaves. Void or mystic?
---
I'm working on it, I just really don't like doing it. I've started to kind of enjoy ankou tasks, since I can ice burst them now, but I'm on black demons right now and it's just ugh. 
---
I don't listen to anything while.playing. I sit in silence.

Imagine using pornhub in 2019

What didn't happen with A Friend in the past two years ffs. First he sold out like six times, then he tried to copy Swampletics with his fremminik only ironman, then he moved to his gf's place in another country after knowing her for like twelve minutes. Then she lied to him about being on the pill or something like that so he got her pregnant, and now she's keeping the baby. Idk why he was tweeting about big tit anime sluts but that's his gf who replied to him. 
---
Believe it or not I've had conversations that dont even relate to rs in any way that in the end was concluded im wrong because i have low RC... or the classic "mommy buys my gp for me" because i have better gear on than them
---
Same bro. That's what I'm saying!!! But it's actually on the app store check it out.

All at the same time, very accurate indeed 
---
WAY too real

This worked. Thank you
---
they will consistently repeat this while you're studying it, but they will also tell you except when it does.
---
unless you can come up with an alternative reason for the price of these items suddenly dropping right after them being introduced to the BH shop the simplest conclusion is that they went down in price due to that.
---
Serpentine helm saves on food though. I have a very difficult time getting 5 kill trips without a serp helm because the tank stats are very important to avoiding those pesky range hits from Mage zulrah.
---
Ahrim's + Serp helm is so big for getting extra kills per run. Like everytime I try to do Zulrah in Elite Void I just can't because those range hits hit like a truck with no defenses.
---
So ima disagree with you, but will say that for the sake of saving money in the short term anti-venom(++) isn't a bad option.
---
or you take 10 second out of your life and learn where the click box is just like every other player has done

smh lazy ass players nowadays

his popularity is consantly falling, and he is not posting consistently
---
Thats cause its the same pathfinding problems
---
Well I’m glad you watched it, that doesn’t happen very often, so thanks for that. I understand it may be difficult to believe salvation is as simple as putting your faith on Jesus to save you, but if God is a loving God (which he is) he would make salvation easy like that. We’re all sinners, nobody is perfect, which is why we can’t do anything to earn salvation.
---
If your objection to faith alone is something like “What about pedophiles and serial killers?”, basically the Bible teaches in Romans chapter 1 that those people rejected and hated God, so he gave them up to a reprobate mind so they can never believe and be saved. It’s too late for those types of people, God rejected them.
---
annnnnd they've crashed XD
---
He's not proud, he's bringing something up that you're then deflecting. If God has told you to spread your religion then you should stand fast and respond to his points with your own counter argument. Not just try an ad hominem attack. What happened to loving thy neighbour? The Christian God that I was brought up with was one of forgiveness, acceptance, empowerment and love. You are hurting his cause by acting as you are in his name.

I use my mouse with an OTG piece that came with my phone and the mouse works perfectly on everything and even other games but the OSRS app doesnt register clicks from it.
---
Ive seen people talk about the Octopus app but it seems (ph)fishy as hell to use.
---
It think it has to do with the proper app not being compatible with the mouse rather than the mouse itself.

I never do, there's always ad bots using normal chat lol

Damn I wish I got pet so I could never kill Vern again

Roll on the ground while playing?

Private off is the only real solution. They're either suicide accounts that will be banned by the end of the day or hacked accounts, jagex can't really do much about it afaik
---
How can this guy camp such low HP and play so dangerously and then have the audacity to flip out when he dies? It's embarassing.
---
Did you yoink it
---
Fuck yeah, just accepted him then rejected him. Now I can live with guilt free life filled with sin and reap rewards of heaven. Ty for the loophole crazy guy
---
tank stats dont really make a difference vs zulrahs range phase.
---
&gt;Ahrim's + Serp helm is so big for getting extra kills per run. Like everytime I try to do Zulrah in Elite Void I just can't because those range hits hit like a truck with no defenses.

you take more dmg in elite void because your dps is worse and kills are slower as a result.

Repost
---
Oi I know you
---
Afaik this is not true. Post 88% just unlocks more and takes longer to get. Getting 88% or lower doesn’t make you get more runes from that particular chest. You can just technically do more chests/hr. 
---
If you had 88% you’d get say 100 chaos 200 deaths. 100% you’ll get 100 chaos 200 deaths 50 bolt racks. So the same runes just bolt racks added on. 
---
Happy to be corrected if wrong. 
---
My comment was about him not geting the joke?
---
?
---
You can’t accept and reject salvation at the same time, that makes no sense. But if a saved person does live a life filled with sin, God will punish them and destroy their life on this earth. If you watched the video, you’d know that.
---
Public -&gt; off
---
86 for me, 3 minute boost gang
---
My complaint is more like, why is this God so vain that he requires everyone believe in him to enjoy their "afterlife"? Sounds like a kid who gets upset when people aren't his friend or something. I would hope an all powerful being wouldn't really care much what a human thinks of them. It seems a little self centered for any human to think any all powerful being would give any craps about anything they do or think. Like what a sense of inflated self importance.

He does this pretty frequently I think. I'm not sure if this is just a troll account of his or not but I'm leaning towards that honestly. 
---
You definitely have more money than I did when I first started flipping. But in a month I made 30m from plain pizzas, I stopped flipping and bought a couple bonds to begin pvming. 
---
Yeah, I just don't have any points.

Stupid people reproduce like crazy unfortunately.

Out of curiosity, what chance did the Indians who occupied America have of going to heaven?

Like, if you never heard of Jesus Christ or anything relating to Christianity, are you automatically saved when you die?
---
Yes sorry, I was just piggybacking and adding the reasoning behind it!
---
Sb? Ive been an xnxx since day one
---
Considering it's been in the game significantly longer than those items, I don't think that's the main reason. But I see your point. 
---
sorry dude i added the screenshot when making the post but ig it didnt save... just added it.

lol
---
Raids is fun is correct
---
Social life, leisure, and romance. Seems like a healthy existence to me.

60-65m in a month sounds very low. Do you get banned and make new accounts before you can do any good money makers?

This bitch is a nightmare, seriously. A Friend sucks, but she is just a total nutcase.

There annoying af after a while but every once in while I turn on all the sounds.walking from the GE to Falador really nostalgias.

is it worth doing barrows with 70 atk, 70 str, 60 def, 61 range, 50 prayer, 66 magic?
---
im looking for some new content to do to switch things up from skilling
---
Inflated self importance? He’s God, he created us with the purpose of worshiping him. That’s why we exist, so of course he wants us to do that. It’s like if you built a robot to clean your house, but it decided to just destroy everything instead. We have all rebelled against God, we have all sinned and deserve hell, but he is merciful and sent his Son to die in our place so that we can be saved. It’s a beautiful expression of his love and we are given the choice to accept or reject it.
---
His early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Swampletics came out in '18, I think he really came into his own, commercially and artistically.
---
Probably every single other area of Rs.
---
Well really unless you die with four tbows and no protect item you wouldnt have to pay that. Unless youre looting 1b in gear that ISNT protected you shouldnt pay that. Then if you do die and drop 1b in gear ur trash for dying anyway so id consider it more of an idiot tax lol

Remote Desktop nmz will allow you to get maxed without even playing. A lot of people hate on nmz prods but if you really don’t have enough time it’s a good route to go. It could be nerfed any day though as the jmods stated a nerf was inevitable a few months back 
---
I believe those people would have heard of Jesus. It’s unfortunate though that they were probably killed before they could hear and believe the gospel, but no, they have to go to hell to pay for their sins. The only exceptions are very young children or disabled people who have no concept of sin, and therefore can not sin.
---
Coincidental username lol
---
I don't think I would make something with free will if I didn't want it to exercise that free will. It's kinda like an abusive relationship if you give them free will just to punish them if they don't do exactly what you wanted. But no I meant the human (in this case you) has an inflated sense of self importance to a) assume you know what this all powerful being even wants or cares about and then b) to assume he cares about you just because you have a man made book saying he does.

Too late, you said there's no take backsies in eternal life, see ya in heaven, douchenozzle!

What was your IGN previously?

Looks like your Last name was reported as offensive and now you got a 1 year ban from name changes. I didn't know that was a thing, but I would go look into your account settings or support on the runes ape website

There's plenty of ways to train RC, including fast, afk, and profitable methods.
---
Why is that stored in the first place?
---
i've always been told bolt racks take up a roll for rune stuff.
---
Wait 50 kills is a lot? 
---
Well I mean the concept applies to when the whip was released as well. If it’s trained strength it’d make the D scim and later the Sara sword obsolete too
---
It's a bot 
---
It’s the cheapest way to have all the teles in your pouch but it makes alches more expensive. If you don’t plan on alching steam runes end up being the better choice.
---
the problem is a perm mute , nothing on reddit lol , your confusing me . 
---
Look closer, it's a burnt trout
---
Then its a good bot
---
nice
---
Clearly you’ve rejected the gospel, so there’s no point talking to you about it any further. I hope you still have another chance and will reconsider.
---
Yo J1m, been watching you since your "Just some fishing" back in the day. Glad to see your channel gain some traction these past few months, you deserve it man. 
---
I am not going to criticize your point because you are right, its ilegal everything that Venezuelans do, but do not blame us that we destroy the economy of the game, when those who buy the gold that we sell are players from all over the world, something else is that the gold farm is always, is not only now, as a person who sells the gold that gets killed by zulrah or vorkath will destroy an economy of a perfectly made game that is constantly changing? .. Just think of that, although I know that it can be difficult for you to understand why I do it from the comfort of your home and your country where you have everything
---
Runescape classic was lot less documented and he didn't play in rsc so more time consuming
---
Didn’t block out your run energy, bye account😂
---
I hope I do see you in heaven, but clearly you’re just joking around and didn’t watch or believe the video.
---
I was worried about people getting frustrated with me too since i have subpar stats for raids, I can’t even make xeric aids. Honestly, join the we do raids discord. They have a waiting for mentor channel that every so often someone with loads of experience will come and guide you and a bunch of beginners through a raid. I also asked people in that channel if they wanted to just go for it and since we were all beginners no one really expected me to be good. On my 5th kc I managed to not die, so it’s not too hard to learn. 
---

I passed out last night at 71 while doing tables. Worth it.
---
To even be able to do 1000% enrage will require hundreds of hours of practice and grinding yes, as well as a lot of expensive deaths. People spend hundreds of hours grinding for the Warden title, which is just 500% enrage.
---
Being able to streak to 1000% means doing 75+ kills in a row at varying enrages all the way up to around 995% without dying once, if you die once you can lose dozens of kills worth of loot in an instant. So being able to do that consistently without dying is a skill all by itself.
---
Not really. If I want a quick release porn is not unhealthy. It only gets unhealthy if you get addicted to it, use it as an unrealistic baseline for actual women in both looks and performance, or start to prefer it over an actual woman. If you just use it as a tool to masturbate when you want to it is not bad or unhealthy.

You have to start "recipe for disaster" quest

God swords aren't used for training. I would not do that if I were you.

did u reply to the wrong person? wtf are u talking about

Well “raid is fun” sounds weird doesn’t it.
---
then rogues den since you don't need to move to bank and cook.
---
just an fyi, karambwans do burn unless you the cooking cape or you're using the hosidius kitchen. cooking gauntlets alone have no effect on karambwan if used outside of the hosidius kitchen, inside they reduce the burn level compared to only having the kitchen bonus.

---
Rng is not exhaustive, stfu 
---
Scarred isnt scared bro.
---
I won't even pretend to know why
---
No it's not. Godswords are only useful in certain situations. By the looks of it you have a lot more training to do before you have a decent use case for a godsword. You could justify an SGS for some training, but it'd be at most a spec weapon.
---
Came to the comments section to see this because I had no clue either, thanks!
---
cool
---
Haha yeah I won't either. I'm just raising the question because it seems like a bad and pointless idea...

Its no different than you sitting on your ass watching tv, retard.

Well neither does “raid are fun” ????? Neither does “fork is help” or “shoe is new”? You can’t just put three words together and have it be a sentence lmfao, what are you trying to argue here? Of course it sounds weird, it’s not a grammatically correct complete sentence?

Yeah I think I will just quit instead. I was hyped to start playing again and fill the collection log, but it felt like a huge waste of time the first time around.
---
Is it really worth it? I really enjoy the game
---
nice couple bonds there

A ring has a hole in the middle. A circle doesnt. The clickbox has no hole in the middle, therefore it's not a ring.

I like this comment
---
Godswords are only good for the spec. They're way to slow to be used as a normal weapon.
---
&gt;copy Swampletics
---
TBF with a friend, area locked ironmans were already a thing before Swampletics, you could argue that he's leeching from the current hype but nothing more than that imo
---
Please.. Mobile fairy ring usage is actually so annoying

Stop raiding with shitters then
---
Everything is 100% useless in a long term. You can try to ignore that fact, but at least don't tell people how to live based on your fantasies.
---
Having a hard time fingering fairy rings I see....
---
yeah it's doable in budget gear. you won't get max profits obviously but still probably like 500k an hour at an estimate, which is better than most skilling methods.  
---
biggest factor is your magic weapon, since you're only 66 magic, the iban's staff is probably your best option, which requires underground pass completed. if you haven't, the slayer staff for magic dart is acceptable too. wouldn't recommend doing it with a worse weapon/spell, though underground pass isn't difficult.
---
my first comment
---
Godswords aren't an upgrade. They have niche uses but aren't required for anything. I would just wait until a boss needs one to be fought efficiently (really only the Sara godsword and the bandos one). But whip+defender or Abby dagger+defender are the best training methods. Other than rapier but that's a fortune.
---
yeah well hes dead now, he prob started a new account
---
save up for sara godsword for healing. But don't use it to train with.
---
Still shouldn’t have been an issue
---
It is a huge waste of time indeed, bones to peaches took long enough just so I could do a diary

No I didn't, he isn't the one who was having an argument with you

No, savant just means a learned person, especially a distinguished scientist. It's just that sometimes someone with autism will have their obsession be something like painting, sculpture, math, astronomy, or engineering rather than My Little Pony, Transformers, or Sonic the Hedgehog. These individuals tend to become among the best in their field of interest and so become know as savants.

Username checks out

Sure! You can have one for 34m.
---
What is konar? Im pretty nooby haha
---
1500 total Any way so who cares
---
At low stats there aren’t really a lot of options of making money while skilling. Also, the nature of the game is that most skilling methods actually cost money ironically.
---
Slayer only really gets profitable post 70s and really profitable post 90s, buts it’s one of the slowest skills to train.
---
If you’re sure about making money while skilling you could do Blast Furnace, Wintertodt, hunting chins, hunting implings. These won’t net you a lot an hour at lower levels and some require mid level stats. However they are still good ehp training methods while getting money. I would enough you not to craft orbs or cut yews (etc) since the gp and xp isn’t worth it.

This is on a main

Do you remember what happend with the  2008 HD update?

Even IF you toggled off the HD, you were still left with the NEW animations, fat character models, new emotes, new item models.

Many people hated that myself included.

If you're gonna be using a cannon anyway you might as well buy eclectic impling jars. You'll get them way faster and spend about the same, maybe less

I was jut saying pking on F2P seems like you get less than 100k per kill

The reason they use the natural base is because the derivative of e^x is itself. If you use another power like 10^x then things get slightly more annoying since the derivative is ln(10)10^x. then the derivative of that is ln(10)^2 10^x. Etc. 
---
If you keep deriving e^x though, then you can take the derivative as much as you want and it still remains the same - e^x. 
---
Regardless in most contexts it hardly matters what base you use. If you're in the natural base, you can easily convert it into log of 10 with.
---
Say that x is a number. Then
---
 Log_10(x) = log_e(x)/log_e(10)
---
So the base you choose doesn't matter. 
---
Probably questing, I’ve only got 30 left till the quest point cape.

Honesty took me a minute. Runescape Oldschool lmao.

&gt; Good Luck! (sarcastic tone)

&gt; What the fuck! I got the dog, for real
---
&gt; No you fucking didn't
---
&gt; I fucking did, check the stream. Hold on, I'll clip it
---
&gt; What the fuck, you must be the first pure with a dog
---
&gt; Yup, I bet no one has it. What the fuck
---
what are those exchange rates?  why do you get less going from osrs to rs3?

where did you train range can’t find the location

Wasting time and suffering mechanics because you don't know them is fun?

Can you link me up?

From lvl 1.
---
Did she rape him?
---
If not, he's just as much to blame.
---
He also would be a terrible parent, with or without the nutjob he shacked up with.
---
I find the word "retarded" offensive to some degree personally, but for some reason, I can't tell why, I actually like brainlet memes. Idk why. 
---
I guess its so absurd it kind of lifts the "personal" veil of it. I think its pretty cool
---
66m rcing xp and 97m agility xp....laaawwwwddd. 
---
no idea what i just watched
---
was expecting a guide to doing it, but instead i guess the dude just made a frag video of himself doing woodcutting?
---
Idk about that man. I look like a little dragonfruit tree now ;)
---
"fun"
---
Good to know!
---
Absolute unit right there wearing d-swag!

I mean the man himself said 24k so probably 24k
---
With a 30m bank, mid 70 all combats + prayer, what would you recommend for money making? 
---
70 Slayer as well. I've been doing barrows for about 200 chests. Not sure if there's anything better until I get ready for Zulrah, etc 
---
hi tedious
---
I myself got my First Firecape last night with the same inventory set up! I had 70 range and 70 Prayer and the Preserve prayer which kept my boosted range and defense up! I would reccomend use of the F keys to flick between inventory and prayer quickly! 
---
Aside from that, I would open the Wiki for the waves to see what comes from each one, that way you dont get surprised early by the mages or double range &amp; mage! Pay attention where the odd color mage spawns, that'll be Jad's spawn point which can allow you the ability to set up your safe spot to prepare! Steel your nerves and preserve, you got this! 
---
I’m assuming this doesn’t mean that they’re going to enable background app refresh for the ios version though right

---
Bro, I ain't gay.
---
It honestly depends on how you're interpreting "raids" in game. Personally I would have to agree with WayV- and say that it's grammatically incorrect and it should be "Raiding is fun" and "Raids are fun".
---
Thats how swappers make their money. It used to be like 1:5 and 1:7 but its changed. Thats just their margins so they profit
---
Still just another low effort attempt on cashing in on the hype of someone elses successful video. After months of putting out lazy "content".
---
Kinda like how those buttboys Framed/Torvesta and the other pkers literally copy each other shamelessly.
---
at being shit LOOOOOOL #rekt
---
Do you know how to offensive pray flick with bp?
---
You're going to end most of the later waves just sitting there ranging the magers with nothing else to do, and it will definitely save you some prayer.
---
So does this mean once i hit 99 str i will be the only one to this date with 10 hp 99 str as a HCIM? Prob some1 was before me and went iron / deironed it but still :o
---
Absolute unit
---
I've been playing both games on and off since OSRS release.  I have both a main and ironman on each game (2 accounts).
---
Honestly in my opinion, rs3 if handled better, could easily have still been the main game people played.
---
The combat and bosses are actually very well designed along with graphics and a few other things.
---
The game is like 50% masterpiece, 50% the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
---
Mostly due to dead content, unbalance in endgame, and mtx/cosmetic promos.
---
Its just sad that both games aren't loved. As EoC has been out since 2012, I've been playing since 2006.
---
This means EoC has actually been out longer than when I first played rs2.  To me they are both runescape.
---
But I can easily admit , OSRS is a much more pure game. It hasnt been destroyed as bad as many aspects of rs3 have.
---
I have done a lot of research. Read wiki, saw videos, even tried some of the waves to get a feel on the unrestricted worlds. Will buy preserve, haven't thought of it. Did you just keep it on through the whole thing? Gratz on cape!
---
Rewarding life? Sounds like xp waste 
---
Always wanted to get better graphics for osrs. Obviously they should be  100% toggleable so that people dont have to use them if they dont want to.
---
Buy willow logs, burn them, and then sell the ash for profit.
---
That was underwhelming
---
Because as more and more people are switching over to runelite and sooner or later they will just pull the plug and cash out
---
You imagine people like to work for free? Have you ever had a job? They also can't do jagex related work and not get paid, that would include playing on their mod accounts and banning bots. 
---
This game is so big, even after years I still look things up and learn new stuff all the time. You can add me ingame, 'Droodish', if you want to ask any question. 
---
If you're just going to bitch and moan about how hard it is to be an Ironman, you should probably de-iron tbh. 
---
Only if we arbitrarily have to donate money to the gnomish national bank to help rebuild after the 'destruction'. Another 5m gold sink from each player.

&gt;These items were also added to drop tables

they were already on those drop tables, their price went down after them being introduced to the BH store, it was stable above high alch value before that.

The Kourend castle does this. It's annoying lol.

so RC then

The diary rewards aren't meant to actually be used in combat? Only the arts cloak really but that's very situational. You do diaries for the extremely good rewards they give not for the gear itself.

So you use magic imbue and binding necklace for this method? I've never done combination runes, so adivce is welcome.

Get full armadyl and tbow and 99 range, itll be easier

What do you do after you escape?

Do what this guy says. Rannars with ultracompost are better profit tho. Also for blast furnace, first do Motherlode mine until you can buy the coal bag. Also you can use the ores as a start to get gear for blast furnace

Don't think he planned on using it.
---
I've been kicking around ideas because I'm not 100% sure. I'm thinking that I only acquire items through combat or shops but that negates quests which might be fine. If anyone has any ideas let me know. Maybe even dropping the uim status to show I'm free. 
---
I think you mean wintertodting.
---
Who's this? O:&lt;

That means you were standing there watching him for three hours ;) it would appear I'm wrong if he was there for that long. He probably died too soon in nmz and seems to actually have an autoclicker continuing after death. If that is the case, my apologies my liege.

It’s lasagna. People spell it lasagne because when the lasagna meme originated, it came from an AMA Lynx Titan did a while back asking about what he eats. He said all he eats is “lasagne” which is why everyone spells it that way here.

Countries as we know them today did not exist in the same way. When someone says “my nationality is...” we refer to the country that they are from, i.e. British, Algerian, Chinese, etc. there was never a country as they exist today called ‘jewish’, with the exception most recently of Israel. If you’re going to refer to a Jewish nation in modern context the vast majority of people are going to understand that as Israel, and you set it up that way by referring to the past as from now since.
---
I don’t understand the issue here, I’m not calling out Judaism in any way, but the modern definition of nation is not the same as was written roughly 8 millennia ago. (Not to mention the translation has never been exact)
---
Interesting, never heard of this before. Thanks for the new tid bit of knowledge. How well does this stand up in court relative to what is more commonly thought of as rape, in regards to sentancing, etc?
---
Yes. Turn on ‘Hide NPCs’ in the entity hider settings.

Hey! so can I use full graceful on quest instanced fights? Those that the wiki says that if you die you lose items? I think untradeables you get to keep, but im scared about dying doing quests and always gear change... Thanks!
---
Your welcome, dont forget a facemask or slayer helmet tho! Dont want to lose your chins!

Loads of people thought it looked soulless. Everything looked like it was made of shiny clay.

Can you even play on the browser anymore? Everytime i tried it just downloaded another copy of the client
---
Because my level of knowledge on the subject is on the same level of your pathetic belief on being knowledgeable on the subject, the only difference being I have the capability of daring to ask on what basis we define a ‘nationality’. If you happen to find yourself knowledgeable on the subject by abstracting a simple Wikipedia page I would highly suggest being silent on any cultural discussion.  
---
Then again: Christianity evolved from Judaism. Being born in the west (and therefore making it likely to having any links to christianity) would make me and you probably being part of the subrace or (by your standards somehow) -nationality ‘jewish’ it is highly suggestive where you draw the line. I’ll repeat myself when I say: if you believe your wikipedia definition concludes the discussion, please read a book for once or shut up.

I did it first time with a rune cbow without flicking. You don't need to.

To be honest, I really enjoy the concept of the series and  i've also been doing the quest order by release on my ironman since 2016 since I found the list on the wiki. I play really inefficiently and in these three years i've only got to recipe for disaster. 
---
The reason I was doing it was to experience the storyline and actually read all the dialogue and only using the quest guide when stuck. I've had tons of fun along the way.
---
That why the thing that kind of bothers me about the series is the blatant skipping of all dialogue and therefore eliminating the chance to experience the actual story, what else is the point of completing quests anyway?

Change the Saradomin one to something a little less powerful, and I'm on board. Something along the lines of 'Protect from all' i.e. an overhead prayer that grants 50% protection from all attack styles, along with Poison / Venom / Antifire / Freeze, etc, draining 8 prayer points per tick. That way it's less of a 'get out of jail free card' against solo pkers, and more 'if you're desperate to survive against a clan, this might just save you'.

I’ve answered a few people about this in the previous episodes, but once the quests start becoming more in depth with storylines i’m going to begin talking about the dialogue and such more. However, the current quests are beyond simple and no real depth to talk about yet, and most players have gone through these a million times.

Idk about Zohra, she seems like an egghead. But A friend didn't always have a reputation for being a prat, he needs to ctfo and take a year out of his life to sit down.
---
Maybe that's too bold for me to say but he just needs to refocus. Like I've not been a fan of him because of the way he's acting and continually not being remorseful. I know he's capable of those emotions, he just needs to get there.
---
So I stand by the community needs to not drag them through the mud when they aren't doing anything OSRS related other then him being a disgraced personality. Sometimes quiet time and focusing on yourself is extremely important, especially when your life is just not hitting the right notes.

you're obviously insecure that i'm challenging your beliefs, the same way an addict reacts when you say their addiction is a problem. denial.

i don't even know why i even fucking bother trying to convince a bunch of nihilistic kids who play a game of clicking on rocks and dick measuring about the time you've done these menial activities.

They should add it after the "welcome to runescape" message with red text. Not sure if they already do, haven't noticed but it definitely reminds me about everything else. "There is an open poll running, go cast your vote near any bank booth."

I don’t think that’s true as ive seen rolls with all runes and bolt racks in. I always used to do 100% now I just do 88% because it takes less time and I have a blowpipe so I don’t need racks for my cbow anymore. Still hunting Veracs skirt, 23/24

Agree, I’m like 6 months in right now and it’s made a big difference for me.  I wasn’t a complete addict or anything, but I figured I’d try it out and that it couldn’t be a good habit.  And idk if it’s just coincidence or what, but I’ve had way more success with girls over that time period too.  I’m in my first real relationship for the first time in 6 years right now.  Maybe its a meme, maybe it’s not, but I’d say it’s definitely worth a shot.

Out of the loop, can someone give me a tldr of a friends situation in the last 6 or so months?

I might be spamming now with my idea, but I want Jmods to read this. The solution or a compromise would be adding a toggle for Default left click to be LAST DESTINATION instead of Zanaris. That way, on mobile you could just spam tap on to the screen, until you get it right, wheres now you have to be very precise becouse you need to hold your tap, and since screen moves it is really frustrating. 
---
As an unbiased 3rd person, after reading both comments, I think he has a good point and your reply is a bit harsh.

Extremely happy to achieve my very first 99 on my entire Runescape career after more than a dozen years. I decided to up the ante and get a long one out of the way.

Wintertodt is fast firemaking. You'll make some money and get like 250-350k xp per hour.

Smithing gold at blast furance is really fast as well.

Ive actually never done a game of wintertodt maybe Ill look into it and get that stupid ass firemaking cape everyone seems to have

No

Do cooking, fire making and farming for quick as hell exp and some side cash and then invest your money into herblore/Fletch/craft/smithing levels

Schrodinger would imply you both have and do not have the pet at the same time; ergo, you have the pet!

Dragon Slayer really expanded on RS's lore though. The Duke would tell you a bit about Crandor's history.
---
I think I get what you’re saying, when I die I keep my slay helm, berserker, fury, and whip, Lose guthans chest/legs, and barrows gloves (gear wise). What do you mean about not needing to return tho 
---
I really dislike the idea of having to reach over the screen to click those.   At least the current buttons are out of the way. 
---
That history still wouldn't explain how my auth, pin, and password were breached now.
---
Yeah man that dude was on for like 6 hours straight on d
---
Rank 2 in the whole game uses medium clues from eclectic imps as a money maker. Not sure I can agree with you here
---
Thanks! I’m not caught up on the UIM component of it, although it’s even more impressive. I’ll check them out!
---
What even is this code not even kidding
---
Keep that shit off of social media.   I mean both of those. 
---
90 cons so I can boost for fairy ring/tree and have the maxed nexus :)
---
This shouldn't actually be a good thing, but trust me, the kid could have much, much worse situation. 
---
Bruh wtf how y’all remember this shit I got some 2+2 type shit going on in my head and you’re hitting me with whatever the fuck lg(x) is
---
Grats!
---
Dharok body and torag chest. I also got karils cbow at 5k and an elite clue at 19kc. First kill doesn’t count and I didn’t know what was happening and only killed the brother in the crypt. Pleased with how barrows has gone so far :)

Q
---
1k+ with no uniques.
---
Feels good.
---
I don't know about random.dat but jagex_cl_oldschool_live.dat just points to the gamefiles. I don't know the reason why it's there but I guess everytime you load a client they are generated anyways, so just leave them be
---
Does reporting a person you think may be botting, but arent 100% sure, have any negative side effects? Just a curiousity
---
I think this past Christmas event might have put you in or around that space.
---
Gratz man, as a fellow autist with an untrimmed agility cape im very mad you got the pet.

---
How has your life changed please go on, do you hit the gym? Have a wife? Or just go out with friends more?
---
Yes it's really unfortunate. As others have mentioned in this thread, turning private to friends is the only real solution.
---
It made the community a little more closed off. You can no longer just PM someone from a CC or who said something earlier without asking them to specifically add you first.
---
I'll do it for 900k
---
I would not consider date of  account creation, CC info, or DOB "limited information"
---
It's plausible. 
---
I will never not like IASIP references
---
are you a hacker?
---
Needs 99 agil and diary cape
---
Haha you left the minimap! Your account is mine
---
It wouldn't hurt to just create a script that deletes them every hour? 
---
That's not true. Most women who abort don't suffer any ill affects mentally or physically. It's not a traumatic procedure, and even if it does leave some baggage it's nothing compared to spending decades raising a child you never wanted. Irresponsible idiots shouldn't be bringing children in to this world period. It's already enough of a shit show.
---
And more tabs

bfa is shit
---
Gotta go to 301 every now and then just to flex though.
---
Minotaurs are really popular ranged training for F2Pers before they start having to compete for hill giants. Besides that I think they just kinda run in for be money and boots.
---
Words of a true philosopher, and a psychologist as well. Thanks for your wise input
---
I'd censor those 4 Trouts, I'm not hacking you out of respect because you spent so much time getting them, but someone else might.
---
Nope, just an engineering student 
---
Beeg
---
I'm not the only one
---
i did 80 prayer on my ironman and i never died there, as soon i saw someone on the minimap i logged, its easy
---
condoms are advertised at 98% effective and birth control is 99% 
---
The Jagex client actually writes these, not us. All of our files write to ~/.runelite
---
Not bad but in terms of the whole "maxing an uim" thing UIM Link definitely made better vids of the two IMO. His series where he was doing more unique stuff on his UIM like clues, collecting items, etc are somewhat interesting but hindered by lack of experience. The whole swampletics thing is leagues better than anything he was doing before I think, he was sort of doing his own take on things that had already been done better by people already before it.
---
In math classes, yes. In real maths (maths papers, conferences etc) it is generally log_e if there's no further qualification. I thought the same as you until I finished undergrad and started reading papers. 
---
Yeah, but, whats the point. Only thing that would accomplish, is that your client loads slower
