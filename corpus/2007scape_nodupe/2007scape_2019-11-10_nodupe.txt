I have around 1k myself with probably 700 or so from range, I didn’t notice any difference whatsoever in trip length personally while meleeing. I do prefer melee though.
---
How easy?

just died to healers moment ago :D

I like this very much

Jagex is the dumbest company out there, honsetly
---
Isn't this what merchant clans do? Not as extreme, but basically the same thing? Is merching still big?
---
If 5 fills your inv, you're bring too many potion doses.

---
You're not woox walking so, pretty much you got your answer.
---
That's what I meant, good.
---
I meant if Vorkath has your hp low mid phase are you guthix rest tic eating instead of regular eating.
---
By extra hit I meant stack hit him with blowpipe before he hits you.

The guys name who is the bug abuser is named hug bunter, like the known dark web site creator lol

do you know if you have a discreet gpu or if its integrated?  
---
if you go to your notification panel, do you have an nvidia/amd icon, can you open that up and find a 'system information' link from there?  
---
or just a direct link to the exact product page, or exact model number of computer. theres a lot of 'dell xps 15 w' devices, they have various customization options when you buy.

Hey man club penguin was the shit

You could always mix things up.

* Camping Ogre's on Corsair Cove 
---
* Risk fighting in Edge
---
* Mining Iron Ore
---
* Telegrabbing wines yourself
---
* Making Sapphire Rings
---
Wildy weapons are 1 item and BIS at every wilderness boss.  Force skull just forces them to be mace-able.  Mandatory risk shouldnt be a tihng until ancient mace doesnt smite stack in pvp.
---
And the Halloween event where you have to go into grim reaper's house and the Easter egg cockatrice event. Screw the people who voted less effort on holiday events for EfFiCiEnCy.
---
It's kinda funny seeing people act like Jagex is powerless against bots when the only one who suffered permanent damage was [me](https://i.imgur.com/aY0a45a.png) lol 
---
My bots didn't even last 12 hours. By the time I woke up in the morning my entire farm had been wiped out, mules and all.
---
Now I know why the guy in the SirPugger video stopped botting BH and why massive BH farms aren't more common considering the relatively low level of programming ability needed to start one up.

My grandpa would suck up it slowing down his computer for stock trading because he knew I loved that game.

That's true, but always being skulled would mean you're always susceptible to being smited for your +1.

Son?

I've actually gotten that 300k from just telegrabbing but for a bit I also started killing imps for beads. Thanks for a few other suggestions I might try. What's up with the ogres on Corsair cove?

Mechquest was my jam.

Because jagex made ardy knights via rightclick npc - I'm sure if jagex didnt do rightclick npc and RL did then they'd ban ardy knights, etc, too.
---
Not disagreeing, just suggesting why it is this way
---
?????????????????????????????????????
---
This exact thing happened to me but with vorkath :(
---
Basically, and yes they still exist, but in this example with the boots, the price of the high alch was changed to a ridiculous amount so basically all pures who stocked up on the items for pking made absolute bank on them
---
Fingers crossed lol
---
Yes 1:1 is allowed I use a button my keyboard for a second left click too
---
Thank you ill give them a try
---
It would need to be balanced correctly but I would imagine yes - as if all the people in the group did the quests you would get the xp anyway but it is just a potential way to make the game mode more appealing and grow. A lot of people I have spoken to were averse to the game mode due to the questing grind hence why I made the post originally so we could try and think of a potential solution!
---
Pvm is gamed to shit and botted wayyy more heavily than pking
---
They didn’t happen at the same time duder.
---
&gt;because there is absolutely no metric by which you can determine a "real" pvp fight versus a botted boxing match.
---
if jagex wanted they could hire machine learning expert who could write anticheat that could easily tell the difference between actual fights and bots/boosters chilling boxing eachother and killing the same people over and over again.
---
or, at the VERY LEAST, disable getting targets from the same fucking IP address lmao.

feet
---
Thanks, I didn't realize it goes away if I die with it but it makes sense. I'll be sure to keep that in mind
---
It is still pretty alive at Edgeville in W308 with the meta of everyone doing range to rune 2h. Depending on the time of day it may be hard finding someone your level but most of the time it isn't an issue.
---
That was a Steven King style twist right there
---
quite a bit shy of efficient.
---
Yay Jagex is clueless and ruining the fucking game all over again like they did RS3!!! Awesome! Congrats on being fucking clueless and disconnected from your players! Stellar job
---
You drink your ppot every 10 minutes and get to overload. "100% invested."
---
No overload, no hard, just so you can use absorb pots for 20 mins. OmegaLUL
---
And doing NMZ while you're supposedly "living your life" and "not being invested" is fucking sweaty, and honestly, pretty sad. I log out when I'm "living" but it's up to you. Fuck bitches at the club, asking them to hold on every 20 minutes, so you make sure to get some attack exp. L0L. Definitely the way to live, can't even press the logout button when you have no time to play LOLOLOL. Maybe it's time for addiction counselling? The only time I NMZ is when I'm watching a movie before bed and too tired to do anything else, not while I'm in the club or outside LOLOLOL
---
Do wintertodt till very high firemaking - Very quick - This will give you alot of resources that you can either use for other skills or sell for profit :)

I had that same sweatband

For oak dungeon doors? Mannnn let me believe I’m efficient I feel accomplished ffs.

as competent they are or not, the real problems lie within the management of osrs at jagex. it's obvious the team receives their every move from higher ups who are so incredibly out of touch with the current game as it has been proven time and time again over the years.
---
just how many times has jagex rushed out content for the sake of getting to say they've done it, in the past few years? i've honestly lost count at this point
---
Can pkers have one thing? Jesus
---
What did you trim it with :o!
---
Do you have more models on twitter? I dont have a twitter acc

550k+ is possible haha but the method to do it requires  quite a bit more attention, 500k is still decent for not doing the 25 plank method :p

510+ next hour!

This is the only Christmas event I didn't get to play on my original account, because I was on vacation at the time in another country, so I didn't get to play at all for almost a month and a half when I was a kid =(
---
Ahh okay, that last part answered what I was going to post. Interesting dude, think I have a few ideas too ;)
---
Dunno but air orb prices rose. so for those crafting staves it was basically the same cost overall.
---
&gt;PLAYERS weren’t buying gold
---
they've been doing that since the dawn of time, you can't fix that lol
---
even back in the trade ban area, people would go to lengths to find glitches in minigames just to sell gold on rs lmao. there used to be some bug with the dungeoneering lobby with quite a long winded setup to finally xfer items like partyhats and cash
---
But not really, these things are unrelated.
---
Man I don’t know how to work Reddit app. But you’re right, just get the damn pet. Pretty simple if you ask me. Got it at 26, why is everyone upset?

Bro I just paid my car pament selling BH gold lol. No plz.
---
So how will people be caught for overlays only plugins? This will only encourage people to sell these type of plugins like before there was a runelite fork that included this for free.
---
Is it better to train strength on its own with a D scim or using the top right attack style with a whip?
---
Just as an FYI: 
---
If normal Line firemaking, maple logs are ~160k xp/hr
---
If doing the sweaty grad exchange method where you do short lines and click one square back every log, unnoting at the banker, etc. (vids can be found online if you're interested) you're looking at closer to 200k xp/hr.
---
Wintertodt is up to ~320k xp/hr (~360k if you light logs between matches), costs nothing, and you'll actually make money, while being **way** more afk than line firemaking. 
---
I'd highly suggest not bothering with those maples if you plan to get members.
---
bots not getting the Hosidius house favour
---
Rs3 has virtually ZERO bots. It can be done.

Ticks in the cave = quest points earned
---
Doing the SoTE and exiles will give you an extra 4 seconds in the cave.
---
Your art style is amazing! I love everything about this.
---
It is, but since time immemorial people have been calculating 'virtual levels' and it seems 3rd party clients actually show that in your game once you reach them.
---
I went dry my first 70 and then have gotten both of those + 3 other items from 70-125

Glad I'm not missing out on anything...

Bro, my clan just bought everyone a TB lol. King of botters!!!
---
This makes me so happy

Nice.
---
The fact they still do the free weekends despite repeated complaints of botting from the community just proves money will always come first over game integrity and quality.

nice how many keys you got in the bank

I’ve quit since WoW classic came out and seeing how downhill it’s gone since then and even the direction it was headed when I left is so sad . I really hope Jagex gets there shit together . May God Ash be with us all

Kind of fishy the new helm has been out over a month and just now DHL becomes meta.

Oh it gets better. You had a chance to win 'backstage passes', to take a picture of your in-game avatar with their avatars.

When does slayer become profitable again? Im 36 slayer currently and am just wondering when im gonna start making some nice cash with the skill.
---
well in terms of software developers their pay is very low. Plus working on an outdated engine with an outdated language doesn't help them develop skills needed to get software jobs elsewhere. But to act like they dont care is wrong. They have a real passion for this game and theyre doing what they see right in their eyes. It might not look like that to you but your opinions on how to make the game better might be different than theirs.
---
Well, this is how long it takes if you try to make a buyable profitable.
---
These tiaras are slight profit/break even (they said they made 1.7m), but 50k xp/hr (so ~250 hours assuming ~50k xp/hr) while members have stuff like air battlestaves at &gt;330k xp/hr for  3-4gp/xp. So even if it costs 40-50m, it takes ~40 hours instead of 250 hours. Even if you do a very low req/low level moneymaker at 1m gp/hr, you still have an extra 150+ hours saved.
---
Not trying to shit on OP, just showing why people generally consider such methods "not worth it". Efficiencyscape can get annoying and if you genuinely enjoy doing something like smithing tiaras to 99 then go right ahead, but the alternatives and time saved are certainly worth considering.
---
If you aren't enjoying the game just quit. Osrs isn't for everyone, it's a very niche game. I've always loved collecting things including pets especially, and grinding is very zen for me, and I love feeling progress thru short to long term goals. And I love the euphoria of getting rare drops. Along other things too, but my point is essentially that if you genuinely don't find yourself wanting to log in because it's a "chore" the  judt don't. This game really is  not for most people
---
The hero we want *and* need
---
Barrows gloves require min 275 quest points (close to every quest in the game)
---
jagex changed the alch price of climbing boots from 200gp to 45k overnight, and there we're rumours going around that mod mark leaked it happening to a few people (which has never been confirmed to my knowledge). But this led to a few people making absolute fucking bank overnight.
---
if I buy a cannon, and try to sell it back, how much do they sell for on the GE?
---
I want to speed my slayer up but a cannon is like, my entire cashstack, so im not trying to lose it all.
---
Welcome to growing up
---
Yeah, they sped up the rate at which you fish them now, and they're heavily botted.
---
Yo fr though that would be sick if it was balanced properly
---
This is something we've been working on.
---
Yeah just add it to Slayer helm /s
---
I did this for my brother actually..I made surei had 5m gold on hand always. Once he figured out different things in the game, got some levels up and started to understand a lot more, I gave him that 5m and said buy yourself some better gear and go get grinding. I made him play first not just straight to the $
---
They were both falsa perma bans...
---
Lending T-Bow 100m 24hours.
---
Moving the bosses out of multi achieves nothing.  Everyone can still bring minimal risk and not fight back using wilderness weapons, which are the best DPS anyway.  The idea of pkers chasing pvmers in the wilderness just leads to pkers being a nuissance for players trying to earn gp and pet hunters.
---
r/lostredditors
---
No problem man! Just helping out :)
---
It wasnt a fresh account, and if thats the case how come b0aty didnt get banned a couple years back when he dumped like 400m on a fresh account to make that 90 range 10 hp dark bower?
---
It changes everything because you can actually survive as a solo player, rather than getting 1 banged by 100 people. Removing clans monopoly rev protection scheme.
---
Sorry you lack the reading comprehension to understand this is all hypothetical in the chance that OP is absolutely certain he never got the funny feeling notification.
---
I even addressed being able to get the pet after dying, because this could be a very tick perfect scenario of the pet spawning on the game tick the server is teleporting you to your respawn, leaving the pet wandering your zulrah shrine like all pets do when their owner dies.
---
Do you even read the comment you're replying to?
---
PKing should not be a guaranteed money making method.  It makes no sense.
---
Your lifetime Guardian membership is still valid, too!
---
I wouldn't say that was misleading. Jagex knew it would work on bosses like Graador; they demoed it in Graardor even. They changed Graardor post-release probably more because players didn't realize it, just like how they changed blowpipe in PvP because players didn't realize how good it would be there.
---
But when Jagex gives the formula for how it works and makes a chart, how much more can they do?  Do you expect them to calculate and list the DPS against every monster? If they only did some, they'd surely miss somewhere it would end up being meta... At some point, you need to admit it is the player's fault for having the information and failing to use it properly and not Jagex's fault for lacking or misleading information.
---
Figured out how to fix it :) thank you for your help. OBS WORKS!
---
It shouldn't but it should at minimum cover the costs of resupply. Come out equal.
---
The "hours played" are based on EHP.
---
Most people struggle getting 1 EHP/hr actually doing the EHP method. Ehp for crafting, for instance, is air battlestaves, and given he shows doing a black dhide item for the last exp, he likely did black bodys most of the way. EHP is wildly misleading and doesnt accurately estimate play time
---
Bil an hour? They have 1000 bots running on one windows 95 pc?

Allright, you sold me
---
Now to figure out what the hell to do about slayer
---
Bruh they ain’t that bad, it’s just a little bit of flesh penetration and squirty squirty of Swamp mans ass juice, and Lynx Titans blood clots.
---
I stay looting gems in MLM
---
uh listen to me and not these other dorks. There is actually a lot accomplish in f2p like fly fishing, woodcutting, mining, all the f2p quests...  then maybe after all that, get members.

I thought the snow globe was in the game already and this being the event that gives it to you. Also sad my old rs2 account got hacked and had to make an account that  was then unable to have the snow globe :(. Thank God for osrs!
---
You can already easily survive as a solo player.  No idea what the rev protection scheme has to do with anything?  You want revs in single too?  That's actually laughable.
---
Tanning is when your body increases the production of melanin in your skin glands, in order to protect from the sun. 
---
A sun burn is skin damage, there’s a difference. 
---
Any exposure to the sun causes gradual damage to the skin. Tanning is a defense mechanism against not, not a result of damaged skin. 
---
Technically every breath of air we takes damages our lungs, every step we take damages our joints and bones, etc.
---
too late, welcome to EoC economy
---
how can it be botted for 1b a hour??
---
Ya but... Anyone remember Endless Online?
---
Wtf, Wow that is so bad. Why would they ever do that for an item that was so easy to get before
---
because you look like a total braindead noob without it. people at cox/tob even make fun of people for only having fire capes lol, and i mean you really won't "sweat" the waves before jad are literally afk you barely have to pay any type of attention and jad is just a bit of attention, just switch your prayers right and you are immortal.
---
I remember this so fondly. I remember I'd wait till people were almost done finishing the snowman base and then I'd sneak in and add my own head lol
---
First ever limited rare in RuneScape. TRADEABLE SNOWMAN HATS, each player will receive one random one. Each gives you the power to turn into a different snowman. Works like a ring of stone/ring of third age(transform)
---
*Players must have membership to obtain new rares, no “free membership”/twitch prime during Holiday event or time before it is released. 
---
DID YOU KNOW: A “rare” item already exists in osrs. The disk of returning/half jugs of wine have not been re released into osrs since 2017. (Outrage) ... they’re sitting around 6k in the g.e.
---
Leaving this open, but maybe you get a “Christmas present” at the end, which allows you to choose a snowman hat... once you choose it’s like that for ever.
---
Possible gold sink?... perhaps once you have received your hat, it becomes temporarily untradable. To make it tradeable again, you must speak to diango and have him “wrap” your snowman hat again for a fee, which allows it to be tradeable to the g.e.  Present(warrior), present(magician), present(ranger) etc. Then once another player buys it they’ll automatically receive the snowman hat they purchased, unwrapped form.
---
The hats could also be made so they can be worn without transforming into a snowman.
---
Cuz it was years back and the anti cheat wasnt the same

Well if it makes you feel any better I got mine on maples at ~50 and then lost to it at ents when I first got to the WC guild

The sun also plays a pivotal role in maintaining our health. It provides essential vitamins, re-orientates our nocturnal clock, and assists in maintaining chemical balances in our brain that prevent depression.

Not with the same account.

And i am a braindead noob lol. But again, why be concerned with others people fun and what they are wearing.

Wow I remember this too welp but forgot everything until now thank you for bringing back good memories

It’s time

Imbue you’re graceful hood and get graceful good (I) and you can charge it with a max of 3 stamina pots. 1.5m to imbue

it might've been a children's game back in the day but it's not at all now. i haven't even met anyone below 21 on the game.
---
its called FLIPPING... ^(/s)
---
I like seeing you get downvoted by people mad because they lack the knowledge to do the same thing
---
Lol that ain't grandmaster though like OP claims. If your agility is any decent you blaze through those quests.
---
Only grandmaster quest in Elf series is SotE and even that quest is not too bad, just Seren was a small pain in the ass for me.
---
you're not as bad as you think, you're just severely overestimating the fight caves like most people do. it's very piss easy content
---
WhErEs YoUr FiRe CaPe
---
Thanks and Yes! Just the teleport convinced me to get it before any other.
---
sit somewhere safe and practicing clicking on mage pray, then ranged, then mage, and do it 100 times. That's all jad is with a few extra clicks. Calm down and get that right.
---
I just dont want to do it lol, always hated wave defense. It will probably be the last thing i do in the game
---
you're
---
You might wanna put off buying a cannon if you can barely afford it. Cannonballs aren’t cheap.
---
Changes like this make me pay more for bonds. No good
---
I’m an iron as my main so I’m with you there but some of the changes proposed really would fuck over the pvp community which is a community still
---
It's weird to me, because I was under the impression that one of the big reasons for this rework was to stop the heavy abuse the emblem farming bots were doing to the economy. And now they just made it ten times worse and added even more incentive to abuse the hell out of it.
---
Its also higher accuracy and defense...
---
My god... why...
---
lol calm down
---
You're not unlucky. OP is just incredibly lucky, and expecting to also be that lucky is only going to make you sad
---
I hope you can find peace one day
---
That's why you should've done magics, afk and money instead of just afk.
---
I don't really agree. If you aren't super familiar with how skills work, what to train, what to do, upgrading immediately offers way too much options and can easily confuse you.
---
 I had a buddy I gave a bond to when he started playing and told him to do Waterfall Quest. After that he just didn't know what to do, didn't understand what level armors were/how things unlocked and ultimately just quit playing because it really screwed him out of that early game content.
---
Ahhh okay, that would certainly be interesting.
---
What's sad is you assuming I was complaining to begin with
---
It's like 1 or 2 kgs not worth the tacky look imo
---
Honestly I get bored way too fast training construction to care. I get maybe a level a day and then I just run off and do more slayer tasks. I really only train construction after a few kraken tasks and I have a whole bunch of planks hoarded away.
---
Well the 
---
&gt; :(
---
at the end of your sentence seemed like a pretty good indicator you were feeling sad
---
Looks good to me
---
My guess is that locked Zulrah means less scales ingame for blowpipe which is used for alchemical hydras.
---
As a heads up just did my 99 construction with the dungeon Doors. There is a way to have zero mouse movement saved my wrist. Then it's all about the clicks for max efficient.

he didnt pay off 20b debt today. hes at like 57b right now in debt
---
Nah just a dumb comment made for shits and giggles. Not everything is serious on the internet. Why be sad over a virtual pet.
---
Not yet. I wouldn’t really fear it either if I were you. 
---
While it makes sense for Zulrah to be locked behind a grandmaster level quest (look at DS2 for example), there’s no way they could do it now without the community reeeeeing. It’s not even the diary that’s the issue. They could allow a one time kill or something (could easily be fit in lore wise) and then lock it until SotE completion. But there’s no way it would pass a poll given how long it’s been out, and I don’t think they could possibly change it as an unpolled QoL update without humongous backlash. 
---
So TL;DR, while it makes sense for them to quest lock it further, I don’t think you have to worry about that ever happening.
---
Is that four Yugis? I didn't know my ass could pucker this hard
---
Ahh, yes. What better place to get it than at the runecrafting guild itself.
---
Oh my god I remember this event! This was when I first started playing RS too! Bring this event back!!
---
Why don't they just make PVP a separate game while they're at it?

Jad isn't really a test of gear and stats, more so just not messing up.

No fancy mechanics involved, just the fact that you've spent an hour in there and getting nervous and switching wrong will end your run instantly.

nice to see the wilderness active again

Time to poll 200m as the new 99 instead of 13 whatever 
---
Get rid of non BIS 99 capes.

I don't mind too much. I enjoy ironman a lot more than I did my main and it makes for a good story. Honestly I'd say just don't stake.
---
no u
---
If there is any point in time you couldn't be attacking, your cannon will stop.
---
1. Its insanely rare to get false banned, fearing false bans is almost as ridiculous as being afraid of getting struck by lightning.
---
2. Your claim that you need to be a streamer to lift a perm ban is false, plenty of people have had permanent bans lifted by using the appeal process.
---
The reason i'm "afraid of option b"(not really afraid just kinda annoyed to see it everywhere) is because its exaggerated, we've already had plenty of relevant posts at the top of the subreddit discussing incident a, and its fear mongering.
---
I've already seen plenty of people talking about not wanting to get back into the game for this particular reason, and I find it ridiculous given that its such a rare issue.
---

Only a piece of shit like Stringer Bell would download RuneScape macros
---
That's only like $7500 at $1 per m tho
---
You mean you forgot to drop it period
---
Someone was saying some of the reward stuff is abusable by ironmen
---
How does the crystal bow w/armor compare to the blowpipe at hydra? I've been wanting to try it out for fun but don't want to spend the money on the armor set since I won't really use it.
---
Source? Site?
---
I’m 10hp uim and it’s slowly becoming my main. Only reason I want to break my 10hp build is to work toward fire cape. But wow is that grind long. Unless I get a ton of pots etc from hunter
---
No it isnt lol
---
I think it has to do with black jacking actually taking focus and some level of skill to get the high exp rates, but with menu swapping it just makes it a spam click. On the other hand “use bones” instead of “right click - use bones” may be easier but it didn’t really require much effort in the first place and might save the wrist a bit.
---
Yes, the same way a botter can run multiple accounts in a bot farm. For example, zulrah may make 1.5m an hour for a bot, but if you run 3 bots, you get 4.5m an hour. But imagine if a botter, purely by being sneaky, was able to make 20m per hour PER ACCOUNT. This is the current bh system. The EP system would require lots of accounts like everything else, with no bonus for boosting, and most importantly, it REQUIRES RISK. What bots sit in the wildy with 300k+ risk? Any bots that do would get murdered lol. There's the insta logging bots that used to be at chins, but again, simple modifications can fix this (dmm system, or must stay logged in for the past hour to gain EP, or no logging in a hot zone).  
---
     
---
Every single money maker in this game, bot farms will find a way to abuse. There are plenty of safe npcs to kill that don't require risking 300k in the wildy. People seem to separate EP boosting from pvm, they're both just ways to generate items from game mechanics (killing a player, or killing an npc).
---
my favorite holiday events is where they used to spawn masks and pumpkins and party hats all over the place
---
rip rsc
---
THIS IS NOT CANON!
---
Oh right I thought you did that yourself lol.
---
At 1/32k, you could also get several twisted bows from raids. Why don't people just do raids instead? Because you can't control when you get a rare drop. That's what the word random means.
---
It's a 2D image but if I had to guess and if that was a rail capable of grinding on I'd say an fs smith grind
---
Less you care about rdt drop better you feel. I stopped giving a damn about those a long time ago and they don't bother me at all.
---
Is this a troll or do you not understand why he says he's half way
---
You can use one of those totems to fight Skotizo for a guaranteed shard drop!
---
Jagex should have locked that you need play time of 300+ hours to receive points from pvp, so at least botters wouldnt be able to abuse the pvp update.....
---
Also you're wearing ice gloves so you don't get the set effect anyway
---
It's time
---
It's not unreasonable to release content on a thursday. People get to enjoy it over a weekend, and any issues shake out to be fixed on Monday.
---
The bigger issue is JageX really butchered this launch, and now doesn't have a rapid response team to remedy it. 
---
But I imagine in a more controlled environment, giving players a few days to dig into the content can be beneficial. Assuming that the content itself is well planned and strong prior to launching. 
---
The practice itself, when done right, makes sense.
---
Only if you knew what those really were
---
This won't help you to stop forgetting to drink.
---
It definitely is a form of endorsement. I just wish they would come out and say it like "we're co-opting runelite. It is now the official client". That's the dream for me.
---
I feel bad for writing such a short response to such a well thought out response lol but that's really helpful, thank you sir :) and I shall add you for sure :) I'll dm you my name so you know who it is lol
---
The way I suggested is following the precident set by other NPCs you can pickpocket so I thought it might be a cleaner approach to the issue.
---
It’s a joke referencing someone saying “oh I just got 50, half way there to 99!”
---
I actually did try that with the first shard I got. Hitting constant 0's with darklight, not much better with whip. Teled out after 5 mins and only getting him down to 3/4 health.
---
But it's soooo cute :)
---
If you want offensive hybrid shield and it to have dfs defenses + imunity from basilisk freeze? That's way too much shit put to one item. That shield would be op at PvP first of all. Other than that why would we need hybrid shield?
---
How do you start that :)
---
I shed 1 tear of guthix to this
---
?
---
Huge nerf to the Stamin'pot bridge
---
This honestly isnt too bad when if youre getting like 10 points per raid. Quite unlikely to go this dry if youre getting 25k points.
---
It’s so worth it to use a butler. It makes the skill (at your xp rates) literally three times faster. That’s 50-100+ hours you could be spending on other skills. All power to the demon butler.
---
On top of it, wintertodt is genuinely fun, the only downside is that the cold damage interrupts actions which is just... fucking annoying tbh.
---
Man, imagine if we got a DS version of Runescape back then.
---
Locked behind grandmaster quest and currently over 25mil.....
---
I was using this method. However the butler likes to spawn in the door corridor with me sometimes instead of outside, which would require me to click in a different area. But for the most part, I had the no mouse movement method down.
---
You get twice as much xp per bone at chaos altar, how is that not useful.
---
people must be really blind to never have spotted those buttons
---

---
If you break it down into numbers, I’m spending ~85m for 99, whereas with mahogany planks I’d be spending ~190m. It’d take me way longer to recover from that extra 100m loss than it would to sacrifice a few hundred thousand exp per hour. That’s how I look at it, at least.
---
One can hope, and yeah I do know that it's their fault they should've not let thirdparty clients slide for so long they're now having the consequences of doing so.
---
It's not an Aussie clan, but there's a few of us in it. Check out 'Sociality'
---
You have to look at it from there point of view. Bots these days are almost impossible to catch because of how advance the software is for bots especially with mobile. And it’s just gonna get harder to catch. Jagex is not a billion dollar company and because of that they will never have the ability to really control the problem like these big tech companies can. It’s at the point where they should adapt to bots rather then control it. Unless you want to pay more for membership we can’t expect RuneScape to control this as much as we would like it to be. You have to understand how hard this is to detect and how hard it is to stop boting completely. They really do the best with the resources they are given
---
Wow huge wave of nostalgia just hit me from seeing this pic. I remember meeting my best friend in the game and his brother and we'd play all the time together and talk all the time from that point on, then I remember one day he told me he wasn't going to play anymore and I was so sad about it, great times man i miss it
---
Mmm i was talking about chance to get the pet, not how many people have the pet. Same for heron, it is quite rare to get but many people have it. Do i make sense?
---
That’s the biggest oof ever.
---
It’s 1 am, I finally got the baby down and I blurt our laughing. Thank you.
---
It stood for "earning potential" I think, it's the old version of bh that used to be in the original game during the time free trade was removed, I guess a lot of players haven't played that long. You have a percentage that goes up to 100, and the more you have the more loot you get per kill, and you lose some of it every kill, and gain some every x minutes you are in the wilderness while risking money. It was made by a Jagex that was much more willing to help pvp and was much better done than anything Jagex has proposed recently although from what I remember it was a bit too much GP/hr.
---
I would bet my left nut there will be a significant enough amount of people griefing to really drag down other's experience, please reconsider
---
Again, it's the third most common skilling pet and about 3x more common than the rarest (not counting Herbi ofc)
---
HOW DARE YOU STAND WHERE HE STOOD
---
That's just because of the free trade removal. Here I just mean extra loot on top of the kill, so 500k + 0 on low ep.
---
all pure kills earn 100k now (0 streak), that is broken
---
And don't forget the occasional report they receive from a helpful player. If it wasn't for the report button they'd be able to 'detect' even less bots lmao.
---
Hi why does my attack “go down” when I fight and slowly goes back up?
---
This might be an unpopular opinion but I'm not finding bots to be a problem in game anymore. Everything jagex have been doing is making a difference for me. As you say, adapting to bots is easier than controlling it. They used to be a nightmare, using up all the resources in game but so much has changed in terms of skilling methods and achievement barriers. Bits may still be prevalent, producing huge amounts of gold, RWT and damaging the economy but honestly it's not stopping me play the game I want to play like it did years ago.
---
 Obviously Jagex are not done, they'll have to keep working on this but eradication will never realistically be the goal.
---
Yeah what i was getting at is the people they are actually catching are manual bans besides from f2p suicides
---
?????
---
L0000l are you an actual brainlet dude or are you trolling me? Youve gone full circle, no one here was talking about the amount of pets other people have. Just how low the chance of getting the pet is. I dont give a fuck if scapers overall do more mining than farming.
---
Would devalue my POH only UIM
---
How do I get free membership trial?
---
&gt;doing slayer won't beat just straight up grinding vork/zulrah ~~for a long long time though~~
---
The quote "Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that." really rings true on this one.
---
People open that interface thousands of time in their RS life, and not even once do they try out the button to at least find out what it is there for.
---
You lose 200k every death with craws... You don't need to make it a 13m risk stop being retarded.
---
It’s poorly named to be sure lol.
---
Doing rs2 christmas event in 2005 was like the most magical moment in my life
---
What the hell? Others are claiming the same. It wasn't me who deleted it. Like, what the fuck is going on?
---
Well, I ain't surprised if a troll did his best to pull my accomplishment down to the ground out from envy or something else. Oh well, at least the memory remains in my and those who get to see.
---
I need more of this haha
---
I whole heartedly agree. I've made this argument a few times, but the highlight of any mmo for me was holiday events. Along with festivities, it allowed game devs to become creative and seeing their innovative ideas each year always lightened my eyes as a child. Guild wars 1 was probably my second favourite (as well as a club penguin I GUESS) when it came to events.
---
How you gonna sit in ur car with no seat tho homie.
---
It's at the end of arguably the most challenging questline, with some (5) of the highest skill requirements for quests. And if Zulrah is midgame then why does it drop 3 BiS endgame items and challenge end game profit/hr? Well the easy answer is that Zulrah is actually midgame it just so happens that Jagex and the community had no idea how strong the items would be (mostly Jagex is to blame for poor polling back in the day, and balancing - and the FIVE nerfs it got etc while still being overpowered). So instead of nerfing the Zulrah uniques (because they stupidly already built content based around how op the stuff is) they are going to make it an endgame boss by locking it behind sote.
---
I’m getting some pretty decent xp rates with viggoras chainmace at elder druids. I’m aware that they are low gp per hour, but will I at least break even on mace cost?
---
Totally agree, if you can afford it and are playing, members is the way to go 10000%
---
What exactly is the loot?
---
By attack do you mean attack level? You could be fighting a slayer monster that requires protection. Or using a Sara brew, beer, etc.
---
They already said they would either remove the task entirely or put it on the elite section. The change to put it locked behind Song of the Elves has not happened yet.
---
I enjoyed this very much, thank you
---
no problem and thanks :D
---
Ohh I see. So magic and alcohol makes the attack level go down?
---
Is it true that he literally went insane and donated his life savings, including wedding fund, to Bernie Sanders?
---
&gt; Question is it worth the investment, what niche areas will the Crystal Bow have? 
---
Pure ranging at Zulrah with full crystal and switching between bow and blowpipe. Like 500 k/hr less profit then trident+blowpipe but it's an easier method of killing Zulrah.
---
&gt; From the looks of it, it isn't worth recharging over black d-hide and armadyl crossbow. 
---
Similar dps. More prayer bonus. Loosing shield slot since crystal bow is two-handed.
---
It's lose btw. Loose is the opposite of tight. Lose is the opposite of win / gain
---
You can easily afk 300 hours in f2p without being picked up on bot detection. Something realistic they could have done is keep the emblem system the same as old bh where you needed to risk an emblem in order to get one as a drop - this wouldn't stop bots but it would make it worth killing them. Currently they can risk literally nothing and still make quite a lot just through sheer numbers.
---
Yeah, to the authorities because it must illegal for Ash to look that good in a shirt
---
Regicide is master not grandmaster :x
---
Sounds good. Worth it over serp tho?
---
Thank you! \^\^ I will keep up training and become better. :)
---
just do the quests on the board in the lobby of the museum
---
Ah, got it. That makes sense. Thanks for the idea! :)
---
well then 300 played hours on members world
---
Also if you menu swap to one-click blackjack, you can just spam click for an indefinite amount of time, completely removing any semblance of game interaction. Using bones on an altar still requires you to run between a bank or unnoter NPC, and if you didn't want to manually use each bone, the default behaviour lets you afk with no interaction at all.
---
\&gt; Even then, the majority of the wealth is transferred rather than coming into the game as drops (like zulrah/vork). 
---
? Literally all of the wealth generated by the new BH is put into the game as opposed to transferred.
---
\&gt;  Zulrah has been in it for years, all the time being botted yet a brand new update comes out for pkers and is shit on. 
---
Zulrah
---
a) cannot be convinced to stand still while you kill her
---
b) isn't accessible to accounts mass-created within 30 minutes
---
c) there has never been and there never will be a 1 bil/h bot/gold farm for zulrah.  This new "content" had one in less than a day.  And once/if jagex starts banning the bots, they'll just switch to manual gold farming thats near impossible to stop.
---
I'm happy to have cleared it up for you since you aren't very knowledgeable about the game.  
---
\&gt; It's so disheartening and really puts you off the game. 
---
What puts me off the game is when money-hungry goblins are willing to destabilize the entire economy (again) if it means making a quick buck. 
---
PVP makes fine money.  You wanting to be richer isn't an excuse to be ok with content that is this absurdly bottable to the point of damaging game integrity, christ.
---
Hey bro come into L0st Dynasty cc we would love to have you! We always going people going somewhere, we do every bit of content you could think of. Med sized clan with a lot of very high leveled players looking for people who want to learn and grow along with the clan. On top of that we aren’t assholes about playtime, we understand irl shit comes first so you can still earn rank without worry :D I’m one of the leaders TTTankey :) stop in bro and say what’s up and if I’m not in tell them I sent you! There’s several of us all working towards max as of right now so by all means we could use the extra friend
---
Just make a level 30 baby pure and sweep up the bots.
---
Its not nearly as significant, that's the point. They won't gain more than someone who just kills people normally. If someones only making like 800k an hour, who cares? They have to be in the wildy with risk, meanwhile they could just make 1m an hour doing barrows or something, and barrows is pretty braindead and zero risk so yea. The issue is when they can make 30m an hour boosting. Then it becomes a problem.
---
How can you log in on the phone and not see your email?
---
there’s just a button that says “log in through game center” you just tap it and it logs you in
---
Hell yeah man we had a solid group of 4 or 5 people that played, were all still good friends and we've all picked it up randomly to play still
---
What headgear is your character wearing?
---
Thats what keeps people playing I guess, you wait for the right fuckups and get rich just like irl
---
Stop spite voting when people stop spite playing.
---
Hey if ur a cunt, 'll vote no again and again.
---
wouldnt surprise me since you basically print money
---
I think we should just all vote no to everything because adding new shit to the game isn't what OSRS is about. They have already added enough. The whole point of this coming back was to give us the old game back that everyone loved not another branch to expand out from.
---
Meric being an instagative pos, what's new ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It took me  219 games at around 16 hours if my guess is correct from the notes I had. I also got 294 kills and had 5 total wins. I ended in Legend rank (1001).
---
He’s wearing close to 1b in gear with 75 combat stats. I doubt he’s a main.
---
I thought that dry just means you haven't got the drop yet. So if you go 1 kill without getting it, then you're 1 kill dry.
---
you still have to rely on it for bonds
---
Why runecrafting?
---
Ran slow as fuck on my pc but man it was fun sailing round om your own ship
---
Hopefully the farmers get to sell it instead of just getting banned :(

Try that link ^
---
If you dont trust the link the  just type in on Google "forgotten login osrs".
---
Then on the page click "still stuck - no - no -maybe we can help".
---
Yeah, it is really rare, most people don't get it before 99 mining. Beware, though, if you die with the pet you lose it if not insured, so make sure you insure it(at Probita in Ardougne), 500k gp cost at your levels seems a steep cost but losing it would be a massive tragedy. If you can't afford, just keep in bank in the meanwhile.
---
See I actually use OSbuddy. Either way, I'd like to know if that feature is gone. It will surely be missed if so.
---
Everything about this makes me so nostalgic, the spongebob socks, the jammie dodger wrappers... I actually had a tan from going outside to play.. lool
---
Do u not understand how math works? Damn sweaty need
---
why so few upvotes on this, its great
---
fuck off I used 700 bones on my ironmeme in wildy altar yesterday
---
Wouldn’t work cause then you have infinite run energy at bosses like sara.
---
Time to find the bot farm created around July.
---
Crystal armor is great for hydra. The prayer bonus is more valuable than the little extra range bonus you lose, at least with a tbow. Not sure about other weapon methods though. 50kill trips without flicking isn’t too uncommon which is nice.
---
With bh update being abused and injecting ton of gold into game what items are good investment?
---
Get a computer.
---
Similarly my mum would always use those disposable cameras up until about 2005 or so when my dad decided to buy a digital camera. Haven't seen one since.
---
I wish they added mpre f2p quests
---
Yeah but now range is vastly superior to melee, range scape. Between blowpipe being good for every single mob and tbow being good for every mob blowpipe isn’t good for.
---
Sure but we’re talking every 200m
---
jmod bloodhound
---
Average does not equal half.
---
I think you're in the wrong "50%" too buddy.
---
Crystal armour is bis at hydra for staying longer cause of the prayer bonus
---
So like putting down skyrim to try fallout
---
Can't believe people don't understand other people will vote for whoever they think has the best chance to actually get them out of the 4th Reich.
---
 It’s just too easy to obtain imo. If it was a 1/2k from zulrah or something I could only imagine it would then cost a price that makes more sense to its power and it wouldn’t feel as out of place.
---
i added str bonus from faceguard in the other tab as its not in this dps calc
---
Because there’s a lot of false positive bans. Imagine putting years of effort into something and you get perm banned for something you didn’t do. Then find out there isn’t customer support outside of viral twitter and Reddit posts. Gonna be a little salty.
---
There must be so much gp going into the game, this is fucked!
---
The principle still stands, Don't try and down play it.
---
Jagex are and always will be, FUCKING USELESS.
---
I guess I'm the mug for still playing their game and giving them the money they don't deserve.
---
F
---
Suppose it all depends on what you had in mind when it was announced. For me it was never a replacement for playing on pc, just a cool way to get some xp in situations when I can’t sit at my pc. 
---
Fair enough if you personally don’t have any use for it but I find it a godsend
---
Tales of Pirates, anybody?
---
Pvmers already have a 3 item advantage over pker and this item will get abused by pkers to easily pk others for their +1's.
---
Depends who is using your software.
---
For a 24/7 game like RS then yes, even doing a release at night is a bad idea which is why updates are the middle of Thursday.
---
For an enterprise app used by a business the service agreement may only be weekdays, so a release on evenings or even Friday can be fine. If overtime is a thing (normally not in software but w/e) then Friday is better than during the week because you have days to fix your mess.
---
I remember when my parents finally got a new computer and I got the old one. It sat at a desk outside my room and I spent countless hours sitting playing. That thing was such a hunk of junk. But it worked for me.
---
some of the divine potions are just not worth to use, so they are not selling that much. divine attack potion is one of them. the only ones selling at the moment are divine ranging potions and divine super combat potions afaik.

Shit idea. Don’t go wildy if you don’t want to get attacked lmao it’s not hard

you should crop this and repost it

It was never nerfed in pvm but quick reminder that it used to be just as stong in pvp as it is in pvm
---
What a dunce

stop giving out free membership and stop putting in shit that people can abuse to make billions of pure gp per second ok? this is worse than the twisted bow dupe, you know.

That is why I came here, thank for the advice, so do not do trees? Only the ones are ore planted? I keep watermelon, Snape grass, torstol, lily, and poison brush planted. So most of the time it's okay, but when comes to trees, I'm not sure if it's recommended or not.
---
I mean that guy is a dick but he isn't wrong. If op doesn't know the account details then he is shit out of luck. No tweeting a jmod isn't going to do anything. There is 0 chance a jmod is going to say "oh you don't know any of the account info but you really really promise this was your account so here is the login info and a reset for you." He already is in the right place but doesn't know the account information.

Use lovakite ore on him

Left click use, then left click on altar.
---
This, but I'm pretty sure I read u cant share and have someone do something like fire Cape for you. I could be wrong but I'd say just dont tell anyone and you'll be fine I'm sure.
---
Congratulations! How many attempts did it take you? What were your beginning and ending stats?
---
the same happened to me right before eoc, a year or so before, I got d claws on my pure with a pk and transferred it to my main cause I was poor as fuck both accounts then got emailed by jagex to apeal an imminent ban but I ignored it cause I got phished before and wasnt even playing (cause eoc) and both acc's got deleted :(
---
I don’t think you’d get banned but wouldn’t you rather just do it yourself? I mean pvm only gets harder after fight caves, learning to do them and beating it yourself is like the first big step into the pvm world or at least it was for me.
---
How so? If you're a pker you can decide not to attack the person wielding the flag

The community is dumb

Chaos runes regularly leave the game.  Onyxes don’t.  If it was the increased supply of chaos runes, you would see a the price stabilize shortly after falling.
---
Wtf? What is this new project that they're working on?
---
If he can remember the username and where he created it from (surely he knows where he was living) then surely jagex can look, see that it hasnt been logged onto since 2001 and give him it. What's the chances of a hacker knowing those details about a 18 year old account and even if they did, what would they lose?
---
My dad would download 3 antivirus scanners because more is better and blame RuneScape for the computer being slow.

does the dragon pickaxe boost my mining tier? and does it stack with stew or dwarven stout?
---
Why so? You can decide to not attack the player with the flair. Or bring a dds/ wep than ags claws to ko
---
Those are litterly the questions on the form that is getting denied.
---
You can’t account share to manipulate leaderboards or mini games. This includes the inferno as well. Fight caves it’s perfectly acceptable.
---
Or you know you just hop worlds
---
It's not a 3 item advantage when 90% of the time fighting back gets you skull tricked.
---
Account Sharing hasn't been against rules for years. Only bannable if you aim for EHP records or do Inferno.
---
Fire Cape is safe, as are quests. Obviously risky to give account to anyone but whatever.
---
Ah there you go. I couldn't remember but I knew there was a catch.

so how does it stop someone from pulling out the flag in any pvp fight to instantly smite the person?

and the wilderness is the only unsafe pvp zone in the whole game. if u dont like its mechanics dont go into it.or bring less risk. no one is forcing you to bring x amount of risk in

2 levels hah

Make them all into assemblers, why not? Lol plus you can risk them in wild for clues and such

2) spellbook quests lunar diplomacy and desert treasure - while you might not use them all the time or at every content these spellbooks are highly useful, offering utility spells and multi target spells and healing.
---
3) void, diaries - again while it's not used everywhere in osrs, the void and elite void offer some great bonuses which can save you a lot on equipment if you start raids in elite void.
---
4) nightmare zone - used to imbue rings of power like the berserker ring or ring of suffering to double their stats
---
5) slayer - getting a high slayer level unlocks a lot of solo bosses towards the higher levels, and also unlocks superior monsters for slayer tasks.
---
_______
---
honestly train your stats up a lot before you even bother trying to boss, the point is that at low stats barrows will lose money esp without diary due to lower efficiency
---
All jokes aside I dont think much tbf one combat level and a str prayer I think
---
Get your head out of your ass. No one cares that they're Venezuelans, people care that they play strictly to RWT later and fuck with the game's economy. Being unable to communicate with them is another point of friction.
---
Americans are mad at Russians too, these days. Would you also call that racism? Learn what fucking context is.
---
So 15?
---
People sell accounts or sell the quest completion and these dudes farm Zalcano all day.
---
but then the venezuelan gold farms would be left untouched
---
oh no the economy!! - a lvl 67 with a 2m bank
---
I don't disagree that one is worse than the other, but I'd argue that you're incorrect about it not being subjective - saying "this one is okay because it reduces fewer clicks than others" falls out of the scope of banning all plugins that reduce clicks
---
It's always worth to kill all 6 because that gives you an extra roll on the drop table
---
&gt; Bring me an imbued ring of suffering and 5 million coins
---
EZ. Zulrah grind crew checking in
---
Nah I got 3A kiteshield on thursday on 83rd hard as an ironmeme
---
More like 75k
---
I don’t see any correlation with those events, would like a mod smack down tho
---
I did it and got 10 noted flax took me like 5 minutes and 42 seconds to figure out Bee Keeper gets the dismiss now lol
---
deleted post
---
Wtf it actually existed? I thought it was just concept art being pushed closer and closer to the pit meme where jagex shoots it in the back.
---
How long did it take you?
---
Lol the comments up top were literally flaming venezuelans just for camping zalcano. Yes a lot of them rwt but you don’t know if they do or if they’re even fucking venezuelan. The only ones who need to be accountable are jagex for letting people run botting and rwt circles around them.
---
And it’s still somewhat skill related to have perfect clicks moving from the bone in your inventory to the alter, where blackjacking, you could close your eyes while listening to some tits out streamer doing asmr and just spam click on one spot. So ya I’m 100% with you on that.
---
I've done some research on how we can combat the bh bots and we simply can't, but we can make it difficult for them.
---
The problem is that we can't catch them in level 1 and they also teleport away when they see a white dot.
---
These are a few ways that come to mind to make it easier for us to catch them.
---
* You cannot teleport or log out if you are waiting for a target
---
* You cannot get a target in level 1
---
* You can only teleport or log out above level 20 wildy in BH unless you kill someone
---
* limit the places where you can get a target.
---
I understand that those rules also apply to the real players and that makes it difficult but I am sure we can come up with something to kill them more easily!
---
Great to hear!
---
We need more artists in the community!
---
"The bot detection is good and catches almost everything except for what's run by advanced gold farmer companies." Dude just stfu if you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Im pretty sure i have a snowglobe on osrs
---
Eh it's pretty avg, my gpa is a bit low so idk
---
panic buy 3a longswords
---
If that's what he meant then sure, but It's in the context of this PK activity being botted though and it read to me that he was saying: I don't blame the PvM community for creating bots then coming to PvP content and botting it.
---
Botting is a gamewide problem, and is not specific to either community, so I think singling out the "PvM community" vs. "PvM botters" is what threw me off.
---
Holy shit Paul looks different irl
---
Pretty cool although there is one rotation with two possibilities
---
Brings back the good old memories. Back then I had to wait till my parents went out to play RuneScape because I wasn't allowed to do gaming. I secretly cracked the PC's password and stealthily played RuneScape and then turned everything off right before they came back. Such a thrill!
---
Not talking about PVM.
---
if you arent even planning to get firecape yourself why even play the game?
---
What? This is like the 30th post on the new emblem farming. Plus you can just look at the price for ancestral or lance or jaw since Thursday. The inflation is obvious
---
Same kph though...
---
Melee gets claws (bgs if poor). Thats whats missing, melee spec &gt;&gt; range spec. Melee doesnt have to make (buy) bolts.
---
Also, the way vorkaths specs work favors 4 tick weapons, otherwise you null hit on vorkaths freeze phase (which isnt considered in the dps calc- even one null hit per kill is significant...)
---
Dont get me wrong, the kph is the same. Difference is lance is also huge for cox and also makes metal dragon and blues, brutal black dragons doable for slayer. If you cant afford both the lance is way better to have overall.
---
If you can afford both its not a big difference. I find ranging a lot more afk but i also hate vorkath
---
All originated from one post saying they make one bil an hour. But how do they know ?
---
Lance and ancestral? It spiked a few mil. lol pvm equipment has been fucky for months now. Gtfo with that dramatic reddit crying nonsense.
---
I think you misunderstood. Im speaking about the pk community.
---
Venezuelan is not a race lol, so no it isn’t.
---
Back then it wasn’t called 2007 RS. We just knew it as RS
---
The pk community was pushed away now all we have left is salty pvmers and skillers.
---
Lynx Titan?
---
I remember me having to lie about my age to be able to play runescape (13+) bafore it became a client and it was still a web game
---
I plan to do that. Since some quests are so short and would only be like 2 or 3 pages, ill have to add maybe some side events to lengthen the comic
---
Should've trained agility smh...
---
Warm items for twisted league start? What are the options available ?
---
Real blast from the past, wish my parents took cool photos of me playing rs / rs2, instead of yelling at me to go outside more lol
---
Jagex failed the vibe check
---
Behaviours such as account sharing, multilogging and offensive language are indeed against the rules - Jagex just don't enforce them anymore (in most cases). 
---
An infernal cape would get you temp-banned. An illegitimate fire cape, however, would likely be considered "against the spirit of the game".
---
Prayers sent you’ll get it before 2020
---
Does prior rouge Jmods, equal current rogue jmods. Undoubtedly there is potential but you can't say 100%. Maybe like 85%.   
---
Besides if we really wanted to get mad at Jmods we should be looking at insider trading. Hence profiting off every update based off really random shit that gets tweaked/updated/announced. That's probably more common than running the underground bot farms (if applicable).
---
Ah man I had a very similar experience! When I was around 11 the first week of summer break I fell off a ladder and caught myself breaking both of my wrists. The right got the most of it so I had to learn how to play runescape using my mouse left handed!
---
Fact: no one likes a copy cat beaver meme
---
The good thing about runescape back in the day is almost any computer could run it regardless of how shit they were
---
I hope so, or I just got ripped off for doing it for all these emblems...
---
So adding an item that automatically smites u for ur +1 is a good idea? Kinda seems like this just would make skulltricking worse when it happens
---
Why not
---
It was web based, there was no client.
---
&gt;It's null because you only brought up that dhcb didn't have a good spec weapon. It does. If you actually wanna compare then lance doesn't come close to dhcb, plain and simple. You can add as much fancy gear/spec weps as you want but that's the base truth.
---
but again, same kph?
---
bp spec is not comparable to bgs or claws, like not at all.
---
&gt;I don't know what you're talking about when saying raw dpsing. 
---
your dps calc doesnt consider time lost due to eating, damage lost to reduced and null hits, and large special attack effectiveness.
---
You are asking a question about what you are missing, that's what you are missing. idk why you are arguing it.
---
No.
---
And the last blog says Runelite is FULLY compliant. Wtf do you think that means? That means EVERY SINGLE THING in runelite is allowed. So by definition, you can't read, lmao.
---
Looool and here I was just thinking my gran was a huge hoarder, she was one of those people who had like 10 biscuit tins full of sewing supplies too.
---
It costs 50gp/karambwan, but it drops ~15 seconds per trip and you spend &lt;5% of your time banking instead of 15-20% of the time banking. It would have cost ~3m to bank every karambwan he caught, but he would have saved at minimum 5-10 hours out of the 93. I consider that worth it, it only costs ~35k/hr
---
Cocaine baby
---
Absolutely ice cold move from the lads at Jagex
---
The fairy slayer master has the highest weight for them
---
Does it fully deplete the vial or can you do multiple walls with one vial ?
---
Every day at around 3:30 they unveil a table of cocaine spelling out "Happy Birthday Archie!"
---
Bot farming got out of hand, so to stop the economy from crashing they ended the crates.
---
_source: trust me, dude_
---
Priest in Peril is also required, but you probably have completed that already. It took me forever to get my first gargoyle task too.
---
So once again bh is pointless?
---
New graphics as well
---
Blow pipe doesn't have an uncharged version?
---
Curious on how creditable /u/_Blood_Fart_ is (underscores aren’t letting me link). Also curious if this gets traction if there would be a jagged response.
---
So fucking dumb.  
---
We get one update in 3 years and now everyone is freaking out about people making money.
---
We never got rid of zulrah when people were camping/botting that shit for 6m an hour.
---
Apparently now we care about integrity when it comes to pvp.
---
Get the fuck outta here
---
Welcome to the wilderness
---
Fucking shit game...
---
It is very profitable if on droprate
---
How many EHP? I've heard it takes around 18,000hrs max efficiency, but I'm a 1800 total scrub with no experience.
---
“Humor”
---
There’s a whole community still 😌 We’re lurking in the shadows but I’m glad people still remember us. Long live ❤️
---
Wow! These are so awesome! Any chance you’ll share the print files? I’d love to be able to print a few of my own.
---
 fire staff (and variants), bug lantern, evil chicken outfit (though highly unlikely to get)
---
Those seem like the only ones you can obtain without wintertodt rewards themselves.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt/Warm_clothing
---
Wish all the skill pets had different color changing skins :/
---
Can I please get the Vorkath file? My friend has printed it 5+ times for me and it requires a shit ton of supports that are impossible to remove without breaking a wing off.
---
Earmuffs are actually not warm, btw
---
Holy shit bud calm down, I'm just saying there are some conflicting pieces of information coming from Jagex so it is reasonable for people to be asking questions. Calling people idiots who can't read just shows how ignorant you are to the issue at hand.
---
Fuck barrows I’m like 70 dry. Collection log forever empty
---
Jmods are not upper management incase anyones wondering
---
Too scared to make a change now because it’s probably ‘too late’
---
Also should mention that every single new boss that gets released instantly gets compared to Zulrah. Oh look a brand new boss with more intricate mechanics and it’s only 2m/hr. Looks like I’m camping Zulrah still.
---
My bad. Removed from the comment
---
God bless, snafu serums were about to crash and my profit from temple trekking would be destroyed by me not being able to sell nail beast nails.
---
Not true, I remember for years people were worried about getting caught for multi-logging in
---
We've come full circle
---
If mage arena 2 is any solice, the worse it is on release the better it will get.
---
One appeal. Try hijacked just try it
---
 the dude got proved wrong then throws baby tantrum becuz of it
---
ops definitely the one that needs help if calm logical disscussion makes him freak out like that.
---
I can't imagine how he reacts when people are being rude to him... Yeesh
---
He was trying to farm karma, and people called him out for it. Op obviously thought this was just gunna be easy karma, especially with the "I found the bh farmer!" Comment.
---
Where are you getting 70m/hr  from??
---
1st it was 30m/hr, then 10m/hr and suddenly it’s up to 70m/hr??? Ya’ll are pulling fugazi numbers from your ass to use as the crux of your argument.
---
Grats on level 99 fire barrage
---
Just revert bh.
---
The update literally only has downsides for every single type of player in the game (including pvmers doing wildy slayer who dont even participate in pvp) except for the fact that crates gave kills more gp without having to risk high tier emblems.
---
Take away the only upside and i dont see any reason why bh shouldnt be reverted. 
---
The bh update wasnt even polled and literally noone wants to have it.
---
How did you break ur arm
---
Could just be a former employee with a grudge.
---
Ace of Spades 0.75, go to look up buildandshoot if you want to play that, I suggest you try Openspades, it's the same game and same servers but on an OpenGL engine, it looks really nice.
---
It's 1.2m a minute there is literally a clip circulating on twitch with a guide for it do the math
---
because its totally ridiculous in terms of time investment for many of those accounts and gold farmers and bot farms can just swoop in and start making GP faster than ever before? Its not that they're a different account build its that many of them take next to no effort or time to build. Honestly in PvP unless you're both risking you should get fuck all for killing each other and the reward should be the loot on the floor not imaginary points that inflate the economy by pumping in more supplies
---
Why the fuck is this allowed? EZScape...
---
Link your evidence
---
Well given I can literally have 30 bots running on my computer at a time, though I tested that with dreamscape. I dont see that I am too far off.
---
We exist!! :)
---
It takes zero skill for a botfarm runner to get a couple dozen accounts (very easy to buy off blackmarket sites for pennies on the dollar) and set them up at non-active wilderness spots to deter crashing/pkers from finding them.   
---
It takes considerably less time to make a 50 atk g mauler, when you can literally quest it to baby pure status in under 1 day versus getting the stats and quest requirements to even welfare zulrah.  
---
PvMers probably\* (\* denoting a VERY low chance of occurring) won't even try BHv2 because they can get consistently better money for lower risk elsewhere.  
---
The poll system requires a majority vote to get things to pass, other than integrity issues (or jagex giving us the middle finger and forcing shit in regardless), that means the majority of players don't care about pvp. That makes you retarded, not the majority.  
---
The controversy is more so jagex's inability to test shit thoroughly enough to where all the hiccups/bugs are found. The fact that things such as recoil damage negating a bounty task such as get a kill with a range or melee hit confirms that they didn't even anticipate recoils being used in conjunction with primary and secondary weapons.  
---
You are literally unequipped to even understand the situation.
---
Bro I ain't got time for that shit NFL is starting go to twitch RuneScape top clips if you need proof that bad
---
And they want PvP polls restricted because the updates 'Don't affect everyone'
---
I think it was more along the lines of “No one blames the PvM community for their bots so please don’t blame the PvP community for these bots since everyone thought this was a bad idea anyway”. At least that’s how I read it.
---
This is very relatable. Sometimes I would go to my grandmother’s house after school with my sister and we’d sit in front of her old computer and play Runescape, Webkinz, Club penguin, etc. Good times!!!
---
Basically you can Afk these crabs for like 20mins at a time, then you click like 3 times snd do it again.
---
They also drop fossils that you can turn in for xp lamps, so he's been in this one spot, and to show for it he has an invy full of fossils.
---
Exactly. You don’t have any proof to back up your claims. Kick off isn’t even for 15 mins. You got time.
---
Did you get it back? It’s logged in right now.
---
Well, the crates are not the problem but the botbusting service of Jagex is. When BH 2 is played as intended, the gp/hr would be based on your skilllevel "something i like alot". You are obviously stating that the crates are at fault, not the people abusing the system.
---
But no credible sources either nor mention of how they know this
---
So let's pretend this is real for a second.
---
How would he prove it? He would need to out himself and probably would get taken to court for slandering them.
---
Yah Jagex doesnt give three shits about bots
---
&gt; Not a hole at all.
---
Not with that attitude it's not, /u/PM_ME_YOUR_GAY_FUR.
---
watch oakdice make conspiracy video out of this lmao
---
Can't believe the clowns including torvesta thinking that this is a bad move because people bot other content. BH requires no stats and allows you to make insane amounts of money/hr with no risk precisely because you can just grab the prime sub with a new account and do it again.
---
Dammit I was days late snagging that username unfortunately
---
Bro did you even go to a bh world?
---
❤️
---
Well the problem is that everyone is complaining about the gp/hr real pkers make. Atleast thats the general note I get on reddit/twitch. However Jagex fuckin up is about as normal as Trump shouting some dumbshit.
---
&gt;DMM and leagues are just a measure of how long you can grind per week and not much more.
---
This is like half true. Yes, you need to put in a ton of hours to be a elite level competitor(say, top 1%), BUT you also have to be extremely efficient and have your route/gameplan completely planned out beforehand. If you took your average joe with 1100 total on 07 and threw him blind into dmm or leagues and think they'll have huge success just from putting in the hours, you're wrong imo.
---
It's fake someone already proved it isn't real because it just makes sense.
---
Yes but you hitting the average drop rate means you are doing 5-10-15-20k clues. Your drop rate on boots isnt correct either 1\283? Not sure where you even pulled that number as it's a shifting rate based on items pulled in a clue. Jars are what ~600ea imps are ~3.1k nothing in the jars or clues is worth anything other than rangers.
---
Also yes meds are a profit if you have infinite gp and time. But that's not true for most players
---
Maybe try reading mr. CrackPipe?
---
&gt;If the crates were coming into the game from legitimate Pks and not being farmed by botters, they would be balanced.
---
Literally from my first comment.  
---
&gt;You are obviously stating that the crates are at fault, not the people abusing the system.
---
So you just made that up that I am stating that...
---
Yes! It was Runescape, club penguin and neopets for me haha.
---
That’s the thing, I had a separate email for the accounts that I only used for Old school. My email was not hacked and I had authenticator also.
---
They somehow used the recovery system to get my account, it’s really odd.
---
gambling addiction to fuel drug addiction
---
You have a bad memory then, multi logging even occurred in classic and wasn't punishable. It had to do with WHAT you were trying to do. Were you trying to rig something like a Castle Wars game, as in your alt went to 1 team and you put your main on the other, that would be deemed as exploiting game mechanics. Simply logging on to 2 accounts at once wasn't against the rules.  For context I had a f2p hybrid pure (standard 40 atk 70ish str/range/mage) I regularly swapped monies back and forth from my main to my pure whenever it was necessary. Neither of them got banned because there was no malicious intent or exploitation occurring.
---
I am sure he will be baking a lot more cakes soon
---
“Cox is just fucking trash”
---
The absolute truth
---
It's random bullshittery from a nobody. Cocaine is not the sort of thing that goes in a nondisclosure agreement.
---
They got fixed that already i thought?
---
Originally yes...but that was nearly a month ago now.
---
Since Jagex has worked with Runelits to ensure ALL plugins are compliant and have specifically said this in multiple blogs/streams.
---
So yes....You can't read
---
What
---
My brother in law lives in Cambridge but commutes to London everyday for work
---
Man if I could borrow on margin...
---
By that definition is everything coming into the game not balanced, since everything is getting botted. Then Zulrah isnt balanced aswell because its getting botted.
---
what i can remember after that panic attack i saw jad. I shooted healer one by one to hit me, then i lined them so they all cant hit me. then back to jad. jad hasvisual glitch or something that it looks like he gets healed but it doesnt
---
Im also expecting maul handles to go down too.
---
You could get them with 19 points so its not as bad but still. Sanfews, im not sure how many points they cost.
---
Coke is a businessman’s drug after all, so I wouldn’t be surprised.
---
This picture has so much innocence in it, it nearly makes me want to cry because I can’t enjoy such a time anymore.
---
Upvotes obviously mean truth
---
They've still refused to specifically name plugins is what I'm trying to say. If left-click use bones is de facto fine, I assume left-click drop logs/fish and other skilling trash loot is fine as well, because it's the same plugin.
---
Claim before Dec 10th
---
nice
---
&gt; Tiers mean nothing in this game.
---
I'd say they do, but more in terms of psychology. If you release a weapon requiring level 80, people will call it "tier 80" and hearken it to Chaotics from RS3. This then gets calls of "POWER CREEP REEEEE" and it wouldn't pass a poll. Obviously this game already has t80s in essence but they all get level 75 reqs so people don't notice.
---
Bots and their personal risk tolerance
---
There is. It's called pvm gottem
---
Should be about 27.5 points per sanfew.
---
Just revert the whole thing. Much preferred the old 10 Tier system as opposed to this garbage you took 2 years to vomit out.
---
People weren't lil cry babies like you are right now, back then. People may have voiced opinions, but they didn't fucking moan like people do these days. If you can't see that, then "delusional" might be the right word for you.
---
Nice, I posted an 87-99 from herbiboar a few years ago and it's almost exactly the same as this. Sorry you didn't get the pet though, it's a pretty cool one
---
It is still that time
---
For being so accurate take this updoot
---
Then tell them to revert the change where 25% of the gold used to 'fix' untradeables disappears on death so PvP is a net loss in terms of gold in the game. If 25% is gone then people going 1 kd are losing 25% of their money on top of supplies - not very fun if you ask me, you can't even do fun fights with your friends that way.
---
Casual 2b but Fire cape instead of Infernal? Odd.
---
Really amazing they overlooked this issue.  I’ve only been back to OSRS for 4 months now and I’m really starting to understand all the jagex memes.
---
Even though I want to I can't forget l. The screams of my PC will haunt me forever
---
Yes, but your comment used the term "cheap ass". gp/xp is king if you're truly a cheap ass.
---
id argue sanfews being so rare is an oversight if anything, they need more sources. shouldve added animal raising to farming a long time ago and included nail beasts as one of the things you can raise.
---
Not much of a war when 5%-10% of the community is pvp / pkers  and the rest are skillers / pvmers
---
He doesn't need to prove anything
---
I knew bankers were evil!
---
When will Jagex learn that PvP needs to be separate from PVE... that includes rewards... PvP'rs like cosmetics... give them pvp cosmetics and a completely separate minigame to play in....
---
They are profiting off both
---
Pretty sure if you look at the price graph for Zulrah uniques they spiked by like 2x in price after the bots were banned recently.
---
Own flair because Jagex can't tell me how to live my life :^)
---
YESSS I LOVE THAT LOOK!
---
"tip of the iceberg"   
---
Just because you onlt see it once doesnt mean it isn't happening to shit tons of people that just happen to not be streamers..
---
Tbh going for high points is sorta not worth it. You can imbue all equipment with low level bosses and just maximize exp.
---
I would prefer more bank space, but since Jagex refuses to add that, a wardrobe option would be okay.
---
Also been playing on and off since like ‘05 and I’m currently working on my first 99. I’m doing fletching because I thought it seemed Ike the easiest, currently at 88 fletch :)
---
&gt; he's from the USA. Jagex is in Cambridge not London. Roughly an hour and a half drive.
---
Well considering anything in the US that's notable is a *minimum* of 4 hours apart means that Cambridge would basically still feel "outside of" London to us.
---
But ye he prob lie.
---
I’ve got some bad news. Emblems are gone already. They were taken out with the new bh release. Wiley slayer only drops larrens keys now sadly.
---
Defensive stats don’t matter lol. That would do literally nothing
---
You’re right. Mistyped.
---
I thought fletching
---
Prob guardian
---
maybe if you block your name you should block it where the drop is too, also its not very dark I can still read it lol
---
A man can't meme?
---
And honestly it was really easy, just took a while. As for slayer, I hate it because its slower xp than afk rc even if you go the expensive cannon route, and slower than molasses in January if you dont. And anything higher level that it lets you kill i can make more doing vork or something else
---
Honestly, this could be a great opportunity for Jagex to get more into open source development. There's no need for both sides to reinvent the wheel, especially since the game client itself isn't the product.
---
If Jagex forked RuneLite, and moved development over to that repo, this could be an opportunity to allow the community to get directly involved with the development of an official client. It's honestly a win-win.
---
the point of wildy slayer was to entice players to the wildy so pkers could kill them. by doing wildy slayer, you are directly participating in pvp.
---
I worked in a place where I would do frequent 12 hour shifts and maybe only have 20 (if that) customers a day. I stood right there and got most of my 99 range done on mobile.
---
PvP isnt the place for a lot of stuff they try to poll through it. Dagonhai robes and Guthix staff are a couple things that did pass that could've had something more related to their lore tied to the release.  People want imbues from something pve or skill related, whether its nmz or warding/rc
---
All the main content creators got a video of it? Time to patch!
---
That’s Lumbridge, OP.
---
If you have private scripts you can bot as long as you don't overdo it
---
Where can you cook without moving? It’s been a while and I haven’t even started cooking yet lol
---
I also do things like if an item sells for 30m I put in an offer for 3m or 30k to try to get lucky on low volume items
---
I skated when I was younger. I broke my collar bone from just hitting a patch of water and falling off. Not a cool story. I mean I'd rather explain I broke it doing a badass trick.
---
I'm not so sure about these "advanced gold farmer companies" but you do bring up an excellent point. Their detection software may be useless against bot farms continuously training and cycling in new accounts, but it **is** good enough to catch almost everyone who thinks they can get away with botting on their personal mains.
---
Most of those banned were gold farmers combined with the possibility of locking it behind extra reqs
---
So do you still play Runescape ?
---
They were on weekend break
---
&gt; gets polled
---
the update itself wasnt polled
---
Got my mimic for music cape on the 2nd one :p
---
Ring of wealth i on lava dragons
---
Omw, I totally forgot that was a thing, those last 4 levels would have been so much easier
---
Grats man! Really nice one to get lucky on :)
---
Except you could just import tile markers from someone who has already marked it manually
---
&gt; Jagex likes this because OSRS PVP videos have more cumulative viewership than all other content combined.
---
where did you get this information? went to youtube, searched osrs, sorted by view count and found around 5 videos related to pvp in top100. doesn't seem like pvp is very popular
---
Whut now?!
---
Jk I’m not from Virginia
---
Hold my cashstack, I'm going in
---
Zulrahs hardest req is 56 agility, hardly end game, and billions upon billions of GP is thrown into the game from bots there every single day.
---
That's because client-side menu manipulation doesn't send any sort of packet to the server. It's baffling to me that they could delude themselves into taking a "stand" against these clients before they even bother doing the engine work to add more server-side checks.
---
**Everyone** needs to be aware that almost every plugin is still 100% safe to use. If more people are aware of this, they might be inclined to do that required engine work sooner rather than in 2030.
---
Yeah, HUGE difference
---
Wait what? Can you explain?
---
1900+ currently
---
Ugh, slayer it is then i guess. WAHHHH
---
Yeah I’ve heard people suggesting paid instances for closed parties and stuff. I’d hate for Jagex to have to waste dev time or something like that though. In my opinion the only problem is that it’s gold farmed heavily by Venezuelans. Idk if it’s really possible to stop them though
---
I thought everybody knew this already?
---
Do you have a list of times for each rotation?  I have one memorized where I can do the max shots with bp then one with dark bow
---
The wiring back then was big oof 😂😂
---
It’s like 2-3m an hour with minimum stats
---
People pvp. Crazy ik.
---
You know you don’t have to wear graceful if you’re using stams

Rogue's Den in Burthorpe has a fire next to a bank person. The range in Hosidius burns less food though. (edit: the screenshot shows the range in Hosidius)
---
Just kill the healers?
---
Not OP but I just switched my bp style to long-range to tag the healers on my first run
---

---
Getting my guthix plate scammed for a graahk top just after hunter release because the guy said it was worth more lol
---
I was thinking the exact same thing.
---
It's not VASTLY superior. It is better in some places with a significant cost of use. Range actually has more than just a niche use.
---
It’s a boring reality for pkers but I think any loot that is randomly generated by pking will never work. If it can be abused, it will be abused as every pvp mode in the game has been abused. Lms: abused, Bh1 abused, bh2 abused. Heck even castle wars is “abused” by people using alts to get untradable rewards. Pking is only profitable for the best 10-20% of players with a consistent 3:1 KD ratio because if you go 1:1 you will loose money on supplies (assuming you fight people in similar risk). 
---
Those 3 players that die for 1 good pker to profit are quitting, because why slowly bankrupt yourself learning to pk for maybe 1-2m profit an hour when you’re good? Just learn zulrah for 3 mill an hour risk free.
---
Seems a bit inconsistent to ban that but still allow left click bones and left click swordfish
---
I do! I got to overall level 2526 on rs3 before I got fed up of mtx and feeling like it wasn’t the same game anymore, so I only play osrs now.
---
Solves his questing problem but the bigger problem thousands of bots are being produced and abusing free membership everyday is not solved.
---
Sick of you Jagex apologists
---
LOL
---
I don't blame you. The way NMZ was designed makes it feel like a place to mess around with past quest bosses for a little while, not forced to AFK farm it for hours on end.
---
I'm a good pker and understand they are a bad idea
---
Chaos runes were locked to onyx prices, onyx started becoming a drop from zalcano... onyx prices drop, chaos runes drop.
---
That's never how pvp has worked and never should a gmaul pure that takes less than a day to make shouldn't be able to get 200k a kill because lol crates.
---
I still sit like that day in and day out at work...
---
I'm thinking that is not correct, if the game was sending you chunks of graphics when you walked to a new place it wouldn't work very well on the old crappy internet of 2001-2007 times. I thought it loaded everything to your pc in the loading screen before logging in.
---
You might be right though.
---
People liking them and understanding they are a bad idea aren't one in the same. I like the crates it's made me a massive amount of gp in a laughable amount of time on top of the gear I pk. But I still understand it's a bad idea, it isnt disingenuous to say what I said.
---
Your opinion doesn't really matter here I'm not trying to change your mind.
---
In this world, is the destiny of man kind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true, that man has no control. Even over his own will. Man takes up the sword in order to shield the small wound in his heart sustained in a far-off time beyond remembrance. Man wields the sword so that he may die smiling in some far-off time beyond perception.

Used rotation spawn prediction so i wouldn’t have to tank the rangers as much, waited until i got a Jad SE spawn so I could lure him easier to trap the healers behind him.  Inspired by my friend getting his fcape at 99 combat and trying to flex on me.

It's like jagex said "how can we make the wilderness worse? Oh I know, let's have it so you can get baited into multi easier, and skull tricked because you cant be told who's attacking you.
---
Literally fuck this update.
---
Oh, I almost forget how they completely fucked up BH too.

Holy fuck level of entitlement of PKing youtubers thinking that 5 m/hr minimum on easy to make accounts compared to PVM bosses
---
Herbiboar you're still clicking to run everywhere and have to search the hidey-holes.

Children use Twitter. Adults use Reddit.

I see it as a necassary evil in order to bring new players to PvP, it might be frustrating to not get big smites for some veterans of PvP but it's equally as frustrating for new players to lose their banks left and right and drop PvP all together.

---
Yes!! Neopets for us too :D
---
care to elaborate?
---
Actually I think your right about it all loading on the loading screen. But that would means it's all in memory. As in actively in your ram. Where as now I believe it's stored on your harddrive. Maybe since it's already in memory and just being processed by the CPU that is less resource intensive than having to stream bits of it from a drive. Idk now I really want an answer.
---
"They are profiting off both"?
---
...ok?
---
People who ask questions like this deserved to be scammed.

Heres a life lesson: rarely are people who are in the business of taking your money through gambling, are honest and nice people looking to give you fair chances. In video games and real life :)
---
You are so close minded
---
Some things are surprisingly easier on mobile if you have a large enough screen. Anything that requires a lot of clicks (but no right clicks) it's usually easier to use two fingers than to move your mouse back and forth every action

Fucking losers
---
I still do it a lot too..my joints hate me lmao
---
Sorry the game is too hard for you.  You can always try Neopets.
---
Maybe I just fat finger everything but I did herbs for a week at work on my breaks and it was terrible I think my iPhone 8 just doesn’t have enough real estate for my thick boi thumbs
---
Except it's not... Ecto is cheaper. You'd lately have to get the non consume to proc once per bone (which it doesn't) for it to be even 40% cheaper. (It'd have to happen 4 times per bone for ecto to be twice the cost)
---
Wiki explains it all.
---
Going to seers village bank and starting scamming / doing heroes quest
---
Lol you think all gold websites obtain it illegitimately? I know people rwted for years and years over a thousand dollars with out a ban, so I don't think Jagex is banning very many people, assuming most people aren't spending hundreds of dollars on gold. 
---
When that 4b is entered into the game out of no where, irregardless to if it's a Venezuelan farming to sell for money or a player to sell on the GE it inflates the market more.
---
its a placeholder :)
---
theres a fuck ton of gold farmers at vorkath.. the most locked content in the game
---
No I don't.
---
Gp/exp is in pristine conditions. 
---
Risk at ecto = 0 therefore it's cheaper
---
He has a link in the description where the music comes from
---
Wise man
---
The drop rate is 1/1,000 or worse, I doubt Zalcano is to blame. But I would blame her for the ore and bar price drops, she does drop a shitload of those.
---
Jagex is a 300 million dollar company bro
---
I assume his point is that people use "inflation" to refer to more money comping into the game, which isn't accurate or correct. In some sectors you could say there is deflation, because of the massive resource supplies especially.
---
But overall, at least according to the price of bonds (meaning the value of coins to the dollar) we are experiencing inflation of quite high rates. If we didn't have this inflation, prices would be dropping very fast. I'd probably prefer that, as it would be more clear how much items are dropping in real value even in their coin value now stays about the same and it would be easier to consider if we support that or not.
---
Vengeance damage isn't counted as coming from any player in particular. It also doesn't work at Olm.
---
When something is loaded off the harddrive its still put into RAM no matter what. If you run out of ram, you're computer will start using the hard drive to do things and it will be horribly slow.
---
So this is why we have a global Carbon emissions crisis. Glad that was wrapped up.
---
Yikes
---
a core pvm potion is only available by doing niche very low level ironman content, or two oddball bosses ? does that sound right?
---
What does this mean
---
Bonds are a legitimate way to buy GP, even though they're a little pricey. Bonds generally get used up, so there isn't much raw GP generated into the game. There is a demand for cheaper GP, so bot farms are made to generate masses of gold to supply that GP, this is usually farmable stuff, so it's pure GP being made/sold.
---
You either pay Jagex to give you money, or you break the rules and pay someone to dilute the economy
---
The fact that there are people willing to spend actual currency on yellow pixels is sad man
---
Problem #1 then.
---
What do you need a guide for? Just use the most efficient xp gaining method for each skill.
---
You share the worst mentality here. At the end of the day, RuneScape is a game and people play games for fun. If you only measure your success in game by the size of your bank, then you honestly shouldn’t play this game. Or do and at least purchase the gold from Jagex so you don’t kill the game for everyone that genuinely enjoys it.
---
Yes
---
Not to mention the terrible sitting posture that would eventually lead to crippling back pain.
---
Because npcs always put up the best fight they can. Balancing pvp rewards around people putting up the best fight they can makes people taking a dive op. Balancing around people taking a dive means people using the system in earnest earn nothing.
---
Yeah of course, multiaccounting. But what if you and three-four friends do it?
---
Cuz npcs are usually gated behind skills(slayer) and/or quests and on top of that most profitable npcs aren't easy to farm with a day one bot account unlike the bounty hunter shit, it's just too easy to exploit
---
Is he like lead stage hand guy now for these events? Theatre tech is a respectable position, I'm just curious on what he does. I thought he was in charge of like brainstorming Pvp events and stuff, but obviously someone else had that job now.
---
afk barb fishing and drinking coffee
---
cool now just lower the price of the rune pouch in the shop please
---
Yes, we got to help the 300 million dollar company so they don't run out of money!! /s
---
I don't think all do, but all scams and hacks occur because people are willing to buy, not because of people who sell gold.
---
Its a slayer task.
---
jagex has never made a statement on it since the update i dont believe.
---
and given how they said they couldnt ban emblem farmers till they rwt'd with the previous version of bounty hunter id say its still okay.
---
it shouldnt be, but hey, they lazy
---
I and everyone I know that plays the game would quit if smite was removed. The entire point of pvp is to take the enemy's items. In fact, I have suggested multiple times that smite be made better because the entire reason that pvp is struggling is because there is no real risk. 
---
I haven't been smited on any of my accounts in about 3 or 4 years, even on my 31 prayer account and my 95 cb maxed 1 Def pure with 52 prayer. Literally all you have to do is combo food + ppots/sup restores + karambwan and you'll never get smited. I also rarely ever get smites, compared to pre eoc when combo food wasn't as well known or used because of the prices.
---
People need to realize the crates in general are bad for the game , were you sell Emblems for pure cash , the economy is literally getting pumped with cash that never existed in the game in the first place, in huge amounts. Jagex has no idea what there doing unfortunately the games being ran by people that are paid barely a living wage so you can't really blame them not for caring or overseeing shit.
---
DHL has been the meta for a while (shortly after its release). I don’t think that’s what’s contributing to DHCB and DHL price fluctuation.
---
But I don’t buy gold
---
1. They don't always generate raw money
---
2. They are endgame monster that are either locked behind quests or high combat skills that take more than 2 hours to make an account for unlike the bh bot farms
---
Jeez it seems to be an ongoing trend for osrs content update. To have some kind of nerf or buff or to completely disable and revert content. 
---
Makes you think what were the devs doing during and just after the beta before release
---

Jagex had stated that multi accounting is allowed, as many people in the high level communtiy use alts to pvm with to increase kills/hr

I gotta ask my grandmother to see if she has a picture of me and my brothers playing runescape. It was horrible, we all had bowl cuts and where blonde, and she bought us all the same laptop.
---
What a rabbit hole that was
---
explain?
---
Its like this because its not sustainable. If i kill 20 people but die 15 times, ive lost money because of supploes and repairing gear. The average kd is 1:1. Why do pvp if zulrah makes you 4.5m/h rn? U need to make it so even the newbs profit so they continue playing.
---
i honestly would not be surprised if this was real lol , jagex always seem like they have no idea what there doing at all
---
Yes finally someone agrees with me. This is a GAME not something to be proud. Also if jagex banned all the gold buyers it would be legit 15-25k players online that are elitest and ironmen and that would kill the game faster than any gold buyer could. That’s why they don’t ban buyers.
---
Thank you for responding to/mitigating this issue despite it being the weekend!
---
That wasn't part of the deal.

No it's not lol. It's a shitty, gimmicky, overpriced phone and I'm so glad I don't have to worry about selling them and getting returns at Verizon. You can easily permanently damage the screen with just your fingernail.

I'm currently playing BA and wanted to get really good at it. How does stall work? I can spam the mind shield when the collector puts the omega egg in but I feel like there's a better stall method using shrink potions. I also want to learn how to stall for unlimited red eggs.

Counting to 3 is hard. Any tips?
---
Its not even close to ovl...
---
EDIT: I just realized you might've been trying to get a figure of how many sanfews are coming into the game, in which your calculations are correct. I thought you were trying to see how much it should cost of placed alone in the store.
---
I'm not going to downvote you, but what you are calculating doesn't make sense to calculate. If you tried to estimate the value of the maul handle using that logic, it would cost 150 points.
---
What you calculate would be its value if crates dropped sanfews 1/11 of the time and nothing 10/11 of the time.
---
The way to calculate how many points a sanfew should cost to match the other items would be to look at the gp/point and then estimate how much a sanfew should cost based on that. We can probably assume that the gp/point will settle at around the high alch value of the items at some point. Dragon scimitars are at high alch value, and the gp/point for a dragon scimitar is around 20k, meaning that with sanfew serums also costing around 20k, the much more accurate point price for a sanfew serum would be 1 point.
---
Why not? From the wiki:
---
" In order to obtain/reobtain the garb, the player must dig at the same downward right diagonal two-rocky area place just north of the [Shayzien](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Shayzien) station of the [Lovakengj Minecart Network](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lovakengj_Minecart_Network), where [Mogrim](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mogrim) resides. "
---
In what ways Albert?
---
That's fucking hot
---
I see low vote participation as faith in the dev team, as long as they keep the polling system in place then people have a way to rise up against an update they don't want. 
---
I think a big problem with a lot of the PVP updates is that they offer power creep (vls, freezing changes, tb changes) as QoL changes. I don't PVP but I do think that the wilderness is dangerous enough as it is so I'm likely going to vote no on any changes that make it worse. 
---
Some of these changes could still be good if they were added a different way, like from new items.
---
e.g Ring of binding: makes normal spellbook binds last 30% longer
---
Ironman has better rng imo
---
But... how? surely if people were already trying to buy it for say 10% less than average, their offer would have beaten this??
---
Dude BH would have already died if it wasn't for those &lt;thousand players, this would be a total non issue because there would be nothing to save. If you want to "revive" PKing by making it super safe and cushiony, just make 1 PvP world for pussies instead of ruining BH.
---
What a fucking shit show, give your employees better benefits so they care and stick around. This gaming company feels like a fucking McDonald's.

I honestly don't think that's too abnormal for 2004
---
What post?
---
Because you cant brew, and ovl boosted your stats to 125 (if im not wrong) . Ovl was far better, also boosted mage and range.
---
I'm strictly talking about the amount of them entering the game, and all of these bots are purchasing BH crates since their value is around 180k each.
---
thicc
---
Lol I love this! :)
---
About as outlandish as Jmods hacking accounts and RWTing the items and Jmods running secret merching rings based on insider knowledge and merching those profits, right?
---
Oh thats not bad
---
I've been using PCs since i can remember. Definitely had dial up since i was born lol, im 27 now so. But we had broadband by the time rsc was even a thing so idk why people act like 2007 is such a "nostalgic" time..like, xbox 360s were a thing, HD, etc. Ive played online games since the likes of ultima online, and Diablo (d1 even at that, but d2 also cause great game). Shit now playing U.O. on dial up was rough. But i remember playing arena/daggerfall back in the early 90s pre Windows and ah good times. Jazz jackrabbit was a fun game too. Plus all the MDOS games were pretty fun.
---
Not sure why people always downvote me for saying this. 2007 was not the age of CRT monitors and dial up like the kids on this sub seem to think.
---
That system was awful for the health of the game btw. It inflated gp so much due to abuse of 76king and that system bringing in raw gp from statues. 
---
It had the upside of removing items from the game though. But overall the inflation was awful.
---
all of the people talking about the toolbars, there are two extra toolbars on there max. 
---
I topped out at 8.
---
Yeah sure, let’s blame the PLAYERS for the issues and not the company that’s doing very little to counter this problem.
---
Lol to this idea.
---
Yeah, I suppose one part of the reasoning I'm not considering is that technology adoption is much more ubiquitous now. I think a lot of families struggled to see the point in investing in technology. Back then, people were more reluctuant about buying the next big thing. 
---
Now, Apple has it baked into most everyone.
---
That's a very strong point that I hadn't considered, thanks.

Retort from every supposed pvper on this sub

"its not about the gp bro, its about the fights"
---
Why do i keep seeing people joke about having to get 99 fletch? Sorry, im new. Been seeing it ingame and here. Is it just tedious or super profitable / meta?
---
It's a combat potion, you cant expect it to boost mage and range. Overload also took more hp from you. But the effects still lasted 5 minutes without dropping like the divine.
---
If they feel a need to nerf, they'll do it
---
That's fair. The adoption of technology wasn't as ubiquitous around those times. I've been too indoctrinated by the craze behind ever iPhone release to see that at one point most people struggled to see the value in purchasing new technology

Cheaper Onyxes (because they’re so common now) means cheaper chaos runes.

Using AHK to teleport the mouse is technically against the rules but it's the same as just editing Mousekey settings which are permitted so Jagex doesn't care. Otherwise it's perfectly legal.

You do realize that jagex had to disable the pvp loot crates from the emblem shop right?  Like... you are sitting here trying to insult me while being ignorant to the facts.  PvP is being abused and had to have features disabled.  Factually the wildeness is the problem.

I saw that comment earlier, boy was I not surprised. Dirty little druggos

Yeah totally unnecessary and woox walking with the bow is way easier than bp I got it down pretty quickly but I’ll still die if I’m using a bp it’s just tough. Never used the lance so can’t really compare them tho
---
So? You're saying it's not at all gold buying. I'm saying it is, just with an extra step.
---
You seem to be trying to defend gold buying, but I never said I cared or that it was bad.
---
im pretty sure you just convert 120 def * .3 + 99 magic *.7 rounded down and just plug that into the npc magic level on a normal dps calc. or whatever magic+def level values u want
---
Lol 1k kc no wonder you’re such a mouth breather. That’s not a respectable number first of all 2nd you’re clearly not intelligent or competent so why would your anecdotes  matter?
---
Wat kinda fancy ass flat screen did u have back then?
---
&gt; I'm saying that you buy a liquid asset, that can be sold for GP. Not straight up GP. And there's a vital difference to it. 
---
And I'm saying that it literally doesn't matter in the end. You pay Jagex $$$, you receive an item that takes 1 extra step to sell for gold in-game. The only vital difference here is you're paying Jagex for it, instead of an RWT site, and coincidentally RWT sites also have varying prices, and a limited supply of gold

Yes, I do find it very interesting. I always used to watch "Top 10 best RuneScape Moments" The falador massacre was my favorite one.

I would support the idea of degradable everything so long as Jagex gave the players the option to repair the item at a fraction of the supply cost used to construct it with the appropriate skill (smithing, crafting, etc.) If items were to break permanently, that would be bad for player moral.

Ayy I had a King Edwards Imperial cigar box that I kept random shit in too

Well said, especially the part regarding pkers bringing back osrs. Because its true, we did. Every pker moved on to private servers whilst the PvMers were adapting to eoc. Then 2006scape got 600k sign-ups, advertised solely by pkers until it snowballed into that registration number. Then it was shut down prematurely and Jagex polled OSRS, which once again was advertised the most by pkers. Funny enough you can go backwards in the rs3 subreddit and find pvmers shit talking the idea of OSRS, pvmers which now cry on the internet because a pker ruined their wildy boss slayer assignment and made them actually lose something for once, because god forbid these PvMing babies lose their items!

Yeah, well there's probably a reason why you're not in charge.
---
And if you don't think that's crossed their mind, or is what they're already doing to analyze the behaviour patterns of the bots, then I don't think you're anything but proof of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Why post this here?

Big week for your iron! Nice gains.

Mouse keys don't even move 50 units lol

I want to try and confirm this but I can't because my password is all numbers it's my social security number and my birthdate

Without the dashes and spaces of course

Weekend warriors buy gold because they don't have time to farm it normally and they make up a pretty large portion of the player base. Its part of the game tbh

Squeal of fortune v2

Shhhh, the mods are sleeping.

People said the mod Jed and reach stuff was fake.

Any confirmed bans from people using third party clients yet?

Not really sure what your argument is here you pretty much proved my point. 4.8m/hr solo 1 acc at zulrah challenges - but is not equal to - raids 1 solo not to mention you dont even need a maxed acc for zulrah to be that profitable but you need way more reqs for raids. And you simply proved my point about GWD - it is possible to solo and people do it (ironmen mostly), the meta for arma is to chin and you don't even need 2 accs for that. Also if you include in alt in any of this that alt could be doing something better than helping a main do something. Why make 6.5m-9m/hr at raids 1 with an alt when you can put both accs at zulrah for 5m/hr? Lower effort same reword. Also you only used bandos for your GWD point because it is the only one that really needs more than 1 acc to be efficient, sara is 100% solo unless you are using an alt to tank, zammy is solo unless you want a tank, and arma is solo chin.
---
haha thanks :D

Duo Sara is so easy. Bring blow pipe for minions. You shouldn’t need stamina pots in a duo, maybe 1 for emergency if you are new. Have one person get agro and run around and have the other person attack it. There is a ping pong method where you don’t attack Sara when she is chasing you, when she turns to your partner then you start attacking and ur partner runs. Switch every 3 hits and she walks back and forth between you both (go on the corners diagonal from each other). Just try a trip and you’ll get the hang of it, pray mage.

I don't really believe their post, based on their past history. =/
---
The person who did that isn’t even close to upper mgmt

I'm a big sdmm player and miss it sorely. Not disagreeing with you, but could you elaborate more on what you think about its ingame economy with some examples? I'm interested to hear what other players think because the fresh economy in sdmm was something I really liked about the game mode.
---
I have a max main elite void / dhcb / anguish and zammy boots. A tent whip. Can i do cox?

My granddad thought the preinstalled Solitaire game gave his computer a virus.
---
Implying that piece of shit 'Ace of Spades' Jagex pushed was actually AoS.
---
Too bad OpenSpades and BuildandShoot are dead, guess AoS is officially gone.
---
What if Hans told you how many times you’ve jacked off

Giant mole

I'm pretty sure google search results are tailored based on your individual search history.
---
Even then, vork and zulrah are both slightly better gp per hour than cerb. I don't think there's a single slayer task that is better money per hour than vork or zulrah
---
&gt; out if every 2 one is doubled.
---
And out of every 2 doubled, 1 is doubled again, and so on.
---
Really, no bone is "doubled", they're just *not consumed* 50% of the time, which over a large enough sample is equivalent to doubling each bone.
---
What's a comp cape?
---
I think your not understanding what causes people to both pvp and not pvp.
---
People pvp because of the risk and reward of the fight, removing smite removes both. 
---
People don’t pvp because it requires a specialised account to not get destroyed. 
---
If people wanted a risk free but still having the “fun of pvp content “!clan wars would be busy, but it isn’t.
---
Yes I know I did the quest but on osrs it’s eyes of glouphrie where you discover they’re evil creatures. I understand the joke.
---
There isn't necessarily one singular reason why 'all' PvM gear is shifting in price, there can be one reason the Lance/dhcb are fluctuating, and a separate reason why Ancestral is rising.
---
Would just lower the price
---
&gt;Yeah, I think most people on this sub are even younger than millenials 
---
A lot of millennials are in their 30's now.
---
I love these posts - they're so nostalgic.
