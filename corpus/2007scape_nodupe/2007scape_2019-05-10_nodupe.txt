Nice dude! I still have troubles with Jad and some of the waves before him, and I‚Äôve been playing since 04-05ish? I‚Äôve pretty much already thrown the idea of an Infernal Cape out the window lol. Enjoy the dope cape!
---
---
---
can i have the big bones
---
????
---
Yessir, the example you gave doesn't violate any of the game rules and would be completely fine!
---
Why?
---
Hi
---
Which you just did, but you didnt write it out, you just did some Harry Potter shit. "The word that shall not be named, but can freely be communicated, as long as its not said properly".
---
Y so angry
---
hey it‚Äôs me ur brother
---
It works for anything that requires a saw. Which is a lot of stuff in the construction skill but not quite all
---
Nipples are spot on
---
Yeah, they either don't know about them, or they can't do them, but the 'i don't like to play the game like that xd' excuse is often used as a cop out for inability.
---
That dude fucks
---
You just calculate the accuracy without adding the wildy bonus. Use the dps calc by Bitterkoekje is you don't know the formula yourself (make sure wilderness is disabled in the spreadsheet obviously)
---
YES BRO YES üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Butt plugs AND head!? jfc

Maybe people will find another unproductive outlet. However, it is also possible that the boredom can cause someone to do something more productive and life-building. I am all for Runescape but I understand now that unless you are a streamer, it does not offer much benefit to one's life. An hour a day is fine, but too much is unhealthy. 
---

---
I should know, I used to play this game 10 hours per day. Although it can be fun, it can also be an inhibiting factor to the pursuit of happiness.
---
Based on purple rares, so if you're only looking for like 5-10m then you'd be better off probably doing zulrah or vorkath... But if you're trying to make 100's of millions or more then you'd be better off raiding.
---
For CoX, ~ half of your estimated gp/h comes from tbow. Meaning if you were doing highly efficient raids, you could expect to make ~ 4.5m/h not counting tbow drops. Tbow is estimated at around 30,000,000 points per bow, which translates to ~ 1/1000 30k point solos, ~1/500 60k point trios, or ~ 1/333 90k 4+1's.
---
For ToB, again around half of your estimated income comes from scythe. Scythe is roughly 1/190 (using Oblivion's estimates for 0 death raids), and drop rate is the same no matter team size. So running casual 4 mans you'd expect to make ~ 4m/h without getting scythe drops, or highly efficient duo's / 2+X's ~ 9m/h without scythes. However, by best estimates scythe is far more common than tbow is. 
---
To put these into time measurements... If you can do consistent 20 minute 4+1's (counting time to regear, and assuming prescouted raids) you could expect to see a tbow in ~ 111 hours of raiding. If you can do consistent 20 minute 4 man ToB, you could expect to see a scythe in ~ 63 hours of raiding.

What is recommended for fighting chaos druids ?
---
Here's exactly how the cannon rolls its accuracy.
---
When using melee, the cannon's accuracy depends on your current attack bonus OF THE ATTACK STYLE YOU ARE USING. So if i was using a cannon at some dragons and had a hasta, if my hasta was set to stab, the cannon would be more accurate than if i had my hasta set to slash. (Cuz the hasta provides more stab attack bonus than slash) It also takes into account your attack level like any regular attack roll.
---
Ranged is simpler. Like the craw's bow. Style doesnt matter cuz there is only one ranged attack bonus. It just looks at the bonus and your ranged level. 
---
Magic weapons are calculated the same way as melee, except for tridents. (Since you can't melee with a trident) For tridents, the cannon will choose the highest attack bonus out of ranged, stab, slash and crush and your level in attack or ranged. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
tl;dr, For melee: cannon rolls off of the attack bonus of the current attack style you are using. For ranged: just rolls off of ranged attack. For magic weapons: will roll off the highest of any of your bonuses. (Unless its a staff that can melee, then it rolls off of melee)
---
Where is that place
---
You can straight up buy them for real cheap at the warriors guild. There's not enough stat boosting demand to affect the price as much as you may think.
---
Somewhat agree, but replace fire cape with Barrows Gloves. Fight caves is MUCH harder objectively than the rest, which are literally unable to be failed, merely  time sinks. Quests on the other hand, are also unable to be failed, (Except maybe DS2? But even then, after enough tries, Ruby bolts will rng you to a win). That said, I also don't think epeen flexing is cool, so on that token I guess I disagree with your point on principle.
---
An item intended for use at rev caves isn‚Äôt really viable at rev caves, I don‚Äôt do a lot of rev killing but it makes sense to buff it or tweak i to give it a use.
---
Prayer actually does affect cannon accuracy. Special bonuses don't affect cannon though e.g. wildy bonus, tbow effect, slayer helm, void etc.
---
Really wish people would leave him alone and let him work. Do people have nothing better to do than annoy youtubers? It‚Äôll be out when it‚Äôs out, find something else to do.
---
BIS stands for Best in Slot, it's just the current trend of memes on this subreddit.
---
[removed]
---
yeah and thats fine. Normalization of regular use of the n word however has negative implications/consequences for black people. Plus it sets a bad precedent for black people that play osrs come on the sub, see this shit, and get turned off. This and other things alike towards different kinds of minorities only increases barrier of entry for them into video gaming culture. And what for? So some white kids can continue to enjoy being able to say the big bad words?  
---
Words should be used responsibly. Just because people live a life of privilege and the connotations behind words don't really have any effect on them doesn't mean it doesn't have an indirect effect on others.
---
Wildy slayer, maybe you'll even get a task of green  dragons to increase your profit
---
He does, it's just that you don't know what opportunity cost is.
---
This is a fucking hilarious thread, I love every comment that's spawned off the OP
---
Dude I really like the rapier and dramen staff combo looks so unusual but fits the game so well ahaha
---
Besides slayer aha

This is stupid, even for you.

Doesn't need all that, Bruce Jenner is a hero.
---
Broooo this looks so dope, I really like the firecape in the end, I hope to see more of ur drawing
---
The only possible use I could MAYBE see for it is a low level ironman kicking imps for it so they could have an ammy with glory stats without having to grind out crafting. And I really don't see anyone doing that.

I just over appreciated the heck out of that reference. Still the best concert ive ever been to

It's not nearly as bad as people make it seem. I did b2p, infinity boots and master wand in like 3 days.
---
If you're willing to put in the grind and want it, go for it. If not, no shame in holding off until you're more comfortable. Or if you want a grind in-between in cost and time, bring 28 dragon bones to the wildy chaos altar.
---
Oh shit your balls are on top too?

what's wrong with slayer?

agility's next :)

2 outta 3 ain't bad

Do the elite diary tasks for killing multiple bosses (GWD, DKs, wilderness, etc) still require you do to it in one sitting without logging out?
---
I vaguely remember that being a thing long before I was anywhere near elite diaries, and I'm not sure if it ever changed.

You violated the Kelly criterion. Just split the items you're flipping among 5 or so different items (3 if you're free to play, unfortunately). That should reduce your risk of ruin (losing everything), and will help you make more money over the long term.
---
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion (I know, it looks complicated -- you don't have to calculate the actual value. Just remember to not risk everything on one item.)
---
Smooth - For good
---
I reckon this would be fucking hilarious in wsb. Everyone in there learn finance from RS anyway.
---
Right? Like 6 hours of reasonable play.
---
bro WHAT. turoth is my favorite task. Such good money and so
---
so thats how it works
---
Honestly I enjoy playing both games but it‚Äôs a big opinion thing if you ask me. A lot of my friends that I try to get into RS prefer to play RS3 because it looks better and just seems ‚Äúnewer‚Äù but if they played RS before then the nostalgia comes in and they enjoy playing mostly OS. IMO try them both out.
---
waiting on a runelite plug-in to do this. 
---
For now bank tags work
---
Yes, i told my friend that i was getting them. I hope my roommate didnt hear me cheer :P

Nice free speach, telling opinion and ppl ask me to leave, how rude

Yeah I left for an hour and it only jumped 4 upvotes. Smdh.
---
Nightwing should be fire cape and Robin should be obby
---
I remember when Bonesaw finished the fight caves for the first fire cape in OSRS and the community went.. well, relatively nuts
---
Ok now who's gonna foot the $5000 to buy that many upvotes?

Castle wars is F2P btw, you can get there via clan wars portal.  You can't get the items outside of the game, though.

It‚Äôs getting hot in here

Thanks for the tips I‚Äôve seen a lot of the disguising videos on YouTube so It‚Äôs on right click always.

Plus I don‚Äôt have much expensive gear to begin with I‚Äôm rocking the adamant Armour right now so I‚Äôm not worried about losing it

trust me dude it's worth doing now, I had an extremely messy bank and then after spending around 20~ minutes organising it, it's so much better
---
Ah i see. Would 85+ in all combat stats be good enough for the clans?
---
How is Telos not a challenge?
---
Are you really a permanent record holder?
---
What‚Äôs the upside to starting slayer ? And I‚Äôm only 40 combat is that high enough to start slayer
---
Indeed! The house wouldn't be as fun if it didn't trigger anyone.
---
They use super restores alongside saradomin brews to restore the lowered stats back to normal. The ratio is 3 sara sips : 1 super restore sip.
---
1 nat + 1 fire
---
But why 79 RC?
---
Do it please. Also what music festival?
---
Nice but this kinda loot post i downvote because fuck ypu now watch youll also get a hellpup
---
Yeah it could honestly be taken either way. Either he got his kill with his own gear after giving the BP and anguish back OR that he finally got the kill with the loaned gear and is now accepting his rightful place back with his newb gear
---
gottem

EDC :)
---
Range lvl?

I‚Äôm 99 range

Nats is actually a lot more relaxed than lavas on mobile
---
Please throw your furry buttplug into recycle bin to your left.
---
At first glance I thought it was kq pet
---
A 4-dose Saradomin brew can heal you for a lot more than something like a tuna potato or an anglerfish. Super restores are used to restore the stats.
---
I think the point of the post was that he had 4 prims in 29 kills. I‚Äôm sure he has had other drops before with that kc. Not sure why he would have to mention that when it‚Äôs perfectly clear.
---
Yeah, getting all three of the DKs in one trip isn't too tough. Skotizo is the only other combat based elite task I have done, and I got the DK kills on my first try and as soon as I tele'd out I realized I probably could've done another round through all of them while I was there.
---
Are you me?

Is it a good idea to afk train magic from 90 to 99 at nmz? I was thinking of using the chaos gauntlets method but I wasn't sure of the cost of gp per xp and if I was better off using other methods.
---
I've always kind of wanted to go to some kind of music festival. Not Coachella but more along the lines of EDC or Defqon 1
---
Yikes, did you buy that? Melee stats don't affect range in any way, so it doesn't matter if you have 50 attack or 99 attack or 1 attack
---
Thank you. I'm glad you got some ideas from this.
---
X Doubt
---
Save yourself and at 70 magic sell the nats and burst /barrage to 99 and still make money

The advantage of the amulet is if you get an ancient item. It will note it and if it's in your inventory, can be protected instead of lost on death.

---
As far as herbs go, supercompost gives your plot 5 lives, ultracompost gives 6 lives.
---
  
---
Your chance to remove a life off of your plot each harvest depends on your farming level. Magic secatures give something like an extra 10% chance to not have a life be drained on a given harvest.
---
The exact way the formula works isn't really known AFAIK and most of what we know is just from estimates.

Do you have to kill the minions too?

---
Use a blowpipe or arclight. Kill it when you have a greater demon task or black demon task so that the slayer helm bonus makes it easier.
---
how does everyone on here have 3d printers
---

---
I‚Äôd say Gems. You could get the Karajama gloves from the Karajama easy diaries and the gem shop cost of gems is reduced. People who catch infernal eels commonly use this method.
---
I'm talking about flipping, you're talking about merching. more people are going to be buying AND selling these stews, which will decrease the margins because more people are fighting over them. the people "playing the long game" will get shafted too because the item isn't volatile anymore and wont spike in price as high. also, when have you ever heard of someone posting their flips being a successful tactic for them?
---
I think this is the only thing everyone would agree on.
---
Eh nothing wrong with persistence. If you beat it you deserve to flex a bit no matter how long it took. That being said being an elitist dick is no good.
---
Look at the os wiki page for the shops. They give you the tokkul to gp rates for all the items they sell.
---
So my friend told me **Forgettable Tale...** received a large, route-altering/time-saving update. I searched for a few minutes and found nothing (not surprised). Could someone tell me this is bullshit so I can stop thinking about it, Thanks.

Lasts an hour or two, which is plenty of time for me. But I‚Äôm sure whatever mix of heavy metals your family uses is non-toxic, dishwasher safe and anti-allergenic.

---
75 attack, 99 str, 1 def, 99 range, 31 prayer. Amazing elder maul or ags pure. The damage and ko potential is really high but it‚Äôs also sorta easy to get smited so you‚Äôll need to be careful
---
not gonna lie... I'm pretty impressed.
---
Fucking gotem.

---
I‚Äôd do most of the early quests for combat experience (Grand Tree, Tree Gnome Village, Fight Arena, Waterfall Quest, Etc.) to avoid the early combat levels, then I‚Äôd probably start slayer training.
---
Don‚Äôt do skotizo without an arclight. If you don‚Äôt have one save your totems until you do. With that, wear a dragon defender, neitiznot helm, black or blessed dhide top and chaps, b gloves, dboots. Pray melee and just attack it
---
Fucking legend

I haven't heard of anything like that.

I try to do 1 thing to be apart of everyone and you just gotta shit in my cereal!!! Lol well played... Guess I should delete this...

---
So a few months back I lost an account I had for about 15 years, realizing I'd never get it back I decided to rage quit for a while only to come back and be stabbed in the back by you guys again. I decided to make a new account (Lady Critz) on the OSRS side of things and been playing it for a while now, a couple of days ago I decided to play RS3. Last night when I logged off I was happy with the way things were going with the new game, it was as fun as I remembered. So this morning I wake up and my account is banned for Macroing, first of all, what is macroing ...and why can't I dispute it? When I attempted to use the websites appeal function it said that I was unable to dispute the ban.
---
Does anyone have any further information on how to handle this?
---
In the Pit of Pestilence, there are giant spiders.
---
It can actually (not because it missed but because it rolled a 0 on the damage roll)
---
tbh with god dhide and a few restores you can literally leave rigour/prot mage on for the whole second half of the cave and still come out with pots to spare
---
Pretty much every guide is going to have overpowered gear for the situation, especially if it‚Äôs geared towards low levels (ie. EVscape‚Äôs zulrah guide). Just learn the mechanics and you can get fire cape without op gear :)
---
I'm dying
---
imagine not being able to kill jad in 2019
---
I got 2.5m rn,76 mage and mid level other stats, how are people supposed to do mage arena 2, I tried like 7 times on the saradomin one, each time dying, I got about half way there till I died. Any tips would help a ton lol!

Are there any good and active sub reddits for OSRS other than 2007scape? I feel like this sub has just become overrun with humour/memes and there isnt much discussion about items, opinions, and the game itself. I get that its probably because content is so old now that all the discussions have been had but I enjoy reading more of the Q&amp;A type stuff and seeing how other people are playing the game etc.
---
Ive looked but it seems there aren't any good subs other than this one which sadly doesn't really appeal to me anymore - getting tired of the memes and humour shit posts (no offence)

Started hollering and bitching and moaning on how hes been hosting for like 10hrs so far that day (maybe try going outside idk) and had made a "mesely 2 mil out of it" and "but this was far the worst donation ive had". Still yelling at the guy that gave him the 50k.
---
Now...I normally tip pretty well for these sorta things, in games and irl. But after seeing this display. Yeah...nah. Not a single gp. 
---
And after learning about all the underhanded and scummy shit these hosts do, especially towards each other. Nah. I don't tip any of them anymore. I pick the host that has the shortest/easiest name to type out, do my shit, then leave. 
---
I've seen the notice board suggestion on reddit for like 2yrs, its always super popular and would probably solve a lot of this shit. Yet jagex hasn't done it and I don't think they've ever addressed it. Shame really.

I'm 77 and I just use wines, its not expensive just kind of annoying.

Defense bonus are better don't have to sacrifice the defense for things such as nose plugs.. etc. Has the gem built in to check slayer task things like that if you have a black mask (i) it will become a slayer helm (i) so won't lose that benifit either

I use range and mage for a quick switch for doing zulrah. Slayer mask for melee

I see the point you‚Äôre trying to make, but the reality is, there‚Äôs a sizeable population of people who *actually make a living*, sitting in front of a computer for 40-60 hours a week. 
---
It‚Äôs not just a handful of people either ‚Äî I‚Äôm talking entire business sectors, built on the groundwork of the secretaries, data monkeys, IT pros/amateurs, the grunts of the office, salesmen, phone center employees, etc. ‚Äî all of which, can be classified in the category I described above. 
---
Maybe we‚Äôre talking about Settled and others reaching 80-100+ hours in front of the screen, and maybe I can concede the point further, but I‚Äôd also be very quick to point out that these normal people who spend long periods of time at computers ‚Äî they also consume television as a form of entertainment after they get home from work, they play on their own computers at home. They‚Äôre on their phones damn near 24/7.
---
Again, maybe I concede the point that extended time frames at a computer alters your brain chemistry somehow, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs less, ‚Äúmental illness-inducing‚Äù and more, ‚Äútraining to be socially awkward‚Äù or something along the lines of leading him to believe that little human interaction outside of his home and his computer, is all he needs and *really wants in life.* 
---
The boy might be perfectly content getting a job and earning a living, and playing RuneScape for the rest of his life. To each their own. Let him live without writing him off as impaired or something worse just because he likes to spend his free time playing the same game we all have the same interest in, where the only difference between us really, is how much time he gets to spend playing it.

How rare is the bloodhound exactly though? Serious question.

thought so, thanks for the answer!

I would assume so, but I wonder if it picks the same targets every cast or if only the main target remains in every cast

sell the gear you don't need like the ahrim and dh, slay and barrows a bit. i would also go DK's, mage rex to break things up. i'd start alching up mage too or something, 90 should cost 10m and you can get that from a couple of b ring drops. could even chin range up a bit to 85 and hit up zulrah, vork etc
---
then keep slaying for base 90's and go other bosses

Rather than just screaming into the void what you want people to do. How about writing a well thought out reason or set of reason as to why you want what you want.

What hunter/fishing level are you? Unfortunately anything lower than 91 fish + 87 hunter (greater siren) rewards terrible xp. If you can catch greater siren, the xp rate is "decent" but you'd probably be better off doing Barb Fishing and Herbiboar. I guess this is mostly there for the unique fishing rods.

Super restores gives you 8 + 25% of your prayer point. At 60 pray, you regain +23 pray points. If you can get say 72 prayer, you'll gain +26 (13% increase) per sip which helps. Otherwise 68 is a nice +25 points.   
---
If I understand correctly, you aren't using any ring. Lumby easy gives explorer ring 1 which is a nice +1 prayer. Every bit helps.

So I guess my first question was more of a joke so thank you for answering, but really though I thought as an ultimate Ironman you weren‚Äôt allowed to die.

I feel sorry for your loss of a friend. Its really shitty how people can throw a friendship, even an internet based one, away for a few pixels. Shit, Im 30 and a clanmate lent me ahrims and serp so I could do my Zulrah kill for the diary and I gave him my phone number (same country) to make him feel safe. He had to log just as I got the items so I had them overnight and it was actually a bit stressful since both having small children we didnt have time wvery day - felt awful if our log-in patterns didnt meet for a week and he'd think I scammed him.
---
Fuck scamming tbh.

Friendly reminder that Vanila OSRS was struggling to pull 20k a day and it didn't become popular until MASSIVE changes were made.
---
Vanilla OSRS had:
---
No boss above KQ
---
No GWD or godswords
---
No GE
---
No Ironman
---
Literally none of the current BIS gear for melee, mage, or range (excluding dragon arrows)
---
No autochat
---
No quickprays
---
No third party clients
---
1 minute grace period on death
---
Far fewer teleports
---
Awful interfaces
---
No resizeable mode

I could go on but OSRS is a polished gem and actual 07 was ass in comparison
---
Only Hardcore Ironmen have one life, after that they get revoked to a normal ironman. Ultimate Ironmen can die but they lose all items and can't use Protect Item.
---
PvE in Classic WoW is threat management over the current iterations rotation management. There's a world of difference between a good frost mage and a bad one, gear only plays a minor part.
---
A bad frost mage will die 8 casts into any fight because he turned his brain off and pulled aggro rather than waiting once he hit high 90s%, or they'll wand when they get high lowering their DPS, they'll pot rotate badly, won't AoE packs to trigger clear casting, etc.
---
Some classes the gap is even bigger, with hunters and arcane weaving / auto resetting. The difference between one that knows how to play his class and one that doesn't is easily 50%-100% DPS.
---
It's still easy once you know but the whole "you just press 1 button the entire fight with your brain turned off" thing is something i swear people who never played classic just say.
---
Did it last night when i finished work specifically because of the new meme
---
I'm not comparing anything, just was stating where I was at in the game as ds2 and mm2 have fairly high requirements and things aren't too difficult for me right now. Tides of blood does look fairly challenging too, although having come from rs3's endgame it looks like it would be easy to pickup as rs3 has similar mechanics, but alot more stuff to deal with at the same time. I'm estimating it would take me 5-10 hours of learning tob to master it, as the main difficulty is just focusing for long periods of time without messing up and dying. I've learned how to 1 tick flick prayer, and I'm grinding so I can do raids, tob, and hopefully the inferno as soon as I can.
---
In all honesty, Its his voice that hooked me. Theres loads of youtubers with great content but if their voice is awful then I stop watching.

People werent whining for 07scape or 06scape.  That wasn't even the point (or how it came across) of his comment.
---
\&gt; You miss being a child playing a game, now your older and don't enjoy it.
---
For the most part, most people who play osrs played pre-eoc up to certain major changes.  So we missed the the game without the thing that tipped us over into quitting (whether it's eoc, mtx, or free trade/wild).  We now have a version without those things and we enjoy the game.  Nothing about it is missing being a child lol.  His post is inflamatory and worthy of discussion for the second part, which is why he now focuses on the 2006 era part of his comment, because he can pretend people didn't come back to that.
---
And there are confounding factors that made the player count drop.  Notably every world getting hit offline everyday for months.  Look at the player counts before and after safe deaths were introduced.

I once witnessed a friend of mine scam some cute noob for his Saradomin Sword by trying the old "doubling money" trick, we were in a group of 6 on discord when it happened and 4 of us were laughing their ass off at how gullible this cute noob was.... 
---
Cute noob had the last laugh tho, because both I and the other guy that remained silent bought him a new Saradomin Sword in silence so he accidentally actually had his money doubled lmao
---
Dont think he'll fall for it again tho, he followed us around for a good hour of constant begging before he got his stuff back

This guy had like 600 total level
---
Not actually sure you know... might give it a go as I've got a few totems hanging about. What gear setup would you be using?
---
I understand. He was just a dick about it. Sometimes people need a little clarification from others. I mean, with his mentality, we should all be teaching ourselves professions instead of going to college.
---
This guy had like 620 total level
---
Skilling would still be really profitable if there were no bots. It's not really the PvM that ruined it.
---
This makes absolutely no sense
---
And it's such a warped view created by frequenting this subreddit.
---
You don't see the non-efficient people who just play the game casually, take the time to explore things, run non-optimal gear. They're not posting screenshots and videos of their setups, stats etc. They're just playing the game.
---
I mean, back when I made the comment I was a maxed player, having played for over 9 years with over a year actual game time. But yeah, completely oblivious about Runescape.
---

Happy cake day!
---
that's half way to 99
---
That's a little extreme.
---
Yeah I get what you mean, but what I‚Äôm tryna say is that many are quick to assume, either ways, he most likely IS enjoying the game, whether or not he actually purchase gp.
---
Damn and I just finished my last Strange Fruit.
---
I didn't say you were oblivious about runescape, but rather why people wanted the oldschool version. Stay mad.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be doing it right away as I‚Äôm at 72 range but likely blowpipe with black dhide, blessed boots, spined helm, glory, barrows gloves, accumalator/assembler depending how quickly after ds2 I do it. Will have about 80 range by that point which may not be enough
---
Moiaow
---
Once he plays more, he‚Äôll realise that RWT was a bad idea. I was given 10m when I started playing by my mate. It was so boring, I had all I needed.
---
Maybe with a slayer helm on task with at least eagle eye. His defense gets pretty tanky with even 2 altars lit. Always a possibility tho so dont write yourself off!
---
Its not unobtainable in fact earning gp is easier than ever with things like hydra, zulrah, vorkath, cox and tob.
---
Do some flipping aswell or staking if you are into it. You'll reach your first bill in no time.
---
Yes! This exactly, or he may even be some chad that got lucky at the arena with a rental.
---
Just got scammed tonight for 300m when someone who I considered a friend asked to borrow my scythe and agreed to give his t bow as collateral. Should‚Äôve known something was off with how much he was insisting to be honest. 
---
Conversely, I knew someone for a week 3 months ago and helped him get his infernal cape by giving him my bow without asking for anything. He got his cape 5 days later and gave me my stuff back. It‚Äôs just RNG with the people you‚Äôre surrounded with - better to be safe than sorry if you can‚Äôt afford the risk though, I always have trouble saying no to people without feeling like an ass. At the end of the day you‚Äôre better off losing that wealth than continue being friends with someone who would value 4m or 300m over a friendship
---
If mammal ever maxes on his ironman he might be the first one ü§î
---
Dumbass
---
Or you‚Äôre a special snowflake who couldn‚Äôt grasp a basic concept
---
Your friends are lying to you and you‚Äôre stupid enough to believe them. They are not making 20m+ per raid.
---
I highly doubt that he knows enough about the game to stake. He didn‚Äôt know what a slayer helmet was.
---
If anyone let's me use their pure, I'm going to fucking ruin it. Don't share your accounts

---
You've also had some good answer but I'll give my own anyway:
---
It basically comes down to the damage output of each weapon, for each attack style. Higher DPS (damage per second) means you get more experience per hour and faster training.
---
Dragon scimitar is a tier 60 weapon (requiring 60 attack) while the abyssal dagger is a tier 70 weapon. The dagger having more strength bonus (strength bonus is usually more important than attack bonus since you can train on low-defence mobs where attack bonus doesn't matter much) means you will have higher DPS using it.
---
For each time you attack you can roll a damage-roll betwen zero and your max hit (max hit depending on strength bonus).
---
So if your damage range with dragon scimitar is 0-16, your damage range with abyssal dagger might be 0-18, giving you a higher average damage roll and therefor more experience.
---
There are some better alternatives for training other attack styles (the popular abyssal whip only trains attack, defence or split amongst all three (controlled)) but for strength the dagger is pretty popular.
---
I don't understand this... What do they mean by 3rd party software? The only thing I'm using is their NXT launcher and I use Runelite for OSRS. Is Runelite not allowed? ...because if that's it well then I guess I was breaking the rules, for some reason I was under the impression that it was okay to use it.

I hope you took screenshots of the trades/chat and can report him to rsj/rw. That way later on people will check him when he applies to clans or joins raids. Although not everyone checks that, it's 100% not worth scamming a blowpipe if he plans to do endgame team content.

You're still not providing me with any actual evidence of anything. You studying scripts at college doesn't mean shit in the long run and isn't relevant to anything.

I guess the thought at the time was how skilling is not as impactful as it was to obtaining full gear, it's not a dire situation by any means however, infact I do consider it to be better &amp; having to focus more on combat to unlock weaponry seems objectively better than going on a skill rampage to gear up.
---
The consumables was something I was really thinking of when I made the post and notably the yields nowadays from skills that really have purpose other than being a milestone. I like the idea of integrating items that exist into new/repurposed items using the example in my other reply.

Lobster + Shark + Sea Turtle = Food item that functions as a karambwan but heals +2 more

he plays for money.
---
Pots seem fine if they were untradeable, agility course sounds like the one from rs3, I prefer it give more xp if it's not giving marks, not sure why we need tasks? Doesn't make sense to me.
---
Those divine potions should be untradeable, and im not sold on the agility course, other than that looks decent.
---
I don't even have poh multi-portal yet, it doesn't do anything I couldn't do, why bother, silly money sink for no value
---
Paid +10M for early obelisk in my home, that expense was worth it, i'm not a cheap fuck
---
See link attached.
---
Do PP 81-99. Best  approach to maintain sane.
---
Why does the longsword have a attack speed of 4, no other long sword in the game does. Just making more inconsistencies. Dissapointed overall, alot of this is just ripped from rs3
---
Expected to have a whippy quote, get r/BDSMouija instead
---
He's kinda right though. OSRS had like 5k players before they starting updating the game to something it wasn't.
---
Radical fools who think they're owed money wherever they go. Pathetic.

No, please refrain from saying such nasty things thankyou
---
If I get 99 rc I will be maxed though. Bad logic.
---
I'd argue the proposed xp-rates for the agility course are a tad bit too high. The new course requires 75 agility and but has better xp rates than the ardougne course at lvl 90. 62k/h at lvl 90 would be about the same rates as lvl 96 at ardougne when you stop failing that course entirely. Effectively, this means that a lvl 75 course is more viable than a lvl 90 course until lvl 96, at which point the lvl 90 course just about gets the same xp rates.
---
I'd propose a xp rate somewhere between Ardougne and Seers' + hard diary, \~59k/h at lvl 90 with the shortcuts.
---
Otherwise I'm quite excited about this update, keep up the good work!
---
I believe it‚Äôs a stick from temple trekking

---
It's a sword though, not a longsword
---
Ye, his prayer points and stat boost ran out which caused him to miss Drogon
---
Lmao, people see the 96 herblore requirement and shit the bed. They're **not** overloads - they don't boost your stats back if they're drained down by brews, nor do they boost to 125. I can't really see how this will change the bossing meta at all, just seems more of a convenience for slayer or combat training.
---
The 18k vamps was a lot, but each grind he has now is going to be longer (this tt grind already is), and he still has to do the vamp grind eventually. As soon as he has the whip, he's probably going to go back to vamps, so he will have the seeds again and can do the passive grind for herb during a different grind. All that's really happened is that the timeline for herblore being done fairly passively has shifted back within the same overall timeline.
---
You make a good point, it probably isn't a massive accomplishment in the long run. But I certainly wouldn't associate end-game money making with someone attempting to gain the levels to create potions that let them adhere to the meta on a base level.
---
Regardless, if we assume they're doing beginner raids at 5-7m/h or Vorkath at 2-3m/h then 96 Herblore probably wouldn't be a mountainous goal to overcome for advanced players.
---
But what I don't like is the void you would create between buying a potion and having a near maxed skill, there's nothing distinguishable to those inbetween those levels.
---
I know.  He says he buys a spear every task.  It's pretty obvious.   On my UIM, I just keep my ammo slot full of broad bolts for ranging everything.  Makes my life a lot easier.
---
It's deceiving people and violating their trust. It has everything to do with conscience
---
How are they not overloads?
---
Thinking they are overloads is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
---
No he is not, are you following the right Twitter? He's doing fine
---
When you use an ogre bellow on a frog
---
I wish that divine potions timer were reset after drinking a new dose
---
this update isnt going to remove every other potion in the game
---
everything will literally still be as easy as it is today for everyone without 96 herblore. whats the problem
---
What‚Äôs a good level for void at vorkath? I did the ds2 fight today with it and it went fine but I know he has a lot more health afterward.
---
yeah since we already have a good slash weapon at that tier - the tent whip.
---
i'd much rather look forwards to a 1H flail at that tier with crush as main bonus, rest the same stats.
---
You can't get into it because it plays differently, the most basic mechanics are different, the graphics are different, etc. If there was only a ton of new content it would be a hell of a lot easier to get back into it.
---
Why not, they're different games and both a lot of fun.  I go back and forth between them and its a nice bonus being able to buy rs3 bonds to pay for osrs membership or vice versa
---
Yes I have a few disabilities, is there an issue with this?
---
It's not easy to stream and actually produce watchable content to begin with. Doing it for as long as he plays would be torture for him, boring for us, and bad for his xp

I'm interested in WoW Classic only because I missed out and find the current like 110+ to be overwhelming

in terms of the relative power level of the pre-existing potions in the game these are essentially overloads. they have almost the exact same 'power level' and the same "jump" from previously BiS to this.
---
&gt;Claims 06 is bad because of the lack of g.e and gwd
---
&gt;Plays a f2p (u)im
---
That's big brain as fuck
---
Do you have any proof or you just making claims? The herblore argument is stupid because of temple trekking.
---
People have to be burned to believe this though. 
---
Unless you know the person IRL, dont trust them with anything.
---
These rewards are incredibly disappointing, what's the point of a new Agility course if it gives the same xp as Ardy on top of it taking more effort?
---
Also a Rapier equivilent? Really?
---
Yes there is, you are making everyone on this subreddit VERY ANGRY AND ANNOYED when you keep posting about this issue. EVERYONE VERY MAD . NO ONE HAPPY . PLEASE STOP POSTING THIS STUPID GARBAGE . NO ONE WANTS TO SEE IT . YOU HAVE POSTED ON HERE OVER TWENTY TIMES NOW

This isn't a personal matter, I have no issue getting 96 Herblore. I'm just putting forward my opinion.
---
But having your stat pinned to 118 for 5 minutes per dose significantly increases DPS either solo or in a team for a long period of time, that is a significant benefit.
---
Disable Custom Windows Chrome in RuneLite settings and you can snap it
---
Good point, and there already a lot of other skilling gates that benefit player pvm a lot more (though not usually so high level)
---
I think a lot of people just see the overload refreshing ability and are freaking out, not realizing the new drawback makes them pretty balanced.  I wouldnt mind a reason to train herb.
---
It didn't suck but it needed updates to survive, RuneScape was always built upon frequent updates
---
Plenty of people know what Welsh means. You're just too much of a freak to be intelligent enough to learn anything

Lol...
---
Look at those downvotes mate, hah
---
yeah seriously, crashers should instantly die IRL, really toxic behavior.
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit apparently. They aren't Overloads at all, they don't give a stronger boost than the base potion and don't let you reset lowered stats.
---
Just give it some time man, Zulrah will become super easy once you learn the rotations and mechanics. Plus, I don‚Äôt agree if you die the items should go with it. Gotta keep your HP above 41 or learn to tick eat, which is easy to do at Zulrah.

If you have a rapier and not the lumby elite diary. Please tell your mom you love her and you are sorry for stealing hee CC
---
Sure you can. You can get it on your first attempt ever as well in like 35 minutes. A new player with 3 months likely has low stats, gear and game knowledge though, in which case he **should expect** to spend a long time learning the caves and mechanics. 
---
Just because you and I think the fight caves are piss easy doesn't mean everyone does.
---
Can you explain?
---
Use the Wiki/Youtube for money making, quest doing, and skilling efficiency.
---
Set your long term goal on Barrows Gloves. AFK combat train at sand or rock crabs. High level AFK combat train at Nightmare Zone. Do lots of slayer and get your combat levels high for bossing to make stacks on stacks on stacks.

Stay away from the sand casino. Only broken hearts and lost banks to be found there.

Alright buddy, just settle down. Hacking is literally defined as taking advantage of vulnerabilities, two of which can be stupidity (yay, you're right!) and ignorance. Ignorance to a keylogger in somebody's webpage code can result in a compromised password. 
---
Sure, you can be elitist about it, but that doesn't change the fact that it does happen. So I'd suggest taking a step back, stop spewing fritos on your keyboard while you type out everything you learned at the Stronghold of Security, and try and have a rational discussion about a real problem.
---
No, it's a trap.

They can all go to my POH.

Calling people dense when you think these are equivalent to overloads lmoa
---
Rip eyes it was nice knowing you
---
Very good way of looking at it. Totally agree.
---
isnt the sense of accomplishment in flexing that you‚Äôve spent so much time getting to that 99? Not anyone can do that, people get bored and ask themselves wtf they are doing and whether its worth it and quit, so they never get maxed. But not our god lynx titan. 
---
To me, achievement doesnt have to be testing how good you are at something, its just a showcase of how much you‚Äôve done. Someone was flexing high vork kc in GE, it technically means nothing, but he had every right to be proud of his accomplishment

I did DS2 with 75 att, str, and defence. 70 prayer, 76 magic, and 77 range. So yeah you can do it for sure. I did it with karils and a mix between BP and DCB

---
That's the joke

Well, the gp/hr will be exactly the time people think it is worth, as long as it isn't worth doing for the xp.

That Would Be A Good Idea. If Only We Could Destroy Things Like Bowls Too.
---
Does it have Demon Slayer with zero-cooldown Demon Cry? :)
---
If I remember the post you're referring to any potion that only adds an auto re-pot effect every so many seconds is unnecessary. This is the reason we have the Preserve prayer.
---
Change everything asap dude, hacker has been checking out on your account.

Nay to the med diary giving 5% yield to all allotment patches, farming is OP enough rn - do we really need 5% more snape grass from each patch?
---
It's not that I necessarily want to *be* maxed. I know you can buy a maxed character. I want to experience the game. But the one time I tried (when WoD launched and I bought everything up to MoP for like $30) no one was doing any of the low level content. And with such a high cap and easy leveling, most people running alts would just be power leveling. That's why I'm looking forward to at least trying Classic. Squishing the levels and amount of content back down (and having everyone start fresh again) give more people that I can experience content with.
---
Two flames in the shape of two towers.. forget it
---
That‚Äôs actually a nice idea!
---
They only boost to 118 stats instead of 125.
---
Lol he‚Äôs so salty
---
Ok let me rephrase: 10 hours is a very long time to spend on learning Jad. No one I know spent more than 5 hours in total learning jad. You definitely shouldn't expect to take 8+ tries for a boss that's essentially extremely trivial once you get your nerves under control.
---
The agility course for a quest this requirement should give more XP than ardougne IMO. Idk why everyone loses there mind over a bit more XP. Doesn't have to be a tonne more. Like 5k an hour more.
---
Someone also suggested a moving and changing agility course. That sounds pretty cool. One that changes constantly so it's not just brain-dead clicking. You could make it fun.
---
I wish Crystal armor was better. But I guess everyone would complain about range buff. Which is fair I guess.
---
I think the BOW needs a bigger boost. 30% more instead of 15. Id like to use something other than BP. 
---
Idk why people have issues with rewards. I think gauntlet could he great and I'd like it to have better rewards. That's just me though.

Don't think they'd ever put 99 rc as a requirement for a diary. 96 fishing is already absurd and not appreciated by the community so 99 rc would spark outrage

---
What's so bad about temporarily saving a screenshot on someone's computer?
---
it wasn't good in rs3 because it was another addition to the already op shit like chaotics, curses, ss, yak, unicorn, titan etc. blowpipe came out 3 years ago and is more dps than chaotics. i don't think they should add anything that makes shit do more dmg but clearly they are set on doing so, least they could do is make these untradeable so it only effects high level players. not like 50-70 hours is anything compared to how much time you're spending getting to the point where you can do high level pvm. med level players can keep using what they use now, work towards the tiny dps increase and be happy when they get there.

mmm those thighs look like they could crush my head like a watermelon
---
I think they may have been added as a more consistent sink to crystal shards to give them some value for those who want to do the various activities but do not want to use the degradable items
---
I agree. It would be cool if we had like a mini diary or checklist instead of a full on achievement diary to lock the proposed diary rewards behind something.
---
judging a minigame before it's even been released.....
---
Glad I'm not the only one I don't get it anyhow and I haven't even seen "Swampletics" or whatever people are always posting about.
---
Because pures
---
I'd rather see the Tirannwn tasks split off into their own diary along with the Prifdinnas tasks. Also gives an opportunity to rework the Western Provinces diary.
---
Its me Slater lol
---
Crystal armour is **weaker** than black d'hide, locked behind a grandmaster quest that requires *eight* level 70 stats, degrades, is untradeable &amp; difficult to obtain through random minigame drops... all to buff the crystal bow to a point where it's barely better than a rune crossbow with good bolts+offhand?
---
The bow is a T70 weapon that's weaker than a T61. Buff it so that it's a viable weapon on its own, and then crystal armour will actually feel like it's worthwhile rather than dead content introduced to pad out a minigame's drop table.
---
That makes sense, thank you!
---
need source pls
---
Isnt that exactly what this is?
---
Seers - 45k/hr
---
Seers with diary - 56k/hr
---
Priff - 56-62k/hr
---
Ardy - 62k/hr

What's the issue?
---
Thank you so much!
---
They aren‚Äôt overloads but a 97 herb req for a slightly better super combat is gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
Jagex clearly give no fucks about animals so we should stop asking.
---
Anything that makes you want to kill yourself a little less isn‚Äôt an xp waste because it ensures you will still alive a little longer to gain xp

---
Has it actually diverged? I thought they just avoid anything that rs3 has been doing and just talk about other parts of the world
---
Cause diaries are fucking annoying to do. I don‚Äôt wanna spend 20 minutes doing some random shit I‚Äôve never done and never will do. 2k total here and I haven‚Äôt even touched the kourend diaries and karamja is only easy completed lol.
---
Where is this?
---
It would keep it more so than if it was 4t but if you oversaturate the equipment tier they'll drop in price 
---
If the 5t is far more common/easy to obtain it'll get used more than the 4t causing the price to drop because of lower demand because it's not as accessible when it is ALREADY a luxury item rather than bis (apart from maybe slayer?)
---
Can people just not let content creators alone to idk... create content?
---
There is no point ever buffing any other range weapons until the BP nerf happens.
---
Its just high hit, not dps i think
---
Ew this guy actually did mage training arena

Absolutely. 
---
I think I was leaning more on the crystal key halves as I just recalled the full key is untradeable. But making a key half out of crystals would be just as odd if not more strange than enhancing a key. 
---
I retract my comment lol.
---
Yeah but the quest has to give 10k def xp
---
Looks like a penisa
---
Looool!!! This happened to me at the gym a few days ago! I was so confused for about the first twenty seconds of it! Shit‚Äôs great, though!
---
PVP is in a decent spot, so many more options now for builds &amp; weapons
---
Add more slayer
---
Then you might not want to play OSRS since that is all it is. A big ole' grind lol.
---
Diaries are like super boring quests that they didn‚Äôt bother writing a story for. 
---
The act of completing those things is more annoying than grinding the requirements sometimes.

Hes missing his gay art student black hat and his golden ego watch but looking pretty good!
---
Oh no I think they definitely have a use but aren't over powered because you effectively shouldn't use brews with them (if they cost a lot more)
---
I'll be voting yes on these because they have a reasonable and tangible set of positive and negatives tradeable or not
---
Hey I let someone borrow my twisted bow and they blocked me too. Can I pm you?
---
if the time between uploads is too long then it will hurt his income. If the uploads are bad then it might hurt his income. So he's in a bit of a pickle I think. I'm not an expert on youtube monetization though.
---
yeah but i mean its only 5 minutes for a dose, youd normally re-pot at that point with any other pot anyways so the extra minutes the stat is boosted for isnt all that big of a deal since itd only be like 3 levels
---
Unfortunately it's only possible to see them both as canon where they overlap. For example, the vampyre/Myreque quest series:  
---
**OSRS:**
---
In Search of the Myreque &gt; In Aid of the Myreque &gt; Darkness of Hallowvale &gt; A Taste of Hope
---
**RS3:** 
---
In Search of the Myreque &gt; In Aid of the Myreque &gt; Darkness of Hallowvale &gt;  Legacy of Seergaze &gt; The Branches of Darkmeyer &gt; The Lord of Vampyrium &gt; River of Blood
---
They have completely diverged in terms of both physical quests themselves, and the lore behind them. 
---
The are only canon up to Darkness of Hallowvale. While this is an extreme example of diverging canon storylines, it does prove that while you can tend to use RS3's story as canon in some cases, it's not recommended in all.
---
Haha I get it bro. Because you‚Äôre an asshole who hates people different than them!!!
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
For real!  Nobody would ever let it go.
---
It should be as good as blowpipe? Are you off your rocker? Nothing should be as good as blowpipe, not even blowpipe lol.
---
You're not wrong, saying its "just one button" its exaggerating, sure. But the it's objectively true the skill ceiling is miles and miles lower than retail. It's such a simple concept the grasp now with the game knowledge that the average player has. I think classic will be fun for awhile, I played nostalrius and had some fun. But if kept 1:1 to classic, the game will not thrive. If you didnt play classic/tbc there a VERY slim chance you will even make it to 60. Not because of the time it takes, but because of the amount of QoL that doesn't exist. Waiting for a quest item for a 10 min respawn with 15 people there isn't fun. Class balancing is awful.(some specs simply dont exist in terms of viability)
---
I log into rs3 everyday to use those keys then GTFO of there. I hear you can get 200m from em.
---
Thanks mate. Will try it out later
---
I can‚Äôt imagine 70-100 hour weeks of grinding + video editing and planning on top of that being very profitable per hour. At least not yet for him.
---
Plus it probably takes a huge toll on his physical body and sanity.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was a samurai sword
---
We wanted a little buff for the crystal bow, like the crystal quiver. Don‚Äôt make us have to use a full set of armour to recieve that little buff.
---
Imagine scamming someone for 4m, yikes. Especially someone you would consider a friend.
---
I LIKE EM BIG

hm did you sell claw for?

I've been saying this since it was announced. Vanilla WoW will be super fun for like... 6 months. Then without updates it'll get super stale. What I'm hoping for is a journey kind of like what we're experiencing with OSRS. Yeah, port it back to vanilla and when you gotta start implementing updates and the playerbase starts to drop because the novelty wore off, implement player voting and start finding out what features the players want and how they want to progress the game. We would get to experience Burning Crusade again, Lich King again and by that time I'm sure that they can figure out something to do after Lichking other than going to Cata. We can get the more "easyscape" wow for people like we have RS3, and then we can get a more "oldschool" feel with the vanilla progression.

Just ask the real question, cuz the nature of farming is that pretty much all of it is dailies. You can dislike farming, that's fair enough. But let's not pretend it's anything other than "dailies: the skill" lol

These all seem underwhelming and under powered to be honest :/

As it stands right now the priff agility course is not worth it. This is the highest requirement for an agility course and yet it's still worse than ardougne? Plus no Mark's of grace so if you have the elite ardougne diaries done why would you want to go to priff agilty? 
---
I'd say either raise the xp/h flat out or add an elite requirement that makes it noticeably better than ardougne.
---
8, it gives 8 per hour. At that rate it would take 19 hours of agility to charge your crystal armor. Hell you cant even construct a key with 8.
---
Well hes right and wrong. Because for some players he was right, but for me i put in 16hour days on average from launch throughout the ‚Äúdark ages‚Äù of osrs.

Robbers shouldn't go to jail they just don't wanna work for a currency deemed worth something !

People aren't playing this game because it's 2006/2007scape. People are playing this game because of all the updates that Jagex have made to the RS2-esk game. The game isn't even close to what RS2 was nor is it anywhere near what 2007scape was. It's not just the in-game updates that draws people to the game. It's the third-party clients too. If Jagex banned all third-party clients, a sizable player base will quit just because of how OP the QoL plugins are.
---
Just believe harder and you will hit eventually!
---
It doesn't really give any xp, so the only reason will be to make money, and it will always have a demand, so if it is worse than other money making methods, the gp/hr will increase until it is worth doing.
---
Whats your uims username, I also have a f2p 1def uim
---
Those potions seem really underwhelming. Should last a bit longer or boost to 120 at 99 or I don't really see the point. I kinda like the fact that you can't brew spam with them like you can with ovl, and that jagex has taken a very conservative approach, but with all these drawbacks there's room to make them a little bit better.
---
You do understand if he is getting a rune cbow because it can fire enchanted bolts.  
---
There is no way he is going to train to 99 range with a rune cbow making bolts the entire way when his XP per hour with karils is twice as good.  I'm sure he will grind for the karils cbow while getting his free mage levels from the runes. (Also stocking up on money for bolt racks)
---
You do realize that seers, with diary, caps out at 56k well before 90, yes?
---
Priff's starting rate, at level 75, is 56k (which is the same as seer's' **MAX RATE**) and scales up from there. Did you even read the poll blog?

Didn't expect this sub to be so prone to blatant advertising.

To get the best prayers level it does not cost near that much, I understand unlocking the prayer is costly but its a one time purchase. What we are talking about is and overload type of potion where only players that have got the level a can use them. That's fine but overloads ended up costing upwards of 50k to make each and quickly became one of, if not the largest part of supply costs.
---
The herb requirements are fine in rs3 at this point due to the shit load of new potions they've added which bridge the gap between other potions and ovls. Still I don't think these potions would be a big enough boost in power to justify everyone having to get 96 herb. Tbh I'd rather them have lower reqs just so higher herb levels can be open to stronger potions in the future.
---
yeah but the difference is that when you get lucky with 15m risk, you get 150k loot piles. When they get lucky, they get the whole 15m with very little risk at all. The idea of risking 10-15m more than your opponent just for 3-4 extra max hits feels... meh. And that‚Äôs about the best way to sum it up, I guess.
---
y'all need saradomin
---
Pfft everyone arguing about the staff when the man has a rapier with no Jordan‚Äôs on... smh
---
Lmao, you are right. Why the hell does the coif have +26 magic defence when the rest is on par with black d'hide. Anyways, the set is as good as the set bonus which seems to be way too weak for these armors to valuable.

Congrats! That‚Äôs my next goal as well. Let‚Äôs see that sexy quest cape (t) though üòç

You're an idiot, cloud is one of runescape top tier pvmers.

It cost me about 300k per task in cballs when i was using them at first
---
Yes
---
Yea he was definitely wrong about there being no market for OSRS. On the other hand, I don't think this game would be nearly as successful without all the QoL and updates from later than 2007, like the g.e. They've really padded the endgame with content, which was necessary to get people who had good accounts in RS2 but had the rug pulled out from under them with EoC. It had to get back to a similar level as 2012 in terms of content.
---
it'd used in raids and making unf. pots is profitable
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
Dude how do you print custom images onto a rolling tray? Thats sick!
---
Yeah haha, was looking for the best place to ask
---
Fire 7 doesn't meet the minimum resolution needed to play the game. I have the fire 7, tried it myself, and like JeanzyM said, there's nothing you can do about the resolution. The fire 7 is an entry level potato tablet.
---
So i can swap it. I think it works at around 70m OSGP for 200m RS3 but that‚Äôs just a shot in the dark. Worth it for 20 seconds of time.
---
Forgot to blur out the five charges on your games necklace. RIP account.
---
And OSRS is "oldschool"? OSRS is nowhere near what it was originally intended to be. It's not even close to what RS2 before EoC is. OSRS is RS2.5.
---
I was wrong, you are fun
---
Medium clues???
---
What does it boost?
---
I think the point OP is making is that xp rates for farming are increasing with every tree update.
---
I could be misinterpreting though.
---
13k for 8 hours with no chance of disease is basically the best tree out there if it's not too expensive.
---
Rip, is there anywhere that states the minimum resolution?
---
Interesting strawman

To follow on from your logic murders shouldn‚Äôt go to jail because although stealing and scamming is bad, Playerkilling is okay

I get this a joke but i personally find it in poor taste in this context.

wtf!!? Jagex started catering to pures now??!?!?
---
Swampletics is Bis
---
I want it
---
The Tentacle Whip is already exclusively used for PKing and staking, so adding a slightly stronger, much more expensive, still degradable slash weapon won't do anything to affect that.
---
1: pure brids risk more than 150k
---
2: meds don't have to risk 15m. You can easily rag and still have a steep advantage.
---
3: you don't have to stay and fight anyone
---
What do you mean ‚Äúlocked like construction was on release‚Äù?
---
I would take 2006 over 2007 scape any day.
---
yes being forced to get 2000 def exp from a quest reward is such an insane requirement for endgame content.
---
People say the same thing about vanilla wow too, they are universally wrong.
---
Sure, but that can be balanced after the fact.  I'd rather they introduce weak content then buff it slowly over time while taking feedback.
---
1400 total here, did falador easy diary, realized it was 10x more boring than questing. 
---
Sucks though, because I know some diaries are really fucking useful so I'll probably force myself to finish them eventually.
---
At least you can get an easy +4 boost with mushroom pies.
---
Also to add to this you should snag the Bearhead helmet as well as regen bracelet, Zerker ring(i), Black D-Hide chaps, and the Varrock Diary Armor chest piece 1 it is equal to a Steel Platebody and you can wear it at 1 Defense, Fire Cape if you wanna spend an absolute ass ton of $$$ on purple sweets lul, I just go with Obby Cape personally.

Farming is already fast and very cheap following the farming guild. I can't say I care much about another patch making it slightly faster. I could take it or leave it. I'm already 99 farm

You‚Äôre wrong.

---
The man was mean to me on the video game waaaah

Yeah but it‚Äôs not just something anyone can pick up, I would argue that it‚Äôs rewarding to get good xp post quest completion from such a tree for no cost considering palm trees can get expensive.
---
yeah fuck that guy
---
Crystal Graceful*
---
It added tons of risk and depth to the game, I agree. The problem is that the Runescape community will grief/lure you for 250k gp when they have millions, it's just fun to them to ruin a noobs day. Having the current death mechanics is a safer environment for Runescape, which is fine. The game isn't meant to be a hardcore game like that, just requires hardcore amounts of time.
---
Yeah uhh I'm gonna climb out on a limb here and say you've never been pking at the caves in your life and you're just talking out of your ass. Who on earth would go to the rev caves wearing torags, a b ring, a d scimmy and a fury? Wtf kind of setup is that? 
---
The biggest difference isn't gear, its prayers. Rigour/aug/piety are absolutely enormous upgrades that make fights between pures and mains 100% one sided.
---
Idk what you're on about regarding 100 hp in one tick either, hardly anyone even uses gmauls at rev caves.
---
Raids 1 its good to get at least 78

RuneLite recently added a plug-in that makes certain seeds and herbs more easily identifiable by putting some initials below the icon. People have had some fun with spelling out words and stuff (MAHOG IS HARD, in this case), but mostly I just like that I can actually see which identical seeds are what at a glance.
---
I would like a 2006 graphics option for UI, Monsters and i think in 2007 they remade some music too. I like old school because its basically an alternate road Runescape could have went and ended up working.
---
Honestly I enjoyed 2006scape pre alpha a lot more than early OSRS, cause we were all a relatively close knit community who loved old runescape. A lot of us knew each other from the forums months before a playable version of the game was even out, and even the mods knew a lot of us well. I remember the guy who recorded the Falador Massacre was a mod too surprisingly enough, but he was kind of an asshole
---
To make taking a few logs and tinderbox instead of something like extra pots, brews, or food, the boosts would have to be really really good. Too good. No place for that here.

ITT: People ignoring that the whole point of players wanting Oldschool/classic servers was to go back to old design philosophies, not to go back to a stagnant 2007 server that never gets updated.

People would use the kind of logic in that comment to justify why Runescape 3 was better all around and why people shouldn't have been begging for a roll back.
---
Quest Requirements - This is a grandmaster quest, so I'd prefer more requirements and rewards that reflect those requirements and difficulty of the quest, but that's my opinion and arbitrary requirements don't feel good so this is fine.
---
Crystal Armor - And so the ranged fetish continues. This iteration looks more rewarding than previous iterations at least. I'd prefer to see the bow do more damage, but even as is the set does fill a gap before you can afford armadyl.
---
Blade of Saeldor - I said in previous feedback that the gauntlet sounds like an awesome piece of content and it needed something to give players a reason to do it. This is a great addition to gauntlet rewards, but I think it needs to be honed a bit. I would prefer to have its dps reduced below tent whip (and rapier) and I think adding an interesting spec or passive would make it far more interesting and could have it fill a more defined role rather than pushing two other high-tier items out of their roles.
---
Agility Course - I like the design behind the course with the shortcuts, but I don't think the numbers are quite there yet. If this wasn't locked behind a grandmaster quest, it might be fine as-is. But it's locked behind a grandmaster quest - act like it. A level 75 course behind a grandmaster quest should be superior in every way to a level 60 rooftop course. I like the handling of xp rates at level 90-96, though. Looks like elven is superior to Ardy until level 96, where Ardy takes the lead to 99 (barely, but also likely in gp due to marks).
---
Crystal Tree - I know some people don't like the design of farming as a skill, but I do. I like this addition as is.
---
Enhanced Crystal Chest - Poll loot table and target average gp.
---
Divine Potions - Love it, looks like a great addition. I think it could be even more valuable and meaningful content if they were untradeable, I see no reason why they shouldn't be. Love the design though, this is a great reward and a good sink for crystal shards outside degradable equipment.
---
Crystal Implings/Elven Signet - Cool. Elven Signet sounds like a great reward as a drop and a cool way to bring hunting into the patch. For the level requirement, quest requirement, and likely drop rate I think 5% proc chance is too low. Also, it should have stats - poll these. I see no reason why the effect should not apply to the sword, that seems silly. If you're using the sword for bossing, you're likely using a better ring anyway. Having the option for that shard sustain for things like slayer would be good I think. As is, I don't think it gets touched except for the crystal tools (zero combat applications).
---
Achievement Diary - Passives look good, but the pendant looks bad. 3 teleports should be the easy reward, 5 should be removed entirely, and new effects should be added for medium and hard rewards. It's tied to content that rewards crystal shards, which is great, but 1-4% on its own isn't much. I'd suggest medium and hard rewards that provide a meaningful benefit to wearing this amulet while doing shard activities.
---
Runelite? No
---
If the prif diary is going to be harder, then it's rewards should be better than all of the other individual diaries. The diary rewards look pretty meh
---
You‚Äôre acting like adding this would ruin UIM, but it‚Äôs just another game mode not a replacement.
---
Not everyone cares about maxing stats or getting to 99 prayer, I just think UIM is a fun challenge, and it‚Äôd be nice to get recognized for hardcore, especially since the meta is to suicide constantly (which is obnoxious, in my opinion).
---
Some people would enjoy it and it would have literally no negative impact on anyone, I don‚Äôt see why not implement it.
---
Interesting thanks, one think i note you cant have book of law with msb (i) so probs even closer still!
---
I think for the sake of fractional benefit, but 50% extra cost i will stick with dcb ..
---
Also given some monsters will be higher defence there is probably a little more value in the dcb and its flexibility with off hand
---
Appreciate the calc :)
---
Agreed, Lance already did enough damage to rapier and it‚Äôs main uses. This will just put the final nail in the coffin for the rapier.
---
Personally I can only tolerate it when they dont link the sub
---
The long con
---
Ran into a dude at Hulaween with a trimmed 99 attack cape on
---
Where would you even use a chaotic longsword in the game, especially given the recharge rate? CLS didn't have many uses in rs2 besides bandos (now outclassed by blowpipe in osrs). It's the same reason something like the leaf-bladed battleaxe is rarely used over a 4 tick weapon.
---
Yeah seems a nice chap really.
---
sharks/mantas whichever i have. sharks now.
---
Prif course should give at least 70k
---
No
---
How shitty are your friends?
---
How else would you train range
---
Jagex fuck off and stop adding degradable items to the game. ITS ANNOYING and nobody except nerds care about item sinks
---
Closest you're gonna get :)
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ERR OOO UN EEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEE
---
You're right, but what else can we expect when this design of crystal armour have only a single purpose: to buff the crystal bow? You need to wear 4 degradeable items, where 3 of them are charged with UNTRADEABLE shards. 
---
If Jagex expects people to use crystal armour together with crystal bow given all the "negatives" (GM quest req, degradeable, 2h weapon, 4-item set), then it should be really good at least against SOMETHING.
---
is that fuckin vito from the sopranos?
---
What
---
how exactly does the bot detection even work then? whats stopping me from using ahk to automate mining when i go to sleep every night?
---
From the actual question that will be polled:
---
"**Poll Question #5**Should an Agility course requiring 75 Agility to use be added to  Prifddinas? It will contain variable shortcuts that increase possible XP  gains per hour. **This will offer up to 62k xp/hr At at 90 Agility.**"
---
Am I the only one with reading comprehension?
---
[Found &lt;&lt;&lt; from here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/WorriedTune/comments/bmymjw/exclusive_edition/)
---
I completely agree. Couldn't believe they tied it to this.
---
Oops, my bad, the bow without the book would be 3.4 vs 3.46  
---
Versus a brutal black dragon, it'd be 0.97 vs 0.89, favouring the DCB. So yeah, the DCB seems like a decent choice tbh.
---
Give double exp for WC if you are pooping while you train.
---
the fucking gonads on this man
---
I guess this question doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Ahk is allowed for remapping. Not allowed for mouse movement. 
---
JAGEX not runelite will detect if you‚Äôre using ahk for mouse movements if you do it for a prolonged period of time. Runelite doesn‚Äôt give af what you do.
---
Yeah I mean it used to have like 250 more range def as a set but now it's worse than rune lol, quite a jump
---
Meh, they may aswell add group ironman instead of that. I don't think it would be that popular, you wouldn't see loads of people at vwest like before ge. I mean I'm sure there would be some, but items besides common supplies like food, herbs and low level gear would be very hard to come by, so for the most part it would basically be group ironman anyways
---
Crystal armour - This isn't useful at all. You should aim to create armour that makes the crystal bow slightly better than 3a bow with dragon arrows, that way it actually has a nieche (long range, fast, but you have to use degrading crystal armour). A marginal 2-3% dps increase over d arrow 3a bow would be plenty. Additionally, this means that craws bow (a wildy only weapon) won't be the go-to useful budget long range high attack speed bow outside of the wildy. Currently crystal bow appears to be quite significantly less dps with the crystal armour than craws bow + armadyl (calculations could be a little off), which means it's basically dead content.
---
The Blade of Saeldor - This must be a joke? The only way I would be okay with this item is if you swapped this proposed weapon with the Ghrazi rapier from ToB (making rapier a slash weapon and this new item a stab weapon). Stab is universally useless because of the lance existing. There is no scenario I can possibly think of where you would pick rapier from the choice of rapier, lance, BoS. Rapier was already devalued beyond belief by the lance. I've spoken about the problems with the rapier many times. If you want to seriously push this, you should give the rapier at least one niche use, the best idea I have had to so far is to reduce the ToB boss' stab defence to be equal to their slash defence, but if the BoS passes the repair would STILL never be strictly preferable to the BoS/lance in any scenario apart from killing dark beasts (lol). Absolutely voting no to this.
---
Agility course - Good, seers needs some diversity. I'm not much into skilling though so I'll let someone else evaluate the xp rates.
---
Iorwerth's Dungeon - Why not, but I don't see any purpose of it. What tasks would be preferable here compared to anywhere else? Maybe if nechs drop the morytania tower drops they could be decent for irons.
---
Crystal seeds - Sure.
---
Enhanced crystal chest - I guess this is an attempt to make the RDT less shit? I'd prefer you just removed/fixed the RDT to be honest.
---
Infinite teleport crystal - Just make it a quest reward, that's so weird. Why would we slay/steal from the people we just helped when they refuse to give us a teleport crystal. No issues really I guess, just seems thematically weird?
---
Divine potions - At first I felt like it was pretty over powered, but after considering that the boost is entirely lost after 5 minutes it seems pretty reasonable to me. In my opinion this just makes stat boost management much easier, but that's good in a way because currently you need a 3rd party client to know when stat boosts are going to tick down (especially important for max str scythe).
---
Diary - Yikes more farming buffs. Can an update exist without buffing farming? Adding a diary for prif seems weird to me, how does it not come under western provinces?
---
No, you're good, jagex can if you're unlucky
---

Runescape can detect it.
---
You most likely wont get banned for it, however bot at your own risk
---
Since no one's mentioned this, the general rule of thumb is that msb is better for low defense enemies and rcb is better for high defense. That being said I skipped dcb so I'm not sure if the step up from rcb is worth it. I went straight to bp because it's way better. If you're gonna spend 5m on a cb that isn't that widely used just put that 5m into darts and scales and by the time you've used that up you'll have made it back. The only real draw of the dcb is that it can use dragon bolts which isn't that useful outside of bossing like vorkath, and even then I personally just use no with addy darts and profit.
---
Because the server receives your clicks and realises they're being automated due to the timing and precision (general roboticness) of them.

Is that Cloud Badass's alt? I remember watching his main in the Woox/B0aty/etc team doing the first TOB runs when that released...
---
Ironmans that dont have a zammy hasta?
---
Your boost =extra inflation
---
Overall, I think the rewards look pretty good and I don't have much of an issue with polling any as is. The new Crystal Armor seems much more reasonable, giving a Bow buff and also acting as Ranged Prayer Armor.
---
That said, I am not a fan of the Blade; I don't think we need a degrading Slash version of the Rapier. On top of that, its cost is pretty unreasonable since at 50 shards per hour that is 1250 attacks per hour and it doesn‚Äôt even get the 5% reduction from the ring (which would mean you'd lose +8 Strength anyway). I'd rather have seen a different weapon like a Longsword that could be useful without filling the same role as the Rapier than a worse Rapier.
---
I like the idea of the Crystal Enhancement Seeds, but the cost is too high. Currently, you only need 20K NMZ points which takes like 5 minutes if that to imbue an item. The proposed cost is 40 Shards, which would take 48~ minutes per imbue. I'd say the cost should be lowered to like 10 Shards; if not, the Enhanced versions may take too much time to be worth using for how fast the items degrade.
---
Speaking of degrading, the Crystal Ring feels a bit strange. Only 5% is pretty low seeing as suggestions were for a Quiver with 50% and there never seemed to be an issue with those. There is also no mention of stats on the ring or if it is tradeable or not.
---
The Agility Course sounds nice, but only 8 Shards per hour is terrible; at the current rates that is 5 hours of Agility to imbue a Crystal Bow! At most, it gives the same exp as Ardy and 75 it looks to be worse than Tele-Seers, so the exp isn't that great. If on top of that you get 1/6th the shards of other methods, there seems to be little reason to use it over Rooftop Courses which would give far more Marks of Grace. The Diary does increase it by an unspecified amount, but even if it doubles to 16 Shads per hour that still seems pretty slow compared to the 50~ per hour of other methods. Without knowing all the numbers and plans, I'd say 20 per hour normally and 30 per hour with Diary seem more reasonable.
---
The Divine Potions are a neat twist on Overload style potions. I like them, but I think it needs to be made very clear that they don't work with Brews; like put in the question "If stats are reduced to a level below your base stat (e.g. Brews), the potion‚Äôs effect will wear off" or such. Also, my bank is not looking forward to 8 new potion types.
---
Lastly, the Diary is a bit unusual, but I kinda like it. Since it is already an oddity, I wouldn't mind if it scrapped the Easy and Medium tier rather than having them higher level than normal. There are no mention of stats for the pendant; I'd expect it to have some stats like Prayer. And overall the rewards do seem a bit lackluster compared to other diaries. For example, reduced Crystal items from Islwyn is pointless since it is already cheaper to recharge seeds with Ilfeen and it is unclear if that will still be useful with the new Enhancement system. If there isn't enough room for rewards or if the tasks aren‚Äôt substantial enough to justify better rewards, perhaps it would be best to change it to a Task List like on Fossil Island for a simpler version of the pendant than making it a Diary.

Solid argument.  I had never considered this before.

---
Yes addy are generally the best bang for your buck so to speak. If you feel like you're spending too much you can go mith. Blessed dhide is definitely worth holding onto, I also hope you have a slayer helm (i).
---
If you're really that worried about cost, honestly you should just use rcb. I know dcb is technically an upgrade but it's really not necessary and has pretty niche uses. If you're not using dragon bolts (again only used on high def high health bosses/ enemies) then full blessed dhide with broad bolts and rcb is the way to go. That being said as soon as you make the switch to bp you'll never want to go back because it's sooooo much faster than any standard cb.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. Most people who vote don‚Äôt have a scythe though. I agree that they should be untradable for sure
---
Will the Blade of Saeldor be able to be imbued to keep its stats through the degrading?
---
RIP Ghrazi Rapier.
---
Revs are still one of the most popular pvm spots despite being in the wild? They would almost certainly be the most popular if they weren't in the wild.
---
Pvm and skilling spots are already in the wilderness, there's no reason that PvP spots like rev caves can't be locked behind skilling requirements, or efficient skilling be locked behind pvm. Every aspect of the game is intertwined to some degree. To suggest that any playstyle should be allowed to exist in isolation, such as PvP without skilling or pvm, would be accepting that skillers or pvmers should also be able to access all the content they enjoy in the wilderness without doing any PvP, and that doesnt make much sense.
---
Agreed, and which is why I suspect Ironman is popular.  
---
But imo the game is extremely skewed towards just stake all your money and buy all your BIS gear, and only barrows/ferocious gloves aren't.  There definitely should be more content balance on what is buyable and what is earned.   It's extremely dull knowing most skills are best trained with "farm vork or raids and throw money at the skill" mentality.  And it feels like this would be a small step in that direction.
---
Still no update on the Hydra Tail, an item Jagex themselves have seen as dead content and said they are willing to change.  Sad, guess here's to waiting 4 years for one of the 100 proposed changes to be taken into consideration.

---
You missed that my point altogether that was explaining why Runescape 3's endgame is significantly more challenging than gwd. I never talked about osrs's endgame initially, so how could I have been comparing them? 
---
In a game where max stat is 99 I do consider 69-70 to be fairly high, of course levels are going to be subjective for how you place them as everyone is at a different point, but its still around mid-game regardless. DS 2 requires 85 combat level and 75 magic, while mm2 requires 69 slayer which does take a ton of time compared to other skills.
---
 I still breezed through Vorkath and Galvek, my experience in rs3 made the mechanics easy. In osrs all you have to worry about is positioning, prayer(flick), consumables, simple mechanics, and some weapon/armor switches in endgame stuff. In rs3 you need to balance defensive abilities, maximum dps rotations with perfect threshold timings, special items, timing stuns, complex mechanics, multiple ring switches, planted feet switches, 2h/dual wield switches for autoattacks, and all those listed in osrs's list. The game is very complex and there is so much going on, switching to old school is so much simpler and quicker to learn. I do really enjoy that simplicity as things are so much easier to learn and its more relaxing having so much fewer things to focus on. Theatre of blood honestly does look pretty easy to me simplifying mechanics, which can still be very punishing as it is long and deadly. I obviously can't prove I can do it in that short amount of time, but I assure you learning it will take me significantly less time than Solak. Tob isn't easy for sure, but after watching 1 video I understand how to deal with every mechanic and when to swap gear to optimize effectiveness.

Imagine clicking the exact same spot every time for every action when mining for several hours. Not even the most skilled can click the very exact spot every single time.
---
training herblore would feel more rewarding and imo the best top tier potions shouldn't be another buyable potion.
---
This is not a meta defining potion.
---
Your dad is your husband, or the other thing?
---
I try this but people don't respond for some reason
---
Maybe they think my gear is nooby or something
---
Sorry to tack this on but since your slayer level is so low I'd just stick to rcb till ~70 slayer cause that's when you start making profit. At that point pretty much no matter your setup you should get a bp. Bp is probably not worth the cost for the level of slayer you are currently doing. Right now rcb/msb and cannon are your best friends.

A Morningstar is a long handled mace
---
Same, I just did Agility and it felt amazing. Doing cooking now as a break and feeling like the last pic. Runecrafting is after and I‚Äôm super pumped
---
I'd definitely give back a drop like this.  Anything 5m and under, I'd give back for sure.  
---
5m-10m.. probably, but if person is a dick about it I'm keeping it.  
---
10m-25m, it's a toss up.  If I'm in a great mood I'd probably give it back.  
---
25m+ and my greedy ass is probably keeping it.  I've got skills to train and gear to buy, ya know?
---
I am at ~4000 hours and my total is 2223. I am a pretty casual player. If I didn‚Äôt do PVM and just skilled I would be maxed.

Imagine being bad at an RNG based game
---
I have a chromebook too, i can send you some links on how to get osrs on there if you‚Äôre interested. It‚Äôs done by dual booting Linux on the chromebook with crouton, not too hard if you‚Äôre a bit tech savvy
---
With Wow, it already has an extremely popular private server scene. This was absolutely not the case for osrs private servers.
---
Ya I hate rolling a joint, can't do it for the life of me. Blunts are easy though
---
Perhaps instead of adding a new high tier slash weapon with the blade of S. Make it a mace and turn it into a crush weapon, since we have no crush weapons on par with tentacle or rapier
---
1. Probably a scammer but not a bot.

2. They are looking for real value not snakeskin which is worth almost nothing.

3. Just report/ignore them.

Would the teleport crystal to Prifiddinas not be better suited as a reward for completing Song of the Elves? 
---
I don't want to have to complete the quest, then run around pickpocketing Elves in order to get back to Prifiddinas.
---
I tried to do the lure but was so bad at it so i gave up and then i found that bank spot but the knight moves alot compare to the lure.
---
nah a lot of times people dont respond but sometimes they do, just gotta keep at it
---
Oh alright, misinterpreted your comment then! Sorry about that
---
He's smoking sushi?
---
Ok but lets be honest, PVP is different. It's not RNG to switch weapons and inventory tabs and keep up on prayer etc.
---
No let me have Black Graceful ok, I asked first, you can have yours after me
---
My thoughts exactly. Tent prices have been low for awhile so maybe adding some diversity to the weapons will help prices long term.
---
Lmao that's exactly what I was thinking. I was like, I swear I've been there before.

That's 2gp you didnt have before!

Depends on how high you score on the spectrum.

Like I said, there's no 'hard' requirement, but say that no content is locked behind pvp is a misrepresentation at best. HCIM are basically excluded from all wilderness content because of pvp. Revs themselves are a great example of pvm content gated by pvp. Even the dark ü¶Ä fisher has to accept he's going to probably get killed at some point.
---
To say that nowhere has a pvp requirement is to ignore the existence of the wilderness.
---
dude i just saw this and clipped the same part to come post it on here

I do it every day

Let them soak in water for 30 minutes or so and damp off with a towel, good as new.

https://youtu.be/OArHLcw2Q6A iff cripled scape can do it then so can you. Do your ticks also work on your feet while you're playing? Iff no perhaps a foot paddel wich serves as a left click could help you. Are you able to surpress the ticks for a short while? Every wave can be paused this could help you too.
---
The potions are tradeable
---
I think they should make it a miniquest with hard/elite requirement.
---
This would make doing championships challenge a lot more attractive.
---
how do i delete someones post
---
Add a new POH at Prifddinas once you complete the quest.
---
Only Construction 75 is needed and allows you to have a crystal look to the portal as well. I believe this will only be allowed once you completed the quest and must offer 150k to purchase.
---
I'd be more than happy to see the level required raised up for it but I feel it's at the same level as the Prifddinas Agility Course as well.
---
Yeah but you can put in a lot of checks before it flags the player for review.  Like are they in the wilderness?  have they been logging in and out for over an hour straight, what is their total level, etc.  Lots of things you could put in place to really tell if it's a bot.  I am willing to bet there is no one out there who world hops nonstop for 10+ hours on a low level account in the wilderness.  Plus it would flag them to be reviewed and banned, not just an insta ban
---
And some blurite ore as well!
---
I love seeing people‚Äôs coif loots from beginner clues. My word is it a hit in the laugher ngl tbh hehe cba tbh xd
---
The entire set degrades and the whole set must be worn before the crystal bow comes close to challenging the blowpipe, one item. This will rapidly deplete crystal shards while the blowpipe is a great weapon that you can spend coins to recharge. 
---
Whatever happened to the crystal quiver or perhaps an empowered crystal weapon seed for the bow? Armor seems very average right now.
---
Thanks mate ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
man this is fucking disgusting, I'm calling the police
---
I don't know how you did it but this picture of your screen actually turned out really well
---
GE-Tracker is the best website out there for flipping and money making
---
*smash later virgins button*
---
It was polled in the main content blog several months ago, at 70 construction and 50k gp, and passed with like 94%.
---
Most of that made little to no sense.
---
from my experience majority of small time scammers (ppl in the GE doubling money on trading items for wrong values whatever) just don't take the game that seriously and its just funny that you can say some dumb stuff and a guy will give u free stuff and get mad at you for his mistake. 
---
Although I've never met a Scammer who pretends to be ur friend then fucks u but I honestly assume the people who fall for this are autistic as hell if they can't tell a guy is just fucking with them
---
It's not about the items or time put in to earn them. It's about the disrespect and immaturity required to do this to someone. I've had friends steal from me irl and I wasn't mad, just disappointed that said person valued our friendship so little to do that.
---
yeh this doesnt do much they are back on almost immediately anyway only the odd 1 would 100 different things out there
---
I mean it would just flag the account for review.  Then they could see "oh this player has done nothing but log in and our for over 100 hours in the past week and they aren't logged into any other account".  Let's be honest.  No human is doing that.  Also they could see if you had another account logged in at the same time or not to make sense why you were scouting
---
Dear im new to redit... This isn't Jus me..... I still saved the best for last.... in my defense this is my first time using redit... I literally had to watch a video on how to add tags in the stupid shit
---
The objective of runescape to alot of people is to have the best account or to just have alot of money to do things u care about
---
Lmao, this reminds me of the time back in the day when I played Habbo Hotel. I scammed some dude for a HC couch, then quickly gave it back because I was feeling so guilty.
---
RuneScape as a game is tedious in nature, lemme spend 160 hours clicking the same 3 things.
---
But I love it so.
---
I got kbd heads on my 2nd kbd kill the other day. My friend was so mad lol.
---
This should be far higher IMO, best suggestion I‚Äôve seen here. Hope Jagex sees it.
---
Your just w drew g fanboy
---
It's ok because of ardougne's politics. Drain the swamp!
---
God damn osrs players make the spiciest memes
---
Use the wiki quick guide. Very useful. Quadruple check your items before going out to minimize the amount of times you have to tele out.
---
Also, make sure get the 4 types of bones and 4 monkey talismans. THIS WILL MAKE THE MONKEY PORTION OF RECIPE FOR DISASTER MUCH EASIER.
---
Just because a person who got scammed has the brain capacity of a dog doesn't mean the scammers hate dogs lol
---
I wouldn‚Äôt. Considering that the sword would be a slash weapon and repier is many stab. Panic sell whips plox.
---
if i read the article correctly you can still brew as long as you dont brew below base stats (99) so if you brew at 118 you only go down to lvl 105 therfore you should still be renewed to 118

Nicotine gets absorbed through the skin so yes.
---
Back in those days kbd and kq were the hardest bosses. You could bring rune and be fine. These days rune armour isn't going to fly at raids or gwd. If you don't want to risk your full barrows armour or w/e high end gear, then you essentially can't go. It makes so much content inaccessible for everyone except the most hardcore players.
---
If it were like overloads I would vote no in a heartbeat but they don‚Äôt work well with brews so it really limits their usefulness. Probably should start aiming for 97 herb now
---
Form your own opinion lol

You'll need to log off at least 4/5 times a day, these are rookie numbers, gotta pump it up

Doesn't it put a big warning whenever you trade somebody who is offering nothing alerting you that it could easily be a scam
---
If I told a person I could DOUBLE HIS MONEY and he gives me $1000 and I walk away I wouldn't consider that theft its a person being incredibly stupid

yeah damage isnt there but he probably doesnt have to look for teams. he's popular enough to have resources for a good team whenever he wants
---
Thats amazing,  Core pet at 3kc

This one is supposedly okay, they brought in playtesters for it and they seem to like it. I imagine it'll have an extremely dedicated community of efficient speedrunners sort of like how Raids and Dungeoneering have them.

You just hate him cuz you aint him

Bruh if you get killed by that shit you gotta be AFK or DCed or some shit, its insanely easy to avoid.

Example received a drop: 101 x Zulrah's scales

Example received a drop: 1 x Fuck you

they are the same person

Yeah he's been around for at least 3 years (when I started osrs) probably longer lol.
---
He understands that. He made a video a few weeks back saying that he is going to start uploading other series to fill the gap.
---
From a year ago though, so imo that's not too bad.

This is what I do with my boys when I get crashed at Shamans, had 12 cannons out at once

Quest cape is usually a good starter goal with a mini goal of completing recipe for disaster quest

It‚Äôs cousin Tommy!!!

Pretty much this
---
Love the idea for the new quest, why not lock it behind fairy rings as well?
---
Big no to everything else.
---
The only reason that kills me anymore is if I look up from my computer/phone for a second, which Vork seems to know every time I do.
---
Cuz more money

Underrated comment
---
It isn't a requirement to pk. It's a requirement to get into rev caves.
---
I think it should be a mace/flail with bis crush bonus for 1 handed since we dont have any
---
Probably ban by mod skynet, would not be a surprise.
---
Inn\_Competence's advice for working towards a Dragon Scimitar by doing Monkey Madness is probably one of the best things you can work on for now.
---
In general, the best thing to work towards is getting BIS items for your character.  It makes it really simple to set goals so you can play the game without being lost. For example, when I first got membership last summer I set a goal to complete all the quests in the game, obviously, you don't need to do something enormous like that but usually, a single goal like that has a bunch of sub goals you need complete along the way.
---
So once you finish Monkey Madness another thing to look into is getting Fairy Rings unlocked and starting Recipe for Disaster so you can unlock the Barrows Gloves (the 2nd best in slot gloves in the game).
---
Deserves its own separate post
---
Got the same issue.
---
Literally cant even open any newspost on the website anymore since they started to translate half of the page to german and any newspost link ends up linking to a dead site. 
---
Just another classic Jagex project where someone has to look busy for a day so he pushes an update without QA and doesnt give a fuck that it is breaking the website.
---
They still havent fixed the bug where you cant even install the offical osrs client on a german pc without changing your date format from dd.mm.yyyy to dd/mm/yyyy. That shit has been broken for as long as I can remember and they literally have a 2 year old post on their offical forums by a mod on how to work around the bug.
---
Bruh i just remembered theres 2 attacks like that lol..that fuckin zombie baby
---
Zulrah is way more afk than vork...and less frustrating...and free deaths
---
Stop complaing about that nop rope lol
---
The exp rate doesn't seem that bad, but the Shards are pretty low. For what it is worth, there are 3 courses with better exp than Ardy in a similar level range so it isn't solely Ardy for 90-99. But the Elf Course does not seem to be as strong of a rival as it should be.
---
Why not both? Both are different and both are good. Vorkath is super consistent but zulrah it‚Äôs nice to see those juicy 3.8m drops sometimes and has the mutagens. Plus each one has a pet.
---
I hate morytania so much
---
Wow!
---
Fuck off with afk agility already, the whole reason I‚Äôm excited about the new course is because maybe I‚Äôll have to engage my brain.
---
The elf series currently has *seven* quests in it, none of them require or provide defence xp. In 2009, we saw another elf quest - within the light, also no def requirements. We didn't get plague's end until ~2014, but even then, still no def requirements/xp.
---
None of your comparisons are anywhere close to this (non-combat skill requirements are trivial anyways). Ultimately, complaining is irrelevant because Jagex was smart enough to see why placing FTP2 as a requirement was random and blocking this city from pures also doesn't achieve anything, especially considering that this quest doesn't actually seem to provide any useful combat content.
---
Agreed it shouldn't have the best exp compared to the other 3. But currently it does seem a bit lackluster. It is too closely an alternative to Ardy without offering many incentives, so little reason to use it over Ardy.
---
Hella gay, and yup het is weekend gap

Sleeping peacefully because no one wants to kill it since its drops are really bad relative to the effort involved.
---
what the fuck, jortplax?????
---
It happens with either fight. I've had fights where Vork did 5 attacks in a row of whatever I wasn't praying against.
---
Vork is better money and an easier fight. Downside is it's locked behind DS2 quest and boring (both the fight and the drops). Zulrah is more varied, fun, easier to access, and has several exciting 3-4mil drops. The difference in overall money from either boss after camping it for a while isn't enough of a difference to merit doing one over the other. Just do whichever fight you like.

It‚Äôs near impossible to die at vork if you‚Äôre looking at your screen. both are incredibly easy to avoid
---
not if you say 'no homo, btw' after you swallow.
---
Crystal enhancement seeds sounds tacky af, how about quartz seeds?
---
Just make them into socks and you could actually wear them
---
useless? How else are you gonna light a fire lol? with magic? are you gonna pray for a fire? build a fire using the contruction skill? firemaking is the only skill in the game that lets you build a fire. seems pretty well balanced to me.
---
There‚Äôs slow crush weapon (maul) and fast crush weapon (bludgeon) and fast slash weapon (whip) and slow slash weapon (godsword) and fast stab weapon (rapier) and no slow stab weapon. So maybe fill that niche?
---
i think vork is more money with the price of scales rn

I mean i dont do slayer much and i dont go outta my way to find skillers to pk but wouldnt it make more sense to just have ur cave outta wild?
---
It's better in WoW, because at least you need to be higher level to "wear" stuff that looks higher level.
---
It's okay for higher levels to transmog into lower level gear imo, especially since a lot of lower level gear looks aesthetically pleasing, but a Lv. 1 wearing gear that makes them look like a lv 100 is a bit over the top. Same applies to runescape.
---
It technically works that way in Runescape too, since you need to be able to equip a piece of gear before you can keepsake it, but the problem is that they added so many cosmetic sets that have zero reqs, even a lv 3 skiller can wear them. They should have had level requirements to the bulky armour sets, and they could still keep the more casual stuff requirements-less for lower levels.
---
&gt; Bruh i just remembered theres 2 attacks like that lol..that fuckin zombie baby
---
Getting hit with that isnt a 1 hit though, ive tanked it many times the few times ive misclicked it, only hits a 50-60 most of the time.
---
I dunno how Zulrah is less frustrating though when Vork is significantly easier and the only things that can possibly kill you (acid phase, zombie baby, and big red fire ball) are super easy to avoid as long as you have a working brain and eyes. Zulrah only gets less frustrating when you become really pro at it and can do all phases super fast and efficiently without even thinking and even then, youre probably going to take more damage than Vork depending on RNG.
---
&gt; Stop complaing about that nop rope lo
---
??????
---
I also kill Vork pretty afk, I easily train another acc while doing Vork at this point with over 4k KC. Its also consistently more profitable most of the time, unless youre doing Zulrah max efficiency with max stats and max gear and are really good at Zulrah and even then it will be at max near on par with Vork GP/hr and with bad unique RNG Vork will be clearly better.
---
Still waiting for a response from most of the jmods. ü¶Ä
---
They weren't lying when they said this sub has the best content
---
I don‚Äôt have an issue with the armor set requirement, I like expanding the range armour pool to more than just arma and void and I like that it‚Äôll keep the content in prif alive for a while through the shard requirement. However, the bow as suggested is garbage. I ran some numbers with the dps calculator and even with the set boost it‚Äôs worse than msb with amethyst arrows for basically all content. 
---
With 99 range/pot/eagle eye vs msb and archers/anguish/assembler but only black D‚Äôhide, msb has like 5% more dps vs crabs and crystal bow only gets better at very high defense levels (msb even wins vs black demons). Of course, the difference is even more pronounced when it‚Äôs msb with arma or void. Why is it such high requirements and time investment if it costs more per hour (108K after getting crystal bow down to the lowest price vs 81K) AND has worse dps than a 50 range weapon that costs 2K. The damage bonus of the set should definitely be higher.
---
It would hold charges to extend the length of how long you could use the crystal bow. But if it ran out of charges, it would still give range str.

Zulrah is super afk with tbow

From 52 to 70 is about 600k, and the wiki estimates around 25k/hour. Therefore to MLM until level 70 is going to take me around 24 hours. An entire fucking day of mind numbing afk shit to get something that's completely worthless 
---
I wouldn't call that grind "hard" because it's just clicking on an ore vein every few seconds, but I also wouldn't call it "easy to get" when it's gonna take a goddamn eternity to get. Plus 70 mining is COMPLETELY useless outside of quests and diaries. Nothing enjoyable about it whatsoever

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which have never seen before in Gilenor, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me in W29 GE? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of scouts across the servers and your location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your main. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be in any world, anytime, and I can PK you in over 700 different ways, and that's just with a bronze dagger. Not only am I extensively trained in pvp combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the God Wars Dungeon and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the wilderness, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy skull your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking enter button. But you couldn‚Äôt you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit vengeance all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, bwana.

This means for a vast majority of bosses, you will maintain a 118/112 (melee/range) boost for 5 minutes. IMO, that is very strong. However, I do think it can be balanced. 
---
**Perhaps Divine potions could be made into 2 doses, so you would choose either having a topped off bonus for 5 minutes but having an overall shorter boost, versus 20 minutes (assuming you repot every 5 min with super combats) per potion for the tradeoff of lower dps**.

Yeah that‚Äôs pretty beast loot for that chest count. I am jealous of those rangers also. (50 meds and no luck so far)

Why you reposting your own shit dude?

Degrades super fast and you have to work for shards yourself. On top of getting it as a super rare drop.

You can skip that one cutscene right it gives you a yes no I thinn

Solo cox is harder to learn.

I personally like tob more. It's more fun and better money.

If you get bored of one you can always do the other though :p

I get 8 kills per trip with the plug in, it‚Äôs not cheating

Ye

I strongly suggest 70 range to at least be able to use black d hide, blessed preferably. Also whats your defense? Youre going to want to use some sort of tank gear, typically its tank helm/legs with d hide body or karils top BiS (range/mage def). 
---
My first cape i was only 45 pray with 60 def. Use an archers helm and tank legs if i was you. Also figure out your inventory, if you find youre not using many brews then swap out several for restores or ppots. 
---
Also, purple sweets. This saved me while i was still doing my Rcb attempts with diamond e bolts before 75 range and i almost killed jad 2x but i made mistakes on prayer. (Then i just got 75 range since i lvld to 73 anyway from my 3-4 attempts). Purp sweets though allows you to bring way more super restores. Instead of brewing just wait til you got one mob trapped and not attacking you near end of a wave and just eat up with sweets. This can be a little expensive though. 
---
To be honest your range is quite low. 70 is typically the minimum unless you've done it before several times and can flick efficiently. At 75 range my first cape i got I finished with like 4 full brews and 4-5 full restores. So i had plenty room to spare. If you have the money for it, just get BP. However if youre set on not doing that, get 70 at least. Bp is almost 2x faster than using rcb man. And this was me using diamond bolt E all the way - and addy darts with bp.
---
Use body trapping to your advantage. However you havent gotten to the round where all 3 spawn yet i dont think even. When all 3 spawn you want to kill the ranger first (as always you should) and then if you can trap the melee behind the mage, kill the mage then just trap the melee to save prayer.
---
# hi me cool
---
Yeah boaty is ripped this guy is one of those cornball ultra-skinny dudes who always talks about how he wishes he could gain weight but then all he eats is white rice and water
---
Nice stast
---
Fair enough, my suggestion is to have the armor focus on mobility instead of defense. For example, the range armor would not increase the damage of the crystal bow, but would increase the accuracy and attack speed. The melee armor would do the same for the hally and sword if it passes, and the magic armor would give bonuses kinda like the void mage, but would also allow each spell to "take" run energy (only in pvm, that would be super op in pvp). Additionally all 3 sets would not only have no weight, but a minor weight reduction.

Would a demonbane effect make much sense as an added bonus for the crystal bow when wearing the set? Right now see only have arclight for melee. Not sure if it‚Äôd make sense lorewise.
---
That‚Äôs exactly my point?
---
I'll take three
---
Damn, I'm jealous
---
You're not making your mother very proud right now
---
Thank you for the new background
---
Not really. Ranged already does have Demonbane with Holy Water; it is just terrible. Crystal has no known connection to demons or holy water so it would feel a bit out of place.
---
Yeah everyone knows we‚Äôve only been around for about 3000 years
---
It definitely would fuck them over. If they have to bot 50 Slayer they're giving Jiggleflex a lot of time to ban them.  
---
Even if they use Venezuelan laborers it'll put a big dent in their profits.
---
Ur a ironman, you can't sell them :^)
---
Shouldn't be needed either. May be useful to learn regardless if you're going for inferno one day since you need to flick (1 tick or lazy) the magers too (and those can hit 70)
---
I nonstop farmed all sunday last week. Never stopped going from patch to patch. Just afk'd a bit between each one. 500k+ xp from snape and torstols. insane.

All your luck points are building up at a different boss.

I 100% stand by this, I mentioned something similar when the 99 cape hoodie idea pops up every now and then, They can treat it the way Bungie does with destiny, If you complete a certain task you get a code where you can go on their store and buy a specific shirt, or badge to have IRL but only if you do it in game.
---
I can kill Vork but I struggle to do Zulrah at all. I only have 1 KC at Zulrah for the diary/elite void and I died many times trying to get it and like 700 something at Vork. I eventually want to learn Zulrah though because Magma serp helm looks amazing compared to booger green or tanz imo.
---
why would you give money to E-beggars
---
There is a runelite feature that lets you hide certain attack style options and will warn you if an unwanted style is selected, if thats the only thing stopping you. You just have to do a bit of research on which quests you can or can't do and plan ahead. The new attack style remembering update helps a lot now, too. Well, it does now that it doesn't actually ruin accounts anymore.

If you're familiar with Adobe products, I personally prefer Premiere. Pretty intuitive and easy to pick up. I think they're still doing the Creative Cloud system where you pay a monthly fee to use a fairly large suite of products (Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, etc), so if you decide you aren't into it after a month or two, I think you should save some money over Vegas. I don't know prices that well, though, so please double check.

&gt; They have methods of tracking players but the servers don't use these because they don't need them.

The server, where game interactions occur, doesnt need any kind of permanent id to manage the interactions. There are permanent IDs in use that allow for player tracking across various DBs the game uses. The game servers have never needed access to them and have never been reworked to use them.

Archers ring is cheap enough its worth doing before rigour. Elite void not as important though.
---
If i were you i would prioritize archers ring, imbue it then maybe look towards chinning more ranged levels out. I would argue its worth spending what you have now to farm vorkath faster. Id bet that range level is the biggest thing your lacking for multi kill trips.  If it were me, id probly chin to like 97 then do vorkath until rigour. Elite void optional after that

Nooo this is so bad for you

Op doesn't realize the irony of his complaint, because he just latched on to one of the suggestions,  not the main idea (which was to limit scouting bots in  rev caves)

That's a nice way to remember what it means in the context of gaming, I guess, but that's not the meaning of *meta*, that's just a backronym.

How so?t Because they have 8 elven clans, most of which was already established in lore? Because they both expand Crystal equipment? The similarities are mostly surface level and some aren't even that far. The only thing in the new Dev Blog that feels even remotely similar to RS3 are the Divine Potions, but they are nothing like RS3's Combination Potions; they are just a different type of potion we learn from the potion clan. I suppose the Crystal Impling is also an RS3 thing, even if its purpose differs in OSRS. But aside from those, there really isn't much.
---
There are no serenity posts, harps, seren stones, resource dungeons, harmony pillars, waterfall fishing, max guild, voice of seren, GE, or any of the other notable features of RS3 Prif. And the majority of what is in the Dev Blog are things the community asked for.
