I really like the idea of a magic whirlpool

---
Absolute trog you are m8.
---
A belief and an assertion are two different things. 
---

---
Your reasoning isn't that everyone dies on their main isn't an axiom. 
---
You don't see the point in planning and prayer flicking? Those are the only two aspects of the game that any skill or thought goes into at all, outside of pvp. You not personally liking or enjoying a way of doing something isn't the same as not seeing the point. And if you truly don't see the point, that speaks to your intelligence...

Conquest was fun but I remember solving it in like a couple days

Its not crazy to think Jagex has offered him a job and he turned it down, its happened before
---
Why did you switch arguments 3 times?
---
The gate is members-only, so why don't we just teleport **past** the gate? Genious
---
&gt;Anyone can make a picture of a new menu
---
Although I agree with your point, I would like to point out that it takes some serious graphic design skills to create maps with the quality that GentleTractor does. Visually, they look straight out of the in-game world map.
---
You're very condescending and you offered no evidence to the contrary of OP's suggestion.
---
nah dude. jabex removed serp helm for defense pures and pretty much ruined every single one of those accounts without even polling their decision. they clearly don't want defense pures to be offensive. so instead they should allow them to be more defensive.
---
So, you mean us in illegal states?
---
I want to know too. Asking for a friend.
---
Ah for that I’m not sure, I’ve never used a blowpipe for hydra. I assume it would be sorta random, since one of the poison splats is where you stand and the others are randomly near it, right? So if you’re moving while shooting bp you might end up running through it. Might have to just miss 1-2 hits to get into position
---
Watch sirpuggers video from a couple days ago where he addresses this exactly
---
Darn
---
8 is unload
---
Oh dang haha I never made a main on this game mode since I knew how I'd end up playing knowing what past me did when those options were on the table (GE, staking, etc.). Felt like ironman is more core to the game's intentions and indeed it's felt that way since the start.
---
And yeah sure I'll hit you up sometime soon! I don't like to post my RSN publicly (mostly future-proofing in case I post some interesting drop and someone is able to track my name to this comment). Feel free to PM me and I'll send you my RSN! Or if you have private messages set to All (I doubt it though) I can just PM you in-game.
---
Being a stat that only boosts dps after 80 is fine.
---
I like to do them for extra hespori seeds. I look at them as a little bonus for getting xp (or pet chances) anyways
---
Nope that's correct.
---
It's like that to deal with the notch of some phones.
---
Should it really grant thieving xp, then? It's just a free fruit display now.

No, he doesn't just draw pictures. He also does extremely comprehensive gameplay analyses: https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ap8cv2/the_drop_table_problem_analysing_gameplay_design/

They don’t ban for buying unless your buying hundreds of mills. It  is a mtx just not sponsored by the developer, and yea probably not the safest thing to do.

I think we've all been there. Not literally though because why would I go outside? But in all seriousness though, I've been on that grind trying to find something to make me rich too. I honestly don't do anything for cash right now, I actually just screw around mostly and afk stuff while watching TV shows or movies on my other monitor. I probably should be more interactive but I dunno. If you ever need some $$ though I don't mind helping out, my bank is only worth like 10.5mil lmao but still I am always willing to help people out since folks have helped me out since I started back.
---
Yeah. Which order is best. Im not asking if you are visual learners or not lol
---
Yeah definitely.
---
I actually don't have a main on OSRS because I knew that if I made one, I'd just end up doing what I did in the past (GE, trading, flipping, staking). Ironman mode seems more core to what the game's intentions are, and indeed it's felt that way since the start. Seems like mainscape these days just relies on PVMing for enough money to get gear and then buy a bunch of 99s, which is exactly what people did/do in RS2/RS3.
---
And great, yeah I would love to talk more! I don't like to post my RSN publicly (mostly future-proofing in case I later post some exciting drop and someone is able to track my name to this comment), but if you PM me we can exchange info. Or if you have your private messages setting in-game set to All (though I doubt it), I can just message you there.

It is but I'm in California, I only ever heard people say it like "Oshkosh Bgosh Oh My Gosh!" as like a funny saying. I never knew it was an actual place until now.
---
Still a noob unfortunately
---
huh, I could see that. However, this phone doesn't have a notch? Maybe just an oversight on Jagex's part for the new series of phones
---
Brilliant show, you crazy son of a bitch.
---
Well, I'm in California and the closest one is at a Mall so no Air Shows there lmao. Especially in the town it's in - it's got one of the highest crime rates in all of Central Valley lmao.
---
Not working until after updates has kept me from getting myself banned. I know me and I would've sold those tbows.
---
I never realized that this wasn't just a really fat raccoon.
---
Are you talking about the store lmao?
---
TTG has gotten significantly better since the initial episodes. Total dramarama is the current hot garbage.
---
Bro..lol..first off, if you buy any amount of gold or an item you can be banned. The difference is its harder to detect real world trading if its a small amount. Secondly, real world trading is not a form of microtransactions..at all..mtx means that the game itself sells in game items/gold/etc. You can RWT in any game that has player to player trading, that is not the same as mtx/its not a form of mtx.
---
There was no gp doubler 14 year ago, only armor trimmer.
---
he merches bulk items. He buys limits in g.e, and re sells them for insane profits. I.E he buys blood runes, cannonballs, dart tips, feathers, etc. &amp; resells them to skillers/players. Having 10 accounts buying the limits helps him a lot with that as well.
---
Agreed.

After zuk get enraged, you need to follow the shield and not the marks anymore

We're you in zeah? People got moved cause of the update

Yeah thanks for the info. EZ money
---
What I'd do for money making
---
- Wintertodt can net you some good money and levels in woodcutting, firemaking, construction, and fletching,.
---
-Surprisingly easy clue scrolls if your lucky and get any team capes (I usually kill Minotaurs in stronghold of security and keep a beginner clue so you just get easy clue) it trains combat.
---
-Barrows (get iban's staff and upgrade it, use the wiki to figure it out) and watch some vids on barrows strats it trains combat.
---
-Doing Varrock diaries will let you discount battle staff and sell them on the GE
---
-Herb runs watch vids on how to do them
---
-As you play and learn you come up with you own money makers, lucky you have capital to back up your endeavors
---
WHOOOOOSH

Ma paint? Is that the mother of Ms Paint? Does that make Photoshop the more succesful brother who moved out of the house at 18 and had a mansion and a family by age 23? And who is the father? So many questions!
---
It would be cool to be able to use a tree root on tangleroot to change its colour, gives unused content something, while not breaking it.
---
its a meme you dip
---
Perhaps, but the fact that it moves a few times seems unlikley
---
How is that even possible with the melee stats? You can't guarantee that you'll get the exact right amount of xp.
---
On mobile how do I withdraw my bond from my bond puch?
---
antivenom + serp helm = not even effective
---
u right wingers will never win
---
r/nocontext
---
Now HD :D
---
wouldnt prevent chaos ele from attacking him tho
---
I think the reason all of Zeah is so scaled up is because they planned it with the intent to shove loads of content in it over time, rather than getting stuck with not enough room had they intially made Zeah small. So if in the future they kept adding things to fill it out more the whole area could look fine as is, but thatd take many years of constant updates.
---
I'm going for a ZGS for master clues, and I have the other 3/4 Kril items. I might be in the minority though. I did get all the arma armour with no hilt, so I got rid of aviansie tasks.
---
Something something you limit your self something something.
---
To the spot i'm talking about being a problem, unless my map isnt updating
---
my account now yoink!
---
Looks like you forgot to git gud m8
---
not sure if you're aware but not everyone has those in the wilderness, and bosses do not have the ability to wear serp helms and drink anti venoms 
---
Be quiet
---
Even if you worked on average 40 hours a week ( which I do ) I have about 1.5-2hrs of travel time a day. By the time I get home I have roughly 5 hours left in the day before I go to bed. 
---
If you want to cook for yourself, workout, take care of any chores you have... maybe go out somewhere. That really doesn't leave you much time left in the day to play runescape, AND even if people did have enough time that doesn't mean they want to spend it all on runescape.
---
Zgs may not have been the best example but you get the picture. There are some gwd items that are largely pointless to purposefully seek out
---
wtf leave my bots alone
---
Suqahs are super good tasks for xp, their drops just suck
---
It's still not funny with the volume on, don't waste your time
---
ZGS is a master clue item, so its worth going for if you're an avid clue hunter IMO.
---
Castle wars minigame teleport is really close to bank and always there on every character. Check haveibeenpwned.com and see if your info is on there. I think it's likely you are getting logged in on by a script that tries a bunch of email/pw combos from a data leak and checks bank for wealth. Def change your password and secure your email regardless just incase.
---
**Holy shit** I didn't even realise that you could fairy ring tele to your PoH (code DIQ for anyone reading). I'm on the Quest Cape grind atm for just the fun of it and I didn't even realize this perk.

Very true. I have all the arma armour and no hilt, but I got rid of aviansie tasks after getting the last armour piece.
---
so good that it had to become my background
---
You don’t need arclite or bgs specs if you are doing trio. You’ll use more food, but Kills will be faster.
---
Two or three raccoons 😁
---
It's technically more efficient to get all the roles to 5, then get torso, I believe. Since you'll be needing higher levels anyways for the diaries. That said, most people just do enough to get the torso without leveling any roles. 
---
Maybe do BA and if you like it, upgrade the roles, otherwise just get torso asap.
---
done ran out of inches m8 dw next time
---
Wow dude congratulations

Bro. Mtx is real world trading. I feel like I’m trying to define the English language here. They Are the same thing.

---
When using spices to get level boosts, if you get a -5 decrease, if the next spice you eat is a +5, would you be nullifying the -5 from the first one or do you get the +5 normally?
---
For example:
---
75 runecrafting, eat spicy stew, becomes 70. Eat spicy stew, become 75 or become 80?
---
For a low cost zulrah set up finish elite void range and mage then buy an occult, suffering, upgrade to trident of the swamp, then mages book or book of darkness
---
can we sit in the chairs tho?
---
Do u need cannon and still use spears after? Thanks for the advice
---
What’s new?
---
My thinking is that he may be barely paying for his bills by farming OSRS gold now but when the game dies or changes drastically indirectly by his hand then he's screwed. 
---
I doubt his cousin has a Plan B if OSRS stops being viable for him to make cash.
---
I liked the quest that came with soul wars too! That nomad boss fight was pretty fun
---
he's ordinary
---
We are all 99 in melee
---
Piscarillius definitely needs a rework. The art looks good but the layout is terrible. The houses are still too big and they are extremely uniform. There is no notable town center to center everything on so its just a bunch of identical houses.
---
he does it in different worlds
---
this makes me feel uncomfortable
---
It would put you back to 75 if you get another +5. Make sure to restore your stats before using another stew.
---
Surely wasnt the same kill though?
---
I hate quests. 
---
But I love barrows gloves. 
---
It's difficult being me.
---
top right of his screen says 55 is the lowest and its 58 combat, no issue there.
---
I've got the same one and really like it. I miss my razer deathadders but they always develop a double click after a while
---
upvoted because curious as fuck lmao  
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
Probability is involved in this? Surely it's a certainty. Woman or man, this picture is too spicy.
---
I should fucking kill myself for lack of reading comprehension. Sorry to have wasted your time.
---
I only ever put cannon down to show ppl the world is taken. Dancing the core is fun. Dump chall specs and then go back to using spear.

The designers want an alternative to it because they don't like its effect on the game, but the parent company still demands a certain amount of income per month. So far they haven't been able to come up with anything
---
No that’s actually pretty shit considering it’s used for post-99 training. The average player does not give a fuck about doing that.

How was that not worth the risk? He killed it and waited a second then tabbed. Spent that whole time to get the kill only to not change to prot mage and wait another second? Should have tabbed sooner then.
---
Ayy saw this earlier, nice find
---
I saw them today too, it’s like 99’s awaiting or something like that, pretty crazy account. He was just dancing with them in GE
---
I'm seeing this misspelling more lately, which tells me it'll be a commonly accepted way of spelling genius in 5-10 years.

So many skills that high-level have no uses. Why point out this one?
---
Tears of guthix gives xp to your lowest stat. So, after one run, given that you get rc xp the first time, you're guaranteed to get either construction or hunter xp next.

People can do inferno in less than 2 hours so that's 125m + an hour if you value the cape at 250m

He should be there as that's how you start client of kourend quest. About 10 steps south of pub door, not near the monks.

Oh wow, yeah good call bro. Don’t train slayer til the weekend it’s not worth losing 2/32 of your 8k ppot.

---
Looking for guidance on some money making tips. 
---
81 range, 49 def, 47 prayer, 63 slayer and 71 HP. Kind of in a rut right now. Needing some extra cash to pay for a bond and supplies. Not really sure what I should be doing to get money. I’m continuing to do slayer as I’ve heard from many that the money gets good at lvl 70. Just kind of gets repetitive and lose motivation to train slayer. Any other monsters I could throw in with slayer to mix things up and make some money?
---
Can you not steal from the fruit stalls freely anymore?
---
Fat distributes all over your body.. Seeing as he started at 140lbs and only went up 13lbs do you really think you were going to notice some extra visible fat?
---
He still has some way to go before fat gain will even become somewhat noticable as he started at a very lean state
---
Incredibly creepy and unattractive video and for that i have appreciation

500 worlds are where the game truly begins. Freedom from (as many) bots is amazing, but still has social aspects that 750 worlds tend to lack.
---
Imagine losing hardcore status but still having HC in your name 😃😃
---
Depends on your region I guess. CN South East Asia plays a mix of the new and old(Chowder, Courage , and Billy and Mandy are being rerunned atm), Teen Titans Go doesn't get ran that much here compared to when I look up what CN America runs a couple of years back.... Teen Titans Go for half the day lmao.
---
There is separate attack options for players and npcs, it sounds like you're not a pker so you can just leave the player attack options off permanently then you never need to remember
---
I did on my iron for some beginner blues. Good times were had.
---
Alright this one's going in my toolbelt for later use
---
= D i'm best man
---
BTW (no incase you were serious lmao)
---
Was going through the Bestiary wiki and noticed lots of missing monsters and wrong info.  Went through and updated, today all my changes have been reverted.  Are there some special guidelines I need to follow?
---
Hmm something's fucky
---
you should buy members before pretty much anything else.
---
then do some low level money making (should make you more than anything on f2p regardless of levels), then do loads of quests.
---
quests are basically the fastest xp for a lot of skills you can get early levels. you can spend like 10 hours grinding 40 attack or you can spend an hour doing 2 quests and have 38? attack. 
---
plus they open up doors to do more things, so you may aswell reap the rewards early. it also means you aren't grinding much. 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide
---
following that gets you to like base 50-60 with barely any grind. also means you can do a bunch of extra stuff, plus you'll get to explore and see the world, get teleports to make it quicker to get around etc.
---
That's what they cost as of now and there is less demand seeing as it's not in ge for pet chances
---
If you're being attacked you will stay logged in for the full 6 hours but after 5 minutes you stop attacking if no autoretaliate, after 20mins you stop attacking if you do have it on.
---
Get Magic to 37 for teleports and for God's sake train some range it's the best combat skill! I'll see ya on the 750 world soon my dude
---
Ahh this sucks. Oh well. Anything fun to do with a fake log? Other than teleporting to v square 325 on a hcim :)
---
*kill
---
But UIM can't trade...
---
Am I the only one who saw the subtext in the image
---
I get what hes saying, but what im trying to say is that RWT is *not the same* as microtransactions. Like i understand his point completely. But real world trading means that you are buying/selling items or currency via other players in the game, not buying them from the game/company itself. THAT is what im trying to get across. Mtx = items/currency you can buy via the game itself, RWT = items/currency you buy via other players on the black market. The 2 are "similar" in that you are buying currency, I get that. I'm just saying that they are still 2 different things.
---
u cant attack shit while fake logged anymore
---
You should not eat your own crops...
---
I feel like this was me lol. Was doing the quest earlier
---
i will kill myself and it will be your fault
---
You can tell she's  a braindead PvMer due to her wearing the helmet backwards.
---
Sara Sword is basically a whip but 2h. It's not bad.
---
Buy dragon boots. They give a better strength bonus than rune boots.
---
Get a fighter torso, obsidian legs, helm of neitz, barrows gloves
---
You can sell that rune kite. It won't be useful anywhere if you have a dragon defender.
---
Some men are pure success
---
Dope
---
Yeah it's really good man, it feels a lot nicer and more natural than the older version. I'm happy we have people like you working at Jamflex!
---
RuneLite has a plug in for it now. It gives you 3 options, the D scim, Dragon dagger and the RS3 cursor
---
Nah would be a good new magic training method like wintertodt awesome rewards 👌Hosidius just got a huge update and only a few people are there that's more dead content then FoG 😆
---
But is the Sara sword worth using if I can’t equip my defender at the same time?

It can train strength, so yes. It's a bit better than d scim + d defender. I think an abby dagger or full obby, b necklace, and obby sword would be better strength training but will be more expensive.
---
Yes but an abyssal whip and dragon defender will always be better unless trying to train strength alone.
---
Or an abyssal dagger instead of Sara sword, but agreed with everything else.
---
I imagine him being sentient but out of control of what he does. Trapped in a videogame, much like that Black Mirror episode.
---
That's perfectly fine. Way more than you'd actually need.
---
I have the Ryzen 5 1600 in my PC and it runs OSRS perfectly. Used to have the Ryzen 5 1400.
---
You could get away with a moderately priced quad core CPU based PC and be fine. Hell even a dual core would be fine.
---
When Runescape was originally released it was designed to run on mostly single core processors maybe dual cores at most. But then again Runescape was played through a browser.. and on dial up internet.
---
That's about 7m over OPs budget

What school do you go to? I’m starting this fall!

I constantly get accused of being a bot and players know my levels without me telling them. I mainly farm Dust Devil's or do slayer tasks. I have 36 quest points if that matters at all?
---
He teleported to dodge a range attack that could've killed him dude.
---
Ahh true. Maybe monkey madness for d scim?
---
Hide Roofs is on, why does he have one?
---
Sara sword is better than d scim + d defender, but it is more expensive. The money may be better spent elsewhere.
---
you were 2 steps ahead when it registered that you were hit by the attack.  When he is enraged you have to basically stick with the shield at all times and time your attacks
---
a lot of slayer creatures need different items, a slayer helm just combines most of them into one easy slot, but you absolutely can start slayer ASAP
---
So you logged into your bot account and posted this in order to remove suspicion on that account 🤔 very clever
---
You get accused of being a bot because it looks like you've never done anything outside of melee slayer
---
I agree they should be added and untradeable. I always enjoyed high level stats giving you bonuses instead of a worthless cape.
---
Your comment is worded so that people who think getting your own shit is the right way and people being able to buy stuff off the GE is the right way so you're probably getting upvoted by people who think both ways which is very misleading.
---
Not true. I'm the server mechanic and he always stays there during resets.
---
Yes
---
Not even a glitch... after you spawn one, stop walking through doors and this won’t happen.
---
I use a Logitech g403. I tried the g502 but it was just too big and uncomfortable in my smallish hands, plus all the extra buttons were in awkward to reach locations for me. Also tried the g203 but it was too small to palm grip (which I found I needed for long gaming sessions), the buttons weren't tensioned properly so I kept accidentally clicking, and the switches seemed cheap and started failing within a week.
---
The g403 was the first mouse I used that really let me do quick gear switches, since the buttons are super easy and light to press as they're separated from the body of the mouse, while still tensioned enough to eliminate accidental clicks. More importantly, they depress very quickly, so it helped me cut out most of the accidental clickdrags I used to have when switching. It only has 2 side buttons and a programmable dpi button, but the side buttons are massive and super easy to click, and I have them bound to esc and spacebar for skilling and quickly closing the bank. It's the only gaming mouse I've tried so far that doesn't leave my hand aching after extended use, but the ergonomics might vary from person to person.
---
I'd absolutely recommend a gaming mouse as opposed to the standard office mouse. You'll want to make sure it has a good optical sensor with little to no acceleration, as this will help get your switches and mouse flicks into muscle memory. You may have to shop around a lot like I did to find the mouse that fits your hand, and you also might have to work on adjusting your grip to keep your hand comfortable for long sessions. I personally had to learn to loosen and relax my grip and only do a claw grip when I needed to aim quickly and precisely (like tagging the undead spawn at vorkath or switching prayers). Good luck finding a mouse, and don't be afraid to try and return a few before finding the one that feels right.

🦀🦀$11 debt tho🦀🦀

I’d love to, but I don’t have enough points at the moment... I was distracted and accidentally blocked an iron dragons task instead of skipping it.   I just recently started slayer so that cost me almost all of my points haha...  I’m bad at things.
---
🦀🦀gotta keep that shit hidden🦀🦀
---
Where are my armadyl brethren?
---
As a  maxed player I dislike the idea of having to level up herblore to have the best PVM potions. It doesn't matter what you think but the PVM clans are going to make it a requirement and rightfully so.
---
Sure...
---
My favorite place to PvM is in the wilderness (not slayer) because I love  risk vs reward... though I think the reward is lacking compared to what it should be in some non-revenant areas.
---
Chaos druids can be some decent money

If you have a coal bag and ice gloves you can make some steel bars in blast furnace

When’s the wedding??
---
Let me guess he's getting married and you're in love with him
---
Oof we’ll see how miserable I am with bolts then work my way up.   I’m not a fan of them, but I just recently started slayer and I messed up and spent points blocking instead of skipping an iron dragon’s task so I’m nearly out of points.  I’ll suffer through this one and see where I’m at I suppose haha
---
Yeah, there's a store in a town near me at a Mall. I never knew until I looked it up and it showed up on my Google search. I don't go to that Mall due to how far it is and the fact that there's no reason to go so that's why I never knew.
---
Why is rainbow road from Mario Kart not on this list?
---
Haha I see. Iron dragons also suck I still have them blocked at 94 slayer. You could safepot black demons in the catacombs. Rune crossbow with broad bolts would be fine it will just take a while lol.
---
Lol
---
He forgot his d spear
---
Well I’m glad to know that I made a good mistake at least  haha You’d suggest the catacombs over the chasm of fire?
---
Probably one of the best updates I've seen regarding cleaning up existing content.. In awe of the detail put into making Hosidius feel alive. The architecture looks beautiful and the addition of unique town guards is wonderful. So much better, honestly one of the most visually pleasing places in game right now. Now do it to the other houses please :) This is what Zeah was meant to be. 
---
Now do it to the other houses.
---
Broad bolts/amethyst broad bolt is good enuff.
---
Kill some green dragons
---
that would be altar ego
---
Awesome, thanks a ton!
---
I hear its like a bond, there's a use on option that requires gp cost of 10% gf value
---
i love the update too.. the only thing i ask, is a few more men/women/children in the town square market as its empty, but thats all. otherwise, its perfect! :)
---
stayin true to number 2
---
Yeah if you're not going to be cannoning the catacombs are better. You can get shards for ArcLight and totem pieces to kill skotizo.
---
All that time getting B2P wasn't wasted!
---
Haha cracked me up. Gratz on pet!
---
If you using Runelite, it has a gorilla plugin so you don't have to think very hard. Definitely not afk though, you have to swap prayer and combat style really often.

How do you know it's 17 years? I didn't play back then so I can't confirm myself.

Druidic Ritual gets you Herblore, Recipe for Disaster gets you metal gloves, Death Plateau gives you climbing boots, Fairytale 1 gives you a bunch of farming exp, starting Fairytale 2 lets you use the fairy rings to teleport around quickly. Like-wise with tree gnome village letting you use spirit trees. Completing the natural history quiz in the Varrock museum gives you a nice boost for hunter.

Attack is accuracy. If all of your targets have non-existent defense, of course the skill has minimal impact. Since the combat formula and combat effectiveness aren't in direct parity and both attack and defense give more combat levels than they provide in KO potential, they are of lesser priority to train if you want to keep your combat level down. 
---
But, you're thinking about this in terms of combat levels because you can only fight within your combat bracket. You're literally only looking at PvP.
---
If you examine literally any case of PvM, in which combat level is irrelevant, then having more attack and defense is literally only a positive. The difference between 75 and 99 attack is roughly 20% more accuracy vs a target like General Graador, which is hardly "no benefit."

Old school didn't exist in 2010. It's a new game based on an old version, and nothing is supposed to transfer over.

This is sort of the weird thing with national laws and the internet. Take the EU for example. Article 13 only has  legal authority inside EU borders do companys *could* choose to simply not conform and just pull their business out. But the EU is such a significant consumer block that doing that would be nearly professional suicide for any company that chose to make that decision. If the US passed this law and Jagex didn't want to conform then they'd have to pull support from America, which would include taking subscriptions from Americans and hosting American servers. That would be the death of Jagex.

Just cannon them with prayer pot and mink robes. Should get one mysterious emblem which will cover all the cost for a quick task

i think teaks are better

Is this in reference to his original post and my reply to it? Cos I can explain my point of view of why he's narrow minded right here:
---
"Seen this guy before in the ge, all he does it have his alts follow each other around his main using sleep and acts like he's super cool for when noobs come up to him and ask him what he's doing, like you paids $88 to sit in the ge all day and show off 5o random noobs that you know how to use nmz. When the barb assault guy is more impressive than this."
---
- All I do is have my alts follow each other around my main while my main does the sleep emote, acting cool when noobs ask me what im doing, and I pay $88/mo to sit at ge all day
---
1. Have my alts stopped progressing then? Because they haven't ever. So all I do can't be sitting at the he then can it?
---
2. "Acting cool" got no idea or examples, but this is exactly what I would say to defend myself right? 
---
3. 12 month premier on all, there's no way I would pay 88/mo when I can pay 420/year
---
4. As somebody else pointed out you don't get prayer at nmz, to this I could add they have 97qp which isn't a lot but it's a few hours, and the 69 wc I did while f2p long ago.
---
5. The barn assault guy he mentions is just another way to prove he's simply being salty in general, this Barb assault guy is a person that has 8 alts with the BA pet, from what I hear he's "hated in the BA community" this is just a tool for him to use to further try to belittle me in his reply, as many others try to do lol.
---
As for why I bother replying and explaining this: I love replying to morons like this, as someone else has commented here they've seen me arguing for hours at the G.E with people, I wouldn't be doing that if I didn't want to. Stupidity is fun to argue with and I've made a few people realize when they're often being hypocritical in their insults.

I was having the same problem, try clicking the floor directly under your character before  casting crumble undead on the spawn. That seemed to stop it for me

I like how all of you talk like I bought my gp, I'm 1733 skill total, 95 range, 93 hp, all qp, 195 clue scrolls done, and I'm worth only like 56m now, down from like 60m 2 days ago. I am 88 slayer. 
---
How the FUCK are you all getting soo much shit? 90% of my tasks I lose on because of prayer pots, unless I want to make the task 100x longer to make 180k an hour. 
---
Like seriously, are you all buying these god swords and shit? You guys say it like its NORMAL for a person at this stage to be worth millions, I literally pick up every piece of fucking junk I can as long as its worth 500gp ea + and can be sold in the GE. 
---
I use the 6m dragon crossbow, I was told this was better to use on dragons?

Why would I get a blowpipe? Wouldn't I take more damage? Why would I want to take more damage if my problem is the fact that he clears my food out with his bs? I would also lose my third form of antifire protection, so much stupidity in this I just don't get it. 
---
As I said, I really think I may have come to the end of the line for my nostalgic runescape ride.
---
This game doesn't reward effort, pokemon blue has "your level 99 now!" as well, same dopamine release. I have experienced pretty much all the nostalgic content I can, and anything new seems to be barred.
---
I see. Does the crystal have a channel time like home teleports do?
---
Farm cheap trees until you can plant herbs, do herb runs in between slayer tasks.

FWIW, tithe farm is only worth doing for the outfit if you're going for 200m farming or the seed box if you're a uim

loot box crapware bootleg pokemon
---
nah, same speed and accuracy but about 10 less str bonus
---
This has happened to me also, I know my account was hacked as they logged in whilst I was online on my main. I haven’t changed the password because I thought it was weird they left 500k worth of items on the account and just logged out with out taking a thing.
---
Without a doubt. All this ‘my friend logged out for the last time’ bullshit - death is the only way you log out for the last time. Death.

Real talk though I'm not surprised a dude who has the willpower to max out a UIM has the discipline to do well in the gym. Good shit for our swamp boi.
---
Id used an iphone for last 8ish years, bought a galaxy s9 last fall and I love it. Never had an issue playing osrs mobile.
---
There's good and arguable differences between which is more beneficial to players. If you want to level up faster then superiors would be the way forward but there's not a guarantee that you will hit a superior every task, as they are 1/200 ~~ Or 50/50 ~~ - Though it does also provide the chance of getting an early Imbued heart or eternal gem which could boost monetary gains.
---
Like with slayer tasks, all down to user preference.
---
It doesnt matter if OSRS has been out for 19 years or not. Its true no matter how long the game has been out. But because you are a little slow in the head ill change it for you.

You cannot get 1000 total in 5 years of playing 18 hours a day....

I've always felt that sailing could be a 'Temple Trekking' type Minigame. You could use existing skills to kit out your boat (crafting/fishing for drag nets, rune cannons/cballs for other ships, construction to build a bigger boat, thieving for piracy) and go from island to island for rewards.

Decimate your fucking cash stack with mahog tables and thank me later. Decked poh is fucking lit fam. Worth every penny. Only like 35-40m so for the cost of like prims you get a dope house. Pretty worth if you got cash. You can do oak stuff and save yourself a ton of money itll just take a lot longer.

The problem isn't adblock users it's YouTube demonitizing people's videos for no reason. Also a lot of OSRS content tends to take a long time to produce so even though you can spend 100 hours on a 10 minute video that doesn't mean it's gonna pay rent, especially if it gets demonitized.

Yeah I love spending a year building by account up just to have it all washed away great idea 10/10

I've had a courtesy look for you, in your latest recovery request you didn't match a single password or recovery answer. Your request is not coming from an ISP that has ever been used on the account and your geo location has no matches. The creation ISP you are providing is also incorrect. The only thing that links you to the account is that you live in the same country. We are happy to help if we can, but we need a bit more than that as I'm sure you can understand.

RIP tithe farm quickest method :(
---
So like an authenticator but only for items?
---
Great idea, not really a fan of the whole no combat restriction. From my experience, pking on a 70cb pure in lvl 40 wild is not a fun experience, everytime a 110 sees me im instantly dead. Also the place needs a real reason for people to go there, i like the idea of the pyramid in the middle. Id suggest more entrances so pvmers can get there more safely, only 2 entrances will make it impossible for anyone to get anywhere in the desert without getting smacked.

That's just your opinion. Some people may not enjoy playing an ironman.

---
Your melee is a bit weak but its doable
---
I think that if such a thing existed most people would just convert over to the main server after a bit so it wouldn’t dilute the playerbase in the long run. 
---
On the other hand it could be a nice way for new players to start out considering that one of the complaints from new players (reading app store reviews) is that they have to start out alongside people who have 4 year old accounts. There could even be an annual marketing campaign around the whole thing.
---
I'm scared.... Please whatever you do... Don't look at it's eyes!
---
Oo i completely agree, i just see alot of people complaining about not having a pet when they nowhere near deserve one

Gosh, unlucky indeed. I'm about 2k predominantly solo and seen 3. Two went to other people in teams though lol. Sniped.
---
Hopefully you get one soon
---
Obviously a bunch of people do spell it wrong, but I thought it was just a thing you say when the idea isn't actually genius at all, such as in this context
---
your fashionscape game is painful to look at, i'm going back to 2.2k
---
You’re underestimating how many bots they have with well over 100 hours, by the time the first round of bots get banned they’d have an entire new farm ready to go with already enough or close enough play time
---
Yeah but so many ppl have more than 2 accounts it just couldn’t work
---
Untradeable potions really screws with the herb economy big no here. You think herblore is expensive now? Haha
---
To me that just looks like they are unable to click a person, which could easily be them blocking it on runelite bc of some exploit. Seeing how runelite has managed to cause other bugs that werent evident on the official client, it seemed like a fair question to make
---
Add camel boss so we can get camel pet
---
Yeah I know, it's not a perfect suggestion,
---
Yes you're probably right.
---
Best thing to do is afk bloods, while working on at alt/ironman
---
Gag LVA
---
This suggestion seems pretty sloppy in terms of the attention to detail and lack of creativity in new items/content. Also, a new PvP area will just draw even more people away from the wilderness as it is already. You need to unify a single PvP area and get people to actually want to go to it in order for it to be successful (which is why they add bosses, clue steps, prayer training methods, etc). Your suggestion will ruin both, sadly. Still, I look forward to the desert expansion and hope we can all keep suggesting cool ideas we have!
---
I've found out the problem guys ! In the mobile application You have to options to log in, log in with google and log in with runescape account. There are 2 different things, 2 accounts even though I use the same mail. Weird right ?
---
The rat manages to get away!
---
That's nothing like the stew I tasted. All the spices are wrong.
---
My struggle is getting to 77 rc to do that...
---
To me, fixing the authenticator and the recovery process should be number 1 priorities. 
---
If you can keep people off the account, they can't trade your stuff.
---
Leuke jas heb je aan.
---
I think there is at something a little discouraging about joining any well-established game that has been running for years due to being behind as a new player, especially if you feel competitive. This game has it particularly bad in that aspect because the true end-game is unreachable for most. I do think that it at least plays some part in turning people away.
---
Other games deal with the issue in various ways. For example Hearthstone I believe has a system whereby they retire old card sets from the ranked games which means that no matter how many years the game has run for, as a new player you will never be **that** far behind due to a lack of cards.
---
DOTA2 has the best system of any multiplayer game I’ve encountered. MMR ensures new players face new players, there is even (last time I played, which admittedly was over 5 years ago) a mode for all new players that uses a limited hero pool, and everything that affects gameplay is free as you start with all heroes.
---
WoW is another MMO, and though I’ve not played it from what I understand it is supposedly very quick to reach the level cap and be able to play end-game content, you just to learn the mechanics.
---
So I think OSRS could benefit from something like this as a means of encouraging new players and it’s quite relevant now given the recent new player experience blog.
---
Yea fair point about the servers, though I would never imagine it being as many as 100. I reckon a few servers could just be converted over, maybe with a handful of new ones too.
---
Hopefully that's part of their account security updates.
---
I bet you feel real dumb in this bitch right now
---
they should limit credit cards to only 5 memberships per month
---
Sounds like it will be, fingers crossed🤞
---
Hidden ad
---
Let’s hope that name is not a self-fulfilling prophecy or else that is not going to be a very successful PvP account.
---
Similar to your mum
---
It's not about "can he afford it" it's "should he be forced to do so". Consumables in OSRS typically have never had this type of barrier. All potions and food sources are freely trade-able with the one exception of anti-fire potions and that one exception wasn't implemented as a balance to combat/skilling; it was to deal with bots. 
---
Hell, I can't think of a single thing that improves performance directly in combat and is locked behind a non-combat skill besides slayer helm, and I don't feel that's really a fair comparison to this as slayer is directly related to combat/bossing for the most part. One could argue that rejuv pool and such could be tangentially helpful in that you get to restore your stats faster, but even that isn't directly helpful like potions.
---
At least my mom charges money unlike yours
---
I think of this as like a new wilderness; far edges of the map contain uninhabitable zones. Literal wilderness.

I feel you, when I did it Nats were still a good way to make money.

Yea that makes it so much better 😂 🤣
---
Also, about your video...
---
The music in the begining is like, really really annoying.
---
sure
---
Thats impossible.
---
Slayer will be super interesting because it has a lot more variables compared to normal artisan skills which are only basically limited by play time. I look forward to seeing those results.
---
Used to actively chop willows rather than AFK'ing it, whenever I saw a head fly off I'd go stand on the spot in hopes the chopper was AFK and wouldn't see it. Once got a rune hatchet head, then I spent a few hours getting a bronze axe head to pop off so I could use the rune one I just stole. Gods I was poor then

It's been my hobby that a bring home a beer coster from my travels around the world and then drink beer while gaming. This one is better tbh.
---
Stop buying gold fellas.
---
Herblore deserves a money making method.
---
His name is like Mitch Vandenretard or something. He’s unfortunately real
---
I don't know which one is the bigger potato, OP or his camera.
---
3,239,698 xp, level 85 is 3,258,594
---
So he's getting it today if he's out to grind. Gz in advance Settled, a month and a half grind doing fucking escort missions has to leave you numb inside
---
When you get 6 hour logged he does it, unless you have 2 accounts where you cycle in which case he does it every server update
---
I hate farming but I need it for elite void so I’ve just been doing 4 pineapple trees a day. Low effort and I get  about 19k xp per day.
---
Why armadyl so high? Did I miss something. Otherwise then yeah I agree.
---
Hell, throw in zenyte too while we're at it. 1/6k.
---
whats your point
---
last one was such a nice touch
---
Slayer helm hardly benefits you over a black mask. You benefit way more from blocking low XP/ horrible tasks and getting superiors than a ear-muff/nosepeg combo helmet. 
---
For dust devils (65+ slayer), then yeah it's worth getting but early slayer you can use your points a bit more strategically
---
Plenty of people get slayer helm later, it's quite common but it's all personal preference at the end of the day! I'm just a guy on the internet
---
This makes some sense but where did you find that out? Sorry I’ve never followed the lore very much
---
LR\_Shiro
---
Awesome I will look into this! Thank you a ton
---
they got high defense so people prefer to skip them
---
Seriously what the fuck is up with some potions passing and others not
---
? Why not put it under one question. Its like jagex is doing this on purpose.
---
Lol I remember going there and sitting down there on the respawning gold thinking ‘it’s free money! I’m rich!’ And people would walk by. We’d talk about telegrabbing and how once we could it’s free money! We buy runes, get a FREE RUBY RING, sell it, repeat. 
---
Never got to tely grab. Came back to OSRS and actually with my older human brain, had s clue and made a sense of how to train. I went to go telegrab that ruby ring out of spite. I went to do it for little me.
---
You have no ‘line of sight’. I just sat there laughing
---
Slayer will start paying off in the 70's and go through the roof in the 80's. If you need more money now I'd recommend looking towards Barrows (get your Mory Hard done!) or Blast Furnace. You don't have access to good afk monsters yet. 
---
Slayer is repetitive. I killed \~720 gargoyles this weekend. Very slow skill to train, I hated lower level slayer.
---
Np. Do not expect xp rates in the likes of chinning of cannoning though
---
if you're using runelite it's automatic
---
Everyone knows they'd wear the blue one.
---
2k kills. 3 claws no pet smh
---
Love it, keep it up. The digestive poster was a great add
---
keep in mind a blowpipe is really expensive to keep using, you might be better off using a msbi with amethyst arrows
---
DOes this work on armor
---
Lol preserve scroll soon to be 5gp
---
To think you have to pay to have that shit
---
Had to repost for that karma.
---
blocks cost 100 points :P
---
Flinch it as best you can by walking under her, but she hits like a goddamn bus. 
---
I got the diary requirement by uh... teleporting to lumbridge ^(with zero hp) after the first phase and going back with a new round of supplies to finish phase two.
---
That’s awesome man! That’s a keeper
---
Tears of guthix should have me there in a few years
---
I saw someone catching black chins doing something similar. I couldn't interact with them in any way. Looks like the boys have evolved.
---
i do this on my main sometimes out of boredom haha
---
I don't pk so i use only burst not so often.
---
Are you doing pvp? AGS isn't worth using anywhere for pvm
---
At least 1gp
---
I believe it's one of the first questions on the support faq. "Dude... Where are my stats?" or something like that.
---
 Literally laughing stock of mmorpgs lol.
---
*MAYBE YOU JUST HAVENT TRIED THE RIGHT STRAIN*
---
&gt; What unlock to get first? Slayer helmet. 
---
Never. Ever. Unlock slayer helm first. This is the most common noob trap in this game. Always go with superiors first since they increase your xp and gp/h unlike the helmet.
---
Was this included in her hourly rate?
---
jew-jew
---
he might have a spade!
---
Neat.
---
Gonna really nail down the drop rates on Ammonite Crabs then.
---
how on earth......... is this the definition of no life?
---
ye he stole that 50 cents right from under their noses
---
Just a thought, what if jagex is saving time by banning the accounts that are doing the real-world-trading instead?
---
Yeah I can assume it would be much lower, but would this still be better xp than like msb with mithril arrows on trolls or something?
---
Uh, yes, it does. According to the developer forums.
---
See ya in hot
---
because 124k &gt; 0k
---
If it's off, no one can see if. If it's on "friends", only your friends can see you.
---
How didn't I notice this watching South Park for years.
---
&gt; I'm 23 
---
Judging by your comment, this is false
---
welp
---
u/Thermald would you go with serp helm or like ancestral hat/arma helm? Maybe even slayer helm for less switches and no negative bonus?
---
Dhides is probably better than void range. Biggest upgrades would definitely be rigour, anguish. Suffering is really nice for more recoil charges so you don’t have to put on another ring in the middle of the fight.
---
iron dragons should be blocked, steels and bronze should be skipped because they have lower weights than other things you want to block
---
Everyone will always say "block the tasks you hate, it depends on if you want gp or xp, there's no right answer" etc etc, which is true to an extent, but some tasks just suck no matter what. You should try doing a task once or twice before you decide you hate it, but there are some tasks that are objectively worse. Look at the wiki page for whatever slayer master you're using (probably don't worry about blocks until you're doing either Nieve or Duradel) and sort by Weight.  
---
You want to use your blocks on high weighted tasks. To explain why, let's use Hellhounds and Steel Dragons as the examples. Steel Dragons suck more, but they both suck. You're not going to do either of them anyway. So you should block Hellhounds, and just skip Steel Dragons when they come up.  
---
Common blocks:  
---
Greater Demons (unless you do Zamorak GWD boss)  
---
Black Demons (unless you do Demonic Gorillas)  
---
Hellhounds (unless you do Cerberus)  
---
Fire Giants  
---
Bloodveld
---
Wyrms
---
Drakes
---
Abyssal Demons
---
All of these are kinda shitty both for gp/hr and xp/hr. Abyssal Demons aren't terrible gp/hr, and they require very little attention, but once you get level 85 slayer you'll probably have access to much better gp/hr methods, and you'll want the xp/hr more. I had them unblocked for a while because they're easy to semi-afk while I'm playing on my ironman, but they're really heavily weighted.
---
I agree, tradeable is the way to go.
---
There have been prayers not activating.  I remember everyone thought the fucked up a patch because it felt like the server wasn't responding.  In reality it was just runelites prayer rearrangment plugin, and there were no problems on the official client
---
Slayer helmet came out in 2008 and PS3 in 2007. How would a PS1 game have this cover?
---
Yes smh.
---
I just stole this meme from discord man leave me alone
---
fake, if this was real you’d have 4 warrior rings and 1 berserker, jokes, grats on the rng.
---
ankous are a fast barrage task though
---
This doesn't actually remove coins from the game though, right? It just increases the value of herbs, which shift coins to the people producing herbs
---
Green D’hide tunic tho
---
This content isn't meant to be introducing BIS gear, it's meant to fill a niche.
---
The armour allows players to have an alternative to d'hide with decent prayer bonus that doesn't cost 70-80m+ - I'm sure it will get plenty of use.
---
I do agree that they should be doing more to improve the Crystal Bow, a tradeable and degradable drop from some area of Prifddinas that either increases the stats or increases the attack speed would be cool.
---
The tentacle can poison, not envenom. But the Blade of Saeldor will be useless due to the time investment in order to use it effectively, Jagex aims to make the shards obtainable at a rate of around 50 an hour with each shard adding 25 charges so 100 charges or 2 hours of collecting is required in order to use the weapon.
---
Couple this along with the fact that the whip has 10,000 charges for 2.6m compared to the Blade of Saeldor which has 2,500 it is a near 8 hour investment to get the benefit which is only margainly better than the Abyssal Tentacle which passively obtains the 2.6m needed to fuel it.
---
Funny comic, I laughed

I prefer Charlie The Tramps medium clue.

Thx

If you are doing the method where you don't kite him around and instead just attack him right away at the precise timing then make sure to mark the whole spawn area he is in with tile markers.  If you mess up wait for him to go back to the exact spawn point then try again.  Dong this made me finally get it working.  I can maybe help you out this weekend if you wanted
---
Seriously, I just noticed it myself last night.
---
Devaluing imbued heart so I can afford one Pog
---
Don't you mean guardian boots? IIRC granite boots are a unique Slayer drop from Fossil Island Wyverns.
---
I see a lot of people with a screen that tracks clue scroll/boss drops on here. Is that an option on Runelite or something? I can’t seem to find it.
---
Jokes on you, there’s no string on the twisted bow!
---
Country jig is loud and annoying af
---
9 year old me was certain it was rune's cape, since you know, cool capes everywhere
---
Sell the ags, get piety. 
---
Torso and prims. 
---
You literally have no use for an ags. It’s only meant to be used for pvp. It’s not 2010 anymore. 
---
And I’m going to say this because I low key think you might be using ags as a primary. Train attack and defense with a whip and strength with an Abby dagger. If you sell your ags you should be able to get piety and an Abby dagger.
---
Let us play as goblins!!!!
---
Oops. Typo. Yeah you’re right lol. I guess it’s too early in the morning for me
---
funnily enough for your levels and budget you have you kind of have your void switches backward, [hides are better than void range](https://i.imgur.com/209xk46.gif) and [void mage is better than ahrims](https://i.imgur.com/7AFFEXb.gif)
---
Torn prayer scroll will be like 1k after this update XD
---
Do it in your house ezpz ;)
---
Torso + Prims, and don’t forget to give mom’s credit card back
---
1 law 1 dust if you've already done a dust devil task.
---
I don't have any experience with that. I just used them because they are only 16gp ea.
---
25m xp no pet yet
---
You get tassets... and you get tassets... and you get tassets! Everyone gets some tassets!
---
never serp helm, i'd camp a magic hat like ancestral hat or ahrims hood over slayer helm
---
Can't watch cause I'm in class, let me guess, 5 mil?
---
It’s called loot tracker I believe.  It’s a plug-in for runelite you can enable in runelite settings.
---
Best rule of thumb: if something sounds too good to be true; it’s because it is too good to be true.
---
Nice! How long is the task if you’re just killing Rex? Lol
---
Repost from when I did this months ago, still funny episode though.
---
Autumn Elegy has a video where he talks about his thoughts on efficient maxing order, maybe get some tips from that?
---
How many caskets can we stack? Is there a limit?
---
Np lol was just confused for a sec :)
---
Nice finding haha
---
Google voice while driving
---
If you were purchasing those herbs from an NPC then yes, the money would be going into a sink because it would never been seen again, what're talking about is the distribution of wealth. Because your bank value is decreasing, that doesn't mean the money is being sank, that requires the money being taken out of the economy's circulation indefinitely.
---
What, did he "accidentally" get 3 extra rc lvls?
---
Love this! The Wind Waker was my first Zelda game. I always loved the Toon Link design!
---
Construction cape*

About 5.4 in the end. Slightly over average. Going to do another batch of 100 soon and see what happens!
---
*Novice Driver*
---
Gl on the ely grind on the normal ironman
---
I get what you're saying with your point about if the potions are untradeable then you're (kind of) forced to grind the optional content, but I'm just confused as to how diaries and sherlock eroded the quality of the game and were bad updates is all.
---
Thanks, I was thinking that I will need to get my combat lvl up for quests as well so this might be worth doing.
---
&gt; Well if you're going to deliberately ignore the point I don't know what I can say
---
I guess you know what everyone else feels when they speak to you then.
---
And SUPER afk
---
Cast low level alchemy on yourself.
---
Yeah, not a bad idea :) I think cannonballs is 35 if I remember correctly, not far to lvl :)
---
Crafting (for the cape) or Construction (for all the POH stuff) are both very useful to have at 99, but require a TON of money. 
---
A realistic 99 to go for with your stats would either be cooking (which is nice because you profit on your way to 99 if you use the Hosidius range) or Firemaking if you do wintertodt, because you'll make a decent amount of money. Neither is particularly useful to have 99 of, but getting there will get you a nice amount of cash. 
---
And the benefits for both don't necessarily come from getting to 99! Like if you only get to 70 firemaking, you'll still have all the rewards from Wintertodt!
---
So Zuhaar (not sure if I spelled it correctly?) for all is lewd Nieve and other lewd drawings of OSRS characters?
---
Not many curb fans here huh

I did want to look into this, passive income is the best

Sorry but I can offer far less help through DM than you using the recovery process, checking passwords for example - try the recovery route

Yeah he might win again, but without the porn this time

True, good luck with the grinds

Thank goodness for game clipping.

Cant have a new grandmaster quest unless it’s easy to market by tagging 2 into something well-known

94 farming and no pet. I dislike you but am happy for you

So I could buy a gf?

\[sipppp\]
---
Yeah guys, I remember when the dragon axe first came out. Heh heh.
---
Almost done Quest Cape and between items, potions and gear I bought I think I've spent around 5-10m for 260 QP. 
---
I have Dragon Slayer 2 and Monkey Madness 2 left. Between the extra disease free herb locations and other locations you unlock that are almost bot free, any money you spend on questing will be made back from the perks and rewards you unlock.
---
but last in votes lmao
---
Depends on your range level, but range is generally easier because of diamond bolts (e). I'd say 85+ range is good enough. I got kbd heads at 186 kc and visage at 150 kc.
---
I don’t understand what the new pots do.
---
Not much for the items that are strictly required. Probably on the order of like \~100k. But like previous people have said, some of the gear needed for higher boss fights will be more.
---
There was intent.. wannabe neckbeard..

Content creator/Jmod circle jerk with a spattering of fan boys and girls. May or may not see Jed. Definitely will see some Neckbeards creepin.

Just always sell in the specific shop its way better
---
I vaguely remember something about this. Wasn't one of them a streamer? Or am I thinking of different event where this happened?
---
Indeed it is derp
---
Yeah like you only have to interact with the game every 3 minutes
---
Void give 10% (12.5 if elite) ranged accuracy and damage and it stack on top of the 20% of the salve amulet (ei) and even with all that you should debuff with a bgs/dwh because his defense is quite high. 
---
Without void your kills will be way too inconsistent  to be worth the effort.
---
I had thought suquahs were pretty decent xp. why do you recommend using expeditious with them?
---
Noob here, is DT2 desert treasure 2 or is it something else?
---
Those Stab+defence bonuses though, it’s like a whip and a shield in one single handed weapon. Plus a beastly crush bonus. Zamorak knew what he was doing with that one.
---
My Free Cams maybe? 😂
---
It's not "ironman mode" trying to creep into the main game, it's setting skill requirements for modular upgrades that gives people a goal to climb towards.
---
Going by your own logic graceful/barrows gloves/hydra gloves should be tradeable simply because you can't be assed to do anything outside of slayer or afk fishing.
---
MMO's (and runescape in particular) are built upon the idea of getting small upgrades for your character one piece at a time through content that everyone does. Not "muh economy", especially when your example doesn't make sense.
---
&gt;I would really not look forward to or enjoy having to make my own pots for the rest of osrs, or any supplies at all. I don’t play Ironman for that reason. Keep supplies the way they are and always have been for non ironman.
---
Then don't. Use the pleb potions for the rest of your life. You don't have to make these potions as you still get the same value with the tradeable doses. Every MMO known to man has "untradeable" goods that are better than traded ones, although the better part is only in a sense of convenience and not stats.
---
u/Morc35 good god, what have you done!
---
Yeah I was gonna say that, what the hell? Best non-degradeable melee weapon is useless... smh
---
Do many people still trade anything though?  only trading i used to do was selling random law runes for like 1k in lummy bank haha
---
Theres some good ironman clan chats around too, good for chatting and help on anything ya need
---
Iron\_Clan and Ironman CC are a couple

Well at least you didn't take a picture on your phone and know how to take an actual screenshot. 
---
Also Happy Cake Day.
---
As you can see it gets upvoted.
---
Yes.
---
I think you could use the shadow enemies to help prevent clans from dominating. You could have them be more likely to spawn in highly populated areas and higher combat levels scaling with group size. On each hit they have a chance to drain run energy or a water skin charge. Unsure if it said dd would be multi or not but if not, these could be super annoying and punish big clans / force them to bring shitty invents. Maybe even let the highest combat level shadows cast teleother to random spots in the desert.

I totally agree. On an unrelated note, why does this persons thumb nail look like a mf grape? Can’t unsee

Then your taking the right path.

No, you're pretty neat

Nah you'll just log out and someone will steal ur account so you have to make a new one and start from scratch cause you know you will. Leaving that toon never played again on ur friends friends list but you can't remember your buddies name to add him or he always has his friends to private :(

I would say if you can do Zulrah, get rigour a d commit some time to it and vorkath maybe some other bosses too so you can rebuild at a faster pace. What is your slayer LVL? What other goals would your money go towards?.
---
I've played on and off for around 15 years. The game is just addicting and you can login one day after not playing for years and get sucked right back in.
---
If you actually fall for a doubling scam, you are too dumb to be on the internet.
---
&gt; Aberrant spectre's are weak to the salve amulet ei and ranged, meaning it would be optimum to use a ranging weapon and the amulet against them respectfully rather than a slayer helmet

Trying to kill the noobs I see, nice

Osrs x tpb memes are making a comeback. Everything is in order

Mobile games where there’s usually some mechanic that is essentially gambling, where you spend money to roll a digital slot machine for a 0.7% chance at getting that character you want, for example. Typically they have very barebones gameplay and thrive off of the whales spending thousands for a chance to get their waifu/husbando

There is the Farmer's outfit you could get from the Tithe Farm minigame which gives a 2.5% xp boost for Farming.

---
Sell everything but an anguish and blowpipe and buy rigour.
---
Not worth the time unless you're an iron
---
why doesnt Ctrl click already do that honestly?
---
Oh, that's what you meant.
---
Sure, but 70 Prayer is super cheap. Even if you're 1 Prayer right now, using dragon bones at the Wilderness Altar you can expect to only use 1464 bones, which is 3.5m (and more if you get PKed I guess). I mean I guess that's a lot, but I was assuming that this dude had hella cash to spare if he's buying an AGS. If that's not the case, then sure I guess he'll get the money by selling his AGS.
---
I'm assuming this dude is also probably like 52-60 Prayer already though so that cost goes down by a bit (maybe 2.7m instead).
---
Pretty sure I saw someone recently with 100m+ farming xp and no pet. Congrats.
---
Margins are higher on other herbs % wise. If you are super tight on cash for seeds you can buy the highest level seed you can plant and gain a small starting cash pool for doing snaps or rannars
---
?
---
No it doesn't lol, torture/anguish/whatever?
---
Probably just stick with trees for xp?
---
FUCKING FINALLY!!! Now THIS is the content we REALLY need!
---
I don't care either. Just thought this was funny and wanted to repost.
---
I unlocked superiors first and got 0 superiors before I unlocked slayer helm
---
You fucking SKANK dont EVER talk to me like that again you fucking BITCH
---
How did you get to that conclusion?
---
Using that logic we should have super ranging and super mage pots, but we don't, and there is no imbalance
---
Yeah so like less than 1 percent of anyone will ever have a trimmed Cape? That makes way more sense
---
I'm not taking about rs3
---
Buy top level first, and the rest of the nugs are ezpz
---
honestly one of my favorite pets right there. Gz my man.
---
I'm pretty sure you are right.  The stat boost I remembered was 125 att/str/def, 107 magic, 121 range.
---
50/50
---
So edgy
---
Jagex needs employees of your caliber!
---
Afk nmz to 90+ combat, then train slayer
---
jagex doesnt ip ban generally, i think it's only in the cases of vpns and bot farms. eg if you play osrs and choose to use a free vpn you might get chain banned if someones running a bot farm on it.
---
people banned are always able to create new accounts. there's nothing stopping them.
---
Jaggleflox takes our 🦀🦀$11🦀🦀 but doesn’t put clan wars back in the wildy or add stealing creation.
---
Banning 400 high level members in 2002 would have been a pretty big deal.
---
As long as it’s garys hood you’ll never be banned
---
Slayers only 68/69 and other then that im not sure tbh. I dont even have ds2 done on this account because like i said it was a pure.  When i messed it up i stoped playing and just focused on the iron and a new pure.  But had some afk stuff to do on the ironman and decided to use the free members on this one. Dont really have any set goals on it just kind of having fun doing what ever. Right now the goal is 400 med clues for the clueless scroll and i have 375 caskets waiting to be open and 2250 more imps to get to 400 but not sure what to do after that. Maybe ill luck out with a few pairs of rangers and this wont even be an issue lol
---
TIL Seercull is BIS. 
---
In all seriousness, I love it :D
---
Why can't working 12 hours a day every day and staying focused be impressive? I'd say it is. Again, not healthy or ideal, but impressive nonetheless.
---
Do you think a guy who is ags spcing his slayer tasks should be bringing bones out to the wildly altar? He will probably use a guided altar so the amount should be doubled. Thus making him need around 5m assuming he has xp already. 
---
An Abby dagger and 70 prayer will cost him about how much the ags costs. 
---
I also want to point out you make a shit ton of assumptions when you read other people’s comments.
---
Very long break on RS3. :)
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEE
---
I know a guy who will fix that for one small favor
---
I like that idea as well. Will bring some variety to the pet chasing goal!
---
Lool love it. No screeching for 2 weeks is pretty expensive tbh
---
Why would I pass up an excuse to kill more goblins?
---
God I wish
---
Called a fake log
---
I read that title 3 times as "my gf made me drink a coaster"
---
Not a bad idea, what would be best to kill with that? Vork? Still working on ds2 so might be a bit off.  Do you think a craws would be a better investment i think its pretty close to the same price as anguish and bp
---
No... Depending on the price*

I got a casket off Charlie the tramp two days ago and got rangers from it, this homeless man gave me 33m
---
That would be baller dude. Stick with that, do some of the quests that were restricted. Your stats seem like they are bossing ready so doing that would  be interesting.
---
Interesting, that seems like it's not targeting the problem for gold farmers, botters, etc from just starting again.
---
I wonder why they don't hardware ID ban? I think they would be allowed to do that?
---
Kinda looks like the origin story of a brainlet
---
It's RAW!

You aren't being indoctrinated by some 'liberal enemy' by going to college, fear-mongering isn't a good excuse to claim you are better for not doing school either. Obviously you don't need school and you aren't any lesser person for not going to it, but you aren't any better person for not either.
---
Neither am I.  I'm talking about the original overload in RS2 before EOC.  If I was talking about RS3 I would have said that the RS3 overload is actually worse than the OSRS NMZ overload.
---
Please, that would be awesome!

Unless somethings been updated, email, old passwords, or recovery questions are the only way.

Thanks man, I’d like to think it’s impressive but my coworkers all do the same, and in some cases we got far over the 12 hours. Sucks, and isn’t healthy, but the money and career progression is worth it.

What's your mining level? The nuggs go up real fast as your LVL goes up. I'm 86 mining and get 6-10 nuggs per full loads. Mining is an exercise in patients
---
I've played osrs for a couple years. I've got pretty decent skills. 80s and such. Never seen a Skilling pet. Introduced my buddy to the game. He got the mining and fishing pets before lvl 50 in both skills. I think we are just cursed.

I'd reckon Lumbridge would be closer but takes more clicks as you have to go upstairs to the bank.

The "dark side" of Runescape is advanced phishing/macroing/bug exploitation. This is a scam that has been executed by 12-year-olds for the past decade and if you fall for it you absolutely deserve to lose your stuff. There is no way that this could be even remotely profitable compared to playing the game legitimately and to make a video about it definitely seems like a huge waste of time.
---
This is like an optical illusion, sometimes you see them as holes or you can see them as bubbles
---
Obviously one will not be a genius for not exploring. They both didn’t do something because of an effect. That’s the only part I compared. Being a genius or not because of a reaction isn’t comparable here. I respect Elon and everything that he’s done and wasn’t disrespecting him in any way.

Id get PTSD from that

I have 700 kills and no pet still, everything else though so that's nice.

Yes, I think that’s the one. Thanks again!

The 2017 rework was by far my favorite
---
If you get the chance, on RS3 there's a quest called  [Evil Dave's Big Day Out](https://runescape.wiki/w/Evil_Dave%27s_Big_Day_Out). Well worth a playthrough.
---
This is exactly it.
---
"job" ;)
---
Not sure. But you can always use abyss if you have an ironman. Assuming thats why you're asking because you might not have a nature tali yet? If you're hc and really dont wanna risk abyss, which isnt that much of a risk at all. Nature talis are quite easy to get anyway
---
Swamp, it's just a swamp. I never have heard it being called anything other than a swamp. Although, according to Shrek, Ogre's live in the swamp and I've yet to see an Ogre in the Lumbridge swamp....
---
MSU? Dansgame
---
Base 40 and all f2p quests is enough
---
Yeah all of those were from the hill giants in the wilderness about 7k kills
---
Just not efficient to, but there is I suppose

O yeah
---
nope, i love the quests, quest in this game are so unique and actualy quests.

Pro tip if you don’t have 61 range yet use onyx bolts
---
I'm actually not sure tbh, it used to be the case that it was easy to get around, but seeing discussions about games like Fortnite and DBD, the anticheats seem like they've gotten better, doesn't help that cheaters spread propaganda like crazy to downplay the problem, claiming that the anticheats work.
---
Any word on ticket pricing?
---
Just stats, or items etc as well?  The last time I played "OSRS" was the most current game.
---
What's even worse is that the goblins in goblin village have forgotten the reason they cared so much about the colors.
---
The goblin symbol book from the lost tribe quest says: "The separate identities of the tribes have long since dissolved and no goblins remember the symbols, although their generals may still recognise the ancient tribal names."
---
The colors, red and green, stand for the Thorobshuun and Garagorshuun, the hill goblins and sea goblins respectively, and goblin diplomacy shows their extremely different cultures being replaced by one of meaninglessness.
---
Goblin culture has eroded, and what was once one of the most powerful warlike races, so strong that saradomin and zamorak both struck a bargain with Bandos to have goblin armies of their own (likely the Saragorgak and the Huzamogaarb tribes), can no longer remember their tribes, or the history behind them. Without any kind of organized military (their greatest advantage in battle was bandos' training and military command structure) they're destined to forever be fodder for ever noob who comes off tutorial island.
---
Glad to help! :)

No days off and trying to grind 99 prayer 😂😂

Found the Ohioan. You’re just mad nobody likes Ohio aside from Cedar Point.
---
It's useless because there's always a better option at every place apart from vasa crystal, and it costs 180m so it definitely should be compared to the best options available.
---
No, just like any other skill if done for a long period of time, slayer can get very boring for me.
---
If you had an account in 2007 it is still on the runescape 3. Osrs requires you to start over.
---
HEY pker next to you!
---
The reason it doesn't last is because it's not sustainable. If there is a bunch of skillers are out there, that attracts more pkers which kill off the skillers until it's not a viable method anymore. Revs are still popular because they are crazy money even if you bank every 5 minutes and there isnt high reqs to go there. 
---
The general vibe I get from your comments is you think the wild should include aspects from all other parts of the game. I think the contrary, so basically it should be focused on just pvp. I think pvp worlds or deadman mode is a better platform to encourage pvp in all aspects of the game.

I was just reading there where it says REDBERRY PIE

Mr. Slave’s big adventure

I will! Thanks. Got all the tiles marked but can't follow if I don't know which rotation I'm at :/
---
Saw a dude cash in 119 keys and he got 12.3m yesterday. I was in awe of his patience to hold on to that many keys.
---
That's so adorable I hope you make more!
---
I think they could work on varlamore + a kourend house rework at the same time. That's more or less what happened with kebos + hosidius rework, and both of those turned out really well.
---
Change the password on your account and linked email and make sure you have 2 factor authentication on both. Make sure to set unique and secure passwords.
---
Depends on the severity of what you did, but try the appeal process and see what happens. An old account that got perm banned of mine got unbanned eventually after a few years.
---
yep. I just got 99 in most my combat stats from nmz, I pretty much dont even wanna play on my account anymore lol. Started an ironman and the game is fun again. Wish I woulda done that from the start. At least I have an account I can grind vorkath and snake on to get money for bonds.

#FreeLOP

Just use your penis its more precise

Thank you! I'll be sure to do that =)

Rather be here than Alabama, lol. Will agree though not a huge fan, and this weather lately is hell on my shitty knees.
---
Welcome to the OSRS community! I hope you will enjoy the wonderfull world of bots, gamblers, scammers, masters in the art of being sarcastic and of course the people who will actually be kind and helpful to you in-game!
---
Nope not until next Friday.
---
Last year pricing were £135 (early bird)/£150
---
It's time.
---
Yeah you make a lot of money! I don't know how much at 50 Farming, but I've got 94 and I make \~150k per run. 
---
The green farming weapon is magic secateurs, you get the from the Fairy Tale Part 1 quest, they boost the yield from herb and allotment patches (you have to wield them, not just have in your inventory).
---
You can't pay someone to watch your herbs, so they'll always have a chance of dying unfortunately.
---
Use ultracompost for sure, it increases your yield and decreases the chance of the herbs dying.
---
Added tip! - Once you reach 76 farming (sounds really far off, but if you do consistent farm runs you'll get there in no time) start planting Anima Seeds in the farming guild. I prefer Attas Seeds to increase yield, but the Iasor are good too, to reduce the chance of the crops dying even further! Hope this helps!
---
My family loves Michigan, my best friend and his family love State, and I'm just sittin' here like "How 'bout that hockey."
---
Depends on the supply and demand, which differs all the time. More people may do raids in the weekends so the price is lower on mondays, but that's not because it's monday but because more people did raids
---
Different scam - but had a dude asking for food at GE.  Have him some tuna then he trades me a Falador Tele tab and asks me to meet him there.  Takes me to top of castle and claims to be Rs3 YouTuber comparing the generosity of the communities. Then asks me about biggest accomplishment and to show in trade. Also asks what i would think about getting a tbow/scythe etc. 
---
Ends up telling me i need to trade him and he will give back (I’m in discord with him and rando at this point). I tell him I’m not comfortable (trying to be nice), and after telling them to kick rocks - his buddy asks me for feedback on his gold buying site?? 
---
Scams all around people. Please be safe and careful. DTA.
---
Well if I say what I got banned for this post will get removed. On the date of the offense I was fishing by Otto's house. All I can think of that would possibly warrant the ban would be when I would go to the gym or had things to do I'd have my buddy log in and fish for me. I also have my f keys bined to my mouse buttons so I can play one handed however I don't think that's bannable.
---
That's why you gotta learn one rotation at a time how I told you. Once you get real good at one you can just farm and make enough gp and then can try the next.
---
Or being in debt because of MLM scheme

What do you think would constitute evidence?
---
yikies
---
f2p, basically never. Ogress Warriors and Shamans are the best i believe, and their most exciting drop is Rune Full Helm.
---
Members, your stats are probably fine to kill blue or green dragons, and you can get hard clues from them as well as a lot of money. Outside of that its mostly slayer monsters, so I would recommend training that as well!
---
Huge plans for this weekend! Barbecues, party’s, parades... can’t wait to cancel all of those to grind rs ;)
---
Hell yes dude, way to life.
---
Add me if you want, W0rldHunger.
---
Crystal bow is iconic and still very useful. Theyve talked about the redwood shortbow b4 but never did it.
---
Slayer helm and anguish is better than nose peg and salve
---
I have to agree with the point with the Blade. There's nothing unique about it plus it degrades. Are the shards trade-able? If not, then I can't see a lot of people using it considering you're going to have to commit a lot to obtaining the shards. For a weapon that's just barely better than the tent-whip the Blade overall doesn't sound that enticing. It will at least have some use for ToB but beyond that it needs some help. The Blade is definitely going to need a special attack or passive, right now it seems like a boring weapon with seemingly high-maintenance. I'm sure Jagex are going to repoll a special attack for the weapon, as it desperately needs something extra.
---
I think Jagex also needs to take a look at the Rapier, BIS-stab/1-handed melee weapon means nothing when everything worth mentioning is superior to the rapier (bp, arclight, dhl, and probably the Blade).
---
Well my friends told me when I first started that you haven't truly started playing runescape till you get banned and come back. So I guess I knew what I was in for ;-
---
Other people have talked about pvm/skillers being forced/baited here but the only thing I really disagree with is that you've put a quest in a pvp zone. Pvm and Skilling in pvp areas is just risk vs reward that's cool, a main quest in a pvp area is bogus.
---
I don't like pvp and don't particularly care to do it 
---
So I don't. It's that easy. Main quests are pvm and should remain so. 
---
I pvm/quest because I enjoy it. I'm nearly finished with QC and I cant think of anything worse than being forced into a pvp area to finish it. If it were a miniquest or side quest then meh
---
Rip your rng m8.
---
If you quit don’t drop or give anything away. I recently did exactly that then started playing again and it fucked me over big time. Just take a break and then come back and kill zulruh. Dude I died a lot learning zulruh but once I knew it....EZ mode boss.
---
If you have the money for the gear you describe then you can buy the stats and gear for DS2
---
I'm gonna have a housewarming party which I'm excited about! In osrs I'll probably try to do some more raids, I only have 2 kc but I like it! 
---
I'm also starting an unofficial group ironman soon with some guys from my clan, so thats fun!
---
Alright that's why it has been so confusing, those melee phases tbh. Have been trying to lock which rotation I'm on but haven't been able. Thank you!
---
Get 77 and you can boost to do fremmy elite
---
I miss this shit man. I’ve always loved f2p clan wars and pking even though I’ve always been a member. It’s simplistic so having a fuck ton of people doing it is insanely fun.
---
I know this is old but how the hell do you only have 5 wrath talismans? I legitimately have gotten minimum 30 wrath talisman drops at 800 kc.
---
Got my questcape before at 69 slayer :)
---
Unfortunately it really isn't that useful with how accessible and strong the blowpipe is. I agree that its iconic AF though.
---
Depends on what the ban was for. But if it’s a macroing major and it was appealed, then they have evidence to justify it.
---
Also immune
---
It'll tell you what you're getting banned for and the only thing you can do is appeal. I've heard stories of people writing real long appeals basically crying and begging to jagex to give them another chance and it working.
---
Yeah, I just came back a few weeks ago after a 10 year "break".  Of course, with the jump to OSRS, I had to make a brand new account rather than using my old one.
---
Absolutely. But raids and such are high end pvm content. It should be locked behind pvm content such as quests. Slayer bosses are locked behind slayer levels (and some degree quests I guess) even the only skilling boss is locked behind a min level (I also think there should be some minimal korend quest to unlock it as well)
---
RuneScape depiction of weapons is pretty childish compared to what the weapons were actually used like in Medieval ages.
---
For example a short sword and a longsword one determined by the blade size but rather the size of the hilt. A longsword meant that you would use the weapon with two hands because of the longer hilt.
---
And most of medieval warfare it was all about bludgeoning your opponent that was wearing armor. It's better do this people would take their swords and hold them by the blade and smash the hilts into their opponents to fracture their bones or Dent their armor making it difficult for them to move.
---
The hilt of a sword was used for defense mostly to prevent a glancing Blow from traveling down your weapon and chopping your hands off.
---
Giant two-handed weapons were not very popular in medieval warfare from what I understand.
---
That's why I stopped taking Tylenol
---
Anti-fire Dragonfireshield Shield
---
That one did burn me out for several weeks as there was always just one more requirement.
---
do vorkath instead. way easier, better profit.
---
 11m? Lmao. Fucking hell.
---
&gt; that may or may not be the type of the ban
---
Are you trying to play some secretive type of game or do you want people to help you? Knowing the type of the ban would be much useful unlike saying "we can neither confirm nor deny"
---
Oh ye i remember playing Tekon
---
that's a little late imo
---
Red n white

Just did it on mobile. 7 attempts of fucking up a switch and I sold half my bank, bought rigour and got a slayer task. Had jad dead before healers 😂

I hope you have better luck than I

1m hour l o l.  Gorillas are definitely not more go/hr than Zulrah.

Art style reminds me of Hollow Knight!

Ok, keep believing that. Thank you for keeping Gorillas profitable for me! :\\\^)
---
Exercising moderation?
---
It’s skewed and not a fucking screenshot. How hard is it to press the screenshot button in RL or even OSB
---
I have been falsely banned for macroing three three times. Two of those bans just got lifted without notice, the third account wasn't that lucky. Saw this post and tried to log in on it again.  Found out you can appeal a ban for the first time. 
---
on the official osrs client:
---
Try to log in, click to go to the support page. Scroll down and follow the steps to appeal the ban.
---
I hope we both get our accounts back. 
---
Good luck.
---
if you can get the bank for a dhcb, that and a welfare setup at vork will get you some serious cash. I'm currently in the dhcb rebuild going for rigour next.
---
Got me good lmao
---
And here I am with fenkenstrain tabs lmao
---
Different log in email to recovery email. Unique password to recovery mail and OSRS. 2FA on recovery email and OSRS. Bank pin.
---
That's the most secure you can get, I think. Along with maybe occasional virus checks just in case of RAT or something else.
---
How did you get hacked anyways?
---
Why are people downvoting this? It is a good suggestion to add extra security to account. This doesn't harm real players but it does make it harder for hackers to get stuff.
---
Imagine adding in a /s after you’ve already been downvoted and trying to then pass your comment off as tongue in cheek
---
What about Zeah and raids and the inferno and everything else they’ve change. I’m not agreeing with his idea but we’re not playing 07scape anymore this is a whole different game basically.
---
Go for diaries, all round skilling and questing goals!
---
I think it's a great idea, we need more content in the wilderness. I could see PvMers and Pkers alike having fun doing this, it feels more like a minigame than just something you do for the hell of it. Maybe the rewards could be some ''edgy'' cosmetic items for some of the more common pking weapons and armour. I could see alot of streamers having a hell of a time doing this with their viewers and whole Youtube series based on this. Make the wilderness great again, or atleast give it some unique worthwhile content.
---
Have you seen the diagram on the wiki?

Sorry to hear it man, that sucks. Fuck that guy!

Not really sure other than I know they filed a “recover my account” appeal, I couldn’t log in this morning. Went to reset my password thinking I forgot it, and then the email attached to the account wasn’t mine, I appealed it back this morning and just got an email from jagex this morning having me change my password again, then got in to see this carnage. Unless I can change my email ( I stupidly used the same one I had to recover my account in panic) then I’m sure they’ll just do it again. I have all the safety requirements to keep my stuff locked down for a reason. They even got into my bank with my bank pin.
---
Wait wtf my clan is doing sotw hunter atm too
---
I'd finish DS2 then try vork and zulrah to see which you prefer.
---
They both blow barrows out of the water, even with subpar gear and bad kills per hour. Vork is easier to learn and cheap to gear for if you have void, but is more boring in my opinion.
---
I agree with what you're saying and you do have a good point. I'd prefer less change to the game myself, but without new content people will lose interest after a while and all of these updates are original and exclusive to osrs? I may be mistaken in that, but I've only been back playing for about a month after a 3 year hiatus.
---
You might have a keylogger or something. I would make a new thread about it until someone can pin down and understand what all happened.

we should just make it its own skill, give it a good use ^/s

Maybe might make walking bandos and such easier, but it's such a good idea that I think we'd all be ok with making some content a tiny bit less click intensive for the sake of this.

Blizzard CS team could do more for appealing your ban than runescapes team ever could

It doesn't affect gameplay so it's nothing to really worry about. Just sit back and enjoy the game for what it is.

This is the real life ending. And it’s good.

Tbf, if your defence is already decent you could pick a monster with the same defensive stats but more hp if you don't want to have to click every 3 hp

I can guarantee more than 90% of players have never used the plugin. It wasn’t even around when most people learnt zulrah.
---
Thought it was a 3d render for a sec. Your lighting is great, but i think your blending of shadow (except for the knees) is a little muddy. After looking at this for a min im still actually not sure if this is 3d or not. If it is 3d id recommend using a program where you can texture with pbr textures (like substance painter or quixel), makes the lighting feel a lot more real. Otherwise if its 2d, try making the lightest light and the darkest dark closer to each other (takes some fuckin around wit it) and it should feel more realistic after some practice. Also the specular on some of the metal pieces should be just as bright or brighter than the light of her leg, would be strange if her leg/hair gets shinier than metal.

Try actually doing them with only quests guides to supplement when you actually hit a wall and can’t figure it out, I have a new found enjoyment doing quests with a notebook and a pen jotting dialogue hints down (I find it more engaging than using notepad in windows) and actually using my brain to solve the quest, rather than just listening to the soothing voice of slayermusiq1 and clicking along brainlessly.

That isn't moderation tho that's just the opposite end of the spectrum, as in, shit

I’ll fight you on that one. Legit one of the worst quests imo.
---
The we do raids discord has lots of good information for team raids. Woox has an excellent but old video on solo Cox that covers many of the methods succinctly, but is outdated on a fair few parts. Synq has an incredibly in depth guide on every aspect of solo raiding but is slightly outdated since it came out before ice demon and tekton were rebalanced, among other things.
---
You can download an auto clicker that has nothing to do with runescape and that no one will be using to steal your runescape account.
---
You can also write your own auto clicker within 30 minutes of looking up a video guide of how to get started programming.
---
I love how big of a dickhead the king is. Makes killing him thousands of times in nmz much better
---
believe it or not i legit remember this update. my friend and i had just started messin around with a botting program (we were like 12, early life of mmos, etc etc we didnt know any better) and this was like a big time reality check. we straightened up immediately lol.
---
I made a post a couple days ago where I asked if there was a chance in hell to appeal my undeserved macro major ban and it got instantly removed
---
Oh, I just hate firemaking. I've completed 22 masters. There are only 4 steps I can't do. If I got one of the other 3, then I'd gain a couple of levels. I'll eventually get firemaking up there, but didn't want to deal with it the last couple of times.
---
Just ordered one and I don’t even have a car.
---
Using a 3rd party client, like Runelite, which will show you the rotation aka what rooms you’ll have in the raid. 
---
Since there are different combinations of the rooms you can get, scouting can sometimes become tedious if you have bad rng. 
---
So people go on discord’s like We Do Raids and look for scouted Raids that have the best rooms for a fast raid and pay a finder’s fee of around 100k to get that raid. This is where the 100k gp sink comes into play. 
---
You don’t have to pay for it though, if you have a group you can just hop worlds and scout all together. It just tends to help speed up the process if you use a previously scouted raid.
---
One day you're gonna learn, no worries.
---
Honestly lessers are pretty chill compared to a lot of what she assigns.
---
Ahhh. The team we can all agree to hate.
---
Ah ok interestinng.
---
My first master on my hcim is equip an abyssal whip and I’m 81 slayer. I’ll take that motivation.
---
That's runescape as a whole really
---
When you just broke up with your gf and trying to play less rs and see this
---
I hate runescape. I'M TRYING TO GET MY DAMN QUEST CAPE AND ALL THEY'VE BEEN DOING IS JACK UP THE SKILLS LIKE CRAZY FOR THE QUESTS, FUCK ME MAN, WHAT'S NEXT? 80 RC?
---
Until you get banned and lose all that time for being a degen.
---
&gt; used to play RS3
---
Bold start, diving into this sub ass-first I see.
---
Scouting a raid refers to entering a raid and trying to find a favourable rotation. Prescouting means the same thing, except you do it on an alt account while you raid on your main account. Generally speaking, for efficient teams, everyone does this to aim for the most amount of raiding per hour. What this suggestion does, is allow raiding teams to in effect do what is already done, but in a simpler way. It won't change the meta at all, people already prescout for the best rotations anyway. So, this update would just remove the nuisance that is scouting and also directly benefit the economy with a gold sink; 1 more defence against an rs3 like economy in my view.
---
Long story short, it means you fight 1v1 on accounts with 1 defence using 3 combat styles (generally ice barrage, a crossbow, and a spec weapon) while using overhead protection prayers (protect from melee, range, mage).
---
The days of "cheap" pking isnt really dead, low level pure pking at edgeville isnt that expensive, but if you go on a mid level main that's not built for pking and/or you aren't experienced, you will probably get destroyed most the time until you get used to it and all the tactics people use nowadays.
---
I'm very impressed by your meme skills.
---
Or wherever skillers go to shit their pants?
---
Anything Jagex tried besides runescape has failed.
---
Mate if you're a proper slayer you'll get barrows gloves as fast as you can, just look up those stats, too good not to.
---
Does it know when there's another fucking swampletics episode?! 
---
I quit 4 years ago and this motherfucker settled came along and now I have another god damn account. 
---
I have a family now for christ sake! 
---
.... 
---
And that's 42 agility.
---
Aren't you technically complaining about toxic players right now though...
---
They should buff Halberds attack speed to match battle axes imo.
---
D
---
That’s what I got 85 fm for
---
Go do some farming dude. Easy passive money. Herbs +yannile hops.
---
Wipe off those chairs again, boys!
---
You can meet Mod Ash. So...
---
I just want passive death runes. Every single time I'm like "I can pee and make it back before a pker shows up" I dont
---
Karma for all the Pvmers doing slayer tasks you've probably killed. I feel nothing when pvpers  complain
---
Personally I’d use chaps, snakeskin boots, and an archer helm.
---
But it did pass, only the special attack failed.
---
Maybe it wasn't an English degree
---
Don’t do slayer in wildy or pvp worlds if you aren’t ready to die or kill, Simple as that.
---
just delete firemaking honestly
---
Op doesn't have gear for hydra. He was specifically asking if he should do konar tasks or wildly tasks and I answered accordingly.
---
Go Away!
---
I've played off and on since late 2002, and I always come back to it. I don't know what it is, but I love it.
---
that i planted palm trees/magic trees and posion berrys till almost 91 farm and did even its by farming 3 methods at costs alot, but just get it from jespori seed
---
Post your username so people can look up the stats to know it’s legit. Along with the email tied to it
---
Thats against the rules.
---
Sauce?? (This sounds weird...)
---
No exceptions unless you're a streamer/youtuber
---
Rude as fuck.
---
obvi the game, but do you mean this subreddit?
---
Your stats aren't near high enough for your cb level for Bounty hunter / PVP world pking.  Id suggest gearing up with some xericians / water staff and seeing who you can find in the wildy or finding a clan and heading to revs
---
or I could give you screenshots
---
Is any 90 really fast though
---
Show her your battle scars from when you got ambushed with a dds spec.
---
Also you can go to white portal in 302 to get some practice venge pking without risking gp
---
Head over to sythe for that stuff man. You'll just get trolled here.
---
Every OSRS burnout knows what it's like to bank 4x+ for one item, leaving and thinking you grabbed what you needed but you took something else instead.  THIS during quests is what hell really is.
---
I wish jagex would make the ingame models more like this, much more realistic than that are currently. The art is brilliant.
---
Can you I wanna see the account .
---
I’ve made a decent amount off of them. Just depends on the bot
---
I actually did the math on this (Shameless Plug https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bq191h/jagex_please_read_the_comment_below/) the TLDR is they make 22.4m per hour per emblem farm (Theres 3 of them I know of)
---
LOL 6’3 and 140 considered healthy? HAHAHAHAHA you’re a fucking hunchback beta boy lanklet go eat a hamburger
---
Man I actually laughed 😂 please post this tomorrow or something
---
No its not, you can buy and use every potion regardless of herblore level. Making the BiS potions untradeable would be what turns herblore into a combat skill.
---
Well you didnt use protect for melee, thats why they are dying
---
Consider this Resolved! Mod Ash ftw! He says they'll block the random events in that area! Yay!
---
This is a horrible idea. This would turn herblore into even more of a combat skill.
---
So he's wearing Pegasian boots, meaning he has 75 defence, yet he's wearing a rangers tunic? BIS my ass.
---
New log in screen

Flax n chill is a real cool dude in wph
